40|$|How do {{top-down}} factors (e. g., task expectancy) and bottom-up factors (e. g., task recency) interact {{to produce}} an overall level of task readiness? This question was addressed by factorially manipulating task expectancy and task repetition in a task-switching paradigm. The effects of expectancy and repetition on response time tended to interact underadditively, but only because the traditional binary task-repetition variable lumps together all switch trials, ignoring variation in <b>task</b> <b>lag.</b> When the task-recency variable was scaled continuously, all 4 experiments instead showed additivity between expectancy and recency. The results indicated that expectancy and recency influence different stages of mental processing.

40|$|When we {{switch to}} a new task, {{performance}} is transiently relatively poor, but improves dramatically after one trial. Such a “switch cost ” may result from the preceding task being highly primed while the new task is not yet primed. This predicts that it should become more difficult to switch back to Task A when more trials of Task B have intervened. Such a lag effect {{has been found in}} some but not in most previous experiments, and to resolve this discrepancy we examined the effects of <b>task</b> <b>lag</b> with different stimuli. We found that when stimuli uniquely and clearly cued the task—minimizing the need for control—switch reaction time increased with <b>task</b> <b>lag.</b> However, when the need for control was increased by using similar or identical stimuli in the two tasks, this lag effect was abolished or reversed. Thus only when control processes are minimized can priming explain the difficulty of switching back from Task B to Task A. Second, we asked how the impact of control is mediated in conditions where it is not minimized. If it is mediated through altering the relative activation states of competing tasks, then as it becomes easier to do one task—the relative task-set activation state is tipped in that task’s favour—it should always become harder to do the other task. On the other hand, if control bias affects switch performance directly, this relationship need not hold. We found that as it becomes easier to perform one task it can become easier, not harder, to switch to the competing task. Thus control bias must act directly on switch performance, rather than only through its influence on relative task-set activation. Cognitive control is often studied by requiring participants to switch repeatedly between simple tasks. Average performance on task-switch trials usually suffers compared to that on task-repeat trials, and the cause or causes of this “switch cost ” remain debated (e. g., Allport, Styles, &...|$|E
40|$|The typical finding from {{research}} on metacomprehension is that accuracy is quite low. However, {{recent studies have}} shown robust accuracy improvements when judgments follow certain generation tasks (summarizing or keyword listing), but only when these tasks are performed at a delay rather than immediately after reading (Thiede 2 ̆ 6 Anderson, 2003; Thiede, Anderson 2 ̆ 6 Therriault, 2003). The delayed and immediate conditions in these past studies confounded the delay between reading and generation tasks with other <b>task</b> <b>lags,</b> such as the lag between multiple generation <b>tasks</b> and the <b>lag</b> between generation <b>tasks</b> and judgments. The first two experiments disentangle these confounded manipulations and provide clear evidence that the delay between reading and keyword generation is the only lag critical to improving metacomprehension accuracy. The third and fourth experiments show that not all delayed tasks will produce improvements and suggest that delayed generative tasks provide diagnostic cues about comprehension that are necessary for improving metacomprehension accuracy...|$|R

Sensitivity {{analyses were conducted to}} assess whether these associations were robust to assumptions in the exposure assessment for which support could not be obtained due to lack of either measurements or direct observations. METHODS: New exposure estimates were generated by changing assumptions on exposure levels, specific <b>tasks,</b> <b>lags,</b> and coal tar use. Subsequently, Poisson regression models estimated relative risks (RRs); change in fit of models was evaluated. RESULTS: The influence of these assumptions was minimal, with log-likelihood deviations between - 5. 0 and 4. 7 % and similar patterns in dose-dependent increases of lung cancer risk. In the highest exposure categories, point estimates of RRs ranged 2. 07 - 2. 83 for average, and 1. 22 - 2. 23 for cumulative exposure.

40|$|We {{report a}} series of dual-task experiments, in which a rapid serial visual {{presentation}} (RSVP) task was combined with a visual search task. Orientation, motion, and color were used as the defining target features in the search <b>task.</b> <b>Lag</b> between target onsets was manipulated and interference between the two tasks was quantified by measuring detection scores for the search task {{as a function of}} lag. While simultaneous performance of an orientation detection task with an RSVP letter identification task resulted in a performance decrease for lags up to 320 ms, no such decrease was detected for highly salient motion- and color-defined targets. Subsequently, detectability of the motion and color feature was matched to that of the orientation-feature resulting in the reintroduction of a (smaller) performance decrease, but only during simultaneous performance (lag 0 ms). The results suggest that there are two causes for the impaired search performance occurring when a feature search task is combined with an RSVP task. The first is short-lasting interference probably due to attentional competition; the second, which plays a role only when targets for both tasks share features, is interference that may be attributed to a central processing bottleneck. © 2013 Ettwig, Bronkhorst...|$|E

40|$|Fish tank virtual reality” {{refers to}} the use of a {{standard}} graphics workstation to achieve real-time display of 3 D scenes using stereopsis and dynamic head-coupled perspective. Fish tank VR has a number of advantages over head-mounted immersion VR which makes it more practical for many applications. After discussing the characteristics of fish tank VR, we describe a set of three experiments conducted to study the benefits of fish tank VR over a traditional workstation graphics display. These experiments tested user performance under two conditions: (a) whether or not stereoscopic display was used and (b) whether or not the perspective display was coupled dynamically to the positions of a user’s eyes. Subjects using a comparison protocol consistently preferred head coupling without stereo over stereo without head coupling. Error rates in a tree-tracing task similar to one used by Sollenberger and Milgram showed an order of magnitude improvement for head-coupled stereo over a static (nonhead-coupled) display, and the benefits gained by head coupling were more significant than those gained from stereo alone. The final experiment examined two factors that are often associated with human performance in virtual worlds: the lag (or latency) in receiving and processing tracker data arid the rate at which frames are updated. For the tree-tracing <b>task,</b> <b>lag</b> had a larger impact on performance than did frame update rate, with lag having a multiplicative effect on response time.

Executive control processes {{play a critical role in}} our ability to flexibly adapt to changing environments. For instance, control processes are needed to ensure that the cognitive machinery are configured to perform the task appropriate to the current goals rather than some competing task (such as the one performed most recently or most frequently). In most cognitive psychology experiments, however, executive control processes are held constant rather than investigated. As a result, relatively little is known about them. In particular, little is known about how bottom-up, stimulus-driven processes interact with top-down, executive task-control processes.

Methods: Review of the interruption literature from psychology, human-computer interaction; experimental studies of electronic prescribing and error behaviour; observational studies in emergency and intensive care.

40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} effect of interruptions and task {{complexity}} on error rates when prescribing with computerized provider order entry (CPOE) systems, and to categorize the types of prescribing errors. Design: Two within-subject factors: task complexity (complex vs simple) and interruption (interruption vs no interruption). Thirty-two hospital doctors used a CPOE system in a computer laboratory to complete four prescribing tasks, half of which were interrupted using a counterbalanced design. Measurements: Types of prescribing errors, error rate, resumption <b>lag,</b> and <b>task</b> completion time. Results: Errors in creating and updating electronic medication charts that were measured included failure to enter allergy information; selection of incorrect medication, dose, route, formulation, or frequency of administration from lists and drop-down menus presented by the CPOE system; incorrect entry or omission in entering administration times, start date, and free-text qualifiers; and omissions in prescribing and ceasing medications. When errors occurred, the error rates across the four prescribing tasks ranged from 0. 5 % (1 incorrect medication selected out of 192 chances for selecting a medication or error opportunities) to 16 % (5 failures to enter allergy information out of 32 error opportunities). Any impact of interruptions on prescribing error rates and task completion times was not detected in our experiment. However, complex tasks took significantly longer to complete (F(1, 27) = 137. 9; p< 0. 001) and when execution was interrupted they required almost three times longer to resume compared to simple <b>tasks</b> (resumption <b>lag</b> complex= 9. 6 seconds, SD= 5. 6; resumption lag simple= 3. 4 seconds, SD= 1. 7; t(28) = 6. 186; p< 0. 001). Conclusion: Most electronic prescribing errors found in this study could be described as slips in using the CPOE system to create and update electronic medication charts. Cues available within the user interface may have aided resumption of interrupted tasks making CPOE systems robust to some interruption effects. Further experiments are required to rule out any effect interruption might have on CPOE error rates. 9 page(s...|$|R

Report and detection are two tasks commonly used to measure RB. Participants are required to report targets in the report tasks, while {{they are required to}} detect repetition in the detection task. However, it is unclear whether strategic differences between the two tasks affect RB. In Experiment 1, we measured RB with the two tasks by using two common types of stimuli, letters or words, as the targets, and with symbols as the distractors. A significant RB was found in the detection task, but not in the report task. This surprising result {{may be due to the}} order effect of the two tasks. Therefore, we manipulated the order of the two tasks sequentially in Experiment 2 and studied the lag interval between two targets as well. The result was consistent with Experiment 1 in that RB was found in the detection <b>task</b> across 4 <b>lag</b> intervals but priming was found in the report task. Thus, across the two experiments, RB was found more easily in our detection task than in our report task.

40|$|Based on {{the results}} of our {{questionnaire}} survey, our study presents the major operational features of LEADER LAGs established in Hungary {{in the second half of}} 2007. Our national survey indicated that most of the partnerships established do not have experience in the implementation of community-based rural development programmes and there are no traditions and practices for development cooperation, which may cause problems as the success of programme implementation highly depends on the preparedness of local society, on the cooperation of local people. The survey indicates that the development of areas covered by LAGs is hindered by so-called soft factors characterizing human resources (rural people and communities). Therefore human resources are not only factors of the rural economy but areas for development as well. Having examined the <b>tasks</b> of <b>LAGs,</b> it can be established that they deem it to be their principal task to grant support funds. In our opinion, performance of this task is obviously necessary but far from sufficient to fulfil their catalyst role expected in local developments. For this purpose, it is essential for action groups to play a proactive role in organizing and thereby increase the capacity of local communities, a prerequisite for implementing a LEADER programme. In accordance with the basic principle of subsidiarity, rural development should be implemented locally, managed by local communities, and decisions should be made at local levels in a decentralized manner. At the same time, the survey points out that LAGs operate under strong government influence and control, leading to the conclusion that the Hungarian practice of the LEADER programme is characterized by decentralization without subsidiarity. In the present structure, the activities of LAGs are predominantly financed from central resources. Administration is the primary goal of their financing, which restricts their effective and efficient operations, thereby the successful implementation of the LEADER programme. It is unquestionable that LAGs need to be centrally financed since their operation is fundamental for programme implementation, but this requires more than acting in their present role of distributing resources. In order for action groups to fulfil their real roles to boost local developments, they need to recognize their mission; and from the financing and regulatory side, they must be enabled to complete the tasks expected from them and their function. endogenous development, Local Action Groups (LAG's), cooperation, social capital, capacity-building, subsidiarity, sustainability, Community/Rural/Urban Development,...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{effect of}} {{stimulus}} frequency on tilt and translation motion perception was studied during constant velocity off-vertical axis rotation (OVAR), and {{compared to the}} effect of stimulus frequency on eye movements. Fourteen healthy subjects were rotated in darkness about their longitudinal axis 10 degrees and 20 degrees off-vertical at 45 degrees /s (0. 125 Hz) and 20 degrees off-vertical at 180 degrees /s (0. 5 Hz). Perceived motion was evaluated using verbal reports and a joystick capable of recording tilt and translation in both sagittal and lateral planes. Eye movements were also recorded using videography. At the lower frequency, subjects reported the perception of progressing along the edge of a cone, whereas at the higher frequency they had the sensation of progressing along the edge of an upright cylinder. Tilt perception and ocular torsion significantly increased as the tilt angle increased from 10 degrees to 20 degrees at the lower frequency, and then decreased at the higher frequency. The phase lag of ocular torsion increased as a function of frequency, while the phase lag of tilt perception did not change. Horizontal eye movements were small at the lower frequency and showed a phase lead relative to the linear acceleration stimulus. While the phase lead of horizontal eye movements decreased at 0. 5 Hz, the phase of translation perception did not vary with stimulus frequency and was similar to the phase of tilt perception during all conditions. A second data set was obtained in 12 subjects to compare motion perception phase when using a simple push-button to indicate nose-up orientation, continuous setting of pitch tilt alone, or continuous setting of tilt and translation in both pitch and roll planes as in the first data set. This set of measurements indicated that in the frequency range studied subjects tend to lead the stimulus when using a push-button <b>task</b> while <b>lagging</b> the stimulus when using a continuous setting of tilt with a joystick. Both amplitude and phase of tilt perception using the joystick were not different whether concentrating on pitch tilt alone or attempting a more complex reporting of tilt and translation in both sagittal and lateral planes. During dynamic linear stimuli in the absence of canal and visual input, a change in stimulus frequency alone elicits similar changes in the amplitude of both self-motion perception and eye movements. However, in contrast to the eye movements, the phase of both perceived tilt and translation motion is not altered by stimulus frequency over this limited range. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that neural processing to distinguish tilt and translation stimuli differs between eye movements and motion perception...|$|R
40|$|The {{widespread}} {{introduction of}} new types of computing devices, such as smartphones, tablet computers, large interactive displays or even wearable devices, has led to setups in which users are interacting with a rich ecology of devices. These new device ecologies {{have the potential to}} introduce {{a whole new set of}} cross-device and cross-user interactions as well as to support seamless distributed workspaces that facilitate coordination and communication with other users. Because of the distributed nature of this paradigm, there is an intrinsic difficulty and overhead in managing and using these kind of complex device ecologies, which I refer to as configuration work. It is the effort required to set up, manage, communicate, understand and use information, applications and services that are distributed over all devices in use and people involved. Because current devices and their containing software are still document- and application-centric, they fail to capture and support the rich activities and context in which they are being used. This leaves users without a stable concept for cross-device information management, forcing them to perform a large amount of manual configuration work. In this dissertation, I explore an activity-centric approach to configuration work in distributed interaction. The central goal of this dissertation is to develop and apply concepts and ideas from Activity-Centric Computing to distributed interaction. Using the triangulation approach, I explore these concepts on a conceptual, empirical and technological level and present a framework and use cases for designing activitycentric configurations in multi-device information systems. The dissertation presents two major contributions: First, I introduce the term configuration work as an abstract analytical unit that describes and captures the problems and challenges of distributed interaction. Using both empirical data and related work, I argue that configuration work is composed of: curation work, <b>task</b> resumption <b>lag,</b> mobility work, physical handling and articulation work. Using configuration work as a problem description, I operationalize Activity Theory and Activity-Centric Computing to mitigate and reduce configuration work in distributed interaction. By allowing users to interact with computational representations of their real-world activities, creating complex multi-user device ecologies and switching between cross-device information configurations will be more efficient, more effective and provide better support for users’ mental model about a multi-user and multi-device environment. Using activity configuration as a central concept, I introduce a framework that describes how digital representations of human activity can be distributed, fragmented and used across multiple devices and users. Second, I present a technical infrastructure and four applications that apply the concepts of activity configuration. The infrastructure is a general purpose platform for the design, development and deployment of distributed activitycentric systems. The infrastructure simplifies the development of activity-centric systems as it presents complex distributed computing processes and services into high level activity system abstractions. Using this infrastructure and conceptual framework, I describe four fully working applications that explore multi-device interactions in two specific domains: office work and hospital work. The systems are evaluated and tested with end-users in a number of lab and field studies...|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} {{cognitive function}} {{in everyday life}} is {{the formation of an}} intention and the execution of this intention at an appropriate time in the future – a function also known as prospective memory. In safety-critical domains such as healthcare, failure to remember future intentions can have severe consequences. Healthcare researchers and memory researchers have recognised the prospective memory challenges that healthcare staff face, such as remembering routine tasks or resuming interrupted tasks. However, healthcare researchers have not fully considered the cognitive processes involved in prospective memory, and experimental memory researchers have not fully considered the rich and supportive environment in which healthcare staff work. This thesis combines theories about prospective memory drawn from basic research with the approach of distributed cognition to investigate the prospective memory performance of intensive care nurses. A particular focus of the thesis is the resumption of interrupted healthcare tasks. The healthcare literature on interruptions is motivated by the possibly disruptive effects of interruptions on memory, but this potential outcome has seldom been investigated directly. In a retrospective analysis of a full-scale simulation study with anaesthesiologists (Study 1), we showed that whether anesthesiologists remember or forget an interrupted blood transfusion bedside check depends on how they handle the interruption. Only anaesthesiologists who engaged fully with the interruption forgot the check. The study shows that interruptions can lead to forgetting of tasks. The results highlight the fact that interruption management needs to be considered when investigating interruptions in healthcare, a factor that we considered in Study 2. Laboratory research has shown how demanding prospective memory tasks such as resuming interrupted tasks can be. In a theoretically-motivated prospective observation using a mobile eye tracker (Study 2), we investigated which characteristics of an interruption influence the resumption lag, which is the time {{from the end of the}} interruption to the recall of the interrupted primary <b>task.</b> The resumption <b>lag</b> served as an indicator of how effortful task resumption was. Furthermore, we investigated how nurses managed prospective memory demands caused by interruptions and how interruption management affected the initial prospective memory demand. The results of a series of multiple regression models show that longer interruptions and a context change due to the interruption make the resumption of interrupted tasks more effortful. Nurses managed prospective memory demands by, for example, holding task artifacts while attending an interruption. This lowers the cognitive demands for an individual nurse because the artefact indicates the task that needs to be resumed and when. Using such ideas we extended the “individual model” of interruption and resumption processes to a “distributed model” to accommodate the behaviour we observed in the field. The next study addressed the role of external support in a controlled setting. To test the influence of the reminders, we controlled the presence and absence of reminders in different prospective memory situations (Study 3). To achieve the necessary control but still allow nurses to use their experience to manage memory demands, we used a full-scale simulator and a scenario representative of professional practice. The results showed that only reminders designed to cue a specific action, or reminders that are essential for the action, improved prospective memory performance. In addition, reminders affected prospective memory processes and strategies for managing prospective memory demands. The final study of the thesis was designed to apply the knowledge gained by implementing a cognitive aid to help nurses remember intentions (Study 4). We tested whether introducing an emergency equipment drawer divider with pictorial representations of emergency equipment items at the appropriate locations would increase how completely the drawers would be stocked. The introduction of the divider resulted in a small but significant increase in equipment completeness, it increased the standardisation between different patient bays, and it eased the safety check for staff with less local intensive care experience. In summary, this research program presents a first step towards investigating prospective memory demands in critical care settings using different methods. The results indicate factors that impede or support remembering of future intentions and highlight how nurses distribute and manage prospective memory challenges. The approach of a distributed prospective memory was suggested for studying and improving prospective memory performance in complex socio-technical domains. However, remembering future intentions in socio-technical settings such as healthcare is a complex task. Future research is discussed that could advance our understanding further, and so potentially increase patient safety...|$|R
