5|$|From 1958, the Danish {{championship}} {{was arranged}} through one calendar year, and the 1956–57 season lasted 18 months with the teams playing each other thrice for a 27 games total.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we compare <b>the</b> {{brushing}} <b>number</b> <b>of</b> a graph with <b>the</b> zero-forcing <b>number</b> <b>of</b> its line graph.

Using a similar construction, we also prove the conjecture that <b>the</b> zero-forcing <b>number</b> <b>of</b> a graph {{is no more than}} <b>the</b> zero-forcing <b>number</b> <b>of</b> its line graph; moreover we prove that <b>the</b> brushing <b>number</b> <b>of</b> a graph is no more than <b>the</b> brushing <b>number</b> <b>of</b> its line graph.

40|$|A {{method that}} {{indicates}} <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> components {{to use in}} fitting the three-mode principal components analysis (3 MPCA) model is proposed. This method, called DIFFIT, aims to find an optimal balance between the fit of solutions for the 3 MPCA model and <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> components. <b>The</b> achievement of DIFFIT is {{compared with that of}} two other methods, both based on two-way PCAs, by means of a simulation study. It was found that DIFFIT performed considerably better than the other methods in indicating <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> components. <b>The</b> 3 MPCA model can be estimated by the TUCKALS 3 algorithm, which is an alternating least squares algorithm. In a study of how sensitive TUCKALS 3 is at hitting local optima, it was found that, if <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> components are specified correctly, TUCKALS 3 never hits a local optimum. The occurrence of local optima increased as the difference between <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> underlying components and <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> components as estimated by TUCKALS 3 increased. Rationally initiated TUCKALS 3 runs hit local optima less often than randomly initiated runs...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} study the aging changes of intramitochondrial protein {{synthesis}} in mouse hepatocytes, 10 groups of aging mice, each consisting of three individuals, total 30, from fetal day 19 to postnatal year 2, were injected with 3 H-leucine, a protein precursor, sacrificed 1 h later, and the liver tissues processed for electron microscopic radioautography. On electron microscopic radioautograms obtained from each animal, <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> mitochondria, <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> labeled mitochondria, and the mitochondrial labeling index labeled with 3 H-leucine that showed protein synthesis in each hepatocyte, both mononucleate and binucleate cells, were counted and the averages in respective aging groups were compared. From the results, it was demonstrated that <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> mitochondria, <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> labeled mitochondria, and the labeling indices of intramitochondrial protein syntheses in both mononucleate and binucleate hepatocytes of mice at various ages increased due to development <b>of</b> animals. <b>The</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> mitochondria, <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> labeled mitochondria, and the labeling indices of intramitochondrial protein synthesis in binucleate hepatocytes were more than those of mononucleate hepatocytes at the same aging stages...|$|R
40|$|The {{behavior}} {{outside the}} gut of seeded Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7, naturally occurring E. coli, somatic coliphages, bacteriophages infecting O 157 :H 7, and Shiga toxin 2 (Stx 2) -encoding bacteriophages was studied {{to determine whether}} the last persist in the environment more successfully than their host bacteria. The ratios between <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> E. coli and those of the different bacteriophages were clearly lower in river water than in sewage of the area, whereas the ratios between <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> different phages were similar. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> bacteria decreased between 2 and 3 log units in in situ survival experiments performed in river water, whereas <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> phages decreased between 1 and 2 log units. Chlorination and pasteurization treatments that reduced by approximately 4 log units <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> bacteria reduced by less than 1 log unit <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> bacteriophages. Thus, it can be concluded that Stx 2 -encoding phages persist longer than their host bacteria in the water environment and are more resistant than their host bacteria to chlorination and heat treatment...|$|R
