5|$|For a fully {{secret trust}} to be valid, therefore, it must be proved that there was intention, that this was communicated to <b>the</b> <b>trustee,</b> and that <b>the</b> <b>trustee</b> {{accepted}} his obligations. Intention {{is one of the}} three certainties, and applies to {{fully secret trust}}s {{in the same way as}} it does to other express trusts.|$|E
5|$|In English law, secret trusts are a {{class of}} trust defined as an {{arrangement}} between a testator and a trustee, made to come into force after death, that aims to benefit a person without having been written in a formal will. The property is given to <b>the</b> <b>trustee</b> in the will, and he would then be expected to {{pass it on to}} the real beneficiary. For these to be valid, the person seeking to enforce the trust must prove that the testator intended to form a trust, that this intention was communicated to <b>the</b> <b>trustee,</b> and that <b>the</b> <b>trustee</b> accepted his office. There are two types of secret trust — fully secret and half-secret. A fully secret trust is one with no mention in the will whatsoever. In the case of a half-secret trust, the face of the will names <b>the</b> <b>trustee</b> as trustee, but does not give the trust's terms, including the beneficiary. The most important difference lies in communication of the trust: the terms of a half-secret trust must be communicated to <b>the</b> <b>trustee</b> before the execution of the will, whereas {{in the case of a}} fully secret trust the terms may be communicated after the execution of the will, as long as this is before the testator's death.|$|E
5|$|Acceptance, therefore, can {{be communicated}} {{in one of}} two ways; either by <b>the</b> <b>trustee</b> {{directly}} stating his acceptance, or by implying it through not declining.|$|E

5|$|As such, such trusts are not {{enforceable}} {{because they}} are invalid. Equity {{has been willing to}} accept their validity in the common law to prevent <b>the</b> <b>trustee</b> committing fraud and keeping the property; justifications for this acceptance are debated.|$|E

5|$|In 2013, Corzine, and {{managers}} including Bradley Abelow and Henri Steenkamp, appealed a court ruling relating to repayments to customers of the bankrupt brokerage. A spokesman for Mr. Corzine {{made clear that}} the appeal was not an attempt to delay payments to customers, but due to a disagreement regarding how those claims would be handled by <b>the</b> <b>trustee</b> after they were paid. Mr. Corzine fully supported customers receiving 100 percent of their money and had no desire for this to be delayed. There was nothing preventing <b>the</b> <b>trustee</b> from making full distributions immediately and litigating the appeal after the fact. Ultimately all customers were paid in full.|$|E
5|$|A {{secret trust}} is an {{arrangement}} between a testator and a trustee to benefit a person {{without having to}} specify that person in a will. <b>The</b> <b>trustee</b> is transferred property {{under the terms of}} the will which he or she then holds on trust for others.|$|E
5|$|Alastair Hudson {{has also}} argued that the fraud {{argument}} is significantly flawed. The theory suggests that liability for the property comes about from fraud; in fact, liability comes about as soon as <b>the</b> <b>trustee</b> accepts the property to hold on trust, and so the fraud theory {{is not necessary to}} bind the trustee's hands.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Trustees</b> of <b>the</b> Baltimore City College Scholarship Funds, Inc., was {{established}} and incorporated in 1983, and replaced a similar entity that {{was established}} in 1924. <b>The</b> <b>Trustees</b> manage endowments, most of which provide annual scholarships to graduating seniors based on criteria stipulated by the donors. Combined endowment assets are currently valued at or around $1.68 million (adjusted for inflation) covering thirty-four annual scholarships. To recognize the custodianship provided by <b>the</b> <b>Trustees,</b> <b>the</b> BCCAA has placed a bronze plaque in the main hall of the school which carries an individually cast nameplate {{for each of the}} thirty-four permanent endowments held by <b>the</b> <b>Trustees.</b>|$|R

50|$|The dispute, {{brought forward}} in a suit by former LC faculty members, {{centered}} upon the election process used by <b>the</b> <b>trustees.</b> LC by-laws provided that a committee was to be appointed to review candidates {{and to make a}} recommendation to <b>the</b> <b>trustees.</b> <b>The</b> committee recommended Malcolm Beryl Yarnell, III, of the Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Fort Worth, who subsequently received an offer from the college. Yarnell and <b>the</b> <b>trustees</b> never reached an agreement on contract terms. As a result, <b>the</b> <b>trustees</b> expanded <b>the</b> selection committee from nine to seventeen members.|$|R

5|$|A {{statement}} in the House of Lords on 13 May 1959 promised further reform, and a detailed White Paper was published in December.

5|$|Mountbatten {{stressed}} {{that he would}} act as <b>the</b> <b>trustee</b> of the princes' commitment, as he would be serving as India's head of state well into 1948. He engaged in a personal dialogue with reluctant princes, such as the Nawab of Bhopal, who he asked through a confidential letter to sign the Instrument of Accession making Bhopal part of India, which Mountbatten would keep locked up in his safe. It would be handed to the States Department on 15 August only if the Nawab did not change his mind before then, which {{he was free to}} do. The Nawab agreed, and did not renege over the deal.|$|E
5|$|Part IV {{of the act}} {{covers the}} {{delegation}} of powers to agents, and the trustees liability for their acts. This {{is an area that}} has long been criticised by practitioners and academics, particularly the provisions of <b>the</b> <b>Trustee</b> Act 1925. The Act allowed the trustees to appoint an agent in good faith, and gave them no liability for the agent's acts. In Re Vickery it was confirmed that a trustee may escape liability for an agent's acts if he acted in good faith, which was simply a test of honesty rather than reasonableness.|$|E
5|$|Rules on the {{acquisition}} of land are covered in Part III of the Act. Until {{the passage of the}} Act, trustees had no right to purchase land with trust money, with two exceptions; first, if the trust instrument authorised or required <b>the</b> <b>trustee</b> to purchase land and second, Section 6(4) of the Trusts of Land and Appointment of Trustees Act 1996, which allowed trustees to buy land either as an investment or for habitation by the beneficiaries.|$|E

5|$|The courts {{recognise}} {{two forms}} of secret trust. Fully secret trusts are trusts not referred to {{at all on the}} face of the will. Instead, an agreement made between the testator and trustees elsewhere. <b>The</b> <b>trustee</b> will instead be named only a beneficiary. In the case of a half-secret trust, the fact that the beneficiary holds as trustee only is declared {{on the face of the}} will, but not the other terms of the trust.|$|E
5|$|In February 1931, {{the woods}} were {{included}} in a sale by King's College to the urban district council. Park Wood was sold for £28,100, with Manor Farm and the old Post Office included {{as a gift to}} the people of Ruislip. King's had also wished to present the wood as a gift but was required by the University and College's Act to receive payment as it was <b>the</b> <b>trustee</b> of the land. Middlesex County Council contributed 75% of the cost, as the urban district council argued that many of those who would make use of the land would be recreational day-trippers from outside the district. Under a 999-year lease, the council agreed to maintain the wood and ensure no new building was constructed without the permission of the county council. An area of the wood to the south {{was not included in the}} lease agreement and three residential roads were later constructed on it.|$|E
5|$|Manor Farm and {{the local}} woods {{eventually}} avoided demolition in January 1930, after the visit {{by a member of}} the Royal Society of Arts to choose the buildings that should be conserved. The Great Barn and Little Barn were singled out from the site, together with the old post office, the Old Bell public house and the Priest's House of the local church. The woods were included in a sale by King's College to the district in February 1931.

50|$|When {{the modern}} University of South Carolina was formed from South Carolina College in December 1865, the act doing so also {{authorized}} <b>the</b> <b>trustees</b> to hire {{one or more}} persons to form classes to instruct on the law under such terms as <b>the</b> <b>trustees</b> should decide.
