5|$|Rakeysh Mehra took {{seven years}} to {{research}} and develop the story, including three to write the script. While some raised doubts about his morale following the failure of his last film, Aks, at the box office, he retorted by saying {{that it would not}} affect him at all. He added <b>that</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>did</b> his storytelling technique improve, but past mistakes had helped him improve his filmmaking abilities.|$|E
5|$|The team {{is called}} {{to the home of}} a man whose heart was removed through a {{makeshift}} operation. They learn <b>that</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>did</b> someone call for emergency help shortly after the heart's removal, but the man was found alive by the emergency response team well after his heart was removed, though he eventually died by the time Fringe arrived. Walter (John Noble) and Peter recognize scars on the blood vessels leading to the heart, identifying the victim as one that received a heart transplant. During the autopsy at the lab, Walter concludes that a serum was used to prolong the victim's life well after the heart's removal, a chemical based on his own past research into life restoration.|$|E

25|$|Between the 16th and 17th centuries {{there are}} at least forty extant sources which {{provided}} evidence <b>that,</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>did</b> monks of Shaolin practice martial arts, but martial practice had become such an integral element of Shaolin monastic life that the monks felt the need to justify it by creating new Buddhist lore.|$|E
25|$|The {{ruling by}} Justice Isaac Parker, who {{happened}} to be a Unitarian, determined <b>that</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>did</b> the separating church lose its claim on the church property, but it also lost its status as an established church. As congregations continued to defect to Unitarianism, the Dedham case increased conservative support for disestablishment. In 1833, the state constitution was amended to eliminate church taxes.|$|E
25|$|In 2001 the European Court of Human Rights {{ruled that}} ten IRA members, {{including}} the eight killed at Loughgall, had their human rights violated {{by the failure}} of the British Government to conduct a proper investigation into their deaths. The court did not make any finding that these deaths amounted to unlawful killing. In December 2011, Northern Ireland's Historical Enquiries Team found <b>that</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>did</b> the IRA team fire first but that they could not have been safely arrested. They concluded that the SAS were justified in opening fire.|$|E
5000|$|Such is {{the warmth}} of the women’s welcome <b>that</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>do</b> the Spaniards refrain from misbehaviour, but on their {{departure}} the Duke announces a year’s remission of taxes for the town.|$|R
2500|$|Aquinas held <b>that</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>does</b> God have {{knowledge}} of everything, but that God has [...] "the most perfect knowledge," [...] {{and that it}} is also true to say that God [...] "is" [...] his understanding.|$|R
50|$|This means <b>that</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>does</b> {{a country}} <b>not</b> need to limit exports, but also need not limit imports, {{because the money}} flowing out of the economy will create more demand for money, helping bring it back in.|$|R
25|$|As {{the wedding}} approached, R.A. Kartini's {{attitude}} towards Javanese traditional customs began to change. She became more tolerant. She {{began to feel}} that her marriage would bring good fortune for her ambition to develop a school for native women. In her letters, she mentioned <b>that</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>did</b> her esteemed husband support her desire to develop the woodcarving industry in Jepara and the school for native women, but she also mentioned {{that she was going}} to write a book. Sadly, this ambition was unrealized as a result of her premature death in 1904 at the age of only 25.|$|E
25|$|Oil {{paintings}} initially {{became a}} popular method for producing altarpieces and soon replaced tempera for this purpose. The {{ease with which}} large paintings could be created meant <b>that</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>did</b> very large altar paintings proliferate, taking the place of polyptychs made of small panels, but because they were of relatively light weight, such pictures could be used on ceilings, by setting them into wooden frames and without the trouble of the artist having to work laboriously on a scaffold. Famous Venetian painters, Titian, Tintoretto and Veronese produced many such pictures. Peter Paul Rubens painted a Passion of Christ {{in a number of}} large canvases.|$|E
25|$|Laxalt {{retired from}} the Senate in 1987 and was {{replaced}} by the man he had defeated in 1974, Harry Reid, who would go on to become the Senate Majority Leader. Laxalt made a brief run for the Republican Presidential nomination during 1987. The campaign lasted only four months after Laxalt determined that the effort had fallen short of its fundraising goals. Political commentators at the time concluded that he had waited too long to enter the race, which meant <b>that</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>did</b> his competitors have a leg up in organization, but many of the top political strategists and fundraisers had already signed on with other camps. He was eventually named a co-chairman of George H.W. Bush's successful presidential campaign. Eight years later, he served in a similar capacity in Bob Dole's failed presidential bid.|$|E

25|$|Rather than {{ending with}} the {{conviction}} and sentencing to prison of the five Watergate burglars on January 30, 1973, {{the investigation into the}} break-in and the Nixon Administration's involvement grew broader. Nixon's conversations in late March and all of April 1973 revealed <b>that</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>did</b> he know he needed to remove Haldeman, Ehrlichman, and Dean to gain distance from them, but he had to do so {{in a way that was}} least likely to incriminate him and his presidency. Nixon created a new conspiracy—to effect a cover-up of the cover-up—which began in late March 1973 and became fully formed in May and June 1973, operating until his presidency ended on August 9, 1974. On March 23, 1973, Judge Sirica read the court a letter from Watergate burglar James McCord, who alleged that perjury had been committed in the Watergate trial, and defendants had been pressured to remain silent. Trying to make them talk, Sirica gave Hunt and two burglars provisional sentences of up to 40 years.|$|E
25|$|The {{outbreak}} {{of war with}} Prussia on 15 July 1870 led to a chaotic mobilization of the French Army. The mitrailleuse batteries faced particularly acute problems. Although on paper they had been organized into proper batteries, at the {{outbreak of}} war the guns were still in storage at Meudon and in the forts of Montrouge, Issy, and Mont-Valerien around Paris. The crews had been designated but {{had not yet been}} assembled. Many had little or no training {{in the use of the}} weapons and so were unaware of its sighting and ranging characteristics. Detailed instruction manuals had been printed in January 1870, but had only been distributed at the very beginning of the hostilities. Such was the secrecy surrounding the weapon <b>that</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>did</b> few artillery commanders know how to deploy it effectively, many did not even know that it existed. Marshal MacMahon, commander of the Army of Châlons, claimed that he had never even seen a mitrailleuse until one was wheeled past him at the Battle of Sedan on 2 September 1870, nearly two months after war had been declared.|$|E
25|$|In April 1877, Lee {{filed suit}} in Alexandria County circuit court to eject the U.S. {{government}} from Arlington. His suit named, among others, Frederick Kaufman (a civilian in the United States Department of War who oversaw Arlington National Cemetery) and R.P. Strong (a U.S. Army officer who supervised the portion of Arlington which had become an Army post). Almost a thousand others were named in the suit, all of them former African American slaves who {{had been allowed to}} form a settlement known as Freedmen's Village on part of the estate. On July 6, United States Attorney General Charles Devens filed a writ of certiorari asking that the case be transferred to the United States Circuit Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, a request which the federal court approved three days later. On July 16, Devens filed a motion to have Lee's suit dismissed {{on the grounds that the}} Constitution made the federal government immune to suits at law (unless it gave its consent). Lee filed a demurrer, pointing out that the government had taken the contradictory position of being a private buyer in a tax sale and yet asserting sovereign immunity as if its purchase were a governmental act. On March 15, 1878, the circuit court held <b>that</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>did</b> the court have jurisdiction to decide the issue but that the lawsuit presented a controversy over facts which should be decided by a jury. A jury trial was held January 24–30, 1879, in Alexandria. The jury found for Lee, concluding that the demand to accept payment only in person violated the Constitution's due process guarantees.|$|E

500|$|Kroyanker contends <b>that</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>did</b> the Clal Center fail {{to revitalize}} Jaffa Road, it [...] "actually {{accelerated}} its degeneration". In particular, {{he points to}} the lack of anchor stores, the lack of continuity of small businesses, and the cessation of activity in the stores and banks in the Clal Center in the early afternoon for making the project [...] "a typical Jerusalem commercial failure".|$|E

[...] He noted that ABC had encouraged the NCAA to seek an exemption from antitrust laws from Congress, but that the NCAA did not believe that they could obtain the exemption.|$|E

He also praised the plotlines, writing that [...] "what made this episode so great was <b>that</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>did</b> every plot line work ... but every moment positively sang". He gave the episode five stars, concluding that [...] "The Office still has some surprises in it".|$|E

500|$|Seward's reputation, {{controversial}} in life, remained so in death, dividing his contemporaries. Former Navy Secretary Gideon Welles argued <b>that</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>did</b> Seward lack principles, Gideon {{was unable to}} understand how Seward had fooled Lincoln into thinking that he did, gaining entry to the Cabinet thereby. Charles Francis Adams, minister in London during Seward's tenure as secretary, deemed him [...] "more of a politician than a statesman", but Charles Anderson Dana, former Assistant Secretary of War, disagreed, writing that Seward had [...] "the most cultivated and comprehensive intellect in the administration" [...] and [...] "what is very rare in a lawyer, a politician, or a statesman—imagination".|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after the}} appeal was dismissed, Williams {{received}} a letter from [...] "Freddy Mike", who stated <b>that</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>did</b> he know the real murderer, but that the murderer was his twin brother who had killed the police inspector before fleeing to France. Williams immediately showed the letter to his solicitor, who contacted Scotland Yard. Accompanied by Chief Inspector Bower, Williams' solicitor visited Freddy Mike, who again told the same story. A copy of the letter was sent to the Home Secretary, Reginald McKenna, along with a statement by Florence Seymour in which she claimed that her confession had been given after threats by the police.|$|E
500|$|Animaniacs parodied popular TV {{shows and}} movies and caricatured celebrities. Animaniacs {{made fun of}} celebrities, major motion pictures, {{television}} shows for adults (Seinfeld and Friends, among others), television shows for children, and trends in the US. One episode even made fun of competing show Power Rangers, and another episode caricatured Animaniacs own Internet fans. Animaniacs also made potshots of Disney films, creating parodies of such films as The Lion King, Beauty and the Beast, Pocahontas, Bambi, and others. Animaniacs director Russell Calabrese said <b>that</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>did</b> it become a compliment to be parodied on Animaniacs but also that being parodied on the series would {{be taken as a}} [...] "badge of honor".|$|E
