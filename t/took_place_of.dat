5|$|Corgis {{have also}} {{appeared}} on screen, stage and in novels. Corgis as characters {{were incorporated into}} the storybook fantasies Corgiville Fair, The Great Corgiville Kidnapping, and Corgiville Christmas of American author and illustrator Tasha Tudor. In 1961, a Corgi was featured in the Walt Disney film Little Dog Lost, which led {{to an increase in}} popularity for the breed within the United States. A theatrical adaptation <b>took</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> Welsh author Roald Dahl's The BFG which toured the UK in 1991 required several different Corgis to perform on stage as those of Queen Elizabeth.|$|E
5|$|In 1793, {{following}} {{a survey of}} coastal defences in the southeast, approval was given for the positioning of infantry and artillery to defend the bay between Beachy Head and Hastings from attack by the French. Fourteen Martello Towers were constructed along the western shore of Pevensey Bay, continuing as far as Tower73, the Wish Tower at Eastbourne. Several of these towers survive: the Wish Tower is an important feature of the town's seafront and {{was the subject of}} a painting by James Sant RA, and part of Tower68 forms the basement of a house on St.Antony's Hill. Between 1805 and 1807, the construction <b>took</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> a fortress known as the Eastbourne Redoubt, which was built as a barracks and storage depot, and armed with 10cannons.|$|E
5|$|In the 1940s, as the Indian {{independence}} movement intensified, an upsurge of Muslim nationalism helmed by the All-India Muslim League <b>took</b> <b>place,</b> <b>of</b> which Muhammad Ali Jinnah {{was the most}} prominent leader. Being a political party to secure {{the interests of the}} Muslim diaspora in British India, the Muslim League played a decisive role during the 1940s in the Indian {{independence movement}} and developed into {{the driving force behind the}} creation of Pakistan as a Muslim state in South Asia. During a three-day general session of All-India Muslim League from 22–24 March 1940, a formal political statement was presented, known as the Lahore Resolution, which called on for the creation of an independent state for Muslims. In 1956, 23 March also became the date on which Pakistan transitioned from a dominion to a republic, and is known as Pakistan Day.|$|E

25|$|In 1864 {{until the}} early 20th century, another mass {{expulsion}} <b>took</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> Caucasian Muslims {{as a result of}} the Russian victory in the Caucasian War. Others simply voluntarily refused to live under Christian Russian rule, and thus disembarked for Turkey or Iran. These migrations once again, towards Iran, included masses of Caucasian Azerbaijanis, other Transcaucasian Muslims, as well as many North Caucasian Muslims, such as Circassians, Shia Lezgins and Laks.|$|E
25|$|During {{construction}} of a level crossing at Smørstein on 17 August 1918 {{the area around the}} track started experiencing a series of landslides. Within a few days the earthwork under the tracks had slid away. NSB hired a steamship to freight passengers and cargo past the effected area, and part of the traffic was freighted across the fjord from Horten to Moss. A temporary line was built close to the mountain, while construction <b>took</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> a temporary solution, the Smørstein Tunnel. The temporary line opened on 28 October 1918 and the new segment with a tunnel on 25 May 1921.|$|E

25|$|Also in 1949, {{the first}} running <b>took</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> {{what was to}} become an {{institution}} at Silverstone, the International Trophy sponsored by the Daily Express and which become virtually a second Grand Prix. The first International Trophy was run on 20 August in two heats and a final. Victory in heat one went to Prince Birabongse ('Bira') and the second to Giuseppe Farina – both driving Maserati 4CLT/48s, but the final went to a Ferrari Tipo 125 driven by Alberto Ascari from Farina, with Luigi Villoresi third in another Ferrari. For this meeting, the chicane at Club Corner was dispensed with and the circuit took up a shape that was to last for 25 years.|$|E
25|$|Although {{limited in}} numbers and quality, airpower {{proved to be}} one of the {{greatest}} assets that the British possessed during this conflict. Not only did it allow them to extend their reach beyond the border and bomb Kabul, but it also enabled them to harass the retreating enemy and to break up tribesmen as they attempted to form larger groups prior to launching an attack. The ability of the British to project airpower, even small scale raids, had considerable psychological effects. For example, the single-plane raid on the palace which <b>took</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> 24 May 1919, although effecting little actual damage nevertheless greatly impacted the morale of Afghan citizens and contributed to bringing King Amanullah to request an armistice.|$|E
25|$|In December 1947, Eagle Farm {{was in the}} {{possession}} of the Department of Civil Aviation. Originally, the land had been acquired in the Department's name, but further areas were acquired through funds by the Department of Air. In April 1948, through the Commonwealth Disposals Commission, the Department of Civil Aviation took control of various assets erected for the RAAF at Eagle Farm from the Department of Air. In May 1949, the transfer <b>took</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> buildings, contents, equipment and services from the Commonwealth to the Department of Civil Aviation for £301,318. Hangar 7 was described as being 104x240 ft with frame timber trusses, weatherboard end walls, 23 pairs of eight pane clear glass casements, and 72 reinforced obscure glass skylights.|$|E

25|$|Dwyer {{played his}} three matches for NSW {{sporadically}} {{between the end}} of the First World War and the year of the Wall Street Crash. His first match <b>took</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> 26 December 1918 against Victoria at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Winning the toss, NSW inserted Victoria in to bat, and dismissed them for 266, largely composed of a century by Frederick Baring. Dwyer, at number two, formed an opening partnership of 26 with Australian international Warren Bardsley before the latter fell lbw to Baring for 18 and Dwyer was dismissed by international Edgar McDonald. NSW fell to 123 all out, and were unable to stop Victoria from reaching 299 all out in their second innings, thanks to a century by Edgar Mayne. NSW notched up 226 in reply, Dwyer falling again to McDonald for nine.|$|E
25|$|On 12 October 1937, {{the maiden}} flight <b>took</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> the first {{production}} Hurricane I, which was {{powered by a}} Merlin II engine and flown by Flight Lieutenant Philip Lucas. Production deliveries had been delayed by roughly six months due to a decision to equip the Hurricane only with the improved Merlin II engine, while the earlier Merlin I had been prioritised for the Fairey Battle and the Hawker Henley. By the following December, the first four aircraft to enter service with the RAF had joined No. 111 Squadron, stationed at RAF Northolt. By February 1938, No. 111 Squadron had received 16 Hurricanes. Upon {{the outbreak of the}} Second World War, nearly 500 Hurricanes had been produced, which had equipped a total of 18 squadrons, while a further 3,500 aircraft were on order.|$|E
25|$|The {{present state}} of Chhattisgarh was carved out of Madhya Pradesh on 1 November 2000. The demand for a {{separate}} state was first raised in the 1920s. Similar demands kept cropping up at regular intervals; however, a well-organised movement was never launched. Several all-party platforms were formed and they usually resolved around petitions, public meetings, seminars, rallies and strikes. A demand for separate Chhattisgarh was raised in 1924 by the Raipur Congress unit and also discussed in the Annual Session of the Indian Congress at Tripuri. A discussion also <b>took</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> forming a Regional Congress organisation for Chhattisgarh. When the State Reorganisation Commission {{was set up in}} 1954, the demand for a separate Chhattisgarh was put forward, but was not accepted. In 1955, a demand for a separate state was raised in the Nagpur assembly of the then state of Madhya Bharat.|$|E

25|$|The giant {{trevally}} {{has been}} used by humans since prehistoric times, with the oldest known records of the capture of this species by Hawaiians, whose culture held the fish in high regard. The ulua, as the fish is known to Hawaiians, was likened to a fine man and strong warrior, which was the cause of a ban on women eating the species in antiquity. The species was often used in Hawaiian religious rites, and <b>took</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> a human sacrifice when none was available. Culturally, the fish was seen as a god, and treated as gamefish which commoners could not hunt. There are many mentions of ulua in Hawaiian proverbs, all generally relating to the strength and warrior-like qualities of the fish. The Hawaiians considered the fish to be of excellent quality, with white, firm flesh. Despite this, intrusions of giant trevally into modern-day fishponds used by Hawaiians for rearing fish are unwelcome; being a predator, it eats more than it is worth at market.|$|E

Davis and his squadron were relocated to Kimpo Airfield to allow them the best access to [...] "MiG Alley" [...] in North Korea, where much of the air-to-air combat <b>took</b> <b>place.</b> <b>Of</b> his leadership, subordinates often praised the quality of his training; Davis {{spent a great deal of}} time training new and younger pilots in tactics during his command.

2500|$|Public {{memory of}} the Tiananmen Square protests has been {{suppressed}} by the authorities since 1989.

Currently, many Chinese citizens are reluctant to speak about the protests because of potential repercussions. Rob Gifford held that many young people born after 1980 are unfamiliar with the events and are apathetic about politics while some older intellectuals no longer aspire for political change and instead focus on economic issues.

It was not recognized in the Tulsa Tribune feature of [...] "Fifteen Years Ago Today" [...] or [...] "Twenty-five Years Ago Today". A number of people tried to document the events, gather photographs, and record {{the name of the}} dead and injured. Mary E. Jones Parrish, a young black teacher and journalist from Rochester, New York, was hired by the Inter-racial Commission to write an account of the riot. She was herself a survivor, and wrote about her experiences, as well as collecting other accounts, gathering photographs, and compiling [...] "a partial roster of property losses in the African American community". She published this in Events of the Tulsa Disaster (1922; reprinted 1992 and 1998). It was the first book to be published about the riot.|$|E
2500|$|BBC1 was relaunched on 18 February 1985 {{with a new}} look, new {{programming}} including Wogan, EastEnders and {{a revised}} schedule to help streamline and maintain viewers {{throughout the course of}} the evening. Grade started to gear most programmes to either on the hour or half past the hour, while Panorama and Omnibus were both moved after the Nine O'Clock News. Grade was also determined to end the dated and inept BBC1 scheduling which was hampering the network and which was holding back good programmes. Grade stated [...] "When I took over BBC1, I discovered there were wonderful things, it was just a case of where to put them." [...] Wogan had been scheduled for a 10pm slot, but Grade moved it to a 7pm slot as he believed the show had potential. From February to August 1985, a high amount of American mini series were broadcast while filming <b>took</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> a number of new home grown programmes, including 'Allo 'Allo!, In Sickness and in Health, and Open All Hours. Further improvement come about when the corporation strengthened its drama output costing £30 million, with eight new series, including Howards' Way, All Creatures Great and Small, Hold the Back Page, and Bluebill, along with the return of Bergerac and Big Deal. The increase in the drama department was achieved by switching the money away from the administrative service over a three-year period, after BBC1 was criticised, for failing in matching ITV's output in drama. EastEnders was moved to a 19:30 slot, where it managed to soar to 20 million, helping the BBC1 audience share increase to nearly 50% {{for the first time since}} 1982.|$|E
