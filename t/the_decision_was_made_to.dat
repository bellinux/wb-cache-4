5|$|Although the Skyraider {{was a third}} {{smaller and}} carried a third less bombload, it proved more {{reliable}} in service and easier to fly and land, and Navy pilots preferred it. In 1950 <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> use the Mauler only from shore-based units and later that year all but Naval Reserve units abandoned the type. The aircraft operated with reserve squadrons until 1953.|$|E
5|$|At {{the outset}} of the Second World War, due to the {{provisions}} of the Defence Act (1903) which prohibited sending the Militia to fight outside of Australian territory, <b>The</b> <b>decision</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> raise an all volunteer force to serve overseas—initial operations were conceived to be likely in the Middle East, France and later possibly England—while it was decided that the Militia would be used to defend the Australian mainland and to improve Australia's overall level of readiness through the reinstitution of compulsory military service and extended periods of continuous periods of training. During this time the 6th Battalion was called up for a number of periods of continuous service in order to bolster their readiness and undertook garrison duties in Australia. In 1944, however, <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> disband the unit, as the Australian government sought to reallocate resources to the economy and began the demobilisation process early. Later, in January 1945, the battalion's parent unit, the 2nd Brigade was also disbanded.|$|E

No.1 IFTS was disbanded on 24January 1955, and its base facilities handed over to No.23 Squadron.|$|E

At a further meeting on 23 May, Tizard, perhaps prompted by comments from Director of Signals (Air), suggested that the units were not suitable for operational use, especially due to low reliability, and should be confined to daylight training missions.|$|E

5|$|Before {{becoming}} a specialist school, Chetham's {{had a good}} reputation for music, and on this basis <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> become a co-educational music school in 1969.

In 1969, 50 students were admitted based on musical potential and by 1972 this had risen to 150, {{more than half of}} the entire school. In 1977 the school changed to its present name. In 1978 the Long Millgate building, the original home of Manchester Grammar School, was purchased to provide additional space.|$|E

Two Defiant units did switch to the Mk. VI, but they operated for only about four months before converting to the Mosquito. Production for the AI role ended, and the electronics were converted to Monica tail warning radars for the bomber force, until the mid-1944 knowledge of the Germans' Flensburg radar detector, which spotted Monica transmissions, was revealed to the British.|$|E
5|$|Despite the battalion's {{success in}} holding the {{trenches}} at Lone Pine, the August Offensive failed {{to break the}} deadlock as setbacks elsewhere resulted in continued stalemate {{and for the rest}} of the campaign the fighting was relatively static.

During the evacuation, two of the battalion's soldiers, William Scurry and Alfred 'Buntie' Lawrence played a significant part through their invention of a self-firing rifle, which assisted in making the Turks believe that there were still men manning the trenches even as they were being evacuated.|$|E
5|$|Following Japan's {{entry into}} the war, <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> {{transfer}} {{a large number of}} Australian troops from the Middle East to the Pacific region. In early 1942, as the Japanese advanced through the Netherlands East Indies, the majority of the battalion was captured during the Battle of Java. A small number of the battalion's personnel returned to Australia and it was subsequently re-raised in mid-1942. It was later attached to the 6th Division as a corps unit and served in Papua New Guinea during the Aitape–Wewak campaign in 1944–1945. The battalion was disbanded in January 1946.|$|E

Around this time the decision to raise a fifth division from fresh volunteers in Australia was also made and as a result the 3rd Division was officially raised on 2 February 1916.|$|E
