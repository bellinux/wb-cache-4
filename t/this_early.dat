5|$|A {{number of}} Holden's early designs were for hospitals, which Adams' {{practice}} specialised in. At <b>this</b> <b>early</b> stage in his career, he produced designs {{in a variety}} of architectural styles as circumstances required, reflecting the influences of a number of architects. Holden soon took charge of most of the practice's design work. From 1900 to 1903, Holden studied architecture in the evenings at the Royal Academy School. He also continued to produce designs in his spare time for his brother-in-law and Jonathan Simpson.|$|E
5|$|Alfred Hitchcock's cameo is a {{signature}} occurrence {{in most of}} his films. In Psycho, he can be seen through a window—wearing a Stetson hat—standing outside Marion Crane's office. Wardrobe mistress Rita Riggs has said that Hitchcock chose this scene for his cameo {{so that he could}} be in a scene with his daughter (who played one of Marion's colleagues). Others have suggested that he chose <b>this</b> <b>early</b> appearance in the film in order to avoid distracting the audience.|$|E
5|$|As can be {{seen from}} the above, in <b>this</b> <b>early</b> reference, no mention is made of live animals as co-inhabitants within the sack, nor is the mention of any initial {{whipping}} contained, nor that Malleolus, contained within the sack, was transported to the river in a cart driven by black oxen.|$|E

5|$|Bach {{performed}} the cantata again while Thomaskantor in Leipzig, notably {{at his first}} Easter there on 9 April 1724. He also performed it the following year on 1 April 1725, in his second cycle of Leipzig cantatas, a cycle of chorale cantatas based on Lutheran hymns. It followed in the cycle some forty newly composed cantatas. <b>This</b> <b>early</b> work fits the cycle {{in the sense that}} it is based on a chorale, but its style is different from the others.|$|E

She finds Bart has a picture of himself that was to be a Christmas present for her. Marge is overjoyed, and in gratitude for receiving <b>this</b> <b>early</b> Christmas gift. She gives Bart his present, the golf simulator video game Lee Carvallo's Putting Challenge. Though profoundly underwhelmed, Bart thanks her.|$|E

5|$|Edward Epstein {{recognized}} in 1969 that the atmosphere {{could not be}} completely described with a single forecast run due to inherent uncertainty, and proposed using an ensemble of stochastic Monte Carlo simulations to produce means and variances {{for the state of}} the atmosphere. Although <b>this</b> <b>early</b> example of an ensemble showed skill, in 1974 Cecil Leith showed that they produced adequate forecasts only when the ensemble probability distribution was a representative sample of the probability distribution in the atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|In the Tokyo Woman's Christian College, {{commenced}} in 1924, Raymond's architecture {{can be seen}} {{to still}} be heavily influenced by Wright. Its low, hipped roof and overhanging eaves are reminiscent of Wright's Prairie Houses. <b>This</b> <b>early</b> work also demonstrates his interest in Czech Cubism and the work of Auguste Perret.|$|E
5|$|In {{the initial}} years {{following}} Anarky's creation, Grant rarely incorporated the character into Batman stories, being reserved for stories {{in which the}} author wished to make a philosophical point. Originally, Grant created Anarky as an anarchist with socialist and populist leanings. In <b>this</b> <b>early</b> incarnation, Anarky was designed as an avatar for Grant's personal meditations on political philosophy, and specifically for his burgeoning sympathy for anarchism.|$|E

The Moray rulers MacBeth (1040–1057) and his successor Lulach (1057–1058) became rulers of the entire Scottish kingdom for a time. However, Moray was subjugated by the Scottish kings after 1130, when the native ruler, Óengus of Moray was killed leading a rebellion. Another revolt in 1187 was equally unsuccessful.|$|E

During <b>this</b> <b>early</b> period, he published a journal article in Nouvelles annales de mathématiques, discussing properties of the triangle.|$|E

5|$|Other {{members of}} this {{earliest}} generation of heroes such as Perseus, Deucalion, Theseus and Bellerophon, have many traits in common with Heracles. Like him, their exploits are solitary, fantastic and border on fairy tale, as they slay monsters such as the Chimera and Medusa. Bellerophon's adventures are commonplace types, similar to the adventures of Heracles and Theseus. Sending a hero to his presumed death is also a recurrent theme of <b>this</b> <b>early</b> heroic tradition, used {{in the cases of}} Perseus and Bellerophon.|$|E
5|$|Pallas {{is thought}} to have {{undergone}} at least some degree of thermal alteration and partial differentiation, which suggests that it is a remnant protoplanet. During the planetary formation stage of the Solar System, objects grew in size through an accretion process to approximately this size. Many of these objects were incorporated into larger bodies, which became the planets, whereas others were destroyed in collisions with other protoplanets. Pallas and Vesta are likely survivors from <b>this</b> <b>early</b> stage of planetary formation.|$|E
