The question of network suitability for providing various communication services has to be considered in practice, especially in case of large ships, as the content of traffic is very diverse with exceptionally variable intensity. Under such specific circumstances for ships theoretical models cannot be directly applied. Rather, network design and implementation depend on practical preliminary test results and analysis.

The analysis {{is based on}} aligning the numerical electrophoretic lane data in respect of a given distance function defined {{on a set of}} fragments, or signal peaks in general. We presume that significant dissimilarities between peaks result in extreme score values computed for aligned peak pairs. Whereas in sequence comparison, an overall sequence similarity score is conventionally used, the current method defines a special dissimilarity score for searching the peak pairs showing the largest relative differences between the lanes. The output of the analysis is a highly reduced list of peak pairs, along with a set of associated features extracted from the lanes. The idea is that only the peaks of this list need to be visually conrmed instead of the vast amount of peaks in the original electropherograms. The reduced list correlates well with the results of visual evaluation of the same electropherograms. We also demonstrate the relevance of the method in real mRNA differential display analyses when more complex expression patterns in multiple lanes are searched for. The method has potential to become a key component of a truly automated recognition tool by which one can flexibly search for interesting patterns in high <b>troughput</b> mRNA differential display...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — In a Wireless Fidelity (WiFi) network it is {{well known}} that large periods of contention, the {{intermittent}} disruptions of the service and limited bandwidth represent a handicap for interactive realtime multimedia applications since they demand high <b>troughput</b> and real time constraints, e. g. Video on Demand (VoD) or Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP). Nevertheless, it is very common to use WiFi networks as a wireless access networks for multimedia servers allocated in a wired networks (normally in the edge of the fixed kernel network). In this scenario, wireless stations wishing to access to multimedia contents must contend with wireless stations wishing to transmit less priority traffic. Despite the efforts that are being done by different task groups within 802. 11 standards to provide Quality of Service (QoS) and to increase the physical data rate, admission control becomes very important to improve the overall system performance. In this paper, we combine an admission control mechanism and a traffic regulation mechanism. The basic idea of our resultant mechanism is that depending on the requested service, the Access Point (AP) could deny the network access if the required bandwidth is not guaranteed or on the contrary, the access is granted reducing the rate of the newly associated station or the rate of some current associated ones. Experimental results show that this is a suitable way to distribute the bandwidth among the associated wireless stations.

This Network aims to deal with the 2 major themes, treatment (quality of care) and prevention (via genetics and environmental factors), in conjunction with the recently formed European Cleft Organisation (ECO) who have begun to address the health inequalities with particular focus on Eastern Europe. This ESF EUROCleftNet Network proposal will build on previous success of collaborative research in the field of non-syndromic OFC (NS-OFC). The recent GWAS “phase” of research in the field has spawned a comprehensive list of putative genetic loci, and the new grand challenges are (a) to fine map the cleft loci and identify the functional gene variants that are {{at the base of the}} genetic risk for NS-OFC (b) embark on epigenetic and functional genomics projects (c) undertake gene-environment interaction studies, (d) unravel the epistatic interactions that are part of the aetiology of NS-OFCs and (e) translate genetic findings into clinical practice and prevention strategies.

40|$|The use of Light Emitting Diodes (LED) as a {{main source}} of {{illumination}} can help in significantly reducing global energy conspumtions. The LED is well suited for modulating visible light, enabling a wireless communication channel. A popular topic in Visible Light Communication (VLC) research is to push data throughput past the LED bandwidth limitation of around 4 - 5 MHz. Less {{attention has been given}} to systems using cheaper and slower components. This thesis focuses on effectively utilizing the available bandwidth in low cost dimmable VLC systems, to allow for increased data throughput, where the system bandwidth is limited by the receiver. Non- ickering constant perceived light intensity must furthermore be maintained under variable dimming conditions, to ensure positive user experience. A novel modulation scheme for VLC systems with dimming support is pro- posed. Adaptive Rectified Pulse-Width Modulation (ARPWM) modulates the light source with fine-grained pulses within a defined symbol period. The symbols are demodulated as light intensity levels. This allows for sending multiple bits per symbol {{in a manner similar to}} Pulse Amplitude Modula- tion (PAM). Upper and lower boundaries are applied to the duty cycle of the pulses according to the desired dimming level, reducing the number of light compensation symbols needed to maintain a constant perceived light intensity for the user. ARPWM is compared to existing modulation schemes, and a throughput increase by a factor of 4. 3 was observed compared to state-of-the-art Vari- able On-Off Keying (VOOK). With the testbed used for the experiments we have demonstrated the use of ARPWM in an indoor office environment, with a maximum communication distance of 4. 2 meters in a low-noise en- vironment.

Here, we focused on pod shattering in common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), the most important legume crop for human consuption in the world. With this main aim, we developed a methodological pipeline that comprises a thorough characterization under field conditions, including also the chemical composition and histological analysis of the pod valves. The pipeline was developed {{based on the assumption}} that the shattering trait itself can be treated in principle as a “syndrome” (i. e., a set of correlated different traits) at the pod level. We characterized a population of 267 introgression lines that were developed ad-hoc to study shattering in common bean. Three main objectives were sought: (1) to dissect the shattering trait into its “components,” of level (percentage of shattering pods per plant) and mode (percentage of pods with twisting or non-twisting valves); (2) to test whether shattering is associated to the chemical composition and/or the histological characteristics of the pod valves; and (3) to test the associations between shattering and other plant traits. We can conclude the following: Very high shattering levels can be achieved in different modes; shattering resistance is mainly a qualitative trait; and high shattering levels is correlated with high carbon and lignin contents of the pod valves and with specific histological charaterstics of the ventral sheath and the inner fibrous layer of the pod wall. Our data also suggest that shattering comes with a “cost,” as it is associated with lowpod size, low seed weight per pod, high pod weight, and low seed to pod-valves ratio; indeed, it can be more exaustively described as a syndrome at the pod level. Our work suggests that the valve chemical composition (i. e., carbon and lignin content) can be used for a high <b>troughput</b> phenotyping procedures for shattering phenotyping.

ARFGAP 1 est un régulateur négatif de l'activation d'ARF 1 qui est impliqué dans les système de trafic vésiculaire COPI et les voies de signalisation par la phospholipase D. L'ensemble de nos résultats ouvrent de nouvelles perspectives de recherche dans la signalisation intercellulaire de M. Tuberculosis. The current TB lengthy {{antibiotic therapy}} fails {{to be effective}} against multidrug and extremly resistant strains. To this end, improved understanding of the fundamental biology of this complex disease is needed {{to come up with}} radical advances in TB control. Pathology is intimately linked to the interplay between the host immune response and the persistence of the mycobacterium. In the lungs -the major affected organ- M. tuberculosis has a preferential tropism for alveolar macrophages, dendritic cells and type II alveolar pneumocytes. Whereas the colonization of macrophages by M. tuberculosis has been comprehensively studied, much less is knowm abaout that of lungs epithelial cells in which the bacillus penetrates but hardly replicates. To uncover key cellular genes involved in the invasion of M. tuberculosis in pneumocytes, we undertook a genome wide RNAi screening on the M. tuberculosis infected type II pneumocyte cell model A 549. To do this we established a method relying on high content high <b>troughput</b> microscopy enabling the screening of a library of 20 000 RNAi and the selection and confirmation of the 88 RNAi hits. Among them, we carried out a more thorough study on ARFGAP 1 for which silencing led to extensive bacterial internalization inside the epithelial cells followed by strong replication. We showed that in the context of out in vitro M. tuberculosis model of infection, ARFGAP 1 negatively regulates ARF 1, which impacts on vesicular trafficking, signaling through phospholipase D and actin remodeling. Altogether, our results reveal novel host pathways that are involved in the succesful intracellular colonization of the tubercle becillus. s.

40|$|Obesity-induced type 2 {{diabetes}} mellitus (T 2 DM) has grown to epidemic proportions in the last decades. The number of adults with T 2 DM in the United States has increased rapidly by almost 50 % between 1991 and 2000 according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Furthermore, the World Health Organisation (WHO) predicts {{that the number of}} T 2 DM patiens worldwide will grow to as much as 300 million in the year 2025. T 2 DM is not characeterised by the lack of insulin production found for the much less common type 1 {{diabetes mellitus}}, but manifests itself by decreased sensitivity towards insulin. In both types of diabetes similar complications arise as a result of impaired insulin signalling and lack of response to increased glucose levels. Serious complications, mostly resulting from vascular problems, like kidney failure and blindness are often found in untreated diabetic patients. Both types of diabetes can be treated and, in the case of T 2 DM, this often involves administration of insulin sensitizing drugs. A commonly used group of insulin sensitizers are the thiazolidinediones (TZDs). In 1995 it was found that TZDs function as ligands for the transcription factor PPAR a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily and the TZDs rosiglitazone and pioglitazone are now well known compounds, both in clinical and experimental settings. The importance of the different chromatin remodelling complexes in adipogenesis and PPARmediated gene expression has become evident from various studies. Ribozyme mediated decrease of the histone acetyltransferases CBP and p 300 expression, inhibited PPARmediated gene expression and adipogenesis. In accordance with these findings CBP-deficient as well as heterozygous mice show a reduced fat mass due to undeveloped white adipose tissue. Furthermore expression of dominant negative BRG- 1 or BRM, components of the ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling SWI/SNF complex, also decreased PPAR mediated gene activation. The main role of the TRAP complex, which is related to the yeast mediator proteins, lies in direct communication between the various coactivators and the general transcription complex. TRAP 220 is an essential subunit of the TRAP complex, interacting with various nuclear receptors including PPAR. By using TRAP 220 -/- fibroblasts it was shown that the TRAP complex plays an essential role in adipogenesis, acting as a PPARmediator complex. These data underscore the important function of coactivator complexes in PPAR signalling and thereby regulation of energy metabolism. Therefore, further understanding of PPAR activity is important since novel PPAR modifiers could offer the possibility of therapeutic modulation and provide new ways of improving insulin sensitivity (see also chapter 2). Therefore, as described in this thesis, we set out to investigate the different levels at which coactivators function in PPAR 2 activation and also how mutant forms of PPARare affected in their associations with coactivator proteins (chapter 3). In an effort to identify novel regulators of PPAR we have developed an immunoprecipitation assay coupled to mass spectrometry analysis (chapters 4 and 5) as well as a novel screening method based on PPAR 2 driven miRNA expression (chapter 6) for the use of high <b>troughput</b> siRNA library screens.

Many frame grabbers and some digital cameras have an FPGA installed. For such systems {{it is an interesting}} feature {{to reduce the amount of}} image data to minimize the transmission link between camera and computer and the data transferred over the PC bus. Besides, the flexibility of FPGAs allows to change or adapt the data compression method according to the capacity of the communication channel or the required image quality. The ability to establish new compression standards simply by reprogramming the FPGA, as well as to be able to compress large pictures in real time (≥ 30 fps) makes FPGAs in this application field most interesting. The aim of this work is to examine the fitness of FPGAs in the field of image data compression and to determine which resource requirements exist and how much external logic and memory are necessary for a realization. To meet the various system requirements, the work is subdivided into three parts. In the first section FPGAs in combination with an image sensor, which has no dedicated memory added, will be inspected. This limits the choice to point and bit oriented algorithms. An improved binary adaptive arithmetic encoder can be presented that operates with one bit per clock. This implementation enables image compression standards to run in real time. A special hardware adapted algorithm based on the two-point projection was designed to exceed the data <b>troughput</b> up to approx. 580 MByte/sec. The first hardware implementation of the lossless JPEG-LS standard completes this section. The next section deals with FPGA based frame grabbers where additional memory is presented and typical in the minimum size of an acquired image. This external memory allows the use of block oriented algorithms, as e. g. the vector quantization (approx. 44 MByte/sec, 4 X 4), which was long time not possible due to the high resource equirements. Another improvement is the realization of Wavelet coding by means of Embedded Zerotree Wavelets (approx. 23 MByte/sec) and the new JPEG 2000 image compression standard. The latter operates with only approx. 6 MByte/sec because of the complex bit-planer coder used. The last section covers the field of industrial image data reduction, where other limitations for the algorithm and the hardware implementation must be taken into account. For such applications compression algorithms based on psycho-visual techniques are not wanted. To get still high compression results, two special application-oriented solutions are introduced in this work. They have a high data throughput (approx. 32 - 50 MByte/s) and allow a cost-efficient implementation by low resource requirements. The presented results regarding the time response and the resource consumption show that image data reduction is possible in real time using FPGAs. Algorithms not implemented in hardware till now due to their high complexity uses also a PC to full capacity. For these two architectures an improvement can be expected in the near future by ongoing hardware development. The application fields dominated by ASICs can reveal new possible areas for FPGAs by their advantage of reprogramming...|$|E
