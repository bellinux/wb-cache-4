40|$|Background: We report {{results from}} the first {{randomized}} trial of the Positive Action (PA) intensive family program. Eighteen families (parents and teens) {{were randomly assigned to}} receive the program, consisting of 7 weekly meetings, with parents and teens attending separate sessions {{for the first half of}} each session (90 minutes) and then attending a joint session for the second half (90 minutes). Eleven families (approximately one-third) were randomly assigned to a wait-listed control condition. Methods: We surveyed all parents before the program and at immediate posttest with 16 items assessing family conflict (=. 74), family cohesion (=. 79), and parent-child bonding (=. 75). Data were also collected from additional parents who participated in two subsequent rounds of the program. Results: Results suggest that the PA intensive family program had immediate positive effects on all three outcomes with effect sizes (Cohen’s d) between 0. 34 and 0. 59. Significant interactions with pretest scores for cohesion indicated stronger effects for <b>those</b> families at <b>highest</b> <b>risk</b> <b>among</b> this high-risk sample. Data from subsequent pretest-posttest only groups replicated these results. Conclusions: We conclude that this first randomized trial of the Positive Action intensive family program and the pretest-posttest replications provide results worthy of further follow-up...|$|R
40|$|Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated enteropathy {{involving}} {{genetic and}} environmental factors whose interaction might influence disease risk. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the effects of milk-feeding practices and the HLA-DQ genotype on intestinal colonization of Bacteroides species in infants at risk of CD development. This study included 75 full-term newborns with at least one first-degree relative suffering from CD. Infants were classified according to milk-feeding practice (breast-feeding or formula feeding) and HLA-DQ genotype (high or low genetic risk). Stools were analyzed at 7 days, 1 month, and 4 months by PCR and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). The Bacteroides species diversity index was higher in formula-fed infants than in breast-fed infants. Breast-fed infants showed a higher prevalence of Bacteroides uniformis at 1 and 4 months of age, while formula-fed infants had a higher prevalence of B. intestinalis at all sampling times, of B. caccae at 7 days and 4 months, and of B. plebeius at 4 months. Infants with <b>high</b> genetic <b>risk</b> showed a <b>higher</b> prevalence of B. vulgatus, while those with low genetic <b>risk</b> showed a <b>higher</b> prevalence of B. ovatus, B. plebeius, and B. uniformis. Among breast-fed infants, the prevalence of B. uniformis was <b>higher</b> in <b>those</b> with low genetic risk than in <b>those</b> with <b>high</b> genetic <b>risk.</b> <b>Among</b> formula-fed infants, the prevalence of B. ovatus and B. plebeius was increased in those with low genetic risk, while the prevalence of B. vulgatus was <b>higher</b> in <b>those</b> with <b>high</b> genetic <b>risk.</b> The results indicate that both the type of milk feeding and the HLA-DQ genotype influence the colonization process of Bacteroides species, and possibly the disease risk. © 2011, American Society for Microbiology.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{estimate}} {{the prevalence of}} and risk factors for cutaneous lesions of the scrotum and intrascrotal lesions/anomalies among men included in a prostatic cancer screening program in a Brazilian metropolitan city. DESIGN AND SETTING: Cross-sectional study, private outpatient healthcare service. METHODS: 1731 men aged 40 years or over, participating in a prostate cancer screening program conducted by the municipal public employees' healthcare system, underwent systematic urological assessment by a single examiner. RESULTS: The prevalence of scrotal diseases in our sample was 44. 7 % (773 / 1731). Tinea cruris occurred in 203 (11. 7 %) of the participants, with <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> <b>among</b> diabetics and lower prevalence among nonwhite individuals; scrotal tinea in eight (0. 5 %), with <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> <b>among</b> hypertensive men; subcutaneous nodules in 12 (0. 7 %), especially in individuals with low schooling level; hydrocele in 283 (16. 4 %), with higher frequency among participants {{over the age of}} 60 years, diabetics or individuals with previous histories of nonspecific urethritis; spermatoceles in 174 (10. 1 %), with greater prevalence among individuals over the age of 60 years or diabetics, and lower frequency among individuals who underwent vasectomy; unilateral testicular hypotrophy/atrophy in 167 (9. 7 %) and bilateral hypotrophy/atrophy in 93 (5. 4 %), both occurring more frequently in individuals over the age of 60 years; absence of palpable testicles due to cryptorchidism in 7 (0. 4 %); and epididymitis/orchitis in 5 (0. 3 %), with higher prevalence among diabetics. No cases of cancer were identified in this sample. CONCLUSIONS: Scrotal diseases were highly prevalent in this population of Brazilian men...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{validate}} risk {{scores to}} predict occurrence of {{type 2 diabetes}} in the Dutch population. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. METHODS: Twelve basic risk scores and 13 extensive risk scores with biomarkers were used to predict {{the risk of developing}} type 2 diabetes during 7. 5 years in a prospective cohort of 38, 379 Dutch men and women. Occurrence of diabetes was documented through repeated questionnaires and validated against medical records. The capacity of the risk scores to correctly identify <b>those</b> at <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> of developing diabetes was determined using the C-statistic. The capacity of the risk scores to correctly quantify the absolute risk of diabetes was determined by testing the difference between the predicted and observed risk in the population. RESULTS: The capacity of basic risk scores to identify <b>those</b> at <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> of diabetes was good, with C-statistics ranging from 0. 74 (95 %-CI: 0. 73 - 0. 75) to 0. 84 (0. 82 - 0. 85). The extended risk scores were very capable of identifying <b>those</b> at <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> of diabetes, with C-statistics ranging from 0. 81 (0. 80 - 0. 83) to 0. 93 (0. 92 - 0. 94). Most risk scores, however, were unable to correctly quantify the absolute risk of diabetes; the risk was usually overestimated. Only the basic KORA model correctly quantified the risk in this Dutch population. CONCLUSION: In the Dutch population, risk scores to predict the occurrence of type 2 diabetes are very capable of identifying <b>those</b> at <b>high</b> <b>risk.</b> Extension with biomarkers improves this capacity. Quantification of the absolute risk of diabetes was insufficient in most risk scores...|$|R
