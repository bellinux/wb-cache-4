The first experiment evaluated emergence of the four species. Common waterhemp emergence in the <b>two-year</b> <b>system</b> was {{more than twice that}} in the four-year system in 2008, whereas giant ragweed emergence was 1. 7 X greater in the four-year system in 2008. No other differences were observed in cumulative emergence. A second study {{evaluated the}} growth and biomass production of the four weed species when seeds were planted at soybean planting and when soybean was at the V 2 stage. Velvetleaf in the first cohort in 2008 exhibited the only mature height difference and was 33 cm shorter in the <b>two-year</b> <b>system</b> compared with the four-year. Mature stem diameter was not influenced by cropping system in any weed species. The first cohort giant ragweed in the <b>two-year</b> <b>system</b> produced only 75 % of the biomass of giant ragweed in the four-year system in 2008.

40|$|This {{paper is}} based on the {{findings}} of a field study performed from 2002 to 2003 near the city of Yan an, which is in a gullied hilly region of the loess plateau of China. The <b>two-year</b> <b>system</b> survey monitored the temporal and spatial distribution of rainfall, soil moisture, underground flow (springs), and overflow in the Kang gou catchment in the Yan gou watershed near Yan an. The authors analysed the inner mechanism of interaction between rainfall, soil moisture, underground flow and runoff modules by comparing the values of these parameters {{in order to understand the}} hydrological responses in an eco-construction project. The results show that the eco-construction did not cause a decrease in runoff in heavy rainfall but could fully absorb lowintensity rainfall of long duration. The soil moisture increased along with downside slope, and spring flow increased with higher soil water content too. When runoff happened, spring flow sometimes would increase for the next 3 10 days. In general, the purpose of eco-construction in the loess plateau is to enable sustainable water use, which is very necessary to implement the region s ongoing Land Use and Cover Change (LUCC) projects including reforestation and grassland restoration. vokMyynti MTT tietopalvelu...|$|E
40|$|The {{goals of}} this {{research}} are (1) to prove the concept feasibility of a direct-drive electric propulsion system, and (2) to evaluate the performance and characteristics of a Russian TAL (Thruster with Anode Layer) operating in a long-pulse mode, powered by a capacitor-based power source developed at Space Power Institute. The TAL, designated D- 55, is characterized by an external acceleration zone and {{is powered by a}} unique chemical double layer (CDL) capacitor bank with a capacitance of 4 F at a charge voltage of 400 V. Performance testing of this power supply on the TAL was conducted at NASA Lewis Research Center in Cleveland, OH. Direct thrust measurements of the TAL were obtained at CDL power levels ranging from 450 to 1750 W. The specific impulse encompassed a range from 1150 s to 2200 s, yielding thruster system efficiencies between 50 and 60 %. Preliminary mission analysis of the CDL direct-drive concept and other electric propulsion options was performed for the ORACLE spacecraft in 6 am/ 6 pm and 12 am/ 12 pm, 300 km sun-synchronous orbits. The direct-drive option was competitive with the other systems by increasing available net mass between 5 and 42 % and reducing <b>two-year</b> <b>system</b> wet mass between 18 and 63 %. Overall, the electric propulsion power requirements for the satellite solar array were reduced between 57 and 91 % depending oil the orbit evaluated The direct-drive, CDL capacitor-based concept in electric propulsion thus promises to be a highly-efficient, viable alternative for satellite operations in specific near-Earth missions...|$|E

The better {{part of his life}} was spent developing and defining the junior college into the comprehensive community college. His contributions earned him a prestigious place in the annals of higher education, but his personality was not one of a stereotypical stodgy educator, nor is the story of his life a dry read. After working his way through college, Priest played professional baseball before serving in Naval Intelligence during World War II. His varied experiences helped shape his leadership style, often labeled as autocratic and sometimes truculent in conservative convictions. The same relentless drive that brought him criticism also brought him success and praise. Forthright honesty and risk-taking determination combined with vision brought about many positive results. Priest’s career in higher education began with the <b>two-year</b> college <b>system</b> in California before he was lured to Texas in 1965 to head the Dallas County Junior College District. Over the next fifteen years Priest transformed the junior college program into the Dallas County Community College District (DCCCD) and built it up to seven colleges.

40|$|Sugarcane {{has been}} a major agronomic crop in Hawaii with an unique, high-yield, <b>two-year</b> {{production}} <b>system.</b> However, parameters relevant to advanced, cellulosic biofuel production, such as net ecosystem productivity (NEP) and radiation use efficiency (RUE), have not been evaluated in Hawaii under commercial production. Recent demand potential has rekindled interest in Hawaiian grown biofuels; as such, {{there is a need to}} understand productivity under changing climate and agronomic practices. To this end, we established two eddy covariance towers in commercial sugarcane fields in Maui, Hawaii to evaluate the carbon balance and RUE of sugarcane under contrasting elevations and soil types. We combined the tower observations with biometric and satellite data to assess RUE in terms of net biomass accumulation and daily gross primary production. High, sustained net NEP was found in both fields (cumulative NEP 4. 23 – 5. 37 103 g C m 2 over the course of the measurement period). Biomass RUE was statistically similar for both fields (1. 15 – 1. 24 g above ground biomass per MJ intercepted solar irradiance). Carbon accumulated in both fields at nearly the same rate with differences in cumulative biomass due to differing crop cycle lengths; cumulative gross primary productivity and ecosystem respiration were higher in the lower elevation field. Contrary to previous studies in Hawaiian sugarcane, we did not see a large decrease in NEP or increase in ecosystem respiration in the 2 nd year, which we attributed to suppressed decomposition of dead cane stalks and leaves due to drip irrigation and drought. Biomass RUE also showed little decline in the 2 nd year. The results show that Hawaiian sugarcane has a higher productivity than sugarcane grown in other regions of the world and also suggests that a longer (3 ̆e 12 months) growing cycle may be optimal for biomass production...|$|R
