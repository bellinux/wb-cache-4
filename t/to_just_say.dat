2500|$|As {{a result}} of Douglas's stroke the {{previous}} summer, however, in which he lost most of his speaking ability, his close friends and family were concerned about whether he should try to speak, or what he should say. Both his son, Michael, and his long-time friend, Jack Valenti, urged him to only say [...] "Thank you", and leave the stage. Douglas agreed. But when {{standing in front of}} the audience, he had second thoughts: [...] "I intended <b>to</b> <b>just</b> <b>say</b> 'thank you,' but I saw 1,000 people, and felt I had to say something more, and I did." [...] Valenti remembers that after Douglas held up the Oscar, addressed his sons, and told his wife how much he loved her, everyone was astonished at his voice's improvement: ...|$|E

2500|$|At Sessions's {{confirmation}} hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee, four Department of Justice lawyers {{who had worked}} with Sessions testified that he made racially offensive remarks.

Hebert, a civil rights lawyer, said that he did not consider Sessions a racist, and that Sessions [...] "has a tendency sometimes <b>to</b> <b>just</b> <b>say</b> something, and I believe these comments were along that vein". Hebert also said that Sessions had called a white civil rights attorney [...] "maybe" [...] a [...] "disgrace to his race". Sessions said he did not recall making that remark and he did not believe it.|$|E

Former Arkansas governor and 2008 candidate for president Mike Huckabee praised Obama's speech on the MSNBC program Morning Joe, while also commenting on the Rev. Wright controversy. Huckabee argued that Obama [...] "handled this {{about as well as}} anybody could" [...] and suggested that it was [...] "a very historic speech." [...] While he decried the remarks made by Wright, Huckabee, a former pastor himself, also noted that [...] "sermons...are rarely written word-for-word" [...] and that pastors often get [...] "caught up in the emotion of the moment." [...] Referencing his experience growing up in the segregated South and the legacy of Jim Crow, the former Arkansas governor noted that [...] "we've got to cut some slack to people who grew up being called names, being told, 'You have to sit in the balcony when you go to [...] movie'...Sometimes people do have a chip on their shoulder and resentment. And you have <b>to</b> <b>just</b> <b>say,</b> I probably would too."

2500|$|In a well-ordered set, every {{non-empty}} subset contains a distinct smallest element. [...] Given the axiom of dependent choice, this is equivalent <b>to</b> <b>just</b> <b>saying</b> that the set is totally ordered {{and there is}} no infinite decreasing sequence, something perhaps easier to visualize. In practice, the importance of well-ordering is justified by the possibility of applying transfinite induction, which says, essentially, that any property that passes on from the predecessors of an element to that element itself must be true of all elements (of the given well-ordered set). [...] If the states of a computation (computer program or game) can be well-ordered {{in such a way that}} each step is followed by a [...] "lower" [...] step, then the computation will terminate.|$|R
