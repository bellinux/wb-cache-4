50|$|Mouse chording {{allows a}} user {{to use a}} <b>two-button</b> <b>mouse,</b> trackball, or {{touchpad}} as if it where a three-button device. For example, in the Unix graphical user interface (X11), the middle button is used to paste text. Since Microsoft-type mice traditionally only had two buttons, users of Unix-type systems such as Linux and BSD chord {{the right and left}} buttons to paste text.|$|E
50|$|The {{introduction}} of the scroll wheel is notably {{one of the first}} additions to the basic <b>two-button</b> <b>mouse</b> design used for PCs that became a de facto standard. Its popularity increased with the proliferation of the World Wide Web, where efficient mouse-only scrolling is most useful, since it allows the mouse pointer to remain close to the page's hyperlinks while scrolling rather than moving to a scroll bar.|$|E
50|$|A {{workaround}} {{common to}} users of <b>two-button</b> <b>mice</b> in environments designed for three buttons is mouse chording, to simulate a tertiary-click by pressing both buttons simultaneously.|$|R
5000|$|When {{pressing}} Control and {{clicking the}} mouse-button, {{you will get}} a contextual menu. This is a compatibility feature for users with one-button mice; users with <b>two-button</b> <b>mice</b> just use the right mouse-button, with no modifiers.|$|R
5000|$|MacWeb {{pioneered the}} [...] "click and hold" [...] gesture {{to display a}} popup contextual menu. This mouse gesture was {{commonly}} used on the Macintosh before the prevalence of <b>two-button</b> <b>mice</b> on the Mac platform. MacWeb's preferences dialog allowed users to customize display styles on a per-tag basis similar to Cascading style sheets ...|$|R
50|$|Inspired by the Xerox Alto user {{interface}} (developed by Xerox PARC), Webster designed a layered windowing system called ZoomAction. It was hailed for its {{ease of use}} and intuitive functionality. Players only needed an Apple two-button joystick or Atari ST's <b>two-button</b> <b>mouse</b> to play the game. Windows appeared {{one on top of}} the other as the player accessed different parts of the game. Drag-and-drop icons were used for repairing the ship, buying components, eating food, and so on. The user would interact with non-player characters (NPCs) via buttons listing possible responses to what the NPC had just said.|$|E
50|$|The {{list view}} also shows an Options pop-out menu which, when opened, {{allows users to}} change the display method used by the Stack (fan, grid or list), the order items in the Stack are {{displayed}} (by name, date created, date modified, date added and kind), {{and the appearance of}} the Stack icon in the dock (folder or stack). These options are available in the other three methods by either right-clicking on the icon with the right button of a <b>two-button</b> <b>mouse,</b> or by holding down the Control key on the keyboard while simultaneously clicking with a one-button mouse. Holding down the primary mouse button will target the contextual menu as well.|$|E
30|$|Stimuli were {{presented}} using PsychoPy (Peirce, 2009) on a 20 -inch Sony Trinitron monitor. Participants {{sat at a}} table 75 cm from the monitor. Responses were made using a right or left click on a <b>two-button</b> <b>mouse.</b>|$|E
50|$|Although {{this device}} closely resembles and mimics the {{functionality}} of a <b>two-button</b> computer <b>mouse,</b> it {{was smaller than}} most computer mice {{of the time and}} had a significantly shorter cord than the standard Super NES controller.|$|R
50|$|Combined with {{a rising}} tide of {{suggestions}} that Apple switch to a typical <b>two-button</b> wheel <b>mouse</b> for their pack-in bundles, the unique design of the Pro Mouse's body inspired jokes that Apple had made a zero-button mouse in response.|$|R
50|$|The mouse {{itself is}} a simple <b>two-button</b> ball <b>mouse</b> that plugs {{directly}} into the PlayStation controller port without adapters or conversions and is a fully supported Sony accessory. It was packaged along with a mouse mat bearing the PlayStation logo.|$|R
40|$|World Wind {{allows users}} to zoom from {{satellite}} altitude down to any place on Earth, leveraging high-resolution LandSat imagery and SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission) elevation data to experience Earth in visually rich 3 D. In addition to Earth, World Wind can also visualize other planets, and there are already comprehensive data sets for Mars and the Earth's moon, which are as easily accessible as those of Earth. There {{have been more than}} 20 million downloads to date, and the software is being used heavily by the Department of Defense due to the code s ability to be extended and the evolution of the code courtesy of NASA and the user community. Primary features include the dynamic access to public domain imagery and its ease of use. All one needs to control World Wind is a <b>two-button</b> <b>mouse.</b> Additional guides and features can be accessed through a simplified menu. A JAVA version will be available soon. Navigation is automated with single clicks of a mouse, or by typing in any location to automatically zoom in to see it. The World Wind install package contains the necessary requirements such as the. NET runtime and managed DirectX library. World Wind can display combinations of data from a variety of sources, including Blue Marble, LandSat 7, SRTM, NASA Scientific Visualization Studio, GLOBE, and much more. A thorough list of features, the user manual, a key chart, and screen shots are available at [URL]...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the use of}} computer-mediated communication for lie-detection and interpersonal deceit. The literature within the fields of lie-detection and mediated communication are reviewed and it is proposed {{that there is a}} lack of knowledge surrounding how people use CMC to deceive one another. Qualitative research was carried out in order to address this shortcoming, exploring the self-reported experiences of chat room users who have been exposed to online deceit. Reports were provided that describe the misrepresentation of age, gender, vocation, affection, and appearance. The importance of stereotypes in driving suspicions is also emphasised within the reports. It is suggested that this key characteristic has more dominance in CMC than it would do face-to-face because of the occlusion of the traditional nonstrategic clues to deceit. Evidence for an alternative set of nonstrategic leakage clues was examined further by conducting a variant of the Guilty-Knowledge test within the context of a CMC based crime. It was found that participants exhibited a response time inhibition effect when presented with 'guilty knowledge' and that this effect was detectable through a standard <b>two-button</b> <b>mouse.</b> The use of such nonstrategic cues to deceit was explored further in a study that examined how CMC might be used to add additional control to a Statement Validity Assessment truth-validation test. It was found that the content analysis technique used by SVA was unable in its present form to correctly distinguish between truthful and fabricated statements of participants interviewed using a CMC chat program. In addition, it was found that the deletion-behaviours of participants fabricating a story within CMC provided no quantitative or qualitative evidence that they were lying.

40|$|The {{conceptual}} design of space and/or planetary electrical power systems has required considerable effort. Traditionally, {{in the early}} stages of the design cycle ({{conceptual design}}), the researchers have had to thoroughly study and analyze tradeoffs between system components, hardware architectures, and operating parameters (such as frequencies) to optimize system mass, efficiency, reliability, and cost. This process could take anywhere from several months to several years (as for the former Space Station Freedom), depending on the scale of the system. Although there are many sophisticated commercial software design tools for personal computers (PC's), none of them can support or provide total system design. To meet this need, researchers at the NASA Lewis Research Center cooperated with Professor George Kusic from the University of Pittsburgh to develop a new tool to help project managers and design engineers choose the best system parameters as quickly as possible in the early design stages (in days instead of months). It is called the Aerospace Power Systems Design and Analysis (APSDA) Tool. By using this tool, users can obtain desirable system design and operating parameters such as system weight, electrical distribution efficiency, bus power, and electrical load schedule. With APSDA, a large-scale specific power system was designed in a matter of days. It is an excellent tool to help designers make tradeoffs between system components, hardware architectures, and operation parameters {{in the early stages}} of the design cycle. user interface. It operates on any PC running the MS-DOS (Microsoft Corp.) operating system, version 5. 0 or later. A color monitor (EGA or VGA) and <b>two-button</b> <b>mouse</b> are required. The APSDA tool was presented at the 30 th Intersociety Energy Conversion Engineering Conference (IECEC) and is being beta tested at several NASA centers. Beta test packages are available for evaluation by contacting the author...|$|E
30|$|Participants {{were seated}} {{in front of}} a Core i 7, 2 GHz Windows 8, 64 -bit, 8 GB RAM laptop. The display was placed at eye level with an {{approximate}} viewing distance of 65 cm. Responses were recorded from pressing the left button of a <b>two-button</b> ergonomic <b>mouse.</b>|$|R
50|$|Input {{devices for}} {{computers}} can present obstacles to left-handed operation if intended for right handed use. Some computer set-ups have the mouse {{placed on the}} right side of the keyboard and unable to be repositioned to the left. The mouse itself is also sometimes shaped to fit the right hand better. The functions of mouse buttons, even on mice shaped to fit both hands, default to right-hand use. On <b>two-button</b> <b>mice,</b> the left button —under the index finger of a right-handed person— is the primary button, while the right button performs secondary functions. The on-screen pointers themselves are also configured for right-handed people. Most desktop operating systems allow a user to reverse the functionality of mouse buttons to accommodate left-handed use, but left-handed cursors sometimes need to be specially downloaded. Trackballs and trackpads are often shaped for right-handed use. Even with the ability to change the functionality of buttons, these devices may be difficult for left-handed use. For a left handed person there are computer mice designed for left handed use, but they are a much smaller segment of the marketplace.|$|R
5000|$|The Star workstation, officially named Xerox 8010 Information System, was {{the first}} {{commercial}} system to incorporate various technologies that have since become standard in personal computers, including a bitmapped display, a window-based graphical user interface, icons, folders, <b>mouse</b> (<b>two-button),</b> Ethernet networking, file servers, print servers, and e-mail.|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{advances}} in computing hardware technologies, the <b>two-button</b> computer <b>mouse</b> {{has remained the}} predominant means to interact with a computer. In this paper a system has been designed for implanting an invisible computer mouse that enables interaction with computer without attaching a hardware mouse. Sixth Sense Technology is used for this purpose. The aim of this technique {{is the use of}} a real time vision system for its application within visual interaction environments through hand gesture recognition, using general-purpose hardware and low cost sensors, like a simple personal computer or an USB web cam, so that any user could make use of it in his office or home. A fast segmentation process is used to obtain the moving hand from the whole image against different backgrounds and lighting conditions. The movements and arrangements of the hand fingers are grasped as gestures that act as an interaction instruction for the projected application interfaces...|$|R
