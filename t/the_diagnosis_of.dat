5|$|For {{most of the}} 20th century, <b>the</b> <b>diagnosis</b> <b>of</b> Alzheimer's {{disease was}} {{reserved}} for individuals {{between the ages of}} 45 and 65 who developed symptoms of dementia. The terminology changed after 1977 when a conference on AD concluded that the clinical and pathological manifestations of presenile and senile dementia were almost identical, although the authors also added that this did not {{rule out the possibility that}} they had different causes. This eventually led to <b>the</b> <b>diagnosis</b> <b>of</b> Alzheimer's disease independent of age. The term senile dementia of the Alzheimer type (SDAT) was used for a time to describe the condition in those over 65, with classical Alzheimer's disease being used to describe those who were younger. Eventually, the term Alzheimer's disease was formally adopted in medical nomenclature to describe individuals of all ages with a characteristic common symptom pattern, disease course, and neuropathology.|$|E
5|$|Imaging {{tests of}} the veins are used in <b>the</b> <b>diagnosis</b> <b>of</b> DVT, most {{commonly}} either proximal compression ultrasound or whole-leg ultrasound.

40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the correlation of endometrial culture results with <b>the</b> clinical <b>diagnosis</b> <b>of</b> acute pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Methods: A total of 130 patients admitted with <b>the</b> clinical <b>diagnosis</b> <b>of</b> acute PID were prospectively enrolled in this study. Endometrial cultures by transcervical aspirate currette were obtained from all patients. Results: Of 130 patients, 114 were discharged with a clinical <b>diagnosis</b> <b>of</b> PID. Of these 114 patients, 112 had positive endometrial cultures for pathogenic organisms. The correlation between endometrial culture results and <b>the</b> clinical <b>diagnosis</b> <b>of</b> acute PID was 98. 2 %. When patients with only mycoplasmas in the endometrial cavity were excluded, the correlation between endometrial culture results and <b>the</b> clinical <b>diagnosis</b> <b>of</b> acute PID was 93. 8 %. Conclusion: These data demonstrate the exceedingly high degree of correlation between endometrial culture results and <b>the</b> clinical <b>diagnosis</b> <b>of</b> acute PID. Therefore, endometrial cultures may serve as a useful adjunct in the evaluation of patients with a clinical <b>diagnosis</b> <b>of</b> acute PID...|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>diagnosis</b> <b>of</b> Guillain–Barré {{syndrome}} {{depends on}} findings such as rapid development of muscle paralysis, absent reflexes, absence of fever, and a likely cause. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis (through a lumbar spinal puncture) and nerve conduction studies are supportive investigations commonly performed in <b>the</b> <b>diagnosis</b> <b>of</b> GBS. Testing for antiganglioside antibodies is often performed, but {{their contribution to}} diagnosis is usually limited. Blood tests are generally performed to exclude the possibility of another cause for weakness, such as {{a low level of}} potassium in the blood. An abnormally low level of sodium in the blood is often encountered in Guillain–Barré syndrome. This has been attributed to the inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone, leading to relative retention of water.|$|E

40|$|System level {{diagnosis}} {{is an important}} approach for <b>the</b> fault <b>diagnosis</b> <b>of</b> multiprocessor systems. In system level diagnosis, diagnosability is an important measure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>diagnosis</b> capability <b>of</b> interconnection networks. But as a measure, diagnosability can not reflect <b>the</b> <b>diagnosis</b> capability <b>of</b> multiprocessor systems to link faults which may occur in real circumstances. In this paper, we propose the definition of h-edge tolerable diagnosability to better measure <b>the</b> <b>diagnosis</b> capability <b>of</b> interconnection networks under hybrid fault circumstances. The h-edge tolerable diagnosability of a multiprocessor system G is {{the maximum number of}} faulty nodes that the system can guarantee to locate when the number of faulty edges does not exceed h,denoted by t_h^e(G). The PMC model and MM model are the two most widely studied <b>diagnosis</b> models for <b>the</b> system level <b>diagnosis</b> <b>of</b> multiprocessor systems. <b>The</b> hypercubes are the most well-known interconnection networks. In this paper, the h-edge tolerable diagnosability of n-dimensional hypercube under the PMC model and MM^* is determined as follows: t_h^e(Q_n) = n-h, where 1 ≤ h<n, n≥ 3.

5|$|Ultrasound of {{the liver}} and biliary tree is often used as the initial imaging {{modality}} in patients with suspected obstructive jaundice. Ultrasound can identify obstruction and ductal dilatation and, in some cases, may be sufficient to diagnose cholangiocarcinoma.

5|$|While {{abdominal}} imaging can {{be useful}} in <b>the</b> <b>diagnosis</b> <b>of</b> cholangiocarcinoma, direct imaging of the bile ducts is often necessary. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), an endoscopic procedure performed by a gastroenterologist or specially trained surgeon, has been widely used for this purpose. Although ERCP is an invasive procedure with attendant risks, its advantages include the ability to obtain biopsies and to place stents or perform other interventions to relieve biliary obstruction. Endoscopic ultrasound can also be performed at the time of ERCP and may increase the accuracy of the biopsy and yield information on lymph node invasion and operability. As an alternative to ERCP, percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC) may be utilized. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is a non-invasive alternative to ERCP. Some authors have suggested that MRCP should supplant ERCP in <b>the</b> <b>diagnosis</b> <b>of</b> biliary cancers, as it may more accurately define the tumor and avoids the risks of ERCP.|$|E

5|$|A CO-oximeter {{can be used}} to {{determine}} carboxyhemoglobin levels. Pulse CO-oximeters estimate carboxyhemoglobin with a non-invasive finger clip similar to a pulse oximeter.

The use of a regular pulse oximeter is not effective in <b>the</b> <b>diagnosis</b> <b>of</b> carbon monoxide poisoning as people with carbon monoxide poisoning may have a normal oxygen saturation level on a pulse oximeter.
