5|$|June 1990: The {{remnants}} of Hurricane Boris briefly caused heavy rainfall in southern California. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> {{of the reasons}} why it was the wettest June in San Diego, since record-keeping began in 1850. Despite this, less than an inch (25mm) of rain fell in most locations.|$|E
5|$|MLB and the Major League Umpires Association {{engaged in}} a dispute {{regarding}} the amount of pay owed to umpires for officiating the game {{that took place in}} Baltimore. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> factor that led to the mass resignation of MLB umpires that took place on September 2, 1999.|$|E

5|$|Nagumo quickly {{reversed}} {{his order}} to re-arm the bombers with general purpose bombs {{and demanded that}} the scout plane ascertain {{the composition of the}} American force.

5|$|The creek flooded in September 1850. It was {{the most}} severe flood of the creek up to that time. In January 1996, 400 {{buildings}} along Solomon Creek flooded by it due to melting snow. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> of numerous floods on that area of the creek.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{investigation}} {{and analysis of}} measurements and {{the damage caused by}} the tornado, it was given a rating of 'F3' on the Fujita scale. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> of the most powerful tornadoes ever recorded in Australia, and the scale indicated the tornado may have produced winds of between 252 and 300 kilometres per hour.|$|E
5|$|Additional {{concerns}} are hypothyroidism, allergies, epilepsy, diabeties and glandular disorders which may cause baldness. The hair loss occurs at around {{six months of}} age, affecting the neck, thighs and tail; however the frequency has been reduced through work conducted by the breed clubs. Hip dysplasia is seen in around 8.3% of the breed, according to surveys conducted by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals over a twenty five-year period between 1974 and 1999. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> of the lower results of the sporting breeds, with Greyhounds coming lowest with 3.4%, and the related Boykin Spaniel coming in second highest at 47%. There {{was no evidence of}} elbow dysplasia found. The breed has an average life span of 1013 years.|$|E
5|$|Another {{element of}} the Commonwealth army {{consisted}} of various private armies fielded by the most powerful magnates. In time of peace these consisted of usually small regiments {{of a few hundred}} men, but at their extreme they could number up to 10,000, including cavalry and artillery. In some instances the magnate contribution could surpass that of the main Commonwealth army on the frontlines, although often the magnates preferred to save their troops, as they were not compensated for the state for their contributions. The troops were paid for and equipped by the richest of the noble families, such as the Opaliński, Lubomirski, Potocki, Ossoliński, Zamoyski, Koniecpolski, Sieniawski, Żółkiewski, Sapieha, Chodkiewicz, Pac and Radziwiłł families. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> of the reasons why the magnates {{played a major role in}} Polish politics, and on occasion, allowed them to engage in bloody civil wars (such as the Lithuanian Civil War in 1700) amongst themselves.|$|E

5|$|Broadcasting by National Public Radio in the United States {{followed}} in March 1981 with a repeat broadcast in September. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> {{of their first}} transmissions in stereo. The following year, 1982, the series was carried by CBC Radio (Canadian Broadcasting Corporation). A German radio version of the first six radio episodes, Per Anhalter ins All was transmitted in 1981 and the twelve original radio episodes have been translated and transmitted in Finland, France, The Netherlands and Sweden.|$|E
5|$|By a 5–4 margin, {{the justices}} {{reversed}} the conviction, agreeing that Jacobson had been entrapped, on April 6, 1992. It {{has since been}} reported that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> of the rare cases where the decision changed after arguments. The original poll of the justices showed a 7–2 majority for affirmance, with only White and Stevens holding out. But White argued persuasively for reversal to his fellow Justices, and Blackmun and Clarence Thomas, who had replaced Marshall, changed their minds. It {{has been suggested that}} Thomas, who later established a reputation for allowing wide latitude to law enforcement similar to other contemporary Republican appointees, was especially sensitive at that time to Jacobson's situation due to the sexual harassment allegations raised by Anita Hill during his own recent confirmation hearings.|$|E
5|$|Carlsen won the London Chess Classic in December {{with five}} wins (over McShane, Aronian, Gawain Jones, Adams and Judit Polgár) and three draws (against Kramnik, Nakamura and Anand).

He scored an undefeated 8/10, winning every game as white (against Topalov, Wang Yue, Leko, Teimour Radjabov, and Dmitry Jakovenko), and also winning as black against Jakovenko. By rating performance, <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> {{of the greatest}} results in history, with a PR of 3002.

5|$|Christopher Reeve {{was cast}} as Superman, having {{initially}} failed {{to impress the}} Salkinds before bulking up. Brando meanwhile, despite spending {{less than two weeks}} on the shoot, and not even reading the script until then, earned $3.7million up front, plus 11.75% of the gross profits from the film. The film was a success both critically and commercially, being released during the Christmas season of 1978; it did not have much competition, leading the producers to believe that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> factor in the film's success.|$|E
5|$|Coal {{measures}} {{appear in}} the Radstock district, and surrounding Somerset Coalfield (largely concealed by Triassic and newer rocks). There are two series of coal-bearing sandstones and shales separated by Pennant Sandstone. Locally the beds are folded and faulted. There were mines in the Radstock and Nailsea areas but these have closed. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> of the first areas {{in the world to}} undergo systematic geological study and mapping by John Strachey and William Smith in the 18th century. They observed the rock layers, or strata, which led Smith {{to the creation of a}} testable hypothesis, which he termed the Principle of Faunal Succession.|$|E
