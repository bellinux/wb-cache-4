5|$|In 1898, Bresslau met {{her future}} husband, Albert Schweitzer at a wedding. Shortly thereafter, they {{developed}} a relationship that included separation, independence, and non-exclusive behaviors. This allowed both to develop their lives while enjoying each other's companionship, conversation, and virtues. The one thing <b>that</b> <b>united</b> the pair was their shared ideology: {{to take care of}} others.|$|E
5|$|In the semi-finals, Juve's captain Antonio Conte met Edgar Davids' pass to give Juventus an away goal. United {{equalised}} in injury-time through Giggs, who converted a Beckham cross: a Teddy Sheringham goal a {{few minutes}} earlier had been disallowed. A draw meant <b>that</b> <b>United</b> either needed to win in Italy, or get a score-draw of 2–2 or greater.|$|E
5|$|Upon their homestance {{against the}} Canadian teams, United {{hit the road}} for matches at Eastern Conference rivals, Chicago Fire and Sporting Kansas City. A lone goal in the 73rd minute from United's Josh Wolff gave the team a point against Chicago, while an early goal from Sporting's Omar Bravo {{consequently}} ended in a 1–0 defeat against Kansas City, making {{it the first time}} since 27 April <b>that</b> <b>United</b> lost on the road.|$|E

5|$|A {{particularly}} memorable {{match between}} the two sides came on 1 February 1958, when they met in a league fixture at Highbury. It was the last league game <b>that</b> <b>United</b> played before the Munich air disaster five days later, which claimed the lives of eight of their players and saw two other players injured {{to such an extent that}} they never played again. United won the game 5–4, with goals from Tommy Taylor (twice), Duncan Edwards, Bobby Charlton and Dennis Viollet. Five of the United players who would lose their lives as a result of the crash took to the field in the game – captain and full-back Roger Byrne, right-half Eddie Colman, centre-half Mark Jones, left-half Edwards and centre-forward Taylor.|$|E
5|$|Both {{species were}} {{formerly}} recognized {{as belonging to}} Theriosuchus; K. guimarotae was initially named as T. guimarotae, and specimens of K. langenbergensis were initially referred to T. pusillus upon their discovery. Schwarz and colleagues recognized a number of characteristics <b>that</b> <b>united</b> these two taxa {{to the exclusion of}} other species of Theriosuchus; in particular, Knoetschkesuchus only has two distinct types of teeth, lacking the leaf-shaped teeth seen in other atoposaurids. Other distinguishing traits include the relatively wide skull, and the presence of the antorbital and mandibular fenestrae in all life stages.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{receiving}} a home draw {{in each of}} their first four rounds (Third to Sixth), United were paired against difficult opponents throughout the competition. On their route to the final they defeated five Premier League teams: Middlesbrough, Liverpool, Chelsea, Arsenal and Newcastle United. The only non-Premier League team <b>that</b> <b>United</b> played in the competition was Fulham, {{who at the time}} played in the Second Division, the third tier of English football, but even they were not considered pushovers, having claimed shock wins over Southampton and Aston Villa in the previous rounds.|$|E

5|$|Following the club's 4–0 home defeat, United {{returned}} to Open Cup play, where they took on New England Revolution in the MLS qualification semifinals. Hosted at Maryland SoccerPlex in Boyds, the Revolution quickly {{got off to}} a 2–0 lead, thanks to a pair of goals from Revolution midfielder Kheli Dube. Dube scored in 37th and 47th minutes of play. Twenty minutes following Dube's second goal, Virginia-native Alan Koger gave the Revs a 3–0 lead. Shortly thereafter, United's Branko Bošković scored his first two goals of 2011 to trim the lead down to one goal. The late rally, however, proved to be too little, too late as the Revolution defeated United 3–2. Consequently, {{it was the first time}} since 2002 <b>that</b> <b>United</b> did not qualify into the main tournament propers of the Open Cup.|$|E
5|$|In {{the midst}} of this drive on Taegu, an {{ammunition}} shortage became critical for the UN forces. The situation was such <b>that</b> <b>United</b> Nations Commander General of the Army Douglas MacArthur on September 9 sent messages urging that two ammunition ships then en route to Yokohama, Japan and Pusan carrying 172,790 rounds of 105-mm. shells, with estimated arrival time September 11, proceed at maximum speed consistent with the safety of the vessels. Eighth Army on September 10 reduced the ration of 105-mm. howitzer ammunition from 50 to 25 rounds per howitzer per day, except in cases of emergency. Carbine ammunition was also in critical short supply. The 17th Field Artillery Battalion, with the first 8-inch howitzers to arrive in Korea, could not engage in the battle for lack of ammunition.|$|E
5|$|It was {{originally}} planned <b>that</b> <b>United</b> States President Ronald Reagan should {{take part in}} the Second World War memorial event in the Bundestag, shifting the emphasis from remembering the past to highlighting West Germany in its partnership with the Western Bloc. On Weizsäcker's strong urging, the occasion was marked without Reagan, who visited West Germany several days earlier instead, surrounding the G7-summit in Bonn. Reagan's visit nevertheless sparked controversy, especially in the United States. In an attempt to reproduce the gesture made by Kohl and French President François Mitterrand a year earlier at Verdun, the chancellor and Reagan were set to visit the military cemetery in Bitburg. This raised objections, since the cemetery included the last resting place for several members of the Waffen-SS.|$|E

5|$|On September 11, 2001, United Airlines Flight 93 was hijacked by {{four members}} of al-Qaeda {{as part of the}} September 11 attacks. The hijackers' {{specific}} target was the United States Capitol. Among the pilots available that day of the 113th Wing of the DC Air National Guard were Lieutenant Colonel Marc H. Sasseville and Lieutenant Heather Penney Garcia. They were given the mission of finding the United Airlines Flight 93 and destroying it however they could. Since the fighter jets were absent of missiles and packed only with dummy ammunition from a recent training mission, {{there was only one way}} to do it and that was by ramming the aircraft. The fighter jets passed over the ravaged Pentagon building, however it was not until hours later that they would find out <b>that</b> <b>United</b> 93 had already gone down in a field outside Shanksville, Pennsylvania, killing all 44 people aboard including the 4 hijackers.|$|E
5|$|The 1926 Imperial Conference {{resulted}} in the Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act 1927, and the Balfour Declaration 1926, which granted the Dominions equal status to the United Kingdom. However, laws passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom still had force in Australia, and laws passed by Australian parliaments would be invalid if they contradicted United Kingdom laws (the doctrine of repugnancy). The Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1942 ended the doctrine of repugnancy, and provided <b>that</b> <b>United</b> Kingdom laws would only have force in Australia at Australia's request.|$|E
5|$|The club {{also has}} a {{traditional}} rivalry with Sheffield United. In 1984, Sheffield United won promotion at Hull City's expense with the teams level on points and goal difference and separated only by goals scored, with 33 of United's goals scored by former Hull City striker Keith Edwards. City's {{final game of the}} season against Burnley had been rescheduled due to bad weather and took place after their promotion rivals had finished their campaign; Hull went into the game knowing that a three-goal victory would mean promotion, but in front of a crowd which included a number of United fans could manage only a 2–0 win, ensuring <b>that</b> <b>United</b> went up instead.|$|E

5|$|These defeats in {{cup finals}} at Hampden Park {{led to the}} Scottish {{football}} media claiming <b>that</b> <b>United</b> suffered from a Hampden hoodoo, as they had failed to win ten cup finals played at the ground between 1974 and 1991. When the club reached the 1994 Scottish Cup Final, manager Ivan Golac dismissed talk of the hoodoo, even though opponents Rangers were strong favourites to complete a domestic treble in the 1993–94 season. United broke the supposed hoodoo and won the Scottish Cup {{for the first time}} when Craig Brewster's goal gave them a 1–0 win.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} {{the first}} half, nearing the halftime break, came an unusual string of {{reckless}} challenges from Toronto right back, Mikael Yourassowsky, on loan from Croatian side Rijeka. In the 36th minute of play, Yourassowsky was carded for a reckless challenge on Andy Najar, and a minute later was given a second yellow and subsequently ejected for doing a similarly mistimed tackle on Chris Pontius. It would not be until the 62nd minute <b>that</b> <b>United</b> were able to capitalize on the shorthanded Toronto, restoring parity at 2–2 thanks a goal from Ngwenya. The draw gave D.C. United the cup title.|$|E
5|$|Upon its {{description}} in 1999, Ambondro was {{interpreted as a}} primitive relative of Tribosphenida (marsupials, placentals, and their extinct tribosphenic-toothed relatives). In 2001, however, an alternative suggestion was published <b>that</b> <b>united</b> it with the Cretaceous Australian Ausktribosphenos and the monotremes (the echidnas, the platypus, and their extinct relatives) into the clade Australosphenida, which would have acquired tribosphenic molars independently from marsupials and placentals. The Jurassic Argentinean Asfaltomylos and Henosferus and the Cretaceous Australian Bishops were later added to Australosphenida, and new work on wear in australosphenidan teeth has called into question whether these animals, including Ambondro, did have tribosphenic teeth. Other paleontologists have challenged this concept of Australosphenida, and instead proposed that Ambondro is not closely related to Ausktribosphenos plus monotremes, or that monotremes are not australosphenidans and that the remaining australosphenidans are related to placentals.|$|E

5|$|After the Liberation of Bulgaria and the {{establishment}} of the Principality of Bulgaria and Eastern Rumelia in 1878, Mutkurov settled in Eastern Rumelia, where he joined the provincial police or militia. He served first with the 1st Plovdiv Battalion and thereafter with the general staff. As an eminent man of arms in Eastern Rumelia, Mutkurov {{was one of the main}} leaders of the Bulgarian unification on 6 September 1885, the bloodless revolution <b>that</b> <b>united</b> the Principality of Bulgaria and Eastern Rumelia. Mutkurov joined the Bulgarian Secret Revolutionary Central Committee which stood behind the unification. At the time a captain, along with Dimitar Rizov he was envoyed to the Bulgarian monarch Prince Alexander of Battenberg. The two were received by the prince in Shumen, where they notified him of the forthcoming events and requested his approval. The prince did not wish to be publicly involved in an anti-Ottoman revolution, and is unclear whether he at all believed a revolution was likely to break out in Eastern Rumelia so soon. During the revolution, Mutkurov commanded some of the troops that surrounded the residence of the provincial governor Gavril Krastevich and demanded his resignation.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, a 1–1 draw in Villarreal and a 3–0 win at the Emirates Stadium secured Arsenal's {{status as}} United's semi-final opponents. The draw had {{determined}} <b>that</b> <b>United</b> would play {{the first leg}} at home, and after Rooney, Tevez and Ronaldo had early chances, John O'Shea opened the scoring, firing home a Michael Carrick cross after Arsenal had failed to clear a corner. United continued to make chances throughout the game, but despite Arsenal making a couple of chances themselves, the match finished at 1–0 and United travelled to the Emirates Stadium a week later needing only to avoid defeat {{to become the first}} defending champions to reach the final since Juventus in 1997. Although Arsenal only needed to overturn a one-goal deficit, their chances of victory were drastically reduced within the first 11minutes of the match; Park Ji-sung took advantage of a slip by Kieran Gibbs to double United's aggregate lead in the eighthminute, before Ronaldo fired home a 41-yard free kick in the 11th minute. With two away goals on the United scoreboard, Arsenal now had to score four goals to reach the final. However, it was United who scored the next goal, as they hit Arsenal on the break and Ronaldo scored within 15 seconds of Arsenal losing the ball {{at the other end of}} the pitch. 15minutes from time, Arsenal were awarded a penalty kick after Darren Fletcher brought Cesc Fàbregas down in the penalty area, a foul for which Fletcher was sent off – although replays showed that Fletcher knocked the ball away from Fàbregas immediately before bringing him down, resulting in some controversy as to whether Fletcher deserved a red card for the foul. Robin van Persie scored the penalty to make the score 3–1, but it was not enough to prevent United from reaching the final unbeaten for the third time in their history.|$|E
5|$|The {{draw for}} the quarter-finals paired United with Porto, against {{whom they had}} played in the first {{knockout}} round of the 2003–04 competition. The draw also determined the semi-final pairings, with United or Porto drawn to play against Arsenal or Villarreal. The first leg of the quarter-final was played at Old Trafford, giving Porto the chance to put the pressure on Manchester United with an away goal. That away goal came in the fourth minute of the game, but Wayne Rooney equalised tenminutes later and Carlos Tevez gave United {{the lead in the}} 85thminute. However, with only oneminute left in the game, United suffered a defensive lapse, allowing Mariano González to score Porto's second away goal. Those away goals meant <b>that</b> <b>United</b> travelled to the Estádio do Dragão in Porto needing a win or a score-draw of 2–2 or higher to remain in the competition. A 40-yard goal from Ronaldo in the sixthminute put United into the lead, and although both sides pressed for another goal, it proved to be {{the only one of the}} game, making Manchester United the first English side to win in Porto.|$|E
