5|$|Both {{bacteria}} and eukaryotes, but not archaea, make spores. Some species of Haloarchaea undergo phenotypic switching and grow as several different cell types, including thick-walled structures that {{are resistant to}} osmotic shock and allow the archaea to survive in water at low salt concentrations, but <b>these</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> reproductive structures and may instead help them reach new habitats.|$|E
5|$|Canada's federal {{structure}} divides government responsibilities {{between the}} federal government and the ten provinces. Provincial legislatures are unicameral and operate in parliamentary fashion similar to the House of Commons. Canada's three territories also have legislatures, but <b>these</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> sovereign and have fewer constitutional responsibilities than the provinces. The territorial legislatures also differ structurally from their provincial counterparts.|$|E
50|$|<b>These</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> all {{concurrently}} existing positions.|$|R
50|$|Many of <b>these</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> {{published}} {{until the}} 1860s.|$|R
50|$|If <b>these</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> involved, 144 and 145 {{would have}} become 644 and 645.|$|R
5|$|Catholics {{who have}} {{committed}} to religious or consecrated life instead of marriage or single celibacy, as a state of life or relational vocation, include 54,559 male religious, 705,529 women religious. <b>These</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> ordained, nor generally considered ministers unless also engaged {{in one of the}} lay minister categories above.|$|E
5|$|Complainants {{must have}} {{exhausted}} all domestic remedies, and anonymous complaints and complaints referring to events which occurred before the country concerned joined the Optional Protocol are not permitted. The Committee can request information from and make recommendations to a party, though <b>these</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> binding.|$|E
5|$|Dedicated British Airways 'Galleries First' lounges are {{available}} at some airports. The exclusive 'Concorde Room' lounges at Heathrow Terminal 5 and New York JFK airports offer pre-flight dining with waiter service and more intimate space. Business lounges are used where <b>these</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> available.|$|E
50|$|<b>These</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> {{inherited}} from Quenderin but resulted from vocalic reduction, under accentual laws.|$|R
5000|$|<b>These</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> {{his only}} realizations. With regard to restorations, {{have to be}} mentioned: ...|$|R
50|$|Only major, known {{functions}} {{are listed in}} this list; knowledge about <b>these</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> complete.|$|R
5|$|For {{the same}} reason, the version {{history of a}} {{distributed}} revision control system generally has {{the structure of a}} directed acyclic graph, {{in which there is a}} vertex for each revision and an edge connecting pairs of revisions that were directly derived from each other. <b>These</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> trees in general due to merges.|$|E
5|$|In 1982 a {{collection}} of out-takes and rehearsal recordings from the 1972–1975 hiatus was released (initially on cassette only), called Time Vaults. <b>These</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> studio-quality recordings.|$|E
5|$|Intermediate birds occur {{where the}} {{recognised}} forms meet and interbreed, and have sometimes been given subspecies status, including S. b. kreczmeri in Poland and S. b. pateffi in Bulgaria, but <b>these</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> generally accepted as valid taxa.|$|E
25|$|Unlike the 2004 results, <b>these</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> {{grouped into}} {{qualitative}} bands such as Good, Poor, etc.|$|R

25|$|Following the publication, Engel set up {{meetings}} {{to answer questions}} though <b>these</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> well attended.|$|R
5|$|Madagascar and Iveland-Evje {{region in}} Norway have the only {{deposits}} of minerals with high scandium content, thortveitite (Sc,Y)2(Si2O7) and kolbeckite ScPO4·2H2O, but <b>these</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> being exploited.|$|E
5|$|Parallel {{computers}} can be roughly classified {{according to the}} level at which the hardware supports parallelism. This classification is broadly analogous to the distance between basic computing nodes. <b>These</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> mutually exclusive; for example, clusters of symmetric multiprocessors are relatively common.|$|E
5|$|The exact instants of {{equinoxes}} or solstices are {{the times}} when the apparent ecliptic longitude (including the effects of aberration and nutation) of the Sun is 0°, 90°, 180°, or 270°. Because of perturbations of Earth's orbit and peculiarities of the calendar, the dates of <b>these</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> fixed.|$|E

50|$|The {{county was}} also split into twelve parishes; <b>these</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> used for {{administrative}} purposes after 1929.|$|R
5|$|Watts and Gardiner {{credit the}} ship with three spar torpedoes {{as well as}} three towed torpedoes, but <b>these</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> {{mentioned}} by Wright or Silverstone.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively, prey animals {{might be}} {{sufficiently}} gregarious to form clusters tight enough {{to enhance the}} warning signal. If the species was already unpalatable, predators might learn to avoid the cluster, protecting gregarious individuals with the new aposematic trait. Gregariousness would assist predators to learn to avoid unpalatable, gregarious prey. Aposematism could also be favoured in dense populations even if <b>these</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> gregarious.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>these</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> {{found on}} Earth naturally, boron forms {{a variety of}} stable {{compounds}} with formal oxidation state less than three. As for many covalent compounds, formal oxidation states are often of little meaning in boron hydrides and metal borides. The halides also form derivatives of B(I) and B(II). BF, isoelectronic with N2, cannot be isolated in condensed form, but B2F4 and B4Cl4 are well characterized.|$|E
5000|$|About 20,000 {{of each of}} <b>these</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> {{used for}} {{overprinting}} with [...] "Poczta Polska" [...] in 1918.|$|R

30|$|The {{comments}} were also coded on other characteristics. <b>These</b> <b>were</b> references to similar solutions, references to other participants, {{information on the}} intended context of use, and comments on good details in the design. The first three of <b>these</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> included in the following analysis, as each of them covered less than 10 % {{in any of the}} cases. The last of <b>these</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> included as the inter-rater agreement for this characteristic was too low.|$|R
5|$|Arboreal frogs have pads {{located on}} the ends of their toes to help grip {{vertical}} surfaces. <b>These</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> suction pads, the surface consisting instead of columnar cells with flat tops with small gaps between them lubricated by mucous glands. When the frog applies pressure, the cells adhere to irregularities on the surface and the grip is maintained through surface tension. This allows the frog to climb on smooth surfaces, but the system does not function efficiently when the pads are excessively wet.|$|E
5|$|At {{standard}} temperature and pressure, thorium is slowly attacked by water, {{but does not}} readily dissolve in most common acids, {{with the exception of}} hydrochloric acid, where it dissolves leaving a black insoluble residue of ThO(OH,Cl)H. It dissolves in concentrated nitric acid containing a small amount of catalytic fluoride or fluorosilicate ions; if <b>these</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> present, passivation can occur, as with uranium and plutonium.|$|E
5|$|B. coccinea is a {{host for}} the gall midge Dasineura banksiae, {{a species of}} fly that attacks and lays eggs on the leaves between late October and early December. The round white hairy galls are 5–7mm in {{diameter}} and generally contain one larva, or up to five on severely infested plants. The larvae moult and feed until January to March, when they reduce activity until early October. Although <b>these</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> harmful to the plant, they disfigure the cut foliage and hence reduce its value.|$|E
