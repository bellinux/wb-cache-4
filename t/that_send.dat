5|$|A {{telecommunications}} network {{is a collection}} of transmitters, receivers, and communications channels <b>that</b> <b>send</b> messages to one another. Some digital communications networks contain one or more routers that work together to transmit information to the correct user. An analog communications network consists of one or more switches that establish a connection between two or more users. For both types of network, repeaters may be necessary to amplify or recreate the signal when it is being transmitted over long distances. This is to combat attenuation that can render the signal indistinguishable from the noise.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of neurons {{in the deep}} nuclei have large cell bodies and spherical dendritic trees with a radius of about 400μm, and use glutamate as their neurotransmitter. These cells project {{to a variety of}} targets outside the cerebellum. Intermixed with them are a lesser number of small cells, which use GABA as a neurotransmitter and project exclusively to the inferior olivary nucleus, the source of climbing fibers. Thus, the nucleo-olivary projection provides an inhibitory feedback to match the excitatory projection of climbing fibers to the nuclei. There is evidence that each small cluster of nuclear cells projects to the same cluster of olivary cells <b>that</b> <b>send</b> climbing fibers to it; there is strong and matching topography in both directions.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not only}} {{receptive}} fields that define the microzone structure: The climbing fiber input from the inferior olivary nucleus is equally important. The branches of a climbing fiber (usually numbering about 10) usually activate Purkinje cells belonging to the same microzone. Moreover, olivary neurons <b>that</b> <b>send</b> climbing fibers to the same microzone tend to be coupled by gap junctions, which synchronize their activity, causing Purkinje cells within a microzone to show correlated complex spike activity on a millisecond time scale. Also, the Purkinje cells belonging to a microzone all send their axons to the same small cluster of output cells within the deep cerebellar nuclei. Finally, the axons of basket cells are much longer in the longitudinal direction than in the mediolateral direction, causing them to be confined largely to a single microzone. The consequence of all this structure is that cellular interactions within a microzone are much stronger than interactions between different microzones.|$|E

50|$|Formally, the map <b>that</b> <b>sends</b> a {{vector space}} to its {{symmetric}} algebra is a functor from vector spaces over K to commutative algebras over K, {{and is a}} free object, meaning that it is left adjoint to the forgetful functor <b>that</b> <b>sends</b> a commutative algebra to its underlying vector space.|$|R

On {{the other}} hand, the permutation <b>that</b> <b>sends</b> 1 to 3, 3 to 1, 2 to 4 and 4 to 2 {{is not a}} cyclic permutation because it separately permutes the pairs {1, 3} and {2, 4}.|$|R
5|$|The James Bay {{hydroelectric}} dam complex contains several {{relatively short}} 735kV power lines <b>that</b> <b>send</b> electricity to three principal substations, ordered from west to east: Radisson, Chissibi, and Lemoyne. From these substations, six 735kV power lines traverse the vast expanses of taiga and boreal forest in clear-cut stretches of land; this shows up clearly in aerial photos. The terrain {{that the power}} lines cross is {{for the most part}} not mountainous, but smooth and replete with lakes. Generally, four of the lines runs together in two pairs and the other two run solo, although the two single lines sometimes do run in a pair. Two intermediate 735kV power lines, one in the north and one in the south, connect all six power lines along their path to southern Quebec.|$|E
5|$|The entire {{puddled iron}} {{armature}} designed by Gustave Eiffel was replaced. Low-carbon corrosion-resistant {{stainless steel bars}} that now hold the staples next to the skin are made of Ferralium, an alloy that bends slightly and returns to its original shape as the statue moves. To prevent the ray and arm making contact, the ray was realigned by several degrees. The lighting was again replaced—night-time illumination subsequently came from metal-halide lamps <b>that</b> <b>send</b> beams of light to particular parts of the pedestal or statue, showing off various details. Access to the pedestal, which had been through a nondescript entrance built in the 1960s, was renovated to create a wide opening framed {{by a set of}} monumental bronze doors with designs symbolic of the renovation. A modern elevator was installed, allowing handicapped access to the observation area of the pedestal. An emergency elevator was installed within the statue, reaching up {{to the level of the}} shoulder.|$|E

Because the neural activity {{at any one time}} is modelled by independent bits, Hopfield suggested that a dynamical Ising model would provide a first approximation to a neural network which is capable of learning.|$|E
25|$|Functions <b>that</b> <b>send</b> {{integers}} to integers, or finite strings to finite strings, {{can sometimes}} be defined by an algorithm, which gives a precise description {{of a set of}} steps for computing the output of the function from its input. Functions definable by an algorithm are called computable functions. For example, the Euclidean algorithm gives a precise process to compute the greatest common divisor of two positive integers. Many of the functions studied in the context of number theory are computable.|$|E

25|$|In many animals, {{aggression}} can {{be linked}} to pheromones released between conspecifics. In mice, major urinary proteins (Mups) have been demonstrated to promote innate aggressive behavior in males, and can be mediated by neuromodulatory systems. Mups activate olfactory sensory neurons in the vomeronasal organ (VNO), a subsystem of the nose known to detect pheromones via specific sensory receptors, of mice and rats. Pheremones have also been identified in fruit flies, detected by neurons in the antenna, <b>that</b> <b>send</b> a message to the brain eliciting aggression; it has been noted that aggression pheremones have not been identified in humans.|$|E

25|$|Nest mates must {{communicate}} with each other in order to perform necessary tasks such as nest building and foraging. Some colonies have diffuse connections where each individual is just as likely to interact with any other. On the other hand, some colonies have very high connectedness between a subset of workers <b>that</b> <b>send</b> out communications {{to the rest of the}} colony. Polistes instabilis is an example of these types of colonies, where a few dominant workers seem to induce others to forage. This occurs by dominance interactions mentioned in previous sections. Individuals will do gaster wagging, wing vibrations, or other aggressions in order to assert their dominance and tell subordinates to forage. Therefore more dominant workers will tend to do tasks inside the nest.|$|E
25|$|The {{pharmacodynamics}} of AAS are unlike peptide hormones. Water-soluble peptide hormones cannot {{penetrate the}} fatty cell membrane and only indirectly affect {{the nucleus of}} target cells through their interaction with the cell’s surface receptors. However, as fat-soluble hormones, AAS are membrane-permeable and influence the nucleus of cells by direct action. The pharmacodynamic action of AAS begin when the exogenous hormone penetrates the membrane of the target cell and binds to an androgen receptor (AR) located in the cytoplasm of that cell. From there, the compound hormone-receptor diffuses into the nucleus, where it either alters the expression of genes or activates processes <b>that</b> <b>send</b> signals {{to other parts of}} the cell. Different types of AAS bind to the AAR with different affinities, depending on their chemical structure. Some AAS such as metandienone bind weakly to this receptor in vitro, but still exhibit AR-mediated effects in vivo. The reason for this discrepancy is not known.|$|E

Set and prop designers included Wayne White, Pendleton Ward, Rebecca and Steven Sugar, and Guy Davis, while live and practical special effects were planned by Adam Savage.
