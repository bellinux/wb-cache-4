60|$|There {{were many}} things in Battle's hut {{gathered}} together for traffic and pleasure in his journey: a great necklace of Gunga's or Pongo's teeth; a bagful of Cassary beads, which change colour with the hour, a bolt-eyed Joojoo head, a bird-billed <b>throwing-knife,</b> also beads of Estridges' eggs, {{as large as a}} small melon. There was also, what Battle cherished very carefully, a little fat book of 566 pages and nine woodcuts that his mother had given him before setting out on his hapless voyagings, with a tongue or clasp of brass to keep it together. Moreover, Battle gave Nod a piece of looking-glass, the like of which he had never seen before. And the little Mulgar would often sit sorrowfully talking to his image in the glass, and bid the face that there answered his own be off and find his brothers. And Nod, in return, gave Battle for a keepsake the little Portingal's left-thumb knuckle-bone and half the faded Coccadrillo saffron which old Mishcha had given to him.|$|E
50|$|The green Fuusha-shuriken, or Windmill <b>Throwing-Knife,</b> fires large shuriken {{in either}} four or eight {{different}} directions, {{depending on the}} weapon's powerup level. The stars are flaming at higher levels. Useful for when many enemies are {{coming in from the}} front and sides. This weapon is new to Dennin, and as mentioned replaces the ability to give the sideships commands.|$|E
6000|$|On they stormed, {{shouting}} their war-cry, [...] "Twala! Twala! Chiele! Chiele!" [...] (Twala! Twala! Smite! Smite!) [...] "Ignosi! Ignosi! Chiele! Chiele!" [...] answered our people. They {{were quite}} close now, and the tollas, or <b>throwing-knives,</b> began to flash backwards and forwards, {{and now with}} an awful yell the battle closed in.|$|R
50|$|Machete wore a {{bulletproof}} Kevlar {{flak jacket}} {{with a variety}} of pockets and pouches for carrying various weapons, particularly <b>throwing-knives.</b> He wore custom-made combat boots with additional weapons pouches; the remainder of his costume consisted of conventional military surplus items. Machete carried a variety of specially manufactured weighted steel throwing knives, two three-foot machetes, and other items as necessary. Additionally, his costume's gloves were equipped with strong electromagnets to help him retrieve his weapons in case he was disarmed.|$|R
60|$|They hesitated, {{and finally}} stopped their advance; {{there was no}} eagerness to cross spears with these three grim ranks of warriors who stood so firm and ready. Presently, however, a tall general, wearing the {{customary}} head-dress of nodding ostrich plumes, appeared, attended {{by a group of}} chiefs and orderlies, being, I thought, none other than Twala himself. He gave an order, and the first regiment, raising a shout, charged up towards the Greys, who remained perfectly still and silent till the attacking troops were within forty yards, and a volley of tollas, or <b>throwing-knives,</b> came rattling among their ranks.|$|R
50|$|The arcade version can {{be played}} by up to two players alternating. The game's {{controls}} consist of an eight-way joystick and two action buttons. Similarly to Kung-Fu Master and Rush'n Attack, the player jumps by holding the joystick upwards instead of having a dedicated jump button like other side-scrolling action games. Instead, one button is used to swing the sword at enemies {{and the other to}} hold the shield to block enemy attacks, including projectiles such as <b>throwing-knives</b> and arrows. The shield can be held towards the player while standing or crouching, as well as upwards vertically and diagonally. Some enemies will throw magic balls which cause the player to lose their sword and shield if they block. During these instances, the player will fight barehanded, with the sword and shield buttons used to punch and kick respectively. The sword and shield will appear on-screen after some time, allowing the player to recover them. Power-ups include floating hearts that restore the player's health and jumping spots where the player can jump higher than usual.|$|R
6000|$|We {{rose and}} dressed {{ourselves}} for the fray, each {{putting on his}} chain armour shirt, for which garments at the present juncture we felt exceedingly thankful. Sir Henry went the whole length about the matter, and dressed himself like a native warrior. [...] "When you are in Kukuanaland, do as the Kukuanas do," [...] he remarked, as he drew the shining steel over his broad breast, which it fitted like a glove. Nor did he stop there. At his request Infadoos had provided him with {{a complete set of}} native war uniform. Round his throat he fastened the leopard-skin cloak of a commanding officer, on his brows he bound the plume of black ostrich feathers worn only by generals of high rank, and about his middle a magnificent moocha of white ox-tails. A pair of sandals, a leglet of goat's hair, a heavy battle-axe with a rhinoceros-horn handle, a round iron shield covered with white ox-hide, and the regulation number of tollas, or <b>throwing-knives,</b> made up his equipment, to which, however, he added his revolver. The dress was, no doubt, a savage one, but I am bound to say that I seldom saw a finer sight than Sir Henry Curtis presented in this guise. It showed off his magnificent physique to the greatest advantage, and when Ignosi arrived presently, arrayed in a similar costume, I thought to myself that I had never before seen two such splendid men.|$|R
