5|$|The Democratic nominating {{convention}} {{began on}} June 20, at the Music Hall on Market Street in Louisville. The {{first order of}} business was to nominate a convention chairman. Ollie M. James, a supporter of Stone, nominated Judge David Redwine. When Woodson seconded the nomination, the deal between Stone and Goebel became apparent to all. Hardin supporters nominated William H. Sweeney, but the Stone-Goebel alliance elected Redwine. The membership of several county delegations was challenged; these cases would be decided by <b>the</b> <b>credentials</b> committee. This committee was also stacked against Hardin; his supporters made up just four of the thirteen members. Prolonged deliberations by <b>the</b> <b>credentials</b> committee caused the delegates to become restless, and hundreds of people—both delegates and non-delegates—entered the Music Hall attempting to disrupt the convention. When Redwine summoned Louisville city police to the hall to maintain order, Hardin supporters accused him of using intimidation tactics. <b>The</b> <b>credentials</b> committee finally issued its report on June 23. Of the twenty-eight cases where delegates were contested, twenty-six of them were decided in favor of Goebel or Stone supporters.|$|E
5|$|The 1896 Republican National Convention convened at the Wigwam, a {{temporary}} structure in St. Louis, on June 16. With most credentials battles settled in McKinley's favor, {{the roll of}} delegates drawn up by the RNC heavily favored the Ohioan, though Reed, Allison, Morton and Quay remained in the race. <b>The</b> <b>credentials</b> report served as a test vote, which the McKinley forces won easily. Hanna, who was a delegate from Ohio, was in full control of the convention.|$|E
5|$|Dunderdale {{announced}} her candidacy for the PC Party leadership on December 30, 2010, and {{was endorsed by}} her entire caucus. While she originally stated she would step down as premier if she {{decided to run for}} the leadership after announcing her candidacy Dunderdale said she will only step down if someone challenges her for the leadership. On January 10, 2011, an hour before nominations were set to close in the leadership election Brad Cabana, a blogger and a former mayor in Saskatchewan, filed his nomination papers becoming Dunderdale's only challenger. The next day however the PC Party's credentials committee announced that Cabana was ineligible to enter the race because he was unable to collect the 50 signatures needed by PC party members to be nominated. Cabana appealed the party's decision but it was announced on January 27, 2011, that the rules committee upheld the previous ruling by <b>the</b> <b>credentials</b> committee. With Cabana being ineligible to run Dunderdale was officially named the leader-designate, she was sworn in as leader at the party's convention on April 2, 2011.|$|E
30|$|Conversely, if <b>the</b> <b>credential</b> {{is stored}} with the issuer, {{then we should}} use the {{top-down}} approach. In that case, Z would begin at X and know {{that it needs to}} contact Y next when it sees <b>the</b> <b>credential</b> X → Y.

50|$|Counterfeiting of {{credentials}} is {{a constant}} and serious problem, irrespective of <b>the</b> type of <b>credential.</b> A great deal of effort goes into finding methods to reduce or prevent counterfeiting.

5|$|The Union Greenback {{convention}} had reconvened {{at nearby}} Farwell Hall and sent an emissary to the National Greenbackers. The delegates voted {{to join the}} other faction in a special conference committee to work for reunification, then adjourned until 7:30 that evening. While {{they waited for the}} committees to finish their work, the delegates listened to speeches by several prominent Greenbackers, including Denis Kearney, a California labor leader, and William Wallace, a Canadian parliamentarian and advocate for currency reform. Meanwhile, <b>the</b> <b>Credentials</b> Committee voted narrowly to admit the Union Greenbackers, as well as a delegation from the Socialist Labor Party. The Committee on Permanent Organization voted to recommend Richard F. Trevellick, a Michigan trade union organizer, as the permanent chairman of the convention. None of the reports were finished by the appointed time, so the convention adjourned again until 10:45 Thursday morning.|$|E
5|$|Between the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness, Mr. Prospector, Cup Bearer, Ecole Etage, Champagne Charlie, and Step Nicely, none of {{whom had}} run in the Derby, were all named as {{possible}} entrants. Three horses, Secretariat, Sham, and Our Native, all raced in the Kentucky Derby two weeks prior. On May 15, seven owners confirmed their intentions to enter their horses by paying a US$1,000 deposit. The horses officially registered that day were Our Native, Secretariat, and Sham, along with new runners Deadly Dream, Ecole Etage, The Lark Twist, and Torsion. A day later, Deadly Dream's trainer stated that he was unsure about racing his colt because he felt the horse could not match Secretariat, Sham, or Our Native. In addition, The Lark Twist's owner Larry Boyce scratched his horse from the race because he received word that Our Native registered, dropping {{the total number of}} horses competing to six. However, on the 17th, Boyce attempted to re-enter The Lark Twist, but was denied under the Rules of Racing of Maryland which stated that the scratching of a horse was irreversible. An Associated Press article commented that <b>the</b> <b>credentials</b> of Secretariat and Sham could lead to the running being one of the smallest since 1964.|$|E

25|$|The Estates-General {{convened in}} the Grands Salles des Menus-Plaisirs in Versailles on 5 May 1789 and {{opened with a}} three-hour speech by Necker. The Third Estate demanded that <b>the</b> <b>credentials</b> of deputies should be {{verified}} by all deputies, rather than each estate verifying <b>the</b> <b>credentials</b> of its own members, but negotiations with the other estates failed to achieve this. The commoners appealed to the clergy, who asked for more time. Necker then stated that each estate should verify its own members' credentials and that the king should act as arbitrator.|$|E
50|$|In {{contract}} theory, signaling (or signalling: see Spelling differences) is {{the idea}} that one party (termed the agent) credibly conveys some information about itself to another party (the principal). For example, in Michael Spence's job-market signalling model, (potential) employees send a signal about their ability level to the employer by acquiring education <b>credentials.</b> <b>The</b> informational value of <b>the</b> <b>credential</b> comes from <b>the</b> fact that the employer believes <b>the</b> <b>credential</b> is positively correlated with having greater ability and difficult for low ability employees to obtain. Thus <b>the</b> <b>credential</b> enables <b>the</b> employer to reliably distinguish low ability workers from high ability workers.|$|R

40|$|Purpose - The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) {{recently}} {{proposed a}} global consulting credential involving a diverse set of professions including accountancy, business law, and information technology. The proposal was widely debated {{in the professional}} literature, and was a divisive issue among CPAs. In late 2001, the AICPA membership voted against any further commitment to <b>the</b> <b>credential.</b> <b>The</b> {{purpose of this paper}} is to examine <b>the</b> global <b>credential</b> initiative in an effort to understand why professional jurisdictional claims may fail at the theorization stage. Design/methodology/ approach - The paper relies primarily on a qualitative review and analysis of archival materials and published articles and commentaries relating to <b>the</b> global <b>credential</b> project. Findings - The analysis indicates that the AICPA failed to establish either the pragmatic or moral legitimacy of <b>the</b> proposed <b>credential</b> in <b>the</b> eyes of the audiences. This failure appears to be attributable to the sociopolitical environment in which <b>the</b> <b>credential</b> was promoted, and to flaws in the rhetoric used by the AICPA to articulate its jurisdictional claim. Research limitations/implications - The paper demonstrates the importance of legitimacy to the ability to successfully theorize institutional changes. Originality/value - This paper investigates how the AICPA theorized <b>the</b> global <b>credential</b> knowledge claim, and how theorization failed to persuade the audiences to support <b>the</b> <b>credential...</b>|$|R

25|$|Prior to the 1912 Republican National Convention in Chicago, Roosevelt {{expressed}} {{doubt about}} his prospects for victory, noting that Taft had more delegates {{and control of}} <b>the</b> <b>credentials</b> committee.
