25|$|Munroe {{had then}} made a {{business}} out of making lead pencils. He made the graphite formula for his pencils in secret, with only {{the help of his}} wife. The business was quite successful. By 1814 he had made nearly 175,000 pencils, which sold for about six thousand dollars, a very large amount of money at the time. When the war with England ended there were better pencils available from Europe and his profits were erased by these better imports. Munroe figured it was pointless to try to compete against these superior products so took up his normal trade of cabinet-making. He also made tooth brushes and watchmaker's brushes, also the first made in the United States. During this interim time {{he went back to the}} drawing board to do further experimenting with his secret lead pencil paste. One <b>thing</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> another until he came up with a powdered graphite paste product that would make its mark.|$|E

2500|$|These {{are things}} {{related to the}} past and the {{environment}} I found myself in at the time. In the early '90s, there were all these different youth gangs in Norway and one <b>thing</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> another. I was involved in gang fights and had false friends [...] There was no political disposition – not with me nor any of my friends. But you had to profess allegiance to a certain group if you wanted to defend yourself and not get your ass kicked. [...] But there have definitely been changes and an evolution in my thinking. I'm a different person today.|$|E
2500|$|Roger Troutman {{developed}} [...] "I Want to Be Your Man" [...] {{around the}} theme of romantic commitment. [...] "Guys have trouble committing and women want us to commit," [...] he explained to authors Adam White and Fred Bronson. [...] "Women want us to admit that we don't want to commit." [...] Troutman took the idea and began working on a track similar in style to [...] "Computer Love," [...] a 1986 hit for his band Zapp. [...] "I was playing in Dallas and [...] flew out. We sat {{in the hotel room}} one day and wrote the song. I talked to him about what I was trying to say and one <b>thing</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> another. We came back and recorded a vocal." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{it sort of}} happened, don't you know! You {{know how}} these things ARE! Young {{yourself}} once, and all that. I was most frightfully in love, and Lu seemed to think it wouldn't be a bad scheme, and one <b>thing</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> another, and--well, there you are, don't you know!" ...|$|E
5000|$|This {{caused some}} {{aggregation}} in ARD and the EBU, the contest's organisers, because, {{due to its}} population size Germany {{was one of the}} biggest financial contributors to the contest.

If you want to know,"--Westover faltered, and then went on--"she began to be kind to you because she was afraid that you might think she didn't take your coming home second-cabin in the right way; and one <b>thing</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> another. You mustn't blame her for what's happened." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In {{some way}} we struck {{up quite a}} friendship, this young fellow and I.

One <b>thing</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> another, and it ended in his {{inviting}} me out to spend a few days at his house, Wisteria Lodge, between Esher and Oxshott. Yesterday evening I went to Esher to fulfil this engagement.|$|E
50|$|Addleshaw Booth & Co {{was formed}} in 1997 by a merger between the Leeds-based Booth & Co. and the Manchester-based Addleshaw Sons & Latham. Addleshaw Booth was a 'heavyweight' in the North of England legal sector, with offices in Leeds and Manchester.

6000|$|... "This {{matter of}} land, water, a few stray head of stock {{had to be}} decided out of court. I'm sure in his case he never {{realized}} where he was drifting. Then one <b>thing</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> another, until he was {{face to face with}} dealing that took on crooked form. To protect himself he bound men to him. And so the gang developed. Many powerful gangs have developed that way out here. He could not control them. He became involved with them.|$|E
6000|$|... "'There {{were three}} sisters altogether. The old one {{was just a}} good woman, the second was a devil, and the third was an angel. Sarah was thirty-three, and Mary was twenty-nine when I married. We were just as happy as the day was long when we set up house together, and in all Liverpool there was no better woman than my Mary. And then we asked Sarah up for a week, and the week grew into a month, and one <b>thing</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> another, until she {{was just one of}} ourselves.|$|E

5000|$|Mine {{management}} has received positive responses for its rigorous environmental effects control procedures and {{its commitment to}} the local community in terms of consultation and financial assistance. This has, amongst other <b>things,</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> the mine management company, Newmont Waihi Gold, receiving the 'Advanced Sustainable Business Award' from Environment Waikato, the Regional Council of the area.

60|$|He saw {{a danger}} in staying away too long, but his {{contract}} was {{only beginning to}} be profitable. Besides, one <b>thing</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> another, {{and a number of}} extras, for which the pay was good, had been added to the original plans. Then he had been asked to undertake another job and had arranged to go over the ground with Kerr and Norton that morning. In a way, he would sooner have left it alone, because it would keep him longer from home, but the terms offered a strong inducement to stop. Glancing at his watch, he saw it was nearly time to meet the engineers.|$|E

You see, ma'am, I've {{thought all}} along {{it was a}} bit awkward for them here, they not being so much used to looking after things, and I asked leave to come and help now and then.

Good fishing, though, here and there. Well, what I mean is, this cove was so deucedly civil, and all that, that now she won't look at anybody else.

50|$|Although large {{cats are}} not native to England, {{some people have}} kept exotic animals, and in the mid 1970s this became {{something}} of a fad. It is inevitable that some have escaped over the years, and conceivable that they created {{a small group of}} big cats living hidden in the Exmoor area's countryside. In particular, the 1976 Dangerous Wild Animals Act, which controlled the keeping of big cats (among other <b>things)</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> the mass release of many privately owned wild cats.|$|R
5000|$|In November 2008, two <b>things</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> an {{explosion}} in popularity of the Obama comic book character.

She told him how she had traced him, reproached him. One <b>thing</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> another, and then with that dagger so handy the end soon came. It wasn't all done in an instant, though, for these chairs were all swept over yonder, and he had one in his hand {{as if he had}} tried to hold her off with it.

60|$|Andrew had {{an uncomfortable}} feeling that Geraldine {{and her father}} were right. One <b>thing</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> another, and he might be drawn irresistibly into {{a long series of}} {{business}} complications, which was by no means what he had at first contemplated. Nevertheless, if his services were of any value, Allinson's had the first claim on them. He dismissed the matter when Frobisher suggested that they go in to supper. Frobisher was witty, Geraldine charmingly cordial, and it was with regret that Andrew took his leave. Geraldine walked to the pier with him and he noticed a gentleness in her face that set his heart to beating. He thought the soft dusk emphasized her beauty by etherealizing it. When they reached the steps she turned to him with a smile.|$|E
60|$|Our young gentleman's {{first words}} {{informed}} me that his discoveries, concerning the wicked Colonel and the Diamond, had begun with a visit which he had paid (before he came to us) to the family lawyer, at Hampstead. A chance word dropped by Mr. Franklin, when the two were alone, one day, after dinner, revealed {{that he had been}} charged by his father with a birthday present to be taken to Miss Rachel. One <b>thing</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> another; and it ended in the lawyer mentioning what the present really was, and how the friendly connexion between the late Colonel and Mr. Blake, senior, had taken its rise. The facts here are really so extraordinary, that I doubt if I can trust my own language to do justice to them. I prefer trying to report Mr. Franklin's discoveries, as nearly as may be, in Mr. Franklin's own words.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first law}} on legal {{abortion}}s {{was passed in}} Sweden in 1938 when the law legalised abortion on a very limited scale, and only on serious medical consideration, after evaluation by the Royal Board of Health. From 1946 abortions could also be permitted on social medicinal grounds. During the 1960s a successive change in Swedish society took place and the general attitude towards sexuality, as well as abortion, became more liberal. This, among other <b>things,</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> {{an increase in the}} number of permitted abortions.|$|R
50|$|Linkletter {{was famous}} for {{interviewing}} children on House Party and Kids Say the Darndest <b>Things,</b> which <b>led</b> <b>to</b> a series of books quoting children. He became a naturalized United States citizen in 1942.|$|R
50|$|The Ducks toured {{throughout}} the United States during the 1980s, doing live shows at colleges and similar venues, {{in addition to}} their radio work. In 1986 they released an LP on Rounder Records titled Born To Be Tiled. In 1989, the group released a feature film, Zadar! Cow From Hell. Unfortunately, the film failed to capture the humor of the group's stage shows and radio sketches, and was not well received by audiences or critics. This disappointment, among other <b>things,</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> the group members turning to separate projects after 1990.|$|R
