25|$|Opposition to Sergius {{was used}} as a pretext to close many churches and sending clergy to exile. The last officially {{functioning}} anti-Sergiite church in Moscow was closed in 1933 and in Leningrad in 1936. After these churches were closed, they were usually demolished or turned to secular use (rather than being given to Sergii's jurisdiction as though <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>really</b> being closed simply for the reason of their opposition to Sergii). This campaign greatly diminished the number of functioning churches in the country.|$|E
25|$|The founders {{original}} {{plan was to}} sell the mineral corundum to manufacturers in the East for making grinding wheels. After selling one load, on June 13, 1902, the five went to the Two Harbors office of company secretary John Dwan, which was {{on the shore of}} Lake Superior and is now part of the 3M National Museum, and signed papers making Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing a corporation. In reality, however, Dwan and his associates were not selling what they thought; <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>really</b> selling the worthless mineral anorthosite.|$|E

25|$|In August of {{the year}} 423, Honorius died and power was seized in the west by Joannes, who had held the office of Primicerius Notariorum. Joannes appears to have ushered {{in a period of}} {{religious}} toleration. Joannes seems to have attempted to curb the power of ecclesiastics and the privileges of the church in an attempt to treat all people equally. In the year 423, Theodosius II published a law that demanded that Christians (whether <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>really</b> such or pretended to be so) were not to disturb pagans who were living peaceably and doing nothing contrary to the law.|$|E
25|$|Anticipating a press furore, it {{was decided}} to shoot the wedding in a church in private grounds where the press would not have access. However the press still turned up in large numbers, and {{security}} men had to be hired to keep cameramen away from the story action. Huge lorries were {{parked in front of the}} entrance to the church so that nothing could be seen, and the cast arrived in disguise. Finally strong lights were shone into the eyes of the journalists and photographers, making them extremely angry, and they constantly tried to gain access to the grounds by breaking the security barrier and telling the production team that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>really</b> extras needed inside the church.|$|E
25|$|Suchorzewski, {{with several}} other opponents of the constitution, {{departed}} to Saint Petersburg in the Russian Empire, where {{he became one of}} the founding members and high-ranking officials (konsyliarz) of the Confederation of Targowica. Derdej speculated that out of all those who signed the act of the Confederation, Suchorzewski was the only one who might have thought <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>really</b> acting in the country's best interest. He commanded a cavalry brigade in the Confederation forces during the War in Defense of the Constitution that the Confederates eventually won, overthrowing the Constitution. During the Kościuszko Insurrection he was sentenced, in absentia, to a death by hanging, eternal infamy, loss of all titles and confiscation of possessions. His effigy was hanged on the 29 September 1794.|$|E

In 2005, Westenra visited Ghana to publicise her project, [...] "Bikes for Ghana", and actively helped with fundraising to purchase bicycles for young girls, allowing them {{to get to their}} schools from outlying surrounding areas. When she was later interviewed about this charity work, she had this to say: [...] "I met girls who had been given bikes and I could see how much it meant to them.

Oleg Budnitskii, historian at the Higher School of Economics in Moscow, told a BBC Radio programme that Red Army soldiers were astounded when they reached Germany. [...] "For the first time in their lives, eight million Soviet people came abroad, the Soviet Union was a closed country. All they knew about foreign countries was there was unemployment, starvation and exploitation.

500|$|In 1889 Myers {{purchased}} the Gates Mansion Victorian style house with five acres of property that was located near Frankfort, New York, previously owned by Fred Gates of the Diamond Match Company. Here Myers {{and his wife}} went {{into the business of}} manufacturing passenger balloons and specialty purpose gas balloons, many for the US government. The balloons that had just been assembled were partially inflated outdoors to test if they held the hydrogen gas properly. Because of the large balloons half inflated and laid out on the property grounds, it gave the impression they were growing large mushrooms or some unusual new farm crop. In time some people realized <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>really</b> making balloons and it became known as the Frankfort [...] "balloon farm." ...|$|E
500|$|The Navy's Task Force 77 {{took its}} orders via 7th Fleet from CINCPAC, a Navy admiral based in Honolulu, through his subordinate, the Air Force {{commander}} of Pacific Air Forces (PACAF). Due to their influence, the Navy {{could not be}} persuaded to integrate its air operations over North Vietnam {{with those of the}} Air Force. General William Momyer, commander of the Seventh, had the impression that CINCPAC and PACAF wanted to keep the Thai-based aircraft out of his hands. [...] "By denying Momyer, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>really</b> denying Westmoreland and keeping air operations against the DRV under their control." [...] To complicate matters, the U.S. ambassadors to Thailand (Graham Martin) and Laos (William H. Sullivan) exerted undue influence over operational and command arrangements.|$|E

[...] At least 15, and possibly as many as 19 cardinal-nephews were later elected pope (Gregory IX, Alexander IV, Adrian V, Gregory XI, Boniface IX, Innocent VII, Eugene IV, Paul II, Alexander VI, Pius III, Julius II, Leo X, Clement VII, Benedict XIII, and Pius VII, perhaps also John XIX, Benedict IX, if <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>really</b> promoted cardinals, as well as Innocent III and Benedict XII, if in fact they were related to their elevators).

We like to create an adventure and this has been an adventure. [...] This is what we were supposed to do. And I doubted the idea up until the very last minute, but the process has been phenomenal."

They were captured by a Dakota tribe in 1680. [...] While with the tribe, they came across and named the Falls of Saint Anthony. Soon, Du Lhut negotiated to have Hennepin's party released from captivity. [...] Hennepin returned to Europe and wrote a book, Description of Louisiana, published in 1683, about his travels where many portions (including the part about Saint Anthony Falls) were strongly embellished. [...] As an example, he described the falls as being a drop of fifty or sixty feet, when <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>really</b> only about sixteen feet. [...] Pierre-Charles Le Sueur explored the Minnesota River to the Blue Earth area around 1700. [...] He thought the blue earth {{was a source of}} copper, and he told stories about the possibility of mineral wealth, but there actually was no copper to be found.|$|E
