25|$|On many {{automobile}} engines, {{including all}} Chrysler Group and General Motors products, <b>the</b> <b>thermostat</b> does not restrict {{flow to the}} heater core.

25|$|A {{thermostat}} is {{a device}} for regulating {{the temperature of}} a system so that the system's temperature is maintained near a desired setpoint temperature. <b>The</b> <b>thermostat</b> does this by switching heating or cooling devices on or off, or regulating the flow of a heat transfer fluid as needed, to maintain the correct temperature. <b>The</b> <b>thermostat</b> was invented in 1883 by Warren S.

Polymer brushes in relative sliding motion, polymeric liquids in Poiseuille and Couette flows, and brush-melt interfaces are used as model systems to analyze the efficiency and limitations of different Langevin and DPD thermostat implementations.

25|$|The {{illustration}} is {{the interior}} of a common two wire heat-only household thermostat, used to regulate a gas-fired heater via an electric gas valve. Similar mechanisms may also be used to control oil furnaces, boilers, boiler zone valves, electric attic fans, electric furnaces, electric baseboard heaters, and household appliances such as refrigerators, coffee pots and hair dryers. The power through <b>the</b> <b>thermostat</b> is provided by the heating device and may range from millivolts to 240 volts in common North American construction, and is used to control the heating system either directly (electric baseboard heaters and some electric furnaces) or indirectly (all gas, oil and forced hot water systems).

50|$|In classic {{molecular}} dynamics, simulations {{are done}} in the microcanonical ensemble; a number of particles, volume, and energy have a constant value.

25|$|Modern {{thermostat}} control {{was developed in}} the 1830s by Andrew Ure (1778–1857), a Scottish chemist, who invented <b>the</b> bi-metallic <b>thermostat.</b> <b>The</b> textile mills of the time needed a constant and steady temperature to operate optimally, so to achieve this Ure designed <b>the</b> bimetallic <b>thermostat,</b> which would bend as one of the metals expanded in response to the increased temperature and cut off the energy supply.|$|R
25|$|One of {{the first}} {{industrial}} uses of <b>the</b> <b>thermostat</b> was in the regulation of the temperature in poultry incubators.

25|$|When flow {{starts from}} the {{uppermost}} outlet, cold water enters the tank at the bottom.

25|$|Water {{and steam}} based central heating systems have {{traditionally}} had overall control by wall-mounted bi-metallic strip thermostats. These sense the air temperature using the differential expansion of two metals to actuate an on/off switch. Typically the central {{system would be}} switched on when the temperature drops below the set point on <b>the</b> <b>thermostat,</b> and switched off when it rises above, with a few degrees of hysteresis to prevent excessive switching. Bi-metallic sensing is now being superseded by electronic sensors. A principal use of the bi-metallic thermostat today is in individual electric convection heaters, where control is on/off, based on the local air temperature and the set point desired by the user. These are also used on air-conditioners, where local control is required.|$|E
25|$|Notice {{that this}} kinematical {{discussion}} does not {{delve into the}} mechanism by which the required forces are generated. That {{is the subject of}} kinetics.
