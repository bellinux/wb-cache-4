5|$|In {{two weeks}} of {{fighting}} {{in and around the}} fortress, <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> were able to gradually push back the UN forces from Ka-san and Hills 755 and 314 to the south, but the UN forces held out strongly and <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> were not able to quickly consolidate their gains. The UN forces defended the ground tenaciously, even assigning a battalion of engineers to fight on the front lines, eventually preventing <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> from advancing long enough for a UN counterattack at Inchon which drove <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> from the area.|$|E
5|$|On August 17, <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> {{resumed their}} attack. A {{battalion}} of North Korean troops drove the ROK police out of T'ongyong {{but did not}} hold it long. UN naval forces heavily shelled T'ongyong as three companies of ROK Marines from Koje Island made an amphibious landing near the town. The ROK force then attacked <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> and, supported by naval gun fire, drove them out. <b>The</b> <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> at T'ongyong lost about 350 men, the survivors withdrew to Chinju.|$|E
5|$|Some historians contend {{the goals}} of <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> at the Pusan Perimeter were {{unattainable}} from the beginning. According to historian T. R. Fehrenbach, the Americans, who had been better equipped than <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Koreans,</b> were easily able to defeat their opponents once they {{had the chance to}} form a continuous line. At the same time, <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> did break through the perimeter at several points and were able to exploit their gains for a short time. Within a week, though, the momentum of the offensive had been slowed and <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> could not keep up the strength of their attacks. Most of the front saw only probing actions {{for the remainder of the}} battle.|$|E
5000|$|Shortly after <b>the</b> incident, <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> media began airing {{reports of}} <b>the</b> fight. <b>The</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> version stated: ...|$|R

In response, the US X Corps {{under the command of}} Major General Edward Almond managed to cripple <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> forces at Wonju, and the UN forces later carried out a number of anti-guerrilla operations against <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> infiltrators. In <b>the</b> aftermath of <b>the</b> battle, <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> forces on <b>the</b> central and the eastern fronts were decimated, allowing the UN front to be stabilized at the 37th parallel.|$|R
5|$|What {{followed}} was a two-week battle around Tabu-dong and Waegwan in which <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> {{were able to}} gradually push the 1st Cavalry Division back from its lines. However, <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> {{were not able to}} force the US troops to withdraw completely or push the UN out of Taegu. When the UN counterattacked at Inchon, <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> were forced to abandon their attack on Tabu-dong.|$|E
5|$|After 2-27th Infantry {{had left}} the Chung-ni area on September 2 in its attack toward G Company, <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> {{attacked}} the 24th Infantry command post and several artillery positions. To meet this new situation, General Kean ordered the remaining battalion of the 27th Infantry, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel George H. DeChow, to attack and destroy <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> operating there.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> {{then moved}} against Taejon. On July 19, North Korean forces entered Taejon, {{the site of}} the 24th Infantry Division's headquarters. Dean {{personally}} led the division in its stand at Taejon. <b>The</b> <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> quickly surrounded the city and moved in from the west, north and south.|$|E

40|$|In this Essay, I first briefly present {{theoretical}} contexts {{that may}} aid in defining <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> legal system. Next, I trace {{the evolution of}} <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> legal system by examining <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> reaction to various legal influences of the Japanese occupation, Soviet tutelage, and traditional Korean practices, and outline the current politico-legal structure. In the final section, I inquire whether <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> legal structure can accommodate a different legal system necessitating rule-of-law requirements, as applied to its foreign investment regime and, perhaps some day, nationwide. Although {{the main purpose of}} this Essay is to introduce <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> legal system to the unacquainted, I posit further that the legal system cannot inherently process rule-of-law syntax, so that any eventual interface will begin to corrode <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> legal system as we know it today...|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> were {{apparently}} {{unaware of the}} 1st Battalion withdrawal, because the next morning, July 25, two North Korean battalions in a double envelopment came in behind the positions 1st Battalion held the night before, but in front of Major Gordon E. Murch's 2nd Battalion. There <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> {{were caught in the}} open by the combined fire of American tanks, artillery, and mortar, and the 2nd Battalion's automatic and small arms fire. <b>The</b> <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> suffered large numbers of casualties in this attack. Surviving remnants of the two North Koreans battalions withdrew in confusion. The 2nd Battalion took about 30 prisoners.|$|E
5|$|The UN {{units were}} able to defeat and repel <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> repeatedly, {{including}} through a coordinated offensive across the entire perimeter. In delaying and pushing back <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Koreans,</b> the 25th Infantry Division {{was able to buy}} time for UN forces to counterattack at Inchon, effectively defeating the North Korean Army at the Pusan Perimeter.|$|E
5|$|An initial UN counteroffensive out of Masan proved {{ineffective}} in stopping <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> from advancing. In the subsequent fight, the 35th Infantry {{was able to}} repel <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> at the Battle of Nam River and were highly regarded for these actions. However, the 24th Infantry performed very poorly at the battles of Blue Mountain and Haman, forcing the 25th Division to muster reserves to counter the North Korean gains against the 24th.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> Navy is used {{to defend}} <b>the</b> waters of <b>North</b> Korea. However, not much is known about <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> navy and what {{equipment}} is used.|$|R
5|$|The {{fight was}} one of the first {{victories}} for American forces in repelling <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> advance. In stopping <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> advance at <b>the</b> Notch and around Masan, the UN forces were able to halt the progress of <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> 4th and 6th Divisions, grounding their flanking moves to a halt and forcing them to withdraw to rebuild and re-supply. In the meantime, the American forces along the perimeter were being reinforced by heavier infantry and armor formations every day. <b>The</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> defeat and retreat around the Masan region allowed both sides several critical days of reprieve from battle. This would end when <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> force began its final offensive on the UN forces in its coordinated assault on the Pusan Perimeter.|$|R
500|$|<b>The</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> flag of {{convenience}} has also garnered significant scrutiny. In 2003, <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> freighter Pong-su reflagged to Tuvalu {{in the middle of}} a voyage shortly before being seized by Australian authorities for smuggling heroin into that country. That year, thirteen nations began monitoring vessels under <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> flag for [...] "illicit cargos like drugs, missiles or nuclear weapon fuel." ...|$|R
5|$|In {{the evening}} of July 23, 1st Battalion sent a 30-man patrol northward to locate <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Koreans.</b> Near Poun, the patrol spotted a North Korean column approaching. The platoon took up {{superior}} positions and ambushed the column as it passed with all its weapons. <b>The</b> <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> halted their advance, thinking they had encountered a major position, and held back until daylight. When they turned back, the US patrol returned to the 1st Battalion lines at 04:00 on July 24. It suffered six men missing to {{an unknown number of}} North Korean casualties.|$|E
5|$|On August 20, the North Korean {{commands}} distributed operations {{orders to}} their subordinate units. <b>The</b> <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> {{called for a}} simultaneous five-prong attack against the UN lines. These attacks would overwhelm the UN defenders and allow <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> {{to break through the}} lines in at least one place to force the UN forces back. Five battle groupings were ordered. The center attack called for the NK 3rd Division, NK 13th Division, and NK 1st Division break through the US 1st Cavalry Division and ROK 1st Division to Taegu.|$|E

25|$|Jang Se-yul {{supported}} the claims that <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> state {{was behind the}} Sony hacking incident. He cautioned that the U.S. should take <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> cyberwarfare threat more seriously.|$|R
5|$|<b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> {{planners}} {{intended for}} three divisions to attack Taejon from three directions, supported by tanks. <b>The</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> 3rd Division {{was ordered to}} attack from <b>the</b> <b>north,</b> against <b>the</b> flank. <b>The</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> 4th Division would attack across the Kum River from the east and south, in order to envelop Taejon and the US 24th Infantry Division with it. Eventually they would also be supported by elements of <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> 105th Armored Division. Although <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> 2nd Infantry Division was ordered to attack from Chongju against the American right flank, it was slow to move and arrived too late {{to participate in the}} battle.|$|R
50|$|The name Rimjingang is also <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> {{name for}} <b>the</b> Imjin River, which crosses {{the demilitarized zone}} and flows into South Korea from <b>the</b> <b>North.</b> One of <b>the</b> {{magazines}} <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> journalists chose this name to symbolize sending the thoughts of <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> people to their {{brothers and sisters in}} the South.|$|R

5|$|That night <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> {{launched}} a coordinated offensive against the entire UN force. The NK 6th Division advanced first, hitting F Company {{on the north}} side of the pass on the Chungam-ni-Haman road. The ROK troops in the pass left their positions and fell back on G Company south of the pass. <b>The</b> <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> captured a 75mm recoilless rifle in the pass and turned it on American tanks, knocking out two of them. They then overran a section of 82mm mortars at the east end of the pass. South of the pass, at dawn, First Lieutenant Houston M. McMurray found that only 15 out of 69 men assigned to his platoon remained with him, a mix of US and ROK troops. <b>The</b> <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> attacked this position at dawn. They came through an abandoned opening in the barbed wire perimeter. Throwing grenades and spraying the area with burp gun fire, <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> quickly overran the position. Numerous officers and non-commissioned officers attempted to get the men back into line, but they would not follow these orders. In one instance South Korean troops killed their own company commander when he tried to stop them from escaping.|$|E
25|$|<b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> People's Liberation Front {{has been}} called the most militant defectors' organization. They are {{preparing}} to cross <b>the</b> border to <b>North</b> Korea, and take arms, in a case of an uprising against <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> government. However, <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> People's Liberation Front is not the only group of defectors or <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> military members to have planned starting an armed insurgency against <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> government. An earlier attempt by defectors to start an armed fight against <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> state was stopped by South Korean and Chinese officials. Members of <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> People's Liberation Front often dress in camouflage uniforms, sunglasses and berets and carry plastic weapons in public rallies. The uniforms are similar to the ones used by South Korean special forces. The group has petitioned the South Korean government to allow them to form their own army division.|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, I {{discuss the}} {{influence}} of mutual perspectives of South and <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> from 1994 till 2015 on the reunification process. This will be done by discussing {{the perspective of the}} South <b>Korean</b> people on <b>North</b> Korea, <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> people living in <b>North</b> Korea and <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> settlers in South Korea. After that I discuss the perspective of <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> settlers on South Korea and the South Korean people. This will be followed by a discussion of the problems of <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> settlers in South Korean society, how and till what extent they are related to the perspectives of South and <b>North</b> <b>Koreans,</b> and their implications for reunification...|$|R
5|$|The Inchon {{landings}} were {{a crushing}} blow for the North Korean Army, catching it completely unprepared and breaking the already weak forces along the perimeter. With virtually no equipment, exhausted manpower and low morale, <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> {{were at a}} severe disadvantage and {{were not able to}} continue to pressure on the Pusan Perimeter while attempting to repel the landings at Inchon. By September 23, <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> were in full retreat from the Pusan Perimeter, with UN forces rapidly pursuing them north and recapturing lost ground along the way.|$|E
5|$|The North Korean People's Army {{forces were}} {{organized}} into a mechanized combined arms force of ten divisions, originally numbering some 90,000 well-trained and well-equipped troops in July, {{with hundreds of}} T-34 tanks. However, defensive actions by US and South Korean forces had delayed <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> significantly in their invasion of South Korea, costing them 58,000 of their troops {{and a large number}} of tanks. In order to recoup these losses, <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> had to rely on less-experienced replacements and conscripts, many of whom had been taken from the conquered regions of South Korea. During the course of the battle, <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> raised a total of 13 infantry divisions and one armored division to the fight at Pusan Perimeter.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> {{attacked}} Haman {{daily for}} the next week. Following the repelling of North Korean infiltration on September 7, the North Korean attack on Haman ground to a halt. <b>The</b> <b>North</b> <b>Koreans,</b> racked by logistical and manpower shortages, focused more heavily on their attacks against 24th Infantry positions on Battle Mountain, as well as 35th Infantry positions at the Nam River. 24th Infantry troops at Haman encountered only probing attacks until September 18.|$|E
