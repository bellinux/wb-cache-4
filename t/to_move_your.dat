500|$|Uncuts and The Guardians reviews {{were less}} enthusiastic. Uncut {{commented that the}} album sounds dry and superficial, and the songs are too similar {{to each other and}} other Franz Ferdinand songs. The Guardian stated that [...] "if Franz's songwriting is broader than it was, it is still no deeper" [...] and that [...] "they'll keep trying <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>your</b> hips because they know they'll never win your heart." [...] This was echoed by the review in the Daily Mail, which {{described}} the album as [...] "a sterile, unwelcoming affair that fails to pack the band's usual punch." [...] Paste was similarly severe, stating that the vocals are [...] "leering", the production [...] "horrific", and that the lyrics [...] "seem to lack both heart and brain" [...] and conclude by writing that [...] "the layoff suggests that Franz is either too confused or too lazy to move forward".|$|E
2500|$|The {{sense of}} agency (SA), or sense of control, is the {{subjective}} awareness of initiating, executing, and controlling one's own volitional {{actions in the}} world. It is the pre-reflective awareness or implicit sense that it is I who is executing bodily movement(s) or thinking thoughts. In normal, non-pathological experience, the SA is tightly integrated with one's [...] "sense of ownership" [...] (SO), which is the pre-reflective awareness or implicit sense that one {{is the owner of}} an action, movement or thought. If someone else were <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>your</b> arm (while you remained passive) you would certainly have sensed that it were your arm that moved and thus a sense of ownership (SO) for that movement. However, you would not have felt that you were the author of the movement; you would not have a sense of agency (SA).|$|E

60|$|However, {{all this}} has nothing to do with Macaulay's glorious lays, save that when you want some flowers of manliness and patriotism you can pluck quite a bouquet out of those.

6000|$|The passage, after {{ascending}} {{to a point}} which Archie {{judged to}} be nigh a hundred feet above {{the floor of the}} cave, narrowed to a mere hole, but two feet high and as much wide. Up this he crawled for a distance of four or five yards, then it narrowed suddenly to a hole three or four inches in diameter, and through this, some three feet farther, Archie could see the daylight through a clump of heather. He backed himself down the narrow passage again until he joined his comrades. [...] "Now," [...] he said, [...] "do four of you stay here, and take it by turns, one after the other, to enlarge the hole forward to the entrance. As you scrape the earth down you must past it back handful by handful. Do not enlarge the outer entrance or disturb the roots of the heather growing there.
