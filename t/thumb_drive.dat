25|$|In {{the middle}} of the {{controversy}} and court appeal, Panahi broke the ban imposed on him from making films and made the documentary feature This Is Not a Film (2011) in collaboration with Iranian filmmaker Mojtaba Mirtahmasb. This film was made for €3,200 and shot on a digital camcorder and, partly, an iPhone. It was shot in four days over a ten-day period in March 2011 and its title was inspired by René Magritte's painting The Treachery of Images. In the film, Panahi sits in his apartment making phone calls about his court case, watching TV news stories, interacting with his neighbors, talking about his past films and describing scenes from the film that he had begun shooting when he was arrested (much as he had described scenes from films to his sisters as a child). Ten days before the opening of the 2011 Cannes Film Festival, This Is Not a Film was announced as a surprise entry into the festival. It was smuggled out of Iran on a USB <b>thumb</b> <b>drive</b> that had been hidden inside a cake. Panahi's wife and daughter attended the festival. In December 2012 it was shortlisted as one of 15 films eligible for Best Documentary Feature at the 85th Academy Awards.|$|E
500|$|USB Key Mode: The user must {{insert a}} USB device that {{contains}} a startup key into the computer {{to be able to}} boot [...] the protected OS. Note that this mode requires that the BIOS on the [...] protected machine supports the reading of USB devices in the pre-OS [...] environment. [...] The key may also be provided by a CCID for reading a cryptographic smartcard. [...] Using CCID provides additional benefits beyond just storing the key file on an external USB <b>thumb</b> <b>drive,</b> because the CCID protocol hides the private key using a cryptographic processor embedded in the smartcard; this prevents the key from being stolen by simply being read off the media on which it is stored.|$|E

[...] The appellate court {{also found that the}} trial court erred in concluding that Aleynikov lacked [...] "intent to appropriate," [...] holding that the evidence [...] "permits a rational inference that defendant intended to exercise permanent control over the use of Goldman's source code, as opposed to a short-term borrowing."
