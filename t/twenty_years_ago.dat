5|$|Harry and Debbie punish Annie by not {{allowing}} {{her to go to}} Naomi's party. When they reconsider and decide to let her go, they discover that she has already left. Harry goes to the party to find Annie, but is instead told by Tracy that they have a son together, whom she gave up for adoption over <b>twenty</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> Adrianna, who had previously stolen money from Naomi's purse, claims to have found it and gives it back. Naomi checks her phone messages and learns that Ethan is cheating on her. Naomi asks Ethan if he is really cheating on her, and leaves the party after he fails to answer. Annie leaves with Silver for another party on the beach, where she apologizes to Ethan for revealing that he was cheating on Naomi. When she asks why he told the truth about Dixon not starting the fight, he replies that he is trying to be the good guy he used to be. Annie, Silver, Dixon and Navid {{spend the rest of the}} night swimming at the beach. In the closing scenes, Kelly talks to the father of her four-year-old son, Adrianna pays her drug dealer with money she stole from Naomi, and Ethan visits Naomi's house.|$|E

25|$|As of 2010, North Carolina housed {{approximately}} {{ten million}} hogs, {{most of which}} are located in the eastern half of the state in industrialized CAFOs or Confined Animal Feeding Operations. This was not the case <b>twenty</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> The initial horizontal integration and the vertical integration that arose in this industry resulted in numerous issues, including issues of environmental disparity, loss of work, pollution, animal rights, and overall general public health. The most remarkable example of swine CAFO monopoly is found in the United States, where in 2001, 50 producers had control over 70% of total pork production. In 2001, the biggest CAFO had just over 710,000 sows.|$|E

With the growth and development of new social forces in that period, a powerful camp made its appearance in the bourgeois-democratic revolution, a camp consisting of the working class, the student masses and the new national bourgeoisie. Around the time of the May Fourth Movement, hundreds of thousands of students courageously took their place in the van. In these respects the May Fourth Movement went a step beyond the Revolution of 1911.|$|E

40|$|Cellulose {{decomposition}} in soils amended over <b>twenty</b> <b>year</b> <b>ago</b> {{with heavy}} metal-contaminated sewage sludges {{was assessed by}} using the cotton-strip assay. The soils of the Luddington Experiment now contain concentrations of Cu, Ni and Zn in selected plots that approximate to or exceed the statutory limits for these elements in sewage sludge-amended soils. The rates of cellulose decomposition were generally lower in the plots with elevated metal concentrations, relative to uncontaminated sludge-amended and unsludged controls. Generally, the metal-rich plots showed reductions in the time taken to reach 50 % cotton-tensile-strength loss (CTSL). However, the reductions could not be consistently related to any one metal. The difference in decomposition rates between treatments was systematically reduced over the duration of a time-course experiment.

40|$|Glasser's {{disease in}} swine {{is caused by}} Haemophilus parasuis, a Gram-negative {{bacterium}} of the family Pasteurellaceae, which colonizes the upper respiratory tract of pigs. This disease has originally been considered a sporadic and stress-associated disease of young pigs. However, the development of pig industry has led to increased incidences and mortality rates of this disease in commercial swine production worldwide. There has been a gravely progress in the research of H. parasuis since the pathogen was identified <b>twenty</b> <b>year</b> <b>ago.</b> These include: 1) development of various methods to type H. parasuis from serotype to genotype; 2) identification of many virulence factors; 3) further understanding the aetiology and epidemiology of H. parasuis and 4) establishment of an exact procedure to diagnose the pathogen.
