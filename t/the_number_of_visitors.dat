5|$|In {{the fifth}} century AD, Chinese {{traveller}} Fa Xian made reference to <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>visitors</b> to Pushkar Lake.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>visitors</b> increased, {{including}} Queen Victoria and Charles Dickens. Work {{was undertaken}} during the 19th century {{to protect the}} stonework from further decline, with particular efforts to remove ivy from the castle in the 1860s.|$|E

50|$|During the 2016 Pokémon Go fad, <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> local <b>visitors</b> increased, {{reducing}} <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> suicidal <b>visitors</b> to <b>the</b> Tojinbo cliffs.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>visitors</b> to <b>the</b> SAM rose steadily, with 410,000 in 1935, 428,000 in 1936, 487,000 in 1937 and 535,000 in 1938.|$|R
5|$|Before the {{construction}} of I-70 the San Rafael Swell was relatively inaccessible and not well known or explored. There were, however, a few efforts to protect the swell as early as 1935. Since {{the construction}} of the freeway <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>visitors</b> to the swell has increased significantly, as the swell can now be accessed by automobile. As such, several groups are increasing efforts for protected status of the area, via National Park, National Monument or wilderness designation.|$|E
5|$|During {{that same}} year, {{a series of}} {{scalding}} cases, including an incident in which a senior citizen diabetic lost six toes to gangrene after soaking in the hot spring, prompted the Singapore General Hospital to warn that people with nerve disorders or diseases affecting blood circulation should be cautious to hot mineral springs. As a result of some negative rumors and hearsay, and the RSAF redevelopment, public interest began to wane and <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>visitors</b> dwindled.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} half of the 19th and early 20th centuries the pier was popular both with locals and {{tourists}} to the town. As a boarding point for steamers plying their trade in the Bristol Channel, it underwent various extensions and modifications over the years. During the Second World War the pier was commissioned as HMS Birnbeck by the Admiralty as part of the Directorate of Miscellaneous Weapons Development (DMWD) for research into new weapons. The pier reopened after the war, but <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>visitors</b> and steamer passengers declined. The final excursion visited the pier in 1979.|$|E
50|$|The architects {{had also}} built an inn nearby in {{traditional}} East Prussian style. <b>The</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>visitors</b> {{did not meet}} expectations initially but during the Nazi era <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> were such that the inn required to be extended.|$|R
50|$|The North Stand is {{sponsored}} by Corsan. The North Stand area closest to the East Stand is the usual location of visiting fans. Depending on <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>visitors,</b> <b>the</b> availability <b>of</b> seats {{in this area are}} expanded westwards to meet demand.|$|R
50|$|Natuurmonumenten is {{responsible}} for the management of the national park and Rijkswaterstaat for coastal protection. One of the aims of the management is to make the dunes more dynamic.

5|$|In postwar Poland, the {{government}} bought {{most of the}} land where the camp had stood, and built a large stone memorial there between 1959 and 1962. In 1964 Treblinka was declared a national monument of Jewish martyrology in a ceremony {{at the site of the}} former gas chambers. In the same year the first German trials were held regarding war crimes committed at Treblinka by former SS members. After the end of communism in Poland in 1989, <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>visitors</b> coming to Treblinka from abroad increased. An exhibition centre at the camp opened in 2006. It was later expanded and made into a branch of the Siedlce Regional Museum.|$|E
5|$|By the 1820s, {{visitors}} could {{purchase an}} early guidebook {{at the site}} outlining the castle's history, and Victorian tourists recorded being charged six-pence to wander around the castle. In the early 1820s, the antiquarian Sir Samuel Rush Meyrick attempted to purchase the site, {{with the aim of}} converting the castle back into a private dwelling, but was unable to convince the owners to sell. Instead, Meyrick built the neo-gothic Goodrich Court in a similar style next door, which greatly displeased Wordsworth when he returned to Goodrich in 1841 and found the view spoilt by the new building. The new bridge over the river Wye, built in 1828, and the 1873 railway line added to <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>visitors.</b>|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the lack}} of {{easy access to the}} ranch and any lodging in the area, {{tourists}} flocked to this site. The 1887 completion of the Southern Pacific line increased <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>visitors,</b> as the railroad featured the ranch in its advertisements in order to distinguish the line from its competitors. Although the ranch was not developed for tourism, the Del Valles, with their Californio sense of hospitality, would lodge the visitors. By October 1888, housing visitors was getting to be so expensive for the family that Reginaldo del Valle pressed his mother to stop being so hospitable. The tourists could be quite a nuisance, and unscrupulous visitors would steal items from the house as souvenirs, or help themselves to fruit from the orchards.|$|E
40|$|An {{integrative}} suicide {{prevention program}} was implemented to tackle an outbreak <b>of</b> <b>visitor</b> charcoal burning suicides in Cheung Chau, {{an island in}} Hong Kong, in 2002. This study evaluated the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> program. <b>The</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>visitor</b> suicides reduced from 37 deaths in the 51 months prior to program implementation to 6 deaths in the 42 months post-implementation period. <b>The</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>visitor</b> suicide pacts decreased from 7 pacts (15 individuals) to 1 pact (2 individuals). No statistically significant differences in <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>visitor</b> suicide attempts and resident suicides were observed in the two time periods. No statistically significant changes in visitor suicides {{during the study period}} were observed on the comparison islands. The consistency and timing <b>of</b> reduction in <b>visitor</b> suicides correlated with the development and delivery of the integrative program on the intervention island, suggesting a causal association between program delivery and reduction <b>of</b> <b>visitor</b> suicides. The possibility of displacement seems small because there was no increase in visitor suicides on the comparison islands during the study period. This integrative approach in preventing target- specific suicides may serve as an example for other communities to develop suicide prevention programs that make use of the existing local resources. © 2009 The American Association of Suicidology. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
5000|$|The {{domestic}} tourism {{market is}} estimated at $63 billion. [...] In 2009, the Australian domestic market experienced a 10% slump in <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>visitor</b> nights. Domestic tourism in general and in particular free caravan and camping sites for overnight accommodation experienced strong demand in 2012.|$|R
5000|$|Conversion Rate. The {{conversion}} rate of an Internet marketing campaign is <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> website <b>visitors</b> who complete a desired action, divided by <b>the</b> total <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>visitors.</b> For example, if 10,000 visitors {{come to a}} PPC landing page and 500 submit the page's inquiry form, the {{conversion rate}} is 5 percent.|$|R
5|$|In 2010, the {{television}} series Hawaii Five-0 chose Battleship Cove, a housing community {{just outside the}} dock of the USS Missouri museum, as the location for an episode. The episode, with police cars racing down Tennessee and Nevada Streets, featured a number of Ford Island homes and some residents appeared as extras. That year, Peter Berg featured the USS Missouri in the film Battleship. The ship, which was towed off Ford Island for maintenance, was brought out to sea between completion of the maintenance and its return to the dock for filming. Michael Carr, president of the Battleship Missouri Memorial, hoped that the film would spike <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>visitors</b> to the Ford Island museum.|$|E
5|$|In the 2010s {{there has}} been a {{significant}} expansion of tourist facilities, culminating in the opening of the 240-room Comwell Hotel in July 2014, which increased the number of hotel rooms in the city by 25%. Some estimates put <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>visitors</b> spending at least one night as high as 750,000 a year, most of them Danes from other regions, the remainder coming mainly from Norway, Sweden, northern Germany and the United Kingdom. Overall, they spend about DKK 3billion ($540million) in the city each year. The primary motivation for tourists choosing Aarhus as a destination is experiencing the city and culture, family and couples vacation or {{as a part of a}} round trip in Denmark. The average stay is little more than three days on average.|$|E
5|$|Isolated and {{difficult}} to reach, the monument initially attracted few visitors, by 1920 only 1,800 for the year. The situation changed markedly when large numbers of Americans began to travel by automobile on roads paid for largely with government funds. One highway connected Grants Pass with the California coast at Crescent City. Another new road, the Oregon Caves Highway, led from the Grants Pass – Crescent City highway to the cave. Campaigns to attract car-driving tourists included those of the Cavemen, a booster group from Grants Pass that dressed in animal skins, posed along tour routes, and staged annual events to promote the monument. By 1928, <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>visitors</b> to the cave had risen to about 24,000 a year.|$|E

5|$|Most of {{the tombs}} are {{not open to}} the public (18 of the tombs can be opened, but they are rarely open at the same time), and {{officials}} occasionally close those that are open for restoration work. <b>The</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>visitors</b> to KV62 has led to a separate charge for entry into the tomb. The West Valley has only one open tomb—that of Ay—and a separate ticket is needed to visit this tomb. The tour guides are no longer allowed to lecture inside the tombs, and visitors are expected to proceed quietly and in single file through the tombs. This is to minimize time in the tombs and prevent the crowds from damaging the surfaces of the decoration. Photography is no longer allowed in the tombs.|$|E
5|$|The Washington Monument {{attracted}} enormous crowds {{before it}} officially opened. For {{six months after}} its dedication, 10,041 people climbed the 898 steps and 50 landings to the top. After the elevator {{that had been used}} to raise building materials was altered to carry passengers, <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>visitors</b> grew rapidly, and an average of 55,000 people per month were going to the top by 1888. The annual visitor count peaked between 1979 and 1997, where an average of 1.1 million visitors visited annually; however, from 2005 to 2010, the Washington Monument has had an average of only 631,000 visitors each year. As with all historic areas administered by the National Park Service, the national memorial was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966.|$|E
5|$|The temple has {{undergone}} several major renovations {{due to its}} age and damage by an avalanche. In the 17th century, the temple was expanded by the Kings of Garhwal. After significant damage in the great 1803 Himalayan earthquake, it was largely rebuilt by the King of Jaipur. It was still under renovation {{as late as the}} 1870s but these were completed {{by the time of the}} First World War. At that time, the town was still small, consisting of only the 20-odd huts housing the temple's staff, but the number of pilgrims was usually between seven and ten thousand. The Kumbh Meld festival held every twelve years raised <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>visitors</b> to 50,000. The temple also enjoyed revenue from the rents owed to it by various villages bequeathed by various rajas.|$|E

5|$|As Harvey's {{interests}} {{shifted to}} the Pyramid, Monte Ne's resort days effectively ended and <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>visitors</b> slowly dwindled. Activities and events at Monte Ne continued, supported by locals who still visited in large numbers. Harvey sold the Hotel Monte Ne. The hotel went through several name changes and owners, becoming the White Hotel circa 1912, the Randola Inn in 1918, the Hotel Frances in 1925, and in 1930 the Sleepy Valley Hotel. Monte Ne's larger hotels continued to be active after they, along with the dance pavilion and Elixir Spring, were foreclosed and sold at public auction. From 1927 to 1932, Missouri Row and Oklahoma Row (often called the Club House Hotels at this point) were home to the Ozark Industrial College and School of Theology, a nonsectarian school run by Dan W. Evans. The hotels housed pupils—Missouri Row for boys, Oklahoma Row for girls—and Oklahoma Row also provided classroom and dining spaces. Evans and his family lived in the tower. The dance pavilion was enclosed and served as the school chapel. In May 1932, following a mortgage foreclosure against the school, school officials were evicted and the property was sold.|$|E
5|$|UNESCO {{identified}} three {{specific areas of}} concern under {{the present state of}} conservation: (i) vandalism by visitors; (ii) soil erosion in the south-eastern part of the site; and (iii) analysis and restoration of missing elements. The soft soil, the numerous earthquakes and heavy rains lead to the destabilization of the structure. Earthquakes are by far the most important contributing factors, since not only do stones fall down and arches crumble, but the earth itself can move in waves, further destroying the structure. The increasing popularity of the stupa brings in many visitors, most of whom are from Indonesia. Despite warning signs on all levels not to touch anything, the regular transmission of warnings over loudspeakers and the presence of guards, vandalism on reliefs and statues is a common occurrence and problem, leading to further deterioration. As of 2009, there is no system in place to limit <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>visitors</b> allowed per day or to introduce mandatory guided tours only.|$|E
5|$|The Berlin Wall was a {{specific}} {{piece of the}} Inner Border that became the physical embodiment of the Iron Curtain that stood between East Germany and West Germany in the decades following the conclusion of World War II. The Berlin Wall stretched approximately 28 miles (45km) through the city of Berlin and another 75 miles (120km) {{around the edges of}} West Berlin and stood close to 15 feet (5 meters) in height. The sheer physical stature of the Berlin Wall in addition to becoming an iconic, international symbol of the Cold War and its virtues, drove it to become a popular site of tourism throughout its existence, and even after its dismantling. Tourism of the Berlin Wall reached its height in 1961, although an exact number cannot be given for <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>visitors</b> to the Berlin Wall, as there were no official records of tourism to the site made at the time. Estimates, however, are provided through the counting of tourists by Western and Eastern border guards. The numbers obtained from the border guards suggest that Berlin Wall tourism was a popular outing for German people and foreigners alike, it is reported that the Berlin Wall received approximately 1.65 million tourists in 1969 alone, with around 23,000 of those being foreign visitors. Day trips were the most popular of the ways to visit the Berlin Wall, which could be conducted even through organized tours that were governmentally funded, so long as they were presented as educational in nature.|$|E
