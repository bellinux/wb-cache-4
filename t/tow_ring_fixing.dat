25|$|In its {{simplest}} form, {{consisting of}} a <b>ring</b> <b>fixed</b> in {{the plane of the}} equator, the armilla {{is one of the most}} ancient of astronomical instruments. Slightly developed, it was crossed by another <b>ring</b> <b>fixed</b> in the plane of the meridian. The first was an equinoctial, the second a solstitial armilla. Shadows were used as indices of the sun's positions, in combinations with angular divisions. When several rings or circles were combined representing the great circles of the heavens, the instrument became an armillary sphere.|$|R
50|$|The low {{tow hitch}} {{position}} and small <b>tow</b> <b>ring</b> means {{they were really}} only suitable for towing behind an M7, as they dragged at quite an angle when hitched to a Weasel. An M7 tractor could tow two loaded M19 trailers on solid going such as an ice or snow-covered road, and when rougher ground was to be traversed it would drop one unit and shuttle them across the rougher ground one at a time.|$|R

50|$|It is a {{combination}} of the above two types of compounding. The total pressure drop of the steam is divided into a number of stages. Each stage consists of <b>rings</b> of <b>fixed</b> and moving blades. Each set of rings of moving blades is separated by a single <b>ring</b> of <b>fixed</b> blades. In each stage there is one <b>ring</b> of <b>fixed</b> blades and 3-4 rings of moving blades. Each stage acts as a velocity compounded impulse turbine.|$|R

50|$|In transportation, a pintle hitch {{is a type}} of {{tow hitch}} that uses a <b>tow</b> <b>ring</b> {{configuration}} to secure to a hook or a ball combination for the purpose of towing an unpowered vehicle. As a weapon mount a pintle-mount is used with machine guns as the mounting hardware that mates the machine gun to a vehicle or tripod. Essentially the pintle is a bracket with a cylindrical bottom and a cradle for the gun on top; the cylindrical bottom fits into a hole in the tripod while the cradle holds the gun.|$|R

50|$|The fixed blades act as nozzles. The steam {{coming from}} the boiler is passed to the first <b>ring</b> of <b>fixed</b> blades, where it gets {{partially}} expanded. The pressure partially decreases and the velocity rises correspondingly.

5000|$|The boat must be {{equipped}} with a ski rope and handle. The tow rope must be sufficiently long for maneuvering, with a recommended length of 75 ft (within tolerance) although length varies widely {{depending on the type}} of water skiing and the skier's skill level. Competition requirements on rope construction have changed over the years, from [...] "quarter-inch polypropylene rope" [...] in 1992 to the 2003 flexibility as long as the same specification is used [...] "for the entire event." [...] The rope and handle are anchored to the boat and played out at the stern. This anchor point on a recreation boat is commonly a <b>tow</b> <b>ring</b> or cleat, mounted on the boat's stern. For more dedicated skiers, a metal ski pylon is placed in the center of the boat in front of the engine to connect the skier. This pylon is mounted securely, since a skilled slalom skier can put a considerable amount of tension in the ski rope and the pylon.|$|R

50|$|The 28/32 cm NbW 41 was a six-barrelled rocket {{launcher}} {{mounted on a}} two-wheeled carriage. Two stabilizer arms and a spade under the <b>towing</b> <b>ring</b> served to steady the carriage while firing. It used two different rockets. The open metal frames of the launcher were sized to fit the 32 cm rocket, but adapter rails were provided to allow the 28 cm rockets to fit. The 28 cm Wurfkörper Spreng (Explosive missile) rocket weighed 82 kg and had a 50 kg high-explosive warhead. The 32 cm Wurfkörper Flamm (Incendiary missile) was normally filled with 50 L (45 kg) of incendiary oil (Flammöl), but could carry poison gases or decontamination fluids. The oil could cover 200 m2 Both rockets were spin-stabilized and electrically-fired. They had a prominent exhaust trail that kicked {{up a lot of}} debris, so the crew had to seek shelter before firing. This meant that they were easily located and had to displace quickly to avoid counter-battery fire. The rockets were fired one at a time, in a timed ripple, but the launcher had no capability to fire single rockets.|$|R

40|$|Stable {{surfaces}} and their log analogues are {{the type of}} varieties naturally occuring as boundary points in moduli spaces. We extend classical results of Kodaira and Bombieri to this more general setting: if (X,Δ) is a stable log surface with reduced boundary (possibly empty) and I is its global index, then 4 I(K_X+Δ) is base-point-free and 8 I(K_X+Δ) is very ample. These bounds can be improved under further assumptions on the singularities or invariants, for example, 5 (K_X+Δ) is very ample if (X,Δ) has semi-canonical singularities.

He defeated the local wrestling strongman David Forbes, and took first place which included £1 prize money. In 1860, Dinnie undertook a feat of strength that was to give birth to a long-lasting legacy. He carried two boulders, with a combined weight of 775 lbs kg, for a distance of about 5 yd, across the Potarch Bridge and back. Each boulder had an iron <b>ring</b> <b>fixed</b> to it, so that scaffolds could be attached from which workmen could repair the bridge, over the River Dee near Kincardine O'Neil.

40|$|The {{relative}} {{positions of}} the C 20 substituents in buprenorphine, particularly the hydroxyl group, have been implicated in its actions as a partial m-agonist and a k-antagonist.
