5000|$|Huckabee {{disagrees with}} aspects of John McCain/Ted Kennedy {{immigration}} reform {{but in a}} May 16, 2006 Washington Post interview he agreed with George W.

To think that we're going to go lock up 12 million people, or even round them up and drive them to the border and let them go, might make a great political speech, but it's not going to happen.

5000|$|The {{situation}} {{becomes even}} more complex when reasoning about other people's beliefs. For example, is the statement [...] "George <b>Bush</b> <b>thinks</b> conservatism is bad" [...] true or false? Bush presumably possesses some concept in his own mind, CONSERVATISM_BUSH, but the reasoner (eg. ones self) does {{not have access to}} this exact concept. If the reasoner is a liberal, it is likely that their concept CONSERVATISM_REASONER will be defined differently to that of Bush. It is likely that it will contain many properties which are bad. The reasoner can conclude that [...] "CONSERVATISM_REASONER is bad", and might even have reason to believe that if this version of the concept was explained to Bush, then <b>Bush</b> would also <b>think</b> it is bad. But the reasoner has no access to Bush's own concept and can therefore assign no deep truth value to statements about it. They might have heard Bush say [...] "conservatism is good" [...] and thus have evidence that [...] "Bush thinks CONSERVATISM_BUSH is good", but this is only a weak statement about the Fregean sense of the concept and not its (deep) referent. Concept theorists again suggest that this type of confusion could help to resolve many real-world, especially political, disagreements.|$|R

E. Holmstrom, 1948 The idea of using computers to search for relevant pieces of information was popularized in the article As We May <b>Think</b> by Vannevar <b>Bush</b> in 1945. It would appear that Bush was inspired by patents for a 'statistical machine' - filed by Emanuel Goldberg in the 1920s and '30s - that searched for documents stored on film. The first description of a computer searching for information was described by Holmstrom in 1948, detailing an early mention of the Univac computer. Automated information retrieval systems were introduced in the 1950s: one even featured in the 1957 romantic comedy, Desk Set. In the 1960s, the first large information retrieval research group was formed by Gerard Salton at Cornell. By the 1970s several different retrieval techniques had been shown to perform well on small text corpora such as the Cranfield collection (several thousand documents). Large-scale retrieval systems, such as the Lockheed Dialog system, came into use early in the 1970s.|$|R

Furthermore, although Bush discusses the compressional ability and rapidity so key to modern machines, he relates that speed will not {{be an integral part of}} Memex, stating that a tenth of a second would be an acceptable interval for its data retrieval, rather than the billionths of a second that modern computers are capable of. [...] "For Memex," [...] he writes, [...] "the problem is not swift access, but selective access". Bush states that although the code-reading and potential linking capabilities of the rapid selector would be key to the creation of Memex, there is still an issue of enabling [...] "moderately rapid access to really large memory storage". There is an issue concerning selection, Bush conveys, and despite the fact that improvements have been made in the speed of digital selection, according to Bush, [...] "selection, in the broad sense, is still a stone adze in the hands of the cabinetmaker". Bush goes on to discuss the record-making process and how Memex could incorporate systems of voice-control and user-propagated learning. He proposes a machine that could respond to [...] "simple remarks" [...] as well as build trails based on its user's [...] "habits of association," [...] as Belinda Barnet described them in [...] "The Technical Evolution of Vannevar Bush's Memex." [...] Barnet also makes the distinction between the idea of a constructive Memex and the [...] "permanent trails" [...] described in As We May <b>Think,</b> and attributes <b>Bush's</b> machine learning concepts to Claude Shannon's mechanical mouse and work with [...] "feedback and machine learning".|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} about if race has an {{impression}} on how people feel on politically issues. Using different magazines and newspaper such as {{but not limited to}} Chicago Tribune, also my research through a survey conducted on the Quad of the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign will show the reason behind the critics on Obama???s comment. After conducting my surveys and collecting data I {{have come up with a}} few opinions to my question. In the beginning my question came from a situation from MTV???s video music awards that took place two months ago. The situation consisted of Kanye West coming up on stage while Tyler Swift was receiving her award for Best Video of the Year. While Swift was on stage West comes up on stage in the middle of her acceptance speech and states that he does not agree with Swift winning the award and that he feels that Beyonce had the best video of the year and then walks off. Swift was left standing on stage speechless not only in front of the audience but on national television as well. After the statement was said President Obama stated off the record during an interview that West was an ???asshole??? for his actions. After this statement was made media attacked Obama immediately and many felt was blown out of proportion. This made me <b>think</b> if President <b>Bush</b> was to make the same statement would the outcome be the same. Was it because the President is African American that his every word and action criticized. Do people feel certain ways about politics because of their ethnicity? I then decided to conduct my research by using surveys. After collecting and filing the data I found out some answers but also new questions as well. Most people thought that many people can effect one???s political beliefs sometimes. These results tell me that if you are with a lot of people that feel one way about a subject instead of standing up about what they feel are right they will conform in fear of being different. But this also beings up the question that if someone else feels the same way will you fight for what you feel is right and voice your opinion even if you are outnumbered...|$|R
