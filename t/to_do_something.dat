For example, a child's classmate tries to dare the child to skip school. The child would apply obedience and punishment driven morality by refusing to skip school because he would get punished.|$|E

5|$|Jokes {{from earlier}} scripts were used. In one scene, Carla Tortelli orders a phone caller <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> about their unruly children.

5|$|Despite the {{positive}} response the game {{would go on}} to receive, Year of the Dragon was developer Insomniac Games' last Spyro title. In an interview, CEO Ted Price said that the company stopped producing the games because they could not do anything new with the character, and that after five years of development on a single series, the team wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> different. Future Spyro games were produced by, among other developers, Digital Eclipse, Equinox Digital Entertainment, Eurocom, Krome Studios, Étranges Libellules, and Tantalus Media.|$|E
5|$|FreeFall Stage {{discouraged}} {{people under the}} age of fifteen from attending because of {{the subject matter of the}} play, but encouraged older teenagers to attend because teenagers are at the greatest risk of being trafficked. Several human trafficking survivors attended the performances, and other survivors sent the Eldridges messages about their personal experiences with human trafficking. Quandt said that he encountered many audience members who, because of watching the play, became determined <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> to combat human trafficking.|$|E
5|$|In the 1890s {{some people}} – {{including}} the young Calogero Vizzini – decided <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> about {{the absence of}} peace and security in the countryside. The state police {{at the time was}} as much a danger as the brigands. The Villalba Mafia thus emerged as an alternative social regime centred on the membership in church-sponsored associations that generated considerable social capital. It later transformed into a protection racket, victimizing villagers and landowners alike through violence, intimidation and omertà.|$|E
5000|$|Herzberg (1987) {{describes}} the growth factors (or motivators) as [...] "achievement, recognition for achievement, the work itself, responsibility, and growth or advancement," [...] which are intrinsic. Intrinsic factors include [...] "orientations toward money, recognition, competition, and {{the dictates of}} other people, and the latter includes challenge, enjoyment, personal enrichment, interest, and self-determination." [...] The hygiene factors (or dissatisfaction-avoidance), which are extrinsic to the job, are [...] "company policy and administration, supervision, interpersonal relationships, working conditions, salary, status, and security". [...] This extrinsic factor [...] "refers <b>to</b> <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> because it leads to a distinct outcome, something external you expect to receive, and the latter refers <b>to</b> <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> because it is inherently interesting or enjoyable, an internal reward." ...|$|R

5|$|Proteins are {{essential}} to life. Cells produce new protein molecules from amino acid building blocks based on information coded in DNA. Each type of protein is a specialist that usually only performs one function, so if a cell needs <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> new, it must make a new protein. Viruses force the cell to make new proteins that the cell does not need, but are needed for the virus to reproduce. Protein synthesis consists of two major steps: transcription and translation.|$|E
5|$|The {{widespread}} anxieties and consternation over government inactivity {{throughout the}} crisis could be deflected and resolved by rescuing {{a handful of}} children. In terms of recovering a sense of agency (in a conflict characterised by protestations of powerlessness by political and military authorities alike), the desire to do (and be seen <b>to</b> <b>do)</b> <b>something</b> was expressed and assuaged by transporting and incorporating some of the need and distress into the UK where it could be tended to and made better.|$|E

5|$|Andrew Graham, {{programmer}} of {{the original}} game, had returned to university after its completion, and David Darling, co-founder of Codemasters, decided {{that they could not}} wait for him to finish his degree. Codemasters approached Peter Williamson of Supersonic Software and had him produce the sequel. Williamson had just completed Cosmic Spacehead and wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> new. It was intended for the sequel to reproduce the feeling {{of the original}} and add as many new features as possible. The original was used for reference, and the code and graphics were produced from the beginning. Williamson explained that it was hoped that they could capture and go beyond that the original game offered, and the game's success was anticipated. Darling wanted it {{to be more than a}} mere continuation of the first.|$|E

5|$|During oral argument, Justice Antonin Scalia {{responded to}} this by {{suggesting}} that some interests a person might express, such as recreational drugs, signified a willingness to violate social norms {{regardless of whether the}} conduct was illegal or not. Paul Larkin, who appeared for the government, had to admit to that there was no case law on entrapment where something that had previously been permitted was now prohibited. At one point, trying to argue that Jacobson did not have access to the defense of entrapment by estoppel (where the government persuades an actor that it is legal <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something,</b> only to prosecute them for it), Scalia told Larkin he'd lost him.|$|E
5|$|For {{eight years}} after the fire, One Meridian Plaza sat vacant and damaged—in the center of Philadelphia's {{business}} district. The building was caught in litigation between the owners and the insurance company over how much the insurers would pay the owners and how repairs or demolition would proceed. Businesses near the empty high-rise closed or moved and the city sued the owners <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> with the building. After lawsuits were settled, the building was declared a total loss and began to be dismantled in 1998. At {{the time of its}} demolition in 1999, One Meridian Plaza was the third-tallest destroyed building in the world.|$|E
5|$|He was {{diagnosed}} with paranoid schizophrenia six years before the shooting and spent fifty-three days in a mental hospital after threatening a Montana resident. He was released after testing as being of no danger to himself or anyone else. Eighteen months before the shooting, he moved back to Valmeyer from Montana. Once home, {{he was known to}} compulsively hack at trees which filled his back yard following the Mississippi River floods of 1993. There was so much downed timber on his family's homestead that they had to ask him to stop cutting at trees.

After {{the success of}} the digitised and colourised version of Mayabazar released in January 2010, its makers announced that Pathala Bhairavi would be the next film to be remastered and re-released in colour. However Goldstone Technologies decided not to remaster the remaining 14 films including Pathala Bhairavi, saying that most of the producers who sold the rights of the negatives to TV channels lost control over them, adding that there were also a lot of legal issues over ownership and copyright issues whenever other producers try <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> on their own.|$|E
