To obtain an ASBO, a two-stage test {{had to be}} satisfied by <b>the</b> <b>applicant</b> <b>authority</b> (see s.1(1) Crime and Disorder Act 1998). The first test was that the defendant had committed acts causing or likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress within {{six months of the}} date of issue of the summons.

50|$|An {{interim order}} {{may be made}} if there are {{reasonable}} grounds {{to believe that the}} subject child has suffered, or is likely to suffer, significant harm. An interim care or supervision order is commonly drafted so as to last until the conclusion of the proceedings or further order. A care order, full or interim will confer parental responsibility ("PR") upon <b>the</b> <b>applicant</b> local <b>authority</b> This does not extinguish the PR held previously by members of the child's family and thus their PR is shared with the local authority. A supervision order, interim or final, does not confer PR upon the local authority.|$|R
50|$|Some local {{residents}} also objected to Wandsworth's planning permissions for the site, (where Wandsworth were both <b>the</b> <b>applicant</b> and planning <b>authority)</b> and two permissions were quashed by the High Court in early 2013 over technicalities. The technicalities were corrected and the planning permission subsequently re-obtained. The residents made a public appeal to fund their legal challenge, raising £25,000 {{from a few}} dozen donors. The Wimbledon and Putney Commons Conservators joined forces legally with Wandsworth, appointing Wandsworth to build the roads.|$|R
5000|$|Section 106B {{contains}} {{the right of}} <b>the</b> <b>applicant</b> to appeal against the decision or non-determination of a local planning authority under s 106A to the Secretary of State. Section 106B states [...] "before determining the appeal the Secretary of State shall, if either <b>the</b> <b>applicant</b> or <b>the</b> <b>authority</b> so wish, give each of them an opportunity of appearing before and being heard by a person appointed by the Secretary of State for the purpose". It states [...] "the determination of an appeal by the Secretary of State under this section shall be final". Schedule 6 applies {{to determine how the}} appeal is heard and by whom.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the request}} of an <b>applicant,</b> <b>the</b> {{judicial}} <b>authorities</b> may issue an interlocutory injunction to prevent an [...] "imminent infringement" [...] of intellectual property rights or to prevent a continuing infringement. In the latter case, the order may be followed with a recurring penalty payment or lodging of a guarantee intended to compensate the rightholder (paragraph a). An injunction can also be issued, under the same conditions, against an intermediary, but these are covered in Article 8(2) of the Information Society Directive and are, in principle, subject to national law.|$|R
40|$|AbstractFor {{the civil}} {{aircraft}} type certification, exemptions from {{the requirements of}} specified airworthiness standards are always requested by <b>the</b> Type Certificate <b>applicants.</b> <b>The</b> paper describes the airworthiness provision and related procedures of Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) for the approval of exemptions, {{as well as its}} unique features compared with those of other main airworthiness authorities. The CAAC civil aviation regulation for a temporary or permanent exemption is firstly introduced. Based on the assignment of responsibilities of the authority, a step by step exemption management flow is demonstrated. In accordance with it, the detailed tasks should be implemented by <b>the</b> <b>applicant</b> and <b>the</b> <b>authority</b> in the process of the exemption petition, evaluation, and proposal for public comments, review and approval are illustrated, especially on the exemption approval considerations. The major differences between the exemption process of CAAC and other main airworthiness authorities are preliminarily proposed...|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>applicant's</b> legal <b>authority</b> to {{determine}} all activities within the designated exclusion area is reviewed. 10 CFR Part 100, § 100. 3 (a) requires that a reactor licensee have authority {{to determine}} all activities within the designated exclusion area, including the exclusion and removal of personnel and property. In any case where <b>the</b> <b>applicant</b> does not own all the land, including mineral rights, within the designated exclusion area, assistance {{may be required}} of the Office of the Executive Legal Director (OELD) in determining {{whether or not the}} designated exclusion area meets the requirements of 10 CFR Part 100. Also, in some cases public roads which lie within the proposed exclusion area may have to be abandoned or relocated to permit plant construction. OELD assistance may be required to assure that no legal impediments to such abandonment or relocation are likely to ensue. Part 100 permits the exclusion area to be traversed by a highway, railway, or waterway provided arrangements are made to control these areas in event of an emergency. Activities that may be permitted within the designated exclusion area, and that will not be related to routine operation of the plant, are reviewed. Review should include the type of activity, its specific location within the exclusion area, the number and kinds of persons engaged in the activity, and the frequency and length of time the activities are to be permitted. The Accident Evaluation Branch (AEB), upon request, will determine whether individuals associated with plant unrelated activi-ties within the exclusion area can be evacuated prior to receiving doses in excess of the guideline values of 10 CFR Part 100...|$|R
