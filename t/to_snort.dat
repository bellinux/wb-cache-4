25|$|A {{simple method}} {{requiring}} no specialized equipment is <b>to</b> <b>snort</b> water from cupped hands, but this clears {{little more than}} the nostrils. The application of commercially available saline nasal spray is another simple alternative, but it is relatively inefficient for washing away debris, although it may suffice for simple rehydration of mucous and tissues.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, Stoltenberg {{went into}} more detail {{about how she}} {{started out as a}} drug addict, to TV {{journalist}} Tonje Steinslandâ€“the second time her life as an addict {{was the subject of a}} television special. It started in 1991, when she was 27. She witnessed two drug addicts in a fight in a cafe in Oslo when something fell out of the pocket of one of them. She picked it up and saw that it was heroin. Together with her boyfriend she went home and decided <b>to</b> <b>snort</b> the drug. For the next three years she was an intravenous drug user. By the end of the 1990s, she was close to dying. In the interview, Stoltenberg also tells of a boyfriend who subjected her to punishments, psychological terror and much fear, however, the heroin turned all of that into a feeling of freedom and made her perceive their relationship as simply wonderful, for a while.|$|E
60|$|As {{the night}} came on, and the storm continued, the boys felt {{anything}} but comfortable.

5000|$|Sagan is an {{open source}} (GNU/GPLv2) multi-threaded, high performance, {{real-time}} log analysis & correlation engine developed by Quadrant Information Security that runs on Unix operating systems. It is written in C and uses a multi-threaded architecture to deliver high performance log & event analysis. Sagan's structure and rules work similarly <b>to</b> the Sourcefire <b>Snort</b> IDS/IPS engine. This allows Sagan to be compatible with Snort rule management software and give Sagan the ability <b>to</b> correlate with <b>Snort</b> IDS/IPS data. Sagan can record events <b>to</b> the <b>Snort</b> [...] "unified2" [...] output format which makes Sagan compatible with user interfaces such as Snorby, Sguil, BASE and proprietary consoles ...|$|R
6000|$|It chanced that as I {{lay on my}} side my eye {{caught a}} gleam of light through a little ragged hole in the matting of pine branches. Part of the {{interior}} of the cabin, the doorway, and some space outside were plainly visible. The thud of horses had given place <b>to</b> <b>snorts,</b> and then came a flopping of saddles and packs on the ground. [...] "Any water hyar?" [...] asked a gruff voice I recognized as Bill's.

500|$|In [...] "Outsiders" [...] a scene {{required}} a lorry crashing {{into a car}} in front of Danny. Oyelowo had to stand ten feet away from the crash. The production crew considered having Oyelowo wearing sunglasses to shield his eyes from any possible glass shards, but they later chose against it. There were scenes where some of the characters snorted cocaine. The [...] "cocaine" [...] was in actuality glucose powder that the actors did have <b>to</b> <b>snort.</b> Elsewhere, the crew used vegetable soup as vomit. The alcohol used in the series were made from non-alcoholic drinks; the production crew used fruit juices as wine, ginger ale as brandy, and cold tea as beer.|$|E

The church scene with Charlie and Liam at the church in Manchester was actually filmed on Honolulu, where the scenes on the Island are filmed. Monaghan says that he feels Charlie's black hoodie {{is a sort of}} [...] "security blanket" [...] that he hides underneath and uses it when he feels [...] "lost." [...] The [...] "heroin" [...] that Charlie is supposedly snorting is actually brown sugar. Monaghan revealed this in an interview with Stuff magazine in October 2005, saying, [...] " [...] brown sugar. You get some really sweet boogers. You have to be careful not <b>to</b> <b>snort</b> too much of it, but it's happened a few times. You just find dessert up your nose couple of hours later." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{decline of}} St. John's Park {{began in the}} late 1840s and early 1850s when many neighborhoods around it and nearby in Lower Manhattan lost their wealthy residents, who began to move uptown. [...] In particular, when Cornelius Vanderbilt laid {{railroad}} tracks for the Hudson River Railroad along {{the west side of the}} square in 1851, St. John's Park owners began to leave in large numbers. In 1867, the New York Times wrote about that time: [...] "hen the iron horse began <b>to</b> <b>snort</b> along the streets, and the turmoil of traffic and travel invaded the North River side , the [...] "old fogies" [...] became disgusted, and rapidly retreated to more secluded locations." [...] Over the next dozen or so years, the elegant townhouses and mansions around the square and nearby gradually became boarding houses, and the inhabitants of the neighborhood changed from fashionable Knickerbockers to clerks, tradesman and mechanics. The square itself picked up the nickname of [...] "Hash Square".|$|E
5000|$|However, a {{study of}} non-deviant users in Amsterdam found a [...] "relative absence of {{destructive}} and compulsive use patterns over a ten year period" [...] and concluded that cocaine users can and do exercise control. [...] "Our respondents applied two basic types of controls to themselves: 1) restricting use to certain situations and to emotional states in which cocaine's effects would be most positive, and 2) limiting mode of ingestion <b>to</b> <b>snorting</b> of modest amounts of cocaine, staying below 2.5 grams a week for some, and below 0.5 grams a week for most. Nevertheless, those whose use level exceeded 2.5 grams a week all returned to lower levels".|$|R

60|$|Two thundering shots annihilated this silence. Then quickly came {{a lighter}} shot--the smash of glass. Dale {{ran into the}} saloon. The horses began <b>to</b> <b>snort,</b> to rear, to pound.

50|$|Robichaud {{observed}} that the captive female was calm {{in the presence of}} humans, but was afraid of dogs. On an encounter with a dog, she would resort <b>to</b> <b>snorting</b> and thrust her head forward, pointing her horns at her opponent. Her erect ears pointed backward, and she stood stiffly with her back arched. Meanwhile, she hardly paid any attention to her surroundings. This female was found to urinate and defecate separately, dropping her hind legs and lowering her lower body - a common observation among bovids. She would spend considerable time grooming herself with her strong tongue. Marking behaviour in the female involved opening up the flap of the maxillary gland and leaving a pungent secretion on rocks and vegetation. She would give out short bleats occasionally.|$|R
25|$|Goldman {{also claimed}} that when Lennon started making music again in 1980 {{following}} a long hibernation, {{he was not}} immune to Manhattan's cocaine-fueled disco scene. According to Goldman, on the day Lennon was murdered {{he was scheduled to}} undergo plastic surgery several days later to repair his nasal septum (due <b>to</b> <b>snorting</b> cocaine, which he supposedly did at the Hit Factory recording studio where he recorded his album Double Fantasy). Goldman did not cite a single name of anyone who might have witnessed this at the studio. Goldman alleged further that on December 8, 1980 (the day of Lennon's murder) not only did the singer's cocaine snorting warrant plastic surgery, but he was in such bad physical condition from drug abuse and lack of exercise that during his autopsy the medical examiner recorded observations to that effect, overlooking the four bullet wounds momentarily.|$|R
2500|$|Several of {{the deaths}} are notable due either to the {{publicity}} that followed or unusual circumstances of the case.

Police attributed her death <b>to</b> <b>snorting</b> cheese and drinking alcohol. On November 1, 2006, 17-year-old Keith Witherspoon died in nearby Mesquite; a story the following month in The Dallas Morning News profiled Witherspoon as [...] "the first Dallas-area youth publicly known to have died of a heroin overdose since the 'cheese' concerns were raised."

40|$|Snort is an {{open source}} Network Intrusion Detection System {{combining}} the benefits of signature, protocol and anomaly based inspection and {{is considered to be}} the most widely deployed IDS/IPS technology worldwide.
