Due to the significant difficulty of integrating complex flotation sub-processes in a model, numerical method in fundamental models has many limitations (considering a long list of variables). This investigation presented a method for variable selection and based on that selection, presented considerable models for the prediction of coal flotation responses (flotation rate constant and recovery). A comprehensive database was prepared with 64 flotation tests under various conditions. Through the database, statistical analyses were performed to select effective variable and to better understand the relationship among particle characteristics (size, particle Reynolds number, micro scale turbulence for particles and circularity) and hydrodynamic conditions (bubble Reynolds number, micro scale turbulence for bubbles, energy dissipation, and bubble surface area flux) with the flotation rate constant and recovery of coal particles.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Routing {{design is}} widely {{considered}} {{as one of the}} most challenging parts of enterprise network design. The chal-lenges come from the typical large scale of such networks, the diverse objectives to meet through design, and a wide variety of protocols and mechanisms to choose from. As a result network operators often find it difficult to understand and <b>trouble-shoot</b> the routing design of their networks. Furthermore, today’s common practice of focusing on one router or one protocol at a time makes it a onerous task to reason about the network-wide routing behavior. We believe that to mitigate the problem, there is a need for software tools to produce effective visualization of enterprise routing designs. In this paper we report on our experience building such a toolkit. We begin by abstracting various routing mechanisms into a small number of design primitives. The abstraction allows for a more concise representation of routing design without losing important design information, which is critical for making the tool scalable. Guided by the abstraction, we then develop a set of algorithms and heuristics, which take router configuration files as input and output a graphical representation of the routing design. The layout and components of the graph are highly customized to optimize its readability and power to infer the network-wide design pattern. We also present a case study using the toolkit to analyze the routing design of two large campus networks, and report on our findings. Our experience confirms the effectiveness of our toolkit in revealing key design characteristics of the networks, and in illustrating the network-wide routing behavior. I...|$|E

40|$|Conveyor {{transfer}} stations play a {{key role}} in many industries that handle bulk materials. Transfer stations can be rather sensitive to changes in material properties and can lead to relentless problems regarding reliability, wear, bottlenecking and blockages. Wet and sticky ores are typically difficult to handle materials due to their obnoxious ability to form a cohesive arch, adhere to surfaces and poor flow ability. Mines that are situated in areas with seasonal high rainfalls or that have started to exploit newer and more difficult to mine and handle ores, often from below the water table, experience vast difficulty in reliably conveying and processing bulk material with such diverse flow ability over time. Mining and processing operations which add water into bulk solids for processing purposes also may experience handling issues further along the handling and processing line. Cohesive and adhesive effects of wet, sticky ore on transfer stations which contain impact plates, ledges and curved or straight chutes can make it difficult to design a system to reliably guide material in the direction of the receiving belt. Therefore, the usage of the discrete element method (DEM) to model the flow of cohesive and cohesionless materials through industrial transfer stations is increasing. This paper gives a short overview of the implementation of DEM to <b>trouble-shoot</b> and optimise a transfer station and shed some light on the strength and weaknesses of DEM. Some of the vital calibration techniques used to 2 ̆ 7 tune 2 ̆ 7 the DEM material model using numerous bench-scale tests to produce representative flow behaviour of wet, sticky ores is also discussed...|$|E

The objective was to inform future support offered to course graduates. Methods Repeat, in-depth interviews with 30 type 1 diabetes patients after attending Dose Adjustment for Normal Eating (DAFNE) courses in the UK, and six and 12 [*]months later. Data were analysed using an inductive, thematic approach. Results While the flexible intensive insulin treatment approach taught on DAFNE courses {{was seen as a}} logical and effective way of managing one’s diabetes, it was also considered more technically complex than other insulin regimens. To sustain effective disease self-management using flexible intensive insulin treatment over time, patients often expected, and needed, on-going input and support from health care professionals trained in the approach.

40|$|The Sessional Academic Success (SAS) {{project is}} a sustainable, {{distributed}} model for supporting sessional staff at QUT. Developed by the Learning and Teaching Unit. SAS complements our Sessional Academic Program (SAP) : a sequence of formal academic development workshops explained in complementary nomination. SAS recognises that while these programs are very well received and a crucial aspect of preparing and advancing sessional teachers, they are necessarily encapsulated {{in the moment of}} their delivery and are generic, as they address all faculties (with their varied cultures, processes and pedagogies). The SAS project extends this formal, centrally offered activity into local, ‘just in time’, ongoing support within schools. It takes a distributed leadership approach. Experienced sessional academics are recruited and employed as Sessional Academic Success Advisors (SASAs). They provide sessional staff in their schools with contextually specific, needs based, peer-to-peer development opportunities; one-on-one advice on classroom management and strategies for success; and help to <b>trouble-shoot</b> challenges. The SASAs are trained by the Learning and Teaching Unit co-ordinator, and ongoing support is provided centrally and by school-based co-ordinators. This team approach situates the SASAs at the centre of an organisation map (see diagram of support relationships below). The SAS project aims to support sessional staff in their professional development by: • Offering contextual, needs-based support at school level by harnessing local expertise; • Providing further development opportunities that are local and focal; SAS aims to retain Sessional Staff by: • Responding to self-nominated requests for support and ‘just in time’, safe and reliable advice in times of need; • Building sessional staff confidence through help with dealing with challenges from a trusted peer; • Building a supportive academic community for sessional staff, which helps them feel a part of faculty life, and a community of teaching practice. SAS aims to support sessional staff in the development of academic teaching careers by: • Recognising the capacity of experienced sessional staff to support their peers in ways that are unique, valuable and valued and providing the agency to do so; • Providing career advancement and leadership opportunities for sessional staff. SAS takes unique approaches within each school using strategies such as: • Welcomes and schools orientation by SASAs; • Regular check ins; face-to-face advice and online support; • Compiling local resources to complement university wide resources. • Sessional-to-sessional ‘just in time’ training (eg. assessment and marking when marking commences); • Peer feedback and mentoring (the opportunities to sit in more experiences sessionals’ classes; • Sessional staff awards (nominated by students); • Communities of practice to discuss topics and issues with a view to (and support for) publishing on learning and teaching. In these ways, SASAs complement support offered by unit coordinators, administrators, and the Learning and Teaching Unit. Pairing senior and ‘understudy’ advisors ensures a line of succession, sustainability and continuity.

40|$|Discrete element {{modelling}} {{is gradually}} becoming more popular as a validation tool by industry to simulate bulk flow in bulk material handling and processing equipment. Although discrete element method (DEM) {{is a popular}} numerical method in academia to model the complex interactions in particle systems, the demand {{for the application of}} DEM to industrial problems is high. The use of DEM simulations to evaluate the flow of bulk materials through belt conveyor transfer points is popular to assist designers to <b>trouble-shoot</b> and quantify the functionality of a design. DEM does not directly design bulk material handling and processing equipment or replace design know-how but DEM simulation is an alternative approach to model particle flow that has traditionally been analysed using analytical methods, empirical design rules and scale model physical prototyping. Calibrated DEM simulations provide additional confidence of the performance of equipment and improve the efficiency and life of equipment due to the significant amounts of quantitative data available to provide insight into the complex physical interactions that occur. Recently there has been a growth of available commercial DEM programs such as EDEM®, which has been utilised in this study, but calibration and validation of DEM simulations still requires further investigation to adequately characterise and model cohesionless and cohesive bulk materials with realism. Insufficient calibration of DEM models can lead to unrealistic predictions making DEM a misleading design validation tool and may lead to poor performing equipment that can be costly to repair. The purpose of this research was to develop techniques to calibrate DEM models based on physical bench scale tests which reproduce the bulk flow behaviours to be modelled on a larger industrial scale. Cohesionless and cohesive bulk materials including polyethylene pellets, coal and bauxite were examined to characterise and develop a set of realistic particle-to-particle and particle-to-boundary interaction parameters for DEM simulations. The accuracy of the characterisation and calibration procedures were examined by modelling the impingement of polyethylene pellets against a flat impact plate using a novel conveyor transfer research facility where experimental quantitative and qualitative data was compared against the DEM simulations and analytical methods. Additional to the latter experimental test program, DEM simulations were conducted on a large scale industrial transfer point to model the flow of wet and sticky bauxite where results from the DEM models were evaluated against the limited quantitative information measured and observations from an existing transfer station. The aim of this thesis was to provide industry with some validated techniques to develop a calibrated DEM model to simulate the flow of bulk materials through complex transfer points and examine the accuracy of the predictions and limitations of DEM. It has been found that some DEM parameters are sensitive, especially when modelling cohesive materials using a simple linear cohesion and the more complex Johnson, Kendall and Roberts (JKR) contact model requiring careful selection of contact values. Analytical methods to evaluate the flow and trajectory of bulk material against a flat impact plate and through a straight and curved chute have been evaluated to verify the DEM predictions and experimental results. As the analytical methods are based on a 2 -D analysis of flow or lumped mass analogy, limitations of the analytical methods to predict complex 3 -D flow were discovered in this research that are frequently used by industry. The thesis also investigates the measurement of wall friction angles between a bulk material and wall surface using the standard Jenike direct shear tester and a novel large scale wall friction tester (LSWFT) to examine the scale-up effects of the particle size distribution and shear cell. Materials that were examined on the latter machines included magnetite concentrate, polyethylene pellets and bauxite, which have different particle and bulk properties. Various wall materials were also examined including stainless steel 304 - 2 B, alumina ceramic tiles, Matrox and Bisplate® 400. Findings from this test work showed there were variations between the measured wall friction angles between the two machines for various bulk material and wall sample combinations. The LSWFT displayed better capability and reliability to measure wall friction angles of bulk materials consisting of particles greater than 4 mm due to the larger shear cell size and greater shear strain. Accurate measurements of wall friction angles and modelling of the particle-to-boundary interactions in DEM simulations have shown to be imperative when designing equipment for reliable flow to occur. It can be concluded that DEM calibration and adequately modelling non-spherical particles by clustering balls together are essential for successful and reliable application of DEM simulations to industrial applications...|$|E

It was a very good session for anyone attending this conference for the first time. General Session and Keynote Address SunGard CEO Brian Madocks and members of the SunGard Higher Education management team were on hand to talk about how SunGard Higher Education can help your institution achieve results that matter. The session closed with a keynote address from Mr. Erik Weihenmayer who shares seven "summits" for harnessing the power of adversity and turning it into the fuel for growth and innovation. Banner UDC today, tomorrow and beyond SunGard HE executives and other peers talked about what’s new and what’s coming up in the Banner Unified Digital Campus (UDC). From new Enrollment Management to Banner Travel & Expense Management, Identity management services to globalization, I learnt all about the exciting new products, functionality, and services designed to help our Athabasca University meet our performance challenges today and tomorrow. I also got a glimpse at what’s in store for the Banner UDC beyond 2008. This was a great way to start the conference. UDC Technical Forum In this session, SunGard Higher Education general manager and other higher lever technical managers presented the UDC technology road map of future software architecture development, and all new modules such as Banner Enrollment Management and Travel & Expense Claim Management etc., all based on new RIA (Rich Internet Application) Technology – Adobe Flex in order to enhance the user interface of using Banner system. This was the session I first heard about SunGard HE is going to switch the Oracle Forms technology to Adobe Flex in the future release. It is a very useful piece of information we have to prepare to face the changes in our upcoming Banner upgrades in AU. [...] - Monday, April 14, 2008 Banner Technical Forum This was an important session for all Banner technical professional like me, performing the banner database job in the AU. The SunGard HE principal software engineer presented the details of SunGard supported Banner Oracle database, Oracle Application Server, Data warehouse, SUN Java Plug-In and Adobe Flex versions on upcoming release Banner 8. 0 and minimum supported versions on current Banner 7. x. The panel of SunGard HE experts also answered all technical questions raised by audiences from all user groups. This was a very good session to clear most of concerns and questions I had before, and {{had a chance to talk}} to the SunGard experts issues related to our Banner 7 upgrade project. Banner 8. 0 Upgrade and UTF- 8 Conversion This is a technical question and answer session. SunGard technical architect Julie Turnbull presented the ways related to the Banner 8. 0 Upgrade and UTF- 8 Conversion Such as: •	Export/import process, suggest to use Oracle 10 g Data Pump •	Csscan/csaltr •	UTF- 8 character conversion •	Database semantics and ICU (International Components for Unicode) requirements. Tips: install ICU component on the database server in advance will reduce upgrade downtime. I took this session because I need to know those technical tips and tricks once we need to upgrade our AU Banner system in the future, as well as those potential problems when upgrading to Banner 8. 0, Another important message I got was the actual downtime of other pioneer universities had when they upgraded to Banner 8. 0.

Oracle 11 g, building on Oracle's unique ability to deliver Grid Computing, gives Colleges and Universities agility to respond faster to changing Campus conditions, provide more services through technology innovation, and reduce costs. With Oracle Database 11 g we can do: - Adopt new technology faster with Real Application Testing - Manage more data for less with advanced compression and partitioning - Simplify systems by storing all your data in the Oracle Database with Oracle Secure Files - Maximize data reliability with Oracle Active Data Guard - Free IT personnel for strategic tasks with management automation - Enhance RAC features This session gave me helpful information about Oracle 11 g database, which we will setup here in AU Oracle Database Re-architecture project. Oracle 11 g New Features This session was presented by two team managers from SunGard HE. The session involves technical staff from all universities who are looking for the information on new features with Oracle new released 11 g database, specific on the database installation and setup. The presentation revealed changes and updates in support of Banner 8. 0. Oracle – I Need what version? … Where? This session was for those responsible or involved with the installation/upgrade of the Oracle infrastructure, having the correct version is very important. The experts from SunGard HE presented the information about Banner 7. x and Banner 8. 0 Oracle version. The Oracle RDBMS, Application Server and Developer Suite versions also were addressed. The most useful things are they provided the FAQ CMS numbers for quick search the answers from SunGard Customer Support website. It was great for my job because I used to spend a lot of time to search they website in order to get the correct FAQs. [...] - Tuesday, April 15, 2008 Managing Banner Upgrades This was the most excited session I have ever attended, and it was just coming in time for our current Banner 7 upgrade project I work on with it, and it was presented by Shelly Keck, Technical team Manager from SunGard Higher Education. This session provided an idea of how to lay our foundation in preparation for our next Banner upgrade. Discussion was centered on everything from creating the project plan to testing to the final Go-Live date! I have learned how to make our Banner upgrades run as smoothly as possible. The main topics included: • Preparing the Timeline • Who Are the Players? • Test Plans (Samples distributed) • Testing/Troubleshooting • Ownership • Roundtable Discussions • Planning the Go-Live Day DBA fun with Banner Banner is a large system that fits well for any size institution. With such a range of scalability comes a fair amount of work for the Database Administrator. What is usually put under the umbrella of maintenance can take on many faces: auditing, security, upgrades, data integrity, reporting, third party software integration, and development, to name a few. This session discussed the best practices for the Banner/Oracle 10 gR 2 environment. The use of Enterprise Manager for auditing, security, performance and backups were detailed, as well as Oracle and Banner 7. x upgrade schedules. This course was intended for Database Administrators/Analysts, or System Administrators who are responsible for planning and maintaining Banner at their institution. After attending this session, I felt it could exactly apply that knowledge to our situation here in AU. Private one-on-one technical session with Action Line Staff I had an appointment with Joe Carey, Lead Technical Support Analyst, SunGard HE for one specific technical issue we had when I switched the Banner 7. 3 user login from Oracle JInitiator to Sun Java Plug-In. Even he could not instant <b>trouble-shoot</b> this problem, he directed me to the right direction of how to solve this issue on his computer. It was nice to face to face talk with those technical support staff from SunGard ActionLine customer support. Disaster Recovery with Oracle Data Guard This presentation focused on the features of Oracle Data Guard specific to disaster recovery. The presenter Brian Borchers came from the University of Idaho, showed us how Data Guard can provide a fully integrated, cost-effective DR solution for the production databases. The architectural details of establishing one or more physical standby databases using Oracle 10 g Release 2 features were provided. The presenter described steps for establishing a brokered configuration, performing switch-over and fail-over operations, and reinstating the original database after a failover is completed. Automatic failover features new to Oracle 10 gR 2 were also discussed. Architectural considerations for designing a Data Guard implementation were considered. This presentation was targeted for Oracle database administrators. I have the chance to hear U of Idaho’s experience using Oracle Data Guard and asked Brian the question of the distance between their two data centers. In the near future, we are going to setup Data Guard (standby database) at CIM, St. Albert. So it was a good session for me. UDC Web Services Tour Richard Moon, a product manager of Integration and Service-Oriented Architecture, SunGard HE talked about the Banner Unified Digital Campus numerous Web service operations across multiple applications. This includes Banner, Luminis, Workflow and Banner Document Management services. He provided a grand tour of the UDC Web services that are currently available. This session was not exactly related to my work, but it was good to learn something new and some possible technologies we could use to our Banner system in the future. [...] - Wednesday, April 16, 2008 Closing Session & Keynote Address The closing session brings everyone together for the last day of the conference. Our closing was truly an inspirational one, featuring a keynote address by Dr. Carl Hammerschlag who is an internationally recognized speaker, author, physician, and healer who helps people transform their lives by showing them how to rise above limitations, remove roadblocks, rekindle dreams and become the principal agents in their own professional and personal lives. His extraordinary life experiences have given him a unique perspective about how people can restore life balance. Using the language of science, the power of legends and his vast clinical experience. Banner Performance on Oracle 10 g This session was presented by Scott Harden, Data Manager from University of Illinois. The change from the rule-based optimizer (RBO) to the cost-based optimizer (CBO) in Oracle 10 g is a scary performance proposition, especially since Banner was developed under the RBO, but it doesn't have to be. They have experienced great performance and stability on Banner 7 and Oracle 10 g since August of 2006. I have learnt how U of Illinois manipulated statistics and histograms to provide stable and consistent performance under the CBO, and learnt how we can make the CBO function as reliably as the RBO or even better! He discussed what you need to do to ensure performance from day 1 on Oracle 10 g and how to maintain that performance going forward. I got a look at their custom statistics gathering code, and Scott provided the link to download their custom script if I want it as a reference. I learnt why the out-of-the-box 10 g statistics are actually bad for Banner system. Scott also discussed what should look for when performance does start to suffer in a particular area and how to fix it. RMAN: Don’t Wait Until It’s Too Late Melissa Hazelwood, Sr. technical consultant/Oracle DBA from SunGard HE discussed the Recovery Manager (RMAN) all features and how to apply to Banner database backup and recovery. Oracle database backup strategies have changed a great deal over the past several years. RMAN has replaced the scripts and cold backups of the early days. Many DBAs are not sure how to get started or if RMAN will be as reliable as the old methods. This is a good introduction to the basics, with an opportunity to get those lingering questions answered. This session was concentrated on RMAN with Oracle 10 gR 2, detailing best practices, syntax, and RMAN maintenance. Backup automation and verification were covered, as well as Flashback, Data Guard and Grid Control as supplements to a RMAN strategy. This session was intended for Oracle DBA and provided me plenty information of using RMAN to do our job. ODS on RAC This presentation was on Ithaca College's recent move of the SunGard ODS (Oracle Decision Support) from MS Windows 2003 to Red Hat Linux running Oracle RAC enabled RDBMS. Marco Cestaro, a Manager of Business Intelligence from Ithaca College talked about an overview of their hardware architecture, RDBMS configuration, and performance statistics. This was a high level overview of a very complex environment. And he also reviewed their staff attending Oracle Data Warehouse and RAC training, and resources used for this project. This technical presentation was for Data Warehouse Administrator, System Administrator, and Database Administrator of SunGard's ODS. Oracle RAC is an advance RDBMS capability and requires a solid background in Oracle databases. I selected this session was because Athabasca University is going to setup RAC environment in AU-central and CIM, and most likely we are going to setup Oracle Data Warehouse after the Banner 7 upgrade. Conclusion SunGard Summit is a very good conference for the university, like AU using SunGard Higher Education ERP system. I had many opportunities to talk with SunGard experts and met so many people from other universities to share our experiences of using Banner systems and how to solve the problems we had before and now. It was a great learning experience for me to attend this conference. I definitely would attend SunGard Summit in the future. The SunGard Summit provides an opportunity for professionals to learn, discovery and explore the many ways that performance matters to the higher education institution, and join with other university colleagues, industry thought leaders, and SunGard Higher Education solution experts at SunGard Summit 2008. At SunGard Summit we’ll discover new ways of thinking, learn from a network of our peers, and become the resource our institution needs to achieve its mission and goals.
