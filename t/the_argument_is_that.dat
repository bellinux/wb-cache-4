5|$|The {{sale of the}} Olympic brand {{has been}} controversial. <b>The</b> <b>argument</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the Games have become indistinguishable from any other commercialised {{sporting}} spectacle. Specific criticism was levelled at the IOC for market saturation during the 1996 Atlanta and 2000 Sydney Games. The cities were awash in corporations and merchants attempting to sell Olympic-related wares. The IOC {{indicated that they would}} address this to prevent spectacles of over-marketing at future Games. Another criticism is that the Games are funded by host cities and national governments; the IOC incurs none of the cost, yet controls all the rights and profits from the Olympic symbols. The IOC also takes a percentage of all sponsorship and broadcast income. Host cities continue to compete ardently for the right to host the Games, even though there is no certainty that they will earn back their investments. Research has shown that trade is around 30 percent higher for countries that have hosted the Olympics.|$|E

25|$|The {{arguments}} presented are not {{in general}} arguments against the moral right of Kosovo Albanians to self-determination, but focus on the legality or otherwise of the unilateral action of the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government.

25|$|Extrapolation is {{projecting}} {{historical data}} {{into the future}} on the same basis; if prices have risen at a certain rate in the past, {{they will continue to}} rise at that rate forever. <b>The</b> <b>argument</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> investors tend to extrapolate past extraordinary returns on investment of certain assets into the future, causing them to overbid those risky assets in order to attempt to continue to capture those same rates of return.|$|E
25|$|In response, {{opponents of}} the bill {{including}} Martin Lee have argued that a potentially repressive bill is more acceptable {{in a system of}} parliamentary democracy and that under British rule, the potential impact of security laws was minimised by the fact that political leaders would suffer political damage if they attempted to enforce these laws. <b>The</b> <b>argument</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> in the case where Hong Kong becomes authoritarian, there are fewer restrictions which prevent them drafting bad laws.|$|E

25|$|One {{aspect of}} <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{by having a}} single toll road system for the state that {{controls}} the major commuter routes into Chicago and the major circumferential route around the city, commuters and long-haul truckers who use the original system that was built in 1958 are subsidizing the subsequent routes, I-88 to Dixon and I-355 in DuPage County.

25|$|Parasitism {{has been}} {{suggested}} {{as part of the}} explanation of the evolution of secondary sex characteristics in breeding male animals, such as the plumage of peacocks and the manes of male lions. <b>The</b> <b>argument</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> female hosts select males for breeding based on such characteristics because they act as honest signals of costly handicaps. A possible mechanism for this, suggested by Ivar Folstad and Andrew Karter, is that the male hormone testosterone encourages the growth of secondary sex characteristics such as manes, but at the price of reducing an animal's immune defences.|$|E
25|$|According to a {{contrary}} {{school of}} thought, there lay not empowerment but disempowerment in the late-medieval promotion of affective piety. In this view {{the women and}} men who practised it were in effect taking a kind of drug (affective ecstasy, so to speak) which kept them fixated on a particular sentimental construction of the ‘humanity’ of Christ, and diverted attention from aspects of his ministry which could pose serious problems for the medieval Church. <b>The</b> <b>argument</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> alternative, more challenging, and hence institutionally marginalized delineation of what was important in Christ’s ‘humanity’ and ministry remained visible in heterodox contexts, or lurked in otherwise orthodox writing such as Langland’s.|$|E

25|$|The second main {{school of}} thought, {{put forward by}} {{scholars}} such as McManus, is that ogham was invented by the first Christian communities in early Ireland, out {{of a desire to}} have a unique alphabet for writing short messages and inscriptions in the Irish language. <b>The</b> <b>argument</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the sounds of Primitive Irish were regarded as difficult to transcribe into the Latin alphabet, so the invention of a separate alphabet was deemed appropriate. A possible such origin, as suggested by McManus (1991:41), is the early Christian community known to have existed in Ireland from around AD 400 at the latest, the existence of which is attested by the mission of Palladius by Pope Celestine I in AD 431.|$|E
25|$|Ben Collier {{has said}} that the Culture is a utopia {{carrying}} significantly greater moral legitimacy than the West's, by comparison, proto-democracies. While Culture interventions can seem similar at first to Western interventions, especially when considered with their democratising rhetoric, <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the Culture operates completely without material need, and therefore without the possibility of baser motives. This {{is not to say that}} the Culture's motives are purely altruistic; a peaceful, enlightened universe full of good neighbours lacking ethnic, religious, and sexual chauvinisms is in the Culture's interest as well. Furthermore, the Culture's ideals (in many ways similar to those of the liberal perspective today) are to a much larger extent realised internally in comparison to the West.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} argued that {{rational}} state actors would never use biological weapons offensively. <b>The</b> <b>argument</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> biological weapons cannot be controlled: the weapon could backfire and harm the army on the offensive, perhaps having even worse effects than on the target. An agent like smallpox or other airborne viruses would almost certainly spread worldwide and ultimately infect the user's home country. However, this argument does not necessarily apply to bacteria. For example, anthrax can easily be controlled and even created in a garden shed; the FBI suspects it can be done for as little as $2,500 using readily available laboratory equipment. Also, using microbial methods, bacteria can be suitably modified to be effective in only a narrow environmental range, the range of the target that distinctly differs from the army on the offensive. Thus only the target might be affected adversely. The weapon may be further used to bog down an advancing army making them more vulnerable to counterattack by the defending force.|$|E

50|$|On 1 June 2017, it <b>was</b> {{announced}} <b>that</b> second-placed club FC Desna Chernihiv {{was denied}} in receiving license {{to play in}} the top division. <b>The</b> <b>argument</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> club <b>is</b> not able to provide guarantees for an adequate financing of infrastructure.

25|$|Another wrinkle in {{the issue}} is the unnatural {{geographic}} location of this Eastern-Time-Zoned region. In the western Indiana counties where Eastern time is observed (South Bend and Lafayette south to Terre Haute and Vincennes), around the summer solstice, the sun neither sets until after 9:20 pm, nor does it reach solar noon until almost 2:00 pm. During the winter months when standard time is observed, school buses in western regions lose a valuable hour of the sun's rays as they pick up children in the morning. Another notable observation is that schools in the Eastern Time Zone of Indiana tend to have far more 2-hour delays, mainly {{due to the fact that}} sunlight is required for many road de-icing components to work. With the sun rising as late as 8:20 am in some areas, available sunlight is inadequate to safely thaw the roads for school buses to pick up all their passengers on time. <b>The</b> <b>argument</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> if the same area were in its geographically natural Central time zone, the sun would be up an hour sooner, and it would have an additional hour to thaw the roads every morning.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the theory}} that The Contention may be an early draft does not {{necessarily}} imply {{that it could not}} also represent a bad quarto. Traditionally, most critics (such as Alexander, Doran, McKerrow and Urkowitz) have looked at the problem as an either-or situation; The Contention is either a reported text or an early draft, but recently there has been some argument that it may be both. For example, this is the theory supported by Roger Warren in his Oxford Shakespeare edition of the play. It is also the theory advanced by Randall Martin in his Oxford Shakespeare edition of 3 Henry VI. The crux of <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> both the evidence for the bad quarto theory and the evidence for the early draft theory are so compelling that neither is able to completely refute the other. As such, if the play contains evidence of being both a reported text and an early draft, it must be both; i.e. The Contention represents a reported text of an early draft of 2 Henry VI. Shakespeare wrote an early version of the play, which was staged. Shortly after that staging, some of the actors constructed a bad quarto from it and had it published. In the meantime, Shakespeare had rewritten the play into the form found in the First Folio. Warren argues that this is the only theory which can account for the strong evidence for both reporting and revision, and it is a theory which is gaining increased support in the late twentieth/early twenty-first century.|$|E
