5|$|Twilight {{finds herself}} in the long-forgotten crystal caves beneath Canterlot. An image of Cadance appears and taunts her, {{explaining}} that the marriage will continue without Twilight's interference. Using her magic to shatter a crystal wall, Twilight finds another Cadance waiting there, but the mare is bruised and battered. Twilight attacks her, but the weary alicorn proves {{that she is the}} real Cadance by demonstrating their shared rhyme from their youth. Cadance explains she was abducted by the impostor in the castle to marry Shining Armor herself. The two <b>then</b> <b>work</b> together to escape the caves and try to stop the wedding. Meanwhile, the fake Cadance revels in her victory, secretly plotting against Shining Armor and the others ("This Day Aria").|$|E
5|$|Ideas {{to produce}} a {{complete}} feature film were pursued in February 1938, when inquiries were made to extend Stokowski's contract. In August, Disney asked Stokowski's representative to have him return to the studios to select material for the new film, which was initially titled The Concert Feature. The pair further thought of presenting the film with an on-screen host to introduce each number in the program. Both had heard composer and music critic Deems Taylor provide intermission commentary during radio broadcasts of the New York Philharmonic, and agreed he would be most suitable for the role. Disney did contact Taylor about the project, but by <b>then</b> <b>work</b> on Pinocchio, Bambi, and development on his new Burbank studio kept him too busy {{to work on the}} new feature. In a change of plans, Taylor was asked during a call on September 3, 1938, leave to come to the studios as soon as possible. He left New York City for Los Angeles by train two days later for a month's visit.|$|E

25|$|A {{positive}} cell potential gives {{a negative}} change in Gibbs free energy.

25|$|A topping out {{ceremony}} {{was held in}} May 2012 to mark the building reaching its highest point.

25|$|The fell is {{invariably}} {{climbed from}} Seathwaite, taking the bridleway from Stockley Bridge which goes to Styhead Tarn for a kilometre, passing the waterfall of Taylorgill Force, before striking south westerly over rocky terrain {{to reach the}} cairned northern summit. A ridge path works its way south from here although it bypasses both Great Slack and the south top and a short detour is needed to reach them. An alternative is to make for Sprinkling Tarn from either Esk Hause or Sty Head and <b>then</b> <b>work</b> back along the ridge.|$|E
25|$|The {{inhabitants}} of Cornwall {{are involved in}} the manufacture of tin ingots. They mine the ore, smelt it and <b>then</b> <b>work</b> it into pieces the shape of knuckle-bones, after which it is transported to the island of Ictis by wagon, which can be done at low tide. Merchants purchasing it there pack it on horses for 30days to the river Rhône, where it is carried down to the mouth. Diodorus says that the {{inhabitants of}} Cornwall are civilised in manner and especially hospitable to strangers because of their dealings with foreign merchants.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the central}} tenets in Easterly’s {{approach}} is a more bottom up philosophy of aid. This applies {{not only to the}} identification of problems, but to the actual distribution of capital to the areas in need. In effect, Easterly would have countries go to the area which needed aid, collect information about the problem, find out what the population wanted, and <b>then</b> <b>work</b> from there. In keeping with this, funds would also be distributed from the bottom up, rather than being given to a specific government.|$|E

25|$|Kenya: The first CURE {{hospital}} {{opened in}} 1998 in Kijabe. The AIC-CURE International Children's Hospital is a 30-bed hospital that serves approximately 8,000 children per year, also operating mobile clinics to remote regions. The orthopedic training {{program has been}} certified by the College of Surgeons of East, Central and Southern Africa, where surgeons will spend five years training {{at the hospital and}} <b>then</b> <b>work</b> at another CURE hospital for an additional amount of time. CURE clubfoot, a non-surgical treatment for the correction of clubfoot in young children, is hosted in this hospital.|$|E
25|$|For the Skylake microarchitecture, Intel {{has also}} {{designed}} a SO-DIMM package named UniDIMM, which can use either DDR3 or DDR4 chips. The CPU's integrated memory controller can <b>then</b> <b>work</b> with either. The purpose of UniDIMMs is {{to handle the}} transition from DDR3 to DDR4, where pricing and availability may make it desirable to switch RAM type. UniDIMMs have the same dimensions and number of pins as regular DDR4 SO-DIMMs, but the notch is placed differently to avoid accidentally using in an incompatible DDR4 SO-DIMM socket.|$|E
25|$|Further south, {{a branch}} from Hitchin to Royston {{and on to}} Shepreth was opened in March 1850 and worked by the GNR. This line was meant to connect with a {{previously}} authorized GER line at Shepreth. The GER had not built this line but opposed GNR powers to extend from Shepreth to Cambridge themselves. An agreement was reached for the GER to build the Shepreth to Cambridge section and <b>then</b> <b>work</b> the whole line from Hitchin to Cambridge for 14 years, with the GER taking over the expensive guarantee that the GNR had given to the Hitchin & Royston company.|$|E

The team succeed in finding and rescuing the imp-warlock, but Artemis and Holly Short must <b>then</b> <b>work</b> to restore the imp's home, a {{floating}} island lost in a space and time Limbo, which threatens to breach its way onto Earth. In the process, several significant changes occur within the characters' lives. Artemis receives {{a small amount of}} magical power during the trip to Limbo, and swaps an eye with Holly on the return trip. The pair finds that they have been transported nearly three years into their future. Finally, Artemis learns that in the ensuing time he has become the older brother to twins, Beckett and Myles Fowl.|$|E
25|$|Ubuntu {{packages}} {{are based on}} packages from Debian's unstable branch. Both distributions use Debian's deb package format and package management tools (e.g. APT and Ubuntu Software). Debian and Ubuntu {{packages are}} not necessarily binary compatible with each other, however; packages {{may need to be}} rebuilt from source to be used in Ubuntu. Many Ubuntu developers are also maintainers of key packages within Debian. Ubuntu cooperates with Debian by pushing changes back to Debian, although there has been criticism that this does not happen often enough. Ian Murdock, the founder of Debian, had expressed concern about Ubuntu packages potentially diverging too far from Debian to remain compatible. Before release, packages are imported from Debian unstable continuously and merged with Ubuntu-specific modifications. One month before release, imports are frozen, and packagers <b>then</b> <b>work</b> to ensure that the frozen features interoperate well together.|$|E
25|$|The Sir Charles Clore Jewish-Arab Community Centre in the Kiryat Wolfson {{neighbourhood}} runs youth {{clubs and}} programs for Jewish and Arab children. In 1990, Mohammed Faheli, an Arab resident of Acre, founded the Acre Jewish-Arab association, which originally operated {{out of two}} bomb shelters. In 1993, Dame Vivien Duffield of the Clore Foundation donated funds for a new building. Among the programs offered is Peace Child Israel, which employs theatre and the arts to teach coexistence. The participants, Jews and Arabs, spend two months studying conflict resolution and <b>then</b> <b>work</b> together to produce an original theatrical performance that addresses the issues they have explored. Another program is Patriots of Acre, a community responsibility and youth tourism program that teaches children to become ambassadors for their city. In the summer, the centre runs an Arab-Jewish summer camp for 120 disadvantaged children aged 5–11. Some 1,000 children {{take part in the}} Acre Centre's youth club and youth programming every week. Adult education programs have been developed for Arab women interested in completing their high school education and acquiring computer skills to prepare for joining the workforce. The centre also offers parenting courses, and music and dance classes.|$|E
