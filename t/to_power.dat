5|$|Although {{a secret}} {{agreement}} originally stated that Odlum would take power after six months, {{his support for}} Cuba and similar left-wing nations led to American pressure to keep him out. After months of negotiations, Odlum was dismissed as Deputy Prime Minister, and the ensuing government weakness and infighting led to its defeat in the 1982 election. In opposition, Odlum was made Ambassador to the United Nations, resigning in 1996. When the Labour Party came <b>to</b> <b>power</b> again a year later, he became Foreign Minister, overseeing the establishment of stronger relations with both Cuba and China. Amidst controversy over his alleged alliance with the opposition, Odlum resigned in 2001.

The Jadid government's coming <b>to</b> <b>power</b> resulted in the self-imposed exile of the leading Ba'ath ideologue Michel Aflaq. Atrash, a partisan of Aflaq, was arrested and jailed in the Mezzeh Prison during the coup.

30|$|<b>Power</b> <b>to</b> gas (P 2 G) {{technology}} can be classified into <b>power</b> <b>to</b> hydrogen and <b>power</b> <b>to</b> natural gas (methane, CH 4) [26].
