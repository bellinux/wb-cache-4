5|$|After {{finishing}} Yuka, Haruka, Saki, and Kurumi's routes, {{the player}} gets {{access to the}} Izumi Cure route, in which Makoto learns that Izumi and Okuhiko had deceived him into thinking that his premonitions were true. Makoto confronts Izumi, after which both he and Izumi fall off a cliff. They travel back in time, retaining their memories of the past six days. Makoto accepts that he has traveled through time, and Izumi reveals {{that she is the}} professor in charge of the seminar camp, and that <b>the</b> <b>events</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> week were a science experiment; she attempted to test the phenomenon known as Curé Syndrome, where if multiple people believe in a delusion and the delusion is spread to others, the delusion becomes reality. Makoto was the test subject of the experiment, which was meant to involve him having the delusion that he could have premonitions; unexpectedly, he turned out to have real premonitions.|$|E
25|$|A third {{argument}} for incompatibilism was formulated by Carl Ginet in the 1960s and has received much {{attention in the}} modern literature. The simplified argument runs along these lines: if determinism is true, then we {{have no control over}} <b>the</b> <b>events</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> that determined our present state and no control over the laws of nature. Since we can have no control over these matters, we also can have no control over the consequences of them. Since our present choices and acts, under determinism, are the necessary consequences of the past and the laws of nature, then we have no control over them and, hence, no free will. This is called the consequence argument. Peter van Inwagen remarks that C. D. Broad had a version of the consequence argument as early as the 1930s.|$|E

500|$|The Zuo zhuan {{has been}} {{recognized}} as a masterpiece of early Chinese prose and [...] "grand historical narrative" [...] for many centuries. [...] It has had an immense influence on Chinese literature and historiography for nearly 2000 years, and was the primary text by which historical Chinese readers gained an understanding of China's ancient history. [...] It enjoyed high status and esteem throughout the centuries of Chinese history because of its great literary quality, and was often read and memorized because of its role as the preeminent expansion and commentary on the Annals (Chunqiu), which almost all Chinese traditionally ascribed to Confucius. It was commonly believed throughout much of Chinese history that the terse, succinct entries of the Annals contained cryptic references to Confucius' [...] "profound moral judgments on <b>the</b> <b>events</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> {{as well as those}} of his own day and on the relation of human events to those in the natural order", and that the Zuo zhuan was written to clarify or even [...] "decode" [...] these hidden judgments. The Zuo zhuans great influence on the Chinese languageparticularly on Classical Chineseis evident from the fact that it is the source of more Chinese literary idioms (chéngyǔ [...] ) than any other work, including the Analects of Confucius. [...] The well-known Qing dynasty student anthology Guwen Guanzhi included 34 passages from the Zuo zhuan as paragons of Classical Chinese prose [...] more than any other source. [...] These passages are still part of the Classical Chinese curriculum in mainland China and Taiwan today.|$|E

2500|$|It {{has been}} said that they cannot fathom my motive. For the full period of my active life I have been a teacher of {{economics}} to the working classes, and my contention has always been that capitalism is rotten to its foundations, and must give place to a new society. I had a lecture, the principal heading of which was [...] "Thou shalt not steal; thou shalt not kill", and I pointed out that {{as a consequence of the}} robbery that goes on in all civilised countries today, our respective countries have had to keep armies, and that inevitably our armies must clash together. On that and on other grounds, I consider capitalism the most infamous, bloody and evil system that mankind has ever witnessed. My language is regarded as extravagant language, but <b>the</b> <b>events</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> four years have proved my contention.|$|E
2500|$|The Book of Deuteronomy, {{in which}} Moses reviews <b>the</b> <b>events</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> {{mentions}} the [...] "diseases of Egypt" [...] (Deuteronomy 7:15 and 28:60), but means something that afflicted the Israelites, not the Egyptians; in (Deuteronomy 7:19) it mentions the plagues {{of the book}} of Exodus. The Exodus plagues are divine judgments, a series of curses like those in Deuteronomy 28:15–68, which mention many of the same afflictions; they are even closer to the curses in the Holiness code, Leviticus 26, since like the Holiness Code they leave room for repentance. The theme that divine punishment should lead to repentance is echoed in the prophets (Amos 4:6–12, Ezekiel 20), and the form of prophetic speech, [...] "Thus says Yahweh", and the figure of the prophet as divine messenger echoed in the late prophets Jeremiah and Ezekiel and the Deuteronomistic history. [...] The theme of Pharaoh's obstinacy is likewise referred to in the 6th century prophets – Isaiah 6:9–13, Jeremiah 5:3, and Ezekiel 3:7–9.|$|E
2500|$|The gospel {{places the}} story on the evening of the day of Jesus' resurrection. The two disciples have heard the tomb of Jesus was found empty earlier that day. They are {{discussing}} <b>the</b> <b>events</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> few days when a stranger asks them what they are discussing. [...] "Their eyes were kept from recognizing him." [...] He soon rebukes them for their unbelief and explains prophecies about the Messiah to them. On reaching Emmaus, they ask the stranger to join them for the evening meal. When he breaks the bread [...] "their eyes were opened" [...] and they recognize him as the resurrected Jesus. Jesus immediately vanishes. Cleopas and his friend then hasten back to Jerusalem to carry the news to the other disciples, and arrive in time to proclaim to the eleven who were gathered together with others that Jesus truly is alive. While describing the events, Jesus appeared again to all who were there, giving them a commission to evangelize. Then he took them out as far as Bethany and blessed them before ascending back into heaven.|$|E

2500|$|Since the [...] "repentance broadcasts," [...] Haggard and {{his wife}} have {{traveled}} to churches and appeared on radio and television broadcasts. They have also begun to have former church members and friends come to their home for [...] "healing meetings," [...] in which Haggard apologizes, answers any questions, and discusses [...] "how the Gospel can inform our responses to others who violate biblical standards." [...] The couple has been writing, traveling, and speaking about <b>the</b> <b>events</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> several years. In November 2009, Haggard began holding prayer meetings in his Colorado Springs basement. One hundred ten people attended the first prayer meeting. By the next meeting, the large number of attendees forced him to move the prayer meeting to his barn. Haggard also says he has been named an overseer at a church, someone who counsels and advises church leaders on moral, ethical, and religious issues. In May 2010, Haggard announced he was incorporating a new church for accounting purposes, And by June 2010, Haggard said he would operate a full-blown church. On April 11, 2010, Haggard {{and his wife}} conducted an interview at Lifepoint Church in Fredericksburg, Virginia. There was much controversy {{as to whether or not}} the church should pay for this interview.|$|E
2500|$|The leading {{motif of}} Torquemada's monumental history – {{elaborated}} by him in many places, {{especially in the}} general prologue to the entire work – can be characterised as the merciful action of Divine Providence in choosing the Spanish to liberate the Indians from their subjection to the Devil who had deceived these innocent peoples into practising a religion marred by errors and polluted by abominations such as human sacrifice. [...] On this interpretation {{the fall of the}} Aztec monarchy was a Divine chastisement and Spain the rod. But, for all that, Torquemada was sympathetic to the positive achievements of the Indians, and, by situating their history and culture {{within the framework of the}} Old Testament and of the former glories of the empires of Egypt, Greece and Rome, he encouraged the educated elite of the Old World to recognise the indigenous nations of the New World as their peers. [...] His history was, of set purpose, a laborious inquiry into the truth of things, requiring (as he says in his general prologue) diligence, maturation, and the exercise of prudence in adjudicating among conflicting testimonies. [...] It was not written as an entertainment or to satisfy mere curiosity, but with a serious didactic purpose and to edify, for he believed that the record of <b>the</b> <b>events</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> constitute not only an antidote to human mortality and the brevity of life, but also a hermeneutic key to understanding the present, thereby offering man an opportunity to progress.|$|E
2500|$|After the city's desecration of the cemetery, {{independent}} directors on the PHC board {{learned of}} the formation of the GESPHC and the transfer of the cemetery's title by the other board members. They were outraged. Independent board member John Vogt asserted that the trustees had no authority to file for a subdivision, and that lotholders were almost unanimous in opposing the transfer of title. At a special meeting of the Prospect Hill Cemetery lotholders held on January 5, 1888, the 400 lotholders present elected a new president (Charles A. Bickwedde) and a new secretary (Leonhardt Eckert). With title to the cemetery in question, lots could not be sold and income plummeted. [...] A financial committee, consisting of members Jacob J. Appich, W. Grisbauer, Charles Groff, Frederick Reh, and Charles Schneider, was established to support the cemetery. It immediately raised $500.50 ($ in [...] dollars) in donations. A second committee, consisting of members William Dietz, Jacob Rupid, Charles Schneider, L.H. Schneider, August Schmedtie, and George Wagner, was appointed to provide support and advice to the board of directors. A committee on resolutions was also formed, consisting of members Frederick Imhoff, L.H. Schneider, and George Wagner. At the end of the special meeting, the committee on resolutions reported out a series of resolutions denouncing the city's desecration of the cemetery; declaring the city's action illegal and taken in support of a real estate syndicate which sought to profit from the street extension; asking the PHC board of directors to sue the city commissioners civilly and criminally; and establishing a committee to meet with House and Senate District Committees, the President of the United States, and the city commissioners to inform them of <b>the</b> <b>events</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> two years. L.H. Schneider successfully amended one resolution to denounce the six men who filed incorporated the GESPHC and subdivided the cemetery. Each resolution passed overwhelmingly.|$|E

After reading a {{newspaper}} story about a beauty queen who died of a drug overdose, Bill views the body at the morgue and identifies it as Mandy. [...] Bill is summoned to Ziegler's house, where he is confronted with <b>the</b> <b>events</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> night and day. Ziegler was one of those involved with the ritual orgy, and identified Bill and his connection with Nick. Ziegler claims that he had Bill followed for his own protection, and that the warnings made against Bill by the society are only intended to scare him from speaking about the orgy. However, he implies the society is capable of acting on their threats. Bill asks about the death of Mandy, whom Ziegler has identified as the masked woman at the party who'd [...] "sacrificed" [...] herself to prevent Bill's punishment, and about the disappearance of Nick, the piano player. Ziegler insists that Nick is safely back at his home in Seattle. Ziegler also says the [...] "punishment" [...] was a charade by the secret society to further frighten Bill, and {{it had nothing to do}} with Mandy's death; she was a hooker and addict and had died from another accidental drug overdose. Bill does not know if Ziegler is telling him the truth about Nick's disappearance or Mandy's death, but he says nothing further. When he returns home, Bill finds the rented mask on his pillow next to his sleeping wife. He breaks down in tears and decides to tell Alice the whole truth of the past two days. The next morning, they go Christmas shopping with their daughter. Alice muses that they should be grateful that they have survived, that she loves him and there is something they must do as soon as possible. When Bill asks what it is, she replies, [...] "Fuck".|$|E
