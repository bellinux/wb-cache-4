40|$|Pneumatic {{injection}} of calcium carbide and, in some cases, fluxes via a submerged lance {{has become the}} accepted way <b>to</b> <b>desulphurise</b> crude molten iron, as tapped from a blast furnace or COREX furnace. A number of complex phenomena take place during the injection process which require {{an investigation of the}} kinetics, thermodynamics, transport processes and overall process dynamics of both the molten iron and the top-slag layer to predict the dynamic removal of sulphur from hot metal. A one dimensional model in terms of lance injection depth is presented, which is dynamically updated {{for the duration of the}} blow. The model takes into account the kinetics, thermodynamics and transport processes to predict the sulphur levels in the hot metal throughout a blow. A sensitivity analysis is performed to aid in the optimal selection of operating parameters. The model was implemented in MATLAB® and calibrated with data from the Mittal Steel plant in Saldanha, South Africa. The modelling results are significant in that it allows the selection of operating conditions to minimize the processing time for desulphurisation, and the minimization of the heat loss (that has to be regained in the subsequent steelmaking operations). © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|In 2016, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) {{decided on}} global {{regulations}} to reduce sulphur {{emissions to air}} from maritime shipping starting 2020. The regulation implies that ships can continue to use residual fuels with a high sulphur content, such as heavy fuel oil (HFO), if they employ scrubbers <b>to</b> <b>desulphurise</b> the exhaust gases. Alternatively, they can use fuels with less than 0. 5 % sulphur, such as desulphurised HFO, distillates (diesel) or liquefied natural gas (LNG). The options of lighter fuels and desulphurisation entail costs, including higher energy consumption at refineries, and the present study identifies and compares compliance options {{as a function of}} ship type and operational patterns. The results indicate distillates as an attractive option for smaller vessels, while scrubbers will be an attractive option for larger vessels. For all vessels, apart from the largest fuel consumers, residual fuels desulphurised to less than 0. 5 % sulphur are also a competing abatement option. Moreover, we analyse the interaction between global SOX reductions and CO 2 (and fuel consumption), and the results indicate that the higher fuel cost for distillates will motivate shippers to lower speeds, which will offset the increased CO 2 emissions at the refineries. Scrubbers, in contrast, will raise speeds and CO 2 emissions...|$|E

40|$|Abstract – The smelter at Bindura Nickel Corporation {{processes}} concentrates {{from its}} own mines and other external sources. Concentrates are dried, smelted, and converted <b>to</b> a <b>desulphurised</b> matte (leach alloy) for further processing at the refinery. The smelter comprises a drying plant, submerged arc electric furnace, electrostatic precipitator, and three Peirce-Smith type converters capable of treating 150 000 tonnes of concentrates per year. Concentrates are dried in a rotary coal-fired kiln, blended with fluxes, and smelted in a six-in-line submerged-arc 15 MW electric furnace. Slag is tapped and granulated for disposal, and matte is tapped at regular intervals for blowing in Peirce-Smith converters. The paper details the 37 -year history of the smelter, including furnace rebuilds and operating parameters as they have evolved in response to changing feed compositions. Special challenges, particularly relating {{to the treatment of}} high talc concentrates, are also described...|$|R
40|$|Preem Refinery consumes {{large amounts}} of energy in their plants. Due {{to the fact that}} the fluids cause fouling in units, the heat {{transfer}} in heat exchangers and heaters are deteriorated. This eventually results in a high consumption of fuel. The energy use in the heater is also affected by the amount of excess air, incoming flows and temperatures. The work is based on the SynSat plant. The system that is studied consists of four heat exchangers placed in series followed by a gas-fired heater. The task of the system is to deliver gas oil <b>to</b> the <b>desulphurising</b> reactor at an adequate temperature. The modelling was performed in Matlab and the calculations were carried out in three steps: - Calculation of the instantaneous fouling - Calculation of the temperature profile in the heat exchanger train at existing operating conditions. - Optimisation of the fuel consumption. The model is based on detailed information from the process regarding temperatures and flows as well as the unit geometries. Two different operating conditions have been used as references. 2002 - 03 - 08 when the units showed a substantial amount of fouling and also 2003 - 08 - 02 when both the heat exchangers and the heater were recently cleaned. The presence of fouling mainly affects the fuel consumption by giving a lower temperature from the heat exchangers. Therefore a larger temperature increase must occur in the heater to achieve the specified reactor temperature. Fouling deteriorates the heat transfer in the heater and increases the fuel consumption further. The result of this work is a tool that can be used to investigate and optimise the fuel efficiency when producing MK 1 in the SynSat plant. Since the modelling is performed in Matlab it is too complicated to implement in the daily work at Preem Refinery. The advantages are that it can be modified to corporate with other product qualities and also to be developed for application on other plants. Through statistical methods the model may be simplified and transferred to a user-friendlier interface, e. g. Excel. When producing MK 1 it is the custom to bypass the heat exchangers 15 E 15, 15 E 2 and 15 E 3 by 70 % and to maximize the use of 15 E 4. The calculations show that maximum use of all heat exchangers results in the minimum use of fuel. However, this solution only reduces the consumption with approximately 1, 5 %. For the case with fouling in the system the fuel consumption can de reduced. This is achieved by using the heat exchangers as much as possible. Compared to the fouled reference case the consumption may be reduced as much as 13 %. The results may seem somewhat trivial, which is caused by the fact that the temperature limitations haven't led to any constraints in the two cases. The results would probably have been very different if MK 3 was studied instead of MK 1, since MK 3 usually implies larger flows and higher temperature demands...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} use {{of fossil}} fuels has led to increased emissions of sulphur oxides into the air, which is {{a major cause of}} acid rain. Legislation already adopted in 2009 stipulates that the maximum level of sulphur allowed in fuels is only 10 ppm. The process of hydrodesulphurization (HDS) used in refineries is based on very expensive physico-chemical techniques, and has limitations in the removal of organic sulphur. As for stricter legislation on the maximum levels of sulphur in fossil fuels, the most HDS recalcitrant compounds needs to be removed. This implies an increase in the intensity of the physical-chemical treatment and inherently its associated costs. As a result, the recalcitrant compounds to HDS represent a significant barrier to the achievement of very low levels of sulphur in some petroleum fractions. The alternative to the physical-chemical treatment could be the use of biological processes (biodesulphurisation) which is more effective for the desulphurization of fossil fuels, especially as the removal of sulphur covalently bound to organic matrices. The biodesulphurisation (BDS) occurs in more mild conditions of operation under conditions of atmospheric pressure and temperature, giving greater specificity of reaction {{due to the nature of}} the biocatalysts, not requiring molecular hydrogen. Thus, in the last 15 years there has been an increase of studies involving the use of microorganisms with the ability to specifically remove the HDS recalcitrant sulphur compounds. Several model compounds such as dibenzothiophene (DBT), DBT sulphone or benzothiophene (BT) are used in BDS studies to characterise organic sulphur in coal, coal tars and crude oils. The desulphurising microorganisms are able to remove the sulphur atom from these compounds and use it in their metabolism. However, such compounds are very toxic to the cells. The aim of this work was to evaluate the toxicity of several compounds used in BDS studies, such as DBT and its derivatives and organic solvents used to dissolve these hydrocarbons, <b>to</b> two typical <b>desulphurising</b> strains, namely: Gordonia alkanivorans strain 1 B and Rhodococcus eritropolis strain D 1. The toxicity bioassays evaluated the inhibitory effect of the studied compounds to the described bacteria by measuring the respiration rate (mg O 2 /l) under defined conditions in the presence of different concentrations of those compounds. The inhibitory or toxic effect of each chemical at a specific concentration is expressed as a percent of the baseline respiration rate. From these results the several IC 50 s were estimated and are described in Table 1. These toxicity values showed that strain 1 B was less sensitive for almost all of the hydrocarbons, which is an important advantage considering the desulphurisation of fossil fuels process. On the other hand, strain 1 B was more sensitive to dimethylformamide (DMF), a typical solvent used in BDS studies. However, a good correlation can be observed between IC 50 - 1 B versus IC 50 -D 1 (IC 50 -D 1 = 0. 504 x IC 50 - 1 B + 2. 84; r 2 = 0. 908, p < 0. 05) ...|$|R
40|$|In {{accordance}} with modern regulations and directives, {{the use of}} renewable biomass materials as precursors {{for the production of}} fuels for transportation purposes is to be strictly followed. Even though, there are problems related to processing, storage and handling in wide range of subsequent uses, since there must be a limit to the ratio of biofuels mixed with mineral raw materials. As a key factor with regards to these biomass sources pose a great risk of causing multiple forms of corrosion both to metallic and non-metallic structural materials. To assess the degree of corrosion risk to a variety of engineering alloys like low-carbon and stainless steels widely used as structural metals, this work is dedicated to investigating corrosion rates of economically reasonable engineering steel alloys in mixtures of raw gas oil and renewable biomass fuel sources under typical co-processing conditions. <b>To</b> model a <b>desulphurising</b> refining process, corrosion tests were carried out with raw mineral gasoline and its mixture with used cooking oil and animal waste lard in relative quantities of 10 % (g/g). Co-processing was simulated by batch-reactor laboratory experiments. Experiments were performed at temperatures between 200 and 300 ºC and a pressure in the gas phase of 90 bar containing 2 % (m 3 /m 3) hydrogen sulphide. The time span of individual tests were varied between 1 and 21 days so that we can conclude about changes in the reaction rates against time exposure of and extrapolate for longer periods of exposure. Initial and integral corrosion rates were defined by a weight loss method on standard size of coupons of all sorts of steel alloys. Corrosion rates of carbon steels indicated a linear increase with temperature and little variation with composition of the biomass fuel sources. Apparent activation energies over the first 24 -hour period remained moderate, varying between 35. 5 and 50. 3 kJ mol− 1. Scales developed on carbon steels at higher temperatures were less susceptible to spall and detach. Nonetheless, moderate deceleration of corrosion rates as a function of time are due to the less coherent, frequently spalling and low compactness, higher porosity of the scales evolved at lower and higher temperatures, respectively. On the surface of high alloy steels, sulphide scales of an enhanced barrier nature formed during the induction periods and the layer formation mechanism was found to be assisted by the increasing temperature as initial reaction rates considerably decreased over time. Nevertheless, corrosion-related sulphide conversion of metals and mass loss of the high alloys are strongly affected by the composition of the biomass fuel sources especially animal waste lard. Thermal activation in the first 24 hours decreased from 68. 9 to 35. 2 kJ mol− 1. A greater degree of failure to develop protective sulphide scales was experienced by changing to composition of the biomass fuel sources than the impact of thermal activation between a narrow temperature range at around 100 ºC. In {{accordance with}} the literature, high free fatty acid contents lead to high corrosion rates accounted for direct corrosion of high alloy steels and assisted solubilisation of corrosion products. In addition, the pronounced acceleration of sulphide corrosion is connected to the diminishing inhibition effect of the sulphide scales...|$|R
