40|$|In {{order to}} improve <b>the</b> <b>DO</b> {{condition}} of a lake or sea, authors are developing the liquid film gas dissolution technique. This paper presents a summary of this technique, experimental results of DO improvement, and performance evaluation method for <b>the</b> <b>DO</b> improvement considering <b>the</b> <b>DO</b> concentration of <b>the</b> water to be treated. This DO improvement method transforms the water into bubble clusters which essentially makes water elements of the thin film of bubbles. This method yields a large value of the dissolved gas concentration gradient {{in the water and}} therefore attains an efficient gas dissolution. Also, this method treats deep water utilizing the airlift effect by aeration in the shallow part of the pipe, thus saving energy. The authors have shown experimentally that <b>the</b> <b>DO</b> increment depends on <b>the</b> <b>DO</b> concentration of <b>the</b> water to be treated, and proposed <b>the</b> equivalent <b>DO</b> increment as an index of <b>the</b> <b>DO</b> increment which can be used irrespective of <b>the</b> <b>DO</b> concentration to be treated and which indicates the potential of <b>the</b> <b>DO</b> increment for <b>the</b> same working condition from the theory of the aeration device.

25|$|In Leon Festinger's {{cognitive}} dissonance experiment, {{participants were asked}} to perform a boring task. They were divided into 2 groups and given two different pay scales. At the study's end, some participants were paid $1 to say that they enjoyed the task and another group of participants was paid $20 to say the same lie. The first group ($1) later reported liking the task better than the second group ($20). Festinger's explanation was that for people in the first group being paid only $1 is not sufficient incentive for lying and those who were paid $1 experienced dissonance. They could only overcome that dissonance by justifying their lies by changing their previously unfavorable attitudes about the task. Being paid $20 provides a reason for <b>the</b> <b>doing</b> the boring task, therefore no dissonance.|$|E
