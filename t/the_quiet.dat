5|$|At {{the age of}} 14, O'Hara {{joined the}} Abbey Theatre. Though she was mentored by playwright Lennox Robinson, she found her time at the theatre disappointing. In 1934, {{at the age of}} 15, she won the first Dramatic Prize of the {{national}} competition of the performing arts, the Dublin Feis Award, for her performance as Portia in The Merchant of Venice. She trained as a shorthand typist, working for Crumlin Laundry before joining Eveready Battery Company, where she worked as a typist and bookkeeper. She later put her skills to use when she typed the script of <b>The</b> <b>Quiet</b> Man for John Ford.|$|E
5|$|Before Glöckner's 2003 {{article on}} the origin of the Magnificat, and for some authors still after that, it was {{generally}} assumed that Bach had composed his Magnificat in <b>the</b> <b>quiet</b> time of Advent 1723 for a first performance at the Christmas vespers. For that performance Bach composed four laudes, songs of praise partly in German, partly in Latin to be inserted at certain points in the E-flat major version of the Magnificat. The E-flat major version of the Magnificat including these interpolations is known as BWV 243a.|$|E
5|$|Heyer {{specialised}} in {{two types}} of romantic male leads, which she called Mark I and Mark II. Mark I, with overtones of Mr Rochester, was (in her words) “rude, overbearing, and often a bounder”. Mark II by contrast was debonair, sophisticated, and often a style-icon. Similarly, her heroines (reflecting Austen's division between lively and gentle) fell into two broad groups: the tall and dashing, mannish type, and <b>the</b> <b>quiet</b> bullied type.|$|E

5|$|In December 1976, {{following}} World Record, Banton quit, {{quickly followed}} by Jackson in February 1977. Nic Potter returned to replace Banton, {{and in a}} typically eccentric move Jackson {{was replaced by a}} violinist, Graham Smith (formerly of Charisma folk-rock band String Driven Thing). This line-up produced the album <b>The</b> <b>Quiet</b> Zone/The Pleasure Dome (September 1977). The band also shortened its name to Van der Graaf. Charles Dickie then joined the band on cello, documented on the live double-album Vital, which saw a brief reunion with Jackson. By the time Vital was released, in July 1978, the band had already split, because of lack of record company support in the United States and financial difficulties.|$|E

5|$|In the {{wilderness}} {{of the dance}} floor, Gaga recognizes the wolf-woman she has become and refuses to misrepresent herself any longer. She notes that in <b>the</b> <b>quiet</b> of the night, despite falsehoods and tears, she can feel satisfaction by touching herself. By stroking herself and perhaps her metaphorical wolf-pelt, Gaga is engaging {{in a moment of}} self-acceptance and self-soothing. Lady Gaga realizes that {{it will be difficult to}} maintain her dualistic nature, and alludes to upcoming death when she tells audiences that she is so content that she would welcome death. These words appear to foreshadow the end of , as the singer alludes to a calm acceptance of her spiritual/ghostly side.|$|E

5|$|Kurosawa, with {{producer}} Sōjirō Motoki {{and fellow}} directors and friends Kajiro Yamamoto, Mikio Naruse and Senkichi Taniguchi, formed a new independent production unit called Film Art Association (Eiga Geijutsu Kyōkai). For this organization's debut work, and first film for Daiei studios, Kurosawa {{turned to a}} contemporary play by Kazuo Kikuta and, together with Taniguchi, adapted it for the screen. <b>The</b> <b>Quiet</b> Duel starred Toshiro Mifune as an idealistic young doctor struggling with syphilis, a deliberate attempt by Kurosawa to break the actor away from being typecast as gangsters. Released in March 1949, it was a box office success, but is generally {{considered one of the}} director's lesser achievements.|$|E

5|$|The {{next five}} days saw very heavy {{fighting}} as the Soviets slowly advanced through heavy German defences and repelled German counterattacks. On January 13, bad weather prevented the Soviet side from employing their air force. That day they gained almost no ground and incurred heavy losses.

These included battle groups from the 1st Infantry Division, the 61st Infantry Division, the 5th Mountain Division and the SS Police Division.|$|E
