40|$|Grassed {{buffer strips}} (vegetated filter strips, filter strips, and grassed filters) are vegetated {{surfaces}} {{that are designed}} to treat sheet flow from adjacent surfaces. Filter strips function by slowing runoff velocities and allowing sediment and other pollutants to settle and by providing some infiltration into underlying soils. Filter strips were originally used as an agricultural treatment practice and have more recently evolved into an urban practice. With proper design and maintenance, filter strips can provide relatively high pollutant removal. In addition, the public views them as landscaped amenities and not as stormwater infrastructure. Consequently, there is little resistance to their use. Inspection/Maintenance Considerations Vegetated buffer strips require frequent landscape maintenance. In many cases, vegetated buffer strips initially require intense maintenance, but less maintenance is needed over time. In many cases, maintenance tasks can be completed by a landscaping contractor. Maintenance requirements typically include grass or shrub-growing activities such as irrigation, mowing, <b>trimming,</b> <b>removal</b> of invasive species, and replanting when necessary. Buffer strips require more tending as the volume of sediment increases.

40|$|BackgroundEndovascular {{application}} of pulmonary heart valves has been recently introduced clinically. A tissue-engineering approach was pursued {{to overcome the}} current limitations of bovine jugular vein valves (degeneration and limited longevity). However, deployment of the delicate tissue-engineered valves resulted in severe tissue damage. Therefore {{the objective of this}} study was to prevent tissue damage during the folding and deployment maneuver. Material and MethodsPorcine pulmonary heart valves, small intestinal submucosa, and ovine carotid arteries were obtained from a slaughterhouse. After dissection and antimicrobial incubation, the valves were <b>trimmed</b> (<b>removal</b> of sinus and most of the muscular ring) to fit into the deployment catheter. The inside (in-stent group, n = 6) or outside (out-stent group, n = 6) of a nitinol stent was covered by an acellular small intestinal submucosa, and the valves were sutured into the stent. The valves were folded, tested for placement in the deployment catheter, and decellularized enzymatically. Myofibroblasts were obtained from carotid artery segments and seeded onto the scaffolds. The seeded constructs were placed in a dynamic bioreactor system and cultured for 16 consecutive days. After endothelial cell seeding, the constructs were folded, deployed, and processed for histology and surface electron microscopy. ResultsThe valves opened and closed competently throughout the entire dynamic culture. Surface electron microscopy revealed an almost completely preserved tissue in the in-stent group. Stents covered with small intestinal submucosa on the outside, however, showed severe damage.

40|$|Abstract Background Next {{generation}} sequencing (NGS) {{is widely}} used in metagenomic and transcriptomic analyses in biodiversity. The ease of data generation provided by NGS platforms has allowed researchers to perform these analyses on their particular study systems. In particular the 454 platform has become the preferred choice for PCR amplicon based biodiversity surveys because it generates the longest sequence reads. Nevertheless, the handling and organization of massive amounts of sequencing data poses {{a major problem for}} the research community, particularly when multiple researchers are involved in data acquisition and analysis. An integrated and user-friendly tool, which performs quality control, read <b>trimming,</b> PCR primer <b>removal,</b> and data organization is desperately needed, therefore, to make data interpretation fast and manageable. Findings We developed CANGS DB (Cleaning and Analyzing Next Generation Sequences DataBase) a flexible, stand alone and user-friendly integrated database tool. CANGS DB is specifically designed to organize and manage the massive amount of sequencing data arising from various NGS projects. CANGS DB also provides an intuitive user interface for sequence trimming and quality control, taxonomy analysis and rarefaction analysis. Our database tool can be easily adapted to handle multiple sequencing projects in parallel with different sample information, amplicon sizes, primer sequences, and quality thresholds, which makes this software especially useful for non-bioinformaticians. Furthermore, CANGS DB is especially suited for projects where multiple users need to access the data. CANGS DB is available at [URL]. Conclusion CANGS DB provides a simple and user-friendly solution to process, store and analyze 454 sequencing data. Being a local database that is accessible through a user-friendly interface, CANGS DB provides the perfect tool for collaborative amplicon based biodiversity surveys without requiring prior bioinformatics skills. </p...|$|R
40|$|DNA reads {{generated}} by large-scale sequencing projects {{have to be}} processed before further analyses in order to perform vector/primer masking, low-quality <b>trimming</b> and contaminant <b>removal.</b> This sequential processing involves several steps {{and the use of}} different computer programs, each one following its own calling convention and input/output formats. As a consequence, building a sequence processing pipeline is generally a tedious and exhaustive task. In addition, the currently available pipelines are often poorly documented, requiring careful examination of Perl, Python or shellscript codes before they can be properly configured. Some others are more specialized to perform determined functions [1, 2], not allowing the incorporation of new modules in an integrated way. This paper reports the development of E-Gene, an integrated system that makes pipeline construction a modular job. We have created a unified view of the building blocks of the pipeline and of the integration pattern of the various processing steps.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{removing}} or trimming the chelipeds at various molt stages on regeneration, molt interval (MI) and specific growth rate (SGR) were determined in mud crab Scylla serrata. These strategies {{in combination with}} provision of shelters and food were tested in relation to survival and growth. Hatchery-reared S. serrata juveniles (1. 3 Ã¢â¬â 2. 2 g body weight) in the postmolt, intermolt, and premolt stages were subjected to autotomy of two chelipeds, and trimming of dactylus and pollex. Intact crabs served as the control group. Interval from stocking to first molt was significantly longer in crabs autotomized at intermolt or premolt than in trimmed or intact crabs, but was similar to intact crabs when autotomy was done at postmolt. However, MI from first to second molts was longer compared to intact crabs when chelipeds were removed or trimmed at premolt. After the first molt, autotomy and not trimming caused significant decrease in SGR. The SGRs {{at the end of}} the test were similar to intact crabs (postmolt: 7. 90 ÃÂ± 0. 39, intermolt: 5. 64 ÃÂ± 0. 50) when trimming of chelipeds was done at postmolt (8. 01 ÃÂ± 0. 75) or intermolt (4. 38 ÃÂ± 0. 40). However, SGR was lower when premolt crabs were subjected to autotomy (4. 11 ÃÂ± 0. 67) and trimming (5. 29 ÃÂ± 1. 40) than when chelipeds were intact (9. 45 ÃÂ± 0. 47). A two-factor experiment was conducted in the second phase where intermolt crabs with autotomized or trimmed chelipeds (factor A) were either fed or starved but provided with shelters or fed but without shelters (factor B). After 10 days, higher survival was obtained in crabs with autotomized (95. 55 ÃÂ± 2. 94 %) or trimmed chelipeds (93. 33 ÃÂ± 3. 33 %) than in intact crabs (73. 33 ÃÂ± 6. 67 %). Survival was not affected by factor B, but higher final mean body weights were attained in fed crabs with (0. 78 ÃÂ± 0. 04 g) or without shelters (0. 74 ÃÂ± 0. 04 g) than unfed ones (0. 48 ÃÂ± 0. 04 g). A third experiment was conducted to verify these results. Crabs with trimmed or intact chelipeds were either fed or unfed. No shelters were provided. Crabs with trimmed chelipeds (88. 57 ÃÂ± 0 %) had higher survival than intact crabs (59. 76 ÃÂ± 7. 56 %) regardless of whether they were fed or starved; and fed crabs (0. 82 ÃÂ± 0. 04 g) had higher mean body weight than unfed crabs (0. 61 ÃÂ± 0. 07 g) regardless of whether chelipeds were intact or trimmed.

40|$|As the {{technology}} nodes keep shrinking following Moore 2 Ì 7 s law, lithography becomes increasingly {{critical to the}} fabrication of integrated circuits. The 193 nm ArF immersion lithography (193 i) has been a common technique for manufacturing integrated circuits. However, the 193 i with single exposure has finally reached its printability limit at the 28 nm technology node. To keep the pace of Moore 2 Ì 7 s law, design for manufacturability (DFM) is demonstrated to be effective and cost-efficient. The concept of DFM is to modify the design of integrated circuits {{in order to make}} them more manufacturable. Tremendous efforts have been made for DFM in advanced lithography technologies. In general, the progress can be summarized in four directions. (1) Advanced lithography process by novel patterning techniques and next-generation lithography; (2) High performance lithography simulation approach in mask synthesis; (3) Physical design (PD) methodology with lithography manufacturability awareness; (4) Robust design flow integrating emerging PD challenges. Accordingly, we propose our research topics in those directions. (1) Throughput optimization for self-aligned double patterning (SADP) and e-beam lithography based manufacturing of 1 D layout; (2) Design of efficient rasterization algorithm for mask patterns in inverse lithography technology (ILT); (3) SADP-aware detailed routing; (4) SADP-aware detailed routing with consideration of double via insertion and via manufacturability; (5) Pin accessibility driven detailed placement refinement. In our first research work, we investigate throughput optimization of 1 D layout manufacturing. SADP is a mature lithography technique to print 1 D gridded layout for advanced technologies. However, in 16 nm technology node, trim mask pattern in SADP lithography process may not be printable using 193 i along within a single exposure. A viable solution is to complement SADP with e-beam lithography. To order to increase the throughput of 1 D layout manufacturing, we consider the problem of e-beam shot minimization subject to bounded line-end extension constraints. Two different approaches of utilizing the trim mask and e-beam to print a 1 D layout are considered. The first approach is trimming by end cutting, in which trim mask and e-beam are used to chop up parallel lines at required locations by small fixed rectangles. The second approach is <b>trimming</b> by gap <b>removal,</b> in which <b>trim</b> mask and e-beam are used to rid of all unnecessary portions. We propose elegant integer linear program formulations for both approaches. Experimental results show that both integer linear program formulations can be solved efficiently and have a major speedup compared with previous related work. Furthermore, {{the pros and cons of}} the two approaches for manufacturing 1 D layout are discussed. In our second research work, we focus on a critical problem of lithography simulation in the design of ILT mask. To reduce the complexity of modern lithography simulation, a widely used approach is to first rasterize the ILT mask before it is inputted to the simulation tool. Accordingly, we propose a high performance rasterization algorithm. The algorithm is based on a pre-computed look-up table. Every pixel in the rasterized image is firstly identified its category: exception or non-exception. Then convolution for every pixel can be performed by a single or multiple look-up table queries depending on its category. In addition, the proposed algorithm has shift invariant property and can be applied for all-angle mask patterns in ILT. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can speedup conventional rasterization process by almost 500 x while maintaining small variations in critical dimension. In our third research work, we concentrate on SADP-aware detailed routing. SADP is a promising manufacturing option for sub- 22 nm technology nodes due to its good overlay control. To ensure layout is manufacturable by SADP, it is necessary to consider it during layout configuration, e. g., detailed routing stage. However, SADP process is not intuitive in terms of mask design, and considering it during detailed routing stage is even more challenging. We investigate both of two popular types of SADP: spacer-is-dielectric and spacer-is-metal. Different from previous works, we apply the color pre-assignment idea and propose an elegant graph model which captures both routing and SADP manufacturing cost. They greatly simplify the problem to maintain SADP design rules during detailed routing. A negotiated congestion based rip-up and reroute scheme is applied to achieve good routability while maintaining SADP design rules. Our approach can be extended to consider other multiple patterning lithography during detailed routing, e. g., self-aligned quadruple patterning targeted at sub- 10 nm technology nodes. Compared with state-of-the-art academic SADP-aware detailed routers, we offer routing solution with better quality of result. In our fourth research work, we extend our SADP-aware detailed routing to consider other manufacturing issues. Both SADP and triple patterning lithography (TPL) are potential layout manufacturing techniques in 10 nm technology node. While metal layers can be printed by SADP, via layer manufacturing requires TPL. Previous works on SADP-aware detailed routing do not automatically guarantee via layer are manufacturable by TPL. We extend our SADP-aware detailed routing to consider TPL manufacturability of via layer. Double via insertion is an effective method to improve yield and reliability in integrated circuits manufacturing. We also consider it in our SADP-aware detailed routing to further improve insertion rate. A problem of TPL-aware double via insertion in the post routing stage is proposed. It is solved by both integer linear programming and high-performance heuristic. Experimental results demonstrate that our SADP-aware detailed routing can ensure via layer are TPL manufacturable and improve double via insertion rate. In our last research work, we target at the enhancement of pin access. The significant increased number of routing design rules in advanced technologies has made pin access an emerging difficultly in detailed routing. Resolving pin access in detailed routing may be too late due to the fix pin locations. Thus, we consider pin access in earlier design stage, i. e., detailed placement stage, when perturbation of cell placement is allowed. A cost function is proposed to model pin access for each pin-to-pin connection in detailed routing. A two-phase detailed placement refinement is performed to improve pin access, and refinement techniques are limited to cell flipping, same-row adjacent cell swap and cell shifting. The problem is solved by dynamic programming and linear programming. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed detailed placement refinement improve pin access and reduce the number of unroutable nets in detailed routing significantly...|$|R
