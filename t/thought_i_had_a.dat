500|$|When {{asked about}} Barris's claim {{of being a}} CIA assassin, Clooney commented, [...] "I don't know how much I {{believed}} it. I didn't want to officially ask him, because I didn't want him to say, 'I made it up.' I wanted {{to tell the story}} and I thought how interesting, if it was all made up, why someone as wealthy and as successful as Chuck Barris would have to do that. I thought that was an interesting person to explore, and that's {{what we wanted to do}} with the film." [...] (Barris had already admitted he had made the story up in a 1984 interview promoting the book; he wrote the story in large part because he had been exiled from television over the controversy surrounding one of his shows, 3's a Crowd. In the same interview, Barris noted that he had applied for work with the CIA in the early 1960s but never actually entered the agency; Confessions of a Dangerous Mind was the product of Barris imagining how he could have done both at the same time.) Clooney acknowledged that his upbringing with father Nick Clooney had a great bearing on his choice of depicting the 1960/70s game shows. [...] "My father had a game show when I was growing up called The Money Maze. I know what those sets look like. I showed the guy how to do cue cards. I grew up on them," [...] the director reflected, [...] "and knew what it looked like and smelled like. And I know something about some of the trappings of fame, so I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> unique take on it." ...|$|E
500|$|The next {{race was}} the Breeders' Cup Classic on November 1. Because many leading older horses retired in 2014, {{most of the}} main contenders for the 2014 Classic were the three year olds: in {{addition}} to California Chrome, former foes Bayern, Candy Boy and Tonalist entered. His chief rival {{was considered to be}} the then-undefeated American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt, Shared Belief, a gelding who missed the Triple Crown series due to hoof problems; the two had never faced each other. California Chrome was 4-1 on the morning line, second favorite to Shared Belief. In the race, Bayern bumped into Shared Belief at the start, then took the lead {{for the duration of the}} race. California Chrome was clear of traffic, maintained third place for most of the race, was closing at the end, and finished a very close third, only a neck behind winner Bayern, who won by a nose over second-place finisher Toast of New York. Shared Belief was fourth. Post race analysis noted that California Chrome stayed on the outside throughout the race, and actually ran 44 feet farther than the winner. [...] Sherman spoke in positive terms of the horse's finish, stating, [...] "My horse ran his eyeballs out. He was right there, right down to the money. I thought it was a great effort. He came back strong." [...] Espinoza was less enthusiastic: [...] "On the backstretch I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> chance to win... The last sixteenth [...] was digging as hard as he could, but getting just a little tired. I wish he had one more race. It was a little too much for him today." [...] Coburn visited the colt the following day and stated, [...] "He was full of himself. I think he thought he won. And if the race had been just a little bit longer, I believe he would have." ...|$|E
2500|$|Colbert {{disagreed}} {{that the}} show's emphasis on politics represented a liberal bias, {{noting that he}} himself was uninterested in modern politics. He believed that political issues reflect basic human behavior, which he viewed as his satirical specialty, noting, [...] "If I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> political point, I'd be in big trouble." [...] In another interview, Colbert remarked, [...] "I'm not someone with a particular political ax to grind. I'm a comedian. I love hypocrisy." ...|$|E

2500|$|At {{the end of}} the 2010–11 season, Perry won the Hart Memorial Trophy, {{prevailing}} over finalists Daniel Sedin and Martin St. Louis, as the League's {{regular season}} MVP. [...] "You don't know what to expect when you come to this thing," [...] Perry said by phone. [...] "You don't want to expect to win. But then you hear your name. I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> great chance, but you look at the other two guys and they had great chances as well." [...] He became the first Ducks player to win the Hart Trophy and the first Ducks player to win the Maurice [...] "Rocket" [...] Richard Trophy since Teemu Selänne in 1999.|$|E
2500|$|Mahan {{also played}} for Harvard's varsity {{baseball}} team for three years. In {{an exhibition game}} {{in the spring of}} 1916, Mahan pitched a shutout against the Boston Red Sox, the year after the Red Sox team featuring Babe Ruth and Tris Speaker won the 1915 World Series. [...] Mahan was offered a contract by several major league clubs, but none was willing to meet his demand for a salary of $6,500. Mahan described his negotiations {{in an interview with the}} Oakland Tribune:"I had a chance first to go with the Boston Red Sox when I was in my senior year at Harvard. They said to name my price and I named $6,500. They thought it was too much. Then the Detroit club made an offer to me but they too <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> gold-brick scheme. The Chicago White Sox were willing to give me a good contract with a bonus if I made good, but the risk was not worth the undertaking. I considered the Braves more seriously than any other team but my negotiations there too were not satisfactory ..." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lightbody had a [...] "long-term ambition" [...] {{of making}} a country album and {{revealed}} the project's existence in May 2009. In the interview, he expressed his love for country music, which {{he said he had}} loved for a long time: [...] "I always <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> country album in me and it turns out I did." [...] The rest of Snow Patrol expressed excitement for their band-mate, [...] "delighted that [...] getting to exercise all his crazy ideas." [...] In October 2009, Lightbody in his blog on Snow Patrol's website revealed the members of the group to be Richard Colburn (of Belle & Sebastian), Iain Archer, singer Miriam Kaufmann (Archer's wife), and Jacknife Lee. He talked about two more members whom he was very excited about, but didn't name them. He also stated that the album won't be country as was being reported, but would be [...] "country-tinged". In January 2010, Hot Press reported Peter Buck (of R.E.M.) {{to be a member of}} the group. Lightbody described Buck as one of his [...] "all-time heroes" [...] and admired his talent for playing a variety of instruments.|$|E

2500|$|During {{the initial}} {{interview}} on 30 May 2011, Burke explained on Liveline {{that she had}} [...] "a tape somewhere around but I cant find it, its twelve years old and I don't know {{whether it would be}} viable now". Also, when Burke was asked if she had a tape while being interviewed on [...] on 31 May 2011 by Caitriona Perry, Perry asserted that [...] "despite originally believing that she had a recording of the interview, Helen Lucy Burke is now not so sure". Burke explained, [...] "I don't think so, I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> taped cassette, {{but it turns out that}} it was in the one, I wasn't able to open it because it was a different length from the one in my existing cassette box". When Caitriona Perry asked [...] "do you think you have a tape anywhere else", Burke replied [...] "it could be under the mountains of stuff that came down when my ceiling came in". In the last days of the campaign the tape was released and according to the Irish Independent, Ms. Burke [...] "said yesterday she found the tape recently but only released it in the last days of the campaign for “impact.” She said “it would give people something to think about when they went to the polls.|$|E
2500|$|Ringer {{said after}} the game, {{referring}} to being drafted late [...] "I {{think a lot of}} people <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> lot of wear and tear on me, too much, so they didn’t know how much I have left, I just kind of laughed it off. I still feel good, and I think because of all that I’ll never be complacent. I feel like I want to prove myself even more, and prove a lot of people wrong. Everything happens for a reason, though." [...] Titans quarterback Kerry Collins said of Ringer [...] "He is a good football player. Some guys are just football players, and Javon Ringer is a football player. He is patient, remarkably patient for a rookie running back. He sees blocking schemes well and has a good feel for when to cut back and when not to cut back. He has shown a lot of moves. I think the kid has a bright future.” Titans linebacker Keith Bulluck also said “He has an understanding of the game, you can tell by the cuts he makes at times. The way he runs, and the way that he pays attention. You don’t see the coaches get on him much for messing up, so that’s big for a rookie. I’ve been impressed.’’ Tackle Michael Roos also added in, “He sees the block in progress, He can tell when a block is going to be made and he trusts that it will be made, so sometimes he is cutting before the block has even been made. You don’t see that a lot. A few people have that, and he has definitely got it. Hopefully he can get reps with the (first team) a little more and see where it goes from there.’’ ...|$|E
