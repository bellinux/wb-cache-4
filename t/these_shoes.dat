5|$|Concealed shoes {{hidden in}} the fabric of a {{building}} have been discovered in many European countries, as well as {{in other parts of the}} world, since at least the early modern period. Independent researcher Brian Hoggard has observed that the locations in which <b>these</b> <b>shoes</b> are typically found– in chimneys, under floors, above ceilings, around doors and windows, in the roof– suggest that some may have been concealed as magical charms to protect the occupants of the building against evil influences such as demons, ghosts and witches. Others may have been intended to bestow fertility on a female member of the household, or been an offering to a household deity.|$|E
5|$|Since {{at least}} the early modern period it was a common custom to hide objects such as written charms, dried cats, horse skulls, and witch bottles in the {{structure}} of a building, but concealed shoes are by far the most common items discovered. Archaeologist Brian Hoggard has observed that the locations in which <b>these</b> <b>shoes</b> are found suggest that at least some were concealed as magical charms to protect the occupants of the building against evil influences. Such hidden caches of objects are known by archaeologists as spiritual middens.|$|E
25|$|The next {{substantially}} different form of pointe shoe appeared in Italy {{in the late}} 19th century. Dancers like Pierina Legnani wore shoes with a sturdy, flat platform at {{the front end of}} the shoe, rather than the more sharply pointed toe of earlier models. <b>These</b> <b>shoes</b> also included a box—made of layers of fabric—for containing the toes, and a stiffer, stronger sole. They were constructed without nails and the soles were only stiffened at the toes, making them nearly silent.|$|E

25|$|Orthopedic {{shoes are}} specially-designed {{footwear}} to relieve discomfort associated with many foot and ankle disorders, such as blisters, bunions, calluses and corns, hammer toes, plantar fasciitis, or heel spurs. They {{may also be}} worn by individuals with diabetes or people with unequal leg length. <b>These</b> <b>shoes</b> typically have a low heel, tend to be wide with a particularly wide toe box, and have a firm heel to provide extra support. Some may also have a removable insole, or orthotic, to provide extra arch support.|$|E
25|$|In 2013, with advancements in technology, Nike used Kevlar in {{shoes for}} the first time. It {{launched}} the Elite II Series, with enhancements to its earlier version of basketball shoes by using Kevlar in the anterior {{as well as the}} shoe laces. This was done to decrease the elasticity of the tip of the shoe in contrast to nylon used conventionally as Kevlar expanded by about 1% against nylon which expanded by about 30%. Shoes in this range included LeBron, HyperDunk and Zoom Kobe VII. However <b>these</b> <b>shoes</b> were launched at a price range much higher than average cost of basketball shoes. It was also used in the laces for the adidas F50 adiZero Prime football boot.|$|E
25|$|As barefoot running {{became popular}} {{by the late}} 20th and early 21st century, many modern shoe {{manufacturers}} have recently designed footwear that mimic this experience, maintaining optimum flexibility and natural walking while also providing some degree of protection. Termed as Minimalist shoes, their purpose is to allow one's feet and legs to feel more subtly the impacts and forces involved in running, allowing finer adjustments in running style. Some of <b>these</b> <b>shoes</b> include the Vibram FiveFingers, Nike Free, and Saucony's Kinvara and Hattori. Mexican huaraches are also very simple running shoes, similar to the shoes worn by the Tarahumara people of northern Mexico, who {{are known for their}} distance running abilities. Wrestling shoes are also very light and flexible shoes that are designed to mimic bare feet while providing additional traction and protection.|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, shoe {{products}} are imported {{in different ways}} to Ethiopia, and many imported shoe customers also purchase <b>these</b> imported <b>shoe</b> products. As <b>these</b> <b>shoe</b> products imported from outside, the country also has its own shoe factories, which provide different types of shoe products, and currently suffering because of high competition from imported shoes. This study assesses product differentiator reasons of customers who prefer imported shoes over locally produced ones, taking the case of imported shoe customers and retail distributors of Awassa town which is 275 kms far from Addis Ababa to the south. The study relied on a sample of 750 Awassa town imported shoe customers and all imported shoe retail distributors. The data collection based. on 6 product differentiators namely; quality, price, durability, repairability, easiness to clean, and fashionability of a shoe and the data is collected through questionnaire and interview. The result of the data analysed using percentages and summarization tables show quality, fashion ability, durability and price are the four major product differentiator reasons of customers to prefer imported shoes to locally produced ones. ~Jimma Universit...|$|R

25|$|Athletic {{shoes are}} {{specifically}} designed to be worn for participating in various sports. Since friction between the foot and the ground is an important force in most sports, modern athletic shoes are designed to maximize this force, and materials, such as rubber, are used. Although, for some activities such as dancing or bowling, sliding is desirable, so shoes designed for these activities often have lower coefficients of friction. The earliest athletic shoes {{date back to the}} mid 19th century were track spikes— leather shoes with metal cleats on the soles to provide increased friction during running. They were developed by J.W. Foster & Sons, which later become known as Reebok. By the end of the 19th century, Spalding also manufactured <b>these</b> <b>shoes</b> as well. Adidas started selling shoes with track spikes in them for running and soccer in 1925. Spikes were eventually added to shoes for baseball and American football in the 20th century. Golfers also use shoes with small metal spikes on their soles to prevent slipping during their swing.|$|E

50|$|When training, {{shoes with}} extra support are {{recommended}} because lighter shoes {{do not provide}} sufficient cushioning. Unsupportive shoes can potentially cause injuries.

500|$|Olajuwon, {{who earlier}} in his career signed a shoe {{endorsement}} deal with LA Gear, later became the face of Spalding's athletic shoe line and endorsed The Dream, a sneaker that retailed in various outlets (such as Payless ShoeSource) for $34.99. This {{made him one of}} the very few well-known players in any professional sport to endorse a sneaker not from Nike, Reebok, Adidas, or other high-visibility retail brands. As Olajuwon declared: [...] "How can a poor working mother with three boys buy Nikes or Reeboks that cost $120?...She can't. So kids steal <b>these</b> <b>shoes</b> from stores and from other kids.

[...] The shoes were well received by the critics, though considered to be pricey. Desiree Stimpert of About.com said, [...] " ... <b>these</b> <b>shoes</b> aren't for everyone, but will most definitely appeal to fans of Ms. Stefani's music and fashion - sense."

2500|$|Shoes {{specific}} to the sport of basketball were developed by Chuck Taylor, and are popularly known as Chuck Taylor All-Stars. <b>These</b> <b>shoes,</b> first sold in 1917, are double-layer canvas shoes with rubber soles and toe caps, and a high heel (known as a [...] "high top") for added support. In 1969, Taylor {{was inducted into the}} Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in recognition of this development, and in the 1970s, other shoe manufacturers, such as Nike, Adidas, Reebok, and others began imitating this style of athletic shoe. In April 1985, Nike introduced its own brand of basketball shoe which would become popular in its own right, the Air Jordan, named after the then-rookie Chicago Bulls basketball player, Michael Jordan. The Air Jordan line of shoes sold $100 million in their first year.|$|E

All the details are performed by the ingenious application of the mechanic powers; and all the parts are characterised by precision, uniformity, and accuracy. As each man performs but one step in the process, which implies no knowledge of what is done by those who go before or follow him, so the persons employed are not shoemakers, but wounded soldiers, {{who are able to}} learn their respective duties in a few hours.
