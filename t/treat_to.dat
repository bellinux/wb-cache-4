5|$|Since Andros' {{commission}} included Connecticut, {{he asked}} Connecticut Governor Robert <b>Treat</b> <b>to</b> surrender the colonial charter {{not long after}} his arrival in Boston. Unlike Rhode Island, whose officials readily acceded to the dominion, Connecticut officials formally acknowledged Andros' authority, but did little to assist him. They continued to run their government according to the charter, holding quarterly meetings of the legislature and electing colony-wide officials, while Treat and Andros negotiated over the surrender of the charter.|$|E

5|$|Charles Onyett of IGN {{found the}} {{gameplay}} enjoyable and {{enough to be}} appreciated by any genre fan. Yet he stated that if players were not Dragon Ball fans, then they will not {{want to play the}} game. Robert Thompson of Nintendojo felt that the game would satisfy fans of both the series and the genre, but he would complain about the ki and Sparking Combo attacks being repetitive, and the story shifting control of the characters, stating it could make unfamiliar gamers disoriented. Ryan Olsen of Kombo.com praised the battle system, calling it more engaging than the ones found in the average RPG. Still he would call the game a cut and dry RPG, calling the Active Guard system the only exotic aspect of the game. Neal Ronaghan of Nintendo World Report called the game vanilla with an interesting twists, stating that the fans should be the ones playing the game. He also drew comparisons of the Active Guard system to the Timed Hit system from Super Mario RPG, and Rage Gage to the Limit Break from Final Fantasy. Brittany Vincent of RPGFan would call side quests like Krillin's return home an added <b>treat</b> <b>to</b> the long story. She pointed out the game's difficulty being frustrating, stating that the game will cause players to revert to the start screen many times, yet is still beatable.|$|E
30|$|Often, {{patients}} who present with SVCS have a contracted life expectancy {{due to their}} underlying disease burden. For these patients, 3 – 4  weeks of daily treatments may be bothersome and are certainly not practical. In the interest of improving patient convenience while maintaining therapeutic outcomes, a shorter fractionation scheme was developed and used at University Hospital in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. A retrospective study of 39 SVCS patients treated with 2 different hypofractionated RT courses from 1986 to 1992 was performed to compare the efficacy and side effects of the different fractionation schemes.  25 patients received a total of 24  Gy in 3 weekly fractions and 7 patients were <b>treated</b> <b>to</b> a total of 16  Gy in 2 weekly fractions. 56  % of patients <b>treated</b> <b>to</b> 24  Gy had a complete response, while only 28  % of patients <b>treated</b> <b>to</b> 16  Gy had a complete response. 96  % of the patients <b>treated</b> <b>to</b> the 24  Gy had a partial response within 4  weeks of treatment, compared to 71  % of patients <b>treated</b> <b>to</b> 16  Gy. Median OS was higher in the group <b>treated</b> <b>to</b> 24  Gy than in the group <b>treated</b> <b>to</b> 16  Gy, 9 versus 3  months, respectively. The most common side effect of treatment was WHO grade 1 dysphagia, which was experienced by 48 and 43  % of the patients <b>treated</b> <b>to</b> 24 and 16  Gy, respectively, and which resolved in most patients by 3  weeks after treatment (Rodrigues et al. 1993).|$|R

He survived the attempt and recorded an album before his health began failing. Lavoe died on June 29, 1993, from a complication of AIDS.|$|E
25|$|The liquid used in Snap-dragon was {{typically}} brandy, although similar flammable liquors {{could also be}} used. Traditionally, raisins were the <b>treat</b> <b>to</b> be snatched; William Sandys specifies Málaga raisins. Other treats, however, could also be used. Of these, almonds were the most common alternative or addition, but currants, candied fruit, figs, grapes, and plums also featured. Salt could also be sprinkled in the bowl. The low bowl {{was typically}} placed {{in the middle of}} a table to prevent damage from the inevitable splashes of burning brandy. In one variation a Christmas pudding is placed in the centre of the bowl with raisins around it.|$|E
25|$|Given {{the disease}} burden of strokes, {{prevention}} {{is an important}} public health concern. Primary prevention is less effective than secondary prevention (as judged by the number needed to <b>treat</b> <b>to</b> prevent one stroke per year). Recent guidelines detail the evidence for primary prevention in stroke. In those who are otherwise healthy, aspirin does not appear beneficial and thus is not recommended. In {{people who have had}} a myocardial infarction or those with a high cardiovascular risk, it provides some protection against a first stroke. In those who have previously had a stroke, treatment with medications such as aspirin, clopidogrel, and dipyridamole may be beneficial. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends against screening for carotid artery stenosis in those without symptoms.|$|E

25|$|Yuvraj is {{primarily}} a left-handed batsman but can bowl part-time left-arm orthodox spin, which he improved {{in the latter part}} of his career. He is regarded as a better batsman against fast bowling than spin bowling, and cites the Indian Oil Cup 2005 as a turning point in his career. Yuvraj is one of the athletic fielders in the Indian team, fielding primarily at point & covers with a good aim at the stumps. Yuvraj is a natural stroke player with an aggressive style of play, as seen by his strike rate of above 150 in T20 internationals & just below 90 in ODIs. Many regard him as one of the best clean strikers of the ball, with his trademark punch through the covers a <b>treat</b> <b>to</b> watch. When in good touch, he can clear the ropes quite effortlessly. A Cricinfo report published in late 2005 showed that since 1999, he was the fourth most prolific fielder in affecting ODI run outs, and of those on the list of prolific fielders, he had the second highest rate of effecting a run out. He was previously often characterised as having attitude problems, but later often assumed leadership positions during Rahul Dravid's tenure as captain.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{above-mentioned}} orders of Feldzeugmeister Ludwig von Welden, the Imperial troops finished on 23 April {{the evacuation of}} Pest, in which at 25 April General Lajos Aulich entered with the II. Hungarian corps. Welden ordered to the brigade led by Major General Franz Wyss to move to Tata, to the brigade led by Major General Franz de Paula Gundaccar II. von Colloredo-Mannsfeld to retreat from Esztergom to Dorog, to the Schwarzenberg division to move from Buda to Esztergom, retreating the Austrian troops from {{the region of the}} Danube Bend (except the garrison of Buda, led by Major General Heinrich Hentzi) and concentrating them around and near Komárom, to be deployable in the eventuality of a battle at Komárom. Welden finally understood that the Hungarian forces which were East from Pest (the II. corps led by Aulich), represented not an overwhelming force, which could have been a real <b>treat</b> <b>to</b> the imperials, if they retreated from their secured positions from Pest and the Danube Bend towards Komárom. This is why they could concentrate their forces around Komárom, to withstand against the main Hungarian forces preparing to attack them there. But Görgei hoped that his plan of misleading the Imperials was still working at that moment, this is why he ordered the crossing of the Danube, to attack the Austrian forces concentrated there, hoping to use his supposed numerical superiority to destroy them, and to encircle with this the forces which he thought were still in the Danube Bend. He was warned, among others by his chief of the general staff Colonel József Bayer, that crossing the Danube to South is a very risky plan, but Görgei did not change his mind.|$|E
