50|$|Three {{additional}} registers {{controlled the}} volume of the channels, as well as turning on or off the optional envelope controls on them. Finally the last three registers controlled the times of the envelope controller, by setting the envelope type and envelope cycle <b>time.</b> <b>Envelope</b> types include sawtooth shape or triangle shape, starting on either maximum or minimum. The shape can also be set to repeat for a cycling effect. As there was only one envelope shared between all three channels, many programmers ignored it and programmed their own envelope controllers in software (controlling volume directly). A well known trick was to run the hardware envelope at cycle times above 20Hz to produce sawtooth or pulse-wave like bass sounds.|$|E

40|$|Time-distance {{analysis}} and acoustic imaging are two related techniques {{to probe the}} local properties of solar interior. In this study, we discuss the relation of phase <b>time</b> and <b>envelope</b> <b>time</b> between the two techniques. The location of the envelope peak of the cross correlation function in time-distance analysis is identified as the travel time of the wave packet formed by modes with the same w/l. The phase time of the cross correlation function provides information of the phase change accumulated along the wave path, including the phase change at {{the boundaries of the}} mode cavity. The acoustic signals constructed with the technique of acoustic imaging contain both phase and intensity information. The phase of constructed signals can be studied by computing the cross correlation function between time series constructed with ingoing and outgoing waves. In this study, we use the data taken with the Taiwan Oscillation Network (TON) instrument and the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) instrument. The analysis is carried out for the quiet Sun. We use the relation of <b>envelope</b> <b>time</b> versus distance measured in time-distance analyses to construct the acoustic signals in acoustic imaging analyses. The phase time of the cross correlation function of constructed ingoing and outgoing time series is twice the difference between the phase <b>time</b> and <b>envelope</b> <b>time</b> in time-distance analyses as predicted. The envelope peak of the cross correlation function between constructed ingoing and outgoing time series is located at zero time as predicted for results of one-bounce at 3 mHz for all four data sets and two-bounce at 3 mHz for two TON data sets. But it is different from zero for other cases. The cause of the deviation of the envelope peak from zero is not known...|$|R

We use a subspace based method (MUSIC) rather than conventional beamforming for the accurate estimation of the direction of arrivals (DOAs) of the source components, and a frequency dependent distance for the correlation of time envelopes.

In this paper, we experimentally show that there exists a large margin for WER reduction by channel selection, and discuss several possible methods which do not require any a-priori classification. Moreover, by using a LVCSR task, a significant WER reduction is shown with a simple technique which uses a measure computed from the sub-band <b>time</b> <b>envelope</b> of the various microphone signals.

40|$|To {{carry out}} {{stochastic}} robustness analysis, an expected probability distribution {{is assigned to}} each uncertain parameter in the system. The Monte Carlo analysis proceeds by repeatedly assigning shaped random values to each plant parameter, evaluating the stability of performance metric, and performing the binary classification (stable/unstable, etc.). If the system is stable, the state response to a unit disturbance impulse can be propagated to establish whether the response would violate settling <b>time</b> <b>envelopes</b> and whether peak actuator use would violate predetermined maximums. The final estimates of the probability of each form of unacceptable behavior are found by dividing {{the number of cases}} in which the overall system had that form of unacceptability by the number of cases run.

40|$|Abstract. One way of {{separating}} sources {{from a single}} mixture recording is by extracting spectral components and then combining them to form estimates of the sources. The grouping process remains a difficult problem. We propose, for instances when multiple mixture signals are available, clustering the components based on their relative contribution to each mixture (i. e., their spatial position). We introduce novel factorizations of magnitude spectrograms from multiple recordings and derive update rules that extend independent subspace analysis and nonnegative matrix factorization to concurrently estimate the spectral shape, <b>time</b> <b>envelope</b> and spatial position of each component.

30|$|Speech and {{background}} noise tend {{to cover the}} same frequency regions in the short-time spectrum. Therefore, speech and noise will be mixed in the outputs of the 15 gammatone filters. The modulation filterbank decomposes each of the 15 <b>time</b> <b>envelopes</b> into a set of nine time-domain signals that correspond to different modulation frequencies. Generally speaking, the outputs of the lowest modulation frequencies are more associated with events demarcating syllable nuclei, while the higher modulation frequencies represent shorter-term events. We {{want to take advantage}} of the fact that it is unlikely that speech and noise sound sources with frequency components in the same gammatone filter also happen to overlap completely in the modulation frequency domain. Stationary noise would not affect the output of the higher modulation frequency filters, while pulsatile noise should not affect the lowest modulation frequency filters. Therefore, we expect that many of the naturally occurring noise sources will show temporal variations at different rates than speech.|$|R

In this study, methods for vibrating ground target detection and feature extraction of the one-stationary bistatic frequency-modulated continuous-wave Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) are studied. The Displaced Phase Center Antenna (DPCA) technique is adopted to suppress the ground clutter, allowing the ground-vibrating targets to be detected. Analysis of the received signal indicates that the DPCA processing results in a slow time-varying envelope, known as the Slow <b>Time</b> <b>Envelope</b> (STE). The STE has a direct effect on the micro-Doppler time-frequency curve, which therefore cannot be obtained unbroken. Furthermore, vibrating features are extracted by utilizing their relationship with the STE term.

40|$|For earthquake-resistant design, {{engineering}} seismologists employ {{time-history analysis}} for nonlinear simulations. The nonstationary stochastic method previously developed by Pousse et al. (2006) has been updated. This method {{has the advantage}} of being both simple, fast and taking into account the basic concepts of seismology (Brune's source, realistic <b>time</b> <b>envelope</b> function, nonstationarity and ground-motion variability). Time-domain simulations are derived from the signal spectrogram and depend on few ground-motion parameters: Arias intensity, significant relative duration and central frequency. These indicators are obtained from empirical attenuation equations that relate them to the magnitude of the event, the source–receiver distance, and the site conditions. We improve the nonstationary stochastic method by using new functional forms (new surface rock dataset, analysis of both intra-event and inter-event residuals, consideration of the scaling relations and VS 30), by assessing the central frequency with S-transform and by better considering the stress drop variability...|$|E
30|$|In {{the case}} of near-surface disturbance, {{the nature of the}} created surface motion and {{magnitude}} of water waves depend upon form of bubble when it reaches the surface. Depending upon the burst depth, this may include a well-formed hollow column, a very high and narrow jet or a low turbulent mound followed by development of a prominent “base surge.” Cole (1948) presented images of the apparent free surface effects and plumes as a function of burst depth. Some other tests indicate that the initial solitary wave is among the characteristics of explosions in shallow water. Detonations in deep water generate a train of waves where numbers of crests and troughs increase as the train propagates outward from center of disturbance. Properties of dispersive wave motion in the space–time field were derived for general conditions and certain practical applications.
