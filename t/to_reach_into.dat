5|$|On {{the return}} to Earth, a bearing at the Guam {{tracking}} station failed, potentially preventing communication on the last segment of the Earth return. A regular repair was not possible in the available time but the station director, Charles Force, had his ten-year-old son Greg use his small hands <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>into</b> the housing and pack it with grease. Greg later was thanked by Armstrong.|$|E
5|$|From a young age, Jackson {{was exposed}} to sex. He {{received}} mixed messages on the subject from his parents. His mother Katherine was a devout Jehovah's Witness and conveyed her thoughts clearly; lust in thought or deed was sinful outside of marriage, and physical intimacy should be saved for marriage. In contrast to his wife, father Joseph, a steel mill worker, shunned the religion and would have The Jackson 5 perform at strip clubs and seedy bars in {{the earliest days of}} their career. He allowed nine-year-old Michael to watch from the wings of the stage as male audience members whistled at women who stripped until nude. In one incident, a fascinated Michael watched as an apparently big breasted female removed all but her underwear. The stripper then proceeded <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>into</b> her bra, removing two large oranges and the wig from her head, to reveal that the person he thought was a female was not a woman at all.|$|E
5|$|Quolls {{are mostly}} carnivorous. The smaller quolls {{primarily}} eat insects, birds, frogs, lizards and fruit; the larger species eat birds, reptiles, and mammals, including echidnas and possums. The tiger quoll's diet {{is dominated by}} mammals such as brushtail possums, rabbits and hares. The exact mix is variable depending {{on the availability of}} prey after bushfires, and can include carrion or bandicoots when food is scarce. The other species of quoll have also been known to eat carrion. The paws and vibrissae of quolls allow them <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>into</b> small burrows to find prey. Quolls hunt by stalking. Depending on the size of its prey, a quoll may leap or pounce on it. Quolls pin small prey down with their front paws while devouring it, and jump onto larger prey, sinking in their claws and closing their jaws around the neck. Quolls can obtain all the water they need from their food, making them quite adaptable during droughts or other periods of water shortage.|$|E
50|$|Its {{remains were}} found in Riversleigh, Queensland, Australia. P. robertbolesi is only known from a tibiotarsus (ankle bone). However, this is of most {{peculiar}} construction, allowing the leg to be swivelled backwards and sideways. The bird was thus well adapted <b>to</b> <b>reaching</b> <b>into</b> holes and crevices and extracting prey. The vernacular name flexiraptor was coined to reflect this ability.|$|R

25|$|In {{its first}} few decades, the Reading Terminal Market was a success. There were 380 merchants {{in its first}} year of operations, and the market had nearly full {{occupancy}} for the following 60 years. Business, already good, flourished with the innovation of a free market basket service, which allowed suburban housewives to get grocery orders delivered to and held at their nearest train station. Refrigerated trucks allowed the market <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>into</b> some 60 suburban towns as well as seaside resorts along the New Jersey shore.|$|E
25|$|Following the crossing, German {{resistance}} decreased and it {{was necessary}} to form a fast moving armored unit <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>into</b> the German rear areas to disrupt communications and cut up administrative units and installations. Task Force Sundt was formed, composed of the 607th, less A and C companies, Co. A of the 735th Tank Battalion, the 87th Rcn. Troop, K Co. of the 346th IR, 2nd platoon Co. C of the 312th Eng. Bn and supporting fires from the 335th Field Artillery Battalion. The task force was divided into three companies plus a CP group. The unit assembled at Dachsenhausen, which was the limit of the divisions advance.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time Bedouin herding was {{restricted}} by land expropriation. The Black Goat Law of 1950 curbed grazing so as to prevent land erosion, prohibiting the grazing of goats outside recognized land holdings. Because few Bedouin territorial claims were recognized, most grazing was rendered illegal. Since both Ottoman and British land registration processes had failed <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>into</b> the Negev region before Israeli rule, and since most Bedouin preferred not to register their lands, few Bedouin possessed any documentation of their land claims. Those whose land claims were recognized found {{it almost impossible to}} keep their goats within the periphery of their newly limited range. Into the 1970s and 1980s, {{only a small portion of}} the Bedouin were able to continue to graze their goats, and instead of migrating with their goats in search of pasture, most Bedouin migrated in search of work.|$|E

25|$|Pinball scoring can be {{peculiar}} and varies {{greatly from}} machine to machine. During the 1930s and the 1940s, lights mounted behind the painted backglasses {{were used for}} scoring purposes, making the scoring somewhat arbitrary. (Frequently the lights represented scores {{in the hundreds of}} thousands.) Then later, during the 1950s and 1960s when the scoring mechanism was limited to mechanical wheels, high scores were frequently only in the hundreds or thousands. (Although, {{in an effort to keep}} with the traditional high scores attained with the painted backglass games, the first pinball machines to use mechanical wheels for scoring, such as Army Navy, allowed the score <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>into</b> the millions by adding a number of permanent zeros to the end of the score.) The average score changed again in the 1970s with the advent of electronic displays. Average scores soon began to commonly increase back into tens or hundreds of thousands. Since then, there has been a trend of scoring inflation, with modern machines often requiring scores of over a billion points to win a free game. At the peak of this trend, two machines, Johnny Mnemonic and Attack from Mars, have been played into the trillions. Another recent curiosity is the 1997 Bally game NBA Fastbreak which, true to its theme, awards points in terms of a real basketball score: Each successful shot can give from one to three points. Getting a hundred points by the end of a game is considered respectable, which makes it one of the lowest scoring pinball machines of all time. The inflated scores are the source of one of the Spanish-language names of pinball machines, máquina del millón ("million machine").|$|E

500|$|Thirty Seconds to Mars {{began working}} on the project in early 2007. They found {{difficulties}} in recruiting a production company for the shooting of [...] "A Beautiful Lie" [...] since most operators passed on the project, who considered it to be risky and dangerous. After six months, Yamani Watkins and Edy Enriquez attached to produce, while Elliott Lester was set to co-direct the short film. The crew spent a month in Ilulissat, Greenland, preparing pre-production; almost 200 different kinds of insurance were required to shoot the video. Determined to offset the impact of filming on the environment, Thirty Seconds to Mars worked with the Natural Resources Defense Council on strategies that minimized fuel consumption on the shoot, using renewable energy products. Jared Leto described the whole project as [...] "one of the most painstaking and difficult creative challenge we have ever undertaken as a band.
