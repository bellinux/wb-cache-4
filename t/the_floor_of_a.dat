5|$|The fire on {{the boat}} deck {{penetrated}} to a magazine. Evidence given to the second board indicated that the doors for the 4-inch ammunition supply trunks were closed throughout the action. It remains possible that a door or trunk could have been opened up by an enemy shell, admitting flames to the magazine. Alternative routes for admission of flame {{could have been the}} ventilation or venting arrangements of the magazines or, as Ted Briggs suggested, through <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> 15-inch gunhouse.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} opens with shots of Rihanna hooded, lying on <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> gas chamber. Three men, {{dressed in black}} uniforms and wearing dark round glasses {{circulate}} around the singer, attempting to extort information from her. The scene then moves to a dimly lit room in which Rihanna sits {{at a table with}} her love interest (played by American actor Jesse Williams) opposite. On the table between them lies a silver revolver in which, throughout the video, they take it turns holding to their heads. Other scenes include Rihanna in a woodland at night {{standing in the middle of}} a highway before a car speeds towards her, quickly cutting to another scene, giving the impression she is run over. Elements of blood and tears and vehicular assault dominate the video. In the final scenes, Rihanna is shown underwater, floating whilst being fired at; one bullet is visually seen cutting her throat. The video ends with her lover apparently committing suicide with the revolver placed between them.|$|E
5|$|The only secure {{depiction}} of the king dating to the Old Kingdom that has survived to this day is a rough, possibly unfinished, alabaster statuette showing Menkauhor enthroned and wearing the tight-fitting ceremonial robe of the Heb-sed. The statue was discovered in a cachette built during the late New Kingdom beneath <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> room {{to the west of}} the sacred lake at the temple of Ptah in Memphis. The Egyptologist Jocelyn Berlandini proposed that another statuette, usually attributed to Teti, belongs instead to Menkauhor Kaiu. Berlandini bases her hypothesis on stylistic grounds, noting the resemblance with Menkauhor's seated statue, as well as the location of the second statue, which was uncovered east of Teti's pyramid, in close proximity to Menkauhor's pyramid.|$|E

5|$|The {{role of the}} Vortigaunts is {{drastically}} {{changed in}} Half-Life 2. Now acting as allies to the player, Vortigaunts have been freed {{as a result of}} protagonist Gordon Freeman killing the Nihilanth at the end of Half-Life. Instead of acting with hostility towards humanity, the Vortigaunts are actively engaged in assisting the human resistance against the Combine, a multi-dimensional empire that has invaded and occupied Earth in between Half-Life and Half-Life 2. Vortigaunts are frequently seen at resistance compounds and stations, often performing maintenance work or providing help with experiments, and sometimes assist the player by using their energy abilities to recharge the player's HEV suit. However, a number of Vortigaunts are still in captivity, as at various points in the game, Vortigaunts are shown used as slave labor by the Combine; for example, one Vortigaunt is seen cleaning <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Combine train station with a broom, wearing a similar collar to those worn in Half-Life.|$|E

25|$|However, as yet the baldachino has {{not been}} constructed. In front of the altar in the {{sanctuary}} floor are two pieces of mosaic from the Holy Land, brought back after being uncovered during the First World War by the Australian Light Horse Regiment. One of these is part of <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> 6th-century synagogue at Jericho. The other is a fragment from <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> 6th-century Christian church at Gaza and {{is part of a}} larger mosaic now housed in the Australian War Memorial in Canberra. Beyond the high altar the cathedral ends in a semicircular apse and ambulatory (processional aisle), a link to the architecture's French-Norman past.|$|E

25|$|The {{mosaic of}} the cyclopses forging Jupiter’s thunderbolts from <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> frigidarium depicts three cyclopses: Brontes, Steropes and Pyracmon (Arges).

25|$|The cup fungus, for instance, can {{be found}} in the Caribou. As the {{sanitary}} agents of the forest that consume dead organic matter, fungi spread on <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> conifer area. Fungal spores blow in on the winds and take up residence at the foot of trees. One type, called the king bolete, is the edible mushroom most sought. Not all fungi have a symbiotic relationship with the trees, some fungi are parasitic, causing heartwood rot.|$|E
25|$|In 1976, Connolly's first play, An' Me wi' a Bad Leg, Tae {{opened in}} Irvine and toured in London.

25|$|Evidence, from {{artifacts}} and the often large mosaics of great villas, indicates that one favorite sport of the agrarian elite was the hunt. Depicted are well-dressed sportsmen (in embroidered riding tunics with striped sleeves). Mounted on horseback they go cross-country {{in pursuit of}} illustrated game—here perhaps a jackal. Various wild birds are also shown as desired prey, to be gotten with traps. On <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> patio, a greyhound appears to be chasing a hare {{across the surface of}} its mosaic.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{many other}} {{limestone}} exposures {{which are usually}} pale in colour, the exposures at Drumbally Hill are of a red-brown colour. This colouration signifies that the rock had been altered since it was originally deposited, most likely by groundwater. The limestone rock at Drumbally Hill was formed as a lime mud onn <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> shallow, tropical sea. Its proximity to a shoreline resulted in quartz sant grains and pebbles becoming embedded into the mud leaving a large amount than what is usual {{for the majority of}} limestone.|$|E
25|$|At first, little {{interest}} {{was shown in}} the parchment object itself. Madison had custody of it as Secretary of State (1801–1809) but having left Washington, he had lost track {{of it in the}} years leading to his death. A publisher had access to it in 1846 for a book on the Constitution. In 1883 historian J. Franklin Jameson found the parchment folded in a small tin box on <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> closet at the State, War and Navy Building. In 1894 the State Department sealed the Declaration and Constitution between two glass plates and kept them in a safe.|$|E
50|$|Another {{common type}} of wipe uses objects in the scene, rather than an {{invisible}} vertical line.

In this case, shot <b>A</b> would consist <b>of</b> the camera rising to the ceiling, and shot B would have the camera rising from the ground.

25|$|Some wine experts {{debate the}} {{importance}} of humidity for proper wine storage. In the Wine Spectator, writer Matt Kramer cites a French study which claimed that the relative humidity within a bottle is maintained at 100% regardless of the closure used or {{the orientation of the}} bottle. However, Alexis Lichine contends that low humidity can still be detrimental to premium wine quality due to the risk of the cork drying out. As a way of maintaining optimal humidity, Lichine recommends spreading half an inch of gravel on <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> wine cellar and periodically sprinkling it with some water.|$|E
25|$|Ledger stones {{take the}} form of an inscribed stone slab, usually laid into <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> church to commemorate or mark the place of the burial of an {{important}} deceased person. Ledger stones may also be found as slabs forming the tops of chest tombs. An inscription is usually incised into the stone within a ledger line running {{around the edge of the}} stone. Such inscription may continue within the central area of the stone, which may be decorated with relief-sculpted or incised coats of arms, or other appropriate decorative items such as skulls, hour-glasses, etc. Stones with inset brasses first appeared in the 13th century.|$|E
25|$|Roman hypocaust {{heating systems}} made {{extensive}} use of fired clay elements: The space beneath <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> room to be heated was supported on robust pillars (pilae), usually made of small, square bricks mortared together, so that {{the heat from the}} adjacent furnace could circulate freely. In public and private bath-houses (essential to the Roman way of life), heat was also carried up through the walls in flues made of interlocking box-tiles. Though these were covered up by wall facings both inside and out, they were sometimes manufactured with quite elaborate geometric and even figural decoration. Pipes for water and drainage were also often made of fired clay.|$|E
