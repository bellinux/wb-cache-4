5|$|P. fimbriata {{is found}} in the rain forests of India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Hong Kong, Taiwan, New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, Malaysia {{including}} Malacca, Indonesia, and in Australia's Northern Territory and Queensland. It lives on foliage, tree trunks, boulders, and rock walls. Throughout its range, this is the most common species of the genus Portia. Queensland specimens of P. fimbriata live near running water and where there is moderate light, while Northern Territory specimens live in caves where the light varies from rather dark at <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> much brighter around the mouths. Other populations of Portia also live with higher light levels than in Queensland, and some members of these other populations are found in webs exposed to direct sunlight for part of the day. In Queensland, P. fimbriata shares its environment with a common prey, the very abundant Jacksonoides queenslandicus, and with large populations of other non-Portia salticids and non-salticid web-building spiders.|$|E

5|$|After the storm, then-Philippine {{president}} Joseph Estrada declared six provinces as a {{state of}} calamity, which allocated ₱1million in emergency funds for each province. The president was unable to return home {{from a trip to}} Singapore due to the storm. The military was activated to help organize relief efforts, using rubber boats and trucks to reach the hardest hit areas as floodwaters decreased. They were aided by the Philippine Red Cross and other government agencies. Most evacuees returned home after the storm passed, excluding those whose houses sustained damage. Volunteers, the military, and public workers helped clean up from the damage. Just seven days after Zeb's damaging Philippine landfall, another typhoon—Babs—struck the same general region with a similar, but lesser intensity. After both storms, the Philippine National Electrification Administration provided ₱1.78million to the Batanes Electric Cooperative to restore damaged power lines. Power was gradually restored in northeastern Luzon, allowing communication of the damage extent. The nation's Department of Health distributed ₱547,469 worth of medicine to four provinces. The government airlifted about 3,000bags of supplies to Cagayan that included rice and canned goods. <b>The</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> back storm impacts caused an estimated 30% drop in coconut exports. Food prices rose dramatically, in some instances up to 400%, after both storms damaged crops. The storms also delayed shipments of sugar from neighboring countries, although prices were expected to fall once they arrived. By December 1998, consumer prices had risen by 11.2% over the previous year due to the typhoons' damage.|$|E

5|$|Robert Zemeckis, the director, {{originally}} wanted Fox to play Marty, but Gary David Goldberg {{the creator}} of Family Ties, which Fox was working on at the time, refused to allow Zemeckis even to approach Fox as he felt that as Meredith Baxter was on maternity leave at the time, Fox's character Alex Keaton was needed to carry the show in her absence. Eric Stoltz was cast and was already filming Back to the Future, but Zemeckis felt that Stoltz was not giving the right type of performance for the humor involved. Zemeckis quickly replaced Stoltz with Fox, whose schedule was now more open {{with the return of}} Meredith Baxter. He was considered for the role of Mark Kendall in Once Bitten, but it eventually went to Jim Carrey. During filming, Fox would rehearse for Family Ties from 10 a.m to 6 p.m, then rush to <b>the</b> <b>Back</b> <b>to</b> the Future set where he would rehearse and shoot until 2:30a.m. This schedule lasted for two full months. Back to the Future was both a commercial and critical success. The film spent 8 consecutive weekends as the number-one grossing movie at the US box office in 1985 and eventually earned a worldwide total of $381.11 million. Variety applauded the performances, stating that Fox and his co-star Christopher Lloyd imbued Marty and Doc Brown's friendship with a quality reminiscent of King Arthur and Merlin. The film was later followed by two similarly-successful sequels, Back to the Future Part II (1989) and Back to the Future Part III (1990).|$|E
