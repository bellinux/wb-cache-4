Newmark was the first researcher who showed {{that this type of}} loading may result in unexpected failure of structures, and its influence should be considered in design codes. There are different phenomena that may lead to the earthquake rotational loading of structures, such as propagation of body wave, surface wave, special rotational wave, block rotation, <b>topographic</b> <b>effect,</b> and soil structure interaction.|$|E

To distinguish it from the man-made dams that were common in the region, the uplifted area became known as the Allah Bund, or Dam of God. The mound produced had a markedly asymmetric geometry, with a shorter and steeper south-dipping margin, about 600 m wide and a dip of 0.65°, and a broader north-dipping margin over 5 km wide with a dip of only about 0.05°.|$|E

40|$|In remote sensed data, {{topographic}} corrections {{are very}} important to overcome the <b>topographic</b> <b>effects</b> such as shadow <b>effects.</b> These <b>topographic</b> <b>effects</b> occurs especially in case of rugged terrain because sun facing slope represents maximum reflectance values and opposite side slope represents minimum reflectance values. These <b>topographic</b> <b>effects</b> leads to an inaccurate classification into different land cover classes due to different topographic angles. Therefore, effective removal or minimization of <b>topographic</b> <b>effects</b> is necessary in satellite imagery data of rugged terrain to extract the maximum information.

40|$|It is {{difficult}} to interpret multispectral Landsat earth resources data in areas of rugged and mountainous terrain because of the <b>topographic</b> <b>effect</b> on the sensor response. The objectives {{of this study were}} to examine and quantify the <b>topographic</b> <b>effect</b> on the sensor response from a uniform sand surface, to assess a simple theoretical incidence model for modeling the radiance from the surface, and to simulate Landsat sensor response due to the <b>topographic</b> <b>effect.</b> A field experiment was designed to collect data from a large range of slope angles and aspects at a range of solar elevations, using a hand-held radiometer. Analysis of these data showed that the magnitude of the <b>topographic</b> <b>effect</b> varied {{as a function of the}} solar elevation, the azimuthal orientation of the slope, and the slope inclination. The field measured variations in spectral response were found to have generally strong correlations with the theoretical model, and it was shown that the applicability of the Lambertian assumption varied within and between data sets. It is concluded that if slope angle, aspect, and solar zenith angle and azimuth are known, a technique incorporating a model to reduce the <b>topographic</b> <b>effect</b> prior to multispectral classification may be developed...|$|E
40|$|The <b>topographic</b> <b>effect</b> is {{measured}} by the difference between the global radiance from inclined surfaces as a function of their orientation relative to the sensor position and light source. The short wave radiant energy incident on a surface is composed of direct sunlight, scattered skylight, and light reflected from surrounding terrain. The latter two components are commonly known as the diffuse component. The contribution of the diffuse light component to the <b>topographic</b> <b>effect</b> was examined and the significance of this diffuse component with respect to two direct radiance models was assessed. Diffuse and global spectral radiances were measured for a series of slopes and aspects of a uniform and surface in the red and photographic infrared parts of the spectrum, using a nadir pointing two channel handheld radiometer. The diffuse light was found to produce a <b>topographic</b> <b>effect</b> which varied from the <b>topographic</b> <b>effect</b> for direct light. The <b>topographic</b> <b>effect</b> caused by diffuse light was found to increase slightly with solar elevation and wavelength for the channels examined. The correlations between data derived from two simple direct radiance simulation models and the field data were not significantly affected when the diffuse component was removed from the radiances.

Our results show that for volcanic areas with an important relief, the perturbation of the thermo-viscoelastic solution (deformation and total gravity anomaly) due to topography can be quite significant.

Geological Survey (USGS) digital terrain data was undertaken to quantify {{and reduce the}} <b>topographic</b> <b>effect</b> on imagery of a forested mountain ridge test site in central Pennsylvania. High Sun angle imagery revealed variation {{of as much as}} 21 pixel values in data for slopes of different angles and aspects with uniform surface cover. Large topographic effects were apparent in MSS 4 and 5 was due to a combination of high absorption by the forest cover and the MSS quantization. Four methods for reducing the <b>topographic</b> <b>effect</b> were compared.

The Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) proposed by the MODIS Land Discipline Groupand the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) are both global-based vegetationindices aimed at providing consistent spatial and temporal information regarding globalvegetation.

At such coarse resolution, <b>topographic</b> <b>effects</b> on insolation cannot be considered accurately and the modelling results are difficult to use for land managers and ecologists. Here we mapped climate change impacts on permafrost from 1968 to 2100 at 10 m resolution using a process-based model for Ivvavik National Park, a region with complex terrain in northern Yukon, Canada. Soil and drainage conditions were defined based on ecosystem types, which were mapped using SPOT imagery, a digital elevation model and field observations.

Climate distribution was estimated based on elevation and station observations, {{and the effects of}} topography on insolation were estimated based on slope, aspect and viewshed. To reduce computation time, we clustered climate distribution and <b>topographic</b> <b>effects</b> on insolation into discrete types. The modelled active-layer thickness and permafrost distribution were comparable with field observations and other studies, demonstrating that it is practical to model and map climate change impacts on permafrost at high spatial resolution for areas with complex terrain.

The Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) proposed by the MODIS Land Discipline Group and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) are both global-based vegetation indices aimed at providing consistent spatial and temporal information regarding global vegetation. However, many environmental factors such as atmospheric conditions and soil background may produce errors in these indices. The <b>topographic</b> <b>effect</b> is another very important factor, especially when the indices are used in areas of rough terrain. In this paper, we theoretically analyzed differences in the <b>topographic</b> <b>effect</b> on the EVI and the NDVI based on a non-Lambertian model and two airborne-based images acquired from a mountainous area covered by high-density Japanese cypress plantation were used as a case study. The results indicate that the soil adjustment factor “L ” in the EVI makes it more sensitive to topographic conditions than is the NDVI.

Glacier motion, which is the main characteristic of glacier activity, has attracted much interest and has been widely studied, because an accurate ice motion field is crucial for both glacier activity analysis and ice avalanche prediction. Unfortunately, the serious topographic effects associated with the complex terrain in {{high mountain}} regions can result in errors in ice movement estimation. Thus, according to the different characteristics of the results of pixel tracking in the wavelet domain after random sample consensus (RANSAC) -based global deformation removal, a wavelet-based <b>topographic</b> <b>effect</b> compensation operation is presented in this paper. The proposed method is then used for ice motion estimation in the Muztagh Ata region, without the use of synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) imaging geometry parameters. The results show that the proposed method can effectively improve the accuracy of glacier motion estimation by reducing the mean and standard deviation values from 0. 32 m and 0. 4 m to 0. 16 m and 0. 23 m, respectively, in non-glacial regions, after precisely compensating the <b>topographic</b> <b>effect</b> with Advanced Land Observing Satellite–Phased Array-type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (ALOS–PALSAR) imagery.

40|$|The <b>topographic</b> <b>effect</b> of a meridional marine ridge on the spin-down of a {{cyclonic}} eddy, {{which is}} embedded in a zonal mean flow, is examined by use of a two layer numerical model. It is shown that the cyclonic eddy initially given on the eastern flank of the marine ridge decays in a short time. This result is common to all cases with the different volume transports of the mean flow (30 ~ 70 Sv) and of the cyclonic eddy (15 ~ 35 Sv). During the decay process, the cyclonic eddy shifts mainly northward into the shallower region, which {{is different from the}} dominant westward shift of the isolated cyclonic eddy. If the mean flow across over the marine ridge at the more northern latitude, the cyclonic eddy spins down more rapidly. A mean flow shifts zonal or south-eastward over a western side of the ridge, while it deflects north-eastward over an eastern side. The deflection angle of mean flow over the ridge depends on the intensity of lower layer velocity and density stratification. It is suggested that the <b>topographic</b> <b>effect</b> of the meridional marine ridge on the cyclonic eddy with mean flow is influenced both by the global phenomena that controls the inclination of the mean flow from zonal direction and by the local phenomena that controls the intensity of the <b>topographic</b> <b>effect</b> of the marine ridge. 1...|$|E
