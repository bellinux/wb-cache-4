5|$|Omaha had terrible streets {{through the}} late 1880s, which caused many {{residents}} to believe the city was not progressing appropriately. This lack of responsiveness by the city government was caused by property owners throughout the city {{who did not want}} to pay for improvements. On rainy days stagecoaches would sink up to their hubcaps, and residents wore knee-high boots to wade through <b>the</b> <b>mud,</b> <b>and</b> at times rivers ran through the streets.|$|E
5|$|The many {{inhabitants}} of the tidal flats include lugworms, polychaete worms, sand hoppers and other amphipod crustaceans, and gastropod molluscs. These molluscs feed on the algae growing {{on the surface of}} <b>the</b> <b>mud,</b> <b>and</b> include the tiny Hydrobia, an important food for waders because of its abundance at densities of more than 130,000m−2. Bivalve molluscs include the edible common cockle, although it is not harvested here.|$|E
5|$|Both {{ships were}} caught in the harbour during the Battle of Weihaiwei in early 1895, with Zhenyuan only {{partially}} seaworthy. They were unable to prevent the capture of the port's fortifications by the Japanese, and underwent nightly attacks by torpedo boats. Dingyuen was hit by a torpedo and began to sink. She was quickly beached, where she settled into <b>the</b> <b>mud,</b> <b>and</b> continued {{to be used as a}} defensive fort. Admiral Ruchang's flag was subsequently moved across to Zhenyuan. Following Ruchang's suicide, the surrender of the port and the fleet was arranged. Dingyuen was blown up by the Japanese forces, as they were unable to salvage her, although there is a suggestion following an eye witness account that she may have been mined by the Chinese.|$|E

5|$|In {{the planned}} {{offensive}} on the Sangro, C Squadron was {{to follow the}} 19th Armoured Regiment in its advance at 03:00. Although its tanks reached the river, they bogged down in <b>the</b> <b>mud</b> <b>and</b> the squadron remained on the other bank as B Squadron advanced to Monte Marconi. Three troops from C Squadron finally crossed the river by the afternoon of 29 November; one was ordered to advance to Elici and a second was {{to make contact with}} the 8th Indian Infantry Division at La Defenza. The routes were mined and the troops spent the night at 23rd Battalion headquarters. In the morning, the mines were cleared and the second troop contacted the Indians and advanced east of Elici; the first troop was held up by shelling south of Elici.|$|E
5|$|On 7 November, Vale conceded {{twice in}} one game {{for the first time}} in the season, as Peel Park saw their Accrington Stanley side achieve a 2–2 draw with the Vale. Vale lost a two-goal lead in the match, as Ian Brydon scored after the ball got stuck in <b>the</b> <b>mud</b> <b>and</b> then Les Cocker scored the {{equalising}} goal after Ray King failed to hold on to a shot. By this time Vale were building a significant point advantage over the rest of the league. On 28 November, Ken Griffiths scored a hat-trick as Vale 'tore apart' a poor Rochdale side 6–0, exceeding the record Vale Park win that had been set only two months earlier.|$|E
5|$|The {{first two}} attacks had been {{successful}} and as Allied commanders began {{to believe that}} a breakthrough was possible further attacks were made at Poelcappelle on 9 October and at Passchendaele on 12 October despite heavy rain that turned the ground into a muddy quagmire. Both attacks were ultimately doomed to failure, with heavy casualties, as the attacks foundered in <b>the</b> <b>mud</b> <b>and</b> as the battle petered out, it was decided {{that it was time for}} the Australians to be withdrawn from the line. This was completed by 14 November 1917. Over the course of the eight weeks they had been involved in the fighting around Ypres, they had suffered 38,000 casualties.|$|E

5|$|The name Sulis {{continued}} to be used after the Roman invasion, leading to the town's Roman name of Aquae Sulis ("the waters of Sulis"). The temple was constructed in 60–70 AD and the bathing complex was gradually built up over the next 300 years. During the Roman occupation of Britain, and possibly on the instructions of Emperor Claudius, engineers drove oak piles to provide a stable foundation into <b>the</b> <b>mud</b> <b>and</b> surrounded the spring with an irregular stone chamber lined with lead. In the 2nd century it was enclosed within a wooden barrel-vaulted building, and included the caldarium (hot bath), tepidarium (lukewarm bath), and frigidarium (cold bath). After the Roman withdrawal from Britain {{in the first decade}} of the 5th century, these fell into disrepair and were eventually lost due to silting up, and flooding. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle suggests the original Roman baths were destroyed in the 6th century.|$|E
5|$|Uplift {{from the}} Laramide paused {{briefly in the}} Eocene. Meandering streams flowed slowly over the {{resulting}} broad and almost featureless plains. Periodic but extensive floods inundated large areas perhaps once every 1,000 years; spreading mud, cobbles and fine silt over the plains. Erosion incised these deposits between flood events and plant growth was abundant. Oxidation of the iron in <b>the</b> <b>mud</b> <b>and</b> silt turned the soil into hematite, giving it a pink and red hue. These sediments were later lithified into the up-to- -thick Pink Member of the locally Eocene-aged Claron Formation (previously called the Wasatch Formation). Channelized conglomerates of this member can be easily seen in Red Canyon along State Route 12 while its silt and mudstones compose most of the park's fragile and colorful spires called hoodoos. Geologist Clarence Dutton called the iron oxide-rich lower member of the Claron the Pink Cliffs series due to its colorful appearance.|$|E
5|$|When Mulder and Scully search Karin's house, {{they come}} upon the corpsebelonging to Karin's fatherin the root cellar. They then find Lisa, frightened but unharmed, in the kitchen. Karin drives to Bobby's house and chases {{him into the}} orchard. Suddenly, Bobby is dragged {{downward}} into the mud. While attempting to rescue the teenager, Mulder simultaneously encourages Karin {{to break the cycle}} and to fight the voice inside her head. A tendon-like root snakes out of <b>the</b> <b>mud</b> <b>and</b> begins to drag Mulder downward. Ramirez appears, his axe in hand, and decapitates Karin, killing her. Mulder and Bobby are released by the unseen force.|$|E

5|$|Campervans, caravans and trailer tents are {{not allowed}} into the main festival site. However, the {{purchase}} of a campervan ticket in addition to the main ticket allows access to fields just outside the boundary fence; and the cost includes access for the campervan or towing vehicle and the caravan; the car, or other vehicle used to tow the caravan, may be parked alongside it but sleeping is only authorised in the campervan/caravan and connected awning, not in the accompanying vehicle. One additional tent may accompany the caravan/campervan if space within the plot allows. Some people choose to bring or hire a motorhome, though drivers of larger vehicles or motorhomes may have to purchase a second campervan ticket if they cannot fit within the defined plot. The 2009 festival saw changes to the campervan fields; commercial vehicles were no longer classed as 'campervans', all campervans had to have a fitted sleeping area and either washing or cooking facilities, and caravans and trailer tents were allowed back at the festival. Prior to this only campervans were allowed on site, caravans and trailers being banned in the early 1990s after a number were stuck in <b>the</b> <b>mud</b> <b>and</b> abandoned.|$|E
5|$|In {{mainland}} China, officials used {{helicopters to}} airdrop relief goods to Guangdong. By {{three days after}} the storm, workers distributed 2,000tents and 1,000beds. Once the floodwaters dropped, residents returned their homes to clean up <b>the</b> <b>mud</b> <b>and</b> damage. Farm officials in Guangdong used 50tons of disinfectant {{to prevent the spread of}} disease, while the provincial government allocated ¥240million (CNY, US$35million) for rebuilding. About 1,000soldiers worked to clean debris and animal carcasses from the reservoir providing drinking water to Maoming. The collapsed dam in Guangdong was later torn down due to being structurally deficient. Zijin Mining, the owner of the dam, had to sell a mine to pay for compensation and fines related to the incident, which ultimately totaled ¥245million (CNY, US$38.7million). After the storm, the Red Cross Society of China provided ¥1million (CNY, US$148,000) to localities affected hardest by the storm, as well as distributing mosquito nets, water purifiers, food, and clothing.|$|E
5|$|There {{were three}} {{trenches}} {{in a typical}} front line sector; the fire trench, the support trench and the reserve trench, all joined by communication trenches. The trenches varied in depth, but they were usually {{about four or five}} feet deep, or in areas with a high water table a wall of sandbags would be built to allow the defenders to stand upright, fire trenches were provided with a fire step, so the occupants could return fire during an attack (see diagram). Ideally, the bottom of the trench was lined with duckboards to prevent men from sinking into <b>the</b> <b>mud</b> <b>and</b> dugouts were cut into the walls, these gave shelter from the elements and shrapnel, although in the British Army dugouts were usually reserved for the officers and senior NCOs. The men were then expected to sleep wherever they could and in wet weather they lived under groundsheets or in tents {{at the bottom of the}} trench on the duckboards.|$|E

25|$|Pattens are {{protective}} overshoes {{that were}} worn in Europe from the Middle Ages {{until the early}} 20th century.
