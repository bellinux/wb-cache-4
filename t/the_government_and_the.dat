5|$|The {{downward}} spiral {{of the economy}} has been attributed mainly to mismanagement and corruption by <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> eviction of more than 4,000 white farmers in the controversial land confiscations of 2000.

5|$|As civil servant, Spruyt made {{an impact}} on the nascent state {{apparatus}} of the Orange Free State. He designed the coat of arms of the state, and laid the foundation of the model state the Orange Free State was to become in later years. Having worked in secretarial functions for the State President himself (as clerk), but also as a servant of parliament, <b>the</b> <b>government,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> State, Spruyt left a clear mark on the early administration and its organisation. Spruyt was also sensitive to good labour relations within the state apparatus, and propagated a rise in the officials' salaries. In this he did not succeed, however, and eventually the matter of the salaries instigated his own resignation. Spruyt felt that his salary was insufficient to live on with a family, and tendered his resignation.|$|E

5|$|Baruch Kimmerling and Joel S.

Moreover, they asserted that these groups reemerged later to constitute the Palestinian people. The revolt represented a moment of political unity in Palestine. However, the ultimate intention of the notables and rebel leaders was to force out the Egyptian army and reinstate Ottoman rule {{as a means of}} restoring the Ottoman-era standards that defined the relationship between <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> governed. These standards were made up of the religious laws, administrative codes and local norms and traditions that were disrupted by Egyptian reforms.|$|E
5|$|Conscientious objectors {{who refused}} noncombatant service during World War I were imprisoned in {{military}} facilities such as Fort Lewis (Washington), Alcatraz Island (California) and Fort Leavenworth (Kansas). The government assumed that COs could {{be converted into}} soldiers once they were exposed to life in their assigned military camps. Simultaneously the Justice Department was preparing to indict 181 Mennonite leaders for violating the espionage act because of a statement they adopted against performing military service. The draftees' refusal {{to put on a}} uniform or cooperate in any way caused difficulties for both <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> COs. The treatment received by nearly 2000 of these absolute COs included short rations, solitary confinement and physical abuse so severe as to cause the deaths of two Hutterite draftees.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{official}} government statement that allowed {{for freedom of}} the press, {{this was the first}} trial of whether or not Dubček was serious about reforms. Goldstucker suffered no repercussions, and Dubček instead began to build a sense of trust among the media, <b>the</b> <b>government,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> citizens. It was under Goldstücker that the journal's name was changed to Literární listy, and on 29 February 1968, the Writers’ Union published the first copy of the censor-free Literární listy. By August 1968, Literární listy had a circulation of 300,000, making it the most published periodical in Europe.|$|E

Because Iris was compact, {{the damage}} was largely confined to 72% of the houses in the Toledo district and 50% of the houses in the Stann Creek district. The hurricane damaged or destroyed 3,718homes nationwide, and wrecked more than 95% of the homes in 35villages in the poorest parts of the country. Iris left about 15,000people homeless, many receiving assistance from <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> local Red Cross chapter. High winds also damaged large swaths of forest and crops, mostly affecting the banana industry. Iris killed 24people in Belize, including 20 who died when a scuba diving boat capsized near Big Creek. The storm also killed eight people and damaged about 2,500homes in neighboring Guatemala, and later dropped heavy rainfall in southern Mexico, where two people died.|$|E
5|$|During the {{fighting}} in May 1940, the Pierlot government came into conflict with King Leopold III who had taken personal command of the Belgian Army. The first confrontation between <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> King occurred on 10 May, when the King, against {{the wishes of the}} government, left for his military headquarters without addressing the Chamber of Representatives like his father, Albert I, had done in 1914. Contact between the King and the government became sporadic while the government feared that the King was acting beyond his constitutional powers. Like his father, Leopold was subject to Article 64 of the constitution which specified that no act of the King was valid unless counter-signed by a government minister, yet also given supreme power in military matters under Article 68. The two clauses appeared to contradict each other and gave all the king's acts in military-political matters an unclear constitutional footing.|$|E
5|$|During this period, the {{government}} was involved in launching Gutt's monetary reform plan {{as well as the}} disarming of the resistance as part of the transition to stability. A major crisis emerged within {{the government}} over the refusal of the Front de l'Indépendance (FI-OF) and the Partisans Armés (PA), two large left-wing resistance groups, to disband and disarm. Pierlot, suspicious of the FI's motivatives, came into confrontation with the Communists. The three Communist ministers resigned from <b>the</b> <b>government,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> party began agitating against it. Amid fears of a Communist coup d'état, parliament voted through emergency powers allowing the Gendarmerie to forcibly disarm the resistance though sporadic strikes continued. The government also voted through important social security reforms.|$|E

5|$|For {{the first}} years of the war, a degree of tension existed between <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> army, which divided its {{allegiance}} between government and King. The Free Belgian forces, particular the infantry who had been training since 1940, held the government responsible for not being allowed to fight. In November 1942, 12 Belgian soldiers mutinied, complaining about their inactivity. By 1943, the army's royalist stance had been moderated, allowing the government to re-gain the support of the military.|$|E

5|$|Greatly {{concerned}} about the growing partisanship within <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> detrimental impact political parties could have on the fragile unity holding the nation together, Washington struggled throughout his eight-year presidency to hold rival factions together. He was, and remains, the only U.S. president never to be affiliated with a political party. In spite of his efforts, debates over Hamilton's economic policy, the French Revolution, and the Jay Treaty deepened ideological divisions. Those that supported Hamilton formed the Federalist Party, while his opponents coalesced around Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson and formed the Democratic-Republican Party. While criticized for furthering the partisanship he sought to avoid by identifying himself with Hamilton, Washington is nonetheless considered by scholars and political historians {{as one of the}} greatest presidents in American history, usually ranking in the top three with Abraham Lincoln and Franklin Delano Roosevelt.|$|E

Although Amnesty International in 2003 found considerable improvement in the human rights situation, attributed to a ceasefire and peace talks between <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> LTTE, by 2007 they reported an escalation in political killings, child recruitment, abductions, and armed clashes, which created a climate of fear in the north and east of the country.|$|E
5|$|In December 1997, Suharto for {{the first}} time did not attend an ASEAN presidents' summit, which was later {{revealed}} to be due to a minor stroke, creating speculation about his health and the immediate future of his presidency. In mid-December, as the crisis swept through Indonesia and an estimated $150 billion of capital was being withdrawn from the country, he appeared at a press conference to re-assert his authority and to urge people to trust <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> collapsing Rupiah. However, his attempts to re-instill confidence had little effect. Evidence suggested that his family and associates were being spared the toughest requirements of the IMF reform process, further undermining confidence in the economy and his leadership.|$|E
