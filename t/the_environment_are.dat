5|$|Ecology is {{the study}} of the {{distribution}} and abundance of living organisms, the interaction between them and their environment. An organism shares an environment that includes other organisms and biotic factors as well as local abiotic factors (non-living) such as climate and ecology. One reason that biological systems can be difficult to study is that so many different interactions with other organisms and <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> <b>are</b> possible, even on small scales. A microscopic bacterium responding to a local sugar gradient is responding to its environment as much as a lion searching for food in the African savanna. For any species, behaviors can be co-operative, competitive, parasitic, or symbiotic. Matters become more complex when two or more species interact in an ecosystem.|$|E
5|$|Producing {{plutonium}} in useful quantities for {{the first}} time was {{a major part of the}} Manhattan Project during World War II that developed the first atomic bombs. The Fat Man bombs used in the Trinity nuclear test in July 1945, and in the bombing of Nagasaki in August 1945, had plutonium cores. Human radiation experiments studying plutonium were conducted without informed consent, and several criticality accidents, some lethal, occurred after the war. Disposal of plutonium waste from nuclear power plants and dismantled nuclear weapons built during the Cold War is a nuclear-proliferation and environmental concern. Other sources of plutonium in <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> <b>are</b> fallout from numerous above-ground nuclear tests, now banned.|$|E

He stated that without <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> animals cannot survive and without animals there <b>is</b> no <b>environment.</b> <b>The</b> <b>environment</b> <b>is</b> what we perceive {{at any given}} moment. All animals are able to perceive. Humans perceive <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> directly. This <b>is</b> why {{we are unable to}} perceive things in <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> that <b>are</b> too small to see, such as an atom.|$|R

5|$|In 1994, Riverhillsoft {{released}} the first fully 3D survival horror game, Doctor Hauzer, for the 3DO. Both the player character and <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> <b>are</b> rendered entirely in polygons, while allowing the player to switch the view between three different perspectives: third-person, first-person, and overhead view. In {{a departure from}} most other survival horror games before and after it, Doctor Hauzer lacks any enemies; the main threat is instead the sentient house that the game takes place in, with the player having to survive the house's traps and solve puzzles. It also uses background music that heightens tension and changes depending on the situation, {{and the sound of}} the player character's echoing footsteps can change depending on the surface; these would later be used in Resident Evil. The game is today considered a formative step in the creation of the survival horror genre, improving on Alone in the Dark.|$|E
5|$|The Sands the Prince {{collects}} from {{enemies and}} <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> <b>are</b> tied to his magical abilities, themselves {{connected with the}} Dagger. The most basic power is Rewind, the ability for the Prince to rewind time by up to ten seconds if he makes a mistake in platforming or dies. In combat, the Prince can also slow time immediately around him, freeze time for a single enemy, and freeze time completely so the Prince can attack his enemies at great speed while {{they are unable to}} move. Each use of power uses up one Sand Tank, and when empty, all powers become inaccessible until more Sand is collected. More powerful abilities, such as freezing time, are powered by Power Tanks. Increasing their number unlocks new Sand-based powers. Starting out {{with a small amount of}} Sand available to him, its capacity can be increased by collecting Sand from enemies, along with Sand Clouds scattered around the palace. Large columns of Sand within the Palace grant visions of future areas and act as save points.|$|E

The speech was delivered to the Commonwealth Club in San Francisco, California on September 15, 2003.|$|E
25|$|Because {{petroleum}} is {{a naturally}} occurring substance, {{its presence in}} the environment need not {{be the result of}} human causes such as accidents and routine activities (seismic exploration, drilling, extraction, refining and combustion). Phenomena such as seeps and tar pits are examples of areas that petroleum affects without man's involvement. Regardless of source, petroleum's effects when released into <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> <b>are</b> similar.|$|E

25|$|Vertigo {{can also}} be {{classified}} into objective, subjective, and pseudovertigo. Objective vertigo describes when the person has the sensation that stationary objects in <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> <b>are</b> moving. Subjective vertigo refers to when the person feels {{as if they are}} moving. The third type is known as pseudovertigo, an intensive sensation of rotation inside the person's head. While this classification appears in textbooks, it {{has little to do with}} the pathophysiology or treatment of vertigo.|$|E

25|$|Alkylation {{occurs when}} a {{molecule}} replaces a hydrogen atom with an alkyl group that generally comes from an organic molecule. Alkyl groups that are found naturally occurring in <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> <b>are</b> organometallic compounds. Organometallic compounds generally contain a methyl, ethyl, or butyl derivative which is the alkyl group that replaces the hydrogen. Other organic compounds, such as methanol, can provide alkyl groups for alkylation. Methanol is found naturally in the environment in small concentrations, and {{has been linked to}} the release from biological decomposition of waste and even a byproduct of vegetation. The following reactions are alkylations of soluble compounds found in creosote preservatives with methanol.|$|E
25|$|In Brazil public {{policies}} regarding <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> <b>are</b> generally advanced, although their implementation and {{the enforcement of}} environmental laws have been far from ideal. Laws regarding forests, water, and wildlife have been in effect since the 1930s. Brazil achieved significant institutional advances in environmental policy design and implementation after the Stockholm Conference on the Environment in 1972. Specialized environmental agencies were organized {{at the federal level}} and in some states, and many national parks and reserves were established. By 1992 Brazil had established 34 national parks and fifty-six biological reserves. In 1981 the National Environment Policy was defined, and the National System for the Environment (Sistema Nacional do Meio Ambiente—Sisnama) was created, with the National Environmental Council (Conselho Nacional do Meio Ambiente—Conama) at its apex, municipal councils at its base, and state-level councils in between. In addition to government authorities, all of these councils include representatives of civil society.|$|E
25|$|Proponents of the RMA {{argue that}} it ensures the {{sustainable}} use of resources for the foreseeable needs of {{the present and future}} generation, and also recognises the importance of indigenous rights in the mitigation process. In this respect, the RMA is a pioneering act in the area of sustainable development. Other advantages cited are the umbrella function, which (at least in theory) allows all consent decisions about a project to be considered in one process, freeing applicants from the need to research and apply for all the various permits they would otherwise have to apply for their development. It is also noted that the RMA is 'effects-based'. In other words, instead of a proposal needing to be on a list of approved or permitted developments or activities, if the applicant can prove that the 'effects' of the development on <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> <b>are</b> unproblematic, then he or she is allowed to go ahead. In practice however, this proof is often elusive, especially with new or contested activities or developments.|$|E

25|$|Various {{factors can}} affect the overall {{function}} of the biomembrane and decrease its ability {{to function as a}} protective barrier and maintained the order of the inner components. The bilayer thickness, surface charge, intermolecular forces, amphiphilic molecules, changes in free energy, alternating or spontaneous curvatures, increase or decrease in temperature, solvents, and <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> <b>are</b> all examples of different conditions that cause changes in biomembranes. For example, the strength of the intermolecular forces within the biomembrane are fairly strong but when lipids are extracted from biomembranes for analytical purposes there is a decrease in the constraints by the intermolecular forces against the phospholipids which may cause the lipid to undergo polymorphism as well as a temporary rearrangement of other lipids or proteins in the biomembrane. The thickness of the biomembrane determines the permeability of the membrane and ethanol, which {{can be used as a}} solvent, is able to reduce the thickness of the biomembrane which is one way this amphiphilic molecule is able to permeate through the biomembrane. There can also be free energy changes that can increase or decrease during the phase transitions of the phospholipids during polymorphism or mesmorphism which can also affect the curvature of lipids. All lipids can experience some sort of positive or negative alternating or spontaneous curvature due to variations in sizes between the hydrophobic and the hydrophilic region. Temperature changes can also lead to changes in the biomembrane.|$|E
25|$|Many {{processes}} in a {{wastewater treatment plant}} are designed to mimic the natural treatment processes {{that occur in the}} environment, whether that environment is a natural water body or the ground. If not overloaded, bacteria in the environment will consume organic contaminants, although this will reduce the levels of oxygen in the water and may significantly change the overall ecology of the receiving water. Native bacterial populations feed on the organic contaminants, and the numbers of disease-causing microorganisms are reduced by natural environmental conditions such as predation or exposure to ultraviolet radiation. Consequently, in cases where the receiving environment provides a high level of dilution, a high degree of wastewater treatment may not be required. However, recent evidence has demonstrated that very low levels of specific contaminants in wastewater, including hormones (from animal husbandry and residue from human hormonal contraception methods) and synthetic materials such as phthalates that mimic hormones in their action, can have an unpredictable adverse impact on the natural biota and potentially on humans if the water is re-used for drinking water. In the US and EU, uncontrolled discharges of wastewater to <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> <b>are</b> not permitted under law, and strict water quality requirements are to be met, as clean drinking water is essential. (For requirements in the US, see Clean Water Act.) A significant threat in the coming decades will be the increasing uncontrolled discharges of wastewater within rapidly developing countries.|$|E
