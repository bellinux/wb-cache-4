Lyman Briggs and Homer LeRoy Shantz (1912) proposed the wilting coefficient, which is defined as the percentage water content of a soil when the plants growing in that soil are first reduced to a wilted condition from which they cannot recover in approximately saturated atmosphere without the addition of water to the soil (<b>Taiz</b> <b>and</b> <b>Zeiger,</b> 1991). See pedotransfer function for wilting coefficient by Briggs.|$|E

The {{concentration of}} ABA in a specific tissue is also determined by the process of biosynthesis, catabolism, compartmentation and transport (<b>Taiz</b> <b>and</b> <b>zeiger,</b> 2006). To date, the ABA biosynthesis and catabolism pathway has been completed by using different mutant of these pathways, genetic approaches and other feeding experiments.|$|E
30|$|According to <b>Taiz</b> <b>and</b> <b>Zeiger</b> ([2009]), {{the main}} {{entrance}} routes for CO 2 in the leaves during photosynthesis are the stomata and, after crossing this gap, CO 2 needs to diffuse through the mesophyll until it finds the chloroplasts. The authors explain that each point on this route imposes resistance to the diffusion of CO 2 in the leaves, and the main ones are: resistance of the borderline layer, stomatal resistance, resistance in intercellular spaces and resistance of the liquid phase.|$|E

40|$|In 1880, von Sachs first popularized {{the concept}} of {{chemical}} messengers that were synthesized by the plant and then translocated throughout it to control the growth and formation of plant organs. However, {{it was not until}} 1926 that Went isolated a growth-promoting chemical messenger from oat (Avena sativa L.) coleoptiles. This was the first naturally occurring plant growth regulator (PGR) to be isolated, and it later was named auxin by Kogl and Haagen-Smit in 1931 (<b>Taiz</b> <b>and</b> <b>Zeiger,</b> 1991).

30|$|Global {{climate change}} has {{increased}} the incidence and severity of extreme climate events such as droughts and high temperatures (IPCC 2015), which strongly affect plant physiology and growth. Numerous reports have emphasized that water stress negatively affects gas exchange, which often results in lower leaf photosynthesis, stomata conductance, and transpiration (Ogaya and Peñuelas 2003; Leuzinger et al. 2005; Guerfel et al. 2009; Li et al. 2016). Decreased leaf photosynthesis {{can be caused by}} either stomatal or non-stomatal limitations (<b>Taiz</b> <b>and</b> <b>Zeiger</b> 2002). Therefore, the measurement of gas exchange in plants could reflect the physiological response to environmental conditions and the relationship between gas exchange and environmental variables could provide a more detailed understanding of how environmental variables limit photosynthesis, growth performance, and biomass (Ishida et al. 1996).|$|E
30|$|Various {{strategies}} can help maintaining rice grain yield under drought prone conditions like, exploitation of diversified germplasm (Liu et al. 2015), effective management practices (Haefele et al. 2016) and by exploiting {{the association of}} rice with endophytes (Gill et al. 2016). Some progress has been obtained by genetically improving drought tolerance in rice (Serraj et al. 2011). The management of water during rice field preparation and throughout complete crop growth period can help to save water and make it available during drought episodes (Haefele et al. 2016). Moreover, seed priming, foliar application of growth regulators as well as osmoprotectants and the proper application of phosphorus (P), zinc (Zn) and silicon (Si) can mitigate drought effects under limited water environment (Hattori et al. 2005; Kaya et al. 2006; <b>Taiz</b> <b>and</b> <b>Zeiger</b> 2006; Ashraf and Foolad 2007; Tariq et al. 2017; Gill and Tuteja 2010). Finally, symbiotic association with endophytes can help maintain grain production under stress conditions. Hyphae of the mycorrhizal fungi are able to deeply explore the rhizosphere and transport water and minerals to plant roots and keep roots moist even when there is less water availability (Varma et al. 2013).|$|E

40|$|Auxin regulates {{a variety}} of {{physiological}} and developmental processes including cell elongation, cell division, cell differentiation, cell cycle, tropisms, and root and vascular development (<b>Taiz</b> <b>and</b> <b>Zeiger,</b> 2006). Although a number of auxin biosynthetic pathways have been identified their overlapping nature has prevented a clear elucidation of auxin biosynthesis. Independent groups reported Arabidopsis mutants with supernormal auxin phenotypes. These mutants exhibit hyperactivation of genes belonging to the YUCCA family encoding putative flavin monooxygenase enzymes that result in increased endogenous auxin levels. ^ We isolated and characterized fertile dominant Arabidopsis thaliana hyt 1 - 1 D and hyt 1 - 2 D (yucca 6 - 1 D, - 2 D) mutants that exhibit typical auxin overproduction phenotypic alterations such as epinastic cotyledons, increased apical dominance, and curled leaves. However, unlike other auxin overproduction mutants, yucca 6 plants do not display short or hairy root phenotypes and lack morphological changes under dark conditions. In addition, yucca 6 - 1 D and yucca 6 - 2 D have extremely tall (over one meter) infloresences with extreme apical dominance and twisted cauline leaves. Microarray analyses revealed that expression of several IAA-inducible genes including Aux/IAA, SAUR, and GH 3 are several-fold higher in yucca 6 mutants than in wild type. ^ Catalytic activity assays with recombinant YUCCA 6 indicate that YUCCA 6 {{is involved in a}} Trp-dependent auxin biosynthesis pathway. YUCCA 6 :GFP and YUCCA 6 :RFP fusion proteins indicate YUCCA 6 protein exhibits a non-plastidial subcellular localization in an unidentified intracellular compartment. Based on these data, we conclude that Arabidopsis thaliana YUCCA 6 {{as a member of the}} YUCCA family, functions in auxin biosynthesis. Furthermore, the unique phenotype of yucca 6 - 1 D, such as extremely delayed life span proposes possible unique roles of YUCCA 6 in plant growth and development. ^ Since YUCCA 6 plays important roles in auxin biosynthesis, dramatically delayed senescence phenotype of yuc 6 - 1 D could be from elevated auxin levels in yuc 6 - 1 D. Next, I analyzed delayed senescence phenotypes in yuc 6 - 1 D. Although the first report for the involvement of auxin in controlling senescence was over fifty years ago, the role of auxin in plant senescence is still not clear. Both Arabidopsis thaliana yuc 6 - 1 D and 35 S:YUC 6 mutants that overexpress YUCCA 6 contain elevated free IAA level compared to wild type plants and display dramatic delayed senescence phenotypes. Detached rosette leaves of YUCCA 6 overexpressers exhibit delayed dark-induced senescence as well as delayed hormone-induced senescence. The monooxygenase enzyme activity of YUCCA 6 is required for delaying senescence. Another hyper auxin mutant, Arabidosis thaliana yucca 1 -ox, also displays delayed dark-induced senescence as well as hormone-induced senescence. When excess free IAA from yuc 6 - 1 D was reduced, yuc 6 - 1 D leaves senesced normally implying that elevated free IAA retards leaf senescence in yuc 6 - 1 D. ^ Free IAA measurements and auxin response gene expression profiles revealed that auxin homeostasis is actively down-regulated during senescence. The expression of GH 3 family members involved in auxin amino acid conjugation was dramatically up-regulated during senescence, which suggests that plants tightly control auxin homeostasis during senescence possibly by conjugating free IAA. ^ ANAC 21 /NAC 1 and ANAC 92 /ATNAC 6 expression is reduced in yuc 6 - 1 D during dark induced senescence compared to WT. Expression of miR 164 in yuc 6 - 1 D is increased compared to WT whereas NAC 1 expression is decreased in yuc 6 - 1 D. Our findings indicate that plants tightly control auxin levels which play critical roles in senescence, at least in part, through deactivation of auxin by conjugation. ...|$|E
