The final premium {{is based on the}} insured's actual loss experience during the policy term, sometimes subject to a minimum and maximum premium, with the final premium determined by a formula. Under this plan, the current year's premium is based partially (or wholly) on the current year's losses, although the premium adjustments may take months or years beyond the current year's expiration date. The rating formula is guaranteed in <b>the</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>contract.</b> Formula: retrospective premium = converted loss + basic premium × tax multiplier.

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>Insurance</b> <b>Contracts</b> Act 1984 (Cth) since {{inception}} has effected major {{reform to}} the law in this field. One of Australia’s most frequently cited pieces of legislation, it has had a major impact upon the law and practice of <b>insurance.</b> Given <b>the</b> importance of <b>insurance</b> to domestic and commercial activity and its pivotal position as a mechanism to manage exposure to risk, {{it is not surprising}} that this legislation has been the subject of extensive analysis in the courts and in legal literature. Furthermore the Act has, arising out of a 2009 review, been significantly amended by <b>the</b> <b>Insurance</b> <b>Contracts</b> Amendment Act 2013 (Cth). The principal amendments introduced are: two-fold: <b>the</b> <b>Insurance</b> <b>Contracts</b> Act 1984 (Cth) has been amended so that a failure to comply with the duty of good faith is now a breach of the Act; and disclosure and misrepresentation provisions under <b>the</b> <b>Insurance</b> <b>Contracts</b> Act 1984 (Cth) are amended and clarified...|$|R
