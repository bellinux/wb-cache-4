500|$|Following {{the thirteenth}} season's release on DVD and Blu-ray, [...] "The Old Man and the Key" [...] {{received}} mixed to negative reviews from critics. Writing for Project:Blu, Nate Boss stated that Grampa [...] "just isn't all <b>that</b> <b>funny</b> when cornered, and that's {{what we get}} here," [...] and that [...] "the jokes are a bit too few and far between". Giving the episode a negative review, Ryan Keefer of DVD Talk wrote that it was [...] "borderline painful" [...] {{and one of the}} season's [...] "duds". Casey Broadwater of Blu-ray.com wrote that the episode [...] "moves at a geriatric pace", and R. L. Shaffer of IGN stated that it [...] "represent some of the worst of The Simpsons." [...] On the other hand, giving the episode a positive review, Ron Martin of 411Mania enjoyed the [...] "poke towards Branson, Missouri, a mecca for old people everywhere," [...] and Jennifer Malkowski of DVD Verdict gave the episode a B rating. Colin Jacobsson of DVD Movie Guide wrote that, even though Grampa is [...] "essentially a one-joke personality," [...] "those gags tend to be pretty fun." [...] He concluded his review by writing that the episode was [...] "a likable program." ...|$|E
500|$|Bell {{has been}} {{associated}} with the idea that [...] "nerdy is the new cool", and she explained, [...] "what was previously perceived as nerdy is now viewed as original. What I like about nerdiness, geekiness, is it doesn't really matter what you're into—it just means you're not a follower." [...] She has also said, [...] "I love nerds. Comic-Con junkies are the tastemakers of tomorrow. Isn't <b>that</b> <b>funny?</b> The tables have turned." [...] Vanessa Juarez of Entertainment Weekly commented that Bell's roles on Veronica Mars, Heroes and as a Star Wars fanatic in Fanboys have [...] "solidif her placement {{at the center of the}} geek universe", while Rodney Rothman stated, [...] "I guess she's cornered the market on losers." [...] Bell's work is often compared to Sarah Michelle Gellar's portrayal of the title character on the cult television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter stated that Bell was [...] "arguably the television successor [...] when it comes to fighting bad guys." [...] Bell is sometimes confused with Lauren Conrad from the show The Hills. [...] "Yeah, sometimes fans yell, 'Hey, Lauren' to me, but usually from a distance," [...] said Kristen.|$|E

500|$|The MPAA {{questioned}} elements including Smith's character {{drinking in}} front of a 7-year-old and the character flying under the influence of alcohol. Scenes that were removed to receive a PG-13 rating from the MPAA included a scene of statutory rape, two of three uses of the word [...] "fuck" [...] (the MPAA only permitted one use for the PG-13 rating), and intense shots of needles going into arms. The MPAA allowed scenes of Hancock shoving a prisoner's head up another's behind and of Hancock having explosive ejaculation during sexual intercourse, though Berg chose to save the latter scene for the DVD, explaining, [...] "It just wasn't <b>that</b> <b>funny.</b> Never was. You'd put it {{in front of}} an audience and there'd be two, maybe three people laughing. There was no way to do that and then regain even a modicum of emotional integrity." [...] The director kept the scene with the prisoners since a Las Vegas test screening was overwhelmingly successful: [...] "At the end of the day, I couldn't ignore an audience when they're laughing that hard." [...] With such elements, studio executives only became comfortable with Hancock when the marketing approach focused on action and humor. Berg noted, [...] "The ad campaign for this movie is much friendlier than the film." [...] The MPAA ultimately gave the film a PG-13 rating, citing [...] "some intense sequences of sci-fi action and violence and language".|$|E
2500|$|A {{recurring}} joke, {{which was}} first shown in [...] "Radio Bart", is that Groundskeeper Willie {{appears to have}} a pot belly, but whenever he takes off his shirt, he is very muscular.

2500|$|Critics also {{questioned}} {{his commitment to}} Canada, pointing out that Ignatieff had lived outside of Canada for more than 30 years and had referred to himself as an American many times. When asked about it by Peter Newman in a Maclean's interview published on April 6, 2006, Ignatieff said: [...] "Sometimes you want to increase your influence over your audience by appropriating their voice, {{but it was a}} mistake. Every single one of the students from 85 countries who took my courses at Harvard knew one thing about me: I was <b>that</b> <b>funny</b> Canadian." ...|$|E

2500|$|Wieringo {{explained}} the philosophy behind his drawing style thus: [...] "I {{just try to}} keep things fun. I like to do fun comics. It doesn't have to be realistic to be believable. In fact, I sometimes think <b>that</b> <b>funny</b> [...] might actually add something to certain books." [...] When he began illustrating the Rogue miniseries, he was intimidated by the dark tone of that book's story, but once he finished the first issue, the editors decided to light up the [...] "grim and gritty" [...] tone of the story.|$|E
2500|$|In 2009, Apatow {{served as}} {{producer}} for the biblical comedy film Year one, starring Jack Black and Michael Cera, {{and directed by}} Harold Ramis; the film was not well received. He also released his third directorial feature on July 31 that same year, titled Funny People. Apatow wrote the film, which starred Adam Sandler and Seth Rogen {{as a pair of}} standup comedians, one of whom has a terminal illness. Other co-stars included his wife Leslie Mann and Eric Bana, who was a comedic actor in Australia before appearing in American films. The film contained more dramatic elements than Apatow's previous directorial efforts. Although the film was not financially successful (grossing $54 million domestically), the critical reception was primarily positive, with David Denby of New Yorker Magazine including the film on his top ten films of 2009, calling Funny People [...] "a serious comedy about a funny man's brush with death" [...] and stating that the film [...] "is Apatow's richest, most complicated movie yet—a summing up of his feelings about comedy and its relation to the rest of existence." [...] The New York Times critic A.O. Scott stated in a piece reflecting on summer films of 2009 <b>that</b> <b>Funny</b> People was [...] "a movie about growing up, feeling sad, facing death—a long, serious film whose subject is the challenge of maturity. Which may be why, {{in the face of a}} softish opening weekend, various interpreters of box office data were quick to declare Funny People a flop. The summer is no time for grown-ups." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kemper {{gained some}} Internet fame in August 2007 {{for her part}} in [...] "Blowjob Girl", a humor video on the sketch comedy site Derrick Comedy. The video, which was {{circulated}} on the popular site CollegeHumor, was a two-minute close-up of Kemper offering to perform oral sex on her boyfriend, but startling him by promising to bite and smash his genitals, which she seems to believe is arousing. Kemper said of the video in an April 2010 interview with The A.V. Club: [...] "I really don't like that video, and I wish that I hadn't done it, even though I know that it's a joke. I hate that it got sort of big, because I don't think that it's <b>that</b> <b>funny</b> and I don't want {{that to be the}} epitome of my work. It's just one video in a sea of many, but it has made me conscious of not wanting to do a video like that again." [...] Kemper has also contributed an article to CollegeHumor entitled [...] "Regarding Our Decision Never to See Me Again." [...] She also had a minor role in the 2009 film Mystery Team. Kemper starred in the fake iPhone commercial on Late Night with Conan O'Brien in January 2007, six months before the first iPhone was released. Kemper appeared in the Sofia Coppola comedy-drama Somewhere in 2010. She appeared in Bridesmaids in 2011. On April 3, 2013, it was announced that Kemper would be voicing a character in an episode of the animated sitcom American Dad!.|$|E
