[...] It interested the eleven-year-old Bo Diddley: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> record I paid attention to was John Lee Hooker's 'Boogie Chillen,'... When I found John Lee Hooker on the radio, I said, 'If that guy can play, I know I can.' [...] I mean John Lee's got {{a hell of a}} style". [...] In an interview, Buddy Guy described learning to play [...] "Boogie Chillen'" [...] at age thirteen: [...] "that was the first thing I thought I learned how to play that I knew sounded right when someone would listen." [...] Guy later recorded a version with Junior Wells for their 1981 album Alone & Acoustic. [...] Albert Collins also recalled that it was the first song he learned to play.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Brian Lowry of Variety said: [...] "Despite a pedigree that includes Arrested Development creator Mitch Hurwitz {{and many of}} that program's stars, Sit Down seldom rises above sniggering double entendre." [...] Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club graded the episode B, saying: [...] "I'm staying optimistic that the characters {{are going to get}} fleshed out in upcoming episodes, because this is obviously going to be a character-based ensemble comedy." [...] Jonah Krakow of IGN was more positive about the episode, noting the [...] "familiar aspects" [...] of [...] Arrested Development, such as the [...] "deft wordplay, biting sarcasm and inappropriate humor". He concluded, saying: [...] "As long as the talented cast can continue to play to their strengths and the scripts can humorously tackle dicey subject matter, this should continue to be a very entertaining show." [...] Kona Gallagher [...] of TV Squad watched the episode twice, and said that it [...] "definitely grows on you." [...] She concluded, saying: [...] "In all, I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time you watch Sit Down, Shut Up, it's really easy to blow it off as another animated show that's trying too hard. However, it's actually worth sticking around and watching a couple of episodes." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} moderately positive {{reviews from}} critics. Travis Fickett from IGN retroactively gave the episode an 8.0 out of 10, signifying a [...] "great" [...] episode. Fickett wrote that [...] "Hot Girl" [...] helped to establish {{what type of}} character Michael would eventually become in the subsequent seasons, noting the character's [...] "deep and desperate loneliness" [...] which would eventually become a main conceit in the series. He concluded that the episode ended with a [...] "classic Office moment"—Michael realizing that Jim will be giving Katy a ride home—that [...] "captures the desperation and loneliness of [...] – and {{does a great job}} of setting the stage for the show's terrific second season." [...] Miss Alli from Television Without Pity gave the episode a B but described it as [...] "the weakest of the first season." [...] Alli noted that the episode was largely the [...] "play on the same joke," [...] featuring Michael and Dwight [...] "making idiots of themselves over Katy." [...] However, she did positively compare the American version of the show to the British version, stating, [...] "All things considered, I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> season is very underrated owing to unnecessary comparisons to the British version," [...] but concluded that the episode was [...] "its weak moment." ...|$|E

2500|$|Inscriptions and archaeological {{evidence}} shows that cowrie shells were regarded as important objects of value in the Shang Dynasty (c. 1766–1154 BC). In the Zhou period, they are frequently referred to as gifts or rewards from kings and nobles to their subjects. Later imitations in bone, stone or bronze were probably used as money in some instances.

2500|$|In March 2011, Representative Michele Bachmann told {{conservative}} {{radio host}} Jeff Katz on his program, [...] "I'll {{tell you one}} thing, if I was ever {{to run for president}} of the United States, I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> thing I would do in the first debate is offer my birth certificate, so we can get that off the table."

2500|$|The restiveness of {{the volcano}} also stimulated the tourism {{industry}} of the province. Up to 2,400 tourists per day arrived {{in the area in}} the two weeks after the volcano started erupting on December 14, filling local hotels, compared to a more modest average of 200 in the days prior. However it was reported that some tourists lured by local [...] "guides" [...] ignored government warnings not to venture into the [...] danger zone. [...] "It's a big problem.

Lady Bird speaks of [...] "freeing our nieghbor hoods of hoodlums and fear, will take the cooperation of all our citizens". Eartha didn't <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> lady was doing enough for the inner cities, and responded [...] " [...] the children of America are not rioting for no reason.

The media made Kitt into a villan, and the Johnson's had Kitt blacklisted from working and entertaining again for decades.|$|E
2500|$|Formed in 1998, 40 Below Summer {{had made}} a name for {{themselves}} by performing heavily across their native New Jersey and New York. In late 2000, the band's self-released CD Side Show Freaks found its way to No Name Management (known for acts such as Slipknot and Mudvayne). After partnering with No Name, numerous record label showcases on both coasts followed, with up to fifteen prominent labels showing interest in the band. They eventually signed with Warner Music Group's London-Sire. In March 2001, 40 Below Summer travelled to Los Angeles to commence recording their major label debut with famed heavy metal producer GGGarth (Rage Against the Machine, Mudvayne, Kittie). Lead guitarist Jordan Plingos recalled [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> thing that we clicked with Garth about was that he was relaxed. He wasn't like, 'let's go, guys, let's go!' He was more like, 'get comfortable, get settled in.' His whole thing is bringing out the best in you, so pressuring you to do something doesn't help. He was all about us, which was amazing", while vocalist Max Illidge said [...] "He’s a lot of fun. He’s crazy too. Definitely a crazy little fucker, but he’s a lot of fun and a very talented guy. He definitely helped unlock some doors inside of me." ...|$|E
