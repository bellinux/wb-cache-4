500|$|... 2001 {{contains}} a famous {{example of a}} match cut, a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>cut</b> in which two shots are matched by action or subject matter. After an ape uses a bone to kill another ape at the watering hole, he throws it triumphantly into the air; as the bone spins in the air, the film cuts to an orbiting satellite, marking {{the end of the}} prologue. The match cut draws a connection between the two objects as exemplars of primitive and advanced tools respectively, and demonstrates humanity's technological progress since the time of the apes.|$|E
2500|$|Adjustments {{are made}} to part of the hip-bone. Many {{operating}} methods and variations have been developed. [...] They are defined by the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>cut</b> and adjustment made. Some acetabular procedures are named after the surgeons who first described them as Salter (R. Salter), Dega (W. Dega), Sutherland (D.H. Sutherland), Chiari (K. Chiari): other names one may encounter are Ludlov, P. Pemberton, and James B. Steele. Some are named after the shape of cut (e.g. Chevron, Wedge) or the way the bones are aligned (Dial=old style rotary dial phone).|$|E
5000|$|Rip cut: In woodworking, a cut made {{parallel}} to {{the direction of the}} grain of the workpiece. A rip saw is used to make this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>cut.</b>|$|E

40|$|Allometric {{models for}} {{dominant}} shade tree species were developed for coffee agroforestry systems in Villa Rica, Peru. The studied shade tree species were Eucalyptus saligna, Pinus tecunumanii, Pinus radiata and Prumnopitys harmsiana. The models predict total aboveground biomass volume of tree trunk and biomass {{volume of the}} commercial utilizable tree trunk based on diameter at breast height, which was identified as the best predictor, R 2 > 0, 98. By non-destructive method of using Field-Map technology was measured 258 individuals. From these data have been calculated volumes <b>of</b> 4 <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>cut</b> outs destined for the local standards for determining the commercial utilizable tree trunk. Thus prepared data was interleaved with tested models. The best-fit model was logarithmic transformation of power-law. This model {{was used to determine}} total volume and two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>cut</b> outs for all studied species. In all cases was reached high R 2 between 0. 98 and 0. 99. For the other two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>cut</b> outs data the best-fit model was Gompertz...|$|R

5000|$|Crosscut: In woodworking, a cut made at (or close to) a {{right angle}} to the {{direction}} of the wood grain of the workpiece. A crosscut saw is used to make this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>cut.</b>|$|E
50|$|In woodworking, a rip-cut is {{to sever}} or divide {{a piece of}} wood {{parallel}} to the grain. The other typical <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>cut</b> is a cross-cut, a cut perpendicular to the grain. Unlike cross-cutting, which shears the wood fibers, a rip saw works more like a series of chisels, lifting off small splinters of wood. The nature of the wood grain requires the shape of the saw teeth to be different thus the need for both rip saws and crosscut saws; however some circular saw blades are combination blades and can make both types of cuts. A rip cut is the fundamental <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>cut</b> made at a sawmill.|$|E
50|$|In colored diamonds, cutting can {{influence}} the color grade of the diamond, thereby raising its value. Certain cut shapes are used to intensify {{the color of the}} diamond. The radiant cut is an example of this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>cut.</b>|$|E
40|$|Unitarity cutting {{rules for}} the {{multiplicity}} <b>of</b> <b>cut</b> Pomerons, or topological cross sections have been obtained {{within the framework of}} nonlinear k ⊥ factorisation.

40|$|The Bureau of Mines {{conducted}} {{a series of}} tests to compare the cutting forces required by radial and point-attack bits when making similar cuts. Three radial and four point-attack bits were tested in two coal mines using the Bureau's in-seam tester to measure coal-cutting forces in situ. Tests were also conducted to investigate the effects of weathering and cleating. The test results show that in each case, at a specific clearance angle, the radial bits required less tangential and much less normal force than the point-attack bits. The resultant of the cutting forces for some <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>cut</b> was 50 pct less at mine 1 for radial cuts compared to cuts with the best point-attack bit, and 40 pct less at mine 2. There was some difference between three <b>types</b> <b>of</b> radial bits, but it was not as significant as the difference between each <b>type</b> <b>of</b> point-attack bit. <b>Cutting</b> coal perpendicular to the cleat planes required less cutting and normal force than the same <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>cuts</b> parallel to the cleat planes. Test results showed no effect due to weathering on cutting force data. Cutting parallel increased forces only because cuts were made in the rock band...|$|R

50|$|Satsuma kiriko (薩摩切子) is a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>cut</b> {{glass from}} Japan. It was {{manufactured}} by the Satsuma clan {{from the final}} years of the Edo period {{to the beginning of the}} Meiji period (1868-1912). Today, faithful reproductions are produced.|$|E
50|$|Quarter sawing also quarter-cut is a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>cut</b> in the rip-sawing of logs into lumber. The {{resulting}} lumber {{is called}} quartersawn (quarter-sawn), quartered, and radially-sawn. There is widespread confusion between the terms quartersawn and riftsawn with both words defined with opposite meanings and as synonyms.|$|E
5000|$|The {{types of}} rip-cuts {{influence}} {{the quality of}} the lumber. Plain-sawn is the most common <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>cut</b> where a log is repeatedly run through a saw and much of the lumber has wood grain nearly parallel to the width of the boards. Quarter sawn and rift-sawn wood is more time consuming and wasteful to produce but is higher quality.|$|E
40|$|The ixora is {{ornamental}} plant {{widely used in}} landscaping. In order to maximize the propagation <b>of</b> <b>cuts,</b> we evaluated the concentrations of auxin (indolbutiric acid) {{and the presence of}} leaves on the rooting in <b>cuts</b> <b>of</b> Ixora coccinea L. The experiment was conducted in randomized block design, in factorial design 3 x 4, with three <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>cuts</b> (without leaf, with two or four leaves), four concentrations of indolbutiric acid (0, 1000, 2000 and 4000 mg L- 1), with four replications and 10 cuts in each experimental unit. After 53 days of implantation the experiment, evaluated the survival(%), rooting(%), sprouting(%), formation of callus(%), number, length and biomass of roots formed. The interaction <b>of</b> the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>cuts</b> with concentrations <b>of</b> auxin was not significant for any of the variables analyzed. The survival of cuttings was not influenced by the treatments. Cuts with two or four leaves presented rooting and length of roots above the cuttings without leaves. The application of auxin does not substitute the presence <b>of</b> leaf in <b>cuts</b> <b>of</b> ixora in vegetative propagation. The vegetative propagation by <b>cut</b> <b>of</b> ixora can be made without application of auxin, and the leaves must be maintained in the cuttings...|$|R

50|$|The last of {{the most}} common <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>cuts</b> is the V-cut. V-cutters look like {{guillotine}} cutters, but cut a wedge into the cigar cap rather than completely removing it, creating a clean-looking gash. Good V-cutters penetrate deeper into the filler than straight cutters, and some smokers prefer them for thicker gauge cigars. However, cheap V-cutters can result in sloppy cuts too deep into the cigar, which result in an uneven burn.|$|R
50|$|Due to {{the level}} of {{violence}} in the episode, the producers attempted to balance the audience's sensitivities with reality. Producers and Sanzel discussed the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>cut</b> on Megan's arm. They also discussed the amount of blood that was to be shown in both the scene where the team rescues Megan and the scene where David and Colby find the dead attorney. The amount of blood was added during post-production.|$|E
50|$|Cut {{resistance}} {{has many}} dimensions such as force, direction, sharpness of the blade, {{length of the}} cut and flexibility of object.

50|$|The Ward-Jackson House is a {{historic}} house at 122 North Louisiana Street in Hope, Arkansas. The 1-1/2 story wood frame house was built sometime in the 1890s, and is a particularly fine local example of Folk Victorian architecture. It has a busy exterior typical of Queen Anne styling, including different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>cut</b> shingles, and has a porch with turned-spindle balustrade, and an Eastlake-style frieze. The windows are long and narrow, giving the house a somewhat Gothic appearance.|$|R
50|$|In many cases, {{the main}} {{ingredients}} are lightly marinated {{with salt and}} turmeric (an anti-bacterial and antiseptic). Vegetables are to be cut in different ways for different preparations. Dicing, julienne, strips, scoops, slices, shreds are common and one <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>cut</b> vegetables cannot replace another style of cutting for a particular preparation. Any aberration is frowned upon. For example, in alu-kumror chhakka, the potatoes and gourds must be diced, not shredded; if they are shredded it is called ghonto and not chhakka.|$|E
50|$|The visual {{presentation}} of foods is often considered by chefs at many {{different stages of}} food preparation, from the manner of tying or sewing meats, to the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>cut</b> used in chopping and slicing meats or vegetables, to the style of mold used in a poured dish. The food itself may be decorated as in elaborately iced cakes, topped with ornamental sometimes sculptural consumables, drizzled with sauces, sprinkled with seeds, powders, or other toppings, {{or it may be}} accompanied by edible or inedible garnishes.|$|E

50|$|Arch or rounded bangs: A more rounded <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>cut,</b> {{in which}} the bangs form the shape on an arch, similar to a {{crescent}} moon shape pointing upward. The style is similar to full bangs but the bangs are longer as they approach {{the two sides of}} the forehead. Usually, it is achieved by twisting the hair on the fringe area using one's dominant hand and substituting it with the non-dominant hand to form a cross hair and underneath the fingers is the amount of hair that must be cut off. Usually, this style is thicker and looks heavier than straight-across bangs.|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} ICON workstations were {{housed in}} a large wedge-shaped steel case, with a full-sized keyboard mounted slightly left-of-center and a trackball mounted to the right. A rubber bumper-strip ran along the front edge, a precaution against a particular <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>cut</b> users sometimes got from the PET's sharp case. The EGA monitor was mounted {{on top of a}} tilt-and-swivel mount, a welcome improvement on the PET. It also included TI's TMS5220 speech chip, originally designed for the TI-99, and would speak the vaguely obscene word [...] "dhtick" [...] when starting up.

5000|$|In addition, {{there were}} a wide variety <b>of</b> <b>cuts</b> used on cadavers and {{occasionally}} convicted criminals, from tabi-gata (ankle cut) to O-kesa (diagonal cut from shoulder to opposite hip). The names <b>of</b> the <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>cuts</b> on cadavers show exactly where on the body the cut was made. Older swords can still be found today that have inscriptions on their nakago (tang) that say things such as, [...] "5 bodies with Ryu Guruma (hip cut)". Such an inscription, known as a tameshi-mei or saidan-mei (cutting signature) would add greatly to a sword's value, compensating the owner somewhat for the {{large sums of money}} typically charged for the test.|$|R
