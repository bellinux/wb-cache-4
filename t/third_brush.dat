5000|$|A metadyne is {{a direct}} current {{electrical}} machine with two pairs of brushes. It {{can be used as}} an amplifier or rotary transformer. It is similar to a <b>third</b> <b>brush</b> dynamo but has additional regulator or [...] "variator" [...] windings. It is also similar to an amplidyne except that the latter has a compensating winding which fully counteracts the effect of the flux produced by the load current. The technical description is [...] "a cross-field direct current machine designed to utilize armature reaction". A metadyne can convert a constant-voltage input into a constant-current, variable-voltage output.|$|E
2500|$|South of Verdun, the Third Army {{was renamed}} Army of Lorraine and was {{to watch for}} a German {{offensive}} from Metz, which left {{the remainder of the}} Third Army free to concentrate on the offensive into Belgium. The French armies invaded Belgium with nine infantry corps but ten German corps and six reserve brigades of the 4th and 5th armies lay between Metz and the north of Luxembourg. The German 4th Army under Albrecht, Duke of Württemberg and 5th Army of Crown Prince Wilhelm had moved slower than the 1st, 2nd and 3rd armies and the French offensive towards them was reported on 21 August. The French armies had few maps and were unaware {{of the size of the}} German force opposite, as the <b>Third</b> Army <b>brushed</b> aside small German detachments.

50|$|In Ken Burns' Baseball, Bell was {{described}} as being so fast that he once scored from first on a sacrifice bunt. In an exhibition game against white all-stars, Bell {{is said to have}} broken for second on a bunt and run with Paige at the plate. By the time the ball reached Paige, Bell was almost to second and rounded the bag, seeing the third baseman had broken towards home to field the bunt. The catcher, Roy Partee of the Boston Red Sox, ran to third to cover the bag and an anticipated return throw from first. To his surprise, Bell rounded <b>third</b> and <b>brushed</b> by him on the way home; pitcher Murry Dickson of the St. Louis Cardinals had not thought to cover home with the catcher moving up the line, and Bell scored standing up. Bell once circled the bases in 13.1 seconds on a soggy field in Chicago; he claimed that he had done it in as few as 12 seconds in dry conditions.|$|R

5000|$|... 16 JAN, 1st - 2.41m: Ukhov {{produced}} the best indoor {{performance in the}} world for 21 years when he cleared 2.41 at the Yuriy Lukasevich Memorial meeting in the Russian city of Chelyabinsk on Thursday January 16. This added one centimeter to his own national indoor record, achieved in Athens five years earlier, and also to the Russian absolute record held jointly by himself and Vyacheslav Voronin, who jumped 2.40m outdoors in London back in 2000. Ukhov jumped 2.15m, 2.23m, 2.32m and 2.36m with his first attempts before getting over 2.41m (7' 10-3/4") on his <b>third</b> attempt, just <b>brushing</b> the bar with his heels. He immediately asked the bar to be raised to an (absolute) world record height of 2.46m (8' 0-1/2"), but then decided to rest without attempting. Compatriots Andriy Silnov and Yevgeniy Korshunov were second and third respectively, both going over 2.29m.|$|R

On 22 August in the Third army area, the V Corps attacked dug-in German troops at Longwy at 5:00 a.m. in thick fog and heavy rain, with no artillery support. As the fog lifted, German artillery caught the French guns in the open and silenced them. A German counter-attack routed a French division and the corps was not rallied until the evening. To the north the IV Corps also advanced in fog and encountered German troops dug in near Virton and was forced back also with a division routed. On the southern Flank the VI Corps was pushed back a short distance. In the Fourth Army area the II Corps on the right flank managed to keep level with the Third Army to the south but was not able to advance further. The Colonial Corps on the left was defeated at Rossignol, 15 km south of Neufchâteau, and had 11,646 casualties but the 5th Colonial Brigade on the left easily reached Neufchâteau before being repulsed with many casualties. Further north XII Corps advanced steadily but the XVII Corps beyond was outflanked and the 33rd Division lost most of its artillery. On the northern flank the XI and IX corps were not seriously engaged.|$|R
50|$|Two weeks later, Pine Bluff's {{connections}} started {{him in the}} 1992 Preakness Stakes. The public {{made him}} the post time favorite at 7-2. Pine Bluff {{ended up with a}} new jockey, Chris McCarron. He broke slowly from gate four in very close quarters and settled in eighth in a full field of 14 horses passing the stands for the first time behind leader Big Sur. Around the clubhouse turn, he moved up to sixth as leader Speakerphone finished the first half mile in :46-1/5. Down the back stretch, he worked his way to the outside of the field five wide and started advancing on the first flight of horses. He continued his rally {{at the top of the}} home stretch, pulling up to <b>third.</b> He then <b>brushed</b> with Dance Floor inside the final furlong. Then he wore down the leader, Alydeed, and beat him at the wire by 3/4 of a length. Pine Bluff's win in the Preakness Stakes was the first of two straight Preakness wins for his trainer, Tom Bohannan, and owner Loblolly Stable and John Ed Anthony.|$|R
40|$|Evaluation of {{brushing}} {{to remove}} lunar simulant dust from thermal control surfaces is described. First, strip brushes made with nylon, PTFE, or Thunderon (Nihon Sanmo Dyeing Company Ltd.) bristles {{were used to}} remove JSC- 1 AF dust from AZ 93 thermal control paint or aluminized FEP (AlFEP) thermal control surface under ambient laboratory conditions. Nylon and PTFE bristles removed a promising amount of dust from AZ 93, and nylon and Thunderon bristles from AlFEP. But when these were tested under simulated lunar conditions in the lunar dust adhesion bell jar (LDAB), they were not effective. In a <b>third</b> effort, seven <b>brushes</b> made up of three different materials, two different geometries, and different bristle lengths and thicknesses were tested under laboratory conditions against AZ 93 and AlFEP. Two of these brushes, the Zephyr fiberglass fingerprint brush and the Escoda nylon fan brush, removed over 90 percent of the dust, and so were tested in the fourth effort in the LDAB. They also performed well under these conditions recovering 80 {{percent or more of}} the original thermal performance (solar absorptance/thermal emittance) of both AZ 93 and AgFEP after 20 strokes, and 90 or more percent after 200 stroke...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} to investigate the interaction of anionic cephalosporins (cefixime, ceftibuten, and cefdinir) with the renal peptide transporter (PEPT 2) and the intestinal peptide transporter (PEPT 1) using four different experimental model systems. In the first approach, the human colon carcinoma cell line Caco- 2 which expresses PEPT 1 and the SHR rat kidney cell line SKPT which expresses PEPT 2 were used. The uptake of the dipeptide Gly-Sar mediated by PEPT 1 or PEPT 2 in these cells was inhibited significantly by the anionic cephalosporins, with the following order of potency: ceftibuten>cefixime>cefdinir. The inhibition was competitive in nature. Even though the order of potency was the same for PEPT 1 and PEPT 2, PEPT 1 exhibited much lesser sensitivity to inhibition than PEPT 2. In the second approach, the cloned human PEPT 1 and PEPT 2 were functionally expressed in HeLa cells following which the cells were used to study the interaction of anionic cephalosporins with PEPT 1 and PEPT 2. Again, Gly-Sar uptake mediated by the human PEPT 1 and PEPT 2 in HeLa cells {{was found to be}} inhibited by the anionic cephalosporins with the same order potency as in Caco- 2 and SKPT cells. In the <b>third</b> approach, <b>brush</b> border membrane vesicles isolated from rat kidneys were employed. In this approach also it was found that PEPT 2 -mediated Gly-Sar uptake was inhibited by cefixime and ceftibuten. In the fourth approach, the human PEPT 1 was expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes and PEPT 1 -mediated transport of ceftibuten was investigated directly by electrophysiological methods. Ceftibuten evoked inward currents in PEPT 1 -expressing oocytes but not in water-injected oocytes, showing that the transport of the anionic cephalosporin via PEPT 1 is associated with transfer of positive charge. The ceftibuten-evoked currents were saturable with respect to ceftibuten concentration and were markedly dependent on membrane potential. It is concluded that anionic cephalosporins interact with the peptide transporters expressed in the intestine (PEPT 1) {{as well as in the}} kidney (PEPT 2) ...|$|R
