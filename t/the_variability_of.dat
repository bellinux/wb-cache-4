40|$|Accurate {{quantification}} of <b>the</b> contribution <b>of</b> environmental <b>variability</b> {{and functional}} changes to <b>the</b> interannual <b>variability</b> <b>of</b> net ecosystem production (NEP) and evapotranspiration (ET) in coniferous forests {{is needed to}} understand global carbon and water cycling. This study quantified these contributions to <b>the</b> interannual <b>variability</b> <b>of</b> NEP and ET for a subtropical coniferous plantation in southeastern China, {{and the effect of}} drought stress on these contributions was also investigated. NEP and ET were derived from eddy covariance measurements carried out over the period 2003 - 2012. A homogeneity-of-slopes model was adopted to quantify the contribution to <b>the</b> interannual <b>variability</b> <b>of</b> these fluxes. Environmental variability accounted for 71 % and 85. 7 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> interannual <b>variability</b> <b>of</b> NEP and ET, respectively; however, functional changes accounted for only 11. 3 % and 5. 9 %, respectively. Furthermore, functional changes explained more <b>of</b> <b>the</b> interannual <b>variability</b> <b>of</b> NEP in dry years (16. 3 %) than in wet years (3. 8 %), but there was no obvious change in the contribution of functional changes to <b>the</b> interannual <b>variability</b> <b>of</b> ET in dry (4. 7 %) or wet (5. 5 %) years. Thus, environmental variability rather than ecosystem functional changes dominated <b>the</b> interannual <b>variability</b> <b>of</b> both ET and NEP. However, different environmental variables controlled <b>the</b> interannual <b>variability</b> <b>of</b> NEP and ET.

5|$|Electric power {{generated}} from wind {{power can be}} highly variable at several different timescales: hourly, daily, or seasonally. Annual variation also exists, but is not as significant. Because instantaneous electrical generation and consumption must remain in balance to maintain grid stability, this variability can present substantial challenges to incorporating large amounts of wind power into a grid system. Intermittency and the non-dispatchable nature of wind energy production can raise costs for regulation, incremental operating reserve, and (at high penetration levels) could require {{an increase in the}} already existing energy demand management, load shedding, storage solutions or system interconnection with HVDC cables. <b>The</b> <b>variability</b> <b>of</b> wind is quite different from solar, wind may be producing power at night when other baseload plants are often overproducing.|$|E

5|$|Unlike fueled {{generating}} plants, {{the capacity}} factor {{is affected by}} several parameters, including <b>the</b> <b>variability</b> <b>of</b> the wind at the site {{and the size of}} the generator relative to the turbine's swept area. A small generator would be cheaper and achieve a higher capacity factor but would produce less electric power (and thus less profit) in high winds. Conversely, a large generator would cost more but generate little extra power and, depending on the type, may stall out at low wind speed. Thus an optimum capacity factor of around 40–50% would be aimed for.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, the Swiss {{scientist}} Albert Hofmann—known for {{the synthesis of}} the psychedelic drug LSD—chemically analyzed P.semilanceata fruit bodies collected in Switzerland and France by the botanist Roger Heim. Using the technique of paper chromatography, Hofmann confirmed the presence of 0.25% (by weight) psilocybin in dried samples. Their 1963 publication was the first report of psilocybin in a European mushroom species; previously, it had been known only in Psilocybe species native to Mexico, Asia and North America. This finding was confirmed in the late 1960s with specimens from Scotland and England, Czechoslovakia (1973), Germany (1977), Norway (1978), and Belgium and Finland (1984). In 1965, forensic characterization of psilocybin-containing mushrooms seized from college students in British Columbia identified P.semilanceata—the first recorded case of intentional recreational use of the mushroom in Canada. The presence of the psilocybin analog baeocystin was confirmed in 1977. Several studies published since then {{support the idea that}} <b>the</b> <b>variability</b> <b>of</b> psilocybin content in P.semilanceata is low, regardless of country of origin.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{characteristics}} of spring precipitation and water vapor transport in South China {{were analyzed by}} using observational data and the National Centers for En-vironmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis data. The re-sults show that, during the spring, each component of the water cycle (precipitation, wind field, specific humidity, water vapor transport, etc.) in South China exhibits a no-table interdecadal variability. An abrupt increase in spring precipitation occurred in the early 1970 s. During the dry period from 1958 to 1971, a water vapor flux divergence (positive divQ) existed in South China, which {{may have led to}} the deficiency in rainfall. However, during the wet period from 1973 to 1989, there was a remarkable water vapor flux convergence (negative divQ) in South China, which may have resulted in the higher rainfall. <b>The</b> inter-decadal <b>variability</b> <b>of</b> water vapor transport is closely re-lated to <b>the</b> interdecadal <b>variability</b> <b>of</b> wind fields, al-though <b>the</b> interdecadal <b>variability</b> <b>of</b> specific humidity also plays a role to some extent, and <b>the</b> interdecadal <b>variability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> zonal water vapor transport contributes much more to <b>the</b> interdecadal <b>variability</b> <b>of</b> spring pre-cipitation than the meridional water vapor transport...|$|R
