5|$|As {{the species}} has no fixed nest sites that {{individuals}} {{can use to}} locate their own partner or chick, emperor penguins must rely on vocal calls alone for identification.

Vocalizing emperor penguins use two frequency bands simultaneously. Chicks use a frequency-modulated whistle <b>to</b> <b>beg</b> <b>for</b> food and to contact parents.|$|E

After the Diet of Transylvania proclaimed Stephen Bocskai prince in February 1605, Rudolph tried to persuade Sigismund to return to Transylvania, {{but he did not}} accept the offer. The ambassadors of Venice and Spain and the emperor again tried to convince him to lay claim to Transylvania in July 1606, but Sigismund refused, saying that he had no information about the affairs of his former principality. In December he again met Rudolph in Prague, but still resisted the emperor's offer.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} history of the park, {{visitors}} were allowed, and sometimes even encouraged, to feed the bears. Visitors welcomed the chance to get their pictures taken with the bears, who had learned <b>to</b> <b>beg</b> <b>for</b> food. This led to numerous injuries to humans each year. In 1970, park officials changed their policy and started a vigorous program to educate the public on the dangers of close contact with bears, and to try to eliminate opportunities for bears to find food in campgrounds and trash collection areas. Although it has become more difficult to observe bears in recent years, the number of human injuries and deaths has taken a significant drop and visitors are in less danger. The eighth recorded bear-related death in the park's history occurred in August 2015.|$|E
5|$|The {{dispute between}} Norreis and his monks {{dragged on for}} years. The interdict of 1207–1213 caused further delays, {{but when it was}} lifted in 1213 the case against Norreis was finally heard. A papal legate visited the abbey and found that the monks were lacking in food, clothes, and other necessities. The liturgy was not being {{performed}} according to the monastic rule because the monks lacked the proper clothing. Charity to the poor had ceased, the monastic buildings were dilapidated, and the monks were forced <b>to</b> <b>beg</b> <b>for</b> their needs. The legate found that the abbot was living well, wearing non-monastic clothes, and enjoying the company of young women in his dwelling, while his monks suffered.

25|$|The war, however, {{led to a}} {{new sense}} of Honduran {{nationalism}} and national pride. Tens of thousands of Honduran workers and peasants had gone to the government <b>to</b> <b>beg</b> <b>for</b> arms to defend their nation. Local defense committees had sprung up, with thousands of ordinary citizens, often armed only with machetes, taking over local security duties. This response to the fighting made a strong impression on a sector of the officer corps and contributed to an increased concern over national development and social welfare among the armed forces.|$|E
25|$|When disturbed, its alarm note is a harsh jay-like k(w)eee, greee or jaaa, often {{repeated}} twice.
