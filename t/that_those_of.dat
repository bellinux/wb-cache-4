5|$|FXX premiered The Simpsons {{on their}} network on August 21, 2014 by {{starting}} a twelve-day marathon which featured the first 552 episodes (every single episode {{that had already}} been released at the time) aired chronologically, including The Simpsons Movie, which FX Networks had already owned the rights to air. It was the longest continuous marathon in the history of television (until VH1 Classic aired a 433-hour, nineteen-day, marathon of Saturday Night Live in 2015; celebrating that program's 40th anniversary). The first day of the marathon was the highest rated broadcast day {{in the history of the}} network so far, the ratings more than tripled <b>that</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> regular prime time programming for FXX. Ratings during the first six nights of the marathon grew night after night, with the network ranking within the top 5 networks in basic cable each night.|$|E
5|$|The Generalplan Ost ("General Plan for the East") {{called for}} deporting the {{population}} of occupied Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union to Siberia, for use as slave labour or to be murdered. To determine who should be killed, Himmler created the Volksliste, a system of classification of people deemed to be of German blood. He ordered <b>that</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> Germanic descent who refused to be classified as ethnic Germans should be deported to concentration camps, have their children taken away or be assigned to forced labour. The plan also included the kidnapping of children deemed to have Aryan-Nordic traits, who were presumed to be of German descent. The goal was to implement Generalplan Ost after the conquest of the Soviet Union, but when the invasion failed Hitler had to consider other options. One suggestion was a mass forced deportation of Jews to Poland, Palestine or Madagascar.|$|E
5|$|The nation {{initially}} did {{not know}} what to make of Coolidge, who had maintained a low profile in the Harding administration; many had even expected him to be replaced on the ballot in 1924. Coolidge believed <b>that</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> Harding's men under suspicion were entitled to every presumption of innocence, taking a methodical approach to the scandals, principally the Teapot Dome scandal, while others clamored for rapid punishment of those they presumed guilty. Coolidge thought the Senate investigations of the scandals would suffice; this was affirmed by the resulting resignations of those involved. He personally intervened in demanding the resignation of Attorney General Harry M. Daugherty after he refused to cooperate with the congressional probe. He then set about to confirm that no loose ends remained in the administration, arranging for a full briefing on the wrongdoing. Harry A. Slattery reviewed the facts with him, Harlan F. Stone analyzed the legal aspects for him and Senator William E. Borah assessed and presented the political factors.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to investigate the effect of the learning models on learning achievement viewed from the personality type of the students. The learning models compared were the cooperative learning model of the TPS, LC 5 E, and the classical learning model with scientific approach. The type of the research was a quasi-experimental research. The instruments used were mathematics achievement test on the topic of function and questionnaire of personality type. The data was analyzed by using two way analysis of variance with unbalanced cells. The conclusions of the research were as follows. (1) The mathematic learning achievement of students treated with TPS learning model was as good as <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> treated with LC 5 E model, and <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> treated with TPS learning model was as good as <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> treated with classical learning model with scientific approach, and <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> treated with LC 5 E model was better than <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> treated with classical learning model with scientific approach; (2) The mathematic learning achievement of students with sanguine personality was better than <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> with melancholic one but was as good as <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> with choleric and phlegmatic personalities, <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> with choleric personality was better than <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> with melancholic one, and <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> with melancholic personality was as good as <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> with phlegmatic, and <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> with choleric personality was as good as <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> with phlegmatic one; (3) In each type of student personality, it could be found that the students treated with Think-Pair-Share had equally good learning achievement to those treated with LC 5 E model, the students treated with TPS had equally good learning achievement to those treated with classical learning model with scientific approach, those treated with LC 5 E model had better learning achievement than those treated with classical learning model with scientific approach; and (4) In each type of learning models, it could be found that the learning achievement of students with sanguine personality was better than <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> with melancholic one but was as good as <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> with choleric and phlegmatic personalities, <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> with choleric personality was better than <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> with melancholic one, and <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> with melancholic personality was as good as <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> with phlegmatic, and <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> with choleric personality was as good as <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> with phlegmatic one...|$|R

25|$|The {{permanent}} council {{established at the}} instance of the Russian government (1773–1788) served as the highest administrative tribunal, and occupied itself with the elaboration of {{a plan that would}} make practicable the reorganization of Poland on a more rational basis. The progressive elements in Polish society recognized the urgency of popular education as the very first step toward reform. The famous Komisja Edukacji Narodowej ("Commission of National Education"), the first ministry of education in the world, was established in 1773 and founded numerous new schools and remodeled the old ones. One {{of the members of the}} commission, kanclerz Andrzej Zamoyski, along with others, demanded that the inviolability of their persons and property should be guaranteed and that religious toleration should be to a certain extent granted them; but he insisted that Jews living in the cities should be separated from the Christians, <b>that</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> them having no definite occupation should be banished from the kingdom, and that even those engaged in agriculture should not be allowed to possess land. On the other hand, some szlachta and intellectuals proposed a national system of government, of the civil and political equality of the Jews. This was the only example in modern Europe before the French Revolution of tolerance and broadmindedness in dealing with the Jewish question. But all these reforms were too late: a Russian army soon invaded Poland, and soon after a Prussian one followed.|$|E

500|$|Weber {{defines the}} {{importance}} of societal class within religion by examining {{the difference between the}} two theodicies and to what class structures they apply.

Those without the work ethic clung to the theodicy of misfortune, believing wealth and happiness were granted in the afterlife. Another example of how this belief of religious theodicy influences class, is <b>that</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> lower status, the poor, cling to deep religiousness and faith as a way to comfort themselves and provide hope for a more prosperous future, while those of higher status cling to the sacraments or actions that prove their right of possessing greater wealth.|$|E

500|$|One {{consequence}} of the Cornwallis Code was that it, in effect, institutionalised racism in the legal system. [...] Cornwallis, in a manner not uncommon at the time, believed that well-bred gentlemen of European extraction were superior to others, including those that were the product of mixed relationships in India. [...] Of the latter, he wrote [...] "as on account of their colour & extraction they are considered {{in this country as}} inferior to Europeans, I am of opinion <b>that</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> them who possess the best abilities could not command that authority and respect which is necessary in the due discharge of the duty of an officer." [...] In 1791 he issued an order that [...] "No person, the son of a Native Indian, shall henceforward be appointed by this Court to Employment in the Civil, Military, or Marine Service of the Company." [...] Cornwallis's biographers, the Wickwires, also observe that this institutionalisation of the British as an elite class simply added another layer on top of the complex status hierarchy of caste and religion that existed in India at the time. Cornwallis could not have formalised these policies without the (tacit or explicit) agreement of the company's directors and employees.|$|E
500|$|As in {{most species}} of the genus, the bodies of female Portia labiatas are 7 to 10millimetres long and their carapaces are 2.8 to 3.8millimetres long. Males' bodies are 5 to 7.5millimetres long, [...] with carapaces 2.4 to 3.3millimetres long. The carapaces of females are orange-brown, {{slightly}} lighter around the eyes, where there are sooty streaks and sometimes a violet to green sheen in certain lights. There is a broad white moustache {{along the bottom of}} the carapace, and running back from each main eye is a ridge that looks like a horn. Females' chelicerae are dark orange-brown and decorated with sparse white hairs, which form bands near the carapaces. The abdomens of females are mottled brown and black, and bear hairs of gold, white and black, and there are tufts consisting of brown hairs tipped with white. The carapaces of males are orange-brown, slightly lighter around the eyes, and have brown-black hairs lying on the surface but with a white wedge-shape stripe from the highest point down to the back, and white bands just above the legs. Males' chelicerae are also orange-brown with brown-black markings. The abdomens of males are brown with lighter markings and with brown-black hairs lying on the surface, and a short band of white hairs. The legs of both sexes are dark brown, with light markings in the femora (the sections of the legs nearest the body). All {{species of the}} genus Portia have elastic abdomens, so <b>that</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> both sexes can become almost spherical when well fed, and females' can stretch as much when producing eggs.|$|E

Males have white tufts on their thoraxes and broad white band above the bases of the legs, and these {{features}} are less conspicuous in females. Both sexes have tufts of orange to dark orange above the eyes, which are fringed with pale orange hairs. Females' chelicerae are pale yellow with black markings at the ends, while males' orange-brown with darker markings, and those of both sexes have pale orange and white hairs. The abdomens of females are pale yellow with black markings and the upper sides have scattered white and orange-brown hairs. Males' abdomens yellow-orange to orange-brown with blackish mottling, and on the upper sides are black and light orange hairs, and nine white tufts. Those of females' are pale yellow and have black markings with scattered white and orange-brown hairs on the upper side, but no tufts. The legs of both sexes are unusually long and slender, and those of male's are orange-brown with darker markings while those of females are light yellow with blackish markings. In both sexes the final two segment of each leg has no other decorations, but the other segments in both sexes have brownish hairs and many robust spines, and those of males also [...] scattered white tufts.
