5|$|Madeleine's {{mother had}} {{intended}} {{to check on the}} children at 21:30, but Matthew Oldfield, one of the Tapas Seven, offered to do it when he checked on his own children in the apartment next door to 5A. He noticed that the McCanns' children's bedroom door was wide open, but after hearing no noise, he left 5A without looking far enough into the bedroom to see whether Madeleine was there. He could not recall whether <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> <b>window</b> and its exterior shutter were open at this point. Early on in the investigation, the Polícia Judiciária accused Oldfield of involvement because he had volunteered to do the check, suggesting to him that he had handed Madeleine to someone through <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> <b>window.</b>|$|E
5|$|Benjamin finds {{and brings}} his cousin Peter Rabbit into the rescue venture, {{and the two}} {{discover}} Tommy has invaded one of Mr. Tod's homes. Mr. Tod, a fox, has multiple homes but keeps moving. Often Tommy lodges in his homes. Peeping through <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> <b>window,</b> the rabbits see Tommy asleep in Mr. Tod's bed, and, peeping through the kitchen window, they see the table set for a meal. They realise the bunnies are alive, but shut in the oven. They try to dig a tunnel into the house but hide when Mr. Tod suddenly arrives in a very bad temper, which has caused him to move house.|$|E
5|$|Young {{was born}} in Fallowfield, Manchester, where {{he lived with his}} parents and older brother Chris. His house was half a mile from Manchester City's Maine Road ground, which was visible from <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> <b>window.</b> As a schoolboy he played for Manchester Boys, facing opponents who were two years older. After {{catching}} the eye of scout Harry Godwin, Young signed for Manchester City as an apprentice in 1959, turning down the opportunity to join Manchester United. Around this time he was capped by England at youth level. He turned professional in July 1960, and made his first team debut in November 1961, in a 2–1 defeat against Aston Villa at Villa Park. After breaking into the team for the first time, Young played every match in the remainder of the 1961–62 season. He scored his first goal for the club on 23 December 1961, in a 3–0 home win against Ipswich Town. He finished his first season with 11 goals in 26 appearances.|$|E
5|$|A similar {{situation}} arose outside the apartment. A crowd {{gathered by the}} front door of 5A, including next to <b>the</b> children's <b>bedroom</b> window—through which an abductor may have entered or left—trampling on evidence. An officer dusted <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> <b>window's</b> exterior shutter for fingerprints without wearing gloves or other protective clothing.|$|R
60|$|She returned, and Thomasin soon appeared. When she {{was seated}} in the gig with her husband, and the horse was turning to go off, Wildeve lifted his eyes to <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> <b>windows.</b> Looking from one of them he could discern a pale, tragic face {{watching}} him drive away. It was Eustacia's.|$|R
60|$|It was half-past eleven by {{the clock}} in the passage as they went upstairs to <b>the</b> <b>bedroom,</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> of which looked on to the wood {{at the back of}} the house.|$|R

25|$|The {{northwest}} side {{can be broken}} down into three sections, each corresponding to the interior room it encloses. All the sections are plank construction with slab exterior. Each of the three sections contains a window. The first window looks into the bedroom and a double hung two-over-two sash measuring ten inches high by eight inches wide. The second window looks into the bathroom, and is identical to <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> <b>window.</b> The third window, looking into the kitchen, is a two-over-two casement measuring ten inches high by fourteen inches wide.|$|E
25|$|Eva {{approaches}} Sachs, {{and they}} discuss tomorrow's song contest. Eva is unenthusiastic about Beckmesser, {{who appears to}} be the only eligible contestant. She hints that she would not mind if Sachs, a widower, were to win the contest. Though touched, Sachs protests that he would be too old a husband for her. Upon further prompting, Sachs describes Walther's failure at the guild meeting. This causes Eva to storm off angrily, confirming Sachs's suspicion that she has fallen in love with Walther. Eva is intercepted by Magdalena, who informs her that Beckmesser is coming to serenade her. Eva, determined to search for Walther, tells Magdalena to pose as her (Eva) at <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> <b>window.</b>|$|E
50|$|In several {{episodes of}} I Love Lucy, the Hotel St. Moritz {{can be seen}} out of <b>the</b> Ricardos' <b>bedroom</b> <b>window.</b>|$|R
60|$|Something {{struck me}} as unusual about the place, but I could not tell at first what it was. One of <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> <b>windows</b> was open, and the {{customary}} short blind, with its brass upper rail partly unfastened, drooped obliquely across the vacant space. It looked negligent and odd, for usually everything about the cottage was conspicuously trim.|$|R
60|$|The {{thoroughfare}} {{leading to}} this spot was now blocked by two four-horse waggons and horses, one laden with hay-trusses, the leaders having already passed each other, and become entangled head to tail. The {{passage of the}} vehicles might have been practicable if empty; but built up with hay to <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> <b>windows</b> as one was, it was impossible.|$|R
25|$|Charles rescued {{his mother}} by pushing {{her out of}} an upstairs window. He could not help his brothers, Paul and Peter, {{who were in the}} same bedroom as he; opening <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> <b>window</b> had caused a draught which fed the fire. All three were trapped and burned severely, and were taken to the {{specialist}} burns unit in Pinderfields Hospital in Wakefield, West Yorkshire. Charles died overnight; Peter died two days later and Paul survived for 12 days before also succumbing. Thomas, who had muscular dystrophy, survived, escaping through a window in the back bedroom, where the flames were less severe. Mrs Hastie had three daughters, who were staying with relatives elsewhere in the area that particular night. Her husband, Tommy Hastie, was in prison.|$|E
500|$|Kate {{made her}} own check of 5A at around 22:00. Scotland Yard said in 2013 that Madeleine was {{probably}} taken moments before this. Kate recalled entering the apartment through the unlocked patio {{doors at the}} back, and noticing that the children's bedroom door was wide open. When she tried to close the door, it slammed shut as {{though there was a}} draught, which is when she saw that <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> <b>window</b> and its shutter were open. Madeleine's Cuddle Cat and pink blanket were still on the bed, but Madeleine was gone. After briefly searching the apartment, Kate ran back towards the restaurant, screaming [...] "Madeleine's gone! Someone's taken her!" ...|$|E
500|$|One {{night while}} Jackson was asleep, Joseph climbed {{into his room}} through <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> <b>window.</b> Wearing a fright mask, he entered the room {{screaming}} and shouting. Joseph {{said he wanted to}} teach his children not to leave the window open when they went to sleep. For a number of years afterward, Jackson suffered nightmares about being kidnapped from his bedroom. By the early 1980s, he was deeply unhappy; Jackson explained, [...] "Even at home, I'm lonely. I sit in my room sometimes and cry. It's so hard to make friends... I sometimes walk around the neighborhood at night, just hoping to find someone to talk to. But I just end up coming home." ...|$|E
60|$|He was now town councillor. They {{looked at}} the night, which {{was the same as}} the London night, only a good deal more transparent. Church bells down in the town were {{striking}} eleven o'clock. The wind was off the sea. And all <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> <b>windows</b> were dark--the Pages were asleep; the Garfits were asleep; the Cranches were asleep--whereas in London at this hour they were burning Guy Fawkes on Parliament Hill.|$|R
50|$|The two wings {{radiating}} from the six-sided hall embody a ten-faced, symmetrical plan. The symmetry is part reinforced and part {{broken by the}} handling of voids. The north entrance porch and the arches over <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> <b>windows</b> in <b>the</b> south facade reinforce the symmetry, whereas the south west porch, the bays and the windows provide asymmetry. The asymmetric disposition of {{the functions of the}} rooms is reflected in the positioning of the windows.|$|R
2500|$|The Exorcist (1973) {{was set in}} the {{neighborhood}} and partially filmed there. In the movie's climactic scene, the protagonist is hurled down the 75-step staircase at the end of 36th Street NW, which connects Prospect Street with M Street below. The staircase {{has come to be known}} as the [...] "Exorcist steps". A false front was built onto the house at the top of the steps so that <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> <b>windows</b> would immediately overlook the steps. The real structure is considerably set-back.|$|R
500|$|Raised to {{squadron}} leader, Scherger {{was posted}} to England in August 1934 {{to study at}} RAF Staff College, Andover. Just prior to departing, {{he was involved in}} a notorious incident at RAAF Station Laverton. A fellow squadron leader arrived home early from a mess function to find his wife sleeping with another officer, who escaped by crashing through <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> <b>window.</b> The squadron leader then pursued his wife with a loaded revolver, the pair eventually arriving at Scherger's quarters. Faced with the frightened woman and the enraged husband crying that he would [...] "shoot the bitch", Scherger knocked the man down with a poker. The unconscious husband was placed in the guardhouse, and the woman given shelter off the base; the officer she had slept with promptly resigned his commission.|$|E
500|$|... "Childhood" [...] is a biographical {{reference}} to Jackson's difficult {{years as a}} youngster, such as the relationship with his father Joseph and the pressures of being world-famous from {{such a young age}} as the lead singer of The Jackson 5. From a young age Jackson and his siblings were allegedly physically and emotionally abused by their father through incessant rehearsals, whippings and derogatory name calling. Jackson's abuse as a child had affected him throughout his later life. In one altercation—later recalled by Marlon Jackson—Joseph held Michael Jackson upside down by one leg and [...] "pummelled him over and over again with his hand, hitting him on his back and buttocks". Joseph would allegedly often trip up or push his sons into walls. One night, while Jackson was asleep, Joseph climbed into his room through <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> <b>window.</b> Wearing a fright mask, he entered the room screaming and shouting. Joseph said he wanted to teach his children not to leave the window open when they went to sleep. For a number of years afterward, Jackson suffered nightmares about being kidnapped from his bedroom.|$|E
500|$|Chris says {{he hates}} classic rock {{stations}} because they {{always end up}} playing We Built This City from Starship. The radio station Chris tunes in to is [...] "Classic Rock 103.7 WHTT". WHTT was the callsign for the current Boston, MA radio station WODS, a classic hits station {{at the time that}} played the same music the fictional WHTT apparently airs before flipping to Top 40 in 2012 as 103.3 Amp Radio. The station had the callsign from 1983–86. This further references Boston influences on the TV show. Another station actually holds the callsigns now, 104.1 WHTT-FM in Buffalo, NY, with the same format. After Stewie is injected with steroids, he lifts a barbell on one side and says [...] "I have the power!" [...] and the show then shifts scenes the same as in Masters of the Universe. It is mentioned that Connie is the key to One-Eyed Willy’s gold, a reference to The Goonies. Paul Sorvino and Chazz Palminteri are seen acting in a fictional movie called [...] "Distracting Trumpet". After Stewie's steroids injection wears off and he jumps out <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> <b>window,</b> the music playing is from the cartoon The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show.|$|E
6000|$|While they debated this {{question}} {{a procession of}} five large waggons went past, laden with hay up to <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> <b>windows.</b> They {{came in from the}} country, and the steaming horses had probably been travelling a great part of the night. To the shaft of each hung a little board, on which was painted in white letters, [...] "Henchard, corn-factor and hay-merchant." [...] The spectacle renewed his wife's conviction that, for her daughter's sake, she should strain a point to rejoin him.|$|R
60|$|Take {{the house}} with the green blinds for instance. We know it is a quadrille party, because we saw some men taking up the front drawing-room carpet while we sat at breakfast this morning, and if further {{evidence}} be required, and we must tell the truth, we just now saw one of the young ladies ‘doing’ another of the young ladies’ hair, near one of <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> <b>windows,</b> in an unusual style of splendour, which nothing else but a quadrille party could possibly justify.|$|R
50|$|Some {{of their}} fights would also cause damage {{in other parts}} of their house (i.e.: <b>the</b> master <b>bedroom</b> <b>windows,</b> where Maude and Walter each threw the other's {{suitcases}} through; the kitchen window, which Walter threw a bottle of scotch through).|$|R
2500|$|The bedroom {{contained}} a single, double and triple bed {{as well as}} two four-person beds. Outside <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> <b>window,</b> in the main living area, is a lip shaped sofa that the presenters of the show refer to as [...] "the lips". The house also contains a salon/bathroom, which houses two large hair dryers and two steam suits.|$|E
2500|$|The murders Yates {{committed}} between 1996 and 1998 in Spokane {{all involved}} sex workers in Spokane's [...] "Skid Row" [...] area on E. Sprague Avenue. The victims were initially solicited for prostitution by Yates, {{who would have}} sex with them (often in his 1979 Ford van), sometimes do drugs with them, then kill them and dump their bodies in rural locations. All of his victims died of gunshot wounds to the head; eight of the murders were committed with a Raven [...]25-caliber handgun, and one attempted murder {{was linked to the}} same model of handgun. Autopsies of two of the victims indicated that the killer was a marksman aiming for the heart. One particularly bizarre detail of Yates' murders involved the case of Melody Murfin, whose body was buried just outside <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> <b>window</b> of Yates' family home.|$|E
2500|$|They put the set {{so that it}} was {{upside down}} and {{attached}} the camera so that it looked like the room was right side up, then they poured gallons of red water into the room, because the normal film blood would not make the right effect for the geyser. [...] During the filming of this scene, the blood poured in an unexpected way causing the rotating room to spin. [...] Much of the blood spilled out of <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> <b>window</b> covering Craven and Langenkamp. The scene where Nancy is attacked by Krueger in her bathtub was accomplished with a special bottomless tub. The tub was put in a bathroom set that was built over a swimming pool. During the underwater sequence Heather Langenkamp was replaced with a stuntwoman. The [...] "melting staircase" [...] as seen in Nancy's dream was Robert Shaye's idea; it was created using pancake mix.|$|E
50|$|The Training Unit {{was built}} on part of the grounds of Mountjoy Prison between 1973 and 1974. It {{received}} its first prisoner in August 1975. The object of the Training Unit is to facilitate prisoners finding employment upon release by providing education and industrial training. It is a semi-open prison. There are no bars on <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> <b>windows,</b> prisoners may move about from area to area without being accompanied by prison staff and they each have a key to their own rooms. Staff, however, retain a masterkey to all the rooms.|$|R
50|$|Little (it is {{impossible}} to say how much) of this Regency house, {{which began in the}} last year of George III's reign, remains. Some of the doors and one of <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> <b>windows</b> are still clearly identifiable as is part of the roof. But the greater portion of it was pulled down by Thomas's youngest son, General George de Sausmarez who, having bought his brothers' shares of the property, became Seigneur and in 1873 began building the last and final additions to the family home with typical mid-Victorian gusto, employing a Parisian garden designer who had ambitious plans which would not be fulfilled.|$|R
5000|$|During Haines incumbency, the cordial {{relations}} between Anglicans and dissenters deteriorated. In 1799, {{shots were fired}} through <b>the</b> vicarage <b>bedroom</b> <b>window,</b> [...] "manifestly with a destructive and malicious intent" [...] while Dr and Mrs Haines were asleep in bed. The Vicarage was Washington House, on High Pavement.|$|R
2500|$|Helgeland {{found that}} Hanson {{had been hired}} to direct and met with him while the filmmaker was making The River Wild. They found that they not only shared a love for Ellroy's fiction but also agreed on how to adapt Confidential into a film. According to Helgeland, they had to [...] "remove every scene from the book that didn't have the three main cops in it, and then to work from those scenes out." [...] According to Hanson, he [...] "wanted the {{audience}} to be challenged {{but at the same}} time I didn't want them to get lost". They worked on the script together for two years, with Hanson turning down jobs and Helgeland writing seven drafts for free. The two men also got Ellroy's approval of their approach. He had seen Hanson's films, <b>The</b> <b>Bedroom</b> <b>Window</b> and Bad Influence and found him to be [...] "a competent and interesting storyteller", but was not convinced that his book would be made into a film until he talked to the eventual director. He later said, [...] "They preserved the basic integrity of the book and its main theme. Brian and Curtis took a work of fiction that had eight plotlines, reduced those to three, and retained the dramatic force of three men working out their destiny." ...|$|E
2500|$|The next day, September 1, {{there was}} a third {{reported}} incident. A Mrs. Kearney, of Marshall Avenue, Mattoon, reported smelling a strong, sweet odor around 11:00 pm. At first she dismissed the smell, believing it to be from flowers outside of the window, but the odor soon became stronger {{and she began to}} lose feeling in her legs. Mrs. Kearney panicked and her calls attracted her sister, Mrs. Ready, who was in the house at the time. Mrs. Ready also noticed the odor, and determined that it was coming from the direction of <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> <b>window,</b> which was open at the time. The police were contacted, but no evidence of a prowler was found. At around 12:30 am, [...] Bert Kearney, Mrs. Kearney's husband (a local taxi driver who had been absent {{during the time of the}} attack), returned home to find an unidentified man hiding close to one of the house's windows. The man fled and Kearney was unable to catch him. Kearney's description of the prowler was of a tall man dressed in dark clothing, wearing a tight fitting cap. This description was reported in the local media, and became the common description of the gasser throughout the Mattoon incident. After the attack, Mrs. Kearney reported suffering from a burning sensation on her lips and throat, which were attributed to the effects of the gas.|$|E
2500|$|The best-known {{early to}} mid 20th century novelist {{associated}} with Birmingham was J. R. R. Tolkien, whose books The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings {{are two of}} the world's four best-selling books of all time, with over 100 million and over 150 million copies in print respectively. Although Tolkien was born in Bloemfontein in South Africa, he later called this a [...] "fallacious fact" [...] claiming that he [...] "happened to be born there by accident". Both of his parents were from Birmingham and he was brought up in the city from the age of three, living in Sarehole – an area of Hall Green then on the semi-rural southern edge of the city – and in Moseley, Kings Heath, Edgbaston and Rednal. Tolkien later remembered his time in Hall Green in particular as [...] "the longest-seeming and most formative part of my life" [...] and numerous connections have been made between his Birmingham upbringing and features of his work: Sarehole Mill has been seen as the inspiration for the [...] "Great Mill" [...] of The Hobbit; Moseley Bog as the basis of the [...] "Old Forest" [...] of Book One of The Lord of the Rings; and the gothic brick towers of Perrott's Folly and Edgbaston Waterworks – dominating the skyline from <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> <b>window</b> of Tolkien's home in Stirling Street, Edgbaston – as the inspiration for [...] "The Two Towers" [...] of Book Two of The Lord of the Rings.|$|E
50|$|The {{first floor}} breakfast room has timber veneer wall {{panelling}} and a dumb waiter cabinet, {{which is no}} longer used.

50|$|In the {{signature}} scene that closes almost every episode, the family house is enveloped in darkness, save for one, {{two or three}} lights in <b>the</b> upstairs <b>bedroom</b> <b>windows.</b> Through voice-overs, two or more characters make some brief comments related to that episode's events, and then bid each other goodnight, after which the lights go out.|$|R
