5|$|At around 10:00am, the Israelis renewed <b>the</b> <b>attack,</b> {{moving toward}} Jebel Mariam, Abu 'Atwa and Nefisha. The paratroopers at Jebel Mariam became engaged in intense {{fighting}} but, with their advantageous position, {{were able to}} repel <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> by late afternoon. Meanwhile, the Israelis concentrated artillery and mortar fire against the Sa'iqa positions at Abu 'Atwa and Nefisha. At noon, advance Israeli elements engaged with a Sa'iqa reconnaissance unit, and the Israelis lost two tanks and a half-track. At 1:00pm, an Israeli paratrooper company attacked Abu 'Atwa without first scouting ahead, and was ambushed and annihilated. <b>The</b> <b>attack</b> ended after paratroopers suffered over fifty casualties and lost four tanks.|$|E

50|$|Muslim organisations in France, {{such as the}} Union of Islamic Organisations of France, {{strongly}} condemned <b>the</b> <b>attacks</b> in Paris. <b>The</b> <b>attacks</b> affected {{business at}} high-profile venues and shopping centres in Paris, and many Parisians were concerned <b>the</b> <b>attacks</b> {{might lead to a}} marginalisation of Muslims in the city. There was not the same call for solidarity with Islam, as in January, following <b>the</b> <b>attacks.</b> Sales of <b>the</b> French flag, which the French had rarely displayed prior to <b>the</b> <b>attacks,</b> increased dramatically after <b>the</b> <b>attacks.</b>|$|R

5|$|At {{the time}} of <b>the</b> <b>attack,</b> Croatian President Franjo Tuđman was in the building, meeting Stjepan Mesić, then President of the Presidency of Yugoslavia, and Ante Marković, then Prime Minister of Yugoslavia, {{but none of them}} were injured in <b>the</b> <b>attack.</b> In {{immediate}} aftermath, Tuđman remarked that <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> was apparently meant to destroy the Banski dvori as the seat of the statehood of Croatia. Marković blamed Yugoslav Defence Secretary General Veljko Kadijević, who denied the accusation and suggested the event was staged by Croatia. <b>The</b> <b>attack</b> prompted international condemnation and consideration of economic sanctions against Yugoslavia. The presidential residence was immediately moved to the Presidential palace, which was formerly known as Villa Zagorje. The Banski dvori sustained significant damage, but repairs started only in 1995. The building later became the seat of the Croatian Government.|$|E

25|$|MAD divided {{potential}} {{nuclear war}} into two stages: first strike and second strike.

In this situation, whether <b>the</b> U.S. first <b>attacked</b> <b>the</b> USSR or <b>the</b> USSR first <b>attacked</b> <b>the</b> U.S., the end result would be that both nations would be damaged to the point of utter social collapse.|$|R
50|$|On {{the day of}} <b>the</b> <b>attacks,</b> U.S. {{intelligence}} agencies also intercepted communications that pointed to Osama bin Laden.

5|$|Kluge ordered <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> to {{be mounted}} {{on the night of}} 6/7 August.

Had surprise been achieved, <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> might well have succeeded, but Allied decoders at Ultra had intercepted and decrypted the orders for Operation Lüttich by August 4.
