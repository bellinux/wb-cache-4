In coastal areas, the aridity coupled with over-pumping of groundwater have often resulted in seawater intrusion. Looking for alternatives to provide freshwater for domestic, industrial and agricultural purposes is an ultimate goal for the government. The use of solar radiation in greenhouses to desalinate saline/brackish water was proposed as an alternative to provide freshwater for irrigation. This paper presents a study aimed at constructing and preliminary testing a humidification-dehumidification system in a Quonset greenhouse for producing freshwater. This greenhouse was modified to work with two humidifiers (i. e., evaporating pads), to increase water vapor inside the greenhouse as much as possible, and two dehumidifiers (i. e., condensers) to condense this water vapor. After evaporation, water leaving <b>the</b> <b>humidifiers</b> was cooler than the incoming water. This cooled water was pumped to the two dehumidifiers and acted as a coolant.

When the hygrostat calls for humidity, the valve is opened and causes a spray of water onto the biscuit. Hot air is passed through the biscuit, causing the water to evaporate from the pad and be carried into the building.|$|E

40|$|AbstractUpper airway dryness is a {{frequent}} side-effect of nasal continuous positive airway pressure therapy (nCPAP) in obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). In this situation, heated or non-heated passover humidifiers are often added to the nCPAP-therapy. The efficacy of these two modes in terms of increasing the absolute humidity of the inspired air in vivo has {{so far not been}} established. The present investigation was therefore designed to compare various heated and non-heated passover humidifiers in terms of the their ability to increase the absolute humidity in the inspired air during nCPAP. In six healthy test individuals, nCPAP-therapy at pressures of 5 mbar and 10 mbar was simulated, and the relative humidity and temperature of the air within the tube at the junction between CPAP tube and mask were measured. In each test person, measurements were carried out both with and without the two heated (HC 100 Â®, Fischer&Paykel Inc., New Zealand and HumidAireÂ®, ResMed Ltd., Australia) and two non-heated (OasisÂ®and HumidifierÂ®, both from Respironics Inc., U. S. A.) passover humidifiers under steady-state conditions. The absolute humidity was calculated from the relative humidity and temperature measurements. The mean (SD) absolute humidity (gmâ 3) in the steady-state was significantly (P< 0 Â· 05 higher with each of <b>the</b> <b>humidifiers</b> than that calculated when no <b>humidifier</b> was used. <b>The</b> relevant figures were as follows: no humidifier: 10 Â· 2 (1 Â· 8) gmâ 3 (at 5 mbar) / 9 Â· 8 (1 Â· 8) gmâ 3 (at 10 mbar); HumidifierÂ®: 16 Â· 4 (0 Â· 97) / 15 Â· 6 (1 Â· 26); OasisÂ®: 17 Â· 3 (0 Â· 97) / 16 Â· 7 (0 Â· 93); HC 100 Â®: 26 Â· 5 (1 Â· 40) / 26 Â· 2 (1 Â· 23); HumidAireÂ®: 31 Â· 8 (2 Â· 50) / 30 Â· 9 (2 Â· 64). The mean increase in absolute humidity (in gmâ 3) with the aid of <b>the</b> heated <b>humidifiers</b> was 16 Â· 3 (5 mbar) gmâ 3 / 16 Â· 4 (10 mbar) gmâ 3 with HC 100 Â®and 21 Â· 6 / 21 Â· 1 with HumidAireÂ®, and in both cases was clearly and significantly (P= 0 Â· 028) higher in comparison with the non-heated humidifiersâ 6 Â· 2 / 5 Â· 8 with HumidifierÂ®and 7 Â· 2 / 6 Â· 9 with OasisÂ®.

In this study, a comparison is made between the tracheal climate after tracheobronchial humidifica-tion either with molecular water (via a vaporizing humidifier) or particulate water (via spray) in spontaneously breathing tracheo-tomized patients. Methods. We performed a randomized, 2 -way crossover study on 10 tracheotomized patients. Tracheal humidity and temperature were measured prior to and after use of a vaporiz-ing humidifier and aerosol spray, respectively. Results. After use of both <b>the</b> vaporizing <b>humidifier</b> and <b>the</b> aerosol spray, the end-inspiratory total water content and water gradient in the upper trachea increased significantly, compared with baseline values before application. After end of use of <b>the</b> vaporizing <b>humidifier,</b> <b>the</b> total water content and the water gra-dient decreased significantly faster than after application of the aerosol spray. Conclusions. Delivery of both molecular and particulate water significantly increases the tracheal climate and condition-ing in the tracheal airways. Because the tracheal humidity remained on a higher level after aerosol spray, we speculate that particulate water may be efficient on tracheal humidification for longer. However, the positive effect on tracheal humidity after prolonged application of the aerosol spray remains to be pro...|$|R
