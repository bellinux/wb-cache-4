5|$|In 1959, the Marvell Press {{published}} Listen presents Philip Larkin reading The Less Deceived (Listen LPV1), an LP {{record on}} which Larkin recites all the poems from The Less Deceived {{in the order}} they appear in <b>the</b> <b>printed</b> volume. This was followed, in 1965, by Philip Larkin reads and comments on The Whitsun Weddings (Listen LPV6), again on the Marvell Press's record label (though <b>the</b> <b>printed</b> volume was published by Faber and Faber). Once again the poems are read in {{the order in which}} they appear in <b>the</b> <b>printed</b> volume, but with Larkin including introductory remarks to many of the poems. A recording of Larkin reading the poems from his final collection, High Windows, was published in 1975 as British poets of our time. Philip Larkin; High Windows: poems read by the author (edited by Peter Orr) on the Argo record label (Argo PLP 1202). As with the two previous recordings, the sequencing of the poems is the same as in <b>the</b> <b>printed</b> volume.|$|E

5|$|At independence, a King George V 5 pence {{registered}} {{envelope and}} 1 shilling telegram form were printed in green {{for use in}} Ireland until domestic products became available. Irish telegram forms were only produced in 1/- and 1/6 values. Registered envelopes have appeared in many values and sizes. <b>The</b> <b>printed</b> (but non-stamped) registered envelopes were produced by private firms and stored by the Irish post office until needed, so envelopes from former periods, showing out-dated fees in the text, often received an impressed stamp for the current postal rate, creating many subtypes for collectors.

40|$|Flexography is a {{printing}} technique {{widely used in}} the packaging production. The main feature of flexography {{is the use of}} {{a printing}} plate elastically deformed during the reproduction process. <b>The</b> <b>printing</b> plate is made of an elastic material, rubber or nowadays of mainly different types of photopolymer. The elasticity of the plate enables <b>the</b> <b>printing</b> {{on a wide range of}} printing substrates, which is one of its advantages compared to other <b>printing</b> techniques. On <b>the</b> other hand, deformations of <b>the</b> <b>printing</b> plate in <b>the</b> <b>printing</b> process caused by the pressure between <b>the</b> <b>printing</b> plate and <b>the</b> substrate present a major limitation of flexography. Apart from the functional properties of <b>the</b> <b>printing</b> plate in <b>the</b> <b>printing</b> process, <b>the</b> plate making process, including photo polymerization, considerably influences the value of halftones on <b>the</b> <b>printing</b> plate, and consequently on the final product. The aim of this paper is to examine the influence of screen ruling on <b>the</b> formation of <b>printing</b> elements and <b>the</b> adjustment of <b>the</b> <b>printing</b> plate making process in order to achieve optimal quality of <b>the</b> <b>printing</b> plate and, therefore, the final product. The results have shown that the use of different screen rulings is of great significance in <b>the</b> processes of <b>printing</b> plate curve adjustment. It was proven that the use of different screen ruling has a considerable influence upon relief depth and a cross-section of <b>the</b> <b>printing</b> elements (3 D analysis), which again have a significant impact on the quality of the final product, but cannot be detected in 2 D analysis...|$|R

5|$|Harper {{noticed that}} Bartram's notes were {{considerably}} altered and expanded in <b>the</b> <b>printed</b> edition, and the {{detail of the}} white tail appeared in print {{for the first time}} in this revised account. Harper believed that Bartram could have tried to fill in details of the bird from memory and got the tail coloration wrong. Harper and several other researchers have attempted to prove the former existence of a king vulture relative in Florida at this late date, suggesting that the population was in the process of extinction and finally disappeared during a cold spell. Additionally, William McAtee, noting the tendency of birds to form Floridian subspecies, suggested that the white tail could be a sign that the painted vulture was a subspecies of the king vulture.|$|E
5|$|Jean Coralli and Jules Perrot choreographed the {{original}} version of Giselle. Perrot and Carlotta Grisi were lovers and, consequently, Perrot designed all of her dances and pantomime. Everyone in the Paris dance world knew that Perrot had created Grisi's dances and Coralli admitted it, but Perrot was given no official credit in <b>the</b> <b>printed</b> materials such as posters and programs. This was most likely done to prevent Perrot from collecting royalties on the ballet. Perrot liked bold touches and planned several rapid aerial swoops on wires in Act II for Giselle. Grisi was afraid of these swoops, therefore a stage hand {{was brought in to}} test them. He crashed face-first into the scenery and the swoops were dropped.|$|E
5|$|Movable type: The polymath {{scientist}} and official Shen Kuo (1031–1095) of the Song Dynasty (960–1279) {{was the first}} to describe the process of movable type printing in his Dream Pool Essays of 1088. He attributed the innovation of reusable fired clay characters to a little-known artisan named Bi Sheng (990–1051). Bi had experimented with wooden type characters, but their use was not perfected until 1297 to 1298 with the model of the official Wang Zhen (fl. 1290–1333) of the Yuan Dynasty (1271–1368), who also arranged written characters by rhyme scheme on the surface of round table compartments. It was not until 1490 with <b>the</b> <b>printed</b> works of Hua Sui (1439–1513) of the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644) that the Chinese perfected metal movable type characters, namely bronze. The Qing Dynasty (1644–1912) scholar Xu Zhiding of Tai'an, Shandong developed vitreous enamel movable type printing in 1718.|$|E

5|$|The {{document}} {{signed by}} Congress and {{enshrined in the}} National Archives is usually regarded as the Declaration of Independence, but historian Julian P.

The Declaration was first published as a broadside that was printed the night of July 4 by John Dunlap of Philadelphia. Dunlap printed about 200 broadsides, of which 26 are known to survive. The 26th copy was discovered in The National Archives in England in 2009.|$|E
5|$|Until this point, all <b>the</b> <b>printed</b> {{material}} (mostly just charts of {{the alphabet}} and its standard orthography equivalents) had been produced with large wooden type, which was not suitable for printing at small sizes. Because the alphabet was wholly unique, no font existed, so in 1857 {{the board of regents}} appointed Erastus Snow to procure metal type from St. Louis-based font foundry Ladew & Peer. However, in May 1857 the Utah War began, and Snow left St. Louis to support the Mormon pioneers. During the war, Ladew & Peer kept working on the type, and the punches and matrices were delivered in the winter of 1858. The first use of the new type was to make a business card for George A. Smith, an early Mormon historian.|$|E
5|$|At {{an early}} stage, CART {{encountered}} problems {{in promoting the}} race. They were unable to adequately educate British motor racing fans about the series. Rockingham's owners attempted to display an advertisement at the 2001 British Grand Prix but the owner of Formula One's commercial rights Bernie Ecclestone cancelled the plan shortly before {{it was due to}} occur. A major marketing strategy took place in response. The advertising, headed by the Michaelides & Bednash agency, began in August in <b>the</b> <b>printed</b> press, and also included two television advertisements and an official poster. The event was affected by drainage problems on the new track which caused the practice sessions to be cancelled. The starting order was set according to the drivers' positions in the points' standings. Its distance was reduced from 210 to 140 laps and was won by Team Penske driver Gil de Ferran after overtaking pole position starter Kenny Bräck on the race's final lap. Most drivers praised the circuit but did not criticise the problem that affected it. Despite two days of practice and qualifying rounds being cancelled because of the drainage issues, 38,000 spectators watched the race. The track later had an extra layer added along with a sealant to allow it to drain water.|$|E

The Victoria and Albert Museum possesses a deluxe edition, numbered 4 of 10. A publicly accessible copy of the deluxe edition is available at the Rare Books Division of the New York Public Library and a small copy resides at Western Michigan University in Kalamazoo, Michigan, while the Frances Mulhall Achilles Library at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City hosts a promotional prospectus. The Victoria and Albert Museum's copy was first exhibited in a display entitled The Book and Beyond, held in the Museum's 20th Century Gallery from April to October 1995. The same copy was subsequently also included in a V display entitled Digital Pioneers, from 2009–2010.

5|$|Johann Tetzel {{responded to}} the Theses by calling for Luther to be burnt for heresy and having theologian Konrad Wimpina write 106 theses against Luther's work. Tetzel defended these in a disputation before the University of Frankfurt on the Oder in January 1518. 800 copies of <b>the</b> <b>printed</b> disputation were sent to be sold in Wittenberg, but {{students}} of the University seized them from the bookseller and burned them. Luther became increasingly fearful that the situation was out of hand {{and that he would}} be in danger. To placate his opponents, he published a Sermon on Indulgences and Grace, which did not challenge the pope's authority. This pamphlet, written in German, was very short and easy for laypeople to understand. Luther's first widely successful work, it was reprinted twenty times. Tetzel responded with a point-by-point refutation, citing heavily from the Bible and important theologians. His pamphlet was not nearly as popular as Luther's. Luther's reply to Tetzel's pamphlet, on the other hand, was another publishing success for Luther.|$|E
5|$|Louis XIV {{used the}} Bastille as a prison for upper-class members of French society who had opposed or angered him including, after the {{revocation}} of the Edict of Nantes, French Protestants. From 1659 onwards, the Bastille functioned {{primarily as a}} state penitentiary; by 1789, 5,279 prisoners had passed through its gates. Under Louis XV and XVI, the Bastille was used to detain prisoners from more varied backgrounds, and to support {{the operations of the}} Parisian police, especially in enforcing government censorship of <b>the</b> <b>printed</b> media. Although inmates were kept in relatively good conditions, criticism of the Bastille grew during the 18th century, fueled by autobiographies written by former prisoners. Reforms were implemented and prisoner numbers were considerably reduced. In 1789 the royal government's financial crisis and the formation of the National Assembly gave rise to a swelling of republican sentiments among city-dwellers. On 14 July the Bastille was stormed by a revolutionary crowd, primarily residents of the faubourg Saint-Antoine who sought to commandeer the valuable gunpowder held within the fortress. Seven remaining prisoners were found and released and the Bastille's governor, Bernard-René de Launay, was killed by the crowd. The Bastille was demolished by order of the Committee of the Hôtel de Ville. Souvenirs of the fortress were transported around France and displayed as icons of the overthrow of despotism. Over the next century, the site and historical legacy of the Bastille featured prominently in French revolutions, political protests and popular fiction, and it remained an important symbol for the French Republican movement.|$|E
