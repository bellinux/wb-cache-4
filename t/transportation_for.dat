5|$|Albany {{has been}} a center of <b>transportation</b> <b>for</b> much of its history. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, Albany saw {{development}} of the turnpike and by 1815, Albany was the turnpike center of the state. Simeon De Witt developed a grid block system in 1794, and renamed streets for birds and mammals that had honored British royalty. This grid was intersected by the major arterials coming out of Albany, which cut through the city at unexpected angles. The construction of the turnpike across the state, in conjunction with canal and railroad systems, made Albany the hub of <b>transportation</b> <b>for</b> pioneers going to Buffalo and the Michigan Territory in the early- and mid-19th century.|$|E

5|$|Born in North Carolina, Coffin {{was exposed}} to and {{developed}} an opposition to slavery as a child. He followed his family and immigrated to Indiana in 1826, following the slaveholders' persecution of Quakers. In Indiana he became a local business leader, merchant, and farmer. Coffin's accumulated wealth from his business interests allowed {{him to become a}} major investor in the Richmond, Indiana, branch of the Second State Bank of Indiana, where he served as director in the 1830s. Coffin's financial position and standing in the community also provided the mead to supply food, clothing, and <b>transportation</b> <b>for</b> the Underground Railroad operations in the region.|$|E

5|$|Flying Blind, Flying Safe is a non-fiction {{book about}} the American airline {{industry}} and Federal Aviation Administration, written by Mary Schiavo with Sabra Chartrand. The book {{was first published in}} March 1997 in hardcover format by Avon Books. An updated paperback edition was published on April 1, 1998. Schiavo is a former Inspector General of the United States Department of Transportation, and Chartrand a journalist for The New York Times. Schiavo was Inspector General of the United States Department of <b>Transportation</b> <b>for</b> six years, and resigned in 1996 shortly after the ValuJet Flight 592 airline crash in the Florida Everglades. She became a whistleblower and was highly critical of the airline industry and its relationship with aviation safety agencies in the United States federal government.|$|E
5|$|In {{conjunction}} with {{the sinking of the}} first colliery {{at the head of the}} Rhondda, the second issue of transportation was being tackled at the same time with the extension of the Taff Vale Railway (TVR) line. After Royal Assent was given to construct the railway in 1836, the original line was laid from Cardiff to Abercynon, and by 1841 a branch was opened to link Cardiff with Dinas via Pontypridd. This would allow easier and faster <b>transportation</b> <b>for</b> Walter Coffin's Dinas mine, an unsurprising addition considering Coffin was a director of the TVR. In 1849 the TVR had extended into the Rhondda Fach and by 1856 the railway had reached the furthest areas of both the Fach and Fawr valleys at Maerdy and Treherbert. For the first time the Rhondda Valley was connected by a major transportation route to the rest of Wales and the exploitation of its coalfields could begin.|$|E
