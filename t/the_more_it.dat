5|$|In the late-1960s, Mikhail Ivanovich Budyko {{worked with}} simple {{two-dimensional}} energy-balance climate models {{to investigate the}} reflectivity of ice. He found that the ice-albedo feedback created a positive feedback loop in the Earth's climate system. The more snow and ice, the more solar radiation is reflected back into space and hence the colder Earth grows and <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>it</b> snows. Other studies found that pollution or a volcano eruption could provoke the onset of an ice age.|$|E
5|$|Preload {{refers to}} the filling {{pressure}} of the atria {{at the end of}} diastole, when they are at their fullest. A main factor is how long it takes the ventricles to fill—if the ventricles contract faster, then there is less time to fill and the preload will be less. Preload can also be affected by a person's blood volume. The force of each contraction of the heart muscle is proportional to the preload, described as the Frank-Starling mechanism. This states that the force of contraction is directly proportional to the initial length of muscle fiber, meaning a ventricle will contract more forcefully, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>it</b> is stretched.|$|E
5|$|The protagonist wields four {{different}} styles of weapons throughout the game: sword, spear, axe, and bazooka. Almost all swords, axes, and spears have four versions, and repeated use of them can increase their skill levels {{to a maximum of}} three, unlocking a new charged attack with each level. The range and power of each type of weapon increased <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>it</b> is used; for instance, spears at a high enough level may be thrown at an enemy across the screen, while the swords and axes can cut swathes of destruction around the boy's vicinity. With the exception of the Bone Crusher, all swords, axes, and spears can cut through vegetation; some weapons are required to break rocks and other barriers.|$|E

25|$|The {{name of the}} {{movement}} comes from a painting by Kandinsky created in 1903 (see illustration).

25|$|Aristotle holds a teleological worldview: he {{sees the}} {{universe}} as inherently purposeful. Basically, Aristotle claims that potentiality exists {{for the sake of}} actuality. Thus, matter exists for the sake of receiving its form, and an organism has sight for the sake of seeing. Now, each thing has certain potentialities {{as a result of its}} form. Because of its form, a snake has the potential to slither. Hence, we can say that the snake ought to slither.

25|$|Reasoning {{efficiency}}. This {{refers to}} the run time efficiency of the system. The ability {{of the knowledge base}} to be updated and the reasoner to develop new inferences in a reasonable period of time. In some ways this is the flip side of expressive adequacy. In general the more powerful a representation, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>it</b> has expressive adequacy, the less efficient its automated reasoning engine will be. Efficiency was often an issue, especially for early applications of knowledge representation technology. They were usually implemented in interpreted environments such as Lisp which were slow compared to more traditional platforms of the time.|$|E
25|$|ACS {{sends out}} {{a large number of}} virtual ant agents to explore many {{possible}} routes on the map. Each ant probabilistically chooses the next city to visit based on a heuristic combining the distance to the city and the amount of virtual pheromone deposited on the edge to the city. The ants explore, depositing pheromone on each edge that they cross, until they have all completed a tour. At this point the ant which completed the shortest tour deposits virtual pheromone along its complete tour route (global trail updating). The amount of pheromone deposited is inversely proportional to the tour length: the shorter the tour, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>it</b> deposits.|$|E
25|$|The {{name of the}} {{movement}} is {{the title of a}} painting that Kandinsky created in 1903, but it is unclear whether it is the origin of the name of {{the movement}}, as Professor Klaus Lankheit learned that the title of the painting had been overwritten. Kandinsky wrote 20 years later that the name is derived from Marc's enthusiasm for horses and Kandinsky's love of riders, combined with a shared love of the colour blue. For Kandinsky, blue is the colour of spirituality: the darker the blue, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>it</b> awakens human desire for the eternal (see his 1911 book On the Spiritual in Art).|$|E

25|$|High-heeled shoes slant {{the foot}} forward and down while bending the toes up. The more the feet are forced into this position, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>it</b> may cause the {{gastrocnemius}} muscle (part of the calf muscle) to shorten. This may cause problems when the wearer chooses lower heels or flat-soled shoes. When the foot slants forward, {{a much greater}} weight is transferred to the ball of the foot and the toes, increasing the likelihood of damage to the underlying soft tissue that supports the foot. In many shoes, style dictates function, either compressing the toes or forcing them together, possibly resulting in blisters, corns, hammer toes, bunions (hallux valgus), Morton's neuroma, plantar fasciitis and many other medical conditions, {{most of which are}} permanent and require surgery to alleviate the pain.|$|E
25|$|Der Blaue Reiter ("The Blue Rider") {{formed in}} Munich, Germany in 1911. Wassily Kandinsky, Franz Marc, August Macke, Alexej von Jawlensky, Marianne von Werefkin and others founded {{the group in}} {{response}} to the rejection of Kandinsky's painting Last Judgment from an exhibition by Neue Künstlervereinigung—another artists' group of which Kandinsky had been a member. The name Der Blaue Reiter derived from Marc's enthusiasm for horses, and from Kandinsky's love of the colour blue. For Kandinsky, blue is the colour of spirituality—the darker the blue, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>it</b> awakens human desire for the eternal (see his 1911 book On the Spiritual in Art). Kandinsky had also titled a painting Der Blaue Reiter (see illustration) in 1903. The intense sculpture and printmaking of Käthe Kollwitz was strongly influenced by Expressionism, which also formed the starting point for the young artists who went on to join other tendencies within the movements of the early 20th century.|$|E
25|$|New {{forms of}} New Media are {{emerging}} like Web 2.0 tools Facebook and YouTube, along with {{video games and}} the consoles they are played on. It is helping to make video games and video game consoles branch out into New Media as well. Gamers on YouTube post videos of them playing video games they like and {{that people want to}} watch. Cultural changes are happening because people can upload their gaming experiences to a Web 2.0 tool like Facebook and YouTube for the world to see. Consoles like the Xbox One and the PlayStation 4 have WiFi connectivity and chat rooms on most of their video games that allow gamer-to-gamer conversations around the world. They also allow people to connect to YouTube, so if they stream/record a gamer, it allows for easy uploading to YouTube for the world to see. Even the older video game consoles are becoming new media because YouTube can display the walkthroughs and let's plays of the game. YouTube gaming is evolving because some YouTubers are getting wealthy and earning money from their videos. The more people that become YouTube members, the popular YouTube becomes and <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>it</b> starts emerging as a new source of media, along with video games and consoles. The chat room/online gaming/WiFi consoles are getting the highest increase in popularity because they are not only the most advanced, but because of the newest video games being created {{that the majority of the}} gaming community wants to buy, play and watch. The older video games and consoles also get popularity, but from YouTube's capabilities of uploading them to the gamer's channels for everyone to see. The older games get popularity from the communities nostalgia of the game(s), and the old school graphics and gameplay that made people see how old-school technology was the best at some point in time. Facebook helps those video games and consoles get popularity as well. People can upload the videos they create to Facebook as well. Facebook is a much larger website with a lot more users, so people use Facebook to spread their gaming content as well.|$|E
