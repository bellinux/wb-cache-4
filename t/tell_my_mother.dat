2500|$|It {{was during}} this time that he met his future wife, Jeanne Rucar Lefebvre, a {{gymnastics}} teacher who had won an Olympic bronze medal. Buñuel courted her in a formal Aragonese manner, complete with a chaperone, [...] and they married in 1934 despite a warning by Jean Epstein when Buñuel first proposed in 1930: [...] "Jeanne, you are making a mistake... It's not right for you, don't marry him." [...] The two remained married throughout his life and had two sons, Juan-Luis and Rafael. Diego Buñuel, filmmaker and host of the National Geographic Channel's Don't <b>Tell</b> <b>My</b> <b>Mother</b> series, is their grandson.|$|E
2500|$|At {{about this}} time, after the First World War, {{she started the}} Children's Theatre, and later the Cave of Harmony, a nightclub at which modern plays and cabaret turns were performed. She revived old Victorian songs and ballads, many of which she {{retained}} for her performances in another revue entitled Riverside Nights. She became sufficiently famous for Columbia to invite her into the recording studio to make 78 rpm discs of four of the numbers she sang in these revues: [...] "Please Sell No More Drink to My Father" [...] and [...] "He Didn't Oughter" [...] were on one disc (recorded in 1926) and [...] "Don't <b>Tell</b> <b>My</b> <b>Mother</b> I'm Living in Sin" [...] and [...] "The Ladies Bar" [...] were on the other (recorded 1930).|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps Ruth {{had gone}} to <b>tell</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> that Mysa was lost," [...] Chebron {{suggested}} when Jethro had gone so far in his story.|$|E
6000|$|... "What will Mr. Washington {{and those}} gentlemen think of <b>my</b> servant <b>telling</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> {{at home that}} I was going to fight a duel?" [...] asks Mr. George, still in wrath.|$|R
60|$|When we {{were seated}} in the coach {{on the way to}} our house my father began to laugh and marvel which had been the most shy, the gallant or the lady, <b>telling</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> she need never reproach the English with bashfulness again after this French specimen.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{can hardly}} <b>tell</b> you. <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> is {{in a state}} of indescribable agitation. Her brother's Will has been found in Italy. And his {{daughter}} may arrive in England at a moment's notice." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is my {{wish that}} every {{family in the}} {{congregation}} should have some little thing to remember me by. This you will <b>tell</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't <b>tell</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> {{anything}} but the truth," [...] Ricardo went on. [...] "Here's my hand, how it does sting! and she must find out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If you {{are found}} out," [...] she said, [...] "I {{will take the}} blame upon myself, and <b>tell</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> that you were acting solely at my request." ...|$|E
60|$|I SAW {{that she}} heard his voice on the stairs before he {{actually}} made his appearance, <b>telling</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> that he had hastened to assure her {{that we were in}} no danger. The rising was due to M. de Boutteville, who, being disappointed in his plan of seizing the Cardinal's nieces as hostages, had gone galloping up and down Paris with his sword drawn, shouting that the two darlings of the people, M. de Beaufort and the Coadjutor, had been seized. He wildly hoped that the uproar this was sure to excite would frighten the Queen-Regent into releasing the Princes as she had before released Broussel.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{can prove}} it!" [...] said Eustace proudly. [...] "You know how scared I am of <b>my</b> <b>mother.</b> Well, {{for your sake}} I overcame my fear, and did {{something}} which, if she ever found out about it, would make her sorer than a sunburned neck! This house. She absolutely refused to let it to old Bennett and old Mortimer. They kept after her about it, but she wouldn't hear of it. Well, you told me on the boat that Wilhelmina Bennett had invited you to spend the summer with her, and I knew that, if they didn't come to Windles, they would take some other place, and that meant I wouldn't see you. So I hunted up old Mortimer, and let it {{to him on the}} quiet, without <b>telling</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> anything about it!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Victor didn't {{like the}} man, and he {{remained}} silent till Pettus repeated his question, then he answered, [...] "I can't <b>tell</b> you where <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> is." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I shall <b>tell</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> of this {{unexpected}} meeting," [...] said Sam, as he remounted his bicycle. [...] "Good-bye, Stephen. Don't romp {{too much with}} the children!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When yer boasts as I'm {{your brother}} I'll say you ain't. I'll <b>tell</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> about Reddy the morn, and syne she'll put {{you to the}} door smart.|$|E
6000|$|... "He's very uncertain," [...] said Lady Harman, {{with a quiet}} {{readiness}} that pleased Mr. Brumley. [...] "Yes, Snagsby, please, {{under the}} big cypress. And <b>tell</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> and sister." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps you are right, Cyril. I will myself <b>tell</b> <b>my</b> {{father and}} <b>mother.</b> I {{can assure you}} that I had no idea I should meet him to-day." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "You {{must not}} <b>tell</b> anyone," [...] <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> said, [...] "what I {{am about to}} tell you. In China your father had a sister who killed herself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What is it, George? Why don't you <b>tell</b> us?" [...] <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> asked quickly. And, to my surprise, her hand, {{in which}} mine was resting, was {{as cold as}} ice, {{notwithstanding}} the August heat.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, we'll go to {{the ladies}} now," [...] said Mr. Irwine, rising too. [...] "I want to <b>tell</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> what a splendid throne you've {{prepared}} for her under the marquee." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{may have}} to use two of them for years, may be. I heard the doctor <b>tell</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> so. I shall be up and about long before you will. Now then!" ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{was startled}} when Edna raised her hand, and strove to speak,--'Sir, do not tell--do not <b>tell</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> where he is. She must not fret him--she must not tell his friends--he would be angry.' ...|$|E
500|$|Back to the Future {{opened on}} July 3, 1985, on 1,200 screens in North America. Zemeckis was {{concerned}} the film would flop because Fox had to film a Family Ties special in London and {{was unable to}} promote the film. Gale was also dissatisfied with Universal Pictures' tagline [...] "Are you <b>telling</b> me <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> got the hots for me?".|$|R
6000|$|... "If I were {{to enter}} {{a room full of}} people," [...] said the fishy-eyed young man, [...] "and <b>tell</b> them that <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> had been run over by an omnibus, they would think it the funniest story they had heard in years." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{see that}} you are changed," [...] she said, [...] "except in your dress. You speak softly and naturally, just as you used to do, and not a bit like those little court fops, Uncle Talbot's pages. I am afraid you will {{not want to be}} my knight any more, now {{that you are going to}} get great honours at the war; for I heard <b>my</b> Uncle Talbot <b>tell</b> <b>my</b> lady <b>mother</b> that he was sure you would gain great credit for yourself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do, and {{if there}} is need, you will <b>tell</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother.</b> A night's rest may set me right, but I have not felt well these three or four days-- I shall be in my own old room." ...|$|E
60|$|I had no {{more than}} time to <b>tell</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> what I had seen, when my comrades were ready to set out for Oriskany Creek, {{counting}} {{to make their way}} over much the same ground we had just traversed.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll <b>tell</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> {{all about}} it--and Miss Oliver--and Walter," [...] Rilla gasped between sniffs. [...] "You sat for hours with Miller Douglas on that lobster trap, Mary Vance! What would Mrs. Elliott {{say to that}} if she knew?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Perhaps no one except Mr. Castleford {{could have}} prevailed over {{the fear of}} profanation {{in the mind of}} my father, who was, in his old- {{fashioned}} way, one of the most reverent of men, and could not bear to think of holy things being approached by one under a stigma, nor of exposing his son to add to his guilt by taking and breaking further pledges. However, he was struck by his friend's arguments, and I heard him <b>telling</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> that when he had wished to wait till there had been time to prove sincerity of repentance by a course of steadiness, the answer had been that it was hard to require strength, while denying the means of grace. <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> was scarcely convinced, but as he had consented she yielded without a protest; and she was really glad that I should have Clarence at my side to help me at the ceremony. The clergyman was applied to, and consented to let Clarence attend the classes, where his knowledge, comprehension, and behaviour were exemplary, so that a letter was written to my father expressive of perfect satisfaction with him. [...] 'There,' said my father, 'I knew it would be so! It is not THAT which I want.' ...|$|R
60|$|I find in {{relating}} {{those parts}} of my experience {{that seem to be}} of most significance I have neglected to <b>tell</b> of <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> death, which occurred the year before we moved to Grant Avenue. She had clung the rest of her days to the house in which I had been born. Of late years she had lived in my children, and Maude's devotion to her had been unflagging. Truth compels me to say that she had long ceased to be a factor in my life. I have thought of her in later years.|$|R
500|$|A {{number of}} sportscasters, writers and journalists point to Tunis' books as {{inspiration}} for their careers. Tunis is mentioned by author Daniel Okrent in the dedication for The Ultimate Baseball Book {{as one of}} [...] "those responsible for the earliest roots of this project". Writer and editor Tad Richards says, [...] "I remember <b>telling</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother...</b> 'When I {{grow up to be}} a writer, and people ask me about the greatest influence on my writing career, I'm going to say John R. Tunis. Among Tunis' many childhood fans are sports writer and children's author Thomas J. Dygard, Pulitzer Prize finalist Lee Martin, journalist Charles Kuralt [...] and football legend Johnny Unitas. New York Post columnist and editor Pete Hamill picked The Kid From Tomkinsville as one of his five favorite sports novels, writing that [...] "virtually every sportswriter I know remembers reading it as a boy." [...] In Partial Payment: Essays on Writers and Their Lives, literary critic Joseph Epstein devotes one chapter, [...] "A Boy's Own Author", to Tunis. Epstein admits that re-reading many childhood favorites can be disappointing, but found upon revisiting Tunis that his books are [...] "pretty serious, and I was utterly absorbed in them".|$|R
6000|$|I tried; {{and this}} time I succeeded. With the image of Mrs. Van Brandt vividly present to my mind, I {{arranged}} the first words of the sentence which was to <b>tell</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> that my [...] "infatuation" [...] was at an end! ...|$|E
6000|$|GLORIA (peremptorily at Valentine). Get up. (Valentine gets up abjectly.) Now {{let us have}} no false delicacy. <b>Tell</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> that we {{have agreed}} to marry one another. (A silence of stupefaction ensues. Valentine, dumb with panic, looks at them with an obvious impulse to run away.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Keep off," [...] he said, {{shrinking}} back. [...] "Touch me not! I {{know not}} whether the disease {{may not be}} catching even at its present stage. Sit down. I will stand here and tell you what I want you to <b>tell</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> in the morning." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And in case I {{should add}} no further words to this, let me {{conclude}} by <b>telling</b> <b>my</b> dear, dear <b>mother</b> that <b>my</b> whole soul and spirit are asking her forgiveness, and by sending my love to my brothers, and sister, whom I love far {{better now than}} ever I did when I was with them. And to Elvira too—-perhaps she is my sister by this time.|$|R
6000|$|... "We won't {{speak of}} that. I {{want to come}} back. I {{want to do what}} every rider aches in his secret heart to do for you.... Miss Withersteen, I hoped it'd not be {{necessary}} to <b>tell</b> you that <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> on her deathbed told me to have courage. She knew how the thing galled me--she told me to come back.... Will you take me?" ...|$|R
60|$|I LOST no time, of course, in <b>telling</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> {{all that}} I knew, and perhaps {{should have told}} her long before, and we saw {{ourselves}} at once in a difficult and dangerous position. Some of the man's money--if he had any--was certainly due to us, {{but it was not}} likely that our captain's shipmates, above all the two specimens seen by me, Black Dog and the blind beggar, would be inclined to give up their booty in payment of the dead man's debts. The captain's order to mount at once and ride for Doctor Livesey would have left <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> alone and unprotected, which was not to be thought of. Indeed, it seemed impossible for either of us to remain much longer in the house; the fall of coals in the kitchen grate, the very ticking of the clock, filled us with alarms. The neighbourhood, to our ears, seemed haunted by approaching footsteps; and what between the dead body of the captain on the parlour floor and the thought of that detestable blind beggar hovering near at hand and ready to return, there were moments when, as the saying goes, I jumped in my skin for terror. Something must speedily be resolved upon, and it occurred to us at last to go forth together and seek help in the neighbouring hamlet. No sooner said than done. Bare-headed as we were, we ran out at once in the gathering evening and the frosty fog.|$|R
