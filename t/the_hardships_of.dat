5|$|Gomułka, in {{his public}} speeches, criticized <b>the</b> <b>hardships</b> <b>of</b> Stalinism and promised reforms to democratize the country; this was {{received}} with much enthusiasm by Polish society. By mid-November, Gomułka had secured substantive gains in his {{negotiations with the}} Soviets: the cancellation of Poland's existing debts, new preferential trade terms, abandonment of the unpopular Soviet-imposed collectivization of Polish agriculture, and permission to liberalize policy towards the Roman Catholic Church. In December, the status of Soviet forces in Poland, the Northern Group of Forces, was finally regulated.|$|E

5|$|The Ottomans {{had great}} {{diplomatic}} skill {{and ability to}} raise vast numbers of troops. Initially, their raiding gave them great support from other Turks near Osman's small domain. In time however, as the Turks began to settle in land poorly defended by the Byzantines, {{they were able to}} exploit <b>the</b> <b>hardships</b> <b>of</b> the peasant classes by recruiting their aid. Those that did not assist the Ottomans were raided themselves. Eventually, the cities in Asia Minor, cut off from the outside surrendered and the Ottomans soon mastered the art of siege warfare.|$|E
5|$|In 1948, Shostakovich {{acquired}} {{a book of}} Jewish folk songs, and from this he composed the song cycle From Jewish Folk Poetry. He initially wrote eight songs that were meant to represent <b>the</b> <b>hardships</b> <b>of</b> being Jewish in the Soviet Union. However in order to disguise this, Shostakovich ended up adding three more songs meant to demonstrate the great life Jews had under the Soviet regime. Despite his efforts to hide the real meaning in the work, the Union of Composers refused to approve his music in 1949 {{under the pressure of}} the anti-Semitism that gripped the country. From Jewish Folk Poetry could not be performed until after Stalin’s death in March 1953, along with all the other works that were forbidden.|$|E
5|$|The early Baroque period {{produced}} {{a number of}} noted poets. Sebastian Grabowiecki wrote metaphysical and mystical religious poetry representing the passive current of Quietism. Another szlachta poet Samuel Twardowski participated in military and other historic events; among the genres he pursued was epic poetry. Urban poetry was quite vital {{until the middle of}} the 17th century; the plebeian poets criticized the existing social order and continued within the ambiance of elements of the Renaissance style. The creations of John of Kijany contained a hearty dose of social radicalism. The moralist Sebastian Klonowic wrote a symbolic poem Flis using the setting of Vistula river craft floating work. Szymon Szymonowic in his Pastorals portrayed, without embellishments, <b>the</b> <b>hardships</b> <b>of</b> serf life. Maciej Sarbiewski, a Jesuit, was highly appreciated throughout Europe for the Latin poetry he wrote.|$|E

5|$|Until 1996, the {{domestic}} situation during Unas' reign {{was thought to}} have been disastrous, based on reliefs from the causeway of his pyramid complex showing emaciated people and thus suggesting times of famine. This changed when excavations at Abusir in 1996 yielded similar reliefs in the mortuary complex of Sahure, who reigned at a prosperous time in the early Fifth Dynasty. In addition, research showed that the starving people are likely to be desert dwellers, nomads distinguished by their specific hair-style, rather than Egyptians. Thus, these reliefs are now understood to be standard representations of the generosity of the king towards the destitute and of <b>the</b> <b>hardships</b> <b>of</b> life in the desert regions bordering Egypt rather than referring to actual events.|$|E
5|$|At {{this point}} Tom Loker {{returns to the}} story. Loker has changed {{as the result of}} being healed by the Quakers. George, Eliza, and Harry have also {{obtained}} their freedom after crossing into Canada. In Louisiana, Uncle Tom almost succumbs to hopelessness as his faith in God is tested by <b>the</b> <b>hardships</b> <b>of</b> the plantation. However, he has two visions, one of Jesus and one of Eva, which renew his resolve to remain a faithful Christian, even unto death. He encourages Cassy to escape, which she does, taking Emmeline with her. When Tom refuses to tell Legree where Cassy and Emmeline have gone, Legree orders his overseers to kill Tom. As Tom is dying, he forgives the overseers who savagely beat him. Humbled by the character of the man they have killed, both men become Christians. Very shortly before Tom's death, George Shelby (Arthur Shelby's son) arrives to buy Tom's freedom but finds he is too late.|$|E
5|$|In 1820, Champollion {{embarked}} {{in earnest}} {{on the project}} of decipherment of hieroglyphic script, soon overshadowing the achievements of British polymath Thomas Young {{who had made the}} first advances in decipherment before 1819. In 1822, Champollion published his first breakthrough in the decipherment of the Rosetta hieroglyphs, showing that the Egyptian writing system was a combination of phonetic and ideographic signs – the first such script discovered. In 1824, he published a Précis in which he detailed a decipherment of the hieroglyphic script demonstrating the values of its phonetic and ideographic signs. In 1829 he traveled to Egypt where he was able to read many hieroglyphic texts that had never before been studied, and brought home a large body of new drawings of hieroglyphic inscriptions. Home again he was given a professorship in egyptology, but only lectured a few times before his health, ruined by <b>the</b> <b>hardships</b> <b>of</b> the Egyptian journey, forced him to give up teaching. He died in Paris in 1832, 41 years old. His grammar of Ancient Egyptian was published posthumously.|$|E

5|$|In North Indian manuscripts of the Ramayana, some interpolations {{elaborate}} Tara's lament. Tara mentions <b>the</b> <b>hardships</b> <b>of</b> widowhood and prefers {{death to}} it. She blames Rama for unjustly killing Vali {{and tells him}} {{that if they had}} forged an alliance, Vali could have helped him recover Sita. Tara invokes the power of her chastity and curses Rama so that he will soon lose Sita after he regains her. She declares that Sita will return to the earth. The curse also appears in the North-western Indian manuscripts. In several vernacular adaptations of the Ramayana like the Oriya Vilanka Ramayana by Sarala Dasa, Tara's curse is reiterated. Apart from the usual curse to Rama of his separation from Sita, in the Bengali Krittivasi Ramayana, Tara additionally curses Rama that in his next birth, he will be killed by Vali. The Mahanataka and the Ananda Ramayana narrate that Vali is reborn as the hunter who kills Krishna, Rama's next birth.|$|E
5|$|The Russian {{invasion}} and occupation caused additional hardships. By {{the end of}} Russian occupation in 1721, {{a third of the}} Finnish human populace as well as large numbers of horses were lost to war and epidemic diseases. Furthermore, a great number of horses were exported to Russia during the invasion at the command of PeterI. Horses removed from Finland ended up mainly in the area of Vyatka government, and some Russian researchers such as Simanov and Moerder have suggested that the Vyatka horse was developed mainly from Estonian and Finnish bloodlines. In addition to <b>the</b> <b>hardships</b> <b>of</b> war and occupation, the treaties of Nystad in 1721 and Åbo in 1743 ceded Finnish territory to Russia, which resulted in much of the Finnish horse population being left behind the new borders. The Finnish horses in these now-Russian areas were crossbred with the Russian horses in significant numbers.|$|E
5|$|The {{reasons for}} the {{execution}} of Joachim III, who had previously saved Theodore Svetoslav from Byzantine captivity, are not entirely clear. Historians Ivan Bozhilov and Vasil Gyuzelev speculate that the Patriarch was among the responsible dignitaries for a Mongol invasion in 1285, after which Theodore Svetoslav had to be sent a hostage in the Golden Horde. John Van Antwerp Fine Jr. suggests that the alleged treachery might {{be linked to the}} obscure period when Smilets overthrew George Terter I. Others believe that the verdict was a result of the desire of the new emperor to seek personal retribution from those who he deemed responsible for <b>the</b> <b>hardships</b> <b>of</b> his youth. However, most agree that the actions of Theodore Svetoslav consolidated the shaken imperial authority and paved the way for his long and successful reign. Bulgaria prospered between 1300 and 1321; the Mongol interference was dealt with and the country even regained Bessarabia from the Golden Horde.|$|E
