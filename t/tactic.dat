5|$|A lull {{probably}} occurred {{early in}} the afternoon, and a break for rest and food {{would probably have been}} needed. William may have also needed time to implement a new strategy, which may have been inspired by the English pursuit and subsequent rout by the Normans. If the Normans could send their cavalry against the shield wall and then draw the English into more pursuits, breaks in the English line might form. William of Poitiers says the <b>tactic</b> was used twice. Although arguments have been made that the chroniclers' accounts of this <b>tactic</b> were meant to excuse the flight of the Norman troops from battle, this is unlikely as the earlier flight was not glossed over. It was a <b>tactic</b> used by other Norman armies during the period. Some historians have argued that the story of the use of feigned flight as a deliberate <b>tactic</b> was invented after the battle; most historians agree that it was used by the Normans at Hastings.|$|E

5|$|Most social foragers must {{search for}} food while also {{avoiding}} predators. It {{has been suggested}} that individuals that play scrounger could also, by virtue of their head position, be alert for predators and hence contribute to antipredatory vigilance. If the scrounger <b>tactic</b> is compatible with antipredatory vigilance, then an increase in antipredatory vigilance should lead to the detection of more joining opportunities, and hence more joining. When stationary, the head-up <b>tactic</b> {{has been shown to be}} associated with antipredatory vigilance. However scanning while hopping does not aid in vigilance and it is thought that the scrounger <b>tactic</b> is incompatible with antipredatory vigilance in the scaly-breasted munia.|$|E

40|$|Purpose Bates' Information Search <b>Tactics</b> {{have been}} {{influential}} in the practice and teaching of online searching since they were published in 1979. This article is about using information search <b>tactics</b> to search the Internet, and presents a set of <b>tactics</b> useful in the practice and teaching of Internet searching. Design/methodology/approach <b>Tactics</b> used on the Internet were gathered from the literature, websites, and the author's experience of Internet searching. These were compared with the Information Search <b>Tactics,</b> and refined into a set of Internet Search <b>Tactics.</b> Findings The article presents 34 Internet Search Tactics: 18 of the original Bates <b>tactics,</b> interpreted {{in the context of}} the Internet, and 16 new <b>tactics.</b> While many of the information search <b>tactics</b> are relevant, effective Internet searching requires recognition of the role of relevancy ranking and full text searching in search engines. The uncontrolled nature of the Internet means that evaluation of information resources is an integral part of Internet searching, so a group of evaluation <b>tactics</b> have been proposed. Practical implications The <b>tactics</b> provide a framework for teaching effective Internet searching. Originality/value Bates' information search <b>tactics</b> do not appear to have been applied as a whole to searching the Internet. The proposed <b>tactics</b> will be useful for librarians and researchers who need to carry out effective searching on the Internet, and for information literacy education.

Marseille persisted, and created a unique self-training programme for himself, both physical and tactical, which resulted not just in outstanding situational awareness, marksmanship and confident control of the aircraft, but also in a unique attack <b>tactic</b> that preferred a high angle deflection shooting attack and shooting at the target's front from the side, instead of the common method of chasing an aircraft and shooting at it directly from behind. Marseille often practiced these tactics {{on the way back}} from missions with his comrades. Marseille became known as a master of deflection shooting.|$|E
5|$|In {{line with}} this geopolitical perspective, Pablo {{argued that the}} only way the Trotskyists could avoid {{isolation}} was for various sections of the Fourth International to undertake long-term entryism in the mass Communist or Social Democratic parties. This <b>tactic</b> was known as entrism sui generis, to distinguish it from the short-term entry <b>tactic</b> employed before World War II. For example, it meant that the project of building an open and independent Trotskyist party was shelved in France, because it was regarded as not politically feasible alongside entry into the French Communist Party.|$|E

When the expected stable frequency of the scrounger <b>tactic</b> was altered by changing the availability of seeds, the relative frequency of hopping with the head up changed accordingly. When the seed distribution made the scrounger <b>tactic</b> unprofitable, the frequency of hopping with the head up diminished and appears to support the predictions of the producer-scrounger model.|$|E

5|$|The {{revival of}} ramming had a {{significant}} effect on naval tactics. Since the 17th century the predominant <b>tactic</b> of naval warfare had been the line of battle, where a fleet formed a long line to give it the best fire from its broadside guns. This <b>tactic</b> was totally unsuited to ramming, and the ram threw fleet tactics into disarray. The question of how an ironclad fleet should deploy in battle to make best use of the ram was never tested in battle, and if it had been, combat might have shown that rams could only be used against ships which were already stopped dead in the water.|$|E

Fraser sought the backing of the retired longtime Liberal Prime Minister, Sir Robert Menzies, and went to see Menzies in person, taking with him a 1947 statement by Menzies supporting the blocking of supply in the upper house of the Victorian Parliament. He did not have to use the paper; Menzies stated that he found the <b>tactic</b> distasteful, but in this case necessary.
