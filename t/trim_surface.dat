40|$|In {{the shape}} {{modeling}} with 3 D CAD systems, the <b>trimmed</b> <b>surface</b> is quite popular. For instance, Japanese Industrial Standards (JIS) models contain {{a lot of}} notches, expressed using <b>trimmed</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Since <b>trimmed</b> <b>surfaces</b> are directly modified in direct modeling, it has a big restriction in the shape modification. It is effective to apply a new free-form surface to a closed region composed of the modified edges because the consistency of a <b>trimmed</b> <b>surface</b> can be maintained. This paper proposes the method of fitting a free-form surface by using the offset curve. To be more concrete, an offset curve is generated according to the tangent planes and a point cloud is generated. After that, a B-spline surface is generated using the generated point clouds and the boundary curves, so that a new <b>trimmed</b> <b>surface</b> is generated. Our method is effective for direct modeling that directly modifies the boundary edges of the <b>trimmed</b> <b>surface</b> representing a notch shape...|$|R

40|$|Geometric {{modeling}} of complex objects {{is a difficult}} task. Free-form deformation (FFD) is {{a powerful tool for}} modeling complex objects. However, using FFD is sometimes difficult. In this thesis, FFD for parametric <b>trimmed</b> <b>surfaces</b> is presented. This method uses NURBS FFD to modify the shape of parametric <b>trimmed</b> <b>surfaces.</b> A feature-based FFD method is presented for 3 D Garment CAD application. Trimmed surface development is primarily used for flattening a 3 D surface into a corresponding 2 D pattern or surface. This thesis presents a general method for parametric <b>trimmed</b> <b>surface</b> development. This method can be applied in computer aided design, texture mapping, ship building, etc. First, the surface is triangulated and mapped onto a plane. This initial planar mapping has the same topology as its original surface. Then, a spring-mass system is applied to deform the initial planar mapping. The resulting surface elastic deformation energy distribution is indicated by a color graph, which determines a surface cutting line. The method presented in this thesis can efficiently solve development problems for complex <b>trimmed</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Accuracy of a developed surface can easily be controlled locally. Thus, compared to earlier methods, this method provides more flexibility for solving CAD and CAM surface problems. As a prior step to surface free-form deformation and surface development, an improved <b>trimmed</b> <b>surface</b> triangulation method is also presented. The algorithm first constructs triangles in parametric space, then adjusts the shapes of triangles in model space. As a result, the algorithm guarantees a good triangular mesh in model space...|$|R

Three different strategies are proposed to adjust, with greater or lesser accuracy, the trimmed FE mesh to the <b>trimming</b> <b>surface.</b> The first consists only of an element elimination strategy, while the other two are based on a nodal stretching strategy, aiming for more accurate adjustment of the finite elements boundary to the <b>trimming</b> <b>surface.</b> Finally, to highlight the capabilities of the developed program, a mesh generation example is given by trimming a mesh with the shape of a blank automotive panel.

40|$|Deformable objects {{can be used}} {{to model}} soft objects such as clothing, human faces and animal characters. They are {{important}} as they can improve the realism of the applications. However, most existing hardware accelerators cannot render deformable objects directly. A tessellation process is often used to convert a deformable object into polygons so that the hardware graphics accelerator may render them. Unfortunately, this tessellation process is computationally very expensive. While the object is deforming, the tessellation process needs to be performed repeatedly to convert the deforming objects into polygons. As a result, deformable objects are seldom used in real-time applications such as virtual environments and computer games. Since <b>trimmed</b> NURBS <b>surfaces</b> are often used to represent deformable objects, in this paper we present an efficient method for incremental rendering of deformable <b>trimmed</b> NURBS <b>surfaces.</b> A <b>trimmed</b> NURBS <b>surface</b> typically deforms through the deformation of the <b>trimmed</b> NURBS <b>surface</b> and/or the <b>trimming</b> curve. Our method handles both <b>trimmed</b> <b>surface</b> deformation as well as trimming curve deformation. Experimental results show that our method performs significantly faster than the method used in OpenGL and can be used in real-time applications, such as computer games...|$|R
40|$|Topologically {{consistent}} algorithms for {{the intersection}} and trimming of free-form parametric surfaces are of fundamental importance in computer-aided design, analysis, and manufacturing. Since {{the intersection of}} (for example) two bicubic tensor-product surface patches is not a rational curve, it is usually described by approximations in the parameter domain of each surface. If these approximations are employed as “trim curves”, their images in R 3 do not agree precisely, and the resulting <b>trimmed</b> <b>surfaces</b> may exhibit “gaps ” and “overlaps ” along their common edge, an artifact that often incurs failure of downstream applications. We present a direct and simple approach to the problem, wherein the intersection curve is described explicitly by the sides of a sequence of triangular Bézier patches. Instead of representing <b>trimmed</b> <b>surfaces</b> by <b>trim</b> curves in the surface parameter domain, together with appropriate control point perturbations to guarantee consistency, we use triangular patches to directly approximate the intersection curve and the <b>trimmed</b> <b>surfaces</b> it defines. The triangular patches are constructed so as to maintain smooth (i. e., tangent-plane continuous) connections to untrimmed patches of the original surface. We assume that the original intersecting surfaces are subject t...|$|R
40|$|Most of {{the work}} {{accomplished}} on surface blending is based on visual trimming. In the process of visual trimming, the unwanted portion of a surface is only hidden but not removed. Geometric trimming provides a complete mathematical description of the wanted portion of the <b>trimming</b> <b>surface,</b> and generates a new mathematical surface or sets of surface patches. The new surface is intended to resemble closely the corresponding portion of the original surface. A robust procedure is developed to geometrically <b>trim</b> the intersecting <b>surfaces</b> and blend the <b>trimmed</b> <b>surface</b> patches into one new surface. This research generates a filleting algorithm for surface blending of an aircraft fuselage shape and a wing shape at a closed trimming intersection curve, and verifies {{the properties of the}} newly created surface.

40|$|In {{the process}} of CAD/CAM, {{predefined}} parametric surfaces are often subject to the operation of trimming or extending. In such a case, the original iso-parametric curves are no longer boundary-conformed. Consequently, they are not anymore suitable for being used as natural CNC toolpaths. In this paper a method to regenerate boundary-conformed iso-parametric toolpaths on altered free-form surfaces is presented. The main idea of this method is to fit the 2 D parametric domain of the given <b>trimmed</b> <b>surface</b> with a 2 D Coons patch. Then boundary-conformed toolpaths on the altered surface can be regenerated naturally via the iso-parametric curves of the Coons patch via a two-step mapping.

We will describe an automatic manner to specify internal cubic Bezier-spline curves that are to be subsequently interpolated by a Gordon patch. Some theoretical criterion pertaining to the control points of the internal curves is proposed and proved so as to ensure that the resulting Gordon patch is a diffeomorphism.

40|$|Generating optimal NC code {{to drive}} milling {{machines}} for models defined by freeform <b>trimmed</b> <b>surfaces</b> {{is a difficult}} problem. In practice, Two main approaches are used to generate toolpaths for surfaces, neither of which is optimal, in general. The first exploits the parametric representation and generates isocurves that are uniformly distributed across the parametric domain. This approach is not optimal if the surface mapping into Euclidean space is not isometric. The second approach contours the models by intersecting the surfaces with planes equally spaced in Euclidean space, resulting in a piecewise linear toolpath approximation which is nonadaptive to the local surface geometry. Furthermore, the toolpath generated by contouring is suitable for 3 axis milling but is inappropriate for 5 axis milling.
