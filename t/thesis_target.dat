40|$|Continued device scaling allows {{faster and}} more complex CPUs but comes {{at the cost of}} an {{increase}} in the likelihood of CPU failures. This thesis address this worsening problem at the architectural level; proposing and evaluating three microarchitectures designed to compensate for increasing failure rates. The first microarchitecture discussed in this <b>thesis</b> <b>targets</b> defects that are evident immediately after fabrication or arise during burn-in. Conventionally, CPUs with such defects are destroyed leading to reduced yield and reduced profitability. This thesis proposes a superscalar architecture that allows defects to be isolated to architectural components (within a single CPU core) that can be disabled, leaving a functionally-correct CPU and increasing yield. ^ The second microarchitecture proposed in this <b>thesis</b> <b>targets</b> failures that arise in the field. In this microarchitecture I augment current Simultaneous Multi-Threading (SMT) hardware to redundantly execute instructions on different microarchitectural structures within the same CPU core. Thus this microarchitecture constantly monitors for failures, allowing defects to be detected as soon as they arise. ^ The third microarchitecture proposed in this <b>thesis</b> also <b>targets</b> failures that arise in the field but trades-off some detection latency to significantly reduce the energy and performance cost of redundancy-based detection. In this microarchitecture I propose area-efficient architectural support that allows high-coverage testing phases to be transparently interleaved with computation in the field. ...|$|R

The standard mixed sensitivity problem is considered with time delayed continuous time processes. Using the duality between control and ltering methods, the H∞ control problem {{is converted to}} H∞ filtering problem and a new H∞ optimal filtering approach is proposed. To investigate state estimation for target tracking, a typi cal vehicle model moving in 1 -D is used but the proposed method can be expanded for movements in 3 -D. Delay in both process and measurement is considered. The estimation of the states and their performances are analyzed under different scenarios including change in delay, input pattern, noise parameters etc. The results obtained by proposed H∞ optimal filtering are compared with the results obtained by H 2 filter and simulation results are shown. by Ezgi Ateş.

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} is to show the feasibility of detecting density variations in greenstate powder metallurgy (P/M) compacts from surface voltage measurements. By monitoring a steady electric current flow through the sample and recording the voltages over the surface, valuable information is gathered leading to the prediction of the structural health of the compacts. Unlike prior research that concentrated on the detection of surface-breaking and subsurface defects, the results presented in this <b>thesis</b> <b>target</b> the density prediction throughout the volume of the sample. The detection of density variations is achieved by establishing a correlation between the conductivity and their respective density. The data obtained from the surface measurements is used as part of an inversion algorithm, calculating the conductivity distribution, and subsequently the density within the compact. In a first step, the relationship between conductivity and density of green-state P/M compacts was investigated. Tests were conducted for a number of parts of various powder mixtures. In all cases a clear correlation between conductivity and density could be established, indicatin...|$|E
