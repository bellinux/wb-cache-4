5|$|Over one {{thousand}} artists and technicians {{were used in}} the making of Fantasia, which features more than 500 animated characters. Segments were color-keyed scene by scene so the colors in a single shot would harmonize between proceeding and following ones.

The studio's character model department would also sculpt three-dimensional clay models so the animators could view their subject from all angles.|$|E
5|$|Pennant's first {{publications}} were scientific {{papers on}} the earthquake he had experienced, other geological subjects and palaeontology.

Pennant felt very honoured by this and continued <b>to</b> <b>correspond</b> <b>with</b> Linnaeus throughout his life.|$|E
5|$|A {{version for}} the PlayStation Portable, {{developed}} by SuperVillain Studios, {{was released in}} March 2008. The company coded it from scratch, as the PlayStation 3 version's code and art were too platform-specific to reuse. The add-on pack for the PlayStation 3 version was also developed by SuperVillain. Thatgamecompany {{was not involved in}} the development of either project beyond a design influence and art direction role, as they were creating their next title, Flower. Sony Santa Monica created ports of the PlayStation 3 game for the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita, which were published in November 2013 <b>to</b> <b>correspond</b> <b>with</b> the release of the PlayStation 4. Although no album of music specifically for Flow has been released, in 2012 Austin Wintory released Journey Bonus Bundle as a download-only album on Bandcamp, containing variations on themes from Flow and Journey, a 2012 PlayStation 3 game by Thatgamecompany.|$|E

5|$|After hatching, the {{offspring}} {{feed on the}} tissue of the cicadas provided by their mother. Males emerge before females and both genders are sexually receptive from emergence in July to early August, when they mate and brood. English naturalist Charles Darwin postulated that the pattern of male emergence before females evolved by natural selection to improve the chances of the male mating. The timing {{of the emergence of}} females has evolved <b>to</b> <b>correspond</b> <b>with</b> the similar emergence of the cicada species of the area, Tibicen duryi and T.parallela, which they hunt for the provisioning of their nests. Many have yellow markings located on their tergites (dorsal portion), although some have been found only from the first to fifth tergites.|$|E
5|$|After the council, Cuthbert {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>correspond</b> <b>with</b> Boniface {{up until}} Boniface's martyrdom in 754, {{and then sent}} condolences to Boniface's successor. Cuthbert held a second synod in 758, but nothing is known of any enactments it made. He also built the church of St. John the Baptist in Canterbury, which was destroyed by fire in 1067. He was buried in his new church. The new church was located {{on the west side}} of the cathedral, and was used as a baptistery. The church also became a burial site for many of the archbishops, and later was used for trials by ordeal. There is no explicit contemporary reference that states that these uses were intended by Cuthbert, but the fact that the church was dedicated to St. John the Baptist argues strongly that Cuthbert at least intended the new building as a baptistery.|$|E
5|$|An {{accomplished}} woman, Finch gained {{her appointment}} as royal governess in August 1762 upon {{the birth of}} George, Prince of Wales, the eldest son of King George and Queen Charlotte.

Finch oversaw the princes' education until they became old enough to live in their own households under the watch of governors, while the six princesses remained under her supervision until they turned 21. Finch retired from her role in 1793, though she continued <b>to</b> <b>correspond</b> <b>with</b> {{members of the royal}} family and receive gifts from them.|$|E

5|$|In 1920, Rabearivelo {{was hired}} as an {{assistant}} librarian at the Cercle de l'Union social club. That same year he drafted his first book, a short novel written in the Malagasy language. He began <b>to</b> <b>correspond</b> <b>with</b> {{a wide range of}} writers around the world, including André Gide, Paul Valéry, Jean Amrouche, Paul Claudel, and Valery Larbaud, and spent large sums to buy books and ship them to Madagascar. By these means he amassed a diverse collection that constituted the richest library on the island. In 1924 he {{took a job as a}} proofreader at the publishing house Imprimerie de l'Imerina, a position he would continue to occupy for the rest of his life. In 1921 he befriended high-level French colonial bureaucrats who shared his passion for French literature, including Robert Boudry, the colony's financial manager, and Pierre Camo, Madagascar's postal magistrate and founder of the literary magazine 18° Latitude Sud.|$|E
5|$|In February 1897, he {{was sentenced}} without trial to three years' exile in eastern Siberia. He was granted {{a few days in}} Saint Petersburg to put his affairs in order and used this time to meet with the Social-Democrats, who had renamed {{themselves}} the League of Struggle for the Emancipation of the Working Class. His journey to eastern Siberia took 11 weeks, for much of which he was accompanied by his mother and sisters. Deemed only a minor threat to the government, he was exiled to a peasant's hut in Shushenskoye, Minusinsky District, where he was kept under police surveillance; he was nevertheless able <b>to</b> <b>correspond</b> <b>with</b> other revolutionaries, many of whom visited him, and permitted to go on trips to swim in the Yenisei River and to hunt duck and snipe.|$|E
5|$|A {{maritime}} route {{opened up}} with the Chinese-controlled port of Rinan in Jiaozhi (centred in modern Vietnam) and the Khmer kingdom of Funan by the 2nd century AD, if not earlier. Jiaozhi was proposed by Ferdinand von Richthofen in 1877 {{to have been the}} port known to the Greco-Roman geographer Ptolemy as Cattigara, situated near modern Hanoi. Ptolemy wrote that Cattigara lay beyond the Golden Chersonese (the Malay Peninsula) and was visited by a Greek sailor named Alexander, most likely a merchant. Richthofen's identification of Cattigara as Hanoi was widely accepted until archaeological discoveries at Óc Eo (near Ho Chi Minh City) in the Mekong Delta during the mid-20th century suggested this may have been its location. Granville Allen Mawer states that Ptolemy's Cattigara seems <b>to</b> <b>correspond</b> <b>with</b> the latitude of modern Óc Eo, where Roman goods and native jewellery imitating Antonine Roman coins have been found. At Óc Eo, which was once located along the coastline, Roman coins were among the vestiges of long-distance trade discovered by the French archaeologist Louis Malleret in the 1940s. These include Roman golden medallions from the reigns of Antoninus Pius and his successor Marcus Aurelius. Ancient Roman glass beads and bracelets were also found at the site.|$|E

5|$|A novella {{by author}} Brandon Sanderson was {{released}} prior to both Infinity Blade II and III {{to serve as}} a story bridge between the games. Infinity Blade: Awakening was released as an e-book on October 4, 2011 <b>to</b> <b>correspond</b> <b>with</b> the announcement of Infinity Blade II. The story gives the protagonist of the first game a name, Siris, introduces the idea that the God King was one of multiple Deathless in the world, as is Siris, and has Siris and the assassin Isa journey to find the Worker of Secrets in order to kill the resurrected God King and the other Deathless. The second e-book novella, Infinity Blade: Redemption, was released on September 9, 2013 just prior to the third game. In it, Siris and the God King escape from their imprisonment by the Worker of Secrets, while extensive flashbacks show the rise of the Deathless in a future-Earth analogue. While Siris disrupts the Worker of Secret's plans, the God King confronts and is killed by the Worker.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{airlines}} {{interested in a}} takeover of Virgin America approached the airline in late 2015, prompting Virgin America <b>to</b> <b>correspond</b> <b>with</b> an undisclosed financial adviser about how and if to proceed with a sale. Alaska Air Group and JetBlue Airways were the two most interested companies to make offers to purchase the airline from Virgin Group. In December 2015, Alaska was interested at $44.75 per share, before JetBlue manifested its interest in February 2016. A bidding war ensued culminating on March 31 and April 1 at $57 per share, % higher than the day's closure at $38.9. On April 4, 2016, Alaska Air Group announced that it had agreed to buy Virgin America for $2.6 billion. Including debt and aircraft leases, the transaction was worth approximately $4 billion. Had the merger agreement been terminated by Virgin America, {{they would have been}} contractually obligated to pay Alaska Air Group a termination fee equal to $78.5 million.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland {{entered the}} White House as a bachelor, {{and his sister}} Rose Cleveland joined him, to act as hostess {{for the first two}} years of his administration. However, unlike the {{previous}} bachelor president James Buchanan, Cleveland did not remain a bachelor for very long. In 1885 the daughter of Cleveland's friend Oscar Folsom visited him in Washington. Frances Folsom was a student at Wells College. When she returned to school, President Cleveland received her mother's permission <b>to</b> <b>correspond</b> <b>with</b> her, and they were soon engaged to be married. On June 2, 1886, Cleveland married Frances Folsom in the Blue Room at the White House. He was the second President to wed while in office, and has been the only President married in the White House. This marriage was unusual, since Cleveland was the executor of Oscar Folsom's estate and had supervised Frances's upbringing after her father's death; nevertheless, the public took no exception to the match. At 21 years, Frances Folsom Cleveland was the youngest First Lady in history, and the public soon warmed to her beauty and warm personality.|$|E
