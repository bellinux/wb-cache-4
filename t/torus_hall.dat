5000|$|The JET {{facilities}} are situated on a former Navy airfield near Culham, Oxfordshire - RNAS Culham (HMS Hornbill), in the UK. They are located alongside Culham Centre for Fusion Energy (the UK's fusion research laboratory, {{which opened in}} 1965). The construction of the buildings which house the project was undertaken by Tarmac Construction, starting in 1978 with the <b>Torus</b> <b>Hall</b> being completed in January 1982. Construction of the JET machine itself began immediately {{after the completion of}} the <b>Torus</b> <b>Hall,</b> with the first plasma experiments in 1983. The cost was 198.8 Million European Units of Account (predecessor to the Euro) or 438 million in 2014 US dollars.|$|E
40|$|The {{stellarator}} device Wendelstein 7 -X (W 7 -X) {{is now in}} {{the final}} stage of assembly. All the machine components have been built and in mid 2014 the commissioning activities should start. The first objective of W 7 -X is to prove the stellarator optimization principles, i. e., to reach at least the same confinement quality as a similar sized tokamak. The second objective is to demonstrate stable high-power steady-state operation. In the present paper, after a short description of the device, the ongoing activities to complete the construction will be summarized, focusing on the optimization of the layout of the <b>torus</b> <b>hall</b> and on the completion and assembly of the in-vessel components. The main lessons learned during the assembly will be presented as well as the application of the quality control, the handling of non-conformities and the design change procedures. The planning of the commissioning sequences to perform the integral tests of the major W 7 -X systems is discussed in order to prepare the W 7 -X device to start plasma operation...|$|E
40|$|A new {{prototype}} of a single-crystal diamond detector {{has been tested}} at JET for measurements of DD and DT neutrons. The detector was installed in the JET <b>torus</b> <b>hall</b> on a collimated line of sight, which is shared with other neutron diagnostics, the MPRu neutron spectrometer and the NE 213 scintillator. The results of the first measurements in the JET campaign C 31 are presented in this paper. The measurements exploited {{for the first time}} the possibility of performing good resolution spectroscopy measurements of 2. 5 and 14 MeV neutrons using fast charge preamplifier combined to a digital acquisition system. The prototype detector has been developed for operation at very high cont rate applications, such as the one expected from high power DT plasmas. A distinction should be made in the neutron detection between neutrons of energy below and above 6 MeV. The 2. 5 MeV neutrons from DD reactions, which are measured using elastic scattering on carbon nuclei, provide small amplitude signals and require a dedicated preamplification stage. This is the main component of the neutron energy spectrum in JET deuterium plasmas. Neutron spectrometry of 14 MeV DT neutrons is possible via the 12 C(n,a) 9 Be. Preliminary measurements of the 2. 5 MeV neutron emission and of the 14 MeV triton burn-up neutrons, which represents about 1 / 100 of the neutrons in JET deuterium plasmas, are presented...|$|E
40|$|Monte Carlo {{is one of}} {{the most}} useful methods to study the quantum Hall problems. In this paper, we {{introduce}} a fast lattice Monte Carlo method based on a mathematically exact reformulation of the <b>torus</b> quantum <b>Hall</b> problems from continuum to lattice. We first apply this new technique to study the Berry phase of transporting composite fermions along different closed paths enclosing or not enclosing the Fermi surface center in the half filled Landau level problem. The Monte Carlo result agrees with the phase structure we found on small systems and confirms it on much larger sizes. Several other quantities including the Coulomb energy in different Landau levels, structure factor, particle-hole symmetry are computed and discussed for various model states. In the end, based on certain knowledge of structure factor, we introduce a algorithm by which the lattice Monte Carlo efficiency is further boosted by several orders...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} spin-polarized {{electrons in}} a single Landau level on a <b>torus.</b> The quantum <b>Hall</b> problem is mapped onto a one-dimensional lattice model with lattice constant 2 π/L_ 1, where L_ 1 is a circumference of the torus (in units of the magnetic length). In the Tao-Thouless limit, L_ 1 → 0, the interacting many-electron problem is exactly diagonalized at any rational filling factor ν=p/q< 1. For odd q, the ground state has the same qualitative properties as a bulk (L_ 1 →∞) quantum Hall hierarchy state and the lowest energy quasiparticle exitations have the same fractional charges as in the bulk. These states are the L_ 1 → 0 limits of the Laughlin/Jain wave functions for filling fractions where these exist. We argue that the exact solutions generically, for odd q, are continuously connected to the two-dimensional bulk quantum Hall hierarchy states, ie {{that there is no}} phase transition as L_ 1 →∞ for filling factors where such states can be observed. For even denominator fractions, a phase transition occurs as L_ 1 increases. For ν= 1 / 2 this leads to the system being mapped onto a Luttinger liquid of neutral particles at small but finite L_ 1, this then develops continuously into the composite fermion wave function that is believed to describe the bulk ν= 1 / 2 system. The analysis generalizes to non-abelian quantum Hall states. Comment: 25 pages, 9 figure...|$|R
40|$|Thermoluminescence {{detectors}} (TLD) {{were used}} for dose measurements at JET. Several hundreds of LiF detectors of various types, standard LiF:Mg,Ti and highly sensitive LiF:Mg,Cu,P were produced. LiF detectors consisting of natural lithium are sensitive to slow neutrons, their response to neutrons being enhanced by 6 Li-enriched lithium or suppressed by using lithium consisting entirely of 7 Li. Pairs of 6 LiF/ 7 LiF detectors allow distinguishing between neutron/non-neutron components of a radiation field. For detection of neutrons of higher energy, polyethylene (PE- 300) moderators were used. TLDs, located in the centre of cylindrical moderators, were installed at eleven positions in the JET hall and the hall labyrinth in July 2012, and exposure {{took place during the}} last two weeks of the experimental campaign. Measurements of the gamma dose were obtained for all positions over a range of about five orders of magnitude variation. As the TLDs were also calibrated in a thermal neutron field, the neutron fluence at the experimental position could be derived. The experimental results are compared with calculations using the MCNP code. The results confirm that the TLD technology can be usefully applied to measurements of neutron streaming through JET <b>Torus</b> <b>Hall</b> ducts.

40|$|In 2011 - 2012, an {{experimental}} campaign {{with a significant}} yield of fusion neutrons was carried out on the JET tokamak. During this campaign the facility was equipped with two diamond detectors based on natural and artificial CVD diamond. These detectors were designed and manufactured in State Research Center of Russian Federation TRINITI. The detectors measure the flux of fast neutrons with energies above 0. 2 MeV. They have been installed in the <b>torus</b> <b>hall</b> and {{the distance from the}} center of plasma was about 3 m. For some of the JET pulses in this experiment, the neutron flux density corresponded to the operational conditions in collimator channels of ITER Vertical Neutron Camera. The main objective of diamond monitors was the measurement of total fast neutron flux at the detector location and the estimation of the JET total neutron yield. The detectors operate as threshold counters. Additionally a spectrometric measurement channel has been configured that allowed us to distinguish various energy components of the neutron spectrum. In this paper we describe the neutron signal measuring and calibration procedure of the diamond detector. Fluxes of DD and DT neutrons at the detector location were measured. It is shown that the signals of total neutron yield measured by the diamond detector correlate with signals measured by the main JET neutron diagnostic based on fission chambers with high accuracy. This experiment can be considered as a successful test of diamond detectors in ITER-like conditions...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the three new Single Crystal Diamond (SCD) {{detectors}} installed at JET for the 2008 Restart campaign. The yields of total neutrons produced during DD plasma pulses {{as well as the}} time dependent neutron emission have been measured. The three detectors present some main new developments as for their fabrication characteristics, embeddings and electronic chains. The first detector is 200 μm thick and is embedded in paraffin. The second detector is 104 μm thick and is covered by a thermally evaporated 3 μm thick 6 LiF film in order to detect the total and the 14 -MeV neutrons. In addition, it is surrounded by a 2. 5 -cm thick polyethylene shield to enhance its thermal neutron response. The third detector is operated in an innovative way that is with a single low capacitance super-screened cable and its whole electronic chain put outside the JET <b>Torus</b> <b>Hall.</b> Furthermore it uses fast electronics, suitable to the fast diamond response pulse (< 1 ns). It is 75 μm thick, covered by a 3 μm thick 6 LiF film and surrounded by a 2. 5 -cm-thick layer of polyethylene. All the detectors have been previously tested and qualified at the ENEA-FNG with 2. 5 and 14. 7 MeV neutron beams. After the description of their main features, the results of the measurements, so far performed, are reported showing a very good matching with other standard detectors, such as fission chambers, routinely used at JET.

40|$|Since in ITER the {{radiation}} field {{will be much}} more demanding than that of present day devices, research programmes at JET are aimed at developing radiation hard diagnostics and related components. Initially, significant efforts are devoted to determining {{the radiation}} field of both the plasma and in the immediate environment with better accuracy. New developments in MCNP calculations and dedicated measurements provide useful information about the radiation field in the <b>Torus</b> <b>Hall,</b> even during non-operational periods. The effect of using Beryllium in the near future for JET first wall, is being assessed. New materials for activation samples are under consideration and will be tested to improve the calibration accuracy of JET neutron diagnostics. The long-term goal of this work is to obtain spectrometric information from an appropriate combination of different materials. Several studies are under way to modify the radiation field at the detectors by using LiH or pure water as neutron filters, to alleviate the problem of the background in gamma-ray measurements. A suite of radiation hard detectors for neutrons, magnetic field and charged particles are being developed. Super-heated fluid neutron detectors, used for yield and imaging, are being upgraded, in order to provide a broadband spectrometric capability. Chemical vapour deposited diamond diodes are being qualified as counters and as spectrometers. Prototypes of Hall probes made of InSb have been installed on the machine and have provided some preliminary results. Si-on-insulator detectors are under development for use in neutral particle analysers and are currently being bench-tested. Some attention is being devoted to optical components, fibres and mirrors, and to investigating radiation hard electronics using reconfigurable Field Programmable Gate Arrays...|$|E
40|$|The far-infrared {{polarimeter}} at JET {{is affected}} by an anomaly that makes difficult the interpretation of both Faraday and Cotton–Mouton effect measurements. The anomaly is clearly displayed during calibration operations {{in the absence of}} plasma: As the polarization of the probing beam is rotated, the phase shift of the polarimetric signal with respect to the interferometric signal is not constant, as expected, and changes significantly. It affects all the polarimetric measurement channels and has so far been removed by an empirical preprocessing of the raw data. It can be ascribed to a nonideal behavior of some optical components. Looking for a possible explanation of the anomaly, in this paper, we analyze the optical setup of the JET polari–interferometer according to the laws of classical polarization optics. At first, the optical characteristics of the recombination plates are analyzed in detail. Although they produce ellipticity in the transmitted and reflected beams, the results show that the recombination plates should not be responsible of the anomaly of the polarimeter. Then, the dielectric waveguides used to transfer the recombined beams from the <b>torus</b> <b>hall</b> to the detectors are, for the first time, considered as a possible origin of the anomaly. The anomalous behavior is expected to be mainly originated by reflections on metal mirrors, which may produce rotations of the polarization of the beams. A calculation has been performed in order to analyze the effects of a rotation of the polarization of the recombined beam on the detector signals. As a result, a rotation of the polarization along the line could explain the anomaly. We also suggest some simple and feasible tests, which are useful to give an experimental support to this conclusion, and discuss possible modifications of the optical setup to remove or greatly reduce the anomaly in future measurements...|$|E
