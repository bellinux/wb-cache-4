5|$|The fan {{diameter}} {{varies with}} the different models of the CFM56, and that change has {{a direct impact on}} the engine performance. For example, the low-pressure shaft rotates at the same speed for both the CFM56-2 and the CFM56-3 models; the fan diameter is smaller on the -3, which lowers the <b>tip</b> <b>speed</b> of the fan blades. The lower speed allows the fan blades to operate more efficiently (5.5% more in this case), which increases the overall fuel efficiency of the engine (improving specific fuel consumption nearly 3%).|$|E

Wind turbines use the reciprocal to prevent infinite values since they start stationary in a moving fluid.|$|E

The XV-1 achieved a mu (the ratio of airspeed to rotor <b>tip</b> <b>speed)</b> of 0.95.|$|E
50|$|The lower {{fan speed}} allows higher bypass ratios, leading to reduced fuel {{consumption}} and much reduced noise. The Bae 146 is fitted with geared turbofans {{and is still}} one of the quietest commercial aircraft. A large part of the noise reduction is due to reduced fan <b>tip</b> <b>speeds.</b> In conventional turbofans the fan <b>tips</b> exceed the <b>speed</b> of sound causing a characteristic drone, requiring sound deadening.

25|$|Single rotor {{helicopters}} {{are limited}} in forward speed {{by a combination of}} sonic <b>tip</b> <b>speed</b> and retreating blade stall. As the advance ratio increases, the relative velocity experienced by the retreating blade decreases so that the tip of the blade experiences zero velocity at an advance ratio of one. Helicopter rotors pitch the retreating blade to a higher angle of attack to maintain lift as the relative velocity decreases. At a sufficiently high advance ratio, the blade will reach the stalling angle of attack and experience retreating blade stall. Specially designed airfoils can increase the operating advance ratio by utilizing high lift coefficient airfoils. Currently, single rotor helicopters are practically limited to advance ratios less than 0.7.|$|E
25|$|The BAe 146 {{is powered}} by four Avco Lycoming ALF 502 {{turbofan}} engines, which are fixed on pylons underneath the aircraft's high wing. The ALF 502 {{was derived from the}} Lycoming T55 turboshaft powerplant that powers the Chinook heavy transport helicopter. Notably, the ALF 502 had a very low level of operational noise, much lower than most other competing aircraft. This was achieved largely {{through the use of a}} geared turbofan engine; the gearbox allows the fan blade <b>tip</b> <b>speed</b> to stay below the speed of sound dramatically reducing the aircraft noise. Additionally other sound deadening measures include a high bypass ratio compared to contemporary aircraft and additional sound damping layers built into the engine.|$|E

2500|$|In {{aeronautics}} {{and marine}} hydrodynamics, the advance ratio is {{the ratio of}} the freestream fluid speed to the propeller, rotor, or cyclorotor <b>tip</b> <b>speed.</b> When a propeller-driven vehicle is moving at high speed relative to the fluid, or the propeller is rotating slowly, the advance ratio of its propeller(s) is a high number; and when it is moving at low speed, or the propeller is rotating at high speed, the advance ratio is a low number. [...] The advance ratio is a useful non-dimensional velocity in helicopter and propeller theory, since propellers and rotors will experience the same angle of attack on every blade airfoil section at the same advance ratio regardless of actual forward speed.

By choosing a length scale, L, and velocity scale, U, the equation can be expressed in nondimensional form containing the Reynolds number, Re=UL/ν [...] There are two obvious differences between an insect wing and an airfoil: An insect wing is much smaller and it flaps.

The range of Reynolds number in insect flight is about 10 to 104, which lies in between the two limits that are convenient for theories: inviscid steady flows around an airfoil and Stokes flow experienced by a swimming bacterium. For this reason, this intermediate range is not well understood. On the other hand, it is perhaps the most ubiquitous regime among the things we see. Falling leaves and seeds, fishes, and birds all encounter unsteady flows similar to that seen around an insect.|$|E
