40|$|International audienceC/Ni bilayers {{of various}} layer {{thicknesses}} (20 - 40 nm) were ion bombarded using Ga + and Ni + projectiles with energies {{in the range}} of 20 - 30 keV. Ion bombardment resulted in the growth of a Ni 3 C <b>rich</b> <b>layer</b> with the following features: a. / sharp carbon / Ni 3 C <b>rich</b> <b>layer</b> interface b. / the amount of Ni 3 C produced by the irradiation proportional to the square root of the fluence and depended on the type of projectile c. / good correlation between the distribution of vacancies produced by the ion bombardment and the distribution of the Ni 3 C. The formation of the metastable Ni 3 C compound was explained by a vacancy assisted process. The sharp interface is the consequence of a relaxation process removing the intermixed Ni from the carbon layer. The square root of fluence dependence of the thickness of the Ni 3 C <b>rich</b> <b>layer</b> can be explained by a usual diffusion equation considering moving boundaries...|$|R

40|$|The pH-sensing {{properties}} of silicon nitride were studied with special emphasize on surface oxidation. Simulations {{of the surface}} potential and the sensitivity were performed using the site binding theory to show the influence of an oxygen rich surface and surface oxidation of silicon nitride. Samples were produced by depositing silicon nitride in a LPCVD process with flow ratios of the processing gases NH 3 and SiCl 2 H 2 ranging from 2 to 20. The samples were characterized by XPS and capacitance-voltage measurements of EIS-structures. Silicon nitride etched in buffered HF before measurement showed a pH-sensitivity of up to 58 mV pH- 1, and an increasing hysteresis was found with increasing NH 3 /SiCl 2 H 3 gas-flow ratios during deposition. Samples not etched had only a pH-sensitivity between 45 and 52 mV pH- 1 because of their oxygen <b>rich</b> surface <b>layer.</b> The oxygen <b>rich</b> <b>layer</b> {{was found to be}} approx. 4 nm deep and soluble in buffer electrolyte.

Stacks of two SiCx layers were deposited by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition: first a thin silicon <b>rich</b> <b>layer</b> with excellent passivating properties and then an antireflective carbon <b>rich</b> <b>layer.</b> The thickness of the passivating layer was optimized, reaching a trade-off between the better passivation achieved for thicker layers and the increased light absorption within the layer, which reduced the photocurrent.

40|$|Ferritic (FeCr) {{stainless}} steel {{is often used}} as interconnects in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) at temperatures between 650 - 850 °C. The chromia (Cr 2 O 3) scale formed upon high temperature exposure has good electron conductivity, but can be further improved by using suitable coatings. Since the electron conductivity in the Cr 2 O 3 scale is crucial for interconnects, the ability to accurately determine the distribution of elements of low concentration are highly important. Hence this study concerns Time of Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) depth profiling in a 200 nm thin Cr 2 O 3 scale formed on a Ce-coated ferritic {{stainless steel}} after exposure at 850 °C during 1 h. The aim is to investigate the effects of using different sputtering ions. Depth profiles were made using two different ToFSIMS instruments and the obtained sputter depth profiles were compared to a TEM-EDX map of the scale cross section. In the IONTOF TOF-SIMS V instrument C 60 + at 10 keV and 700 pA was used for sputtering and Bi 3 + at 25 keV and 0. 15 pA was used for analysis. In the PHI TRIFT II instrument a pulsed Liquid Metal Ion Gun (LMIG) with 69 Ga+ at 15 keV and 600 pA was used. In both instruments depth profiles were obtained by sputtering a surface area of 50 x 50 μm 2 and analyzing an area of 25 x 25 μm 2. Furthermore, the effect of having oxygen present in the chamber to a pressure of 1 x 10 - 6 torr during analysis in the PHI TRIFT II instrument was investigated. The {{results showed that the}} oxide scale was composed of two equally thick layers, an outer Cr/Mn <b>rich</b> <b>layer</b> (100 nm) and an inner Cr <b>rich</b> <b>layer</b> (100 nm). The Ce from the surface coating was observed between those two layers. Additionally, a thin layer (~ 10 nm) rich in Fe/Mn was observed at the outermost oxide surface and Ti was observed in the inner Cr <b>rich</b> <b>layer.</b> The depth profiles obtained by the two SIMS instruments showed similarities in the way of revealing the outer Cr/Mn <b>rich</b> <b>layer</b> and the inner <b>layer</b> <b>richer</b> in Cr as well as the outermost thin Fe/Mn <b>rich</b> <b>layer.</b> However, the Ce enrichment was more clearly revealed using the IONTOF instrument and the enrichments of Mn and Ti at the oxide/metal interface were more obvious in the PHI TRIFT II depth profile. The presence of oxygen enhanced the yield of Fe and Cr when entering the steel matrix. The sputter craters were investigated using a Zeiss ULTRA 55 Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). A topographic surface results after sputtering with 69 Ga+. The presence of oxygen in the chamber significantly decreased that topography although without enhancing the depth resolution in the profile. In the IONTOF C 60 + sputter crater a relatively smooth topography was observed. However, a large amount of carbon was deposited, which is believed to deteriorate the depth resolution when analyzing thick layers. Nevertheless, it can be concluded that C 60 +/Bi 3 + renders better depth resolution in thin layers compared to 69 Ga+, while carbon deposition from C 60 + sputtering makes 69 Ga+ a more suitable alternative for thick layers...|$|R

The overall structure treated form {{is similar to}} that of untreated native protein with an r.m.s. shift of 0.7 Å for the Cα atoms. The exposure to the interface between the aqueous layer and the upper tert-butanol <b>rich</b> <b>layer</b> was expected to cause a conformational change in the cleft. However, the structure did not indicate the opening of the lid. This is easy to understand since it is well known that interfacial activation of the lipases requires interaction of the lipase in free solution with an interface [43, 44]. In TPP treatment, the enzyme precipitates out of the solution and cannot interact with the tert-butanol <b>rich</b> <b>layer</b> (unlike the enzyme in free solution). In fact, rather than opening the lid, the TPP treatment resulted in making the active site less accessible due to enhanced molecular rigidity in that region. As a result, the lid further moved closer to the segment on the opposite side thus shortening the lengths of van der Waals contacts (Table  2). The TPP treatment, involving complex interactions of the SO 4 [...]...|$|R
