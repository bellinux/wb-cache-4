5|$|After {{signing with}} WWE, Anderson made his debut on the SmackDown! roster in August 2005. In September 2006, he {{captured}} {{his first and}} only title with the company, the United States Championship, and would hold on <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> a month. The following year at WrestleMania 23, Anderson won the annual Money in the Bank ladder match, a contract, which guarantees a match for one of WWE's then three world level championships. He was fired from WWE on May 29, 2009. He returned to the independent circuit before signing a contract with TNA in 2010, which he was fired from TNA in 2016 and {{would return to the}} independent circuit for a second time. He opened a wrestling school called The Academy in Minneapolis, Minnesota in late 2016 along with Shawn Daivari, Molly Holly, Ariya Daivari, and Arik Cannon.|$|E
5|$|ESPN's Chantel Jennings tweeted {{a picture}} of a Flag of Canada redone in Michigan's team colors of maize and blue at Crisler Arena on December 4. One of her {{followers}} noted that the big version on the wall was a general Stauskas fan flag and that a little version of the flag was added next <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> each three-pointer Canadian Stauskas made in the game. By mid-December of his freshman season, the students in the Maize Rage (Michigan student section at Crisler Arena) had begun cheering Stauskas on with such a flag. The Michigan Public & Media Relations office started mentioning the flag before Christmas. The flag was mentioned widely in the press as he continued his hot shooting into January.|$|E
5|$|Games {{are played}} on a {{rectangular}} court with raised goal rings at each end. Each team attempts to score goals by passing a ball down the court and shooting it through its goal ring. Players are assigned specific positions, which define their roles within the team and restrict their movement to {{certain areas of the}} court. During general play, a player with the ball can hold on <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> only three seconds before shooting for a goal or passing to another player. The winning team is the one that scores the most goals. Netball games are 60 minutes long. Variations have been developed to increase the game's pace and appeal to a wider audience.|$|E

5|$|Morrison {{took three}} years to release a {{follow-up}} album. After a decade without taking time off, {{he said in an}} interview, he needed to get away from music completely and ceased listening <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> several months. Also suffering from writer's block, he seriously considered leaving the music business for good. Speculation that an extended jam session would be released either under the title Mechanical Bliss, or Naked in the Jungle, or Stiff Upper Lip, came to nothing, and Morrison's next album was A Period of Transition in 1977, a collaboration with Dr. John, who had appeared at The Last Waltz concert with Morrison in 1976. The album received a mild critical reception and marked the beginning of a very prolific period of song making.|$|E
5|$|The {{flotilla}} {{was ordered}} back to Felixstowe in Autumn 1942. Their first {{contact with the}} enemy was on the night 14/15 September when they engaged a small convoy off the Hook of Holland. They followed a convoy that was escorted by four Flak trawlers almost into harbour before inflicting considerable damage <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> <b>For</b> this, Hichens was awarded a second Bar to his DSC. Other members of the flotilla were awarded a DSC, two DSMs and a MID.|$|E

5|$|Although Pytka {{fixed the}} ideas on a storyboard, he {{abandoned}} {{it as soon}} as filming began, and followed ideas based on what angles and perspectives the steadycam camera produced. One instance was the filming of the car crash, which Pytka filmed for hours from above, but realised that a steadycam shot on the ground was a much better idea. Archive footage was used by imposing it on scenes shot by Pytka, who utilised a greenscreen stage to digitally blend it into the finished film, such as Paul's Old English Sheepdog in the graveyard, and the elephant in the ballroom procession scene. The elephant was put in last, as Aspinall phoned Pytka and said that Starr liked the scene, but insisted an elephant be put in it, which Pytka later did, as he had already put a sitar in at the request of Harrison. Apart from the steadycam shots, Pytka used a Russian-made Akil-crane for sweeping overhead shots, such as the Abbey Road zebra crossing shot at the end, as well as a remote-controlled toy helicopter with a camera added <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> intricate aerial shots. To make it more interesting, two Blue Meanies make cameos.|$|E
5|$|The building, {{designed}} by James Lewis was the former Bethlem Royal Hospital {{which had been}} vacated following the hospital's relocation to Beckenham in Kent. The site was owned by Lord Rothermere, who had originally intended to demolish the building entirely {{in order to provide}} a public park in what was a severely overcrowded area of London. Eventually the central portion of the hospital building was retained while its two extensive wings were removed and the resulting space named Geraldine Mary Harmsworth Park, after Lord Rothermere's mother. Sir Martin Conway described the building as '...a fine building, really quite noble building, with a great portico, a distinguishing dome, and two great wings added <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> the accommodation of lunatics no longer required. This particular building can be made to contain our collection admirably, and we shall preserve from destruction quite a fine building which otherwise will disappear'. The 'distinguishing dome' was added by Sydney Smirke in 1846 and housed the hospital's chapel. The museum was reopened by the Duke of York (later King George VI) in its new accommodation on 7 July 1936.|$|E

50|$|This is {{typically}} illustrated in two ways. In a valuation paradigm, people {{will tend to}} pay more to retain something they own than to obtain something they do not own—even {{when there is no}} cause for attachment, or even if the item was only obtained minutes ago. In an exchange paradigm, people given a good are reluctant <b>to</b> trade <b>it</b> <b>for</b> another good of similar value. For example, participants first given a Swiss chocolate bar were generally unwilling <b>to</b> trade <b>it</b> <b>for</b> a coffee mug, whereas participants first given the coffee mug were generally unwilling <b>to</b> trade <b>it</b> <b>for</b> the chocolate bar.|$|R
