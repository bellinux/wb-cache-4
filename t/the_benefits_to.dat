5|$|Since the 18th century, {{people have}} become {{increasingly}} concerned about the welfare of farm animals. Possible measures of welfare include longevity, behavior, physiology, reproduction, freedom from disease, and freedom from immunosuppression. Standards and laws for animal welfare have been created worldwide, broadly {{in line with the}} most widely held position in the western world, a form of utilitarianism: that it is morally acceptable for humans to use non-human animals, provided that no unnecessary suffering is caused, and that <b>the</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>to</b> humans outweigh the costs to the livestock. An opposing view is that animals have rights, should not be regarded as property, and should never be used by humans.|$|E
5|$|The Food and Nutrition Service (FNS), a {{component}} of the USDA, provides the funds to the Puerto Rican government's Department of the Family to operate the program through an annual block grant, which covers the full cost of <b>the</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>to</b> participants, as well as fifty percent (50%) of the costs required to administer the program (the remaining 50% must be provided by the Puerto Rican government). Although federal regulations require Puerto Rico to pay the benefits during the year for which the annual block grant was awarded, since 2002 the federal government has allowed Puerto Rico to use 2% of an annual surplus for benefits in future years.|$|E
5|$|The Puerto Rico Department of the Family {{currently}} provides <b>the</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>to</b> each participating family {{through a}} debit card, which replaced the physical cheques {{in the early}} 2000s. The monthly benefit is deposited through an electronic benefit transfer (EBT) system into a government-designated personal bank account, which can be accessed at any time with the debit card to withdraw cash or to make food purchases from authorized retailers. Since September 2001, 75% of each family’s monthly benefit has been designated exclusively for making direct food and grocery purchases, while the remaining 25% can be withdrawn as a cash benefit. The EBT debit card system has improved the program’s payment accuracy rate to 96.4% in 2003, 4 years ahead of its 2007 goal of 95% accuracy.|$|E
30|$|We {{also tested}} the {{hypothesis}} whether <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>to</b> completion {{in respect to}} four outcomes (employment, salary, occupational status, and further study) was associated with completion outcomes. The {{results show that the}} impact of <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>to</b> completion is very limited, and in the area of a one percent impact on completion probability. Only <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>to</b> completion in terms of further study is slightly more pronounced with about a three percentage point increase in completion probability between first and third tertile of <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>to</b> completion. These results showing a relative lack of impact of <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>to</b> completion on <b>the</b> probability of completions were somewhat unexpected. Two limitations of these predictor variables should thus be considered. First, it would appear that it is somehow implied that individual students are aware of <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> of completing their course of study. This may not necessarily be the case and it can thus not be assumed that <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>to</b> completion plays a role in their decision making on whether or not to complete. Secondly, the way the variables indicating <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>to</b> completion are constructed means that they represent <b>the</b> overall <b>benefit</b> <b>to</b> completion, rather than <b>the</b> net <b>benefit.</b> In other words, individual economic costs <b>to</b> obtain <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> are not taken into account. This represents a shortcoming of all <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> variables and is difficult to overcome with presently available data. In the future {{it might be possible to}} address this via a survey that collects data on individual’s time, effort, and financial input into their training.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} the legal form of agricultural firms on <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>to</b> their owners for a panel of Slovak agricultural firms. We use return on equity (ROE) as a measure of <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>to</b> owners. Using <b>the</b> repeated measures ANOV A technique, we find that the legal form of a firm is a relevant determinant of <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>to</b> owners. We conclude that {{from the point of view}} of ROE the legal form ‘company’ is preferable over ‘cooperative’...|$|R

5|$|At {{the start}} of development, Nihilistic wanted to support editing of the game by the user-{{community}}, having seen <b>the</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>to</b> the community while working on other games. Staff who worked on Jedi Knight knew the experience of creating a new, customized programming language called COG that gave the programmers the results they wanted but cost time and significant project resources. With Redemption, they wanted to incorporate an existing scripting engine that would more easily enable users to further develop the game instead of developing their own code again, which would consume months of development time. The team tested various languages, but became aware of another studio, Rebel Boat Rocker, which was receiving attention for its use of the Java language. Speaking to that studio's lead programmer Billy Zelsnak, Nihilistic decided to experiment with Java, having little prior knowledge of it. The language successfully integrated into the NOD engine without problems, providing a standardized and freely distributable scripting engine. Several designers were trained to use Java {{to allow them to}} build the several hundred scripts required to drive the game's storyline.|$|E
5|$|The {{location}} at Great Falls of the Passaic River in New Jersey was selected due to access to raw materials, it being densely inhabited, and {{having access to}} water power from the falls of the Passaic. The factory town was named Paterson after New Jersey's Governor William Paterson, who signed the charter. The profits were to derive from specific corporates rather than <b>the</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>to</b> be conferred to {{the nation and the}} citizens, which was unlike the report. Hamilton also suggested the first stock to be offered at $500,000 and to eventually increase to $1million, and welcomed state and national government subscriptions alike. The company was never successful: numerous shareholders reneged on stock payments, some members soon went bankrupt, and William Duer, the governor of the program, was sent to debtors' prison. In spite of Hamilton's efforts to mend the disaster, the company would expire by 1796.|$|E

25|$|Advocates of neo-liberal {{economics}} {{argue that}} while import substitution policies might create {{jobs in the}} short run, as domestic producers replace foreign producers, neoliberal theory believes {{that in the long}} run output and growth will be lower than it would otherwise have been. This is because import substitution denies the country <b>the</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>to</b> be gained from specialisation and foreign imports. The theory of comparative advantage shows how countries will gain from trade. Moreover, protectionism leads to dynamic inefficiency: Domestic producers have no incentive from foreign competitors to reduce costs or improve products. Import substitution can impede growth through poor allocation of resources, and its effect on exchange rates harms exports.|$|E
