40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 71 - 73) A two part study, {{a consumer}} questionnaire and laboratory investigation, {{was conducted on}} the absorbency qualities of velour versus <b>terry</b> cloth <b>towels</b> when laundered with and without fabric softeners. Consumer opinions on preference of type of towels for aesthetic value were obtained. Chi Square statistical test was utilized for comparative analysis based on marital status, age, educational level, and family income. Fifty per cent of the respondents owned velour bath towels: of these 52 per cent rated velour towels as not very absorbent. All of the respondents owned <b>terry</b> cloth <b>towels</b> and 70 per cent of these rated terry cloth as very absorbent. The majority of the respondents who used fabric softeners stated the fabric softener made no difference in the absorbency of the towels. Velour towels were preferred for aesthetic value, but the overall preference was for the <b>terry</b> cloth <b>towels.</b> The laboratory investigation included weight, and wick-up tests. The results revealed that terry cloth was superior to velour in absorbency. The addition of fabric softeners greatly reduced the absorbability of both types of towels. Light weight <b>towels,</b> <b>terry</b> cloth and velour, are more absorbent than are heavy weight towels...|$|R
