5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Forces</b> of Liberia (AFL) are <b>the</b> <b>armed</b> <b>forces</b> of the Republic of Liberia. Tracing {{its origins}} to a militia that {{was formed by}} the first black colonists {{in what is now}} Liberia, it was founded as the Liberian Frontier Force in 1908, and retitled in 1956. For {{virtually}} all of its history, the AFL has received considerable materiel and training assistance from the United States. For most of the 1941–89 period, training was largely provided by U.S. advisers, though this assistance has not prevented the same generally low levels of effectiveness common to most of <b>the</b> <b>armed</b> <b>forces</b> in the developing world.|$|E

5|$|By the 1980s, Suharto's grip {{on power}} was {{maintained}} by the emasculation of civil society, engineered elections, {{and use of the}} military's coercive powers. Upon his retirement from the military in June 1976, Suharto undertook a re-organisation of <b>the</b> <b>armed</b> <b>forces</b> that concentrated power away from commanders to the president. In March 1983, he appointed General Leonardus Benjamin Moerdani as head of <b>the</b> <b>armed</b> <b>forces</b> who adopted a hardline on elements who challenged the administration. As a Roman Catholic, he was not a political threat to Suharto.|$|E

5|$|The monarch {{also has}} power to {{exercise}} her prerogative over {{the granting of}} honours, the regulation of <b>the</b> <b>armed</b> <b>forces</b> and ecclesiastical appointments. Although the granting of most honours is normally decided by the executive, the monarch is still the person who technically awards them. Exceptions to this rule are membership of the Order of the Garter, the Order of the Thistle, the Order of Merit, the Royal Victorian Order and the Royal Victorian Chain, which the monarch has complete discretion to grant. In relation to <b>the</b> <b>armed</b> <b>forces,</b> the monarch is the Commander in Chief, and members are regulated under the royal prerogative. Most statutes {{do not apply to}} <b>the</b> <b>armed</b> <b>forces,</b> although some areas, such as military discipline, are governed by Acts of Parliament. Under the Crown Proceedings Act 1947, the monarch is the sole authority for <b>the</b> <b>armed</b> <b>forces,</b> and as such their organisation, disposition and control cannot be questioned by the courts. This exercise of prerogative power gives the Crown authority to recruit members of <b>the</b> <b>armed</b> <b>forces,</b> appoint commissioned officers, and establish agreements with foreign governments to station troops in their territory. The prerogative empowers the monarch to appoint bishops and archbishops in the Church of England, and to regulate the printing and licensing of the authorised Church of England version of the Bible. The monarch also exerts a certain influence power on His or Her weekly and closed conversations with the Prime-Minister of the United Kingdom.|$|E
