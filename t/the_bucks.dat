5|$|On the hardwood, {{the veteran}} Robertson still proved {{he was a}} {{valuable}} player. Paired with Abdul-Jabbar, two more division titles with <b>the</b> <b>Bucks</b> followed in the 1971–72 and 1972–73 season. In Robertson's last season, he helped lead Milwaukee to a league-best 59–23 record and helped them to reach the 1974 NBA Finals. There, Robertson {{had the chance to}} end his stellar career with a second ring. <b>The</b> <b>Bucks</b> were matched up against a Boston Celtics team powered by an inspired Dave Cowens, and <b>the</b> <b>Bucks</b> lost in seven games. As a testament to Robertson's importance to <b>the</b> <b>Bucks,</b> in the season following his retirement <b>the</b> <b>Bucks</b> fell to last place in their division with a 38–44 record in spite of the continued presence of Abdul-Jabbar.|$|E
5|$|After his {{retirement}}, the Kansas City Kings (the Royals {{moved there}} while Robertson was with <b>the</b> <b>Bucks)</b> retired his #14; the retirement {{continues to be}} honored by the Kings in their current home of Sacramento. <b>The</b> <b>Bucks</b> also retired the #1 he wore in Milwaukee.|$|E

5|$|However, Pitino's {{plan was}} foiled by Nelson, whose team had the sixth pick. Nelson worked out draft day {{deals with the}} Milwaukee Bucks and the Phoenix Suns: the Mavericks wanted Nowitzki and Suns reserve point guard Steve Nash; <b>the</b> <b>Bucks</b> desired muscular forward Robert Traylor, who was {{projected}} to be drafted before Nowitzki; and the Suns had set their sights on forward Pat Garrity, who was projected as a low first round pick. In the draft, the Mavericks drafted Traylor with their sixth pick, and <b>the</b> <b>Bucks</b> selected Nowitzki with their ninth and Garrity with their nineteenth pick. The Mavericks then traded Traylor to <b>the</b> <b>Bucks</b> for Nowitzki and Garrity, and they in return traded the latter to Phoenix for Nash.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970–71 NBA season, the Lakers made {{a notable}} move by signing future Hall-of-Fame guard Gail Goodrich, who {{came back from}} the Phoenix Suns after playing for L.A. until 1968. Chamberlain {{averaged}} 20.7 points, 18.2 rebounds and 4.3 assists, once again led the NBA in rebounding and the Lakers won the Pacific Division title. After losing Elgin Baylor to an Achilles tendon rupture that effectively ended his career, and especially after losing Jerry West after a knee injury, the handicapped Lakers were seen as underdogs against the Milwaukee Bucks of freshly crowned MVP Lew Alcindor, and veteran Hall-of-Fame guard Oscar Robertson in the Western Conference Finals. Winning the regular season with 66 wins, <b>the</b> <b>Bucks</b> were seen as favourites against the depleted Lakers; still, many pundits were looking forward to the matchup between the 34-year-old Chamberlain and the 24-year-old Alcindor. In Game 1, Abdul-Jabbar outscored Chamberlain 32–22, and <b>the</b> <b>Bucks</b> won 106–85. In Game 2, <b>the</b> <b>Bucks</b> won again despite the Lakers center scoring 26 points, four more than his Milwaukee counterpart. Prior to Game 3, things became even worse for the Lakers when Keith Erickson, West's stand-in, had an appendectomy and was out for the season; with rookie Jim McMillian easing the scoring pressure, Chamberlain scored 24 points and grabbed 24 rebounds in a 118–107 victory, but <b>the</b> <b>Bucks</b> defeated the Lakers 117–94 in Game 4 to take a 3–1 series lead. Milwaukee closed out the series at home with a 116–98 victory in Game 5. Although Chamberlain lost, he was lauded for holding his own against MVP Alcindor, who was not only 10 years younger, but healthy.|$|E

5|$|The {{first section}} of the M54 was opened in 1975, then named the A5 Wellington bypass (bypassing one of the {{existing}} towns which formed part of Telford), but renumbered the M54 in 1983 when the motorway was extended.

The divided highway section ends at Roberts Road. PA 263 gains a center left-turn lane again as it continues north through more residential areas with a few businesses. Just before Bristol Road, Old York Road splits off from the route and PA 263 curves more to the northeast, retaining the name York Road.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the trade}} proved highly {{beneficial}} for Robertson. After being stuck with an under-performing team the last six years, he now was paired with the young Lew Alcindor, who would years later become the all-time NBA scoring leader as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. With Alcindor in the low post and Robertson running the backcourt, <b>the</b> <b>Bucks</b> charged to a league-best 66–16 record, including a then-record 20-game win streak, a dominating 12–2 record in the playoffs, and crowned their season with the NBA title by sweeping the Baltimore Bullets 4–0 in the 1971 NBA Finals. For {{the first time in}} his career, Robertson had won an NBA championship.|$|E
5|$|In retrospect, Don Nelson, who {{had once}} coached <b>the</b> <b>Bucks,</b> had an {{outstanding}} trade instinct, essentially trading future career underachievers Traylor and Garrity for two future NBA MVPs in Nowitzki and Nash; in addition, the new recruits quickly became close friends. Nowitzki became only the fourth German player in NBA history, following pivots Uwe Blab and Christian Welp and All-Star swingman Detlef Schrempf, who was a 35-year-old veteran of the Seattle SuperSonics when his young compatriot arrived. Nowitzki finished his DJK career as the only Würzburg player to have ever made the NBA.|$|E

Kohl made a special trip to Hong Kong to appeal to Yi personally and he assured Chinese officials that Yi would have sufficient playing time.

He returned to action on November 4 against the Philadelphia 76ers in the fifth game of the season for <b>the</b> <b>Bucks</b> but struggled, posting just two points in 16 minutes as a starter. As he ramped up his activity, he was rested on the second of back-to-back games. Nonetheless, after five games, he endured a sprain in his talonavicular joint in the right mid-foot causing him to be expected to miss several games. He only missed one game. The following week, he began to come off the bench while O. J. Mayo took his starting spot. On December 12, Parker had a 19-point, 7-rebound, 2-steal performance against the Golden State Warriors to help end their 24-game win streak.
