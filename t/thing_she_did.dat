25|$|One {{apparatus}} of government which fell into Wu's power was the imperial examination system: the basic {{theory and practice}} of which was to recruit into government service those men who were the best educated, talented, and having the best potential to perform their duties, and to do so by testing a pool of candidates in order to determine this objectively. This pool was male only, and the qualified pool of candidates and resulting placements into official positions was on a relatively small scale at the time of Wu's assuming control of government. The official tests examined such things considered important for functionaries of the highly developed, bureaucratic government structure of the current imperial government. The qualities sought in a candidate for government service included determining the potential official's level of literacy in terms of reading and writing as well as his possession of the specific knowledge considered necessary and desirable for a governmental official, such as Confucian precepts on the nature of virtue and theory on the proper ordering of and relationships within society. Wu Zetian continued to use the imperial examination system to recruit civil servants, and she introduced major changes in regard to the system that she inherited, including increasing the pool of candidates permitted to take the test, by allowing commoners and gentry, who were previously disqualified by their background, to take them. Another <b>thing</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> was to expand the governmental examination system and to greatly increase the importance of this method of recruiting government officials, which she did in 693. Wu provided increased opportunity for the representation within government to people of the North China Plain, versus people of the northwestern aristocratic families, (whom she decimated, anyway); and, the successful candidates who were recruited through the examination system became an elite group within her government. The historical details surrounding and the consequences of Wu Zetian's promoting a new group of people from previously disenfranchised backgrounds into prominence as powerful governmental officials as well as the role of the examination system in this regard, remains a matter of debate for scholars of this subject.|$|E
500|$|Scholars have {{wondered}} {{what it was that}} Sycorax did to avoid execution, as described in Act one, Scene two by Prospero: [...] "for one <b>thing</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> / They [...] would not take her life." [...] Charles Lamb, a Romantic writer fascinated by Shakespeare and his works, and particularly intrigued by this question, found in John Ogilby's [...] "Accurate Description of Africa" [...] (1670) two versions of a story about Emperor Charles V's invasion of Algiers in 1541, relating that a witch (not named in the source text) had advised the commander of the city not to surrender, predicting the destruction of the besieging fleet, which was accomplished nine days later by a [...] "dreadful tempest". The principal version given claims that she was [...] "richly remunerated" [...] but the alternative version, [...] "to palliate the shame and the reproaches that are thrown upon them for making use of a witch," [...] attributes the storm to the prayers of a holy man named Cidy Utica.|$|E

2500|$|The family residence, [...] "Calumet Place," [...] Washington, {{in which}} Gen. Logan died, {{was then a}} new and long-desired home, but unpaid for. Friends of the General in Chicago voluntarily raised a fund and put it at Mrs. Logan's disposal. The first <b>thing</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> was to secure the homestead, and in it devoted {{what was once the}} studio of an artist and former owner to a [...] "Memorial Hall," [...] where all the General's books, army uniforms, portraits, busts, {{presents}} and souvenirs of life were gathered to form an interesting collection. She gave the collection of memorials, trophies and souvenirs of her husband and only son, Maj.

6000|$|When {{she reached}} the city, the first <b>thing</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> was to look about {{and see if there}} was any churchyard, and when she found none, she exclaimed, 'This is a {{delightful}} spot. We will stay here for ever.' ...|$|E
