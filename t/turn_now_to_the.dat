60|$|But {{enough of}} the stale spilth of bar-rooms. <b>Turn</b> <b>now</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> august {{spectacle}} of a Government of the people, by the people, for the people, as it is understood {{in the city of}} San Francisco. Professor Bryce's book will tell you that every American citizen over twenty-one years of age possesses a vote. He may not know how to run his own business, control his wife, or instil reverence into his children, may be pauper, half-crazed with drink, bankrupt, dissolute, or merely a born fool; but he has a vote. If he likes, he can be voting most of his time--voting for his State Governor, his municipal officers, local option, sewage contracts, or anything else of which he has no special knowledge.|$|E
60|$|<b>Turning</b> <b>now</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{mythology of}} Greece, {{we see that}} the same rule holds good.

6000|$|<b>Turn</b> <b>now</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> temperance revolution. In it {{we shall}} find a {{stronger}} bondage broken, a viler slavery manumitted, a greater tyrant deposed; in it, more of want supplied, more disease healed, more sorrow assuaged. By it no Orphans starving, no widows weeping. By it none wounded in feeling, none injured in interest; even the drammaker and dram-seller will have glided into other occupations so gradually as {{never to have}} felt the change, and will stand ready to join all others in the universal song of gladness. And what a noble ally this {{to the cause of}} political freedom, with such an aid its march cannot fail to be on and on, till every son of earth shall drink in rich fruition the sorrow-quenching draughts of perfect liberty. Happy day when-all appetites controlled, all poisons subdued, all matter subjected-mind, all-conquering mind, shall live and move, the monarch of the world. Glorious consummation! Hail, fall of fury! Reign of reason, all hail! ...|$|E
60|$|So far we {{have been}} dealing only with the Saracenic share in the European revival. Let us <b>turn</b> <b>now</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{influence}} of the Mongol conquests. They stimulated the geographical imagination of Europe enormously. For a time under the Great Khan, all Asia and Western Europe enjoyed an open intercourse; all the roads were temporarily open, and representatives of every nation appeared at the court of Karakorum. The barriers between Europe and Asia {{set up by the}} religious feud of Christianity and Islam were lowered. Great hopes were entertained by the papacy for the conversion of the Mongols to Christianity. Their only religion so far had been Shumanism, a primitive paganism. Envoys of the Pope, Buddhist priests from India, Parisian and Italian and Chinese artificers, Byzantine and Armenian merchants, mingled with Arab officials and Persian and Indian astronomers and mathematicians at the Mongol court. We hear too much in history of the campaigns and massacres of the Mongols, and not enough of their curiosity and desire for learning. Not perhaps as an originative people, but as transmitters {299} of knowledge and method their influence upon the world's history has been very great. And everything one can learn of the vague and romantic personalities of Jengis or Kublai tends to confirm the impression that these men were at least as understanding and creative monarchs as either that flamboyant but egotistical figure Alexander the Great or that raiser of political ghosts, that energetic but illiterate theologian Charlemagne.|$|E
60|$|Rousseau's {{name has}} never lacked fanatical partisans {{down to our}} own day, and Diderot was {{attacked}} {{by some of the}} earliest of them for his note of disparagement. The first part of the Confessions--all that Diderot ever saw--appeared in 1782, and in the same year Diderot published a second edition of the Essay on Claudius and Nero, so augmented by replies, inserted in season and out of season, to the diatribes of the party of Rousseau, that as it now stands the reader may well doubt whether the substance and foundation of the book is an apology for Seneca or a vindication of Denis Diderot. As Grimm said, we have to make up our minds to see the author suddenly pass from the palace of the Cæsars to the garret of MM. Royou, Grosier, and company; from Paris to Rome, and from Rome back again to Paris; from the reign of Claudius to the reign of Lewis XV.; from the college of the Sorbonne to the college of the augurs; to <b>turn</b> <b>now</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> masters of the world, and now to the yelping curs of literature; to see him in his dramatic enthusiasm making the one speak and the others answer; apostrophising himself and apostrophising his readers, and leaving them often enough in perplexity as to the personage who is speaking and the personage whom he addresses.[185] We may agree with Grimm that this gives an air of originality to the performance, but such originality is of a kind to displease the serious student, without really attracting the few readers who have a taste for rebelling against the pedantries of literary form. We become confused by the long strain of uncertainty whether we are reading about the Roman Emperor or the French King; about Seneca, Burrhus, and Thrasea, or Turgot, Malesherbes, and Necker.|$|E

Finally, the new avant-garde that emerged during the post-war years is represented by Otho Lloyd and Joaquim Gomis, whose pioneering work found its continuation in the Neorealists Francesc Català-Roca, Joan Colom, Oriol Maspons and Xavier Miserachs, among others.|$|R

Thanks <b>to</b> <b>the</b> immense series of labors thus inaugurated, the following fundamental truths have been established.|$|R

30|$|We <b>turn</b> <b>now</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{impact on}} {{changes to the}} {{distribution}} of income that results from changes to policy.

30|$|We <b>turn</b> <b>now</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{theory of}} Kato {{smoothness}} {{which is based}} primarily on two papers of Kato [335, 337]. The first is the basic one with four important results: the equivalence of many conditions giving the definition, the connection to spectral analysis, the implications for existence and completeness of wave operators and, finally, a perturbation result. The second paper concerns the Putnam–Kato theorem on positive commutators.|$|E
