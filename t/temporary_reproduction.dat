5000|$|On {{appeal to}} the Federal Court of Appeal, however, the {{material}} form issue was not addressed and it could still be argued that such temporary copies such as those held on RAM do not meet such a requirement. It is odd to consider, for instance, how [...] "material form" [...] has been construed from being something [...] "capable of identification and having more or less permanent endurance" [...] in Canadian Admiral to something [...] "ephemeral" [...] and incapable of being perceived in the Satellite Radio decision. In addition, {{it could be argued}} that section 30.71 in Bill C-11 will address <b>temporary</b> <b>reproduction</b> for technological process, exempting reproduction of work or other subject-matter if the reproduction forms an essential part of a technological process. This would be in line with a supreme court decision where caches on an IP server were found to be copies made purely for technical reasons (to improve efficiency and utility) and therefore fell within a copyright exemption for telecommunication providers.|$|E
50|$|In the United Kingdom {{and many}} other Commonwealth countries, a similar notion of fair dealing was {{established}} by the courts or through legislation. The concept is sometimes not well defined; however in Canada, private copying for personal use has been expressly permitted by statute since 1999. In Alberta (Education) v. Canadian Copyright Licensing Agency (Access Copyright), 2012 SCC 37, the Supreme Court of Canada concluded that limited copying for educational purposes could also be justified under the fair dealing exemption. In Australia, the fair dealing exceptions under the Copyright Act 1968 (Cth) are a limited set of circumstances under which copyrighted material can be legally copied or adapted without the copyright holder's consent. Fair dealing uses are research and study; review and critique; news reportage and the giving of professional advice (i.e. legal advice). Under current Australian law, although {{it is still a}} breach of copyright to copy, reproduce or adapt copyright material for personal or private use without permission from the copyright owner, owners of a legitimate copy are permitted to “format shift” that work from one medium to another for personal, private use, or to “time shift” a broadcast work for later, once and only once, viewing or listening. Other technical exemptions from infringement may also apply, such as the <b>temporary</b> <b>reproduction</b> of a work in machine readable form for a computer.|$|E

40|$|A {{patient with}} a history of two {{spontaneous}} abortions, at the 16 th and 20 th week, respectively, and one intra-uterine fetal death at the 26 th week of gestation was investigated. The sole abnormal condition that could be evidenced was a submucosal leiomyoma of 56 mm in diameter in the uterine fundus. Administration of gonadotropin/releasing hormone analog (GnRHa) for 10 months resulted in complete disappearance of myoma. Direct intraperitoneal insemination following induction of ovulation resulted in pregnancy. In a patient harboring uterine leiomyomas, adversely affecting conception and pregnancy outcome, GnRHa treatment may be an initial approach allowing to avoid pelvic surgery. As the beneficial effect of GnRHa might be <b>temporary,</b> assisted <b>reproduction</b> procedures might anticipate conception...|$|R
40|$|In situ atomic force {{microscopy}} {{has been}} used to study the effect of dissolved cobalt on the growth and dissolution of calcite 10. 4 surfaces. Growth experiments conducted in the presence of various cobalt concentrations revealed that the growth of the first layer proceeds with step growth and is faster than the growth in pure solution. The subsequent growth on the newly formed surfaces is much slower, although the solution supersaturation is kept constant. This difference in the step velocity leads to the <b>temporary</b> <b>reproduction</b> of the original surface topography (template effect). This demonstrates the role of the substrate surface structure in the crystal growth. In situ dissolution experiments conducted in the presence of cobalt revealed that cobalt is sorbed at the negative (acute) kinks leading to the formation of monomolecular semi-triangular etch pits...|$|E

40|$|Reproductive {{altruism}} is {{an extreme}} form of altruism best typified by sterile castes in social insects and somatic cells in multicellular organisms. Although reproductive altruism {{is central to the}} evolution of multicellularity and eusociality, the mechanistic basis for the evolution of this behaviour is yet to be deciphered. Here, we report that the gene responsible for the permanent suppression of reproduction in the somatic cells of the multicellular green alga, Volvox carteri, evolved from a gene that in its unicellular relative, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, is part of the general acclimation response to various environmental stress factors, which includes the <b>temporary</b> suppression of <b>reproduction.</b> Furthermore, we propose a model for the evolution of soma, in which by simulating the acclimation signal (i. e. a change in cellular redox status) in a developmental rather than environmental context, responses beneficial to a unicellular individual can be co-opted into an altruistic behaviour at the group level. The co-option of environmentally induced responses for reproductive altruism can contribute to the stability of this behaviour, as the loss of such responses would be costly for the individual. This hypothesis also predicts that temporally varying environments, which will select for more efficient acclimation responses, {{are likely to be more}} conducive to the evolution of reproductive altruism...|$|R
40|$|The {{capacity}} of tadpoles {{to reduce their}} metamorphosis time and body size in response to fluctuations in environmental variables of temporary ponds has been recorded in field and laboratory studies. The main alterations in this habitat {{are related to the}} decrease of the water level and increase in temperature. However, few studies tried to dissociate the effect of these two variables. The aim {{of the present study was}} to analyze simultaneously the effects of water volume reduction and temperature on the development and growth in tadpoles of Pleurodema diplolister (Peters, 1870) and Rhinella granulosa (Spix, 1824) - species that use <b>temporary</b> ponds for <b>reproduction.</b> The tadpoles of these two species were subject to four treatments: (1) constant volume of water of 2000 ml and constant temperature of 26 ºC; (2) gradually decreasing water volume from 2000 ml to 200 ml or 150 ml and constant temperature of 26 ºC; (3) Constant water volume as in (1) and constant temperature of 30 ºC or 33 ºC and (4) Decreasing water volume (as above) and constant temperature as in the treatment (3). There was no interaction between both tested variables on the growth and development of tadpoles of both species. Tadpoles of P. diplolister and R. granulosa responded to high temperature by decreasing development time. Tadpoles responded to decreasing volume of water by metamorphosing into smaller size. Tadpoles of P. diplolister maintained at 30 ºC showed growth reduction. Tadpoles of R. granulosa increased their body size when subject to the treatment at 30 ºC...|$|R
40|$|The locomotory {{activity}} and reproductive behaviour of the Philander opossum Caluromys philander {{have been studied}} in a 80 -year old forest near Cayenne, French Guyana, from September 1 978 to O ctober 1979. One hundred and seventy one individuals were live-trapped and marked, and 12 of them (5 females and 7 males followed by radio-tracking. This solitary, arboreal and nocturnal marsupial is predominantly frugivorous, a few arthropods supplementing a basically vegetarian diet. lts home range averages 0. 75 ha (N= 26) and broadly overlaps those of neighbouring individuals. Some individuals are very sedentary; {{one of them has}} been recaptured 43 times {{in the course of the}} year in the study area. Others are more mobile; two of them equipped with radio-transmitters have wandered 500 metres away from the area where they were first captured. Some immature and adult transients have also been noted in the study area. Significant variations in the duration of the nocturnal activity periods have been observed; they were correlated with the availability of food supply and the reproductive status of the females. Lactating mothers with pouch-young older than 5 weeks (Group 1) needed twice as much food as non-lactating females, or females with pouch-young less than 5 weeks old (Group 2). From November to May, when food supply was abundant, Group 1 females were active on average during 9 hours every night, as opposed to 5 hours per night in Group 2 females. From June to October, when food resources were scarcer, females of the two groups spent more than 9 hours per night foraging for food. Two breeding periods were noted during the year of study. The first took place from October to December 1978. The food situation being very favourable at that time, 95 % of the young born survived until weaning. A second generation was produced between April and June 1979, at a time when food was becoming scarcer. The reproductive success was consequently much reduced, over 80 % of the young dying in the pouch, and mothers losing weight. Such "pouch-abortions" were followed by a two-month anoestrous period. A third batch of young were born in September 1979, just before the end of the field study. As other Didelphids, Caluromys philander is a polyoestrous marsupial. However, scarcity of food can lead to "pouch abortions" and to a <b>temporary</b> inhibition of <b>reproduction...</b>|$|R
