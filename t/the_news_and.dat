5|$|After {{a five-day}} away mission spent apologising {{on the planet}} Kreetassa, the away team {{consisting}} of Captain Archer, Sub-Commander T'Pol, Ensign Sato, and Archer's dog, Porthos, return to the ship to decontaminate. Porthos has acquired a pathogen on the planet surface and must be quarantined. Archer learns from Commander Tucker of the ship's need for an extra plasma injector from the Kreetassans, but negotiations break down after it is discovered that Porthos had urinated on a sacred tree, insulting the Kreetassans. Archer reacts poorly to <b>the</b> <b>news</b> <b>and</b> is given a list of requirements he must meet in order to apologise.|$|E
5|$|At 7:30am {{the next}} morning, the Duke of Wellington {{wrote to the}} Mayor of Liverpool from his lodgings in nearby Roby. He had been due to receive the Freedom of the City, but felt that under the {{circumstances}} any kind of celebration would be inappropriate, {{and said that he}} would not be attending any of the planned events in the city that day. The planned parades and ceremonial dinner were cancelled, but in the absence of rapid transit or mass communication there was no way to notify most of the city's population. While some shops had heard <b>the</b> <b>news</b> <b>and</b> remained shuttered, the ships in Liverpool's docks remained festooned with brightly coloured streamers, and sounded their horns at the time the Duke was expected to be passing.|$|E
5|$|Following the battle, Scheer joined those {{calling for}} {{unrestricted}} submarine warfare against the Allies, a move the Kaiser eventually permitted. In August 1918, Scheer {{was promoted to}} the Chief of Naval Staff; Admiral Franz von Hipper replaced him as commander of the fleet. Together they planned a final battle against the British Grand Fleet, but war-weary sailors mutinied at <b>the</b> <b>news</b> <b>and</b> the operation was abandoned. Scheer retired {{after the end of}} the war.|$|E

5|$|Matilda {{gave birth}} to her first son in March 1133 at Le Mans, the future Henry II. Henry was delighted by <b>the</b> <b>news</b> <b>and</b> came to see her at Rouen. At Pentecost 1134, son Geoffrey was born in Rouen, but the {{childbirth}} was extremely difficult and Matilda appeared close to death. She made arrangements for her will and argued with her father about where she should be buried. Matilda preferred Bec Abbey, but Henry wanted her to be interred at Rouen Cathedral. Matilda recovered, and Henry was overjoyed by the birth of his second grandson, possibly insisting on another round of oaths from his nobility.|$|E
5|$|Stalin {{was aware}} that the Americans {{were working on the}} atomic bomb and, given that the Soviets' own rival program was in place, he reacted to the news calmly. The Soviet leader said he was pleased by <b>the</b> <b>news</b> <b>and</b> {{expressed}} the hope that the weapon would be used against Japan. One week {{after the end of the}} Potsdam Conference, the US bombed Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Shortly after the attacks, Stalin protested to US officials when Truman offered the Soviets little real influence in occupied Japan.|$|E
5|$|The {{circulation}} {{rose from}} 64,000 in 1965 to 67,000 in 1967; the modest 5% increase was exceeded only by Analog {{among the other}} science-fiction magazines, and If won the Hugo Award for best professional SF magazine three years running during this period. However, in March 1969, Robert Guinn sold all four of his magazines, including Galaxy and If, to Arnold Abramson at Universal Publishing and Distribution Corporation (UPD). Pohl was in Rio de Janeiro when he heard <b>the</b> <b>news,</b> <b>and</b> decided to resign his position as editor rather than continue under the new management. He had been considering {{a return to a}} writing career for some time and the change in ownership precipitated his decision to leave.|$|E

5|$|Aubrey fought {{constantly}} {{with officials}} of CBS News, especially its chief, Fred W. Friendly, {{who was just}} as demanding and controlling as Aubrey. Friendly felt Aubrey was insufficiently concerned with public affairs and in his memoir, Due to Circumstances Beyond Our Control, recounts one budget meeting at CBS when Aubrey talked at length of how much money the news was costing the company, a sea of red ink that could be stopped by replacing news with more entertainment programs. However, Paley supported <b>the</b> <b>news</b> <b>and</b> protected Friendly's division from Aubrey's proposed budget cuts. Aubrey in 1962 ordered {{that there would be}} fewer specials, both entertainment and news, because he felt interruptions to the schedule alienated viewers by disrupting their routine viewing, sending them to the competition. Friendly resented this move.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} August, all of Bonanza Creek {{had been}} claimed by miners. A {{prospector}} then advanced up {{into one of the}} creeks feeding into Bonanza, later to be named Eldorado Creek. He discovered new sources of gold there, which would prove to be even richer than those on Bonanza. Claims began to be sold between miners and speculators for considerable sums. Just before Christmas, word of the gold reached Circle City. Despite the winter, many prospectors immediately left for the Yukon by dog-sled, eager to reach the region before the best claims were taken. The outside world was still largely unaware of <b>the</b> <b>news</b> <b>and</b> although Canadian officials had managed {{to send a message to}} their superiors in Ottawa about the finds and influx of prospectors, the government did not give it much attention. The winter prevented river traffic, and it was not until June 1897 that the first boats left the area, carrying the freshly mined gold and the full story of the discoveries.|$|E
5|$|Evan {{suspects}} {{that one of}} his neighbors is an alien due to his strange, stiff way of speaking and because he always seems to be watching Evan. As the watch scouts the neighbor's house, Bob learns that Chelsea is at an unsupervised party with Jason. Bob disobeys Evan's orders and rushes to the party with Franklin. Bob prevents Jason from raping Chelsea, but Jason beats him until Franklin intervenes. Evan and Jamarcus investigate the odd neighbor alone, discovering that he hosts orgies in his basement. When Bob returns, he and Evan argue over his putting his daughter above the watch. Bob is fired from the watch after saying Evan has no friends because he tries to control everything. Evan goes home and admits his infertility to Abby, who accepts <b>the</b> <b>news</b> <b>and</b> tells him they will work things out.|$|E
