5|$|Conversely, the {{woodwasp}} {{is fully}} {{dependent on the}} symbionts. Decomposition enables the larvae <b>to</b> <b>unlock</b> <b>the</b> wood by producing white rot. The mycetangia of this and other wasps from the family Siricidae support {{a close relationship with}} saprobiontic fungi. Without the process of decomposition of the host tree and weakening of the infested tree, the development of larvae is arrested. If the tree can recover from the consequences of the wasp secretion, it blocks the boreholes with resin, thus killing the larvae.|$|E

5|$|Faced by {{the threat}} of a {{sovereign}} default and potential resulting exit of the eurozone, some final attempts were made by the Greek government in May 2015 to settle an agreement with the Troika about some adjusted terms for Greece to comply with in order to activate the transfer of the frozen bailout funds in its current programme. The Eurogroup recently granted a six-month technical extension of its current bailout programme to Greece (now set to expire by the end of June 2015), which means the time window to complete negotiations and subsequently implement the conditional measures <b>to</b> <b>unlock</b> <b>the</b> remaining bailout transfers now is very short. Expectations are that Greece in addition will need a follow-up support programme starting 1 July 2015. The Troika announced the condition for offering Greece (and begin negotiations about) establishment of a follow-up programme would be a prior successful completion of the re-negotiated current programme.|$|E
5|$|The game {{opens with}} an {{introduction}} about a seaside town which was damaged by a cataclysm and consequently {{sunk into the}} depths of the earth. A town named Rogueport was later built at this site, with the fortunes of the lost kingdom fabled to exist behind the eponymous Thousand-Year Door, located in the ruins of the old town. Mario becomes involved when Princess Peach contacts him about a treasure map that she bought in Rogueport, but becomes part of a larger adventure after learning that Peach has gone missing. With the help of Goombella and Professor Frankly, Mario learns that the map can potentially reveal the location of the 7 legendary Crystal Stars, which are required <b>to</b> <b>unlock</b> <b>the</b> Thousand-Year Door. Under the assumption that Peach herself is trying to find the Crystal Stars, he uses the map in an attempt to locate her.|$|E

The man, a mad scientist, expresses surprise that the boy has managed {{to get past the}} guards and booby traps in the mansion's grounds. As the boy scout explains the reason for his visit, the scientist collapses, asking for his pills. At this point the game begins. The player must gather the 16 keys needed <b>to</b> <b>unlock</b> <b>the</b> safe and retrieve the scientist's pills before he passes away. During play the boy scout must negotiate the mansion's rooms, avoiding hazards and the mansion's staff, who have been told to protect the inventions within the mansion, using lethal force if necessary. The staff are unaware of the boy scout's purpose and will attack him should they come into contact.|$|E

The girls try to find the aunt <b>to</b> <b>unlock</b> <b>the</b> door but only find Mac's severed hand in a jar. Melody begins to play the piano to keep the girl's spirits up as the girls hear Gorgeous singing upstairs. As Prof and Kung Fu go to investigate, Melody's fingers are bitten off by the piano, and it ultimately eats her whole.|$|E
5|$|During Rogue Squadron development, {{the first}} new Star Wars film in more than 15yearswas {{less than one year}} from its {{scheduled}} release date. To take advantage of this marketing opportunity, Factor 5 included content from the upcoming film in Rogue Squadron. LucasFilm provided the developers with design art for the Naboo Starfighter, a ship prominently featured in the new film. These designs were used to create an in-game model. Because the game was scheduled to be released six months before the film, Factor 5 was required to keep the ship's inclusion a secret. As a result, most of the game's development team at Factor 5 and LucasArts were not informed of its inclusion. A complex scrambling system was also developed to help hide the ship's code from gamers using cheat cartridges such as GameShark or Action Replay. More than six months after the release of Rogue Squadron, LucasArts unveiled the code <b>to</b> <b>unlock</b> <b>the</b> Naboo Starfighter as a playable craft. The code has been named the Nintendo 64's most well-hidden code because of the length of time before its discovery.|$|E

5|$|Pandora's Tower is {{an action}} {{role-playing}} game where players take {{the role of}} Aeron as he explores a fortress called the Thirteen Towers, suspended above a ravine known as the Scar, on a quest to cure his lover Elena of a curse. Aeron can be controlled through both the Wii Remote and Nunchuk or the Classic Controller. The base from which Aeron explores the Thirteen Towers is the Observatory, a building {{on the edge of}} the Scar. In the Observatory, Aeron can save his progress, and interact with Elena and the merchant Mavda.

5|$|The {{victims are}} {{informed}} by microcassette recorder that antidotes are hidden throughout the house; {{one is in}} the room's safe, and a cryptic clue is provided. Xavier ignores a warning note and uses a key on the door, which fires a bullet through the peephole and Gus' eye, killing him. They search the house for more antidotes after the room lets them out, with no success: Obi, who is revealed to have helped with the abductions, is forced into a crematory oven to obtain two antidotes inside, but inadvertently activates the trap and is burned to death before the others can save him, destroying the antidotes; In the next room, Xavier throws Amanda into a syringe-filled pit intended for himself, and though {{she is able to}} retrieve the key, he is unable <b>to</b> <b>unlock</b> <b>the</b> steel door behind which the antidote sits before the timer expires and he leaves out of frustration. Throughout the game, they discuss connections between them and determine that each has been jailed before; the sole exception is Daniel, who has nonetheless been arrested before.|$|E
5|$|To {{initiate}} {{firing the}} weapon the trigger mechanism, which was essentially just a large spring, {{had to be}} cocked, and to do this was a difficult and awkward process. The user had to first place the PIAT on its butt, then place two feet on the shoulder padding and turn the weapon <b>to</b> <b>unlock</b> <b>the</b> body and simultaneously lock the firing pin to the butt; the user would then have to bend over and pull {{the body of the}} weapon upwards, thereby pulling the spring back until it attached to the trigger and cocking the weapon. Once this was achieved, the body was then lowered and turned to reattach it {{to the rest of the}} weapon, and the PIAT could then be fired. Users of a small stature often found the cocking sequence challenging, as they did not have the sufficient height required to pull the body up far enough to cock the weapon; it was also difficult to do when lying in a prone position, as was often the case when using the weapon in action.|$|E
