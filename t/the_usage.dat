James, seeing that some judges ruled by Gothic law and some by Roman law, according to a tradition of usus terrae (local custom), approached the Catalan Courts in 1251 to establish the primacy of <b>the</b> <b>Usages.</b> Though <b>the</b> <b>Usages</b> applied legally only to the Barcelonan county, in practice they were applied to the entire Principality of Catalonia.|$|R
