50|$|During Starting, the proven DIWA {{power split}} {{principle}} comes into action. As {{soon as the}} vehicle begins to move, power is divided steplessly between the hydrodynamic and the mechanical transmission of torque. In 1st gear, the DIWA range, input clutch and turbine brake are closed. The engine torque is directly transmitted to the outer rim of the differential. The impeller and the pump shaft is driven in opposite rotary directions via the planetary gears of the differential. During this process, the output and hence the planetary carrier remain stationary.In the converter, oil delivered by the impeller flows through the guide wheel to the turbine wheel in a closed circuit.

50|$|From 2nd to 4th gear, in {{contrast}} to the 1st gear, power transmission in 2nd to 4th gear occurs purely mechanically. The transition from 1st gear into 2nd gear occurs automatically, independent on the driving speed and the driving peddle position. The hydrodynamic power transmission is switched off in 2nd gear. This occurs by the pump brake being closed, which stops the impeller. At the same time, the turbine wheel is not transmitting torque to the <b>turbine</b> <b>gear</b> due to the open turbine brake. The transmission ratio of the 2nd gear corresponds to the input differential.When changing from 2nd into 3rd gear, the input clutch opens and the lockup clutch, is shut. As a result, the drive shaft is, by the outer rim of the locked up clutch, directly connected with the planetary gear shaft, and thus the output shaft. The ratio is now 1:1.Depending on the position of the accelerator pedal, the vehicle load and the topography, the shift from 3rd to 4th gear occurs automatically. During this transition, the locked up clutch opens while the coupling for the 4th gear, the fast release coupling, closes.The 4th gear represents the overdrive gear, with the ratio of 0.7 or 0.73 depending on the differential.|$|E

40|$|In this {{research}} study, the micro-pitting related contact failures of wind turbine gearbox components were investigated both experimentally and theoretically. On the experimental side, a twin-disk type test machine {{was used to}} simulate wind turbine transmission contacts {{in terms of their}} kinematic (rolling and sliding speeds), surface roughnesses, material parameters and lubricant conditions. A test matrix that represents the ranges of contact conditions of the wind <b>turbine</b> <b>gear</b> boxes was defined and executed to bring an empirical understanding to the micro-pitting problem in terms of key contact parameters and operating conditions. On the theoretical side, the first deterministic micro-pitting model based on a mixed elastohydrodynamic lubrication formulations and multi-axial near-surface crack initiation model was developed. This physics-based model includes actual instantaneous asperity contacts associated with real surface roughness profiles for predicting the onset of the micro-pit formation. The predictions from the theoretical model were compared to the experimental data for validation of the models. The close agreement between the model and measurements was demonstrated.

40|$|Wind {{turbines}} {{are mainly}} located in harsh environment, {{and the maintenance}} is therefore very difficult. The wind turbine faults are mostly from the gear box, and the fault signal is generally nonlinear and nonstationary. The traditional fault diagnosis methods such as Fast Fourier transform (FFT) and the inverted frequency spectrum identification method based on FFT are not satisfactory in processing this kind of signal. This paper proposes a hybrid fault diagnosis method which combines the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and wavelet transform. The vibration signal is analyzed through wavelet transform, and the aliasing in high-frequency signals is then addressed by conducting EMD to the original signals. The experimental results based on a specific wind <b>turbine</b> <b>gear</b> box demonstrate that this method can diagnose the faults and locate their positions accurately...|$|E
40|$|Successful heat {{treating}} and carburizing of gear wheels for wind <b>turbine</b> <b>gear</b> boxes requires that plastic deformation in the wheel is minimized. Numerical modeling using the DEFORM software {{was aimed at}} exploring {{the effects of the}} base, on which the gear wheel rests during heating, on the heating process.

As a result, the base expands and slides against the wheel, predominantly at the first heating stage. Later on, it prevents the gear wheel from expanding, causing plastic deformation in the wheel. The findings were used for designing new heating schedules to minimize these undesirable interactions and to reduce the plastic deformation to a negligible magnitude. In addition, this paper presents an example of a practical use of numerical modeling in the DEFORM software. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} obtain lower cost of energy for wind {{turbines}} fault detection and accommodation is important. Expensive condition monitoring systems are often used to monitor the condition of rotating and vibrating system parts. One example is the gearbox in a wind turbine. This system is operated in parallel to the control system, using different computers and additional often expensive sensors. In this paper a simple filter based algorithm is proposed to detect changes in a resonance frequency in a system, exemplified with faults resulting in changes in the resonance frequency in the wind turbine gearbox. Only the generator speed measurement which is available in even simple wind turbine control systems is used as input. Consequently this proposed scheme does not need additional sensors and computers for monitoring {{the condition of the}} wind gearbox. The scheme is evaluated on a wide-spread wind turbine fault detection and fault tolerant control benchmark model, in which one of the included faults results in a change in the gear box resonance frequency. This evaluation shows the potential of the proposed scheme to monitor the condition of wind <b>turbine</b> <b>gear</b> boxes in the existing control system...|$|E
40|$|To {{reduce the}} {{maintenance}} cost, avoid catastrophic failure, {{and improve the}} wind transmission system reliability, online condition monitoring system is critical important. In the real applications, many rotating mechanical faults, such as bearing surface defect, gear tooth crack, chipped gear tooth and so on generate impulsive signals. When there are these types of faults developing inside rotating machinery, each time the rotating components pass over the damage point, an impact force could be generated. The impact force will cause a ringing of the support structure at the structural natural frequency. By effectively detecting those periodic impulse signals, one group of rotating machine faults could be detected and diagnosed. However, in real wind turbine operations, impulsive fault signals are usually relatively weak to the background noise and vibration signals generated from other healthy components, such as shaft, blades, gears and so on. Moreover, wind turbine transmission systems work under dynamic operating conditions. This will further increase the difficulties in fault detection and diagnostics. Therefore, developing advanced signal processing methods to enhance the impulsive signals is in great needs. In this paper, an adaptive filtering technique will be applied for enhancing the fault impulse signals-to-noise ratio in wind <b>turbine</b> <b>gear</b> transmission systems. Multiple statistical features designed to quantify the impulsive signals of the processed signal are extracted for bearing fault detection. The multiple dimensional features are then transformed into one dimensional feature. A minimum error rate classifier will be designed based on the compressed feature to identify the gear transmission system with defect. Real wind turbine vibration signals {{will be used to}} demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented methodology...|$|E
