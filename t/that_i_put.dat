500|$|Wednesday 13 {{explained}} the album's inspiration in an interview: [...] "Wednesday 13 (the band) has a live DVD <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> {{out and we}} couldn't think of a title and we were driving down the road thinking, {{we are going to}} have to come up with a name for it. The live titles, you have to put something like that. So, we were watching Bill O'Reilly and we kept listening to him say, 'Fuck it, we'll do it live.' That's kind of how quick we threw that DVD together. We didn't know we were putting it together like 4 days before so we were like, 'fuck it, we'll do it live.' We didn't do any overdubs on it, everybody in the band was sick and we just went with it." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{album cover}} {{features}} {{a photograph of}} Dylan with Suze Rotolo. It was taken in February 1963—a few weeks after Rotolo had returned from Italy—by CBS staff photographer Don Hunstein {{at the corner of}} Jones Street and West 4th Street in the West Village, New York City, close to the apartment where the couple lived at the time. In 2008, Rotolo described the circumstances surrounding the famous photo to The New York Times: [...] "He wore a very thin jacket, because image was all. Our apartment was always cold, so I had a sweater on, plus I borrowed one of his big, bulky sweaters. On top of <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> on a coat. So I felt like an Italian sausage. Every time I look at that picture, I think I look fat." [...] In her memoir, A Freewheelin' Time, Rotolo analyzed the significance of the cover art: ...|$|E

60|$|HIGGINS. You let her alone, mother. Let her {{speak for}} herself. You will jolly soon see whether {{she has an}} idea <b>that</b> <b>I</b> haven't <b>put</b> into her head or a word <b>that</b> <b>I</b> haven't <b>put</b> into her mouth. I tell you I have created this thing out of the {{squashed}} cabbage leaves of Covent Garden; and now she pretends to play the fine lady with me.|$|R
60|$|It remains <b>that</b> <b>I</b> should <b>put</b> {{before you}} what I {{understand}} {{to be the}} third phase of geological speculation--namely, EVOLUTIONISM.|$|R
60|$|This eternal {{reading of}} riddles {{was too much}} for me. <b>I</b> felt <b>that</b> <b>I</b> must <b>put</b> a term to it.|$|R
2500|$|... “ They {{are both}} great players and they {{achieved}} {{a great deal}} in their careers but I do something different. They are all focused on their results. They want to win, they want to achieve their goals, and of course so do I. The difference is <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> my focus elsewhere. Bushido teaches that to walk [...] "The Path" [...] is a goal in itself. Results are places on the road that will happen as you take the journey, but they are not the focus. The process is where my focus is and it is where I differ from every other Danish Player in history.” - speaking of fellow country-men Anders Boesen and Kenneth Johnassen after the 2002 European Championships.|$|E
2500|$|Love Equals Death {{proved to}} be a strong band and a fun band to be in, but I never felt {{comfortable}} in the band. I never felt like it was my band or that I was really a part of everyone else here ... Right before I joined LED, I started a solo project <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> on the back burner, because things were going well with LED and I ended up getting too busy to focus on it. I kept writing songs for both LED and the solo shit, knowing one day I would have to part ways with LED to fulfill my desire to express myself the way I had always dreamed. I was going to do this sooner and then [...] So I stayed to help get the band back on track and I never leave anything on a negative note.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the fourth}} round, Ali coasted, keeping his distance. However, when he {{returned}} to his corner, he started complaining that there was something burning in his eyes and he could not see. [...] "I didn't know what the heck was going on", Angelo Dundee, Ali's trainer, recalled on an NBC special 25 years later. [...] "He said, 'cut the gloves off. I want to prove to the world there's dirty work afoot.' And I said, 'whoa, whoa, back up baby. C'mon now, this is for the title, this is the big apple. What are you doing? Sit down!' So I get him down, I get the sponge and I pour the water into his eyes trying to cleanse whatever's there, but before I did <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> my pinkie in his eye and I put it into my eye. It burned like hell. There was something caustic in both eyes." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{answered}} <b>that</b> if <b>I</b> <b>put</b> it <b>that</b> way he wouldn't mind telling me. And {{everybody was}} pleased, and composed ourselves {{once more to}} listen.|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps you understood, <b>that</b> when <b>I</b> <b>put</b> the {{question}} to vote, I meant to abide by your decision, and <b>that,</b> consequently, <b>I</b> ought not to have reversed it, as I did, afterwards?" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{tried to}} {{convince}} her <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was sincere, but she simply couldn't forget the humiliation <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had <b>put</b> upon her on that other occasion.|$|R
2500|$|Originally {{expected}} for a March 2006 release, the album had two title changes and three unofficial releases until its official release the following year. Initially {{scheduled for a}} July 11, 2006 release, the album's original draft, entitled My Story, was eventually shelved {{in favor of a}} revamped version with a different vibe. Although manager Matthew Knowles initially insisted that the decision to push the release date from July 2006 was because more time would be needed to properly set up the project, Rowland later admitted that she had been unsatisfied with the album's direction, and thus, she asked to rework with a stable of new record producers on the project. Speaking of the delay and the original track listing, she told Billboard: [...] "it was basically a list of songs <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> together about the past three years of my life, with love and relationships", and added: [...] "And I remember listening to the record, and I was just like, 'I don't want this to be too deep to where, you know, [...] lose people.' And the record was too full of midtempos and ballads, so I wanted to bring it up a little bit." ...|$|E
60|$|It will {{be remembered}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> the {{commencement}} of the Fall of Venice {{as far back as}} 1418.|$|E
60|$|The first {{question}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>put,</b> {{as we drove}} from the station to the house, related naturally to her father.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know <b>that</b> <b>I</b> ever <b>put</b> it {{to myself}} so distinctly, but {{it appears to me}} now <b>that</b> <b>I</b> must have reached some such conclusion." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And do {{you wish}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> should <b>put</b> her off,--or put Oswald off,--or both? My brother never yet has seen me in your house." ...|$|R
60|$|NO! Oh no, <b>I</b> didn't mean <b>THAT.</b> <b>I</b> meant, <b>put</b> it {{in while}} it is still boiling--or just before it COMES to a boil.|$|R
60|$|How could I resist <b>that?</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> {{my hand on}} his shoulder, {{and tried}} to make him lift up his head and look at me.|$|E
6000|$|... "That was {{the nature}} of it. After <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> up some signs, for the {{protection}} of future committees, and we have had no intruders since." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll hammer {{your nose}} red-hot," [...] replied Dove, with a most undovelike scowl, [...] "I could swear <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> them matches {{in my pocket}} before I started." ...|$|E
60|$|Then, {{without waiting}} {{to learn the}} effect of my throw, I wheeled, ran the few steps to the edge, and leaped as far out over that frightful chasm as I could. I know {{something}} of diving, and all <b>that</b> <b>I</b> know <b>I</b> <b>put</b> into <b>that</b> dive, which <b>I</b> was positive would be my last.|$|R
60|$|They said <b>that</b> if <b>I</b> <b>put</b> it on <b>that</b> footing, they had, of course, no answer; {{and they}} lighted a candle for me, and {{accompanied}} me upstairs in a body.|$|R
6000|$|It {{seemed to}} me <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had <b>put</b> {{my life in the}} keeping of a peculiarly {{reckless}} outcast. Presently he turned on me and said:-- ...|$|R
60|$|She sprang back, sobbing, and assuredly {{she would}} have fallen, thrown out of balance by the {{movement}} of the coach, but <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> forth my hands and caught her.|$|E
6000|$|... "I s’pose," [...] {{said the}} skipper very softly, [...] "he means <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> such-like {{thoughts}} into ’is ’art. Well, you’d better turn in, my lads. We start work at four." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{have the}} oars. It would be uncommonly hard work, rowing, {{but it would}} keep us afloat. It was just a chance <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> them in--a lucky one as it happens." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jackson {{called on}} former San Francisco 49ers {{head coach and}} ordained {{minister}} Mike Singletary for spiritual guidance. Jackson credits Singletary, stating [...] "he helped me drop <b>that</b> shell <b>I</b> <b>put</b> up." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What in thunder {{made you}} run off {{in such a}} hurry, Nappy?" [...] demanded the other cadet {{somewhat}} surlily. [...] "You didn't answer <b>that</b> question <b>I</b> <b>put</b> to you at all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It was so <b>put,</b> simply <b>that</b> <b>I</b> might, with truth, avow <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was <b>put</b> to ransom. However, I {{paid the}} crown and the penny, and have so {{discharged}} my obligations.|$|R
6000|$|... "No. The nearest {{place is}} a little hut <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> up at {{this end of the}} island several years ago. It isn't very much of a shelter, but it might do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I s'pose," [...] {{said the}} skipper very softly, [...] "he means <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> such like thought s into 'is 'art. Well, you'd better turn in, my lads. We start work at four." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{the sooner}} you make your way down to Kensington and tell his mother so, the better," [...] Francis said, a little severely. [...] "Don't forget <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> you on to this." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{attempt to}} excuse myself. I don't {{expect you to}} {{consider}} how sorely I was tempted to secure the happiness of my brother's life, by marriage with such a woman as yourself. I don't remind you <b>that</b> <b>I</b> knew--when <b>I</b> <b>put</b> obstacles in your way--that you were blindly devoting yourself {{to the discovery of}} an innocent man." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, no, no. I am {{sure it will}} {{be natural}} and right. I am not afraid <b>that</b> <b>I</b> shall <b>put</b> a wrong {{construction}} on it, whatever it is.' ...|$|R
