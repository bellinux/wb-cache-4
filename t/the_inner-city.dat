50|$|The {{health of}} many {{residents}} differed depended on areas of living. <b>The</b> poor <b>inner-cities</b> did not or lack the necessary {{health care that}} was available in outside areas. Many of <b>the</b> <b>inner-city's</b> location was <b>the</b> main cause for this problem. They were isolated {{from other parts of}} society which was a large contributor to the poor health of these residents. Also, the overcrowded living conditions added to the poor health of the residents by the spread of infectious diseases.|$|R
5000|$|Sociologist William Julius Wilson {{has said}} that the {{economic}} restructuring of changes from manufacturing to a service-based economy has led to a high percentage of joblessness in <b>the</b> <b>inner-cities</b> and with it a loss of skills and inability to find jobs. This [...] "mismatch" [...] of skills to jobs available {{is said to be the}} main driver of poverty.|$|R
5|$|The oldest {{surviving}} {{public building}} in <b>the</b> <b>inner-city</b> is the Anglican Church of St John the Baptist, in the suburb of Reid, which was consecrated in 1845. St John's churchyard contains the earliest graves in the district. As the European presence increased, {{the indigenous population}} dwindled, mainly from disease such as smallpox and measles.|$|E
5|$|Canberra is {{a planned}} city and <b>the</b> <b>inner-city</b> area was {{originally}} designed by Walter Burley Griffin, a major 20th-century American architect. Within the central {{area of the}} city near Lake Burley Griffin, major roads follow a wheel-and-spoke pattern rather than a grid. Griffin's proposal had an abundance of geometric patterns, including concentric hexagonal and octagonal streets emanating from several radii. However, the outer areas of the city, built later, are not laid out geometrically.|$|E
5|$|The {{industrial}} developments, {{while they}} brought work and wealth, were so rapid that housing, town-planning, and provision {{for public health}} did not keep pace with them, {{and for a time}} living conditions in some of the towns and cities were notoriously bad, with overcrowding, high infant mortality, and growing rates of tuberculosis. The companies attracted rural workers, as well as immigrants from Catholic Ireland, by inexpensive company housing that was a dramatic move upward from <b>the</b> <b>inner-city</b> slums. This paternalistic policy led many owners to support government sponsored housing programs as well as self-help projects among the respectable working class.|$|E

5|$|Economic {{inequality}} within Birmingham {{is greater}} {{than in any other}} major English city, and is exceeded only by Glasgow in the United Kingdom. Levels of unemployment are {{among the highest in the}} country, with 10.0% of the economically active population unemployed (Jun 2016). In <b>the</b> <b>inner-city</b> wards of Aston and Washwood Heath, the figure is higher than 30%. Two-fifths of Birmingham's population live in areas classified as in the 10% most deprived parts of England, and overall Birmingham is the most deprived local authority in England in terms of income and employment deprivation. The city's infant mortality rate is high, around 60% worse than the national average. Meanwhile, just 49% of women have jobs, compared to 65% nationally, and only 28% of the working-age population in Birmingham have degree level qualifications in contrast to the average of 34% across other Core Cities.|$|E

In November 2010, EVA Air began nonstop flights connecting <b>the</b> <b>inner-city</b> Taipei Songshan and Tokyo Haneda airports. In 2010, Chang Kuo-wei, son of Chang Yung-fa, returned {{to serve as}} EVA Air's president, and the carrier recorded increased sales and yearly profits. In early 2011, the carrier announced that it had applied for airline alliance membership with Star Alliance, and later that year clarified {{that it was in}} talks to join either Oneworld or Star Alliance by 2013. In June 2011, the carrier began nonstop flights from Taipei to Guam, and in October 2011 the carrier announced nonstop service from New York (JFK) to Taipei.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} year, his journalistic mentor Pedlar Palmer moved to The Sydney Morning Herald and Fingleton became disenchanted. He was coaxed by cricketer-journalist {{to move his}} publication, the Telegraph Pictorial where he worked for several years before the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War. However, Fingleton's initiation into his new workplace was difficult as the Telegraph Pictorial had just merged with the Daily Telegraph and around half the workforce were to be made redundant. Fingleton was demoted from the main staff to a freelance correspondent covering events in <b>the</b> <b>inner-city</b> suburbs of Redfern and Newtown. In such crime-ridden and turbulent working-class area, Fingleton was productive in break stories and was soon restored to the regular staff.|$|E

5000|$|In 1967 Norris {{attended}} a seminar for CEOs where Whitney Young, {{head of the}} National Urban League, spoke about {{the social and economic}} injustices in the lives of young black Americans. This speech, along with a summer of violence in Norris's hometown of Minneapolis, greatly disturbed him. He became a champion of moving factories into <b>the</b> <b>inner-cities,</b> providing stable incomes and [...] "high-tech" [...] training to thousands of people who would otherwise have little chance at either.|$|R

5|$|Prince George's County {{officials}} {{continued to}} worry that cutbacks in federal funding for mass transit might lead to the cancellation of the four proposed stations (Southern Avenue, Naylor Road, Suitland, and Branch Avenue) in the county. Prince George's officials vetoed in July 1981 any further expenditure of Metro's construction funds unless Metro diverted $100 million from the Red Line extension in Montgomery County to Glenmont and began the immediate purchase of land and rights-of-way in Prince George's County. Metro agreed a month later to the plan, {{with the proviso that}} $90 million per year would be spent to begin work on <b>the</b> <b>inner-city</b> portion of the Green Line (the Gallery Place, Waterfront, and Navy Yard stations).|$|E
5|$|The third son of Arthur Percival Howell Kippax and {{his wife}} Sophie Estelle (née Craigie), Alan Kippax was born in <b>the</b> <b>inner-city</b> Sydney suburb of Paddington. He {{attended}} both Bondi and Cleveland Street Public schools. At 14, Kippax joined Waverley (now Eastern Suburbs Cricket Club) and was a regular in the first-grade team within three years. At this stage, first-class cricket was suspended because of World War I, but when competition resumed in the 191819 season he made his debut for New South Wales (NSW). However, the state possessed a lot of batting talent, which was supplemented by the return to Australia of the Australian Imperial Forces cricket team that played in England after the armistice. Therefore, Kippax’s opportunities were restricted {{for a number of}} seasons. He also played a lot of baseball with the Waverley Baseball Club (usually at third base) and represented Australia against touring teams from American universities.|$|E
5|$|After {{receiving}} the nomination, Kemp became the ticket's spokesman for minorities and <b>the</b> <b>inner-city.</b> Due to {{agreement on the}} self-help policy that Louis Farrakhan has endorsed in many fora including the Million Man March, Kemp in a sense aligned himself with Farrakhan. However, Farrakhan was perceived as being anti-Semitic, and Kemp was considered an ally of Republican Jews. This issue necessitated some political sidestepping. As the nominee, Kemp at times overshadowed Dole. In fact, more than once, Kemp was described {{as if he was}} the Presidential nominee. In addition to having overshadowed Dole, despite the negative ad campaigns that the ticket used, Kemp was a very positive running mate who relied on a pep rally type of campaign tour full of football-related metaphors and hyperbole. Although some enjoyed Kemp's style, referring to him as the Good Shepherd, his detractors, such as U.S. News & World Report writer Steven V. Roberts, criticized the extensive use of recounting stories of passing balls relative to the use of recounting stories of passing bills. During the campaign, Kemp expressed the opinion that Republican Party leaders did not stand behind the ticket wholeheartedly. Despite Kemp's voice on minority issues, Colin Powell's support and polls that showed about 30% of blacks identified themselves as conservatives on issues such as school prayer, school vouchers and criminal justice, the Republicans were unable to improve upon historical support levels from African-American voters.|$|E
