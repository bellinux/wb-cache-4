Elsie left open the possibility <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>believed</b> she had photographed her thoughts, and the media once again became interested in the story.|$|E

After other journalists investigated the article's claims and found significant discrepancies, Rolling Stone issued multiple apologies for the story. Further investigation concluded that Jackie had fabricated the incident. According to multiple media, Jackie may have invented the gang rape story in an unsuccessful attempt {{to win the}} affections of a fellow student {{that she had a}} romantic interest in; other sources suggested that PTSD might be a factor in Jackie's creation of the story. Later, Jackie herself said <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>believed</b> her story at the time.|$|E
5|$|Late in the 1950s, Carson {{turned her}} {{attention}} to conservation, especially some problems <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>believed</b> were caused by synthetic pesticides. The result was the book Silent Spring (1962), which brought environmental concerns to an unprecedented share of the American people. Although Silent Spring was met with fierce opposition by chemical companies, it spurred a reversal in national pesticide policy, which led to a nationwide ban on DDT and other pesticides. It also inspired a grassroots environmental movement that {{led to the creation of}} the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Carson was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Jimmy Carter.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} two years of her contract, Bush spent more time on school work than making an album.

5|$|Germanicus {{had died}} in AD 19, in {{somewhat}} suspicious circumstances in Syria. Following his death, his wife Agrippina the Elder returned to Rome with their six children and became increasingly involved {{with a group of}} senators who opposed the growing power of Sejanus. Her relations with Tiberius became increasingly fraught, as she made it clear <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>believed</b> that he was {{responsible for the death of}} Germanicus. The climate was further poisoned by the hatred that Tiberius' mother Livia Drusilla (the widow of Augustus) felt for her, since Agrippina's ambition, to be the mother of emperors and thus Rome's first woman, was an open secret. To Sejanus, Agrippina's sons Nero Caesar, Drusus Caesar and Caligula were a threat to his power.|$|E
5|$|In {{the run-up}} to the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Warren's name was put forward by liberal Democrats as a {{possible}} presidential candidate.

There was much speculation about Warren being added to the Democratic ticket as a vice-presidential candidate. On June 9, 2016, after the California Democratic primary, Warren formally endorsed Hillary Clinton for president. In response to questions when she endorsed Clinton, Warren said <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>believed</b> herself to be ready to be vice president, but she was not being vetted. On July 7, CNN reported that Warren was on a five-person shortlist to be Clinton's vice-presidential running mate. However, Clinton eventually chose Tim Kaine.|$|E
5|$|The {{historian}} Ronald Hutton {{stated that}} the Mari Lwyd tradition appeared to have become defunct in the early 20th century. In {{the middle of that}} century it was revived in Llangynwyd.

Blake also explained <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>believed</b> that the custom was still performed at several villages in the Maesteg area of Glamorgan. During the 1970s, Hole commented that the tradition was still found in Glamorganshire and Carmathenshire.|$|E

His death was, it was claimed, due to the abuse of their stepfather and his mother.
