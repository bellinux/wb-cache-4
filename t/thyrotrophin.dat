A fall in <b>thyrotrophin</b> occurred over several months, accompanied by a concurrent slow rise in serum thyroxine. Those patients with the highest initial values for <b>thyrotrophin</b> showed the typical curvilinear decline in <b>thyrotrophin,</b> whereas the remaining patients disclosed a transient rise in <b>thyrotrophin</b> for the first 3 months.

The significance of <b>thyrotrophin</b> augmentation is uncertain, but it may be more common than generally appreciated. It did not occur in those patients with the most severe degrees of thyroid deficiency. Thyroxine exerts a dual action, and augmentation of <b>thyrotrophin</b> may reflect a dominant effect of increased protein synthesis, in contrast to negative feedback inhibition which suppresses <b>thyrotrophin.</b> These opposing actions are in competition at different dose levels of thyroxine, and may contribute not only to augmentation or suppression of <b>thyrotrophin,</b> but also to the curvi-linear pattern of fall.

40|$|Cell {{proliferation}} and {{the expression of}} differentiated functions are {{generally considered to be}} mutually exclusive states of the cell. <b>Thyrotrophin</b> activates the expression of differentiated functions in dog thyroid cells by means of cyclic AMP. We have recently shown that <b>thyrotrophin</b> also acts through the same intracellular signal molecule to enhance proliferation of dog thyroid cells in primary cultures. In this work we showed that such primary cultures exhibit three successive phases: a latency period during which the expression of differentiated functions (iodide trapping and organification) declined, the cells still being associated with structures derived from the seeded follicles; a cell-proliferation phase with little expression of these functions, the cells being spread in a monolayer; a stationary phase with cell density reaching a plateau but no re-expression of the functions. <b>Thyrotrophin</b> promoted proliferation during the multiplication phase, but induced redifferentiation during the stationary phase. These effects were mimicked by cholera toxin and dibutyryl cyclic AMP, which suggested that they were mediated by cyclic AMP. Iodide uptake was also stimulated by cortisol. <b>Thyrotrophin</b> therefore has a different action in dog thyroid cells depending {{on the state of the}} cells.

40|$|SUMMARY Three {{patients}} with congenital hypothy-roidism missed on routine screening due to normal low <b>thyrotrophin</b> {{concentrations in the}} neonatal period presented in later childhood. Clinicians should remain aware of hypothyroidism {{as a cause of}} morbidity in early childhood despite a national screening programme. Screening for congenital hypothyroidism started in Northern Ireland in January 1980. Over the last five complete years 137 612 infants have been screened and 33 patients diagnosed hypothyroid. The annual incidence of one in 4170 live births is similar to the experience in other European centres. ' During the same period, three {{patients with}} normal screening tests taken between seven and 10 days after birth were diagnosed clinically hypothyroid at 7 - 33 months of age. These patients were born in 1981 when the screening policy was to measure whole blood thyroxine concentrations in duplicate on all samples and follow up the lowest 20 % with an estimation of whole blood <b>thyrotrophin</b> concentra-tions in duplicate. Patients with <b>thyrotrophin</b> con-centrations B 25 mU/l were recalled for examination and further investigation. The screening method was subsequently changed to measuring <b>thyrotrophin</b> concentrations alone on all patients, a practice followed by most centres in the United Kingdom, as it is generally agreed that <b>thyrotrophin</b> screening will identify more patients with hypothyroidism than thyroxine screening. 2 However, the following case reports of patients missed on neonatal screening have important implications when a raised thyro-trophin concentration is used as the only indication for recall.

40|$|The {{effects of}} cranial {{irradiation}} on hypothalamic-pituitary function were followed over a 5 -year period in 31 adult patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The estimated radiotherapy doses to the hypothalamus and pituitary were 3979 ± 78 (± SD) and 6167 ± 122 cGy, respectively. Within 2 years of radiotherapy, significant impairment in the secretion of growth hormone, gonadotrophins, corticotrophin and <b>thyrotrophin</b> were evident and 14 per cent of patients developed hyperprolactinaemia. Using life table analysis, the cumulative probability of endocrine dysfunction {{was estimated to}} be 62 per cent after 5 years with deficiencies in growth hormone, gonadotrophins, corticotrophin and <b>thyrotrophin</b> found in 63. 5, 30. 7, 26. 7 and 14. 9 per cent of patients, respectively. Growth hormone deficiency was the earliest endocrine dysfunction observed. Hyperprolactinaemia was uncommon in the male patients but occurred in five of eight women within 3 years of cranial irradiation. The alterations in gonadotrophin secretion suggest a defect in the pulsatile release of gonadotrophin releasing hormone. Twenty-eight patients developed a hypothalamic pattern of delayed <b>thyrotrophin</b> response to <b>thyrotrophin</b> releasing hormone one year after radiotherapy - four subsequently became hypothyroid. Patients who received radiotherapy for cervical lymph nodes were at greater risk of developing hypothyroidism. Thus, in these patients with no pre-existing disease in the hypothalamic-pituitary region, progressive impairment in hypothalamic pituitary function leading to endocrine dysfunction requiring treatment occurs in 50 per cent of patients 5 years after cranial irradiation. Regular endocrine assessment should be performed in all patients following cranial irradiation. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

All patients ceased to have choreiform movements for approximately 60 minutes during the insulin tolerance test. Four of the patients failed to show clinical features of stress in response to hypoglycaemia. The fasting blood glucose level and blood glucose response to insulin were similar for the two groups. However, the response of plasma cortisol (p less than 0. 05) and of growth hormone (p less than 0. 05) to hypoglycaemia was earlier in patients than controls, though peak responses were the same for each group. The <b>thyrotrophin</b> releasing hormone test revealed no difference in basal levels of thyroid stimulating hormone in either group, or in peak response to <b>thyrotrophin</b> releasing hormone or in the increment at 20 minutes. One of the patients had a delayed response typical of a hypothalamic disorder, whereas none of the controls had such a response. Mean free thyroxine index levels for each group were similar. There was no difference in basal prolactin level, or in the increment or in the peak level in response to <b>thyrotrophin</b> releasing hormone between each group as a whole or when the males and females were analysed separately. Because of small subgroups, the data from the gonadotrophin releasing hormone test were difficult to analyse, but no clear differences or obvious abnormalities emerged.

40|$|Neurotensin (NT) and {{carbachol}} both caused hypothermia when {{injected into}} the periaqueductal grey area (PAG) of rat brain. Atropine prevented carbachol- but not NT-induced hypothermia. NT-induced hypothermia was unaffected by various neurotransmitter agonists and antagonists in the PAG. Both NT antibodies and <b>thyrotrophin</b> releasing hormone prevented carbachol hypothermia. It is concluded that the hypothermic action of carbachol in the PAG is mediated via endogenous NT...|$|E
