5|$|After signing to Def Jam Recordings, Rihanna {{cancelled}} other {{meetings with}} record labels and relocated from Barbados to New York City {{to live with}} Rogers and his wife. Rihanna explained the concept behind {{the title of the}} album to Kidzworld, saying <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> is representative of her native Caribbean culture as well as herself and that the album consists of music from her heritage.|$|E
5|$|Karl von Frisch (1886–1982) {{studied the}} European honey bee, demonstrating that bees can {{recognize}} a desired compass direction {{in three different}} ways: by the sun, by the polarization pattern of the blue sky, and by the earth’s magnetic field. He showed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> is the preferred or main compass; the other mechanisms are used under cloudy skies or inside a dark beehive.|$|E
5|$|Phoenix {{contains}} HE0107-5240, possibly one of {{the oldest}} stars yet discovered. It has around 1/200,000 the metallicity <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> has and hence must have formed very early {{in the history of the}} universe. With a visual magnitude of 15.17, it is around 10,000 times dimmer than the faintest stars visible to the naked eye and is 36000 light years distant.|$|E

50|$|Reanalysis of {{the system}} using {{high-resolution}} spectroscopy yields its two main components to have masses 1.67 ± 0.08, and 0.22 ± 0.07 times <b>that</b> of <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> respectively and radii 1.78 ± 0.03 and 1.22 ± 0.07 times <b>that</b> of <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> respectively. Their surface temperatures are 7300 and 4350 K. The third star has a mass 80% <b>that</b> of <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> and a radius around 83% <b>that</b> of <b>the</b> <b>Sun.</b> A third star in the system is very faint, presumably a red dwarf.|$|R

5|$|The Apex of the Sun's Way, or {{the solar}} apex, is the {{direction}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> travels {{relative to other}} nearby stars. This motion is towards {{a point in the}} constellation Hercules, near the star Vega. Of the 50 nearest stellar systems within 17 light-years from Earth (the closest being the red dwarf Proxima Centauri at approximately 4.2 light-years), the Sun ranks fourth in mass.|$|E
5|$|The {{ecliptic}} is {{the circular}} path on the celestial sphere <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> appears to follow {{over the course}} of a year; it is the basis of the ecliptic coordinate system. The term also refers to the plane of this path, which is coplanar with Earth's orbit around the Sun (and hence the Sun's apparent orbit around Earth).|$|E
5|$|The theory <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> is {{the center}} around which the planets orbit was first {{proposed}} by the ancient Greek Aristarchus of Samos in the 3rd century BC, and later adopted by Seleucus of Seleucia (see Heliocentrism). This view was developed in a more detailed mathematical model of a heliocentric system in the 16th century by Nicolaus Copernicus.|$|E
50|$|This {{was only}} the third season in {{franchise}} history <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Suns</b> were not represented in the All-Star Game, after the 1986 and 1988 seasons.|$|R
5000|$|This {{object is}} more massive than a planet (...) , but less massive than a star (0.0544 MSun). The {{radius of the}} brown dwarf is about that of Jupiter (or one-tenth <b>that</b> of <b>the</b> <b>Sun).</b> Its surface {{temperature}} is 2600 ± 150 K, which is about half <b>that</b> of <b>the</b> <b>Sun.</b> Its luminosity is 0.08-0.05% of <b>that</b> of <b>the</b> <b>Sun.</b> Its age is only 120 million years compared to the Sun's age of 4.68 billion years.|$|R
50|$|BP Crucis {{is around}} 43 times as massive as <b>the</b> <b>Sun,</b> {{it is also}} one of the most {{luminous}} stars known in the Galaxy, with an estimated bolometric luminosity of around 470,000 times <b>that</b> of <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> and a radius 70 times <b>that</b> of <b>the</b> <b>Sun.</b>|$|R
5|$|Despite its {{relative}} brightness (it {{is about a}} fifth as bright as Pluto), Makemake was not discovered until after many much fainter Kuiper belt objects. Most searches for minor planets are conducted relatively close to the ecliptic (the region of the sky <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun,</b> Moon and planets appear to lie in, as seen from Earth), due to the greater likelihood of finding objects there. It probably escaped detection during the earlier surveys due to {{its relative}}ly high orbital inclination, {{and the fact that}} it was at its farthest distance from the ecliptic at the time of its discovery, in the northern constellation of Coma Berenices.|$|E
5|$|Han-era astronomers {{adopted a}} geocentric {{model of the}} universe, theorizing that it was shaped like a sphere {{surrounding}} the earth in the center. They assumed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun,</b> Moon, and planets were spherical and not disc-shaped. They also thought that the illumination of the Moon and planets was caused by sunlight, that lunar eclipses occurred when the Earth obstructed sunlight falling onto the Moon, and that a solar eclipse occurred when the Moon obstructed sunlight from reaching the Earth. Although others disagreed with his model, Wang Chong accurately described the water cycle of the evaporation of water into clouds.|$|E
5|$|However, {{others argue}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> is {{currently}} {{close to the}} galactic plane, and yet the last great extinction event was 15 million years ago. Therefore, the Sun's vertical position cannot alone explain such periodic extinctions, and that extinctions instead occur when the Sun passes through the galaxy's spiral arms. Spiral arms are home not only to larger numbers of molecular clouds, whose gravity may distort the Oort cloud, but also to higher concentrations of bright blue giants, which live for relatively short periods and then explode violently as supernovae.|$|E

50|$|Using an {{evolutionary}} model, the surface temperature of 2MASS 0243-2453 {{is estimated to}} be 1040-1100 K, and its mass is estimated at 2.4-4.1% <b>that</b> of <b>the</b> <b>Sun,</b> its diameter 9.2 to 10.6 <b>that</b> of <b>the</b> <b>Sun,</b> and age 0.4-1.7 billion years.|$|R
50|$|The {{luminosity}} of α Scl {{is around}} 1,500 times <b>that</b> of <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> while its surface temperature is 13,600 K. The radius of Alpha Sculptoris is calculated to be seven times solar while its mass is five times <b>that</b> of <b>the</b> <b>Sun.</b>|$|R
5|$|In 1984, paleontologists David M. Raup and Jack Sepkoski {{suggested}} that extinction events on Earth followed a periodic trend. Richard Muller, {{a professor of}} physics at Berkeley, was part of a team that suggested <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> had an unseen stellar companion which caused this periodicity, with this hypothetical companion being dubbed Nemesis. Muller was already involved in the automated supernova searches underway at Leuschner, and began the search for Nemesis using the optical telescopes at Leuschner Observatory.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, the 1963 statute {{came under}} {{criticism}} because it states {{the sun in}} the state seal is setting rather than rising. A thorough investigation by the Indiana Historical Bureau {{into the history of}} the seal led to the discovery that original seal was created with the intention <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> should, in fact, be depicted as rising. In both 2004 and 2005 legislation was introduced to change the wording of the statute, but as of 2008 no action had been taken to correct the error.|$|E
5|$|In roughly 5billion years, the Sun will {{cool and}} expand outward to many times its current {{diameter}} (becoming a red giant), before casting off its outer layers as a planetary nebula and {{leaving behind a}} stellar remnant known as a white dwarf. In the far distant future, the gravity of passing stars will gradually reduce the Sun's retinue of planets. Some planets will be destroyed, others ejected into interstellar space. Ultimately, {{over the course of}} tens of billions of years, it is likely <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> will be left with none of the original bodies in orbit around it.|$|E
50|$|Kepler-42's mass is {{estimated}} to be 0.13 times <b>that</b> of <b>the</b> <b>Sun,</b> and to have a radius 0.17 times <b>that</b> of <b>the</b> <b>Sun,</b> <b>that</b> is, just 1.7 times <b>that</b> of <b>the</b> gas giant Jupiter. Due to its small radius and hence surface area, the luminosity of Kepler-42 is only 0.24% of <b>that</b> of <b>the</b> <b>Sun.</b> Its metallicity is one third of <b>the</b> <b>Sun.</b> Kepler-42 has an appreciable proper motion of up to 431±8 mas/yr. Due to its small size and low temperature, the star's habitable zone is much closer to the star than Earth is to <b>the</b> <b>Sun.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Aa {{component}} has {{a surface}} temperature of 4900 kelvins, {{a diameter of}} 35 times <b>that</b> of <b>the</b> <b>Sun,</b> and a luminosity 600 times <b>that</b> of <b>the</b> <b>Sun.</b> <b>The</b> Ab component's unseen companion, Beta Capricorni Ac, orbits Ab with an orbital period of 8.7 days.|$|R

5|$|Initially, {{his major}} {{interest}} was {{the theory of}} the continuous spectrum and his first published paper, in 1926, concerned the quantum theory of molecular band spectra. He developed a method to carry out calculations of its transition probabilities. He calculated the photoelectric effect for hydrogen and X-rays, obtaining the absorption coefficient at the K-edge. His calculations accorded with observations of the X-ray absorption of the sun, but not helium. Years later it was realized <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> was largely composed of hydrogen and that his calculations were indeed correct.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter's {{internal}} {{magnetic field}} prevents the solar wind, {{a stream of}} ionized particles emitted by the Sun, from interacting directly with its atmosphere, and instead diverts {{it away from the}} planet, effectively creating a cavity in the solar wind flow, called a magnetosphere, composed of a plasma {{different from that of the}} solar wind. The Jovian (i.e. pertaining to Jupiter) magnetosphere is so large <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> and its visible corona would fit inside it with room to spare. If one could see it from Earth, it would appear five times larger than the full moon in the sky despite being nearly 1700 times farther away.|$|E
5|$|Most large {{objects in}} orbit around the Sun lie near the plane of Earth's orbit, known as the ecliptic. The planets {{are very close to}} the ecliptic, whereas comets and Kuiper belt objects are {{frequently}} at significantly greater angles to it. All the planets, and most other objects, orbit the Sun in the same direction <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> is rotating (counter-clockwise, as viewed from above Earth's north pole). There are exceptions, such as Halley's Comet.|$|E
50|$|Iota2 Normae is an B9.5V blue-white main {{sequence}} star with an effective temperature of 10593 Kelvin. It has an apparent visual magnitude of +5.57.

50|$|The bright naked-eye star is a blue-white {{giant of}} {{spectral}} class B9, with {{a temperature of}} 10,500 K.

5|$|Nri people {{believed}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> was the dwelling place of Anyanwu (Light) and Agbala (Fertility). Agbala was the collective spirit of all holy beings (human and nonhuman). Agbala {{was the perfect}} agent of Chukwu or Chineke (the Creator God) and chose its human and nonhuman agents only by their merit; it knew no politics. It transcended religion, culture and gender, and worked with the humble and the truthful. They believed Anyanwu, The Light, to be the symbol of human perfection that all must seek and Agbala was entrusted to lead man there.|$|E
5|$|On January 28, 1905, {{an article}} {{ran in the}} Indianapolis News {{containing}} information {{on the origin of}} the seal, some of it dubious. The article received much attention and started an informal inquiry into the history of the seal, and namely to discover if the sun in the seal was rising or setting. Jacob Piatt Dunn, the preeminent Indiana historian of the time, consulted several history and arrived at the conclusion <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> was rising. Dunn cited the fact the state was young, and the mountains were to the east of the state, not the west—clearly indicating the sun was rising.|$|E
