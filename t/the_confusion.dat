5|$|Adding to <b>the</b> <b>confusion</b> is the {{tendency}} of units (again for historical reasons) to misuse titles for larger administrative structures. Although the Royal Artillery consists of 13 Regular regiments (equivalent to infantry battalions), it calls itself the Royal Regiment of Artillery when referring to the units as a whole. The Royal Logistic Corps and Intelligence Corps are not corps-sized, but consist of several battalions or regiments.|$|E
5|$|Christian Renoux, {{a history}} {{professor}} at the University of Orléans, published in French in 2001 a book-length study of the prayer and its origins, clearing up much of <b>the</b> <b>confusion</b> that had accumulated previously. The Franciscan journal Frate Francesco and the Vatican newspaper L'Osservatore Romano published articles in Italian summarizing the book's findings, and Renoux published an online abstract in English at The Franciscan Archive.|$|E
5|$|Davout, seeing <b>the</b> <b>confusion,</b> {{personally}} led the 57th Line Regiment (Le Terrible) {{forward until}} he had his horse shot from under him; he fell so hard that General Sorbier reported him as dead. General Rapp arrived to replace him, only to find Davout alive and leading the 57th forward again. Rapp then led the 61stLine Regiment forward when he was wounded (for the 22ndtime in his career).|$|E

5|$|For {{many years}} there was {{confusion}} between B.verticillata and B.littoralis (swamp banksia). Until 1984, {{the latter was}} circumscribed as encompassing what is now Banksia seminuda (river banksia), which has whorled leaves like B.verticillata.

5|$|Prior to 1945 (when Pius XII {{changed the}} form of ballot to use {{anonymous}} oaths, first carried out in 1958), the sealing wax on the complex type ballots illustrated above {{had the effect of}} making the smoke from burning the ballots either black or white, depending on whether or not damp straw was added. Until the 20th century, sealing wax customarily had beeswax mixed into its composition. The use of wax made solely from animal fat does not give as much white colored smoke, as does wax that includes beeswax. In the 1939 conclave there was some confusion over the smoke color, which was even more apparent in the 1958 conclave. This explains <b>the</b> <b>confusion</b> over the color of the smoke in the 1958 Papal conclave, caused by the lack of sealing wax on the ballots. The Siri thesis was based on <b>the</b> <b>confusion</b> over the smoke color {{on the first day of}} that conclave.|$|E

5|$|The Swedish {{fled the}} island {{as a result}} of <b>the</b> <b>confusion</b> and fear amongst the conscripts; Jens Kofoed {{installed}} an intermediate rule and sent a message to King Frederick III of Denmark that Bornholm had liberated itself, and wished to return to Danish rule.

5|$|Adding to {{the chaos}} were {{fears of a}} {{potential}} second explosion. A cloud of steam shot out of ventilators at the ammunition magazine at Wellington Barracks as naval personnel extinguished a fire by the magazine. While the fire was quickly put out, the cloud was seen from blocks away and quickly led to rumours that another explosion was imminent. Uniformed officers ordered everyone away from the area. As the rumour spread across the city, many families fled their homes. <b>The</b> <b>confusion</b> hampered efforts for over two hours until fears were dispelled by about noon. However, many rescuers ignored the evacuation and naval rescue parties continued working uninterrupted at the harbour.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we analyze <b>the</b> <b>confusions</b> {{patterns}} {{at three}} {{places in the}} hybrid phoneme recognition system. <b>The</b> <b>confusions</b> are analyzed at the pronunciation, the posterior probability, and the phoneme recognizer levels. <b>The</b> <b>confusions</b> show significant structure that is similar at all levels. Some confusions also correlate with human psychoacoustic experiments in white masking noise. These structures imply that not all errors should be counted equally and that some phoneme distinctions are arbitrary. Understanding these confusion patterns can improve {{the performance of a}} recognizer by eliminating problematic phoneme distinctions. These principles are applied to a phoneme recognition system and the results show a marked improvement in the phone error rate. Confusion pattern analysis leads to a better way of choosing phoneme sets for recognition. Index Terms: error analysis, confusion patterns, phoneme recognizer 1...|$|R
5|$|After this, the 22nd Brigade {{moved back}} towards the {{junction}} of Holland and Ulu Padan Roads. Moving while under heavy fire, the battalion established itself in its new position before 9:00am, but in <b>the</b> <b>confusion</b> of the move, some men found themselves separated from the main body and cut off. In the afternoon, after the brigade position was reoriented to the west, the battalion was placed in reserve. The battalion's positions in the north, situated on the high ground, experienced heavy attack from Japanese aircraft and artillery, as the brigade—supported by Australian and British artillery—fought off two regiments from the Japanese 18th Division {{during the course of}} the night of 11/12 February.|$|E
5|$|Another factor behind Echmarcach's {{actions against}} Sitriuc could concern Knútr. Echmarcach's seizure of Dublin {{occurred}} {{only a year}} after the latter's death in 1035. There appears to be numismatic evidence, annalistic evidence, and charter evidence indicating that Knútr and Sitriuc had cooperated together in terms of trade and military operations in Wales. In contrast to this apparent congeniality, the relationship between Knútr and Echmarcach appears to have been less amiable. In fact, it is possible that Echmarcach's meeting with Knútr may have bound him from taking action against Sitriuc, and that <b>the</b> <b>confusion</b> caused by Knútr's demise may have enabled Echmarcach to exploit the situation by seizing control of the Irish Sea region.|$|E
5|$|As both battalions {{headed for}} the railway line, gliders {{carrying}} the 1st Polish Parachute Brigade's vehicles and artillery arrived at landing zone 'L'. The KOSB still defending the area were holding out against repeated German attacks but the landing ground was in range of the Germans guns. At the same time 10 Para, closely followed by German armoured vehicles and under mortar fire, reached the clearing. The leading companies had just cleared the woods and started across open ground when the gliders arrived. In <b>the</b> <b>confusion,</b> with both groups under fire, each thought {{the other was the}} enemy and began shooting back. The Polish anti-tank battery was virtually destroyed and although some vehicles got away the majority of their guns were trapped in the burning gliders. Some of the pursuing German troops tried to cross the landing zone only to suffer heavy casualties {{at the hands of the}} defending KOSB companies. In <b>the</b> <b>confusion,</b> 'A' Company KOSB, covering the withdrawal of 10 Para, was cut off and eventually forced to surrender.|$|E

5|$|At {{the reunification}} summit, the {{president}} personally requested Hyun-jun {{to be at}} his side. Concurrently, NSS agents realized they've been duped: the presumed dead IRIS agents at the mall crisis was actually the hostages.

Unfortunately, it failed with Seung-hee's interference. She pretended to be an IRIS agent and used <b>the</b> <b>confusion</b> to stop them. This created mass panic as IRIS agents make their stand against all security forces. Ultimately, the SK president and NK forces survived the assault and Hyun-jun saved the day again.|$|E
