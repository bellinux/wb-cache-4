The aim {{of the present study}} was to examine whether the associations between self-reported screen <b>time</b> <b>and</b> breaks in screen <b>time</b> <b>and</b> accelerometer assessed sedentary <b>time</b> <b>and</b> breaks in sedentary time were moderated by gender, ethnicity, children’s moderate-to vigorous physical activity (MVPA), parents’ educational level, parents’ screen <b>time</b> <b>and</b> breaks in screen <b>time</b> <b>and</b> parents physical activity (PA). Methods: Screen <b>time</b> <b>and</b> breaks in screen time were assessed with questionnaires in a sample of 445 children (10 - 12 years) in Belgium, Greece, Hungary and Norway. Parents’ screen time, breaks in screen <b>time,</b> parents’ PA <b>and</b> demographics were also assessed with questionnaires. Accelerometers measured sedentary <b>time</b> per day <b>and</b> breaks in sedentary <b>time</b> per day <b>and</b> MVPA (children only). Bivariate and multivariate linear regression analyses were applied to assess the associations between the independent variables and the dependent variables. Interaction terms were added in the final model to examine whether the associations between self-reported screen <b>time</b> <b>and</b> breaks in screen <b>time</b> <b>and</b> accelerometer assessed sedentary <b>time</b> <b>and</b> breaks in sedentary time were moderated by the significant independent variables. Results: No statistical significant interactions were found between the significant independent variables. Country specific significant associations were found between self-reported screen <b>time</b> <b>and</b> gender, parents’ screen time, parents’ educational level and accelerometer assessed sedentary time. Country specific associations were found between self-reported breaks during one hour of screen <b>time</b> <b>and</b> parents’ educational level and ethnicity. Conclusion: The associations between self-reported screen <b>time</b> <b>and</b> breaks in screen <b>time</b> <b>and</b> accelerometer assessed sedentary <b>time</b> <b>and</b> breaks were not moderated by gender, ethnicity, MVPA, parents’ educational level, parents’ self-reported screen <b>time</b> <b>and</b> breaks in screen <b>time</b> <b>and</b> parents’ PA.

Control on measurement correctness is performed by the All-Union State Standard calibration service. The hardware of most of the above-mentioned systems is provided by the instruments developed by our institute. A common scientific and technological approach allowed us to create a unified system of time-frequency equipment composed of widely used serial instruments, sets, automated systems and complexes. Primary frequency standards of different classes, <b>time</b> <b>and</b> frequency references and instruments are based on the unified system.
