2500|$|Mount Robson (...) is {{the highest}} peak in the Canadian Rockies, but not the highest in British Columbia, since there are some higher {{mountains}} in the Coast Mountains and Saint Elias Mountains. However, Mount Robson is particularly impressive because it stands out on the continental divide towering over Yellowhead Pass, {{one of the lowest}} passes in the Canadian Rockies, and is close to the Yellowhead Highway. Its base is only 985m above sea level, meaning it has a <b>total</b> <b>vertical</b> relief of 2,969m or nearly 10,000 feet. In addition, it rises the 3km to its summit in a distance of only 4km from its base at Kinney Lake. Climbing Mount Robson is a challenge suitable for experienced and well-prepared mountaineers, and usually requires a week on the mountain.|$|E

2500|$|Seepage in {{an upward}} {{direction}} reduces the effective stress within the soil. When the water pressure {{at a point}} in the soil is equal to the <b>total</b> <b>vertical</b> stress at that point, the effective stress is zero and the soil has no frictional resistance to deformation. For a surface layer, the vertical effective stress becomes zero within the layer when the upward hydraulic gradient is equal to the critical gradient. At zero effective stress soil has very little strength and layers of relatively impermeable soil may heave up due to the underlying water pressures. [...] The loss in strength due to upward seepage is a common contributor to levee failures. The condition of zero effective stress associated with upward seepage is also called liquefaction, quicksand, or a boiling condition. Quicksand was so named because the soil particles move around and appear to be 'alive' (the biblical meaning of 'quick' – as opposed to 'dead'). (Note that {{it is not possible to}} be 'sucked down' into quicksand. [...] On the contrary, you would float with about half your body out of the water.) ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a methodology {{to compare the}} energy benefit that may result from the adoption of two very dfferent facade technologies in non-domestic buildings. A comparison is made of the energy benefit that might result from: (a) replacing conventional glass with electrochromic glazing; and, (b) installing PV panels across the opaque sections of vertical facade. The energy benefit from electrochromic glazing is predicted {{on the basis of}} displaced electric lighting usage against standard glazing with blinds, whereas the energy benefit from facade PV panels is equal to their delivered electrical output. The evaluation setting is a 'typical' six metre deep perimeter office space with vertical glazing. Office orientations {{for each of the four}} cardinal compass points are considered. Performance evaluations are founded on a full year's hourly meteorological data for fourteen locales across the world. The predicted energy benefit from electrochromic glazing and facade PV are related to the <b>total</b> annual <b>vertical</b> irradiation incident on the building facade. The findings indicate that the energy benefit that results from replacing standard glazing with electrochromic glazing may exceed that of facade PV for the majority of cases studied. Surprisingly, electrochromic glazings are found to provide the greatest energy benefit for those cases at the lower end of the experienced range in <b>total</b> annual <b>vertical</b> irradiation. The effectiveness of widespread deployment across multiple facades for each locale is examined. The likelihood that electrochromic glazing alone can offer sufficient solar protection without recourse to additional shading is assessed using the recently formulated useful daylight illuminance scheme...|$|R

In effect, it aids in the progression of the contralateral side through reduced hip flexion and extension.

This notion of reduction of metabolic cost may be disputed by a study done by Gard and Childress (1997), who stated {{that there may be}} minimal effect of pelvic rotation on vertical COM displacement.
