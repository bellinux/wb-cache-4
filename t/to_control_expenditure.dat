40|$|It is an {{interesting}} aspect of the current debate with regard to healthcare in developed countries that the discussion starts with the finance of healthcare. What makes it interesting is that, {{with the exception of}} the US, healthcare is predominantly financed by government through a combination of a social welfare contribution and general taxation. There is some private financing through private insurance, but tax benefits for insurance and the universality attaching to most public systems effectively means that the government is financing health expenditure. In almost no other area of Government expenditure would we be considering the question of financing as financing is simply a function of taxation. The question of financing healthcare is thus a deeper one than simply that of financing and owes its origin to the rapid growth of expenditure on healthcare over the past 30 years, and the realisation that as population ages, claims on resources will increase over the next 30 years. the finance of healthcare is in fact a topic which is not really about finance, but about the means that can be used <b>to</b> <b>control</b> <b>expenditure</b> to ensure that taxes do not have to be raised.

Little {{is known about the}} influence of the shifting Medicaid managed care arena on treatment decisions. This paper investigates factors affecting the selection of treatments for depression by providers participating in either of two Medicaid managed care programs. Of particular interest is the influence of medication price on the choice of treatment, since one vehicle through which managed care organizations can reduce total expenditures is by increasing the price sensitivity of participating providers. We take a new approach by phrasing the problem as a discrete choice, using a nested multinomial logit model for the analyses. Contrary to earlier literature, we find some evidence that physicians in both programs do take price into consideration when selecting among treatment options. HMO providers in particular demonstrate increased price sensitivity in the two most commonly prescribed categories of antidepressants. Copyright © 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. ...|$|R

40|$|It is {{increasingly}} impossible {{to understand and}} explain the shape and delivery of contemporary social policy unless we consider the role of business. Several factors have been at work here. First, many {{of the changes in}} social policy introduced since the 1970 s have been in response either to business demands or more general concerns about national competitiveness and the needs of business. Second, globalisation has increased corporate power within states, leading to transformations in social and fiscal policies. Third, business has been incorporated into the management of many areas of the welfare state by governments keen <b>to</b> <b>control</b> <b>expenditure</b> and introduce private sector values into services. Fourth, welfare services, from hospitals to schools, have been increasingly opened up to private markets. Despite all this, the issues of business influence and involvement in social policy has been neglected in the literature.

However the lack of effective coordination between the 24 donors has meant that the impact of the whole effort on the transformation process has only been marginal. The European Union's assistance has consisted of grants, balance-of-payments loans and structural loans from the European Investment Bank, The most visible element has been the Phare Programme, which has committed around ECU 6, 5 billion over the last six years.

An assessment of the Phare Programme has not been completed yet by the European Commission. Although many initiatives have been started in the region by Phare, a provisional assessment suggests that the programme could certainly have been run more efficiently.

A series of pilot projects begun in 300 rural counties in 2003 subsequently evolved into the New Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS) {{on the national level}} (Zhang et al. 2010). Restricted to rural participants, NCMS offers very basic subsidized insurance to households.
