5|$|The episode also {{marks the}} upgrade of several {{returning}} characters {{to the main}} cast. John Bradley-West returns as Jon Snow's friend Sam Tarly, James Cosmo as the Lord Commander of the Night's Watch Jeor Mormont, Jerome Flynn as Tyrion's cunning servant Bronn, with Sibel Kekilli as Tyrion's concubine Shae, and lastly Conleth Hill as the gossiping eunuch Varys. Peter Dinklage {{takes the place of}} Sean Bean as the first credit during the intro sequence. Since Bean's character was killed at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>last</b> <b>season,</b> Dinklage jokingly wished that he could stay being the lead credit for some time.|$|E
5|$|York {{were beaten}} 3–2 away by Leyton Orient, {{who took a}} two-goal lead through Mathieu Baudry and Jay Simpson before Oliver {{equalised}} in first-half stoppage time. Orient restored their two-goal advantage through Simpson in the second half, and Oliver scored a consolation goal with a header in the 86th minute. York were beaten 6–0 away by Portsmouth, in which Greening was sent off before half-time for catching Michael Doyle with his elbow, before Ben Davies and Marc McNulty gave the home team the lead {{early in the second}} half. McNulty scored two more goals before Ben Tollitt and Conor Chaplin finished the scoring for Portsmouth; this result saw York drop into the relegation zone {{for the first time in}} 2015–16. York signed five players before the deadline for loan transfers: defenders Mark Kitching from Middlesbrough and Stefan O'Connor from Arsenal, midfielders Jordan Lussey from Bolton Wanderers and Kenny McEvoy from Tottenham Hotspur, and striker Bradley Fewster from Middlesbrough. Winger Danny Galbraith, released by Gillingham at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>last</b> <b>season,</b> was signed before the deadline for free transfers. Collins, Morris, Turner and Tutonda were sent back to their parent clubs. York suffered another heavy defeat after losing 5–1 at home to Accrington, who were two goals up at half-time with goals from Matty Pearson and Billy Kee. Josh Windass scored a penalty for Accrington after O'Connor tripped Tom Davies, and Kee scored their fourth before Fewster scored for York with a shot into the bottom corner on 75 minutes. Shay McCartan finished the scoring for Accrington late into the match, and the result meant York equalled a club record of eight straight defeats.|$|E
25|$|Johnson {{came into}} 2017 as the {{defending}} Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series champion. The {{start of the}} season didn't go as smoothly as <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>last</b> <b>season,</b> however. Through the first six races of the season, Johnson only managed to score one top ten finish. He rebounded with back to back wins at the 2017 O'Reilly Auto Parts 500 in Texas and the 2017 Food City 500 at Bristol. This would be the 14th time he has won back-to-back races in his career. Johnson then finished just outside the top ten at Richmond, even after colliding with his teammate Dale Earnhardt Jr earlier in the race. Johnson scored his third win of the season at Dover in June after beating Kyle Larson in an overtime finish. This was Johnson's 11th win at Dover and 83rd career win, which tied him with Cale Yarborough.|$|E

"Towards <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>last</b> <b>season,</b> where I {{said the}} best is yet to come, I {{strongly}} felt that way because towards <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>last</b> <b>season</b> we closed out the season strong. I knew that was a catalyst to really turn up the team, {{to get a little}} bit more out of everyone. Denny goes down with his knee injury. He comes back, obviously not 100 percent. The team steps up. We narrow the gap to try to pick him up knowing he's not going to be there, and we start winning races, even with a driver that is not 100 percent. Now that he's coming back healthier each week, we're winning more and more. I simply think that's the catalyst for us to move forward. It's easier when the morale is high {{to get a little bit}} more out of your guys. Our benchmark is ourselves and we're just trying to work on that." ...|$|E

Rhimes {{disclosed that}} the main concept for the episode was to [...] "go in places the audience can imagine, but doesn't expect", {{in an attempt to}} [...] "freshen up" [...] the series for the new season. Rhimes stated that she originally planned to move the timeline three months after the conclusion of the second season, but the process did not occur, due to her not wanting the audience to miss significant moments from the character's complex lives. [...] "I feel like so much happened at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>last</b> <b>season</b> that I owe it to the characters to have them deal with the aftermath. And I owe it to the audience to let them watch the aftermath", stated Rhimes, in response to her decision to continue the storyline from where the previous season left off. Rhimes also described the prominence which Grey's underwear has in the first episode of the season, noting how they are [...] "a key element" [...] in the development of her character: [...] "Meredith never put them back on. She rushed out to deal with Izzie and left Derek who was asking what that meant, and she {{never had a chance to}} put those panties back on." [...] Prior to the episode's broadcast, Rhimes described it as achieving a balance between the aftermath of the recent events and the past experiences that define each character. In addition, she noted how the episode marked the transition to a new chapter in the personal backgrounds of the protagonists, stating: [...] "It was mean to bring us to a place where we can say goodbye to Denny, as well as deal with Meredith's love triangle. Just remember that nothing is ever wrapped up easily on this show. Because things aren't neat and clean in real life." ...|$|E

2500|$|The last glacial {{period is}} {{sometimes}} colloquially {{referred to as}} the [...] "last ice age", though this use is incorrect because an ice age is a longer period of cold temperature in which ice sheets cover large parts of the Earth, such as Antarctica. Glacials, on the other hand, refer to colder phases within an ice age that separate interglacials. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> glacial period is not <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> ice age. <b>The</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> glacial period was about 11,700 years ago, while <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> ice age has not yet come.|$|R
