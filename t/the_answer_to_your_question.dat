Exaggerated accounts of your purpose have been laid before government by the information of a traitor in your own counsels; and I was sent down post to take the command of a sufficient number of troops, in case these calumnies should be found to have any real foundation. I have come here, of course, sufficiently supported both with cavalry and infantry, to do whatever might be necessary; but my commands are--and I am sure they agree with my inclination--to make no arrests, nay, to make no further inquiries of any kind, if this good assembly will consider their own interest so far as to give up their immediate purpose, and return quietly home to their own houses.' ...|$|E

Ned Markosian has shown that the task is trickier than it might seem.

Let's see whether we can do any better than that.

40|$|WHFoods: What {{foods are}} best for {{enhancing}} memory? What foods {{are best for}} enhancing memory? It's too simple to single out our particular food (or foods) as being "best " for memory. Memory is too complicated a process, and it requires {{a greater variety of}} nutrients than any single food can provide. Since remembering involves a good bit of brain activity, and brain activity puts special emphasis on a healthy nervous system and healthy blood flow, all steps you can take to improve your blood flow, circulation, and nervous system function may end up contributing to better memory. Because we feel that <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>question</b> about memory is more inclusive than just fruits and vegetables, we are going to answer it from that perspective. A first important step would be upgrading the overall fat quality in your meal plan. You'll want to focus on plant foods like walnuts, flaxseeds, cold water fish like salmon, and oils like extra virgin olive oil, because the types of fat contained in these foods help keep your blood vessels and nerve wrappings healthy.
