Audrey contacts Lewis again and invites him {{to have dinner with}} her, but she becomes apprehensive and pretends to be ill when he arrives. Lewis persuades Audrey to let him into her home and he listens while she <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> <b>her</b> late husband. They then go out for dinner. Lewis visits the Rovers Return in Coronation Street and pretends not to know Audrey. Norris Cole (Malcolm Hebden) recognises Lewis from the Christmas party and when he sees Lewis kissing Audrey, he jumps to the conclusion that they are having an affair.|$|E

In the first, a minute-long clip, Ron tries {{to take a job}} offer that was previously offered to him at an Internet flower company web site, but when he finds the business is doing so poorly, he sadly realizes he will be in his government job for a long time. In a second minute-long clip, Leslie <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> <b>her</b> very detailed life plan, which involves eventually becoming head of the parks department, then governor of Indiana, then U.S. vice president and then getting married at age 84.

5|$|Von Stroheim's {{original}} edit contained {{two main}} sub-plots that were later cut. The point of these sub-plots was to contrast two possible outcomes of Trina and McTeague's life together. The first depicted {{the lives of}} the junkman Zerkow and Maria Miranda Macapa, the young Mexican woman who collects junk for Zerkow and sold Trina the lottery ticket. Maria often <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> <b>her</b> imaginary solid gold dining set with Zerkow, who becomes obsessed by it. Eventually, believing she has riches hidden away, Zerkow marries her. He often asks about it, but she gives a different answer each time he mentions it. Zerkow does not believe her and becomes obsessed with prying the truth from her. He murders her and after having lost his mind, leaps into San Francisco Bay.|$|E

Arthur's behaviour never improves, and he insults Charlotte for being ugly. Finally, on the third evening, Charlotte promises Arthur something he won't forget, and enters his room wearing a skimpy outfit looking mischievous.

Various characters suspected of belonging to the American Communist Party appear before the House Committee on Un-American Activities for interrogation. Marilyn calls Doctor Johnson on the phone and <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> <b>her</b> irrational fears of going insane, her feelings of loneliness, emptiness, and depersonalization. In the background books are being burned, including those by Wilhelm Reich. The psychiatrist, on the brink of madness, is taken off to prison.

25|$|After her {{conversion}} to the Bábí faith, the poems of Táhirih flourished. In most she <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> <b>her</b> longing {{to meet the}} Báb. Her poetry illustrates an impressive knowledge of Persian and Arabic literature which Táhirih possessed, seldom seen in a woman in mid-nineteenth century Iran. One {{of the most famous}} poems attributed to her is named Point by Point. Although it is widely considered her signature poem and a masterpiece, it has been claimed by Mohit Tabátabá'i to be older and by someone else – though in making this claim he offered no proof and any argument to the contrary is not possible in Iran. When Táhirih was killed, hostile family members suppressed or destroyed her remaining poems, whilst her others were spread across Iran. It has been suggested that Táhirih had little interest in putting her poems in print. `Abdu'l-Bahá recalls that when he was aged five Táhirih would chant her poetry to him in her beautiful voice. Edward Granville Browne procured her poems from Bábí, Bahá'í and Azali sources and published them in his book A Year Amongst the Persians.|$|E
25|$|Mary and Cathleen {{return home}} from their {{drive to the}} drugstore, where Mary has sent Cathleen in to {{purchase}} her morphine prescription. Not wanting to be alone, Mary does not allow Cathleen {{to go to the}} kitchen to finish dinner and offers her a drink instead. Mary does most of the talking and discusses her love for fog but her hatred of the foghorn and her husband’s obvious obsession with money. It is obvious that Mary has already taken some of her “prescription.” She <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> <b>her</b> past in a Catholic convent and the promise she once had as a pianist {{and the fact that it}} was once thought that she might become a nun. She also makes it clear that while she fell in love with her husband from the time she met him, she had never taken to the theatre crowd. She shows her arthritic hands to Cathleen and explains that the pain in her hands is why she needs her prescription – an explanation which is untrue and transparent to Cathleen.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed reviews. The London Free Press listed {{it as one}} of the [...] "best bets" [...] {{to watch}} the evening it originally aired. Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said the small-town government setting and story lines of the show were working, but felt the writing for the Leslie character has been uneven and that individual situations involving her in [...] "The Reporter" [...] were not funny or effective. Matt Fowler of IGN said the Leslie character was funny, particularly when she <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> <b>her</b> failure to remove graffiti penises from a city wall. ("To this day, I am haunted by those remaining penises.") But Fowler said the Scrabble subplot between Tom and Ron was [...] "silly," [...] and said the Ron character is too one-note and unfunny.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, {{back in the}} office, Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) {{begins to}} write invitations for her {{approaching}} wedding with help from Ryan Howard (B. J.

Kelly <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> <b>her</b> dreams of getting married someday and is visibly hurt when Ryan responds to her flirtatious question about future weddings by saying he doesn't think he'll ever tie the knot; when Kelly leaves the room, Pam advises Ryan to be considerate of Kelly's feelings but Ryan curtly notes [...] "I know what I said." [...] Jim makes plans for a vacation anywhere away from Scranton. While that is going on, the other employees subtly duel over the thermostat. At {{the end of the}} episode, Jim tells Pam that he will be going to Australia and unfortunately, he will be missing her wedding because of it.|$|E
500|$|In general, [...] "I Hate December" [...] has {{a darker}} theme that is rarely heard in Christmas music. Durand <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> <b>her</b> fears of death, singing: [...] "All I {{know is what}} I dream / But lately dreams have been such scary things / Of suicide and frozen ice over my pale body". Trouser Press editor Ira A. Robbins joked that with Lately, Ivy was {{attempting}} to bring French pop music back into the American music industry. In his book The Trouser Press Guide to '90s Rock, Robbins and Vickie Gilmer summarized it as an [...] "original [...] wah-wahing" [...] song recorded in the [...] "City of Lights". On an episode of the MTV2 music program 120 Minutes, Schlesinger described the message behind [...] "I Hate December" [...] as [...] "anti-Christian". In response, host Matt Pinfield compared the lyrics and inspiration behind [...] "I Hate December" [...] to [...] "that Fear single [...] years ago" [...] (referring to that band's 1982 single [...] "Fuck Christmas").|$|E

500|$|It is night time, and as Dot Branning (June Brown) makes {{herself a}} cup of cocoa at home, she records a message on a tape {{recorder}} for her husband Jim (John Bardon), who is in hospital recovering from a stroke. Dot tells Jim everyone is missing him, and {{that she has been}} dreading recording the message. She <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> <b>her</b> Christian faith and remembers her childhood, her first marriage to Charlie Cotton (Christopher Hancock) and her friendship with Ethel Skinner (Gretchen Franklin). She talks about when she was evacuated to Wales during the Second World War and how she did not cry when she left her mother. She says she was happy moving away to live with her guardians, a Welsh couple named Gwen and Will, as they made her feel special, and recalls the happiest day of her life. She remembers how Will would sing [...] "Pretty Baby" [...] to her at night, but says since then everyone she has cared about has died. She finishes by telling Jim that the hospital staff want to send him home, but she fears she {{will not be able to}} cope and concludes she is better on her own.|$|E
