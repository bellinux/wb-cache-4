[...] Vinnie Mancuso, writing for New York Observer, criticized the show and felt: [...] "roughly one iota of shadenfreudic pleasure from this endeavor, {{but for the most part}} this show is the 100% drizzling poops." [...] David Hinckley of the New York Daily News, reviewing the tenth season, said that [...] "even when you think something about the Kardashians could be interesting, it's not," [...] adding that the [...] "entertainment value [...] is like having spent 10 years in Rapid City, S.D., watching the traffic lights change." [...] Amy Amatangelo of The Hollywood Reporter said that [...] "in true Kardashian fashion, they managed to make everything about them," [...] after Caitlyn Jenner came out as a trans woman to her family in the [...] "About Bruce" [...] special aired as part of the tenth season. Amatangelo felt that the conversations [...] "seemed a little too staged, too controlled", and noted that [...] "there was no attempt to educate the viewers about transgender issues." ...|$|E
