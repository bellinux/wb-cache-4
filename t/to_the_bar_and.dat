5|$|In 1939, Rougier {{was called}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bar,</b> <b>and</b> {{the family moved}} first to Brighton, then to Hove, so that Rougier could easily commute to London. The {{following}} year, they sent their son to a preparatory school, creating an additional expense for Heyer. The Blitz bombing of 1940–41 disrupted train travel in Britain, prompting Heyer and her family to move to London in 1942 so that Rougier would be closer to his work.|$|E

5|$|The Inn {{continued}} to prosper {{during the reign}} of James I (1603–1625) and the beginning of that of Charles I, when over 100 students per year were recorded as joining. The outbreak of the First English Civil War in 1642 {{during the reign of}} Charles I disrupted the systems of legal education and governance at the Inns of Court, shutting down all calls <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bar</b> <b>and</b> new admissions, and Gray's Inn never fully recovered. Fortunes {{continued to}} decline after the English Restoration, which saw the end of the traditional method of legal education. Although now more prosperous, Gray's Inn is today the smallest of the Inns of Court.|$|E
5|$|With Grace's support, Carroll {{was able}} to attend school in France—at Lille and at the University of Douai—where he studied the humanities, philosophy, and civil and canon law. By May 1685, Carroll had moved to London, where he {{registered}} to study English common law and was accepted into the Inner Temple, {{one of the four}} Inns of Court that are able to call members <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> <b>and</b> enable them to practice law. According to family tradition, Carroll secured a position as clerk to William Herbert, 1st Marquess of Powis, an Englishman who was one of two Catholic peers in the court of James II.|$|E

5|$|Gray's Inn's {{internal}} records {{date from}} 1569, {{at which point}} there were four types of member; {{those who had not}} yet been called to the Bar, Utter Barristers, Ancients and Readers. Utter Barristers were those who had been called to the Bar but were still studying, Ancients were those who were called <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bar</b> <b>and</b> were allowed to practise and Readers were those who had been called to the Bar, were allowed to practise and now played a part in educating law students at the Inns of Chancery and at Gray's Inn itself. At the time Gray's Inn was the odd one out amongst the Inns; the others did not recognise Ancients as a degree of barrister and had Benchers roughly corresponding to the Readers used at Gray's Inn (although the positions were not identical).|$|E
5|$|In 1886, Laffoon {{moved to}} Washington, D.C. {{to live with}} his uncle, U.S. Representative Polk Laffoon. There he served as a {{messenger}} in the office of Judge C. R. Faulkner, director of the pension office. In September 1887, he enrolled at Columbia Law School (asserted by Vernon Gipson to have been a prior designation for George Washington University Law School). On October 17, 1888, he matriculated to Washington and Lee University, where he earned a law degree in 1890. He returned to Madisonville, was admitted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar,</b> <b>and</b> began practicing in the office of Judge William H. Yost. He became active in the Democratic Party and served as a county election officer. In 1892, he was elected city attorney of Madisonville over Ward Headley.

6000|$|This {{information}} {{seemed to}} give a renewed energy <b>to</b> all <b>the</b> native cupidity of the captain, who called the men from their suppers, and ordered them to commence heaving anew.

50|$|All {{adult males}} are slate-grey; the grey throat extends well down the bird's breast {{with a sharp}} {{demarcation}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>barred</b> underparts. <b>The</b> iris, orbital ring, {{the base of the}} bill and feet are yellow. Grey adult females have a pinkish-buff or buff background <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>barring</b> <b>and</b> neck sides, and sometimes small rufous spots on the median and greater coverts and the outer webs of the secondary feathers.|$|R
5|$|John Eaton {{was born}} on June 18, 1790 near Scotland Neck, Halifax County, North Carolina to John and Elizabeth Eaton. The elder John Eaton was a {{furniture}} maker who served as county coroner {{and member of the}} North Carolina House of Representatives. Eaton's uncle, Major Pinketham Eaton (sometimes spelled Pinkerton), was a Continental Army officer who died in combat during the Revolutionary War. Eaton's father owned a large amount of land in middle Tennessee, and the 1790 census lists him as the owner of 12 slaves. The younger Eaton attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill from 1802 to 1804. He then studied law, attained admission <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar,</b> <b>and</b> moved to Franklin, Tennessee, where he established a law practice.|$|E
5|$|R v Baillie, {{also known}} as the Greenwich Hospital Case, was a 1778 {{prosecution}} of Thomas Baillie for criminal libel. The case initiated the legal career of Thomas Erskine. Baillie, the Lieutenant-Governor of the Greenwich Hospital for Seamen, a facility for injured or pensioned off seamen, had noted irregularities and corruption in the hospital, which was formally run by the Earl of Sandwich. After his official reporting of the problems failed to bring about reform in the hospital, Baillie published a pamphlet that was critical of the hospital's officers, alleging that Sandwich had given appointments to pay off political debts; Sandwich ignored the pamphlet but ensured that Baillie was indicted for criminal libel. Baillie hired five barristers, including Erskine, then newly called <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bar,</b> <b>and</b> appeared before Lord Mansfield in the Court of King's Bench on 23 November 1778.|$|E
5|$|The 18th {{century was}} not a {{particularly}} prosperous time for the Inn or its members, and few notable barristers were members during this period. Some noted members include Sir Thomas Clarke, the Master of the Rolls, Sir James Eyre, Chief Justice of the Common Pleas and Samuel Romilly, a noted law reformer. In 1780 the Inn {{was involved in the}} case of R v the Benchers of Gray's Inn, a test {{of the role of the}} Inns of Court as the sole authority to call students to the Bar. The case was brought to the Court of King's Bench by William Hart, a student at the Inn, who asked the court (under Lord Mansfield) to order the Inn to call him to the Bar. Mansfield ruled that the Inns of Court were indeed the only organisations able to call students <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bar,</b> <b>and</b> refused to order the Inns to call Hart.|$|E
