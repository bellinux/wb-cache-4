When Venkatapathy arrives, Ramana feigns mental illness while Ammadu and Raja {{pretend to be}} a nurse and a doctor. Ammadu endears herself to Venkatapathy by showing interest in his recitals of the puranas.|$|E
5|$|Mohandar tried <b>to</b> <b>insist</b> <b>on</b> only sending Nerazim to the sanctuary, but Selendis {{talked him}} into {{allowing}} {{a small number}} of templar warriors to accompany the expedition. He agreed, but only if there was no disrespect. Vartanil went along with them, and (much to Mohandar's annoyance) so did Dahl. Mohandar pointed out the protoss were still evaluating her, a terran female.|$|E
5|$|The {{action would}} prove {{controversial}} in the United States as several officers' reports suggested that Lieutenant Maley, commander of Experiment, had shown cowardice during the engagement. Lieutenant Porter stated that Maley had tried <b>to</b> <b>insist</b> <b>on</b> surrendering to the picaroons immediately upon their arrival. It was alleged that Maley thought {{the situation was}} hopeless due to {{the sheer number of}} pro-French Haitians who were attacking the convoy, and he had attempted to strike the colors.|$|E

5|$|In 596, Pope Gregory the Great sent Augustine, prior of {{the monastery}} of St. Andrew in Rome, to England as a missionary, and in 597, a group of nearly forty monks, led by Augustine, landed on the Isle of Thanet in Kent. According to Bede, Æthelberht was {{sufficiently}} distrustful of the newcomers <b>to</b> <b>insist</b> <b>on</b> meeting them under the open sky, {{to prevent them from}} performing sorcery. The monks impressed Æthelberht, but he was not converted immediately. He agreed to allow the mission to settle in Canterbury and permitted them to preach.|$|E
5|$|Johnson was {{initially}} left {{to devise a}} Reconstruction policy without legislative intervention, as Congress was not due to meet again until December 1865. Radical Republicans told the President that the Southern states were economically {{in a state of}} chaos and urged him to use his leverage <b>to</b> <b>insist</b> <b>on</b> rights for freedmen as a condition of restoration to the Union. But Johnson, with the support of other officials including Seward, insisted that the franchise was a state, not a federal matter. The Cabinet was divided on the issue.|$|E
5|$|Silver {{included}} lyrics in {{more of his}} compositions at this point, {{although these}} were sometimes regarded as doggerel or proselytizing. The first album to contain vocals, That Healin' Feelin' (1970), was commercially unsuccessful and Silver had <b>to</b> <b>insist</b> <b>on</b> the support of Blue Note executives to continue releasing music of the same, new style. They agreed to a further two albums that contained vocals and Silver on an RMI electric keyboard; the three were later compiled as The United States of Mind, but were soon dropped from the catalog.|$|E

5|$|The Reformed {{confessions of}} faith, {{official}} {{statements of the}} beliefs of Reformed churches, followed the view that Christ is really present in the Supper. They either took Calvin's view that the signs of bread and wine are instrumental in communicating grace, or Bullinger's symbolic parallelism. Some of the German-language Reformed confessions seem hesitant to make the sacrament a means of grace, but they all maintain {{that there is a}} union between the outward signs of the sacrament and the inward grace signified. Reformed orthodox theologians also continued <b>to</b> <b>insist</b> <b>on</b> Christ's real presence in the Supper, while denying against Lutherans that his body is locally present.|$|E
5|$|Informed of the King's decision, Le Gris {{contacted}} Jean Le Coq, {{widely considered}} the best lawyer {{of the day in}} France. Le Coq kept meticulous notes of the entire trial process and it is through his record that many of {{the facts of the case}} are known. Le Coq also comments in his records his own suspicions about his client, whose claims of innocence he considered to be false. Le Gris was urged by his family and lawyer <b>to</b> <b>insist</b> <b>on</b> being tried in a church court, which as a cleric in minor orders was his right. This would have given him a more favourable hearing in a court which did not condone trial by combat and thus would also be much safer. Le Gris rebuffed this advice and became angry when challenged on the decision, insisting on his right to trial before the Parlement.|$|E
5|$|On 13 November 1962, Tsarapkin {{indicated}} that the Soviet Union would accept a proposal drafted by US and Soviet experts involving automated test detection stations ("black boxes") and {{a limited number of}} on-site inspections. The two sides disagreed over the number of black boxes, however, as the US sought 12–20 such stations and the Soviet Union rejected any more than three. On 28 December 1962, Kennedy lowered the US demand to 8–10 stations. On 19 February 1963, the number was lowered further to seven, as Khrushchev continued <b>to</b> <b>insist</b> <b>on</b> no more than three. Kennedy was willing to reduce the number to six, though this was not clearly communicated to the Soviet Union. On 20 April 1963, Khrushchev withdrew support for three inspections entirely.|$|E

5|$|Zwingli {{was obliged}} to state {{the terms of the}} armistice. He demanded the {{dissolution}} of the Christian Alliance; unhindered preaching by reformers in the Catholic states; prohibition of the pension system; payment of war reparations; and compensation to the children of Jacob Kaiser. Manuel was involved in the negotiations. Bern was not prepared <b>to</b> <b>insist</b> <b>on</b> the unhindered preaching or the prohibition of the pension system. Zurich and Bern could not agree and the Five (Catholic) States pledged only to dissolve their alliance with Austria. This was a bitter disappointment for Zwingli and it marked his decline in political influence. The first Land Peace of Kappel, der erste Landfriede, ended the war on 24 June.|$|E
5|$|In {{the seventeenth}} century there was growing scepticism about the reality of {{witchcraft}} among the educated elite. Scotland was defeated in the Civil Wars {{by the forces of}} the English parliament led by Oliver Cromwell and occupied. In 1652 Scotland was declared part of a Commonwealth with England and Ireland and the Privy Council and courts ceased to exist. The English judges who replaced them were hostile to the use of torture and often sceptical of the evidence it produced, resulting in a decline in prosecutions. In an attempt to gain support among the landholding orders, Sheriff's courts were re-established and Justices of the Peace returned in 1656. The result was a wave of witchcraft cases, with 102 in the period 1657–59. The limitations on prosecutions were fully reversed with the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660, and there was a flood of over 600 cases that alarmed the restored Privy Council, leading it <b>to</b> <b>insist</b> <b>on</b> the necessity of its commission for an arrest or prosecution, and banning judicial torture.|$|E
5|$|On 9 July 1386, {{the second}} stage in the legal process began when both Carrouges and Le Gris, with their followers, {{presented}} themselves before the Parlement of Paris at the Palais de Justice to issue the formal challenge. This involved reciting their accusations and throwing down a gauntlet signifying their intention to fight. The declarations were pronounced {{in front of the}} King, his brother Louis of Valois and the entire Parlement, who decided to initially hear the case as an ordinary criminal one and defer their decision on whether to permit the judicial duel until both sides had given testimony. Attempts had been made to persuade Le Gris <b>to</b> <b>insist</b> <b>on</b> a church trial, but these proved unsuccessful as Le Gris wished to counter the accusation with a lawsuit against his opponent claiming 40,000 livres for defamation. Following the declarations a number of high-ranking noblemen stepped forward to act as seconds in the duel for both men, including Waleran of Saint-Pol for Carrouges and Philip of Artois, Count of Eu for Le Gris.|$|E

40|$|Background: Many factors affect whether {{women will}} insist that their sexual {{partners}} use a condom. This research project will identify {{some of the}} predictors of condom use among unmarried women in Ghana, Africa. Methods: This research project evaluated data from the 2008 DHS of women in Ghana, Africa for predictors of condom use among unmarried women. A total of 4, 916 women completed the surveys. Of these, 1, 966 women were unmarried. The research project employed multiple logistic regression analysis to determine condom use predictors {{at the time of}} the last sexual encounter for these 1, 966 unmarried women. Results: Women with a secondary education or beyond were 3. 2 (95 % CI= 2 - 5. 2) times more likely <b>to</b> have <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> the use of a condom than women with a primary education or less. Women ages 15 - 24 were 5. 3 (95 % CI= 2. 5 - 11. 3) times more likely <b>to</b> have <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> the use of a condom than women ages 35 - 49. Women ages 25 - 34 were not significantly different than the women ages 35 - 49. Women living in an urban area were 1. 8 (95 % CI= 1. 3 - 2. 5) times more likely <b>to</b> have <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> the use of a condom than women living in a rural area. Women with a higher level of literacy (could read a full sentence) were 3. 6 (95 % CI= 2. 5 - 5. 1) times more likely <b>to</b> have <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> the use of a condom than women with a lower level of literacy (were unable to read a full sentence). And in concert, women who read a newspaper or a magazine once a week or more were 2. 4 (95 % CI= 1. 6 - 3. 5) times more likely <b>to</b> have <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> the use of a condom than women who read a news paper or a magazine less than once a week. Similarly, women who watched television once a week or more were 2. 9 (95 %CI= 1. 9 - 4. 3) times more likely <b>to</b> have <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> the use of a condom than women who watched less than once a week. Women who were determined to have “excellent” knowledge about HIV were 5. 8 (95 % CI= 1. 5 - 22. 3) times more likely <b>to</b> have <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> the use of a condom than women who were determined to have “fair or poor” knowledge. The results for women with a “good” knowledge were not significantly different than for those with “fair or poor” knowledge. Women who were determined, through a series of questions about wife beating, to have a low tolerance for abuse towards women (“strong” attitude about domestic violence/women’s rights) were 1. 8 (95 % CI= 1. 2 - 2. 7) times more likely <b>to</b> have <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> the use of a condom than women who were determined to have a high tolerance for abuse towards women (“poor” attitude about domestic violence/women’s rights). Results for women with a “fair” attitude were not significantly different from those with a “poor” attitude. Total life time sexual partners, frequency of listening to the radio, and interestingly, access to condoms did not significantly affect condom use. After multivariate adjustment, the significant predictors of condom use at the time of last sexual encounter were age, literacy, and amount of television watched. The results were: women age 15 - 24 (compared to women ages 35 - 49), women who could read a full sentence, and women who watched television once a week or more were 3. 7 (95 % CI= 1. 7 - 8. 1), 2. 1 (95 % CI= 1. 4 - 3. 3), and 1. 8 (95 % CI= 1. 2 - 2. 8) times more likely <b>to</b> have <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> the use of a condom during their last sexual encounter, respectively. Conclusion: Education, age, locality, literacy, media exposure (through reading the news paper or a magazine and watching television), knowledge about HIV, and attitude about domestic were predictors of condom use by the sexual partner of unmarried Ghanaian women at the time of last sexual encounter. After multivariate adjustment, only age, literacy, and amount of television watched were significant predictors of condom use {{at the time of the}} last sexual encounter...|$|R
