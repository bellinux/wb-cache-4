5|$|One {{additional}} non-player character may occasionally {{accompany the}} main character in <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>and</b> can perform different activities to aid {{the main character}} in his quest. The game introduced the ability to kill townspeople, something that many role-playing video games lack.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} watched {{in a total}} of 6.74 million households, the ratings {{decreasing}} from the previous episode. Critical reception was generally favorable, with praises towards <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>and</b> jokes but criticism towards the episode's use of baseball-themed celebrity cameos.|$|E
5000|$|Charlotte Linde {{writes about}} life stories, which {{are similar to}} {{personal}} narrative: [...] "A life story consists of all <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> <b>and</b> associated discourse units, such as explanations and chronicles, and the connections between them, told by an individual {{during the course of}} his/her lifetime that satisfy the following two criteria: <b>The</b> <b>stories</b> <b>and</b> associated discourse units contained in <b>the</b> life <b>story</b> have as their primary evaluation a point about the speaker, not a general point about the way the world is. <b>The</b> <b>stories</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> associated discourse units have extended report ability." ...|$|R

5|$|Tintin fans {{adopted the}} Syldavian {{language}} {{that appears in}} <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>and</b> used it to construct grammars and dictionaries, akin to the fan following of Star Treks Klingon and J.R.R. Tolkien's Elvish.|$|E
5|$|A promotional limited comic {{series was}} {{produced}} in the run up to the game's release. The comic was written by Robbie Morrison, and drawn by Sergio Sandoval and Trevor Hairsine. The cover art was handled by Murry, while both McMarle and Jacques-Belletête took supervisory roles for <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>and</b> artwork respectively. The comic was published by DC Comics between February 9 and June 20, 2011.|$|E
5|$|An episode {{centered}} on Betty {{had been promised}} by the crew at San Diego Comic-Con International in 2012. Due to the subject matter and length of the episode, several scenes had to be cut or trimmed for time, since so much was being placed in the episode. A review by Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club was complimentary towards <b>the</b> <b>story,</b> <b>and</b> Sava also applauded Dunham's voice-acting.|$|E
50|$|As well as Biff, Chip and Kipper Robinson, {{four other}} {{children}} also appear in <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> <b>and</b> occasionally {{find themselves in}} the adventures caused by the Magic Key, namely Wilf and Wilma Page, Nadim Shah (whose mother and father own the local corner shop which features in a couple of <b>the</b> <b>stories),</b> <b>and</b> Anneena Patel.|$|R
5000|$|Each {{story can}} be {{considered}} complete in itself, and in fact several of them were published separately before being collected. Barth insists, however, on the serial nature of <b>the</b> <b>stories,</b> <b>and</b> that a unity {{can be found in}} them as collected. Barth shows his pessimism in <b>the</b> <b>stories,</b> <b>and</b> says he identifies with [...] "Anonymiad".|$|R

5|$|Around Mother 3 2006 release, Itoi {{stated that}} he had no plans to make Mother 4, which he has reaffirmed repeatedly. Itoi has said that, of the three, he had the strongest drive to create the first Mother video game, and that it was made for the players. He made the second game as an {{exploration}} of his personal interests, and wanted to run wild with the third. While reflecting on Mother 3 2000 cancellation, Itoi recounted the great efforts the team made to tell small parts of <b>the</b> <b>story,</b> <b>and</b> felt this was a core theme in the series' development.|$|E
5|$|As Evolve is multiplayer-focused, {{the design}} team put less time and focus into {{developing}} Evolves narrative and campaign. Conversations between characters were reduced during the multiplayer mode as the design team {{thought that it}} would negatively impact on the conversations between players. However, <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>and</b> narrative became more significant in the single-player mode. Evolve does not adapt traditional storytelling methods, nor use a campaign mode, instead, players learn about the Hunters' backstory and the fictional world of Shear by slowly progressing through Evolve. Playing as different characters would also lead to different conversations and dialogues between characters.|$|E
5|$|At this time, Lang and {{his wife}} Thea von Harbou were {{developing}} the film M. Von Harbou and Lang were friends with Jacques since creating the first Mabuse film Dr. Mabuse the Gambler and went on vacation with each other. Lang asked Jacques for help with the screenplay for M and asked for suggestions for a new Mabuse project. Jacques sent Lang his unfinished work for Mabuse's Colony. Lang used the idea of Mabuse's will from <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>and</b> began working on an outline to what would become The Testament of Dr. Mabuse.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in 1947, a pageant {{commemorating the}} signing of the Declaration has been held within the roofless remains of the abbey (last {{full-scale}} event 2005). This was run by the local Arbroath Abbey Pageant Society, now Arbroath Abbey Timethemes, a registered charity, and re-enacts <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>and</b> history of the signing. The group also spearhead Scotland's Tartan Day celebrations on 6 April in association with Angus Council as well as educational visits to local schools.|$|E
5|$|Carrie {{had told}} me in an earlier writing {{appointment}} that she was expecting this album to have darker tones than any of her earlier records. So I remember sitting at the piano while writing the song thinking that if Carrie really wanted something dark, this was what she was after. Carrie really got into <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>and</b> making sure we didn't give away how the two women {{got rid of the}} man the song is about. This kind of song is really tricky because you need enough detail to tell <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>and</b> keep it interesting without it becoming so graphic that it's unpleasant to listen to more than once. I think we managed to pull that off. Either way, it was certainly fun choosing which elements of the story to put in and which ones to leave out.|$|E
5|$|Chocobo Tales was {{announced}} in the Summer of 2006. Initial details revolved around the main character, Chocobo, the opening sequence of <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>and</b> the picture book worlds. Further details included the pop-up duels and more information pertaining to the story. The game was produced by Yuki Yokoyama and took 20 staff members a year to create. The first decision made {{was to create a}} game about chocobos, market research showed that the characters are most popular with younger players, thus the game was designed for the Nintendo DS system, a popular system with that age group.|$|E

5000|$|Watson {{worked as}} a {{narrative}} designer on Dark Millennium Online, Regicide, and Darksiders II. For Regicide, he wrote <b>the</b> main <b>story,</b> cutscenes, <b>and</b> in-game dialogue. On Darksiders II, Watson worked on portions of the main game’s script <b>and</b> wrote <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> <b>and</b> dialogue for all three DLCs. [...] Recently, he wrote <b>the</b> dialogue, <b>story,</b> <b>and</b> promotional trailers for Battlefleet Gothic: Armada.|$|R

5|$|Cool World marked Bakshi's {{return to}} feature films after nine years. The film was {{originally}} pitched as an animated horror film about an underground cartoonist who fathers an illegitimate half-real/half-cartoon daughter, who hates herself {{for what she}} is and tries to kill him. During production, Bakshi's original screenplay was scrapped by producer Frank Mancuso, Jr. and heavily rewritten by Michael Grais and Mark Victor in secret. Reviews praised the film's visuals, but criticized <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>and</b> characters, {{as well as the}} combination of live-action and animation, which some critics felt was unconvincing. The film would eventually gross only half its production budget.|$|E
5|$|Daniel Knauf {{conceived}} the initial script {{for the show}} between 1990 and 1992 when he was unsatisfied with {{his job as a}} Californian health insurance broker and hoped to become a screenwriter. He had always been interested in carnivals and noted that this subject had rarely been dramatized on film. Knauf's experiences of growing up with a disabled father who was not commonly accepted as a normal human strongly informed <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>and</b> its treatment of freaks.|$|E
5|$|Dixon was {{primarily}} hired {{to tone down}} much of the campiness inherent in the stage musical. The 2007 film's script is based primarily on the stage musical rather than the 1988 film, so several changes already made to the plot for the stage version remain in this version. These include dropping several characters from the 1988 version (such as Arvin Hodgepile (the role Mr. Spritzer fills), Velma's husband Franklin, Corny's assistant Tammy, the beatniks, et al.), removing the Tilted Acres amusement park from <b>the</b> <b>story,</b> <b>and</b> placing Velma {{in charge of the}} station where The Corny Collins Show is filmed.|$|E

5|$|Each act of {{the opera}} deals with a single element of <b>the</b> <b>story,</b> <b>and</b> each ends with a chorus. Despite the five-act structure, with two sets of scene changes, {{it is likely that}} L'Orfeo {{conformed}} to the standard practice for court entertainments of that time and was played as a continuous entity, without intervals or curtain descents between acts. It was the contemporary custom for scene shifts to take place in sight of the audience, these changes being reflected musically by changes in instrumentation, key and style.|$|E
5|$|Each stage {{contains}} puzzle {{pieces that}} must be collected to create jigsaw puzzles that tell <b>the</b> <b>story,</b> <b>and</b> to unlock the last stage. On completing the main game, a speedrun mode becomes available for select levels and the entire game. There are also eight stars hidden throughout the world of Braid that correspond to {{the stars in the}} constellation of Andromeda just outside the main character's house.|$|E
5|$|Eragon is {{the first}} novel in the Inheritance Cycle by Christopher Paolini. After writing the first draft for a year, Paolini spent a second year {{rewriting}} and fleshing out <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>and</b> characters. His parents saw the final manuscript and in 2001 decided to self-publish Eragon; Paolini spent a year traveling around the United States promoting the novel. By chance, the book was discovered by Carl Hiaasen, who got it re-published by Alfred A. Knopf. The re-published version was released on August 26, 2003.|$|E
