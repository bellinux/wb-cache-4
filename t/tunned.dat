Furthermore, polarization detection was also achieved and the peak to valley ratio of 8.3 for photocurrent under the incident polarized light at the wavelength of 860 [*]nm was observed.

40|$|In this work, a quasi-time-optimal, {{nonlinear}} state-feedback {{control for}} the torsional torque of a two-mass system (TMS) is presented. The control scheme considers constraints in the stator voltage and currents of the driving machine: a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM). Its design is based on results of the more general framework of optimal control and its implementation constitutes an ad hoc adaption of a numerical method, formulated to solve a more general class of time-optimal control problems. This method leverages the assumption of a bang-bang structure for the actuation and the proposed algorithm exploits the geometrical properties displayed by the system state trajectories in the state space, when steered under this regime, to render its implementation feasible. Once the state reaches a region near its target, the control task is taken over by a classical linear quadratic regulator, to avoid spurious chattering. The algorithm outputs a reference for the electrical torque to be devel-oped by the PMSM, which is controlled with a finite-set model predictive torque controller, modified {{to make use of}} a voltage modulation scheme. The performance of the proposed controller is validated with experi-mental results, which consider an external proportional-integral controller for the load speed, <b>tunned</b> for relatively high bandwidth. ...|$|E
40|$|In this work,we {{study the}} Kondo {{effect of a}} quantum dot (QD) {{connected}} to leads and to a discrete set of one particle states provided by a quantum box represented by a quantum ring (QR) pierced by a magnetic flux side attached to the QD.

The crossover between these two regimes is analyzed by changing the connection of the QD to the QR from the weak to the strong coupling regime. In the weak coupling regime, the differential conductance develops a sequence of Fano-Kondo antiresonances due to destructive interferences between the discrete quantum ring levels and the conducting Kondo channel provided by the leads. In the strong coupling regime the differential conductance has very sharp resonances when one of the Kondo discrete sub-level characterizing the Kondo box is <b>tunned</b> by the applied potential.
