5|$|In 1893, Edward Dean Adams, {{who headed}} up the Niagara Falls Cataract Construction Company, sought Tesla's opinion on what system {{would be best to}} {{transmit}} power generated at the falls. Over several years, there had been a series of proposals and open competitions on how best to use power generated by the falls. Among the systems proposed by several US and European companies were <b>two-phase</b> and three-phase AC, high-voltage DC, and compressed air. Adams pumped Tesla for information about the current state of all the competing systems. Tesla advised Adams that a two-phased system would be the most reliable, and that there was a Westinghouse system to light incandescent bulbs using <b>two-phase</b> alternating current. The company awarded a contract to Westinghouse Electric for building a <b>two-phase</b> AC generating system at the Niagara Falls, based on Tesla's advice and Westinghouse's demonstration at the Columbian Exposition that they could build a complete AC system. At the same time, a further contract was awarded to General Electric to build the AC distribution system.|$|E

25|$|Steadfast in his {{promotion}} of three-phase development, Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky invented the three-phase cage-rotor induction motor in 1889 and the three-limb transformer in 1890. This type of motor is now {{used for the}} vast majority of commercial applications. However, he claimed that Tesla's motor was not practical because of <b>two-phase</b> pulsations, which prompted him to persist in his three-phase work. Although Westinghouse achieved its first practical induction motor in 1892 and developed a line of polyphase 60 hertz induction motors in 1893, these early Westinghouse motors were <b>two-phase</b> motors with wound rotors until B. G. Lamme developed a rotating bar winding rotor.|$|E

Composite coating was mainly composed of Ni base alloy and ellipsoidal ceramic particles with random orientation. The three-phases model {{is used to}} study the thermal expansion strains in composite coating. First, Eshebly-Mori-Tanaka method {{was used to determine}} effective eigen strain of <b>two-phases</b> model formed by the ellipsoidal matrix shell being around a ellipsoidal ceramic particle, then disturbance strain in <b>two-phases</b> model aroused thermal inconsistency is obtained. Finally thinking average stress in effective matrix vanish, the residual stress field in Ni base alloy and particles can be gotten by considering random orientation of <b>two-phases</b> models. It will exert influence on strength and fatigue life of the composite coating...|$|R

25|$|AC {{traction}} still occasionally uses dual {{overhead wires}} instead of single phase lines. The resulting three-phase current drives induction motors, {{which do not}} have sensitive commutators and permit easy realisation of a regenerative brake. Speed is controlled by changing the number of pole pairs in the stator circuit, with acceleration controlled by switching additional resistors in, or out, of the rotor circuit. The <b>two-phase</b> lines are heavy and complicated near switches, where the phases have to cross each other. The system was widely used in northern Italy until 1976 and is still in use on some Swiss rack railways. The simple feasibility of a fail-safe electric brake is an advantage of the system, while speed control and the <b>two-phase</b> lines are problematic.|$|E

Aimed at improving its relatively slow convergence speed and its tendency to be trapped in local minima easily, an improved <b>two-phases</b> parallel {{algorithm is}} presented in this paper. The first parallel operation is to cast about for minima area so as to avoid getting into local optimal solution to some extent and accelerate convergence, thereby reducing the number of epochs. The second parallel operation is to shorten learning time. The experiments demonstrate that the improved <b>two-phases</b> parallel BP algorithm has the better performance of speedup...|$|R

40|$|Analogy-based {{hypothesis}} {{generation is}} a promising technique for knowledge discovery. However, some hypotheses generated are nonsensical. This paper describes a <b>two-phased</b> method {{to increase the}} quality of analogy reasoning. The first phase employs an established approach to generate hypotheses through similarity matching. The second phase utilizes deductive reasoning to eliminate hypotheses that are clearly false or absurd. The basis for elimination is violation of common sense or domain knowledge, which is represented in a suite of ontologies. We describe a set of preliminary experiments conducted to validate this <b>two-phased</b> approach. The experiments involved much larger test cases than reported by any other analogy researchers, {{and the results are}} very encouraging...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} we compare the {{performances}} of concurrency control algorithms using the combinatorics of words. We characterize such control algorithms (as timestamp ordering or <b>two-phases</b> locking) by a triple of values, respectively estimating the frequency of accepted executions of concurrent transactions, its degree of authorized parallelism, and its load factor (a value related to {{the average number of}} elementary operations needed for the serialization of an execution). We effectively compute these values for timestamp ordering and <b>two-phases</b> locking {{in the case of the}} concurrent execution of two transactions. In particular, we obtain the exact and asymptotic frequencies of deadlocked executions of two transactions, and compare these two algorithms in various asymptotic situations...|$|R

40|$|Abstract − 1, 3 -Propandiol is a {{promising}} chemical {{which can be}} produced from fermentation of glycerol because the application of 1, 3 -propanediol is mainly {{in the production of}} bio-polytrimethylene terephthalate (bio-PTT). How-ever, the cost of downstream processes in the biological production of 1, 3 -propanediol can make a high portion in the total production cost due to the large amount of water and the by-produced carboxylic acids such as succinic, lactic and acetic acids in 1, 3 -propanediol fermentation broth. In this study, aqueous <b>two-phases</b> systems composed of hydrophilic alcohols and phosphate salts were applied to the recovery of 1, 3 -propanediol from its artificial aqueous solution. Formation of aqueous biphases in hydrophilic alcohols and phosphate salts was due to the salting-out effect of salts in bottom phase, thereby 1, 3 -propanediol in bottom phase was moved into top phase. Extraction efficiency for 1, 3 -propanediol was proportional to the polarity of hydrophilic alcohols and the basicity of salts and the maximum value of extraction efficiency was more than 98 %. In the aqueous <b>two-phases</b> systems after extraction, there was no carboxylic acid in top phase. Therefore, it was concluded that the aqueous <b>two-phases</b> systems composed of hydrophili...|$|R
