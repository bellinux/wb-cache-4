5|$|Ratatouille was {{originally}} {{going to be}} released in 2006, however, in December 2004, the date was changed to 2007. <b>This</b> <b>happened</b> because Disney/Pixar changed the release date of Cars, from November 2005 to June 2006, thus pushing Ratatouille to 2007.|$|E

5|$|Alexander {{had planned}} to settle Greek colonists on Bahrain, and {{although}} {{it is not clear that}} <b>this</b> <b>happened</b> on the scale he envisaged, Bahrain became very much part of the Hellenised world: the language of the upper classes was Greek (although Aramaic was in everyday use), while Zeus was worshipped in the form of the Arabian sun-god Shams.

5|$|B. Lance Armstrong was {{declared}} winner of seven consecutive Tours from 1999 to 2005.

5|$|Before the {{outbreak}} of World War II, he conducted experiments which showed that in the fission process, neutrons were emitted.

He went on to calculate that this process could occur in less than a microsecond, and as a consequence would result in an explosion.|$|E

Gruban successfully appealed against the internment, and brought Booth to court.|$|E
5|$|Episode Two was {{developed}} simultaneously with Episode One by a development {{team led by}} David Speyrer. This schedule of simultaneous development aided them in streamlining the story between the two games to create an immersive story. The technology used was the same for both games, allowing the development teams to quickly fix any technical problems that might arise from either game; <b>this</b> <b>happened</b> often because of the multi-platform release.|$|E

5|$|Few zoos hold termites, {{due to the}} {{difficulty}} in keeping them captive and to the reluctance of authorities to permit potential pests. One of the few that do, the Zoo Basel in Switzerland, has two thriving Macrotermes bellicosus populations– resulting in an event very rare in captivity: the mass migrations of young flying termites. <b>This</b> <b>happened</b> in September 2008, when thousands of male termites left their mound each night, died, and covered the floors and water pits of the house holding their exhibit.|$|E

5|$|John {{was first}} {{mentioned}} as the despot of Valona in 1350 and his documented {{presence in the}} Albanian lands only dates to 1349. However, he was most likely bestowed the title as early as 1345 or 1346, when Stephen Dušan was proclaimed Emperor (Tsar). American scholar John Fine believes <b>this</b> <b>happened</b> immediately after Stephen Dušan's coronation in 1346. Along with Stephen Dušan's half-brother, Simeon Uroš, and Jovan Oliver, John {{was one of three}} people to bear that title under Stephen Dušan.|$|E
