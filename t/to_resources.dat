5|$|From {{the point}} of view of physics, spirals are lowest-energy {{configurations}} which emerge spontaneously through self-organizing processes in dynamic systems. From {{the point of}} view of chemistry, a spiral can be generated by a reaction-diffusion process, involving both activation and inhibition. Phyllotaxis is controlled by proteins that manipulate the concentration of the plant hormone auxin, which activates meristem growth, alongside other mechanisms to control the relative angle of buds around the stem. From a biological perspective, arranging leaves as far apart as possible in any given space is favoured by natural selection as it maximises access <b>to</b> <b>resources,</b> especially sunlight for photosynthesis.|$|E
5|$|In {{a country}} in which few women may take out loans from large {{commercial}} banks, Grameen has focused on women borrowers; 97% of its members are women. While a World Bank study has concluded that women's access to microcredit empowers them through greater access <b>to</b> <b>resources</b> and control over decision making, some other economists argue that the relationship between microcredit and women-empowerment is less straightforward.|$|E
5|$|Prey {{mobility}} {{could also}} explain the initial development of aposematic signaling. If prey have characteristics {{that make them}} more exposed to predators, such as when some dendrobatids shifted from nocturnal to diurnal behavior, then they have more reason to develop aposematism. After the switch, the frogs had greater ecological opportunities, causing dietary specialization to arise. Thus, aposematism {{is not merely a}} signaling system, but a way for organisms to gain greater access <b>to</b> <b>resources</b> and increase their reproductive success.|$|E

FEPP has been characterized by the Austin American-Statesman as a think tank devoted to researching the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. The Denver Post described the organization as a censorship , and a separate article from the same newspaper called it a left-of-center politically aligned group, which advocated for both intellectual freedom and artistic freedom.|$|E
5|$|Biko saw white {{racism in}} South Africa as {{the totality of}} the white power structure. He argued that under apartheid, white people not only participated in the oppression of black people but were also the main voices in {{opposition}} to that oppression. He thus argued that in dominating both the apartheid system and the anti-apartheid movement, white people totally controlled the political arena, leaving black people marginalised. He believed white people were able to dominate the anti-apartheid movement because of their access <b>to</b> <b>resources,</b> education, and privilege. He noted that white South Africans were poorly suited to this role because they had not personally experienced the oppression that their black counterparts faced.|$|E
5|$|The {{attitude}} of the United States was also influenced by the Monroe Doctrine, a philosophy of foreign policy articulated by James Monroe in 1823, and which justified the maintenance of US hegemony in the region. The stated aim of the doctrine was to maintain order and stability and {{to make certain that}} access <b>to</b> <b>resources</b> and markets was not limited. The historian Mark Gilderhus states that the doctrine also contained racially condescending language, which likened Latin American countries to fighting children. The US government did not need to engage in military interventions in Guatemala to enforce this hegemony, given the presence of military rulers friendly to the US; nevertheless, the doctrine was used to justify the coup in 1954.|$|E

5|$|The psionic and technologically adept Protoss {{have access}} to {{powerful}} units and machinery and advanced technologies such as energy shields and localized warp capabilities, powered by their psionic traits. However, their forces have lengthy and expensive manufacturing processes, encouraging players to follow a strategy {{of the quality of}} their units over the quantity. The insectoid Zerg possess entirely organic units and structures, which can be produced quickly and at a far cheaper cost <b>to</b> <b>resources,</b> but are accordingly weaker, relying on sheer numbers and speed to overwhelm enemies. The humanoid Terrans provide a middle ground between the other two races, providing units that are versatile and flexible. They {{have access to}} a range of more ballistic military technologies and machinery, such as tanks and nuclear weapons.|$|E
5|$|Work from Ahmose's reign {{is made of}} much finer {{material}} {{than anything}} from the Second Intermediate Period, though the craftsmanship from his reign does not always match the best work from either the Old or Middle Kingdoms. With the Delta and Nubia under Egyptian control once more, access was gained <b>to</b> <b>resources</b> not available in Upper Egypt. Gold and silver were received from Nubia, Lapis Lazuli from distant parts of central Asia, cedar from Byblos, and in the Sinai the Serabit el-Khadim turquoise mines were reopened. Although {{the exact nature of}} the relationship between Egypt and Crete is uncertain, at least some Minoan designs have been found on objects from this period, and Egypt considered the Aegean to be part of its empire. Ahmose reopened the Tura limestone quarries to provide stone for monuments and used Asiatic cattle from Phoenicia to haul the stone, according to his quarry inscription.|$|E
5|$|As Islamic {{regulations}} {{stated in}} the primary sources do not explicitly deal with every conceivable eventuality, jurisprudence must refer <b>to</b> <b>resources</b> and authentic documents to find the correct course of action. According to Sunni schools of law, secondary sources of Islamic law are consensus, {{the exact nature of}} which bears no consensus itself; analogical reason; pure reason; seeking the public interest; juristic discretion; the rulings of the first generation of Muslims; and local customs. Hanafi school frequently relies on analogical deduction and independent reasoning, and Maliki and Hanbali generally use the Hadith instead. Shafi'i school uses Sunnah more than Hanafi and analogy more than two others. Among Shia, Usuli school of Ja'fari jurisprudence uses four sources, which are Qur'an, Sunnah, consensus and the intellect. They use consensus under special conditions and rely on the intellect to find general principles based on the Qur'an and Sunnah, and use the principles of jurisprudence as a methodology to interpret the Qur'an and Sunnah in different circumstances. Akhbari Ja'faris rely more on tradition and reject ijtihad. According to Momen, despite considerable differences in the principles of jurisprudence between Shia and the four Sunni schools of law, there are fewer differences in the practical application of jurisprudence to ritual observances and social transactions.|$|E
