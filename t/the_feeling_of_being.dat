5|$|Girlfight {{was filmed}} over 24 days in New York and New Jersey. For scenes inside the gym where Diana and Tiny train, the filmmakers {{shot in a}} {{warehouse}} in Jersey City. The initial boxing sequences were shot from a spectator's view outside of the ring but later sequences were filmed more intimately from inside the ring. Cinematographer Patrick Cady used camera rigs that allowed the actors to hit him or the camera itself to mimic <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> hit.|$|E
5|$|In Retford, MacMillan was {{introduced}} to ballet by a local dance teacher, Jean Thomas. He had already had lessons in Scottish dancing in Dunfermline and tap dancing in Great Yarmouth, and he took to ballet immediately. In 1942 his mother died, which caused him acute and lasting distress. His father was a distant figure, and the boy's only close family relationship was with an elder sister. His obituarist in The Times suggests that <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> an outsider, displayed in many of MacMillan's ballets, had its roots in his childhood.|$|E
5|$|Rocksteady {{intended}} for Batman, Catwoman, and Robin to offer three different playing experiences. Other villains from Batman's comic history {{were selected to}} show that the prison was a melting pot of people from Gotham. The developers believed that providing a small part of each villain's story rather than focusing on a select few allowed the player to meet many more characters and effectively conveyed <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> in a superprison filled with supervillains. Rocksteady decided early on that the Joker would die in the story, and developed the idea of him poisoning Batman with the same affliction, in order to show how the two diametrically opposed characters would interact in pursuit of a shared goal. Warner Bros. and Dini did not oppose killing off the character {{as long as it was}} not done for shock value, and as long as they made it clear that Batman was not at fault, since he would not intentionally kill someone.|$|E
5000|$|... "Passenger Seat" [...] is a {{moderate}} up-tempo, driven primarily by acoustic guitar. The narrator describes <b>the</b> <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> in love, and makes reference to life being sweeter in the [...] "passenger seat".|$|R
50|$|A trial {{separation}} {{may allow}} the spouse who wants the divorce to experience some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> separated {{without making a}} final decision to divorce. The main advantage of a trial separation, of course, is that it's easily reversible. The couple can try {{it for a while}}, go through counseling, and then reconcile, or they can try it {{for a while and then}} proceed with divorce.|$|R
30|$|Existential {{stress in}} aid work can evoke <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> {{helplessness}} in <b>the</b> face of overwhelming need (Eriksson et al. 2009). Connected to this are <b>the</b> <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> unable to significantly help aid recipients (Comoretto et al. 2015), difficulties choosing between different recipients and anger from some beneficiaries (Ehrenreich and Elliott 2004). Thus, aid work can challenge or shatter the fundamental ideals, beliefs {{and sense of}} purpose of aid workers (McKay 2007).|$|R
25|$|Regardless of the {{caregiver}} burden, relatives can experience benefits - positive consequences - {{of the home}} care situation. This may be <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> needed or the knowledge that they have acquired new skills etc.|$|E
25|$|Perales took up {{swimming}} {{at the age}} of 19 at a pool in Salou {{by accident}} and stuck with the sport because she liked <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> weightless in the water. When she tried swimming for the first time following contracting neuropathy, she did so wearing a lifejacket. Within a year of that first swim, she joined CAI CDM, a sports club in Zaragoza for people with disabilities.|$|E
25|$|Some philosophers, such as Sartre, {{believe in}} an epistemic {{loneliness}} in which loneliness {{is a fundamental}} {{part of the human}} condition because of the paradox between people's consciousness desiring meaning in life and the isolation and nothingness of the universe. Conversely, other existentialist thinkers argue that human beings might be said to actively engage each other and the universe as they communicate and create, and loneliness is merely <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> cut off from this process.|$|E
5000|$|... "Spellbound", or [...] "Surisuri" [...] (Hangul: 수리수리) in Korean, was {{announced}} {{to be the}} lead single of the repackage on February 20, 2014. An upbeat dance-pop track, the production draws inspiration from soul, groove and funk. Its lyrics describe <b>the</b> <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> [...] "spellbound" [...] by a magical love. Its official Korean title [...] "Surisuri", derived from the phrase [...] "Surisuri Masuri" [...] (Hangul: 수리수리마수리), the Korean version of the incantation abracadabra.|$|R
5000|$|... "Stay Here Forever" [...] is {{a country}} ballad, backed {{primarily}} by percussion with occasional fiddle fills. The song's female narrator describes <b>the</b> <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> in love and lists several ideas of places to go and {{things to do with}} her lover. In assuring him that she's OK with anything as long as she spends it with him, she concludes that they don't have to go anywhere, and can simply [...] "stay here forever." ...|$|R

25|$|A mild form of {{hallucination}} {{is known}} as a disturbance, and can occur in most of the senses above. These may be things like seeing movement in peripheral vision, or hearing faint noises and/or voices. Auditory hallucinations are very common in schizophrenia. They may be benevolent (telling the subject good things about themselves) or malicious, cursing the subject, etc. Auditory hallucinations of the malicious type are frequently heard, for example people talking about the subject behind his/her back. Like auditory hallucinations, the source of the visual counterpart can also be behind the subject's back. Their visual counterpart is <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> looked or stared at, usually with malicious intent. Frequently, auditory hallucinations and their visual counterpart are experienced by the subject together.|$|E
25|$|Indian {{pitches and}} attitudes have changed {{considerably}} {{in the past}} few years though. The induction of several newer 'green top' venues (such as the ones at Mohali and at Dharamshala), the emergence of Indian fast bowlers, plus the development of domestic league cricket with international participants in the form of IPL, Ranji Trophy, ICL, have resulted in a greater variety of pitches. Some contemporary pitches provide good support for pace, bounce, and swing, giving visiting teams from countries such as South Africa and Australia <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> at home. Surfaces are often tailor made to be flat tops or excessively batsmen-friendly, for the sake of maximising entertainment value, at the expense of all types of bowlers. But at time the reverse is true especially in the IPL wherein pace heavy teams often come-up with green pace friendly pitches to maximise chances of victory.|$|E
25|$|The {{buildings}} of the campus were designed by internationally renowned Modernist architect Paul Rudolph {{beginning in the early}} 1960s, to distinguish the campus from the outside world and provide what might be considered a Social Utopian environment. The building architecture {{is similar to that of}} the Boston Government Service Center. Rudolph made both the exterior and interior of each building of rough concrete (béton brut), an essential element of the style known as Brutalism, and he endowed buildings with large windows, with the intended effect of giving those inside <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> connected to the outdoors. The stairs were made relatively short in height, ostensibly in order to slow people down and thus allow them to appreciate the campus more fully. Atriums were also placed in the Liberal Arts and Science & Engineering buildings to give people a place to socialize between sections of the halls. These areas are also filled with hanging and potted indoor plants. The main door of each building faces towards the Robert Karam Campanile, keeping students within the academic life area, where buildings for classes are located. Large mounds of earth (berms) also stand between the parking lots, making the lots partially invisible from within the original Academic Life area (though not from within some recent additions to it, such as the Charlton College of Business building). More recent buildings, most notably the Woodland Commons and residence halls to the south of the main campus, have been built to complement, but not to attempt to copy, Rudolph's Late Modernist aesthetic.|$|E

500|$|Spielberg {{occasionally}} used German and Polish {{language in}} scenes to recreate <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> {{present in the}} past. He initially considered making the film entirely in those languages, but decided [...] "there's too much safety in reading. It {{would have been an}} excuse to take their eyes off the screen and watch something else." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Dan Greaney, and {{directed}} by Mark Kirkland. It was Greaney's second episode on The Simpsons. The staff of the show {{wanted to do a}} summer episode because there was [...] "so much stuff" [...] about summer vacations that they felt had to be covered in an episode. David Silverman, one of the show's animators, particularly liked the episode because he thought it captured <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> on summer vacation.|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics of}} [...] "Growing Again", which {{describe}} Violent J growing into a giant, {{were inspired by}} Bruce's weight gain; Bruce also says that the song reflects <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> able to [...] "rap about anything we want [...] I feel {{we have the right}} for some songs to be softer and not about killing or Dark Carnival." [...] "The Tower" [...] describes a war veteran and expert marksman climbing a college tower and shooting people with an arsenal of weapons, a reference to Charles Whitman's 1966 murder spree.|$|E
5000|$|Avner {{was born}} in Flint, Michigan. His parents were of Lakota and Wyandot heritage. He had a brother named Dave. The family lived in Suttons Bay, Michigan.

Around age 10, he was given the name Stalking Cat by Grey Cloud, the medicine man of his tribe.|$|R

500|$|The record {{features}} outer space-inspired production sounds, with OutKast {{and producers}} Organized Noize incorporating elements of dub, psychedelic rock, and gospel into the compositions. Several songs feature the duo's first attempts at producing music by themselves. Lyrically, the group discusses {{a wide range}} of topics including urban life as hustlers, existential introspection, and extraterrestrial life. The album's title is a portmanteau of [...] "ATL" [...] (an abbreviation of Atlanta, Georgia) and [...] "aliens", which has been interpreted by critics as a commentary about <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> isolated from American culture.|$|E
500|$|Among Wright's most {{significant}} alterations was {{the addition of}} white marble with Persian-style ornamentation. [...] The marble and decorative details added a sense of luxury to the lobby's steel-laden interior, marked by Burnham and Root's skeletal metal ribbing. The entire interior space is bright and open. A double set of curving, heavily ornamented stairs wind upward from the lobby's second floor into the building's interior. A wrap-around balcony {{on the second floor}} enhances <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> within the interior of a [...] "clockwork." [...] The Wright remodel opened the building up to more of the available light.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the track}} is upbeat, keeping in theme with the music. According to Madonna the verses are a mystical {{look at the}} {{universe}} and how small we are compared to it. She wanted to capture a feeling of [...] "wonderment" [...] with the lyrics, as if some one has just opened their eyes {{and looked at the}} world for the first time. With NME, she further clarified that the lyrics convey <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> small in comparison to the vast universe. It also talks about how regular life goes on faster [...] "than the speeding light", but one can get out of that journey and look at themselves with an outsider's perspective.|$|E

500|$|... "Fionna and Cake" [...] {{was written}} and storyboarded by Rebecca Sugar and Adam Muto from a story {{developed}} by Mark Banker, Patrick McHale, Osborne, and series creator Pendleton Ward. The entry {{was directed by}} Larry Leichliter. The genesis for the episode were drawings that character designer and storyboard revisionist Natasha Allegri posted onto the internet during her free time. Her creations were eventually canonized by the show's producers. Allegri even re-rerecorded the show's theme — which had originally been sung by series creator Pendleton Ward — for the episode. Sugar intended [...] "Fionna and Cake" [...] to both be [...] "a jab [...] a huge celebration of, [...] <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> fan" [...] and [...] "allowing something completely ridiculous to make your heart tighten".|$|E
500|$|Eurogamer's Christian Donlan {{considered}} {{that the game}} lacked the same [...] "surprise" [...] as its predecessor, but praised the overall improvement of bosses, animations and the scope of activities available. Donlan said that the game environment was intricate and very detailed, and the abilities provided for its traversal made it [...] "hard not to feel like the world's greatest detective, on patrol". IGN's Greg Miller said [...] "the voice acting, the challenges, the amazing opening, the unbelievable ending and <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> the Dark Knight—these {{are the things that}} standout". Miller said that the Catwoman missions were a fun change of pace from the main gameplay, and that he [...] "adored" [...] the option to replay the game with unlocked abilities and more difficult enemies.|$|E
500|$|According to Ocean, {{the music}} video for [...] "Novacane" [...] {{was a simple}} process.

The feeling of wanting to feel something you can't feel. A lot of things can cause that numbing, but in the video it was some sort of topical aesthetic {{and a little bit of}} special effects." [...] The video doesn't last the entirety of the song, which director Nabil Elderkin stated was for artistic reasons. In an interview with Pitchfork, he reasoned [...] "to me, videos don't always have to be the length of the song. I like the idea of people thinking, 'What was that?'" ...|$|E
50|$|Some time in 1906 or 1907, {{thinking}} that the people from Mühlhausen had passed on their knowledge about his crime, <b>the</b> <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> ridiculed and watched by others returned, {{and as a consequence}} he began to make plans to take revenge on those whom he deemed to be the cause of his misery, the villagers, and especially the men, of Mühlhausen. In autumn 1907 he bought the first Mauser pistol, the other one following in 1909 and, with his bicycle, which he loved more than anyone or anything else, he made extensive journeys through the surrounding area and sharpened his shooting skills in remote forests.|$|R
