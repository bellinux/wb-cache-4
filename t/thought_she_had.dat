5|$|Hawkins was ticketed on November 24, 2007, for {{suspicion}} of {{contributing to the}} delinquency of a minor and two alcohol charges, {{one of which was}} underage possession of alcohol. He was due in court for an arraignment on December 19, 2007. According to local news sources, he threatened to kill a local teenager, because he <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> stolen his CD player. He was also convicted as a juvenile of a felony drug conviction while in foster care in Omaha.|$|E
5|$|Nicol {{attended}} Chantry High School but {{had left}} home at 16 {{to live in}} a hostel, working as a prostitute to fund her addiction to heroin and cocaine. She had originally worked in massage parlours, but was asked to leave on suspicion that she was using drugs. Her mother was unaware she was a prostitute, and <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been working in a bar or a hairdresser's.|$|E
5|$|Reich and Ilse Ollendorff {{divorced}} in September 1951, ostensibly because he <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> had an affair. She continued {{working with him}} for another three years. Even after the divorce, he suspected her of having affairs, and persuaded her to sign confessions about her feelings of fear and hatred toward him, which he locked away in the archives of his Orgone Institute. He wrote several documents denouncing her, while having an affair himself with Lois Wyvell, who ran the Orgone Institute Press.|$|E

5|$|In 1990, Beyoncé Knowles met rapper LaTavia Roberson while {{auditioning for}} a girl group. Based in Houston, Texas, they were joined to a group that {{performed}} rapping and dancing. Kelly Rowland, who relocated to Knowles' house because of family issues, joined them in 1992. Originally named Girl's Tyme, they were eventually cut down to six members including Támar Davis and sisters Nikki and Nina Taylor. With Knowles and Rowland, Girl's Tyme attracted nationwide attention: west-coast R producer Arne Frager flew to Houston to see them. He brought them to his studio, The Plant Recording Studios, in Northern California, with focus on Knowles' vocals because Frager <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> personality {{and the ability to}} sing. With efforts to sign Girl's Tyme to a major record deal, Frager's strategy was to debut the group in Star Search, the biggest talent show on national TV at the time. However, they lost the competition because, according to Knowles, their choice of song was wrong; they were actually rapping instead of singing.|$|E
5|$|The King {{sought a}} divorce, but his advisors {{suggested}} that any divorce proceedings might involve {{the publication of}} details relating to the King's own adulterous relationships. Therefore, he requested and ensured {{the introduction of the}} Pains and Penalties Bill, under which Parliament could have imposed legal penalties without a trial in a court of law. The bill would have annulled the marriage and stripped Caroline of the title of Queen. The bill proved extremely unpopular with the public, and was withdrawn from Parliament. George IV decided, nonetheless, to exclude his wife from his coronation at Westminster Abbey, on 19 July 1821. Caroline fell ill that day and died on 7 August; during her final illness she often stated that she <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been poisoned.|$|E
5|$|Finding her mother's body, Buffy {{at first}} denies what she sees, {{to the point}} of imagining {{alternate}} realities. Whedon stated that these mini dream sequences were like documentaries; people who find their loved ones dead are desperate to imagine a different, better outcome, and they create fantasies that cause much more pain when they are forced to return to the harshness of reality. Later in the hospital, Buffy imagines what she {{might have been able to}} do to save Joyce, although the doctor tells her there was nothing to be done. Willow and Xander express anger and helplessness. Anya, new to mortality and human connections, is childlike in her innocence and questions. Xander's anger and Anya's confusion allow them to be mothered somewhat by Willow, who needs to take care of someone. Dawn is deeply in denial, unable to understand that the woman she <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> known all her life was gone. Tara, who has gone through the ordeal before, represents the acceptance phase, soothing and helping the others to work through what they are experiencing. Buffy toward the end also begins to see acceptance when she tells Dawn that the body in the morgue is not their mother; Joyce is gone.|$|E

25|$|September through October is the malaria season, {{which may}} complicate efforts to treat Ebola. For example, one Freetown doctor did not {{immediately}} quarantine herself because she <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> malaria not Ebola. The doctor was eventually diagnosed with Ebola and died in September 2014.|$|E
25|$|Sabatini {{said that}} she {{deliberately}} lost matches in her youth to avoid reporters and the limelight. She made this claim when she was 43, saying her shyness was a major problem, and she <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> to speak after winning a tournament; so, she often lost in semifinals.|$|E

Britton has research interests in postcolonial theory, the Nouveau Roman, and ethnography.|$|R

She {{was not to be}} interfered with. Was she not herself, and he the outsider.|$|R
25|$|We {{would meet}} monthly, listen to up-and-coming concert artists and {{give money to}} deserving artists for further study. A very young Kathleen Battle sang for us. The other judges thought her voice was too small, but I <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> an {{incredible}} ability to communicate through music. I talked the other judges into giving her a grant.|$|E
25|$|Oncologists doctor (cancer specialist) {{and star}} pupil of her class. She was {{originally}} enlisted by Shi-de to treat Yi-ru when he <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> cancer. Lan grandmother tries to set {{her up with}} Shi-de after seeing them chat with each other, but {{because she is a}} detailed person she knows Shi-de loves Yi-ru and thinks of him as a friend. She falls in love with Sun Qi-ming because of his kindness towards others. She helps Qi-ming reconcile with his mother. Later she and Qi-ming starts dating and gets married at the end.|$|E
25|$|She <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been {{contaminated}} at the plant. Kerr-McGee's management {{said that}} Silkwood had contaminated herself {{in order to}} portray the company in a negative light. According to Richard L. Rashke's book, The Killing of Karen Silkwood (1981/2000), security at the plant was so lax that workers could easily smuggle out finished plutonium pellets. Rashke wrote that the soluble type of plutonium found in Silkwood's body came from a production area which she had not accessed for four months. The pellets had since been stored in the vault of the facility.|$|E

5000|$|Frappe is a Pink Elephant Zooble with an Apricot flavor. Frappe is {{sometimes}} called the [...] "Negative Zooble" [...] due to her thinking anything negatively, especially love. <b>Thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> a very dark personality, she is also very open and caring to others, especially on how she cheered Pom up.|$|R
25|$|Two {{years later}} on July 12, 1955, shortly before her 11th birthday, Muir was {{admitted}} into the institution {{solely on the}} basis of information provided by her mother, without any diagnostic testing. She <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been sent to an orphanage. Under superintendent Leonard Jan Le Vann, a precondition for admission into the Provincial Training School was a signature from Muir's mother permitting the legal enforcement of compulsory sterilization. Over the years, Muir was educated to a grade 5 level and saw her mother only intermittently until her departure from the institution at the age of 20.|$|E
25|$|Fanny Blankers-Koen thereby {{became the}} first Dutch athlete to win an Olympic title in athletics, but she was more {{concerned}} with her next event, the 80m hurdles. Her chief opponent was Maureen Gardner, also coached by Blankers-Koen's husband and who had equalled Blankers's world record prior to the Games, and would be running for her home crowd. Both athletes made the final, in which Blankers-Koen {{got off to a}} bad start (she would later claim she thought there had been a false start). She picked up the pace quickly, but was unable to shake off Gardner, who kept close until the finish line, and the two finished almost simultaneously. When the British national anthem was played, the crowd in Wembley Stadium cheered, and Blankers-Koen briefly <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been beaten. However, the anthem was played in honour of the British royal family, which entered the stadium at that time. Examination of the finish photo clearly showed that not Gardner, but Blankers-Koen had won, although both received the same time (11.2s).|$|E
500|$|On Thursday 20 December 1888, a patrolling constable found prostitute Rose Mylett (also {{known as}} Catherine Millett and Lizzie Davis), 29, strangled in Clarke's Yard, off Poplar High Street. Mylett had lodged at 18 George Street, as had Emma Smith. Four doctors who {{examined}} Mylett's body <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been murdered, but Robert Anderson <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> accidentally hanged {{herself on the}} collar of her dress while in a drunken stupor. At Anderson's request Dr Bond examined Mylett's body, and he agreed with Anderson. Commissioner Monro also suspected it was a suicide or natural death as {{there were no signs}} of a struggle. The coroner, Wynne Baxter, told the inquest jury that [...] "there is no evidence to show that death was the result of violence". Nevertheless, the jury returned a verdict of [...] "wilful murder against some person or persons unknown" [...] and the case was added to the Whitechapel file.|$|E
6000|$|His wife's {{entrance}} {{just then}} interrupted his pleasant <b>thoughts.</b> <b>She</b> <b>had</b> risen {{from her bed}} after lying awake two or three hours, and {{came in with a}} light wrapper over her nightdress, and her hair unbound on her shoulders.

500|$|The casting process, which Kaufman {{described}} as [...] "arduous", began in New York City. He said teenagers {{from across the}} city wanted to audition. Academy Award-winning producer Scott Rudin was the film's casting director who found Erland van Lidth and Linda Manz. There was no character named Peewee in the novel. Rudin had organized an interview with Manz. Kaufman and Price were present; they all <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> [...] "great character". Manz was so convincing that everyone assumed she was a real member of a street gang. Because of this, the character Peewee was specifically written for her.|$|E
500|$|... {{the female}} Shiba Inu {{featured}} in the original meme, was a pedigree puppy who was sent to an animal shelter when her puppy mill shut down. She was adopted in 2008 by Japanese kindergarten teacher Atsuko Satō, and named after the citrus fruit kabosu because Sato <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> a round face like the fruit. Another Shiba Inu {{featured in the}} meme is Suki, a female belonging to photographer Jonathan Fleming from San Francisco. His wife had accidentally put a scarf in the wash, making it shrink. He took a photograph of Suki wearing the scarf outside on a cold night in February 2010.|$|E
500|$|Lycett Green was {{followed}} into the witness box by his wife, and her testimony {{ran into the}} following day. Under questioning she confirmed that she had seldom played baccarat before; although she had seen nothing untoward on the first night, she accepted her husband's second-hand version of events as the truth, but did not agree {{that as a result}} she had been watching Gordon-Cumming. Although she [...] "gave {{the most important part of}} her evidence with clarity and conviction", and had impressed the public and press, according to Havers, Grayson and Shankland, she provided a different series of events to those outlined by other witnesses, although she stated that she <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> seen Gordon-Cumming illicitly add to his stake.|$|E
