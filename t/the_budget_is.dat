5|$|The President of Croatia may {{dissolve}} Parliament {{upon the}} request of the government if the government proposes a confidence motion to Parliament and the majority of all deputies adopt a motion of no confidence or if Parliament fails to approve government budget 120 days after <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> <b>is</b> proposed in the parliament. That decision must be countersigned by the Prime Minister to become valid. The President may also dissolve Parliament after a motion of no confidence supported by a majority of all deputies has been adopted and a new government cannot be formed within 30 days or if a new government cannot be formed after general elections (maximum period of 120 days). However, the President may not dissolve Parliament at {{the request of}} the government if a procedure to determine if the President has violated provisions of the constitution is in progress.|$|E

25|$|In 2010, {{there were}} 7,000 {{students}} {{whose parents were}} employed {{by the federal government}} which pays no local real estate taxes. <b>The</b> <b>budget</b> <b>is</b> fairly dependent on real estate taxes. As a result, the federal government contributes money through the Federal Impact Aid program by way of compensation. However, in 2010, the amount had dropped from an expected $43 million to $5 million due to cuts in the federal budget.|$|E
25|$|The Federal District {{does not}} have a constitution, like the states of the Union, but rather a Statute of Government.

25|$|The United States {{federal budget}} {{comprises}} the spending and revenues of the US federal government. <b>The</b> <b>budget</b> <b>is</b> the financial {{representation of the}} priorities of the government, reflecting historical debates and competing economic philosophies. The government primarily spends on healthcare, retirement, and defense programs. The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office provides extensive analysis of the budget and its economic effects. It has reported that the U.S. is facing a series of long-term financial challenges, as the country ages and healthcare costs continue growing faster than the economy.|$|E

25|$|Considerations of some Dutch {{politicians}} to buy alternatives such as Saab AB's Gripen, Boeing F/A-18 E/F Super Hornet or the EADS Eurofighter, caused the US DoD to suggest (in April 2013) these options would cost {{more in the}} long run. In 2013 the Netherlands Court of Audit found that increasing per-unit costs of the F-35 had driven the number of aircraft that could be afforded below the minimum level needed to fulfill NATO requirements. In September the Dutch government stated a commitment to replace the F-16 with F-35. The anticipated number is 37, and <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> <b>is</b> 4.5 billion euros ($6.01 billion) for the warplanes and an additional 270 million euros per year in operating costs.|$|E
25|$|The Public Expenditure Report of the Water Sector {{provides}} {{a detailed analysis}} of the patterns of budget spending. It appears that in the water sector large part of <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> <b>is</b> made up of development expenditures and only 15% are recurrent expenditures (compared to the 55% share of development expenditures in the total government budget). Moreover, {{as a result of the}} decentralization policy of the government, the budget allocated to local government authorities and regions has increased rapidly. In fiscal year 2008-2009 LGAs had a share in the total water sector budget of about 25%, while the figure was 20% for regions. Conversely, an increasing part of central government budget is devoted to feasibility studies: this reflects the co-ordinating and policy setting role to which MoWI is shifting.|$|E
25|$|As {{the fiscal}} {{guardian}} for the nation's past reserves (that is, reserves not accumulated by the Government during its current term of office), the President's concurrence {{is required for}} a number of financial transactions that the Government may wish to enter into. A guarantee may only be given or a loan raised by the Government if the President concurs, whether the transaction is authorized by a resolution of Parliament or is made under one of eight specified statutes. The President's approval is also needed for budgets of specified statutory boards and Government companies that draw on their past reserves. The statutory boards that come under the President's purview are the Central Provident Fund Board (CPF Board), the Housing and Development Board, JTC Corporation and the Monetary Authority of Singapore, while the Government companies are the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation Pte. Ltd., MND Holdings Pte. Ltd., and Temasek Holdings Pte. Ltd. Before the start of its financial year, every statutory board and {{the board of directors of}} every Government company must present its budget for that financial year to the President, together with a declaration by the statutory board's chairman and chief executive officer (CEO), or the Government company's chairman of the board of directors and the CEO, as to whether <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> <b>is</b> likely to draw upon past reserves. If so, the President may exercise personal discretion to disapprove the budget. If he approves the budget even though he is of the opinion that <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> <b>is</b> likely to draw upon past reserves, the decision and opinion must be published in the Government Gazette. Similarly, statutory boards and Government companies are bound to inform the President of financial transactions that are likely to draw on past reserves, and the President has personal discretion as to whether such transactions should be approved.|$|E

25|$|The Student Government at NC State is {{composed}} of three branches, and headed by four Student Body Officers (SBOs). The Student Body President heads the executive branch. The President executes policy passed by the senate {{and is a member}} of the NC State Board of Trustees. The President runs for office and serves with a Student Body Vice President, who assumes the presidency if that office becomes vacant. The Student Senate is a 64-member body that considers legislative policy on behalf of the students of the university. It is headed by the Student Senate President who serves as the Executive Student Body Vice President. The Senate is also responsible for approving the annual Student Government budget. <b>The</b> <b>budget</b> <b>is</b> drafted each year by the Student Body Treasurer who oversees the monetary status of the entirety of Student Government and as such is a member of both the Legislative and Executive branches. The Student Chief Justice heads the judicial branch and is the only member of that branch elected by the student body.|$|E
25|$|Darlington is {{currently}} {{in the process of}} considering a major re-build of several units, as it too is reaching its design mid-life time. <b>The</b> <b>budget</b> <b>is</b> currently estimated to be between $8.5 and $14 billion, and produce power at 6 to 8 cents/kWh. This prediction is based on three assumptions that appear to have never been met in operation: that the rebuild will be completed on-budget, that the system will operate at an average capacity utilization of 82%, and that the Ontario taxpayer will pay 100% of any cost overruns. Although Darlington Units 1, 3 and 4 have operated with an average lifetime annual capacity factor of 85% and Unit 2 with a capacity factor of 78%, refurbished units at Pickering and Bruce have lifetime capacity factors between 59 and 69%. This includes periods of several years while the units were shut down for the retubing and refurbishing. In 2009, Bruce A Units 3 and 4 had capacity factors of 80.5% and 76.7%, respectively, in a year when they had a major Vacuum Building outage.|$|E
25|$|Historically {{the army}} has been poorly trained; however Australia has {{recently}} made this {{the focus of the}} Enhanced Defence Partnership programme, supplying training, advisors and equipment. New Zealand is also contributing training assistance under its Mutual Assistance Programme. Equally army personnel have in the past trained with the French in New Caledonia, while US Special Forces have occasionally undertaken joint exercises in PNG. At present, however, over 90 per cent of <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> <b>is</b> dedicated to pay and retrenchments, and as a consequence there is little left to fund training exercises. While most soldiers are not currently formally qualified for their rank, there are determined moves to professionalise the army after the restructure is complete. Indeed, {{the army has}} an officer training academy and a small trade training capacity, which is being boosted by Australian personnel. A small number of officer candidates also undertake training at the Royal Military College – Duntroon, in Canberra. Australian procedures are followed as a matter of course, and their influence is increasing as more joint training exercises are held.|$|E

25|$|The {{powers of}} the {{legislature}} are checked {{by a number of}} devices: first, by certain constitutional limitations; second, by the president as defined under the constitution; and third, by the Constitutional Court. Articles 64, 131, and 132 of the constitution circumscribe the ability of the Seimas to control the Government, especially the budget. Article 64 specifies the times of parliamentary sessions. Although extension is possible, ordinarily the legislature cannot sit longer than seven months and three days, divided into two sessions. The budget submitted by the Government can be increased by the legislature only if the latter indicates the sources of financing for additional expenditures. If <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> <b>is</b> not approved {{before the start of the}} budget year, proposed expenditures cannot be higher than those of the previous year. Finally, the legislature is not entrusted with making decisions concerning the basic characteristics of Lithuanian statehood and democracy. These are left to the citizens by means of referendum. Similarly, the initiative for making laws is not limited to the legislature but also belongs to the citizens, who can force the legislature to consider a law by submitting a petition with 50,000 signatures.|$|E
