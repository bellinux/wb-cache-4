50|$|Abbe and Zeiss were {{convinced}} that the optical qualities of the microscope objective could be improved further if glasses with certain properties could be obtained.  Unfortunately, no such glasses existed.  Zeiss once again supported Abbe in his theoretical work with {{the resources of the}} workshop to produce objectives using liquids in <b>lens</b> <b>triplets</b> to test his theory by 1873, known as polyop objectives in the workshop.  Liquid <b>lens</b> <b>triplets</b> were not a new idea.  David Brewster describes them in his Treatise on the Microscope of 1837 for the Encyclopædia Britannica.  They allow access to several optical properties which are not accessible in glasses.  Unfortunately, they are not commercially viable.  These expensive and commercially useless experiments proved that Abbe’s prediction was correct.  Superior optical corrections were possible.  Abbe and Zeiss’ 1872 series of objectives, including the water immersion objectives, were as good as anything made at the time.  For the first time, these objectives were better than anything made anywhere.  This result provided the argument for developing new glasses.|$|R

40|$|Developments in {{nanotechnology}} {{and material}} science have produced optical materials with astonishing properties. Theory and experimentation have demonstrated that, among other properties, {{the law of}} refraction is reversed at an interface between a naturally occurring material and these so-called metamaterials. As the technology advances metamaterials {{have the potential to}} vastly impact the field of optical science. In this study we provide a foundation for future work in the area of geometric optics and lens design with metamaterials. The concept of negative refraction is extended to derive a comprehensive set of first-order imaging principles as well as an exhaustive aberration theory to 4 th order. Results demonstrate congruence with the classical theory; however, negative refraction introduces a host of novel properties. In terms of aberration theory, metamaterials present the lens designer with increased flexibility. A singlet can be bent to produce either positive or negative spherical aberration (regardless of its focal length), its contribution to coma can become independent of its conjugate factor, and its field curvature takes on the opposite sign of its focal power. This is shown to be advantageous in some designs such as a finite conjugate relay lens; however, in a wider field of view landscape lens we demonstrate a metamaterial's aberration properties may be detrimental. This study presents the first comprehensive investigation of metamaterial lenses using industry standard lens design software. A formal design study evaluates the performance of doublet and <b>triplet</b> <b>lenses</b> operating at F/ 5 with a 100 mm focal length, a 20 Â° half field of view, and specific geometric constraints. Computer aided optimization and performance evaluation provide experimental controls to remove designer-induced bias from the results. Positive-index lenses provide benchmarks for comparison to metamaterial systems subjected to identical design constraints. We find that idiosyncrasies in a metamaterial lens' aberration content can be exploited to produce imaging systems that are superior to their conventional counterparts. However, in some circumstances the reduced low-order aberration content in a metamaterial lens reduces the effectiveness of aberration balancing and stop shifting. Through a series of design experiments the relative advantages and challenges of using metamaterials in lens design are revealed...|$|R

Beginning with the KH-4 satellites, these lenses were replaced with Petzval f/3.5 lens. The lenses were panoramic, and moved through a 70° arc perpendicular to {{the direction of the}} orbit. A panoramic lens was chosen because it could obtain a wider image. Although the best resolution was only obtained {{in the center of the}} image, this could be overcome by having the camera sweep automatically ("reciprocate") back and forth across 70° of arc. The lens on the camera was constantly rotating, to counteract the blurring effect of the satellite moving over the planet.|$|E
40|$|The work of {{this thesis}} is to {{investigate}} new techniques for Integral Field Spectroscopy (IPS) {{to make the most}} efficient use of modem large telescopes. Most of the work described is aimed at the FMOS for the SUBARU 8 m telescope. Although this is primarily a system for Multiple Object Spectroscopy (MOS) employing single fibres, there is an option to include a multiple-IFS (MIPS) system. Much of this thesis is therefore aimed at the design and prototyping of critical systems for both the IPS and MOS modes of this instrument. The basic theory of IFU design is discussed first. Some particular problems are described and their soludons presented. The design of the MIPS system is described together with the construction and testing of a prototype deployable IFU. The assembly of the pickoff/fore-optics, microlens array and fibre bundle and their testing are described in detail. The estimated performance of the complete module is presented together with suggestions for improving the system efficiency which is currently limited by the performance of the microlens array. The prototyping of the MIPS system is supported by an extensive programme of testing of candidate microlens arrays. Another critical aspect of the instrument is the ability to disconnect the (IPS and MOS) fibre input which is installed on a removable prime focus top-end ring from the spectrographs which are mounted elsewhere on the telescope. This requires high-performance multiple fibre connectors. The designs of connectors for the MOS and IPS modes are described. Results from the testing of a prototype for the MOS mode are presented. This work is supported by a mathematical model of the coupling efficiency which takes into account optical aberrations and alignment errors. The final critical aspect of FMOS which has been investigated is the design of the spectrographs. The baseline system operates in the near-infrared (NIR) but an additional visible channel is an option. Efficient designs for both the visible and NIR systems are presented. The design of the NIR spectrograph presents challenges in the choice of materials for the doublet and <b>triplet</b> <b>lenses</b> employed. The choice of material and the combinations in which they can be used are described. This thesis shows that all these critical aspects of FMOS have good solutions that will result in good performance of the whole instrument. For the multiple IFU system, the prototype demonstrates acceptable performance which can be made excellent by the use of a better microlens array. The multiple fibre connector prototype already indicates excellent performance. Finally, the spectrograph designs presented should result in high efficiency and good image quality...|$|R
40|$|Neutral atoms {{entering}} {{an electric}} field experience a defocusing {{force in the}} dipole field direction, which {{is proportional to the}} field gradient. If an experiment, such as the search for a permanent electron electric dipole moment (eEDM), requires a very strong electric field (13. 5 [*][*]MV/m), then this end-field defocusing results in beam blowup and much reduced phase-space acceptance. In this paper we discuss how these defocusing fields arise from the longitudinal changes in the electric dipole field and their dependence on the electrode shape and spacing between lenses. We find that the end-field defocusing comes from strong impulse forces, whose defocusing power was calculated for simple electrodes with rounded ends. To compensate for this end-field defocusing, a <b>triplet</b> of transverse-focusing <b>lenses</b> was added to the pure dipole field plates in the generic eEDM cesium fountain experiment used to study the neutral beam optics. Envelope equations, which calculated the beam sizes of the atom bunch for the linear forces, are used to obtain a set of lens parameters that give a well focused beam in the fountain. Atom trajectory equations allow us to calculate the phase-space acceptance of the lens system with the nonlinear force terms included...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Based on the {{analysis}} of known, corrected, classical triplet type objectives and given the basic specification requirements, diagrams of the constructional length and image distance of their equivalent thin lens systems are prepared. By keeping the constructional length and image distance constant and applying simple formulas, the focal lengths and air gaps of the thin <b>lens</b> <b>triplet</b> variations can be generated. These variations {{can be used for}} selection based on any criteria, such as, for example, the Petzval sum. According to the original description of the Petzval sum, to our computational experiences and to the examples given, which were the results of precise corrections, we concluded that also in case of triplets, the designer should target the minimal Petzval sum, which is constrained only by the basic specification data.
