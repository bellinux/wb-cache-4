The Pow Wow offers the {{opportunity}} {{for children and adults}} both to learn about the happenings of the Council of Pontiac, and the rich cultural heritage of the original inhabitants of this area, along with dancing, fun games and other activities. Council Point Park also has several different venues for visitors of <b>the</b> <b>park</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> down and watch sporting events including baseball, softball, soccer, and inline hockey.|$|E

At sunset, wolves howl as the sun sinks into the tall trees with the Olympic Mountains silhouetted on the horizon. The wolves are temporary guests as part of a restoration project for endangered species that the Zoo & Aquarium and Northwest Trek Wildlife Park sponsor.|$|R
50|$|The Parc de Belleville, in the 20th arrondissement, {{was another}} early Mitterrand-era park. It was {{designed}} by architect Francois Debulois and landscape architect Paul Brichet, and built on a steeply-sloping site that covered 4.5 hectares, on the hill of Belleville, the highest point in <b>the</b> city. <b>The</b> <b>park</b> was located {{not far from the}} Parc des Buttes-Chaumont, and shared some of the same picturesque elements as that Second-Empire park, including a terrace and belvedere at the top of <b>the</b> <b>park</b> with a panoramic view of the city, winding paths along the hillsides, abundant flowerbeds and groves of trees, and a series of cascades {{from the top of the}} hill down to a semi-circular basin, then under Rue Julian Lacroix to a circular basin in another garden in the jardin de Pali-Kao, a miniature park of three thousand square meters opened in 1989. Visitors <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>park</b> are invited <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> on the abundant lawns of <b>the</b> <b>park,</b> a practice long discouraged in Paris <b>parks.</b> Like Buttes-Chaumont, <b>the</b> Parc de Belleville originally had a grotto, built into the side of the old stone quarries, but it had to be closed because of vandalism and security concerns.|$|R

25|$|After Presley {{showed signs}} of {{rebellion}} again in 1966 and because of his flagging career, Parker {{decided that it was}} time for a new approach: marriage. Frank Sinatra had married Mia Farrow in 1966, and it had produced enough publicity for <b>Parker</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> up and take notice. Presley had been living with Priscilla Beaulieu, ten years his junior, for the past four years, but it had not been public knowledge. Jerry Lee Lewis's career had been almost destroyed when it came out that he had married his 13-year-old cousin – and Parker was not going to let a similar scandal happen to Presley.|$|R

Subsequently a further gift of land by the Firm enabled <b>the</b> <b>Park</b> <b>to</b> be extended to the Dudley Canal.|$|R

The Knotts refused <b>to</b> sell <b>the</b> <b>park</b> <b>to</b> Disney out of fear most of what Walter Knott had built would be eliminated.|$|R
