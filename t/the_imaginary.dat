40|$|Simmel’s sociological {{approach}} foregrounds the paper’s {{investigation of}} the relationship between society, imaginary and space. Space as a locus of meaning is a social construction but also possesses some qualities which create a border to <b>the</b> <b>imaginaries</b> producing them. In this context, the categories of space and place, which correspond to social forms or phenomena, are considered as a rhythmic polarity.

The aim of the article is to derive prospects for European integration from <b>the</b> <b>imaginaries.</b> We found that <b>the</b> European <b>imaginaries</b> expressed by <b>the</b> largest group of heads of state and government remain blurred without clarification which position is taken on European integration, while <b>the</b> <b>imaginaries</b> expressed by <b>the</b> Commissioners are mainly characterised by support of further integration.

25|$|One of Castoriadis' many {{important}} contributions to social theory {{was the idea}} that social change involves radical discontinuities that cannot be understood in terms of any determinate causes or presented as a sequence of events. Change emerges through <b>the</b> social <b>imaginary</b> without strict determinations, but in order to be socially recognized it must be instituted as revolution. Any knowledge of society and social change can exist only by referring to (or by positing) social imaginary significations. Thus, Castoriadis developed a conceptual framework where the sociological and philosophical category of <b>the</b> social <b>imaginary</b> has a central place and he offered an interpretation of modernity centered on the principal categories of social institutions and social imaginary significations; in his analysis, these categories are the product of the human faculties of the radical imagination and <b>the</b> social <b>imaginary,</b> <b>the</b> latter faculty being the collective dimension of the former. (According to Castoriadis, the sociological and philosophical category of <b>the</b> radical <b>imaginary</b> can be manifested only through the individual radical imagination and <b>the</b> social <b>imaginary.)</b> However, <b>the</b> social <b>imaginary</b> cannot be reduced or attributed to subjective imagination, since the individual is informed through an internalisation of social significations.|$|R

His crazed side is in a paranoid state on the cabin floor, and when Alan touches him, the two are made whole again. Alan realizes that he cannot let himself fall into a delusional state again for fear of never being able to escape, and returns to the typewriter to start a new story—"Return".|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} to calculate eigenvalues, {{one for each of}} the four state variables (lean angle, lean rate, steer angle, and steer rate), from the linearized equations in order to analyze the normal modes and self-stability of a particular bike design. In the plot to the right, eigenvalues of one particular bicycle are calculated for forward speeds of 0–10m/s (22mph). When the real parts of all eigenvalues (shown in dark blue) are negative, the bike is self-stable. When <b>the</b> <b>imaginary</b> parts of any eigenvalues (shown in cyan) are non-zero, the bike exhibits oscillation. The eigenvalues are point symmetric about the origin and so any bike design with a self-stable region in forward speeds will not be self-stable going backwards at the same speed.|$|E

5|$|Taking a {{negative}} real number b to a rational power u/v, where u/v is in lowest terms, yields a positive real result if u is even, and hence v is odd, because then b'u is positive; and yields {{a negative}} real result, if u and v are both odd, because then b'u is negative. The case of odd u and even v cannot be treated this way within the reals, {{since there is}} no real number x such that , the value of b'u/v in this case must use <b>the</b> <b>imaginary</b> unit i, as described more fully in the section § Powers of complex numbers.|$|E

The story takes place in <b>the</b> <b>imaginary</b> land of Meluha and narrates how the {{inhabitants}} of that land are saved from their wars by a nomad named Shiva. It begins from where its predecessor, The Immortals of Meluha, left off, with Shiva trying to save Sati from the invading Naga. Later Shiva takes his troop of soldiers and travels far east {{to the land of}} Branga, where he wishes to find a clue to reach the Naga people. Shiva also learns that Sati's first child is still alive, as well as her twin sister. His journey ultimately leads him to the Naga capital of Panchavati, where he finds a surprise waiting for him.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of World War I in August, Active and her flotilla {{were assigned to the}} Grand Fleet. On 1 September, a submarine was spotted inside Scapa Flow and the 2nd DF was detailed to hunt down <b>the</b> <b>imaginary</b> submarine {{while the rest of the}} Grand Fleet put to sea. When not escorting the capital ships of the Grand Fleet, the flotilla spent much time on anti-submarine patrol off the entrances to Scapa Flow. In mid-October, multiple reports of submarines in the Minch caused Admiral Sir John Jellicoe, commander of the Grand Fleet, to send Active and some of her destroyers there to hunt them down, but nothing was found. After their search was concluded, they joined a large part of the Grand Fleet at Lough Swilly, Ireland, on 22 October. Sometime between October 1915 and January 1916, the cruiser was relieved of her assignment with the 2nd DF and she was on detached service with the Grand Fleet in January.|$|E
5|$|During the pouring rain, a {{young boy}} helps {{his mother and father}} leave a heavily chained toy box at the {{doorstep}} of Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends with instructions to not be opened. The next day, Frankie has grown outraged about her job as the house caretaker; Mr. Herriman has been giving her endless chores to take care day after day without thanking her for any of it. When Frankie discovers the box left on the doorstep, Herriman instructs her to leave it in the attic. In a fit of anger toward Herriman, she intentionally ignores the instructions given in the box and peeks inside it. She falls inside, only to discover it is a vast world filled with anthropomorphic toys and delectable treats. She hears and sympathizes with {{a young boy}}'s voice (Max Burkholder), later revealed to be <b>the</b> <b>imaginary</b> friend named World (given the name by the crew of the show), who has been living alone in the toy chest since his family left the box at Foster's.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of each half-inning, the nine players on the fielding team arrange themselves around the field. One of them, the pitcher, stands on the pitcher's mound. The pitcher begins the pitching delivery with one foot on the rubber, pushing off it to gain velocity when throwing toward home plate. Another player, the catcher, squats {{on the far side of}} home plate, facing the pitcher. The rest of the team faces home plate, typically arranged as four infielders—who set up along or within a few yards outside <b>the</b> <b>imaginary</b> lines (basepaths) between first, second, and third base—and three outfielders. In the standard arrangement, there is a first baseman positioned several steps to the left of first base, a second baseman to the right of second base, a shortstop to the left of second base, and a third baseman to the right of third base. The basic outfield positions are left fielder, center fielder, and right fielder. With the exception of the catcher, all fielders are required to be in fair territory when the pitch is delivered. A neutral umpire sets up behind the catcher. Other umpires will be distributed around the field as well, though the number will vary depending on the level of play; amateur or children's games may only have an umpire behind the plate, while as many as six umpires can be used for important major league games.|$|E
