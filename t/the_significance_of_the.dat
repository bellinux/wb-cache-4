5|$|Israeli {{historian}} David Tal {{agreed with}} this view; Yoav Gelber, {{when asked about}} this, commented that <b>the</b> <b>significance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> attack, along with two other major tactical failures—Latrun and Jenin—was {{in the fact that}} the initiative passed to the Israeli side, and the Arabs conducted only small assaults after these operations.

Journalist Jorge Lanata explained the polarization was because the government and its supporters thought they were engaged in a revolution, and this justified being against freedom of the press and other public rights. Cabinet Chief Juan Manuel Abal Medina said the demonstrators belonged to a class that was against social justice, and compared the demonstrations to a coup d'état. A similar view was held by Kirchner's loyalists.|$|E

5|$|According to USA Today, the match-up {{between the}} Longhorns and the Ohio State Buckeyes (OSU) {{was one of}} the most-anticipated games of the 2005season.

5|$|Although Morgan {{was briefly}} {{seen as a}} hero, {{widespread}} fears concerning plutocracy and concentrated wealth soon eroded this view. Morgan's bank had survived, but the trust companies that were a growing rival to traditional banks were badly damaged. Some analysts believed that the panic had been engineered to damage confidence in trust companies so that banks would benefit. Others believed Morgan {{took advantage of the}} panic to allow his U.S. Steel company to acquire TC Although Morgan lost $21 million in the panic, and <b>the</b> <b>significance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> role he played in staving off worse disaster is undisputed, he also became the focus of intense scrutiny and criticism.|$|E

Above all, however, Domitian valued loyalty and malleability in those he assigned to strategic posts, qualities he found more often in men of the equestrian order than in members of the Senate or his own family, whom he regarded with suspicion, and promptly removed from office if they disagreed with imperial policy.|$|E

5|$|Daniel Knauf {{overlaid}} the Avatars of {{the fictional}} universe with an elaborate order of succession by blood, similar to the ascent of royal families.

The leaders of the White Guards faced a similar problem with drafting young men to the army in February 1918: 30,000 obvious supporters of the Finnish labor movement never showed up. It was also uncertain whether common troopers drafted from the small-sized and poor farms of central and northern Finland had strong enough motivation to fight the Finnish Reds; the White's propaganda promoted a nationalist war against the Red, Bolshevist Russians, and belittled <b>the</b> <b>significance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Red Finns.|$|E
