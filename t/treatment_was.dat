5|$|Because PGAD is {{relatively}} rare and, {{as its own}} concept apart from clitoral priapism, has only been researched since 2001, there is little research into what may cure or remedy the disorder. In some recorded cases, PGAD was caused by, or caused, a pelvic arterial-venous malformation with arterial branches to the clitoris; surgical <b>treatment</b> <b>was</b> effective in these cases.|$|E
5|$|Ganino and Stillwell {{completed}} their new combined story {{in about a}} week. The writers spent hours each day at Stillwell's apartment working over every detail; they felt pressured {{to write a story}} Piller would find acceptable, as they wanted {{to have the opportunity to}} write the teleplay. The story <b>treatment</b> <b>was</b> turned in on October 10. Piller immediately decided to purchase the story and distributed the treatment to the writing staff while he discussed changes. Piller felt that Data's romantic feelings for TashaYar were over the top, and that an alien probe which served as a central part of the story was a cheat in terms of resolving Picard's dilemma. The writer wanted Ganino and Stillwell to enhance Guinan's role and to find another character arc for TashaYar. A revised <b>treatment</b> <b>was</b> submitted on October 29, incorporating Piller's changes. The writers were not involved in development of the teleplay. They were each paid the Writers Guild minimum of $2400.|$|E
5|$|The World Health Organization {{assisted}} the Iraqi government through {{the supply of}} drugs, analytical equipment and expertise. Many new treatments were tried, since existing methods for heavy metal poisoning were not particularly effective. Dimercaprol was administered to several patients, but caused rapid deterioration of their condition. It was ruled out {{as a treatment for}} this sort of poisoning following the outbreak. Polythiol resins, penicillamine and dimercaprol sulfonate all helped, but are believed to have been largely insignificant in overall recovery and outcomes. Dialysis was tested on a few patients late in the treatment period, but they showed no clinical improvement. The result of all treatments was varied, with some patients' blood mercury level being dramatically reduced, but a negligible effect in others. All patients received periods of treatment interspersed with lay periods; continuous <b>treatment</b> <b>was</b> suggested in future cases. Later <b>treatment</b> <b>was</b> less effective in reducing blood toxicity.|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of time <b>treatment</b> <b>is</b> symptomatic. Specific <b>treatments</b> <b>are</b> effective for bacterial, fungal, and herpes simplex infections.|$|R

50|$|The main <b>treatment</b> <b>is</b> symptomatic, {{since the}} {{underlying}} genetic defect {{cannot be corrected}} as of 2015. Symptomatic <b>treatment</b> <b>is</b> surgical.|$|R
5|$|The ritual was {{normally}} performed between Michaelmas and Easter, when {{cold weather}} made it {{less likely to}} contract a disease from the infected subject. It was believed that the <b>treatment</b> <b>was</b> {{more likely to be}} successful if performed on a holy day. English monarchs generally touched less frequently than their French counterparts. Edward I touched up to 1,736 people annually, but did not touch during his frequent military campaigns abroad. His immediate successors followed a similar pattern.|$|E
5|$|<b>Treatment</b> <b>was</b> {{initially}} {{limited to}} aspirin and warfarin, but the 1990s saw {{the introduction of}} a number of agents that could provide anticoagulation without a risk of recurrent HIT. Older terminology distinguishes between two forms of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia: type 1 (mild, non-immune mediated and self-limiting fall in platelet count) and type 2, the form described above. Currently, the term HIT is used without a modifier to describe the immune-mediated severe form.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the war, Delius and Jelka had {{returned}} to Grez. He had begun to show symptoms of syphilis that he had probably contracted in the 1880s. He took treatment at clinics across Europe, but by 1922 he was walking with two sticks, and by 1928 he was paralysed and blind. There was no return to the prosperity of pre-war years: Delius's medical <b>treatment</b> <b>was</b> an additional expense, his blindness prevented him from composing, and his royalties were curtailed by the lack of continental performances of his music. Beecham gave discreet financial help, and the composer and musical benefactor H. Balfour Gardiner bought the house at Grez and allowed Delius and Jelka to live there rent-free.|$|E
30|$|Twelve <b>treatments</b> <b>were</b> {{produced}} by factorially combined six levels of N fertilizer (0, 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100  kg N ha− 1) and two Rhizobium inoculation treatments (inoculated and uninoculated). The <b>treatments</b> <b>were</b> {{laid out in}} randomized completely block design and all <b>treatments</b> <b>were</b> replicated three times.|$|R
50|$|<b>Treatment</b> <b>is</b> {{dependent}} upon the underlying cause. <b>Treatment</b> <b>is</b> supportive as {{it is not possible}} to induce regrowth of lost ducts.|$|R
50|$|Another {{method of}} <b>treatment</b> <b>is</b> fire-safety education. At times, {{the best method}} of <b>treatment</b> <b>is</b> child {{counseling}} or a residential treatment center.|$|R
5|$|Demobilisation also {{included}} establishing {{arrangements for the}} medical care of ex-service personnel. After the war responsibility for medical <b>treatment</b> <b>was</b> gradually transferred from the services to the Repatriation Commission. The Army's hospitals were also transferred to the Commission, meeting its immediate need for facilities. It proved necessary to build new hospitals {{for the treatment of}} tuberculosis and mental disorders, however as the specialised Army hospitals established for the treatment of these conditions were respectively unsatisfactory and had to be returned to the Government of New South Wales. The Department of Social Services was responsible for providing assistance to veterans with a disability not caused by their military service, and this led to the foundation of the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service in 1955.|$|E
5|$|During Team Canada's stay in Moscow, the team's <b>treatment</b> <b>was</b> {{the source}} of {{numerous}} complaints by the players. When leaving Sweden, the team was informed that the players would stay at one hotel, their wives at another. The players threatened not to go, and the arrangements were changed to keep the players and wives together at the Intourist Hotel. The players' wives were fed sub-standard food and the players would smuggle some of their food to their wives. The team had contracted to have Canadian beer and steaks delivered to them in Moscow. The beer was lost at the airport, while the steaks were cut in half. At a practice after game six, the Soviets tried to cut short the Canadians' practice.|$|E
5|$|Fearful {{that the}} Pandes would re-establish their power, Fatte Jang Shah, Rangnath Poudel, and the Junior Queen Rajya Laxmi Devi {{obtained}} from the King the liberation of Bhimsen, Mathabar, {{and the rest of}} the party, about eight months after they were incarcerated for the poisoning case. Some of their confiscated land as well as the Bagh Durbar was also returned. Upon his release, the soldiers loyal to Bhimsen crowded behind him in jubilation and followed him up to his house; a similar <b>treatment</b> <b>was</b> given to Mathabar Singh and Sherjung Thapa. Although pardon had been granted to Bhimsen, his former office was not re-instated; thus he went to live in retirement at his patrimony in Borlang, Gorkha.|$|E
50|$|<b>Treatment</b> <b>is</b> usually {{supportive}} <b>treatment,</b> that <b>is,</b> <b>treatment</b> {{to reduce}} any symptoms {{rather than to}} cure the condition.|$|R

5|$|In 1909, Bryce {{reported}} that, between 1894 and 1908, {{mortality rates}} at some residential schools in western Canada ranged from 30% to 60% {{over five years}} (that is, five years after entry, 30% to 60% of students had died, or 6–12% per annum). These statistics did not become public until 1922, when Bryce, who was no longer working for the government, published The Story of a National Crime: Being a Record of the Health Conditions of the Indians of Canada from 1904 to 1921. In particular, he alleged that the high mortality rates {{could have been avoided}} if healthy children had not been exposed to children with tuberculosis. At the time, no antibiotic had been identified to treat the disease, and this exacerbated the impact of the illness. Streptomycin, the first effective <b>treatment,</b> <b>was</b> not introduced until 1943.|$|E
5|$|In 1961, {{while working}} on his first feature film Ivan's Childhood, Tarkovsky made a {{proposal}} to Mosfilm for a film {{on the life of}} Russia's greatest icon painter, Andrei Rublev. The contract was signed in 1962 and the first <b>treatment</b> <b>was</b> approved in December 1963. Tarkovsky and his co-screenwriter Andrei Konchalovsky worked {{for more than two years}} on the script, studying medieval writings and chronicles and books on medieval history and art. In April 1964 the script was approved and Tarkovsky began working on the film. At the same time the script was published in the influential film magazine Iskusstvo Kino, and was widely discussed among historians, film critics and ordinary readers. The discussion on Andrei Rublev centered on the sociopolitical and historical, and not the artistic aspects of the film.|$|E
5|$|On {{arrival at}} Falmouth, England, after a {{crossing}} under filthy conditions, Allen {{and the other}} prisoners were imprisoned in Pendennis Castle, Cornwall. At first his <b>treatment</b> <b>was</b> poor, but Allen wrote a letter, ostensibly to the Continental Congress, describing his conditions and suggesting that Congress treat the prisoners it held the same way. Unknown to Allen, British prisoners now included General Prescott, captured trying to escape from Montreal, and the letter came {{into the hands of}} the British cabinet. Also faced with opposition within the British establishment to the treatment of captives taken in North America, King George decreed that the men should be sent back to America and treated as prisoners of war.|$|E
30|$|To avoid cross infection, {{samples from}} the unchallenged <b>treatments</b> <b>were</b> {{collected}} first. The challenged <b>treatments</b> <b>were</b> collected after the unchallenged sample collection had been completed.|$|R

40|$|Nine {{defoliation}} <b>treatments</b> <b>were</b> {{applied to}} Pima and upland cotton {{to compare the}} treatment effects on percent defoliation of the plants, percent first pick values, percent gin trash and any effects they might have on fiber qualities. All of the <b>treatments</b> <b>were</b> beneficial compared to the untreated check, but differences between <b>treatments</b> <b>were</b> small...|$|R
5|$|Planetary {{models of}} atoms were not new, but Bohr's <b>treatment</b> <b>was.</b> Taking the 1912 paper by Darwin {{on the role}} of {{electrons}} in the interaction of alpha particles with a nucleus as his starting point, he advanced the theory of electrons travelling in orbits around the atom's nucleus, with the chemical properties of each element being largely determined by the number of electrons in the outer orbits of its atoms. He introduced the idea that an electron could drop from a higher-energy orbit to a lower one, in the process emitting a quantum of discrete energy. This became a basis for what is now known as the old quantum theory.|$|E
5|$|Robert's <b>treatment</b> <b>was</b> used by William the Conqueror {{as one of}} the {{justifications}} for his invasion of England, the other being that Edward had named William his heir. Ian Walker, author of the most recent scholarly biography of Harold Godwinson, suggests that it was Robert, while in exile after the return of Godwin, who testified that King Edward had nominated Duke William to be Edward's heir. However, this view is contradicted by David Douglas, a historian and biographer of William the Conqueror, who believes that Robert merely relayed Edward's decision, probably while Robert {{was on his way to}} Rome to receive his pallium. Several medieval chroniclers, including the author of the Life of Saint Edward, felt that the blame for Edward and Godwin's conflict in 1051–1052 lay squarely with Robert; modern historians tend to see Robert as an ambitious man, with little political skill.|$|E
5|$|Safety {{improvements}} {{continued in}} the 1990s. A five-mile (8km) stretch just west of Aspen was resurfaced in 1991. A special skid-resistant <b>treatment</b> <b>was</b> added to the areas that receive no sun in the winter due to shade from Shale Bluffs. The next year, in 1992, three two-year projects began expanding Highway 82 to four lanes between Carbondale and Basalt, including the new bypass. An old truss bridge near Wingo Junction was replaced in 1995; it was followed over {{the remainder of the}} decade by widening most of the remaining sections between Basalt and Aspen. At the Maroon Creek Bridge outside Aspen, a pedestrian bridge was built to the north to take foot traffic off the older bridge in an effort to relieve congestion.|$|E

5|$|Several anti-angiogenesis drugs {{approved}} for other conditions, such as cancer, {{have been investigated}} in small clinical trials. The anti-VEGF antibody bevacizumab, for instance, has been used off-label in several studies. In the largest study conducted so far, bevacizumab infusion {{was associated with a}} decrease in cardiac output and reduced duration and number of episodes of epistaxis in treated HHT patients. Thalidomide, another anti-angiogenesis drug, was also reported to have beneficial effects in HHT patients. Thalidomide <b>treatment</b> <b>was</b> found to induce vessel maturation in an experimental mouse model of HHT and to reduce the severity and frequency of nosebleeds in the majority {{of a small group of}} HHT patients. The blood hemoglobin levels of these treated patients rose as a result of reduced hemorrhage and enhanced blood vessel stabilization.|$|E
5|$|The {{first series}} of Holby City {{featured}} an ensemble {{cast of characters}} in the medical profession, {{who worked on the}} hospital's Darwin Ward. Phyllis Logan and George Irving played consultants Muriel McKendrick and Anton Meyer. Michael French and Dawn McDaniel appeared as registrars Nick Jordan and Kirstie Collins, while Lisa Faulkner played senior house officer Victoria Merrick. Sarah Preston and Angela Griffin played ward sisters Karen Newburn and Jasmine Hopkins. Nicola Stephenson appeared as nurse Julie Fitzjohn, and Ian Curtis played senior staff nurse Ray Sykes. Julie Saunders played theatre sister Ellie Sharpe, and Luke Mably appeared as ward clerk Paul Ripley. Logan, Saunders and Mably all departed from Holby City {{during the course of the}} series. The series also included walk–on performances by Casualty cast members, including Derek Thompson as nurse Charlie Fairhead, and guest appearances by characters first seen in Casualty, whose <b>treatment</b> <b>was</b> continued on Holby City.|$|E
5|$|Vince Gilligan and John August rewrote Ngo's script, and Jonathan Mostow was {{attached}} to direct the film. Under Mostow's supervision, a ten-page <b>treatment</b> <b>was</b> written to be pitched to Will Smith to portray the lead role in the film. Neither Mostow nor Smith was yet committed to make the project an active priority at the time. Several studios pursued the opportunity to finance the film, and Columbia Pictures succeeded in acquiring the prospect in February 2005. A second draft was scripted by Gilligan following the finalization of the deal with Columbia. The film was initially slated for a holiday 2006 release.|$|E
