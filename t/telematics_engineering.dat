30|$|Problem-based {{learning}} (PBL) (Barrows and Tamblyn 1980; Savery 2006) is {{a teaching}} methodology where the student’s learning process {{relies on a}} problem (constructed by the teacher or other students) similar to those problems that the student will face in real life. The teacher is limited to be a “coach” or a moderator, instead {{of the source of}} knowledge, while the students should collaboratively solve the problem through cooperative learning. PBL methodology was applied {{in the context of a}} network planning course in the Engineering School, at University of Valencia. This is a mandatory course scheduled in the fourth year of the Degree of <b>Telematics</b> <b>Engineering.</b> The course focuses on network planning and management, including saturation and bottleneck detection.

40|$|Retrieving {{business}} process (BP) {{is a fundamental}} step for reusing software components within new information services and software products. Nevertheless, this step is critical in many fields and it may incur in unnecessary resources consumption due to the complexity to find services matching exactly the user's requirements. Therefore, the development of intuitive, endowed with artificial intelligence and semantics-based methods which can recognize what the user really needs, become an important R&D area because it speeds up the deployment and configuration of new BP. In this context, this book summarizes {{the results of a}} scientific research project conduc- ted by <b>Telematics</b> <b>Engineering</b> Group of the University of Cauca (Colombia), in which a BP retrieval environment called BeMantics is defined. This environment is developed through two main modules: a repository module with pre-matching mechanisms based on behavioral semantics; and a structural, semantics and behavioral matching module which uses and error- correcting algorithm to refine the results obtained from repository. As a result the BeMantics environment provides a BP ranking according to their structural, semantics and behavioral similarity with regard to a query BP. This result is later analyzed through a pertinence eva- luation web tool which enables a group of human judges to emit relevance judgments on a set of test BPs.

30|$|Traditional Lecture-Based Learning, {{where the}} teacher makes an oral {{presentation}} intended to present the main concepts of the course, is usually complemented with exercises {{to be carried out}} by the students. This is the case for computer security, a mandatory course scheduled in the third year of both the Degree in Computer Engineering (DCE) the Degree in <b>Telematics</b> <b>Engineering</b> (DTE). This is an introductory course of computer security and thus it has a wide scope. Nevertheless, it has the goal of providing the students with practical skills. In order to achieve this goal, we have extended the traditional LBL model with the following teaching activities, made possible by NETinVM: demos, exercises and labs. Demos, are practical explanations {{where the teacher}} performs and discusses the activity with the students in a lecture session. This kind of activity provides the students with deeper insights and it fosters their participation. NETinVM allows the students to reproduce later the same activities or even test new cases. Exercises consist of practical assignments involving several hosts and networks that students must do autonomously. By using NETinVM, these activities can be securely performed in a realistic and reproducible scenario. Finally, labs are guided sessions where complex exercises are performed by the students under the teacher supervision. NETinVM allows the students to complement the guided session with further optional work. A representative example of a demo could be using Snort as a NIDS. This demo consists of running the Snort intrusion detection software (Snor_team 2014), and showing how alerts are generated when suspicious activities are detected. The examples used were scanning the network with Nmap, connecting as administrator to a remote SQL database, and asking the DNS server for a zone transfer. While performing these activities, the network traffic was captured with Wireshark and the results were discussed with the students. An example of exercise carried out in the classroom is understanding security alerts. Two CVE alerts were selected, and the students were asked to test if “base” or the UML machines were vulnerable, and if there was an exploit that worked against them. Finally, a representative example of labs is firewall configuration. Using Linux Iptables, the lab goes from configuring a single machine (personal firewall) to configuring a machine which is responsible for the interconnection and filtering of the three NETinVM networks, thus providing a real case scenario. The lab includes both basic static rules and more advanced possibilities as packet logging or stateful rules.|$|E

In particular, personal health record systems (PHR-Ss) empower self-care, essential to support lifestyle changes. Approaches such as the user-centered design (UCD), which is already a standard within the software industry (ISO 9241 - 210 : 2010), provide specifications and guidelines to guarantee user acceptance and quality of eHealth systems. However, no single PHR-S for metabolic syndrome (MS) developed following the recommendations of the ISO 9241 - 210 : 2010 specification has been found in the literature. Objective: The aim {{of this study was to}} describe the development of a PHR-S for the management of MS according to the principles and recommendations of the ISO 9241 - 210 standard. Methods: The proposed PHR-S was developed using a formal software development process which, in addition to the traditional activities of any software process, included the principles and recommendations of the ISO 9241 - 210 standard. To gather user information, a survey sample of 1, 187 individuals, eight interviews, and a focus group with seven people were performed. Throughout five iterations, three prototypes were built. Potential users of each system evaluated each prototype. The quality attributes of efficiency, effectiveness, and user satisfaction were assessed using metrics defined in the ISO/IEC 25022 standard. Results: The following results were obtained: 1) a technology profile from 1, 187 ­individuals at risk for MS from the city of Popayan, Colombia, identifying that 75. 2 % of the people use the Internet and 51 % had a smartphone; 2) a PHR-S to manage MS developed (the PHR-S has the ­following five main functionalities: record the five MS risk factors, share these measures with health care professionals, and three educational modules on nutrition, stress management, and a physical activity); and 3) usability tests on each prototype obtaining the following results: 100 % effectiveness, 100 % efficiency, and 84. 2 points in the system usability scale. Conclusion: The software development methodology used was based on the ISO 9241 ‑ 210  ­standard, which allowed the development team to maintain a focus on user’s needs and requirements throughout the project, which resulted in an increased satisfaction and acceptance of the system. Additionally, the establishment of a multidisciplinary team allowed the application of considerations not only from the disciplines of software engineering and health sciences but also from other disciplines such as graphical design and media communication. Finally, usability testing allowed the observation of flaws in the designs, which helped to improve the solution.
