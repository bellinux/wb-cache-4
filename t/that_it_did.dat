5|$|A {{member of}} Fox's Standards and Practices {{department}} was flown {{out to the}} episode's Vancouver, British Columbia filming location. She was asked to watch the episode being produced to ensure <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> not breach any of the network's censorship rules. Several of the scenes that were being produced required quite small spaces during filming, requiring Nutter to record additional coverage on a handheld camera, which he later played back to the Standards and Practices liaison for approval.|$|E

5|$|Although (reportedly) {{molybdenum}} {{was deliberately}} alloyed with steel in one 14th-century Japanese sword (mfd. ca. 1330), that art was never employed widely {{and was later}} lost. In the West in 1754, Bengt Andersson Qvist examined a sample of molybdenite and determined <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> not contain lead and thus was not galena.|$|E
5|$|Davies {{also notes}} two flaws in Rhys's achievement. One was the {{personal}} {{nature of his}} accord with Henry II, which meant <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> not survive Henry's death.

5|$|In February, Magoon {{was called}} {{to testify before the}} Senate Committee {{responsible}} for Canal administration, including responding to Bigelow's report. He was criticized now for the earlier adoption of Panama's penal system in the Zone.

They raised questions as {{to the quality of the}} judges in the territory and other issues.|$|E
5|$|In {{subsequent}} years under Cheney, the proposed and adopted budgets followed patterns {{similar to that}} of 1990. Early in 1991, he unveiled a plan to reduce military strength by the mid-1990s to 1.6 million, compared with 2.2 million when he entered office. Cheney's 1993 defense budget was reduced from 1992, omitting programs that Congress had directed the Department of Defense to buy weapons <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> not want, and omitting unrequested reserve forces.|$|E
5|$|Mustaine {{has made}} {{numerous}} inflammatory {{statements in the}} press, usually regarding issues with former Metallica bandmates. The feud stemmed from his ejection from the band, how it was conducted, and disagreements on songwriting credits.

5|$|The actors {{began working}} on the game in 2010. Their {{performances}} were mostly recorded using motion capture technology. Dialogue for scenes with characters seated in vehicles was recorded in studios. Because the actors had their dialogue and movements recorded on-set, they considered their performances were no {{different from those of}} film or television roles. Their dialogue was scripted so <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> not allow the actors to ad-lib; however they sometimes made small changes to the performance with approval from the directors.|$|E
5|$|The episode closes {{with music}} from The Avengers. After the music had been recorded, Scully felt <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> not suit the ending and so wished {{to change it}} to {{something}} else. However, {{it was too late}} in production to get the full orchestra back to do a recording, and union rules meant that previous recordings could not be reused.|$|E

40|$|Butyrate, in {{relatively}} low concentrations, {{has been shown}} to induce synthesis of enzymes, cause changes in cell morphology, and inhibit growth of a variety of mammalian cells in tissue culture (reviewed in [1]). In this communication, we report our observations on the effect of butyrate on lymphocyte activation. Butyrate completely and reversibly inhibits mitogen-induced blast formation. We present evidence <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not interfere with the binding of mitogens, <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not inhibit a number of the “early” reactions involved in activation, and <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not affect ongoing DNA synthesis {{for an extended period of}} time. However, butyrate rapidly inhibits any increase in the rate of DNA synthesis...|$|R

5|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Swinton O. Scott III. In the opening shot of the episode, the bus that the children travel in to the field trip had to vibrate up and down {{to give the impression}} <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> not have bumpers and that it was falling apart. Scott said it was difficult to animate the scene because of the vibrating and the backgrounds panning. Milhouse's tutor in the episode is based on the American actor Tony Randall.|$|E

5|$|The poor {{state of}} {{discipline}} of the Congolese forces became apparent again in 1990.
