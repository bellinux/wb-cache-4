5|$|Strains that possess flagella are motile. The flagella have a peritrichous arrangement. It also {{attaches}} and effaces to the microvilli of <b>the</b> <b>intestines</b> via an {{adhesion molecule}} known as intimin.|$|E
5|$|They {{are more}} {{attracted}} to the chemicals found in <b>the</b> <b>intestines</b> of many species, {{and as a result}} often linger near or in sewage outfalls. Some species, such as nurse sharks, have external barbels that greatly increase their ability to sense prey.|$|E
5|$|Zinc may {{be held in}} {{metallothionein}} reserves within microorganisms or in <b>the</b> <b>intestines</b> or liver of animals. Metallothionein in intestinal {{cells is}} capable of adjusting absorption of zinc by 15–40%. However, inadequate or excessive zinc intake can be harmful; excess zinc particularly impairs copper absorption because metallothionein absorbs both metals.|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} {{was carried out}} on 60 mature individuals of arctic foxes (30 males and 30 females). Not only the length of <b>the</b> <b>intestine</b> was assessed, but also its specific parts. The overall length of <b>the</b> <b>intestine</b> in arctic fox amounted to 3, 09 m in males and 3, 02 m in females. The ratio of the body’s length {{to the length of}} <b>the</b> <b>intestine</b> was 1 : 4, 80 in males and 1 : 4, 73 in females.

5|$|Dendritic {{cells are}} {{specialized}} antigen-presenting cells {{that have long}} outgrowths called dendrites, that help to engulf microbes and other invaders. Dendritic cells {{are present in the}} tissues that are in contact with the external environment, mainly the skin, the inner lining of the nose, the lungs, the stomach, and <b>the</b> <b>intestines.</b> Once activated, they mature and migrate to the lymphoid tissues where they interact with T cells and B cells to initiate and orchestrate the adaptive immune response.|$|E
5|$|Soluble {{fluorides}} are moderately toxic: 5–10g sodium fluoride, or 32–64mg fluoride ions per kilogram of body mass, {{represents a}} lethal dose for adults. One-fifth of the lethal dose can cause adverse health effects, and chronic excess consumption {{may lead to}} skeletal fluorosis, which affects millions in Asia and Africa. Ingested fluoride forms hydrofluoric acid in the stomach which is easily absorbed by <b>the</b> <b>intestines,</b> where it crosses cell membranes, binds with calcium and interferes with various enzymes, before urinary excretion. Exposure limits are determined by urine testing of the body's ability to clear fluoride ions.|$|E
5|$|The {{permanganate}} {{exhibits a}} higher toxicity than the manganese(II) compounds. The fatal dose is about 10g, and several fatal intoxications have occurred. The strong oxidative effect leads to necrosis of the mucous membrane. For example, the esophagus is affected if the permanganate is swallowed. Only {{a limited amount}} is absorbed by <b>the</b> <b>intestines,</b> but this small amount shows severe effects on the kidneys and on the liver.|$|E
25|$|The lower {{gastrointestinal}} tract includes most of <b>the</b> small <b>intestine</b> {{and all of}} <b>the</b> large <b>intestine.</b> In human anatomy, <b>the</b> <b>intestine</b> (bowel, or gut) is the segment of the {{gastrointestinal tract}} extending from the pyloric sphincter of the stomach to the anus and, in humans and other mammals, consists of two segments, <b>the</b> small <b>intestine</b> and <b>the</b> large <b>intestine.</b> In humans, <b>the</b> small <b>intestine</b> is further subdivided into the duodenum, jejunum and ileum while <b>the</b> large <b>intestine</b> is subdivided into the cecum, colon, rectum, and anal canal.|$|R
50|$|Intestinal {{neuronal}} dysplasia (or neuronal intestinal dysplasia or NID) is {{an inherited}} disease of <b>the</b> <b>intestine</b> that affects one in 3000 children and adults. <b>The</b> <b>intestine</b> uses peristalsis to push its contents toward the anus; IND sufferers {{have a problem}} with the motor neurons that lead to <b>the</b> <b>intestine,</b> inhibiting this process and thus preventing digestion.|$|R
50|$|The lower {{gastrointestinal}} tract (GI), includes <b>the</b> small <b>intestine</b> {{and all of}} <b>the</b> large <b>intestine.</b> <b>The</b> <b>intestine</b> is also called the bowel or the gut. The lower GI starts at the pyloric sphincter of the stomach and finishes at the anus. <b>The</b> small <b>intestine</b> is subdivided into the duodenum, the jejunum and the ileum. The cecum marks the division between the small and large <b>intestine.</b> <b>The</b> large <b>intestine</b> includes <b>the</b> rectum and anal canal.|$|R
5|$|An {{important}} function of enzymes {{is in the}} digestive systems of animals. Enzymes such as amylases and proteases break down large molecules (starch or proteins, respectively) into smaller ones, {{so they can be}} absorbed by <b>the</b> <b>intestines.</b> Starch molecules, for example, are too large to be absorbed from the intestine, but enzymes hydrolyze the starch chains into smaller molecules such as maltose and eventually glucose, which can then be absorbed. Different enzymes digest different food substances. In ruminants, which have herbivorous diets, microorganisms in the gut produce another enzyme, cellulase, to break down the cellulose cell walls of plant fiber.|$|E
5|$|In soil, {{microorganisms}} that {{reside in}} the rhizosphere (a zone that includes the root surface and the soil that adheres to the root after gentle shaking) carry out nitrogen fixation, converting nitrogen gas to nitrogenous compounds. This serves to provide an easily absorbable form of nitrogen for many plants, which cannot fix nitrogen themselves. Many other bacteria are found as symbionts in humans and other organisms. For example, the presence of over 1,000 bacterial species in the normal human gut flora of <b>the</b> <b>intestines</b> can contribute to gut immunity, synthesise vitamins, such as folic acid, vitamin K and biotin, convert sugars to lactic acid (see Lactobacillus), as well as fermenting complex undigestible carbohydrates. The presence of this gut flora also inhibits the growth of potentially pathogenic bacteria (usually through competitive exclusion) and these beneficial bacteria are consequently sold as probiotic dietary supplements.|$|E
5|$|Like other reptiles, dinosaurs are {{primarily}} uricotelic, that is, their kidneys extract nitrogenous wastes from their bloodstream and excrete it as uric acid instead of urea or ammonia via the ureters into the intestine. In most living species, uric acid is excreted along with feces as a semisolid waste. However, {{at least some}} modern birds (such as hummingbirds) can be facultatively ammonotelic, excreting most of the nitrogenous wastes as ammonia. They also excrete creatine, rather than creatinine like mammals. This material, {{as well as the}} output of <b>the</b> <b>intestines,</b> emerges from the cloaca. In addition, many species regurgitate pellets, and fossil pellets that may have come from dinosaurs are known from as long ago as the Cretaceous period.|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we propose}} a new {{approach}} to simulate <b>the</b> small <b>intestine</b> in a context of laparoscopic surgery. The ultimate aim of this work is to simulate the training of a basic surgical gesture in real-time: moving aside <b>the</b> <b>intestine</b> to reach hidden areas of the abdomen. The main problem posed by this kind of simulation is animating <b>the</b> <b>intestine.</b> <b>The</b> problem comes from the nature of the intestine: a very long tube which is not isotropically elastic, and is contained in a volume that is small when compared to <b>the</b> <b>intestine's</b> length. It coils extensively and collides with itself in many places. To do this, we use a layered model to animate <b>the</b> <b>intestine.</b> <b>The</b> <b>intestine's</b> axis is animated as a linear mechanical component. A specific sphere-based model han- dles contacts and self-collisions. A skinning model is used to create <b>the</b> <b>intestine's</b> volume around <b>the</b> axis. This paper discusses and compares three different repre- sentations for skinning the intestine: a parametric surface model and two implicit surface models. The first implicit surface model uses point skeletons while the sec- ond uses local convolution surfaces. Using these models, we obtained good-looking results in real-time...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the {{distribution}} of Abcg 2 and Abcc 2 mRNAs in <b>the</b> <b>intestine</b> and liver of male Wistar rats, and any regional differences. Nine-week-old male rats were used, and their intestine divided equally into nine segments. The expression patterns of Abcg 2 and Abcc 2 mRNAs in <b>the</b> <b>intestine</b> and liver were examined using a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). PCR products for Abcg 2 mRNA were readily detectable in <b>the</b> <b>intestine,</b> but no bands were detected in the liver. In addition, the level of Abcg 2 mRNA increased significantly from the duodenum to ileum, indicating a regional difference in Abcg 2 mRNA expression in <b>the</b> <b>intestine.</b> This regional difference was comparable to that of Abcb 1 /mdr 1 a as reported previously. On the other hand, Abcc 2 mRNA was detected at a higher level in the liver than in <b>the</b> <b>intestine.</b> However, there was no regional difference in Abcc 2 mRNA expression in <b>the</b> <b>intestine.</b> Collectively, Abcg 2 was predominant in <b>the</b> <b>intestine</b> rather than liver in male Wistar rats, whereas Abcc 2 was predominant in the liver. These findings will provide useful information for evaluating the gastrointestinal secretion of drugs as well as drug-drug interactions in rats...|$|R

5|$|Males within Palaeognathae (with the {{exception}} of the kiwis), the Anseriformes (with {{the exception}} of screamers), and in rudimentary forms in Galliformes (but fully developed in Cracidae) possess a penis, which is never present in Neoaves. The length is thought to be related to sperm competition. When not copulating, it is hidden within the proctodeum compartment within the cloaca, just inside the vent. The digestive system of birds is unique, with a crop for storage and a gizzard that contains swallowed stones for grinding food to compensate for the lack of teeth. Most birds are highly adapted for rapid digestion to aid with flight. Some migratory birds have adapted to use protein from many parts of their bodies, including protein from <b>the</b> <b>intestines,</b> as additional energy during migration.|$|E
5|$|Mirs Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS) {{provided}} or controlled atmospheric pressure, fire detection, oxygen levels, {{waste management}} and water supply. The highest {{priority for the}} ECLSS was the station's atmosphere, but the system also collected, processed, and stored waste and water produced and used by the crew—a process that recycles fluid from the sink, toilet, and condensation from the air. The Elektron system generated oxygen. Bottled oxygen and Solid Fuel Oxygen Generation (SFOG) canisters, a system known as Vika, provided backup. Carbon dioxide {{was removed from the}} air by the Vozdukh system. Other byproducts of human metabolism, such as methane from <b>the</b> <b>intestines</b> and ammonia from sweat, were removed by activated charcoal filters. Similar systems are presently used on the International Space Station.|$|E
5|$|Obesity {{is mostly}} {{preventable}} {{through a combination}} of social changes and personal choices. Changes to diet and exercising are the main treatments. Diet quality can be improved by reducing the consumption of energy-dense foods, such as those high in fat and sugars, and by increasing the intake of dietary fiber. Medications may be used, along with a suitable diet, to reduce appetite or decrease fat absorption. If diet, exercise, and medication are not effective, a gastric balloon or surgery may be performed to reduce stomach volume or length of <b>the</b> <b>intestines,</b> leading to feeling full earlier or a reduced ability to absorb nutrients from food.|$|E
40|$|Prion {{diseases}} are {{a family of}} neurodegenerative zoonotic foodborne disorders. Although prions can be transmitted orally, the mechanism by which prions are incorporated into <b>the</b> <b>intestine</b> remains unclear. Our previous {{studies have shown that}} an abnormal isoform of prion protein (PrP Sc), which is the main component of prions, was efficiently incorporated into <b>the</b> <b>intestine</b> in suckling mice but not in weaned mice. Furthermore, suckling SCID mice lacking maternal antibodies showed decreased uptake of PrP Sc into <b>the</b> <b>intestine</b> compared with suckling wild-type mice, while the lack of PrP Sc uptake into <b>the</b> <b>intestine</b> of suckling SCID mice was rescued by the oral administration of IgG. These findings raise the possibility that the neonatal Fc receptor (nFcR), which contributes to the uptake of maternal antibodies into <b>the</b> <b>intestine,</b> plays a role in PrP Sc incorporation into <b>the</b> <b>intestine.</b> <b>The</b> present immunohistochemical study further showed that the FcR blocker Z-eaminocaproic acid (ZAA) inhibited PrP Sc incorporation into the intestinal villi of suckling mice, supporting the above mentioned concept.

While some of these uses have faded with access to alternative technologies, walrus meat remains an important part of local diets, and tusk carving and engraving remain a vital art form.|$|E

5|$|Excess {{intake of}} calcium may cause hypercalcaemia, {{but because of}} the inefficient {{absorption}} of calcium by <b>the</b> <b>intestines</b> a more likely cause is excessive vitamin D intake or excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone. It can also occur due to the bone destruction that occurs when tumours metastasise to bone. This results in deposition of calcium salts into the heart, the blood vessels, and the kidneys. Symptoms include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, memory loss, confusion, muscle weakness, increased urination, dehydration, and metabolic bone disease. Chronic hypercalcaemia may lead to soft tissue calcification, which can lead to serious consequences: for example, calcification of the vascular wall can lead to a loss of elasticity and the disruption of laminar blood flow, and thence to plaque rupture and thrombosis. Likewise, inadequate calcium or vitamin D intake results in hypocalcaemia, often caused by inadequate secretion of parathyroid hormone or defective receptors to it in cells. Symptoms include neuromuscular excitability, potentially causing tetany and defects in cardiac conduction.|$|E

50|$|In <b>the</b> <b>intestine,</b> via kidney, PTH {{enhances the}} {{absorption}} of calcium in <b>the</b> <b>intestine</b> by increasing <b>the</b> production of activated vitamin D.

40|$|Cholesterol {{metabolism}} is tightly regulated {{with the}} majority of de novo cholesterol synthesis occurring in <b>the</b> liver and <b>intestine.</b> 3 Hydroxy- 3 -methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, a major enzyme involved in cholesterol synthesis, is raised in both liver and intestine in diabetic animals.
