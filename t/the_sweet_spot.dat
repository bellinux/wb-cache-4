25|$|Including {{the lower}} bending stiffness, {{composite}} baseball bats {{have a higher}} damping rate. The damping rate corresponds to how quickly the material lessens the vibrations it is experiencing. Russell also states that composite bats have a damping rate anywhere from 2 to 10 times more than standard aluminum bat. Many ball players therefore refer to composite bats as more forgiving because {{if they do not}} make contact with the ball on <b>the</b> <b>sweet</b> <b>spot,</b> they will not feel the vibrations (sting) from the missed hit.|$|E

500|$|Rivera's {{signature}} pitch was a cut fastball or [...] "cutter", which exhibited {{lateral movement}} towards left-handed hitters {{similar to that}} of a slider but with the velocity of a fastball. The sharp, late movement of Rivera's cutter prevented hitters from making contact with the ball on <b>the</b> <b>sweet</b> <b>spot</b> of their bats, leading to them not only making weak contact on batted balls but also frequently breaking their bats; according to a tally by columnist Buster Olney, Rivera broke 44bats during the 2001 regular season. Chipper Jones, who once witnessed teammate Ryan Klesko break three bats in one plate appearance against Rivera in the 1999 World Series, called the pitch a [...] "buzz saw". Rivera's long fingers and loose wrist contributed to the pitch's movement, allowing him to impart more spin on the ball. Describing his grip of the cutter, he said, [...] "it's really a four-seam fastball with pressure on the middle finger". By adjusting the pressure that he applied to the ball with his fingertips, he could vary the pitch's movement. Rivera threw four-seam and two-seam fastballs as complementary pitches but primarily used his cutter; according to baseball statistics website Fangraphs, 83.3% of his pitches in 2010 were cutters. All three pitches typically reached a velocity in the low-to-mid 90smph.|$|E

2500|$|Ball players often {{experience}} a [...] "sting" [...] {{in their hands}} caused by vibrations when the ball does not {{come in contact with}} <b>the</b> <b>sweet</b> <b>spot</b> of the bat. The frequency of these vibrations throughout the bat is related to the bending stiffness. Daniel A. Russell of Kettering University has shown that standard aluminum bats have a high bending stiffness that produces vibrational frequencies in the range where most hands are sensitive; therefore, causing more sting. He also has shown that composite materials can lower this bending stiffness without compromising other advantages.|$|E
2500|$|Blades {{are about}} 3/16inch (...) thick. When {{viewed from the}} side, the blade of a figure skate is not flat, but curved slightly, forming an {{arc of a circle}} with a radius of [...] This {{curvature}} {{is referred to as the}} rocker of the blade. <b>The</b> <b>sweet</b> <b>spot</b> of the blade is below the ball of the foot. This spot is usually located near the stanchion of the blade, and is the part of the blade where all spins are spun on. The blade is also hollow ground; a groove on the bottom of the blade creates two distinct edges, inside and outside. The inside edge of the blade is on the side closest to the skater; the outside edge of the blade is on the side farthest from the skater. In figure skating, it is always desirable to skate on only one edge of the blade. Skating on both at the same time (which is referred to as a flat) may result in lower skating skills scores. The apparently effortless power and glide across the ice exhibited by elite figure skaters fundamentally derives from efficient use of the edges to generate speed.|$|E

He felt that [...] "it showed that there's still a lot of thought going into plotting out these time trips", although he also stated that the episode did not have enough laughs. Merrill Bar of Film School Rejects praised the episode, describing it as [...] "very joke hits, every line was sweet, every emotion is true, every visual was eye popping, this episode is Futurama at its finest. If there is any complaint, it's that it took this long for the show to regain this level of quality." [...] He concluded that [...] "his combined with last week's episode has restored my full confidence in the production team". Sean Gandert of Paste rated the episode a 9.4 out of 10, writing: [...] "'Late' was definitely the best episode of the season so far, and ranks with the best the show's ever done. Nearly every episode of this season has been better than the last, and it looks like it's finally reached the peaks it's hit in the past. As of now, I think any doubt about the Futurama's reboot should be pretty damn well silenced." ...|$|E

30|$|Source rocks as a reservoir, such as shales and coals, are {{not only}} usually poor in quality but may be also more {{heterogeneous}} relative to many other reservoirs, particularly those of conventional accumulations. The heterogeneity of a source-rock reservoir, however, is generally a propitious factor for the occurrence of abundant hydrocarbon accumulations because <b>sweet</b> <b>spots</b> can only be developed in reservoirs with certain heterogeneity. Otherwise, hydrocarbon enrichment might be unlikely if the source-rock reservoirs are highly uniform {{in terms of their}} properties. It is the reservoir heterogeneity and development of <b>sweet</b> <b>spots</b> that control <b>the</b> specific locations of hydrocarbon enrichment. <b>The</b> <b>sweet</b> <b>spots</b> in source rocks can be classified into two types: structural and non-structural. The former is represented by anticlinal <b>sweet</b> <b>spots,</b> while <b>the</b> latter includes geochemical <b>sweet</b> <b>spots</b> (favorable regions for TOC, Ro, thickness, etc.) and petrophysical (porosity and permeability) <b>sweet</b> <b>spots.</b> Accordingly, continuous accumulations can be divided into two types, namely structural sweet-spot accumulations and non-structural sweet-spot accumulations. In general, structural sweet-spot accumulations are characterized by higher resource abundance and producibility and relatively smaller areas of oil/gas distribution than non-structural sweet-spot accumulations. For example, the Fuling Field in the Sichuan Basin seems to be a structural sweet-spot type of shale gas accumulation (Zhao et al. 2016 a).|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} electrical charge noise on a resonant exchange (RX) qubit in a triple quantum dot. This RX qubit is {{a variation of the}} exchange-only spin qubit which responds to a narrow-band resonant frequency. Our noise model includes uncorrelated charge noise in each quantum dot giving rise to two independent (noisy) bias parameters ε and Δ. We calculate the energy splitting of the two qubit states as a function of these two bias detuning parameters to find "sweet spots", where the qubit is least susceptible to noise. Our investigation shows that such <b>sweet</b> <b>spots</b> exist within <b>the</b> low bias regime, in which the bias detuning parameters have the same magnitude as the hopping parameters. The location of <b>the</b> <b>sweet</b> <b>spots</b> in <b>the</b> (ε,Δ) plane depends on the hopping strength and asymmetry between the quantum dots.

5000|$|To sound a note, a sawist first bends {{the blade}} into an S-curve. The {{parts of the}} blade that are curved are damped from vibration, and do not sound. At {{the center of the}} S-curve a section of the blade remains {{relatively}} flat. This section, the [...] "sweet spot", can vibrate across the width of the blade, producing a distinct pitch: the wider the section of blade, the lower the sound. Sound is usually created by drawing a bow across the back edge of the saw at <b>the</b> <b>sweet</b> <b>spot,</b> or sometimes by striking <b>the</b> <b>sweet</b> <b>spot</b> with a mallet. The sawist controls the pitch by adjusting the S-curve, making <b>the</b> <b>sweet</b> <b>spot</b> travel up the blade (toward a thinner width) for a higher pitch, or toward the handle for a lower pitch. Harmonics can be created by playing at varying distances on either side of <b>the</b> <b>sweet</b> <b>spot.</b> Sawists can add vibrato by shaking one of their legs or by wobbling the hand that holds the tip of the blade. Once a sound is produced, it will sustain for quite a while, and can be carried through several notes of a phrase.|$|E
