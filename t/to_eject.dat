5|$|Afterload, or {{how much}} {{pressure}} the heart must generate <b>to</b> <b>eject</b> blood at systole, is influenced by vascular resistance. It can be influenced by narrowing of the heart valves (stenosis) or contraction or relaxation of the peripheral blood vessels.|$|E
5|$|Hambleton, whose {{call sign}} was Bat 21 Bravo, was {{positioned}} immediately behind the pilot, {{who gave the}} signal for everyone <b>to</b> <b>eject.</b> Hambleton pulled the ejection seat handles and had a moment {{to make eye contact}} with the pilot as his seat rocketed out of the dying plane. A moment later, the aircraft was struck by a second SA-2 and exploded. The remainder of the aircraft's six-man crew—Maj. Wayne L. Bolte, pilot; 1st Lt.. Robin F. Gatwood, co-pilot; and EWOs Lt. Col. Anthony R. Giannangeli, Lt. Col. Charles A. Levis, and Maj. Henry M. Serex—were unable <b>to</b> <b>eject</b> and were listed as missing in action. Their remains were never found.|$|E

Exodus guitarist Kirk Hammett replaced Mustaine the same afternoon.|$|E
5|$|In {{cases of}} ditched {{aircraft}}, pilots {{have been able}} <b>to</b> <b>eject</b> safely in several cases. However, fatal aircraft crashes have occurred; in 1994, Lt.

50|$|In October 1969, Clapper and {{co-pilot}} Don Muller {{were flying}} the first Misty sortie, taking off {{early in the}} day, when they encountered enemy ground fire and their engine lost power. The stricken aircraft quickly descended to less than 1,000 feet above the terrain. They broadcast a “MAYDAY” call on the radio prior <b>to</b> <b>ejecting</b> and parachuted down into the mountainous Laotian jungle terrain. The approximate time was 8 a.m.|$|R
5|$|On 29 August 2014, a Ukrainian Su-25 {{was shot}} down by pro Russian rebels. The Ukrainian {{authorities}} said the downing was due to a Russian missile without clarifying if they mean Russian made or fired by Russian forces. The pilot managed <b>to</b> <b>eject</b> safely. On the same day, pro Russian rebels claimed the downing of up to four Su-25s.|$|E
5|$|Previous space {{missions}} to comets, such as Giotto and Stardust, were fly-by missions. These missions {{were able to}} photograph and examine only the surfaces of cometary nuclei, and even then from considerable distances. The Deep Impact mission was the first <b>to</b> <b>eject</b> material from a comet's surface, and the mission garnered large publicity from the media, international scientists, and amateur astronomers.|$|E
5|$|Even {{within the}} theatre itself there was division. Rieger led a {{campaign}} <b>to</b> <b>eject</b> Smetana from the conductorship and reappoint Maýr, and in December 1872 a petition signed by 86subscribers to the theatre called for Smetana's resignation. Strong support from vice-chairman Antonín Čísek, and an ultimatum from prominent musicians among whom was Antonín Dvořák, ensured Smetana's survival. In January 1873 he was reappointed, with a bigger salary and increased responsibility as Artistic Director.|$|E

5|$|It was determined, however, {{that both}} crewmembers aboard the Marine F-4B could {{have survived the}} collision. Further {{investigation}} by the NTSB revealed a design flaw in the ejector seat and canopy assemblies of the fighter plane whereby the pilot would probably not be able <b>to</b> <b>eject</b> if the radar intercept officer ejected first. Since the specific design of ejector seats installed in the F-4B were {{not intended to be}} fired through the aircraft's canopy, a circuit breaker kept the seat from ejecting if the canopy was in place. Once the canopy was manually unlocked, the ejector seat circuit was completed and could be fired. This specific design of ejector seat, however, had a tendency of being unable to complete the circuit in the pilot's ejector seat if the aft ejector seat was fired first. The F-4B aircraft {{were in the process of}} being modified with a newly designed canopy when the collision occurred. Aircraft based at MCAS El Toro were slated to begin upgrades in July 1971; at the time of the collision, BuNo 151458 was still operating with the original canopy configuration, and the pilot was consequently unable <b>to</b> <b>eject</b> from the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Mallards are opportunistically {{targeted}} by brood parasites, occasionally having eggs laid in their nests by redheads, ruddy ducks, lesser scaup, gadwalls, northern shovellers, northern pintails, cinnamon teal, common goldeneyes, and other mallards. These eggs are generally accepted when they resemble the eggs {{of the host}} mallard, but the hen may attempt <b>to</b> <b>eject</b> them or even abandon the nest if parasitism occurs during egg laying.|$|E
5|$|Michael makes several {{attempts}} {{to recapture the}} limelight, culminating with an overlong toast at the wedding banquet in which he impugns Phyllis' chastity.

5|$|On 13 January 1964, a B-52D {{carrying}} two nuclear bombs suffered a structural failure in flight {{that caused the}} tail section to shear off. Four crewmen ejected successfully before the aircraft crashed near Cumberland, Maryland. Two crewmen subsequently perished on the ground because of hypothermia, while another, who was unable <b>to</b> <b>eject,</b> died in the aircraft; both weapons were recovered. This {{was one of several}} incidents caused by failure of the vertical stabilizer.|$|E
5|$|Phaneuf {{made his}} {{international}} debut for the Canadian junior {{team at the}} 2004 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships in Helsinki, earning a leadership role under Head Coach Mario Durocher. A devastating bodycheck to the Czech Republic's Rostislav Olesz led the referee <b>to</b> <b>eject</b> Phaneuf from the semi-final game; he was not suspended, however, and played in the gold medal game. The Canadians lost the final to the United States, while Phaneuf was named a tournament All-Star at defence.|$|E
5|$|In {{the week}} before the Final, a block of 1,600 tickets in the Liverpool supporters' seating area was stolen in the postal system. The stadium {{authorities}} refused to reissue the tickets on crowd safety grounds, and threatened <b>to</b> <b>eject</b> anyone found sitting in the block from the stadium and possibly prosecute them for receiving stolen goods. Liverpool F.C. arranged for most of the affected fans to receive tickets from an allocation that had been held back for a lottery among their supporters. The day after the final, South Wales Police seized 100 stolen tickets. Three people were arrested after 15 forged tickets were found ahead of the match.|$|E

5|$|Land {{is defined}} as the surface, subsoil, {{airspace}} and anything permanently attached to the land, such as houses. The rights of landowners over airspace are not unlimited; in Bernstein of Leigh v Skyviews & General Ltd, the action for trespass failed because the violation of airspace took place several hundred metres above the land. This was backed up by the Civil Aviation Act 1982, which provides that it is not trespass if the aircraft is flying at a reasonable height. An overhanging crane can constitute trespass, as in Woolerton v Costain, as can an advertising sign, as in Kelsen v Imperial Tobacco Co. Possession does not necessarily mean the ownership of land, but the right <b>to</b> <b>eject</b> or exclude others from it.|$|E
5|$|On 24 July 1959, Vulcan B.1 XA891 crashed {{due to an}} {{electrical}} failure during an engine test. Shortly after take-off, the crew observed generator warning lights and loss of busbar voltage. The aircraft commander, Avro Chief Test Pilot Jimmy Harrison, climbed XA891 to , steering away from the airfield and populated areas while the AEO attempted to solve the problem. When {{it became clear that}} control would not be regained, Harrison instructed the rear compartment crew to exit the aircraft and the co-pilot <b>to</b> <b>eject,</b> before ejecting himself. All the crew survived, making them the first complete Vulcan crew to successfully escape. The aircraft crashed near Kingston upon Hull.|$|E
5|$|Taken together, {{analyses}} {{indicate that}} the impactor was large enough to create a 120-mile peak ring, to melt, shock and eject granite from many miles within the earth, to create colossal water movements, and <b>to</b> <b>eject</b> an immense quantity of vaporized rock and sulfates into the atmosphere, where they would have persisted over years to decades. This global dispersal of dust and sulfates would {{have led to a}} sudden and catastrophic effect on the climate worldwide, large temperature drops, and devastated the food chain. The researchers stated that the impact generated an environmental calamity that extinguished life, but it also induced a vast subsurface hydrothermal system that became an oasis for the recovery of life.|$|E
