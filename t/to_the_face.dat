5|$|At {{the end of}} 1905 {{football}} {{looked about}} to be abolished due {{to all of the}} reoccurring violence during games. Football was a sport that had degenerated into dangerous tactics such as: the flying wedge, punching, kicking, piling-on, and elbows <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>face.</b> Almost any violent behavior was allowed. Fatalities and injuries mounted during the 1905 season.|$|E

5|$|Actual or {{impending}} airway obstruction is {{a common}} indication for intubation of the trachea. Life-threatening airway obstruction may occur when a foreign body becomes lodged in the airway; this is especially common in infants and toddlers. Severe blunt or penetrating injury <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> or neck may be accompanied by swelling and an expanding hematoma, or injury to the larynx, trachea or bronchi. Airway obstruction is also common in people who have suffered smoke inhalation or burns within or near the airway or epiglottitis. Sustained generalized seizure activity and angioedema are other common causes of life-threatening airway obstruction which may require tracheal intubation to secure the airway.|$|E

5000|$|In {{recognition}} of World AIDS Day on December 1, 2009, AIDS.gov again hosted <b>the</b> <b>Facing</b> AIDS initiative, among other activities. Facing AIDS encouraged {{people around the}} country (and world) to take a photo of themselves saying why they were [...] "Facing AIDS" [...] for World AIDS Day and <b>to</b> upload <b>the</b> photo <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Facing</b> AIDS group on Flickr. Over 850 photos were submitted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Facing</b> AIDS group, and Flickr featured the initiative on its blog.|$|R
5|$|After the trachea {{has been}} intubated, a balloon cuff is {{typically}} inflated {{just above the}} far end of the tube to help secure it in place, to prevent leakage of respiratory gases, and to protect the tracheobronchial tree from receiving undesirable material such as stomach acid. The tube is then secured <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> or neck and connected to a T-piece, anesthesia breathing circuit, bag valve mask device, or a mechanical ventilator. Once there is no longer a need for ventilatory assistance and/or protection of the airway, the tracheal tube is removed; this is referred to as extubation of the trachea (or decannulation, in the case of a surgical airway such as a cricothyrotomy or a tracheotomy).|$|E
5|$|DVD film reviews have {{suggested}} the film influenced director John Woo; critics have compared the graphic {{detail of the}} face transplant scene in Woo's action film Face/Off (1997) <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> transplant scene in Eyes Without a Face and noted the similarity. Another resemblance is Woo's trademark use of white doves in his films {{that is similar to}} the character Christiane's dove-laden escape in the film's finale.|$|E
5|$|His next {{opponent}} was unbeaten West Ham-based fighter Kevin Lear on 1 June 2002, {{again in}} Manchester, on the undercard of the Ricky Hatton vs. Eamonn Magee fight. Lear, a former Amateur Boxing Association of England (ABA) champion, kept a one-dimensional Gomez at bay with his sharp jab {{from the outset}} of the fight. Gomez took several punches <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>face,</b> and his nose began to bleed heavily starting in the sixth round. By the eighth round Gomez was slowing, suffering the effects of Lear's continuing barrage of combinations. At the end of the eighth round Gomez's trainer Brian Hughes retired his fighter, giving Lear a surprise victory.|$|E

5|$|In {{his first}} fight as undisputed welterweight champion, he fought Cosme Rivera on May 14, 2005, at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. Judah sent Rivera {{down with a}} {{straight}} left hand <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> less than 30seconds into the bout. Rivera beat the count, but was knocked down again about 10seconds later. Judah hit Rivera hard {{several times in the}} second round, and in the third round, he connected with a left uppercut, that caused Rivera to stagger backwards and fall into the ropes before hitting the canvas. Rivera rose at the count of five, but he was badly hurt and the referee stopped the fight.|$|E
5|$|In round four, Judah {{landed a}} {{right hand to}} the head that caused Mayweather to retreat to the ropes and cover up. The {{momentum}} changed in the fifth round, when Mayweather hurt Judah with a combination <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>face.</b> Then Mayweather landed a right hand {{on the bridge of}} Judah's nose, and blood began to flow. The seventh round was the most dominant for Mayweather to that point. Once again, he drew blood from Judah's nose. A combination from Mayweather backed Judah into a corner, and Judah's foot movement was considerably slower than it had been earlier in the fight.|$|E
5|$|On July 14, 2004, {{four people}} {{were struck by}} flying debris while riding the coaster.

5|$|Re-joining the 12th Battalion, Newland {{once again}} assumed command of A Company. On 26 February 1917, he was tasked with leading {{it during the}} 12th Battalion's attack on the village of La Barque during the German retreat to the Hindenburg Line. At Bark Trench, a {{position}} {{on the north side of}} the centre of La Barque, the company encountered a German strongpoint and Newland received a gunshot wound <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>face.</b> He was admitted to the 1st Australian Field Ambulance, and returned to the 12th Battalion on 25 March after a period of hospitalisation at the 7th Stationary Hospital in Boulogne.|$|E
5|$|Serious {{damage is}} rare, as the fights are usually short in duration, with the loser {{running away with}} little more than a few {{scratches}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> and ears. However, fights for mating rights are typically more severe and injuries may include deep puncture wounds and lacerations. Normally, serious injuries from fighting are limited to infections of scratches and bites, though these can occasionally kill cats if untreated. In addition, bites are probably the main route of transmission of feline immunodeficiency virus. Sexually active males are usually involved in many fights during their lives, and often have decidedly battered faces with obvious scars and cuts to their ears and nose.|$|E
5|$|The Smart Cover, first {{introduced}} with the iPad 2, is a screen protector that magnetically attaches <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> of the iPad. The cover has three folds which {{allow it to}} convert into a stand, which is also held together by magnets. While original iPad owners could purchase a black case that included a similarly folding cover, the Smart Cover {{is meant to be}} more minimal, easily detachable, and protects only the screen. Smart Covers have a microfiber bottom that cleans the front of the iPad, and wakes up the iPad when the cover is removed. There are five different colors of both polyurethane and leather, with leather being more expensive than the polyurethane version.|$|E

5|$|The {{gameplay}} in Super Punch-Out!! {{is similar}} to that of its arcade and NES/FC predecessors. The player controls a nameable boxer as he fights his way to become W.V.B.A. Champion. The player controls the boxer from a third-person perspective, with him being translucent on the screen. Players can attack their opponents with jabs <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> or with body blows from either hand. The opponent can deflect punches, so players must aim at the opponent's open spot (where the gloves are not) to connect. Depending on the opponents' stances, they will guard themselves differently, so players need to use the correct punches.|$|E

Hoyt went to get the referee, giving Waltman the ability to {{hit him in the}} groin and follow-up by slamming him face-first into the mat with his signature X-Factor maneuver.|$|E
5|$|When cats become aggressive, {{they try}} to make {{themselves}} appear larger and more threatening by raising their fur, arching their backs, turning sideways and hissing or spitting. Often, the ears are pointed down and back to avoid damage to the inner ear and potentially listen for any changes behind them while focused forward. They may also vocalize loudly and bare their teeth in an effort to further intimidate their opponent. Fights usually consist of grappling and delivering powerful slaps <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> and body with the forepaws as well as bites. Cats also throw themselves to the ground in a defensive posture to rake their opponent's belly with their powerful hind legs.|$|E
