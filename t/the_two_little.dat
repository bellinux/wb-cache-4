25|$|In those days, {{railroad}} {{and real estate}} attorneys generally practiced in only one state, with land matters (such as right-of-way) generally handled in various local county courts.

25|$|By 1930, when he {{attended}} the First Balkan Conference {{as a member of}} its Intellectual Committee, Batzaria had become known for his genre fiction novels, addressed to a general public and registering much success. Among these were Jertfa Lilianei ("Liliana's Sacrifice"), Răpirea celor două fetițe ("The Kidnapping of <b>the</b> <b>Two</b> <b>Little</b> Girls"), Micul lustragiu ("The Little Shoeshiner") and Ina, fetița prigonită ("Ina, the Persecuted Little Girl"). His main fairy tale collection was published as Povești de aur ("Golden Stories"). Also in 1930, he worked state-approved textbooks for the 2nd, 3rd and 4th grades, co-authored with P. Puchianu and D. Stoica and published by Scrisul Românesc of Craiova.|$|E

[...] Le Faye writes that, [...] "Mr Austen's predictions for his younger daughter were fully justified. Never were sisters more to each other than Cassandra and Jane; while in a particularly affectionate family there {{seems to have been a}} special link between Cassandra and Edward on the one hand, and between Henry and Jane on the other." ...|$|E

500|$|Whistler {{started on}} Symphony in White, No. 3 perhaps {{as early as}} July 1865. It {{was the last of}} his {{paintings}} for which Heffernan was a model. He used Milly Jones, the wife of an actor friend, as the second model for the painting. By the middle of August, he had a complete sketch ready, and he continued work on the painting into September. Whistler kept reworking it, however, and it was not until 1867 that he considered it finished. He painted over the final [...] "5" [...] in the date, and replaced it with a [...] "7", to mark the changes it had undergone. In March 1867, William Michael Rossetti wrote of seeing the painting in Whistler's studio, and mentioned that it was previously called <b>The</b> <b>Two</b> <b>Little</b> White Girls. It then went on display at the Royal Academy.|$|E

2500|$|Phase 1 of the {{restoration}} involved the first [...] {{of the canal}} from Bulbourne Junction (...) to Little Tring Farm (...) [...] Major engineering work included the refurbishment of the stop lock, {{and the construction of}} a winding basin at the terminus, to allow boats to turn round. Between <b>the</b> <b>two,</b> <b>Little</b> Tring Road crossed the course of the canal on an embankment which was constructed in 1973 when the original bridge was demolished. This was replaced by a new reinforced concrete bridge, built to a traditional design, which is faced with bricks to give it an authentic appearance. It was funded by the Wendover Arm Trust, and the award-winning bridge was completed by British Waterways in 2000–01 at a cost of £223,000.|$|E

2500|$|Central High School {{was founded}} in 1866 in {{response}} to student requests. Before 1866, there were no educational opportunities in Saint Paul beyond grade school. About a dozen students wished to continue their schooling so, in 1866, two rooms were {{set aside for the}} [...] "High School" [...] {{on the third floor of}} the Franklin School building, located at Broadway and Tenth Streets in downtown Saint Paul. Some people thought that the school was a waste of space. Eugene Foster (known as the [...] "Father of the High School") was the principal, and Mrs. H.M. Haynes was the lone teacher. The first graduating class of the Saint Paul High School was in 1870, and consisted of two students: Fannie Haynes (the daughter of the teacher), and A. P. Warren. The first 2 diplomas were hand printed on sheepskin. Gradually, the classes enrolled in the Franklin Building became too large for <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>little</b> rooms to accommodate them.|$|E
2500|$|SFGate {{described}} the [...] "show-tune- style songs" [...] as [...] "pleasant but forgettable", adding that [...] "the singing by Short, Belushi, Curry and Broadway belter Golden {{is the best}} thing about the film". It also noted that [...] "One of the obvious obstacles was how to color a film whose natural shadings tend toward black, white and degrees of gray. The result is a lot of odd but fascinating colorations -- the sky might turn up yellow at times, or the sea a deep maroon". The Spokesman-Review wrote [...] "in an era when G-rated movies are as rare as Hollywood humility, any attempt at family entertainment should be lauded", adding [...] "let us salute Don Bluth and his team of animators". In a rare case, The Daily Gazette gave the film 4 stars. The Animated Movie Guide said the film was an [...] "utter waste of talent and resources", due to interference from external forces. Monica Sullivan of Movie Magazine International noted that the film was [...] "heartily enjoyed by <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>little</b> girls who saw it with me at a kiddie matinee".|$|E
