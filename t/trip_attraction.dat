Usually <b>trip</b> <b>attraction</b> volumes are estimated based on land use characteristics. However, executing of land use-based <b>trip</b> <b>attraction</b> models are severely constrained {{by the lack of}} updated land use data in developing countries. The proposed method used network centrality-based explanatory variables as “connectivity”, “local integration” and “global integration”. Space syntax tools were used to compute the centrality of road segments. GIS-based kernel density estimation method was used to transform computed road segment-based centrality values into traffic analysis zone. <b>Trip</b> <b>attraction</b> values exhibited significant high correlation with connectivity, global and local integration values. The study developed and validated model to estimate <b>trip</b> <b>attraction</b> by using connectivity, local integration and global integration values as endogenous variables with an accepted level of accuracy (R 2  >  0. 75). The proposed approach required minimal data, and it was easily executed using a geographic information system.

The on-going project funded by FDOT, related to TBEST, aims at further enhancing {{the capabilities of the}} TBEST model based on additional opportunities identified by the research team. The project focuses on enhancing TBEST’s capabilities in following areas: 1) Improving the precision of socio- demographic data by using property appraisal data (parcel data) and, 2) Improving the quality of data regarding <b>trip</b> <b>attraction.</b> Based on the improvement areas, this study aims at performing an exploratory analysis to 1) Identify the differences in activity levels (population and employment) within transit stop buffers due to change in input data i. e. from aggregate census data to disaggregate parcel data. 2) Explore various strategies (development of employment based <b>trip</b> <b>attraction</b> and, parcel land use based <b>trip</b> <b>attraction</b> and exploring how special generators are dealt with in the past studies) to enhance the <b>trip</b> <b>attraction</b> capability of the TBEST model. The results obtained from this analysis provide insights on the strategies and helps define suggestions to further enhance the precision of TBEST model. The results show that use of parcel level data improves the accuracy in capturing the activity levels within the catchment area of each stop. The results also suggest use of parcel land use based <b>trip</b> <b>attraction</b> for stops with special generators or use of interaction variable (interaction between special generator dummy and size (square footage etc.) of the special generator) to enhance the <b>trip</b> <b>attraction</b> capability of the TBEST model...|$|E

40|$|Trip {{distribution}} {{is the second}} step of the transport modelling process. Errors in this trip distribution step will propagate through the other stages of the transport modelling process and will affect {{the reliability of the}} model outputs. Therefore, finding a robust and efficient method for trip distribution has always been an objective of transport modellers. The problem of trip {{distribution is}} non-linear and complex. Neural networks (NNs) have been used effectively in different disciplines for solving nonlinear problems. Accordingly, in this paper, a new NN model has been researched to estimate the distribution of the journey to work trips. This research is unique in two aspects: firstly, the training of the model was based on a generalised regression neural network (GRNN) algorithm, while the majority of previous studies have used a backpropagation (BP) algorithm. The advantage of the GRNN model over other feed-forward or feed-back neural network techniques is the simplicity and practicality of the model. The second unique aspect is that the input data for the GRNN model was based on land use data for each pair of zones and the corresponding distance between them, while the previous NN models used <b>trip</b> productions, <b>trip</b> <b>attractions</b> and the distance between a pair of zones as inputs. As a case study, the model was applied to the journey to work trips in the City of Mandurah in Western Australia.

40|$|This paper conducts an {{exploratory}} analysis of freight <b>trip</b> <b>attraction</b> {{and its relationship}} with key features of the urban environment. Using establishment level data, the authors explore the role of business attributes, as well as network and land use descriptors. The research uses data from 343 establishments from five different industry sectors in New York City. These establishments are geo-located, and spatial association indicators are estimated to assess the presence of spatial effects. Spatial econometric techniques are {{used to assess the}} role of spatial effects among establishments and the urban environment. The empirical evidence suggests that establishments’ location, such as land-value and front street width, play an important role on freight <b>trip</b> <b>attraction</b> (FTA), and that retail industries located in high employment zones tend to produce higher FTA per employee. Another key finding is that FTA is better modeled using non-linear models for all industry sectors. Specifically, the freight <b>trip</b> <b>attraction</b> of business establishments is concave with employment, flattening as employment increases. This is confirmed by the modeling results for which the range of coefficients estimated for employment reveals that, although larger establishments have higher FTA than small establishments, FTA increases at a diminishing marginal rate. These exploratory findings shed light on the use of locational variables, and nonlinear spatial effects specifications to enhance FTA models...|$|E

40|$|Parking cost is an {{important}} and sensitive factor in understanding travel behavior and is typically utilized in the mode choice model of regional demand forecasting models. There are various socio-economics variables that can affect the value of parking cost by employment type, time periods, and trip purposes. In this study, a set of parking cost forecasting models are developed using survey data and local socio-economic data {{with the objective of}} identifying parking cost patterns and forecasting future parking costs. This study first summarizes methods applied in previous parking cost forecasting models. Two categories of models were estimated. The first category does not consider parking space supply as a factor in forecasting TAZ parking; the second category considers both parking space supply and parking demand as explanatory variables. For each category, using current off-street parking cost survey data, linear regression models are built for hourly, daily and monthly pricing for SCAG Tier 2 Transportation Analysis Zones (TAZ) using R and Matlab. Daily parking rates are set as the base rates to generate the hourly and monthly parking cost models. The consideration of parking demand is a major contribution of this study, with demand generated based on home-based-work <b>trip</b> <b>attractions</b> for commuters by income groups in all models. This study found that daily parking rates can be explained by total employment, the proportion of office to total jobs, and the proportion of multiple to total households. Hourly parking cost can be explained based on daily parking rates and travel behavior associated with education, hospital, finance, entertainment and other employment types. The monthly parking cost model is built base on both daily and hourly parking rates as independent variables.

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} is to develop a robust {{methodology}} for computing zone centrality measures in an urban area. Centrality refers to the relative importance of a zone in terms of network efficiency and utility for both transportation and urban study. Centrality indices that were developed to describe human relationships in the field of structural sociology were adopted. It is important to accommodate the neighborhood effect in dealing with centrality. The neighborhood effect describes the phenomenon whereby the attractiveness of a specific zone is affected by its neighbor zones. Kernel functions were employed to accommodate the neighborhood effect. The optimal bandwidth parameters were derived indirectly within the framework of <b>trip</b> <b>attraction</b> estimation under the assumption that the <b>trip</b> <b>attraction</b> of a zone is influenced by the integrated centrality, which includes the neighborhood effect.

40|$|The four-step {{procedure}} for travel demand modeling is ubiquitously {{used in the}} United States and elsewhere due to institutional and financial requirements. Trip generation analysis, {{which is the first}} step, is based on traffic analysis zones which are geographical units. Therefore, the zonal trip generation totals are observations measured at different geographical locations. Spatial distribution of the observations limits the methods that can be applied in analyzing the data and influences the final conclusions that can be reached. Most past efforts of incorporating spatial effects in trip generation models have been using contiguity of the zones as the major criterion for defining spatial relationship of the observations. In this study, we tested for the presence of spatial auto-correlation in both <b>trip</b> <b>attraction</b> and trip production variables. We found significant spatial auto-correlation in <b>trip</b> <b>attraction</b> variables but insignificant spatial auto-correlation in trip production variables for the data collected from the Las Vegas valley. We evaluated four alternative methods for defining geographical connectivity: (1) contiguity, (2) separation, (3) combined contiguity and separation, and (4) economic linkage (accessibility measure). Comparison of the <b>trip</b> <b>attraction</b> model indicated that the model estimated using geographical connectivity matrix with elements defined by separation (distance between centroids of the zones) was the best fitted. A further comparison indicated that this model outperformed the one without spatial variables by minimizing deviation of the modeled trips from observed trips.
