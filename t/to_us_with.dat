As {{a result of the}} Mexican–American War of 1846–48, the territory of Alta California, including San Diego, was ceded to the United States by Mexico, {{under the terms of the}} Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848. The Mexican negotiators of that treaty tried to retain San Diego as part of Mexico, but the Americans insisted that San Diego was [...] "for every commercial purpose of nearly equal importance <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>with</b> that of San Francisco," [...] and the Mexican–American border was eventually established to be one league south of the southernmost point of San Diego Bay, so as to include the entire bay within the United States.|$|E
500|$|New Media {{consultants}} and scientists Robert Chiappetta and Glen Whitman aided {{in the production}} of the episode. They had worked on the series throughout the first season, with their role ranging from directly writing episodes to advising the others on scientific concepts. Whitman later explained that they [...] "come <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>with</b> questions: Is this possible? Where can we go with this? Then we go and read the very technical articles, or talk with scientists, and then translate that into the storytelling medium of our show." [...] For [...] "The Road Not Taken", he and Chiappetta were asked to again [...] "find a new and gruesome way to blow people up," [...] this time by rooting it in the concept of pyrokinesis. Chiappetta explained, [...] "They wanted to have someone spontaneously combust and burn up. So this is where we sort of leaned back into our mythology." ...|$|E
500|$|When the castle's {{outer walls}} were {{eventually}} breached, the defenders {{retreated to the}} relative safety of the keep. It too withstood {{the efforts of the}} siege engines, and once again John turned to mining to bring down the walls. The mine was dug beneath the south-east corner of the keep. A letter sent from Rochester on 25November offers insight into the methods of medieval siegecraft. John ordered Hugh de Burgh to [...] "send <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>with</b> all speed by day and night forty of the fattest pigs of the sort least good for eating to bring fire beneath the tower". The wooden props supporting the tunnel dug beneath the keep were set alight to collapse the mine, bringing down one corner of the keep. Still the garrison held out and sought safety behind the stone partition or cross-wall in the keep, abandoning half the building. The Barnwell chronicler remarked that [...] "for such was the structure of the stronghold that a very strong wall separated the half that had fallen from the other".|$|E

2500|$|Some Arab {{commentators}} had a {{more negative}} response. Rami Khouri, the editor of The Daily Star {{and director of the}} Issam Fares Institute at the American University of Beirut, argued that Obama gave [...] "a lot of good, positive vibes" [...] but, ultimately, it [...] "was only rhetoric". He referred to what he saw as the hypocrisy of Obama praising human rights after meeting with Egyptian and Saudi leaders who have suppressed those same rights. He stated that the Muslim world is still waiting for Obama's words to [...] "translate" [...] into real policy. Al Jazeera bureau chief Abderrahim Foukara made similar remarks, saying, [...] "he talked about Palestinians killing Israelis, but he didn't talk a lot about Israelis killing Palestinians, especially {{in the context of the}} latest Israeli war on Gaza." [...] Foukara also said, [...] "he's come <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>with</b> his message of peace, but there are U.S. forces in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and there are civilians being killed there by American forces." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ibn Bahdal still favored Khalid ibn Yazid and {{presided over}} {{a meeting of the}} Umayyad family and the Syrian ashraf, {{excluding}} Ubayd Allah, to settle the matter of Mu'awiyah II's succession. The meeting was not held in the capital Damascus where al-Dahhak, whose allegiance was still under suspicion, ruled, but in Jabiyah, a major town in Jordan district. Al-Dahhak did not attend the meeting, having been convinced by the ashraf of Qays to boycott and mobilize for war. At the Jabiyah summit, Ibn Bahdal declared Ibn al-Zubayr to be a munafiq (hypocrite) who betrayed the Umayyad cause. The attending ashraf agreed, but also rejected both Khalid and 'Abd Allah, saying [...] "we dislike the idea that the others [...] should come <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>with</b> a shaykh [...] while bring them a youngster". After forty days of talks, the Jabiyah summit concluded with an agreement nominating Marwan as the new caliph. Though Ibn Bahdal's candidate was rejected, he managed to secure a stipulation whereby Khalid would succeed Marwan. Moreover, in exchange for his nomination, Marwan had financial and administrative obligations to Ibn Bahdal, the Banu Kalb and the attending ashraf.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the diary}} she often talks {{about keeping the}} [...] "boys" [...] and the [...] "baby" [...] (Alfred) safe during the siege and retreat:This was Johnny's fourth birthday, a sad one to us all. We managed to get some toys for Johnny from a {{merchant}} inside. (16 July)Johnny was not well to-day, and I feared he might be sickening for small-pox. (31 July)Johnny's rosy cheeks, which he never lost, excited great admiration; he passed {{most of his time}} in the square next <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>with</b> the Sikhs, who were very fond of him, and used to give him chappatties (native bread), though they could not have had much to eat themselves, poor men! (28 August) [...] Mrs. Case and Johnny were walking in the square next to ours to-day, when a Sikh officer passed them, and directly afterwards he was hit in the arm by a bullet. No place was really safe, and I never liked having the children out of my sight. (18 October) During the siege, we had picked up a little white hen, which used to run about and pick up what it could. Just before Colonel Campbell became so very ill, we had decided to kill and eat it, when one morning Johnny ran in and said, 'Oh, mamma, the white hen has laid an egg!' We took it at once to Colonel Campbell, it being a great luxury in those days. The hen laid one every day for him till he died, and then ceased for the rest of the siege; but we would not kill it then. (12 November) I had at first put the two boys into a dhoolie with their ayah, but they got separated from us, and it was fully a quarter of an hour before I found them, so I would not let them go from me again [...] [...] [...] poor baby, who was very thirsty, cried louder for it [...] than I had ever heard him before. With difficulty I pacified him, and succeeded in getting him to sleep. [...] (19 November) ...|$|E
