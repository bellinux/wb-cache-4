5|$|After World War I, most battleships, {{dreadnought}} and pre-dreadnought alike, were disarmed {{under the}} terms of the Washington Naval Treaty.

5|$|After {{returning}} to Germany, Emden was assigned <b>to</b> <b>training</b> duties once again. She continued {{in this role}} until June 1942, by which time a major overhaul was in order. The refit was completed in Wilhelmshaven, after which Emden returned <b>to</b> <b>training</b> cadets. In September 1944, she was deployed to Norway, where she served as the flagship of the minelaying forces there. While in Norway, she participated in several minelaying operations through October, when she was transferred to convoy escort duty; her primary task was to protect convoys {{in and out of}} Oslo. This lasted until December, when she ran aground in the Oslofjord off the island of Flateguri. Her guns were removed while repairs were partially effected in the Schichau-Werke. Before departing East Prussia, she took on the remains of Paul von Hindenburg and his wife to carry them to mainland Germany. They had been disinterred to prevent them from falling {{into the hands of the}} advancing Soviet Army. The repair work on the ship was not yet completed, and so she was towed to Pillau, where the Hindenburgs' remains were taken off. Emdens engines were put back in working order, though she was incapable of reaching top speed, and her guns were reinstalled.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} survey of {{approaches}} for providing broadband Internet access <b>to</b> <b>trains.</b> We examine some of the barriers that hinder the use of broadband Internet on trains and then discuss some of the opportunities for broadband deployment <b>to</b> <b>trains.</b> This survey considers {{some of the basic}} concepts for providing broadband Internet access and then reviews associated network architectures. The review of network architectures shows that we can subdivide networks for providing broadband Internet access <b>to</b> <b>trains</b> into the train-based network, the access network—for connecting the <b>train</b> <b>to</b> the service provider(s) —and the aggregation network—for collecting user packets generated in the access network for transmission to the Internet. Furthermore, our review shows that the current trend is to provide Internet access <b>to</b> passengers on <b>trains</b> using IEEE 802. 11; however, a clear method for how <b>to</b> connect <b>trains</b> <b>to</b> the global Internet has yet to emerge. A summary of implementation efforts in Europe and North America serves to highlight some of the schemes that have been used thus far <b>to</b> connect <b>trains</b> <b>to</b> the Internet. We conclude by discussing some of the models developed, from a technical perspective, to test the viability of deploying Internet access <b>to</b> <b>trains.</b> i...|$|R
