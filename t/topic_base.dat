Here we investigate whether the community sentiment energy of a topic is related to the spreading popularity of the topic. To compute the community sentiment energy of a topic, we first analyze the sentiment of a user on the key phrases of the <b>topic</b> <b>based</b> on the recent tweets of the user. Then we compute the total sentiment energy of all users in the community on the <b>topic</b> <b>based</b> on the Markov Random Field (MRF) model and graph entropy model. Experiments on two communities find the linear correlation between the community sentiment energy and the real spreading popularity of <b>topics.</b> <b>Based</b> on the finding, we proposed two models to predict the popularity of topics. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the two models and the helpful of sentiment in predicting the popularity of topics. Experiments also show that community sentiment affects collective decision making of spreading a topic or not in the community. Comment: Journal of Intelligent Information System...|$|R

In this paper, we propose a three-phase approach to <b>topic</b> <b>based</b> document clustering. In the first phase, we {{determine the best}} topic model and present a formal concept about significance degree of topics and some topic selection criteria, through which we can find the best number of the most suitable topics from the original topic model discovered by LDA. Then, we choose the initial clustering centers by using the k-means++ algorithm. In the third phase, we take the obtained initial clustering centers and use the k-means algorithm for document clustering. Three clustering solutions based on the three phase approach are used for document clustering. The related experiments of the three solutions are made for comparing and illustrating the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
