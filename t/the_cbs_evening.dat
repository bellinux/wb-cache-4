40|$|Block {{copolymers}} {{that combine}} a side-group liquid crystalline polymer (SGLCP) block and a pH-responsivehydrophilic block, poly(acrylic acid) (PAA), are shown to confer pH-dependent anchoring {{of the director}} orientation at the aqueous/LC interface. The SGLCP block, poly(4 -cyanobiphenyl- 4 -oxyundecylacrylate), was chosen based {{on its ability to}} influence the director field of <b>the</b> 5 <b>CB</b> (4 -cyano- 4 '-pentylbiphenyl). At low pH the PAA block collapses and the inherent, planar alignment tendency of 5 CB at a water interface prevails. As pH increases, the polyelectrolyte block becomes increasingly charged and expands, producing a change to homeotropic anchoring. The change in anchoring occurs as quickly as the buffer can be changed (within 2 s) and is reversible, with a response that is repeatable over as many cycles as were tested (approximately 20 cycles). The polymer-mediated anchoring persists for 6 days, indicating that the SGLCP block secures the self-assembled layer on <b>the</b> 5 <b>CB,</b> <b>even</b> under conditions that cause repulsive interactions among the PAA blocks. Thus, SGLCP blocks can translate conformational changes of a responsive hydrophilic block into rapid, reversible changes in the director fiel...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} has the objective to investigate immunohistochemical expression of CB 1 receptor and its probable changes in Gastroenteropancreatic system (GEP) of obese and lean Zucker rats {{and understand the}} endocannabinoid pathophysiological implications in the obesity. Male obese (fa/fa) and lean Zucker rats 6 weeks old were obtained from Harlan Italy Srl; the rats were sacrificed at 8, 12 and 16 weeks old. Normal rats also were sacrificed. Specimens of stomach, jejunum-ileum and pancreas were fixed in Bouin’s mixture and embedded in paraffin; obtained sections were processed with anti-CB 1 (Biosource Europe SA) by Streptavidin-Biotin-Complex Method. The findings show that CB 1 receptor is expressed not only in enteric neurons as documented by earlier studies up to now but more widely and with stronger intensity in obese animals compared with their lean counterparts by several structures of gastrointestinal tract (epithelium, glands, endocrine cells and immune cells of villi stroma). In obese Zucker rats pancreas unlike the normal rats where <b>the</b> <b>CB</b> 1 receptor is essentially expressed by A-cells, <b>the</b> <b>CB</b> 1 immunoreactivity <b>even</b> extends with higher intensity to B-cells. It is concluded that GEP System represents a new and wide peripheral target of EC action that have a direct autocrine, endocrine-paracrine and neurocrine control on many functions of GEP.

40|$|The {{development}} of new therapeutic strategies {{is essential for the}} management of gliomas, one of the most malignant forms of cancer. We have shown previously that the growth of the rat glioma C 6 cell line is inhibited by psychoactive cannabinoids (I. Galve-Roperh et al., Nat. Med., 6 : 313 – 319, 2000).

40|$|<b>The</b> {{carotid body}} (<b>CB)</b> {{is in charge}} of {{adjusting}} ventilatory and cardiovascular function during changes in arterial blood gases. Regardless this essential function, <b>the</b> <b>CB</b> has been implicated in the sensing of other physiological signals such as changes in blood flow and glucose levels. More important, malfunction of <b>the</b> <b>CB</b> chemoreceptors has been associated with the progression and deterioration of several disease states such as hypertension, heart failure, renal failure, insulin resistance, diabetes and sleep apnea. Although the mechanisms involved in the alterations of <b>the</b> <b>CB</b> function in pathophysiology are currently under intense research, the development of therapeutic approaches to restore normal CB chemoreflex function remains unsolved. Recent studies showing <b>the</b> effect of <b>CB</b> denervation in pathophysiology have unveiled a key role of these arterial chemoreceptors in the development of autonomic imbalance and respiratory disturbances, and suggest that targeting <b>the</b> <b>CB</b> could represent a novel strategy to improve disease outcome. Unfortunately, classical pharmacotherapy intended to normalize CB function may be hard to establish since several cellular pathways are involved in <b>the</b> <b>CB</b> dysfunction. Augmented levels of angiotensin II, endothelin- 1, cytokines and free radicals along with decreases in nitric oxide had all been related to <b>the</b> <b>CB</b> dysfunction. Moreover, changes in expression of angiotensin receptors, nitric oxide synthases and cytokines that take place within <b>the</b> <b>CB</b> tissue in pathological states also contribute to <b>the</b> enhanced <b>CB</b> chemoreflex drive.

25|$|During {{the early}} part of his tenure {{anchoring}} <b>the</b> <b>CBS</b> <b>Evening</b> News, Cronkite competed against NBC's anchor team of Chet Huntley and David Brinkley, who anchored the Huntley-Brinkley Report. For much of the 1960s, the Huntley-Brinkley Report had more viewers than Cronkite's broadcast. A key moment for Cronkite came during his coverage of John F. Kennedy's assassination on November 22, 1963. Another factor in Cronkite and CBS' ascendancy {{to the top of the}} ratings was that, as the decade progressed, RCA made a corporate decision not to fund NBC News at the levels that CBS provided for its news broadcasts. Consequently, CBS News acquired a reputation for greater accuracy and depth in coverage.

30|$|<b>The</b> <b>Cb</b> {{value is}} a useful {{parameter}} for estimating the humidity control capacity of materials.

However, because {{it takes a long time}} to obtain <b>the</b> <b>Cb</b> values for materials at each temperature variation period, we developed an easier method based on a linear excitation-response theory to obtain <b>the</b> <b>Cb</b> values without measuring at each period. Japanese cedar was the material used in this study. The temperature excitation, a jump from a constant temperature to another constant temperature, was used to obtain the absolute humidity response.
