500|$|More than {{a century}} after his death, {{literary}} critics such as G. Birkbeck Hill and T. S. Eliot came to regard Johnson as a serious critic. They began to study Johnson's works with an increasing focus on the critical analysis found in his edition of Shakespeare and Lives of the Poets. Yvor Winters claimed that [...] "A great critic is the rarest of all literary geniuses; perhaps the only critic in English who deserves that epithet is Samuel Johnson". F. R. Leavis agreed and, on Johnson's criticism, said, [...] "When we read him we know, beyond question, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>here</b> a powerful and distinguished mind operating at first hand upon literature. This, we can say with emphatic conviction, really is criticism". Edmund Wilson claimed that [...] "The Lives of the Poets and the prefaces and commentary on Shakespeare {{are among the most}} brilliant and the most acute documents in the whole range of English criticism". The critic Harold Bloom placed Johnson's work firmly within the Western canon, describing him as [...] "unmatched by any critic in any nation before or after him...Bate in the finest insight on Johnson I know, emphasised that no other writer is so obsessed by the realisation that the mind is an activity, one that will turn to destructiveness of the self or of others unless it is directed to labour." [...] It is no wonder that his philosophical insistence that the language within literature must be examined became a prevailing mode of literary theory during the mid-20th century.|$|E
500|$|Rater {{noted that}} the balance Meredith had just found in her life, finally having a chance at {{happiness}} with the man she loves, is shaken by her mother's unexpected lucidity, which was stated to have been written in the series in order to remind Meredith about the troubled years of her growing up: [...] "If Meredith {{is ever going to}} be happy, she's got to {{deal with the fact that}} she had a really terrible childhood." [...] In addition, Rater explained that Ellis' [...] "awful, raw, ugly and terrible" [...] statements towards her daughter were intended to make everyone realize the reason behind Meredith's alcoholism in college and her continuous one-night stands with inappropriate men. She also deemed Pompeo's performance in the episode [...] "exceptional", describing what she regarded an [...] "exceptional moment" [...] which sees Meredith stand up to her mother. In response to the scene that sees Ellis interacting with Webber, Rater wrote that it is the first time she lets her guard down, exposing the previously hidden vulnerability, which allows her express the desire to be as happy and ordinary as her daughter. She also praised the performances of the cast, by deeming their acting [...] "remarkable". [...] "That is really what it's all about. We have to cherish the time <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>here,</b> and love the people who surround and support us, even if they make us crazy, because things happen. Brain surgery, Alzheimer's and weddings. And the worst thing is to come to the end of your life, and realize, like Ellis, that you should have tried harder", stated Rater, putting the emphasis on the main aspects of the episode, characterizing it as [...] "not ordinary".|$|E

2500|$|The Senators were {{particularly}} interested in how Bolshevism had united many disparate elements on the left, including anarchists and socialists of many types, [...] "providing a common platform for all these radical groups to stand on." [...] Senator Knute Nelson, Republican of Minnesota, responded by enlarging Bolshevism's embrace to include an even larger segment of political opinion: [...] "Then they have really rendered a service to the various classes of progressives and reformers <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>here</b> in this country." [...] Other witnesses described {{the horrors of the}} revolution in Russia and the consequences of a comparable revolution in the United States: the imposition of atheism, the seizure of newspapers, assaults on banks and the abolition of the insurance industry.

2500|$|There is even {{a further}} {{suggestion}} that Drews has noticed. Why was the reversal of the order made? Evidently to bring the Intercession before the Consecration. This means to change from the same order as Antioch to that of Alexandria. Is it too much to suppose <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>here</b> a case of Alexandrine influence at Rome? Now it is noticeable that Gelasius personally had a great reverence for the venerable [...] "second See" [...] founded by St. Mark, and that since 482 Bishop John Talaia of Alexandria, being expelled from his own Church by the Monophysites, sought and found refuge in Rome. He would have celebrated his own liturgy in the pope's city, and was certainly greatly honoured as a confessor and exile for the Faith. May we then even {{go so far as}} to suggest that we owe the present certainly unusual order of our Canon to Gelasius and the influence of John Talaia? So far Drews (p.38).|$|E
2500|$|Dorothy L. Sayers {{notes that}} Satan's three faces are thought {{by some to}} suggest his control over the three human races: red for the Europeans (from Japheth), yellow for the Asiatic (from Shem), and black for the African (the race of Ham). All interpretations {{recognize}} that the three faces represent a fundamental perversion of the Trinity: Satan is impotent, ignorant, and full of hate, {{in contrast to the}} all-powerful, all-knowing, and all-loving nature of God. Lucifer retains his six wings (he originally belonged to the angelic order of Seraphim, described in Isaiah 6:2), but these are now dark, bat-like, and futile: the icy wind that emanates from the beating of Lucifer's wings only further ensures his own imprisonment in the frozen lake. He weeps from his six eyes, and his tears mix with bloody froth and pus as they pour down his three chins. Each face has a mouth that chews eternally on a prominent traitor. Marcus Junius Brutus and Gaius Cassius Longinus dangle with their feet in the left and right mouths, respectively, for their involvement in the assassination of Julius Caesar (March 15, 44 BC) – an act which, to Dante, represented the destruction of a unified Italy and the killing of the man who was divinely appointed to govern the world. In the central, most vicious mouth is Judas Iscariot, the apostle who betrayed Christ. Judas is receiving the most horrifying torture of the three traitors: his head is gnawed inside Lucifer's mouth while his back is forever flayed and shredded by Lucifer's claws. According to Dorothy L. Sayers, [...] "just as Judas figures treason against God, so Brutus and Cassius figure treason against Man-in-Society; or we may say <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>here</b> the images of treason against the Divine and the Secular government of the world".|$|E

60|$|It {{was perhaps}} a parrot of this rare kind which played so {{important}} {{a part in}} the early history of South America. It is nothing but a legend of the Guarani nation, which inhabit Paraguay, nevertheless I do believe <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>here</b> an account mainly true of an important event in the early history of the race or nation. This parrot is not the impossible bird of the fictitious Totá Kahami order we all know, who not only mimics our speech but knows the meaning of the words he utters. He was nothing but a mimic, exceptionally clever, and the moral of the story is the familiar one that great events may proceed from the most trivial causes, once the passions of men are inflamed.|$|E
60|$|Let {{us first}} examine the antiquated theory, {{as it must}} now be called. By {{bringing}} a raptorial insect and a firefly together, {{we find that the}} flashing light of the latter does actually scare away the former, and is therefore, for the moment, a protection as effectual as the camp-fire the traveller lights in a district abounding with beasts of prey. Notwithstanding this fact, and assuming <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>here</b> the whole reason of the existence of the light-emitting power, a study of the firefly's habits compels us to believe that the insect would be just as well off without the power as with it. Probably it experiences some pleasure in emitting flashes of light during its evening pastimes, but this could scarcely be considered an advantage in its struggle for existence, and it certainly does not account for the possession of the faculty.|$|E

Such a book as the [...] "Roll-Call" [...] could have been penned only by one who knows and loves every feature in that glorious old pile; who has wandered through its aisles every hour of the day and night; who has watched the wondrous effects produced by the subtlest changes of light and temperature: one, in short, who for upwards of twenty years has drunk deeply of the spirit which haunts Westminster Abbey from end to end. We must therefore offer a hearty welcome to this really excellent work, and we are convinced that the great mass of historical material which it contains will become more and more valuable as time goes on.' ...|$|E
60|$|All this {{moral and}} even metaphysical {{generalisation}} was most fairly and most faithfully reproduced by the interviewer, who had actually heard it casually and idly spoken.

When I spoke I not only did not know that there was any trolley strike, but I did not know what a trolley strike was. I should have had an indistinct idea {{that a large number of}} citizens earned their living by carrying things about in wheel-barrows, and that they had desisted from the beneficent activities.

60|$|Animal Life of Formosa.--We are {{at present}} acquainted {402} with 35 species of mammalia, and 128 species of land-birds from Formosa, {{fourteen}} {{of the former}} and forty-three of the latter being peculiar, while the remainder inhabit also {{some part of the}} continent or adjacent islands. This proportion of peculiar species is perhaps (as regards the birds) the highest to be met with in any island which can be classed as both continental and recent, and this, in all probability, implies that the epoch of separation is somewhat remote. It was not, however, remote enough to reach back to a time when the continental fauna was very different from what it is now, for we find all the chief types of living Asiatic mammalia represented in this small island. Thus we have monkeys; insectivora; numerous carnivora; pigs, deer, antelopes, and cattle among ungulata; numerous rodents, and the edentate Manis,--a very fair representation of Asiatic mammals, all being of known genera, and of species either absolutely identical with some still living elsewhere or very closely allied to them. The birds exhibit analogous phenomena, with the exception <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>here</b> two peculiar and very interesting genera.|$|E
