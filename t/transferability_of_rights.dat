Even though rights based systems are strongly based on considerations of efficiency, sometimes {{at the expense of}} maximization of employment, a number of such regimes have been put in place in recent years. These are generally little known and little analyzed. This paper attempts to address this gap in our knowledge by surveying such schemes. For a number of reasons outlined in the paper, rights based regimes in Canada have not usually involved transferability or divisibility of quotas. Nonetheless, efficiency gains have been made where such schemes have been implemented. These are illustrated in case studies of the Atlantic offshore groundfish fishery and the Atlantic purse seine herring fishery. fisheries management, property rights, quota values, limits on <b>transferability</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights,</b> rationalization of fisheries, Environmental Economics and Policy, Resource /Energy Economics and Policy,...|$|E

40|$|The {{constitutional}} reforms {{undertaken in}} Mexico in 1992, {{as well as}} the systematic implementation of a program <b>of</b> land <b>rights</b> regularization (Procede), aimed to improve the security and <b>transferability</b> <b>of</b> property <b>rights</b> in order to create the pre-conditions for better functioning of factor markets in rural areas. The paper examines the extent to which this has materialized by exploring systematic differences over time between certified and non-certified ejidos {{as well as the}} private sector. We find that land rental markets function better in ejidos that underwent Procede, where there was also a marked increase in households' use of common pasture land. At the same time, neither the reforms nor Procede appear to have had much impact on land sales markets and ejidatarios' credit access. Implications for policy and program design are discussed.

The empirical estimates support a robust positive effect from increasing the <b>transferability</b> <b>of</b> land <b>rights</b> on migration.

This study tries to examine the contribution of community forestry to household-level income with particular emphasis on group heterogeneity and equity in benefit distribution. The assessment of household level benefits suggests that poorer households are currently benefiting less in absolute terms from community forestry than less poor households. The study makes a number of recommendations to improve community forest management in Nepal, which include, due consideration for community needs in selecting species for community forestry, <b>transferability</b> <b>of</b> user <b>rights,</b> which would allow less endowed households to benefit more, and more and equitable representation of women and disadvantaged groups in forest management committees.

40|$|Historically, water {{consumption}} in the eastern United States has been governed by the common-law riparian doctrine. Fashioned to protect the domestic uses of private individuals in a largely agrarian society, the doctrine is not well suited to today 2 ̆ 7 s {{environment in which the}} demands of public users have grown enormously. Even in the East, where water has long been abundant, the effects of increased consumption, pollution, and periodic drought have brought the continued viability of the doctrine into question. Professor Butler examines the legal standards which have developed under the riparian doctrine and identifies three principal areas in which the doctrine must be modified in order to satisfy present and future needs of private and public users in the eastern states: (1) traditional restrictions on the land which may be benefitted by particular riparian rights, (2) the defining of 2 ̆ 2 reasonable use 2 ̆ 2 in terms of low-density domestic consumption, and (3) narrow restrictions on the <b>transferability</b> <b>of</b> riparian <b>rights.</b> The Article recommends that reforms be instituted, particularly in recognition of the essential role that public users now play in meeting consumptive needs. While changes are necessary, Professor Butler acknowledges that so long as the eastern states continue to enjoy relatively abundant water supplies legislatures will balk at instituting potentially costly overhauls of the common-law doctrine. Until the legislatures are willing to adopt comprehensive reforms, the judiciary must assume responsibility for striking a more realistic balance between the riparian <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> private individuals and the growing needs of public users. Reform will require the courts to be willing to interpret the riparian doctrine with more flexibility, to modify 2 ̆ 2 reasonable use 2 ̆ 2 to encompass expanding public use, and to permit freer <b>transferability</b> <b>of</b> consumptive <b>rights.</b> At the same time, courts must remain cognizant of the need to protect private users from unrestrained diversions by public entities. While this task may seem both arduous and thankless for the courts, the issue of water distribution is of such basic importance that the challenge ought not to be refused...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (LL. M. (Estate Law)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2008. In the South African law {{there are}} {{different}} rights regarding to objects. In this dissertation two specific kinds <b>of</b> limited real <b>rights</b> will be examined, namely usufruct and housing development schemes for retired persons. It seems that there are uncertainty in the South African law in regards to these two tipes <b>of</b> limited real <b>rights,</b> mainly the use and <b>transferability</b> <b>of</b> these <b>rights.</b> The aim <b>of</b> this dissertation is thus to analyse these two types <b>of</b> limited real <b>rights</b> from an estate planners point of view. Usufruct is still commonly used as an instrument in estate planning. The question still remains whether usufructus is useful. In the case of retirement villages limited real rights fulfill an extremely important function. Different types of housing schemes can be applicable to retirement villages. According to article 4 A of the Housing Development Schemes for Retired Persons Act interests in a retirement village always reside on a limited real right only if certain prescribed statutory formalities are met. This influence the use and <b>transferability</b> <b>of</b> an interest. It is necessary to analyse this influence from an estate planners {{point of view in}} order to determine the extend of the legal protection of the person concerned. Usufruct as estate planning instrument does not hold optimal advantages. Although estate duty can initially be saved capital gains tax can have negative impact in the future. An estate planner should advice his client to rather make use of a trust. The examination of housing development schemes in regards to retirement villages showed that the three schemes mostly used in South African law are underwritten by different rules and contain different rights. An estate planner must therefore inform his client about the consequences of the scheme in which he/she invests as well as the <b>transferability</b> <b>of</b> the scheme. Master...|$|R

40|$|Some authors {{defend the}} {{implementation}} of regulation mechanisms such as individual transferable quotas, that is, the capacity to assign every fisherman an individual right {{so that he can}} fish a certain quantity of a specific species during a concrete period of time, as {{the most efficient way to}} reach a greater resource assessment and to guarantee biological sustainability. Nevertheless, much attention has been brought to the fact that, since these rights can be sold, negotiated, exchanged or transferred by the owners, it can bring about a concentration process, which would not favour social equity. In Spain, fishing legislation has been moving progressively towards {{the implementation of}} individual transferable fishing rights with regard to industrial fishing in community waters, whereas it has also kept a more traditional access system regarding coastal fishing.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Growing {{demands for}} water {{traditionally}} are met by developing new water resources. Water resource managers typically grant new water rights until available water supplies are over-appropriated. In {{many parts of}} the world, however, water rights transfers are becoming more frequent as new water rights are increasingly difficult or impossible to obtain. Water markets are emerging in the western United States, where water rights more or less are freely exchanged. Many Latin American countries have sought to emulate this example. In particular, Chile is seen as a model where free market economic policies have been applied to facilitate the reallocation of water resources. The emergence of viable water markets depends on the existence of a number of conditions. These relate primarily to the predictability and <b>transferability</b> <b>of</b> water <b>rights,</b> the consequences for non-use, and the availability of alternative sources of supply. This paper presents the examples of Chile and the western United States legal and institutional frameworks for water resources reallocation. The two regions share many physical characteristics. Nevertheless, the water laws of Chile and the western United States present a stark contrast for comparison. The paper discusses both similarities and differences, and draws conclusions about the preconditions necessary for the emergence of viable water markets...|$|R

Yet the Land Code, {{which is the}} permanent law that interprets the constitution on land matters, stipulates that privately owned land in Turkmenistan is non-transferable: {{it may not be}} sold, given as a gift, or exchanged. The notion of private landownership in Turkmenistan is thus different from the accepted notion in market economies, where ownership implies full <b>transferability</b> <b>of</b> property <b>rights.</b> In practical terms, all land in Turkmenistan is controlled by the state, and it is basically the state that allocates land use rights to both leaseholders and dayhan farmers. The allocation <b>of</b> land use <b>rights</b> typically involves assignment of annual production targets in cotton and wheat. Leaseholders receive land in use rights from the state through the intermediation of the local peasant association (the lease term is usually 5-10 years). The lease is nontransferable: if a family cannot farm, the leasehold reverts to the association for reassignment. Dayhan farmers receive land directly from the state. Initially, the land is granted in use rights, but once the farmer has established a record of successful farming (within two-three years), the land is transferred into [...] "private ownership" [...] and the farmer receives a special [...] "land ownership certificate" [...] from the authorities. On the other hand, if the farmer fails to achieve satisfactory results, the land may be taken away by the state, even if it has the status of private ownership.|$|R

Compiled by Stefani J. Evers and Ann L. Shriver. International Institute of Fisheries Economics and Trade (IIFET), Corvallis, 2016. Proceedings of the Eighteenth Biennial Conference of the International Institute of Fisheries Economics and Trade, held July 11 - 15, 2016 at Aberdeen Exhibition and Conference Center (AECC), Aberdeen, Scotland, UK. The {{debate in}} {{commercial}} fishery management {{has evolved from}} whether well-defined rights are necessary for sustainability to evaluating {{the advantages and disadvantages}} <b>of</b> different <b>rights</b> based system designs. Two of Latin America's largest fisheries, the Chilean Jack Mackerel and Peruvian Anchovy, allocate quota at the vessel-level and restrict the lease of quota other than within firms and through the optional formation of associations. Transfer of a permanent allocation can only occur via vessel sale or removal from the fishery. This design impacts the divisibility and <b>transferability</b> <b>of</b> the <b>right.</b> Thus, incentives for permanent quota transfers and leases differ from those under a traditional individual transferable quota program. We use data on the Chilean Jack Mackerel fishery and examine multiple performance margins, tracking the evolution of the fishery after program implementation to explore the extent to which associations serve as a mechanism for fishery consolidation. We find evidence of consolidation, with the number of vessels decreasing to {{less than a third of}} the pre-program number by the 5 th year of the program. We also investigate vessel and trip characteristics, as well as trip costs and revenues. We estimate that the program led to a measurable increase in variable fishing profits, on the order of 33 - 35 % of ex-vessel revenue. Accompanying the increase was a movement toward higher value products, consolidation of catch on larger vessels, and vessels taking longer trips with greater catch-per-trip. Finally, we examine the performance of these defacto markets, considering both within firm and within association transfers over time...|$|R
40|$|Transport {{planning}} relies {{extensively on}} forecasts of traveller behaviour over horizons of 20 years and more. Implicit in such forecasts {{is the assumption}} that travellers tastes, as represented by the behavioural model parameters, are constant over time. This assumption {{is referred to as the}} temporal <b>transferability</b> <b>of</b> the models. This thesis presents four main contributions in this area. First, a comprehensive review <b>of</b> the <b>transferability</b> literature in the context <b>of</b> the temporal <b>transferability</b> <b>of</b> mode-destination models. This review demonstrated that there is little evidence about the <b>transferability</b> <b>of</b> mode-destination models over typical forecasting horizons, and further that most evidence is from models of commuter mode choice. Second, further empirical evidence on the temporal <b>transferability</b> <b>of</b> mode destination models using data from Toronto and Sydney for transfer periods of up to 20 years in duration. The <b>transferability</b> <b>of</b> commuter and non-commuter travel has been compared, and models of non-commute travel were found to be less temporally transferable. Improving model specification through fixed socio-economic parameters was found to improve model transferability, and the travel time and socio-economic parameters were found to be more transferability than the cost parameters and the model constants. Third, and most novel, what is believed to be the first empirical evidence on the impact of taking account of heterogeneity in cost and in-vehicle time sensitivity on the temporal <b>transferability</b> <b>of</b> mode-destination models. This analysis demonstrated that while accounting for taste heterogeneity led to a better fit to the base data, there was no evidence that these models were more transferable than models without random heterogeneity. This may be due to the taste heterogeneity specification over-fitting the base data. Fourth, practical recommendations are presented for model developers on how to maximise the <b>transferability</b> <b>of</b> mode-destination models used for assessing policy...|$|R
