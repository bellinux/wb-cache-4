5|$|After the 1954 New York State Thruway opened from Buffalo to New York City, Michigan {{officials}} encouraged Ontario {{to bypass}} Highway 3 as <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>direct</b> path from Detroit to Buffalo. By 1956, construction had begun on a segment between Highway4 in London and Highway2 in Woodstock, {{as well as}} on the section between Windsor and Tilbury.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, plans arose {{to connect}} Timmins with the Quebec border, and the route via Matheson {{was chosen as}} <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>direct</b> path. By {{the end of the}} war, the road between Hoyle and Matheson had been {{numbered}} as Highway101 and extended eastward to Abitibi, ending at Garrison Creek.|$|E
5|$|Samakh was {{regarded}} by both Allenby, the British {{commander of the}} Egyptian Expeditionary Force, and the German General Otto Liman von Sanders, commander of the Yildirim Army Group, as a key strategic point.

5|$|With the {{creation}} of a national Sejm in 1493, which took over the powers of taxation and the pospolite ruszenie previously granted to sejmiks at Nieszawa, the importance of regional governance somewhat diminished.

5|$|Elephant & Castle {{is located}} in the Elephant and Castle area of Newington in the London Borough of Southwark in central London. The station is in both Travelcard Zones 1 and 2 and is on the Bank branch of the Northern line between Kennington and Borough stations, and is the {{southern}} terminus of the Bakerloo line, the next station being Lambeth North. The station has two surface buildings, separated by a large traffic intersection.

5|$|On February 2, 1425, Bartolomeo Valori and Cosimo de' Medici {{requested}} 400 of the 800florins {{that had}} been deposited with the Calimala, likely for work already completed. This deposit was insurance in case the executors left the tomb unfinished and the Calimala was forced to pay for its completion, {{as it had been}} obliged to with the finger reliquary. This request is also <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>direct</b> piece of evidence for Cosimo's involvement with the commissioning. Despite this document, Vasari's claim in his Vite of 1550 that Cosimo was responsible for the handling of the commission has been questioned.|$|E

5|$|Although no {{documentary}} {{account of}} Gibraltar {{is available for}} the period following the Madinat al-Fath project, {{there are reasons to}} believe that a small fortified town existed in Gibraltar, and that its existence was the direct consequence of the fall of Tarifa in 1292. After the capture of the city, it was expected that Sancho would lay siege to Algeciras (it did not eventually happen) in order to sever <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>direct</b> links of the Marinids with the Iberian peninsula. The threatening presence of a Christian stronghold to the west would have led to the establishment of a garrison to the east of Algeciras. That way, Gibraltar would have protected the rearguard of Algeciras and provide a fallback position should Algeciras have fallen. At the same time, and with the increased presence of the Christian fleets in the Straits, Gibraltar provided an excellent lookout post.|$|E
5|$|Both {{direct and}} {{indirect}} ways {{have been found to}} indicate the presence of a wake depression. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>direct</b> is through the use of surface observations. Prior to the development of mesoscale weather station networks, or mesonets, it was difficult to locate wake lows. With the advent of mesoscale networks, wake lows have become easier to detect. On weather satellite and weather radar imagery, wake lows and heat bursts normally occur on the rear side of a precipitation area. However, within larger precipitation areas, they can be located within the area showing a minimum of returns. When using velocity data from a WSR-88D doppler radar, high winds on the back edge of reflectivity data can give away the location of a wake low.|$|E
5|$|Finding {{themselves}} {{surrounded by}} the Viet Minh, the French at Sop-Nao stood for six days while in radio contact with Teullier at the main strong point. The survivors, following authorisation from the French captain, retreated during the night of April 9/10 along a round-about route following the assumption by Grézy that the Viet Minh had laid ambushes along <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>direct</b> path. The French hacked a new path through the jungle until they reached Laotian tribesmen on April 11, who warned them of Viet Minh units following them. The French attempted to turn for Phong-Saly {{to the north and}} met an allied convoy travelling down the Nam Hou in canoes. The two forces combined and sailed down the river towards Muong Khoua.|$|E

5|$|MDSHA has {{conducted}} {{a study on the}} east–west corridor between the MD 28–MD 97 intersection at Norbeck and the I-95–MD 198 interchange, a corridor that forms <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>direct</b> route from Laurel to Rockville. Plans for the MD 198 portion of the corridor call for expanding the route to a four-lane divided highway from MD 650 to US 29 and widening the highway to six lanes from the Montgomery–Prince George's County line to west of I-95. The proposals also include adding a center turn lane to MD 198 between Old Columbia Pike and the Columbia Pike intersection and constructing roundabouts at Good Hope Road, Thompson Road, and Peach Orchard Road in Spencerville. MDSHA has also {{conducted a study}} concerning MD 198 between the Baltimore–Washington Parkway and Fort Meade. Proposed improvements are associated with the Base Realignment and Closure process that has greatly increased activity at Fort Meade. The preferred alternative {{that came out of the}} study was to expand MD 198 from the Baltimore–Washington Parkway to MD 32 to a four-lane divided highway and to construct a flyover ramp from westbound MD 32 to westbound MD 198 to supplement the existing dumbbell interchange.|$|E
5|$|The American {{plan was}} that Putnam would direct the {{defenses}} from Brooklyn Heights, while Sullivan and Stirling and their {{troops would be}} stationed on the Guan Heights. The Guan (hills) were up to 150 feet high and blocked <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>direct</b> route to Brooklyn Heights. Washington believed that, by stationing men on the heights, heavy casualties could be inflicted on the British before the troops fell {{back to the main}} defenses at Brooklyn Heights. There were three main passes through the heights; the Gowanus Road farthest to the west, the Flatbush Road slightly farther to the east, {{in the center of the}} American line where it was expected that the British would attack, and the Bedford Road farthest to the east. Stirling was responsible for defending the Gowanus Road with 500 men, and Sullivan was to defend the Flatbush and Bedford roads where there were 1,000 and 800 men respectively. Six-thousand troops were to remain behind at Brooklyn Heights. There was one lesser-known pass through the heights farther to the east called the Jamaica Pass, which was defended by just five militia officers on horses.|$|E
5|$|The path {{originated}} as a {{route for}} the Coastguard to walk from lighthouse to lighthouse patrolling for smugglers. They {{needed to be}} able to look down into every bay and cove: as a result, the path closely hugs the coast providing excellent views but rarely <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>direct</b> path between two points. The South West Coast Path is no longer used by the Coastguard but it has been transformed from a practical defence system into a resource for recreational walkers. The path is covered by England's right-of-way laws, as amended by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000, which keep historic footpaths open to the public even when they pass through private property. Sections of the path are maintained by the National Trust, which owns parts of the coast.|$|E

5|$|To {{prevent a}} Confederate force from {{advancing}} on Washington along the Potomac, several forts were constructed on hills near the river. To guard River Road, which was <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>direct</b> route into the city, U.S. Army engineers built a small, round fort {{at the point}} where River Road crossed into the district of Columbia. With a perimeter of only 123 yards and mounting only six guns, it was located forward of Fort Reno, the largest fort protecting the Tenleytown area. Details of the actual construction process are scarce, though a letter from a member of the Ninth New York Heavy Artillery regiment to the Democratic Press newspaper indicates that the fort was at least partially built with labor from that regiment.|$|E
5|$|West of Mitchell Road, NY96 takes a more southerly {{alignment}} {{than the}} canal as {{it enters the}} densely populated village of Pittsford and meets the northern and eastern termini of NY64 and NY252, respectively, {{at the intersection of}} Jefferson Road and South Main Street. NY64 heads to the south along South Main Street and NY252 continues along Jefferson Road to the west while NY96 turns north, proceeding {{into the heart of the}} village along South Main Street. In the village center, NY96 intersects Monroe Avenue and State Street, which carry NY31 east–west through Pittsford. The route continues on, becoming North Main Street as it crosses the Erie Canal and passes under the CSX Transportation-owned West Shore Subdivision. Just north of the railroad overpass is a junction with the southern terminus of NY153, <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>direct</b> route between Pittsford and nearby East Rochester.|$|E
5|$|While the Potomac River forts {{were being}} built, {{planning}} and surveying was ordered for an enormous new ring of forts {{to protect the}} city. Unlike the fortifications under construction, the new forts would defend the city in all directions, not just <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>direct</b> route through Arlington. In mid-July, this work was interrupted by the First Battle of Bull Run. As the Army of Northeastern Virginia marched south to Manassas, the soldiers previously assigned to construction duties marched instead to battle. In {{the days that followed}} the Union defeat at Bull Run, panicked efforts were made to defend Washington from what was perceived as an imminent Confederate attack. The makeshift trenches and earthworks that resulted were largely confined to Arlington and the direct approaches to Washington.|$|E
