5|$|Beginning in April 1933, {{scores of}} {{measures}} defining {{the status of}} Jews and their rights were instituted at the regional and national level. Initiatives and legal mandates against the Jews reached their culmination {{with the establishment of}} the Nuremberg Laws of 1935, stripping them of their basic rights. The Nazis would take from the Jews their wealth, <b>their</b> <b>right</b> to intermarry with non-Jews and <b>their</b> <b>right</b> to occupy many fields of labour (such as practising law, medicine or working as educators). They eventually declared them undesirable to remain among German citizens and society, which over time dehumanised the Jews. Arguably, these actions desensitised Germans {{to the extent that it}} resulted in the Holocaust. Ethnic Germans who refused to ostracise Jews or who showed any signs of resistance to Nazi propaganda were placed under surveillance by the Gestapo, had their rights removed or were sent to concentration camps. Everyone and everything was monitored in Nazi Germany. Inaugurating and legitimising power for the Nazis was thus accomplished by their initial revolutionary activities, then through the improvisation and manipulation of the legal mechanisms available, through the use of police powers by the Nazi Party (which allowed them to include and exclude from society whomever they chose) and finally by the expansion of authority for all state and federal institutions.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{and interpret}} adolescents´ lived experiences of <b>their</b> <b>rights,</b> duties and responsibilities {{in relation to}} their health choices. Fourteen focus group interviews with 67 adolescents aged 15 and 16 were conducted and analysed using the phenomenological hermeneutical method. Adolescents´ lived experiences of <b>their</b> <b>rights</b> {{in relation to their}} health choices were described as things that were allowed. Duties and responsibilities were perceived as something that they were required to carry out for their own health or other people´s health. Although <b>their</b> experiences of <b>rights,</b> duties and responsibilities overlapped, they referred to different aspects of their health choices. Adolescents viewed <b>their</b> <b>rights,</b> duties and responsibilities in the wider context, with parents and society defining their opportunities to make independent choices. We found that ethical considerations influenced adolescents´ choices and, the opportunities to exercise <b>their</b> <b>rights,</b> duties and responsibilities varied. Further consideration and recognition of these issues are needed...|$|R
