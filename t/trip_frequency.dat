40|$|We {{develop a}} model for {{integrated}} analysis of household location and travel choices and investigate it from a theoretical point of view. Each household makes a joint choice of location (zone and house type) and a travel pattern that maximizes utility subject to budget and time constraints. Prices for housing are calculated so that demand equals supply in each submarket. The travel pattern consists {{of a set of}} expected <b>trip</b> <b>frequencies</b> to different destinations with different modes. The joint time and budget constraints ensure that time and cost sensitivities are consistent throughout the model. Choosing the entire travel pattern at once, as opposed to treating travel decisions as a series of isolated choices, allows the marginal utilities of trips to depend on which other trips are made. When choosing <b>trip</b> <b>frequencies</b> to destinations, households are assumed to prefer variation to an extent varying with the purpose of the trip. The travel pattern will tend to be more evenly distributed across trip ends the less similar destinations and individual preferences are. These heterogeneities of destinations and individual preferences, respectively, are expressed in terms of a set of parameters to be estimated. ...|$|R

30|$|This paper {{examines}} older driver’s automotive trip (abbreviation: trip) characteristics {{which include}} <b>trip</b> <b>frequency,</b> trip length, destination distribution, and non-home-based (NHB) trips. A two-month experiment of 108 participants {{was carried out}} to collect GPS tracking data in Aichi Prefecture, Japan. To identify the effect of living area, a comparative analysis between older drivers and others is conducted in densely inhabited district (DID, i.e., urban) and other areas (non-DID, i.e., suburban, rural, etc), separately. The present study {{found that there was}} no significant difference between the trip characteristics of older drivers and others who were living in DID. Thus, we suggest that the education of safety driving and the recommendation of public transportation should be given to DID-living older drivers. However, the results of non-DID reflected that older drivers’ <b>trip</b> <b>frequency,</b> trip length, destination, and NHB trips rate were shorter and lower than others’. This implies that electric vehicles may be suitable for promotion among older drivers in suburban and rural area. Furthermore, the regression analysis confirmed that “older driver” was a significant independent variable on <b>trip</b> <b>frequency,</b> trip length, and NHB trips, and there were interaction effects between “older driver” and “living areas” on all trip characteristics.|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} between {{land use and}} travel patterns has been studied {{in a number of}} cases, using several methods - aggregate and disaggregate approaches - and different focuses – <b>trip</b> <b>frequency,</b> automobile use, vehicle miles travelled and so on. Definitely, travel is generated by the need to undertake activities and obtain services, and there is a general consensus that urban components affect travel behaviour. However researches are still needed to better understand which components of the travel behaviour are affected most and by which of the urban components. This paper studies the effect on <b>trip</b> <b>frequency,</b> public transport and private vehicle dependency of socio-economic, transport and land use characteristics. In particular the land use is defined in terms of type of neighbourhoods and types of dwellers. Methodological attributes are also included to test the effect of the type of survey, namely trip-based versus activity-based survey. Using a data-base from a survey conducted in 2006 and 2007 in Madrid, ordered probit models are estimated to analyse the effect of neighbourhood type and socio-economic characteristics on <b>trip</b> <b>frequency,</b> public transport and private vehicle use. Our results show that the characteristics of the neighbourhoods are important to explain the <b>trip</b> <b>frequency</b> but the effect is quite different depending on the mode used for the trips. Our results confirm that living in low density increases the propensity to use the private vehicles, while {{it does not seem to}} have an impact on the propensity to make internal trips, i. e. with origin and destination in the same area. We also found that there is a positive correlation between the number of trips and the number of stops but only if the trips are made with the private vehicles while are not significant for the public transport...|$|E

40|$|We {{develop a}} {{quantitative}} {{analysis of the}} biases that arise when measuring <b>trip</b> <b>frequencies</b> for a general population through an online survey instrument. Data from a national official survey in Italy, concerning both mobility behaviors and skills in using computers and internet, have been deployed to assess differences in mobility levels between those that can answer a computer/internet survey and those that cannot. Positive correlations were found between ability in using ICT tools and <b>trip</b> <b>frequencies.</b> These latter are about 15 % to 150 % higher for the "ICT literate", according to the travel means under consideration. A Heckman sample selection model showed us that these biases have different explanations. People knowing how to use internet {{are different from the}} others in they car driving behavior due to a range of self-related factors. Conversely, public transport patterns of use are more similar between the two groups: the observed bias is mainly due to the fact of using internet in itself, which could for example lead to a more active lifestyle. Such distinction is of practical interest because it can help defining a method to correct these biases. According to our results, the overestimation of public transport frequency of use of an internet survey could be corrected by looking at the internet diffusion in the population. On the contrary, corrections for car driving frequencies are more complex and should be based on differences in attitudinal and personal characteristics between internet survey respondents and the remainder of the populatio...|$|R

Fleet requirements were calculated as a function of overall level of service and a sample fleet assignment and schedule proposed. The proposal - to handle the mean demand forecast - consists of three 25 passenger helicopters, 150 flight segments, 2100 route miles/day and a utilization approaching 8. 5 hours/aircraft/day.

30|$|Through {{a two-month}} {{experiment}} of 108 participants in Aichi Prefecture, Japan, {{the present study}} primarily focused on older driver’s automotive trip characteristics which included <b>trip</b> <b>frequency,</b> trip length, destination distribution, and NHB trips. To confirm whether living areas (DID and non-DID) were relevant for older drivers’ trip characteristics, participants {{of this study were}} divided not only into age groups but also into living area groups.|$|E
30|$|<b>Trip</b> <b>frequency,</b> length, and NHB trip, {{except for}} the {{destination}} distribution, are influenced significantly by older driver (X 6) even considering the interaction effect. As analyzed in the previous section, the interaction between older driver and living area is a significant influence factor on each travel behavior. Moreover, about the <b>trip</b> <b>frequency,</b> older driver also has a positive interaction effect (X 14) with the impact factor of weekday/weekend, which implies that older adults driving on weekday can increase the <b>trip</b> <b>frequency.</b> It accords with some reports [34, 35] and {{may be caused by}} their expectation of avoiding the traffic congestion during the weekends. As mentioned in Sect. 3, correlation between interaction variables is measured by Pearson correlation test. The correlation coefficients are − 0.4922 (X 6 and X 7), − 0.1751 (X 6 and X 8), 0.0566 (X 6 and X 9), − 0.0186 (X 6 and X 10), and − 0.0244 (X 6 and X 11), respectively. And all of them are nonsignificant at the 0.05 level. Thus, we can conclude that the interaction effects are not caused by the correlation between independent variables. The regression analysis also demonstrates that living area (X 8) {{plays an important role in}} the trip characteristics, which confirms that it is necessary to divide the participants of this research into DID-living and non-DID-living groups. Furthermore, the elasticity information is also computed and indicated by superscript “IE (inelastic)” or “E (elastic).” It shows that the responsiveness of each dependent variable to “Age (60 or older)” has high elasticity, which means that the change of the former is strongly influenced by the latter.|$|E
30|$|The {{interaction}} between land-use and the transport {{system has been}} heavily dealt with by the research community recently and, in this section, the literature review represents the synthesis of some interesting analysis about this interaction focusing on the relationships between land use characteristics (such as urban densities, neighborhood design schemes and mixed land-use) and transit ridership. This is a very controversial topic because different thesis are already present: some studies establish that such variables {{seem to have an}} impact on auto ownership and use, but other studies quantify the impact as, at best, marginal. Literature review about transportation and land-use interaction can be found in Badoe and Miller [2] and also in Ewing and Cervero [12]. The reviews are conducted to understand if travel variables as <b>trip</b> <b>frequencies,</b> <b>trip</b> lengths and mode choices are correlated with the built-in environment in the studies analyzed.

40|$|In {{addition}} to its empirical results, this paper makes three distinct contributions to the literature on valuing fishing recreation by stated preference methods. In particular, the paper proposes {{a new approach to}} designing a choice experiment, called 'approximate minimax design'. It employs the latest advances in optimal design theory and is much easier to compute than the ordinary minimax design. Second, the choice-experiments are embedded in a <b>trip</b> <b>frequency</b> model, such that the changes in <b>trip</b> <b>frequency</b> can be predicted from improved fish management. Most importantly, the approach proposed in the paper provides a first step in developing dynamic fish management models, because the policies analysed may change the age-structure of the stock. The paper also contributes with new results on anglers' valuations of angling site characteristics. They conform to traditionally obtained results but also show some unexpected results. In particular, the result does not indicate a difference in the valuation of the species caught. As expected, the application shows that the marginal value of trophy-fish is high. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} potential of land use as a mobility tool to affect travel, a subject of long and ongoing policy debate. Land use strategies such as densification, mixed-use development, and non-driving-oriented design have been recommended by many to reduce vehicle travel. Others argue that land use is an ineffective mobility tool; direct and effectual policies are economic measures such as pricing. This dissertation suggests that either is necessary but not sufficient. To achieve the environmental and social objectives of transportation, the two should act together as complements. The mobility role of land use is to modify transportation supply and to support expansion of travel choices, whereas pricing is to manage and redirect vehicle travel demand. This dissertation presents two case studies: Metropolitan Boston and Hong Kong. Taking a disaggregate approach, the empirical analysis builds on the economic choice theory and focuses on three aspects of travel behavior: mode choice, <b>trip</b> <b>frequency</b> and automobile dependence.

40|$|This {{project was}} {{motivated}} by the fundamental match between hotel space conditioning load response capability and power system contingency response needs. As power system costs rise and capacity is strained demand response can provide a significant system reliability benefit at a potentially attractive cost. At ORNL s suggestion, Digital Solutions Inc. adapted its hotel air conditioning control technology to supply power system spinning reserve. This energy saving technology is primarily designed to provide the hotel operator {{with the ability to}} control individual room temperature set-points based upon occupancy (25 % to 50 % energy savings based on an earlier study [Kirby and Ally, 2002]). DSI added instantaneous local load shedding capability in response to power system frequency and centrally dispatched load shedding capability in response to power system operator command. The 162 room Music Road Hotel in Pigeon Forge Tennessee agreed to host the spinning reserve test. The Tennessee Valley Authority supplied real-time metering equipment {{in the form of an}} internet connected Dranetz-BMI power quality meter and monitoring expertise to record total hotel load during both normal operations and test results. The Sevier County Electric System installed the metering. Preliminary testing showed that hotel load can be curtailed by 22 % to 37 % depending on the outdoor temperature and the time of day. These results are prior to implementing control over the common area air conditioning loads. Testing was also not at times of highest system or hotel loading. Full response occurred in 12 to 60 seconds from when the system operator s command to shed load was issued. The load drop was very rapid, essentially as fast as the 2 second metering could detect, with all units responding essentially simultaneously. Load restoration was ramped back in over several minutes. The restoration ramp can be adjusted to the power system needs. Frequency response testing was not completed. Initial testing showed that the units respond very quickly. Problems with local power quality generated false low frequency signals which required testing to be stopped. This should not be a problem in actual operation since the <b>frequency</b> <b>trip</b> points will be staggered to generate a droop curve which mimics generator governor response. The actual <b>trip</b> <b>frequencies</b> will also be low enough to avoid power quality problems. The actual <b>trip</b> <b>frequencies</b> are too low to generate test events with sufficient regularity to complete testing in a reasonable amount of time. Frequency response testing will resume once the local power quality problem is fully understood and reasonable test frequency settings can be determined. Overall the preliminary testing was extremely successful. The hotel response capability matches the power system reliability need, being faster than generation response and inherently available when the power system is under the most stress (times of high system and hotel load). Periodic testing is scheduled throughout the winter and spring to characterize hotel response capability under a full range of conditions. More extensive testing will resume when summer outdoor temperatures are again high enough to fully test hotel response...|$|R

40|$|Supported by {{revenues}} from the US Department of Transportation. Free-floating carsharing systems are among the newest types of carsharing programs. They allow one-way rentals and have no set “homes ” or docks for the carsharing vehicles; instead, users are permitted to drive the vehicles anywhere within the operating zone and leave the vehicle in a legal parking space. Compared to traditional carsharing operations, free-floating carsharing allows much greater spontaneity and flexibility for the user. However, it leads to additional operational challenges for the program. This report provides methodologies {{for some of these}} challenges facing both free-floating and traditional carsharing programs. First, it analyzes cities with carsharing to determine what characteristics increase the likelihood of the city supporting a successful carsharing program; high overall population, small household sizes, high transit use, and high levels of government employment all make the city a likely carsharing contender. Second, in terms of membership prediction, several modeling alternatives exist.

40|$|Leisure {{activities}} have received increasing attention from travel behavior researchers {{over the past}} decade. However, these activities are often treated as a single category, neglecting their differences. Whereas most leisure activities are flexible, club activities are usually scheduled longer in advance and are more fixed in time, location and company. Hence, trip-generating properties of club activities are likely to {{differ from those of}} other leisure activities. As very little is known about involvement in clubs or voluntary associations in relation to trip generation, voluntary association activities deserve further research in relation to travel. Therefore, in this paper a path analysis is conducted, analyzing the relationships between participation in clubs or voluntary associations, <b>trip</b> <b>frequencies,</b> and social network characteristics. The analyses are based on data collected in 2011 in Eindhoven in the Netherlands in a survey among 516 respondents. The results show interesting relationships between the social context and involvement in clubs. They indicate that people become club members through their social networks, and frequent club activities increase social network size. Family oriented people were found to go less often to clubs.

40|$|Demographic ageing {{is a key}} {{societal}} {{challenge in}} Europe {{as well as in}} many other western and non-western societies. A crucial dimension concerns elderly daily mobility patterns. While still partaking fewer and shorter trips than younger generations, today’s elderly have been found increasingly (auto) mobile. Although the elderly benefit from the independence, freedom of movement, and social inclusion, concerns may rise regarding the environmental and accessibility impacts of this induced mobility. The present study adds to the expanding literature on elderly mobility, an integrated analysis of the effects of socio-demographic, health, trip, spatial and weather attributes on elderly mobility. Utilizing travel diary data for Greater Rotterdam, The Netherlands, <b>trip</b> <b>frequencies</b> and transport mode choices of the elderly are analysed by means of zero-inflated negative binomial models as well as multinomial logit regression models, and contrasted to the non-elderly subpopulation to explore (dis) similarities.
