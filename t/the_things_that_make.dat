Sava opined that, [...] "the final minute of “Billy’s Bucket List” drops a major plot-bomb that gives the series an exciting direction for next season, and while the events leading up to the cliffhanger aren't quite as provocative or substantial as the last few episodes, they represent all <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>make</b> this show such a great 10-minute oasis {{at the beginning of the}} week." [...] Sava also noted that, [...] "Trippy psychedelia is another major ingredient of this series, and 'Billy’s Bucket List' delivers a heavy serving when Finn finds himself underwater." ...|$|E

500|$|Homer {{is invited}} to speak his mind on a popular cable news show called Head Butt, on which host Nash Castor and {{commentator}} Adriatica Vel Johnson argue that he will soon be forgotten. However, Homer makes a convincing rant in which he tells the viewers that unlike television [...] such as Nash and Adriatica, he speaks for the common man. When the show is over, the cable network executives give Homer his own television show called Gut Check with Homer Simpson, where he provides a mix of populist and conservative ideas. During one episode, he pours [...] "gravy of freedom" [...] over a steak shaped like America, using the gravy {{as a metaphor for}} <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>make</b> the country great. He then encourages his viewers to [...] "get on the boat" [...] to protest about the bad things in society, and proceeds to place a gravy boat on his head. This wins Homer a huge base of support among average Americans, and soon the [...] "gravy boat movement" [...] becomes popular throughout the country.|$|E
500|$|Several {{publications}} for anime and manga have {{commented on}} the use of jutsu in the series. IGN called jutsu [...] "one of the most entertaining parts of the Naruto franchise", and noted that [...] "the complicated but impressive-looking hand gestures, the unique physical attributes, and the pure unadulterated destructive power of the ninjutsu are some of <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>make</b> the series wildly popular". T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews claimed that it was in [...] "fight/action scenes that Naruto receives is highest accolades", and praised the [...] "invigorating and unique fighting styles/techniques [...] manage to continuously infuse action sets with life". However, it criticized the [...] "overemployment of certain special techniques" [...] such as Naruto Uzumaki's Shadow Clone Technique, noting that the fights became [...] "bland and repetitive" [...] over time. Anime News Network (ANN) considered the structure of battles [...] "repetitive to a fault – a series of competing power-ups followed by an elegiac coda", but mollified by the series' [...] "winning formula: the villains are vile, the heroes sympathetic, and the stakes high".|$|E
500|$|Debbie Chang of BuddyTV.com {{expressed}} {{disappointment in}} the shows' development throughout the season, by stating it was [...] "all about couples, jumping {{in and out}} of relationships, trying their darnedest to have hot sex on the cramped, twin-sized bunk-beds in the on-call room". Chang also noted the little screen time of characters Mark Sloan and Richard Webber, and the lack of romantic development in their storylines. Many critics negatively reviewed Izzie Stevens's development in the show's fourth season, particularly her affair with George. Katherine Heigl herself deemed their relationship [...] "a ratings ploy". Heigl explained: [...] "They really hurt somebody, and they didn’t seem to be taking a lot of responsibility for it. I have a really hard time with that kind of thing. I’m maybe a little too black and white about it. I don’t really know Izzie very well right now. She’s changed a lot." [...] Laura Burrows of IGN stated the series became [...] "a little more than mediocre, but less than fantastic" [...] in its fourth season. She also said that [...] "this season proved that even strong chemistry and good acting cannot save a show that suffers from the inevitable recycled plot." [...] However, the episode [...] "Physical Attraction, Chemical Reaction" [...] received a positive review, with Burrows stating that it [...] "fully encompassed all <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>make</b> this show great: intense emotional drama and macabre OR activities". The Derek/Rose relationship received negative reviews, with Burrows stating that it was [...] "emotional, but not remarkable". Jack Florey of IndieLondon reviewed the characters, stating that their behaviour is the show's biggest problem: [...] "the self-absorbed, pretentious and frequently selfish attitudes that drive the surgeons at the centre of Grey’s exasperate more than reward." [...] As for the storylines, Foley stated that they didn't [...] "ring true" [...] and that [...] "the plot devices became increasingly clunky", noting the lack of realism in arcs such as George and Callie's marriage and the Izzie's affair [...] "as a means of ripping it apart". Florrey also commented on Meredith Grey's arc, by stating that she turned into [...] "one of the most selfish, self-centered characters on television", whereas Mark Sloan's storyline was named [...] "sex-obsessed, borderline misogynistic and close to scandalous". Daniel Fienberg of Zap2It said [...] "One of the season's best performances came from Emmy-nominated guest star Elizabeth Reaser." [...] Pajiba TV reviewed Reaser's performance by stating that it [...] "has been one of the only good things that show's had going for it anymore." [...] Entertainment Weekly called Reaser's performance as Ava the sixth most memorable patient performance on the show. About.com stated that Alex Karev developed into [...] "a bold and overly confident surgeon".|$|E

2500|$|I {{have devoted}} much space and {{discussion}} {{to the role}} of the Mongol 'phags-pa alphabet in the origin of the Korean alphabet, but it should be clear to any reader that in the total picture, that role was quite limited. [...] The origin of the Korean alphabet is, in fact, not a simple matter at all. Those who say it is [...] "based" [...] in 'phags-pa are partly right; those who say it is [...] "based" [...] on abstract drawings of articulatory organs are partly right. [...] Nothing would disturb me more, after this study is published, than to discover in a work on the history of writing a statement like the following: [...] "According to recent investigations, the Korean alphabet was derived from the Mongol 'phags-pa script" [...] phags-pa contributed none of <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>make</b> this script perhaps the most remarkable in the world.|$|E
2500|$|Shakespeare's sonnets are an {{important}} development in the historical progression of English poetry. The era in which Shakespeare was writing his sonnets was one of divergent literary values. He defied his society's contemporary tastes, along with [...] "Sidney and Spenser, the other two most prominent sonneteers" [...] of the sixteenth century, by embracing the sonnet form, which had largely gone out of fashion. Nonetheless, he filled his sonnets with references to other Elizabethan poets whom he respected. In Sonnet 54, especially the line [...] "The rose looks fair, but fairer we it deem,” we see a reference to Edmund Spenser's Amoretti, Sonnet 26, {{the first line of}} which is [...] "Sweet is the rose, but growes upon a brere." [...] This reference {{is just one of many}} which help to [...] "proclaim Shakespeare's deepest literary values and his recurrent aesthetic convictions." [...] While Shakespeare honors his contemporaries, one of <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>make</b> Shakespeare so great was how he differed from them. The Amoretti is a series of sonnets focused on a much more traditional topic, the courting which led to Spencer's marriage. In the Amoretti, Spenser proposes [...] "that a resolution to the sonneteer's conventional preoccupations with love may be found within the bounds of Christian marriage." [...] Shakespeare's Sonnets have a much more complicated, pained, and almost indecipherable message about love.|$|E

2500|$|The Salt Lake Tribune {{said that}} the album [...] "largely drops the punk-by-numbers that {{dominated}} past efforts {{to get a little}} more personal lyrically, thus becoming more approachable." [...] Alan Sculley of The Daily Herald explained that, [...] "Coming Home pretty much leaves any punk element behind. The songs still rock - just note the wallop delivered by [...] "Hold My Hand" [...] or [...] "Connected." [...] But the band pulls back on the tempos of virtually all of the songs." [...] Scene Point Blank writer Chris Abraham noted, [...] "Coming Home still encompasses <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>make</b> New Found Glory great. Relatable lyrics, hooks so melodic and catchy that my hands are red from not buying a mitt, and, despite a mellower tone, I could still imagine myself going fucking nuts singing along to these songs live." [...] AbsolutePunk founder Jason Tate warned that, [...] "it's crucial you abandon any pre-conceived expectations for this album. If you're anticipating the band's previous albums re-hashed, you're going to be completely let-down. While the choruses and sing-a-long hooks could compete with the best on any of their previous albums - it's the slower melodic approach to the songs that truly makes the album come alive and fully breathe." [...] Rae Alexandra of Kerrang! magazine called the album a [...] "massive departure" [...] and suggested that, [...] "NFG are taking what will be, by far, the biggest gamble of their career. Some of you won't even recognise them immediately; it's not fast, it's not forced, but - in an entirely new way - it soars." [...] In an earlier Kerrang! article discussing the album, Alexandra wrote that [...] "It's Not Your Fault" [...] displays [...] "more maturity - and piano - than ever before", while [...] "When I Die" [...] is [...] "low key with orchestral accents", making it [...] "one of the most beautiful moments on Coming Home." [...] Corey Apar of AllMusic was in agreement and stated that [...] "from the album's packaging to the comfortable nature of the music, it actually feels more mature {{in a way that is}} catchy without seeming to care about radio accessibility." ...|$|E
