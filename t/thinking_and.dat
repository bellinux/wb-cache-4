40|$|AbstractThis {{study was}} done to {{investigate}} the relationship between <b>thinking</b> styles <b>and</b> critical <b>thinking</b> skills among university students. Participants {{in this study were}} 207 students who were selected via multi-stage cluster sampling. Sternberg <b>and</b> wagners’ <b>thinking</b> styles inventory (1992) was used for assessing students’ <b>thinking</b> styles <b>and</b> their critical <b>thinking</b> skills were assessed by California critical thinking skills’ Test B form (Facione & Facione, 1992, 1998). The results indicated that there was a significance relationship between <b>thinking</b> styles <b>and</b> critical <b>thinking</b> skills <b>and</b> the level of significance was 0. 95. That means students’ thinking styles have the ability to predict their critical thinking skills. There was also a positive and meaningful correlation between executive <b>thinking</b> style <b>and</b> the total scores of critical thinking skills. However, there were no a significance relationship between Executive thinking style with evaluation and analysis components of criticalthinking skills. The correlations between judicial <b>thinking</b> style <b>and</b> all aspects of critical thinking were significant. The results also showed that there ware meaningful correlations between legislative thinking style with the total scores of critical thinking skills. However, there was no a significance relationship between legislative <b>thinking</b> style <b>and</b> evaluation component of critical thinking skills...|$|R

40|$|PhD, Education, North-West University, Vaal Triangle Campus, 2012 This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{in an attempt}} to determine the degree to which second year Mathematics education students consider critical <b>thinking</b> dispositions <b>and</b> attitudes to be important and to develop a curriculum-based mediational approach based on the data, to encourage the critical <b>thinking</b> dispositions <b>and</b> attitudes that appeared to be in need of encouragement. A literature study was undertaken to determine the positive critical <b>thinking</b> dispositions <b>and</b> attitudes students should possess. In addition it was also determined which teaching learning approaches will benefit the development of critical <b>thinking</b> dispositions <b>and</b> attitudes the most. The advantages as well as the processes and components that should form part of the mediational approach for the development of critical thinking dispositions were examined. A two-phase, sequential, explanatory mixed method study was subsequently undertaken with second-year Mathematics students at a South African university. The quantitative study made use of a self-developed questionnaire to determine the degree to which students consider critical <b>thinking</b> dispositions <b>and</b> attitudes important. Data emanating from the questionnaires were analysed and questions that had to be answered in narrative format were set for each student according to their own responses on the questionnaire. Narratives formed part of the qualitative component of the study in which students had to indicate factors that influence their critical <b>thinking</b> dispositions <b>and</b> attitudes, what could be done to improve the apparent unimportant critical <b>thinking</b> dispositions <b>and</b> attitudes and whether they regard the critical <b>thinking</b> dispositions <b>and</b> attitudes as important. Narratives were analysed and the results were used to explain the quantitative data. Results revealed that second year Mathematics education students do not consider critical <b>thinking</b> dispositions <b>and</b> attitudes, in particular inquisitiveness but also judiciousness, open-mindedness, systematicity, truth-seeking, analyticity and confidence in critical thinking to be very important and therefore these critical <b>thinking</b> dispositions <b>and</b> attitudes appeared to require encouragement. A curriculum-based mediational approach based on a section in the existing Mathematics module for second year education students was developed in order to encourage critical thinking dispositions in Mathematics. The study concluded with recommendations to encourage critical <b>thinking</b> dispositions <b>and</b> attitudes as well as proposals for future studies. Doctora...|$|R

The objective of this research is to identify the ability of <b>thinking</b> skills <b>and</b> problem solving skills in Malay Language among primary school pupils in Peninsula Malaysia. This study employed a survey method whereby pupils are given a test to measure their <b>thinking</b> skills <b>and</b> problem solving skills. This test is developed by the researcher and based on de Bono's CoRT thinking tools. Pupils were asked to utilize their creativity to the maximum level while responding to questions related to <b>thinking</b> skills <b>and</b> problem solving skills. Pupils thinking skills are measured based on originality,appropriateness, and fluency. Their problem solving skills are measured based on appropriateness and novelty. The findings indicate that the <b>thinking</b> skills <b>and</b> problem solving skills of rural pupils are significantly higher than the urban pupils. Besides that, the <b>thinking</b> skills <b>and</b> problem solving skills of female pupils are significantly higher compared to their male counter parts. This study concludes that de Bono's thinking tools can be used as an alternative to enhance pupils' <b>thinking</b> skills <b>and</b> problem solving skills...|$|R

5|$|From {{the end of}} the {{eleventh}} century universities had been founded across Europe, developing as semi-autonomous centres of learning, often teaching theology, mathematics, law and medicine. By the fifteenth century, beginning in northern Italy, universities had become strongly influenced by Humanist thinking. This put an emphasis on classical authors, questioned some of the accepted certainties of established <b>thinking</b> <b>and</b> manifested itself in the teaching of new subjects, particularly through the medium of the Greek language. In the fifteenth century university colleges had been founded at St John's College, St Andrews (1418) and St Salvator's College was added in 1450. Glasgow was founded in 1451 and King's College, Aberdeen in 1495. St Leonard's College was added at St. Andrews in 1511. Initially, they were designed for the training of clerics, but they would increasingly be used by laymen who began to challenge the clerical monopoly of administrative posts in government and law.|$|E

The objective of the study is to explore parents’ and teachers’ views of pupils’ <b>thinking</b> skills <b>and</b> problem solving skills according to locations of the school (urban and rural). This study also explores parents’ and teachers’ suggestions to enhance pupils’ <b>thinking</b> skills <b>and</b> problem solving skills. The sample consists of 302 parents of the pupils and 104 teachers who are teaching Year 4, Year 5 and Year 6. The quantitative data for the research was collected using questionnaires which were developed by the researchers. Each set of questionnaire consists of 23 items. While the qualitative data was collected through the focus group interview method among parents and teachers to get their suggestions on how to enhance pupils’ <b>thinking</b> skills <b>and</b> problem solving skills. The findings show that the urban parents’ views of children’s <b>thinking</b> skills <b>and</b> problem solving skills is significantly higher than those from the rural. The results also indicate that there is no significant difference between the urban school teachers’ and the rural school teachers’ views of pupils’ <b>thinking</b> skills <b>and</b> problem solving skills. Findings from the focus group interviews show that most parents engage their children in hands on activities at home to enhance their <b>thinking</b> skills <b>and</b> problem solving skills.
