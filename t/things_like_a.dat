5|$|The Simpson {{family are}} busy {{preparing}} for Bart's birthday party. Homer sees a commercial on television for a prank microphone called the Superstar Celebrity Microphone {{that can be}} used to tap into localized AM radio systems and instantly decides to buy one for Bart. Subsequently, Bart experiences a crushingly disappointing birthday party when all his gifts turn out to be useless <b>things</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> cactus, a label maker, and a new suit. At first, he is also disappointed by the microphone, but later finds a use for it in creating practical jokes, such as tricking Ned's boys Rod and Todd into believing that God is talking to them, listening in on Lisa and Janey's conversations about boys, and persuading Homer that Martians are invading the Earth.|$|E
25|$|For {{standing}} competitors, outrigger skis {{can be used}} in some classifications. These are {{ski poles}} with small skis on the end. They assist a skier balancing as they ski down the slopes, and in moving uphill for short distances, enabling skiers to do <b>things</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> climb a slope to get on a chair lift.|$|E
25|$|Conflicted romantic {{infidelity}} {{takes place}} {{when a person}} both {{falls in love with}} and has a strong sexual desire for multiple people at one time, even though s/he may already be committed to a partner. In this circumstance the person feels s/he cannot tell his/her committed partner about what has happened, but is nevertheless unable to resist the compulsion; this lack of open discussion is usually what separates conflicted romantic infidelity from <b>things</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> well-defined open relationship or polyamory.|$|E
5000|$|During filming, Leslie Nielsen used a whoopee cushion to {{keep the}} cast off-balance. Hays said that Nielsen [...] "played that <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> maestro".|$|R

500|$|Many of {{the test}} pilots at Edwards praised Armstrong's {{engineering}} ability. Milt Thompson said he was [...] "the most technically capable of the early X-15 pilots". Bill Dana said Armstrong [...] "had a mind that absorbed <b>things</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> sponge". Those who flew for the Air Force tended {{to have a different}} opinion, especially people like Yeager and Pete Knight, who did not have engineering degrees. Knight said that pilot-engineers flew {{in a way that was}} [...] "more mechanical than it is flying", and gave this as the reason why some pilot-engineers got into trouble: their flying skills did not come naturally.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} mixed by Bruce Swedien times—unusual for Swedien, who usually mixed a song just once. Jones had told Swedien {{to create a}} drum sound {{that no one had}} ever heard before. The audio {{engineer}} was also told to add a different element: [...] "sonic personality". [...] "What I ended up doing was building a drum platform and designing some special little <b>things,</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> bass drum cover and a flat piece of wood that goes between the snare and the hi-hat" [...] Swedien later wrote. [...] "The bottom line is that there aren't many pieces of music where you can hear the first three or four notes of the drums, and immediately tell what the piece of music is." [...] He concluded, [...] "But I think that is the case with 'Billie Jean'—and that I attribute to sonic personality." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{an early}} {{review by the}} trade {{magazine}} The Hollywood Reporter, Todd McCarthy said that, [...] "After nearly crashing and burning on his last solo flight in 2010, Iron Man returns refreshed and ready for action in this spirited third installment... benefits immeasurably from the irreverent quicksilver humor of co-writer and director Shane Black. Calling the film [...] "darker and more serious than its predecessors," [...] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times credited Black for [...] "chang this billion-dollar-plus franchise's tone for the better while keeping the same actor as Tony Stark. ... There is {{quite a bit of}} Black's trademark attitude and humor here as well, <b>things</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> throwaway reference to the sci-fi classic Westworld and a goofy character who has Tony Stark's likeness tattooed on his forearm. Black and company throw all kinds of stuff at the audience, and though it doesn't all work, a lot of it does and the attempt to be different and create unguessable twists is always appreciated." [...] Rafer Guzman of Newsday characterized Iron Man as [...] "the anti-Batman, all zip and zingers. He's also, suddenly, rather family-friendly. Some of the movie's best moments are shared by Stark and latchkey kid Harley (Ty Simpkins), who mock their budding father-son relationship while acting it out." [...] Psychology Today concluded that the film presented an accurate portrayal of Tony Stark's posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms.|$|E

500|$|... "The Raven" [...] {{was praised}} by fellow writers William Gilmore Simms and Margaret Fuller, {{though it was}} denounced by William Butler Yeats, who called it [...] "insincere and vulgar... its {{execution}} a rhythmical trick". Transcendentalist Ralph Waldo Emerson said, [...] "I see nothing in it." [...] A critic for the Southern Quarterly Review wrote in July 1848 that the poem was ruined by [...] "a wild and unbridled extravagance" [...] and that minor <b>things</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> tapping {{at the door and}} a fluttering curtain would only affect [...] "a child who had been frightened to the verge of idiocy by terrible ghost stories". An anonymous writer going by the pseudonym [...] "Outis" [...] suggested in the Evening Mirror that [...] "The Raven" [...] was plagiarized from a poem called [...] "The Bird of the Dream" [...] by an unnamed author. The writer showed 18 similarities between the poems and was made as a response to Poe's accusations of plagiarism against Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. It has been suggested Outis was really Cornelius Conway Felton, if not Poe himself. After Poe's death, his friend Thomas Holley Chivers said [...] "The Raven" [...] was plagiarized from one of his poems. In particular, he claimed to have been the inspiration for the meter of the poem as well as the refrain [...] "nevermore".|$|E
2500|$|When the {{standards}} were first implemented, some veteran teachers {{saw them as}} a loss, while some inexperienced teachers viewed them as a gain to the educational system. [...] Losses might include <b>things</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> sense of a loss of power, and gains {{might be seen as}} <b>things</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> great opportunity for collaboration between teachers.|$|E
2500|$|Pytheas also {{speaks of}} the waters around Thule and of those places where land {{properly}} speaking no longer exists, nor sea nor air, but a mixture of these <b>things,</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> [...] "marine lung", {{in which it is}} said that earth and water and all things are in suspension as if this something was a link between all these elements, on which one can neither walk nor sail.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Because it was {{the only}} <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> fault he could think of,' said Laura, excited by this shade of blame to defend him vehemently--'because his scruples are high and noble and generous.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think {{a man is}} horrible," [...] said Lettie, [...] "who can {{tear the}} head off a little mite of <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> rabbit, after running it in torture over a field." ...|$|R
6000|$|Warn. Inhuman Rose, adieu!--Blockhead Warner, {{into what}} a premunire hast thou brought thyself; this 'tis {{to be so}} forward to promise for another;--but to be godfather to a fool, to promise and vow he should do any <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> Christian-- ...|$|R
2500|$|I {{could have}} done lots more, put in much more work and {{developed}} more pictures, but I had also a desire to say what I felt about life. Simple <b>things</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> little picture in the window or {{the corner of the}} studio or an old stove in the kitchen have always been fascinating to me. They are very much alive, these flowers and grasses with the dew on them. Stieglitz always said, [...] "What have you got to say?" [...] I think in a few small cases I've said a few things, expressed how I felt, trying to show the horror of poverty or the beauty of black people. I think that in photography what you've done is what you've had to say. In everything this has been the message of my life. A simple supper, being with someone you love, seeing a deer come around to eat or drink at the barn - I like things like that. If I could make one true, quiet photograph, I would much prefer it to having a lot of answers.|$|E
2500|$|Roseland {{originally}} {{opened up}} under the name [...] "Lakeside Park" [...] {{with little more than}} a dance hall and a few rides. [...] The dance hall itself was named [...] "Roseland" [...] after the Roseland Ballroom in New York City. [...] After three years it had become such an integral component to the park's identity, that the park itself was renamed from Lakeside to Roseland. [...] Over the years as the park changed and grew, it saw many rides come and go. [...] Some of the additional attractions saw <b>things</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> Ferris wheel, bumper cars, a miniature train ride, [...] a sky ride that went out over part of Canandaigua Lake before returning to the station, and the park's Carousel, which was purchased for the park in 1941 from the defunct Long Branch amusement park. For a period of time there was even a live circus act. [...] Additional attractions have been added and changed over the years, including the addition of the park's major wooden roller coaster, the Skyliner, which was built in 1960.|$|E

60|$|On {{the other}} hand, I have already said, {{that if any}} <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> true picture of old English manners could be drawn, I would trust to the good-nature and good sense of my countrymen for {{insuring}} its favourable reception.|$|R
6000|$|... "That ain't {{altogether}} certain, lad. The lawyer thinks, and Jerry and I {{have the}} same idee, that if he owns up to the whole <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> little man, {{it may be possible}} to have sentence suspended during good behavior." ...|$|R
50|$|This Chapter of {{the book}} {{discusses}} <b>things</b> <b>like</b> how higher ground can give an advantage over your foes {{and how to use}} inclement weather to your advantage. There are several mentions of how uneven terrain can make all the difference in battle and how <b>a</b> simple <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> loose stone can turn the table on your enemy.|$|R

6000|$|... "No, it won't; not if {{you show}} them the way out. If it does, it's better to be unhappy striving for higher <b>things,</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> man, than to be content in a wallow like swine." ...|$|E
60|$|For {{some moments}} neither moved, neither the beast nor the man. They stood face to face, each perhaps {{with an equal}} astonishment, {{motionless}} and soundless, in that mad Indian moonlight that makes all <b>things</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> dream.|$|E
60|$|We {{skirted the}} lonely little lake called the Daubensee, and {{presently}} passed close by a glacier on the right--a <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> great river frozen solid in its flow and broken square off <b>like</b> <b>a</b> wall at its mouth. I {{had never been}} so near a glacier before.|$|R
60|$|Only {{those who}} have been {{forcibly}} held back when filled with the deepest anxiety to go forward, can form any <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> conception of our state of mind during the few days that succeeded that on which Peterkin met with his accident.|$|R
6000|$|... "There's a tin box," [...] whispered Mr. Glegg; [...] "he'd most <b>like</b> put <b>a</b> small <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> note in there. Lift it out, Tom; but I'll just lift {{up these}} deeds,--they're the deeds o' {{the house and}} mill, I suppose,--and see what there is under 'em." ...|$|R
6000|$|But here, as before, I {{think the}} {{distinction}} has arisen entirely from confusing a transitory imperfection with an essential character. So long as our information concerning them is imperfect, we class all objects together according to resemblances which we feel, but cannot define: we group them round types, in short. Thus, {{if you ask}} an ordinary person what kinds of animals there are, he will probably say, beasts, birds, reptiles, fishes, insects, &c. Ask him to define a beast from a reptile, and he cannot do it; but he says, <b>things</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> cow or a horse are beasts, and <b>things</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> frog or a lizard are reptiles. You see he does class by type, and not by definition. But how does this classification differ {{from that of the}} scientific Zoologist? How does the meaning of the scientific class-name of [...] "Mammalia" [...] differ from the unscientific of [...] "Beasts"? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Nellie dubiously. [...] "But {{you told}} me once--the first time we ever talked together," [...] she added, looking in his eyes--"something about your keeping your <b>things</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> {{squirrel}} in a tree. Could we not go there? Is there not room for us to sit and talk without being browbeaten and looked down upon by these supercilious trees?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wish I was a horse, then I {{could run}} for miles in this splendid air, and not lose my breath. It was capital, but {{see what a}} guy it's made me. Go, pick up my <b>things,</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> cherub, as you are," [...] said Jo, {{dropping}} down under a maple tree, which was carpeting the bank with crimson leaves.|$|E
6000|$|... "What's {{the use of}} quarreling about <b>a</b> little <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> tumble in the dirt?" [...] panted Fatty, who {{was almost}} out of breath because of his run towards the auto-stage. [...] "Come on! let's get to the Hall and see who is there." ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{was glad}} to be on the free land again. She went along the bank towards the sluice. The daisies were {{scattered}} broadcast on the pond, tiny radiant <b>things,</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> exaltation, points of exaltation here and there. Why did they move her so strongly and mystically? ...|$|R
60|$|He {{added that}} the brandy you get at foreign hotels was mere poison, {{and that it was}} really unsafe to travel abroad without a bottle of brandy. He said that <b>a</b> simple <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> bottle of brandy in your bag might often save your life.|$|R
