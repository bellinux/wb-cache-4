40|$|Summary. The forces {{generated}} {{during the}} function of the stomatognatic system act to the jaw bones in different directions depending on action of muscles which do definite action. The objective {{of this study is to}} determine distribution of the forces and their moments in some parts of a toothless mandible during simulation of one-sided ridge loading in the region of the lateral teeth. <b>The</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>researching</b> method is a combination of the clinical and the analytical (mechanically-mathematics) parts. The obtained resellers show that the forces are unevenly distributed along the jaw both on the left and right side, by which they are of the higher intensity on the side where the loading acts. The force FtB perpendicular to the mandible base, acting in the cranial direction, retains the constant value on the regions without loading, but in the loading zone it changes the action direction. The forces acting to fosse articulates are of unequal intensities and they are higher in the balances joint. There is an explicit asymmetry of moment MfN between the left and right side of the jaw, both in side and action direction. The jaw torsion moment retains approximately the same values on the working side, while on the balance side it changes the action direction, by which that change is performed in short region. Moment MfB is nearly symmetrically distributed in relation to the medial jaw plane. Key words: Forces, moments, lower ja...|$|R

50|$|In the {{treatment}} of a brain cavernous hemangioma, neurosurgery is usually <b>the</b> treatment <b>chosen.</b> <b>Research</b> needs to be conducted on the efficacy of treatment with stereotactic radiation therapy, especially on the long-term.

Clinical trials are being conducted to better assess when it is appropriate to treat a patient with this malformation and with what treatment method. Additionally, long term studies are being conducted because there is no information related to the long-term outlook of patients with cavernoma. A registry exists known as The International Cavernous Angioma Patient Registry collects information from patients diagnosed with cavernoma in order to facilitate discovery of non-invasive treatments.|$|R
