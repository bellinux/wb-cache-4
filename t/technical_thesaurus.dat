40|$|The {{practicum}} for the 2 nd year {{students of}} Faculty of Airspace Systems was designed {{according to the}} recommendations of the current curriculum that implies the students? professional language competence formation. The objective of the practicum is to widen students? <b>technical</b> <b>thesaurus,</b> to broaden students? knowledge of specialty, to improve reading, writing, listening and speaking skills. The practicum helps to develop a broad understanding of international socio-cultural issues in order to operate appropriately in professional and cultural environment. The practicum highlights the requirements to students? knowledge on different types of language activity. ????????? ??? ????????? ??????? ????? ?????????? ??????????? ? ??????????? ?????? ???????? ??????????? ????????? ?????????? ???????????? ?????, ??????? ???????????? ???????????? ? ????????? ??????????????? ???????????, ??????????? ??? ???????????? ??????? ? ???????? ????????. ???? ?????????? ????????? ? ????????? ? ????????? ?????? ????????????????? ???????, ????????? ??????????????? ?????????????, ??????? ????????? ???????? ??????????? ??????. ?????? ??????? ??????? ??????? ????????????????? ????????? ????????, ???????????? ??????, ??????? ? ????????????????? ?????? ? ??????, ?????????, ?????? ??????????? ? ???????? ??????????????? ???????...|$|E
40|$|With {{the growth}} of on-line information, the need for better {{resource}} location services is growing rapidly. A popular goal is to conduct search in terms of concepts, rather than words; however, this approach is frequently thwarted by the high up-front cost of building an adequate ontology (conceptual vocabulary) in the first place. In this paper we describe a knowledge-based Expert Locator application (for identifying human experts relevant to a particular problem or interest), which addresses this issue by using a large, pre-built, <b>technical</b> <b>thesaurus</b> as an initial ontology, combined with simple AI techniques of search, subsumption computation, and language processing. The application has been deployed and in use in our local organization since June, 1999, and a second, larger application was deployed in March 2000. We present the Expert Locator and the AI techniques it uses, and then we evaluate and discuss the application. The significance of this work is that it demo [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} decade Internet Service Providers (ISPs) have {{supplied}} affordable residential access to the internet. Traditionally searching techniques have mainly been self taught for the early twenty’s to thirty’s age group who {{had access to the}} internet but did not have the appropriate education. Now this group have careers or have gone into higher education and may be in the position where they need to search electronic systems or are teaching their searching skills to others. This paper establishes what problems this age group encountered when searching with little or no formal training of searching techniques. Volunteers were given search tasks on two search systems, the commercial search engine Google and the <b>technical</b> database <b>thesaurus</b> search system, INSPEC. It was found that many of the users performed efficiently when using Google but were uncomfortable with INSPEC and were quick to stop using the thesaurus feature when unsuccessful with initial queries. These results helped identify the need for formal training at both an early educational level and at a work level especially in today’s modern environment where a large proportion of research is conducted via the internet and the validity of data is paramount...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{the field}} of Natural Language Processing, {{in order to work}} out a {{thematic}} representation system of general knowledge, methods leaning on thesaurus are used since about fifteen years. A thesaurus consists of a set of concepts which define a generating system of a vector space modelling general knowledge. These concepts, often organized in an arborescent hierarchy, constitute a fundamental, but completely fixed tool. Even if the concepts evolve (we think for example of the <b>technical</b> fields), a <b>thesaurus</b> can evolve as for him only at the time of a particularly heavy process, because requiring the collaboration of human experts. After we detailed the characteristics which a generating system of the vector space of knowledge modelling must have, we define the "basic notions". Those, whose construction is based initially on the concepts of a thesaurus, constitute another generating system of this vector space. We approach the determination of the acceptions expressing the basic notions, which naturally leads us to ask the question of their number. Lastly, we clarify how, being freed from the concepts of the thesaurus, the basic notions evolve by an iterative process progressivel with the analysis of new texts...|$|R
