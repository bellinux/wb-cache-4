5|$|On 2 June 2009, it was {{announced}} that the new album title would be In This Light and on This Evening and that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> first band to play at the new O2 Academy Birmingham. Through producer Flood's heavy usage of synthesisers, the album provided a synthpop/post-punk sound to Editors' production. Flood, who is famous for collaborating with electronic music influenced bands like U2, Depeche Mode, The Killers and Erasure, helped develop synthetic elements on the album, which resulted in a mixed reception from long-term fans as to the group's new direction.|$|E
5|$|Upon his ascension, Playford {{headed a}} {{minority}} government; the LCL only held 15 of the 39 {{seats in the}} lower house. The balance of power was held by 13 mostly conservative independents. Many had gained from discontent over Butler's relatively liberal social stances, so Playford sought to assuage them by having his LCL colleagues refrain from upsetting social conservatives. He also used the threat of an early election to deter the independents from stalling his initiatives—with their lack of party infrastructure and funding, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> most vulnerable to election campaigns.|$|E
5|$|Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{has been}} deeply distraught since Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) was {{abducted}} by aliens. One morning, she arrives in her partner's office {{to find it}} being searched by FBI agents. Scully subsequently learns that the Bureau's newly promoted deputy director, Alvin Kersh (James Pickens, Jr.), has launched a manhunt in search for Mulder. The investigation is being led by an FBI special agent named John Doggett. Scully and Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) are taken to the task force's field office to be questioned, despite protests that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> most qualified to lead the manhunt themselves. As Skinner is being interrogated, Scully is accosted by an unnamed person who starts asking her about Mulder. When Scully finds out that he is actually Doggett (Robert Patrick), she angrily throws water {{in his face and}} leaves.|$|E

5|$|In 973, Dunstan's statesmanship {{reached its}} zenith when he officiated at the {{coronation}} of King Edgar. Edgar was crowned at Bath in an imperial ceremony planned {{not as the}} initiation, but as the culmination of his reign (a move that must have taken {{a great deal of}} preliminary diplomacy). This service, devised by Dunstan himself and celebrated with a poem in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle forms the basis of the present-day British coronation ceremony. There was a second symbolic coronation held later. This was an important step, as other kings of Britain came and gave their allegiance to Edgar at Chester. Six kings in Britain, including the kings of Scotland and of Strathclyde, pledged their faith that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> king's liege-men on sea and land.|$|E
5|$|When Britain began {{planning}} to build nuclear reactors to produce plutonium for weapons in 1946, {{it was decided}} to build a pair of air-cooled graphite reactors similar to the X-10 Graphite Reactor at Windscale. Natural uranium was used as enriched was not available, and similarly graphite was chosen as a neutron moderator because beryllia was toxic and hard to manufacture, while heavy water was unavailable. Use of water as a coolant was considered, but there were concerns {{about the possibility of a}} catastrophic nuclear meltdown in the densely populated British Isles if the cooling system failed. Helium was again the preferred choice as a coolant gas, but the main source of it was the United States, and under the 1946 McMahon Act, the United States would not supply it for nuclear weapons production, so, in the end, air cooling was chosen. Construction began in September 1947, and the two reactors became operational in October 1950 and June 1951. Both were decommissioned after the disastrous Windscale fire in October 1957. <b>They</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> last major air-cooled plutonium-producing reactors; the UK's follow-on Magnox and AGR designs used carbon dioxide instead.|$|E

25|$|As third cousins, Abigail and John {{had known}} each other since they were children. In 1762, John {{accompanied}} his friend Richard Cranch to the Smith household.

25|$|In 1921 {{the company}} was {{contracted}} to build two NBL-1 Barling Bombers for the Engineering Division of the United States Army. The NBL-1 was a large six-engined triplane bomber which was shipped by train and assembled at Wright Field. In 1923 the company modified 25 de Havilland DH.4s for the United States Post Office as mail carriers, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> last aircraft produced by the company which then concentrated on engineering research but in 1924 it was declared bankrupt.|$|E
25|$|Mintz, meanwhile, {{opened his}} own studio {{consisting}} primarily of former Disney employees, where {{he continued to}} produce Oswald cartoons, among them the first Oswald with sound, Hen Fruit (1929).

But Laemmle denied their requests and even terminated Mintz's contract, opting to have the Oswald cartoons produced right on the Universal lot instead.|$|E

25|$|The event {{relies heavily}} on {{corporate}} donations. In 2000, when Kroger pulled out after 10 years of sponsorship, the Kentucky Derby Festival was left scrambling for money.

25|$|Possibly 250-million year-old bacteria, Bacillus permians, were revived from stasis {{after being}} found in sodium {{chloride}} crystals in a cavern in New Mexico. Russell Vreeland, and colleagues from West Chester University in Pennsylvania, reported on October 18, 2000 {{that they had}} revived the halobacteria after bathing them with a nutrient solution. If they had survived for 250 million years, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> oldest living organisms ever recorded. However, their findings date the crystal surrounding the bacteria, and DNA analysis suggests the bacteria themselves {{are likely to be}} less ancient.|$|E
25|$|A {{reconnaissance}} aircraft {{flying into the}} typhoon near its peak intensity on September 12 determined Nancy's one-minute sustained winds to be 185knots (215mph; 345km/h). If these values are reliable, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> highest wind speeds ever measured in a tropical cyclone. However, it was later determined that measurements and estimations of wind speeds from the 1940s to 1960s were excessive. Thus, Nancy's winds may actually be lower than its official best-track value. In 2016, reanalysis of Hurricane Patricia noted that the storm had 215mph (345km/h) sustained winds, which ties Nancy and is the highest sustained winds in the Western Hemisphere.|$|E

25|$|In {{the brief}} {{interval}} between the drops of the 1st and 2d Battalions, General Ridgway arrived by L-19, landing {{on a road}} between Munsan-ni and the northern drop zone. En route, he had flown over Task Force Growdon then held up at Sinwon-ni, a fact he passed to General Bowen. Shortly after 10:00, Ridgway saw a single stick of paratroops jump from a plane over the lower drop zone. The replacement plane carrying the 1st Battalion commander and party had finally reached Munsan-ni, and its passengers had jumped in the correct zone not knowing that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> only troops in the area.|$|E
25|$|After {{the return}} of the Rink Hockey European Championship, still serving as the Rink Hockey World Championship, in 1947, Portugal saw {{the start of a new}} era in the history of rink hockey, where <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> {{dominant}} power. Portugal won 6 of the 10 editions of the most important world rink hockey competition in the annual first phase of the event, until 1956. The first win came in 1947, in Lisbon, over Belgium, followed by wins in 1948, 1949 and 1950. Simultaneously, Portugal saw the rising of some of the best and most legendary Portuguese rink hockey players ever: Correia dos Santos, António Jesus Correia, Emídio Pinto, António Raio, Sidónio Serpa, Olivério Serpa and goalkeeper Cipriano Santos.|$|E
25|$|By Lee's estimation, {{the fort}} {{could not be}} reduced by {{bombardment}} or direct assault, only by starvation. As long as supplies could be built up, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be.</b> <b>The</b> last Confederate supply ship to Fort Pulaski was the small workhorse steamboat Ida. On February 13, {{it was on a}} routine run to the fort down the North Channel. The new battery of Federal heavy guns on the north bank opened up for the first time. The old side-wheeler ran for Pulaski and the battery got off nine shots before the guns recoiled off their platforms. Union troops went back to work modifying platform construction and resetting the cannon. Two days later Ida ran up the South Channel under the extinguished lighthouse and returned to Savannah through Tybee Creek.|$|E
