50|$|Similar to a {{movie theater}} having good and bad seats, there is an optimal {{position}} {{when it comes to}} watching TV at home. This optimal position is directly along the central axis of the TV with the central point of the screen at eye level. Viewers seated in any other position come to experience degradations in picture quality ranging anywhere from minor to severe, the most notable being <b>trapezoidal</b> <b>distortion.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Manufacturers {{suggest that}} curved screens allow greater range in {{satisfactory}} viewing angles and offer minimal <b>trapezoidal</b> <b>distortion</b> compared to flat-screens. The claim that curved screens provide a wider field view is disputed, by another {{claim that a}} substantial offset from the center provides greater viewing distortion {{than that of a}} flat screen. However, the equidistant claim by manufacturers of the various parts of the screen from a centered view is supported. A 16:9 65 in curved screen TV versus a 65" [...] flat television viewed from 4.2 m from the centre of the TV offers 0.19 degree (~1%) greater viewing angle (based on Samsung's 4200R curved TV).|$|E
50|$|The {{simplest}} {{application of}} image geometry correction {{is a specific}} case known as keystone distortion correction derived from Keystone effect. Keystone distortion gets {{its name from the}} symmetric <b>trapezoidal</b> <b>distortion</b> resulting from misaligned projector placement in the vertical dimension (although the term is generally applied to the non-symmetric quadrilateral shape that occurs from an off-axis projection in both dimensions). Keystone correction capabilities are now included in most projectors currently available on the market, allowing users to move the image both vertically and horizontally. Even with this feature, the degree of adjustment available is limited, and image quality may suffer. Keystone correction is ideal for simple business (i.e. conference room) adjustments. For more complex distortion correction, an external processor is required.|$|E
