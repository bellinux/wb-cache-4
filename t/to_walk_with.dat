Its limb control system allowed it <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>with</b> the lower limbs, and to grip and transport objects with hands, using tactile sensors. Its vision system {{allowed it to}} measure distances and directions to objects using external receptors, artificial eyes and ears. And its conversation system allowed it to communicate with a person in Japanese, with an artificial mouth.|$|E
5|$|In September 1945, Minton {{suffered}} a heart attack while in Washington; he was hospitalized for three months at Walter Reed Hospital. After returning to work, he was forced to rest regularly due to gradually worsening anemia, and he sought to lessen his workload. To further complicate his health, on August 5, 1949, Minton tripped over a stone in his yard and broke his leg. The injury forced him <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>with</b> a cane for the remainder of his life.|$|E

5|$|Nicholas Edmund Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 12th Earl of Shaftesbury (born 3 June 1979), {{a former}} DJ and house music {{promoter}} in New York and Privilege in Ibiza, Spain. A short time following his brother's death, Nicholas relocated {{to the family}} seat at Wimborne St Giles, returned to business school {{for a couple of}} years, and assumed the responsibilities of the earldom. He has shown an interest in supporting charitable organisations, primarily those addressing the needs of children with disabilities. In December 2009, Nicholas suffered serious spinal injuries in a horse riding accident. He crushed his vertebrae in the fall. While he experienced initial paralysis necessitating the use of a wheelchair, physical therapy has helped restore his health {{to the point where he}} is able <b>to</b> <b>walk,</b> <b>with</b> limitations. With continued rehabilitation, doctors expect a full recovery.|$|E
5|$|Once {{candidates}} for treatment have been screened, treatment proceeds {{according to the}} lesion's location. For example, those with OCD of the knee are immobilized for {{four to six weeks}} or even up to six months in extension to remove shear stress from the involved area; however, they are permitted <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>with</b> weight bearing as tolerated. X-rays are usually taken three months after the start of non-operative therapy; if they reveal that the lesion has healed, a gradual return to activities is instituted. Those demonstrating healing by increased radiodensity in the subchondral region, or those whose lesions are unchanged, are candidates to repeat the above described three-month protocol until healing is noted.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} morning hours of 16 June, Hess rushed his guards and {{attempted}} suicide by jumping over the railing of the staircase at Mytchett Place. He fell onto the stone floor below, fracturing the femur of his left leg. The injury required that the leg be kept in traction for 12 weeks, with a further six weeks bed rest before he was permitted <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>with</b> crutches. Captain Munro Johnson of the Royal Army Medical Corps, who assessed Hess, noted that another suicide attempt was likely to occur in the near future. Hess began around this time to complain of amnesia. This symptom and some of his increasingly erratic behaviour may have in part been a ruse, because if he were declared mentally ill, he could be repatriated under the terms of the Geneva Conventions.|$|E

5|$|On May 23, 1839, Waller married Philadelphian Julia Ellmaker. He {{first met}} Ellmaker while visiting friends in Philadelphia {{during his time}} at the Princeton Theological Seminary. The couple had nine {{children}} between 1840 and 1858, six of whom survived to adulthood, and five of whom were alive {{at the time of}} his death. He lived at the corner of 5th and Market Streets in Bloomsburg, although at one point he owned much of the land between 4th Street, the Susquehanna River, Railroad Street, and Ferry Road in Bloomsburg. In 1871, he suffered a driving accident and was temporarily injured. He was in another accident in 1875 and due to this, he needed <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>with</b> crutches for the remainder of his life. Waller also suffered from rheumatism and neuralgia due to extensive traveling. He retired from being a minister on April 16, 1871. He died in on December 7, 1893, at the age of 79. The services for his death were held in his home. The historian J.H. Battle made note of Waller's hospitality. He was interested in geology and another Presbyterian minister gave him a large mineralogy-related collection in 1848.|$|E

25|$|In {{the spring}} of 1918, Goodrich was driving home after {{attending}} a military send-off when {{he was struck by}} a streetcar. The accident was very serious and he suffered bone fractures in his hip, skull, ribs, and collarbone. He was again near death, but survived. The accident left him greatly weakened and he was forced <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>with</b> a cane {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E

Douglas was described by his guests as being still in good shape, able <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>with</b> confidence into the Sunset Room for the celebration.|$|E
25|$|Charles de Gaulle married Yvonne Vendroux on 7 April 1921. They {{had three}} children: Philippe (born 1921), Élisabeth (1924–2013), who married General Alain de Boissieu, and Anne (1928–1948). Anne had Down's {{syndrome}} {{and died of}} pneumonia {{at the age of}} 20. De Gaulle always had a particular love for Anne; one Colombey resident recalled how he used <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>with</b> her hand-in-hand around the property, caressing her and talking quietly about the things she understood.|$|E

50|$|<b>Walking</b> <b>with</b> Beasts (<b>Walking</b> <b>with</b> Prehistoric Beasts in North American releases) is a 2001 six-part {{television}} documentary miniseries, {{produced by the}} BBC Natural History Unit. It is the second installment of the <b>Walking</b> <b>With...</b> series and a sequel <b>to</b> <b>Walking</b> <b>with</b> Dinosaurs. Beasts takes place after the extinction of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago depicted in <b>Walking</b> <b>with</b> Dinosaurs, and recreates animals of the Cenozoic with computer-generated imagery and animatronics. Like Dinosaurs, its narrative {{is presented in the}} style of a traditional nature documentary. Some of the concepts it illustrates are the evolution of whales, horses, and humans.|$|R

25|$|In {{the novel}} Moby-Dick, {{as well as}} various {{productions}} based on the novel, Captain Ahab {{is a man who}} loses one of his legs to the great sperm whale Moby Dick. After losing his leg, a replacement of sorts is fashioned. This `wooden leg´, actually carved out of whalebone, allowed him <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>with</b> minimal difficulty. The loss of this leg would fuel Ahab's obsession with Moby Dick, which cost him his ship, crew, and his life.|$|E
25|$|Many {{individuals}} with A-T develop deformities {{of the feet}} that compound the difficulty they have with walking due to impaired coordination. Early treatment may slow progression of this deformity. Bracing or surgical correction sometimes improves stability at the ankle sufficient to enable an individual <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>with</b> support, or bear weight during assisted standing transfers from one seat to another. Severe scoliosis is relatively uncommon, but probably does occur more often than in those without A-T. Spinal fusion is only rarely indicated.|$|E
25|$|Japanese {{robotics}} {{have been}} leading the field since the 1970s. Waseda University initiated the WABOT project in 1967, and in 1972 completed the WABOT-1, the first android, a full-scale humanoid intelligent robot. Its limb control system allowed it <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>with</b> the lower limbs, and to grip and transport objects with hands, using tactile sensors.

The adventure began September 24, 2012 in Queenston, in the Niagara region, and ended approximately one month later in Tobermory. Along the way the hikers had the opportunity <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>with</b> students, interact via live webcam and satellite phone transmissions, and educate students about the importance of proper nutrition, healthy living, and maintaining the Bruce Trail.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-20th century, Ichiro Kato {{professor}} of Waseda University studied humanoid robots. He initiated the WABOT project in 1967, and in 1972 completed the WABOT-1, the world's first full-scale humanoid intelligent robot. WABOT-1 had two arms, walked on two legs, and sees with two camera eyes. It was thus the first android. Its limb control system allowed it <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>with</b> the lower limbs, and to grip and transport objects with hands, using tactile sensors. Its vision system {{allowed it to}} measure distances and directions to objects using external receptors, artificial eyes and ears. And its conversation system allowed it to communicate with a person in Japanese, with an artificial mouth. Japan has since been leading the field of robotics.|$|E
25|$|Symptoms of {{cerebellar}} abiotrophy include ataxia {{or lack of}} balance, {{an awkward}} wide-legged stance, a head tremor (intention tremor) (in dogs, body tremors also occur), hyperreactivity, lack of menace reflex, stiff or high-stepping gait, coarse or jerky head bob when in motion (or in very young animals, when attempting to nurse), apparent lack of awareness of where the feet are (sometimes standing or trying <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>with</b> a foot knuckled over), poor depth perception, and a general inability to determine space and distance. The symptoms, when taken as a group, are distinctive and not easily mimicked by other illnesses, though certain types of neurological injury and infection need to be ruled out. Verifying the diagnosis in a laboratory setting is possible only by examining the brain post-mortem {{to determine if there}} has been a loss of Purkinje cells.|$|E
