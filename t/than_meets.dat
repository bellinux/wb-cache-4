500|$|Ford {{remained}} relatively {{active in the}} years after his presidency. He continued to make appearances at events of historical and ceremonial significance to the nation, such as presidential inaugurals and memorial services. In January 1977, he became the president of Eisenhower Fellowships in Philadelphia, then served as the chairman of its board of trustees from 1980 to 1986. Later in 1977, he reluctantly agreed to be interviewed by James M. Naughton, a New York Times journalist who was given the assignment to write the former President's advance obituary, an article that would be updated prior to its eventual publication. In 1979, Ford published his autobiography, A Time to Heal (Harper/Reader's Digest, 454 pages). A review in Foreign Affairs described it as, [...] "Serene, unruffled, unpretentious, like the author. This is the shortest and most honest of recent presidential memoirs, but there are no surprises, no deep probings of motives or events. No more here <b>than</b> <b>meets</b> the eye." ...|$|E
500|$|More recently, AllMusic critic Richie Unterberger {{has written}} of Yellow Submarine: [...] "The album {{would have been}} far better value if it had been {{released}} as a four-song EP... {{with the addition of a}} bonus track in [...] "Across the Universe"... No one would argue that there's a huge amount more <b>than</b> <b>meets</b> the eye (or ear) there, but listening to the original album anew 40 years on, one is still struck by how mostly second-rate, and recycled and rejected Beatles material still sounds so good." [...] Writing for Pitchfork Media, Mark Richardson opines that [...] "the Yellow Submarine soundtrack is like the work of a supremely talented band that couldn't really be bothered" [...] and describes [...] "Hey Bulldog" [...] as [...] "a tough and funky piano-driven rocker, [...] by a good margin the best song here". Richardson concludes: [...] "But as an album it's ultimately forgettable, which is something the Beatles so rarely were otherwise." ...|$|E

Later that summer at Comic-Con in July he reiterated that [...] "rumors of Charlie's demise are premature," [...] and at the August Television Critics Association press tour he commented about Charlie possibly showing up in the previously visited parallel universe. [...] "Momentum Deferred" [...] marked the actor's last appearance in the prime universe. In response to why the character was killed off, Entertainment Weeklys Michael Ausiello reported that the [...] "storyline dictated. Charlie wasn't going to have much to do this season, and rather than waste Kirk's time, they cut him loose".

500|$|In {{addition}} to licensed music, the game includes over 70 minutes of original score by Tim Schafer's long term collaborator Peter McConnell. McConnell composed pieces for orchestra and Metal band {{to tie in}} with the licensed music in the game. Also, the in-game soundtrack contains an instrumental drum track played by Slough Feg drummer Harry Cantwell, all other [...] "real" [...] drums (6 tracks) were played by Y drummer Mike Vanderhule and recorded by Jory Prum. The solos triggered by the player during the game were composed and recorded by Judas Priest guitarists Glenn Tipton (Eddie's solos) and K.K. Downing (Ophelia's and Doviculus' solos). While Schafer {{would like to have}} a soundtrack album for the game, he stated that there were already difficulties in securing the licenses for songs within the game and was not sure if it would be possible to extend them to a soundtrack. Schafer helped to select three songs—"We Are The Road Crew" [...] by Motörhead, [...] "The Metal" [...] by Tenacious D, and [...] "More <b>Than</b> <b>Meets</b> The Eye" [...] by Testament—to appear in a pack of Rock Band downloadable songs that was made available the same day as Brütal Legends release.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Inside Soap, Kirkwood said that Anthony and Tyler would bring a new element to EastEnders, [...] "There's been no shortage of brilliant and sexy women in EastEnders {{over the past few}} years and it was about time there were some blokes to join them. Tony and Matt are great actors, and the fact that they're easy on the eye is a great advantage". [...] "What the brothers bring is romance and fun, because that's something we've been a little short-changed on in EastEnders recently. The Moons are a very interesting family to work with– they're all big characters. It's a great new era for that clan". Kirkwood added that [...] "there is more to the pair <b>than</b> <b>meets</b> the eye" [...] saying that there [...] "are a couple of buried secrets between Eddie and his sons" [...] confirming it will be [...] "a big story for the summer". He finished, [...] "there'll be consequences for all concerned". Kirkwood later added, [...] "What I hope we've created in Tyler and Anthony are blokes you might see in the pub on a Friday night with an appetite for life– and for women." [...] When Anthony was introduced, it was revealed that he was a gambling addict. Of this, Lapinskas said, [...] "it's a great thing that our executive producer Bryan Kirkwood and the EastEnders team came up with for Anthony– that he does have this gambling problem and various insecurities connected with it. It adds some more depth to the character and it's brilliant when we can explore that. With every topic and every storyline that crops up, I think Anthony's background will always have an effect and impact on it. That's really nice to play." ...|$|E

2500|$|However, the {{reception}} was, on the whole, lukewarm compared to some earlier works. For The Independent, Lynne Walker wrote: [...] "Our most prolific and popular playwright {{seems to have}} forgotten that {{the twists and turns}} in a storyline do need to be plausible rather than just the vehicle for a sequence of ideas, no matter how cunning they are in themselves", while Sam Marlowe for The Times concluded: [...] "Drowning on Dry Land is like its hapless anti-hero: there's not much more to it <b>than</b> <b>meets</b> the eye".|$|E

In the same interview she also credits her journalistic career for helping her creative writing: [...] "you would sometimes take quite an ordinary and humble person and write a story about them, and you'd {{be surprised at the}} quality that there was in the ordinary human being ...
