50|$|The crinkle {{tendency}} {{is due to}} the technological conditions of the spun yarn productionand the physical fiber properties. Above all, the “technological conditions of thespun yarn production” means the turning moment of the thread. A twisted thread will alwaystry to twist when it hangs freely between two fixed points {{in the form of a}} loop. In doing this, it gives up a part of its original twist which becomes spirals whose twisting direction is opposite to the original twist direction. This development of twist in the opposite direction occurs as the <b>twisted</b> <b>yarn</b> attempts to reach equilibrium.|$|E

The technology was developed {{with the help of}} John Wyatt of Birmingham. Paul and Wyatt opened a mill in Birmingham which used their new rolling machine powered by a donkey. In 1743 a factory opened in Northampton with 50 spindles on each of five of Paul and Wyatt's machines. This operated until about 1764. A similar mill was built by Daniel Bourn in Leominster, but this burnt down. Both Lewis Paul and Daniel Bourn patented carding machines in 1748. Based on two sets of rollers that travelled at different speeds, it was later used in the first cotton spinning mill. Lewis's invention was later developed and improved by Richard Arkwright in his water frame and Samuel Crompton in his spinning mule.In 1764 in the village of Stanhill, Lancashire, James Hargreaves invented the spinning jenny, which he patented in 1770.

A new local orientation feature is proposed for fabric structure detection by using high-resolution images. The detection process consists of two main steps.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{geometrical}} modeling for studying mechanical characteristics for twisted textile composites consisting of helically twisted yarns. From a {{simple mathematical model}} for sub-unit cells, the elastic behavior of twisted and impregnated composites is predicted. To get the elastic constants, a volume averaging method for sub-unit cells is applied and compared to other models. In the analysis, the compliance matrix of a helically twisted yarn’s sub-unit cell {{is based on a}} system of anisotropic elastic materials. The constitutive properties are calculated by the compliance or the stiffness matrix with generalized transformations about the material axis. To implement the volume averaging method, the concept of equivalent volumes is introduced to geometrical volumes of helically twisted yarns within the sub-unit cell. This study also considers the effects of migration and micro-buckling of filaments on the twisted yarns ’ elastic properties. From comparisons between the present and other results, a good conformity is found. Nomenclature h = the pitch length of twisted yarns D = the diameter of <b>twisted</b> <b>yarn...</b>|$|E
