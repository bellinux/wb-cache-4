5000|$|The {{celestial}} sphere {{can thus be}} thought of as a kind of astronomical shorthand, and is applied very frequently by astronomers. For instance, the Astronomical Almanac for 2010 lists the apparent geocentric position of the Moon, 1 Jan 2010 at 0h Terrestrial Time, in equatorial coordinates, as right ascension 6h 57m 48s.86, declination +23° 30' 05".5.

For applications requiring precision (for instance, calculating the shadow path of an eclipse), the Almanac gives formulae and methods for calculating the <b>topocentric</b> <b>coordinates,</b> that is, as seen from a particular place on the Earth's surface, based on the geocentric position.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the concise exact solution for predicting view-periods {{to be observed}} from a masked or unmasked tracking station on a tri-axial ellipsoidal surface. The new exact approach expresses the azimuth and elevation angles of a spacecraft {{in terms of the}} station-centered geodetic <b>topocentric</b> <b>coordinates</b> in an elegantly concise manner. A simple and efficient algorithm is developed to avoid costly repetitive computations in searching for neighborhoods near the rise and set times of each satellite orbit for each station. Only one search for each orbit is necessary for each station. Sample results indicate that the use of an assumed spherical earth instead of an 'actual' tri-axial ellipsoidal earth could introduce an error up to a few minutes in a view-period prediction for circular orbits of low or medium altitude. For an elliptical orbit of high eccentricity and long period, the maximum error could be even larger. The analytic treatment and the efficient algorithm are designed for geocentric orbits, but they should be applicable to interplanetary trajectories by an appropriate coordinates transformation at each view-period calculation. This analysis can be accomplished only by not using the classical orbital elements...|$|E

Four IGS (International Global Service) stations were selected to perform precise point positioning (PPP) for the three different days. Three of these stations are in Turkey (ISTA, TUBI, ANKR) {{and the other one}} is in CYPRUS (NICO). The chosen days are within the solar maximum and the solar minimum periods which are the 294 th day of year 2001 (DOY 294, 2001, solar maximum), 82 th day of year 2014 (DOY 82, 2014, solar maximum) and the first day of year 2009 (DOY 1, 2009, solar minimum). Vertical Total Electron Content (TECV) was determined for the chosen IGS stations in these days. Approximately 5 TEC unit (TECU) changes for DOY 1, 2009 and 50 - 60 TECU changes for DOY 82, 2014 and DOY 294, 2001 were observed. 24 hours rinex observation files with 30 seconds sampling interval for each station and each day were processed with and without correcting the second-order ionosphere effect by GIPSY 6. 3. The second-order effect is obtained from {{the difference between the two}} processes. The differences of XYZ Cartesian coordinates were transformed to <b>topocentric</b> <b>coordinates</b> (north, east, up) in order to analyze the second-order effect on the positioning more conveniently. The results show that the north component is affected significantly larger than the east and up components from the second-order ionospheric effect for each processed day. Maximum values of the north component between the two processes were observed in ANKR station (1. 47 mm) for DOY 294, 2001. East and up components are in the order of sub-millimeter level for each station and each day. The results of the difference between the two processes show that the impact of the second-order correction on positioning has a southward tendency for each station.

40|$|A radar meteor {{facility}} in {{operation in the}} Southern Hemisphere has been constructed so as to provide routine measurements of the heliocentric orbits of Earth-intersecting meteoroids to a limiting size equivalent to {{the largest of the}} zodiacal dust particles (a few hundred mum). Such information pertaining to the orbital characteristics of the solar system small particle population is essential in providing a database for dynamical studies of this population, and of its origin and evolutionary processes. The features of this installation (Advanced Meteor Orbit Radar: AMOR) are compared with those of other techniques for orbit determination. The system uses a 26. 2 MHZ, 20 kW pulse radar transmitter. AMOR's limiting sensitivity is equivalent to a visual meteor magnitude Of + 13 corresponding to a particle radius of approximately 100 mum, or a mass of approximately 1 mug. In contrast to previous orbit radars the system employs a narrow (width 3. 2 -degrees to 3 dB) fan-shaped antenna beam to constrain the echo azimuth of detected meteor trains, a 5 lambda phase pair being used to determine their elevations. The velocity and radiant position are then obtained by measuring the time-lags between multiple receiver sites, these time differences being the result of the time-of-flight between points on the train at which specular reflections occur for each site. These multiple stations provide an 8 km baseline and are linked via FM telemetry. In addition, for a proportion of the meteors the echoes at {{one or more of the}} sites provide independent velocity determinations through the Fresnel diffraction profile as the train forms, permitting the determination of meteoroid atmospheric decelerations in 5 - 10 per cent of cases. This is an important feature since an accurate calculation of the pre-atmospheric speed can then be made for many meteoroids and the deceleration modelled for those not displaying the Fresnel oscillations. The tasks of on-site recording of multiplexed signal channels, the data organization, and signal processing routines to extract suitable echoes in the presence of noise, are facilitated by the use of high-level software language operation on PCs. Data processing provides multiple echo analysis and the extraction of velocity and deceleration information from diffraction patterns in order to yield the meteor motion in <b>topocentric</b> <b>coordinates,</b> and thereafter the heliocentric orbit. The radar measurement uncertainties are also investigated in terms of the accuracy of the deduced orbits. Additionally, well-known streams which yield meteors of high atmospheric velocity provide a stringent astronomical test of AMOR's overall performance. The data handling capacity of AMOR permits the recording, the orbit reduction and the efficient presentation of orbital data using graphical packages to be carried out on a routine basis. The daily Yield is approximately 1500 with > 2 X 10 (5) secured to date; this is greater than the number determined in all previous meteoroid orbit surveys combined. Most of these orbits have been from radiants at declinations + 5 -degrees < delta < - 30 -degrees, but the transmitting antenna is now being modified so as to permit deep southern radiants to be surveyed more effectively...|$|E
40|$|Abstract This work {{describes}} {{the development of}} high accuracy sun tracking control equipment, to be integrated in high concentration photovoltaic systems. In order to achieve the sub degree accuracies required by these photovoltaic concentrators, a new control approach is presented that primarily based in the computation of analytic sun ephemeris equations, adds in its software a calibration model, that characterizes the concentrator geometry {{through a set of}} parameters, in order to precisely convert the sun coordinates supplied by the ephemeris into tracking axes rotation angles. Fitting the calibration model parameters is done through an automatic process that runs during the in‐field installation of the concentration system, in which a set of precise sun position measurements with respect to the tracking axes are taken throughout a day from dawn to dusk. The full development cycle of this product is described going from the theory of its operation, to its validation and testing, its physical implementation as an electronic system, and finally to the steps given towards the volume production of the resultant technology. The work is divided in five chapters that follow an introduction in which an overview is given of the present context of Concentration PhotoVoltaics (CPV), to later focus in presenting the CPV tracker, and finally reviewing the history and state of the art of sun tracking control for high accuracy applications. The tracking control developed in this work is based in an autocalibration process, very common in instrumentation equipment and applied also to the relatively similar problem of the tracking of orbital targets, such as required in big astronomical telescopes. In fact, the novelty of this work resides in adapting these astronomy sun tracking techniques to some sort of “telescopes” that only “see” the electrical power output of a PV generator. These particular telescopes or sun trackers will usually be a two axis pointable structure, where in the approach presented in this work, sun tracking will be firstly based in obtaining the sun’s coordinates with respect to the tracker location through the computation of sun ephemeris equations encoded in a microprocessor. However converting these so called <b>topocentric</b> <b>coordinates</b> into the tracker axes rotations pointing it to the sun, will require another set of equations, i. e. the calibration model or transform as is termed in this work, that usually based in rotation transforms and spherical geometry (or alternatively obtained through quaternions) will parametrically model the orientation of the tracking axes and its rotation origins, and also the orientation with respect to these axes, of the supported CPV array pointing vector, i. e. the one that when perfectly parallel to the local sun vector produces maximum power output. Chapter 1 covers the development of this Calibration Transform (C‐Transform), its application and possible variations to consider the most common tracker axes configurations, and finally the consideration of flexure in the tracking structure and propose how it can be characterized and integrated in an extended calibration transform. Chapter 2 {{describes the}} algorithms used for the fitting of the calibration model once a set of accurate sun position measurements is collected by the tracker. Least squares (LS) fitting through the Levenberg Marquardt method is developed for the C‐Transform of Chapter 1. Firstly the correct operation of our encoding of the Levenberg Marquardt (LM) method is tested, as is usual for numerical optimization algorithms, with the Moré set of test functions. Then the numerical accuracy of the LM method when fitting the C‐Transform and having its code compiled to run in a low cost 8 bit microprocessor, is obtained when compared with that of the same code running in a conventional 32 bit desktop PC. Along with these main topics some other are considered in this chapter such as the analysis of the proper definition of the LS merit function when operating on the C‐Transform, checking the right definition of the C‐Transform that doesn't give rise to discontinuities that may slow its fitting, and also exploring the accuracy of an alternative implementation of the LM algorithm in which the derivatives in the Hessian and gradient are calculated through finite differences instead of using their closed analytic forms. Chapter 3 first gets to prove the physical grounds of the calibration model, by using a laboratory tracker that mounts several different samples of CPV modules, and where some of the parameters of the calibration model can be previously adjusted, tweaking the position of both the tracker and the test modules, so after collecting a set of sun positions and then fitting the C‐Transform best fit parameter values should be equal to those preset during the experiment. Once the calibration model is validated, next goal is the precise measurement of the tracking accuracy being achieved by the proposed hybrid calibrated tracking control. This will first require the development of a Tracking Accuracy Sensor (TAS) able to provide real time measurements of the sun tracking error. This sensor essentially consists of a collimating pipe mounted on top of an imaging electronic sensor, with the necessary signal conditioning electronics, developed along with the conversion equations necessary to compute a tracking error angle from its internal electric variables, and also with the calibration procedure to accurately obtain the internal construction parameters of the sensor that intervene in these conversion equations. This sensor will end up featuring the rather impressive resolution of 1 / 10. 000 th degree within its 1 ° acceptance angle. Finally a monitoring system is built around the TAS mounted in the referred laboratory tracker, and by calibrating the controller against this TAS, a best case estimate of the tracking accuracy statistics, can be obtained for several variations of the calibrated routine here developed. In these experiments average daily accuracies of 0. 05 ° are proven possible with accuracies better than 0. 1 °, 97 % of the time. All tests in Chapter 3 to prove the correct operation of the calibrated sun tracking control, had to previously collect a set of in between fifty and a hundred sun position measurements, throughout a day from dawn to dusk, in order to feed the fitting of the calibration model. This was to be manually done, by aiming the laboratory tracker with its CPV modules to the sun till, according to some criterion, best pointing accuracy was obtained, and then recording axes position along with a measurement time stamp. This was a boring and error prone task, that had to be fully automated in order to be feasibly integrated in a commercial tracking controller unit, so it would run with the least amount manual operation and maintenance. In Chapter 4 the necessary hardware and algorithms to implement the automatic collection of sun position measurements are explained. But prior to the full description of the automatic measurement acquisition process, a review of the existent sun ephemerides and their accuracy is presented, including the set finally chosen for the tracking controller described in this work. Regarding sun position measurements these can first start by a preliminary search of the sun within the concentrator’s tracking range, till this gets within the acceptance angle, a problem which as will be described can be attacked mathematically by resorting to the toolbox of Search Theory, a branch of Operations Research developed during WWII for antisubmarine warfare. In particular when helping the search with a coarse sun sensor such as a low power flat PV module, the optimum search path can be derived by making the assumptions of the so called “Flaming Datum Problem” firstly developed for the search of an evading submarine after it reveals its position after attacking a friendly ship. Once the sun is within acceptance angle, to precisely point to the sun we would ideally maximize the power output of the CPV array, but as will be discussed some practical problems appear when choosing power output as the variable to maximize, and this due to the difficulties of maximum power point (MPP) tracking stages in inverters to follow the tracker scanning movements. Therefore other alternative electrical variables under different biasing than MPP are here proposed. Short circuit current is finally the variable chosen for maximization, and the additional hardware developed to automatically short the CPV array and measure its current is described. Searching for the short circuit current maximum is a problem of maximization of a two dimensional function, that in the sun tracking application can be approached more straightforwardly by avoiding computation of derivatives and instead by determining the minimum number of linear maximizations, which will be translated into tracker sweeps, that lead to the overall maximum of the function. In this occasion the mathematical corpus behind corresponds to the Powell‐Brent derivative‐free conjugate direction set method. Following the description of the mechanism for automatically taking a certain position measurement, investigation of the right number of measurements to obtain the most accurate calibrated ephemeris and their distribution or scheduling is presented. The chapter ends with a discussion about the possibility to introduce a statistical filter to detect outliers during sun position measurement acquisition, understood as those faulty measurements affected by whatever errors, or alternatively considers the possibility to introduce maximum likelihood estimators (MLEs) other than the Least Squares, for the fitting of non linear models such as the CTransform. In this respect the so called Cauchy‐Lorentz MLE appears as the most feasible option. Chapter 5, the final one, describes how all the methods developed for the autocalibrated sun tracking control, explained up to this point, have been physically implemented in an electronic unit, commercially known as the SunDog STCU (standing for Sun Tracking Controller Unit). Firstly a detailed physical description from its electronic boards to its peripherals is presented, followed by an account of its features and operational modes, to end with an account of its reliability tests and certification. The chapter follows with a description of the process of the testing and operation of the tracking control unit through the most significant CPV R&D development projects and related prototypes. Here on the one hand several tracker development projects carried out by Inspira for several CPV developing companies, such as Isofoton, Concentrix, Solfocus, Boeing, or Renovalia are presented, focusing on the application and results of the auto calibrated tracking control in them. On the other hand this chapter presents a selection of European R&D projects in the field of CPV, in which Inspira participated being in charge of the development of the CPV tracker, and which have been useful to explore or further develop particular features of the SunDog controller operation. The chapter ends with a description of the first steps taken towards series production of the auto calibrated controller, and their first volume deployment in the ISFOC and Abertura PV plants. Putting an end to this work, the Conclusions section gathers the most relevant results obtained, and outlines some areas whose advancement can further improve the sun tracking controller developed. Resumen En este trabajo se describe el desarrollo de un equipo de control de seguimiento solar de alta precisión para sistemas de alta concentración fotovoltaica. Con objeto de lograr las precisiones de apuntamiento por debajo del grado requeridas por estos concentradores fotovoltaicos, se presenta una nueva aproximación al control de seguimiento que primeramente basado en el computo de efemérides solares analíticas, incorpora a continuación un modelo de calibración, que caracteriza geométricamente el concentrador por medio de un conjunto de parámetros, con objeto de realizar una conversión precisa de las coordenadas solares suministradas por las efemérides en ángulos de giro de los ejes del seguidor. El ajuste de los parámetros del modelo de calibración se realiza por medio de un proceso automatizado que tiene lugar durante la instalación en campo del sistema de concentración, en el que se realizan un conjunto de medidas precisas de la posición del sol en relación a los ejes del seguidor, tomadas a lo largo de un día desde el orto al ocaso. En este trabajo se describe el ciclo completo de desarrollo de este producto yendo desde las bases teóricas de su operación, su validación y pruebas, su realización física como un equipo electrónico, y finalmente los pasos dados de cara a la producción industrial de esta tecnología. Este trabajo se compone de cinco capítulos, que se suceden a continuación de una introducción en la que se explica el presente contexto de la Concentración Fotovoltaica (CFV o en inglés CPV de Concentration PhotoVoltaics), para después pasar a describir las características de los seguidores solares para concentración fotovoltaica, y finalmente ofrecer una revisión de la historia y el estado del arte de los sistemas de control de seguimiento solar en aplicaciones que requieren altas precisiones. El control de seguimiento desarrollado está basado en un proceso de autocalibración, generalmente común en el ámbito del equipamiento de instrumentación o por ejemplo aplicado también en el problema relativamente similar del seguimiento de objetos orbitales, que se da en los grandes telescopios astronómicos. De hecho la novedad de este trabajo reside en adaptar estas técnicas de seguimiento utilizadas en astronomía a un tipo de "telescopios" que solo "ven" la potencia eléctrica producida por un generador fotovoltaico. Estos telescopios o seguidores solares consistirán habitualmente en una estructura orientable en torno a dos ejes, de tal modo que según la aproximación que se presenta en este trabajo, el seguimiento solar estará primeramente basado en obtener las coordenadas del sol con respecto al lugar de instalación del seguidor, a través del cómputo de efemérides solares codificadas en un microprocesador. Posteriormente convertir estas coordenadas topocéntricas en los ángulos de giro a ejercer en los ejes de seguimiento para apuntar al sol, requerirá de otro conjunto de ecuaciones, i. e. según se denomina en este trabajo el llamado modelo de calibración, que basado en transformaciones de tipo rotación y geometría esférica (o alternativamente deducibles usando cuaternios) que parametriza la orientación de los ejes de seguimiento y sus orígenes de rotación, así como la orientación con respecto a estos ejes, del vector de apuntamiento del sistema de módulos de concentración soportados, esto es aquel vector ligado a la superficie orientable del seguidor que cuando queda orientado de manera perfectamente paralela al vector local del sol produce la máxima potencia de salida. El Capitulo 1 está dedicado al desarrollo de esta Transformada de Calibración (por abreviar Transformada C), sus aplicaciones y posibles variaciones orientadas a cubrir las más comunes configuraciones de ejes de seguimiento, y finalmente se detiene a considerar los efectos de la flexión en la estructura de seguimiento y proponer como pueden ser caracterizados e integrados en una transformada de calibración extendida. El Capitulo 2 se centra en los algoritmos utilizados para el ajuste del modelo de calibración una vez que el seguidor a tomado una serie de medidas precisas de la posición del sol. Se desarrolla el ajuste por mínimos cuadrados (MC o en inglés LS de Least Squares) de la Transformada‐C del Capítulo 1 por medio del algoritmo de Levenberg‐Marquardt. Primeramente se probará el correcto funcionamiento de la codificación de este método Levenberg‐Marquardt (LM) utilizando el conjunto de funciones de Moré, el estándar habitualmente utilizado con los algoritmos numéricos de optimización como es LM. A continuación la precisión numérica del método LM en el ajuste de la Transformada‐C, con su código compilado para correr en microprocesador de 8 bits de bajo coste, se obtiene comparándolo con la obtenida por el mismo código corriendo en un ordenador personal convencional de 32 bits. Junto con estos temas esenciales, se consideran otros en este capítulo, como por ejemplo el análisis de la correcta definición de la figura de merito de los MC cuando se opera sobre la Transformada C, también la correcta definición de la Transformada‐C de tal modo que se eviten discontinuidades que puedan ralentizar su ajuste, o la exploración de la precisión de una implementación alternativa del método LM donde las derivadas del Hessiano y el gradiente sean calculadas mediante diferencias finitas en lugar de a través de sus expresiones analíticas. El Capítulo 3 comienza por probar la coherencia física del modelo de calibración, mediante la utilización de un seguidor de laboratorio en el que se instalan diversas muestras de módulos CPV, y donde algunos de los parámetros del modelo de calibración pueden ser previamente fijados, regulando la posición tanto del seguidor como de los módulos de prueba, de tal modo que tras obtener un conjunto de medidas de posición del sol y ajustar la Transformada C, los valores resultantes para los parámetros deberían coincidir con aquellos que fueron manualmente prefijados. Una vez que el modelo de calibración queda validado, el siguiente objetivo es medir la precisión de seguimiento alcanzable por el sistema control de seguimiento calibrado desarrollado. Esto requirió en primer lugar el desarrollo de un Sensor de Precisión de Seguimiento (SPS, en inglés TAS de Tracking Accuracy Sensor) capaz de proporcionar medidas en tiempo real del error de apuntamiento. Este sensor esencialmente consiste en un tubo colimador montado sobre un sensor electrónico de imagen, y que cuenta con la electrónica necesaria de acondicionamiento de señal, todo desarrollado junto con las ecuaciones de conversión necesarias para obtener el error angular de apuntamiento a partir de variables eléctricas internas, y también con un procedimiento de calibración para obtener con precisión los parámetros internos de construcción del sensor que intervienen en las ecuaciones de conversión. Este sensor terminó alcanzando una resolución en la determinación del error de apuntamiento de una diezmilésima de grado dentro de su apertura angular de un grado. Finalmente un sistema de monitorización se ha construido en torno al TAS instalado en el referido seguidor de laboratorio, y mediante la calibración de su control de seguimiento contra este TAS, se puede obtener una estimación para la estadística del error de apuntamiento para una serie de variaciones de la estrategia de calibración aquí descritas. En estos experimentos se ha demostrado que precisiones promedio diarias de 0. 05 °, donde la precisión es mejor que 0. 1 °, el 97 % del tiempo, son posibles. Todas las pruebas realizadas en el Capítulo 3 orientadas a comprobar la correcta operación del control de seguimiento calibrado, requirieron la recolección previa de un conjunto de entre cincuenta y cien medidas de la posición del sol, a lo largo de un día de orto a ocaso, con que luego realizar el ajuste del modelo de calibración. Esto fue realizado de manera manual, apuntando el seguidor de laboratorio al sol, hasta que de acuerdo con un cierto criterio se conseguía su apuntamiento optimo, momento en el cuales e registraban las posiciones de los ejes de seguimiento junto con la hora exacta en la que se realizaba la medida. Se trataba en cualquier caso de una tarea aburrida y susceptible de errores, que era necesario automatizar completamente, de tal modo que se realizará con los menores requerimientos de intervención manual y mantenimiento. En el Capítulo 4 se describe el hardware y los algoritmos necesarios para implementar la colección automática de medidas de posición del sol. Pero antes de entrar con la descripción completa del proceso de adquisición de estas medidas, se presenta una revisión de las efemérides solares existentes y sus respectivas precisiones, incluidas las finalmente elegidas para su integración en el equipo de control de seguimiento objeto de este trabajo. En cuanto a las medidas de posición del sol, estas comienzan con una búsqueda preliminar del sol en el interior del rango se seguimiento del concentrador, hasta que este entra dentro de su apertura angular, problema este que será abordado recurriendo a las herramientas de la Teoría de Búsqueda, una rama de la Investigación Operativa desarrollada durante la Segunda Guerra Mundial en el marco de la guerra antisubmarina. En concreto, cuando dicha búsqueda se instrumenta mediante un sensor grueso de la posición del sol tal como un pequeño panel plano FV, el camino optimo de búsqueda puede obtenerse tomando las suposiciones del llamado "Problema del Punto Llameante" (en inglés "Flaming Datum Problem") que surge inicialmente en la búsqueda de un submarino enemigo que escapa tras haber revelado su posición al atacar a un barco amigo. Una vez el sol es detectado al entrar en la apertura angular del concentrador, un apuntamiento preciso pasaría por maximizar su potencia de salida, pero según veremos problemas de índole practico aparecen cuando se elige la potencia de salida como la variable a maximizar, y esto es debido a las dificultades de las etapas de seguimiento del punto de máxima potencia (en inglés MPPT: Maximum Power Point Tracking) existentes a la entrada de los inversores convencionales tienen para seguir los movimientos exploratorios del seguidor. Por ello se propone la maximización de otras variables eléctricas bajo dife...|$|E

40|$|It is an {{important}} technological challenge to ensure a LEO satellite ground terminal autonomy {{as well as to}} make it small, lightweight and power efficient along with the ability to predict the satellite visibility passes. Another important feature is to make it able to compensate for Doppler on the satellite link with an economical method. In this paper, an orbit and Doppler calculation methodology has been developed for a general orbital model. The algorithm that manages the ground terminal automatic operation ensures many advantages and is adapted to a microcontroller programming. Inputs to the algorithm are time, position and keplerian elements from NORAD. The NORAD elements are injected in the terminal memory via its serial port once before it is deployed on the operation field. Time is provided by a real time clock read and written by the terminal microcontroller. Terminal geographic position is provided by an internal integrated miniature GPS which makes the terminal free to move anywhere on the terrestrial globe and still be able to contact the satellite without any reprogramming. The orbit calculation methodology used expresses the satellite coordinates in the terminal relative <b>topocentric</b> (horizontal) <b>coordinate</b> system which easily yield the values of elevation and azimuth angles along with the slant range. This is achieved by means of satellite vector transformations through different coordinate systems. Doppler shift is obtained by deriving the slant range in time.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to analyse succintly the {{juridical}} and geodetic concepts of the characterization of corners in geometric space. From the juridical basis, the speciality principle of the real (praedial) property right is analysed. This principle embraces both juridical aspects strictly and requisite for the obligatory individualization of real property by means of geographic data that determine having one meaning only the terrestrial space which by he himself occupied. From the geodetic basis, the systems of coordinates for the terrestrial geodetic measurements are synthetized. Two distinct systems are selected as appropriate models. The first is the polar astronomical <b>topocentric</b> system of <b>coordinates</b> in which are collected the geodetic observations by means of measuring instruments (e. g., tachymeter). The second is the polar ellipsoidal system of coordinates in which are described boundaries. The mathematical method to determine the surface of the any polygons on the ellipsoid as function of the ellipsoidal geographic coordinates is presented. The quality measures of geodetic networks are listed. A refined structure for the real property registration in which geodetic and statistic quantities are necessary for the speciality principle interpretation and the complements for the pertinent juridical norm, i. e., the article 225 of the Brazilian federal Law n. 6015 / 1973 (Lei de Registros Públicos) are proposed. It is supported in the thesis that the refined conception of the geodetic model for the characterization of corners in the geometric space so that the boundaries de iure place approximately the boundaries de facto must be the intersection between the principles contained in the real (praedial) property right and principles contained in the Geodesy...|$|R
