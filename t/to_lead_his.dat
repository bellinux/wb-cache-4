5|$|Areola {{represented}} France {{at every}} youth level from U16 to U21 between 2008 and 2014. He was the hero for France in the 2013 FIFA U-20 World Cup Final. Having ended goalless after extra-time, the match {{went to a}} penalty shoot out where Areola saved spot-kicks from Uruguay's Emiliano Velázquez and Giorgian De Arrascaeta <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> <b>his</b> nation to their first ever triumph in the tournament. He had previously featured for France at the 2010 UEFA European Under-17 Championship and the 2012 UEFA European Under-19 Championship's, and subsequently at the 2015 UEFA European Under-21 Championship.|$|E
5|$|Burrows {{played two}} {{seasons in the}} Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL) with the Shawinigan Cataractes, {{beginning}} in 2000–01. He recorded 16 goals and 30 points over 63 regular season games, then added three points over 10 post-season games. The following season, he improved to 35 goals and 70 points over 64 games, third in team-scoring, behind Jonathan Bellemare and Jason Pominville. He went on <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> <b>his</b> team in post-season scoring with nine goals and 21 points in 12 games as the Cataractes advanced to the Conference Finals, where they were eliminated in seven games by the Victoriaville Tigres.|$|E
5|$|In the Horizon league tournament, Stevens' Bulldogs {{used their}} home-court {{advantage}} to beat Milwaukee 68–59 in the semi-finals and to beat Wright State 70–45 in the finals. The win earned the team an automatic bid into the 2010 NCAA tournament, and completed a 20–0 run through league play. Stevens {{became the first}} coach to lead a Horizon League team to both an undefeated regular season and conference tournament since the league was formed in 1979. Stevens was also the only coach in Division I <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> <b>his</b> team to an undefeated conference schedule during the 2009–10 season.|$|E

5|$|McCudden {{remained}} in England until July 1918 {{when he was}} given command of No. 60 Squadron RAF. He flew to Farnborough in a Vickers F.B.16 to collect his new Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5a before returning to France <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> <b>his</b> new Squadron. On 3 July he flew back in this fighter and over his home in Kingston upon Thames, taking the aircraft to 17,000 feet and circling London for an hour. When he landed he made his last entry into his log book. His total flying time had reached 872 hours and 40 minutes.|$|E
5|$|After Argentina's {{unsuccessful}} {{performance in}} the Copa América, Batista was replaced by Alejandro Sabella. Upon his appointment in August 2011, Sabella awarded the 24-year-old Messi the captaincy of the squad, in accord with then-captain Javier Mascherano. Reserved by nature, Messi went on <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> <b>his</b> squad by example as their best player, while Mascherano continued to fulfil {{the role of the}} team's on-field leader and motivator. In a further redesign of the team, Sabella dismissed Tevez and brought in players with whom Messi had won the World Youth Championship and Olympic Games. Now playing in a free role in an improving team, Messi finally ended his goal drought by scoring during their first World Cup qualifying match against Chile on 7 October, his first official goal for Argentina in two-and-a-half years.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, Soult led a small force, some 150 musket-men, {{across the river}} Linth—the men held their muskets over their heads and waded across, through water to their chests—and {{protected}} the crossing site {{for the remainder of}} the force. Baron von Hotze, commander of the Austrian force there, advanced on the position near Richterswil to direct its defense, and was killed by a French musket ball. His successor, Franz Petrasch, could not push the French back, and organized a retreat from the region, falling back to St. Gallen and losing another 8,000 men and some guns. By the time Suvorov arrived in St. Gallen in early October, the Austrians and the Russians had been pushed out and he was forced <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> <b>his</b> men over the Alps to the Vorarlberg, resulting in additional losses.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{disadvantage}} in numbers {{as well as}} attacking a fixed position, Williams' and Macdonell's small force was driving the opposing force {{to the edge of}} the gorge on which the redan was situated, and seemed on the verge of success before the Americans were able to regroup and stand firm. The momentum of the battle turned when a musket ball hit Macdonell's mount (causing it to rear and twist around) and another shot hit him in the small of the back, causing him to fall from the horse. He was removed from the battlefield and died from his injuries early the next day. Captain Williams was laid low by a wound to the head, and Dennis by a severe wound to the thigh (although he continued <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> <b>his</b> detachment throughout the action). Carrying Macdonnell and the body of Brock, the British fell back through Queenston to Durham's Farm, a mile north near Vrooman's Point.|$|E
5|$|During {{the initial}} {{phase of the}} campaign, Nansouty's {{division}} was at first attached to Marshal Louis Nicolas Davout's III Corps, with which it crossed the Rhine and then the Danube, before rejoining Murat's cavalry reserve. Nansouty had a first opportunity <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> <b>his</b> men into combat at the Battle of Wertingen, where his men were noted for their excellent manoeuvring. Detaching his two Carabiniers-à-Cheval regiments, which {{he had to leave}} with Murat, Nansouty and his reduced division followed the Emperor at Augsburg, where he was attached to Marshal Jean Lannes's V Corps. In this capacity, they supported Walther's division at the Battle of Schöngrabern. Then, at the Battle of Wischau on 25 November 1805, the 9th Cuirassiers participated in a major cavalry action, alongside d'Hautpoul's cuirassier division, Walther's dragoons and Bessières's Grenadiers à Cheval and Chasseurs à Cheval of the Guard cavalry.|$|E
5|$|During {{the third}} attempt to relieve Mantua, Vukassovich {{participated in the}} Tyrol Corps' {{victories}} at Cembra on 2 November and the Battle of Calliano on 6–7 November. On the 17th, his troops battled {{their way out of}} the Adige River gorge to link up with Joseph Ocskay von Ocsko's column on the heights. Together they routed the French at Rivoli Veronese. After Bonaparte won the Battle of Arcole, the French army commander drove the Tyrol Corps back to Trento. During the fourth attempt to relieve Mantua, Jozsef Alvinczi directed Vukassovich <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> <b>his</b> 6th Column down the east bank of the Adige River. His artillery supported the attack of Prince Heinrich XV of Reuss-Plauen on the west bank of the river, but he exerted little other influence on the disastrous result of the Battle of Rivoli because his troops were on the wrong side of the river.|$|E

5|$|Guevara grows {{sick and}} by Day 280 can barely breathe {{as a result}} of his acute asthma. Nevertheless, he {{continues}} <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> <b>his</b> group towards the other column of revolutionaries. On Day 302, the Bolivian Army wipes out the other column, killing Tania Bunke, Juan Acuña Ñunez, and several others in an ambush as they attempt to cross the Vado del Yeso after a local informant tells the Bolivian troops about the movements of the rebels. By Day 340, Guevara is trapped by the Bolivian Army in the Yuro Ravine near the village of La Higuera. Che is wounded and captured. The next day, a helicopter lands and Cuban American CIA agent Félix Rodríguez emerges to interrogate Che, but without success. The Bolivian high command then phones and orders Guevara's execution. He is shot on 9 October 1967, and his corpse lashed to a helicopter's landing skids and flown out.|$|E
5|$|Hominid {{takes place}} several {{million years ago}} in the Central African {{transitional}} region between rainforest and savanna. The main characters are Australopithecus afarenses, an extinct, mostly tree-dwelling hominid that existed before the use of tools and fire. The story is told through first-person narration by the protagonist, Pitar. In deliberating his social and natural environment, Pitar decides <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> <b>his</b> band to civilization: “Hence I decided to shed some light on the darkness, to light a candle following the motto Let there be light and so on.” His linguistic capacity, thoughts and speech correspond to those of modern man, and he also is knowledgeable about history, politics, philosophy and literature. Intermittent comments made by Pitar concerning a particular prospect or artifact that has not been invented or developed yet add to the humor of the grotesque scenario. Pitar's close friends are Carpediem, who enunciates Latin phrases and quotes the writers of Classical Antiquity, and Lao, who frequently refers to Chinese philosophy.|$|E
5|$|In Kentucky, the Americans {{went on the}} {{defensive}} while Caldwell and his Indian allies prepared a major offensive. In July 1782, more than 1,000 Indians gathered at Wapatomica, but the expedition {{came to a halt}} after scouts reported that George Rogers Clark was preparing to invade the Ohio Country from Kentucky. Most of the Indians dispersed after learning that the reports of imminent invasion were false, but Caldwell led 300 Indians into Kentucky and delivered a devastating blow at the Battle of Blue Licks in August. After his victory at Blue Licks, Caldwell was ordered to cease operations because the United States and Great Britain were about to make peace. Although General Irvine had finally gotten permission <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> <b>his</b> own expedition into the Ohio Country, rumors of the peace treaty killed enthusiasm for the undertaking, which never took place. In November, George Rogers Clark delivered the final blow in the Ohio Country, destroying several Shawnee towns, but inflicting little damage on the inhabitants.|$|E

Francis Muthaura initially appointed another British lawyer, Karim Ahmad Khan, who previously led the defence of Charles Taylor at the Special Court for Sierra Leone, and subsequently also recruited Essa Faal and Shyamala Alagendra who both formerly worked in the ICC Prosecutor's office. Ali's defence was led by Canadian John Philpot, Kosgey's by Julius Kemboi, and William Ruto appointed Dr. Kindiki Kithure and Katwa Kigeni. Kigeni is also representing Joshua Sang. The Kenyan government has agreed to pay the legal costs of Francis Muthaura and Mohamed Ali due to their actions being taken {{in the course of}} their public employment. This decision has attracted criticism from many Kenyans.|$|E
5|$|López was {{the second}} Panamanian-born major league {{baseball}} player {{and continues to be}} one of the country's most revered world champion athletes. Although Humberto Robinson (102 games played/5 seasons) debuted in the major leagues 22 days earlier than López, López (1,450 games played/12 seasons) was the first of the 49 major leaguers born in Panama to have an extensive career. He was the first Panamanian-born major leaguer to finish in the top 10 in any official statistical category (sacrifice hits, 1956); first <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> <b>his</b> league in any official statistic (sacrifice flies, 1958); first to play in the World Series (with the 1960 Yankees); and the first to win a World Championship (with the 1961 Yankees).|$|E
5|$|Manuel made serious {{tactical}} errors, such as {{failing to}} properly scout out the route ahead. These failings caused him <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> <b>his</b> forces straight into a classic ambush. On 17 September 1176 Manuel was decisively defeated by Seljuk Sultan Kilij Arslan II at the Battle of Myriokephalon (in highlands near the Tzibritze pass), {{in which his}} army was ambushed while marching through the narrow mountain pass. The Byzantines were too dispersed, and were surrounded. The army's siege equipment was quickly destroyed, and Manuel was forced to withdraw – without siege engines, the conquest of Iconium was impossible. According to Byzantine sources, Manuel lost his nerve both {{during and after the}} battle, fluctuating between extremes of self-delusion and self-abasement; according to William of Tyre, he was never the same again.|$|E

At the time of their November 2011 National Letter of Intent signings, Stauskas, Glenn Robinson III and Mitch McGary gave Michigan a consensus top 10 entering class for its 2012 class. Stauskas visited Michigan along with future teammate Robinson to see the 61–56 New Year's Day 2012 victory by the 2011–12 Wolverines team over Minnesota. Then Stauskas led St. Mark's to 67–57 victory in a 2012 Hoophall Classic contest with 16 points against Friends Central. As the season progressed, Stauskas (and Robinson) improved in the national player ratings to offset McGary's slide and maintain a top-rated class. He scored 19 <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> <b>his</b> school to a 59–53 2012 NEPSAC Class AA Championship game victory over Noel's Tilton. Stauskas earned the NEPSAC championship game MVP.

5|$|Sherman {{began his}} Civil War career {{serving in the}} First Battle of Bull Run and Kentucky in 1861. He served under General Ulysses S.

In 1864, Sherman succeeded Grant as the Union {{commander}} in the western theater of the war. He proceeded <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> <b>his</b> troops to the capture of the city of Atlanta, a military success that contributed to the re-election of Abraham Lincoln. Sherman's subsequent march through Georgia and the Carolinas further undermined the Confederacy's ability to continue fighting. He accepted the surrender of all the Confederate armies in the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida in April 1865, after having been present at most major military engagements in the western theater.|$|E
5|$|Sultan Khalifah sent Zanzibari troops led by Brigadier-General Lloyd Mathews, {{a former}} Lieutenant of the Royal Navy, {{to restore order}} in Tanganyika. The {{operation}} was largely successful, but anti-German feeling among the Zanzibari people remained strong. Further conflicts erupted at Bagamoyo, where 150 natives were killed by German military forces, and at Ketwa, where German officials and their servants were murdered. Khalifah then granted extensive trade rights to the Imperial British East Africa Company (IBEAC) who, with German assistance, ran a naval blockade to halt the continuing domestic slave trade. Upon Khalifah's death in 1890 Ali bin Said ascended to the sultanate. Sultan Ali banned the domestic slave trade (but not slave ownership), declared Zanzibar a British protectorate and appointed Lloyd Mathews as First Minister <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> <b>his</b> cabinet. The British were also guaranteed a veto over the future appointment of sultans.|$|E
