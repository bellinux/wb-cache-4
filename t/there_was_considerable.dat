5|$|Additionally, the {{definition}} kept Pluto as a planet.

5|$|After the Imperial Japanese Navy's {{attacks on}} the Allies in December 1941, the RAN redeployed its larger ships to home waters, to protect the Australian {{mainland}} from Japanese attack, while several smaller ships remained in the Mediterranean.

5|$|Even {{before her}} launch, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>considerable</b> {{discussion}} of Tritons role beyond her radar picket mission. An internal Navy memorandum set forth four {{options for the}} submarine's extended use.

However, {{with the exception of the}} command ship option, all of these proposed configurations required extensive modification of her original design.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{discovery}} of the planet Neptune in 1846, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>considerable</b> speculation that another planet might exist beyond its orbit. The search began in the mid-19th century and culminated {{at the start of the}} 20th with Percival Lowell's quest for PlanetX. Lowell proposed the PlanetX hypothesis to explain apparent discrepancies in the orbits of the giant planets, particularly Uranus and Neptune, speculating that the gravity of a large unseen ninth planet could have perturbed Uranus enough to account for the irregularities.|$|E
5|$|In the 1870s and 1880s <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>considerable</b> {{tension in}} the region—between the rural residents, who were {{for the most part}} Democrats from the {{agricultural}} South, and town residents and business owners, who were largely Republicans from the industrial Northeast and Midwest. The tension culminated in what has been called the Cochise County feud, and the Earp-Clanton feud, which ended with the historic Gunfight at the O.K. Corral and Wyatt Earp's Vendetta Ride.|$|E

5|$|<b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>considerable</b> {{debate whether}} pterosaurs ambulated as quadrupeds or as bipeds. In the 1980s, {{paleontologist}} Kevin Padian suggested that smaller pterosaurs with longer hindlimbs, such as Dimorphodon, might have walked or even run bipedally, {{in addition to}} flying, like road runners. However, {{a large number of}} pterosaur trackways were later found with a distinctive four-toed hind foot and three-toed front foot; these are the unmistakable prints of pterosaurs walking on all fours.|$|E
5|$|<b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>considerable</b> local {{opposition}} to the Yellowstone National Park during its early years. Some of the locals feared that the regional economy {{would be unable to}} thrive if there remained strict federal prohibitions against resource development or settlement within park boundaries and local entrepreneurs advocated reducing the size of the park so that mining, hunting, and logging activities could be developed. To this end, numerous bills were introduced into Congress by Montana representatives who sought to remove the federal land-use restrictions.|$|E

5|$|Although Australia was {{remote from}} the main battlefronts, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>considerable</b> Axis naval {{activity}} in Australian waters during the Second World War. A total of 54 German and Japanese warships and submarines entered Australian waters between 1940 and 1945 and attacked ships, ports and other targets. Among the best-known attacks are the sinking of HMAS Sydney by a German raider in November 1941, the bombing of Darwin by Japanese naval aircraft in February 1942, and the Japanese midget submarine attack on Sydney Harbour in May 1942. In addition, many Allied merchant ships were damaged or sunk off the Australian coast by submarines and mines. Japanese submarines also shelled several Australian ports and submarine-based aircraft flew over several Australian capital cities.|$|E
5|$|Although the Industrial Revolution did {{not much}} affect the rural parts of Clwyd, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>considerable</b> {{industrial}} {{activity in the}} North Wales Coalfield in the north-east of the county, particularly around Wrexham.

The Williams-Wynn family of Wynnstay had become rich after the dissolution of the monasteries and owned vast estates in Clwyd with resources including lead, tin and copper as well as corn and timber.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{the work}} on reactor development, the Metallurgical Laboratory studied the {{chemistry}} and metallurgy of plutonium, and worked with DuPont to develop the bismuth phosphate process used to separate plutonium from uranium. When it became certain that nuclear reactors would involve radioactive materials on a gigantic scale, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>considerable</b> concern about {{the health and safety}} aspects, and the study of the biological effects of radiation assumed greater importance. It was discovered that plutonium, like radium, was a bone seeker, making it especially hazardous. The Metallurgical Laboratory became the first of the national laboratories, the Argonne National Laboratory, on 1 July 1946.|$|E
