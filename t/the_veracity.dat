5|$|The Apple River Fort Historic Foundation began {{attempting}} {{to locate the}} original site of the fort {{in the spring of}} 1995.

5|$|The siege left several traces in {{the legends}} of the nascent Muslim world, {{although}} it is conflated with accounts of another expedition against the city a few years previously, led by the future Caliph Yazid I.

5|$|A {{number of}} {{accounts}} {{state that the}} congregation's first synagogue was built at South State and South streets in 1861 and burned by the Union Army in 1863, but <b>the</b> <b>veracity</b> of this claim is disputed. In 1867 the congregation constructed a wood frame building {{at the corner of}} South State and South streets. The building, which was used both as a schoolhouse and for prayer services, was the first synagogue in Mississippi.|$|E
5|$|Modern historians, however, doubt <b>the</b> <b>veracity</b> of this theory. For one thing, notes Kenneth R. Beesley, the Deseret News {{and every}} book {{published}} in the alphabet prominently feature {{the key to the}} alphabet, and anyone without a key could have gotten a copy of A Journey to Great-Salt-Lake City, or traveled to Salt Lake City themselves and bought one. Contemporary scholars Richard F. Burton and Jules Remy also dismissed the secrecy argument, in 1860 and 1855 respectively.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle was}} brought to greater public {{attention}} in 1992 by a CBC television docu-drama, The Valour and the Horror, which {{made a number of}} controversial claims about senior leadership in the Second World War and devoted one of its three episodes to the Black Watch attack on Verrières Ridge. The episode raised a spirited debate among the historical and veterans' communities and led to calls for apologies from the producers and an official investigation by the CBC Ombudsman into <b>the</b> <b>veracity</b> of the claims {{and the way in which}} they were presented.|$|E

5|$|The {{deaths of}} twelve newborn babies in Banja Luka {{hospital}} {{due to a}} shortage of incubator bottled oxygen were cited as an immediate cause for the action, but <b>the</b> <b>veracity</b> of the incident has since been questioned.

5|$|During {{the tour}} an {{anonymous}} person named Publius posted {{a message on}} an internet newsgroup, inviting fans to solve a riddle supposedly concealed in the new album. <b>The</b> <b>veracity</b> of the message was demonstrated when white lights {{in front of the}} stage at a performance in East Rutherford spelled out the words Enigma Publius. During a televised concert at Earls Court in October 1994, the word enigma was projected in large letters on to the backdrop of the stage. Mason later acknowledged that the Publius Enigma did exist, and that it had been instigated by the record company rather than the band. As of 2014 the puzzle remains unsolved.|$|E
5|$|Ginsburg {{was in the}} {{minority}} for Gonzales v. Carhart, , a 5–4 decision upholding restrictions on partial birth abortion. In her dissent, Ginsburg opposed the majority's decision to defer to legislative findings that the procedure was not safe for women. Ginsburg focused her ire on the way Congress reached its findings and with <b>the</b> <b>veracity</b> of the findings. Joining the majority for Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt, , a case which struck down parts of a 2013 Texas law regulating abortion providers, Ginsburg also authored a short concurring opinion which was even more critical of the legislation at issue. She asserted the legislation was not aimed at protecting women's health, as Texas had claimed, but rather to impede women's access to abortions.|$|E

5|$|In {{the present}} day, Dr. Archie Hopper (Sbarge) {{continues}} to evaluate Henry (Jared S. Gilmore), {{who is still}} trying to convince him that he is Jiminy. Meanwhile, Sheriff Graham (Jamie Dornan) officially makes Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) his new deputy. An explosion soon after causes the town to shake, followed by a sinkhole that emerges at an abandoned mine shaft. As Emma, Henry, Archie, and the sheriff show up to see the damaged area, Regina (Lana Parrilla) arrives to try to keep everyone from going any further, then comes across a certain object which looks like an ornate piece of glass and puts it in her pocket. She is also not pleased with the sheriff hiring Emma, and also reminds Archie that she can have him fired and out on the streets if he fails to succeed in dissuading Henry of <b>the</b> <b>veracity</b> of the fairy tale stories.|$|E
5|$|Later that year, Europe {{experienced}} {{a series of}} protests, rebellions and often violent upheavals that {{became known as the}} Revolutions of 1848. In France, a revolution led to the overthrow of the monarchy and the establishment of the French Second Republic. Marx was supportive of such activity and having recently received a substantial inheritance from his father (withheld by his uncle Lionel Philips since his father's death in 1838) of either 6,000 or 5,000 francs he allegedly used a third of it to arm Belgian workers who were planning revolutionary action. Although <b>the</b> <b>veracity</b> of these allegations is disputed, the Belgian Ministry of Justice accused Marx of it, subsequently arresting him and he was forced to flee back to France, where with a new republican government in power he believed that he would be safe.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, it is {{unwise to}} dismiss it {{altogether}} {{as it is}} also the principal Latin source regarding a century of Roman history. For example, scholars had assumed that Veturius Macrinus mentioned in the Life of Didius Julianus was an invention of the author, like so many other names. However, an inscription was uncovered which confirmed his existence and his post as Praetorian Prefect in 193. Likewise, the information that Hadrian's Wall was constructed during Hadrian's reign and that the Antonine Wall was built during the reign of Antoninus Pius are recorded by no other extant ancient writer apart from the Historia Augusta, <b>the</b> <b>veracity</b> of which has been confirmed by inscriptions.|$|E

5|$|Shostakovich's Symphony No. 7 {{enjoyed a}} measure of {{popularity}} throughout the Western world during the war, but from 1945 it was rarely performed outside the Soviet Union. It became a point of controversy in the 1980s after Solomon Volkov's Testimony suggested it was a critique not of the Nazis, but of the Soviet government. <b>The</b> <b>veracity</b> of Volkov's account, which he claims is rooted in interviews with Shostakovich, has been debated. Other issues of contention about the symphony include whether it {{was inspired by the}} attack on Leningrad (as Soviet authorities and official accounts had asserted) or planned earlier and repurposed for propaganda, as well as its artistic merit compared to Shostakovich's other works.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>veracity</b> of Hahn's {{claim was}} {{questioned}} {{as early as}} 1876, and the illustration appears to be plagiarised from the plate by François-Nicolas Martinet which was published at least 50 years earlier. After King Maximilian died in 1825, his collection was auctioned off, but no Mascarene parrot was mentioned in the inventory list of species. Hahn {{did not mention the}} date in which he actually saw the bird which could have been long before 1834. However, the fact that Martinet's image was copied and that no mounted specimen exists (though such a rare bird would probably have been preserved) makes Hahn's account dubious. He may instead have based his account on other sources or even hearsay.|$|E
5|$|Thurisind, in {{observance}} {{of the laws}} of hospitality, received Alboin and his companions and organized a banquet in their honour, offering Alboin the place where his dead son habitually sat. Following a mockery by Turismod's brother Cunimund and Alboin's rejoinder, a clash was avoided by Thurisind's intervention, who restored the peace and sent Alboin away with Turismod's arms. According to István Boná, who believes in <b>the</b> <b>veracity</b> of the story, the event may have taken place as described by Paul, but it also could reflect a secret peace condition imposed by Audoin on Thurisind under which the Gepid king had to arm his son's killer.|$|E

5|$|During the {{criminal}} trial, {{all the major}} figures in the case were called on to give evidence. Le Gris and Carrouges began proceedings and were followed by a heavily pregnant Marguerite {{and at least one}} of her maidservants as well as Adam Louvel. As people of low birth, Louvel and the servants were all subject to torture to test <b>the</b> <b>veracity</b> of their testimony but none gave evidence against Le Gris and the case continued through the summer and into September without conclusion. Le Gris' case involved several strategies; he attempted to discredit his opponent by telling of Carrouges' infamous temper and describing the case against him as a jealous invention from a man who had threatened to beat his wife if she did not corroborate his accusations. Le Gris then provided alibis for the entire week in question, establishing his whereabouts in testimony backed up by several other squires of the court of Count Pierre. Finally he attempted to demonstrate in court that it was physically impossible for him to have ridden in winter from Argentan to Capomesnil, where the crime supposedly took place, in a single day, a round trip of approximately 50miles (80km).|$|E
5|$|Following Thompson's attack upon <b>the</b> <b>veracity</b> of the codex, {{a number}} of {{scholars}} published their opinions that the document is genuine {{over the course of}} the 1980s and early 1990s, including John B. Carlson, Yuri Knorozov, Thomas A. Lee, Jr., Jesús Ignacio Mora Echeverría, George E. Stuart, and Karl Taube. In 2000, German epigrapher Nikolai Grube expressed his belief that the document is genuine, based upon the precision of the Venus almanac. However, in a later publication from 2012, he clearly calls the codex a forgery. In 2002, French archaeologist Claude-François Baudez commented – like Thompson before – that the codex serves no divinatory purpose and was useless as an aid to a Maya priest; he believes that the document is the product of a forger using pre-Columbian materials but relatively ignorant of his subject. The codex is notable in its use of prominent illustrations of uniform size and the almost complete absence of hieroglyphic text; the deities lack names and the cardinal directions are unmarked. In a paper published in 2003, the authors (including Mayanist Stephen D. Houston) argue that the iconography and lack of hieroglyphic text are the result of a strong central Mexican stylistic influence.|$|E
5|$|Much of the sunnah is {{recorded}} in the Hadith. Initially, Muhammad had instructed his followers not to write down his acts, so they may not confuse it with the Qur'an. However, he did ask his followers to disseminate his sayings orally. As {{long as he was}} alive, any doubtful record could be confirmed as true or false by simply asking him. His death, however, gave rise to confusion over Muhammad's conduct. Thus the Hadith were established. Due to problems of authenticity, the science of Hadith (Arabic: `Ulum al-hadith) is established. It is a method of textual criticism developed by early Muslim scholars in determining <b>the</b> <b>veracity</b> of reports attributed to Muhammad. This is achieved by analyzing the text of the report, the scale of the report's transmission, the routes through which the report was transmitted, and the individual narrators involved in its transmission. On the basis of these criteria, various Hadith classifications developed.|$|E
