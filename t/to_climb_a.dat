5|$|Authors and {{military}} analysts {{have speculated that}} had Kingsbury not attacked, the Japanese might have destroyed the battalion. The Japanese had been attacking in waves, and had started <b>to</b> <b>climb</b> <b>a</b> steep hill to outflank the Australians, {{in an effort to}} win the battle. The Australians were low on supplies and the Japanese {{were on the verge of}} breaking through the Australian line. Had they broken through, they would have been able to isolate the battalion's headquarters from the soldiers on the flanks. This would have prevented the Australians from retreating to Alola, allowing the Japanese to overrun them.|$|E
5|$|A {{new game}} {{mechanic}} {{to the series}} {{is the use of}} a slate found on all the Ages. These slates can be carved using the mouse to create shapes and symbols. The use of the slate is necessary to communicate with a shadowy race of creatures known as the Bahro. The Bahro understand certain symbols drawn on the slate and will respond to them; the creatures also retrieve the slate and return it to its original space if the player drops it. Slate symbols can cause environmental changes such as rain or increased wind, which may be necessary for solving puzzles. The slate cannot be carried everywhere due to its size. For example, the player will have to leave the slate behind if they want <b>to</b> <b>climb</b> <b>a</b> ladder.|$|E
5|$|Next, {{the finals}} of The 2007 Fight for the Right Tournament were held between Christian Cage and Kaz in a ladder match that lasted 15 minutes and 13 seconds. In a ladder match, an object is hung above {{the ring and}} the first <b>to</b> <b>climb</b> <b>a</b> ladder and {{retrieve}} the object is the winner. During the match, Cage was legitimately busted open above his eye. Midway through the encounter, the contract fell off the clipboard that hung above the ring, which changed the objective to just grabbing the clipboard to win. Kaz won the contest after causing Cage to fall off the ladder onto Styles and Tomko, who were interfering on Cage's behalf, and then ascending the ladder to grab the clipboard, becoming number one contender to the TNA World Heavyweight Championship in the process.|$|E

5|$|On the {{edition of}} SmackDown! {{following}} The Great American Bash, Eddie Guerrero revealed the secret {{he had been}} keeping; he was Dominick's real father, not Rey Mysterio (was thought to be). At SummerSlam, Mysterio defeated Guerrero in a ladder match, where the goal is <b>to</b> <b>climb</b> <b>a</b> ladder to retrieve an object that is suspended in the air. As per pre-match stipulations, Mysterio gained complete custody of Dominick. On the September 9 edition of SmackDown!, Guerrero defeated Mysterio in a steel cage match to end the feud. Guerrero then began a feud with Batista when Guerrero was given a title match at No Mercy. Guerrero, however, died unexpectedly of heart failure on November 13, 2005. In 2006 Guerrero {{was inducted into the}} WWE Hall of Fame by Mysterio, his nephew Chavo Guerrero, and Chris Benoit.|$|E
5|$|The angle between Eddie Guerrero and Rey Mysterio continued. On {{an episode}} of SmackDown!, Guerrero {{threatened}} to reveal a secret concerning Mysterio's son Dominick. This led the families of both Guerrero and Mysterio pleading with Guerrero not to reveal the secret. At the Great American Bash, Mysterio defeated Guerrero in a match where if Guerrero lost, he could not reveal the secret. On the July 28 episode of SmackDown!, Guerrero, however, revealed the secret, claiming he was Dominick's scripted biological father. The storyline also went on that Guerrero knew Mysterio was having trouble starting his own family, so Guerrero left Dominick to be raised by Mysterio's family. In subsequent weeks, Guerrero threatened to take custody of Dominick, drawing up custody papers and having his lawyer present them to Mysterio. This led to a Ladder match, a match where the objective was <b>to</b> <b>climb</b> <b>a</b> ladder and reach an object hanging above the ring, between the two for the custody of Dominick at SummerSlam, which Mysterio won.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} at Victory Road was a Ladder {{match for the}} NWA World Heavyweight Championship between the champion, Jeff Jarrett, and the challenger, Jeff Hardy. In a Ladder match, two or more {{participants}} fight <b>to</b> <b>climb</b> <b>a</b> ladder to retrieve a contract, championship belt, or some other type of object to win. Jarrett was scripted to defend the championship against Hardy on the October 15 episode of TNA's primary television program, TNA Impact!, after Hardy won a tournament to become number one contender. Jarrett defeated Hardy to retain the championship once before, on September 6 at TNA's final weekly PPV, which set up the rivalry between the two. On the October 22 episode of Impact!, Hardy challenged Jarrett to contest their bout under Ladder match rules, which Jarrett accepted.|$|E

5|$|The {{main event}} {{was for the}} NWA World Heavyweight Championship between the champion, Jeff Jarrett, and the challenger, Kevin Nash, in which Jarrett won to retain the championship. Another {{featured}} match was an Iron Man match for the TNA X Division Championship, in which the wrestler with the most scoring conditions after thirty minutes would win. The champion, A.J. Styles, defeated the challenger, Christopher Daniels, to retain the championship in this match. Multiple bouts were scheduled on the undercard. One saw Abyss defeat Jeff Hardy in a match where the competitors had <b>to</b> <b>climb</b> <b>a</b> ladder and retrieve an envelope to become number one contender to the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, in {{what is called a}} Full Metal Mayhem match. The other being for the NWA World Tag Team Championship between the champions, America's Most Wanted (Chris Harris and James Storm) (AMW), and Kid Kash and Lance Hoyt; AMW claimed victory in the match.|$|E
5|$|The next {{match of}} the evening was the fourth-annual Money in the Bank ladder match, in which there were no {{disqualifications}} or countouts, {{and the only way}} to win the match was <b>to</b> <b>climb</b> <b>a</b> ladder in the ring and retrieve a contract briefcase hanging above. The match featured Chris Jericho, Mr. Kennedy, and Carlito from the Raw brand; CM Punk, Shelton Benjamin and John Morrison from the ECW brand; and Montel Vontavious Porter (M.V.P.) from the SmackDown brand. Jeff Hardy was supposed to be in the match, but he violated the wellness program and was taken out of the match. Early in the match, Morrison climbed a turnbuckle and performed a moonsault onto other competitors outside the ring while holding a ladder against his chest. Later, while Kennedy and Morrison were battling on top of a ladder, Benjamin climbed another ladder placed adjacent to the first one and performed a sunset flip powerbomb on Kennedy, who in turn superplexed Morrison from the top of the ladder. Later, Carlito and Kennedy flipped Benjamin off a ladder in the ring, sending him crashing through another ladder set-up between the barricade and the ring apron. When MVP was close to retrieving the contract briefcase, Matt Hardy (returning to action after suffering a legitimate injury), entered the ring from the crowd, climbed the ladder, and delivered a Twist of Fate to MVP off that ladder. As soon as Morrison started <b>to</b> <b>climb</b> <b>a</b> ladder, see-sawing with another ladder, Jericho flipped the other one and Morrison landed on the ring-ropes groin-first. Jericho even performed a Codebreaker on Punk using a ladder. In the end, Jericho and Punk fought each other on a ladder, but Punk trapped Jericho's one leg in the ladder's steps and retrieved the briefcase to win the match. This was an interpromotional match.|$|E
5|$|The third {{match was}} The Hardy Boyz (Matt and Jeff) against The World's Greatest Tag Team (Shelton Benjamin and Charlie Haas) in a Ladder {{match for the}} World Tag Team Championship. The goal is <b>to</b> <b>climb</b> <b>a</b> ladder and {{retrieve}} the title belts suspended above the ring. The Hardys had the advantage {{for most of the}} match, but as Jeff was climbing the ladder to try and grab the belts, Benjamin botched a springboard attempt. Benjamin kicked the ladder from underneath Jeff, however, to gain control. The Hardys regained the advantage by pushing the ladder as The World's Greatest Tag Team were climbing it, causing Benjamin to fall to the floor. Jeff Swanton bombed Haas as Matt climbed the ladder to get the belts and win.|$|E

5|$|Most non-human-related {{mortality}} involves nestlings or eggs. Around 50% of eagles survive {{their first}} year. However, in the Chesapeake Bay area, 100% of 39 radio-tagged nestlings survived {{to their first}} year. Occasionally, nestling or egg fatalities are due to nest collapses, starvation, sibling aggression or inclement weather. Another significant cause of egg and nestling mortality is predation. These have been verified to be preyed by large gulls, corvids (including ravens, crows and magpies), wolverines (Gulo gulo), hawks, owls, eagles, bobcats (Lynx rufus), American black bears (Ursus americanus) and raccoons. If food access is low, parental attendance at the nest may be lower because both parents may have to forage thus resulting in less protection. Nestlings are usually exempt from predation by terrestrial carnivores that are poor tree-climbers, but Arctic foxes (Vulpes lagopus) occasionally snatched nestlings from ground nests on Amchitka Island in Alaska before they were extirpated from the island. The bald eagle will defend its nest fiercely from all comers and has even repelled attacks from bears, having been recorded knocking a black bear out of a tree when the latter tried <b>to</b> <b>climb</b> <b>a</b> tree holding nestlings.|$|E
5|$|The Free State {{began using}} its new-found {{control of the}} region to levy taxes from the local population, {{gathered}} using similar hostage tactics to the Manyema. The taxes were initially collected {{in the form of}} ivory but when ivory supplies began to run low the Free State switched to natural rubber. The rubber was collected from Landolphia owariensis gentilii rubber vines which were relatively scarce in the area with an average frequency of around one plant in each acre. The rubber was gathered by tapping a rubber vine and placing a pot beneath to collect the latex which could be used in the production of rubber for the European market. If the vines were a long distance from the ground the gatherer would have had <b>to</b> <b>climb</b> <b>a</b> tree, tap the plant and hold the collecting pot beneath the vine, possibly for an entire day. Hence rubber collection was a labour-intensive process which made it unpopular with the villagers. Indeed, they preferred the Manyema to the Free State authorities as the Manyema only took low bulk, high value items such as ivory or slaves because of the long distances from their homeland whereas the state, with its steamboat transports, could afford to make the people harvest the low value high bulk rubber. By September 1892 the Free State was using its military forces to attack and occupy villages in the Lulonga and Maringa river valleys to expand its tax base.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} match (which {{received}} a pre-match endorsement from Shawn Michaels) saw Adrian Neville challenging Bo Dallas in the first-ever ladder {{match for the}} NXT Championship. In {{the first half of}} the match, Dallas attempted <b>to</b> <b>climb</b> <b>a</b> ladder while he pinned Neville under the ladder, but Neville used his legs to push the ladder over. Near the end of the match, Neville attempted his signature Red Arrow, but Dallas pushed him off the ropes to the apron and the floor. Neville recovered and used the ropes to springboard over a climbing Dallas and leapfrog him on the ladder. In response, Dallas powerbombed Neville onto a ladder in the corner of the ring. Dallas then charged while holding a ladder, but Neville kicked the ladder into Dallas' face and slammed Dallas onto the ladder. Neville climbed to the top rope and dove off with his Red Arrow while Dallas was on the ladder. This incapacitated Dallas long enough for Neville to set up and climb the ladder to retrieve the NXT Championship hanging above the ring. The show ended with Neville celebrating with his new championship.|$|E

5|$|The {{main event}} was a King of the Mountain {{match for the}} TNA World Heavyweight Championship with Kevin Nash as Special Guest Ringside Enforcer between then-champion Samoa Joe and the challengers Booker T, Christian Cage, Rhino, and Robert Roode. In a King of the Mountain match, the {{objective}} is <b>to</b> <b>climb</b> <b>a</b> ladder and hang the championship belt on a hook above the ring.

Booker T {{was the first to}} qualify by pinning Rhino after slamming him back-first into the mat with his signature Book End maneuver. Rhino was this placed in the penalty box. Roode was the next to qualify after bashing a ladder Cage held with a chair into him and following with a pin. Immediately afterwards, Rhino pinned Roode with a roll-up pin to qualify. Later, Joe held Booker T in his signature Coquina Clutch submission hold when Cage ascended a padded turnbuckle and jumped off onto Booker T and Joe. He followed by pinning Booker T to qualify and send Booker T to the penalty box. When Booker T was released from the box, he attacked Nash with the title belt and then attempted to hang it. Nash stopped him and then dropped Booker T back-first against the mat with his signature Jackknife Powerbomb maneuver. Joe was the last to qualify by pinning Roode after slamming him back and neck-first into the mat with his signature Muscle Buster maneuver. Joe then hung the title belt at 19 minutes and 49 seconds to win the competition.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} was the King of the Mountain {{match for the}} NWA World Heavyweight Championship, in which then-champion A.J.

Waltman was later pinned by Brown following his signature Alpha Bomb, forcing Waltman to go to the penalty box. Raven was the next to qualify by pinning Styles on the outside of the ring following a Pounce by Brown. Styles was then forced to spend two minutes in the box. Later, Abyss pinned Brown after his signature Black Hole Slam maneuver, sending Brown to the box. Soon after, Styles qualified by pinning Abyss after forcing him through a table with his Spiral Tap maneuver. Waltman was the last to qualify by pinning Styles following his signature X-Factor maneuver off the top of a ladder. Raven was the eventual winner of the contest, after hanging the championship belt above the ring at 14 minutes and 17 seconds.|$|E
