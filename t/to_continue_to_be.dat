5|$|The {{success and}} economy of {{multiple}} rocket launchers (MRL) have led them <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> developed. During the Cold War, the Soviet Union fielded several models of Katyusha-like MRL, notably the BM-21 launchers somewhat {{inspired by the}} earlier weapon, and the larger BM-27. Advances in artillery munitions have been applied to some Katyusha-type multiple launch rocket systems, including bomblet submunitions, remotely deployed land mines, and chemical warheads.|$|E
5|$|Despite Peter's {{insistence that}} he is fit <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{the leader of the}} new community, the townspeople run him out of New Quahog, and his family follows him. Meanwhile, the eggs that stewie laid up hatch, {{revealing}} the octopus-Stewies. The citizens proceeds to burn the guns Peter had made with the pipes {{in the middle of the}} town square, but as the final gun in thrown onto the pile, hundreds of newly spawned Octopus-Stewies begin to destroy the city, with the townspeople unable to protect themselves from the mutants. As the family walks away, oblivious to the town's destruction, they decide to continue to a Carvel factory in Framingham.|$|E
5|$|Further {{evidence}} {{for the existence of}} the Kuiper belt later emerged from the study of comets. That comets have finite lifespans has been known for some time. As they approach the Sun, its heat causes their volatile surfaces to sublimate into space, gradually dispersing them. In order for comets <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> visible over the age of the Solar System, they must be replenished frequently. One such area of replenishment is the Oort cloud, a spherical swarm of comets extending beyond 50,000 AU from the Sun first hypothesised by Dutch astronomer Jan Oort in 1950. The Oort cloud is thought to be the point of origin of long-period comets, which are those, like Hale–Bopp, with orbits lasting thousands of years.|$|E

5|$|BioWare {{provided}} its Aurora Engine from Neverwinter Nights for the sequel. One of {{the decisions}} to use Aurora rather than build a new engine from scratch was the toolset—Obsidian wanted players <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to make content for the game, which {{may not have been}} possible with a new engine. BioWare made itself available to Obsidian with technical support on the engine, but Obsidian planned on completely overhauling Aurora, including its code. The designers wanted to improve the visuals of the first game with additions such as better lighting and textures, which required significant changes to the engine. The upgraded engine was referred to as Electron. Electron was designed to incorporate DirectX to make it compatible for a potential Xbox 360 release, but Obsidian eventually abandoned plans for a port to the system for financial reasons. The toolset that was used to create the game was also revamped, and included several additions like a customizable interface, a new dialogue format, and building assistants—similar to the wizards found in Microsoft Word and Excel. Like Neverwinter Nights, the toolset was included in the game's release for players to use.|$|E
5|$|Stokesay Castle is a {{fortified}} {{manor house}} in Stokesay, Shropshire, England. It {{was built in}} the late 13th century by Laurence of Ludlow, then the leading wool merchant in England, who intended it to form a secure private house and generate income as a commercial estate. Laurence's descendants continued to own the castle until the 16th century, when it passed through various private owners. By the time of the outbreak of the English Civil War in 1641, Stokesay was owned by William Craven, the first Earl of Craven and a supporter of King Charles I. After the Royalist war effort collapsed in 1645, Parliamentary forces besieged the castle in June and quickly forced its garrison to surrender. Parliament ordered the property to be slighted, but only minor damage was done to the walls, allowing Stokesay <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> used as a house by the Baldwyn family {{until the end of the}} 17th century.|$|E
