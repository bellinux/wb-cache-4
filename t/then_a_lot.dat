25|$|Organizations {{increasingly}} {{make money}} from trading in already existing assets which are not used by them to produce any new products and services with. Put differently, an increasing share of total generic profit income consists of net interest, net taxes, net capital gains, fees & royalties, and rents. This can happen {{because a lot of}} non-productive assets have been accumulated that are available for trade; second-hand physical assets, financial assets and properties are being traded; all sorts of things are traded internationally, taking advantage of currency and cost differentials; assets are being held via all kinds of special financial constructions to extract profit, etc. And, an increasing amount of interest payments, rents and capital gains have been excluded from operating surplus because, by statistical definition, they are not classified as production expenditure at all (i.e. they are not counted as value-added). Post-Keynesian researchers such as Wynne Godley and Marc Lavoie therefore tried to devise more adequate measures of the real financial profitability of companies. If a lot of capital is borrowed at a cost which is lower than the income obtained from reinvesting it in assets that appreciate in value, <b>then</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of profit income is earnt which has nothing directly to do with creating new product value, and therefore is not counted as value-added. Instead, existing wealth is transferred from one set of owners to another.|$|E

500|$|His on-air {{commentary}} {{has caused}} controversy. As a commentator, Boycott has renewed his 'pull-no-punches' style {{in contrast to}} most of his fellow commentators. In particular he is known for criticising players, often in a caustic and strident style. In 2005 he mocked the Australian captain Ricky Ponting for electing to bowl first on a batsman-friendly pitch, saying he was a [...] "nice man" [...] for being so generous to the England team. In 2006, he was initially receptive to the difficulties endured by Marcus Trescothick during his periods of stress-related illness; however, he was not always as amiable. In March 2008, recently dropped Steve Harmison attacked Boycott {{in an article in}} The Mail on Sunday where he referred to Boycott as a [...] "waste of space."

500|$|Tippett {{described}} himself as the receiver of inspiration rather than its originator, the creative spark coming from a particular personal experience, which might take one of many forms but was most often associated with listening to music. [...] The process of composing was lengthy and laborious, the actual writing down of the music being preceded by several stages of gestation; as Tippett put it, [...] "the concepts come first, and <b>then</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of work and imaginative processes until eventually, when you're ready, finally ready, you look for the actual notes". Tippett elaborated: [...] "I [...] compose by first developing an overall sense {{of the length of}} the work, then of how it will divide itself into sections or movements, then of the kind of texture or instruments or voices that will be performing it. I prefer not to consider the actual notes of the composition until this process... has gone as far as possible". Sometimes the time required to see a project through from conception to completion was very lengthy—seven years, Tippett says, {{in the case of the}} Third Symphony. [...] In the earlier, contemplative stages he might be simultaneously engaged on other works, but once these stages were complete he would dedicate himself entirely to the completion of the work in hand. Tippett preferred to compose in full score; once the writing began, progress was often not fluent, as evidenced by Tippett's first pencil draft manuscripts which show multiple rubbings-out and reworkings. In this, the musicologist Thomas Schuttenhelm says, his methods resembled those of Beethoven, with the difference that [...] "whereas Beethoven's struggle is considered a virtue of his work, and almost universally admired, Tippett's was the source and subject of a debate about his competency as a composer".|$|E
500|$|With Interview magazine, Madonna {{explained}} her inspirations {{behind the}} songs and the music of Hard Candy. She said that [...] "probably in many respects most of the songs [...] are [...] But in more of an unconscious way. I don't really think about telling personal stories when I'm writing music. It just comes. And <b>then</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of times, six months later, eight months later, I go, 'Oh, that's what I wrote that song about.' But that's when I play the song for lots of people and they all go, 'Oh, I can totally relate to that.'" [...] "Candy Shop" [...] is the opening track of the album. Produced by Williams, the song uses the word candy {{as a metaphor for}} sex. Williams said, [...] "We were just in a studio, [...] and [...] was like, 'Look, give me some hot shit.' I was looking at her like, 'She's saying hot shit?' She was like, 'What?' And I'm like, 'OK.' So we just worked and made it." [...] The first single from the album, [...] "4 Minutes", was initially known as [...] "4 Minutes to Save the World". The song's development was motivated by a sense of urgency to save the planet from destruction, and how people can enjoy themselves in the process. According to Madonna, the song inspired her to produce the documentary I Am Because We Are. The song features vocals by Timberlake and Timbaland. An uptempo dance song with an urban, hip hop style, it also incorporates Timbaland's bhangra beats. The instrumentation used in the song includes brass, foghorns and cow bells. The song's lyrics carry a message of social awareness, inspired by Madonna's visit to Africa and the human suffering she witnessed.|$|E

2500|$|Originally {{published}} as The Secret Ascension by Tor Books in 1987 (but subsequently reprinted with the author's preferred title), {{this work is}} an homage to writer Philip K. Dick, a pastiche of his style, and includes an alternate reality version of Dick as a character. [...] The novel {{is set in a}} world in which Richard Milrose Nixon, in his fourth term as president, holds fascistic control over America, and the science fiction works of Philip K. Dick remain unpublished, distributed underground as samizdat, while his realist fiction titles are the ones that are celebrated as masterpieces. Author and reviewer Orson Scott Card writes that [...] "the climax is not just an inward epiphany for a character… he world changes in wonderful strange ways, and the audience can read the book passionately, with sweating fingers, eager to see what happens next, yet reluctant to leave the present moment. Imagine: A writer who is already one of the best, taking risks and finding ways to be better." [...] Card does take Bishop to task for the author's characterization of Richard Nixon, calling it a [...] "caricature" [...] and a [...] "stock character of a madman." [...] Locus reviewer Tom Whitmore calls the book [...] "a masterful pastiche" [...] and [...] "…the closest thing to a classic Dick sf novel anyone has ever done." [...] Gerald Jonas in the New York Times writes [...] "Mr. Bishop is a solid, serious writer whose reach (in his previous work) has always seemed to me to exceed his grasp. Here, he catches some of Dick's fire, especially in the early chapters… <b>Then</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> happens very quickly (as in some of Dick's own novels), and the satire, which should hold things together, turns predictable. But…the ending (starring Philip K. Dick) approaches sublimity." [...] The novel was nominated for the Arthur C. Clarke Award in 1989.|$|E
