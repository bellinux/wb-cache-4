5|$|The Vijayanagara Empire, (also called Karnata Empire, and the Kingdom of Bisnegar by the Portuguese) {{was based}} in the Deccan Plateau region in South India. It was {{established}} in 1336 by Harihara I and his brother Bukka Raya I of Sangama Dynasty. The empire rose to prominence as a culmination of attempts by the southern powers to ward off Islamic invasions {{by the end of}} the 13th century. It lasted until 1646, although its power declined after a major military defeat in 1565 by the combined armies of the Deccan sultanates. The empire is named after its capital city of Vijayanagara, whose ruins surround present day Hampi, now a World Heritage Site in Karnataka, India. The writings of medieval European travelers such as Domingo Paes, Fernão Nunes, and Niccolò Da Conti, and <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> <b>in</b> local languages provide crucial information about its history. Archaeological excavations at Vijayanagara have revealed the empire's power and wealth.|$|E
5|$|The {{book was}} hailed as an {{important}} addition to <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> <b>in</b> both environmental ethics and process philosophy. Garland offered two challenges to Palmer's claims. First, he challenged her linking of process ethics with individualist consequentialism, arguing that it is instead somewhere between individualist consequentialism and deep ecology. Second, he challenged Palmer's claim that process philosophers will always favour human ends over nonhuman ends. Cobb and Menta, though both welcoming her consideration of process philosophy, challenged Palmer's interpretation of the philosophy of Whitehead and Hartshorne {{on a number of}} points.|$|E

However, Revesz syndrome, a severe variant of dyskeratosis congenita, was later shown to result from heterozygous dominant mutations in the TINF2 gene, which encodes TRF1-interacting nuclear factor 2, {{a major component of}} the telomere protecting shelterin complex, and individuals with the leukoencephalopathy with calcifications and cysts phenotype have not had mutations in the CTC1 gene.|$|E
25|$|Information {{about the}} safety and {{efficacy}} of synephrine used as a single drug may be deduced from the foregoing review of <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> <b>in</b> this Article.

Since this body of literature deals with mixtures containing synephrine as only one of several biologically-active components, even, in some cases, without explicit confirmation of the presence of synephrine, further discussion is outside the scope of this article.|$|E

25|$|Renal {{replacement}} therapy, such as with hemodialysis, may be instituted in {{some cases}} of AKI. Renal replacement therapy can be applied intermittently (IRRT) and continuously (CRRT). Study results regarding differences in outcomes between IRRT and CRRT are inconsistent. A systematic review of <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> <b>in</b> 2008 demonstrated no difference in outcomes {{between the use of}} intermittent hemodialysis and continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) (a type of continuous hemodialysis). Among critically ill patients, intensive renal replacement therapy with CVVH does not appear to improve outcomes compared to less intensive intermittent hemodialysis. However, other studies demonstrated that compared with IRRT, initiation of CRRT is associated with a lower likelihood of chronic dialysis.|$|E
25|$|While the {{scientific}} study of language is known as linguistics and is generally considered a social science, a natural science or a cognitive science, the study of languages is still central to the humanities. A good deal of twentieth-century and twenty-first-century philosophy has been devoted to the analysis of language and to the question of whether, as Wittgenstein claimed, many of our philosophical confusions derive from the vocabulary we use; literary theory has explored the rhetorical, associative, and ordering features of language; and historical linguists have studied the development of languages across time. Literature, covering a variety of uses of language including prose forms (such as the novel), poetry and drama, also {{lies at the heart of}} the modern humanities curriculum. College-level programs in a foreign language usually include study of important works of <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> <b>in</b> that language, as well as the language itself.|$|E
25|$|The {{surviving}} {{texts of}} the Avesta, as they exist today, derive from a single master copy produced by Sasanian Empire-era (224–651 CE) collation and recension. That master copy, now lost, {{is known as the}} 'Sassanian archetype'. The oldest surviving manuscript (K1) of an Avestan language text is dated 1323 CE. Summaries of the various Avesta texts found in the 9th/10th century texts of Zoroastrian tradition suggest that a significant portion of <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> <b>in</b> the Avestan language has been lost. Only about one-quarter of the Avestan sentences or verses referred to by the 9th/10th century commentators {{can be found in the}} surviving texts. This suggests that three-quarters of Avestan material, including an indeterminable number of juridical, historical and legendary texts, have been lost since then. On the other hand, it appears that the most valuable portions of the canon, including all of the oldest texts, have survived. The likely reason for this is that the surviving materials represent those portions of the Avesta that were in regular liturgical use, and therefore known by heart by the priests and not dependent for their preservation on the survival of particular manuscripts.|$|E

25|$|Makars at {{the court}} of James IV {{included}} Robert Henryson, William Dunbar and Gavin Douglas. Douglas's Eneados (1513) was the first complete translation of a major classical text in an Anglian language. James V supported William Stewart and John Bellenden. David Lyndsay wrote elegiac narratives, romances and satires. George Buchanan founded a tradition of neo-Latin poetry that would continue in to the seventeenth century. From the 1550s cultural pursuits were limited {{by the lack of}} a royal court, political turmoil and discouragement from the Kirk. Poets from this period included Richard Maitland of Lethington, John Rolland), Alexander Hume and Alexander Scott. James VI promoted <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> <b>in</b> Scots and became patron and member of a loose circle of court poets and musicians, later called the Castalian Band, which included William Fowler, John Stewart of Baldynneis, and Alexander Montgomerie. After his accession to the English throne in 1603 James VI increasingly favoured the language of southern England and the loss of the court as a centre of patronage was a major blow to Scottish literature. A new tradition of vernacular Gaelic poetry began to emerge, including work by women such as Mary MacLeod of Harris. The tradition of neo-Latin poetry reached its fruition with the publication of the anthology of the Deliciae Poetarum Scotorum (1637). This period was marked by the work of female Scottish poets including Elizabeth Melville's, whose Ane Godlie Dream (1603) was the first book published by a woman in Scotland. The ballad became a recognised literary form by aristocratic authors including Robert Sempill, Lady Elizabeth Wardlaw and Lady Grizel Baillie.|$|E
