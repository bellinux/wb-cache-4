5|$|Einstein {{argued that}} <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> {{fundamental}} reasons, because the gravitational field {{could be made}} to vanish by a choice of coordinates. He maintained that the non-covariant energy momentum pseudotensor was in fact the best description of the energy momentum distribution in a gravitational field. This approach has been echoed by Lev Landau and Evgeny Lifshitz, and others, and has become standard.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, the United States Mint began {{releasing}} {{a set of}} half-ounce $10 gold coins under the First Spouse Program with engravings of portraits of the First Ladies on the obverse. When a President served without a spouse, a gold coin is issued that bears an obverse image emblematic of Liberty as depicted on a circulating coin of that era and a reverse image emblematic of themes of that President's life. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> the coins for Thomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson, Martin Van Buren, and James Buchanan's First Ladies, but not the coin for Chester A. Arthur's First Lady, which will instead depict suffragette Alice Paul.|$|E
25|$|<b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> the Coptic Orthodox Church; use of {{the term}} and order of {{services}} are somewhat different in the Ethiopian, Syrian, and the other Oriental Orthodox Churches.|$|E

60|$|<b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>true,</b> <b>for</b> of {{the various}} fruits which grew wild in the island, the cocoa-nut, plantain, and banana were to be had all the year round.|$|R
25|$|It {{follows from}} this formula that U and V jointly act irreducibly on the Schrödinger {{representation}} since <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> the operators given by kernels that are Schwartz functions.|$|E
25|$|For {{some basic}} graph classes, closed {{formulas}} for the chromatic polynomial are known. For instance <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> trees and cliques, as {{listed in the}} table above.|$|E
25|$|The {{genes of}} the major {{histocompatibility}} complex (MHC) are highly polymorphic, and this diversity plays {{a very important role}} in resistance to pathogens. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> other species as well.|$|E
60|$|And <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>true,</b> <b>for</b> {{he cared}} nothing {{as to what}} {{took place in the}} resort so long as it did not appertain to Mr. Allen or Hardwick.|$|R
60|$|<b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>true,</b> <b>for</b> Buttercup, reflecting, probably, {{that she}} might be missed in the kitchen, had {{suddenly}} tumbled Rover off the tree and darted swiftly from the spot.|$|R

25|$|Text {{encoded in}} UTF-8 will be {{smaller than the}} same text encoded in UTF-16 if there are more code points below U+0080 than in the range U+0800..U+FFFF. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> all modern European languages.|$|E
25|$|LiH is less {{reactive}} {{with water}} than Li {{and thus is}} a much less powerful reducing agent for water, alcohols, and other media containing reducible solutes. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> all the binary saline hydrides.|$|E
25|$|Like other Internal Arts, {{much of the}} {{training}} in Xing Yi Quan is done in slow-motion. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> almost all the movements in the art, though {{the majority of them}} can and are also trained explosively.|$|E
30|$|From {{the above}} criteria, {{it was found}} that Zarineh Obato and Bijar had a {{relatively}} good situation with respect to wind power density. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> all three selected heights.|$|R
50|$|The station {{retained}} its importance even for long-distance traffic. With few exceptions, long-distance trains stopped in both Dresden Hauptbahnhof and Dresden-Neustadt. To avoid the time-consuming reversal of trains at the Hauptbahnhof, some trains operated from Neustadt station. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>true,</b> <b>for</b> example, for the Städteexpress Fichtelberg from Karl-Marx-Stadt to Berlin-Lichtenberg.|$|R
6000|$|<b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>true,</b> <b>for</b> the post-office Andrea Ferrara has a {{stirring}} history, {{but for the}} present its price was the important thing. [...] "Dr. McQueen offered a pound note for it," [...] said Tommy.|$|R
25|$|In some {{classes of}} graphs, {{it has been}} proven that the pathwidth and treewidth are always equal to each other: <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> cographs, {{permutation}} graphs, the complements of comparability graphs, and the comparability graphs of interval orders.|$|E
25|$|This {{implies the}} extreme value theorem: a {{continuous}} real-valued function on a nonempty compact space is bounded above and attains its supremum. (Slightly more generally, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> an upper semicontinuous function.) As {{a sort of}} converse to the above statements, the pre-image of a compact space under a proper map is compact.|$|E
25|$|The type of T-cell help raised is {{influenced}} by the delivery method and the type of immunogen expressed, as well as the targeting of different lymphoid compartments. Generally, saline needle injections (either IM or ID) tend to induce TH1 responses, while gene gun delivery raises TH2 responses. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> intracellular and plasma membrane-bound antigens, but not for secreted antigens, which seem to generate TH2 responses, regardless of the method of delivery.|$|E
60|$|<b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>true,</b> <b>for</b> {{the train}} had {{stopped at a}} way station, having broken {{something}} on the engine, and the thief had left, to walk {{the remainder of the}} distance to Middletown on foot.|$|R
30|$|The higher was {{the task}} surface illuminance, the higher was the {{relative}} energy savings. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> all lighting scenarios. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> {{because of a}} larger difference between task surface illumination and ambient illumination.|$|R
60|$|<b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>true,</b> <b>for</b> the good-natured Letty, having {{discovered}} the mistake {{that had been}} made, had concluded to say nothing about it and to keep away from Aunt Patsy's for a few days, until the matter should be forgotten.|$|R
25|$|The {{centers of}} the circles of a Steiner chain lie on a conic section. For example, if the smaller given circle lies within the larger, the centers lie on an ellipse. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> any set of circles that are {{internally}} tangent to one given circle and externally tangent to the other; such systems of circles appear in the Pappus chain, the problem of Apollonius, and the three-dimensional Soddy's hexlet. Similarly, if some circles of the Steiner chain are externally tangent to both given circles, their centers must lie on a hyperbola, whereas those that are internally tangent to both lie on a different hyperbola.|$|E
25|$|Huguenots {{controlled}} sizeable {{areas in}} central and southern France. The population around the Massif Central and the area around Dordogne was almost entirely Reformed. John Calvin was a Frenchman and {{largely responsible for the}} introduction and spread of the Reformed tradition in France. He wrote in French, but unlike the Protestant development in Germany where Lutheran writings were widely distributed and could be read by the common man, it was not the case in France where only nobles adopted the new faith and the folk remained Catholic. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> areas in the west and south controlled by the Huguenot nobility. Although large portions of peasant population became Reformed, the people remained majority Catholic.|$|E
25|$|Formal self-insurance is the {{deliberate}} decision {{to pay for}} otherwise insurable losses out of one's own money. This can be done on a formal basis by establishing a separate fund into which funds are deposited on a periodic basis, or by simply forgoing the purchase of available insurance and paying out-of-pocket. Self-insurance is usually {{used to pay for}} high-frequency, low-severity losses. Such losses, if covered by conventional insurance, mean having to pay a premium that includes loadings for the company's general expenses, cost of putting the policy on the books, acquisition expenses, premium taxes, and contingencies. While <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> all insurance, for small, frequent losses the transaction costs may exceed the benefit of volatility reduction that insurance otherwise affords.|$|E
60|$|Susan knew <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>true,</b> <b>for</b> her {{mother-in-law}} {{had been one}} of those bustling, managing housewives, who prefer doing everything themselves to training others, and she was appalled at the idea of the probable desolation and helplessness of the bereaved household.|$|R
60|$|<b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>true,</b> <b>for</b> I found that, strive as I would, I {{could not}} move a limb or even an eyelid. I was frozen to that spot {{and there was nothing}} for it except to curse my folly and say my prayers.|$|R
60|$|<b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>true,</b> <b>for</b> {{the hard}} {{travelling}} which Miles had recently endured, {{and the heavy}} burdens which he had borne, had developed his muscles {{to such an extent}} that his frame was almost equal to that of the negro, and a fit subject for the sculptor's chisel.|$|R
25|$|Estrogens affect liver protein {{synthesis}} and thereby influence the cardiovascular system. They {{have been found}} to affect the production of a variety of coagulation and fibrinolytic factors, including increased factor IX, von Willebrand factor, thrombin–antithrombin complex (TAT), fragment 1+2, and D-dimer and decreased fibrinogen, factor VII, antithrombin, protein S, protein C, tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA), and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). Although <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> oral estrogen, transdermal estradiol has been found only to reduce PAI-1 and protein S, {{and to a lesser extent}} than oral estrogen. Due to its effects on liver {{protein synthesis}}, oral estrogen is procoagulant, and has been found to increase the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). Conversely, modern oral contraceptives are not associated with an increase in the risk of stroke and myocardial infarction (heart attack) in healthy, non-smoking premenopausal women of any age, except in those with hypertension (high blood pressure). However, a small but significant increase in the risk of stroke, though not of myocardial infarction, has been found in menopausal women taking hormone replacement therapy. An increase in the risk of stroke has also been associated with older high-dose oral contraceptives that are no longer used.|$|E

25|$|Losses were {{light on}} both sides despite the {{intensity}} of the fight. Several of the Union ships were hit, but none suffered severe damage. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> the Confederates also, aside from Curlew, but the remaining Mosquito Fleet had to retire simply because they ran out of ammunition.|$|R
