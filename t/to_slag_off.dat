The title of the symposium is {{a reference to the}} Triumph of Painting shows staged in 2005 by Charles Saatchi, and according to The Independent newspaper, [...] "Charles Saatchi is about to become the latest victim of a critical mauling from the people of Liverpool", whose [...] "finest academics are meeting <b>to</b> <b>slag</b> <b>off</b> the secretive collector." [...] It marks a new step for the artists: [...] "The Stuckists have gained some academic credibility after being dismissed as a media freak-show." ...|$|E
5000|$|I want <b>to</b> <b>slag</b> <b>off</b> all {{the people}} in charge of radio stations. Firstly, Radio 1. They outlawed the pirates and then didn't, as they promised, cater for the market the pirates created. Radio 1 and 2, most afternoons, run {{concurrently}} and the whole thing has slid right back to where it was before the pirates happened. They've totally fucked it. There's no radio station for young people any more. It's all down to housewives and trendies in Islington. They're killing the country by having that play list monopoly. —Joe Strummer Initially, the station was unpopular with some of its target audience who, it is claimed, disliked the fact that much of its airtime was shared with Radio 2 and that it was less unequivocally aimed at a young audience than the offshore stations, with some DJs such as Jimmy Young being in their 40s. The very fact that it was part of an [...] "establishment" [...] institution such as the BBC was a turn-off for some, and needle time restrictions prevented it from playing as many records as offshore stations had. It also had limited finances (partially because the BBC did not increase its licence fee to fund the new station) and often, as in January 1975, suffered disproportionately when the BBC had to make financial cutbacks, strengthening an impression that it was regarded as a lower priority by senior BBC executives.|$|E

To improve the service life it would be desirable <b>to</b> protect the <b>slag</b> contacting zones by ceramics of the highest possible quality. To this end research was carried out to develop plasma sprayed ceramic coatings of high slagging resistance using conventional refractory bricks as substrates. The parameters investigated were composition of coatings and substrate preheating and spraying conditions. The testing program comprised bond strength, thermal shock and abrasive wear behaviour of the coatings as well as wetting and resistance <b>to</b> <b>slagging</b> using a commercial blast furnace slag. As a result several coatings were found with superior resistance <b>to</b> <b>slag</b> attack.
