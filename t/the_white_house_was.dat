5|$|During {{much of the}} {{presidency}} of Harry Truman, Blair House served as the temporary residence of President Truman while the interior of <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>was</b> being renovated. On November 1, 1950, Puerto Rican nationalists Griselio Torresola and Oscar Collazo attempted to assassinate President Truman in Blair House. The assassination was foiled, in part by White House policeman Leslie Coffelt, who killed Torresola but was mortally wounded by him.|$|E
5|$|Foraker {{had known}} that with McKinley in the Executive Mansion (as <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>was</b> still {{formally}} known) and Sherman expected to be senior senator, he could expect only limited patronage appointments for his supporters. With McKinley's close friend Hanna instead in the Senate, Foraker was allowed to recommend appointees to the President, but McKinley allowed Hanna to exercise a veto over Foraker's candidates.|$|E
5|$|Truman {{surrounded}} {{himself with}} his old friends, and appointed several to high positions that seemed well beyond their competence, including his two secretaries of the treasury, Fred Vinson and John Snyder. His closest friend in <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>was</b> his military aide Harry H. Vaughan, who seemed to others like a huge joke.|$|E

5|$|During the 1970s, two key {{and popular}} {{facilities}} were built: the Dorothy Hughes Pack Holiday Centre for Cub Scouts and the Colquhoun International Centre for training Scouters, originally called The International Hall of Friendship. In the 1980s extensive remodelling of <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>was</b> done. In April 2001, The Scout Association moved its program staff from London to Gilwell Park, where its training staff were already located. Extensive renovations were {{done to the}} White House and other buildings. With a budget of £20,000,000 and individual contributions as high as £500,000, improvements to programs and facilities have been ongoing since then {{in preparation for the}} 21st World Scout Jamboree in 2007, which was the 100th anniversary of Scouting, hosted at nearby Hylands Park, Chelmsford, Essex with related activities also being held at Gilwell Park. Gilwell Park provides The Scout Association with over £1,000,000 a year through conference fees, accommodation fees, and sales of materials.|$|E

25|$|Hunt's first {{assignment}} for <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>was</b> a covert operation {{to break into}} the Los Angeles office of Daniel Ellsberg's psychiatrist, Lewis J. Fielding. In July 1971, Fielding had refused a request from the Federal Bureau of Investigation for psychiatric data on Ellsberg. Hunt and Liddy cased the building in late August. The burglary, on September 3, 1971, was not detected, but no Ellsberg files were found.|$|E
25|$|Computers and {{the first}} laser printer were added during the Carter administration, {{and the use of}} {{computer}} technology was expanded during the Reagan administration. A Carter-era innovation, a set of solar water heating panels that were mounted on the roof of <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House,</b> <b>was</b> removed during Reagan's presidency. Redecorations were made to the private family quarters and maintenance was made to public areas during the Reagan years. The house was accredited as a museum in 1988.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} of the American Civil War, the White House had become overcrowded. The {{location}} of <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>was</b> questioned, just north of a canal and swampy lands, which provided conditions ripe for malaria and other unhealthy conditions.

25|$|Over {{the next}} 37 years, {{subsequent}} presidents mostly maintained the Green Room as Coolidge left it, with only minor alterations. One significant change was made after <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>was</b> gutted and renovated under President Harry S. Truman in 1952. When the Green Room was decorated after the renovation, {{the walls were}} covered in a green silk damask {{in the style of}} Robert Adam (manufactured by American fabrics firm Scalamandré). The window treatments and drapes used the same fabric, with the window treatments covering the window moldings.|$|E
25|$|The United States {{publicly}} disclaimed responsibility or {{involvement in}} the coup. Many, including Harriman, General Maxwell Taylor, and Assistant Secretary of State Roger Hilsman, denied involvement, although Hilsman admitted that American disapproval of Diem's policies would have encouraged the generals. Privately, <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>was</b> elated by the coup, {{as it had been}} relatively bloodless. The White House fostered the impression that the coup was purely Vietnamese and claimed to have no knowledge of it. A year later, Trueheart was quoted that the United States had been aware of the generals' actions.|$|E
25|$|The East Room {{was among}} the last rooms on the State Floor to be {{completed}} and used. <b>The</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>was</b> unfinished when President John Adams occupied it between 1800 and 1801. His wife, Abigail Adams, hung laundry in the bare East Room to dry. Although much of <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>was</b> finished and decorated during Adams administration, the East Room was not. The room's lone artwork was {{a copy of the}} Lansdowne portrait depicting George Washington, painted by Gilbert Stuart in 1797. It was purchased by the White House in 1800, and hung in the East Room. (Rescued from the 1814 fire, it still hangs there, with a companion portrait of Martha Washington painted by Eliphalet Frazer Andrews in 1878.) There was extensive feeling in Congress that Adams had adopted too many of the trappings of monarchy, and Congress declined to appropriate funds to finish the room for fear it would look too much like a throne room. During the Jefferson administration, 38 gold-and-black painted chairs were purchased and placed in the room, but little else is known of the room's furnishings prior to 1814. Jefferson also had the East Room partitioned (using canvas and sailcloth for walls) and the southern end used for a bedroom and office for Meriwether Lewis and Lewis Harvie (both Private Secretary to the President).|$|E

25|$|After Miers {{failed in}} these private meetings, Republican Senators Lindsey Graham and Sam Brownback began {{drafting}} a letter asking the President's office {{to turn over}} legal memoranda and briefs Miers had written for Bush, in order to elucidate her views on political matters. Brownback and Graham knew the memos were protected by executive privilege, that <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>was</b> not required to turn them over, and that Miers could refuse to deliver the memos and then ostensibly step down on principle. Miers would later use this request {{as part of a}} face-saving exit strategy for stepping down. In her letter withdrawing her nomination, she pointed to the senators' request for confidential documents as potentially damaging the executive branch's independence.|$|E
25|$|On December 9, 2016, Obama {{ordered the}} U.S. Intelligence Community to {{investigate}} Russian {{interference in the}} election and report before he left office on January 20, 2017.

The intelligence analysis would cover malicious cyberwarfare occurring between the 2008 and 2016 elections. CNN reported that an unnamed senior administration official told them that <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>was</b> confident Russia interfered in the election. The official said the order by President Obama would be a lessons learned report, with options including sanctions and covert cyber response against Russia.|$|E
