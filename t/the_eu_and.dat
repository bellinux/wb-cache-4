Lawyers and human rights activists protested outside parliament until being dispersed by riot police, and the country's Supreme Court judges issued a letter condemning the military's actions.

5|$|From 1993 to 2001, Orban {{served as}} a Parliamentary Counsellor on European and International Affairs within the Chamber of Deputies of the Romanian Parliament, where he was {{responsible}} for the European Integration Committee, as well as relations with the European Parliament. In 1995, the Association Agreement between <b>the</b> <b>EU</b> <b>and</b> Romania came into force and Orban also dealt with the Secretariat of the Joint Parliamentary Committee EU-Romania. Between May 2001 and December 2004, he served as Deputy Chief Negotiator and from December 2004 to December 2006, as Chief Negotiator with <b>the</b> <b>EU</b> <b>and</b> as Secretary of State of the Ministry of European Integration of Romania, directly responsible for coordinating Romania's preparation for accession to the EU, as well as drafting the Treaty of Accession. On 25 April 2005, together with the Romanian president Traian Băsescu, the Romanian prime minister Călin Popescu-Tăriceanu and the Romanian foreign minister Mihai Răzvan Ungureanu, Orban was one of the signatories for Romania on the country's Treaty of Accession in Luxembourg. After the signing of the Treaty, when Romania received the status of the observer in the Council of the European Union and in the Commission's committees, Orban was responsible for coordinating Romania's policies and positions in EU affairs. On 30 October 2006, Orban was nominated as Romania's candidate for the European Commission. From 1 January 2007, Orban became European Commissioner for Multilingualism for Romania in the Barroso commission.

5|$|In {{line with}} its {{traditional}} Western orientation, relations with Europe {{have always been}} a central part of Turkish foreign policy. Turkey {{became one of the first}} members of the Council of Europe in 1949, applied for associate membership of the EEC (predecessor of the European Union) in 1959 and became an associate member in 1963. After decades of political negotiations, Turkey applied for full membership of the EEC in 1987, became an associate member of the Western European Union in 1992, joined the EU Customs Union in 1995 and has been in formal accession negotiations with the EU since 2005. Today, EU membership is considered as a state policy and a strategic target by Turkey. Turkey's support for Northern Cyprus in the Cyprus dispute complicates Turkey's relations with <b>the</b> <b>EU</b> <b>and</b> remains a major stumbling block to the country's EU accession bid.|$|E
5|$|Just as {{the concept}} of the First World came about as a result of World War II, so did the European Union.

This is where the relation between globalization, <b>the</b> <b>EU,</b> <b>and</b> First World countries arises. Especially during the 1990s when the EU focused on economic policies such as the creation and circulation of the Euro, the creation of the European Monetary Institute, and the opening of the European Central Bank.|$|E
