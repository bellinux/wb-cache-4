5|$|The Atlantic puffin is {{a species}} of seabird in the order Charadriiformes. It is in the auk family, Alcidae, which {{includes}} the guillemots, typical auks, murrelets, auklets, puffins and the razorbill. The rhinoceros auklet (Cerorhinca monocerata) and the puffins are closely related, together composing the tribe Fraterculini. The Atlantic puffin is the only species in the genus Fratercula {{to occur in the}} Atlantic Ocean. Two other species are known from the northeast Pacific, the <b>tufted</b> <b>puffin</b> (Fratercula cirrhata) and the horned puffin (Fratercula corniculata), the latter being the closest relative of the Atlantic puffin.|$|E
25|$|The Aleut and Ainu {{people of}} the North Pacific {{traditionally}} hunted <b>tufted</b> <b>puffin</b> for food and feathers. Skins were used to make tough parkas worn feather side in and the silky tufts were sewn into ornamental work. Currently, harvesting of <b>tufted</b> <b>puffin</b> is illegal or discouraged throughout its range.|$|E
25|$|The <b>tufted</b> <b>puffin</b> (Fratercula cirrhata), {{also known}} as crested puffin, is a {{relatively}} abundant medium-sized pelagic seabird in the auk family (Alcidae) found throughout the North Pacific Ocean.|$|E

5000|$|The Aquatic {{building}} {{was created in}} 1985, and is home to black-footed penguins, lined seahorses, mudpuppies, <b>tufted</b> <b>puffins,</b> giant archerfish, and African cichlids ...|$|R
25|$|The {{rhinoceros}} auklet (Cerorhinca monocerata) {{has sometimes}} {{been included in the}} genus Fratercula, and some authors place the <b>tufted</b> <b>puffin</b> in the genus Lunda. The puffins and the rhinoceros auklet are closely related, together composing the subfamily Fraterculini.|$|E
25|$|The island {{supports}} a breeding colony of about 35,000 seabirds, including some 25,000 least auklets and crested auklets. In 1925, the <b>tufted</b> <b>puffin</b> (Fratercula cirrhata), horned puffin (Fratercula radionuclidia), parakeet auklets (Aethia psittacula), and Pallas' murre (Uria lomvia arra) were reported at Fairway Rock, nesting in the crevices of the island's cliffs. A 1960 account reports that Eskimo inhabitants of Little Diomede reported a glaucous gull (Larus hyperboreus) colony on Fairway Rock {{larger than that}} on Little Diomede.|$|E
25|$|Tufted puffins form dense {{breeding}} colonies {{during the}} summer reproductive season from British Columbia, throughout southeastern Alaska and the Aleutian Islands, Kamchatka, the Kuril Islands and throughout the Sea of Okhotsk. While they share some habitat with horned puffins (F. corniculata), {{the range of the}} <b>tufted</b> <b>puffin</b> is generally more eastern. They have been known to nest in small numbers as far south as the northern Channel Islands, off southern California. However, the last confirmed sighting at the Channel Islands occurred in 1997.|$|E
50|$|Marine mammals at the {{aquarium}} include sea otters, California sea lions, and spotted seals. Sea birds {{are represented by}} Humboldt penguins and <b>tufted</b> <b>puffins.</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{spite of}} their {{putative}} importance {{in the evolution of}} certain traits (e. g., nocturnality, coloniality, cliff nesting), the effects of aerial predators on behavior of adult seabirds at colonies have been poorly investigated. We hypothesized that <b>Tufted</b> <b>Puffins</b> (Fratercula cirrhata) respond to danger posed by aerial predators by modifying their behavior to mitigate danger. We observed <b>Tufted</b> <b>Puffins</b> making repeated colony fly-ins and departures and characterized (1) the timing of this behavior, (2) the activity rate (number of birds arriving or departing), and (3) the risk-level of activity, with respect to predation danger posed by Bald Eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) and Peregrine Falcons (Falco peregrinus). As we predicted, we found that <b>Tufted</b> <b>Puffins</b> (1) dilute danger by synchronizing their fly-in and departure activities, (2) reduce fly-in and departure activity rates when predators are present, and (3) switch to lower-risk fly-in activities (e. g., staying over water where they have an escape route from an aerial attack) when predators are present...|$|R
25|$|Juvenile <b>tufted</b> <b>puffins</b> {{resemble}} winter adults, {{but with}} a grey-brown breast shading to white on the belly, and a shallow, yellowish-brown bill. Overall, they resemble a horn-less and unmarked rhinoceros auklet (Cerorhinca monocerata).|$|R
25|$|Seabirds {{spend most}} of their lives at sea and are adapted to ocean life. Some even sleep in the water, though they must all return to land to lay their eggs. Their diets consist mostly of small fish, squid, shellfish, and crustaceans. Species of seabirds on the Oregon Coast include the common murre, <b>tufted</b> <b>puffin,</b> marbled murrelet, the black oystercatcher, auklets, many {{varieties}} of cormorants, the western gull, and glaucous-winged gull. Many seabird species are endemic and found nowhere else.|$|E
25|$|Puffins are any {{of three}} small species of alcids (auks) in the bird genus Fratercula with a brightly {{coloured}} beak during the breeding season. These are pelagic seabirds that feed primarily by diving in the water. They breed in large colonies on coastal cliffs or offshore islands, nesting in crevices among rocks or in burrows in the soil. Two species, the <b>tufted</b> <b>puffin</b> and horned puffin, {{are found in the}} North Pacific Ocean, while the Atlantic puffin is found in the North Atlantic Ocean.|$|E
25|$|The oldest alcid fossil is Hydrotherikornis from Oregon {{dating to}} the Late Eocene while fossils of Aethia and Uria {{go back to the}} Late Miocene. Molecular clocks have been used to suggest an origin in the Pacific in the Paleocene. Fossils from North Carolina were {{originally}} thought to have been of two Fratercula species, but were later reassigned to one Fratercula, the <b>tufted</b> <b>puffin,</b> and a Cerorhinca species. Another extinct species, Dow's puffin (Fratercula dowi) was found on the Channel Islands of California until the Late Pleistocene or early Holocene.|$|E
50|$|Birds and Shores {{consists}} of three separate areas. Northwest Shores is an area which shows birds {{in a variety of}} habitats of the coastal Northwest. Alcids has diving birds such as <b>tufted</b> <b>puffins</b> and common murres. There is also a Shorebird exhibit.|$|R
50|$|The high vault is {{a natural}} resting place for sea birds. Many birds make their home {{at or near the}} Sea Lion Caves such as the pigeon guillemot, Brandt's cormorant, western, herring, and California gulls, <b>tufted</b> <b>puffins,</b> and the {{occasional}} hawk or bald eagle.|$|R
5000|$|Mostly nocturnal, burrow and crevice nesting sea birds {{including}} <b>tufted</b> <b>puffins,</b> fork-tailed storm petrels, and Leach's storm petrels, Cassin's auklets, rhinoceros auklets, double-crested cormorant, Brandt's cormorant, pelagic cormorant and pigeon guillemots avoid predation by the diurnal western gulls {{which also}} breed on the island. [...] April and May are prime months to see <b>tufted</b> <b>puffins</b> on the island. Peregrine falcons used to breed {{on the site}} but have not been documented since the 1940s. [...] U.S. Endangered Species Act protected brown pelicans use the island as a communal roost but do not breed north of Monterey, California. Over 21,000 Aleutian cackling geese roost on the island, flying at dawn to feed on nearby agricultural lands and returning to the island in the evening.|$|R
500|$|The Atlantic puffin (...) , {{also known}} as the common puffin, is a species of seabird in the auk family. It is the only puffin native to the Atlantic Ocean; two related species, the <b>tufted</b> <b>puffin</b> and the horned puffin, are found in the northeastern Pacific. The Atlantic puffin breeds in Iceland, Norway, Greenland, Newfoundland and many North Atlantic islands, and as far south as Maine in the west and the British Isles in the east. Although it has a large {{population}} and a wide range, the species has declined rapidly, at least in parts of its range, resulting in it being rated as vulnerable by the IUCN. On land, it has the typical upright stance of an auk. At sea, it swims on the surface and feeds mainly on small fish, which it catches by diving underwater, using its wings for propulsion.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>tufted</b> <b>puffin</b> is a {{familiar}} bird on the coasts of the Russian Pacific coast, where it is known as toporok (...) [...] meaning [...] "small axe," [...] a hint {{to the shape of}} the bill. Toporok is the namesake of one of its main breeding sites, Kamen Toporkov ("Tufted Puffin Rock") or Ostrov Toporkov ("Tufted Puffin Island"), an islet offshore Bering Island.|$|E
2500|$|Over [...] of tidelands and {{seafloor}} habitat {{were included}} in the proposed aquatic reserve. Not only do these islands provide the necessary habitat for many seabirds such as tufted puffins and marine mammals, but this area also contains the largest kelp beds in all of Puget Sound. In addition, Protection Island reserve has also been off limits to the public to aid marine birds in breeding. Protection Island contains one of the last two nesting colonies of puffins in Puget Sound, and about 70% of the <b>tufted</b> <b>puffin</b> population nests on this island.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tufted</b> <b>puffins</b> {{typically}} select islands or cliffs {{that are}} relatively inaccessible to predators, close to productive waters, and high {{enough that they}} can take to the air successfully. Ideal habitat is steep but with a relatively soft soil substrate and grass {{for the creation of}} burrows.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Tufted</b> <b>puffins</b> {{are around}} [...] in length {{with a similar}} {{wingspan}} and weigh about {{three quarters of a}} kilogram (1.6lbs). [...] Birds from the western Pacific population are somewhat larger than those from the eastern Pacific, and male birds tend to be slightly larger than females.|$|R
50|$|Every year {{millions}} of birds of various species nest on the refuge islands. Birds that nest on these islands include horned puffins, black-legged kittiwakes (which nest on the exposed rock face of cliffs), <b>tufted</b> <b>puffins</b> and various auklets such as Cassin's auklet and the whiskered auklet.|$|R
2500|$|Puffins {{breed in}} colonies on coasts and islands; several {{current or former}} island {{breeding}} sites {{are referred to as}} Puffin Island. The male Atlantic puffin builds the nest and exhibits strong nest-site fidelity. Both sexes of the horned puffin help to construct their nest. Horned puffin burrows are usually about [...] deep, ending in a chamber, while the tunnel leading to a <b>tufted</b> <b>puffin</b> burrow may be up to [...] long. The nesting substrate of the tufted and Atlantic puffins is soft soil, into which tunnels are dug; in contrast the nesting sites of horned puffins are rock crevices on cliffs. The Atlantic puffin burrow is usually lined with material such as grass, leaves and feathers but is occasionally unlined. The eggs of the Atlantic puffin are typically creamy white but the odd egg is tinged lilac.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>tufted</b> <b>puffin</b> {{was first}} {{described}} in 1769 by German zoologist Peter Simon Pallas. The scientific name Fratercula {{comes from the}} Medieval Latin fratercula, friar, {{a reference to the}} black and white plumage which resembles monastic robes. The specific name cirrhata is Latin for [...] "curly-headed", from cirrus, a curl of hair. The vernacular name puffin – puffed in the sense of swollen – was originally applied to the fatty, salted meat of young birds of the unrelated species, the Manx shearwater (Puffinus puffinus), formerly known as the [...] "Manks puffin". It is an Anglo-Norman word (Middle English pophyn or poffin) used for the cured carcasses. The Atlantic puffin acquired the name at a much later stage, possibly because of its similar nesting habits, and it was formally applied to that species by Pennant in 1768. It was later extended to include the similar and related Pacific puffins.|$|E
2500|$|No {{fewer than}} 287 {{species of birds}} have been {{recorded}} on the island. In spring (May through mid-June) and fall (August through October), many rare birds, including Siberian vagrants, may be spotted on the island. [...] The cliffs of Saint Paul, Saint George and Otter Island support large numbers of breeding seabirds, including critical nesting habitat for the very range-restricted red-legged kittiwake. [...] The auk family is well represented here, with horned and <b>tufted</b> <b>puffin,</b> thick-billed and common murre, parakeet, crested and least auklets and ancient murrelet occurring as breeders, and several other species occurring as vagrants or seasonal visitors. [...] Breeding ducks include long-tailed duck, northern pintail, and green-winged teal. [...] Breeding shorebirds include semipalmated plover, the Pribilof subspecies of rock sandpiper, least sandpiper and red-necked phalarope. [...] Breeding landbirds are few, but include insular subspecies of gray-crowned rosy finch and Pacific wren, snow bunting, Lapland longspur, and the occasional hoary or common redpoll, or common raven. [...] Saint Paul Island Tours (part of the TDX Corp.) runs a natural history tourist program to the island of Saint Paul from May through early October, offering interested visitors the chance to explore the avifauna of the island.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tufted</b> <b>puffins</b> {{are around}} 35 cm in length {{with a similar}} {{wingspan}} and weigh about {{three quarters of a}} kilogram (1.6 lbs).

5000|$|The Three Arch Rocks Refuge has {{provided}} protection for Oregon's largest seabird nesting colony {{of more than}} 230,000 birds since October 14, 1907. [...] The entire Oregon Coast National Wildlife Refuge Complex protect over a million nesting seabirds, including common murres, <b>tufted</b> <b>puffins,</b> cormorants, and storm-petrels.|$|R
2500|$|Nunivaarmiut Cup'ig bird {{skin and}} feather parkas are alpacurrlugar (murre skin and feather parka) made from Uria aalge skin with {{feathers}}, cigurat atkut (guillemot skin and feather parka) made from Cepphus columba skin with feathers, alpacurrlugar (auklet skin and feather parka) {{made from the}} white part of the Aethia cristatella skin with feathers, qilangar (puffin skin and feather parka) made from Fratercula corniculata skin with feathers, aarraangiarat (oldsquaw skin and feather parka) made from Clangula hyemalis skin with feathers, metrar (eider skin and feather parka) made from Somateria mollissima skin with feathers, tengaurtet (kittiwake skin and feather parka) made from Rissa tridactyla skin with feathers (used as camouflage for sliding over the ice to sneak up on game). In the Nunivak, seabirds, particularly murres, nest in numbers, the natives paying annual visits to the nesting grounds to secure skins of puffins, murres and others for clothing. The bird skins most commonly used for clothing were those of the cormorant (Phalacrocorax pelagicus), common or Pacific eider (Somateria mollissima), king eider (Somateria mollissima), Steller's eider (Polysticta stelleri), common murre (Uria aalge), horned puffin (Fratercula corniculata). Cormorant and eider were considered more valuable and gave more prestige to the owner. Bird skin parkas are light and comfortable to wear but tear easily. Such parkas were usually reversible, worn with the feathers next to the body in winter with a cloth garment over the parka to cover the rough, yet fragile, skin side. At night the parka was turned and slept in or used as a blanket with the feathers on the outside. Bird skin parkas were shaped like those made of animal skin, {{but because of the}} great thickness of the feathers and the general bulk, they did not have fur strips, beading, and other decoration. Cuffs and bottom borders tended to be plain except on murre parkas. <b>Tufted</b> <b>puffin</b> skins were counted and sold in [...] "knots" [...] or bundles of six. Thirty-four skins were necessary for a man's parka and 28 for a woman's. The common puffin is smaller, so six knots and four extra skins were required for a man's parka, five knots and four extra for a woman's. Puffins are found only along the cliffs near Nash Harbor, and residents of Mekoryuk had to trade for them with those living in the settlement there. Sufficient puffins for a parka could be obtained in exchange for one bearded seal skin. Parkas made of cormorant skins were worn only by women. The skins of these birds are larger than those of murres and puffins. When murre skins were prepared for parka use, they were roughly square in shape and included the breast and the sides. Two narrow black backs were sewn together to form the crown of the hood.|$|E
