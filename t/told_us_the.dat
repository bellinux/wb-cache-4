We usually have Big Jim Wright sit in on those kind of sessions {{to work out the}} chords. he wasn't there so I had to work on the chord myself. So I was playing and there was a part where I said 'Man, what chord am I supposed to do here?' and Mariah has such a good ear that she sang me the chord.|$|E

I {{took her by the}} arm, and said. The Lord hath joined us together, and wo be to them that should part us. I said, I rather chuse to dye there with my friend, than to part from her. He was smitten, and went away, and came no more in five weeks... they did not part us till ten Weeks after: But oh the dark clouds and the sharp showers the Lord did carry us through! Death it self had been better than to have parted in that place.|$|E

500|$|Released on July 20, 1981, {{the album}} was not commercially acclaimed, failing to spawn a single hit. Though Sire Records had merged with Warner Bros. Records, none of the singles from Pleasant Dreams [...] were {{released}} in the US. Sire had insisted that the album be produced by a celebrity producer, hiring Graham Gouldman to the job expecting this to help expand the band's fan-base. Joey relates: [...] "The record company <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>the</b> album would bomb if we didn't use Graham Gouldman, so we worked with Graham--and the album bombed anyway." [...] The album would only chart in the US and Sweden, peaking at fifty-eight on the Billboard 200 and thirty-five on the Sverigetopplistan chart—the singles released from the album failed to chart.|$|E
500|$|After {{the episode}} aired, in the [...] "Inside the Episode" [...] {{featurette}} released by HBO for [...] "The Door", David Benioff and D. B. Weiss {{revealed that the}} closing scene involving Hodor's name origin and subsequent death was an idea that was presented to them directly from George R. R. Martin. Benioff stated, [...] "We had this meeting with George Martin where we're trying {{to get as much}} information as possible out of him, and probably the most shocking revelation he had for us was when he <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>the</b> origin of Hodor and how that name came about. I just remember Dan and I looking at each other when he said that and just being like, 'Holy shit.'" [...] Weiss continued, [...] "It {{was just one of the}} saddest and most affecting things. Even sitting in a hotel room having someone tell you this was going to happen in the abstract in some way and that 'hold the door' was the origin of the name Hodor, we just thought that was a really, really heart-breaking idea." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some British writers, however, {{applauded the}} inquiry. G. K. Chesterton contrasted the American {{objective}} of maximum openness {{with what he}} called Britain's [...] "national evil", which he described as being to [...] "hush everything up; it is to damp everything down; it is to leave the great affair unfinished, to leave every enormous question unanswered." [...] He argued that [...] "it does not much matter whether Senator Smith knows the facts; what matters is whether he is really trying to find them out." [...] The Review of Reviews, whose founder William Stead was among {{the victims of the}} disaster, declared: [...] "We prefer the ignorance of Senator Smith to the knowledge of Mr. Ismay. Experts have <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>the</b> Titanic was unsinkable– we prefer ignorance to such knowledge!" ...|$|E

2500|$|American {{president}} George W. Bush sent American {{troops on}} a humanitarian mission. This was hailed by Georgian president Saakashvili, which labelled the relief operation as a [...] "turning point". Saakashvili assessed the American operation as a defence of Georgian ports and airports, however American officials denied this, with one senior official saying, [...] "We won’t be protecting the airport or seaport, but we’ll certainly protect our assets {{if we need}} to." [...] The first American C-17 Globemaster aircraft arrived in Tbilisi that day and brought humanitarian and medical supplies. Condoleezza Rice and George Bush accused Russia of continued presence in Georgia {{in violation of the}} ceasefire, however Russia claimed its actions complied with the ceasefire. After Bush had announced his support for Georgia, Georgian officials said that Russian began withdrawal from Gori. Russian official estimated that Gori would be returned to Georgians in two days. Saakashvili said, [...] "We have been warning them a large scale Russian invasion is coming. (The) State Department <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>the</b> Russians are not going to do that." [...] Saakashvili denied Russia's claim that Georgia provoked the war and noted he had to cancel his trip to the Olympics because Georgia had either to [...] "respond or to surrender." ...|$|E
