25|$|Metal {{tumbling}} is used <b>to</b> burnish, <b>deburr,</b> clean, radius, de-flash, descale, remove rust, polish, brighten, surface harden, prepare {{parts for}} further finishing, and break off die cast runners. The process is fairly simple: a horizontal barrel {{is filled with}} the parts which is then rotated. Variations of this process usually include media, water, or other lubricants. As the barrel is rotated the material rises until gravity causes the uppermost layer to landslide down to the other side. The barrel may also have vanes, typically made of rubber, which run along the inside of the barrel. As the barrel turns the vanes catch and lift the parts, which eventually slide down or fall.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Abrasive flow {{machining}} is a non-conventional {{machining process}} {{which is used}} <b>to</b> polish, <b>deburr,</b> and radius hard to reach surfaces like intricate geometries and edges by flowing an abrasive laden viscoelastic polymer over them. Conventional methods have limitations for machining such components with complex geometries. In this process, abrasive medium flow inside the crossed holes of a launch vehicle‘s fluid component made of Z 30 C 13 stainless steel. In this study, the effect of process parameters such as abrasive size, abrasive concentration and number of cycles were studied on surface roughness. Taguchi‘s L 9 orthogonal array is preferred with three levels of parameters for experimental design without considering any interaction. The percentage contribution of each factor is found by ANOVA...|$|R
25|$|Mass {{finishing}} is a {{group of}} manufacturing processes that allow large quantities of parts to be simultaneously finished. The goal of this type of finishing is <b>to</b> burnish, <b>deburr,</b> clean, radius, de-flash, descale, remove rust, polish, brighten, surface harden, prepare parts for further finishing, or break off die cast runners. The two main types of mass finishing are tumble finishing, also known as barrel finishing, and vibratory finishing. Both involve the use of a cyclical action to create grinding contact between surfaces. Sometimes the workpieces are finished against each other; however, usually a finishing medium is used. Mass finishing can be performed dry or wet; wet processes have liquid lubricants, cleaners, or abrasives, while dry processes do not. Cycle times can be as short as 10minutes for nonferrous workpieces or as long as 2hours for hardened steel.|$|R

40|$|AbstractSelective Laser Deburring (SLD) is an {{innovative}} edge-refinement process being {{developed at the}} Laser Zentrum Nord (LZN) in Hamburg. It offers a wear-free processing of defined radii and bevels at the edges {{as well as the}} possibility <b>to</b> <b>deburr</b> several materials with the same laser source. Sheet metal parts of various applications need to be post-processed to remove sharp edges and burrs remaining from the initial production process. Thus, SLD will provide an extended degree of automation {{for the next generation of}} manufacturing facilities. This paper investigates the dependence between the deburring result and the temperature field in- and post-process. In order to achieve this, the surface temperature near to the deburred edge is monitored with IR-thermography. Different strategies are discussed for the approach using the IR-information as a quality assurance. Additional experiments are performed to rate the accuracy of the quality prediction method in different deburring applications...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2017 Access {{restricted}} to the Administrator, at author's request, from 2017 - 06 - 26 to 2017 - 12 - 26 Deburring of machined parts is a crucial task in the aerospace and automotive industry. This process is still performed manually {{to a large extent}} due to the unpredictability of burr formation as well as the complex interactions between the human arm and the workpiece. Poor ergonomics, repetitive stress and strain injuries for the human operators, as well as high cost are all reasons to automate this process. In this work, we first study how skilled operators perform deburring, which is a hybrid force and position control task, by using a motion capture system, force sensor and an IMU to record and recreate the process. Next, we explore the interaction dynamics and explain the importance of the dynamic characteristics of a spring-mass system <b>to</b> successfully <b>deburr</b> an edge. We come up with control strategies that allow a backdrivable robot to accomplish the same task using a hybrid controller made up of a sliding mode controller and a proportional controller acting in parallel...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a systematic study of the Cascade Finishing Process with respect to its ability to improve surface finish. Although mainly used <b>to</b> <b>deburr</b> and clean castings and machined parts, the process was able to greatly improve the surface finish under the right operating conditions. Six major topics were investigated: The nature of the surface finish produced, the significance and effects of runtime, vibratory frequency and fixture clearance, the effects of four different media types, the effects of surface orientation, the effects of different initial surface finishes, and the integrity of the surfaces produced, including residual stresses and micro-hardness;Using abrasive media the vibratory action produced directional, matte surfaces with Ra values as fine as. 27 [mu]m Ra. Surfaces perpendicular to the vibratory motion were found to have undergone a peening action with surfaces having initial roughnesses of 6. 7 [mu]m Ra being smoothed to 1. 5 [mu]m under the proper operating conditions. Many profile tracings and micro-photographs of the surfaces produced by the process are included in this paper. Almen strip tests indicate that the peening action observed is less intense than standard shot peening. Run time, vibratory frequency, media type, initial surface roughness and surface orientation were all found to be major factors governing the process. Empirical models and main effect plots resulting from the experiments are also included...|$|E
40|$|Finishing operations, which {{presently}} {{account for}} approximately 15 % {{of the total}} machining costs, {{have been identified as}} the single greatest hurdle remaining in fully automating the production of precision components. A new process called Abrasive Flow Machining (AFM) offers the possibility of effective automation needed by the manufacturing community. AFM is a nontraditional finishing process that is used <b>to</b> <b>deburr,</b> polish, and radius workpieces by flowing an abrasive-laden viscoelastic compound across the surface to be machined. ^ Due to the complex and random nature of AFM, deterministic and stochastic analysis techniques are needed to understand the process and to find a quantitative measure of the metal removal mechanism which can be integrated with an on-line control strategy. Therefore, this dissertation presents research on the following specific topics related to the AFM process: metal removal and surface roughness characteristics per cycle for a single hole part, machining of multiple hole components, prediction of metal removal and flow rate in AFM using an acoustic emission monitoring system, and stochastic modeling and analysis of AFM surface roughness profiles and acoustic emission signal data. ^ In studying the machining characteristics per cycle, the largest change in bore diameter and surface roughness always occurred from the raw workpiece to the first AFM cycle. A better starting surface roughness was associated with a better final roughness value. ^ A velocity distribution of the abrasive-laden media was proposed for a multiple hole component. Experimental results showed that the center hole had, on average, 30 % more metal removal as compared to the outer holes. The effect of media temperature on flow rate also helped to clarify the results. ^ An AFM monitoring system using acoustic emission (AE) technology was designed, built and tested. Relationships were proposed between the acoustic emission level and the AFM process parameters. It was shown that metal removal in AFM could be fairly accurately predicted knowing the RMS of the AE signal and the levels of the machining parameters. A high correlation was found between AFM flow rate and AE RMS over certain ranges. Data Dependent Systems (DDS) analysis of the acoustic emission signals revealed distinct frequency bands during AFM that were linked to the process mechanisms. Good agreement was found between DDS frequency decomposition and the results of a spectral analysis option on the new data acquisition system. ...|$|E
40|$|Extrusion honing is a {{technique}} used for the finish machining of engineering components. The process may be used <b>to</b> <b>deburr,</b> radius or polish depending on the specific application. Extrusion honing utilises a polyborosiloxane polymer, which is mixed with fine abrasive particles and forced through or around components using an extrusion honing machine to achieve the machining action. It is evident that the machining process is very dependent upon the physical and mechanical characteristics of the polyborosiloxane. However, the process to date has largely been developed empirically, and further developments will require {{a greater understanding of}} the relationship between the characteristics of the polymer and the machining action. The rheology of the C- 11 polyborosiloxane has been investigated using a concentric cylinder, a slit-die and a capillary rheometer. The shear history of the polyborosiloxane prior to testing with the capillary rheometer was found to significantly affect the results produced. At shear strain rates up to 100 s- 1 and a temperature of 30 °C the rheology of the polyborosiloxane has been approximated to a power law equation (K. = 989 KPas; n= 0. 935). At shear strain rates greater than 100 s- 1 the pseudoplasticity of the polyborosiloxane increases significantly. Using this power law equation the velocity, shear strain rate and the shear stress within the polyborosiloxane in an extrusion die has been modelled mathematically. In some cases the extrusion barrel pressure and the mass flow rate through the extrusion die have both been shown to vary considerably during the constant ram velocity extrusion of polyborosiloxane in the capillary rheometer. It is tentatively proposed that such variations in the extrusion barrel pressure during capillary flow are a result of periodic slipping and sticking of the polyborosiloxane to the extrusion die wall. This mechanism is thought to be considerably influenced by the polyborosiloxane temperature, the extrusion ram velocity and the flow passage geometry. It is proposed that the measured variations in the mass flow rate of the polyborosiloxane through the extrusion dies are a result of pressure induced density variations within the extrusion barrel. This mechanism has been mathematically modelled. Temperature profiles within the C- 11 polyborosiloxane have been measured on an extrusion honing machine and the results suggest significant heat generation towards the periphery of the restriction. These results have been used to model mathematically the heat generation and transfer within the polyborosiloxane during operation of the extrusion honing machine. It is proposed that heat generation during extrusion honing is by friction at the medium/workpiece interface and internal shear within the medium. Both of these mechanisms would cause the greatest heat generation towards the periphery of an orifice restriction...|$|E
40|$|Vibrations from {{hand-held}} machinery are a {{major problem}} in the Swedish labour force. In 2009, 14 % of men and 3 % of women of employed in Sweden reported exposure to hand-arm vibration at least a quarter of their working time according to the Swedish Work Environment Authority (Arbetsmiljöverket 2010). It is tempting to imagine a protective glove that could reduce or even eliminate this problem. This report from the Department of Occupational and Environmental Medicine in Lund and Gothenburg describes how anti-vibration gloves (AVGs) are experienced, and how they work and affect the exposure from hand-held machines. Generally, all protective equipment disrupts work {{to a greater or lesser}} degree. Working without a helmet, protective mask, hearing protection, and protective clothing is preferred in most situations. Furthermore, the availability of gloves which are supposedly AV may give rise to an ethical dilemma: the user may handle the machines more intensely and for a longer time in the belief that the hand is protected from vibration damage. But are those AV claims true and how do these gloves perform in practice? Is the experience regarding the gloves that they dampen the vibrations? To what extent do the gloves disturb the worker and interfere with the work? How much damping can be expected when using low-speed and high-speed grinders, respectively? These issues will be discussed in the following report. Nine subjects, whose work task was <b>to</b> <b>deburr</b> and grind aircraft engine components, were given the opportunity to test a specific AVG for 3 months. They all worked with a variety of rotating air-powered and vibrating machines. Only one model of AVG was tested. The glove was CE-marked and was claimed to comply with standard ISO 10819 : 1996. The test subjects tried the glove for 3 months. After this period, they answered a questionnaire containing 14 questions including questions on hand temperature, grip, dexterity and self-reported vibration damping. To assess the usefulness of the AVG, the vibration level and vibration frequency spectrum were measured on the machines used by the subjects. During the measurements, a skilled operator performed a typical deburring task. The vibrations from many of the machines in this study, which are used over long periods for deburring, will be damped to some extent. But it is not obvious that this damping neither can be experienced, nor give reduced daily vibration exposure in accordance with the regulations, or reduce the risk of vibration injury in the hands. So-called “AVGs” generally give insufficient reduction in vibration exposure. This is demonstrated already by the standard for CE certification of AVGs. For a glove to protect against normal, low-frequency vibrations, it would have to be too heavy and thick to be practical. Despite the limitations of the protection that the CE-marked protective gloves offer against vibrations, we still recommend the use of gloves because: 1. High-frequency vibrations, which are presumed to be harmful, will be damped. 2. The gloves will ensure that vibrations will not be amplified. 3.

40|$|Are {{anti-vibration}} gloves {{the solution to}} the problem of hand-arm vibration?Vibrations from hand-held machinery are a major problem in the Swedish labour force. In 2009, 14 % of men and 3 % of women of employed in Sweden reported exposure to hand-arm vibration at least a quarter of their working time according to the Swedish Work Environment Authority (Arbetsmiljöverket 2010). It is tempting to imagine a protective glove that could reduce or even eliminate this problem. Research can validate the quality of labour protection gear available on the market and then make recommendations and suggestions for improvements. This report from the Department of Occupational and Environmental Medicine in Lund and Gothenburg describes how {{anti-vibration gloves}} (AVGs) are experienced, and how they work and affect the exposure from hand-held machines. BackgroundToday, gloves labelled “anti-vibration” (AV) are advertised as “reducing vibration by 40 %”. To be marketed as “AVG”, a glove must be CE-certified and thereby comply with the requirements of International Organization for Standardization standard ISO 10819. The requirements apply only to the suppression of vibration in the palm of the hand, while in many work situations, vibration is transmitted to the fingers. However, in the ISO standard it is pointed out that AVGs provide inadequate damping of vibrations of low frequencies. Such vibrations are common in many hand-held tools and machines in industry and crafts, such as different types of grinders. Some regular protective gloves can even provide amplification of low frequencies but cannot be approved in accordance with this standard. Generally, all protective equipment disrupts work to a greater or lesser degree. Working without a helmet, protective mask, hearing protection and protective clothing is preferred in most situations. Furthermore, the availability of gloves which are supposedly AV may give rise to an ethical dilemma: the user may handle the machines more intensely and for a longer time in the belief that the hand is protected from vibration damage. But are those AV claims true and how do these gloves perform in practice? Is the experience regarding the gloves that they dampen the vibrations? To what extent do the gloves disturb the worker and interfere with the work? How much damping can be expected when using low-speed and high-speed grinders, respectively? These issues will be discussed in the following report. ImplementationNine subjects, whose work task was <b>to</b> <b>deburr</b> and grind aircraft engine components, were given the opportunity to test a specific AVG for 3 months. They all worked with a variety of rotating air-powered and vibrating machines. All had extensive experience in this work. Usage times for the individual machines varied between ½ hour and 4 hours/day. The total usage times sometimes exceeded 4 hours/day. The most commonly used rotating machines rotate at high speeds, 100 000 revolutions per minute (rpm), but other machines with low speed, 500 rpm, were also used. Only one model of AVG was tested. The back of the glove was made of porous polyester and the palm of a denser, elastic synthetic material. Approximately 7 mm thick, foam-like materials were built into the palm, thumb and fingers grip side of the glove. The glove was CE-marked and was claimed to comply with standard ISO 10819 : 1996. The test subjects tried the glove for 3 months. After this period they answered a questionnaire containing 14 questions including questions on hand temperature, grip, dexterity and self-reported vibration damping. To assess the usefulness of the AVG, the vibration level and vibration frequency spectrum were measured on the machines used by the subjects. During the measurements a skilled operator performed a typical deburring task. Results and DiscussionThe comfort in terms of hand temperature was rated mediocre. Grip was rated good while finger sensitivity was rated low. At a so-called “pencil grip”, required for handling small machinery, the gloves were uncomfortable; however, they worked well with larger machines. The majority, eight of the nine individuals, responded that the glove offered good vibration damping. As the hand’s ability to perceive vibrations varies with the frequency of vibration the possibility to self-assess whether a glove is vibration-damping or not largely depends on how well the person can perceive the frequency of the machine in question. With a high-revving machine of, say, 50 000 rpm, the vibration tactility is fairly low, and so is therefore the ability to self-assess the glove’s damping properties. In addition, the vibratory sense in the hand does not reflect the hand-arm weighted vibration level which needs to be measured according to the Swedish Work Environment Authority’s regulations (AFS 2005 : 15). With regard to the vibrations, large differences between the various machines were measured; hand-arm weighted levels according to the regulations were between 0. 8 and 8. 3 m/s 2. High-revving, ≥ 55 000 rpm, machines gave the lowest weighted vibration levels. A machine’s rotation speed was found to cause the dominant vibration frequency; however, high frequencies from high-speed machines do not increase the hand-arm weighted exposure levels. ConclusionThe vibrations from many of the machines in this study, which are used over long periods for deburring, will be damped to some extent. But it is not obvious that this damping neither can be experienced, nor give reduced daily vibration exposure in accordance with the regulations, or reduce the risk of vibration injury in the hands.
