40|$|The {{earthquake}} {{behavior of}} structures with supplemental copper dampers is evaluated in this study. The investigation {{is divided into}} two parts: (i) an experimental work with seven pairs of hourglass copper dampers of dierent aspect ratios and side proles; and (ii) a parametric study of 6 -, 12 -, and 25 -story planar structures with elastic as well as inelastic behavior in the primary structure and copper dampers. The copper used in this study is electrolytic <b>tough</b> <b>pitch</b> (ETP) <b>copper</b> C 11000; probably the most commonly used of all coppers; ductile, with a low-yield, and highly resistant to corrosion. Experimental results demonstrate that all copper plates reached stable angular distortions of the order of = 25 %, which implies transverse distortions in the devices larger than 40 mm. The behavior of the devices is highly dependent on the aspect ratio of the plate, h=t, and a recommendation is made to use plates in the range 116 h=t 618. Plates beyond this range exhibit either large stress and strain concentrations in the neck of the device or a strong inuence of axial deformations in their cyclic behavior. The inelastic earthquake response of structures with such devices shows that drift reduction factors of the order of 30 to 40 % can be achieved with reasonably economic designs. It is also shown that the eciency of these devices depends on the soil conditions and exibility of the primary structure. Finally, it is concluded that supplemental copper dampers are a good alternative for drift reduction {{in a wide range of}} structural layouts, ranging from coupled shear-wall systems to moment-resisting frames, and for impulsive as well as non-impulsive ground motions.

40|$|Samples of {{electrolytic}} <b>tough</b> <b>pitch</b> (ETP) pure <b>copper</b> {{were subjected}} to 12 passes of Equal-Channel Angular Pressing (ECAP) at room temperature with and without back pressure. Subsequent annealing was performed to evaluate the influence of back pressure during ECAP on the thermal behavior of ultrafine-grained copper. The microstructural and hardness changes caused by annealing were characterized by orientation imaging microscopy (OIM) and microhardness measurements. The application of back pressure resulted in an earlier drop in hardness upon annealing, which {{is believed to be}} associated with a lower critical temperature for the initiation of recrystallization and a rapid coarsening of microstructure. Regardless of whether back pressure was applied or not, structure coarsening during short-time annealing of ECAP-processed copper was governed by discontinuous static recrystallization. This is seen as a result of microstructure heterogeneity. Analysis of recrystallization kinetics was carried out based on observations of the microstructure after annealing in terms of the Avrami equation. The magnitude of the apparent activation energies for recrystallization in the absence of back pressure {{and in the case of}} back pressure of 100 MPa was estimated to be ~ 99 kJ/mol and ~ 91 kJ/mol, respectively.

Since the fiber disappears first during annealing, the static recrystallization has been followed “in situ ” by measurements of the diffracted intensity evolution {{in the center of the}} { 111 } pole figure.

40|$|Atmospheric {{corrosion}} tests, {{according to}} ASTM G 50, {{have been carried}} out in Queensland, Australia, at three different sites representing three different environmental conditions. A range of materials including primary copper (electrosheet) and electrolytic <b>tough</b> <b>pitch</b> (traditional cold rolled) copper have been exposed. Data is available for five exposure periods over a three year time span. X-Ray Diffraction has been used to determine the composition of the corrosion products. Corrosion rates have been determined for each material at each of the exposure sites and are compared with corrosion rates obtained from other long term atmospheric corrosion test programs. Primary copper sheet (electrosheet) behaves like traditionally produced cold rolled copper (C 11000) sheet but with an increased corrosion rate. This difference between the rolled copper samples and the primary copper samples is probably due to a combination of factors related to the difference in crystallographic texture of the underlying copper, the morphology and texture of the cuprite layer, the surface roughness of the sheets, and the differences in mass. These factors combine together to provide an increased oxidation rate and TOW for the electrosheet material and which is significantly higher at the more tropical sites. For a sulfate environment (Urban) the initial corrosion product is cuprite with posnjakite and brochantite also occurring at longer exposures. Posnjakite is either washed away or converted to brochantite during further exposure. The amount of brochantite increases with exposure time and forms the blue-green patina layer.
