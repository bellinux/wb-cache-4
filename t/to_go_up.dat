5|$|On the West German side, {{there were}} no fortifications of any kind, nor even any patrol roads in most areas. Warning signs (Grenzschilder) with {{messages}} such as Achtung! Zonengrenze! ("Danger! Zonal border!") or Halt! Hier Zonengrenze ("Stop! Zonal border here") notified visitors. Foreign military personnel were restricted from approaching the border to avoid clashes or other unwanted incidents. Signs in English and German provided notifications of {{the distance to the}} border to prevent accidental crossings. No such restriction applied to Western civilians, who were free <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>up</b> to the border line, and {{there were no}} physical obstacles to stop their crossing it.|$|E

5|$|Trump's October 12, 2017 {{executive}} order and a related action {{the same day}} ending federal subsidies of questionable legality used to help those buying insurance through exchanges with their co-payments and deductibles. About 6 million people were helped {{at a cost of}} $7 billion a year but that amount was expected to double in 10 years. State officials claimed the action caused insurance premiums <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>up</b> dramatically. Many states sued in federal court on the grounds that Trump was not legally allowed to take the action.|$|E

5|$|A further {{example of}} an {{executive}} decision invalidated by improper purpose {{can be seen from}} Congreve v. Home Office (1976). In that case, the Home Secretary, who had the power to revoke television licences, purported to revoke the licences of people who had pre-empted a rise in licence fees by buying a licence at the old rate before the date when the fees were due <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>up,</b> even though their old licences had not yet expired. The court held that this was an improper exercise of the Home Secretary's discretionary powers. His power to revoke could not be used to raise revenue, and therefore this power had been used for the wrong purpose.|$|E
5|$|Before 5,000 fans at Birmingham's Lakeview Park, Alabama {{lost to the}} Agricultural & Mechanical College of Alabama (now {{known as}} Auburn University) 32–22 {{in the first of}} what was {{subsequently}} dubbed the Iron Bowl. Auburn scored first on a 20-yard Rufus Dorsey touchdown run and again on a one-yard Dorsey run and took an 8–0 lead early in the first half. Frank Savage then scored Alabama's first touchdown on a 10-yard run and William B. Bankhead converted a successful extra point to cut the Auburn lead to 8–6. After Auburn scored a third touchdown <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>up</b> 14–6, Alabama responded with a 20-yard Dan Smith touchdown run and G. H. Kyser extra point to make the halftime score 14–12 in favor of Auburn.|$|E
5|$|Fighters Uncaged is a {{fighting}} video {{game for the}} Xbox 360 Kinect system. It was developed by AMA Studios and published by Ubisoft in November 2010. Fighters Uncaged {{was one of the}} first twelve games released for the Kinect. The game has the player control Simon, a man who is attempting to win an illegal fighting tournament to help get his father out of trouble with a crime lord. It has one game mode and features many different fighting moves and different settings and opponents. Simon is able <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>up</b> in leagues by obtaining certain numbers of points, which in turn unlock more scenarios and opponents. Following its release, Zuffa filed a lawsuit against Ubisoft for the usage of a trademarked term. Fighters Uncaged received poor reviews from critics, with many criticizing the tutorial and visuals, and citing its motion control system as the biggest issue they had with the game, which many considered to be broken.|$|E

5|$|Nebraska {{received}} {{the ball to}} start the game but Maurice Purify fumbled on the first play from scrimmage. Oklahoma recovered the ball at the Nebraska 2-yard-line and scored a touchdown {{to take the lead}} 70 with 48seconds expired off the clock. It was the fastest score in Big12 Championship Game history. With 5:35 left in the first quarter, Oklahoma's quarterback completed a touchdown pass to Malcolm Kelly <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>up</b> 140. With 4:37 left in the first half, Nebraska's Zach Taylor threw a touchdown pass and the extra point shaved Oklahoma's lead to 147, which was still the score as the game went to half-time.|$|E
5|$|Opposition to the {{railroad}} line returning to service included {{that it would}} be as much of a problem to downtown traffic as the container trucks and that the noise would be a disturbance to nearby residents. As with before, however, trains are occasional and reserved for specialty loads, such as oversized loads and hazardous materials, which will be banned from the tunnel. It was also stated that the trains, which will be able <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>up</b> to 30mph on the newly renovated line versus the old limit of 5mph, will be able to cross Biscayne Boulevard in 90 seconds. The current plan is for the line to be strictly for intermodal services, with the project including a rail yard and station at the port, however, in the future a passenger station may be added.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{their return}} on Oct 24, 1871, Hall {{suddenly}} fell ill after drinking {{a cup of}} coffee. His symptoms started with an upset stomach, then progressed to vomiting and delirium the following day. Hall accused several of the ship's company, including Bessels, of having poisoned him. Following these accusations, he refused medical treatment from Bessels, and drank only liquids delivered directly by his Inuit friend Tookoolito. He seemed to improve for a few days, and was even able <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>up</b> on deck. Bessels had prevailed upon Bryan, the ship's chaplain, to convince Hall to allow the doctor to see him. By November 4, Hall relented, and Bessels resumed treatment. Shortly after, Hall's condition began to deteriorate, and he suffered vomiting and delirium, and collapsed. Bessels diagnosed apoplexy, and Hall finally died on November 8. He was taken ashore and given a formal burial.|$|E

5|$|When Kosovo {{was under}} the {{administration}} of the United Nations, the UN flag was flown in Kosovo. However, the flag used by the Kosovar Albanian population was the Albanian flag. The Albanian flag was also used on public buildings, even though it was against UN regulations. Regulations stated only the UN flag and other authorised flags, like those of cities, could fly on public buildings. If the Albanian flag did have <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>up,</b> then the Serbian flag must go up too, according to UN regulations. However, this was never done in practice and the flag of Albania was ever-present in Kosovo during the UNMIK period.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland {{lost its}} {{first game of}} the season to the Dons, 13–10. The Browns opened the scoring with a Groza field goal in the first quarter {{followed}} by a touchdown run from Motley, his sixth of the season, <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>up</b> 10–0. Los Angeles, however, scored a touchdown in the second quarter to come within three points of the Browns. Dons kicker Ben Agajanian then kicked field goals in the third and fourth quarters to win the game. The final field goal came in the closing seconds of the game after the Dons reached the Browns' 28-yard line. Agajanian missed on his first attempt, but Cleveland were penalized five yards for having 12 men on the field. Agajanian made his second attempt, giving Los Angeles the victory. Cleveland was hurt by three fumbles that set up scores, including the winning field goal. Lavelli suffered bruises to his ribs during the game, and center Mike Scarry had an ankle injury. The loss put the Browns in a virtual tie with the 49ers at 5–1 – the 49ers had the same record, but with an additional tie.|$|E
5|$|Qiao Weiyue {{also built}} five double slipways (lit. dams) between Anbei and Huaishi (or, the quays on the Huai waterfront). Each of these had ten lanes for the barges <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>up</b> and down. Their cargoes of {{imperial}} tax-grain were heavy, {{and as they}} were passing over they often came to grief and were damaged or wrecked, with loss of the grain and peculation by a cabal of the workers in league with local bandits hidden nearby. Qiao Weiyue therefore first ordered the construction of two gates at the third dam along the West River (near Huaiyin). The distance between the two gates was rather more than 50 paces (250ft) and the whole space was covered over with a great roof like a shed. The gates were 'hanging gates'; (when they were closed) the water accumulated like a tide until the required level was reached, {{and then when the}} time came it was allowed to flow out. He also built a horizontal bridge to protect their foundations. After this was done (to all the double slipways) the previous corruption was completely eliminated, and the passage of the boats went on without the slightest impediment.|$|E

5|$|The {{approach}} to Battle Mountain and P'il-bong {{was much more}} difficult from the east, the American-held side, than from the west, the North Korean side. On the east side there was no road climbing halfway to the top; {{from the base of}} the mountain at the edge of the Haman valley the only way to make the ascent was by foot trail. Climbers took two to three hours to reach the top of P'il-bong from the reservoir area, and required from three to four hours to get on top of Battle Mountain from the valley floor. The turnaround time for supply trains to Battle Mountain was six hours. Often a dispatch runner required eight hours <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>up</b> Battle Mountain and come back down. In some places the trail was so steep that climbers had to set up ropes to hold along the side of the trail. North Korean night patrols constantly cut telephone lines. The wire men had a difficult and dangerous job trying to maintain wire communication with units on the mountain. Food, water and ammunition were frequently short for the units at the tops of the peaks.|$|E
5|$|On Penn State's {{first play}} from {{scrimmage}} {{in the second}} half, Zach Zwinak fumbled, and it was returned for a touchdown by Frank Clark to pull within four points. After another Penn State drive stalled, Michigan drove down the field, and {{was faced with a}} third-and-short before a freshman offensive lineman committed a dead ball unsportsmanlike conduct penalty to back up Michigan to face a third and long; on that play Olaniyan recorded his third sack of the day, and Michigan punted. On Penn State's ensuing drive, they turned the ball over again, this time via a Hackenberg interception; Michigan capitalized by kicking a field goal. When Penn State got the ball back, they ran a sustained, balanced drive (4 run plays, 5 pass plays, 50 yards) down the field during which they went to Bill Belton in the running game (as Zwinak had fumbled previously in the half) that culminated with Sam Ficken kicking a 45-yard field goal <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>up</b> by 4 points. Michigan promptly drove right back down the field, and Gardner threw a touchdown pass to Jeremy Gallon to take the lead for the second time, 27–24. In the fourth quarter, Ficken attempted a 47-yard field goal, but missed, and Penn State's 10-play 45-yard drive came up empty. Michigan took advantage of their ensuing field position and ran a quick drive that ended with a 37-yard touchdown pass from Gardner to Funchess, putting them on top by 10 with 10:28 to go. On Penn State's ensuing drive, they converted a fourth down and one near midfield prior to a penalty and then a sack setting up a third and long on which Hackenberg threw an incomplete pass, so they were forced to settle with pulling within 7; Sam Ficken kicked a 43-yard field goal. Michigan tried to run out the clock on their next drive, and Penn State burned all three of their timeouts. Though they were at one point within field goal range, they committed a five-yard delay of game penalty that pushed them out of range, and they had to punt. Penn State got the ball with 50 seconds left and no timeouts at their own 20-yard line. Needing a touchdown to tie the game, Penn State's first play of scrimmage was a pass from Hackenberg to Robinson along the sideline that was ruled incomplete on the field, but was reviewed and overturned and counted as a 14-yard gain. The next play was an acrobatic catch by Felder for 29 yards, and then a pass down the sideline to Robinson for 36 yards to put the ball inside the one yard line with 29 seconds remaining. Michigan then called their final timeout. Hackenberg then attempted a quarterback sneak over the right side for a touchdown; the play was reviewed and the call was confirmed, and Ficken made the extra point to tie the game with 27 seconds left. Michigan took the ball at their own 35, drove it to the other 35, and lined Gibbons up to attempt a 52-yard field goal, which he missed short. Penn State got the ball with two seconds left, but downed the ball to send the game into overtime.|$|E
5|$|UCF got {{the ball}} to start the game at their nine-yard line after a penalty on the kickoff return, and their junior quarterback Blake Bortles orchestrated an {{efficient}} drive in which he converted two third downs and was 6/7 passing for 65 yards and a 4-yard touchdown pass to Storm Johnson. Penn State took over and got two first downs, the latter of which as a fourth down conversion, before a 44-yard pass to Allen Robinson immediately followed by a 6-yard touchdown run by Zach Zwinak to tie the game. Penn State moved the ball on their next drive, but ultimately turned the ball over on downs giving UCF good field position, with which they ran a two play drive culminating with a 58-yard touchdown run by Johnson to make it 14–7 UCF. Penn State's special teams responded with a 44-yard kickoff return by Geno Lewis, but their offense went three-and-out, and though they punted the ball deep into UCF territory, the Knights marched down the field with a strong running game and scored another touchdown <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>up</b> 21–7. On Penn State's ensuing drive, Sam Ficken kicked a career-long 47-yard field goal. UCF got some decent yardage on their next drive, but Bortles threw his first interception since October 27, 2012 with 1:17 in the half, but they ran down the clock and Ficken missed his first field goal attempt of the season, a 57-yard try as time expired. At the half, UCF had 290 total yards including 170 rushing yards, compared to 220 total yards for Penn State with only 89 rushing yards. Penn State {{got the ball}} to start the second half, but punted on their first drive. UCF responded with a touchdown via a 25-yard pass. Penn State came right back with a touchdown of their own. UCF's ensuing drive {{brought them to the}} one yard line, but Penn State held them to a field goal, making the score 31–17. Zwinak rushed for his third touchdown of the game on Penn State's next drive, and Shawn Moffitt kicked his second field goal of the game. Penn State drove 51 yards on their next drive before Zwinak lost a fumble with 5:43 remaining in the game. UCF went three-and-out, and on their punt, the snap went over the punter's head, and Penn State got the ball at the UCF 25. Penn State took advantage, scoring on a 5-yard touchdown pass to Allen Robinson with 57 seconds left. Penn State needed to regain possession of the ball after the score, and failed to do so, so ultimately UCF held on to win by three.|$|E
