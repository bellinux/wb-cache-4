40|$|Triage is {{the formal}} nursing {{assessment}} of all patients who present to an Emergency Department (ED). The National Triage Scale (NTS) {{is used in}} most Australian EDs. Triage decision making involves the allocation of every patient presenting to an ED {{to one of the}} five NTS categories. The NTS directly relates a <b>triage</b> <b>category</b> to illness or injury severity and need for emergency care. Triage nurses’ decisions not only have the potential to impact on the health outcomes of ED patients, they are also used, in part, to evaluate ED performance and allocate components of ED funding. This study was a correlational study that used survey methods. Triage decisions were classified as ‘expected triage’, ‘overtriage’ or ‘undertriage’ decisions. Participant’s qualifications were allocated to five categories: ‘nil’; ‘emergency nursing’; ‘critical care nursing’; ‘midwifery’; and ‘tertiary’ qualifications. There was no correlation between triage decisions and length of experience in emergency nursing or triage. ‘Expected triage’ decisions were more common when the predicted <b>triage</b> <b>category</b> was Category 3 (P < 0. 001) and ‘overtriage’ decisions were less common when the predicted <b>triage</b> <b>category</b> was Category 2 (P < 0. 0010). The frequency of ‘undertriage’ decisions decreased significantly when the predicted <b>triage</b> <b>category</b> was Category 3 (P < 0. 001) or Category 4 (P < 0. 001). There was no correlation between triage decisions and qualifications in the ‘nil’, ‘emergency nursing’ or ‘critical care nursing’ categories. A midwifery qualification demonstrated a positive correlation with ‘expected triage’ decisions (P = 0. 048) and a negative correlation with ‘undertriage’ decisions (P = 0. 012).

40|$|Since the {{introduction}} of the Australasian Triage Scale (ATS) there has been considerable variation in its application. Improved uniformity in the application of the ATS by triage nurses is required. A reproducible, reliable and valid method to classify the illness acuity of Emergency Department patients so that a <b>triage</b> <b>category</b> 3 by one nurse means the same as a <b>triage</b> <b>category</b> 3 by another, not only in the same ED but also in another institution would be of considerable value to emergency nurses.

40|$|Background. Triage in the {{emergency}} department (ED) is necessary to prioritise management according to the severity of a patient’s condition.

40|$|Patients {{who fail}} to wait for medical {{assessment}} in the emergency department (ED) have been {{referred to in the}} international literature as "did not wait" (DNW) or "left without being seen" (LWBS) patients or, indeed, simply as "walkouts". This is taken as a performance indicator internationally. In common with many countries, Ireland has very considerable problems in the delivery of ED care due largely to inadequate resources and the inappropriate use of EDs as holding bays for admitted patients. This is the first study of this size to profile the DNW phenomenon in Ireland. The charts of DNW patients were identified and the DNW status was entered into the ED computer record. Data concerning age, sex, time of arrival, date of arrival, <b>triage</b> <b>category</b> and presenting complaint were recorded. In the study period there were 11 662 patient attendances, of whom 871 patients (7. 47 %) did not wait for assessment. <b>Triage</b> <b>category</b> was highly statistically significant, with those in the lowest <b>triage</b> <b>category</b> having the highest numbers not waiting to be seen (p< 0. 001). Those attending at night (p< 0. 001) and at the weekend (p = 0. 03) were most likely to leave without being assessed.

40|$|Introduction Emergency {{departments}} see {{an increase}} in cases during cyclones. The {{aim of this study}} is to describe patient presentations to the Emergency Department (ED) of a tertiary level hospital (Townsville) following a tropical cyclone (Yasi). Specific areas of focus include changes in: patient demographics (age and gender), <b>triage</b> <b>categories,</b> and classification of diseases. Methods Data were extracted from the Townsville Hospitals ED information system (EDIS) for three periods in 2009, 2010 and 2011 to coincide with formation of Cyclone Yasi (31 January 2011) to six days after Yasi crossed the coast line (8 February 2012). The analysis explored the changes in ICD 10 -AM 4 -character classification and presented at the Chapter level. Results There was a marked increase in the number of patients attending the ED during Yasi, particularly those aged over 65 years with a maximum daily attendance of 372 patients on 4 Feb 2011. The most marked increases were in: <b>Triage</b> <b>categories</b> - 4 and 5; and ICD categories - diseases of the skin and subcutaneous tissue (L 00 -L 99), and factors influencing health care status (Z 00 -Z 99). The most common diagnostic presentation across all years was injury (S 00 -T 98). Discussion There was {{an increase in}} presentations to the ED of TTH, which peaked in the first 24 – 48 hours following the cyclone and returned to normal over a five-day period.

40|$|Background - Patients {{attending}} {{hospital emergency}} departments (ED) commonly cite the urgency {{and severity of}} their condition as {{the main reason for}} choosing the ED. However, the patients’ perception of urgency and severity may be different to the nurses’ perception of their urgency and severity, which is underpinned by their professional experience, knowledge, training and skills. This discordance may be a cause of patient dissatisfaction. The {{purpose of this study is}} to understand the extent of agreement/disagreement between the patient’s perceived priority and actual <b>triage</b> <b>category</b> and associated factors. Methods - A cross-sectional survey of 417 patients attending eight public hospital EDs in Queensland, Australia between March and May 2011 was conducted. The survey included patient’s perceived priority and other health- related, socio-demographic and perceptual factors.

40|$|Aims. The aim of {{this study}} was to improve the {{emergency}} nursing care of acute stroke by enhancing the use of evidence regarding prevention of early complications. Background. Preventing complications in the first 24 – 48 hours decreases stroke-related mortality. Many patients spend considerable part of the first 24 hours following stroke in the Emergency Department therefore emergency nurses play a key role in patient outcomes following stroke. Design. A pre-test/post-test design was used and the study intervention was a guideline for Emergency Department nursing management of acute stroke. Methods. The following outcomes were measured before and after guideline implementation: <b>triage</b> <b>category,</b> waiting time, Emergency Department length of stay, time to specialist assessment, assessment and monitoring of vital signs, temperature and blood glucose and venous-thromboembolism and pressure injury risk assessment and interventions. Results. There was significant improvement in triage decisions (21 Æ 4 % increase in <b>triage</b> <b>category</b> 2, p = 0 Æ 009; 15 Æ 6 % decrease in <b>triage</b> <b>category</b> 4, p = 0 Æ 048). Frequency of assessments of respiratory rate (p = 0 Æ 009), heart rate (p = 0 Æ 022), blood pressure (p = 0 Æ 032) and oxygen saturation (p = 0 Æ 001) increased. In terms of risk management, documentation of pressure area interventions increased by 28 Æ 8 % (p = 0 Æ 006), documentation of nil orally status increased by 13 Æ 8 % (ns), swallow assessment prior to oral intake increased by 41 Æ 3 % (p = 0 Æ 003), speech pathology assessment in Emergency Department increased by 6 Æ 1 % (ns) and there was 93 Æ 5 minute decrease in time to speech pathology assessment for admitted patients (ns). Relevance to clinical practice. An evidence-based guideline can improve emergency nursing care of acute stroke and optimise patient outcomes following stroke. As the continuum of stroke care begins in the Emergency Department, detailed recommendations for evidence-based emergency nursing care should be included in all multidisciplinary guidelines for the management of acute stroke. <br /...|$|E

30|$|Among other aspects, {{consistency}} can be ensured or {{improved by}} using well-known and appropriate layouts, data input widgets, visualizations, feedback mechanisms, error messages, symbols and colors. Although striving for it, certain screen layouts and interaction elements, which {{are important to}} MCI management, will not be used by incident commanders in their daily duty as regular emergency physicians or paramedics. One example is the distribution of <b>triage</b> <b>categories</b> shown in Fig.  6. Especially while dealing with well-known design issues for these parts, well-established design principles (e.g. [24]) should be considered.

40|$|Admitting {{children}} to emergency departments (EDs) often places {{them in an}} environment better suited {{to the treatment of}} adult patients. These children are often triaged and treated as adults, resulting in children being given the wrong <b>triage</b> <b>categories</b> and having their treatment delayed. EDs have problems giving drugs to children, staff are unfamiliar with children’s emergency care, and children find EDs frightening. A paediatric emergency short stay unit (PESSU) was opened at Caboolture Hospital, Queensland, Australia, in January 2014. Admission to the PESSU has significantly reduced waiting times for children arriving at the ED and enabled specialist nursing and medical care to be provided quickly.

40|$|In {{the setting}} of mass {{casualty}} incidents (MCIs), hospitals need to divert from normal routine to delivering the best possible care to {{the largest number of}} victims. This should be accomplished by activating an established hospital disaster management plan (DMP) known to all staff through prior training drills. Over the recent decades, imaging has increasingly been used to evaluate critically ill patients. It {{can also be used to}} increase the accuracy of triaging MCI victims, since overtriage (falsely higher <b>triage</b> <b>category)</b> and undertriage (falsely lower <b>triage</b> <b>category)</b> can severely impact resource availability and mortality rates, respectively. This article emphasizes the importance of including the radiology department in hospital preparations for a MCI and highlights factors expected to influence performance during hospital DMP activation including issues pertinent to effective simulation, such as establishing proper learning objectives. After-action reviews including performance evaluation and debriefing on issues are invaluable following simulation drills and DMP activation, in order to improve subsequent preparedness. Historically, most hospital DMPs have not adequately included radiology department operations, and they have not or to a little extent been integrated in the DMP activation simulation. This article aims to increase awareness of the need for radiology department engagement in order to increase radiology department preparedness for DMP activation after a MCI occur...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} inter-rater {{reliability}} of triages {{performed by the}} Electronic Triage System (ETS) which has recently developed and used in hospital emergency department (ED). Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted prospectively and studied 408 visitors of Tabriz Imam Reza hospital’s ED. The variables of interest were age, sex, nurse-assigned <b>triage</b> <b>category,</b> physician-assigned <b>triage</b> <b>category,</b> disease type (trauma, non-trauma), and the referred room within the ED. Cohen’s un-weighted kappa, linear weighted kappa, and quadratic weighted kappa were {{used to describe the}} reliability. Results: Un-weighted kappa observed to be 0. 186 (95 % CI: 0. 123 - 0. 249). Linear weighted kappa observed as 0. 317 (95 % CI: 0. 251 - 0. 384) and quadratic weighted kappa as 0. 462 (95 % CI: 0. 336 - 0. 589). In general, low agreement was seen between the triage nurses and ED physicians. For trauma patients and for those who were referred to the cardiopulmonary resuscitation room (CPR), all three types of kappa were higher than other visitors of the ED. Conclusion: Inter-rater reliability of the triages performed by the ETS observed as ranging from poor to moderate. Implementing interventions that would create a common language between nurses and physicians about the triage of the ED visitors seems necessary. The more agreement on the triage of trauma and CPR patients might be due to their condition and the more attention to them...|$|E
