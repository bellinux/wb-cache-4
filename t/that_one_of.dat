5|$|A shade named Durza, {{along with}} a group of urgals, ambushes a party of three elves. After he and the urgals kill the other elves, Durza {{attempts}} to steal an egg, <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the female elves carries, but is foiled when she causes it to vanish. Infuriated, he renders her unconscious with a ball of fire and abducts her.|$|E
5|$|Analyzing deep-infrared images {{obtained}} by the Spitzer Space Telescope and Gemini North telescope, astronomers discovered <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the cluster's stars – HD 23514, which has a mass and luminosity a bit {{greater than that of}} the Sun, is surrounded by an extraordinary number of hot dust particles. This could be evidence for planet formation around HD 23514.|$|E

5|$|Aristo {{was born}} in Jakarta in 1976.

After beginning junior high school in 1988, he began to go to the theatres to watch films on his own. Despite his enjoyment of film, he was initially active in an indie band.|$|E

5|$|Blythe's {{defense team}} {{attacked}} {{differences between the}} testimonies the witnesses gave after the incident in 2010 and at the court. Among other things, one of the witnesses originally alleged that Nosek and Blythe shook hands or <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> them offered hand to another on stage; however, at the court hearing, he testified {{that there was no}} prior contact between them. Blythe also argued that video evidence shown in court refuted claims about his aggressive behavior.|$|E

5|$|Braun {{was very}} fond of Negus and Stasi, her two Scottish Terrier dogs, and they appear in her home movies. She usually kept them away from Hitler's German Shepherd, Blondi. Blondi was killed {{by one of the}} entourage on 29 April 1945 when Hitler ordered <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the cyanide {{capsules}} obtained for Braun and Hitler's suicide the next day be tested on the dog. Braun's dogs and Blondi's puppies were shot on 30 April by Hitler's dog handler, Fritz Tornow.|$|E
5|$|By 16:30 on Monday 12 December, it was {{reported}} that a further two tank fires had been extinguished, but <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the tanks extinguished earlier had ruptured and re-ignited, and was now threatening to cause the explosion of an adjacent tank. This led to the M1 motorway being closed again; the public exclusion area was widened, and firefighters were temporarily withdrawn until the risk posed by the threatened tank could be assessed.|$|E
5|$|Callisto's leading {{hemisphere}} is less reflective {{than its}} trailing hemisphere, which could indicate <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> its sides {{has a higher}} surface temperature. On this darker, warmer side, sublimation rates of its icy surface would also be higher, causing more water vapor to be released into the atmosphere. This process would ultimately produce more hydrogen, which might explain the aforementioned variance in Callisto's atmospheric hydrogen levels.|$|E

5|$|Deven {{approached}} Vadivelu in October 2005 {{and offered}} him the lead roles. Vadivelu was initially hesitant {{to accept the}} offer as {{he felt that the}} audience would not want to see him as the central character, but after Vadivelu read the script, he decided to take up the role. Regarding the selection of Vadivelu for the roles, Deven noted <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the royal characters from his comic book strip in Ananda Vikatan closely resembled Vadivelu, including his complexion and nativity.|$|E
5|$|During Morgan's {{absence from}} Jamaica, news reached the island that England and Spain had signed the Treaty of Madrid. The pact aimed to {{establish}} {{peace in the}} Caribbean between the two countries; it included an agreement to revoke all letters of marque and similar commissions.

Modyford was arrested and sent to England by Sir Thomas Lynch, his recent replacement.|$|E
5|$|During a {{press conference}} on 26 February 2015, Chovanec {{introduced}} five areas that were to be scrutinized {{in connection with the}} Uherský Brod attack: the communication of national police with municipal authorities, possible changes in crisis plans, operational range of tactical teams, and enhanced training of policemen. Chovanec didn't repeat his sentiment regarding the number of gun license holders, and instead specified <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the issues to be analyzed will be the issuing and revocation of licenses under the existing legislation.|$|E

Philip persuaded his wife that Elizabeth should marry his cousin Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy, to secure the Catholic succession and preserve the Habsburg interest in England, but Elizabeth refused to comply and parliamentary consent was unlikely.|$|E
5|$|First of all, {{this was}} the 60th {{homicide}} in Newark this year, and I'm sure Congressman Tancredo has not opined {{about any of the}} other homicides, and only became interested in this one when it became clear <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the six alleged perpetrators came to this country illegally at the age of 11.
