5|$|Central Salford is {{the eastern}} part of <b>the</b> <b>district</b> <b>and</b> {{comprises}} seven wards: Broughton, Claremont, Irwell Riverside, Kersal, Ordsall, Langworthy and Weaste & Seedley. This is the more urban half of <b>the</b> <b>district</b> <b>and</b> lies partly within the Manchester Inner Ring Road. Salford Quays lies within this area. Between 2005 and 2011, the Central Salford Urban Regeneration Company was responsible for urban regeneration in this area, securing over £1 billion of private sector investment. Social housing is provided by Salix Homes in this area.|$|E
5|$|On 1 July 1905, the Met and the District both {{introduced}} electric {{units on}} the inner circle until later that day a Met multiple unit overturned the positive current rail on <b>the</b> <b>District</b> <b>and</b> the Met service was withdrawn. An incompatibility {{was found between the}} way the shoe-gear was mounted on Met trains and the District track and Met trains were withdrawn from <b>the</b> <b>District</b> <b>and</b> modified. Full electric service started on 24 September, reducing the travel time around the circle from 70 to 50 minutes.|$|E

5|$|Also nearby was the Shoemaker family, which owned {{substantial}} {{tracts of}} land in both <b>the</b> <b>District</b> <b>and</b> in Maryland. Three forts or portions of forts were built on their property: Fort Simmons, Fort Mansfield, and Battery Bailey. Despite the loss of much of their land, the Shoemaker family continued to operate a local general store and sold various sundry items to the garrison at Fort Bayard.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 20th century <b>the</b> <b>District</b> <b>and</b> Metropolitan {{railways}} faced increased competition in central London from new, electric, deep-level tube lines. The City & South London Railway had been a great success when it opened in 1890. After the opening of the Central London Railway in 1900 from Shepherd's Bush to the City with a flat rate fare of 2d, <b>the</b> <b>District</b> <b>and</b> Metropolitan together lost four million passengers between the second half of 1899 and the second half of 1900. The use of steam propulsion led to smoke-filled stations and carriages that were unpopular with passengers and electrification was seen as the way forward. However, electric traction was still in its infancy and agreement would be needed with the Metropolitan because of the shared ownership of the inner circle. A jointly owned train of six coaches successfully ran an experimental passenger service on the Earl's Court to High Street Kensington section for six months in 1900. Tenders were then requested and in 1901 a Metropolitan and District joint committee recommended the Ganz three-phase AC system with overhead wires. Initially this was accepted by both parties.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{approval}} of the 1947 UN Partition Plan, an Arab mob ransacked and burned much of <b>the</b> <b>district</b> <b>and</b> stabbed some of its Jewish residents {{in the course of the}} 1947 Jerusalem riots, one of the events leading to the area's decades-long stagnation.|$|E

5|$|For 2001, {{residents}} of the city had {{an average age of}} 37.1years, younger than the 40.2 average of <b>the</b> <b>district</b> <b>and</b> the 38.6average for England. Of the 17,536 households, 35% were one-person households, 39% were couples, 10% were lone parents, and 15% other. Of those aged16–74 in the city, 27% had a higher education qualification, higher than the 20% national average.|$|E
5|$|In February 1854, the General Assembly's Whig {{majority}} gerrymandered the Eighth District, removing {{over 500}} Democratic voters and {{replacing them with}} several hundred Whig voters by removing Owen and Jessamine counties from <b>the</b> <b>district</b> <b>and</b> adding Harrison and Nicholas counties to it. The cooperation of the Know Nothing Party—a relatively new nativist political entity—with the faltering Whigs further hindered Breckinridge's re-election chances. With his family again in financial straits, his wife wanted him to retire from national politics.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the Twitter {{communication}} between school <b>districts,</b> superintendents, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> public. Content analysis of the tweets posted by the 100 largest U. S. school <b>districts</b> <b>and</b> those <b>district</b> superintendents was performed to investigate how <b>the</b> <b>districts</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> superintendents communicated with the public on Twitter. Next, paired sample f-tests were performed to compare the differences between public sentiment toward <b>the</b> <b>districts</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> superintendents. The findings suggest that <b>the</b> <b>districts</b> <b>and</b> their superintendents primarily used Twitter for one-way information broadcasting, leaving Twitter’s two-way communication functionality largely untapped. Further, the public expressed significantly less negative sentiment toward the superintendents than <b>the</b> <b>districts,</b> whereas no statistical difference existed in the public’s positive or neutral sentiment toward <b>the</b> <b>districts</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> superintendents. The findings provide novel insights into educational institutions’ and leaders’ Twitter communication. More importantly, the findings offer research-based guidance on districts’ and superintendents’ Twitter communication. Recommendations were provided for <b>districts</b> <b>and</b> leaders to use social media effectively and thus engage the public and garner social support for education...|$|R

5|$|Initially <b>the</b> <b>district</b> (<b>and</b> then borough) council {{worked with}} the Commission for New Towns on many aspects of development; but in 1978 many of the commission's assets, such as housing and parks, were {{surrendered}} to the council.

5|$|Initially, <b>the</b> <b>District</b> <b>and</b> the Met {{were closely}} {{associated}} {{and it was}} intended that they would soon merge.

The District was established as a separate company to enable funds to be raised independently of the Met.|$|E

5|$|Reportedly, it was SK Ull's {{forays into}} the {{district}} around Holmenkollen for sporting purposes that spurred {{the establishment of}} the new hill Holmenkollbakken in 1891. The knowledge of the area spurred Fritz R. Huitfeldt to pinpoint the location of the new hill, together with Hans Krag. This hill lay at a higher altitude than Kastellbakken, and thus had more favourable snow conditions. Holmenkollbakken quickly replaced Kastellbakken as the main hill in <b>the</b> <b>district,</b> <b>and</b> eventually became world-famous.|$|E
