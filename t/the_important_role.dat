5|$|The {{gene for}} apolipoprotein A5 (APOA5, gene ID 116519, OMIM {{accession}} number – 606368) was originally found by comparative sequencing {{of human and}} mice DNA as a last member of the gene cluster of apolipoproteins APOA1/APOC3/APOA4/APOA5, located on human chromosome 11 at position 11q23. The creation of two mice models (APOA5 transgenic and APOA5 knock-out) confirmed <b>the</b> <b>important</b> <b>role</b> of this gene in plasma triglyceride determination. The transgenic mice had lower and the knock-out mice higher levels of plasma triglycerides, while plasma cholesterol levels remained unchanged in both animal models.|$|E

5|$|Crystal Palace Football Club {{was formed}} on 10 September 1905 {{playing in the}} Aston Villa colours of claret and blue. The choice of colours {{was a result of}} <b>the</b> <b>important</b> <b>role</b> in the club's {{formation}} played by Edmund Goodman, an Aston Villa employee who was recommended to the fledgling club by the Villa chairman, William McGregor. Goodman organised the business side of the club and managed the team from 1907 to 1925. A former amateur player with Villa, Goodman had lost his right leg after an injury led to amputation. Goodman hired John Robson from Middlesbrough to be the team's manager. Robson had transformed his previous club from an amateur side to an established Football League First Division side.|$|E
5|$|Hindu scriptures provide diverse {{accounts}} {{of the birth of}} Kamadhenu. While some narrate that she emerged from the churning of the cosmic ocean, others describe her as the daughter of the creator god Daksha, and as the wife of the sage Kashyapa. Still other scriptures narrate that Kamadhenu was in the possession of either Jamadagni or Vashista (both ancient sages), and that kings who tried to steal her from the sage ultimately faced dire consequences for their actions. Kamadhenu plays <b>the</b> <b>important</b> <b>role</b> of providing milk and milk products to be used in her sage-master's oblations; she is also capable of producing fierce warriors to protect him. In addition to dwelling in the sage's hermitage, she is also described as dwelling in Goloka - the realm of the cows - and Patala, the netherworld.|$|E
5|$|In humans, plasma {{triglycerides}} such as triacylglycerols {{have been}} long debated {{as an important}} risk factor for not only cardiovascular disease but also for other relevant morbidities, such as cancer, renal disease, suicide, and all-cause mortality. The APOA5 gene was found by comparative sequencing of ~200 kbp of human and mice DNA as the last member of the gene cluster of apolipoproteins located on human chromosome 11 at 11q23. Two mouse transgenic mouse models (APOA5 transgenic and APOA5 knockout) confirmed <b>the</b> <b>important</b> <b>role</b> of this gene in plasma triglyceride levels of plasma triglycerides. Obesity and metabolic syndrome are both closely related to plasma triglyceride levels and APOA5. Recent meta-analyses suggest that the effect on metabolic syndrome development is more profound for rs662799 in Asian population and for rs3135506 for Europeans. Moreover, meta-analysis that focused on rs662799 {{and the risk of}} type 2 diabetes mellitus has suggested a significant association in Asian populations, but not in European populations.|$|E

5|$|Ultimately, the {{voluntary}} system of recruitment proved unable {{to sustain the}} force structure of the AIF, failing to provide sufficient replacements for the heavy casualties it sustained and requiring a number of units to be disbanded {{towards the end of}} the war. In mid-1918 it was decided to allow the men who had enlisted in 1914 to return to Australia for home leave, further exacerbating the manpower shortage experienced by the Australian Corps. Regardless, by the last year of the war the AIF was a long-serving force—even if it was a citizen army and not a professional one like the pre-war British Army—containing 141,557 men with more than two-years service, including, despite the heavy casualties suffered at Gallipoli in 1915 and on the Western Front in 1916 and 1917, 14,653 men who had enlisted in 1914. Battle hardened and experienced as a result, this fact partially explains <b>the</b> <b>important</b> <b>role</b> the AIF subsequently played in the final defeat of the German Army in 1918.|$|E
5|$|While Yellowstone {{was under}} army management, the activities, {{policies}} and procedures developed served as precedents for other national parks and subsequent actions by the National Park Service after its formation in 1916. The army solved {{a wide variety of}} problems and developed procedures covering a multitude of administrative issues. The military superintendents continued the evolution of park policies and conservation measures initiated by the first civilian administrators. They implemented backcountry patrols, access improvement, wildlife protection and management, protection of natural features, law enforcement and development of a ranger force. The army set precedents for future headquarters area development designs, visitor services such as educational outreach and interpretive tours. Their diligence in dealing with poachers led to legislation that provided for prosecution and punishment of illegal activity. That most of the precedents that the army established were incorporated later by the National Park Service is a lasting legacy of <b>the</b> <b>important</b> <b>role</b> the army played in U.S. national park history. Modern Park Ranger uniforms are legacies of army management of the park. Most iconically, the campaign hat, a flat-brow peaked hat worn by the cavalry {{in the last years of}} army management is nearly identical to the modern hats worn into the 21stcentury.|$|E
