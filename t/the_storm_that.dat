5|$|During the {{duration}} of Komen's existence, the IMD issued warnings on <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> <b>that</b> were relayed to {{the governments of the}} countries affected. In southeastern India, government officials issued various warnings for fishermen and for the potential of disruptive rainfall. The widespread flooding forced 1.2million people to evacuate their homes, with 1,537shelters opened to house 214,306 of the evacuees. West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee canceled an overseas trip to London to coordinate relief activities related to the storm.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Ginger {{formed on}} September6 and lasted until October3, {{for a total}} of 27.25days. Its {{duration}} surpassed that of Hurricane Inga in 1969, which was the previous record-holder, by three days. In 2003, it was discovered that the 1899 San Ciriaco hurricane lasted as a tropical cyclone longer than Ginger, although its duration as a tropical cyclone was not continuous. This made Ginger the second longest-lived of any Atlantic hurricane, but it remains <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> <b>that</b> lasted the most consecutive days as a tropical cyclone in the basin.|$|E
5|$|The {{first of}} three {{recorded}} tropical cyclones recorded in the 1821 Atlantic hurricane season, <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> <b>that</b> would eventually strike New York was first observed off the southeast United States coast on September 1, with winds estimated in excess of 135 mph (215 km/h). It moved ashore near Wilmington, North Carolina, and passed near Norfolk, Virginia before moving through the Delmarva Peninsula and New Jersey just inland. On September 3, the hurricane struck approximately near Jamaica Bay, which later became part of New York City, and on September 4 it was observed over New England. This was just 6 years after the destructive Great September Gale of 1815.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>storm</b> <b>that</b> {{would produce}} the EF5 Greensburg tornado began forming after 5:00 pm CDT (2200 UTC) {{in the northeastern}} corner of the Texas Panhandle, and went through phases {{in the early evening}} across the Oklahoma Panhandle with a few {{isolated}} tornadoes. It slowly organized itself as it moved northeast through portions of Oklahoma, and then into Kansas. The first tornado warning with this cell was issued at 8:35 pm CDT (0135 UTC) for Clark County, Kansas, and the tornado first touched down at about 9:00 pm CDT (0200 UTC). Several storm chasers captured the formation of a tornado southwest of Greensburg around 9:20 pm CDT (0220 UTC).|$|E
5|$|By September1, {{the storm}} began to consolidate, with {{reconnaissance}} flights finding an elongated center and surface winds of 60mph (95km/h). Moderate wind shear inhibited convective {{development in the}} western portion; however, outflow {{in other areas of}} the storm improved, leading to further development. A northwest track, fully identified by this time as a mid-tropospheric ridge located over Florida, strengthened. Remaining disorganized, Earl continued to intensify as the center of circulation was located close to deep convection. The NHC stated in their fifth advisory on <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> <b>that</b> Earl did not appear to be fully tropical due to the lack of organization. Around 1200UTC on September2, Earl intensified into a hurricane despite having an atypical structure; the wind field of the storm was asymmetric and the strongest winds were located well to the southeast of the center.|$|E
5|$|On November17, a typhoon {{originated}} west of Guam, which {{moved slowly}} to the west or west-northwest. It approached the eastern Philippines but remained east of the island group. On November22, the typhoon curved to the northeast, remaining south of Japan. Another storm appeared on November22 to the northwest of the previous storm, just to the northeast of Samar. It moved northwestward at first, but recurved to the northeast away from Luzon, and was last reported on November24. On that same day, a typhoon was observed southeast of Guam and proceeded westward. The storm passed near Yap on November25 and later turned to the north. Two days later, a passing United States Navy ship encountered the storm. On November29, a storm passed near the Bonin Islands, but it was uncertain {{whether it was the}} first typhoon of the month near the Philippines or <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> <b>that</b> affected Yap. This storm was last observed on November30.|$|E

5|$|Several {{communities}} in Baker County were devastated, leaving seven people dead, {{as many as}} 100 injured, and hundreds destitute. The county sheriff estimated that merely a dozen houses out of a thousand survived <b>the</b> <b>storm,</b> <b>that</b> thousands of cows were killed, and that {{hundreds of thousands of}} trees were toppled. Not one church or school was left standing in the county, and damage there was estimated at $250,000. Eight people were killed in Suwannee County, including two children crushed by the collapse of their home near Wellborn. In Columbia County, dozens of buildings suffered near or total destruction, while nine people were killed. One woman lost her life in Grady, a small settlement in Lafayette County. Additionally, there were five fatalities in Bradford County, including one man reportedly struck by flying bricks that were lofted nearly a half mile downwind. Strong winds and heavy rainfall affected areas as far southeast as St. Augustine. In Fernandina Beach, the hurricane toppled oak trees and destroyed buildings. Although wind gusts in Jacksonville reached , the effects were generally insignificant.|$|E
5|$|The City of Miami {{responded to}} the {{hurricane}} by downplaying its effects and turning down aid. The Miami Herald declared two weeks after <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> <b>that</b> almost everything in the city had returned to normal. The governor supported the efforts to minimize {{the appearance of the}} destruction by refusing to call a special legislative session to appropriate emergency funds for relief. As a result, the American Red Cross was able to collect only $3million of $5million needed. The 1926 hurricane effectively ended the land boom in Miami, despite the attempts at hiding the effects. It also forced drainage commissioners to re-evaluate the effectiveness of the canals. A $20million plan to build a dike around Lake Okeechobee, to be paid by property taxes, was turned down after a skeptical constituency sued to stop it; more than $14million had been spent on canals and they were ineffective in taking away excess water or delivering it when needed.|$|E
5|$|The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) {{assisted}} in coordinating preparations for Emily. The United States Department of Defense sent power equipment, previously {{used during the}} Great Flood of 1993, to Fort Bragg, while the United States Department of Agriculture stockpiled food in risk zones. Power companies deliberately shut off the power in the Outer Banks to reduce damage to the system and mitigate the risk of electrocutions. At Naval Station Norfolk, 28ships sailed out to sea to ride out the storm; aircraft were evacuated, and nonessential personnel were sent home. The North Carolina government announced ahead of <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> <b>that</b> it would not create a State Disaster Fund, instead relying on private relief {{organizations such as the}} American Red Cross and the Salvation Army. The state's park service pre-positioned 60members with chainsaws to help clear downed trees. Because Emily hit during the busy Labor Day weekend, the tourism industry suffered about $10million in business losses. Many of the evacuees relocated to southeastern Virginia, which saw greatly increased business during the weekend.|$|E

5|$|Toward {{the end of}} June, a {{westerly}} wind burst {{moved across}} the western Pacific Ocean, spawning Typhoon Chan-hom as well as <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> <b>that</b> would become Linfa. On July1, a large area of convection persisted east of the Philippines, with an associated circulation exposed due to moderate wind shear. At 06:00UTC that day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) assessed a low probability of tropical cyclogenesis over the subsequent 24hours. However, the system quickly organized, prompting the JTWC to issue a tropical cyclone formation alert later that day, indicating that a storm would likely form imminently. At 18:00UTC on July1, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) estimated that a tropical depression developed about 500km (300mi) east-northeast of the Philippine island of Samar. Early the next day, the JTWC classified the system as Tropical Depression 10W, based on {{the organization of the}} rainbands about the center. PAGASA – the Philippines' weather agency – also began monitoring the system, giving it the local name Egay.|$|E
5|$|Willaumez {{achieved}} minor {{success in}} his {{operations in the}} South Atlantic and Caribbean, but {{was caught in a}} summer hurricane on his return journey and his ships were scattered along the Eastern Seaboard of North America. One was intercepted and destroyed by British forces and others were so badly damaged in <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> <b>that</b> they were forced to shelter in American ports. The survivors gradually returned to Brest during the autumn, the last arriving in early 1807. The campaign was the last significant operation in the Atlantic {{for the remainder of the}} war, and no French squadron of any size left any of the Biscay ports until 1808. The losses suffered by the Brest fleet weakened it so severely that it would not participate in a major operation until 1809, when an attempt to break out of Brest ended in defeat at the Battle of Basque Roads.|$|E
25|$|A {{supercell}} {{that developed}} over the Nebraska/Kansas border produced extensive hail and at least 7 reported tornadoes on June 19. <b>The</b> <b>storm</b> <b>that</b> travelled southeast through Oklahoma and North Texas eventually became an Mesoscale Convective Complex dumping heavy rain across areas that had been hit with significant flooding.|$|E
