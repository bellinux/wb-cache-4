50|$|The {{crisis at}} the end of the Ancient Age and outset of the Middle Ages brought about much unrest and turmoil in the Novempopulania, where the bagaudae and Vascon raids later are often {{mentioned}} in different documents. The Novempopulania was to become the core region of the Duchy of Vasconia, established by the Franks at the beginning of the 7th century with a view <b>to</b> <b>holding</b> <b>back</b> <b>the</b> Basques, while often conducting a semi-autonomous governance of Basque-Aquitanian background.

5|$|Although the Song dynasty {{was able}} <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>back</b> <b>the</b> Jin, a new foe {{came to power}} over the steppe, deserts, and plains north of the Jin dynasty. The Mongols, led by Genghis Khan (r. 1206–1227), {{initially}} invaded the Jin dynasty in 1205 and 1209, engaging in large raids across its borders, and in 1211 an enormous Mongol army was assembled to invade the Jin. The Jin dynasty was forced to submit and {{pay tribute to the}} Mongols as vassals; when the Jin suddenly moved their capital city from Beijing to Kaifeng, the Mongols saw this as a revolt. Under the leadership of Ögedei Khan (r.1229–1241), both the Jin dynasty and Western Xia dynasty were conquered by Mongol forces. The Mongols also invaded Korea, the Abbasid Caliphate of the Middle East and the Kievan Rus'.|$|E

5|$|The first {{operation}} {{involving the}} 6th Airlanding Brigade followed two attacks by the Palmach on coastguard stations over {{the night of}} 24/25November. Palestine Police Force dogs tracked the attackers to the settlements of Rishpon and Sidna Ali. In the following cordon and search operation, the police were stoned by the inhabitants, and the soldiers on the cordon had to prevent reinforcements from other settlements reaching the villages. The next day, 26November, the police were involved in hand-to-hand fighting with the villagers and eventually withdrew, calling on the brigade to enter the settlements and enforce law and order. Leaving some men behind on the cordon <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>back</b> <b>the</b> estimated 3,000 crowd, {{the remainder of the}} brigade entered the settlements. Here they carried out several baton charges {{and for the first time}} used tear gas to disperse the crowds. In the cleanup operation, 900 persons were later arrested.|$|E

Once Dean discovers the angels are allowing the Apocalypse to happen, he implores for Castiel to help him stop the final seal from being broken. Though Castiel refuses at first, he returns ready to help not long after. He takes Dean to see the prophet Chuck for information on Sam. Their presence does not fall in line with Chuck's Gospel, so the Archangel Raphael begins to descend. Castiel sends Dean to Sam, remaining behind <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>back</b> <b>the</b> archangel and any others who might come.

5|$|Agents Edgar Ross (Jim Bentley) and Archer Fordham (David Wilson Barnes) {{refuse to}} let Marston {{return to his}} family until he assists the Bureau in hunting down Dutch van der Linde (Benjamin Byron Davis), the leader of Marston's former gang. Marston learns that Dutch has been forming his own gang, and joins Ross, Fordham {{and a group of}} U.S. {{soldiers}} in an attack on Dutch's hideout. During the assault, Marston chases Dutch up to a cliff, where the latter commits suicide by backing off the cliff and falling to his death. Marston is released from his deal with Ross and returns to his ranch where his wife Abigail (Sophie Marzocchi) and son Jack (Josh Blaylock) are waiting. Marston devotes his time tending to the ranch, having sworn to keep himself and his family away from the outlaw lifestyle forever. He is then suddenly forced to repel a surprise attack from a combined force of soldiers, lawmen and government agents led by Ross. Marston is able to fend off several waves of attackers and get his family to safety but stays behind <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>back</b> <b>the</b> rest. Despite a valiant last stand, he dies after being shot numerous times by Ross and his men, and is buried by his family on the hill overlooking the ranch.|$|E

5|$|Landward {{movement}} of the shingle meant that the channel of the Glaven was becoming blocked increasingly often by 2004. This led to flooding of Cley village and the environmentally important Blakeney freshwater marshes. The Environment Agency considered several remedial options. It concluded that attempting <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>back</b> <b>the</b> shingle or breaching the spit {{to create a new}} outlet for the Glaven would be expensive and probably ineffective, and doing nothing would be environmentally damaging. The Agency decided to create a new route for the river to the south of its original line, and work to realign a 550m (600yd) stretch of river 200m (220yd) further south was completed in 2007 {{at a cost of about}} £1.5million. The Glaven had previously been realigned from an earlier, more northerly, course in 1922. The ruins of Blakeney Chapel are now to the north of the river embankment, and essentially unprotected from coastal erosion, since the advancing shingle will no longer be swept away by the stream. The chapel will be buried by a ridge of shingle as the spit continues to move south, and then lost to the sea, perhaps within 20–30years.|$|E
5|$|News of the {{invasion}} quickly spread around the world via ambassadors and correspondents in Korea. Journalists in the United States were reporting on {{the invasion}} within five hours of the initial attack, and United States Ambassador to Korea John J. Muccio sent a telegram to the US State Department at 21:26 EST (10:26 KST) June 24. As the combat grew more intense, US Secretary of State Dean Acheson informed US President Harry S. Truman (who had been resting {{at his home in}} Independence, Missouri for the weekend), and Secretary-General of the United Nations Trygve Lie of the situation. The attack was particularly troubling to Truman, who likened it to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, and to Lie, who was reminded of the Invasion of Norway during World War II. Fearing the attack would spur a World War III, Truman resolved to act as quickly as possible to prevent an escalation of the conflict. Muccio met with Rhee, who informed him the South Korean Army would run out of ammunition within ten days, and would not be able <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>back</b> <b>the</b> invasion on its own. He requested the United Nations and the United States assist South Korea in the conflict.|$|E
5|$|On November 3, Sheriff Porttens deputized {{two hundred}} men and they {{marched to the}} {{terminal}} building where they attempted to assist the strikebreakers in moving the streetcars from the street and vulnerable terminal building to the more easily protected carhouse across the street. Todd led the strikebeakers in the effort while the police provided protection. The police were able <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>back</b> <b>the</b> crowd at first, using clubs to hit anyone who attempted to interfere. The rioters increased the intensity of their attack, and men on the rooftops began throwing stones and bricks. Todd was hit multiple times and {{was rushed to the}} hospital with severe injuries. The greatly outnumbered police began to abandon their posts and the strikebreakers fled into the storage buildings. People in the crowd opened fire on a storage building and killed one of the strikebreakers and injured others. By the end of November 3, after two days of protecting the cars, less than fifty policemen remained on duty in the city. Meanwhile, the strike degenerated into a riot encompassing the entire downtown.|$|E
2500|$|Axis {{air superiority}} {{early in the}} {{conflict}} limited {{the ability of the}} Soviets to mount such operations, whilst later in the conflict ongoing shortages of materiel, including silk for parachutes, was also a problem. Nonetheless, the Soviets maintained their doctrinal belief in the effectiveness of airborne forces, as part of their concept of [...] "deep battle", throughout the war. The largest drop during the war was corp-sized (the Vyazma airborne Operation, the 4th Airborne Corps). [...] It was unsuccessful. Airborne formations were used as elite infantry units however, and {{played a critical role in}} several battles. For example, at the Battle of Kursk, the Guards Airborne defended the eastern shoulder of the southern penetration and was critical <b>to</b> <b>holding</b> <b>back</b> <b>the</b> German penetration.|$|R

5|$|The next attack {{took place}} on 20 July as part of Operation Atlantic. It was led by the South Saskatchewan Regiment, with {{supporting}} units from the Cameron Highlanders. In {{the early hours of}} 20 July, the Highlanders secured a position in St André-sur-Orne but were quickly pinned down by German infantry and tanks. At the same time, the South Saskatchewan Regiment moved directly up the slopes of Verrières Ridge, supported by tanks and Hawker Typhoon ground attack aircraft. The Canadian attack faltered in torrential rain, which rendered air support useless and turned the ground into mud. Counterattacks by two Panzer divisions threw the South Saskatchewans back past their support lines and their supporting battalion—the Essex Scottish—came under attack. The Essex Scottish lost over 300 men as it tried <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>back</b> <b>the</b> advance of the 12th SS Panzer Division, while to the east the remainder of I SS Panzer Corps engaged British forces in the Operation Goodwood, the largest armoured battle of the campaign. By the end of the day, the South Saskatchewans had taken 282 casualties and the ridge was still in enemy hands.|$|E
5|$|The {{offensive}} {{began at}} 16:00 on 16 September; {{by the second}} day, JNA 9th (Knin) Corps commanding officer Major General Vladimir Vuković modified the initial plan because of significant resistance from the ZNG and Croatian police (who relied on populated areas and terrain features <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>back</b> <b>the</b> JNA). Vuković's changes involved diverting part of the force to attack Drniš and Sinj, resting {{the remainder of the}} attacking force. These orders were confirmed on 18 September by the JNA Military-Maritime District commander, Vice Admiral Mile Kandić. The Yugoslav Navy began a blockade of the Croatian Adriatic coast on 17 September, further isolating Zadar, and the city's electricity supply was cut {{on the first day of}} the JNA attack. The ZNG was driven out of Polača, towards Škabrnja, on 18 September. Croatian forces captured seven JNA facilities in Zadar, the most significant the Turske kuće barracks and depot. The captures provided the ZNG with about 2,500 rifles, 100 M-53 machine guns and ammunition, although the Yugoslav Air Force bombed the barracks on 22 September in an unsuccessful attempt to hinder removal of the weapons. The captured weapons bolstered the Croatian defence, but JNA attacks north of the city resulted in a stalemate; Croatian forces were spread too thin to defend the city and capture the remaining barracks, and the besieged JNA garrisons were too weak to break out.|$|E
5|$|A {{dispatch}} {{from the}} Associated Press to Mexico City reported that 20,000 citizens from villages in Durango, Sinaloa, Nayarit, and Jalisco evacuated {{due to the}} threat of flooding and high winds from Naomi. The damage from Naomi in Mexico was moderate, although no monetary figures have ever been released. The Associated Press dispatch also reported that Naomi was responsible for knocking out communications over a large area in Mazatlán as well as downing power lines and damaging houses. At least 2000 people were reported homeless in Durango due to the hurricane. The hurricane also caused damage to Highway 15 between Mazatlán and Tepic. Although the highway reopened soon afterward, some areas that were struck by the hurricane were still rough. Naomi's most notable impact in Mexico involved the Lázaro Cárdenas Dam on the Nazas River, which was not complete by the time the hurricane hit. The dam, upriver from Gómez Palacio and Torreón, was feared to break down from the water being built up behind it, influenced by the hurricane. The two options were to either open the dam, saving Torreón by inundating Gómez Palacio, or risk inundating both towns by keeping the dam closed. The decision was made harder by the fact that, if the dam was released and no rain fell to refill the basin behind the dam, the farms would have insufficient water for agricultural growth. Photography from the Environmental Science Services Administration's Automatic Picture Transmission based on the ESSA-6 weather satellite showed that the clouds from Naomi responsible for the rain had almost moved over the area near the dam. Based on the images, the authorities decided to gamble on the dam to successfully hold up, and it managed <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>back</b> <b>the</b> waters without breaking. The hurricane caused four drowning deaths and $16 million in damage in Sinaloa.|$|E

5|$|Pius II {{continued}} to support Skanderbeg, {{but did not}} provide him as much financial aid as Calixtus had since he believed that Skanderbeg's military skill and his soldiers' aptitude for battle were enough <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>back</b> <b>the</b> Turkish armies. However, the pope still considered Skanderbeg's assistance essential for his plans for an anti-Ottoman crusade. In 1459, after Mehmed II completed his conquest of Serbia, Ottoman envoys appealed for a three-year armistice between Skanderbeg's Albania and the Ottoman Empire. The sultan's purpose was to distance Skanderbeg from the pope's crusade as he believed the crusade's only hope for success was Skanderbeg. In order to give Albania a break from fifteen years of continuous Ottoman invasion, Skanderbeg considered accepting the proposal {{but he had to}} get the pope's approval. Pius did not allow such an agreement and began to doubt Skanderbeg's loyalty. As the Ottomans were operating in the Western Balkans, Pius feared that the Ottoman soldiers would break the truce and pour into Albania. In order to regain the pope's trust, Skanderbeg did not agree to the peace. Skanderbeg, nevertheless, was disappointed by Rome's response and he responded by not participating in the Council of Mantua which was held to plan the future crusade. The Council ended in failure, signifying that Skanderbeg would receive no help from the West. He thus sent ambassadors to the pope saying that he would only be willing to land in Italy if a ceasefire with the Turks were arranged, something which Rome soon allowed.|$|E
