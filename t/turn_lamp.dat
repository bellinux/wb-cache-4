40|$|There is {{some concern}} that <b>turn</b> signal <b>lamps</b> with clear outer lenses make it {{difficult}} in bright, sunny conditions {{to decide whether the}} signal is on or not. Two studies were performed. The first study was a survey of current practice in the U. S. with regard to the use of clear-lens <b>turn</b> signal <b>lamps.</b> The main results are that clear outer lenses on rear <b>turn</b> signal <b>lamps</b> are used in about 28 % of all vehicle models, while the corresponding percentage for front <b>turn</b> signal <b>lamps</b> is about 70 %. The second study photometrically evaluated, under bright, sunny conditions, both luminance contrast and color contrast between the on and off states for <b>turn</b> signal <b>lamps</b> that use either an amber lens or a clear lens. The results indicate that luminance contrast between the on and off states is greater for lamps using an amber lens. On the other hand, the results indicate that color contrast between the on and off states is greater for lamps using a clear lens. Because luminance contrast {{is likely to be the}} primary variable influencing driver performance, these results suggest that using clear-lens <b>turn</b> signal <b>lamps</b> is likely to make it more difficult to determine, in bright, sunny conditions, whether the signal is on or not. However, the magnitude of the decrement in real-world performance with clear-lens signal lamps remains to be ascertained...|$|R
50|$|Consider a lamp with a toggle switch. Flicking {{the switch}} once <b>turns</b> the <b>lamp</b> on. Another flick will <b>turn</b> the <b>lamp</b> off. Now suppose {{that there is}} a being able to perform the {{following}} task: starting a timer, he <b>turns</b> the <b>lamp</b> on. At the end of one minute, he turns it off. At the end of another half minute, he turns it on again. At the end of another quarter of a minute, he turns it off. At the next eighth of a minute, he turns it on again, and he continues thus, flicking the switch each time after waiting exactly one-half the time he waited before flicking it previously. The sum of this infinite series of time intervals is exactly two minutes.|$|R

40|$|This {{field study}} {{investigated}} the efficiency of color coding for peripheral identification of vehicle signals. Specifically, the study dealt with identification of stimuli as “yellow” or “red” when presented at intensities corresponding to typical <b>turn</b> signal <b>lamps</b> and side marker <b>lamps.</b> <b>Turn</b> signal <b>lamps</b> were studied both during bright, sunny conditions and at night, while side marker lamps were studied at night only. We used two different yellow stimuli and two different red stimuli. For each color category, one stimulus was relatively far from the contrasting color category while the other stimulus was relatively near. Four viewing angles were used: 0, 10, 20, and 30 degrees from visual fixation. A total of 28 subjects participated, ranging from 21 to 78 years old. Nighttime identification of colors was perfect at all viewing angles for stimuli representing <b>turn</b> signal <b>lamps.</b> On the other hand, there were strong effects of viewing angle for turn signals in the daytime and for side marker lamps at night. Although in these two conditions performance deteriorated for stimuli in both color categories, it did so more for the red stimuli. This {{finding is consistent with}} the previously reported finding that peripherally presented red stimuli often appear yellow. The present findings imply that coding signals yellow and red is not sufficient for their peripheral identification under the two most difficult conditions tested (turn signals during bright daytime and side marker lamps during nighttime). To the extent that peripheral discriminability is important in actual driving, efficient signaling should rely on other coding parameters (e. g., intensity, and flashing versus steady burning) ...|$|R
