To address this unknown, we used numerical modelling techniques calibrated with CFC groundwater age data to quantify <b>transit</b> <b>time</b> and <b>flow</b> path in an unconfined aquifer in Brittany, France. We assessed {{the relative importance of}} parameters (aquifer depth, porosity, arrangement of geological layers, and permeability profile), hydrology (recharge rate), and topography in determining characteristic flow distances (Leray et al., 2016). We found that groundwater flow was highly local (mean travel distance of 350 m) but also relatively old (mean CFC age of 40 years). Sensitivity analysis revealed that groundwater travel distances were not sensitive to geological parameters within the constraints of the CFC age data. However, circulation was sensitive to topography in lowland areas where the groundwater table was close to the land surface, and to recharge rate in upland areas where water input modulated the free surface of the aquifer. We quantified these differences with a local groundwater ratio (rGW-LOCAL) defined as the mean groundwater travel distance divided by the equivalent surface distance water would have traveled along the land surface. Lowland rGW-LOCAL was near 1, indicating primarily topographic controls. Upland rGW-LOCALwas 1. 6, meaning the groundwater recharge area was substantially larger than the topographically-defined catchment.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the influence of a left-to-right shunt on the agreement between cardiac output measurement with the mCO(2) F method and ultrasonic <b>transit</b> <b>time</b> pulmonary blood <b>flow</b> in a lamb model. METHODS: The study was approved by the Ethical Committee on Animal Research of the Radboud University Nijmegen and performed in 8 random-bred lambs. A Gore-Tex shunt was placed between the left pulmonary artery and the descending aorta. This aortopulmonary shunt was intermittently opened and closed, while cardiac output was manipulated by creating hemorrhagic hypotension. Cardiac output measurement with the mCO(2) F method (Q(mCO 2 F)) was compared with pulmonary blood flow obtained by a <b>transit</b> <b>time</b> ultrasonic <b>flow</b> probe positioned around the common pulmonary artery (Q(APC)). RESULTS: Bias, defined as Q(mCO 2 F) - Q(APC), was calculated for each measurement. With an open shunt there was a significant left-to-right shunt (mean Qp/Qs ratio 2. 26; range 1. 56 - 3. 69).

Shallow aquifers with predominantly local flow circulation are particularly vulnerable to agricultural contaminants. Water <b>transit</b> <b>time</b> and <b>flow</b> path are key controls on catchment nitrogen retention and removal capacity, but the relative importance of hydrogeological and topographical factors in determining these parameters is still uncertain. We used groundwater dating and numerical modeling techniques to assess <b>transit</b> <b>time</b> and <b>flow</b> path in an unconfined aquifer in Brittany, France. The 35. 5 km 2 study catchment has a crystalline basement underneath a ∼ 60 m thick weathered and fractured layer, and is separated into a distinct upland and lowland area by an 80 m-high butte. We used groundwater discharge and groundwater ages derived from chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) concentration to calibrate a free-surface flow model simulating groundwater flow circulation. We found that groundwater flow was highly local (mean travel distance = 350 m), substantially smaller than the typical distance between neighboring streams (∼ 1 km), while CFC-based ages were quite old (mean = 40 years). Sensitivity analysis revealed that groundwater travel distances were not sensitive to geological parameters (i. e. arrangement of geological layers and permeability profile) within the constraints of the CFC age data. However, circulation was sensitive to topography in the lowland area where the water table was near the land surface, and to recharge rate in the upland area where water input modulated the free surface of the aquifer. We quantified these differences with a local groundwater ratio (rGW-LOCAL), defined as the mean groundwater travel distance divided by the mean of the reference surface distances (the distance water would have to travel across the surface of the digital elevation model). Lowland, rGW-LOCAL was near 1, indicating primarily topographical controls. Upland, rGW-LOCAL was 1. 6, meaning the groundwater recharge area is almost twice as large as the topographically-defined catchment for any given point. The ratio rGW-LOCAL is sensitive to recharge conditions as well as topography and it could be used to compare controls on groundwater circulation within or between catchments...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new, {{improved}} method for water flow metering. It applies to a <b>transit</b> <b>time</b> ultrasonic <b>flow</b> meter device. In principle, {{the flow of}} a given liquid in a pipe is obtained by measuring the <b>transit</b> <b>times</b> of an ultrasonic wave in the upstream and downstream directions. The difference between these times is, in theory, linearly proportional to the liquid flow velocity. However, the fainter the flow is, the smaller the <b>transit</b> <b>time</b> difference (TTD) is. This difference can be as low as a few picoseconds, which gives rise to many technical difficulties in measuring such a small time difference with a given accuracy. The proposed method relies on measuring the TTD indirectly by computing the phase difference between the steady-state parts of the received signals in the upstream and downstream directions and by using a least-square-sine-fitting technique. This reduces {{the effect of the}} jitter noise and the offset, which limit measurement precision at very low flow velocity. The obtained measurement results illustrate the robustness of the proposed method, as we measure the TTD at no-flow conditions, with a precision as low as 10 ps peak-to-peak and a TTD offset of zero, within a temperature range from room temperature to 80 °C. This allows us to reach a smaller minimum detectable flow when compared with previous techniques. The proposed method exhibits a better trade-off between measurement accuracy and system complexity. It can be completely integrated in an ASIC (application specific integrated circuit) or incorporated in a CPU- or micro-controller-based system...|$|R

RESULTS: Surgical handling and hemostasis of the new prostheses were excellent. Patency rate was 78 % (7 / 9) for PCL grafts, compared with 67 % (4 / 6) for ePTFE grafts. <b>Transit</b> <b>time</b> <b>flow</b> and Doppler ultrasound showed no significant changes in flow and velocity or diameter over time in both groups.

Continued human population growth over the next several decades will place unprecedented demand on urban water resources, resulting in escalating water quality and supply challenges. Urbanization exacts significant impacts on stream ecosystems including increased magnitude and frequency of peak flows, altered microclimates and reduced biodiversity. Increased impervious surface area in urban settings reduces or eliminates soil infiltration and increases the amount of stormwater runoff delivered to stream channels. Stormwater routing networks in urban areas channelize runoff, reducing stormwater <b>transit</b> <b>time.</b> Stormwater <b>flow</b> serves as an important transport mechanism for non-point source pollutants, and impervious surfaces serve as conduits to flow, replacing soils and vegetation that would otherwise attenuate runoff and transport of pollutants. Stream channels typically broaden and deepen in response to increased volume, velocity and frequency of peak flows, leading to increased channel instability, accelerated erosion, and subsequent loss of habitat. Given these scenarios, urbanization can degrade freshwater resources, detrimentally impact in-stream and riparian biota, and destroy riparian wetland form and function.

Methods: Hundred fourty patients with a total of 361 grafts [205 (57 %) arterial and 156 (43 %) venous] underwent isolated coronary surgery. All the grafts were measured by intraoperative <b>transit</b> <b>time</b> <b>flow</b> meter intra-operatively. Group A (n= 70) consisted of patients who received diltiazem infusion (dose of 2. 5 microgram/kg/min), and Group B (n= 70) didn't receive diltiazem infusion. Results: Mean graft flow values of left internal mammary artery were 53 ml/min in Group A and 40 ml/min in Group B (P< 0. 001). Pulsatility index (PI) values of left internal mammary artery for Group A and Group B were 2. 6 and 3. 0 respectively (P< 0. 001). No statistically significant difference was found between venous graft parameters. Conclusion: We recommend an effect of diltiazem infusion in increasing graft flows in coronary artery bypass graft operations...|$|E
40|$|We {{sought to}} {{investigate}} {{the effects of the}} left internal mammary artery anastomosed to the left anterior descending artery for improving mid-term outcome in patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction. Twenty consecutive coronary artery bypass grafts performed by a single surgeon for less than 35 % ejection fraction patients were reviewed retrospectively from April 2000 to November 2008. There was one perioperative death (5. 0 % mortality). The mean survival was 55 months with an actual 5 -year survival rate of 75 %. Echocardiography showed the ejection fraction improved to 10. 7 ± 0. 32 % (p < 0. 01). The strongest correlation was observed between both the flow and the pulsatile index of the left internal mammary artery measured intraoperatively by <b>transit</b> <b>time</b> <b>flow</b> meter and the postoperative ejection fraction improvement (R 2 = 0. 737 and 0. 639, respectively). We reappraised the mid-term beneficial effects of the internal mammary artery anastomosed to the left anterior descending artery in patients with severe left ventricular function...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To assess {{intraoperative}} flow of arterial and venous coronary grafts after myocardial revascularization {{which may}} allow {{early detection of}} low flow situations, especially during minimally invasive coronary bypass surgery (MIDCAB), and lead to immediate correction of technical problems. Methods: In two patients with severe and diffuse multi-vessel disease the left internal mammary artery (IMA) {{was connected to the}} left anterior descending artery (LAD). During reperfusion, the flow was measured in the IMA and vein grafts using a <b>transit</b> <b>time</b> <b>flow</b> meter. Results: In both cases the IMA showed only a systolic pendulating flow curve with a mean flow of 0 - 1 ml/min and a high resistance. Manual IMA assessment revealed an adequate pulsation. Both distal IMA anastomoses were re-explored on cardiopulmonary bypass yielding an initial flow of 7 and 14 ml/min, respectively. After treatment with papaverine/adenosine the IMA flow increased from 7 to 26 ml/min (coronary flow reserve (CFR) = 3. 7) and from 14 to 46 ml/min (CFR= 3. 3), respectively. Conclusion: Intraoperative flow assessment of IMA and venous bypass grafts can be recommended to monitor flow; especially during MIDCAB procedure...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} the minimum cost multicommodity flow problem in dynamic networks with time-varying capacities of arcs and <b>transit</b> <b>times</b> on arcs {{that depend on}} the sort of commodity entering them. We assume that cost functions, defined on arcs, are nonlinear and depend on <b>time</b> and <b>flow,</b> and the demand function also depends on time. Moreover, we study {{the problem in the}} case when <b>transit</b> <b>time</b> functions depend on <b>time</b> and <b>flow.</b> The modification of the time-expanded network method and new algorithms for solving the considered classes of problems are proposed...|$|R
40|$|Given {{a network}} with {{capacities}} and <b>transit</b> <b>times</b> on the arcs, the quickest flow problem {{asks for a}} `flow over time' that satisfies given demands within minimal time. In the setting of <b>flows</b> over <b>time,</b> <b>flow</b> on arcs may vary over <b>time</b> and the <b>transit</b> <b>time</b> of an arc is {{the time it takes}} for flow to travel through this arc. In most real-world applications (such as, e. g., road traffic, communication networks, production systems, etc.), <b>transit</b> <b>times</b> are not fixed but depend on the current flow situation in the network. We consider the model where the <b>transit</b> <b>time</b> of an arc is given as a nondecreasing function of the rate of inflow into the arc. We prove that the quickest $s$-$t$-flow problem is NP-hard in this setting and give various approximation results, including an FPTAS for the quickest multicommodity flow problem with bounded cost...|$|R
40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{dissertation}} is {{to develop}} mathematical models and numerical tools to analyze and quantify mean <b>transit</b> <b>times</b> of <b>flow</b> within a cylindrical tube from data that is acquired using cross-sectional sampling methods. Typically, indicator concentration curves in physiologic systems have been measured using flow-proportional sampling techniques. However, {{with the advent of}} improved temporal and spatial resolution imaging systems, concentration curves from vessels within living organs can be obtained. However, these curves are generally cross-sectionally sampled and thus do not fulfill the requisite assumptions of conventional indicator dilution theory. The most significant practical ramification is that generally, the mean <b>transit</b> <b>time</b> of a cross-sectional concentration curve does not equal that of a flow-sampled concentration curve or may fail to exist at all. Thus, here we have extended the application of indicator dilution theory by examining a class of model flow systems for which it is possible to obtain estimates of the flow parameters (including mean <b>transit</b> <b>time)</b> within the system using cross-sectional concentration curves. The model flow system consisted of a straight cylindrical tube perfused with steady flow having a general power-law (α) velocity profile. Measurement of upstream and downstream cross-sectional concentration curves was considered. Several new results were obtained. First, the existence and general form of a unique cross-sectional transport function between these two sites was established for 0 ≤ α 3 ̆c 1. This transport function has an analytic form consisting of the sum of a leading sharp delta function followed by a decreasing, continuous function that is shown to be the unique solution of a Volterra integral equation involving the power-law velocity profile. Two methods for obtaining the cross-sectional transport function from upstream and downstream cross-sectional concentration curves were developed. The damped least squares deconvolution method was investigated as well as numerical implementation of the solution of the Volterra integral equation. Finally, the relationship between the mean <b>transit</b> <b>time</b> of the cross-sectional transport function and the flow-sampled mean <b>transit</b> <b>time</b> (given by volume/flow) was obtained. The utility of these approaches was investigated via simulations and an experiment. The simulations revealed that even in the presence of noise, the methods produce reasonable estimates of the underlying parameters of the model system. The experiment demonstrated the practical utility of the numerical methods. In both cases, the underlying methodology was to simulate or measure upstream and downstream cross-sectional concentration curves which were then used to determine the cross-sectional transport function using both the damped least squares and the analytic solution methods. The mean <b>transit</b> <b>time</b> of the estimated cross-sectional transport function was then calculated and rescaled to obtain an estimate of the flow-sampled mean <b>transit</b> <b>time.</b> Further research will be needed to determine the applicability of these methods to concentration curves obtained from flow images of vessels in living organs...|$|R
