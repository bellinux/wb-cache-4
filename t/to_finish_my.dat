25|$|I fear both {{death and}} the act of dying that lies ahead of us. I should have liked <b>to</b> <b>finish</b> <b>my</b> account of working for Arthur – a story which began when our paths {{happened}} to cross in 1949. However, I cannot live without Arthur, despite certain inner resources.|$|E
500|$|On 1 February 2009, Given {{signed for}} Manchester City on a four-and-a-half-year {{contract}} for £6million. He was formally paraded as a Manchester City player on 5 February 2009, and was assigned squad number 37. In the subsequent press conference, he criticised Newcastle's management for not trying {{hard enough to}} keep him at the club. He also said that [...] "By coming here I thought I could be at a club that is challenging for honours. I didn't want <b>to</b> <b>finish</b> <b>my</b> career regretting not taking up this offer." [...] Given kept a clean sheet in {{a man of the}} match performance in his debut, a 1–0 win against Middlesbrough on 7 February.|$|E

Others stay later, but then they do not begin so soon. As <b>to</b> <b>finishing</b> <b>my</b> education, as they call it, I shall do that at home. What a happy thought! It {{makes me want to}} skip. And you are to be my teacher, Ralph. I am sure you know everything that I shall need to know." ...|$|R
2500|$|On May 29, Halladay {{was placed}} on the 15-day {{disabled}} list with a shoulder strain. It was his first DL stint since 2009. In a press conference on June 6, Halladay stated, [...] "Ultimately, my goal is <b>to</b> <b>finish</b> <b>my</b> career with the Phillies and win a World Series here. Some of those things are not fully in my control, but my intent is to play here and finish my career here and be here as long as I can." [...] Halladay stated this during his press conference about his shoulder injury, which he revealed that he will sit out three more weeks, and then re-evaluate his condition. The injury would eventually be diagnosed as a strained latissimus dorsi and Halladay was hopeful {{he would be able to}} return shortly after the All-Star break in July.|$|E
2500|$|Blue Horse {{insisted that}} Burbank paint four portraits of him. After {{the first one}} was finished, Blue Horse's {{daughter}} Lizzie Blue Horse was very ill and Blue Horse asked Burbank to his house to see her. Burbank found the girl lying on a pile of blankets dying of consumption and did what he could to comfort her and proposed getting a doctor the next day. But in the morning Blue Horse rode in and said that his daughter had died during the night. As soon as the body was buried, Blue Horse had the house torn down. Blue Horse told Burbank that he would go to a place one hundred miles distant to visit with some other Indians and forget his troubles. Blue Horse asked Burbank to lend him seven dollars to buy calico for one of his daughter’s good friends. Burbank told him that he was too poor to buy calico for other people. “Look here, my friend,” said Blue Horse, “I want that calico to give to my daughter’s friend so that my daughter will be happier in heaven. If you will lend me the money I will pay you by posing for you." [...] Burbank agreed and handed him the seven dollars. Blue Horse said his heart was sick and that {{he wanted to go to}} Rosebud, about a hundred miles away, where he could see a different country and new faces that would help him to forget as much as possible his grief. Blue Horse pointed to the position of the sun at nine o’clock in the morning. “In one moon I return,” and with his thumb and forefinger Blue Horse made a circle to indicate the sun. Blue Horse returned exactly when he said he would and found Burbank painting the portrait of another subject. The old man pointed his finger at Burbank accusingly. “You lie,” he said. Burbank asked him why. “You promised <b>to</b> <b>finish</b> <b>my</b> picture when I came back.” Burbank explained that he could not wait but that as soon as he had finished the portrait he was working on he would resume his picture. This satisfied Blue Horse, and Burbank painted three more portraits of him.|$|E

6000|$|... "Thank you, I guess I can {{get through}} by dark. I do want <b>to</b> <b>finish,</b> for <b>my</b> mother is sick, and needs me {{as well as the}} money," [...] {{answered}} the needle-woman, pausing to give the girl a grateful smile, then stitching away faster than ever.|$|R
60|$|I {{remained}} in the drawing-room, partly because I wanted <b>to</b> <b>finish</b> out <b>my</b> cry, and partly because, miserable coward that I was, I didn't dare face Alicia.

'Yes,' said Ulick, {{entering}} the drawing-room, which was ruddy with firelight, and fragrant with {{the breath of}} the conservatory, and leaning over an arm-chair, {{as he tried to}} rub the aching out of his brow; 'there were some accounts <b>to</b> <b>finish</b> up and <b>my</b> additions came out different every time.' ...|$|R

40|$|Acknowledgements Many people deserve {{thanks in}} helping me {{progress}} from <b>my</b> mother's womb <b>to</b> <b>finishing</b> <b>my</b> dissertation. Rather than {{beginning with the}} doctor who delivered me and filling pages and pages with names, I'll say one big generic thanks to all who deserve to be thanked but aren't mentioned here by name. My advisor, Mitch Marcus, deserves {{a great deal of}} thanks for his constant support and encouragement. His enthusiasm helped make my research a lot more fun. I thank my committee (Steve Abney, Lila Gleitman, Aravind Joshi and Mark Liberman) for their feedback, which was significant in shaping my dissertation. I also thank them for allowing me to graduate. I believe {{the men and women who}} have sacrificed over the years to defend our Bill of Rights and Constitution deserve special thanks, for without their commitment, freedom of thought and expression might not exist. My parents instilled in me a love for education from an early age, which provided the driving force for me to pursue a degree, as well as the belief that one should always doubt, question, and learn. I met Meiting Lu when I first arrived at the University of Pennsylvania. She managed to keep me sane during my 3. 75 years at Penn. It is Meiting and her friendship that deserve the biggest thanks. ii...|$|R
