The English peers feared that the House of Lords would be swamped by the Scottish element, and consequently {{the election of a}} small number of representative peers to represent Scotland was negotiated.

5|$|After 1302 {{the island}} kingdom was {{sometimes}} called <b>the</b> <b>Kingdom</b> of Trinacria.

In 1816 the island Kingdom of Sicily merged with <b>the</b> <b>Kingdom</b> of Naples to form <b>the</b> <b>Kingdom</b> of the Two Sicilies.

5|$|After {{the death}} of Frederick, <b>the</b> <b>Kingdom</b> was ruled by HenryVII of Germany and ConradIV of Germany. The next {{legitimate}} heir was ConradII, who was too young at the period to rule. Manfred of Sicily, the illegitimate son of Frederick, took the power and ruled <b>the</b> <b>kingdom</b> for fifteen years while other Hohenstaufen heirs were ruling various areas in Germany. After long wars against the Papal States, <b>the</b> <b>Kingdom</b> managed to defend its possessions, but the Papacy declared <b>the</b> <b>Kingdom</b> escheated because of disloyalty of the Hohenstaufen. Under this pretext he came to an agreement with LouisIX, King of France. Louis's brother, Charles of Anjou, would become king of Sicily. In exchange, Charles recognized the overlordship of the Pope in <b>the</b> <b>Kingdom,</b> paid {{a portion of the}} papal debt, and agreed to pay annual tribute to the Papal States. The Hohenstaufen rule in Sicily ended after the 1266 Angevin invasion and {{the death of}} Conradin, the last male heir of Hohenstaufen, in 1268.|$|E

5|$|Before 1707, <b>the</b> <b>Kingdom</b> of Scotland was a {{sovereign}} independent state {{which had its}} own legislature—the Parliament of Scotland—which met, latterly, at Parliament House on the Royal Mile in Edinburgh.

The two previous Acts of Union (one for the British Parliament {{and one for the}} Parliament of Scotland) had dissolved the previous parliaments. The Treaty of Union created the Parliament of Great Britain which was housed in the Palace of Westminster in London. As a consequence, Scotland was directly governed from London for the next 292 years without a legislature or a Parliament building of its own.|$|E

5|$|Clement XIII died {{suddenly}} on 2 February 1769, {{a day before}} {{the date of the}} consistory that he had convoked to examine the demands for the general suppression of the Society of Jesus. The various courts under the House of Bourbon and <b>the</b> <b>Kingdom</b> of Portugal (under the House of Braganza) had exerted strong pressure on the Holy See to suppress this order through almost the whole of his pontificate. In 1759 Jesuits were expelled from Portugal, in 1762 from <b>the</b> <b>Kingdom</b> of France, in 1767 from Spain and in 1768 from <b>the</b> <b>Kingdom</b> of Naples, <b>the</b> <b>Kingdom</b> of Sicily and the Duchy of Parma and Piacenza. Clement XIII strongly defended the Society (e.g. in the bull Apostolicum pascendi in 1765), but without success. In January 1769 France and Naples seized the papal territories around Avignon, Benevento and Pontecorvo to force the pope to issue a decree for the suppression of the order. The sudden death of 75-year-old Clement XIII left this difficult decision to his successor.|$|E
