5|$|After the 1998 {{death of}} Ruby, the zoo's famous {{painting}} elephant, the zoo abandoned its elephant breeding program {{and began to}} focus on elephant behavior. The zoo is currently home to three Asian elephants that have a variety of behavioral issues, the most common being aggression toward other elephants. One elephant is a former performer at a circus and was subject to mistreatment, while <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>two</b> <b>were</b> captured in remote regions where they were never properly socialized.|$|E
5|$|As {{the team}} {{advanced}} to the front, they were brought under heavy enemy rifle, grenade and mortar fire. Just as the three had reached the front lines, a Japanese grenade landed among them. It {{was less than a}} foot from the two Marines with PFC Gonsalves. Without a moment's hesitation, he flung himself on the grenade, taking the full explosion into his own body. He gallantly gave his life for his fellow Marines and his country. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>two</b> <b>were</b> not even touched by grenade fragments and they successfully completed their mission.|$|E

5|$|During the {{modernization}} in the 1980s, three important weapons {{were added to}} the Iowa-class battleships. The first was the CIWS anti-aircraft/anti-missile system discussed above. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>two</b> <b>were</b> missiles for use against both land and sea targets. At one point the NATO Sea Sparrow was to be installed on the reactivated battleships; however, it was determined that the system could not withstand the over-pressure effects when the main battery was fired.|$|E
5|$|In 1897 one {{of these}} 3-pounder guns was mounted on each turret top and, three years later, the 3-pounders in the {{fighting}} tops were transferred to the forward superstructure. At {{the same time the}} above-water torpedo tubes were removed. About 1902–03 the 6-pounders on the main deck were removed; two were remounted on the superstructure, but <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>two</b> <b>were</b> not replaced. In 1905 the 3-pounders on the forward superstructure were removed while the 3-pounders in the lower fighting tops were removed while the ship was in reserve from 1907–09.|$|E

Fear members Mando Lopez and Richard Presley, and musician Jose Medeles, joined the line-up. The group continued recording with Albini in 2001. Title TK was compiled from {{the output of}} these sessions and supplemented with two tracks recorded in Los Angeles with engineers Andrew Alekel and Mark Arnold.

5|$|Several motion {{pictures}} have featured Iguanodon. In the Disney film Dinosaur, an Iguanodon named Aladar {{served as the}} protagonist with three other iguanodonts as other main characters; a loosely related ride {{of the same name}} at Disney's Animal Kingdom is based around bringing an Iguanodon back to the present. Iguanodon is one of the three dinosaur genera that inspired Godzilla; <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>two</b> <b>were</b> Tyrannosaurus and Stegosaurus. Iguanodon has also made appearances in some of the many Land Before Time films, as well as episodes of the television series.|$|E
5|$|The Great American Bash (2004) was the 15th Great American Bash {{professional}} wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event, and {{the first}} produced by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). The event, presented by Subway, took place on June 27, 2004, at the Norfolk Scope in Norfolk, Virginia and was a SmackDown! brand-exclusive event. Three of the eight matches on the card were contested for a championship; one was lost while <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>two</b> <b>were</b> retained.

One of the scuttled ships was raised and scrapped. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>two</b> <b>were</b> raised and put to use by the Navy of the Independent State of Croatia, and were lost late in the war, with one being raised {{after the war and}} put into service until 1962.|$|E
5|$|Three {{indirect}} {{deaths were}} reported from Diana. One person {{died from a}} heart attack while making hurricane preparations, and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>two</b> <b>were</b> from automobile accidents. Following the storm, President Ronald Reagan declared five North Carolina counties as a federal disaster area, allowing the affected regions to receive government funds and assistance. Funds were also allocated for the repairing of roads and sewers.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{preliminary}} report on the hurricane, neither track forecasts or intensity forecasts panned out for the storm. The track forecasts called for a path more northward than the actual track whereas following {{the development of the}} eye, intensity forecasts called for further strengthening until it became clear the cyclone was weakening. When it was upgraded to a hurricane on August 8, Cora became the second hurricane to have been upgraded to that intensity based solely on satellite presentation after 1975's Hurricane Doris. The hurricane was also the second of three storms in the season to reform or be reclassified as East Pacific storms. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>two</b> <b>were</b> Tropical Storm Bess (which became Hurricane Iva), and Hurricane Greta-Olivia. Of these, only Greta maintained its circulation over land. This was the only time an Atlantic hurricane was named Cora.|$|E

5|$|After {{finishing}} last in {{the previous}} season, the Daredevils added players such as Mahela Jayawardene, Andre Russell, Kevin Pietersen and Ross Taylor to the squad. Eric Simons succeeded Greg Shipperd as the head coach and T. A. Sekhar took the mentorship. The team won 11 of the 16 matches played in the league stage of the IPL and topped the point table. However, it lost both its two matches in the playoffs and finished at the third place. In the CLT20, they won two of its four group stage matches, while <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>two</b> <b>were</b> abandoned due to rain. It topped its group and reached the semi-final, where it lost to the Highveld Lions. Morné Morkel was the highest wicket-taker in the IPL, whereas skipper Virender Sehwag became the first batsman to score five consecutive fifties in the league. After the CLT20, the team released fourteen of its players, including Robin Bist, Aaron Finch and Venugopal Rao, signing Jesse Ryder, Johan Botha and Jeevan Mendis.|$|E
5|$|After {{the militia}} {{advanced}} about 200yards (200m), the Kickapoo suddenly let loose a loud yell from their hidden {{position on the}} bank of an oxbow lake along the river. The warriors fired a volley toward the advancing militia and three men, Samuel Black, Samuel Wells and Montaville Morris, were hit and went down. Dodge did not hesitate and ordered his men to charge, they obeyed and waited until they were within six feet of the Kickapoo before discharging their weapons. The fight, after the initial charge and volley, descended into a hand-to-hand struggle with tomahawks, bayonets, muskets and spears the weapons of choice. The fighting only lasted a few minutes: nine Kickapoo were killed on the spot and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>two</b> <b>were</b> felled while fleeing across the lake. During the hand-to-hand combat a fourth member of the militia, Thomas Jenkins, was wounded. Though short, the Battle of Horseshoe Bend had a lasting impact and influence {{on the rest of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|Assembly of a Fat Man {{unit was}} a complex {{operation}} involving personnel from the HE-ME, Pit, Fusing and Firing teams. To prevent the assembly building from becoming overcrowded and thereby causing an accident, Parsons limited the numbers allowed inside at any time. Personnel waiting {{to perform a}} specific task had to wait their turn outside the building. The first Fat Man assembly, known as F13, was assembled by 31 July, and expended in a drop test the next day. This was followed by F18 on 4 August, which was dropped the next day. Three sets of Fat Man high explosive pre-assemblies, designated F31, F32, and F33, arrived on a B-29 of the 509th Composite Group and 216th Army Air Forces Base Unit on 2 August. On inspection, the high explosive blocks of F32 {{were found to be}} badly cracked and unserviceable. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>two</b> <b>were</b> assembled, with F33 earmarked for a rehearsal and F31 for operational use.|$|E

5|$|At around 13:00, {{tanks of}} the Panzer-Lehr Division {{advanced}} into Villers-Bocage unsupported by infantry. Four Panzer IVs tried to enter {{from the south}} near a wrecked Panzer IV and two were knocked out by anti-tank fire. Some Tigers were brought up and, in an exchange of fire, silenced the anti-tank position. Möbius divided the primary counter-attack down the main highway through Villers-Bocage and through the southern section of town parallel to the main road, to secure the town centre. The Tigers advanced slowly to intimidate the British into withdrawing {{and ran into the}} British ambush. The Firefly opened fire on the lead tank and missed but the anti-tank gun knocked it out. A group of three Tigers split up and drove through the back streets to flank the British; one was engaged by an anti-tank gun and destroyed, <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>two</b> <b>were</b> engaged with PIATs, one was knocked out and the other immobilised.|$|E
5|$|Australia carried eight BL 12-inch Mark X guns in four BVIII* twin turrets; {{the largest}} guns fitted to any Australian warship. Two turrets were mounted {{fore and aft}} on the centreline, {{identified}} as 'A' and 'X' respectively. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>two</b> <b>were</b> wing turrets mounted amidships and staggered diagonally: 'P' was forward and to port of the centre funnel, while 'Q' was situated starboard and aft. Each wing turret had some limited ability to fire to the opposite side. Her secondary armament consisted of sixteen BL 4-inch Mark VII guns positioned in the superstructure. She mounted two submerged tubes for 18-inch torpedoes, {{one on each side}} aft of 'X' barbette, and 12 torpedoes were carried.|$|E
5|$|Australia's biggest {{challenge}} in the post-Test tour matches was against the Leveson Gower's XI. During the last Australian tour in 1938, this team was effectively a full-strength England outfit, but this time Bradman insisted that only six current Test players be allowed to represent the hosts. After the hosts had complied, the Australian skipper fielded a full-strength team. In a rain-interrupted match, Lindwall bowled Hutton for a duck with the new ball. He returned and took five {{of the last six}} wickets to fall as the hosts lost their last six wickets for 57 runs. His last five victims were former England captain Walter Robins and Test players Freddie Brown, Evans, Bedser and Laker. Lindwall ended with 6/59; four of his wickets were bowled, while <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>two</b> <b>were</b> caught by Ian Johnson in the slips. He made five as Australia with 8/489 declared; time ran out in the rain-affected match with Leveson-Gower's XI at 0/75.|$|E
