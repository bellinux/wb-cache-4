5000|$|Named {{because the}} bar has smooth ends with {{receiving}} threads tapped {{into the end}} of the bar. In internally threaded jewelry, the bead has a <b>receiving</b> <b>tube</b> machined into it (this is referred to as [...] "countersunk"), with a threaded post extending from the center, which mates with the threaded <b>receiving</b> <b>tube</b> on the bar. Being much less likely to cause damage and irritation, especially at the time of piercing, internally threaded jewelry is considered superior to externally threaded jewelry. It is usually slightly more expensive than externally threaded jewelry, due to the extra machining and labor involved.|$|R

Just as one can simplify a signal processing problem by leveraging the Fourier integral to transform from the time domain to the frequency domain, we can leverage the <b>transmit</b> and <b>receive</b> array responses to transform the problem from the array domain to the wave-vector domain. In other words, we can express the <b>transmit</b> and <b>receive</b> signals as field distributions over direction rather than current distributions over position along the array. In fact, for our case of the unipolarized linear array, the <b>transmit</b> and <b>receive</b> array responses are the Fourier and inverse-Fourier integral kernels, respectively.|$|R
