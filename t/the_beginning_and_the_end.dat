5|$|In {{addition}} to standard usages {{listed in the}} law, the emblem {{has been used in}} various other circumstances. The emblem is displayed, along with the national flag, at <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of a video clip with the Belarusian anthem My Belarusy, regularly played on Belarusian television. Another use of the emblem is on ballot boxes and campaign mailings used during national and local elections. The emblem also appears on Belarus's border posts.|$|E
5|$|Outside the National Day {{celebrations}} period, {{the national}} flag of Singapore is flown from all buildings housing government and government-related departments, such as armed forces installations, court houses, offices, and educational institutions. A {{picture of the}} flag is commonly found in each classroom, and schools conduct ceremonies at <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> {{of the school day}} at which the national flag is raised and lowered, the national anthem is sung and the national pledge is taken.|$|E

5|$|Every {{night after}} shooting, editor Colin Goudie and his {{assistant}} Justin Hall would download the footage so the memory sticks could be cleared and {{ready for the next}} day. While new footage was being captured, the previously filmed footage was edited at the production team's hotel. After filming concluded, the crew had over 100 hours of footage. The original cut was over four hours long but was trimmed to 94 minutes after eight months of editing. Edwards originally had the ending of the film both at <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>end.</b> He and the film's producers disagreed about the placement, so he decided to put the chronological ending of the film {{at the beginning and end}} the film immediately after Andrew and Samantha kiss.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Ken Levine and David Isaacs, and {{directed}} by Mark Kirkland. It was the first episode of The Simpsons Kirkland directed. He has since directed over 50 episodes. Executive producer James L. Brooks {{came up with the}} idea of the Moe's Tavern wraparounds at <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the episode. It was added because the writers did not know how to end the episode. Levine had worked as a minor league baseball announcer before the episode was produced so he was able to give directions to the animators on the characters' looks and ambiance of the episode.|$|E
5|$|The {{office of}} {{governor}} {{was established by}} the first New York State Constitution in 1777. The governor was originally for a term of three years, though the constitution did not specify when the term began. A 1787 law set {{the start of the}} term at July 1. The New York State Constitutional Convention of 1821 amended the state constitution, reducing the term of office to two years, moving the election to November, and moving <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the term to coincide with the calendar year. An 1874 amendment extended the term of office back to three years, but the 1894 constitution again reduced it to two years. The most recent constitution of 1938 extended the term to the current four years. There is no limit to the number of consecutive terms a governor may serve.|$|E

50|$|Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven wrote a poem {{entitled}} “Kinship,” {{which is}} dedicated to Grove: “Memory to F.P.G.” In this poem, she juxtaposes <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> ending of their ten-year relationship, using eroticized horseback riding {{as a metaphor for}} a highly charged journey through memory.|$|R
5|$|Both {{male and}} female mallards have {{distinct}} iridescent purple-blue speculum feathers edged with white, which are prominent in flight or at rest but temporarily shed during the annual summer moult. Upon hatching, the plumage of the duckling is yellow on the underside and face (with streaks by the eyes) and black on the back (with some yellow spots) {{all the way to}} the top and back of the head. Its legs and bill are also black. As it nears a month in age, the duckling's plumage starts becoming drab, looking more like the female, though more streaked, and its legs lose their dark grey colouring. Two months after hatching, the fledgling period has ended, and the duckling is now a juvenile. Between three and four months of age, the juvenile can finally begin flying, as its wings are fully developed for flight (which can be confirmed by the sight of purple speculum feathers). Its bill soon loses its dark grey colouring, and its sex can finally be distinguished visually by three factors: 1)the bill is yellow in males, but black and orange in females; 2)the breast feathers are reddish-brown in males, but brown in females; and 3)in males, the centre tail feather (drake feather) is curled, but in females, the centre tail feather is straight. During the final period of maturity leading up to adulthood (6–10 months of age), the plumage of female juveniles remains the same while the plumage of male juveniles gradually changes to its characteristic colours. This change in plumage also applies to adult mallard males when they transition in and out of their non-breeding eclipse plumage at <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the summer moulting period. The adulthood age for mallards is fourteen months, and the average life expectancy is three years, but they can live to twenty.|$|E

50|$|For their 1978 live release Koncert kod Hajdučke česme {{the band}} {{had a much}} shorter version of the song.

25|$|Clubs play {{each other}} twice (once {{at home and}} once away) in the 26-match season. The league begins in mid-July and ends in mid-June. After 13 rounds of fixtures, there is a winter break that lasts for three months (from early December to early March). Thus, the winter break is {{significantly}} longer than the interval between seasons. This schedule accounts for climatic conditions and matches that of most European leagues in terms of <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the season.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, {{the growth in}} cinema {{attendance}} of the preceding decade first stagnated and then went into freefall throughout the 1960s. By 1969 West German cinema attendance at 172.2 million visits per year {{was less than a}} quarter of its 1956 post-war peak. As a consequence of this, numerous German production and distribution companies went out of business in the 1950s and 1960s and cinemas across the Federal Republic closed their doors; the number of screens in West Germany almost halved between <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the decade.|$|E

In 1991 the newsletter was renamed Wingspan, a glossy colour magazine received by all members. By 2004 fewer than 20% of RAOU members subscribed to the Emu.|$|E
