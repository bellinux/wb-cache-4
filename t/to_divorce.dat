5|$|The Life of Saint Edward {{claims that}} while Godwin was in exile Robert {{tried to persuade}} King Edward <b>to</b> <b>divorce</b> Edith, Godwin's daughter, but Edward refused and instead she {{was sent to a}} nunnery. However, the Life is a hagiography, written soon after Edward's death to show Edward as a saint. Thus it {{stresses}} that Edward voluntarily remained celibate, something unlikely to have been true and not corroborated by any other source. Modern historians have felt it more likely that Edward, at Robert's urging, wished <b>to</b> <b>divorce</b> Edith and remarry in order to have children to succeed him on the English throne, although it is possible that he merely wished to be rid of her, without necessarily wanting a divorce.|$|E

5|$|Men have a {{unilateral}} right <b>to</b> <b>divorce</b> their wives (talaq) without needing any legal justification. The divorce is effective immediately. The husband's obligation is then to provide {{financial support for}} the divorced wife {{for a period of}} four months and ten days. A woman can only obtain a divorce with the consent of her husband or judicially if her husband has harmed her. In practice, it is very difficult for a Saudi woman to obtain a judicial divorce. The divorce rate is high, with 50% of marriages being dissolved. In the event of divorce, fathers have automatic custody of sons from the age of 7 and daughters from the age of 9. The right for men to marry up to four wives, combined with their ability <b>to</b> <b>divorce</b> a wife at any time without cause, can translate to unlimited polygamy. King Abdul Aziz, the founder of the country, reportedly admitted to marrying over two hundred women. However, his polygamy was considered extraordinary even by Saudi Arabian standards.|$|E

5|$|Afonso III of Portugal was not {{the eldest}} son, {{therefore}} heraldic practices stated he should not take his father's arms without adding a personal variation.

He then married Beatrice of Castile, an illegitimate daughter of Alfonso X of Castile. It {{is more likely that}} it was this family connection with Castile (his mother was also Castilian) that justified the new heraldic addition to the royal arms—a red bordure charged with an undetermined number of yellow castles—rather than the definitive conquest of the Algarve and its Moorish fortresses, considering that the number of castles was only fixed in the late 16th century.|$|E

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study was to examine how coping styles, spirituality, and social support contributed <b>to</b> <b>divorced</b> persons’ {{adjustment}} <b>to</b> life after <b>divorce.</b> The study used a qualitative research design with face‑to‑face interviews. A snowball sample was used in order <b>to</b> inquire <b>divorced</b> participants’ experiences after divorce. Twelve participants were interviewed to obtain their individual experiences and discernment of divorce transition. The study found that spirituality (e. g., attending church, Bible reading, prayers) was a major copying strategy used by most of the participants after divorce. The study also revealed that the support of family and friends was utilized as another critical coping strategy to help aid divorcees in their transition <b>to</b> post <b>divorce</b> life. In addition, the findings of the study suggested that divorced participants, particularly females, were quite resilient in overcoming financial hardship, single parenting, loneliness, and abandonment. This study’s results suggest that social workers need to be more knowledgeable about and equipped to provide adequate support and therapy <b>to</b> <b>divorced</b> persons’ post‑divorcé adjustment challenges. Another practice recommendation is that social workers should play a critical role in developing and facilitating a support group to help divorcees that are transitioning post‑divorce. In addition, special attention should be paid to provide additional help and support services for men who suffer mental and emotional effects of divorce transition...|$|R
