5|$|Creationists {{argue against}} {{evolution}} {{on the grounds}} that it cannot explain certain non-evolutionary processes, such as abiogenesis, the Big Bang, or the meaning of life. In such instances, evolution is being redefined to refer to the entire history of the universe, and it is argued <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>one</b> aspect of the universe is seemingly inexplicable, the entire body of scientific theories must be baseless. At this point, objections leave the arena of evolutionary biology and become general scientific or philosophical disputes.|$|E
5|$|William Lane Craig criticised Oppy's {{study as}} too vague for useful classification. Craig argued that an {{argument}} can be classified as ontological if it attempts to deduce the existence of God, along with other necessary truths, from his definition. He suggested that proponents of ontological arguments would claim <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> <b>one</b> fully understood the concept of God, one must accept his existence. William L. Rowe defined ontological arguments as those that start from the definition of God and, using only a priori principles, conclude with God's existence.|$|E
5|$|In {{these early}} days we {{explored}} {{all sorts of}} power reactors, comparing {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of each type. The number of possibilities was enormous, since there are many possibilities for each component of a reactor—fuel, coolant, moderator. The fissile material may be 233U, 235U, or 239Pu; the coolant may be: water, heavy water, gas, or liquid metal; the moderator may be: water, heavy water, beryllium, graphite—or, in a fast- neutron reactor, no moderator. I have calculated <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> <b>one</b> counted all the combinations of fuel, coolant, and moderator, one could identify about a thousand distinct reactors. Thus, at the very beginning of nuclear power, we had to choose which possibilities to pursue, which to ignore.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the best}} sermons I have ever been privileged to hear was by the late Bishop of Winchester. Social exclusion? He said {{virtually}} <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>one</b> sheep from a flock of 100 goes missing, the good shepherd worries frantically about that single sheep until it is safely found. There are too many sheep, men, women and children, being marginalised. John the Baptist had the answer: why do we not?

5|$|The Protocols of the Elders of Zion is an antisemitic canard, {{originally}} published in Russian in 1903, alleging a Judeo-Masonic conspiracy to achieve world domination. The text purports to be the minutes of the secret meetings of a cabal of Jewish masterminds, which has co-opted Freemasonry and is plotting to rule the world {{on behalf of all}} Jews because they believe themselves to be the chosen people of God. The Protocols incorporate many of the core conspiracist themes outlined in the Robison and Barruel attacks on the Freemasons, and overlay them with antisemitic allegations about anti-Tsarist movements in Russia. The Protocols reflect themes similar to more general critiques of Enlightenment liberalism by conservative aristocrats who support monarchies and state religions. The interpretation intended by the publication of The Protocols is <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>one</b> peels away the layers of the Masonic conspiracy, past the Illuminati, one finds the rotten Jewish core.|$|E

5|$|After {{unearthing}} {{an ancient}} crossbow device from a house's garden in Haichow, Jiangsu, Shen {{discovered that the}} cross-wire grid sighting device, marked in graduated measurements on the stock, {{could be used to}} calculate the height of a distant mountain {{in the same way that}} mathematicians could apply right-angle triangles to measure height. Needham asserts Shen had discovered the survey device known as Jacob's staff, which was not described elsewhere until the Provençal Jewish mathematician Levi ben Gerson (1288–1344) wrote of it in 1321. Shen wrote that while viewing the whole of a mountain, the distance on the instrument was long, but while viewing a small part of the mountainside the distance was short due to the device's cross piece that had to be pushed further away from the observer's eye, with the graduation starting on the further end. He wrote <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>one</b> placed an arrow on the device and looked past its end, the degree of the mountain could be measured and thus its height could be calculated.|$|E
5|$|Jacob's staff: The Song Dynasty (960–1279) {{scholar and}} {{politician}} Shen Kuo (1031–1095), an antiquarian who pursued studies of archaeological finds, unearthed an ancient crossbow-like mechanism from a garden in Jiangsu which had on its stock a graduated sighting scale in minute measurements. He wrote that while viewing {{the whole of}} a mountain, the distance on the instrument was long, but while viewing {{a small part of}} the mountainside the distance was short due to the device's cross piece that had to be pushed further away from the observer's eye, with the graduation starting on the further end. He wrote <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>one</b> placed an arrow on the device and looked past its end, the degree of the mountain could be measured and thus its height could be calculated. Shen wrote that this was similar to mathematicians who used right-angled triangles to measure height. Joseph Needham writes that what Shen had discovered was Jacob's staff, a surveying tool which was not known in Europe until the medieval French Jewish mathematician Levi ben Gerson (1288–1344) described it in 1321.|$|E
