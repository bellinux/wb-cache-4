5|$|The cockroach's {{ability to}} {{withstand}} radiation better <b>than</b> <b>human</b> beings {{can be explained}} through the cell cycle. Cells are most vulnerable {{to the effects of}} radiation when they are dividing. A cockroach's cells divide only once each time it molts, which is weekly at most in a juvenile roach. Since not all cockroaches would be molting at the same time, many would be unaffected by an acute burst of radiation, but lingering radioactive fallout would still be harmful.|$|E
5|$|At the morgue, Scully {{explains}} that {{she studied the}} bite wounds and discovered that they are similar, but intrinsically different, <b>than</b> <b>human</b> bites; the saliva on the regurgitated fingers has anti-coagulants in it, which only bats have in their saliva. Doggett finds the evidence interesting, due to the newspaper article he brought Scully: in 1956, a series of deaths was reported that ended {{when a group of}} hunters killed a man-bat creature and brought it to the county morgue in part of Montana. The coroner said the creature was neither bat nor man. Then the coroner was killed a few days later and soon after a few more people were killed or disappeared.|$|E
50|$|The Minbari {{physically}} {{have more}} stamina <b>than</b> <b>humans,</b> and can sustain injuries {{that would be}} fatal to a human. They are physically stronger <b>than</b> <b>humans,</b> as demonstrated by Lennier lifting a human male by the neck with one arm in one episode. Their headbone protects their cranium and brain from impacts that would be fatal to other races. Minbari can also tolerate a much greater blood loss <b>than</b> <b>humans</b> can. Dr. Franklin of Babylon 5 theorized that {{this was one of}} the reasons why the Minbari were so successful in the Earth-Minbari War - they could survive injuries and battle wounds that would kill or incapacitate a human, and they could keep fighting longer <b>than</b> most <b>human</b> soldiers could.|$|R

5|$|Traveling back to Spain {{to recruit}} more missionaries, he {{continued}} lobbying for {{the abolition of}} the encomienda, gaining an important victory by the passing of the New Laws in 1542. He was appointed Bishop of Chiapas, but served only for a short time before he was forced to return to Spain because of resistance to the New Laws by the encomenderos, and conflicts with Spanish settlers because of his pro-Indian policies and activist religious stances. The remainder of his life was spent at the Spanish court where he held great influence over Indies-related issues. In 1550, he participated in the Valladolid debate in which Juan Ginés de Sepúlveda argued that the Indians were less <b>than</b> <b>human</b> and required Spanish masters in order to become civilized. Las Casas maintained that they were fully human and that forcefully subjugating them was unjustifiable.|$|E
5|$|Ninja Gaiden was Team Ninja's first action title. Its initial concept {{had nothing}} in common with the {{original}} Ninja Gaiden series that was released for the NES. However, for retail reasons Tecmo wanted to retain a link with the previous games, which had many adherents in the West, so Itagaki was asked to rethink his ideas to target the foreign market. Analysing the earlier games, he concluded that their violence appealed to players, and included gory content, such as beheadings, in the Xbox game to retain that spirit. He also aimed to make his new game hard but alluring; it would challenge players on their reflexes rather than on their memories of layouts and timings. His team made a point of designing smoothly-flowing gameplay with high-quality animations that reacted quickly to the player's input. Itagaki paid homage to the earlier Ninja Gaiden series by including updated versions of foes and special attacks. Team Ninja based their 3D computer models, from the pistols of the henchman upwards, on real world material. Character models were taken from studies of human anatomy, and the team hired martial artists in order to digitally capture their movement. Rather than import the motion captures directly into the game, however, the animators used them as templates to give a sense of realism to the game characters' exaggerated movements. Itagaki found it more interesting to design nonhuman creatures <b>than</b> <b>human</b> enemies.|$|E
25|$|Human milk {{is rich in}} choline, but {{formulas}} {{derived from}} other sources, particularly soy, have lower total choline concentrations <b>than</b> <b>human</b> milk. Bovine milk and bovine-derived formulas had similar or higher glycerophosphocholine compared to human milk, and soy-derived formulas had lower glycerophosphocholine content. Phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin concentrations were similar between bovine formulas and human milk, but soy-derived infant formulas had more phosphatidylcholine <b>than</b> <b>human</b> or bovine sources. Soy-derived formulas had less sphingomyelin <b>than</b> <b>human</b> milk, which is a concern, since sphingomyelin is used for producing myelin, which insulates neurons. Free choline concentrations in mature human milk were 30–80% lower than those found in bovine milk or formulas. Mature human milk also has lower free choline than colostrum-transitional human milk. Phosphocholine is particularly abundant in human milk.|$|E

25|$|Unlike the chattel {{slavery in}} the antebellum {{southern}} United States (which is predominantly non-Catholic except Louisiana, the Mobile area in Alabama, and the Latino community), where slaves were often considered less <b>than</b> <b>human,</b> the law in Latin American countries gave slaves legal rights.

25|$|In Ojibwe, Eastern Cree, Westmain Swampy Cree, Naskapi, and Innu lore, wendigos {{are often}} {{described}} as giants, many times larger <b>than</b> <b>human</b> beings (a characteristic absent from the myth in the other Algonquian cultures). Whenever a wendigo ate another person, it would grow {{in proportion to the}} meal it had just eaten, so that it could never be full. Therefore, wendigos are portrayed as simultaneously gluttonous and emaciated from starvation.|$|E
25|$|From the Renaissance onwards, {{elaborate}} {{variations on}} the Green Man theme, often with animal heads rather <b>than</b> <b>human</b> faces, appear in many media other than carvings (including manuscripts, metalwork, bookplates, and stained glass).

25|$|In addition, prehistoric {{fossils of}} similar owls have been {{recovered}} from many islands in the Caribbean (Barbuda, Cayman Islands, Jamaica, Mona Island, and Puerto Rico).

25|$|Antithrombin {{has been}} {{isolated}} from the plasma {{of a large number}} of species additional to humans. As deduced from protein and cDNA sequencing, cow, sheep, rabbit and mouse antithrombins are all 433 amino acids in length, which is one amino acid longer <b>than</b> <b>human</b> antithrombin. The extra amino acid is thought to occur at amino acid position 6. Cow, sheep, rabbit, mouse, and human antithrombins share between 84 and 89% amino acid sequence identity. Six of the amino acids form three intramolecular disulfide bonds, Cys8-Cys128, Cys21-Cys95, and Cys248-Cys430.|$|E

50|$|Also {{known as}} elves, the Westfolk {{physically}} resemble humans in most respects, although {{they can be}} distinguished by their pointed and furled ears, {{as well as their}} eyes which have catlike irises. The Westfolk are longer-lived <b>than</b> <b>humans,</b> with a lifespan measured in centuries, but have fewer children <b>than</b> <b>humans</b> do. The Westfolk also have sharper vision <b>than</b> <b>humans,</b> being able to see clearly in very low light. Another major difference is that the Westfolk remain youthfully vigorous for most of their adult lives, and begin to age only near the end of their lives. The Westfolk are cross-fertile with humans, and the children of such unions generally resemble <b>humans</b> more <b>than</b> elves, although they may exhibit some elvish traits (slightly sharp ears, an extended lifespan, and a long period of youthful vigor).|$|R
25|$|Superhuman stories {{address the}} {{emergence}} of humans who have abilities beyond the normal.

25|$|The Naked Ladies are {{a statue}} complex on a rockery and water cascade {{in the gardens}} of York House, Twickenham, in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames, England.
