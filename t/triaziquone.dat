40|$|Ten widely {{different}} chemicals, actinomycin D, mithramycin, podophyllotoxin, vincristine sulfate, <b>triaziquone,</b> chlorambucil, mercaptopurine riboside, methyl-mercaptopurine riboside, dimethylsulfoxide, and L-lysine {{were tested}} in the whole mouse embryo culture system. The highest concentration was always the concentration that induced 100 % lethality (ELC 100). The lowest concentration varied from 1 / 2 to 1 / 10 of the ELC 100. The chemicals that had the most noxious effect on embryonic growth and differentiation were actinomycin D, <b>triaziquone,</b> and mercaptopurine riboside. Podophyllotoxin, methyl-mercaptopurine riboside, and L-lysine were the less embryotoxic. As a whole, no significant discrepancies were observed between the results and the teratological data obtained from the literature. These observations support {{the assumption that the}} whole murine embryo culture system can give valuable information on the teratogenicity of chemicals...|$|E
40|$|A {{method is}} {{described}} {{to restrict the}} spermatocyte population in mice and other rodents using hydroxyurea (HU) and <b>triaziquone</b> (T). HU affects cells in S-phase, whereas T is an agent especially active on spermatogonia and not on spermatocytes. An application of three i. p. HU injections with 12 h intervals, followed about nine days later by one i. p. T injection creates two large gaps in the spermatogenic line. The two gaps enclose a small, well-defined group of primary spermatocytes in meiotic interphase. - The development of the restricted spermatocyte population is followed day by day. The analysis of meiosis in male mice has revealed the correct sequence of meiotic, and especially prophase I stages. On account of clearly visible differences in chromosome morphology the diplotene stage could be divided into three periods. It is suggested to use the following nomenclature: pre-diffuse diplotene, diffuse diplotene and post-difuse diplotene. The experiment was also informative {{about the timing of}} the stages in spermatocyte development by correlating the days at which the successive stages were observed with the corresponding stage of the epithelial cycle. The calculation of the position and duration of the diffuse diplotene, enables us to put forward a proposal about the significance of the diffuse diplotene. - A combination of the HU/T method with cell separation techniques provides good perspectives for detailed biochemical studies on processes taking place during meiosi...|$|E
40|$|Aziridine-containing {{compounds}} {{have been}} of interest as anticancer agents since late 1970 s. The design, synthesis and study of <b>triaziquone</b> (TZQ) analogues {{with the aim of}} obtaining compounds with enhanced efficacy and reduced toxicity are an ongoing research effort in our group. A series of bis-type TZQ derivatives has been prepared and their cytotoxic activities were investigated. The cytotoxicity of these bis-type TZQ derivatives were tested on three cancer lines, including breast cancer (BC-M 1), oral cancer (OEC-M 1), larynx epidermal cancer (Hep 2) and one normal skin fibroblast (SF). Most of these synthetic derivatives displayed significant cytotoxic activities against human carcinoma cell lines, but weak activities against SF. Among tested analogues the bis-type TZQ derivative 1 a showed lethal effects on larynx epidermal carcinoma cells (Hep 2), with an LC 50 value of 2. 02 mM, and also weak cytotoxic activity against SF cells with an LC 50 value over 10 mM for 24 hr treatment. Comparing the viability of normal fibroblast cells treated with compound 1 a and TZQ, the LC 50 value of the latter was 2. 52 mM, indicating more toxicity than compound 1 a. This significantly decreased cytotoxicity of compound 1 a towards normal SF cells, while still maintaining the anticancer activity towards Hep 2 cells is an interesting feature. Among the seven compounds synthesized, compound 1 c has similar toxicity effects on the three cancer cell lines and SF normal cells as the TZQ monomer...|$|E
