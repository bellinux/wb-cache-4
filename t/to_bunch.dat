5|$|Zinfandel vines {{are quite}} {{vigorous}} and grow best in climates that are warm {{but not too}} hot, because grapes may shrivel in hot weather. Zinfandel's thin-skinned grapes grow in large, tight bunches that are sometimes prone <b>to</b> <b>bunch</b> rot. The fruit ripen fairly early and produce juice with high sugar content. If weather conditions permit, the grapes may be late-harvested to make dessert wine. Zinfandel is often praised {{for its ability to}} reflect both its terroir and its winemaker's style and skill.|$|E
25|$|All cavity {{magnetrons}} {{consist of}} a heated cathode placed at a high (continuous or pulsed) negative potential created by a high-voltage, direct-current power supply. The cathode {{is placed in the}} center of an evacuated, lobed, circular chamber. A magnetic field parallel to the filament is imposed by a permanent magnet. The magnetic field causes the electrons, attracted to the (relatively) positive outer part of the chamber, to spiral outward in a circular path, a consequence of the Lorentz force. Spaced around the rim of the chamber are cylindrical cavities. Slots are cut {{along the length of the}} cavities that open into the central, common cavity space. As electrons sweep past these slots, they induce a high-frequency radio field in each resonant cavity, which in turn causes the electrons <b>to</b> <b>bunch</b> into groups. (This principle of cavity resonator is very similar to blowing a stream of air across the open top of a glass pop bottle.) A portion of the radio frequency energy is extracted by a short antenna that is connected to a waveguide (a metal tube, usually of rectangular cross section). The waveguide directs the extracted RF energy to the load, which may be a cooking chamber in a microwave oven or a high-gain antenna in the case of radar.|$|E

500|$|In front {{tracking}} {{methods for}} curve shortening, the curve undergoing the evolution is discretized as a polygon. The {{finite difference method}} is used to derive formulas for the approximate normal vector and curvature at each vertex of the polygon, and these values are used {{to determine how to}} move each vertex in each time step. Although the curve-shortening flow is defined by the motion of a curve perpendicularly to itself, some parameterizations of the curve-shortening flow may allow the vertices that approximate the curve to move non-perpendicularly. In effect, this allows the vertices to move along the curve, as the curve evolves. Choosing a careful reparameterization can help redistribute the vertices more evenly along the curve in situations where perpendicular motion would cause them <b>to</b> <b>bunch</b> up. [...] write that these methods are fast and accurate but that it is much more complicated to extend them to versions of the curve-shortening flow that apply to more complicated inputs than simple closed curves, where it is necessary to deal with singularities and changes of topology.|$|E

40|$|We {{recently}} used an rf solenoid {{to study}} the widths of rf spin resonances with both unbunched and bunched beams of 2. 1 GeV_c polarized protons stored in the COSY synchrotron. A map, with unbunched beam at different fixed rf-solenoid frequencies, showed a very shallow possible depolarization dip at the resonance. Next we made frequency sweeps of 400 Hz, centered at similar frequencies, which greatly enhanced the dip. But, with a bunched proton beam, both the fixed-frequency and frequency-sweep techniques produced similar maps, and both bunched maps showed full beam depolarization over a wide region. Moreover, both were {{more than twice as}} wide as the unbunched dip.

2500|$|The {{leaves of}} Pinot Noir are {{generally}} smaller {{than those of}} Cabernet Sauvignon or Syrah. The Pinot vine is typically less vigorous than either of these varieties. The grape cluster is small and conico-cylindrical; shaped like a pine cone. Some viticultural historians believe this shape similarity may {{have given rise to}} the name. In the vineyard Pinot Noir is sensitive to wind and frost, cropping levels (it must be low yielding for production of quality wines), soil types and pruning techniques. In the winery it is sensitive to fermentation methods, yeast strains and is highly reflective of its terroir with different regions sometimes producing very different wines. Its thin skin makes it susceptible <b>to</b> <b>bunch</b> rot and similar fungal diseases. The vines themselves are susceptible to powdery mildew, especially in Burgundy infection by leaf roll and fanleaf viruses causes significant vine health problems. These complications have given the grape a reputation for being difficult to grow: Jancis Robinson calls Pinot a [...] "minx of a vine" [...] and Andr√© Tchelistcheff declared that [...] "God made Cabernet Sauvignon whereas the devil made Pinot Noir." [...] It is much less tolerant of harsh vineyard conditions than the likes of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Merlot or Grenache.|$|E

The British got into the German front trench with seconds to spare and the remnants of the front position except for Nameless Farm captured. The Germans in the third trench had been able to emerge from shelter and were overrun by rifle fire and rushes by parties, troops moving up communication trenches eventually overcoming the defenders but Nameless Farm was never captured. The farm cellars had been fortified and with shell-hole positions and part of a trench behind, the garrison held out, tired the attackers and reduced their supply of grenades.|$|E

60|$|The firing became again tremendous, and {{the sound}} was even louder than during {{the attack on the}} zeriba. As each fresh {{battalion}} was brought into line the tumult steadily increased. The three leading brigades continued to advance westward in one long line looped up over Surgham Hill, and with the right battalion held back in column. As the forces gradually drew nearer, the possibility of the Dervishes penetrating the gap between Lewis and MacDonald presented itself, and the flank battalion was wheeled into line so as to protect the right flank. The aspect of the Dervish attack was at this moment most formidable. Enormous masses of men were hurrying towards the smoke-clouds that almost hid MacDonald. Other masses turned to meet the attack which was developing on their right. Within the angle formed by the three brigades facing west and MacDonald facing nearly south a great army of not fewer than 15,000 men was enclosed, like a flock of sheep in a fold, by the thin brown lines of the British and Egyptian brigades. As the 7th Egyptians, the right battalion of Lewis's brigade and nearest the gap between that unit and MacDonald, deployed to protect the flank, they became unsteady, began <b>to</b> <b>bunch</b> and waver, and actually made several retrograde movements. There was a moment of danger; but General Hunter, who was on the spot, himself ordered the two reserve companies of the 15th Egyptians under Major Hickman to march up behind them with fixed bayonets.

Had he {{the whole of the}} end plateau, and had he guns, he might hope to command the rest of the position. But he held only half the plateau, and at the further end of it the Boers were strongly entrenched. The Spion Kop mountain was really the salient or sharp angle of the Boer position, so that the British were exposed to a cross fire both from the left and right. Beyond were other eminences which sheltered strings of riflemen and several guns. The plateau which the British held was very much narrower than was usually represented in the press. In many places the possible front was {{not much more than a}} hundred yards wide, and the troops were compelled <b>to</b> <b>bunch</b> together, as there was not room for a single company to take an extended formation. The cover upon this plateau was scanty, far too scanty for the force upon it, and the shell fire--especially the fire of the pom-poms--soon became very murderous. To mass the troops under the cover of the edge of the plateau might naturally suggest itself, but with great tactical skill the Boer advanced line from Commandant Prinsloo's Heidelberg and Carolina commandos kept so aggressive an attitude that the British could not weaken the lines opposed to them. Their skirmishers were creeping round too in such a way that the fire was really coming from three separate points, left, centre, and right, and every corner of the position was searched by their bullets. Early in the action the gallant Woodgate and many of his Lancashire men were shot down. The others spread out and held on, firing occasionally at the whisk of a rifle-barrel or the glimpse of a broad-brimmed hat.|$|E
