5|$|At <b>times,</b> <b>when</b> a {{new king}} came to power, old stelae would be respectfully buried and {{replaced}} with new ones, or they might be broken. When a Maya city was invaded by a rival, it was pillaged by the victors.

At the end of the Preclassic, around 150 AD, this fate appears to have befallen the important city of El Mirador, where most of the stelae were found smashed.|$|E

5|$|Birds have {{featured}} in culture and art since prehistoric <b>times,</b> <b>when</b> they were represented in early cave paintings. Some birds have been perceived as monsters, including the mythological Roc and the Māori's legendary Pouākai, a giant bird capable of snatching humans. Birds were later used {{as symbols of}} power, as in the magnificent Peacock Throne of the Mughal and Persian emperors. With the advent of scientific interest in birds, many paintings of birds were commissioned for books.|$|E
5|$|Both Giovanni Borelli and Cassini made careful {{tables of}} {{the motions of}} Jupiter's moons, {{allowing}} predictions of the <b>times</b> <b>when</b> the moons would pass before or behind the planet. By the 1670s, {{it was observed that}} when Jupiter was {{on the opposite side of}} the Sun from Earth, these events would occur about 17minutes later than expected. Ole Rømer deduced that light does not travel instantaneously (a conclusion that Cassini had earlier rejected), and this timing discrepancy was used to estimate the speed of light.|$|E

5|$|Gibraltar's {{appearance}} in prehistory was very different.

5|$|In earlier <b>times,</b> <b>when</b> large {{populations of}} {{springbok}} roamed the Kalahari desert and Karoo, millions of migrating springbok formed herds hundreds of kilometres long {{that could take}} several days to pass a town. These mass treks, known as trekbokken in Afrikaans, took place during long periods of drought. Herds could efficiently retrace their paths to their territories after long migrations. Trekbokken is still observed occasionally in Botswana, though on a much smaller scale than earlier.|$|E
5|$|In the end, four {{broadband}} filters were chosen, centred at wavelengths of 300 nm (near-ultraviolet), 450nm (blue light), 606nm (red light) and 814nm (near-infrared). Because the quantum efficiency of Hubble's detectors is quite low at 300nm, the noise in observations at this wavelength is {{primarily due to}} CCD noise rather than sky background; thus, these observations could be conducted at <b>times</b> <b>when</b> high background noise would have harmed the efficiency of observations in other passbands.|$|E

Nowadays, American pop culture has a heavy hold on the Filipinos that evolved from the Spanish <b>times</b> <b>when</b> the American occupation happened. Along with Korean pop, these two are dominating the recent music scene in media. However, the revival of Spanish-influence folk music has been possible thanks to the different choir groups coming in and going out of the country, such as the Philippine Madrigal Singers.|$|E

After the birth of their daughter (Rhena Schweitzer Miller), Schweitzer was no longer able to live in Lambaréné owing to her health. In 1923 the family moved to Königsfeld im Schwarzwald, Baden-Württemberg, where Albert was building a house for the family. This house is now maintained as a Schweitzer museum.|$|E
