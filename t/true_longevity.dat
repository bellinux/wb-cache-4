40|$|Chantier qualité GAPiecewise Weibull {{proportional}} hazard {{models were}} used to investigate the effect of genetic and nongenetic factors on functional and <b>true</b> <b>longevity</b> traits of the Slovenian Brown cattle breed. Records of 37 908 Brown cows from 2401 Slovenian herds were used. As these herds were characterised by a relatively small average herd size starting from 6. 7 in 1999 and increasing to 8. 7 Brown cows per herd in 2008, milk yield classification was made within different herd size groups. The hazard rate was {{the lowest in the}} first part of each lactation and was increasing for later stages. Culling risk was lower for cows from herds increasing in size, for cows with higher milk production and for cows from a region with smaller herd sizes and tougher conditions for cattle breeding. The latter result is surprising and may be related to better attention to maintain the animals, despite their lower milk production. The introduction of the milk quota system and drought was found to have an important effect on culling policy between the last seasons of the years 2001 and 2003. Seasonal effects were not related to the milk quota year (from April to March), but to the effect of shortage in fodder during the winter time. The effect of age at first calving and the interaction between year and milk yield class were not found to be significant. Heritability for functional and for <b>true</b> <b>longevity</b> were similar at around 10 % each. Inclusion of a correction for class of milk yield to approximate functional longevity increased the herd-year random effect variance by 53 %, whereas the sire variance increased by only 14 %. The correlation coefficient between ranks of breeding values for functional and <b>true</b> <b>longevity</b> was high (0. 91), whereas genetic trends were not found to be significant. To assess their predictive ability, models were compared looking at the survival rate of 4212 second-crop daughters not included in the initial models. The average correlation between estimated breeding values and survival at different stages was 0. 39 for <b>true</b> <b>longevity</b> and 0. 43 for functional longevity. Results showed that ranking milk yield at population level is appropriate to correct for voluntary culling on low production in small herds...|$|E

40|$|All {{information}} {{for this study}} was obtained by original source documents, interviews with the principal participants and the personal observations of the writer. A complete transcript of interviews with Daron Aric Hagen Michael Haithcockand Robert De Simone are included as appendices. In 1961 the College Band Directors National Association (CBDNA) created its commissioning project for the purpose of contracting prominent composers to contribute works of high quality to the growing wind repertoire. Recently, CBDNA commissioned works that sought to collaborate with other disciplines within the artistic community. These collaborative works added new depth to the wind repertoire and helped advance the genre to new levels of prominence. CBDNA commissioned Daron Aric Hagen to write an opera using winds in the pit. He titled the work Bandanna, based on Shakespeare's Othello. Hagen contracted Paul Muldoon to write the libretto. A consortium of 79 member schools contributed to the project. A total of 100, 000. 00 was paid to the composer. The Director of Bands at Baylor University conducted the premiere performance of Bandanna during the 1999 CBDNA convention on 25 February 1999. Hagen assigned instrumental, thematic and harmonic attributes to each character. There are literally thousands of interactions between these elements that weave a tight pattern of organic unity into the entire work, making it exceptionally rich with symbolism and innuendo. Though still in its infancy, the uniqueness of this work both {{in the manner in which}} it came into being and through its artistic merits are fascinating. Only the future will determine whether Bandanna has <b>true</b> <b>longevity</b> or will fade into the background as a historical curiosity...|$|E
40|$|The {{biological}} clock affects aging through ras- 1 (bd) and lag- 1, {{and these two}} longevity genes together affect a clock phenotype and the clock oscillator in Neurospora crassa. Using an automated cell-counting technique for measuring conidial longevity, we show that the clock-associated genes lag- 1 and ras- 1 (bd) are <b>true</b> chronological <b>longevity</b> genes. For example, wild type (WT) has an estimated median life span of 24 days, while the double mutant lag- 1, ras- 1 (bd) has an estimated median life span of 120 days for macroconidia. We estab-lish the biochemical function of lag- 1 by complementing LAG 1 and LAC 1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae with lag- 1 in N. crassa. Longevity genes can affect the clock as well in that, the double mutant lag- 1, ras- 1 (bd) can stop the circadian rhythm in asexual reproduction (i. e., banding in race tubes) and lengthen {{the period of the}} frequency oscillator to 41 h. In contrast to the ras- 1 (bd), lag- 1 effects on chronological longevity, we find that this double mutant undergoes replicative senescence (i. e., the loss of replication function with time), unlike WT or the single mutants, lag- 1 and ras- 1 (bd). These results support the hypothesis that sphingolipid metabolism links aging and the {{biological clock}} through a common stress respons...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{relationship}} between type traits and longevity was {{studied in the}} French Holstein breed using a survival analysis model. In this model, the phenotypic value adjusted for systematic fixed effects, the estimated breeding value, or the residual value (defined as {{the difference between the}} adjusted phenotypic value and the estimated breeding value) of the cow for each type trait was included as a risk factor. This was done separately for two subpopulations (registered and nonregistered herds) and with or without adjustment for production traits, i. e., considering <b>true</b> or functional <b>longevity.</b> For both types of herds, udder traits (and above all, udder depth) clearly influenced the length of productive life. There seemed to be a more pronounced voluntary culling on type traits in registered herds. The correction for the within herd-year class of production traits, as a way to approximate functional longevity, increased the importance of udder traits and decreased the weight of capacity traits. The same results were obtained when the phenotypic value of the cow for type was replaced by her estimated breeding value, whereas residuals had little impact. The {{relationship between}} longevity and type traits was most often nonlinear, in particular for udder traits, but in this study, no trait with a clear intermediate optimum was found. </p...|$|R
40|$|Sow longevity, or more {{accurately}} called sow productive life (SPL), {{has been a}} major focus point of concern in the swine industry for some time now. In addition to the animal and worker welfare concerns, industry leaders are realizing the substantial economical losses that occur when a farm has poor SPL in its commercial females. The economic benefits for increasing {{the average age of the}} females of reproductive age in the herd by one tenth of a parity are an additional $ 0. 23 and $ 0. 13 for every hog marketed in a farrow-tofinish and farrow-to-wean operations, respectively. Taken collectively, this sums up to over 15 million dollars in increased income in the US swine industry alone. Therefore even minor improvements to SPL can make an enormous impact of the financial bottom line for swine operations. Previous to this research, no studies have focused on the genes that play a pivotal role in SPL. Many researchers using model organisms such as nematodes, flies, and mice have shown a clear network of genes that play an integral role in increasing simple lifespan of these animals, primarily through a reduction in caloric intake or changes in the genes that mimic caloric restriction. These observations also hold <b>true</b> for human <b>longevity</b> studies. It is therefore our working hypothesis that these same genes may be involved in SPL. We realize that SPL and simple lifespan are not completely correlated. We are fully aware that in swine production thinner sows are typically culled earlier because they typically don’t have the body reserves to rely on during times of extreme nutrient requirements. We expect (and have encountered) alleles in these same genes from the model organisms that are associated with higher backfat to actually be the beneficial alleles for SPL. Our research has shown that there are several genes that can be selected for to improve the SPL of females at the commercial level...|$|R
40|$|Genetic {{parameters}} of longevity in crossbred mule ewes, and genetic relationships among longevity, growth, body composition, and subjectively assessed traits on mule lambs and ewes have been estimated using Bayesian linear censored models. Additionally, the genetic associations between longevity and culling reasons were examined. Data comprised 1, 797 observations of mule ewes for longevity, culling reasons, growth, body composition, mouth scores, and type traits. Longevity {{was defined as}} the time (in years) from 2 yr of age (the age at first lambing of most ewes) to culling or death. Censored data (i. e., observations for which only the lower bound of the <b>true</b> <b>longevity</b> is known, such as when the animals are still alive) comprised 24 % of all observations for longevity. Bivariate analyses were used to analyze the longevity of the ewe with each performance trait by fitting linear Bayesian models considering censored observations. Longevity was split into 3 different sub-traits: age at culling due to teeth/mouth conditions, age at culling due to udder conditions, and age at culling due to other culling reasons. These sub-traits and their aggregation into the overall trait of longevity were analyzed in a multiple-trait model. The heritability of longevity was moderate at 0. 27, whereas heritabilities of the growth and body composition traits ranged from 0. 11 for average of shoulder, loin, and gigot conformation to 0. 36 for ewe BW at first premating. Mouth scores and type traits had heritabilities ranging from 0. 13 for jaw position to 0. 39 for fleece quality. All analyzed traits showed low genetic correlations with longevity, ranging from – 0. 20 for average conformation scores in live animals to 0. 18 for tooth angle. Teeth/mouth conditions resulted in the greatest heritability (0. 15) among the sub-traits based on the separate culling reasons. Genetic correlations between separate culling reasons were low to high (0. 12 to 0. 63 for teeth/mouth conditions with udder conditions and other culling reasons, respectively). Longevity may be preferred as a selection criterion because of (i) its moderate heritability compared with its component sub-traits based on specific culling reasons, and (ii) its moderate to high genetic correlation with these component sub-traits. The moderate heritability for longevity reflects the potential of this trait for genetic improvement, especially when longevity is based on clearly defined culling reasons...|$|E

40|$|Financial {{services}} {{firms are}} in the business of accepting risks on behalf of their customers. To protect the customers' interests, firms are generally required by financial services regulators to back their risks using an adequate amount of capital. This capital is often termed as risk-based or economic capital. More formally, economic capital is the amount of capital required to ensure that a firm remains solvent, over a specified time horizon, wit h a prescribed probability. With the advent of Basel 2 and 3 for banks and Solvency 2 for insurers, it is apparent that the regulators are keen to move towards an economic capital framework for assessing the solvency of financial services firms. In a Solvency 2 world, or otherwise where there is a need to place the business on a risk-based platform, the value of quantifying business risks appro- ~_ priately is critical. Economic capital can be calculated in many different ways and the implications of choosing a particular approach can have far-reaching consequences for the underlying business. In this thesis, we demonstrate the implications of solvency on an annuity business based on different approaches to compute economic capital. Moreover, financial services firms are exposed to different sources of risks simultaneously. These risks are often correlated and the economic capital required to mitigate individual risks vary immensely. Identification of individual business risks lies at the heart of a risk management process. Thus: the quantification should be based on a sound mathematical footing and should be appropriate as well as practical. Recently, longevity risk has been a major concern for the UK annuity business. Current England and Wales mortality trends show that annuita. nts are living longer than expected. Historically~ actuaries have consistently underestimated the mortality improvements in the UK, as evident from the Continuous Mortality Investigation reports, which resulted in increasing unexpected cost of guarantees. Furthermore, for the upcoming Solvency 2 regime, latest quantitative impact studies by Financial Services Authority have shown that the annuity business is faced with higher economic capital requirement than the current regulations require. Given trus backdrop, for a proper risk-based assessment of annuity business, adequacy of economic capital and identifi- cation of its <b>true</b> <b>longevity</b> risk component becomes a necessity. We thus study economic capital and its different risk components by analysing the surplus/ deficits of these components arising over the time horizon under con- sideration. We found that for this class of business and under traditional investment strategies, longevity is a less prominent threat than market risk. Then we compare our results with the corresponding Solvency 2 capital requirements. Further, due to the existence of mutual dependencies, capital required to mitigate multiple risks rarely adds up to the total economic capital. Clearly, there are potentially huge benefits if financial services firms choose to diver- sify their business across risk profiles, business lines and geographies. We investigate how the component risks could be diversified based on the firm size, gender combinations, risk interactions and over different geographical locations, under various economic capital calculation approaches.
