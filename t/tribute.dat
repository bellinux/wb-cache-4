40|$|This {{work was}} {{designed}} to {{determine the influence of}} <b>tributes</b> on the optimum economical age of harvestingEucalyptus spp. stands, to determine the number of cuttings between the reform of Eucalyptus spp. stands, to determine and analyzethe contribution of <b>tributes</b> to the wood production costs. Many <b>tributes</b> are due on the forest sector. In this study, the tributesconsidered are the ones falling on the production of forest on products and services (TMS), income tax on businessoperation (ITJP), social raw material, not including, therefore, those which are due on industrialization. They are: forestrate (FR), cadastrum and registration rate (CRR), chainsaw record rate (MRR), chainsaw ownership tax (MPT), landownership tax (RTT), commercialization tax contribution on profit (SCP), contribution for financing of social security(CFSS), Contribution for the National Institute of Social Security (CNISS), contribution for the social integration program(CSIP), rural syndicate contribution (RSH). The criterion utilized to determine economic rotation and to determine theoptimum moment to renew the stand was the Net Present Value (NPV), considering an infinite planning horizon. The resultsobtained allowed to identify the ratio of the <b>tributes</b> in the total wood production cost [...] It was found that the optimumharvesting time, not considering the <b>tributes,</b> occurred at 7 years o age; considering all the <b>tributes,</b> the optimum age occurredat 8 years. By not considering <b>tributes</b> would cause to unduly anticipate the optimum harvesting age. The optimum momentto make the renewal of the stand, not considering the <b>tributes,</b> occurred at 21 years, after the third cutting. However,taking into account the <b>tributes,</b> it would occur at 32 years (after the fourth cutting). By not considering the effect oftributation would cause one to unduly antecipate the optimum time to renew the stand. Tributation stands for 37. 78 % ofwood production cost, i. e., taxes contribute with 3. 8 %, imposts with 25. 32 % and contributions with 8. 99 %...|$|R

5|$|By the 13th century, {{a need to}} formalize {{the border}} between the Novgorod Republic and the Scandinavian {{countries}} became evident. The Novgorodians, along with the Karelians who came from the south, reached the coast of what now is Pechengsky District and the portion of the coast of Varangerfjord near the Voryema River, which now is a part of Norway. The Sami population was forced to pay <b>tribute.</b> The Norwegians, however, were also attempting to take control of these lands, resulting in armed conflicts. In 1251, a conflict between the Karelians, Novgorodians and the servants of the king of Norway led to the establishment of a Novgorodian mission in Norway. Also in 1251, the first treaty with Norway was signed in Novgorod regarding the Sami lands and the system of <b>tribute</b> collections, making the Sami people pay <b>tribute</b> to both Novgorod and Norway. By the terms of the treaty, Novgorodians could collect <b>tribute</b> from the Sami as far as Lyngen fjord in the west, while Norwegians could collect <b>tribute</b> on the territory of the whole Kola Peninsula except {{in the eastern part of}} Tersky Coast.
