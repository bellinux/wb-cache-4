5|$|Sabah {{consists}} of five administrative divisions, {{which are in}} turn divided into 25 districts. For each district, the state government appoints a village headman (known as ketua kampung) for each village. The administrative divisions are inherited from the British administration, which are before administered as province. During the British rule, a Resident was appointed to govern each division and provided with a palace (Istana). The post of the Resident was abolished and replaced with district officers {{for each of the}} district when North Borneo became part of Malaysia. As in the rest of Malaysia, local government comes under the purview of state government. However, ever since the suspension of local government elections {{in the midst of the}} Malayan Emergency, which was much less intense in Sabah <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rest of the country, there have been no local elections.

5|$|The modern Norman Cob is {{slightly}} heavier <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early 20th century, due to lighter horses of the breed being {{absorbed into the}} Selle Francais breed. In 1976, the National Stud at Saint-Lo had 186 stallions, including 60 Norman Cobs. In the same year, the breed registry was reorganized, and the Norman Cob placed in the draft horse category. The reorganization of the breed registry helped to reinvigorate Norman Cob breeding, and to bring attention {{to the risk of}} extinction of the breed. In 1980, the Institut national de la recherche agronomique and Institut national agronomique performed demographic and genetic analysis of threatened breeds of horses within France. In 1982, researchers concluded that the Norman Cob has been inbred and suffered genetic drift from its original population. The increasing average age of Norman Cob breeders also made the breed's situation precarious.|$|E

25|$|Firstly, the International Court of Justice, {{prompted}} {{especially by}} New Zealand, has declared {{the deployment of}} nuclear weapons to be illegal.

25|$|Overdoses with {{lidocaine}} can be {{a result}} of excessive administration by topical or parenteral routes, accidental oral ingestion of topical preparations by children who are more susceptible to overdose, accidental intravenous (rather than subcutaneous, intrathecal, or paracervical) injection, or prolonged use of subcutaneous infiltration anesthesia during cosmetic surgical procedures. These occurrences have often led to severe toxicity or death in both children and adults. Lidocaine and its two major metabolites may be quantified in blood, plasma, or serum to confirm the diagnosis in potential poisoning victims or to assist in the forensic investigation in a case of fatal overdose. It is important in the interpretation of analytical results to recognize that lidocaine is often routinely administered intravenously as an antiarrhythmic agent in critical cardiac-care situations. Treatment with intravenous lipid emulsions (used for parental feeding) to reverse the effects of local anaesthetic toxicity is becoming more commonplace <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past.|$|E
25|$|The Egyptian {{government}} highly subsidizes the sector. The Egyptian Water Regulatory Agency {{estimates the}} degree of overall cost recovery in 2012/13 at 62%, and the recovery of {{operation and maintenance costs}} excluding depreciation at 76%. The regulator classifies this as insufficient compared to a good performance of more than 80% full cost recovery and more than 100% operation and maintenance cost recovery. This is lower than {{the degree of}} cost recovery achieved in 2010, when the recovery of operation and maintenance costs, excluding depreciation, through operating revenues was 95% for water supply and sanitation, ranging from 31% in Sinai to 134% in Beheira. Nevertheless, the degree of cost recovery is apparently higher <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early 2000s.

25|$|A {{traditional}} {{college football}} rivalry with the Nebraska Cornhuskers {{was much less}} intense during the Big 12 years <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Big 8 era. This was mainly due to the split-division nature of the Big 12 that only allowed the teams to play each other twice every four years. Prior to this, these teams were involved in several historic match-ups, including the Game of the Century and the so-called Game of the New Century where the teams have come into the game ranked one and two in the Associated Press Poll, making the games of great importance in deciding the national championship. Historically, the rivalry's most distinguishing quality has been the grudging respect and appreciation between the two tradition-rich programs. Also of note is the game's former status as the premier Thanksgiving Day game for {{the middle of the}} country. The Sooners and Cornhuskers went head-to-head in the 2006 Big 12 Championship Game, with Oklahoma winning the conference title by the score of 21–7. The two teams also met in the 2010 Big 12 Championship Game, with Oklahoma again the victor in a close game by a score of 23–20.

25|$|Interstate {{football}} was less popular in Victoria <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> other states. A match in Victoria in 1989 against South Australia set the national interstate football record crowd of 91,960, with 10,000 people turned {{away at the}} gate. Other large crowds at interstate games in Victoria were between 60,000 and 70,000, on par with some large home-and-away games but lower than a typical finals attendance. At its lowest, interstate games in Victoria during the 1930s could sometimes fail to draw 10,000 spectators – less than the average home-and-away crowd – {{at a time when}} state record crowds were drawn to the matches elsewhere. Eventually, due to these lower levels of public interest, less interstate football came to be played in Victoria: and {{for the majority of the}} 1980s, when State of Origin {{football was}} at its peak, the Victorian team did not play a single match at home. The primary reason for the difference in popularity between Victoria and the other states was the Victorian team's historical dominance in interstate football. Particularly during the pre-State of Origin era, the Victorian team was always expected to win and regularly won easily; therefore, Victorian spectators were disinclined to attend matches because there was little pride on offer for victory and a high chance of a one-sided contest. The record crowd of 91,960 in Melbourne in 1989 came after South Australia had beaten Victoria three years in a row, demonstrating that Victorian fans were willing to embrace interstate football when the rivalry and contests were closely fought. Additionally, differences in supporter culture between the states meant that club football and club parochialism had much greater importance in Victoria than in the other states.|$|E
