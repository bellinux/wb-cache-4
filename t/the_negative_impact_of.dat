5|$|Because {{of their}} abundance, seamounts {{are one of}} the most common marine {{ecosystems}} in the world. Interactions between seamounts and underwater currents, as well as their elevated position in the water, attract plankton, corals, fish, and marine mammals alike. Their aggregational effect has been noted by the commercial fishing industry, and many seamounts support extensive fisheries. There are ongoing concerns on <b>the</b> <b>negative</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> fishing on seamount ecosystems, and well-documented cases of stock decline, for example with the orange roughy (Hoplostethus atlanticus). 95% of ecological damage is done by bottom trawling, which scrapes whole ecosystems off seamounts.|$|E

25|$|The {{opposition}} to Kenya's action was criticised {{by some other}} TFG officials, militia allied to the TFG, and many ordinary Somalis.

Protests reportedly {{took place in the}} towns of Dhobley, Tabto and Qoqani, areas where Kenyan troops had passed through.

25|$|Another {{remedy that}} Singapore courts might apply if an {{appropriate}} case arises – {{though it has}} yet to do so – is the granting of temporary validity to unconstitutional laws.

The situation is exacerbated if the legislation is one with far-reaching effects. Hence, to overcome <b>the</b> <b>negative</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> such a lacuna, the Supreme Court of Canada has adopted the remedy of granting temporary validity to unconstitutional legislation for the minimum time necessary for the legislature to enact alternative laws.|$|E

25|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that religiosity {{can be a}} pathway to both mental health and mental disorder. For example, religiosity is positively associated with mental disorders that involve an excessive amount of self-control and negatively associated with mental disorders that involve a lack of self-control. Other studies have found indications of mental health among both the religious and the secular. For instance, Vilchinsky & Kravetz found negative correlations with psychological distress among religious and secular subgroups of Jewish students. In addition, intrinsic religiosity has been inversely related to depression in the elderly, while extrinsic religiosity has no relation or even a slight positive relation to depression. Religiosity {{has been found to}} mitigate <b>the</b> <b>negative</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> injustice and income inequality on life satisfaction.|$|E
25|$|Evidence {{points to}} <b>the</b> <b>negative</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> hegemonic masculinity on men's {{health-related}} behavior, with American men making 134.5million fewer physician visits per year than women.

Twenty-five percent of men aged 45 to 60 {{do not have a}} personal physician, increasing their risk of death from heart disease. Men between 25 and 65 are four times more likely to die from cardiovascular disease than women, {{and are more likely to}} be diagnosed with a terminal illness because of their reluctance to see a doctor. Reasons cited for not seeing a physician include fear, denial, embarrassment, a dislike of situations out of their control and the belief that visiting a doctor is not worth the time or cost.|$|E
25|$|In 2000, the {{government}} of Vietnam submitted a revised nomination with a much larger area. At this time, however, the National Assembly and government of Vietnam also {{announced that it would}} be constructing the north-south Hồ Chí Minh Highway and a link road between the Highway and Route 20 that bisects part of the core area of the Phong Nha Nature Reserve. The news of this road construction raised concern over its impacts on the Phong Nha Nature Reserve, and many international organization like IUCN, Flora and Fauna International called on Vietnamese government to reconsider its plan. They also advised of <b>the</b> <b>negative</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> these road and construction activities on biodiversity. Due to this plan of road construction, the evaluation bureau did not proceed further consideration of nomination from Vietnamese government at that time. The government of Vietnam provided the bureau with additional information in May 2002, announcing the decision of the Prime Minister of Vietnam (December 2001) on upgrading Phong Nha–Kẻ Bàng to the Phong Nha–Kẻ Bàng National Park with a total area of 857.54km2; providing information on projects for the conservation and development of the park and revised maps.

500|$|In {{a report}} {{published}} by the Center for American Progress summarizing the research on [...] "The Real Impact of Native Mascots and Team Names on American Indian and Alaska Native Youth", a case is made that the public debate misses the point, since individual opinions on either side do not matter given the measurable effects on {{the mental health of}} Native American young people exposed to such misrepresentations of their ethnic identity, and the often hostile or insulting behavior of non-natives that occur when teams with such names and mascots play. Clinical Psychologist Michael Friedman writes that the use of Native imagery, in particular the use of a dictionary defined slur, is a form of bullying, <b>the</b> <b>negative</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> which is magnified by its being officially sanctioned.|$|E
500|$|As a ghost story, {{the film}} delves into a {{relationship}} between a spirit and a living person, which runs contrary to nature and {{will lead to the}} death of the person. Although ghosts are not mentioned in the initial parts of the film, Japanese writer Kazushi Hosaka stated Mizoguchi foreshadowed it using the scenery, which suggests a detachment from real life. The scene where the protagonists cross Lake Biwa is an example, given the fogs that turn the film away from the jidaigeki genre. Professor Robin Wood argues that the film's depiction of the main ghost character evolves from the mere demon of [...] "The Lust of the White Serpent" [...] into the more humane and tragic Lady Wakasa, and this makes the story more complex. Wood further opines the combination of the story with [...] "The House in the Thicket," [...] combining the male protagonist of each tale into one character, Genjurō, also connects the demon character and the ghost wife. Both Lady Wakasa and Miyagi are killed by a male-dominated society, and both are wronged by Genjurō. Wood believes Ugetsu can be considered a feminist film for its exploration of <b>the</b> <b>negative</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> a patriarchy.|$|E
