5|$|In the meantime, on the Roman left wing, Severus {{must have}} {{suspected}} the prepared ambush, and held back from advancing into the woods, according to Ammianus. Libanius contradicts this, {{claiming that the}} Romans charged <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> <b>and</b> flushed {{them out of their}} hiding places. But Ammianus' version is more likely, as the Romans would hardly have benefited from advancing straight into a prepared trap. Ammianus does not report further action in this sector. But {{it is likely that the}} hidden Germans eventually lost patience, advanced out of the woods and charged at Severus' division, only to be routed by Severus' crack troops.|$|E
5|$|New Jersey {{provided}} artillery {{support for}} a major air and surface strike on Wonsan 1 May, as 7th Fleet planes both attacked <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> <b>and</b> spotted for the battleship. She knocked out eleven Communist shore guns that day, and four days later destroyed the key observation post {{on the island of}} Hodo Pando, commanding the harbor. Two days later Kalmagak at Wonsan was her target.|$|E

For this major contribution to his country, George received the Distinguished Service Medal, Legion of Merit, Distinguished Flying Cross, and Air Medal, as well as decorations from Great Britain, France, Brazil, Peru and China.|$|E
5|$|On September 15, Howe landed {{his army}} in an amphibious {{operation}} at Kip's Bay, {{on the eastern}} shore of Manhattan, along the East River. After a bombardment of the American positions on the shore, 4,000 British and Hessian troops landed, and they fought the Battle of Kip's Bay. The American troops began to flee at the sight of <b>the</b> <b>enemy,</b> <b>and</b> even after Washington arrived on the scene and took immediate command, demanding that his soldiers fight, they refused to obey orders and continued to flee.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the summer}} of 1916, Michael's corps was {{involved}} in the Brusilov Offensive. The Guards Army suffered heavy losses under the incompetent leadership of Michael's uncle, Grand Duke Paul, who was removed from command. In contrast, Michael was awarded a second gallantry medal, the Order of St. Vladimir with Swords, for his part in actions against <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> <b>and</b> was belatedly made an adjutant-general. The poor progress of the war and their almost constant separation depressed both Michael and Natalia. Michael was still suffering from stomach ulcers and, in October 1916, he was ordered to take leave in the Crimea.|$|E

5|$|With Admiral Arthur W. Radford, Commander in Chief Pacific Fleet, and Vice Admiral C. Turner Joy, Commander Naval Forces Far East aboard, New Jersey bombarded targets at Wonsan 4 June. At Kansong {{two days}} later she fired her main battery at an {{artillery}} regiment and truck encampment, with 7th Fleet aircraft spotting targets and reporting successes. On 28 July off Wonsan the battleship was again taken under fire by shore batteries. Several near misses splashed to port, but New Jerseys precision fire silenced <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> <b>and</b> destroyed several gun emplacements.|$|E
5|$|By this point, the British {{high command}} had {{realised}} {{that they could}} not hold the Germans in southern Norway. The evacuation of Allied troops from Molde and Åndalsnes began, with Ark Royal providing air cover from 30 April. On 1 May, the Germans tried to sink the carrier, with numerous air attacks through the day. Ark Royals fighters and a heavy anti-aircraft barrage drove off <b>the</b> <b>enemy,</b> <b>and</b> although several bombs were dropped at the carrier, none impacted. The evacuation was completed on 3 May, and the carrier was recalled to Scapa Flow to refuel and rearm before returning to Norway. While in port, Captain Arthur Power left the ship for a promotion to the Admiralty, and was replaced by Captain Cedric Holland. On return to Norway, Ark Royal was told to provide air cover for operations around Narvik, including the landing of French troops on 13 May. She was joined on 18 May by the carriers Glorious and Furious.|$|E
5|$|Cunningham was {{promoted}} to flight lieutenant on 12 March 1940. In April 1940 the squadron flew as escort for a De Havilland Flamingo carrying Winston Churchill, First Lord of the Admiralty, to Paris to attend a meeting after the German invasion of Denmark and Norway. Most of the unit's time during the Phoney War was consumed engaging in intensive training over the Wash which included co-operation with searchlights and mine-laying operations. It did not last for long. On 15 May 1940, 604 relocated to RAF Manston. From the airfield Cunningham flew sorties over the English Channel and patrols over Dunkirk as the Battle for France intensified. Cunningham made no recorded contact with <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> <b>and</b> France capitulated on 25 June 1940.|$|E

Finally, {{he was accused of}} Gunnar Eilifsen's murder. Whilst not contesting the key facts, he denied all charges on the grounds that he had always worked for a free and prosperous Norway, and submitted a sixty-page response. On 11 July, a further indictment was brought, adding a raft of new charges, including more murders, theft, embezzlement and, most worrying of all for Quisling, the charge of conspiring with Hitler over the 9 April occupation of Norway.|$|E
5|$|Metroid: Other M is {{the first}} game in the Metroid series to feature melee attacks. With well-timed button presses, players can use special techniques, such as the Sense Move, which allows them to dodge enemy attacks, and the Overblast, where Samus jumps on <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> <b>and</b> fires a charged shot at point-blank range. Unlike other Metroid games, enemies do not drop items, with the {{restoration}} of health and ammo occurring either by using the Navigation Booths, or employing of the Concentration technique, where Samus rests and replenishes missiles and health. Players can also use the Navigation Booths to save their progress. While there are power-ups scattered around the Bottle Ship, a few items are already equipped by Samus, but she agrees to wait to use them until commanding officer Adam Malkovich authorizes her to do so. Players can find items that will augment Samus's abilities, such as Energy and Missile Tanks.|$|E
5|$|Myers made eleven {{hydrogen}} balloons for the Navy for Admiral Francis J. Higginson in 1902 for {{a military}} exercise. Ten of the balloons were six feet in diameter and used for signaling purposes that troops were nearby. The eleventh balloon of 12,000 cubic feet capacity was twenty-eight-feet in diameter. It was capable of carrying two men and all their associated observation equipment. It {{was used by the}} Signal Corps for a high altitude observation platform to monitor enemy warships. This balloon was tethered to and controlled by a Navy ship. The intelligence gleaned about <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> <b>and</b> its possible intentions could be passed on to the Army.|$|E

5|$|On 14 and 15 July 1942, {{during the}} First Battle of El Alamein, the {{battalion}} {{was engaged in}} what would {{be known as the}} Battle of Ruweisat Ridge. Ruweisat Ridge was held by <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> <b>and</b> was in the centre of the El Alamein line, dominating the surrounding area. The 4th Brigade was to take the western end of the ridge, with Kippenberger's 5th Brigade tasked with the capture of the centre of the ridge. The 5th Indian Brigade was allocated to deal with the eastern end. British tanks, in the form of two armoured brigades, were to protect the flanks and be in support to deal with the expected counterattack. However, little thought was given to communication and liaison between the infantry and armoured brigades, nor was a clear chain of command established. This would have implications for the outcome of the battle.|$|E
5|$|On 29 August 1942, {{during the}} Battle of Isurava, Kingsbury {{was one of}} the few {{survivors}} of a platoon that had been overrun by the Japanese. He immediately volunteered to join a different platoon, which had been ordered to counter-attack. Rushing forward and firing his Bren gun from the hip, he cleared a path through <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> <b>and</b> inflicted several casualties. Kingsbury was then seen to fall, shot by a Japanese sniper and killed instantly. His actions, which delayed the Japanese long enough for the Australians to fortify their positions, were instrumental in saving his battalion's headquarters and he was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross as a result.|$|E
5|$|On the {{following}} day, the 2nd Brigade of the 1st Air Cavalry captured the old French fort near Khe Sanh village after a three-day battle. The link-up between the relief {{force and the}} Marines at KSCB took place at 08:00 on 8 April, when the 2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry Regiment entered the camp. The 11th Engineers proclaimed Route 9 open to traffic on 11 April. On that day, Tolson ordered his unit to immediately make preparations for Operation Delaware, an air assault into the A Shau Valley. At 08:00 on 15 April, Operation Pegasus was officially terminated. Total US casualties during the operation were 92 killed, 667 wounded and five missing. Thirty-three South Vietnamese troops were also killed and 187 wounded. Because of the close proximity of <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> <b>and</b> their high concentration, the massive B-52 bombings, tactical airstrikes, and vast use of artillery, NVA casualties were estimated by MACV as being between 10,000 to 15,000 men.|$|E
