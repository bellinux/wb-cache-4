5|$|In its 2006 in Review issue (February 2007), Revolver {{magazine}} dubbed Christian metal {{the phenomenon}} of the year. Editor in Chief Tom Beaujour interviewed the lead vocalists of As I Lay Dying, Demon Hunter, Norma Jean, and Underoath (Tim Lambesis, Ryan Clark, Cory Brandan Putman, and Spencer Chamberlain, respectively) as the front-page article for the issue. <b>Tooth</b> <b>and</b> <b>Nail</b> Records, P.O.D., Zao, War of Ages, Still Remains, and He Is Legend were also mentioned.|$|E
5|$|In {{the winter}} of 173, the Iazyges {{launched}} a raid across the frozen Danube, but the Romans were ready for pursuit and followed {{them back to the}} Danube. The Iazyges prepared an ambush, planning to attack and scatter them as they tried to cross the frozen Danube, knowing that the Roman legionaries were not trained to fight on ice, and that their own horses had been trained to fight on ice without slipping. However the Roman army formed a solid square and dug into the ice with their shields, so that they would not slip. When the Iazyges could not break the Roman lines, the Romans counterattacked, pulling the Iazyges off of their horses by grabbing on to their spears, clothing and shields. Soon both armies were in disarray after having slipped on the ice, and the battle was reduced to many brawls between the two sides, literally <b>tooth</b> <b>and</b> <b>nail</b> battles, which the Romans won. After this battle the Iazyges, and presumably the Sarmatians in general, were declared the primary enemy of Rome.|$|E

25|$|Other bands may {{experiment}} with more abrasive musical styles. Beginning in the 1990s and 2000s {{there was much}} wider acceptance even by religious purists of Christian metal, Christian industrial and Christian punk. Many of these bands are on predominantly Christian record labels, such as <b>Tooth</b> <b>and</b> <b>Nail</b> Records and Facedown Records.|$|E
25|$|Matthew Cory {{developed}} a May–December romance with his business partner, Donna Hudson. Vicky married Grant, but left him to reunite with Ryan.

25|$|After leaving Memphis the Sheepherders {{returned}} to Puerto Rico and the WWC. Here the Sheepherders started a bloody feud with Chris and Mark Youngblood that drew big crowds in Puerto Rico. The feud saw Luke and Butch win the WWC World Tag Team titles on 4 April and then defend them <b>tooth</b> <b>and</b> <b>nail</b> until the Youngbloods regained the gold on 10 May {{in a cage}} match. After their spring run with WWC the Sheepherders {{returned to}} Florida and instantly became challengers for Mike Graham and Steve Keirn's NWA Florida Tag Team Championship. On 26 June, Luke and Butch added that title to their collection by brawling and cheating. Their run with the Florida titles {{came to an end}} on 29 August when Keirn and Graham regained the titles.|$|E

500|$|For {{the rest}} of the film, Chris Corbould, the special effects and {{miniature}} effects supervisor, returned to a more realistic style of film making and significantly reduced digital effects. According to Corbould, [...] "CGI is a great tool and can be very useful, but I will fight to the <b>tooth</b> <b>and</b> <b>nail</b> to do something for real. It's the best way to go". Three scenes involving primarily physical effects in the film were the chase at a building site in Madagascar, the Miami Airport chase sequence, and the sinking Venetian house, with sets located on the Grand Canal and in Pinewood Studios.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} year, Project 86 re-signed {{with their}} previous label, <b>Tooth</b> <b>and</b> <b>Nail.</b> Songs to Burn Your Bridges By was re-released in June 2004. The new version included 3 new tracks produced by Aaron Sprinkle and mixed by J.R. McNeely, several new mixes, and featured new artwork. The release peaked at No.36 on Heatseekers, and {{was met with}} positive reviews by critics. According to Schwab, the album was {{a return to the}} bands heavier roots, and a means to express the frustrations the band went through during Truthless Heroes. The group performed at Purple Door, a Christian music festival, later that year. [...] When Project 86 played their set, moshers threw mud everywhere and covered the stage and musical equipment. Thousands of dollars worth of musical equipment was damaged.|$|E

500|$|For many of {{the effects}} in the film, Special Effects and Miniature Effects Supervisor Chris Corbould used a more {{realistic}} style of film making and significantly reduced digital effects compared with previous Bond films. Corbould noted that, [...] "CGI is a great tool and can be very useful, but I will fight to the <b>tooth</b> <b>and</b> <b>nail</b> {{to do something for}} real. It's the best way to go". Corbould used the 007 stage at Pinewood for the sinking of the Venetian house at the climax of the film, which featured the largest rig ever built for a Bond film. Casino Royale featured music composed by David Arnold, his fourth soundtrack for the Bond film series. Producers Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli announced on 26 July 2006 that Chris Cornell would perform the title song, entitled [...] "You Know My Name", which he co-wrote with Arnold.|$|E
500|$|The {{most active}} glam metal scene was {{starting}} to appear in clubs on the Sunset Strip in Los Angeles, including The Trip, the Whisky a Go Go, and the Starwood. These clubs began to avoid booking punk rock bands because of fears of violence and began booking many area metal bands, usually on a [...] "pay to play" [...] basis, thus creating a vibrant scene for hard rock music. An increasing numbers of metal bands were able to produce debut albums in 1984, including Ratt (from Los Angeles) with its breakthrough album Out of the Cellar, Bon Jovi (from New Jersey) with its debut Bon Jovi, Great White with Great White, Black 'n Blue (from Portland Oregon) with Black 'n Blue, Autograph with its first album Sign In Please, and W.A.S.P. with its self-titled debut album. Also in 1984, Lita Ford put out her second album called Dancin' on the Edge, Quiet Riot released its follow-up to Metal Health called Condition Critical, Dokken released its second album called <b>Tooth</b> <b>and</b> <b>Nail,</b> and Kiss released the glam-sounding Animalize.|$|E
500|$|Bruce Moore {{writes in}} the e-book Metal Missionaries that during mid-1990s Christian metal [...] "ceased to play catch up (replicating secular bands) and began to {{assimilate}} into its rightful place in the Extreme music scene and the artists who played became influential in helping to define this relatively new, but growing genre." [...] With risen musical quality and more street-credibility, Christian metal and hardcore bands were signed to record labels such as <b>Tooth</b> <b>and</b> <b>Nail,</b> Solid State, Facedown Records as well as secular labels Metal Blade and Victory Records. Christian metal was available through non-Christian outlets; [...] "For the first time Extreme Christian music moved from the dusty back bin of the Christian book stores to the front racks at super retailers like Best Buy, Circuit City, FYE and even giant retailers like Wal-Mart, Target and Hot Topic." [...] The German secular metal label Nuclear Blast Records also released Christian metal. Torodd Fuglesteg of Norway's Arctic Serenades Records has claimed: [...] "The owner of Nuclear Blast was a committed Christian and he was pushing everything with that religious agenda through Nuclear Blast. Mortification and Horde were pushed like mad by Nuclear Blast when other labels were pushing pure satanic stuff." ...|$|E

As an adult, he stood over six feet, seven inches tall.|$|R
2500|$|Barbour {{has faced}} {{considerable}} [...] "in-state criticism for {{his approach to}} racial issues". Mississippi state Representative Willie Perkins has [...] "compared Barbour to the southern Democrats who preceded him", saying: [...] "As far as I'm concerned, he has never done anything as a governor or a citizen to distinguish himself from the old Democrats who fought <b>tooth</b> <b>and</b> <b>nail</b> to preserve segregation." ...|$|E
2500|$|In January 1903, Baird was reappointed by the University's Board of Regents for a term {{of three}} years. [...] Baird's phenomenal success drew {{interest}} from professional sports. [...] In March 1903, Boston Red Sox owner Henry Killilea offered Baird a contract as the baseball team's business manager and financial secretary, replacing Joseph Gavin. [...] Press accounts indicated, though Baird was loath to quit Michigan, the [...] "financial inducements offered by Mr. Killilea were so far in excess of Baird's present salary at the University of Michigan that there is hardly any doubt but that he will accept, although alumni are working <b>tooth</b> <b>and</b> <b>nail</b> to keep him at Michigan." [...] When {{it was announced that}} Baird had signed a contract with the Boston team, the student body at Michigan signed petitions seeking to retain Baird as athletic director. [...] On receiving the petitions from the Michigan student body, Red Sox owner Killilea, who was a Michigan alumnus, agreed to release Baird from the contract.|$|E
2500|$|For Squad 5-O, {{the move}} to <b>Tooth</b> <b>and</b> <b>Nail</b> {{was more than just}} a change of {{approach}} in musical style. The band also began to move away from explicit references to Jesus, and to use metaphor more extensively. They also began to tour in more mainstream venues than churches, as explained by Jeff Fortson: [...] "Jesus said to be fishers of men; we have realized that you can't do that unless you're where the people who need him are." [...] Generally, the band was discontented with the state of the Christian music industry and Christian subculture, which they saw as exploitive and misleading. Jeff Fortson contrasted for HM magazine their experiences playing at a [...] "large Christian event" [...] and a secular one a few days later. At the Christian event (which was headlined by Steven Curtis Chapman) [...] "... the kids were coming out of the seats and standing in the aisles to come up and rock out with us... They just shut us down... The park security and promoters evidently thought we were just evil and inciting riots." [...] At the secular show they reported that they could [...] "...connect with the kids, you know, just be real... same exact response from the crowd, and that's why I feel that's where we belong." ...|$|E
