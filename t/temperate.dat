5|$|The {{species has}} a {{cosmopolitan}} distribution except for arctic, alpine and cold <b>temperate</b> regions; {{it is common}} in <b>temperate</b> and tropical regions of the world. It has been collected in Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, North America, and South America.|$|E
5|$|Where {{rainfall}} {{is relatively}} evenly {{spread across the}} seasons in <b>temperate</b> regions, <b>temperate</b> broadleaf and mixed forest typified by species like oak, beech, birch and maple is found. <b>Temperate</b> forest {{is also found in}} the southern hemisphere, as for example in the Eastern Australia <b>temperate</b> forest, characterised by Eucalyptus forest and open acacia woodland.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius {{is mainly}} {{known from the}} north <b>temperate</b> zone, but some species also occur in {{tropical}} Asia and Africa. Lactifluus has a more tropical distribution than Lactarius, with most species known from tropical Africa, Asia, South America, and Australasia, but some also occurring in the north <b>temperate</b> zone. Multifurca is the rarest among the four mushroom genera, known only from some punctual records in North and Central America, Asia, and Australasia.|$|E
5|$|Northwest Argentina is {{predominantly}} dry, hot, and subtropical. Owing to its rugged and varied topography, {{the region is}} climatically diverse, depending on the altitude, temperature and distribution of precipitation. Consequently, the vegetation will also differ. Under the Köppen climate classification, the region has five different climate types: semi–arid (BS), arid (BW), <b>temperate</b> without a dry season and <b>temperate</b> with a dry season (Cf and CW respectively), and, at the highest altitudes, an alpine.|$|E
5|$|Rainforests {{are areas}} of the world with very high rainfall. Both {{tropical}} and <b>temperate</b> rainforests exist. Tropical rainforests occupy a large band of the planet mostly along the equator. Most <b>temperate</b> rainforests are located on mountainous west coasts between 45 and 55 degrees latitude, but they are often found in other areas.|$|E
5|$|S. b. woodwardi (Sharpe, 1877), {{named for}} Sharpe's {{collaborator}} Bernard Barham Woodward, breeds in eastern Europe and <b>temperate</b> Asia east to western Siberia.|$|E
5|$|Seattle's {{climate is}} {{classified}} as oceanic or <b>temperate</b> marine, with cool, wet winters and mild, relatively dry summers.|$|E
5|$|Sponges {{are more}} {{abundant}} but less diverse in <b>temperate</b> waters than in tropical waters, possibly because organisms that prey on sponges are more abundant in tropical waters. Glass sponges {{are the most}} common in polar waters and in the depths of <b>temperate</b> and tropical seas, as their very porous construction enables them to extract food from these resource-poor waters with the minimum of effort. Demosponges and calcareous sponges are abundant and diverse in shallower non-polar waters.|$|E
5|$|<b>Temperate</b> sundews: These species form a tight {{cluster of}} unfurled leaves called a hibernaculum in a winter {{dormancy}} period (= Hemicryptophyte). All of the North American and European species belong to this group. Drosera arcturi from Australia (including Tasmania) and New Zealand is another <b>temperate</b> species that dies {{back to a}} horn-shaped hibernaculum.|$|E
5|$|The Russulaceae {{as a whole}} have a {{worldwide}} distribution, but patterns differ among genera. Russula is the most widespread, found in North, Central and South America, Europe, <b>temperate</b> and tropical Asia, Africa, and Australasia. It is the only Russulaceae genus that occurs in the Nothofagus zone of <b>temperate</b> South America.|$|E
5|$|The beetle has the {{potential}} to spread to <b>temperate</b> areas of East Asia, India, South America, Africa, New Zealand, and Australia.|$|E
5|$|The {{climate is}} <b>temperate</b> with mild winters and mild to warm summers.|$|E
5|$|The {{county has}} a <b>temperate</b> {{semi-arid}} plateau monsoon climate, with about 100 frost-free days.|$|E
5|$|The egg stage lasts a {{few weeks}} in most butterflies, but eggs laid close to winter, {{especially}} in <b>temperate</b> regions, go through a diapause (resting) stage, and the hatching may take place only in spring. Some <b>temperate</b> region butterflies, such as the Camberwell beauty, lay their eggs {{in the spring and}} have them hatch in the summer.|$|E
5|$|The fungus {{is widely}} {{distributed}} in Europe, Central and North America, <b>temperate</b> Asia, and Turkey. In North America, its range extends from Canada to the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt south of Mexico City. The mushroom is common, {{appearing in the}} summer and autumn, although it is easily overlooked because of its small size and nondescript coloration. A.vulgare is the only representative of its genus in <b>temperate</b> areas of the Northern Hemisphere.|$|E
5|$|The native {{range of}} the emerald ash borer is <b>temperate</b> northeastern Asia, which {{includes}} Russia, Mongolia, northern China, Japan, and Korea.|$|E
5|$|The primary biome of inland Massachusetts is <b>temperate</b> {{deciduous}} forest.|$|E
5|$|A rugged, sparsely {{populated}} area, the Catlins features a scenic coastal landscape and dense <b>temperate</b> rainforest, {{both of which}} harbour many endangered species of birds, most notably the rare yellow-eyed penguin. The coast attracts numerous marine mammals, among them New Zealand fur seals and Hooker's sea lions. In general terms the area enjoys a maritime <b>temperate</b> climate. Its exposed location leads to its frequently wild weather and heavy ocean swells, which are an attraction to big-wave surfers, and have also caused numerous shipwrecks.|$|E
5|$|Amylostereum chailletiiz {{is common}} in the <b>temperate</b> regions of North America and Eurasia. A.laevigatum can be also found in <b>temperate</b> Eurasia, but {{it is unclear how}} broadly this species is {{distributed}} in North America. A.areolatum is originally native in North Africa and Eurasia; it was however distributed through the 20th century in Australia, New Zealand, Southern Africa as well as in South and North America. Only A.ferreum is originally native in the tropics and {{is common in}} Brazil and the Caribbean.|$|E
5|$|Apples {{have been}} acclimatized in Ecuador {{at very high}} altitudes, where they can often, with the needed factors, provide crops twice per year because of {{constant}} <b>temperate</b> conditions year-round.|$|E
5|$|As {{with most}} bats, the little brown bat is mostly active {{at night and}} leaves its roost at dusk and {{the next two or}} three hours are peak {{activity}} periods. They are also active before dawn. Since little brown bats live in a <b>temperate</b> zone, they must find some way of dealing with winter. Most <b>temperate</b> bats either migrate or hibernate, but little brown bats do both. In summer, the males and females live apart, the females raise the young. When fall comes, both sexes fly south to a hibernaculum, where they mate and then hibernate. Little brown bats undergo a prolonged period of hibernation during the winter due to the lack of food. They hibernate in caves as a community.|$|E
5|$|Criticism must {{generally}} {{be expressed in}} a <b>temperate</b> and dispassionate manner. This allows rational debate about the issues raised, and thus may even contribute to the improvement and strengthening of the administration of justice.|$|E
5|$|Different soil types suit {{different}} crops, but {{in general}} in <b>temperate</b> climates, sandy soils dry out fast but warm up quickly {{in the spring and}} are suitable for early crops, while heavy clays retain moisture better and are more suitable for late season crops. The growing season can be lengthened by the use of fleece, cloches, plastic mulch, polytunnels, and greenhouses. In hotter regions, the production of vegetables is constrained by the climate, especially the pattern of rainfall, while in <b>temperate</b> zones, it is constrained by the temperature and day length.|$|E
5|$|Giffnock {{experiences}} a <b>temperate</b> maritime climate, {{like much of}} the British Isles, with relatively cool summers and mild winters. Regular but generally light precipitation occurs throughout the year.|$|E
5|$|In another {{mapping the}} World Wildlife Fund {{has made this}} area {{part of the larger}} Southeast Australia <b>temperate</b> savanna {{ecoregion}} that covers the western plains of New South Wales.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{introduced}} throughout the <b>temperate</b> world, and is established as a weed in Australia, New Zealand, tropical Asia, La Réunion, North America, Hawaii, Chile, Hispaniola and Argentina. It has also been reported in Japan.|$|E
5|$|Japan {{has nine}} forest {{ecoregions}} which reflect {{the climate and}} geography of the islands. They range from subtropical moist broadleaf forests in the Ryūkyū and Bonin Islands, to <b>temperate</b> broadleaf and mixed forests in the mild climate regions of the main islands, to <b>temperate</b> coniferous forests in the cold, winter portions of the northern islands. Japan has over 90,000 species of wildlife, including the brown bear, the Japanese macaque, the Japanese raccoon dog, the large Japanese field mouse, and the Japanese giant salamander. A large network of national parks has been established to protect important areas of flora and fauna as well as thirty-seven Ramsar wetland sites. Four sites have been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List for their outstanding natural value.|$|E
5|$|Like {{much of the}} British Isles, Coatbridge {{experiences}} a <b>temperate</b> maritime climate with relatively cool summers and mild winters. The prevailing wind is from the west. Regular but generally light precipitation occurs throughout the year.|$|E
5|$|Much of South Dakota (except for the Black Hills area) is {{dominated}} by a <b>temperate</b> grasslands biome. Although grasses and crops cover most of this region, deciduous trees such as cottonwoods, elms, and willows are common near rivers and in shelter belts.|$|E
5|$|Seattle's mild, <b>temperate,</b> marine climate allows year-round outdoor recreation, {{including}} walking, cycling, hiking, skiing, snowboarding, kayaking, rock climbing, motor boating, sailing, team sports, and swimming.|$|E
5|$|Several {{studies of}} the house sparrow in <b>temperate</b> {{agricultural}} areas have found the proportion of seeds in its diet to be about 90%. It will eat almost any seeds, but where it has a choice, it prefers oats and wheat. In urban areas, the house sparrow feeds largely on food provided directly or indirectly by humans, such as bread, though it prefers raw seeds. The house sparrow also eats some plant matter besides seeds, including buds, berries, and fruits such as grapes and cherries. In <b>temperate</b> areas, the house sparrow has an unusual habit of tearing flowers, especially yellow ones, in the spring.|$|E
5|$|Strandzha Nature Park {{falls within}} two {{terrestrial}} ecoregions of the Palearctic <b>temperate</b> broadleaf and mixed forest— the Balkan mixed forests and the Euxine-Colchic deciduous forests. Forests cover 80% of the park's area, with old-growth forest forming 30% of them. These woods {{are the last}} remaining <b>temperate</b> forests with evergreen laurel undergrowth in Europe. The park has {{the highest number of}} vertebrate species of all protected areas in Bulgaria, including 66 species of mammals, 269 species of birds, 24 species of reptiles, 10 species of amphibia and 41 species of freshwater fish, as well as 70 species of marine fish in the waters of the Black Sea. The invertebrate fauna is poorly researched and includes 84 Bulgarian endemic species, of which 4 are local, and 34 relict species.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian tree sparrow's natural {{breeding}} range comprises most of <b>temperate</b> Europe and Asia south of about latitude 68°N (north of this the summers are too cold, with July average temperatures below 12°C) and through Southeast Asia to Java and Bali. It formerly bred in the Faroes, Malta and Gozo. In South Asia {{it is found}} mainly in the <b>temperate</b> zone. It is sedentary over most of its extensive range, but northernmost breeding populations migrate south for the winter, and small numbers leave southern Europe for North Africa and the Middle East. The eastern subspecies P. m. dilutus reaches coastal Pakistan in winter and thousands of birds of this race move through eastern China in autumn.|$|E
5|$|The Galveston Bay Area {{is located}} on the gulf coastal plain, and its {{vegetation}} is classified as <b>temperate</b> grassland and marshes. The municipalities have been built on reclaimed marshes, swamps, and prairies, which are all still visible in undeveloped areas.Eubanks (2006), p. 10.|$|E
5|$|The Patagonian {{climate is}} {{classified}} as arid to semi-arid and <b>temperate</b> to cool <b>temperate.</b> One defining characteristic are the strong winds from the west which blow year round (stronger in summer than in winter), which favors evaporation and {{is a factor in}} making the region mostly arid. There are three major factors that influence the climate of the region: the Andes, the South Pacific High and South Atlantic High, and an isolation that is more pronounced in eastern than western areas.|$|E
5|$|The {{climate in}} the area, {{like most of}} {{northwest}} Europe, is maritime <b>temperate,</b> with significant precipitation throughout the year, averaging 1047 mm annually. The average annual temperature is 9.7 °C.|$|E
