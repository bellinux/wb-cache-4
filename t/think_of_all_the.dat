500|$|I really don't {{know where}} I'd be today if I {{had not gone}} to Mecca to make Hajj shortly after Malcolm was assassinated. ... That is what helped put me back on track. ... Going to Mecca, making Hajj, was very good for me because it made me <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> {{people in the world}} who loved me and were for me, who prayed that I would get my life back together. I stopped {{focusing}} on the people who were trying to tear me and my family apart.|$|E
500|$|Most of {{the names}} were based on [...] "Southern puns", and it took Chun a while to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> names. All of the props, cards, and box were {{designed}} by the series' prop department. The producers tried to market the game as a real product, although that never came to fruition. Chun crafted the cold open after being inspired by the second season episode [...] "The Fight" [...] {{because he wanted to}} see more [...] "Karate Dwight". In the original version of the open, the scripted featured Dwight and Michael kicking each other in the groin. Jennifer Celotta, however, suggested that Dwight fight himself. The episode guest-stars Andy Buckley, who plays David Wallace. Buckley appears only via the telephone, and recorded his lines in the annex of the set, to give the illusion that he was calling from a long ways away.|$|E
500|$|... "Blaze a 50" [...] {{features}} a violin-based instrumental and a complex narrative that follows {{a tale of}} murder, sex, and betrayal. Nas narrates the tale in conventional fashion until the ending, at which the track rewinds to an earlier point and he revises his original ending. [...] "Everybody's Crazy" [...] features complex rhymes and braggadocio rap by Nas: [...] "Gangsta see, gangsta do / A Langston Hughes predecessor / Gun in my dresser, slang I use." [...] In [...] "Purple"s narrative, Nas lights up a blunt and expresses his thoughts, including criticism of hoodlums and their effect on their neighborhoods: [...] "The 'hood love you, but behind your back they pray for the day / A bullet hit your heart and ambulance take you away / That ain't love it's hate / <b>Think</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> mothers at wakes / Whose sons you've killed and you ain't got a cut on your face?" [...] "Drunk by Myself" [...] has lyrics concerning alcohol and self-medication.|$|E

500|$|Sean Hayes {{was cast}} {{in the role of}} Jack. When a NBC casting {{executive}} saw Hayes's role in the indie gay romance film Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss, he sent the script to Hayes, who was attending the 1997 Sundance Film Festival in Utah. Even though Hayes enjoyed the script when he read it, he threw it away as {{he did not want to}} spend money on a plane ticket to Los Angeles for the audition. However, a few weeks later when Hayes was in Los Angeles, he was sent the script again and decided to try out for the audition. If asked if he regrets accepting the role, Hayes said: [...] "If you're truly an actor, in the long run... I don't know that I would have done it either. I <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> things that I still want to do, and I don't know if I'll get to do them." [...] However, he admits that he [...] "love" [...] the idea that people assume that he is either gay or straight. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Hayes admitted that people believe he is Jack [...] "24 hours a day".|$|E
500|$|Much of Ianto's {{character}} development is centred on the character's relationship with Captain Jack. On the character's evolution from minor character to romantic interest, Gareth David-Lloyd has commented that [...] "To have a storyline where you're {{involved with the}} leading character for any actor is awesome." [...] On the character's development, David-Lloyd has said that through Jack's relationship, [...] "he's found his meaning and ... he's happier." [...] Asked {{what it is that}} Ianto receives from Jack, David-Lloyd responds [...] "Support, meaning. I think he lost meaning. He was tortured and Jack gave him that meaning back. And reliability that he'll always be there, I think." [...] John Barrowman and Gareth David-Lloyd have also opined that Jack's relationship with Ianto has however brought out Jack's empathy, and helped to ground him, with John Barrowman reported as saying that Ianto [...] "brings out the 'human' in him, it brings out more of the empathy because he's actually fallen for someone and he really cares about somebody. So, it's really great and I think that's what makes him warm to other people. It makes him more approachable." [...] In the same interview, Gareth David-Lloyd said of the relationship and his character that [...] "I think Ianto's always made him care and that is really the heart of the show. Ianto's always bearing his emotional side and vulnerable side and keeping his feet on the ground. I <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> characters, he's the one who tries to keep everyone else's feet on the ground. He brings everyone back to reality, often with a dry, witty remark or taking a dig at somebody just to sort of bring people back down." ...|$|E
