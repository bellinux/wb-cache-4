40|$|Breast {{cancer is}} one of the leading causes of death in women. Early {{detection}} of breast cancer is the key to improve survival rate. Malignant tumors causes localized temperature increase on breast surface which shows as hot spot and vascular patterns in breast infrared <b>thermograms.</b> Thermographic detection of breast cancer primarily depends on the visual analysis of these patterns by physicians, which is hard to provide objective and quantitative analysis. This paper proposes computerized analysis of <b>thermograms</b> using a series of statistical features extracted from the <b>thermograms</b> quantifying the bilateral differences between left and right breast area for diagnosis of breast cancer.

40|$|The thermal {{transitions}} {{observed in}} hydrogels are frequently explained by invoking {{the existence of}} different kinds of water such as ‘bound’ and ‘free’ water. However these interpretations are intuitive and do not consider neither the thermodynamics of phase equilibrium nor kinetic aspects. Alternatively, the complicated experimental DSC <b>thermograms</b> have been simply explained in a thermodynamic framework {{with the help of a}} transitions diagram where the temperature of the transitions is plotted versus water concentration in the gel. In this work we further support the interpretation of the DSC <b>thermograms</b> on the basis of this diagram by comparing those <b>thermograms</b> with TMA results. The volume changes in the cooling and heating scans can be correlated with the enthalpy changes in the material and can be explained with the transition diagram...|$|R

40|$|The {{uncertainty}} {{in determining the}} volatility behaviour of organic particles from <b>thermograms</b> using calibration curves and a kinetic model has been evaluated. In the analysis, factors such as re-condensation, departure from equilibrium and analysis methodology were considered as potential sources of {{uncertainty in}} deriving volatility distribution from <b>thermograms</b> obtained with currently used thermodenuder designs. The previously found empirical relationship between C* (saturation concentration) and T 50 (temperature at which 50 % of aerosol mass evaporates) was theoretically interpreted and tested to infer volatility distributions from experimental <b>thermograms.</b> The presented theoretical analysis shows that this empirical equation is in fact an equilibrium formulation, whose applicability is lessened as measurements deviate from equilibrium. While using a calibration curve between C* and T 50 to estimate volatility properties was found to hold at equilibrium, significant underestimation was obtained under kinetically-controlled evaporation conditions. Because <b>thermograms</b> obtained at ambient aerosol loading levels {{are most likely to}} show departure from equilibrium, the application of a kinetic evaporation model is more suitable for inferring volatility properties of atmospheric samples than the calibration curve approach; however, the kinetic model analysis implies significant uncertainty, due to its sensitivity to the assumption of "effective" net kinetic evaporation and condensation coefficients. The influence of re-condensation on <b>thermograms</b> from the thermodenuder designs under study was found to be highly dependent on the particular experimental condition, with a significant potential to affect volatility estimations for aerosol mass loadings > 50 μg m− 3 and with increasing effective kinetic coefficient for condensation and decreasing particle size. These results show that the geometry of current thermodenuder systems should be modified to prevent re-condensation...|$|R
40|$|The {{feasibility}} of remote infrared thermography of aircraft surfaces during flight {{to visualize the}} extent of laminar flow on a target aircraft has been examined. In general, {{it was determined that}} such <b>thermograms</b> can be taken successfully using an existing airplane/thermography system (NASA Dryden's F- 18 with infrared imaging pod) and that the transition pattern and, thus, the extent of laminar flow can be extracted from these <b>thermograms.</b> Depending on the in-flight distance between the F- 18 and the target aircraft, the <b>thermograms</b> can have a spatial resolution of as little as 0. 1 inches. The field of view provided by the present remote system is superior to that of prior stationary infrared thermography systems mounted in the fuselage or vertical tail of a subject aircraft. An additional advantage of the present experimental technique is that the target aircraft requires no or minimal modifications. An image processing procedure was developed which improves the signal-to-noise ratio of the <b>thermograms.</b> Problems encountered during the analog recording of the <b>thermograms</b> (banding of video images) made it impossible to evaluate the adequacy of the present imaging system and image processing procedure to detect transition on untreated metal surfaces. The high reflectance, high thermal difussivity, and low emittance of metal surfaces tend to degrade the images to an extent that {{it is very difficult to}} extract transition information from them. The application of a thin (0. 005 inches) self-adhesive insulating film to the surface is shown to solve this problem satisfactorily. In addition to the problem of infrared based transition detection on untreated metal surfaces, future flight tests will also concentrate on the visualization of other flow phenomena such as flow separation and reattachment...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{conformational}} {{stability of}} β-lactoglobulin increases in D 2 O over that in H 2 O. This is concluded from {{an increase in}} peak temperature by about 3 °C of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) <b>thermograms</b> and from a decrease in overall aggregation rate. However, effects of pH and salt concentration on the heat-induced aggregation (reaction kinetics, DSC <b>thermograms</b> and aggregate growth) are similar in H 2 O and D 2 O. This indicates that the mechanism of heat-induced aggregation of β-lactoglobulin is not significantly affected by replacement of H 2 O with D 2 O...|$|R
50|$|Infrared (IR) {{thermography}} is {{an analysis}} technique {{based on the}} detection of radiation in the IR wavelength spectrum. According to the black body radiation law, all objects with temperature greater than absolute zero emit IR radiation. The device detecting and composing a 2D image of the IR radiation is generally called an IR camera or a thermographic camera, {{also referred to as}} an infrared camera. The result of the thermographic recording is an image or a sequence, which corresponds to the intensity of the thermal radiation of the recorded object. The recording is called a <b>thermogram.</b> The intensity of the thermal radiation of the object is directly connected with the object temperature. The <b>thermogram</b> is therefore an image of the object surface temperature distribution. IR thermography is in the most cases used for non-contact measurement of spatial and time distribution of temperature fields.|$|E
50|$|If {{the object}} is {{radiating}} at a higher temperature than its surroundings, then power transfer will be taking place and power will be radiating from warm to cold following the principle stated in the Second Law of Thermodynamics. So {{if there is a}} cool area in the <b>thermogram,</b> that object will be absorbing the radiation emitted by the warm object.|$|E
50|$|A lot {{of methods}} were {{developed}} for active thermography for the nondestructive testing measurement evaluation. The evaluation methods selection depends on application, used excitation source and excitation type (pulse, periodic, continuous). In the simplest case, {{the response is}} evident from a <b>thermogram</b> directly. However, {{it is necessary to}} use advanced analysis techniques in most cases. The most common methods include Lock-In, Pulse or Transient (Step thermography) evaluation techniques. Continuous excitation can also be used in some cases.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{a method}} that {{combines}} image analysis techniques, such as segmentation and registration, is proposed for an advanced and progressive evaluation of <b>thermograms.</b> The method is applied {{for the prevention of}} muscle injury in high-performance athletes, in collaboration with a Brazilian professional soccer club. The goal is to produce information on spatio-temporal variations of <b>thermograms</b> favoring the investigation of the athletes’ conditions along the competition. The proposed method improves on current practice by providing a means for automatically detecting adaptive body-shaped regions of interest, instead of the manual selection of simple shapes. Specifically, our approach combines the optimization features in Otsu’s method with a correction factor and post-processing techniques, enhancing thermal-image segmentation when compared to other methods. Additional contributions resulting from the combination of the segmentation and registration steps of our approach are the progressive analyses of <b>thermograms</b> in a unique spatial coordinate system and the accurate extraction of measurements and isotherms...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{illustrates}} {{a new approach}} to achieve the temperature distribution of a buildings composing a global view, at high resolution. It starts from {{the state of the art}} and describes how to manage the <b>thermograms</b> content. The on line radiometric calibration of raw <b>thermograms</b> allows obtaining a high accuracy of temperature readings. The calibration is performed using a grid of special targets viewed by the thermographic camera. An accurate global view of the building envelope is produced with images of thousands per thousands pixels trough an automatic mosaic composition of <b>thermograms.</b> Advanced image processing, including the geometric correction is performed in real time. The final result is a 3 D model of the building, georeferenced and with capability to perform heat flux measurements. In addition, IR images, Near IR and visible electromagnetic bands are fused for the building material evaluation. As case study, the exterior surface of Palazzo Ducale in Venice, is analyzed and illustrated. 1...|$|R

50|$|Differential thermal {{analysis}} (or DTA) is a thermoanalytic technique. Similar to differential scanning calorimetry. In DTA, the material under study and an inert reference {{are made to}} undergo identical thermal cycles, while recording any temperature difference between sample and reference. This differential temperature is then plotted against time, or against temperature (DTA curve, or <b>thermogram).</b> Changes in the sample, either exothermic or endothermic, can be detected relative to the inert reference. Thus, a DTA curve provides data on the transformations that have occurred, such as glass transitions, crystallization, melting and sublimation. The area under a DTA peak is the enthalpy change and is not affected by the heat capacity of the sample.|$|E
5000|$|Related equipment, {{although}} not strictly thermometers, include infrared scanning systems and infrared thermal imaging cameras. Infrared scanning systems scan a larger area, typically by using {{what is essentially}} a spot thermometer pointed at a rotating mirror. These devices are widely used in manufacturing involving conveyors or [...] "web" [...] processes, such as large sheets of glass or metal exiting an oven, fabric and paper, or continuous piles of material along a conveyor belt. Infrared thermal imaging cameras or infrared cameras are essentially infrared radiation thermometers that measure the temperature at many points over a relatively large area to generate a two-dimensional image, called a <b>thermogram,</b> with each pixel representing a temperature. This technology is more processor- and software-intensive than spot or scanning thermometers, and is used for monitoring large areas. Typical applications include perimeter monitoring used by military or security personnel, inspection / process quality monitoring of manufacturing processes, and equipment or enclosed space hot or cold spot monitoring for safety and efficiency maintenance purposes.|$|E
