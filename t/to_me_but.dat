5|$|Sometime I {{have thought}} that {{impossible}} it had been, so to have removed my affection {{from the realm of}} Scotland, that any realm or nation could have been equal dear <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>But</b> God I take to record in my conscience, that the troubles present (and appearing to be) in the realm of England are double more dolorous unto my heart than ever were the troubles of Scotland.|$|E
5|$|As to Captain Benbow, I {{know of no}} {{difference}} between him and me, nor have we had any. He has no small obligation <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>but</b> being called {{in some of the}} foolish printed papers ‘the famous Captain Benbow’, I suppose has put him a little out of himself, and has made him play the fool, as I guess, in some of his letters. I will not farther now particularize this business, but time will show I have not been in the wrong, unless being too kind to an ungrateful man.|$|E
5|$|I {{remained}} on the wreck until she went down; the suction took me down some way, and a man got hold of my leg, but I managed to kick him off and came up and struck out for some pieces of wood {{that were on the}} water and started for land, about two miles off. I was in the water about five hours, as the shore was so rocky and the surf ran so high that a great many were lost trying to land. Nearly all those that took to the water without their clothes on were taken by sharks; hundreds of them were all round us, and I saw men taken by them close <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>but</b> as I was dressed (having on a flannel shirt and trousers) they preferred the others. I was not in the least hurt, and am happy to say, kept my head clear; most of the officers lost their lives from losing their presence of mind and trying to take money with them, and from not throwing off their coats. - Letter from Lieutenant J.F. Girardot, 43rd Light Infantry, to his father, 1 March 1852.|$|E

25|$|May any merit from my {{practice}} in the past, present and future be given not <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>but</b> to all sentient beings {{so that they may}} attain supreme enlightenment.|$|E
25|$|You may be {{too young}} to remember, but in 1971, during a Test match, I {{collided}} with England fast bowler John Snow and lost my bat. Snow {{picked it up and}} handed it <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>But</b> at the time, many papers wrote that Snow had flung the bat at me. It all depends on your point of view, or what you are trying to portray...|$|E

500|$|... "Lou has monstrous {{numbers and}} was like Babe Ruth. How was it {{possible}} to compare him <b>to</b> <b>me?</b> <b>But</b> I realized what we did share is playing in consecutive games. It was still uncomfortable for me. When you're mentioned with him, I'm not sure you fully understand what it means." ...|$|E
500|$|She {{takes several}} daily insulin injections, and her {{diabetes}} {{is considered to}} be well controlled. Sotomayor does not belong to a Catholic parish or attend Mass, but does attend church for important occasions. She has said, [...] "I am a very spiritual person [...] maybe not traditionally religious in terms of Sunday Mass every week, that sort of thing. The trappings are not important <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>but,</b> yes, I do believe in God. And, yes, I do believe in the commandments." ...|$|E
500|$|The band resumed touring in Stamford, Connecticut on April 14. In the {{aftermath}} of the controversy, Thornton appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live! and he said, [...] "The fact that was news was astounding <b>to</b> <b>me...</b> <b>But</b> it gave humpbacked geeks all over the world something to do for a couple of days." [...] He added that he only wants to be perceived as a musician {{in the context of the}} band, remarking that [...] "I'm just in their band, I'm just one of those guys".|$|E
60|$|LADY W. Yes, Poulder tried <b>to</b> stop <b>me,</b> <b>but</b> I wasn't {{going to}} have you blown up without me.|$|R
60|$|She was {{surprised}} <b>to</b> see <b>me,</b> <b>but</b> received <b>me</b> graciously. I fancied {{her face was}} not quite so glowing as usual. I came bluntly out with my mission. She tried <b>to</b> freeze <b>me</b> <b>but</b> I would not freeze. I was out to win or lose {{and not to be}} lightly laughed aside or coldly denied. I played to make her angry, knowing the real truth of her feelings would show under stress.|$|R
60|$|Marika {{shook her}} pretty head, laughed, and blushed. She seemed <b>to</b> {{understand}} <b>me,</b> <b>but</b> would not consent to reply in English.|$|R
500|$|On March 7, 2011, it was {{reported}} that Universal would not proceed with At the Mountains of Madness because del Toro was unwilling to compromise on the $150 million budget and R rating. The director later reflected, [...] "When it happened, this has never happened <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>but</b> I actually cried that weekend a lot. I don't want to sound like a puny soul, but I really was devastated. I was weeping for the movie." [...] The project collapsed on a Friday, and del Toro signed to direct Pacific Rim the following Monday.|$|E
500|$|A new freshman, David Banks, wrote {{a letter}} to his mother about his {{experience}} in trying out for the football team in the fall of 1901:"I am not sure whether I ought to play football or not. ... I put on Tom's suit one night and went down to the field to meet Yost and a few other men. They made me run around the track a couple times to try my wind. Then they rolled me around the ground and sat on me a while. I did not understand the necessity of all they did <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>but</b> the boys say every great player must begin that way." ...|$|E
500|$|Gay film {{historian}} Vito Russo, {{in considering}} Pretorius, stops short of identifying the character as gay, instead referring {{to him as}} [...] "sissified", [...] "sissy" [...] itself being Hollywood code for [...] "homosexual". Pretorius serves as a [...] "gay Mephistopheles", a figure of seduction and temptation, {{going so far as}} to pull Frankenstein away from his bride on their wedding night to engage in the unnatural act of creating non-procreative life. A novelization of the film published in England made the implication clear, having Pretorius say to Frankenstein Be fruitful and multiply.' Let us obey the Biblical injunction: you of course, have the choice of natural means; but as for me, I am afraid that there is no course open <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>but</b> the scientific way." ...|$|E

500|$|Several of Edmondson's Holby City co-stars have {{described}} feeling {{intimidated by the}} prospect of working alongside him for the first time, stemming from his already well established fame. Rakie Ayola explained: [...] "I {{thought it was going to}} be difficult at the beginning because he wasn't speaking <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>But</b> he was initially just a little shy and sussing things out. He's a lot quieter than you would expect but then suddenly he'll say something that has everybody doubled up in laughter. You won't find anyone who doesn't like him." [...] Edmondson himself has added that he gets along well with the cast, although finds that the distance of Elstree Studios from most of their London homes makes them [...] "weirdly unsociable".|$|E
500|$|Chief Justice Yong {{noted that}} the [...] "social conditions" [...] in Singapore were [...] "markedly different" [...] {{from those in the}} US, concluding, [...] "n this basis alone, I am not {{influenced}} by the various views as enunciated in the American cases cited <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>but</b> instead must restrict my analysis of the issues here with reference to the local context." [...] He went on to reject the American cases dealing with freedom of religion on the basis that the Singapore Constitution did not prohibit the [...] "establishment' of any religion unlike the American Constitution which had an anti-establishment clause. Nonetheless, the Chief Justice went on to approve an Australian case, Adelaide Company of Jehovah's Witnesses v. Commonwealth of Australia (1943), with respect to limitations on the religious freedom of Jehovah's Witnesses. This may imply that Singapore courts embrace foreign cases [...] "selectively".|$|E
500|$|Letter {{consists}} of 28 [...] "short epistles", {{which includes a}} few poems and a commencement address, and is dedicated to [...] "the daughter she never had". Angelou thanks several women on her dedication page, which {{is divided into three}} groups. The first group of five women, which includes her grandmother Annie Henderson and her mother Vivian Baxter, she calls [...] "...some women who mothered me through dark and bright days". The second group has only one name, Dr. Dorothy Height, [...] "...one woman who allows me to be a daughter to her, even today". The final group is the largest, made up of 12 women, whom she calls [...] "women not born <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>but</b> who allow me to mother them". The group includes Winfrey, Gayle King, her niece Rosa Johnson Butler, her assistant Lydia Stuckey, and gospel singer Valerie Simpson.|$|E

500|$|On July 28, 2010, Rice {{publicly}} {{announced her}} {{disdain for the}} current state of Christianity on her Facebook page, stating, [...] "Today I quit being a Christian.... I remain committed to Christ as always but not to being 'Christian' or to being part of Christianity. It's simply impossible for me to 'belong' to this quarrelsome, hostile, disputatious, and deservedly infamous group. For ten years, I've tried. I've failed. I'm an outsider. My conscience will allow nothing else." [...] Shortly thereafter, she clarified her statement: [...] "My faith in Christ is central to my life. My conversion from a pessimistic atheist lost in a world I didn't understand, to an optimistic believer in a universe created and sustained by a loving God is crucial <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>But</b> following Christ does not mean following His followers. Christ is infinitely more important than Christianity and always will be, no matter what Christianity is, has been, or might become." ...|$|E
500|$|On Slant Magazines [...] "Best of the Aughts" [...] list, {{the album}} was placed at numbersix out of one-hundred. Reflecting on the album's reception, Chater felt it was well {{received}} because [...] "It's light-hearted and fun to listen to and there is depth there as well. There are some sadder moments that I think has made it resonate and made it last. It does sound like a 23 year old kid in his bedroom making a record <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>but</b> you can hear that innocence and joy in the discovery of finding all those sounds. So {{that was kind of}} infectious for people." [...] In October 2010, it was listed at No.10 in the book, 100 Best Australian Albums. Philip Sherburne, writing for Rhapsody, said that [...] "along with DJ Shadow's Endtroducing, this is one of plunderphonic music's greatest LPs." [...] The album was also included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.|$|E
500|$|Gallagher {{maintains}} that the rivalry was conceived by the magazine NME and members of Blur's entourage as a ploy to raise their respective profiles, and that since this point he has had no respect for either party. However, Albarn has suggested {{the roots of the}} feud were much more personal. By 2007, the tension between the two had cooled, and in an NME interview, Gallagher said [...] "I've got {{a lot of respect for}} Damon, I really do mean it. Because I'm indifferent to Damon he thinks that I think he's a cunt. Our Liam will talk to him, I won't because he's just another singer in a band <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>but</b> I don't think he's a cunt. Good luck to him!" [...] On 23 March 2013, Gallagher, Damon, Graham Coxon and Paul Weller performed the Blur hit [...] "Tender" [...] at the Teenage Cancer Trust. Gallagher provided backing vocals on the song [...] "We Got the Power" [...] with Blur guitarist Graham Coxon, on Albarn's Gorillaz project, from their album Humanz.|$|E
