5|$|The Miami Hurricanes {{kept pace}} with the Hokies {{throughout}} the regular season, winning every conference game after their loss to Tech. After Miami won its {{final game of the}} season and tied the Hokies for the Big East football championship (the Big East had no tiebreaker at the time), it appeared that Virginia Tech would be passed over for a Bowl Alliance game in favor of the Hurricanes. Miami traditionally had a stronger football team and a wider following on television, making it more attractive to bowl-game officials. But Miami's bowl hopes evaporated after the NCAA announced Miami would be put under sanctions for recruiting rules violations. One of the sanctions included a ban from bowl games, which Miami elected to take after the 1995 season instead of delaying until 1996. After the sanctions were announced, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>question</b> for the Hokies was whether they would be bound for the Orange Bowl in Miami or the Sugar Bowl in New Orleans. That question was resolved on December 3, 1995, when Bowl Alliance officials announced their selection of Virginia Tech and Texas for the Sugar Bowl.|$|E
5|$|Republicans were {{generally}} successful {{in state and}} local elections around the country in 1899, and McKinley was optimistic about his chances at re-election in 1900. McKinley's popularity in his first term assured him of renomination for a second. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>question</b> about the Republican ticket concerned the vice presidential nomination; McKinley needed a new running mate as Hobart had died in late 1899. McKinley initially favored Elihu Root, who had succeeded Alger as Secretary of War, but McKinley decided that Root was doing too good a job at the War Department to move him. He considered other prominent candidates, including Allison and Cornelius N. Bliss, but none were as popular as the Republican party's rising star, Theodore Roosevelt. After a stint as Assistant Secretary of the Navy, Roosevelt had resigned and raised a cavalry regiment; they fought bravely in Cuba, and Roosevelt returned home covered in glory. Elected governor of New York on a reform platform in 1898, Roosevelt had his eye on the presidency. Many supporters recommended him to McKinley for the second spot on the ticket, and Roosevelt believed it would be an excellent stepping stone to the presidency in 1904. McKinley remained uncommitted in public, but Hanna was firmly opposed to the New York governor. The Ohio senator considered the New Yorker overly impulsive; his stance was undermined by the efforts of political boss and New York Senator Thomas C. Platt, who, disliking Roosevelt's reform agenda, sought to sideline the governor by making him vice president.|$|E

More specifically, at the most general level this essay is an attempt to explore six questions: What kind of conscientious objection does South African law allow? Why are some conscientious objectors only conscientious noncombatants? Why are some Christians conscientious noncombatants? Is it appropriate to worship Christ? Does Romans 13 undermine conscientious noncompliance? And is there a prescription for servile compliance? These are, however, not <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>questions</b> which are raised in this essay. Nor are they <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>questions</b> which can and need to be asked.

25|$|The {{movement}} {{took off}} when wealthy U.S. Representative Darrell Issa, a Republican representing San Diego, California, announced on May 6 {{that he would}} use his personal money to push the effort. All told, he contributed $1.7 {{million of his own}} money to finance advertisements and professional signature-gatherers. With the movement accelerated, the recall effort began to make national news and soon appeared to be almost a sure thing. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>question</b> was whether signatures would be collected quickly enough to force the special election to take place in late 2003 rather than in March 2004.|$|E
25|$|When the {{campaign}} began, Lenihan {{was seen as}} a near certainty to win the presidency. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>question</b> asked was whether Robinson would beat Currie and come second. However, as {{the campaign}} proceeded, it became apparent that Lenihan's victory was by no means a foregone conclusion, and that Robinson was a serious contender. Crucial to her appeal was the deep unpopularity of the then Taoiseach Charles Haughey and the rising popularity of the Labour Party leader Dick Spring. Notwithstanding, Fianna Fáil knew they could count on Lenihan to mount a barnstorming campaign in the last few weeks.|$|E

When one attempts to solve problems in this class, it makes no difference whether ZF or ZFC is employed if <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>question</b> is the existence of a proof. It is possible, however, that there is a shorter proof of a theorem from ZFC than from ZF.|$|E
25|$|Fabius first {{reinforced}} the Roman garrison at Casilinum, which guarded one such bridge, and Cales {{on the south}} of Ager Falernus. Minucius took up position {{to the north of}} the plain to watch both the via Latina and via Appia with a detachment, while Taenum was also garrisoned. The main Roman army camped near Mount Massicus, north of the plain to the west of Minucius, ready to support his position. A detachment of 4,000 troops was sent to watch the passes of Mount Callicula to the east of the plain near Allifae, one of the possible passes through which Hannibal might choose to leave the plain. The exact location is still unknown and remains debatable. Thus, the Roman dispositions hemmed the Carthaginians in the plain, trapping them. It seemed that Hannibal would have to attack a Roman position directly to break out; <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>question</b> was whether he would choose such a dangerous manoeuvre before or after his supplies had failed. Fabius had ensured the best possible situation for Rome in his view. All the Romans now had to do was wait until the Carthaginians ran out of supplies and then were forced to take desperate measures.|$|E
25|$|The Third Test {{began at}} Chennai on 18 March with high {{expectations}} of a hard-fought series decider. Australia won the toss {{for the third time}} and elected to bat. Hayden batted through the first day for an eventual total of 203, but the rest of Australia's team contributed little to the total of 391. Again, Harbhajan Singh was the destroyer, taking 7–133. India pushed to 501 on the back of Tendulkar's 126. Australia ended day 4 at 241/7, a precarious lead of 131 runs. Early on day 5, Harbhajan again ran through the Australian tail, taking 8–84 and his series tally to an astounding 32 wickets, leaving Australia all out for 264. India had a target of 155 to chase, and plenty of time to do it. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>question</b> was whether Australia's bowlers could get them out first. In 42 nail-biting overs, India steadily lost wickets, sinking to 135/7, a tantalising 20 runs short of victory, but in dire danger of losing their last batsmen before they could score them. The 8th wicket fell at 151, 4 runs short of victory, and it was left to wicket-keeper Sameer Dighe and Harbhajan Singh to see out the end. Harbhajan Singh scored the winning runs past point and sealed the game and an incredible comeback series victory for India. The series victory for India meant that Australia had still not won a series in India for over 30 years.|$|E

The defendant's lawyers furthered pushed the court to try the case as if the abridgement had been recorded in the Stationers' Register, an action {{that would have given}} Wilcox and Nutt the right to publish their book, and the lawsuit brought against a second, unique book. Therefore, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>question</b> before the court was whether the second book differentiated sufficiently from the first. Further, the attorneys for the defendants argued that the book was not a direct transcription, but that several chapters had been omitted, while other, original sections had been added to the Wilcox and Nutt publication. They further pointed {{to the fact that the}} Gyles' publication consisted of 275 sheets, whereas the abridgement contained only 35 sheets.|$|E
