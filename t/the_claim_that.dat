5|$|According to sinologists Denis C. Twitchett and Klaus-Peter Tietze, it is {{generally}} held that the Khitans emerged from the Yuwen branch of the Xianbei people. Following a defeat {{at the hands of}} another branch of the Xianbei in 345, the Yuwen split into three tribes, one of which was called the Kumo Xi. In 388 the Kumo Xi itself split, with one group remaining under the name Kumo Xi and the other group becoming the Khitans. This view is partially backed up by the Book of Wei, which describes the Khitans as being of Xianbei origins. There are also several competing theories on the origin of the Khitans. Beginning in the Song dynasty, some Chinese scholars suggested that the Khitans might have descended from the Xiongnu people. While modern historians have rejected the idea that the Khitan were solely Xiongnu in origin, there is some support for <b>the</b> <b>claim</b> <b>that</b> they are of mixed Xianbei and Xiongnu origin. Beginning with Rashid-al-Din Hamadani in the fourteenth century, several Western scholars have theorized that the Khitans were Mongolic in origin, and in the late 19th century Western scholars made <b>the</b> <b>claim</b> <b>that</b> the Khitans were Tungusic in origin—modern linguistic analysis has discredited this claim.|$|E
5|$|Dualism {{is a set}} {{of views}} about the {{relationship}} between mind and matter (or body). It begins with <b>the</b> <b>claim</b> <b>that</b> mental phenomena are, in some respects, non-physical. One of the earliest known formulations of mind–body dualism was expressed in the eastern Sankhya and Yoga schools of Hindu philosophy (c. 650 BCE), which divided the world into purusha (mind/spirit) and prakriti (material substance). Specifically, the Yoga Sutra of Patanjali presents an analytical approach {{to the nature of the}} mind.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the main}} sources of {{confusion}} and ambiguity in the creation–evolution debate {{is the definition of}} evolution itself. In the context of biology, evolution is genetic changes in populations of organisms over successive generations. The word also has a number of different meanings in different fields, from evolutionary computation to molecular evolution to sociocultural evolution to stellar and galactic evolution. When biological evolution is conflated with other evolutionary processes, this can cause errors such as <b>the</b> <b>claim</b> <b>that</b> modern evolutionary theory says anything about abiogenesis or the Big Bang.|$|E
5|$|Palmer {{begins by}} {{defending}} <b>the</b> <b>claim</b> <b>that</b> animals have moral standing, and then surveys three key approaches to animal ethics; utilitarian approaches, animal rights approaches, and capabilities approaches. All are lacking, she argues, {{as they are}} fundamentally capacity-oriented, and thus unable to properly take account of human relationships to animals. However, her approach leans more strongly towards a Regan-inspired rights view. She next identifies different kinds of relations humans may have with animals: affective, contractual and, most significantly, causal.|$|E

5|$|Similarly, it {{is argued}} that {{evolutionary}} theory is circular reasoning, in that evidence is interpreted as supporting evolution, but evolution is required to interpret the evidence. An example of this is <b>the</b> <b>claim</b> <b>that</b> geological strata are dated through the fossils they hold, but that fossils are in turn dated by the strata they are in. However, in most cases strata are not dated by their fossils, but by their position relative to other strata and by radiometric dating, and most strata were dated before the theory of evolution was formulated.|$|E
5|$|Supporters of {{evolution}} have argued in response that no scientist's claims {{are treated as}} sacrosanct, {{as shown by the}} aspects of Darwin's theory that have been rejected or revised by scientists over the years to form first neo-Darwinism and later the modern evolutionary synthesis. <b>The</b> <b>claim</b> <b>that</b> evolution relies on faith is likewise rejected on the grounds that evolution has strong supporting evidence, and therefore does not require faith.|$|E
