The {{design of}} the cone {{is based on an}} electromagnetic analogy reported by Smith and Wang, while the nozzle was designed assuming potential flow and using numerical methods to obtain the solution. Both designs yielded fairly uniform velocity fields, any deviations being primarily due to either construction or measurement techniques. The towing <b>tank</b> <b>rating</b> for a Pygmy current meter was compared with the submerged jet rating, the difference being 1 or 2 percent.

Fish culture was divided into two terms: the first term, from hatch until 21 days after hatching (DAH); and the second term, from 21 DAH until settlement (65 DAH).

40|$|A {{numerical}} model to predict boil-off of stored propellant in large spherical cryogenic tanks has been developed. Accurate prediction of <b>tank</b> boil-off <b>rates</b> for different thermal insulation systems was {{the goal of}} this collaboration effort. The Generalized Fluid System Simulation Program, integrating flow analysis and conjugate heat transfer for solving complex fluid system problems, was used to create the model. Calculation of <b>tank</b> boil-off <b>rate</b> requires simultaneous simulation of heat transfer processes among liquid propellant, vapor ullage space, and tank structure. The reference tank for the boil-off model was the 850, 000 gallon liquid hydrogen tank at Launch Complex 39 B (LC- 39 B) at Kennedy Space Center, which is under study for future infrastructure improvements to support the Constellation program. The methodology employed in the {{numerical model}} was validated using a sub-scale model and tank. Experimental test data from a 1 / 15 th scale version of the LC- 39 B tank using both liquid hydrogen and liquid nitrogen were used to anchor the analytical predictions of the sub-scale model.

40|$|An {{analysis}} is conducted of the 1996 - 1998 Hanford tank ventilation studies of average ventilation rates to help define characteristics of shorter term releases. This effort is being conducted {{as part of}} the design of tests of Industrial Hygiene’s (IH) instrumentation ability to detect transient airborne plumes from tanks using current deployment strategies for tank operations. This analysis has improved our understanding of the variability of hourly average tank ventilation processes. However, the analysis was unable to discern the relative importance of emissions due to continuous releases and short-duration bursts of material. The key findings are as follows: 1. The ventilation of relatively well-sealed, passively ventilated tanks appears to be driven by a combination of pressure, buoyancy, and wind influences. The results of a best-fit analysis conducted with a single data set provide information on the hourly emission variability that IH instrumentation will need to detect. 2. <b>Tank</b> ventilation <b>rates</b> and <b>tank</b> emission <b>rates</b> are not the same. The studies found that the measured infiltration rates for a single tank are often a complex function of air exchanges between tanks and air exchanges with outdoor air. This situation greatly limits the usefulness of the ventilation data in defining vapor emission rates. 3. There is no evidence in the data to discern if the routine tank vapor releases occur over a short time (i. e., a puff) or over an extended time (i. e., continuous releases). Based on this analysis of the tank ventilation studies, it is also noted that 1) the hourly averaged emission peaks from the relatively well-sealed passively-vented tanks (such as U- 103) are not a simple function of one meteorological parameter – but the peaks often are the result of the coincidence of temporal maximums in pressure, temperature, and wind influences and 2) a mechanistic combination modeling approach and/or field studies may be necessary to understand the short-term temporal characteristics of transient releases - This requirement has implications in both the design of IH field tests and in understanding transient plumes during the times that worker complaints were recorded...|$|R

40|$|AbstractOnboard the Norwegian Coast Guard vessel KV Bergen, as well {{as other}} LNG fuelled vessels, there has been reports of a sudden fall in the fuel tank system pressure, {{resulting}} in de-loading of the NG engines. This study examines the factors which caused the LNG tank pressure on KV Bergen to fall, leading to the de-loading of the Natural Gas (NG) engines. One reason for the drop in tank pressure is that external disturbances from rough seas destroy the liquid surface layer, causing an increase in the rate of condensation occurring inside the <b>tank.</b> The <b>rate</b> of heat and mass transferred to the vapor section by the Pressure Build Up (PBU) unit is less than the heat and mass absorbed during the mixing inside the LNG tank.
