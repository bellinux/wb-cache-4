5|$|A major railway, {{known as}} the Eurasian Land Bridge allows goods to be transported from China and the EEU to Europe. An {{expansion}} of the original railway line named the New Eurasian Land Bridge provides an uninterrupted rail link between China and the EEU.

5|$|As {{manpower}} shortages on the Western Front {{began to}} become acute, a second plebiscite {{was held on}} 20 December 1917. This time it was defeated by an even greater margin of 94,152 votes. This effectively {{put an end to}} plans <b>to</b> <b>expand</b> <b>the</b> AIF in France and ultimately led to severe manpower shortages that the AIF in France experienced in 1917 and 1918. As a result, plans <b>to</b> <b>expand</b> <b>the</b> force to a 6th Division were shelved and its manpower distributed amongst the other five divisions, while the five divisions were amalgamated together under the banner of the Australian Corps, thus effectively allowing the 4th Division, which was struggling to maintain its numbers to act as a depot formation within the Corps with the other three divisions providing most of the combat power.|$|E

5|$|Historians {{debate whether}} Otto von Bismarck—Minister President of Prussia—had {{a master plan}} <b>to</b> <b>expand</b> <b>the</b> North German Confederation of 1866 to include the {{remaining}} independent German states into a single entity or simply <b>to</b> <b>expand</b> <b>the</b> power of the Kingdom of Prussia. They conclude that factors {{in addition to the}} strength of Bismarck's Realpolitik led a collection of early modern polities to reorganize political, economic, military, and diplomatic relationships in the 19th century. Reaction to Danish and French nationalism provided foci for expressions of German unity. Military successes—especially those of Prussia—in three regional wars generated enthusiasm and pride that politicians could harness to promote unification. This experience echoed the memory of mutual accomplishment in the Napoleonic Wars, particularly in the War of Liberation of 1813–14. By establishing a Germany without Austria, the political and administrative unification in 1871 at least temporarily solved the problem of dualism.|$|E
