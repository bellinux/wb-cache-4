40|$|In {{order to}} make a long rail of high carbon steel for railroad, about 300 m long rails are {{prepared}} in shop of JNR by flash butt welding. After that enclosed are welding or telmit welding are used in the field but in some case only enclosed are welding is used to build up a long rail. The life of heat-treated rail is three to five times of as <b>rolled</b> <b>rail.</b> Today, commonly speaking, only as <b>rolled</b> <b>rails</b> are used to make a long rail. However, heat-treated long rails are desired at private railways. Therefore, fatigue characteristics of both as <b>rolled</b> and heat-treated <b>rails</b> are investigated and the latter showed better fatigue properties. Impact properties of as <b>rolled</b> <b>rails</b> are reported in the previous report and those of heat-treated rails are investigated now. Impact properties of heat-treated rails seem to be better than those of as rolled ones. These results will be reported in the next paper...|$|R

On low speed machines these table elements are primarily <b>table</b> <b>rolls.</b> As speed increases the suction developed in the nip of a <b>table</b> <b>roll</b> increases and at high enough speed the wire snaps back after leaving the vacuum area and causes stock to jump off the wire, disrupting the formation. To prevent this drainage foils are used. The foils are typically sloped between zero and two or three degrees and give a more gentle action. Where rolls and foils are used, rolls are used near the headbox and foils further down machine.|$|R

50|$|Wrought iron {{was used}} for minor {{structural}} and decorative elements starting in the 18th century. Until the mid-19th century, the use of wrought iron in buildings was generally limited to small items such as tie rods, straps, nails, and hardware, or to decorative ironwork in balconies, railings fences and gates. Around 1850 its structural use became more widespread as iron mills began to <b>roll</b> <b>rails,</b> bulb-tees, and eventually I-beams. It was also used for decorative purposes, such as ornamental balconies or hardware. Since wrought iron is handmade, no two pieces are identical.|$|R
6000|$|Our firm is a Steel Corporation. We <b>roll</b> <b>rails.</b> As {{soon as we}} {{read your}} {{circular}} on the Stimulus of Competition we saw that there were big things in it. At once we sent one of our chief managers to the rolling, mill. He carried a paper bag in his hand. [...] "Now boys," [...] he said, [...] "every man who <b>rolls</b> a <b>rail</b> gets a gum-drop." [...] The effect was magical. The good fellows felt a new stimulus. They now <b>roll</b> out <b>rails</b> like dough. Work is a joy to them. Every Saturday night {{the man who has}} rolled most gets a blue ribbon; the man who has rolled the next most, a green ribbon; the next most a yellow ribbon, and so on through the spectroscope. The man who rolls least gets only a red ribbon. It is a real pleasure to see the brave fellows clamouring for their ribbons. Our output, after defraying the entire cost of the ribbons and the gum-drops, has increased forty per cent. We intend to carry the scheme further by allowing all the men who get a hundred blue ribbons first, to exchange them for the Grand Efficiency Prize of the firm,--a pink ribbon. This the winner will be entitled to wear whenever and wherever he sees fit to wear it.|$|R

There were no steel mills in America capable of rolling long lengths, so he sailed to England which {{was the only place}} where his flanged T rail (also called T-section) could be rolled.

40|$|AbstractA {{modal shift}} to rail {{is crucial to}} {{achieving}} a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, relieving urban congestion and providing increased mobility. In order to successfully meet this growing demand for efficient and green mobility, the railway sector needs to progress in terms of quality of service, energy and life cycle costs, interoperability, capacity, noise reduction and must also further develop its carbon emission advantages. <b>Roll</b> 2 <b>Rail</b> is a research project which aims to develop key technologies that will overcome hurdles to innovation in rolling stock development and forms part of a longer term strategy towards revolutionising the rolling stock of today. The results {{will contribute to the}} increase of operational reliability and to the reduction of the life cycle costs. This project started in May 2015 and it is supported by the Horizon 2020 programme of the European Commission (www. <b>roll</b> 2 <b>rail.</b> eu). <b>Roll</b> 2 <b>Rail</b> is one of the so called “lighthouse projects” of the Shift 2 Rail Joint Undertaking and will contribute to Innovation Programme 1. At the end of the project the outcomes will be incorporated into real vehicles or relevant environments within the Technical Demonstrators of Shift 2 <b>Rail.</b> In particular, <b>Roll</b> 2 <b>Rail</b> focuses on technological innovations in different subsystems of the vehicles which, individually, each and all together, contribute to achieve the desired impact at vehicle and whole railway system level on capacity, reliability, efficiency, comfort and life cycle costs. The project expects innovations in 8 different areas such as traction and power electronics, train communications, car bodyshell, running gear technologies, brakes, train interiors, noise and vibration and energy performance. Moreover, this project will deliver a set of technical recommendations and proposals of standardisation.

40|$|Simulation {{tools are}} now widely {{used to predict}} the dynamic {{behaviour}} of railway vehicles {{and they have been}} developed to include highly complex vehicle models which can represent non-linear wheel–rail contact and suspension characteristics. Less emphasis has so far been placed on the track models used in these simulations which have tended to be fairly simple linear representations of the track and subgrade although these can also contain significant discrete non-linearities. This paper first reviews the track models used in current railway vehicle dynamic software and identifies their main limitations. The particular focus of the work reported here is the <b>rail</b> <b>roll</b> degree of freedom (DOF) and its influence on the wheel–rail contact condition. The rigid body track model in the software tool VI-Rail powered by MSC Adams is modified to fully take into account <b>rail</b> <b>roll</b> in combination with the non-linear on-line contact algorithm. Various static and dynamic track cases are designed to test the hypothesis that <b>rail</b> <b>roll</b> may affect the contact condition. Results show the influence of the dynamic <b>rail</b> <b>roll</b> on the location of the contact between the wheel and rail and some analysis is made into the implications this may have on wear and rolling contact fatigue calculations among other applications...|$|R

50|$|The early {{cast iron}} rails of the 18th century and before used {{integral}} fixings for nailing or bolting to the railroad ties.

The introduction of <b>rolled</b> <b>rail</b> profiles in the 1820s such as the single flanged T parallel rail and later double flanged T parallel rail required the use of chairs, keys to hold the rail, and bolts or spikes to fix the chair. The flat bottomed rail invented by Robert L. Stevens in 1830 was initially spiked directly to wooden sleepers, later tie plates were used to spread the load and also keep the rail in gauge with inbuilt shoulders in the plate. Outside North America {{a wide variety of}} spring based fastening systems were later introduced in combination with baseplates and flat bottomed rail, these are now ubiquitous on main line high speed railways.|$|R

40|$|Four {{kinds of}} rail steels were tested to {{investigate}} the wear behaviors of wheel–rail materials under three kinds of axle loads. Results indicate {{that the increase in}} axle load not only significantly enlarges the wear loss but also enlarges the depth and the length of the fatigue cracks. However, with the decreases in the hardness ratios, some ripples are exhibited on the surface, and the wear surfaces become much rougher; the subsurface analyses deliver the presence of extremely rough surface, and the deformation depths are irregular. The relationship between the total wear loss of the wheel/rail system and the hardness ratio indicates that the hardness ratio of wheel/rail steels has slight impact on the total wear loss at a low axle load; however, the decrease in the hardness ratio enlarges the total wear loss significantly at a high axle load. In summary, a quenched rail should be chosen for the heavy-haul railway, and the hardness of the wheel steel should be raised to a degree close to the rail. However, a hot <b>rolled</b> <b>rail</b> is much suitable for the high-speed railway, and the wheel hardness should be smaller than the rail...|$|R
