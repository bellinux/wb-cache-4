40|$|AbstractIn centrosome-containing cells, microtubules {{utilized}} in spindle formation {{are thought to}} be nucleated at the centrosome. However, spindle formation can proceed following experimental destruction of centrosomes [1] or in cells lacking centrosomes [2], suggesting that non-centrosome-associated microtubules may contribute to spindle formation, at least when centrosomes are absent. Direct observation of prometaphase cells expressing GFP-α-tubulin shows that peripheral, non-centrosome-associated microtubules are {{utilized in}} spindle formation, even in the presence of centrosomes. Clusters of peripheral microtubules moved into the centrosomal region, demonstrating that a centrosomal microtubule array can be composed of both centrosomally nucleated and peripheral microtubules. Peripheral bundles also moved laterally into the forming spindle between the spindle poles; 3 D reconstructions of fixed cells reveal interactions between peripheral and centrosome-associated microtubules. The spindle pole component NuMA and γ-tubulin were present at the foci of peripheral microtubule clusters, indicating that microtubules moved into the spindle with minus ends leading. Photobleach- and photoactivation-marking experiments of cells expressing GFP-tubulin or a photoactivatable variant of GFP-tubulin, respectively, demonstrate that microtubule motion into the forming spindle results from <b>transport</b> and <b>sliding</b> interactions, not treadmilling.

40|$|The kinesin {{superfamily}} of microtubule associated motor proteins share {{a characteristic}} motor domain which both hydrolyses ATP and binds microtubules. Kinesins display differences across the superfamily both in ATP turnover and in microtubule interaction. These differences tailor specific kinesins to various {{functions such as}} cargo <b>transport,</b> microtubule <b>sliding,</b> microtubule depolymerization and microtubule stabilization. To understand the mechanism of action of a kinesin {{it is important to}} understand how the chemical cycle of ATP turnover is coupled to the mechanical cycle of microtubule interaction. To dissect the ATP turnover cycle, one approach is to utilize fluorescently labeled nucleotides to visualize individual steps in the cycle. Determining the kinetics of each nucleotide transition in the ATP turnover cycle allows the rate-limiting step or steps for the complete cycle to be identified. For a kinesin, it is important to know the rate-limiting step, in the absence of microtubules, as this step is generally accelerated several thousand fold when the kinesin interacts with microtubules. The cycle in the absence of microtubules is then compared to that in the presence of microtubules to fully understand a kinesin’s ATP turnover cycle. The kinetics of individual nucleotide transitions are generally too fast to observe by manually mixing reactants, particularly in the presence of microtubules. A rapid mixing device...|$|R

40|$|This journal {{article is}} Restricted Acccess. It was {{published}} in the journal Transportation Research, Part D : Transport and Environment [© Elsevier] and is available at: [URL] recent years, a growing awareness of the environmental impacts of transport has played a major part in the shift towards policies to manage the demand for travel. As a result, a substantial increase in the role of public transport has been identified as necessary in any strategy towards more environmentally sustainable transport patterns. At the same time there has been a quite separate process of deregulation and the withdrawal of the state from the transport market. These two trends appear to represent potentially contradictory processes. This article draws upon two major studies that explore the relationship between increasing needs for environmental regulation and the privatisation of bus and rail services. It is shown that, as currently organised in Britain, the development of bus and rail services are inadequately linked to strategic environmental policymaking and, rather than being part of the solution to transport’s environmental impacts, there is a real danger that these ‘green’ methods of <b>transport</b> could <b>slide</b> into simply being part of the problem itself.

30|$|Through field {{investigation}} of the long runout landslides triggered by the Wenchuan earthquake and experimental study of the Donghekou complex landslide, in particular, {{it was found that}} the valley water and groundwater played key roles in the long runout and rapid landslide motion during the great earthquake. In reality, there is only limited information on the actual rainfall, valley water, and ground water conditions during the earthquake. It is suggested that in the source area, the landslide gained velocity when the “sliding surface liquefaction” phenomenon occurred as a result of undrained shearing in a saturated sliding zone. In turn, the displaced sliding mass can exert an impact on the valley deposit. When the valley deposit is also saturated, liquefaction can occur causing the valley deposit to work as a sliding zone with low shear resistance, <b>transporting</b> the <b>sliding</b> mass from the source area for a long distance. There may be other mechanisms for rapid and long runout landslides triggered by the earthquake, however, the hydrogeological condition in the source area and traveling path is certainly a key factor in controlling the shear resistance, and should be considered seriously in risk assessments for landslide disaster reduction. Impacts and losses depended upon whether the landslide moved but was abruptly stopped, and whether the landslides moved for a long distance with high speed. It would be useful if more earthquake-induced landslide case studies using methods outlined in this paper were to be analyzed. We could then be closer to concluding whether there are the same and/or additional variables that affect rate of movement, extent of movement and their relationships to the rates of death and damage.|$|R
30|$|The {{computed}} maximum inundation depth was 6  m at {{the shore}} and decreased inland. The maximum flow velocity was 9  m/s {{at the shore}} and this, too, decreased inland. Here, we estimated the maximum flow velocity by averaging the flow velocity from the inundated surface to the bottom.The flow velocity (5.0  m/s) at the distance of 36  m is only larger than the flow velocity (3.1  m/s) necessary to cause boulders at that location to move by rolling (Figure  7 E).The boulder at the distance of 36  m was marked, which suggests rolling transportation by the waves of the typhoon. The boulder also held some grass {{that appeared to be}} growing downwards (Figure  7 B), suggesting that the boulder had recently been moved by rolling. Such marks were not found on the other boulders. If the boulders were to move by sliding, a flow velocity of 1.8 to 3.5  m/s would be required. As the computed flow velocities were over 3 to 4  m/s at the positions of the boulders (distances within 60  m) (Figure  7 E), it would be expected that almost all boulders would start to move if boulders were <b>transported</b> by <b>sliding.</b> On the other hand, the boulders would not move within the distance range of 40 to 80  m, but would move at the distance of 36  m, if the mode of transport were rolling (Figure  7 E). Moreover, if the boulders were to move by saltation, a flow velocity of 5.7 to 9.9  m/s would be required. This flow velocity is larger than the computed flow velocity at the positions of the boulders. Thus, we assume that the boulders moved by rolling. Thus, the calculation could well reproduce the runup of actual storm wave, and the numerical simulation using the CADMAS-SURF is useful for the reproduction of storm waves.|$|R

This result strongly supports a one-site model in which a single transport site alternates between distinct inward- and outward-facing conformations. The rate-limiting step in the transport process is translocation of the transport site between the two conformations, since the beta-D-glucose binding and dissociation events at both the inward- and outward-facing transport sites are shown to be fast compared to the known turnover rate of the glucose transport cycle.

40|$|Abstract. Theoretical {{model of}} current {{conversion}} from normal to collective current in mesoscopic samples of CDW conductors is presented. The current conversion {{is described in}} terms of phase slips (PS) induced by strain of the CDW and stimulated by thermal fluctuations. Kernels of PS situated near contacts are surrounded by long-range perturbations of the CDW phase. If spacing between contacts is shorter than decaying length of these perturbations then temporal evolution of PS at different contacts becomes correlated, and PS voltage decreases with spacing between the contacts decreasing. The results are in qualitative agreement with experimental study of current conversion in submicron NbSe 3 wires. Formation of the CDW in quasi-one-dimensional conductors gives rise to a collective mechanism ol electron <b>transport</b> related to <b>sliding</b> motion of the CDW. At the interface between a CDW conductor there must be conversion from the single-electron current in the normal metal to the collective CDW current inside the CDW conductor. The conversion occurs in a form of phase slip (PS) processes induced by a CDW strain near the current contact which results in periodic suppression of the CDW amplitude [1, 2]. PS removes the strain and enables to add or to remove a wave front of the CDW near a contact. Current conversion and related CDW strain near current contacts were extensively studied experimentally [3 - 7). The strain of the CDW near contacts was found to induce an additional voltage drop called PS voltage...|$|R

In this study, a bio-safe USP (Universal Sample Processing) concentration-based sputum processing method (Bio-safe method) was assessed on 87 M. tuberculosis culture positive sputum samples. Samples were processed for Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) smear, liquid culture and DNA isolation. DNA isolated directly from sputum was subjected to an IS 6110 PCR assay. Both sputum DNA and DNA extracted from bio-safe ZN concentrated smear slides were subjected to rpoB PCR and simultaneously assessed by DNA sequencing for determining rifampin (RIF) resistance. All sputum samples were rendered sterile by Bio-safe method. Bio-safe smears exhibited a 5 % increment in positivity over direct smear with a 14 % increment in smear grade status. All samples were positive for IS 6110 and rpoB PCR. Thirty four percent samples were RIF resistant by rpoB PCR product sequencing. A 100 % concordance (κ value = 1) was obtained between sequencing results derived from bio-safe smear slides and bio-safe sputum. This study demonstrates that Bio-safe method can address safety issues associated with sputum processing, provide an efficient alternative to sample transport in the form of bio-safe stained concentrated smear slides and can also provide information on drug (RIF) resistance by direct DNA sequencing...|$|R
40|$|Slope {{processes}} such as {{slides and}} debris flows, are among the main events that induce effects on the Rio Grande sediment <b>transport</b> capacity. The <b>slides</b> mainly affect {{the slope of the}} Rio Grande river basin while debris and mud flows phenomena take place in the tributary valleys. In the past decades several mass movements occurred causing victims and great damages to roads and villages and therefore hazard assessment and risk mitigation is of paramount importance for a correct development of the area. This is also an urgent need since the Quebrada de Humahuaca was recently included in the UNESCO World Cultural Heritage. The growing tourism business may lead to an uncontrolled urbanization of the valley with the consequent enlargement of threatened areas. In this framework mitigation measures {{have to take into account}} not only technical aspects related to the physical behaviour of the moving masses but also environmental and sociological factors that could influence the effectiveness of the countermeasures. Mitigation of landslide effects is indeed rather complex because of the large extension of the territory and the particular geological and geomorphological setting. Moreover the necessity to maintain the natural condition of the area as prescribed by UNESCO, make this task even more difficult. Nowadays no in-depth study of the entire area exists, therefore an integrated and multidisciplinary investigation plan is going to be set up including geological and geomorphological investigations as well as archaeological and historical surveys. The better understanding of geomorphological evolution processes of the Quebrada de Humahuaca will bridge the gap between the necessity of preservation and the request of safety keeping of the recommendation by UNESCO...|$|R
