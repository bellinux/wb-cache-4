5|$|An edition called OGRE: Deluxe Edition was {{released}} in 1987. The rulebook cover artwork was the Denis Loubet illustration that was also used for the Ogre computer game (see Spinoffs below). The board was sturdier than the previous edition's paper map, and <b>the</b> <b>counters</b> were provided with stand-up plastic bases. G.M. magazine's 1989 review of OGRE: Deluxe Edition highlighted the game's ease of introduction and short playing time, but pointed out that most gamers either like the game or loathe it.|$|E
5|$|At Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport, EVA Air has {{introduced}} the EVA Air Check-in Kiosks at T2, counters 6A, allowing passengers {{to check in}} and print their boarding passes electronically, since December 2009. The kiosks are currently available at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport and Taipei Songshan Airport. Over time, EVA will install these counters in airports in China and other international EVA Air destinations. Outside of Taiwan, it is only currently available in Los Angeles, Tokyo, and Osaka. Previously, if passengers were to check in for an EVA Air flight, {{they would have to}} go to an airline representative at <b>the</b> <b>counters.</b>|$|E
5|$|The second sit-in {{occurred}} on Thursday, February 18, {{when more than}} 200 students entered Woolworths, S. H. Kress, McClellan, and Grants. The lunch counters were immediately closed. The students remained for {{about half an hour}} and then left, again without incident. The third sit-in {{occurred on}} February 20 when about 350 students entered the previous four stores and the downtown Walgreens drugstore. As the students sat at <b>the</b> <b>counters,</b> crowds of white youths gathered in several of the stores. Police kept a watchful eye on all five locations, but no incidents of violence occurred. The students remained for nearly three hours until adjourning to a mass meeting at the First Baptist Church.|$|E

There the babies find popcorn, orange and grape sodas, lids, napkins, cups, candy bars, ketchup, mustard and straws (the two teenage employees in charge, Larry and Steve, don't notice the babies because they're arguing over comic books). Tommy checks the popcorn both for Reptar, while Phil and Lil take {{interest in the}} soda dispensers, pushing the buttons and spilling the soft drinks on <b>the</b> <b>counters</b> and floors until eventually they get stuck continuously pouring soda. Meanwhile, Chuckie, after sampling some candy, notices some stairs leading up while Phil and Lil start playing with the ketchup and mustard dispensers by the hot dog sections. Phil & Lil plays with straws and spill all the straws. After Chuckie points out the stairs, Tommy concludes they'll find Reptar upstairs. As soon as the babies leave, the two teenagers notice the massive mess and scream.|$|E

50|$|The {{one-shot}} is retriggerable, hence OUT {{will remain}} low for N CLK pulses after any trigger. The one-shot pulse can be repeated without rewriting the same count into <b>the</b> <b>counter.</b> GATE {{has no effect}} on OUT. If a new count is written to <b>the</b> <b>Counter</b> during a oneshot pulse, the current one-shot is not affected unless <b>the</b> <b>counter</b> is retriggered. In that case, <b>the</b> <b>Counter</b> is loaded with the new count and the oneshot pulse continues until the new count expires.|$|R

25|$|Interrupts {{could be}} {{triggered}} when <b>the</b> <b>counters</b> overflowed. The T3rupt and Dsrupt interrupts were produced when their counters, {{driven by a}} 100Hz hardware clock, overflowed after executing many Pinc subsequences. The Uprupt interrupt was triggered after its counter, executing the Shinc subsequence, had shifted 16bits of uplink data into the AGC.|$|E
25|$|The AGC {{also had}} 20 {{involuntary}} counters. These were memory locations which functioned as up/down counters, or shift registers. <b>The</b> <b>counters</b> would increment, decrement, or shift {{in response to}} internal inputs. The increment (Pinc), decrement (Minc), or shift (Shinc) was handled by one subsequence of microinstructions inserted between any two regular instructions.|$|E

40|$|Cost and {{convenience}} {{seem to be}} major factors in determining whether, given the choice, patients purchase a medicine over <b>the</b> <b>counter</b> or obtain it on prescription. With current arrangements, exemption from prescription charges provides an incentive to continue to obtain products on NHS prescription {{even when they are}} available over <b>the</b> <b>counter.</b> There is therefore no simple relation between the availability of over <b>the</b> <b>counter</b> medicines and <b>the</b> level of prescribing of deregulated products. The appropriate use of over <b>the</b> <b>counter</b> medicines [...] particularly those that have only recently been deregulated [...] places a burden of care on community pharmacists and calls for closer working relationships with general practitioners. In particular, systems for referral and for recording details of both prescribed and over <b>the</b> <b>counter</b> medicines need to be developed, and a direct route needs to be established for community pharmacists to report adverse drug reactions to over <b>the</b> <b>counter</b> products...|$|R

These are used to determine various properties of a charged particle such as its velocity, charge, direction of motion, and energy. These properties are important in the identification of different particles. For example, <b>the</b> <b>counters</b> were applied in the discovery of the antiproton and the J particle. Six large Cherenkov counters were used in the discovery of the J particle.|$|E
25|$|Federation Commander Booster Packs {{are small}} {{selections}} of ship cards (6-8) which {{are associated with}} a main product. There are three booster packs for each Border or Attack set. The distribution of the cards is fixed. Owning any main Border or Attack set plus all three associated boosters mean a player will have exactly the same number and type of ship cards as <b>the</b> <b>counters</b> in the main set.

25|$|Advanced Squad Leader (ASL) is a tactical-level board wargame, {{originally}} marketed by Avalon Hill Games, that simulates {{actions of}} approximately company or battalion size in World War II. It is a detailed game system {{for two or}} more players (with solitary play also possible). Components include the ASL Rulebook and various games called modules. ASL modules provide the standard equipment for playing ASL, including geomorphic mapboards and counters. The mapboards are divided into hexagons to regulate fire and movement, and depict generic terrain that can represent different historical locations. <b>The</b> <b>counters</b> are cardboard pieces that depict squads of soldiers, crews, individual leaders, support weapons, heavy weapons, and vehicles.|$|E
