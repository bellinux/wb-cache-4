2500|$|Alternative II, {{popularly known}} as the Europlug, is a flat plug. It is also defined by Cenelec {{standard}} EN50075 [...] "Flat non-rewirable <b>two-pole</b> <b>plugs,</b> 2.5 A 250 V, with cord, for the connection of class II-equipment for household and similar purposes", which has national equivalents in most European countries, as described in IEC60083. The Europlug is not rewirable and must be supplied with a flexible cord. Because it is unpolarised, it can be inserted in either direction into a socket, so line and neutral are connected arbitrarily.|$|R

2500|$|Most of North America and Central America, {{and some}} of South America, use {{connectors}} standardized by the National Electrical Manufacturers Association. The devices are named using the format NEMA n-mmX, where n is an identifier for the configuration of pins and blades, mm is the maximum amperage, and X is either P for plug or R for receptacle. For example, NEMA 5-15R is a configuration type 5 receptacle supporting 15 amps. Corresponding P and R versions {{are designed to be}} mated. The prefix, L, is added for the locking types; a 15A 120V <b>two-pole</b> grounding <b>plug</b> is designated NEMA L5-15P. Twist-locking types are used for additional protection from accidental disconnection, or to prevent interchange with parallel blade types ...|$|R

2500|$|The first British {{standard}} for domestic three-pin plugs was BS317 Hand-Shield and Side Entry Pattern Three-Pin Wall Plugs and Sockets (Two Pin and Earth Type) published in 1928.

2500|$|The {{earliest}} domestic {{plug and}} socket {{is believed to be}} that patented by T.T. Smith in 1883. [...] This was shortly followed by patents from WB Sayers and G Hookham; these early designs had rectangular plugs with contact plates on either side. In 1885, two-pin plug designs appeared and in 1889 there were two-pin plugs and sockets in the GEC catalogue. [...] The 1893 GEC Catalogue included 3 sizes of what was described as Double plug Sockets with capacities described not in amps, but as 1 to 5 lights, 5 to 10 lights and 10 to 20 lights. [...] These were clearly recognisable as two-pin plugs and sockets, but with no indication as to pin size or spacing, they were sold as pairs. [...] The same catalogue included lampholder plugs for both BC and ES lampholders (capacity unspecified), and also a type of <b>two-pole</b> concentric <b>plug</b> and socket (similar to a very large versions of the concentric connectors used for laptop PC power connections) in the 1 to 5 lights and 5 to 10 lights capacities. [...] Crompton and Company introduced the first two-pin socket with protective shutters in 1893, the Edison Swan Company was also manufacturing two-pin {{plug and socket}}s in the 1890s.|$|R
