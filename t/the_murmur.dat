25|$|A mid-diastolic {{rumbling}} murmur with presystolic accentuation will {{be heard}} after the opening snap. <b>The</b> <b>murmur</b> is best heard at the apical region and is not radiated. Since it is a low-pitch sound, it is heard best with the bell of the stethoscope. Its duration increases with worsening disease. Rolling the patient toward left as well as isometric exercise will accentuate <b>the</b> <b>murmur.</b> A thrill might be present when palpating at the apical region of the precordium.|$|E

25|$|Heart murmurs are {{generated}} by turbulent flow of blood, which may occur {{inside or outside}} the heart. Murmurs may be physiological (benign) or pathological (abnormal). Abnormal murmurs {{can be caused by}} stenosis restricting the opening of a heart valve, resulting in turbulence as blood flows through it. Abnormal murmurs may also occur with valvular insufficiency (regurgitation), which allows backflow of blood when the incompetent valve closes with only partial effectiveness. Different murmurs are audible {{in different parts of the}} cardiac cycle, depending on the cause of <b>the</b> <b>murmur.</b>|$|E

25|$|Findings on {{clinical}} examination {{depend on the}} severity and duration of MI. The mitral component of the first heart sound is usually soft and with a laterally displaced apex beat, often with heave. The first heart sound {{is followed by a}} high-pitched holosystolic murmur at the apex, radiating to the back or clavicular area. Its duration is, as the name suggests, the whole of systole. The loudness of <b>the</b> <b>murmur</b> does not correlate well with the severity of regurgitation. It may be followed by a loud, palpable P2, heard best when lying on the left side. A third heart sound is commonly heard.|$|E
25|$|If {{there is}} {{increased}} stroke {{volume of the}} left ventricle due to volume overload, an ejection systolic 'flow' murmur may also be present when auscultating the same aortic area. Unless there is concomitant aortic valve stenosis, <b>the</b> <b>murmur</b> should not start with an ejection click.There may also be an Austin Flint murmur, a soft mid-diastolic rumble heard at the apical area, it appears when regurgitant jet from the severe aortic insufficiency renders partial closure of the anterior mitral leaflet.Peripheral physical signs of aortic insufficiency {{are related to the}} high pulse pressure and the rapid decrease in blood pressure during diastole due to blood returning to the heart from the aorta through the incompetent aortic valve, although the usefulness of some of the eponymous signs has been questioned: Phonocardiograms detect AI by having electric voltage mimic the sounds the heart makes.|$|E
2500|$|Heart murmurs are sounds {{generated}} by blood {{flowing through the}} structures of the heart. [...] The location of the Still's murmur on examination suggests resonation {{of blood in the}} left ventricular outflow tract and aorta, and this is supported by studies that have shown that <b>the</b> <b>murmur</b> is more intense over the aortic valve than the pulmonary valve. [...] There has been conjecture that the vibratory or musical quality of <b>the</b> <b>murmur</b> is caused by vibration of “false chordae” of the left ventricle, which are a common finding in normal individuals, but no relationship between the two has been proven. [...] There is some evidence that a smaller aorta with higher peak flow velocities are associated with Still’s murmur, which certainly fits in well with the concept that <b>the</b> <b>murmur</b> is a musical phenomenon.|$|E

2500|$|Though several {{different}} cardiac conditions can cause heart murmurs, the murmurs can change markedly with {{the severity of}} the cardiac disease. [...] An astute physician can sometimes diagnose cardiac conditions with some accuracy based largely on <b>the</b> <b>murmur,</b> related physical examination, and experience with the relative frequency of different heart conditions. However, with the advent of better quality and wider availability of echocardiography and other techniques, heart status can be recognized and quantified much more accurately than formerly possible with only a stethoscope, examination, and experience. Another advantage {{to the use of the}} echocardiogram is that the devices can be hand held.|$|E
2500|$|Still’s murmur is {{diagnosed}} {{in the course}} of a physical examination of the patient, usually using a stethoscope. [...] <b>The</b> <b>murmur</b> has a vibratory quality that can be detected as a regular frequency on phonocardiography, although this type of testing is now rarely used. [...] Additional testing including electrocardiography (ECG or EKG) or echocardiography may be helpful in ruling out other conditions, particularly if the physical examination is not completely characteristic of Still’s murmur. [...] When additional testing is done in the setting of Still’s murmur the results are normal, since Still’s murmur is not associated with any sort of cardiovascular pathology.|$|E

[...] Their concerns included: the need for medicine (49%), facing sports restrictions (41%), the need for heart surgery (29%), other offspring also having Still's murmur (20%), and early death (13%). Mothers worried that they did something during pregnancy that caused <b>the</b> <b>murmur</b> (19%). Even after being reassured by the child's physician, 17% of parents were still anxious. After hearing from a cardiologist that the children would be fine, only 7% of the parents were still nervous.|$|E

The track was written by the band's lead vocalist, lead guitarist and front man, Daniel Johns, and their drummer-percussionist, Ben Gillies. It was produced and engineered by Phil McKellar at national radio station, Triple J's studios for SBS-TV's show, Nomad, which aired on 16 June 1994.
