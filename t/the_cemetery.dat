5|$|Although the Act of 1975 had {{specified}} that {{a portion of}} the profits from land sales be used to maintain the remaining cemetery, little restoration work was done and <b>the</b> <b>cemetery</b> continued to revert to wilderness. With the new owners of the land interested only in redeveloping those parts of <b>the</b> <b>cemetery</b> not currently in use, <b>the</b> <b>cemetery</b> itself sank further into neglect.|$|E
5|$|With the {{ambition}} to become London's sole burial site in perpetuity, the LNC {{were aware that}} if their plans were successful, their Necropolis would become a site of major national importance. As a consequence, <b>the</b> <b>cemetery</b> was designed with attractiveness in mind, {{in contrast to the}} squalid and congested London burial grounds and the newer suburban cemeteries which were already becoming crowded. The LNC aimed to create an atmosphere of perpetual spring in <b>the</b> <b>cemetery,</b> and chose the plants for <b>the</b> <b>cemetery</b> accordingly. It had already been noted that evergreen plants from North America thrived in the local soil. Robert Donald, the owner of an arboretum near Woking, was contracted to supply the trees and shrubs for <b>the</b> <b>cemetery.</b> The railway line through <b>the</b> <b>cemetery</b> and the major roads and paths within <b>the</b> <b>cemetery</b> were lined with giant sequoia trees, the first significant planting of these trees (only introduced to Europe in 1853) in Britain. As well as the giant sequoias, the grounds were heavily planted with magnolia, rhododendron, coastal redwood, azalea, andromeda and monkeypuzzle, with the intention of creating perpetual greenery with large numbers of flowers and a strong floral scent throughout <b>the</b> <b>cemetery.</b>|$|E
5|$|A stuccoed brick {{fence with}} cast iron gates and an iron Star of David enclose <b>the</b> <b>cemetery.</b> Within the walls, {{there are two}} main {{pathways}} which meet in the center of <b>the</b> <b>cemetery</b> at a circular decorative piece including a fountain. The oldest graves are in the northern half of <b>the</b> <b>cemetery</b> while newer graves were added progressively south. Many grave sites are adorned with well-maintained Victorian era funerary art, which gives <b>the</b> <b>cemetery</b> its historic significance. Among the monuments include the grave enclosure of the Winner family, which includes a bronze bust of Mark Winner, and two marble angels at the entrance of the plot. Other examples include the grave of David L. Rosenbaum, topped with marble shoes and stockings, the grave of Julius Elson, marked by a carved marble fainting couch, and a memorial to Mattimore Meyer, featuring a marble angel.|$|E

5|$|A typical {{cemetery}} {{is surrounded}} by a low wall or hedge and with a wrought-iron gate entrance. For cemeteries in France and Belgium, a land tablet near the entrance or along a wall identifies <b>the</b> <b>cemetery</b> grounds as having been provided by the French or Belgian governments. All but the smallest cemeteries contain a register with an inventory of the burials, a plan of the plots and rows, and a basic history of <b>the</b> <b>cemetery.</b> The register is located within a metal cupboard that is marked with a cross located in either the wall near <b>the</b> <b>cemetery</b> entrance or in a shelter within <b>the</b> <b>cemetery.</b> More recently, in larger sites, a stainless steel notice gives details of the respective military campaign. The headstones within <b>the</b> <b>cemetery</b> are of a uniform size and design and mark plots of equal size.|$|E

5|$|As Alliance Property and the Great Southern Group had {{between them}} {{stripped}} all assets other than <b>the</b> <b>cemetery</b> itself and development within <b>the</b> <b>cemetery</b> was prohibited, the LNC had little apparent value. However, Maximilian Investments secured {{passage of the}} Brookwood Cemetery Act 1975, authorising them to sell land within the operational area of <b>the</b> <b>cemetery.</b> The former Superintendent's office housing the LNC's offices, near the level crossing where the Necropolis Railway had passed between {{the northern and southern}} cemeteries, was sold for office development. Following the sale the offices of the LNC, renamed Brookwood Cemetery Ltd at this time, were moved into a small former caretaker's lodge. With little storage space in the new makeshift offices, the majority of the LNC's records were destroyed during the move. Tracts of land within <b>the</b> <b>cemetery</b> were sold to various religious groups and to wealthy families for use as private burial grounds, and a tract of unused land south of the Glades of Remembrance was sold to Woking Clay Pigeon Club. The masonry works remained operational until the early 1980s, although not under LNC management after the early 1960s, and were then converted into office buildings and named Stonemason's Court.|$|E

5000|$|The {{sale was}} ordered by Dame Shirley Porter, the Conservative leader of WCC at the time, {{in order to}} save the annual {{maintenance}} costs of £422,000, with the upkeep of <b>the</b> <b>cemeteries</b> passing to <b>the</b> new owner. However, the deal had been handled with such incompetence by WCC that the maintenance agreement only applied to the immediate purchaser of <b>the</b> <b>cemeteries</b> and not to any subsequent owners; <b>the</b> <b>cemeteries</b> were re-sold by the purchaser for £1.25 million {{on the same day that}} he had acquired them. Without maintenance, <b>the</b> <b>cemeteries</b> soon became overgrown, headstones were vandalised, and they were frequented by drug addicts.|$|R
5|$|As the Brookwood {{site had}} been {{intentionally}} chosen for its distance from London, {{at the time}} of its opening the only practical way to reach <b>the</b> <b>cemetery</b> was by railway. William Cubitt decided that the terrain of the initial cemetery site was best suited to a railway branch from the LSWR at the west of <b>the</b> <b>cemetery,</b> and work began on the earthworks and rails for the new branch in early September 1854. The single-track branch was completed in time for the opening two months later. The junction with the LSWR, known as Necropolis Junction, was west-facing, meaning that trains to and from London were obliged to reverse in and out of the branch to the two stations in <b>the</b> <b>cemetery.</b> The poor quality gravel soil, which had been the initial reason for the site's cheapness and its selection as the site for <b>the</b> <b>cemetery,</b> was poorly suited as a railway trackbed. The rails, and in particular the sleepers, deteriorated rapidly and needed constantly to be replaced.|$|E
5|$|In 1864 Brookwood (Necropolis) {{railway station}} on the LSWR opened, {{immediately}} east of Necropolis Junction. In conjunction with {{the building of the}} station a run-around loop was added at Necropolis Junction, allowing locomotives to reposition themselves from the front {{to the rear of the}} train. From then on, on arrival at Necropolis Junction from London the engine would not be repositioned, but would push the train into <b>the</b> <b>cemetery</b> from the rear, under the close supervision of LNC staff. This left the engine positioned to pull the train out of <b>the</b> <b>cemetery,</b> after which it would use the run-around loop to move to the other end of the train and pull it back to London. Between 1898 and 1904 the LSWR line through Brookwood was increased from two to four tracks; a thin slice of the northernmost part of <b>the</b> <b>cemetery</b> was ceded to the LSWR to allow the widening of the line. Brookwood station was rebuilt, and a new junction to the west of the station allowed trains to pass between <b>the</b> <b>cemetery</b> branch and all four of the LSWR lines.|$|E
5|$|In 1877 during {{construction}} of the Durley Hill Cemetery, {{the remains of a}} grand Roman villa with over 30 rooms was discovered. However, construction of <b>the</b> <b>cemetery</b> went ahead, and the majority of the villa is now located beneath the Victorian cemetery and an adjacent road. <b>The</b> <b>cemetery</b> was expanded in 1922, and an archeological dig was carried out ahead of the interments, leading to the excavation of 17 rooms and the rescue of 10 elaborate mosaics.|$|E

5000|$|Individuals with {{a strong}} {{interest}} in preserving <b>the</b> Ohlsdorf <b>cemetery</b> formed <b>the</b> [...] (Society for the Promotion of <b>the</b> Ohlsdorf <b>Cemetery),</b> and opened <b>the</b> [...] (Museum of <b>the</b> Ohlsdorf <b>Cemetery).</b> <b>The</b> museum is dedicated to raising public interest for <b>the</b> Ohlsdorf <b>cemetery,</b> and for promoting historical and contemporary funeral culture. The collection in the museum, on display since 1996, focuses mainly on the history of Hamburg's <b>cemetery</b> culture. Since <b>the</b> Ohlsdorfer <b>cemetery</b> was opened in 1877 as the first American-style park cemetery in Germany, it is of significant importance to <b>the</b> European <b>cemetery</b> culture. <b>The</b> museum has old maps and tools, as well as urns and some of <b>the</b> <b>cemetery's</b> oldest tombstones.|$|R

5|$|In March 1985 {{the company}} was bought by Ramadan Güney, whose family owned <b>the</b> <b>cemetery</b> until it was {{purchased}} by Woking Borough Council in December 2014. The Guney family embarked on a programme of building links with London's mosques to encourage new burials in <b>the</b> <b>cemetery.</b> Guney began a slow programme of clearing the overgrown sections of <b>the</b> <b>cemetery</b> and restoring significant memorials. The Guney family's efforts to attract new custom have been successful, {{to the extent that}} some of the lands sold off in the 1970s have now been repurchased by <b>the</b> <b>cemetery.</b> In June 1989 <b>the</b> <b>cemetery</b> was designated a Conservation Area, and was subsequently declared a Site of Special Scientific Interest. In 1992 the Brookwood Cemetery Society was formed to improve awareness of the cemetery; the Society holds open days, guided walks and other events, restores damaged memorials, and maintains and improves the signage within the cemetery.It is with these intentions that Woking Borough Council agreed at a Special Council Meeting on 24 November 2014 that it should secure <b>the</b> <b>Cemetery</b> by establishing Woking Necropolis and Mausoleum Limited, as a subsidiary within its Thameswey Group of companies.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the graves, several buildings stood within <b>the</b> <b>cemetery.</b> A larger rectangular structure with an east-west alignment, identified from postholes left in the ground, stood on the east side. It has been interpreted as a chapel or shrine. A smaller grubenhaus – a type of sunken building – which {{is thought to have}} been used as a mortuary chapel was located close by in the central area of <b>the</b> <b>cemetery.</b> An Iron Age roundhouse had also once been located within the north-west quadrant but was no longer standing at the time <b>the</b> <b>cemetery</b> was laid out. All of these buildings would have stood on the crest of a ridge, and would have been especially prominent to travelers arriving from the south.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> {{original}} <b>cemetery</b> {{was created}} in 1917. Between 1956-1958, there were 128 small German military cemeteries scattered across Flanders consolidated to four.

5|$|In the Summer of 1999, a {{group of}} volunteers worked to restore and clean up <b>the</b> <b>cemetery</b> {{that led to a}} {{ceremony}} in October 1999 with more than 60 people in attendance.
