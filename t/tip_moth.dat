40|$|Abstract [...] Pheromone traps {{are used}} to monitor flight {{activity}} of male Nantucket pine <b>tip</b> <b>moths,</b> Rhyacionia frustrana (Comstock), to initialize spray timing models, determine activity periods, or detect population trends. However, a standard-ized trapping procedure has not been developed. The relative efficacies of six types of lures and eight commercial phero-mone traps were compared in field tests in Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, and Virginia. Additional factors, including trap color, lure longevity and loading rates and ratios were also tested. These tests demonstrate that lures and 1 or traps have a pronounced effect on male moth catches. The Pherocon 1 Cwing trap was the most effective. White traps were slightly better than colored traps. Pherocon 1 C @ wing traps baited with commercial Scent@, EcogenQ or Tr 6 ckQ lures caught the greatest numbers of moths...|$|R

50|$|Timber is {{currently}} also harvested in New Guinea. Although {{it is not}} generally a viable plantation species, trees are regularly harvested by Forestry in the Atherton region of Queensland. It grows best in an environment with high light levels, however in the relative darkness of the rainforest understorey, it is less susceptible to attack by the cedar <b>tip</b> <b>moth.</b> The cedar <b>tip</b> <b>moth</b> lays its eggs on the tree's leading shoot, allowing the larvae to burrow into the stem. This causes dieback and a multi-branched tree with little commercial value. The tree exudes a chemical that the female cedar <b>tip</b> <b>moth</b> seeks out. This moth does not attack commercial plantings of Asian/African/Australian native meliaceas in South America. As a result, successful planting of Toona ciliata is being observed {{in many parts of}} Brazil, including genetic improvement and clonal production.|$|E
40|$|Proceedings of the 1997 Georgia Water Resources Conference, March 20 - 22, 1997, Athens, Georgia. Imidacloprid {{has been}} shown to control pine <b>tip</b> <b>moths</b> (Rhyacionia spp.) in loblolly pine {{seedlings}} (Pinus taeda L.). We describe an imidacloprid dissipation study on a small watershed near Downs, Georgia. Field data are utilized to calibrate the computer model VS 2 DT (Variably Saturated 2 - Dimensional Transport) that uses a fmite-difference approximation of the advection-dispersion equation to simulate contaminant transport through variably saturated porous media. The site is simulated in a vertical cross section (X-Z plane) of a treated watershed from the soil surface to the water table (approximately 60 ft) spanning 260 ft horizontally. The cross section is centered on an ephemeral stream which drains the watershed, but for symmetry reasons, only half (130 ft horizontal distance) of the cross section is modeled. Modeling results show that imidacloprid moves more rapidly through sandy soils than sandy clay loam soil material. No imidacloprid concentrations above the detection limit of 0. 6 ppb are predicted for the lysimeters in the unsaturated zone or in groundwater. Sponsored and Organized by: U. S.

5|$|The {{reproductive}} {{stage of}} the insect is the winged adult or imago. The surface of both butterflies and moths is covered by scales, {{each of which is}} an outgrowth from a single epidermal cell. The head is small and dominated by the two large compound eyes. These are capable of distinguishing flower shapes or motion but not for clearly viewing distant objects. Colour perception is good, especially in some species in the blue/violet range. The antennae are composed of many segments and have clubbed <b>tips</b> (unlike <b>moths</b> that have tapering or feathery antennae). The sensory receptors are concentrated in the tips and can detect odours. Taste receptors are located on the palps and on the feet. The mouthparts are designed for sucking and the mandibles are usually reduced in size or absent. The first maxillae are elongated into a tubular proboscis which is curled up at rest and expanded when needed to feed. The first and second maxillae bear palps which function as sensory organs. Some species have a reduced proboscis or maxillary palps and do not feed as adults.|$|R
50|$|Waldridge Fell is a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), {{as it is}} one of {{the last}} {{remaining}} areas of lowland fell (heathland less than 300m above sea level), in the county, with a raised valley floor peat bog. Wanister Bog is the most significant area of wetland and contains plants such as marsh marigold, bogbean, sedges and bog moss. There is extensive evidence of coal mining with subsidence and other features related to the colliery and pits. Typical heathland vegetation and wildlife are present consisting of heather, bracken, gorse, rabbit, game birds, blackberry, bilberry and raspberry.Waldridge Fell has had many uses over the years;grazing,part of the Prince Bishops' hunting chase and even a military training ground during the Napoleonic Wars. Extensive coal mining took place from the early 1800s until 1963. Waldridge colliery and village community thrivedhere. The present car parks are named after the rows of houses that once stood here. There are panoramic views across the Fell and surrounding countryside. A number of way-marked routes around the site enable access to different parts of the Fell. Guided walks oftentake place around this fascinating site. Coppicing of birch trees takes place on a rotational basis to prevent the Fell from returningto woodland, and the rare heathland habitat would be lost. The heather itself is cut on rotation. This encourages new growth and creates stands of different aged heather which benefits a broader range of animals. The Country Park is home to a number of interesting insects and plants, some of which are scarce in this county, such as the green hairstreak butterfly and emperor moth. The very rare red <b>tipped</b> clearwing <b>moth</b> has been recorded here. Pairs of breeding stonechat may be seen, often perching on a gorse bush.|$|R

5000|$|As a timber, both Swietenia macrophylla and Swietenia mahogoni {{are both}} grown in {{plantations}} in several Asian {{countries such as}} Fiji, Indonesia, India, and Bangladesh and this plantation mahogany timber is {{the main source of}} the world's current supply of [...] "genuine mahogany", due to cultivation and trade of it in its native locations being restricted by the Convention On International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna CITES since the late 1990s. Trade in Swietenia grown and harvested in these non-native locations is not restricted. Species of this genus are only occasionally plantation-grown in Central America, in spite of the good growing conditions and high price of the wood, due to the ubiquitous presence of the mahogany shoot borer moth (also known as the cedar <b>tip</b> <b>moth),</b> Hypsipyla grandella, which damages the form of the tree by killing the terminal shoot, causing excessive branching. Control requires extensive and frequent spraying with pesticides, rendering the genus relatively uneconomic wherever the shoot borer is present.|$|E

40|$|Abstract-Intensive forest {{management}} practices {{have been shown}} to increase tree growth and shorten rotation time.

The Nantucket pine <b>tip</b> <b>moth</b> (Rhyacionia frustrana [Comstock]) is one insect that is expected to become more important with more intensive {{forest management}} practices. Two studies were developed to investigate these relationships. Treatments included various combinations of herbicide applications, irrigation, fertilization, and insecticide applications. These studies demonstrated that <b>tip</b> <b>moth</b> management improves tree growth. <b>Tip</b> <b>moth</b> damage increased due to weed control, but not due to N fertilization.

40|$|Abstract-Pheromone traps baited with {{synthetic}} baits {{are used}} in southeastern pine plantations to monitor the phenology of the Nantucket pine <b>tip</b> <b>moth</b> (Rhyacionia frustrana (Comstock)) for timing of insecticide applications. Trap catches of tip moths {{have been difficult to}} interpret because they decrease considerably relative to population density from the spring through subsequent generations. Understanding this pattern is important for optimizing trap usage and catch interpretation. Decreased adult longevity during summer was demonstrated and suggested as the primary reason for low catches in hot weather. In addition, methods were developed to utilize pheromone traps for predicting future population density and damage by this pest. Trap catch was strongly correlated with <b>tip</b> <b>moth</b> density and damage within generations. Additionally, trap catch of overwintering moths was a strong predictor of <b>tip</b> <b>moth</b> damage during the subsequent generation...|$|E

Trees received intensive weed control and one of the following treatments; irrigation only. fertilization only, irrigation + fertilization, or control. Mean whole-tree <b>tip</b> <b>moth</b> damage levels ranged from < 1 to 48 % during this study.
