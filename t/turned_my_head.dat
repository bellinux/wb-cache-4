2500|$|The {{following}} {{is an example of}} this type of experience: ‘My husband died in June 1945, and 26 years afterwards when I was at Church, I felt him standing beside me during the singing of a hymn. I felt I would see him if I <b>turned</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> The feeling was so strong I was reduced to tears. I had not been thinking of him before I felt his presence. I had not had this feeling before that day, neither has it happened since then.’ ...|$|E
2500|$|Some {{artists have}} had hits with songs that Twitty {{recorded}} but never released as singles. Among {{these are the}} Oak Ridge Boys' top-five hit, [...] "I Wish You Could Have <b>Turned</b> <b>My</b> <b>Head</b> (And Left My Heart Alone)", originally from Twitty's 1979 album Crosswinds; the Statler Brothers's [...] "You'll Be Back (Every Night in My Dreams)", from Twitty's 1980 album Rest Your Love On Me; Steve Wariner's [...] "I'm Already Taken" [...] (which Wariner wrote), from Twitty's 1981 album Mr. T; Lee Greenwood's [...] "It Turns Me Inside Out", from Twitty's 1982 album Southern Comfort; John Conlee's [...] "In My Eyes", from Twitty's 1982 album Dream Maker; John Schneider's [...] "What's a Memory Like You (Doin' in a Love Like This?)", from Twitty's 1985 album Chasin' Rainbows; and Daryle Singletary's [...] "The Note" [...] and Ricky Van Shelton's [...] "Somebody Lied", from Twitty's 1985 album Don't Call Him a Cowboy.|$|E
2500|$|Wallis was keen to {{join the}} RAF, and applied for their Volunteer Reserve Service, but he was turned down due to a {{defective}} right eye. Consequently, he obtained a private flying licence which required only a certificate signed by his GP. Wallis obtained his A Licence for dual and solo flying in a record 12 hours. In 1938, Wallis tried {{to join the}} RAF again, {{this time with the}} newly formed RAF Short Service Commission Scheme, but again failed the eye test. In 1939, he was called up to RAF Uxbridge, and again was sent for a medical. When it came to the eyesight test he managed to pass, as Wallis later recalled, [...] "I did the first line with my good eye then they covered it up and asked me to read the bottom line with my bad eye, without them realising I just <b>turned</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> slightly so I could again see with my good eye – I passed it with Above Average Eye Sight!" ...|$|E
60|$|I <b>turn</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> and see it, in its {{beautiful}} serenity, beside me.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Now {{get on my}} back,' he said to Paul, 'and when I <b>turn</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> to the right, cut a slice off the bullock {{that hangs}} on that side, {{and put it in}} my mouth, and when I <b>turn</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> to the left, draw a cupful of wine from the cask that hangs on that side, and pour it down my throat.' ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Stay in Time" [...] (flip side Full Moon <b>Turn</b> <b>my</b> <b>Head</b> Around) (1979), U.S. No. 51 ...|$|R
60|$|I <b>turned</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> at {{the sound}} of a {{footstep}} upon the gravel path. The doctor was standing beside me.|$|E
60|$|I <b>turned</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> It was the Recording Angel. He had a weary look; I judged {{him to be}} tired.|$|E
6000|$|I <b>turned</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> Christian George King again, and treachery again! Sea- {{water had}} been {{conveyed}} into the magazine, and every grain of powder was spoiled! ...|$|E
60|$|I did not {{immediately}} <b>turn</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> but every nerve in my body seemed to stiffen into quivering curiosity.|$|R
60|$|In lazy wonder, I <b>turn</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> on the pillow, {{and look}} {{on the other side}} of my bed.|$|R
60|$|I {{knew who}} it was at once. It was the most hideous ill-fortune. I {{answered}} gruffly, and without <b>turning</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'Don't look at him!' said my aunt, as I <b>turned</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> indignantly, 'but {{get me a}} coach, my dear, {{and wait}} for me in St. Paul's Churchyard.' ...|$|E
60|$|I {{felt the}} blood rush {{into my face}} for the first time, {{but it was only}} an {{instantaneous}} emotion. I <b>turned</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> aside, and it was gone.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh no; {{only they}} won't do {{for such an}} absurd person as I am. The last <b>turned</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> for a week, and I am much too {{unsteady}} for this.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... “No need,” I growled, without <b>turning</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> “I {{can find}} my {{hat in the}} hall by myself, after I’ve {{finished}} picking up [...] . ” ...|$|R
6000|$|ERMYNTRUDE. You know, if I had a {{moustache}} like that, {{it would}} <b>turn</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> I should go mad. Are you quite sure the Inca isn't mad? ...|$|R
60|$|The grave {{face of a}} not too {{recently}} washed angel peeps shyly at {{me through}} the railings, then, as I <b>turn</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> darts back and disappears.|$|R
60|$|I sharply <b>turned</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> away, {{partly because}} his {{presence}} utterly displeased me, {{and partly because}} I wished to shun questions: lest, in my present mood, the effort of answering should overmaster self-command.|$|E
60|$|By {{this time}} the {{sunlight}} was pouring its cold rays, for here they were cold, straight {{into the mouth of}} the cave. Suddenly I heard an exclamation of fear from someone, and <b>turned</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b>|$|E
60|$|Then {{suddenly}} her flow {{of language}} ceased--the bomb-shell fell! Mrs. Bundercombe's face became unlike anything I {{have ever seen}} or dreamed of. Even Eve's eyes were round and her expression dubious. I <b>turned</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b>|$|E
60|$|Happening to <b>turn</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> at that moment, I {{found my}} dear mother's eyes turned curiously on me; brought there, I fancy, by the allusion to Tom's sister.|$|R
6000|$|... "John Adams, {{whatever}} <b>turn</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> {{may have}} got, I shall {{have reason to}} thank God for it all the days of my life--ay, and afterwards throughout eternity." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Kari," [...] I said, without <b>turning</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> [...] "what {{are they}} going to do with us? Set us in yonder temple to be worshipped with nothing to eat?" ...|$|R
60|$|But behind me, {{coming from}} the village, I {{heard the sound of}} light and rapid footsteps. I <b>turned</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> It was Blanche Moyat, short-skirted, a stick in her hand, a feather stuck through her Tam-o'-Shanter.|$|E
6000|$|I <b>turned</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> away in {{bitterness}} as I {{thought of}} my own folly. Why had I never happened to walk out this way with fifty thousand dollars in my pocket and buy all this beautiful mud? ...|$|E
60|$|Then, I <b>turned</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> to the Signor Dellombra, and {{saw that}} he was dressed in black, and had a {{reserved}} and secret air, and was a dark, remarkable-looking man, with black hair and a grey moustache.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was just}} then I {{heard a sound}} behind me, and <b>turning</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> I saw Quilla {{stumbling}} towards us down the stony slope as best her half-blind eyes would let her, and crying as she came: ...|$|R
60|$|I {{endeavored}} to <b>turn</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> {{to see if}} our struggle was not noticed {{by some of the}} others. But Lowell kept <b>my</b> eyes <b>turned</b> seaward, and now he caught me about the arms and the waist.|$|R
6000|$|... "Keep close in," [...] I {{directed}} Bradley, {{and then}} I dived {{over the side}} and struck out for the narrow beach. There was another splash directly behind me, and <b>turning</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> I saw faithful old Nobs swimming valiantly in my wake.|$|R
60|$|I <b>turned</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> {{and looked}} at him without answering; for, to my thinking, his sudden {{appearance}} (or rather, I should say, his unexpected approach) had, amidst the gathering shadows and lingering light, something in it which was wild and ominous.|$|E
6000|$|And never I <b>turned</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> alack, [...] While {{these things}} met my gaze [...] Through the pane's drop-drenched glaze, To see the more {{behind my back}} [...] . O never I turned, but let, alack, [...] These less things hold my gaze! ...|$|E
6000|$|There was {{a beggar}} in the street, when I went down; and as I <b>turned</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> towards the window, {{thinking}} of her calm seraphic eyes, he made me start by muttering, {{as if he were}} an echo of the morning: 'Blind! Blind! Blind!' ...|$|E
60|$|The {{impact of}} my impudence stopped him short, {{much as a}} bullet might have done. I verily believe he staggered, though as far as I could see he didn't {{actually}} fall. I had gone past in a moment and did not <b>turn</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> I had forgotten his existence.|$|R
60|$|At {{this point}} I thought it well to wake up. <b>Turning</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> I yawned, {{opened my eyes}} and looked at her vaguely, seeing which her {{expression}} changed in a flash from that of brooding power to one of moved and anxious girlhood; in short, it became most sweetly feminine.|$|R
60|$|The scream did {{not proceed}} from the girl. It was emitted behind me, and {{caused me to}} <b>turn</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> sharply. I {{understood}} at once that the apparition in the doorway was the elderly relation of Jacobus, the companion, the gouvernante. While she remained thunderstruck, I got up and made her a low bow.|$|R
