5|$|Excavations at {{the quarry}} were stopped in 1881, {{although}} it was not exhausted of fossils, as recent drilling operations have shown. During World War I, when the town was occupied by German forces, preparations were made <b>to</b> <b>reopen</b> the mine for palaeontology, and Otto Jaekel was sent from Berlin to supervise. The Allies recaptured Bernissart just as the first fossiliferous layer was about to be uncovered. Further attempts <b>to</b> <b>reopen</b> the mine were hindered by financial problems and were stopped altogether in 1921 when the mine flooded.|$|E

5|$|Thunder Run {{operated}} {{until the}} end of the 2009 season on November 1. Amid a corporate bankruptcy, on February 4, 2010, Six Flags announced the park would cease operations immediately due to the rejection of an amended lease by the Kentucky State Fair Board. Many attempts were made <b>to</b> <b>reopen</b> the park under new operators. Eventually, on June 27, 2013, a group of investors led by Ed Hart negotiated an agreement <b>to</b> <b>reopen</b> the park. The group would spend $36 million <b>to</b> <b>reopen</b> the park in May 2014. Thunder Run would be part of the opening day lineup of attractions. Rocky Mountain Construction was hired to refurbish the ride, resulting in the existing wooden track to be replaced. On October 10, 2013, Kentucky Kingdom invited members of the media and amusement industry to ride the refurbished Thunder Run. The ride reopened to the public on May 24, 2014. After the 2016 season, Kentucky Kingdom announced that Thunder Run would get new trains from the Philadelphia Toboggan Company for the 2017 season. These trains would replace the ones first put into service in 1990.|$|E

5|$|The legendary saga Yngvars saga víðförla {{describes}} the last expedition of the Vikings into the Caspian, dated to 1041 and possibly {{connected with the}} Georgian-Byzantine Battle of Sasireti in which a Varangian force participated around the same time; in the saga much legend is conflated with the historical facts. This expedition was launched from Sweden by Ingvar the Far-Travelled, who went down the Volga into {{the land of the}} Saracens (Serkland in Norse). There are no less than twenty-six Ingvar Runestones, twenty-three of them being in the Lake Mälaren region of Uppland in Sweden, referring to Swedish warriors who went out with Ingvar on his expedition to the Saracen lands, an expedition whose purpose was probably <b>to</b> <b>reopen</b> old trade routes, now that the Bulgars and the Khazars no longer proved obstacles. A stone to Ingvar's brother indicates that he went east for gold but that he died in the Saracen land. Afterwards, no attempts were made by the Norsemen <b>to</b> <b>reopen</b> the route between the Baltic and Caspian seas.|$|E

5|$|A lull ensued, {{during which}} November talks {{sponsored}} by the OAU failed to conciliate the opposing Chadian factions. Ethiopian leader Mengistu's attempt {{at the beginning of}} 1984 was also unsuccessful. Mengistu's failure was followed on 24 January by a GUNT attack, supported by heavy Libyan armor, on the FANT outpost of Ziguey, a move mainly meant to persuade France and the African states <b>to</b> <b>reopen</b> negotiations. France reacted to this breach of the Red Line by launching the first significant air counter-attack, bringing new troops into Chad and unilaterally raising the defensive line to the 16th parallel.|$|E
5|$|After Jones makes another {{unsuccessful}} {{attempt to}} open a doorway at a soccer field in Providence, Olivia searches through old case files related to science and unexplained phenomena, and discovers a geographic connection between the soccer field, the city street, and several of their past Fringe cases.

Olivia, Peter, and Walter intercept Jones while he is opening another window and is halfway through it. Peter triggers Walter's device, killing Jones by sealing the doorway.|$|E
5|$|Although the Navy was {{satisfied}} with the investigation and its results, others were unconvinced, and in October 1991, amid increasing criticism, Congress forced the Navy <b>to</b> <b>reopen</b> the investigation.
