The 1851 completion of the Erie Railroad in New York prompted Fillmore and his cabinet to ride the first train from New York City to the shores of Lake Erie, in company with many other politicians and dignitaries. Fillmore made many speeches along <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> train's rear platform, urging acceptance of the Compromise, and afterwards went {{on a tour of}} New England with his Southern cabinet members.

5|$|Comanche War Chief Buffalo Hump was {{determined}} {{to do more than}} merely complain about what the Comanches viewed as a bitter betrayal. Spreading word to the other bands of Comanches that he was raiding the white settlements in revenge, Buffalo Hump led the Great Raid of 1840.. University of Oklahoma Press. 1952. Buffalo Hump gathered a huge raiding party, at least 400 warriors, with wives and young boys along to provide comfort and do the work. Altogether as many as a thousand Comanche may have set out from West Texas on the Great Raid. On this raid the Comanches went all <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> plains of west Texas to the cities of Victoria and Linnville on the Texas coast. In what may have been the largest organized raid by the Comanches to that point, they raided and burned these towns and plundered at will.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 18th century, the {{establishment}} of Russian naval power in the Baltic challenged the interests of Sweden, at the time {{one of the major}} powers in the Baltic. The Swedish Empire at the time included territory in Northern Germany, all of modern Finland and most of the Baltic states, a dominion held together by the Baltic sea routes. Russian Tsar Peter the Great had established a new capital and naval base in Saint Petersburg in 1703. During the Great Northern War 1700–1721 Sweden lost its Baltic state territories, and experienced destructive Russian raiding in Finland and along the chain of islands and archipelagos that stretched all <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Gulf of Finland to the capital of Stockholm. The traumatic experience led to {{the establishment of}} inshore flotillas of shallow-draft vessels. The first of these consisted mainly of smaller versions of the traditional Mediterranean warship, the galleys. Most of these more akin to galiots and were complemented with gun prams. The disastrous war against Russia 1741-43 and the minor involvement in Prussia in the Pomeranian War 1757–62 showed the need for further expansion and development of the inshore flotillas with more specialized vessels.|$|E

5|$|After {{the fall}} of Constantinople to the Ottoman Empire in 1453, Mehmed {{set his sights on}} other campaigns. In Anatolia, the Greek Empire of Trebizond was still {{resisting}} the Ottomans, and to the East the White Sheep Turkomans of Uzun Hasan, together with other smaller states, threatened the Ottomans. In the West, Skanderbeg in Albania continued to trouble the Sultan, while Bosnia was sometimes reluctant in paying the Jizya (tax on non-Muslims). Wallachia controlled the left bank of the Danube, and Mehmed wanted to have control over the river, as naval attacks could be launched against his empire all <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Holy Roman Empire. On September 26, 1459, Pope Pius II called for a new crusade against the Ottomans and on January 14, 1460, at the Congress of Mantua, the Pope proclaimed the official crusade that was to last for three years. His plan, however, failed and the only European leader that showed enthusiasm for the crusade was Vlad Ţepeş, whom the Pope held in high regard. Because of a lack of enthusiasm shown by Europeans for the crusade, Mehmed took the opportunity to take an offensive stand. Later that same year (1460), he captured the last independent Serbian city, Smederevo, and in 1461, he convinced the Greek despot of Morea to give up his stronghold; soon thereafter, its capital, Mistra, and Corinth followed suit and surrendered themselves without struggle.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{delays in}} the {{officers}} and men arriving from the Albanian front, the first subunits became operational on 12 February. On 16 February, it began its move to the Larissa–Tyrnavos–Trikala area, where it was assembled by 26 February. The division was subordinated to the Central Macedonia Army Section (TSKM) upon its establishment (4 March) {{and moved to the}} area of Katerini, where its units arrived by 10 March. Between 14 and 17 March, the Mechanized Cavalry Regiment, transferred from the Albanian front, was gradually incorporated into the division: its Light Company formed the 19th Reconnaissance Group; its 1st Combat Company, with the 1st and 4th MG troops and the 1st and 4th Mortar Troops, formed the 191st Mechanized Regiment; its 2nd Combat Company, with the 2nd MG troop and the 2nd Mortar Troop, formed the 192nd Mechanized Regiment; and its 3rd Combat Company, with the 3rd MG troop and the 3rd Mortar Troop, formed the 193rd Mechanized Regiment. The Tank Company followed in late March. The tanks had to be driven all <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> front in Albania to the division's new staging area at Kilkis, which resulted in two falling out of action and considerable wear on the rest, especially in view of the almost complete lack of spare parts.|$|E

5|$|In 2009–10, Benfica had an {{noteworthy}} run in {{the newly}} created UEFA Europa League, progressing all <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> play-off round to the quarter-finals. Their campaign featured a 5–0 thrashing of English side Everton in the group stage, and an aggregate 3–2 defeat of Marseille in the round of 16, with an injury-time goal from Alan Kardec. Bringing a 2–1 home advantage from {{the first leg of}} the quarter-finals against Liverpool, Benfica's manager Jorge Jesus made a surprising change for the second leg at Anfield, putting centre-back David Luiz as left-back; the team eventually lost the match 4–1 and were eliminated. In the following season, Benfica returned to the Champions League, but as in 2006–07 and 2007–08, were demoted to the Europa League. This time, however, the team overcame the quarter-final stage to reach their first European semi-final in 17 years. In the first European match ever between Portuguese teams, Benfica were surprised by Braga and missed the chance to qualify to the final. For the 2011–12 season, Benfica strengthened their squad with Axel Witsel and improved their performance in the Champions League, progressing {{all the way to the}} quarter-finals. In the group stage, Benfica topped their group – knocking Manchester United out of European competitions once again – and defeated Zenit Saint Petersbourg in the last 16, before losing 3–1 on aggregate to Chelsea.|$|E
5|$|Light that {{travels through}} {{transparent}} matter does so {{at a lower}} speed than c, {{the speed of light}} in a vacuum. For example, photons engage in so many collisions on <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> core of the sun that radiant energy can take about a million years to reach the surface; however, once in open space, a photon takes only 8.3 minutes to reach Earth. The factor by which the speed is decreased is called the refractive index of the material. In a classical wave picture, the slowing {{can be explained by the}} light inducing electric polarization in the matter, the polarized matter radiating new light, and that new light interfering with the original light wave to form a delayed wave. In a particle picture, the slowing can instead be described as a blending of the photon with quantum excitations of the matter to produce quasi-particles known as polariton (other quasi-particles are phonons and excitons); this polariton has a nonzero effective mass, which means that it cannot travel at c. Light of different frequencies may travel through matter at different speeds; this is called dispersion (not to be confused with scattering). In some cases, it can result in extremely slow speeds of light in matter. The effects of photon interactions with other quasi-particles may be observed directly in Raman scattering and Brillouin scattering.|$|E
