40|$|When transmultiplexers with {{overlapping}} {{frequency bands}} {{are used for}} the transmission of data over non-ideal channels, intersymbol interference and crosstalk between different data channels will arise. This paper addresses the design of optimal linear networks that reduce the effects mentioned above. A receiver structure based {{on a combination of}} crosstalk reduction, memory truncation and Viterbi detection will be proposed. The filter design method presented here is based on the maximization of a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the detector input. The SNR will be defined for channel memories being truncated to arbitrary lengths. Thus, low-complexity Viterbi detectors working independently for all data channels can be used.

A T3 line comprises 28 T1 lines, each operating at total signaling rate of 1.544 Mbit/s.

40|$|A {{time-division}} add-drop multiplexer {{capable of}} high-extinction-ratio operation is presented both theoretically and experimentally. The approach used {{is based on}} time-to-frequency domain conversion of optical signals and relies upon the switching of linearly chirped optical pulses. By converting a 40 -Gb/s optical <b>time-division</b> multiplexing (OTDM) <b>signal</b> to 4 × 10 -Gb/s wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) channels and using fiber Bragg gratings for frequency-domain add-drop multiplexing, a timeslot suppression ratio in excess of 30 dB and error-free operation for the dropped, through, and added channels were achieved. A further stage of WDM-to-TDM signal conversion was used to map the resulting signal back into the time domain. Moreover, it is shown that it is straightforward to simultaneously operate on multiple channels by simply cascading gratings to make more complex filtering functions without the requirement for any further synchronization of the tributary channels...|$|R
40|$|This talk {{reports on}} {{processing}} of high-speed telecommunication signals based on cascaded quadratic nonlinearities in periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN) waveguides. A strong pump positioned within the acceptance bandwidth of the PPLN device can interact via a cascaded nonlinear process {{with a second}} signal, thereby facilitating a switch with a broad optical bandwidth and yielding an output located within the same wavelength band as the inputs. The combination of the PPLN switch with custom-designed optical filtering for pre-conditioning of the signals {{gives rise to a}} versatile pulse processing system exhibiting important advantages in terms of compactness and environmental stability [1, 2]. As an example, Fig. 1 describes schematically how an optical <b>time-division</b> multiplexed (OTDM) <b>signal</b> can be converted through cascaded second-harmonic generation and difference-frequency generation to a wavelength-division multiplexed (WDM) signal.

40|$|Future optical {{communication}} networks {{are likely to}} require a range of advanced OTDM channel processing functions if the full potential of the fibre transmission bandwidth is to be exploited. Critical processing functions include amongst others <b>time-division</b> demultiplexing, <b>signal</b> regeneration, channel add/drop, signal format conversion and packet compression. Ideally, these processes will be performed directly in the optical domain since this removes any bandwidth constraints {{associated with the use}} of electrical signals. In this presentation we describe various optical processing systems that exploit time-to-wavelength signal conversion. All of our systems are based on the nonlinear optical sampling of a linearly chirped pulse that is shaped and synchronised to temporally overlap with a given number of (relatively high-power) OTDM tributary channels in a fibre based switch. The individual tributary OTDM channels are mapped directly onto distinct WDM channels at the switch output by the nonlinear sampling process. Further processing of the OTDM channels can then be performed simply by passive filtering of the resulting WDM channels. If required, the filtered WDM signal can then be mapped back into the time domain onto an OTDM signal in a second nonlinear fibre switch. To highlight the power of the approach we shall present experimental demonstrations of simultaneous demultiplexing of each of the constituent tributary channels of an OTDM signal, tributary channel aggregation into compressed packets, and 10 Gbit/s multi-channel add/drop from a 40 Gbit/s TDM signal...|$|R

They were replaced in 1979 by a system in which a Driving Brake Standard Open (DBSO), converted from a Mark 2, could control the Class 47/7 locomotive via computerised <b>time-division</b> multiplex (TDM) <b>signalling</b> through the train lighting circuits. This had the added benefit that intermediate carriages needed no special equipment, and was found more satisfactory. Such trains became widely used on the intensive passenger service between Edinburgh Waverley and Glasgow Queen Street. When the push-pull sets were replaced by multiple units, the DBSOs were transferred to the Liverpool Street to Norwich service, where they were modified to work with Class 86 electric locomotives.|$|R
50|$|Transmuxing (Transmux: Transcode Multiplexing) is a {{telecommunications}} signaling format change between two signaling methods, typically {{synchronous optical network}} signals, SONET, and various <b>time-division</b> multiplexing, TDM, <b>signals.</b> Transmuxing changes the “container” without changing the “contents.” Transmuxing provides the carrier the capability to embed {{a telecommunications}} signal from one logical TDM circuit to another within SONET without physically breaking down the TDM circuit into its components and reconstructing it. There {{are two types of}} Transmuxing - Electrical Transmuxing and Optical Transmuxing (sometimes called portless transmuxing). In Electrical Transmuxing, TDM signals (typically DS1/T1 or DS3) are brought in using copper connections, transmuxed to SONET and transported across the network until the reverse occurs. In Optical Transmuxing, TDM signals (DS1/T1, DS3, OCx) are brought in using fiber optics, transmuxed to SONET and transported across the network until the reverse occurs. In the U.S. and Japan, DS1/T1 signals are transmuxed into a SONET virtual tributary called a VT1.5.|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, the {{possibility}} of processing optical <b>time-division</b> multiplexing (OTDM) <b>signals</b> in both the temporal and spectral domains is investigated. The technique relies on the conversion of high-speed OTDM signals into a mixed time and wavelength division multiplexing (TDM-WDM) format. Depending on the specific network function, it may be advantageous to process the signal in one {{rather than the other}} domain. For example, channel add/drop multiplexing can be performed directly by passive filtering in the spectral domain. An investigation into the switching of the linearly-chirped pulses in a nonlinear optical loop mirror (NOLM) revealed that the product of the control-pulse duration and the chirprate of the linearly-chirped pulse should be above a minimum value to ensure a one-to-one relation between the temporal and spectral waveforms after the switching. Below this minimum value, severe spectral distortion of the mixed TDM-WDM signal was observed. The physics behind this distortion is unveiled and shown {{to be related to the}} interference between the spectral content in the switched pulse and the unavoidable residual components of the linearly-chirped pulse transmitted through the NOLM switch. These effects were identified in experiments which aimed at compressing/expanding waveforms at 40 Gb/s by control of the group delay of the converted TDM-WDM signal in a dispersive medium. Apart from the packet compression/expansion experiments, demultiplexing and channel add/drop multiplexing of 40 -Gb/s OTDM signals were also experimentally demonstrated. The technological challenges of implementing this technique at higher repetition rates are discussed. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|This work {{describes}} the set-up, the characteristics and the experimental tests of an optical clock recovery for optical <b>time-division</b> multiplexed (OTDM) <b>signals</b> at a data-rate of 160 Gbit/s. The clock recovery {{was developed for}} the use in a receiver of fiber-based optical 160 -Gbit/s transmission systems. The clock recovery generates a clock signal that is synchronized to a data stream at the receiver solely with use of the data stream itself. As common receivers cannot process a 160 GHz clock signal, the recovered clock signal is an electrical high frequency signal at a subharmonic frequency of 10 GHz. For this clock recovery a novel phase-comparator with optical differential signal processing was developed and used in a linear phase locked loop (PLL). In this work, {{the development of this}} new phase-comparator and its components is described. Its operation characteristics were experimentally analyzed and theoretically specified. An integration in the theory of a linear PLL was performed. The theory provided a description of the operation of the clock recovery during the appearance of a phase-jump as well as a description of the stability and the timing jitter of the recovered clock signal in dependence of the optical input power. The calculations were in good agreement with experimental results, that were obtained when a 40 -GHz signal without data modulation was input in the clock recovery. The clock recovery described in this work was successfully applied to several OTDM transmission experiments at a data rate of 160 Gbit/s. The experiments showed that its operation is very insensitive to many signal distortions and provides a high long-term stability. Furthermore it was possible to apply the clock recovery also successfully to a 320 Gbit/s transmission experiment, however with noticeably lower roughness as compared to the roughness at 160 Gbit/s. Likewise the clock recovery was successfully applied to an optical sampling system for 320 Gbit/s. Printed version available from Verlag Dr. Hut: [[URL]...|$|R
