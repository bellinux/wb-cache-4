5|$|In August 2013, Vice-Admiral Shekhar Sinha, {{chief of}} the Western Naval Command, said the Ministry of Defence would scrap the ship as she had become very {{difficult}} to maintain and no private bidders had offered to fund the museum's operations. On 3 December 2013, the Indian government decided <b>to</b> <b>auction</b> the ship. The Bombay High Court dismissed a public-interest lawsuit filed by Kiran Paigankar to stop the auction, stating the vessel's dilapidated condition did not warrant her preservation, nor were the necessary funds or government support available.|$|E

5|$|Louis XVIII {{encouraged}} {{his niece}} {{to write her}} memoirs, as he wished them {{to be used as}} Bourbon propaganda. In 1796 and 1803, Louis also used the diaries of Louis XVI's final attendants in the same way. In January 1801, Tsar Paul told Louis XVIII that he could no longer live in Russia. The court at Jelgava was so low on funds that it had <b>to</b> <b>auction</b> some of its possessions to afford the journey out of Russia. Marie-Thérèse even sold a diamond necklace that the Emperor Paul had given her as a wedding gift.|$|E

5|$|Thomas Hall {{crossed his}} Drovers Dogs with dingoes he had tamed, and by 1840 was {{satisfied}} with his resulting progeny. During the next thirty years, the Halls Heelers, as they became known, were used only by the Halls. Given that they were dependent on the dogs, which gave them an advantage over other cattle breeders, {{it is understandable that}} the dogs were not distributed beyond the Hall's properties. It was not until after Thomas Hall's death in 1870, when the properties went <b>to</b> <b>auction</b> with the stock on them, that Halls Heelers became freely available.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{the return}} of the ship on which Mälzel died, his various machines, {{including}} the Turk, fell into the hands of a friend of Mälzel's, the businessman John Ohl. He attempted <b>to</b> <b>auction</b> off the Turk, but owing to low bidding ultimately bought it himself for $400. Only when John Kearsley Mitchell from Philadelphia, Edgar Allan Poe's personal physician and an admirer of the Turk, approached Ohl did the Turk change hands again. Mitchell formed a restoration club and went about the business of repairing the Turk for public appearances, completing the restoration in 1840.|$|E

Blofeld admits that he intends <b>to</b> <b>auction</b> it to the highest bidder. Bond escapes and frees the captive Whyte and they establish that Blofeld is using an offshore oil rig as his base.

5|$|In 1999, 25 {{years after}} the end of their relationship, Joyce Maynard {{auctioned}} a series of letters Salinger had written her. Maynard's memoir of her life and her relationship with Salinger, At Home in the World: A Memoir, was published the same year. Among other topics, the book described how Maynard's mother had consulted with her on how to appeal to the aging author (who was dressing like a child), and described Joyce's relationship with him at length. In the ensuing controversy over both the memoir and the letters, Maynard claimed that she was forced <b>to</b> <b>auction</b> the letters for financial reasons; she would have preferred to donate them to the Beinecke Library. Software developer Peter Norton bought the letters for US$156,500 and announced his intention to return them to Salinger.|$|E

40|$|In {{my thesis}} I explore {{how to best}} award {{spectrum}} licenses to mobile network operators. During {{the last twenty years}} governments have shifted their preferred method of awarding spectrum from comparative awards <b>to</b> <b>auctions.</b> The praised VCG mechanism does not apply well <b>to</b> <b>auctioning</b> spectrum and instead simultaneous multiple round auction, clock auction, and combinatorial clock auction models are used. These models have flaws causing bidders to lack an unambiguous dominant strategy and practice demand reduction. Each spectrum auction is different and there exists no one-size-fits-all solution. Thus, the auction design process carries tremendous weight when attempting to organize a successful spectrum award...|$|R
5|$|The {{first show}} of Tears of a Clown started four hours late, with the delay being caused by Madonna rehearsing. It {{consisted}} of Madonna singing acoustic versions of her songs while {{dressed as a}} clown, interspersed with the singer telling jokes and anecdotes. Tears of a Clown received positive reviews from critics who appreciated the stripped down, confessional nature of the singer's performance and {{the choice of the}} songs and the comedy. Madonna refuted reports of her being drunk on stage, calling them false and sexist. She revived the show on December 2, 2016, performing at Miami's Faena Forum as a benefit gala, <b>to</b> <b>auction</b> memorabilia and raise money for her Raising Malawi charitable foundation. Tickets were expensive, and the auctioned items included Madonna's tour dress and wedding photographs, as well as paintings that she owned.|$|E

Benjamin would visit them annually. While a senator, in the late 1850s he persuaded Natalie to rejoin him and expensively furnished a home in Washington for all three to live in. Natalie and their daughter soon embarked again for France. Benjamin, publicly humiliated by his failure to keep Natalie, consigned the household goods <b>to</b> <b>auction.</b> There were rumors, never substantiated, both that Benjamin was impotent, and that Natalie was unfaithful.|$|E

Charles died in 1908 but his wife Florence stayed until 1925. On Florence's death in 1927 the castle was sold to Sir Arthur Wheeler, who promptly decided <b>to</b> <b>auction</b> off the remaining contents {{with the intent of}} demolishing the property.

5|$|As one of {{the most}} ambitious and {{expensive}} projects in the history of maritime archaeology, the Mary Rose project broke new ground within this field in the UK. Besides becoming {{one of the}} first wrecks to be protected under the new Protection of Wrecks Act in 1973 it also created several new precedents. It {{was the first time that}} a British privately funded project was able to apply modern scientific standards fully and without having <b>to</b> <b>auction</b> off part of the findings to finance its activities; where previous projects often had to settle for just a partial recovery of finds, everything found in connection with the Mary Rose was recovered and recorded. The raising of the vessel made it possible to establish the first historic shipwreck museum in the UK to receive government accreditation and funding. The excavation of the Mary Rose wreck site proved that it was possible to achieve a level of exactness in underwater excavations comparable to those on dry land.|$|E
5|$|Last Light {{title was}} first leaked as Metro 2034, a name used by 4A Games internally. THQ officially {{revealed}} the actual title in May 2012. In November 2012, THQ {{announced that it}} had delayed the game's release until March 2013 {{in order to give}} the development team more time to polish the game further. In December 2012, the game's original publisher, THQ, entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Metro: Last Light, along with other THQ properties and studios, went <b>to</b> <b>auction</b> on 22 January 2013. GameStop temporarily removed the game from its store to prevent customers from being misled by the game's uncertain release, The auction did not affect the progress of the game's development significantly. Clearlake and Koch Media, the latter of which was originally set to distribute the title in Italy and Spain, participated in the auction. Koch Media eventually acquired the rights to the Metro franchise for $5.9 million. Koch was interested in the title as the game was already playable at the time and they were familiar with the development team, whose members worked on , a game published by Koch Media's label Deep Silver. After the auction, Deep Silver announced that the title would be released on 14 May 2013 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360. It was released for OS X on 10 September 2013, Linux on 5 November 2013, and the title was bundled with Valve Corporation's prototype of Steam Machine.|$|E
