5000|$|The first sulphur thermal spa {{treatments}} {{took place}} in 1813 but especially since 1848 {{under the tutelage of}} Dr. Bernard Niepce, the inspector of waters. The baths were operated originally by Pierre Villiot and the Bouvret-Rocour family and associates then from 1882 by the Compagnie Générale des Eaux minérales et Bains de Mer until it was redeemed in 1997 by the municipality and operated by SAEM Thermal. The operation runs today in a beautiful forested park surrounded by three <b>thermal</b> <b>establishments</b> with typical architecture from the 1890s until 1995. The Niepce building (1894) houses the [...] "breathing" [...] activities, the Villiot building (1992) receives patients with rheumatology; the Chardon building (1955) does not currently have thermal use.|$|E
40|$|After {{heating and}} cooling, thermal {{balneology}} was in 2010 {{the second most}} important sector of direct uses in Italy, with 149 thermal localities using hot water for balneotherapy, with no combination with other direct uses. This is why, in 2009 and 2010, UGI conducted regional studies on their water and energy balance to investigate the possible optimization of the heat consumption by coupling thermal bathing with other upstream and downstream direct uses. Moreover, since two thirds of the spas utilize water in part artificially heated, the studies also evaluated the energy consumption of the heating process and compared the result with the geothermal fraction of the energy used. After an overview of the geological and hydrogeological settings of low-temperature geothermal resources, the paper describes the situation of thermal balneology in Italy at Dec. 2010, estimating the volume of hot water consumed, and the amount of heat used by the overall spa system at the regional and national level. The methodology devised to analyze the various components of the water and energy balance and its conceptual flow diagrams are described in the paper. The paper also reviews the different types of direct uses which, depending on the temperature of the water available upstream (T > 38 °C) and downstream (T < 28 °C) of the <b>thermal</b> <b>establishments,</b> might be associated with the thermal balneotherapy. Finally, the paper pinpoints the benefits that might arise from the development of multiple uses combined with the thermal balneology, in terms of: i) oil saved; ii) displaced CO 2 emissions; iii) higher number of spa users; iv) increased tourist activity in the spa areas; and v) creation of new production activities and jobs in the same areas...|$|E

25|$|It is the Duke of Chablais, son of King Victor Amadeus III, to whom Aix {{owes its}} renaissance {{because it was}} he who, after having tasted the benefit of sources and {{found it to be}} poorly housed, {{suggested}} the construction of a <b>thermal</b> <b>establishment</b> to the king. By royal appointment on 11 June 1776, King Victor Amadeus III commissioned Robiland to draw up plans for a bathing establishment.

This date also marks the beginning of the demolition of the old town centre, as a result of this imposing construction, people began to clear the surrounding houses to create the place.

5000|$|It {{was in the}} 1840s {{that the}} thermal waters were {{uncovered}} {{as a result of}} deep drilling for salt which had become highly taxed under the Dutch. Karl Gotthelf Kind, who had found salt in Germany and hoped to do the same in Mondorf, discovered the waters after drilling to a record depth of 736 metres. Despite their mineral properties, the waters were not suitable for salt a brownish colour caused by the rich iron content which emerged after distilling. Nevertheless, the local notary, J.-P. Ledure, saw other opportunities for the waters and was successful in finding support for setting up the [...] "Société des Bains de Mondorf". The architect Charles Eydt was immediately commissioned to build the <b>thermal</b> <b>establishment</b> which was inaugurated on 20 June 1847. As a result of the spa's success, the village prospered as rich French guests came to stay in the luxurious hotels which sprang up in the vicinity. The flow of visitors from France was however halted in 1871 when the Germans occupied Alsace and Lorraine.|$|R

40|$|The {{combination}} of visible and thermal {{data from the}} ground and astrophysics space missions is key to improving the scientific understanding of near-Earth, main-belt, trojans, centaurs, and trans-Neptunian objects. To get full information on a small sample of selected bodies we combine different methods and techniques: lightcurve inversion, stellar occultations, thermophysical modeling, radiometric methods, radar ranging and adaptive optics imaging. The SBNAF project will derive size, spin and shape, thermal inertia, surface roughness, and in some cases bulk densities and even internal structure and composition, for objects out to the most distant regions in the Solar System. The applications to objects with ground-truth information allows us to advance the techniques beyond the current state-of-the-art and to assess the limitations of each method. We present results from our project's first phase: the analysis of combined Herschel-KeplerK 2 data and Herschel-occultation data for TNOs; synergy studies on large MBAs from combined high-quality visual and <b>thermal</b> data; <b>establishment</b> of well-known asteroids as celestial calibrators for far-infrared, sub-millimetre, and millimetre projects; first results on near-Earth asteroids properties from combined lightcurve, radar and thermal measurements, as well as the Hayabusa- 2 mission target characterisation. We also introduce public web-services and tools for studies of small bodies in general. Comment: Accepted for publication in Advances in Space Research, 43 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
40|$|The current {{project was}} {{performed}} {{under the direction}} of Dr. Byron Pipes as its lead investigator from January 2001 to August 2004. With the permission of the NASA, the project was transferred to Dr. Thein Kyu as the principle investigator for the period of September 2004 - June 2005. There were two major thrust areas in the original proposal; (1) experimental characterization and kinematics of foam structure formation and (2) determination of the mechanical, physical, and thermal properties, although these thrust areas were further sub- divided into 7 tasks. The present project has been directed primarily to elucidate kinematics of micro-foam formation (tasks 1 and 3) and to characterize micro-foam structures, since the control of the micro-structure of these foams is of paramount importance in determining their physical, mechanical and thermal properties. The first thrust area was accomplished in a timely manner; however, the second thrust area of foam properties (tasks 2, 4 - 7) has yet to be completed because the area of kinematics of foam structure formation turned out to be extremely complex and thus consumed more time than what have been anticipated. As will be reported in what follows, the present studies have greatly enhances the in-depth understanding of mechanisms and kinematics of the micro-foam formation from solid powders. However, in order to implement all objectives of the second thrust areas regarding investigations of mechanical, physical, and <b>thermal</b> properties and <b>establishment</b> of the correlation of structure - properties of the foams, the project needs additional time and resources. The technical highlights of the accomplishment are summarized as follows. The present study represents a first approach to understanding the complexities that act together in the powder foaming process to achieve the successful inflation of polyimide microstructures. This type of study is novel as no prior work had dissected the fundamentals that govern the inflation process in this type of systems. The systematic approach to each of the different phenomena (i. e. morphological, diffusive, kinetic and dynamic) brings into context each of {{them in a way that}} allows separate understanding and analysis. Of the different phenomena studied, probably the one that gives a higher level of control over the inflation process has been shown to be the morphological aspects of the precursor particles. It is a major contribution of the present work to isolate and identify this phenomenon and highlight the features that with careful control during the synthesis of the precursor material can lead to a highly optimized and specialized final product (neat foam or microstructure). Some of these accomplishments have been presented in various national meetings and some of which are either published in refereed journals or still in various stages of publications. One of the presentations was selected for "Best of ANTEC 2004 " Online Presentation Series of the Society of Plastics Engineers (SPE) (September 2004...|$|R
