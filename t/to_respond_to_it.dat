5|$|Although not {{commonly}} {{understood as}} Gnostic, many scholars, including Bultmann, have forcefully {{argued that the}} Gospel of John has elements in common with Gnosticism. Christian Gnosticism did not fully develop until the mid-2nd century, and so 2nd-century Proto-Orthodox Christians concentrated much effort in examining and refuting it. To say John's gospel contained elements of Gnosticism is to assume that Gnosticism had developed to a level that required the author <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> Bultmann, for example, argued that the opening theme of the Gospel of John, the pre-existing Logos, was actually a Gnostic theme.

Rome needed to ensure that no major threat to the peace existed, not merely in the Balkans, but in the whole Aegean area, including Asia Minor. … It was necessary to redefine, but this time not just in terms of physical geography but in terms of geo-politics."

One {{problem with the}} [...] "second generation" [...] design approach described above was that the plotting of causal links amongst twenty or so medium-term strategic goals was still a relatively abstract activity. In practice it ignored the fact that opportunities to intervene, to influence strategic goals are, and need to be, anchored in current and real management activity. Secondly, the need to [...] "roll forward" [...] and test {{the impact of these}} goals necessitated the creation of an additional design instrument: the Vision or Destination Statement.

They also noted that there was a yawning gap between the actual material threat posed by terrorists, and the level of investment and activity devoted <b>to</b> <b>responding</b> <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> They suggested that a central analytical task facing critical scholars of terrorism was therefore to explain “how such a small set of behaviours by such small numbers of individuals generates such a pervasive, intrusive and complex series of effects across the world” (Ibid). Lastly, they noted that the political, legal, cultural and academic context in which the journal was being launched was characterised by a very violent global war on terror, frequent moral panics and the political manipulation of terrorism fears, increasingly draconian anti-terrorism legislation, and the mass proliferation of academic and cultural terrorism-related texts...|$|R
2500|$|Few {{critics of}} Beves of Hampton have shared Eugen Kölbing's opinion that, [...] "The strain {{in which this}} work is written, is serious, even severe". More {{recently}} Derek Pearsall {{was one of those}} who took the diametrically opposite view: [...] "Beves of Hamtoun makes every possible concession to popular taste. The story is a heady brew of outrageous incident... the whole fantastic pot-pourri is carried off with irresistible panache and a marked sense of the comic. It is vivid, gross and ridiculous by turns, but never dull." [...] Again, it has been said that [...] "Bevis of Hampton is not a remarkable example of medieval romance. It is made up of stock motifs and episodes... the articulation of the episodes is loose and inexpert. What gives the romance its chief distinction is its exuberance, its racy, buoyant style, and the spirit of broad humor in which it is written." [...] Dieter Mehl called it [...] "extremely lively and entertaining, though on the whole rather artless". [...] In other words, the poem is often treated as an example of what G. K. Chesterton and George Orwell called the [...] "good bad book", having the characteristics that make for readability and popular success rather than high literary quality. W. R. J. Barron was not enthusiastic about works of this kind: [...] "The English versions of Bevis and Guy are competent but somewhat vulgarized, given to the reduplication of striking effects, paying lip-service to the heroes' values while almost wholly preoccupied by their adventures". Other critics have found themselves enjoying Beves almost in spite of themselves. George Kane wrote that it [...] "has a better effect than its component material would seem to warrant, for this almost formless story, with its miracles and marvels, ranting Saracens and dragons, is told without any polish or skill in a style generously padded and tagged, with little sense of poetic or narrative art, and still the romance is more than merely readable. As with Horn and Havelok we tolerate its artistic crudity for the sake of the company of the hero and heroine, Beues and Iosiane, who reflect the warm humanity of the imagination that created them." [...] The romance's most recent editors considered that [...] "If the values of the hero are not particularly deep, they are nonetheless heartfelt, and expressed with admirable verve. And we should be reluctant to underestimate the value of a good adventure story or the difficulty of producing one. Its energy and its variety, perhaps more than anything, are what enable modern readers to understand its earlier popularity and also <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> in the present." ...|$|E
