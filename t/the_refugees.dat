5|$|Aiming {{to reduce}} {{evidence}} of political failure, Yugoslav authorities sought to disperse <b>the</b> <b>refugees</b> {{in various parts}} of Serbia and prevent their concentration in the capital, Belgrade. The government encouraged <b>the</b> <b>refugees</b> to settle in predominantly Hungarian areas of Vojvodina, and in Kosovo, which was largely populated by Albanians, leading to increased instability in those regions. Even though 20,000 were planned to be settled in Kosovo, only 4,000 moved to the region. After 12 August, the Serbian authorities started to deport some of <b>the</b> <b>refugees</b> who were of military age, declaring them illegal immigrants. They were turned over to the VRS or the ARSK in eastern Croatia for conscription. Some of the conscripts were publicly humiliated and beaten for abandoning the RSK. In some areas, ethnic Croats of Vojvodina were evicted from their homes by <b>the</b> <b>refugees</b> themselves to claim new accommodations. Similarly, <b>the</b> <b>refugees</b> moving through Banja Luka forced Croats and Bosniaks out of their homes.|$|E
5|$|The university, {{which is}} built on high ground, served as an {{evacuation}} point and emergency shelter for thousands of flood refugees. The civil defense director of the university expected between 700 and 800 people to take shelter at the university. Between 7,000 and 8,000 showed up as the water rose through August 14 and 15 and crammed into facilities designed to house just over 1,000 students. A helipad {{was set up in}} a parking lot, and helicopters from Eielson Air Force Base ferried supplies to <b>the</b> <b>refugees.</b> Fairbanks' power plant was flooded, so the university depended on its physical plant to provide electricity for <b>the</b> <b>refugees.</b> When the rising water threatened to flood the plant, hundreds of <b>the</b> <b>refugees</b> massed to build barricades and pump out the plant's basement.|$|E

5|$|In 1986, the NRA {{captured}} Kampala with a {{force of}} 14,000 soldiers, including 500 Rwandans, and formed a new government. After Museveni was inaugurated as president, he appointed Kagame and Rwigyema as senior officers in the new Ugandan army. The experience of the Bush War inspired Rwigyema and Kagame to consider an attack against Rwanda, {{with the goal of}} allowing <b>the</b> <b>refugees</b> to return home. In addition to fulfilling their army duties, the pair began building a covert network of Rwandan Tutsi refugees within the army's ranks, intended as the nucleus for such an attack. With the pro-refugee Museveni in power, RANU was able to move back to Kampala. At its 1987 convention, it renamed itself to the Rwandan Patriotic Front, and it too committed to returning <b>the</b> <b>refugees</b> to Rwanda by any means possible. In 1988, a leadership crisis within the RPF prompted Fred Rwigyema to intervene in the organisation and take control, replacing Peter Bayingana as RPF president. Kagame and other senior members of Rwigyema's Rwandan entourage within the NRA also joined, with Kagame assuming the vice-presidency. Bayingana remained as the other vice-president, but resented the loss of the leadership.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{bachelor}} thesis was {{to examine}} how the Swedish tabloid press represent women <b>refugees</b> in <b>the</b> news coverage of <b>the</b> european <b>refugee</b> crisis.   <b>The</b> main question was: How are women <b>refugees</b> represented in <b>the</b> tabloid press news stories about <b>the</b> <b>refugee</b> crisis? To approach our question we used a critical discourse analysis. We examined a total of 17 news stories published {{during the first two}} weeks in September 2015, all of them published in Aftonbladet, Expressen, GT or Kvällsposten. During the analysis a total of four discursive themes emerged: <b>The</b> strong <b>refugee</b> woman, <b>the</b> weak <b>refugee</b> woman, <b>the</b> invisible <b>refugee</b> woman and <b>the</b> <b>refugee</b> woman as a mother figure. Three of our themes – <b>the</b> weak <b>refugee</b> woman, <b>the</b> invisible <b>refugee</b> woman and <b>the</b> <b>refugee</b> woman as a mother figure – are examples of how old ideologies about refugees and women still are present in the Swedish evening papers of today. These constructions  are based on myths and historical stereotypes.   Even though <b>the</b> <b>refugee</b> woman commonly are described as weak, subordinated and inactive, she can also be described as strong and independent – <b>the</b> strong <b>refugee</b> woman.

50|$|Overall, {{for reasons}} that were beyond the Commission's task of facilitation, this {{movement}} {{did not come to}} pass. The respective attitudes of the parties on this matter—attitudes which produced a complete deadlock as regards <b>the</b> <b>refugee</b> question—are well known. The Arab States insisted upon a prior solution of <b>the</b> <b>refugee</b> question, at least in principle, before agreeing to discuss other outstanding issues. In their opinion, a solution of <b>the</b> <b>refugee</b> problem could be reached only as a result of unconditional acceptance by Israel of <b>the</b> right of <b>refugees</b> to be repatriated. Israel, on the other hand, has maintained that no solution of <b>the</b> <b>refugee</b> question involving repatriation could be envisaged outside the framework of an over-all settlement.|$|R
40|$|Under International law, a State may {{refuse to}} accord entry permit to its {{territory}} for aliens. However, {{there is always}} a possibility that under certain circumstances an alien enters a State without having any permit as it is in <b>the</b> case of <b>refugee.</b> <b>Refugees</b> have <b>the</b> right to be given protection as attached to their <b>refugee</b> status. <b>The</b> <b>refugee</b> rights for protection by the host state is included in various regional and International treaties such as Conventin relating <b>the</b> Status of <b>Refugee</b> 1951 and Protocol relating <b>the</b> Status of <b>Refugee</b> 1967. In reality, <b>the</b> <b>refugee</b> problem is more complex as it relates to legal issues such as those in regard to asylum seeker, stateless persons, illegal immigrant, and extradition.

40|$|Australia {{has shifted}} {{the way it}} conceives its {{international}} obligations under <b>the</b> <b>Refugee</b> Convention, calling into question its continuing viability as a protection instrument. <b>The</b> <b>Refugee</b> Convention was a progressive step towards the international {{recognition of human rights}} and justice. It invokes the key obligation of non-refoulement, which prohibits State Parties from returning a vulnerable person to a place where their life or security is threatened. <b>The</b> <b>Refugee</b> Convention must contend with state sovereignty, which is the integral right of states to control the entry and residence of those within their territories. In the last few decades, <b>the</b> <b>Refugee</b> Convention has been confronted by a number of major challenges. In the current climate, the principle of state sovereignty is in competition with the humanitarian goal of protecting refugees. When faced with asylum seekers at their borders, many States have adopted restrictive practices in order to evade their protection obligations. This indicates a clear preference for sovereignty at the expense of human rights. While historically committed to <b>the</b> <b>Refugee</b> Convention, <b>the</b> governments of Australia have since implemented a range of measures to deter refugees from seeking asylum. Of these, the most contentious include prolonged mandatory detention and offshore processing. These policies are a blatant violation of Australia’s obligations under <b>the</b> <b>Refugee</b> Convention, especially with respect to non-refoulement. It is clear that <b>the</b> <b>Refugee</b> Convention is not being honoured in the way that it once was. It will be argued that despite contemporary issues, <b>the</b> <b>Refugee</b> Convention’s key principle of non-refoulement is the most significant obligation for protecting refugees and remains highly significant...|$|R
5|$|While {{approximately}} 35,000 Serb refugees, trapped {{with the}} surrendered ARSK Kordun Corps, were evacuated to Yugoslavia via Sisak and the ZagrebBelgrade motorway, {{the bulk of}} <b>the</b> <b>refugees</b> followed a route through the Republika Srpska, arriving there via Dvor in Banovina or via Srb in Likatwo corridors to Serb-held territory in Bosnia and Herzegovina left as the HV advanced. The two points of retreat were created {{as a consequence of}} the delay of a northward advance of the HV Split Corps after the capture of Knin, and the decision not to use the entire HV 2nd Guards Brigade to spearhead the southward advance from Petrinja. The retreating ARSK, transporting large quantities of weaponry, ammunition, artillery and tanks, often intermingled with evacuating or fleeing civilians, had few roads to use. The escaping columns were reportedly intermittently attacked by CAF jets, and the HV, trading fire with the ARSK located close to the civilian columns. <b>The</b> <b>refugees</b> were also targeted by ARBiH troops, as well as by VRS jets, and sometimes were run over by the ARSK Special Units Corps' retreating tanks. On 9 August, a refugee convoy evacuating from the former Sector North under the terms of the ARSK Kordun Corps' surrender agreement was attacked by Croatian civilians in Sisak. The attack caused one civilian death, many injuries and damage to a large number of vehicles. Croatian police intervened in the incident after UN civilian police monitors pressured them to do so. The next day, US ambassador Galbraith joined the column to protect them, and the Croatian police presence along the planned route increased. <b>The</b> <b>refugees</b> moving through the Republika Srpska were extorted at checkpoints and forced to pay extra for fuel and other services by local strongmen.|$|E
