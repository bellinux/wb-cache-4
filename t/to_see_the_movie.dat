5|$|As {{the patrons}} leave due to not {{receiving}} a refund, the pictures going black {{when they were}} getting to important scenes, and complain about {{the taste of the}} popcorn (due to the mess the babies have made in the concession stand), Stu is angry at the fact that The Land Without Smiles went out at the climax. But at least they think that Tommy can go through a whole movie without any fuss. Because they didn't see the ending, Didi and Stu decide to go out <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> again next week, but at a different theater. As Grandpa Lou eats a candy bar in the back seat, Tommy takes notice of a flashing Reptar billboard as they drive by.|$|E

25|$|When Moriarty took over, {{he decided}} to start again from scratch. This version of the {{production}} was even more similar to the released game. However, it contained one extra character: a Japanese business tycoon and science-hobbyist named Toshi Olema, who uses his money to buy his way onto the Attila project crew. Toshi would have met a gruesome death when he stumbled into a cavern with acid dripping from the ceiling, and the other astronauts would {{have been unable to}} safely retrieve his body and bring him back with life crystals. He was later completely removed from the story. This version of the game was also very bloody and adult. Initially, Spielberg thought this feel was very fitting. However, after the release of Jurassic Park in 1993, Spielberg received numerous complaints from parents who had ignored the PG-13 rating and brought their young children <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie,</b> only to discover that it contained some sequences of horror, blood, and violence. Thus, worrying that parents would make a similar mistake and purchase The Dig for their kids, Spielberg requested the violence be toned down. Other notable design ideas which were dropped during the game's production include a survival angle, which forced the player to keep water and food supplies for life support, and exploration of entire cities on the planet. Although The Dig was first announced for release in Summer 1992, it ultimately did not launch until December 1995.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} 2012, {{a special}} project titled hide Rocket Dive 2013~2014 ~20th Solo Works & 50th of Birth Anniversary was announced. It {{includes}} films shown in several locations on May 2, including some overseas, the re-opening of the hide museum and plans to hold another hide memorial summit festival. Two tribute albums, following the first in 1999, were released on July 3, 2013 and contain twenty-five tracks covered by newer visual kei acts such as heidi., Sadie, Matenrou Opera and Screw. Two more tribute albums were released on August 28, the first being covers of hide's songs in a classical music theme, and the latter his song's remixed by Spread Beaver member INA. Two additional tribute albums were released on December 18 as the final installments, one composed of covers by female recording artists such as Koda Kumi and Kanon Wakeshima, and the other by rock acts including D'erlanger and Kinniku Shōjo Tai. The hide Museum 2013 was in Odaiba from June 27 to July 28, when it moved to Universal Studios Japan in Osaka for August 7 to September 8. The new live concert film hide Alive the Movie -hide Indian Summer Special Limited Edition- was shown in theaters throughout Japan. Special limited tickets <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> came with a thirteen-track live CD of songs from the depicted concert, which was recorded on September 8, 1996 at Chiba Marine Stadium.|$|E

500|$|Mike Scully {{wanted to}} do an episode where the {{children}} of Springfield {{would be subject to}} a curfew. He {{came up with the idea}} to do a Kids vs. Adults episode, where the children would be blamed for something the adults have done. The name of the baseball announcer, Denis Conroy, was used because that is the name of writer Larry Doyle's uncle. Dan Castellaneta ad libbed Homer singing [...] "Hitler is a jerk, Mussolini...." [...] It was added in to the episode only for the purpose of filling time. The Chief Wiggum billboard sketch was inspired by Beaver Cleaver getting stuck in a soup bowl billboard during the [...] "In the Soup" [...] episode of Leave It to Beaver.

500|$|On May 23, 2016, it was {{reported}} that Miramax and Blumhouse Productions were developing a new Halloween film, which they would co-finance. John Carpenter is set to executive produce the project and act as creative consultant. Carpenter said, [...] "Thirty-eight years after the original Halloween, I'm going to help {{to try to make the}} 10th sequel the scariest of them all." [...] On February 9, 2017, Carpenter announced that the new Halloween film would be released on October 19, 2018 and was going to be written by David Gordon Green and Danny McBride, and directed by Green. It will be a direct sequel to the original film and will ignore all the sequels. In September 2017, Jamie Lee Curtis confirmed that she would reprise her role as Laurie Strode. In October, Judy Greer entered negotiations to play Laurie's daughter Karen Strode. The film will be distributed by Universal Pictures, their first involvement in the franchise since distributing 1982's Halloween III: Season of the Witch. On October 17, 2017, Carpenter announced that he would be returning to score the upcoming film, saying [...] "I’ll be consulting with the director to see what he feels. I could create a new score, we could update the old score and amplify it, or we could combine those two things. I’ll have <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> to see what it requires." ...|$|E
500|$|Some reviews {{were more}} positive. Welch D. Everman, author of Cult Science Fiction Films, {{compared}} {{the relationship between}} West and Nelson to that of Victor Frankenstein and his monster in Mary Shelly's novel Frankenstein (1818). Everman wrote, [...] "This {{is the kind of}} movie we've come to expect from AIP — cheaply made, nasty, and lots of fun". John W. Bowen of the Belleville Intelligencer said he enjoyed the [...] "camp" [...] style of the film, adding, [...] "It's both inexplicable and sad this brain-damaged yet fiercely determined little drive-in bottom feeder never garnered more than a tiny cult following over the years". A 1978 critique in The Review of the News said, [...] "Films like The Incredible Melting Man are not made to be good; they are made to be scary. For anyone looking to raise goosebumps on their flesh, this one is sufficient to give you your money's worth". Matt Maiellaro, co-creator of the Cartoon Network series Aqua Teen Hunger Force, said the film inspired him to start making films himself, adding, [...] "When I was eight, I watched The Incredible Melting Man and knew that horror movies were going to be big religion in my life". Z movie director Tim Ritter said he was partially inspired to enter show business by watching a trailer for The Incredible Melting Man at age 9. Ritter said, [...] "I was too young <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie,</b> but the trailer really got into my imagination".|$|E

500|$|South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut is {{a cautionary}} tale {{on the dangers of}} censorship. It uses the {{execution}} of Terrance and Phillip as the Seventh Sign in a parody of the Apocalypse. Cartman's use of foul language helps to avert the disaster. Parents and [...] "lazy child rearing" [...] come in for particularly sharp criticism. On their way to see Terrance and Phillip, the boys sing that [...] "movies teach us what our parents don't have time to say!" [...] During [...] "Blame Canada" [...] a couple are seen abandoning their baby in their enthusiasm to join Mothers Against Canada. The song ends with: [...] "We must blame them and cause a fuss / Before somebody thinks of blaming us!" [...] Much of the film's satire and many of the songs are concerned with the refusal of people to accept responsibility for failure and their tendency to look for scapegoats (some of the songs are also parodies of musical theatre, but this is usually secondary to furthering the satire). Movies, government, society, foreigners and Satan are all blamed, leading Kyle to remark: [...] "whenever I get in trouble, you go off and blame everybody else. But I'm the one to blame. Deal with me." [...] The movie is also self-reflective in nature. The enthusiasm the kids display for seeing the Terrance and Phillip movie reflects the creators' anticipation of the real world enthusiasm many people, including those under age, would experience <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The American Conservative reported, [...] "The {{movie has}} been {{promoted}} by bloggers on National Review Online.

2500|$|In The Guardian, Simon Winder {{lamented that}} the film, [...] "despite {{twisting}} {{and turning to}} be even-handed, simply could not help itself and, like some faux-reformed alcoholic, gorged itself on an entire miniature liqueur selection of Anglo-German clichés". David Denby of The New Yorker wrote about the film that [...] "The horses themselves are magnificent, and maybe that's reason enough <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie.</b> But War Horse is a bland, bizarrely unimaginative piece of work".|$|E

50|$|For viewing MovieCDs, Sirius {{recommended}} a 486 processor or higher, at least 8 MB of RAM, and 2x-speed CD-ROM drives (most MovieCDs had a data {{rate of about}} 280-300 kB/sec).

2500|$|The Peruvian Episcopal Conference (CEP) {{declared}} the movie—and the book—as {{part of a}} [...] "systematic attack on the Catholic Church". Furthermore, the Archbishop of Lima, the Cardinal and member of Opus Dei Juan Luis Cipriani, urged his community not to see the film: [...] "If someone goes (<b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie),</b> they are giving money to those who hurt the faith. It's not a problem of fiction; if truth is not respected, what arises we could call white glove terrorism." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{feature film}} {{based on the}} massacre, Out of the Blue, {{directed}} by Robert Sarkies and starring Karl Urban, premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on 12 September 2006. The production faced opposition from some citizens in Aramoana, {{which resulted in the}} majority of the movie having to be filmed in another nearby township. However, eventually the community did allow a small number of scenes to be filmed in Aramoana. They agreed to the making of the movie only if the title was not [...] "Aramoana" [...] and if they were <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> beforehand.|$|E
2500|$|Conservative media {{praised the}} film. Glenn Beck {{described}} [...] "Obsession" [...] as [...] "one {{of the most}} important movies of our lifetime".

25|$|Kesey {{originally}} {{was involved in}} creating the film, but left two weeks into production. He claimed never <b>to</b> have <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> because of a dispute over the $20,000 he was initially paid for the film rights. Kesey loathed the fact that, unlike the book, the film was not narrated by the Chief Bromden character, and he disagreed with Jack Nicholson's being cast as Randle McMurphy (he wanted Gene Hackman). Despite this, Faye Kesey has stated {{that her husband was}} generally supportive of the film and pleased that it was made.|$|R
5000|$|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} greatest American films.

[...] Kesey himself claimed never <b>to</b> have <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie,</b> but said he disliked what he knew of it, a fact confirmed by Chuck Palahniuk who wrote, [...] "The first time I heard this story, it was through <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> starring Jack Nicholson.

2500|$|Dembski {{participated in}} the {{documentary}} film , released in 2008. Dembski told the Southern Baptist Texan that those who need <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> are the [...] "parents of children in high school or college, {{as well as those}} children themselves, who may think that the biological sciences are a dispassionate search for truth about life but many of whose practitioners see biology, especially evolutionary biology, as an ideological weapon to destroy faith in God." [...] Dembski has appeared on several television shows, including a 2005 interview with Jon Stewart on The Daily Show with Edward Larson and Ellie Crystal where he said he accepted religion before science.|$|E
2500|$|Britten {{had been}} contemplating the novella {{for many years}} and began work in September 1970 with {{approaches}} to Piper and to Golo Mann, son of the author. Because of agreements between Warner Brothers and the estate of Thomas Mann for the production of Luchino Visconti's 1971 film, Britten was advised not <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> when it was released. According to Colin Graham, director of the first production of the opera, some colleagues of the composer who did see the film found the relationship between Tadzio and Aschenbach [...] "too sentimental and salacious". This contributed to the decision that Tadzio and his family and friends would be portrayed by non-speaking dancers. Ian Bostridge has noted themes in the work of [...] "formalism in art and the perilous dignity of the acclaimed artist".|$|E
2500|$|Rhino hired Terry Gilliam and {{was granted}} an {{extension}} from Thompson {{but only with}} the stipulation that the director made the film. Rhino {{did not want to}} commit to Gilliam in case he didn't work out. Thompson remembers, [...] "They just kept asking for more [...] I got kind of agitated about it, because I thought they were trying to put off doing it. So I began to charge them more... I wanted <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> done, once it got started." [...] The studio threatened to make the film with Cox and without Depp and del Toro. The two actors were upset when producer Laila Nabulsi told them of Rhino's plans. Universal Pictures stepped in to distribute the film and Depp and Gilliam were paid $500,000 each but the director still did not have a firm deal in place. In retaliation, Depp and Gilliam locked Rhino out of the set during filming.|$|E
