5|$|The Jackson's {{hartebeest}} {{does not}} have a clear taxonomic status. It is regarded as a hybrid between the Lelwel and Coke's hartebeest. The African Antelope Database (1998) treats it as synonymous to the Lelwel hartebeest. From Lake Baringo to Mount Kenya, the Jackson's hartebeest significantly resembles the Lelwel hartebeest, whereas from Lake Victoria to {{the southern part of the}} Rift Valley it tends <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> the Coke's hartebeest.|$|E
5|$|During the game's development, {{the team}} lacked artists. The art {{director}} at Epic Games, Shane Caudle, and the artists at Digital Extremes {{could not make}} enough new textures because {{of the amount of}} diversity in characters and maps. In order to supplement the skin and texture production, Epic turned to contract artist Steve Garofalo. The game's level and content management program, UnrealEd, was written in Visual Basic and considered buggy, but no one had time to fix it. The game engine had an object-oriented design, and the scripting language, UnrealScript, was considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> Java. The modularity of the object-oriented design meant that programmers could make large changes without affecting other parts of the game. Other tools used during development included Microsoft Visual Studio and 3D Studio Max. All of the weapon sound effects were created by Sonic Mayhem. The soundtrack for the game, which employed the system of module files, was written by Alexander Brandon, Michiel van den Bos, Andrew Sega, Dan Gardopee and Peter Hajba.|$|E

Although the A-Deck Promenade remained open for the entirety of Olympics career, the B-Deck promenade was vetoed and staterooms added like those on Titanic, {{as well as a}} Café Parisien and enlarged restaurant.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the covert}} nature {{surrounding}} this particular {{branch of the}} Wizarding government, the Department of Mysteries can be likened to real-world intelligence agencies like the CIA or MI6 in that most of their operations are kept in total secrecy from the general wizard populace. However, the primary operations of the department seem <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> those of scientists {{as they attempt to}} uncover the sources and rules that govern magic.|$|E
30|$|In Experiment 2, the {{comprehension}} {{of a story}} told by a more visually expressive agent was {{greater than that of}} a non-expressive agent. Subtle interactions between facial expression and story content manifested through the use of two stories that were matched in difficulty but differed in content. The more expressive agent tended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>liked</b> but <b>was</b> also regarded as humorous when the story was less biographical. Expressive facial gestures may aid learning through increased redundancy and increased cognitive load (Stevens et al. 2013; Tindall-Ford et al. 1997). No correlation between comprehension and ratings of engagement rules out distractibility from the more expressive agent as an explanation.|$|R

25|$|The contra-auguste {{plays the}} role of the {{mediator}} between the white clown and the auguste character. He has a lower status than the white clown but a higher status than the auguste. He aspires <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> the white clown and often mimics everything the white clown does to try to gain approval. If there is a contra-auguste character, he often is instructed by the whiteface to correct the auguste when he is doing something wrong.|$|E
25|$|Catherine Earnshaw: First {{introduced}} to the reader after her death, through Lockwood's discovery of her diary and carvings. The description of her life is confined almost entirely to the first volume. She seems unsure whether she is, or wants to become, more like Heathcliff, or aspires <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> Edgar. Some critics have argued that her decision to marry Edgar Linton is allegorically a rejection of nature and a surrender to culture, a choice with unfortunate, fateful consequences {{for all the other}} characters.|$|E
25|$|From the outset, {{money market}} funds fell under the {{jurisdiction}} of the SEC as they appeared <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> investments (most similar to traditional stocks and bonds) vs. deposits and loans (cash and cash equivalents the domain of the bankers). Although {{money market funds}} are quite close to and are often accounted for as cash equivalents their main regulator, the SEC, has zero mandate to control the supply of money, limit the overall extension of credit, mitigate against boom and bust cycles, etc. The SEC’s focus remains on adequate disclosure of risk, and honesty and integrity in financial reporting and trading markets. After adequate disclosure, the SEC adopts a hands off, let the buyer beware attitude.|$|E

25|$|Athena {{is shown}} to have an aegis diagonally across her peplos in the sculpture. The aegis has a {{miniature}} Gorgon's head on it along with a border of snakes. Its small dimensions make it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a marker of Athena’s identity than an actual piece of armament. The diagonal positioning of the aegis is seen to give Athena a swaying motion — some say {{in order to have}} the viewer’s eye look towards what Athena was holding in her right hand. There is a hole in the palm of the right hand and the right thumb indicating that Athena was originally holding an item, but that item's identity it is not certain. Some suggest it might have been an owl or the representation of victory, Nike. It is also thought that Athena may have held in her left hand a spear or a shield.|$|E
25|$|As President, Erdoğan has overseen {{a revival}} of Ottoman tradition, {{greeting}} Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas with an Ottoman-style ceremony in the new presidential palace, with guards dressed in costumes representing founders of 16 Great Turkish Empires in history. While serving as the Prime Minister of Turkey, Erdoğan's AKP made references to the Ottoman era during election campaigns, such as calling their supporters 'grandsons of Ottomans' (Osmanlı torunu). This proved controversial, since it was perceived to be an open attack against the republican nature of modern Turkey founded by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. In 2015, Erdoğan made a statement in which he endorsed the old Ottoman term külliye to refer to university campuses rather than the standard Turkish word kampüs. Many critics have thus accused Erdoğan of wanting to become an Ottoman sultan and abandon the secular and democratic credentials of the Republic. When pressed on this issue in January 2015, Erdoğan denied these claims {{and said that he}} would aim <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom rather than like an Ottoman sultan.|$|E
500|$|According to Lopez, Anthony had {{the idea}} to {{translate}} [...] "Non Amarmi", an [...] "old Italian song", into Spanish. Two versions of the songs were produced for On the 6, a ballad and a salsa production. The ballad was produced by Dan Shea, while the other was produced by Juan Vicente Zambrano. Lopez stated: [...] "I don't want to be straight Latin! I want it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>like,</b> y'know, dance-y music-y".|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{tested the}} hypothesis that unattractive individuals who were high in public self-consciousness would attempt to compensate for their unattractive appearance in order <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>liked</b> in social settings. A pilot study <b>was</b> used <b>to</b> develop stimulus materials for Studies 1 and 2. In Study 1, dyads of one male and one female participant completed a measure of public self-consciousness and then rated each other on physical attractiveness and likeability before and after having a short interaction. As expected, less attractive individuals who were high (versus low) in public self-consciousness became somewhat more likeable over time. Study 2 demonstrated that these effects were stronger for participants who were given explicit instructions about how to appear likeable. The results provide some support for the idea that low public self-conscious participants {{do not have the}} necessary ability to create positive impressions on others...|$|R

40|$|In {{a recent}} paper in Business Ethics Quarterly Professor Jeffrey Moriarty (2005) {{asserted}} {{the relevance of}} political philosophy to business ethics. Moriarty asked whether "businesses ought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> run (<b>more)</b> <b>like</b> states" and argued why that might be beneficial. This paper on the contrary asserts that there <b>are</b> distinct disadvantages <b>to</b> businesses attempting <b>to</b> <b>be</b> run <b>more</b> <b>like</b> states. Specifically, it asserts that any such an attempt {{increases the likelihood of}} the re-emergence of a totalitarian society as businesses currently often act as an intermediary between the individual and the state. The paper contemplates Moeller&# 039;s ambitions in the Weimar period for the business <b>to</b> <b>be</b> run like a state and the historical outcome of those ambitions. The paper also distinguishes between two different kinds of rights and argues that different kinds of rights pertain to different sectors which preclude business being run like a state...|$|R
500|$|Frink was {{originally}} depicted as an evil scientist in [...] "Old Money", {{since he was}} trying to secure funding for a death ray. When Azaria ad-libbed a voice for the character, he did an impression of Jerry Lewis's Julius Kelp character from The Nutty Professor. The staff liked the voice and therefore changed Frink <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> Julius Kelp, both in appearance and personalityhe became more nerdy, and went from evil to just mad.

Midway through the 200203 season, Horton {{was regarded as}} a top-five North American prospect by the NHL Central Scouting Bureau. Scouts likened Horton, who considered him a [...] "power forward", to John LeClair who was considered {{to be one of the}} best power forwards in the NHL.

500|$|Three years later, in 2003, a Japanese Mother 1+2 {{television}} commercial included a slide that announced a future release of Mother 3. While {{working on the}} compilation that would port Mother and Mother 2 to the Game Boy Advance, Itoi predicted further pressure to release Mother 3 and decided, based on encouragement and the game's fans, to release the game. Itoi had earlier assumed that restarting the project was impossible, and felt that his final effort to finish the game <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a [...] "prayer" [...] than like [...] "vengeance".

500|$|Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire were {{developed}} by Game Freak and Nintendo {{under the direction of}} Junichi Masuda. As with its predecessors, Ken Sugimori was the art director, although these were the first games in which he did not single-handedly produce all of the art. When asked where his design team came up with the ideas for all of the new Pokémon, Sugimori stated that they got their ideas from past experiences in their childhood involving nature, animals, and the media and then base them on insects. Even looking at the world in a different perspective sometimes provided inspiration for the creatures. [...] "First we select an insect and after that we add essential elements to the insects to make it more like Pokemon, such as adding some hard shape to it, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> steel," [...] Sugimori said, describing the process of creating a Pokémon.|$|E
500|$|Before the Grace and Leo storyline was written, NBC {{worried that}} the show's {{characters}} never seemed to move forward or mature.

Greenstein commented that [...] "there was an interchangeability among the episodes from season to season. We wanted to create more continuing story arcs; we wanted to deepen the predicaments the characters are in, get the audience kind of rooting for something from week to week." [...] In November 2002, negotiations were made for Connick to play a series regular on Will & Grace; he originally signed on for only 13 episodes.
