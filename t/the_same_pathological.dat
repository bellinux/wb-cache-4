5000|$|The {{tissue injury}} and repair (TIAR) theory is now widely {{accepted}} {{and suggests that}} uterine hyperperistalsis (i.e., increased peristalsis), during early periods of reproductive life will induce micro-injury at the endometrial-myometrial interface (EMI) region. That again leads to elevation of local estrogen in order to heal the damage. At the same time, estrogen treatment will increase uterine peristalsis again, leading to a vicious circle and a chain of biological alterations essential {{for the development of}} adenomyosis. Iatrogenic injury of the junctional zone or physiological damages due to placental implantation most likely results in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>pathological</b> cascade.

The string-of-beads aspect is the most characteristic aspect of FMD and indicates the presence of medial lesions [1]. The other angiographic aspects are less specific to a histological type.|$|R

40|$|Intravitreal {{neovascular}} {{diseases are}} {{a major cause of}} blindness worldwide. It remains unclear why neovessels in many retinal diseases spread into the physiologically nonvascularized vitreous rather than into the ischemic retinal areas, where the angiogenic factors are released. Here we show that inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) is expressed in the ischemic retina. Using iNOS knockout mice and the iNOS inhibitor 1400 W, we demonstrate that iNOS expression inhibits angiogenesis locally in the avascular retina, mediated at least in part by a downregulation of VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR 2) in cells adjacent to iNOS-expressing cells. At <b>the</b> <b>same</b> time, <b>pathological</b> intravitreal neovascularization is considerably stronger in iNOS-expressing animals. These findings demonstrate that iNOS plays a crucial role in retinal neovascular disease and show that it offers an ideal target for the control of vitreal neovascularization through improvement of the vascularization of the hypoxic retina...|$|R
40|$|Abstract In rheumatic heart disease, cardiac valves often display only a non{{specific}} postinflammatory scarring, without specific features, {{such as the}} rheumatic granuloma. Fifty-five native valves excised from 47 patients, exhibiting postinflammatory scarring, were studied.

Differences in terms of sex, age, and valvular involvement were detected among group III and the others, whereas patients belonging to the first two {{groups did not differ}} significantly.

40|$|While {{there may}} be many causes of Alzheimer's disease (AD), <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>pathological</b> {{sequence}} of events, described here by John Hardy and David Allsop, is {{likely to occur in}} all cases. The recent discovery of a pathogenic mutation in the beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene on chromosome 21 suggests that APP Mismetabolism and beta-amyloid deposition are the primary events in the disease process. The occurrence of AD in Down syndrome is consistent with this hypothesis. The pathological cascade for the disease process is most likely to be: beta-amyloid deposition [...] tau phosphorylation and tangle formation [...] neuronal death. The development of a biochemical understanding of this pathological cascade will facilitate rational design of drugs to intervene in this process...|$|E

40|$|The {{foregoing}} {{comparative study}} on the subcutaneous nodules in rheumatic fever and rheumatoid arthritis is presented {{as part of an}} investigation which has been conducted in this clinic on the relationship of the two clinical entities, rheumatic fever and rheumatoid arthritis.

40|$|Abstract: The {{concepts}} of Western medicine in treating tumor have changed markedly in recent years, {{and begun to}} put more emphasis on the whole survival status of patients. With recent emergence of targeted drugs, {{it was found that}} curative effects of <b>the</b> <b>same</b> targeted drugs in treating patients with <b>the</b> <b>same</b> tumor type even <b>the</b> <b>same</b> tumor <b>pathological</b> subtype but different therapeutic targets may be different. On the contrary, the curative effects of different targeted drugs in treating patients with different tumor types but <b>the</b> <b>same</b> therapeutic targets may be similar. Accordingly, the viewpoint of personalized therapy is advocated in Western medicine. Under the guidance of syndrome differentiation treatment in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), patients with <b>the</b> <b>same</b> tumor and different syndromes should be treated by different herbs, and patients with different tumor and <b>the</b> <b>same</b> syndrome should be treated by <b>the</b> <b>same</b> herbs. Both <b>the</b> theories of “the <b>same</b> treatment for <b>the</b> <b>same</b> syndrome” and “the <b>same</b> treatment for <b>the</b> <b>same</b> therapeutic target” indicate that personalized therapy in Western medicine is similar to TCM syndrome differentiation treatment. The article focuses on “different treatments for <b>the</b> <b>same</b> disease” as well as “the same treatment for different diseases” to describe the similar points between personalized therapy and TCM syndrome differentiation treatment and thereby proves that TCM syndrome differentiation treatment is a scientific and essential approach in treating tumor. At <b>the</b> <b>same</b> time, <b>the</b> article also points out the problems and solution methods of TCM syndrome differentiation treatment...|$|R
40|$|CASE HISTORY: A 5 -month-old {{valuable}} Red Holstein bull {{presented with}} a cutaneous mass on the fetlock of the right hind limb. The mass was removed and histologically diagnosed as a benign angiomatosis. Four months later, the mass reoccurred on <b>the</b> <b>same</b> leg. <b>PATHOLOGICAL</b> FINDINGS: <b>The</b> first excision biopsy consisted of numerous blood vessels of different diameters and wall thicknesses. Often, the smaller vessels were oriented around a larger, vein-like vessel. The endothelial cells were elongated with small oval to elongated nuclei with dense chromatin. Following recurrence, the mass showed clear signs of infiltrative growth, including solid bundles of cells, increased polymorphism and round to oval nuclei with coarse chromatin and distinctive nucleoli. The neoplastic cells were immunohistochemically positive for von Willebrand Factor (vWF). DIAGNOSIS: Angiomatosis with focal progression to an infiltrative growing sarcoma-like tumour. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This case represents the progression of a benign vascular proliferation, often considered as a reactive process, into a more aggressively behaving neoplasm. The clinical behaviour and histopathological morphology were strikingly similar to previous cases described in human and veterinary medicine...|$|R
30|$|In summary, {{despite an}} {{overlapping}} of frailty and depression criteria {{and the fact}} that both syndromes are associated with impairments and adverse outcomes for health, there remains a major gap in the current field of research on their relationships. In general, studies have been limited to the indication of depression prevalence among frail elderly or frailty among depressed elderly, with few initiatives seeking to ascertain the most characteristic depressive symptoms of the syndrome, as evidenced in the studies of Schuurmans et al. (2004), Puts (2006), Nascimento (2011), St. John et al. (2013) and Collard et al. (2013). Another gap concerns the comparison of depressive symptoms among elderly considered pre-frail and frail, since these represent different states on <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>pathological</b> continuum.|$|E
30|$|Technically, {{it is very}} {{difficult}} to confirm whether the tumor developed whether primarily or secondarily from another malignancy, if both tumors show <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>pathological</b> character. Unfortunately, we could not get permission for an autopsy and were compelled to make a final diagnosis from clinical evidence. But in conclusion, based on the histological verification and the degree of FDP uptake on PET, it is very likely that in our case, coincident metastases of ATC to both the small intestine and thoracic esophagus occurred. This case is unique because there were no previous reports on simultaneous metastases to these two organs from transformed ATC. Therefore, this report presents the first evidence suggesting that ATC has the potential to metastasize to any organs, including the digestive tract.|$|E

During Colonial and post-Colonial times, many European chroniclers described a parasitic disease named Maculo whose symptomatology coincides with heavy helminthiasis.

40|$|Motor neuron {{diseases}} (MNDs) are {{a rather}} heterogeneous group of diseases, with either sporadic or genetic origin or both, all {{characterized by the}} progressive degeneration of motor neurons.
