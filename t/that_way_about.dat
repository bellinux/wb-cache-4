5|$|Pam asks Jim {{to talk to}} {{her father}} and {{convince}} him to work things out with her mother. But shortly after they talk, Pam learns her father has sought a separation and will be looking for his own apartment. Pam assumes it is because of something Jim said to her father, and blames him for their breakup. Pam later confronts her father about why he left her mother while Jim looks on through the window. Pam returns to the office and tells Jim her father left because Jim told him how much he loves Pam, and he realized that he had never felt <b>that</b> <b>way</b> <b>about</b> her mother even at their best. Pam comes to terms with the separation and tearfully embraces Jim. Later, she expresses confidence that the two are true soul mates. Andy overhears her comments about her real life scenario, still thinks she is talking about the film they watched and concludes that he cannot be a movie critic because he is not as insightful as Jim and Pam.|$|E

The paper states {{more than half of}} boys as young as 6 to 8 think their ideal weight is thinner than their current size and that children with parents who are dissatisfied with their bodies are more likely to feel <b>that</b> <b>way</b> <b>about</b> their own.|$|E
25|$|Lake {{expressed}} interest in renegotiating her deal with Paramount:The studio feels <b>that</b> <b>way</b> <b>about</b> it too. They have indicated {{they are going to}} fuss more about the pictures in which I appear. I think I'll enjoy being fussed about... I want this to be the turning point and I think that it will. I am free and clear of unpleasant characters, unless they are strongly justified. I've had a varied experience playing them and also appearing as heroines. The roles themselves haven't been noteworthy and sometimes not even especially spotlighted, but I think they've all been beneficial in one way or another. From here on there should be a certain pattern of development, and that is what I am going to fight for if necessary, though I don't believe it will be because they are so understanding here at Paramount.|$|E

500|$|Harrison's {{version of}} [...] "My Sweet Lord" [...] was an {{international}} number 1 {{hit by the}} end of 1970 and through the early months of 1971 – the first solo single by a Beatle to reach the top, and the biggest seller by any of the four throughout the 1970s. Without the support of any concert appearances or promotional interviews by Harrison, the single's commercial success was due to its impact on radio, where, Harrison biographer Gary Tillery writes, the song [...] "rolled across the airwaves like a juggernaut, with commanding presence, much the way Dylan's 'Like a Rolling Stone' had arrived in the mid-sixties". Elton John recalls first hearing [...] "My Sweet Lord" [...] in a taxi and names it as the last of the era's great singles: [...] "I thought, 'Oh my God,' and I got chills. You know when a record starts on the radio, and it's great, and you think, 'Oh, what is this, what is this, what is this?' The only other record I ever felt <b>that</b> <b>way</b> <b>about</b> [...] was 'Brown Sugar'..." [...] In his 40-page Harrison tribute article for Rolling Stone in 2002, Mikal Gilmore credited [...] "My Sweet Lord" [...] as being [...] "as pervasive on radio and in youth consciousness as anything the Beatles had produced".|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} filmed {{over a number}} of afternoons at the end of 2007, with each day's filming {{beginning}} with a repeat of the last section from the previous day, to help blend each scene into the next. It was filmed with a [...] "single camera mentality" [...] but with up to five cameras running to give Brown a [...] "freedom of performance away from hitting marks or favouring one particular camera position." [...] This also helped in the case of technical problems, meaning that second takes were not necessary. Brown cried when she read the script and though she did not cry during fiming, she had expected to, planning to pause the tape recorder if she did. She stated that {{the most difficult part of}} the script was the line about Jim being [...] "here, but not here" [...] because she felt <b>that</b> <b>way</b> <b>about</b> Bardon. Arnold admitted to [...] " [...] away the tears" [...] many times and noted that several other crew cried, and that one of the toughest things about it was that it mirrored real-life events. Brown found the episode easy to film due to the fact there were no other cast members to make mistakes, and because she [...] "knew the character backwards" [...] and [...] "exactly how she'd behave and what she'd feel and [...] her history." [...] She praised Arnold and the crew, stating that the episode was [...] "lovely" [...] to make and she felt [...] "very fortunate to be given the opportunity." [...] The performance was edited in post production after being committed to tape, where usually all scenes are vision mixed, and the usual EastEnders theme tune was replaced at the end of the episode with Tony Jackson's [...] "Pretty Baby".|$|E

2500|$|When Buñuel {{somewhat}} derisively {{refused to}} acquiesce to Epstein's demand that he assist Epstein's mentor, Abel Gance, {{who was at}} the time working on the film Napoléon, Epstein dismissed him angrily, saying [...] "How can a little asshole like you dare to talk <b>that</b> <b>way</b> <b>about</b> a great director like Gance?" [...] then added [...] "You seem rather surrealist. Beware of surrealists, they are crazy people." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{early as}} high school, {{he had become}} {{interested}} first in evangelical Christianity, then Nazism, and later held memberships in both the National Socialist White People's Party and the Ku Klux Klan and even {{changed his name to}} Joseph Paul Franklin in honor of Paul Joseph Goebbels and Benjamin Franklin. In the 1960s, Franklin was inspired to try to start a race war after reading Mein Kampf. [...] "I've never felt <b>that</b> <b>way</b> <b>about</b> any other book that I read," [...] he would reflect later. [...] "It was something weird about that book." ...|$|E
2500|$|Matilda told Maud {{she refused}} to [...] "have my {{daughter}} be a darned fool and marry an actor". [...] Maud retorted, [...] "All right, mother, if you feel <b>that</b> <b>way</b> <b>about</b> it, good bye." [...] After her mother requested clarification, she said, [...] "I'm going to marry Frank, so, naturally you don't want a darned fool around the house." [...] Upon recognizing that Maud would marry Frank {{whether or not she}} supported her, Matilda laughed and acquiesced. [...] On November 9, 1882, Maud and Frank were married by W. H. Hawley, the minister of Fayetteville Baptist Church. [...] The wedding ceremony was held in the parlor of Matilda's home, which was packed with people. [...] Many relatives and friends of Matilda attended the wedding, including Maud's three sisters and women's rights activist Elizabeth Cady Stanton and her husband Henry Stanton. [...] Frank's parents, Benjamin and Cynthia, and his sisters, Hattie and Mattie, also attended the wedding. [...] The parlor was so crowded that the hired string quartet had to play upstairs. [...] The local paper praised the marriage ceremony as [...] "one of equality". [...] Whereas most marriages of the era had the bride's wedding vows include a pledge to obey her husband, the local paper said [...] "the promises required of the bride [...] precisely the same as those required of the groom". [...] The couple honeymooned in Saratoga Springs, New York, whereupon they passed Thanksgiving with their relatives.|$|E

The river does not receive any major tributaries.|$|R

6000|$|... 'It's always usual to {{read the}} will {{immediately}} after the funeral,' said Lady Le Breton, firmly, to whom the ordinary usage of society formed an absolutely unanswerable argument; 'and how you, Ronald, who haven't even the common decency to wear a bit of crape around your arm for her--a thing that Ernest himself, with all his nonsensical theories, consents to do--can talk in <b>that</b> absurd <b>way</b> <b>about</b> what's quite right and proper to be done, I for my part, really can't imagine.' ...|$|R
