5|$|<b>Tashkent</b> was {{assigned}} to the Far East Shipping Company (FESCO), but sailed with the Pacific Fleet of the Soviet Navy throughout the war. <b>Tashkent</b> was photographed at San Francisco {{at some point during the}} war, but most of her other movements are not known. However, in August 1945, <b>Tashkent</b> delivered troops and cargo in support of the Soviet invasions of Japanese-held Manchuria, Korea, Sakhalin, and the Kurile Islands. After the war's end, <b>Tashkent</b> returned to merchant operation with FESCO through 1966, when she was transferred to North Korea for use as a fish processing facility. The former <b>Tashkent</b> was scrapped in 1969.|$|E
5|$|After Reed's death, Bryant {{obtained}} Lenin's {{approval for}} a trip to the southern Russian border and neighboring countries.

He {{attended}} an arts college in <b>Tashkent.</b> After getting his degree Askarov worked as a painter and decorator for 15 years. In the early 1990s, he began writing about human rights issues in a local newspaper. He is married to Hadicha Askarova and they have three children.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{existing}} airstrip at Turatam near the cosmodrome was small, {{the dogs and}} crew had to be first flown aboard a Tu-104 plane to <b>Tashkent.</b> From there, a smaller and lighter Il-14 plane took them to Turatam. Training of dogs continued upon arrival; one after another they {{were placed in the}} capsules to get familiar with the feeding system.|$|E
5|$|From Almaty in Kazakhstan, {{the railway}} extends to <b>Tashkent</b> and Samarkand, Uzbekistan {{and then to}} Tejen, Turkmenistan. From Tejen, another line {{continues}} to Ashgabat, the capital of Turkmenistan. After Ashgabat, the line ends at Türkmenbaşy, Turkmenistan, a port on the Caspian Sea. (After a direct rail link between Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan opened, it became possible for the freight to bypass Uzbekistan, which has poor relations with its neighbors).|$|E
5|$|Her {{childhood}} was spent at her father's homes, including Pavlovsk Palace and estates in the Crimea. Her {{father was a}} younger brother of Alexander II, and her mother {{was considered one of}} the most intelligent and elegant women of the court. Olga was particularly close to her older brother, Nicholas, and was one of the few members of the imperial family to keep in touch with him after he was banished to <b>Tashkent.</b>|$|E
5|$|SS Iowan was a {{cargo ship}} built in 1914 for the American-Hawaiian Steamship Company. During World War I {{she was taken}} over by the United States Navy and {{commissioned}} as USS Iowan (ID-3002).

5|$|P. d. bactrianus Zarudny and Kudashev, 1916, {{described}} from <b>Tashkent,</b> {{is found}} in southern Kazakhstan to the Tian Shan and northern Iran and Afghanistan. It intergrades with persicus in Baluchistan and with indicus across central Afghanistan. Unlike most other house sparrow subspecies, it is almost entirely migratory, wintering in the plains of the northern Indian subcontinent. It {{is found in}} open country rather than in settlements, which are occupied by the Eurasian tree sparrow in its range. There is an exceptional record from Sudan.|$|E
5|$|According to the Old Book of Tang, Tong Yabghu's reign {{was once}} {{considered}} as {{the golden age}} of Western Göktürk Khaganate:Tong Yehu Kaghan is a man of bravery and astuteness. He is good at art of war. Thus he controlled Tiele tribes to the north, confronted Persia to the west, connected with Kasmira (nowadays Kashmir) to the south. All countries are subjected to him. He controlled ten thousands of men with arrow and bow, establishing his power over the western region. He occupied the land of Wusun and moved his tent to Qianquan north of <b>Tashkent.</b> All of the princes of western region assumed the Turk office of Jielifa. Tong Yehu Kaghan also sent a Tutun to monitor them for imposition. The power of Western Turks had never reached such a state before".|$|E
5|$|According to {{the report}} of Amr ibn Musa, relayed by al-Tabari, Asad gave command of his battle line to al-Qasim ibn Bukhayt al-Muraghi. The latter placed the Azdi and Tamimi tribal contingents, {{as well as the}} ruler of Juzjan and his {{personal}} guard (shakiriyya) and the contingents of the Syrian districts of Filastin (under Mus'ab ibn Amr al-Khuza'i) and Qinnasrin (under Maghra ibn Ahmar al-Numayri) on the right, while the left was held by the Rabi'ah tribe (under Yahya ibn Hudayn) and the contingent of the districts of Homs (under Ja'far ibn Hanzalah al-Bahrani) and Jordan (under Sulayman ibn Amr al-Muqri). Mansur al-Bajali commanded the vanguard as before, reinforced by the troops of the district of Damascus (under Hamlah ibn Nu'aym al-Kalbi) and the personal retinue of Asad. The khagan, who had only 4,000 of his men with him, placed Ibn Surayj and his followers on the right, while the rest of his force consisted not only of his Turgesh but also of contingents from the princes of Transoxiana—al-Tabari implies they were there in person, but this is unlikely—including the rulers of Sughd, Shash (<b>Tashkent),</b> Usrushana, Khuttal, and the Jabghu of Tokharistan.|$|E
5|$|Later in 1969, Chinese forces {{started the}} Sino–Soviet border conflict. The Sino–Soviet split had chagrined Premier Alexei Kosygin a great deal, {{and for a}} while he refused to accept its irrevocability; he briefly visited Beijing in 1969 due to the {{increase}} of tension between the USSR and China. By the early 1980s, both the Chinese and the Soviets were issuing statements calling for a normalisation of relations between the two states. The conditions given to the Soviets by the Chinese were the reduction of Soviet military presence in the Sino–Soviet border and the withdrawal of Soviets troops in Afghanistan and the Mongolian People's Republic and to end their support for the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia. Brezhnev responded in his March 1982 speech in <b>Tashkent</b> where he called for the normalisation of relations. Full Sino–Soviet normalisations of relations would prove to take years, until the last Soviet ruler, Mikhail Gorbachev came to power.|$|E
5|$|Nothing {{is known}} of Harith's {{activities}} {{during the next two}} years, but he evidently remained in northern Transoxiana, based at al-Shash (<b>Tashkent)</b> and in close contact with the Turgesh. In 740 or 741, after having consolidated his authority in Khurasan and carried out tax reforms that eased the social unrest, Nasr ibn Sayyar advanced into the middle Jaxartes valley, making for Shash. His campaign was part of Nasr's efforts to re-establish Arab control over Transoxiana, but, according to H.A.R. Gibb and Kister, the main objective was the expulsion of Harith from Shash, who might still unite the Turgesh and the native princes against the Arabs. In the event, Nasr was prevented from crossing the Jaxartes by an army composed of Turgesh, troops from Shash and Harith's followers, and was forced to withdraw after a negotiated settlement, which among other terms stipulated the removal of Harith and his adherents to the remote town of Farab.|$|E
5|$|Streltsov {{was dropped}} from the Soviet team {{for the first three}} {{national}} team matches of 1968. After featuring in a home friendly win over Belgium in April, he made his final appearance for the USSR in the 2–0 1968 European Championship quarter-final first leg loss to Hungary on 4 May 1968. The Soviets beat Hungary 3–0 in Moscow a week later, without Streltsov, to qualify for the final tournament on aggregate. Streltsov was left out of the tournament squad, and never played for the USSR again; after his final appearance, his international tally stood at 25 goals in 38 matches. Torpedo won the Soviet Cup during the 1968 season, overcoming Uzbek side Pakhtakor <b>Tashkent</b> 1–0 in the final. Streltsov retained his title of Soviet Footballer of the Year after scoring the highest seasonal total of his career, 21 (in the league), but was moved back to midfield before the 1969 season and did not score in 23 league matches during his final two years. He retired from football in 1970, at the age of 33, leaving his final league record for Torpedo over both spells standing at 99 goals from 222 games.|$|E
5|$|There were {{plans to}} {{establish}} mass ("serial") {{production of the}} model at the Kiev Aircraft Production Plant (later renamed as Antonov Serial Production Plant), which was associated with but separate from the Antonov Design Bureau, and at the Samara Aircraft Production Plant (later reorganised as Aviakor) in Samara, Russia. At one stage during early development, Russia was showing reluctance at supporting {{the development of the}} An-70, and so Uzbekistan sought, unsuccessfully, to establish a final assembly plant in the capital at the <b>Tashkent</b> Aircraft Production Plant, where the production of the An-70's wings and the Il-76 were taking place. Construction of the first prototype had started in Kiev in 1991. The maiden flight of the aircraft had originally been scheduled for late 1992. However, due to financing and design issues, this was pushed back until 1994. In particular, the weakened national currency diminished the firm's ability to pay for the aircraft's components, especially those sourced from Russia, and workers' salaries. In addition, engineers discovered numerous design and manufacturing deficiencies during the final ground checks, the majority of which were non-critical yet necessitated lengthy corrections. In the end, the aircraft made its maiden flight on 16 December 1994.|$|E
5|$|In the 1995–96 season, Al-Talaba {{finished}} in sixth place with 31 points, having won eight matches, drawn seven and lost seven. They reached {{the final of}} the 1995 Umm Al-Ma'arik Cup, coming up against Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya for the fourth time in a row in this competition, and Al-Talaba won with a single goal scored by Abdul-Wahab Abu Al-Hail, achieving their third Umm Al-Ma'arik Cup success. After Al-Zawra'a achieved a double in the 1993–94 season, the Iraq FA chose the FA Cup runners-up, Al-Talaba, as Iraq's representative in the 1995 Asian Cup Winners' Cup. Under the management of Ayoub Odisho, they defeated Al-Gharafa in the first leg in Doha 5–3 and lost in the second leg 1–0 at the Al-Shaab Stadium. In the second round, they came up against Yangiyer and lost 2–1 in <b>Tashkent</b> before they turned it around to win 2–0 in Baghdad with goals from Muhannad Mohammed and Qahtan Chathir. In the quarter-finals, Al-Talaba won their first leg against Bahman in Tehran 1–0 with a goal by Sabah Jeayer. At the Al-Shaab Stadium, Bahman won 1–0 for a 1–1 draw on aggregate. The match went to a golden goal decider which was scored by Chathir. Al-Talaba had now qualified for the semi-finals where they were drawn to meet Kazma SC of Kuwait but Kazma withdrew from the tournament, refusing to play against Al-Talaba because of political tensions between Iraq and other Persian Gulf countries, including Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, {{in the aftermath of the}} 1991 Gulf War. The AFC directed Al-Talaba to play against Al-Riyadh of Saudi-Arabia but they too withdrew for the same reason, and that meant Al-Talaba had a walkover through the semi-finals. In the final, Al-Talaba faced Bellmare Hiratsuka in Kanagawa where they were beaten 2–1 after the winning goal was scored in the 81st minute by Hidetoshi Nakata.|$|E
25|$|During {{the unrest}} {{security}} forces {{under the authority}} of the Ministry of Defense acted as police forces. Ministry of Interior troops were abolished and counter-terrorism divisions were put under the command of the Ministry of Defense or the National Security Service (SNB), run by the <b>Tashkent</b> clan. Karimov fired Defense Minister Kadyr Gulyamov, Interior Minister Almatov, Head of the Joint Headquarters of the Armed Forces Ismail Ergashev, and Commander of the Eastern military district Kosimali Akhmedov. Karimov replaced Almatov with the deputy director of the SNB, a member of the <b>Tashkent</b> clan. This greatly shifted control of security to the <b>Tashkent</b> clan which has traditionally controlled the SNB. Analysts had previously suggested that the Interior Ministry, under Almatov's leadership, had organized the 1999 <b>Tashkent</b> bombings. Others have suggested the bombings were done by the SNB under the leadership of Rustam Inoyatov, who at the time led the <b>Tashkent</b> clan. Analysts suggested a series of bombings in 2004 in <b>Tashkent</b> and Bukhara may have been done by the SNB against the Interior Ministry.|$|E
25|$|The Madras anti-Hindi {{agitation}} of 1965 {{occurred during}} Shastri's tenure. On 11 January 1966, {{a day after}} signing the <b>Tashkent</b> Declaration, Shastri died in <b>Tashkent,</b> reportedly of a heart attack; but {{the circumstances of his}} death remain mysterious.|$|E

25|$|Another {{important}} feature of Uzbekistan's physical environment is the significant seismic activity that dominates much of the country. Indeed, much of Uzbekistan's capital city, <b>Tashkent,</b> was destroyed in a major earthquake in 1966, and other earthquakes have caused significant damage before and since the <b>Tashkent</b> disaster. The mountain areas are especially prone to earthquakes.|$|E
25|$|Shastri's {{sudden death}} {{immediately}} after signing the <b>Tashkent</b> Pact with Pakistan raised many {{questions in the}} minds of Indian citizens. The Prime Minister of India going to <b>Tashkent</b> for a pact and never coming back has not been accepted easily by Indian citizens. His health was fit according to his doctor, R. N. Chugh, and he had no sign of heart trouble before.|$|E
25|$|In June, after Li's {{world ranking}} {{had risen to}} No. 136 on the {{strength}} of her ITF performances alone, she gained direct entry into her first WTA Tour event at <b>Tashkent.</b> Despite winning the first set, Li lost her first WTA singles match to Anna Zaporozhanova in three sets, but she captured the women's doubles title at <b>Tashkent</b> with Li Ting against Zaporozhanova and Iroda Tulyaganova.|$|E
25|$|The United States and the Soviet Union used {{significant}} diplomatic {{tools to}} prevent any further escalation in {{the conflict between the}} two South Asian nations. The Soviet Union, led by Premier Alexei Kosygin, hosted ceasefire negotiations in <b>Tashkent</b> (now in Uzbekistan), where Indian Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri and Pakistani President Ayub Khan signed the <b>Tashkent</b> Agreement, agreeing to withdraw to pre-August lines no later than 25 February 1966.|$|E

25|$|After {{the fall}} of <b>Tashkent</b> to General Cherniaev in 1865, Khodjend, Djizak, and Samarkand fell to the Russians in quick {{succession}} {{over the next three}} years as the Khanate of Kokand and the Emirate of Bukhara were repeatedly defeated. In 1867 the Governor-Generalship of Russian Turkestan was established under General Konstantin Petrovich Von Kaufman, with its headquarters at <b>Tashkent.</b> In 1881–85 the Transcaspian region was annexed in the course of a campaign led by Generals Mikhail Annenkov and Mikhail Skobelev, and Ashkhabad (from Persia), Merv and Pendjeh (from Afghanistan) all came under Russian control.|$|E

25|$|Because of the American Civil War, cotton shot up {{in price}} in the 1860s, {{becoming}} an increasingly important commodity in the region, although its cultivation was on a much lesser scale than during the Soviet period. The cotton trade led to improvements: the Transcaspian Railway from Krasnovodsk to Samarkand and <b>Tashkent,</b> and the Trans-Aral Railway from Orenburg to <b>Tashkent</b> were constructed. In the long term {{the development of a}} cotton monoculture would render Turkestan dependent on food imports from Western Siberia, and the Turkestan-Siberia Railway was already planned when the First World War broke out.|$|E
