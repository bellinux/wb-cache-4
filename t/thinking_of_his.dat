5|$|The {{death of}} Ladislaus' brother-in-law, King Zvonimir of Croatia, in 1089 or 1090 created an {{opportunity}} for him to claim Croatia for himself. Ladislaus' sister, Helena, and several noblemen (mainly from northern Croatia) supported Ladislaus' claim. His troops occupied the lowlands, but a native claimant, Petar Svačić, resisted in the Petrova Mounts. Nevertheless, Croatia and Hungary remained closely connected for more than nine centuries. LadislausI appointed his nephew, Álmos, to administer Croatia. Although a younger son, Álmos was also favored against his brother, Coloman, when the king was <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> succession. Even so, Coloman succeeded his uncle in 1095, while Álmos received a separate duchy under his brother's suzerainty. Throughout Coloman's reign, the brothers' relationship remained tense, which finally led to the blinding of Álmos and his infant son.|$|E

25|$|Sonnet 29 {{is one of}} 154 sonnets {{written by}} the English playwright and poet William Shakespeare. It {{is part of the}} Fair Youth {{sequence}} (which comprises sonnets 1-126 in the accepted numbering stemming from the first edition in 1609). In the sonnet, the speaker bemoans his status as an outcast and failure but feels better upon <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> beloved. Sonnet 29 is written in the typical Shakespearean sonnet form, having 14 lines of iambic pentameter ending in a rhymed couplet.|$|E

[...] However, the only thing Marco has seen on his walk is a horse pulling a wagon on Mulberry Street. To make his story more interesting, Marco imagines {{progressively}} more elaborate scenes based around the horse and wagon. He imagines the horse is first a zebra, then a reindeer, then an elephant, and finally an elephant helped by two giraffes. The wagon changes to a chariot, then a sled, then a cart holding a brass band.|$|E
500|$|On May 29, 2015, Senator Mark Kirk, Republican of Illinois, {{who served}} in the House {{throughout}} Hastert's tenure as speaker, released a statement reading: [...] "Anyone who knows Denny is shocked and confused by the recent news. The former speaker should be afforded, like any other American, his day in court to address these very serious accusations. This is a very troubling development that we must learn more about, but I am <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> family during this difficult time." [...] On June 4, 2015, Kirk announced that he would donate to charity a $10,000 contribution made to Kirk's 2010 Senate campaign by Hastert's Keep our Mission PAC. Kirk's announcement was made following the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC)'s call upon the senator to [...] "return or donate Denny Hastert's money immediately." [...] The DSCC also called upon Republican Senators John Boozman of Arkansas and Roy Blunt of Missouri (who received $11,000 and $5,000, respectively, from Hastert's PAC in recent years) to return or donate the funds.|$|E

Bieber's love interest is removed by her father, who reprimands, [...] "You {{will never see}} him again. You understand that?" [...] Brown is <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> girlfriend (played by Shannon Elizabeth) before the apocalypse occurs, which is characterized by land fissures, buildings toppling down and fiery scenery. Brown searches for his love interest who is then hit by the car that Bieber's girlfriend is in. Brown saves her by leaping over the fissure. Near {{the end of the}} video, Bieber's girlfriend finds him on top of the roof of a building and it ends with them reuniting and kissing. Interspersed are scenes of Brown and Bieber dancing amongst the destruction. Jamie Peck of MTV wrote of the video, [...] "The whole thing is delightfully ridiculous in its cinematic drama". The video was nominated for International Artist Video of the Year at the 2012 MuchMusic Video Awards.|$|E

500|$|However, Morris was {{regarded}} as the [...] "bunny" [...] of English medium pace bowler Alec Bedser, who dismissed him 20 times in first-class cricket, including 18 times in Test matches. Bedser dismissed Morris {{more than any other}} bowler. Typically, Bedser took Morris' wicket with deliveries pitched on leg stump that moved across him. This perceived dominance is not borne out by statistics; Morris' average was 57.42 in the 37 Test innings in which he faced Bedser, and more than sixty in the 46 first-class innings when the two met. In their last meeting at Test level in 1954–55, Morris scored 153. The pair were very close friends, and Bedser frequently made the point of rebutting criticism of Morris' performance against him. Bedser noted Morris' gracious demeanour despite his struggles, recalling an incident during the 1950–51 season when Morris reached his century during a tour match against the English. Instead of <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> difficulties against Bedser, Morris commented on the plight of his English opponents who had suffered harder times. Morris stated that [...] "Bob Berry hasn't got a wicket and John Warr hasn't taken a catch all tour so I'll see what can be done." [...] Morris was then caught by Warr from Berry's bowling without adding to his score.|$|E
500|$|Some reviewers {{cited the}} legacy {{aspects of the}} film for Scorsese and {{compared}} Scorsese to such established directors as Ingmar Bergman. Ty Burr of The Boston Globe said, [...] "The movie's being promoted as the third in the director's unofficial trilogy of faith, after The Last Temptation of Christ (1988) and Kundun (1997), and {{it feels like a}} self-conscious masterpiece, a summing-up from a filmmaker who, at 74, may be <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> legacy." [...] Joshua Rothkopf of Time Out London gave the film five stars out of five, saying, [...] "Scorsese has hit the rare heights of filmmakers like Ingmar Bergman and Carl Theodor Dreyer, artists who find in religion a battleground that leaves even the strongest in tatters, compromised and broken." [...] Emma Green of The Atlantic gave the film high praise, stating, [...] "This is what makes Scorsese's film so radical and so unlike many movies about religion: It's actually art." [...] Robbie Collin of The Telegraph gave the film five stars out of five, stating, [...] "Scorsese's brutal spiritual epic will scald, and succor, your soul." [...] Collin further added, [...] "It's the kind of work a great filmmaker can only pull off with a lifetime's accrued expertise behind him". Brian Truitt of USA Today gave the film 3 stars and a half out of four, stating, [...] "With the religious historical drama Silence, Martin Scorsese proves he’s as masterful a filmmaker with men of God as he is with gangsters." [...] Truitt also argued that the film [...] "marks one of the deeper and most thoughtful projects in Scorsese’s career." ...|$|E

He also called a meeting between the {{different}} consuls in Bangkok to put before them his plan of reconciliation between the two 'Kings'.

Werth spent the war unobtrusively in Saint-Amour, his village in the Jura, a mountainous region near Switzerland where he was [...] "alone, cold and hungry", a place that had few polite words for French refugees.

2500|$|Money plays a {{key role}} in the {{marriage}} market, not only for the young ladies seeking a well-off husband, but also for men who wish to marry a woman of means. Two examples are George Wickham, who tried to elope with Georgiana Darcy, and Colonel Fitzwilliam. Marrying a woman of a rich family also ensured a linkage to a high family, as is visible in the desires of Bingley's sisters to have their brother married to Georgiana Darcy. Mrs. Bennet is frequently seen encouraging her daughters to marry a wealthy man of high social class. In chapter 1, when Mr. Bingley arrives, she declares [...] "I am <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> marrying one of them." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following the unrivaled work of Fr. Athanase Sage (1896–1971), who {{analyzed}} Fr. d’Alzon’s writings comprehensively {{and edited}} the Écrits spirituels, {{a compendium of}} the basic writings of the founder, the second interpretation has the immense advantage of focusing on {{the thought of the}} founder and using themes constitutive of his <b>thinking,</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> spiritual life, and his apostolic [...] work: Kingdom, Mystical Incarnation, Christocentrism, the Augustinian tradition, and the influence of the French school of spirituality (Bérulle, Bossuet, Olier, etc.), which d’Alzon shared with Mother Marie Eugénie. The superiority of Fr. Sage’s analysis comes from his work on Fr. d’Alzon’s thought. He “explains” the Assumption from d’Alzon himself and shows the profoundly Christocentric doctrine of the founder.|$|E
2500|$|Savage, Kehoe and Breen were {{interrupted}} by a RIC officer as they pushed a hay-cart halfway across the road blocking the path of French's car. He was dragged off the road after one of them lobbed a grenade at him, which did not go off but knocked him unconscious. When the convoy appeared minutes later, the IRA concentrated their attack on the second car {{on the basis of}} incorrect intelligence: French was actually in the first car. In the ensuing crossfire Breen was shot in the leg, and Savage was killed by a bullet in the neck. French's own bodyguard was wounded, and he was saved in part by the quick <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> driver. [...] A grenade, which would almost certainly have killed him, exploded {{in the back seat of}} the second car.|$|E

The group return to Europe where Holly deposits a mind-wiped Artemis Fowl I on the steps of a hospital in Helsinki.

2500|$|In the work, Smith {{critically}} {{examines the}} moral <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> time, {{and suggests that}} conscience arises from dynamic and interactive social relationships through which people seek [...] "mutual sympathy of sentiments." [...] His goal in writing the work was to explain the source of mankind's ability to form moral judgement, given that people begin life with no moral sentiments at all. Smith proposes a theory of sympathy, in which the act of observing others and seeing the judgements they form of both others and oneself makes people aware of themselves and how others perceive their behaviour. The feedback we receive from perceiving (or imagining) others' judgements creates an incentive to achieve [...] "mutual sympathy of sentiments" [...] with them and leads people to develop habits, and then principles, of behaviour, which come to constitute one's conscience.|$|E
2500|$|Whereas Junkie and Queer were {{conventional}} in style, Naked Lunch was {{his first}} venture into a nonlinear style. After the publication of Naked Lunch, a book whose creation was {{to a certain extent}} the result of a series of contingencies, Burroughs was exposed to Brion Gysin's cut-up technique at the Beat Hotel in Paris in October 1959. He began slicing up phrases and words to create new sentences. At the Beat Hotel Burroughs discovered [...] "a port of entry" [...] into Gysin's canvases: [...] "I don't think I had ever seen painting until I saw the painting of Brion Gysin." [...] The two would cultivate a long-term friendship that revolved around a mutual interest in artworks and cut-up techniques. Scenes were slid together with little care for narrative. Perhaps <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> crazed physician, Dr. Benway, he described Naked Lunch as a book that could be cut into at any point. Although not considered science fiction, the book does seem to forecast AIDS, liposuction, and the crack pandemic.|$|E
