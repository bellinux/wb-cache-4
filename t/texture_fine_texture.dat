Different methods have been applied, including statistical-, model-, and transform-based methods [5 – 12]. Statistical-based techniques have been most commonly applied and describe the distribution and relationships of gray-level values in the image. Three orders of parameters are described in statistical-based texture analysis. First-order statistics relate to gray-level frequency distribution within the region of interest, which can be obtained from the histogram of pixel intensities [13]. It is dependent on a single pixel value rather than its interaction with neighboring pixels. First-order statistics, based on histogram analysis, include mean intensity, maximum intensity, minimum intensity, uniformity (uniformity of gray-level distribution), entropy (irregularity of gray-level distribution), standard deviation of the gray-level histogram distribution, skewness (asymmetry of the histogram), and kurtosis (flatness of the histogram) (Appendix). Second-order statistics are co-occurrence measurements calculated using spatial gray-level dependence matrices. These matrices determine how often a pixel of intensity i finds itself within a certain relationship to another pixel of intensity j. Second-order statistics based on a co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) include entropy (randomness of the matrix), energy/angular second moment (pixel repetition/orderliness and measures the homogeneity of an image), homogeneity (uniformity of co-occurrence matrix), dissimilarity (measurement of how different each element in the matrix is), and correlation (measurement of gray-tone linear dependencies). Another method to derive second-order statistics is the run-length matrix (RLM), which analyzes texture in a specific direction. A run is a length of consecutive pixels with the same gray-level intensity in a preset direction. The relationships between the run lengths give rise to <b>texture.</b> <b>Fine</b> <b>texture</b> has more short runs with similar gray-level intensities, whereas coarse texture has more long runs with different gray-level intensities. Some of the RLM parameters include short-run emphasis (SRE; measures distribution of short runs in an image), long-run emphasis (LRE), gray-level non-uniformity (GLNU; measures similarity of gray-level values; GLNU is small if variation is less), and run length non-uniformity (RLNU; measures the similarity of run lengths; RLN is small if run lengths are similar). Higher-order statistics are calculated using neighborhood gray-tone-difference matrices, which examine the spatial relationship among three or more pixels and are thought to closely resemble the human experience of the image [14, 15]. This is calculated using the neighborhood gray-tone-difference matrix (NGTDM). Examples of higher-order statistics include contrast (number of local variations within the image), coarseness (measurement of edge density), and busyness (measurement of spatial rate of gray-level change). The application of filters such as Laplacian of Gaussian bandpass filters in statistical-based texture analysis of an image allows the extraction of specific structures corresponding to the width of the filters. Lower filter values (filter 0.5 - 1.0) will highlight structures with fine textures, and higher filter values highlight structures with medium (filter 1.5 - 2.0) and coarse (filter 2.5) textures in the filtered image.|$|E

Here, the visual perception of texture, selected studies of texture analysis in machine vision, and diverse small samples of contour and texture are all used to provide insights into the fundamental characteristics of contour and texture. From these, an experimental discrimination scheme is developed and tested on a battery of natural images. The visual perception of <b>texture</b> defined <b>fine</b> <b>texture</b> as a subclass which is interpreted as shading and is distinct from coarse figural similarity textures. Also, perception defined the smallest scale for contour/texture discrimination as eight to nine visual acuity units.

40|$|Tactile {{roughness}} magnitude estimates {{increase with}} contact force. However, {{it is not}} known whether discrimination thresholds are affected by contact force and other parameters, such as duration and tangential movement. The effects of these factors on roughness discrimination thresholds were determined using an adaptive staircase procedure for coarse and <b>fine</b> <b>texture</b> discrimination during active touch. The presence of tangential movement (dynamic touch) significantly reduced thresholds in coarse and <b>fine</b> <b>texture</b> discrimination compared to static touch, with effects more marked with <b>fine</b> <b>textures.</b> Contact force did not affect discrimination except in static touch of coarse texture when the threshold was significantly higher with low force. Within the perspective that texture discrimination involves distinct vibratory and spatial mechanisms, the results suggest that spatial-dependent texture discrimination deteriorates when contact force is reduced whereas vibration-dependent texture discrimination is unaffected by contact force. Texture discrimination was independent of contact duration in the range 1. 36 s to 3. 46 s, suggesting that tactile integration processes are completed relatively quickly...|$|R

40|$|The present {{thesis is}} based on three studies that {{research}} different aspects of <b>fine</b> <b>texture</b> perception. The goal is {{to better understand the}} mechanisms involved in haptic perception of textures below 200 µm, also known as microtextures. Study I was conducted to establish a friction measurement model and relating the friction measurements to perceived coarseness of <b>fine</b> <b>textures.</b> A set of printing papers was used as stimulus material. In Study II an expanded set, including the set of Study I, was used as stimuli in a multidimensional scaling (MDS) experiment of haptic <b>fine</b> <b>texture</b> perception. Through scaling of perceptual attributes and similarities, a three dimensional space was found to best describe the data and the dimensions were interpreted as rough-smooth, thick-thin and distinct-indistinct. In Study III a series of model surfaces were manufactured with a systematically varied sinusoidal pattern, spanning from 300 nm to 80 µm. As in Study II, a similarity experiment was conducted and a two dimensional space was chosen, the dimensions of which were explained well through friction and the wavelength. Together these three studies form a better picture of <b>fine</b> <b>texture</b> perception. The dimensionality found with paper stimuli was very similar to the corresponding spaces for marcrotextures of everyday materials, even though a different perceptual system is used for <b>fine</b> <b>texture</b> perception. Regardless if the information is coded through the spatial or the vibratory sense, the perception does not seem to differ in dimensionality. Further, the largest among the microtextures seem to have been perceived as carrying spatial information. On the systematically varied, rigid, textures, the MDS space did not come out in a similar fashion to those of everyday materials but instead similar to the physical properties that characterizes the change in the textures. It was further found that the participants in Study III successfully discriminated textures with an amplitude of 13 nm from the unwrinkled surfaces. From these studies the main conclusions are (a) haptically measured friction and surface roughness are important contributors to <b>fine</b> <b>texture</b> perception, (b) even at microscales, spatial information is retrieved haptically, probably through vibrations, and (c) persons can haptically discriminate textures at a nanoscale...|$|R

30|$|Take {{any point}} (x, y) {{in the image}} (N[*]×[*]N) and another point (x[*]+[*]a, y[*]+[*]b) that {{deviates}} from it and set the gray value of the point pair to (g 1, g 2). Point (x, y) moves on the whole picture, then a variety of (g 1, g 2) values are obtained. The series of gray values is k, and the combination of (g 1, g 2) has a square of K. For the whole picture, {{count the number of}} occurrences of each (g 1, g 2) value and arrange them into a square matrix, and then, the total number of (g 1, g 2) appears to be normalized to the occurrence probability P (g 1, g 2), which is called the GLCM. The distance difference values (a, b) can be combined with different values to obtain a joint probability matrix under different conditions. The values of (a, b) are selected according to the characteristics of the periodic distribution of the <b>texture.</b> For <b>finer</b> <b>textures,</b> small difference values, such as (1, 0), (1, 1), and (2, 0) are selected. When a[*]=[*] 1, b[*]=[*] 0, the pixel pair is horizontal, that is 0 ° scanning. When a[*]=[*] 0, b[*]=[*] 1, the pixel pair is vertical, that is 90 ° scanning. When a[*]=[*] 1, b[*]=[*] 1, the pixel pair is right diagonal, that is 45 ° scanning. When a[*]=[*]−[*] 1, b[*]=[*] 1, the pixel pair is left diagonal, that is 135 ° scanning. In this way, the probability of simultaneous occurrence of two pixel gray-level converts the spatial coordinates of (x, y) to the description of “gray pair” (g 1, g 2), forming a GLCM.|$|R

30|$|Drainage texture is {{the product}} of Dd and Sf and is a measure of {{relative}} channel spacing in a fluvial-dissected terrain, which is influenced by climate, rainfall, vegetation, lithology, soil type, infiltration capacity and stage of development (Smith 1950). Vegetation cover, its density and types also {{plays an important role in}} determining the drainage texture (Kale and Gupta 2001). The soft or weak rocks unprotected by vegetation produce a <b>fine</b> <b>texture,</b> whereas massive and resistant rocks cause coarse texture. Sparse vegetation of arid climate causes <b>finer</b> <b>textures</b> than those developed on similar rocks in a humid climate. The texture of a rock is commonly dependent upon vegetation type and climate (Dornkamp and King 1971). Drainage lines are numerous over impermeable areas than permeable areas. Horton (1945) recognized infiltration capacity as the single important factor which influences drainage texture and considered drainage texture which includes drainage density and stream frequency. Dt is categorized into five different classes based on Dd values viz; very course (< 2), course (2 – 4), moderate (4 – 6), fine (6 – 8) and very fine (> 8). The CW shows very <b>fine</b> <b>texture,</b> SW 1, 8 and 9 shows course texture while rest of the SW show moderate texture.|$|R
