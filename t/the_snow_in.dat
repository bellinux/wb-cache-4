However, Bart drinks 12 glasses of water to wake up early and secretly unwraps his gifts, one of which is a remote-controlled fire truck. Bart plays with it until it sprays water on an overloaded electrical socket, causing a fire that engulfs and melts the plastic Christmas tree and all of the presents beneath it.

Homer's insanity gradually decreases and the family freezes in the snow as they are watching.|$|E
5|$|Cores {{are often}} drilled {{in areas such}} as Antarctica and central Greenland where the {{temperature}} is almost never warm enough to cause melting, but the summer sun can still alter <b>the</b> <b>snow.</b> <b>In</b> polar areas, the sun is visible day and night during the local summer and invisible all winter. It can make some snow sublimate, leaving the top inch or so less dense. When the sun approaches its lowest point in the sky, the temperature drops and hoar frost forms on the top layer. Buried under the snow of following years, the coarse-grained hoar frost compresses into lighter layers than the winter snow. As a result, alternating bands of lighter and darker ice can be seen in an ice core.|$|E

25|$|The southwestern United States {{features}} a semi-arid to arid climate, {{depending on the}} location. Much of the Southwest is an arid desert climate, but higher elevations in the mountains in each state, {{with the exception of}} West Texas, feature alpine climates with very large amounts of snow. The metropolitan areas of Phoenix, Tucson, Las Vegas, and El Paso hardly ever receive any snow at all, as they are strictly desert lands with mountains. Albuquerque receives less snow than other cities, but still receives significant snowfalls in the winter time. Although it snows in this region, <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> <b>in</b> this part of the United States melts rapidly, often before nightfall. This is due mainly to the higher altitude and abundant sunshine in these states.|$|E
25|$|Ibn Battuta {{recorded}} {{that while}} in Bulghar {{he wanted to}} travel further north into the land of darkness. The land is snow-covered throughout (northern Siberia) and {{the only means of}} transport is dog-drawn sled. There lived a mysterious people who were reluctant to show themselves.

Southern merchants brought various goods and placed them in an open area on <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> <b>in</b> the night, then returned to their tents. Next morning they came to the place again and found their merchandise taken by the mysterious people, but in exchange they found fur-skins which could be used for making valuable coats, jackets, and other winter garments. The trade is done between merchants and the mysterious people without seeing each other. As Ibn Battuta was not a merchant and saw no benefit of going there he abandoned the travel to this land of darkness.|$|E
40|$|Based on MODIS data, we {{analyzed}} the spatial distribution and the intra- and inter-annual variations of <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> cover <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Qilian Mountains.

25|$|Broadcast 2 December 1993, this {{instalment}} {{looks at}} the summer, when almost all life in the region breeds. A South Georgian colony of fur seals is shown: the pups grow fast on the rich, fatty milk provided by their mothers and double their weight in just sixty days. As the females become sexually available, the mating season begins — males try to claim territory and mate with females. Chinstrap penguins form large groups on Deception Island, climbing up its steep slopes to find mountain ridges free of snow. Returning birds find their partners by recognising their voice (performing a brief greeting ritual when they find them), {{which is why the}} colonies are very noisy during the breeding season. Males and females take turns in catching food, some of which they later regurgitate for their chicks. The summer also thaws some of the ice on the continent's shores. The fresh water allows moss and other plants to grow, which in turn provide food for mites that are adapted to the cold climate — they can survive temperatures up to minus 30°C because they contain a kind of antifreeze. They become active as soon as the ice melts, and reproduce whenever they get an opportunity to do so. Lichens grow even further south than moss, and algae populate some of <b>the</b> <b>snow.</b> <b>In</b> the ocean, life is much more diverse, and blue-eyed shags dive for fish near the peninsula. More than 300,000 petrels come to breed to the Scullin Monolith, one of the few areas of open rock.|$|E

500|$|South Park animators {{created the}} episode using PowerAnimator, the Alias Systems Corporation {{animation}} program most {{commonly known as}} [...] "Alias".

500|$|As {{the turnpike}} {{did not use}} any state tax revenue for maintenance, the {{pavement}} began to deteriorate rapidly, and crews faced difficulty keeping up with <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> <b>in</b> winter conditions in a winter storm during 1960. In the early 1960s, many senior positions in the Kansas Turnpike Authority were cut, and thanks to this and other austerity measures such as targeting maintenance to save costs in the future, the turnpike slowly became profitable. By 1966, {{it was clear that}} the turnpike had not been built to the higher standards of the Interstate Highway system; the roadway had developed ruts and other issues due to deferred maintenance. To temporarily fix the problem, a layer of asphalt oil and a layer of sand and asphalt was used to fill in the ruts, and graded rock coated with asphalt was used to seal the road. Since the road had been originally constructed at the same time, and not built in segments over a period of time, similar maintenance issues appeared along the whole length of the road at the same time. Bridges and pavement were repaired on a rotating basis, to stagger the cost of needed repairs. [...] The bridge over the Kansas River was widened and replaced after 1973. As economic conditions improved for the Authority, equipment was slowly replaced, and workers were given pay increases, both of which were badly needed.|$|E
500|$|A promotional music video, {{directed}} by Super Furry Animals and Martin McCarthy, was produced {{to accompany the}} release of [...] "Northern Lites" [...] as a single. The video begins with a shot of Super Furry Animals' 'SFA' logo, which appears {{on the cover of}} [...] "Northern Lites", displayed above the words [...] "Public information service". This shot fades to show a full-screen translucent, fluorescent blue, image of the [...] "warrior", also from the single's cover, which moves from the centre to the bottom right before shrinking and remaining stationary in the top right {{for the duration of the}} video. The SFA logo from the introduction is shown in the top left, opposite the [...] "warrior" [...] image, and also remains throughout the video. The island Ailsa Craig is briefly shown, the island where in 2004 when the single was released, 60 to 70% of all curling stones in use were made from granite from the island and is one of only two sources for all stones in the sport, the other being the Trefor Granite Quarry in Wales. Next, images of the sea and birds in flight are shown before footage of a bearded man, sitting on rocks beside the sea and singing along to the first verse is shown. This footage is intercut with shots of a man using a hammer and chisel on some boulders before walking away with a large rock. The rock is shown being spun and polished into a curling stone. A yellow handle is added to the stone and it is placed into a wooden box alongside another stone with a red handle. The box is closed and the word Nagano is seen printed on the lid. The video then cuts to shots of a Boeing 747 before wintery scenes of Nagano are shown, including a shot of people with umbrellas stood in <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> <b>in</b> front of a sign that reads [...] "Nagano Olympics". Footage from curling events are then shown until 2 minutes and 40 seconds when the video cuts to show a man in a grey suit dropping a handful of grass on a road. The video then ends with shots of Irish road bowling–several men are shown throwing a bowl down a road surrounded by spectators alongside scenes of men with measuring sticks and men exchanging banknotes. In a 2008 interview with Uncut, Gruff Rhys stated that [...] "Northern Lites" [...] "didn't have a video" [...] and suggested this as the reason the track was not a [...] bigger hit than it was. The director who was originally scheduled to work on the video took up an offer of a Red Stripe commercial in Jamaica, leaving the band to collaborate with McCarthy. According to Rhys the group met the original director later and told him [...] "We understand, we'd have done the same."
