40|$|The {{results of}} an {{experimental}} study on both pulsating and steady Newtonian fluid flow in an initially stretched rubber tube subjected to external vibration are reported. A circulating loop system was designed to maintain constant hydrostatic pressure throughout the tests so that the influence of external excitation on the fluid flow could be properly distinguished. The effects of fluid flow velocity and initial stretch rates on the dynamic response and damping of the <b>tube</b> <b>conveying</b> fluid were examined, and {{it was observed that}} damping ratios increase with increasing flow velocities, and generally decrease with increasing initial stretch rates for the <b>tube</b> <b>conveying</b> fluid.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} the dynamic analysis of initially tensioned orthotropic thin-walled cylindrical <b>tubes</b> <b>conveying</b> steady fluid flow, based on Sanders' non-linear theory of thin shells and the classical potential flow theory. The method is relatively straightforward, using a hydrodynamic pressure formulation derived from the velocity potential, a dynamic coupling condition at the fluid-structure interface and two-noded frustum elements to assess the dynamic behaviour of these tube/fluid systems accurately. A non-linear strain-displacement relationship is also deployed to derive the geometric stiffness matrix due to the initial stresses and hydrostatic pressures. The equations of motion for the tube and fluid are solved by a finite element method, and this is validated by comparing the natural frequencies obtained with other published results. The influence of material properties, fluid flow velocities and initial axial tensions on the natural frequencies is then illustrated and discussed...|$|R

The cross flow of air over the tube and the liquid flow in the tube were turbulent in all cases. The experimental results have been compared {{and it has been}} found that suspending Ag nanoparticles in the base fluid increases thermal conductance, external Nusselt number, and effectiveness. Furthermore, by increasing the external Reynolds number, the external Nusselt number, effectiveness, and thermal conductance increase.

Comparison is made between the features of this turbulent flow and those of a previously investigated laminar flow through the same geometry. In both, retrograde flow ceases between two and three diameters downstream of the centre of the throat.

40|$|ABSTRACT. An in-situ multi {{port bottom}} water sampler was {{designed}} to assess nutrient regeneration from sediment under and within 30 m downcurrent of raft cultured mussels in Totten Inlet, Washington State. Bottom water was simultaneously pumped {{through a series of}} color coded polyethylene <b>tubes</b> <b>conveying</b> water from ports at 2. 0, 20. 0 and 50. 0 cm above the sediment’s surface by peristaltic pump. Sediments under the rafts did not have elevated concentrations of total volatile solids when the samples were collected, but were anaerobic and contained between 1, 571 and 2, 620 µM of free sulfides. Free sulfides declined exponentially with distance from the raft complexes center and were 760 µM S = on the perimeter and at background beyond that. Statistically significant increases in all nutrients except nitrate were observed 2. 0 cm above the sediment’s surface under the rafts in comparison with reference conditions. Dissolved inorganic nitrogen, ammonium and phosphate were significantly elevated under the farm at elevations of 2. 0 and 20 cm but not at 50 cm height above the sediments. Consistent trends in concentrations of silicate were not observed at any distance or elevation. Significant increases were not observed for any nutrient above reference concentrations on the perimeter of the farm or at 30 m downcurrent. These results indicate that significant quantities of dissolved inorganic nitrogen and phosphate were being regenerated from sediments under the center of the rafts but that the regenerating area did not extend to or beyond the raft’s perimeter. When combined with simultaneous current speeds in the benthic boundary layer, this methodology will provide a simple and inexpensive means of determining the flux of nutrients from enriched sediments under aquaculture facilities located in waters shallow enough to allow surface connections with polyethylene tubing...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the collapse and subsequent self-excited oscillation of compliant <b>tubes</b> <b>conveying</b> fluids. Our model considers a two-dimensional, in viscid, shear flow in a flexible channel of infinite length subject to linear, travelling varicose waves. Analysis of the boundary-value problem leads to two findings which do not seem to have been noticed before, despite the close attention this kind of fluid-structure interaction has attracted on account of its medical significance. The pressure perturbation on the wall has two components, the first is in-phase with the wall displacement and the second with the velocity of the wall motion. For potential flow, the first component is the only one tending to destabilize and is known as the Bernoulli effect. For shear flow, however, the sign of the pressure is reversed as the Bernoulli effect is overcome by the perturbations of the vorticity field. Streamline patterns show that Kelvin's "cats' eyes" are sheltered in the wider channel sections, rendering the effective flow passage smaller where the physical width is larger. The second component produces a wave drag, hence irreversible transfer of energy from the flow to waves. We argue that this is a possible mechanism for the self-excited oscillation observed in experiments. This mechanism is similar to Miles's (1957) mechanism of water wave generation by wind, which is a class B instability according to the Benjamin-Landahl categorization, but the accompanying reversal of the Bernoulli effect is different and depends essentially on the presence of a second boundary. The eigenvalue problem is also considered and it is shown that dynamic instability of long but finite wavelength could be experienced by compliant channels with thick walls, a typical application being the respiratory flow in the upper airways. The critical flow speed is given in terms of the channel properties. © 1998 Academic Press Limited. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Two {{problems}} {{in the study of}} elastic filaments are considered. First, a reliable numerical algorithm is developed that candetermine the shape of a static elastic rod under a variety ofconditions. In this algorithm the governing equations are writtenentirely in terms of local coordinates and are discretized usingfinite differences. The algorithm has two significant advantages:firstly, it can be implemented {{for a wide variety of}} the boundaryconditions and, secondly, it enables the user to work with generalconstitutive relationships with only minor changes to thealgorithm. In the second problem a model is presented describingthe dynamics of an elastic <b>tube</b> <b>conveying</b> a fluid. First weanalyze instabilities that are present in a straight rod or tubeunder tension subject to increasing twist in the absence of afluid. As the twist is increased beyond a critical value, thefilament undergoes a twist-to-writhe bifurcation. A multiplescales expansion is used to derive nonlinear amplitude equationsto examine the dynamics of the elastic rod beyond the bifurcationthreshold. This problem is then reinvestigated for an elastic tubeconveying a fluid to study the effect of fluid flow on thetwist-to-writhe instability. A linear stability analysisdemonstrates that for an infinite rod the twist-to-writhethreshold is lowered by the presence of a fluid flow. Amplitudeequations are then derived from which the delay of bifurcation dueto finite tube length is determined. It is shown that the delayedbifurcation threshold depends delicately on the length of the tubeand that it can be either raised or lowered relative to thefluid-free case. The amplitude equations derived for the case of aconstant average fluid flux are compared to the case where theflux depends on the curvature. In this latter case it is shownthat inclusion of curvature results in small changes in some ofthe coefficients in the amplitude equations and has only a smalleffect on the post-bifurcation dynamics...|$|R
40|$|The {{collapse}} of a compressed elastic <b>tube</b> <b>conveying</b> a flow occurs in several physiological applications {{and has become a}} problem of considerable interest. Laboratory experiments on a finite length of collapsible tube reveal a rich variety of self-excited oscillations, indicating that the system is a complex, nonlinear dynamical system. Following our previous study on steady flow in a two-dimensional model of the collapsible tube problem (Luo &# 38; Pedley 1995), we here investigate the instability of the steady solution, and details of the resulting oscillations when it is unstable, by studying the time-dependent problem. For this purpose, we have developed a time-dependent simulation of the coupled flow – membrane problem, using the Spine method to treat the moving boundary and a second-order time integration scheme with variable time increments. It is found that the steady solutions become unstable as tension falls below a certain value, say Tu, which decreases as the Reynolds number increases. As a consequence, steady flow gives way to self-excited oscillations, which become increasingly complicated as tension is decreased from Tu. A sequence of bifurcations going through regular oscillations to irregular oscillations is found, showing some interesting dynamic features similar to those observed in experiments. In addition, vorticity waves are found downstream of the elastic section, with associated recirculating eddies which sometimes split into two. These are similar to the vorticity waves found previously for flow past prescribed, time-dependent indentations. It is speculated that the mechanism of the oscillation is crucially dependent on the details of energy dissipation and flow separation at the indentation. As tension is reduced even further, the membrane is sucked underneath the downstream rigid wall and, although this causes the numerical scheme to break down, it in fact agrees with another experimental observation for flow in thin tubes. </p...|$|R
