40|$|To {{enhance the}} {{performance}} of modern high-bypass jet engines a promising approach is to replace the low pressure-vane row arranged downstream of a strutted intermediate turbine diffuser (mid <b>turbine</b> <b>frame)</b> by the application of turning struts and to integrate functionalities such as bearing supports, lubrication pipes, engine mounts and aggressive duct designs. Thus the weight may be reduced which results in a lower specific fuel consumption and reduced CO 2 -emissions. The additional functions of the mid <b>turbine</b> <b>frame</b> (MTF) structures lead to constraints like a minimum required strut thickness leading to a maximum possible number of struts. Therefore a highly three-dimensional design of the airfoils and the duct, respectively, is necessary to reduce strong secondary flow effects and further to provide suitable flow angle and Mach number for the following low pressure turbine (LPT). A future area of application for mid turbine frames with turning struts, so-called turning mid turbine frames (TMTF), may also be in direct-drive open-rotor engine architectures. There the LPT with contra-rotating stator and rotor blades is arranged at relatively large radii and the rear bearings of these shafts are supported in the TMTF...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} several years the term oil-free {{turbomachinery}} has been used to describe a rotor support system for high speed turbomachinery that does not require oil for lubrication, damping, or cooling. The foundation technology for oil-free turbomachinery is the compliant foil bearing. This technology can replace the conventional rolling element bearings found in current engines. Two major benefits are realized with this technology. The primary benefit is the elimination of the oil lubrication system, accessory gearbox, tower shaft, and one <b>turbine</b> <b>frame.</b> These components account for 8 to 13 percent of the turbofan engine weight. The second benefit that compliant foil bearings offer to turbofan engines is the capability to operate at higher rotational speeds and shaft diameters. While traditional rolling element bearings have diminished life, reliability, and load capacity with increasing speeds, the foil bearing has a load capacity proportional to speed. The traditional applications for foil bearings have been in small, lightweight machines. However, recent advancements in the design and manufacturing of foil bearings have increased their potential size. An analysis, grounded in experimentally proven operation, is performed to assess the scalability of the modern foil bearing. This analysis was coupled to the requirements of civilian turbofan engines. The application of the foil bearing to larger, high bypass ratio engines nominally at the 120 kN (approx. 25000 lb) thrust class has been examined.

The relative humidity and ambient inlet air temperature have been varied from 30 to 45 % and from 80 to 100 ° F, respectively. Fuels considered are natural gas, diesel and heavy bunker oil. Simulated gas turbine plant output from GT PRO has been validated against an existing gas turbine plant output. It has been observed the simulated plant output is less than the existing gas turbine plant output by 5 %. Results show that variation of relative humidity does not affect the gas turbine performance appreciably for all types of fuels.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} an experimental {{investigation of the}} unsteady flow field in the two-spool counter-rotating transonic turbine at Graz University of Technology. The test setup consists of a high pressure (HP) stage, a diffusing mid <b>turbine</b> <b>frame</b> with turning struts (TMTF) and a shrouded low pressure (LP) rotor. The two rotors are mounted on mechanically independent shafts {{in order to provide}} engine-representative operating conditions. The rig was designed in cooperation with MTU Aero Engines and Volvo Aero within the EU project DREAM (ValiDation of Radical Engine Architecture SysteMs). A two-sensor fast response aerodynamic pressure probe (2 S-FRAP) has been employed to provide time-resolved aerodynamic area traverses downstream of the LP turbine. Such measurement allows estimating the total deterministic unsteadiness transported through the duct. In particular, it has been possible to isolate the structures induced by each rotor by means of the encoders mounted on the two shafts. A global ensemble averaged field, which takes into account the rotor-rotor interactions, is also provided. The time resolved distributions of the flow quantities are then discussed in details. The perturbations due to the HP rotor in terms of velocity and flow angle are negligible in this downstream plane. Indeed, the largest fluctuations of velocity are due to the TMTF-LP rotor interaction, they occur in the wake and secondary flows of the TMTF. Large fluctuations of static and total pressure are instead due to both rotors to the same extent...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{discusses}} the time-averaged and the time-resolved flow in a two-stage two-spool test rig {{located at the}} Institute for Thermal Turbomachinery and Machine Dynamics (ITTM) of Graz University of Technology. The facility consists of a transonic turbine stage followed by a counter-rotating subsonic low pressure turbine. The rig was designed and operated within the EU-project DREAM, where the target was to built up a machine able to investigate the aerodynamics of interturbine S-shaped channels. An optimized design of this component represents a critical goal for the performances of modern and future jet engines. The turbine design techniques are nowadays still carried out by optimizations based on steadystate simulations: nevertheless since a long time {{it is well known}} how the engine performances are strongly dependent by the unsteady effects. The use of interfaces such as mixing plane or frozen rotor cuts off the real interactions between successive blade rows so that pressure losses and aeroacoustic effects are consequently estimated incorrectly. Such considerations are important for the designer who has to face a highly three dimensional unsteady flow like in a transonic turbine stage. Therefore, the aim of the present paper is to provide a quantitative comparison in terms of performance estimation error whenever a numerical simulation is undertaken in order to catch the time-mean or the time-resolved flow.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this investigation is to understand the steady and the unsteady flow field at the exit of an automotive torque converter turbine and stator with a view towards improving it's performance. A high frequency response five-hole probe was designed and built to measure the three-dimensional steady and unsteady flow fields. The measurements were conducted in a stationary frame of reference and the data were processed to derive the flow properties in the relative (<b>turbine)</b> <b>frame</b> of reference. The experimental data were processed in the frequency domain by spectrum analysis and in temporal-spatial domain by ensemble averaging technique. The data show that the flow field is highly unsteady with high unresolved unsteadiness (approx. 17 - 21 % of mean value) and significant blade-to-blade periodic component approx. 6 % of mean value). The unresolved unsteadiness and periodic unsteadiness increase {{with an increase in}} the radius from the shell to the core whereas the aperiodic unsteadiness does not show any systematic variation with the radius. The experimental data reveal the presence of a low momentum region near the core due to possible flow separation and reattachment inside the turbine passage. Data also show the presence of strong secondary flow near the core and weak secondary flow near the shell at the exit of the turbine. These secondary flows generate high levels of turbulence. A comparison of the flow properties upstream and downstream of the stator in the stationary frame of reference indicate the presence of high losses near the core due to high turbulence levels and large secondary flows, and high losses near the shell due to possible corner separation near the shell suction surface inside the stator blade passage. The unsteadiness in the flow properties upstream of the stator is high. The rms value of the unsteady total velocity is approx. 20 % of the steady state value. Periodic and aperiodic unsteadiness were also found significant...|$|E

Although the engine systems development {{process of the}} next generation aero engines takes place at the original equipment manufacturer level, component manufacturers need to optimize their components using an integrated engine system design approach. Therefore, they need the capability to model and simulate whole engine behavior. While modeling and simulation are traditional strengths of the aerospace industry, model integration of the whole engine system and its components, as well as between separate disciplines, is still a relatively weak link. This paper presents a master-model approach that facilitates integrated analysis used in design optimization.

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{functions}} of the <b>turbine</b> rear <b>frame,</b> located in the aft part of the engine, is to remove the angular component of the outgoing flow from the low pressure turbine. The angular component in the outgoing flow is due to load on the low pressure turbine. The most interesting part of the <b>turbine</b> rear <b>frame</b> from an aerodynamic {{point of view is}} the gas channel consisting of outlet guide vanes, a hub, and a shroud. Volvane is a powerful in-house design tool used to create guide vanes and includes a 2 D panel which is a potential flow solver and a G 3 D Euler solver. Minimizing the number of design parameters is a main issue and may result in a significant improvement in the outlet guide vane design process with Volvane. Initially a reference design of an outlet guide vane is created in Volvane. The design is simulated in Volvane and with different RANS-solvers and computational grids. After analysis of the ow results, a RANS-solver is selected for further use in the investigation. In Part 1, the design tool validation is the target {{to reduce the number of}} design parameters. Three different design of experiments (DoEs) are created. Design parameters and boundary conditions were varied to investigate how the flow behaves around the outlet guide vanes for different geometries and operating conditions. The same changes were simulated in RANS-solvers and the results compared with those of the Volvane program. Analysis in Part 1 resulted in updates of new V olvane versions. The V olvane G 3 D Euler solver has more difficulties in predicting changes in lean compared to changes in sweep and is more able to predict an increased than a decreased sweep angle. If the boundary condition of the swirl is increased, the V olvane G 3 D Euler solver has difficulties in predicting the diffusion factor. Simulations with wall function mesh in the selected RANS-solver showed a 2 % outlet swirl angle difference from the low Reynolds mesh. This aspect should be taken into account when analyzing results from flow simulations. The loss estimations from the V olvane G 3 D Euler solver are approximately 35 % of the loss estimations from the RANS-solver. Generally the V olvane G 3 D Euler solver and the RANS-solver are in good agreement. In Part 2, the design process rationalization, response surface methodology (RSM) is created to find correlations between design and output parameters. A statistical software is the main tool used. The correlations measure the relations between different design and output parameters. Two additional DoEs are constructed. The analysis suggests the maximum thickness location of the vane can be shifted without affecting the axial position of maximum velocity. The correlations are unaffected when the parameter bounds are increased...|$|R

40|$|Non-conformances are effects {{related to}} the {{difference}} between the nominal design of an aircraft engine component and the finished manufactured product. At the aerothermodynamics department at Volvo Aero, a number of definitions are used to classify the non-conformances and their impact on the engine performance. The main objective of this thesis has been to validate the defined definitions limits for local non-conformances (bumps) positioned on the outlet guide vanes of a <b>turbine</b> rear <b>frame,</b> using CFD, and derive a correlation for calculation the drag coefficient of the bumps. The project was divided into two parts; a flat plate analysis and a real geometry analysis. The definition of a local non-conformance is based on the height of the bumps in relation to the boundary layer thickness at that location. The flow over a flat plate has been studied with and without bumps at a wide range of Reynolds numbers to see how different bump sizes affects the shape and size of the boundary layer. The added drag to the plate due to the presence of the bumps has been calculated and compared to the bump-free cases to see if a correlation was possible to derive. From the flat plate simulations {{it was found that the}} lower limit of 10 % and the upper limit of 99 % of the defined borders are valid. The lower limit can however be rectified due to an increase of just 11 % of the boundary layer thickness for bumps with a height of 40 %. A correlation was derived that calculates the drag coefficient of the bumps with an error of ± 5 % between the correlation calculation and the CFD results. The real geometries that were analyzed were representative of the regular vanes and mount vanes of a <b>turbine</b> rear <b>frame.</b> The boundary layer thickness has been calculated for both nominal vanes and for vanes with non-conformances (bumps) to determine the effect of the bumps on the boundary layer and if it’s possible to compare the results with the flat plate. The boundary layer thickness on the suction peak was found to be 3. 1 mm on the regular vane and 3. 3 mm on the mount vane. However, the method used for calculating the boundary layer thickness was found to be unstable when the flow over the vane separates. The only cases that are separation free are the 1 mm bumps, which are located at a height of 32 % of the nominal boundary layer thickness on the regular vane and 30 % on the mount vane. The increase in boundary layer thickness differs from the flat plate results and a detailed analysis on how the thickness is calculated needs to be performed. The correlation was tested on the 1 mm bumps and the drag coefficient calculated to be 0. 285 on the regular vane and 0. 275 on the mount vane. This can be compared to a drag coefficient of 0. 25 calculated at the department using a similar geometry and another method. However, the correlation needs to be compared with other real geometry bump sizes to be considered fully validated. Validerat; 20110913 (anonymous...|$|R

5000|$|McGillis {{becomes the}} {{commander}} of the Outer Earth Orbit Regulatory Joint Fleet and allies with Tekkadan to defeat Rustal Elion's Arianrhod Fleet. Rustal sends a mercenary into Tekkadan's Earth Branch in order to cause internal conflicts, but is finally stopped when the Mars Branch arrives. Tekkadan then discovers a destructive automated weapon of mass destruction known as a Mobile Armor and destroys it in a grueling battle after it is accidentally awakened. Later, their allies, the <b>Turbines,</b> are <b>framed</b> for smuggling illegal weapons and are destroyed. After retaliating against the ones responsible, Tekkadan then severs their ties with Teiwaz to work with McGillis, who plans a coup d'etat to take over Gjallarhorn. However, his fleets and Tekkadan are overpowered by Arianrhod in space and are forced to retreat to Mars. When Gjallarhorn surrounds Tekkadan's headquarters, Tekkadan plans their escape to Chryse while McGillis heads towards the Arianrhod fleet to face Rustal. However, he is stopped and killed by Gaelio while Orga is assassinated by Nobliss Gordon's men. Outnumbered but not outmatched, Mikazuki and Akihiro fend off against Gjallarhorn forces while their comrades safely escape to Chryse while the base is destroyed from bombardment; seemingly wiping Tekkadan out. After Mikazuki and Akihiro die in battle, the war becomes known as the [...] "McGillis Fareed Incident". In the aftermath several years later, Gjallarhorn repeals its council system and starts a more democratic organization, with Rustal as its head. Kudelia becomes the chairwoman of the Mars Union while the surviving Tekkadan members start various jobs under new identities and Atra raises her son, Akatsuki, together with Kudelia on Mars. While still mournful for the loss of Tekkadan and Mikazuki, she still loves the world for their sacrifice to make a better place.|$|R
40|$|The optimal {{matching}} {{of a small}} gas <b>turbine</b> in the <b>frame</b> of {{a hybrid}} SOFC-GT is examined in the present paper. The behaviour of the gas turbine is examined for the design point and part-load operation regimes. Special {{emphasis is placed on}} the design requirements placed on the compressor and turbine for optimal operation of the hybrid system. At the same time, modifications on the rotating components that could benefit the overall performance are examined. Alternative configurations based on this analysis, but also inspired by the “variable area turbojet ” concept, known in the aeroengines field (but inapplicable, because of the high temperature level of the turbine) and the variable nozzle concept applied in turbochargers with success, are examined for the turbine, but also for the compressor. These offer maximum flexibility on the operation of the system at all conditions. Only the overall sizing of the components and their performance are estimated. Based on these results, possible gains in system efficiency are evaluated. It is concluded that, allowing for the SOFC-GT system constrains, the use of an appropriately designed gas turbine can have a favourable effect on the system efficiency and stability, both at design and off-design conditions...|$|R
40|$|New design goals {{on modern}} jet engines {{often leads to}} more highly loaded {{turbines}} with fewer stages {{in order to save}} weight and cost. This gives higher swirl angles into the outlet guide vane (OGV), implying a more difficult aerodynamic design. Structural requirements and weight reduction goals in recent designs of <b>turbine</b> rear <b>frames</b> (TRF) also often requires non-cylindrical shrouds with a three-dimensional polygonal shape and sunken engine-mount bumps. This has sparked a renewed interest in design methods and validation cases for LPT/OGV flows with complex end-wall geometries and engine mount bumps. Very little work has been conducted in the field of low pressure turbine outlet guide vanes (LPT/OGVs). This thesis concerns the aerodynamics around a highly loaded OGV, both with and without an engine mount bump. In {{the first part of the}} thesis a linear cascade was designed using new techniques including both CFD and classical analytical approaches. The test-facility proved to work as expected, and properties like load distributions, losses, outlet flow angles and the evolution of the secondary flowfield was extensively monitored. To get a better view of the downstream secondary flow development, traverse measurements for half the span and one pitch around the middle vane were performed for several downstream positions in the cascade. Since the experimental mesh was very resolved the streamwise vorticity could be analyzed for a better understanding of the secondary flow progress. For all these measurements numerical models as implemented in FLUENT were validated. The turbulence models tested in this thesis are the realizable k-ε model, the k-ω SST model, the Spalart-Allmaras model and the Reynolds Stress Model (RSM). The author would recommend the use of the realizable k-ε model in the design process for a new OGV design. The realizable k-ε model does not always resolve the flow perfectly well, but it is robust and converges well with good results. It is also relatively fast, which is important when many design iterations are needed. For thorough investigations of the flowfield the k-ω SST model is recommended. This model is superior to the other models in predicting the progress of the secondary flow. It was often used by the author to increase the understanding of the experimental results. Its results for the development of the flowfield around the engine mount bumps were very satisfying...|$|R
