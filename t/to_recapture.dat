5|$|On June 6, the Imperial Japanese Navy {{returned}} to the Aleutians, occupying Kiska on that day and Attu Island the next. Despite the U.S. not posting any forces to oppose the occupation of those islands, the Japanese public was informed of a great triumph over U.S. forces on the islands. It was {{the desire of the}} Joint Chiefs of Staff <b>to</b> <b>recapture</b> these islands as quickly as possible, and on August 30, 1942, 4,500 U.S. Army troops secured the island of Adak, {{to be used as a}} staging post <b>to</b> <b>recapture</b> Kiska. In two weeks, Army engineers had constructed an airfield on the island, and on September 14, a number of Consolidated B-24 Liberators took off from Adak to attack Kiska. Repeated bombings during the fall season convinced the Japanese of the Americans' desire <b>to</b> <b>recapture</b> Kiska and Adak, and by November the Japanese had bolstered troop numbers on the ground on both islands. During the winter months, the short daily sunshine period and inclement weather protected the Japanese from attack.|$|E

5|$|The {{first attempt}} by the Japanese Army <b>to</b> <b>recapture</b> Henderson Field was on 21 August, in the Battle of the Tenaru, and the next, the Battle of Edson's Ridge, from 12–14 September; both failed.|$|E
5|$|Benedict Arnold again led a {{fleet of}} ships at the Battle of Valcour Island, and played other key roles in thwarting Britain's attempt <b>to</b> <b>{{recapture}}</b> the fort in 1776. The British did recapture the fort in July 1777 during the Saratoga campaign, but had abandoned it by November after Burgoyne's surrender at Saratoga.|$|E
5|$|Due to disunity {{among the}} southerners, between 1991 and 1994 the NIR was able <b>to</b> <b>recapture</b> many places in South Sudan {{including}} Mongalla and also Ayod, Leer, Akobo, Pochalla, Pibor, Waat, Nasir, Kit, Palotaka, Yirol, Bor, Torit, Kapoeta, Parjok and Magwi.|$|E

50|$|In 1965, {{the squad}} fell to fourth {{place in the}} tournament and were knocked out in the quarterfinals, the {{following}} year. They again achieved third place in 1966, after losing to St. Louis, 1-0, in the semi-final. The Mids {{would return to the}} Tournament three more times with Glenn Warner, but would never come close <b>to</b> <b>recapturing</b> the title.|$|R
5|$|Hyakutake {{immediately}} began to prepare for another attempt <b>to</b> <b>recapture</b> Henderson Field. The Japanese navy promised to support Hyakutake's next offensive by delivering the necessary troops, equipment, and supplies to the island, and by stepping-up air attacks on Henderson Field and sending warships to bombard the airfield.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, the {{successful}} campaign <b>to</b> <b>recapture</b> Guadalcanal from the Japanese {{was an important}} strategic victory for the U.S. and its allies. Building on their success at Guadalcanal and elsewhere, the Allies continued their campaign against Japan, ultimately culminating in Japan's defeat {{and the end of}} World War II.|$|E
5|$|On 11 September the frigate HMS Africaine {{arrived from}} Rodriguez, {{commanded}} by Captain Robert Corbet {{who had served}} in the raid on Saint Paul in 1809. Corbet was a deeply unpopular commander and when his frigate was attacked and captured by Bouvet's frigates at the Action of 13 September 1810, rumours spread that his death was the result or suicide or even murder, rather than from the battle. Rowley was able <b>to</b> <b>recapture</b> Africaine the following day, but the danger that Hamelin's ships posed to British frigates sailing independently was further emphasised at the Action of 18 September 1810, when HMS Ceylon was captured by Hamelin's flagship Vénus. Again, Rowley was able <b>to</b> <b>recapture</b> the British frigate and on this occasion the damage done to Vénus was so severe that she was unable to outrun Boadicea and she too was captured, with Hamelin on board.|$|E
25|$|A League and Spanish force {{defeated}} an Anglo Royal army at Craon on 21 May but elsewhere {{they were}} less successful.

5|$|On 23 May 1948, the Indian Army {{captured}} Tithwal from Pakistani troops, but the Pakistanis quickly {{launched a}} counter-attack <b>to</b> <b>recapture</b> the area. The Indian troops, unable {{to withstand the}} attack, withdrew from their positions to the Tithwal ridge, preparing to regain their positions at the right moment.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{afterwards}} on 9 June, a Royalist force led by Sir Michael Woodhouse attempted <b>to</b> <b>recapture</b> the castle, now garrisoned by Parliament. The counter-attack was unsuccessful, {{ending in}} the rout of the Royalist {{forces in a}} skirmish at the nearby village of Wistanstow.|$|E
5|$|The Germans {{refrained from}} {{attempts}} <b>to</b> <b>recapture</b> the lost ground at Lens, {{due to the}} demands of defensive operations of the Third Battle of Ypres and the need to avoid the diversion of forces from the main effort. The Canadian attack prevented the Germans from transferring five divisions in the Lens area to Flanders.|$|E
5000|$|The {{seizure of}} {{numerous}} important Arcadian cities by the King of Sparta, Cleomenes III, prompted the dominant {{state of the}} Peloponnese, the Achaean League to declare war on Sparta. [...] The Achaean attempts <b>to</b> <b>recaptured</b> these cities, led by the strategos, Aratus, largely failed as Sparta consolidated its position. Subsequent Achaean offensives in 226 BC were crushingly defeated at the Battle of Mount Lycaeum and the Battle of Ladoceia.|$|R

Finally, the approach <b>to</b> identifying the <b>recaptured</b> videos is deduced based on the suggested assumptions.|$|R

5|$|The first Japanese attempt <b>to</b> <b>recapture</b> Henderson Field failed when a 917-man {{force was}} {{defeated}} on 21 August in the Battle of the Tenaru.

5|$|The {{transformation}} of age-old customs, commerce and administration to the Swedish model {{could not be}} effected quickly or easily.

Denmark made several attempts <b>to</b> <b>recapture</b> the territories, the last in 1710, but ultimately conceded the territories as lost.|$|E
5|$|When the British paratroopers had withdrawn, two of {{the guns}} were put back into action by the Germans.

5|$|A {{declared}} {{purpose of}} the Treaty of the Triple Alliance was the demolition of the Humaitá fortifications and that none others of that sort should be built again. However the fortress, though not by then invulnerable to the latest armour-plated warships, was a serious obstacle to the Allies’ plans to proceed upriver to the Paraguayan capital Asunción and <b>to</b> <b>recapture</b> the Brazilian territory of Mato Grosso: it delayed them {{for two and a}} half years. It was taken in the Siege of Humaitá (1868), then razed pursuant to the Treaty.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the team}} was {{considered}} successful, {{in spite of the}} failure <b>to</b> <b>recapture</b> The Ashes, the problems between the players and the administrators continued. Before the team departed Australia, the players arbitrarily replaced one of the selected players without recourse to the ACC. After the final match in England, Trott and his players broke an agreement to return home in time for the 1896–97 Australian season. Instead, they organised matches in North America and New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|As more {{reinforcements}} {{arrived from}} Hudong-ni on 30 November, the garrisons attempted <b>to</b> <b>recapture</b> the East Hill. All efforts failed despite {{the destruction of}} a Chinese company. When darkness settled, the PVA 58th Division gathered its remaining 1,500 soldiers in a last-ditch attempt to capture Hagaru-ri. The reinforced defenders annihilated most of the attacking forces, with only the defences around the East Hill giving way. As the Chinese tried to advance from the East Hill, they were cut down by the 31st Tank Company.|$|E
25|$|Not {{only had}} the 35th and 38th Divisions been gutted in the {{fighting}} early in 1915, they were undergoing a change in command. The previous commander for the Iraq Area Command, Colonel Süleyman Askeri Bey, after the defeats of Qurna and Shaiba, had killed himself while recuperating from wounds. His successor was Colonel Nureddin. A veteran of the Balkan Wars, Nureddin was charged by Envers Pasha with defending {{every inch of the}} Baghdad vilayet with an eye towards <b>to</b> <b>recapturing</b> Basra.|$|R
