5|$|Eladio escapes as he {{is being}} deported, killing a truck driver in the process. A {{clinical}} exam on the driver shows his death {{was caused by a}} rapid growth of Trichophyton — the Athlete's foot fungus. Scully brings samples of the fatal fungi to a mycologist who discovers that their abnormally rapid growth was caused by an unidentifiable enzyme. This revelation leads Scully to suspect Eladio of being an unwitting carrier of the enzyme, necessitating his immediate capture. Eladio, seeking to return to Mexico, meets with his cousin Gabrielle to ask for money. He works with a construction foreman for the day to make the money. Soledad comes after him, seeking to kill him, but finds the foreman dead. Eladio escapes in the foreman's truck and heads <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>grocery</b> store where Gabrielle works, spreading the fungal growth. The agents later confront Soledad at the supermarket, discovering another dead victim of the fungus.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{propose a}} method <b>to</b> monitor <b>the</b> <b>grocery</b> items {{in a home}} refrigerator. Using load sensors mounted under a shelf of the refrigerator, our method matches {{groceries}} that are put into and taken from the refrigerator. Our prototype load-sensing board uses four load sensors <b>to</b> acquire <b>the</b> weight and position of <b>the</b> <b>grocery</b> items, and we use this data <b>to</b> re-identify <b>the</b> <b>groceries.</b> Detailed ex-periments show that this feature can accurately re-identify grocery items and thus provide constant monitoring of refrigerator contents. ...|$|R

25|$|He {{travelled}} to South Africa {{with the}} intent of joining the British Army, as his brother was serving there and promised to get him in his unit.

He lived in the town of Ramonsdrift, at the border between South Africa and German South-West Africa. German forces became his chief customers, and he learned to speak German fluently.|$|E
25|$|Walker was {{not new to}} {{the world}} of business. Since his {{migration}} to Detroit he had been involved in several different projects. In his earlier days he worked as a grocery clerk from 1838 until 1845 for several different employers. Eventually, after being involved in the grocery business for several years, he took it upon himself to begin operating a grocery store of his own in 1846 which did not last. Following his work as a clerk, Walker was employed at the firm of Ingersoll and Kirby, a leather and leather goods business. Through this, he gained his first knowledge into the business world. By 1845, Walker saved enough money as a clerk to invest in a business, the firm of Walker and Parker, which specialized in tanning and leather sales. However, this partnership dissolved in 1846, and Walker returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>grocery</b> business. Eventually, the same tannery business that he invested in was burned down in 1848.|$|E

25|$|William Lever {{was born}} on 19 September 1851 at 16 Wood Street, Bolton, Lancashire, England. He was the eldest son and the seventh child born to James Lever (1809–1897), a grocer, and Eliza Hesketh, {{daughter}} of a cotton mill manager. From age six to age nine William attended a small private school run by the Misses Aspinwall in a house on Wood Street, {{not far from the}} Lever family home. At the age of nine he was sent to another of Bolton's private schools before finishing his formal education at Bolton Church Institute from 1864 to 1867. Not a particularly bright scholar, he was nevertheless keen to acquire academic learning. His mother wanted him to enter the learned professions, ostensibly medicine, and William himself was very interested in becoming an architect. His father, however, had other, somewhat less erudite plans for his eldest son and thus, not long after his fifteenth birthday, he started work in the family grocery business. By then, the Lever family had moved from Wood Street to a larger house adjacent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>grocery</b> business. In the celebrated Victorian manner, the boss’s son was, initially at least, shown no preferential treatment, being required to sweep the floor and tidy up before the staff arrived. Other tasks included various practical assignments {{more to do with the}} fundamentals of the wholesale grocery trade, almost certainly designed to prepare the youth for management in later years. His remuneration was “a shilling a week all found” which meant that his board and lodgings were provided, making the financial aspect of the contract more-or-less pocket money.|$|E
500|$|Bans called Waller {{getting a}} new penis the most {{emotional}} scene she had to write, adding: [...] "I loved this story because I hate the idea that once you're old, your life is over. I hate when people treat their aging parents like old furniture {{they want to get}} rid of but have to find a place for so they stick 'em in the corner and forget about them." [...] Bans also commented on Heigl's character's storyline, writing: [...] "Poor Izzie. The girl's living with cancer, lost her best friend, impulsively got married and dragged her husband away to live in the woods. That takes a lot out of a person. I need to seriously recover on the couch for an hour after I go <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>grocery</b> store – I can't imagine the emotional and physical fatigue Izzie must be feeling right now. I think by the end of this episode, after Owen tells her that channeling her experience as a patient at Seattle Grace is undermining her strength as a doctor at Seattle Grace – she's wondering if she made a mistake. She's wondering if Alex and Derek and now Owen might be right – that she came back to work too soon. That she's not emotionally ready to be cutting into people yet. Because I think every doctor wants to believe all their terminal patients can be Izzie – but the odds tell another story." ...|$|E

2500|$|Louis Besumer and his {{mistress}} Harriet Lowe were attacked {{in the early}} morning hours of June 27, 1918, in the quarters at the back of his grocery which was located at the corner of Dorgenois and Laharpe Streets. Besumer was struck with a hatchet above his right temple, which resulted in a possible skull fracture. [...] Lowe was hacked over the left ear, and found unconscious when police arrived at the scene. The couple was discovered shortly after 7 AM on the morning of the attack by John Zanca, driver of a bakery wagon who had come <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>grocery</b> in order to make a routine delivery. [...] Zanca found both Besumer and Lowe in a puddle of their own blood, both bleeding from their heads. The axe, which had belonged to Besumer himself, was found in the bathroom of the apartment. [...] Besumer later stated to police that he had been sleeping when he was bashed with the hatchet. Almost immediately, police arrested potential suspect Lewis Oubicon, a then 41-year-old African American man who had been employed in Besumer's store just a week before the attacks. [...] No evidence existed which could have proved the man guilty, yet police arrested him nonetheless, stating that Oubicon had offered conflicting accounts of his whereabouts on the morning of the attack. [...] Shortly after the attempted murder Lowe stated that she remembered having been attacked by a mulatto man, yet her statement was discounted by police due to her disillusioned state. Robbery was said to be the only possible explanation for the attacks, yet no money or valuables were removed from the couple's home. [...] Oubicon was later released as police were unable to gather sufficient evidence to hold him accountable for the crimes. [...] Media attention soon turned to Besumer himself, as a series of letters written in German, Russian, and Yiddish were discovered in a trunk at the man's home. [...] Police suspected that Besumer was a German spy, and government officials began a full investigation of his potential espionage. [...] Weeks later, after going in and out of consciousness, Harriet Lowe told police that she thought Besumer was in fact a German spy, which led to his immediate arrest. [...] Two days later Besumer was released, and two lead investigators of the case were demoted due to unacceptable police work. [...] Besumer was once again arrested in August 1918, after Harriet Lowe, who lay dying in Charity Hospital after a failed surgery, stated that it was he who had attacked her more than a month previously with his hatchet. [...] He was charged with murder, and served nine months in prison before being acquitted on May 1, 1919, after a ten-minute jury deliberation.|$|E
