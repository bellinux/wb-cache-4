40|$|A {{modification}} of the flap first described in 1935 by Tranquilli-Leali and escribed again by Atasoy et al (1970) is presented. The relative indications {{for use of the}} original and the modified flap are examined in the fight of our experience of 116 flaps over a period of 4 years. Journal of Hand Surgery (British and European Volume, 1995) 20 B. " 6. " 815 - 823 The flap described by Tranquilli-Leali in 1935, described again by Atasoy et al (1970), and translated into English more recently (Lister, 1991) is an advancement of palmar skin and pulp tissue to cover exposed bone at the digital tip. Because the flap is vascularized by the small vessels of the subcutaneous pulp tissue lateral to its edges and distal to the trifurcation of the digital arteries, its use must be limited to amputations distal to the nail fold (Ishikawa Classification Types 1 and 2) (Fig 1; Ishikawa et al, 1990). Lister also pointed out that it can only provide adequate bone cover if the amputation is transverse or dorsal-facing (Lister, 1984). We have found use of this flap to be further estricted in that it is only adequate for transverse amputations at or distal to the mid-nail level (Ishikawa Type 1). Proximal to this level, the flap bulk is too small and does not advance far enough to provide good <b>tip</b> <b>cover,</b> except in those transverse amputations just distal to the nail fold, which can be converted to dorsal-facing ampu...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe Bell-Evans theory {{relative}} to rupture forces between non-covalently interacting molecules {{predicts that the}} rupture force increases linearly with the logarithm of the force loading rate. Here we investigate by force spectroscopy performed with an atomic force microscope (AFM) the rupture forces between surfaces covered by beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD) molecules and AFM tips coated with adamantane (AD) groups. The beta-CD molecules are either deposited through a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) or grafted on poly(allylamine hydrochloride) chains (PAH-CD) that are adsorbed on the substrate. The AD groups are fixed covalently on the AFM tip through either a one-AD or a four-AD platform linked to the tip though a PEO chain. It is found that while the rupture forces between AFM <b>tips</b> <b>covered</b> with tetravalent AD molecules and SAM-CD surfaces do not exceed twice those found with <b>tips</b> <b>covered</b> by monovalent AD molecules, the rupture forces increase {{by a factor of}} 20 on PAH-CD substrates for a tetravalent AD <b>covered</b> <b>tip</b> compared to a monovalent one. Thus, there seems to exist a synergistic effect between the molecule multivalence and the polymeric nature of the CD-covered substrate. As found in the literature, we observe an increase of the intensity of the rupture forces between the AD-covered AFM tip and the beta-CD covered substrate with the contact time over timescales up to several seconds. Finally, we find that when the host-guest system involves the multivalency of the AD guest and/or the polymeric nature of the host the mean rupture force decreases with the loading rate in contrast to what is predicted by the Bell-Evans theory. We tentatively explain this ``anti-Bell-Evans'' behavior by the possibility of rebinding during the rupture process. This effect should have important implications in the understanding of forces at the cellular level...|$|R

The only difference being that one should not open the telescopic rod in manner that whips a closed rod into the open position rapidly.

30|$|When the tip slides {{on surface}} III, the topmost {{two layers of}} the 4 th and 5 th textures are {{scratched}} by the tip, and some atoms are filled into the spacing between the two textures. As the sliding going on, a big stable texture is formed since the 13 th sliding, and only the right part of the <b>tip</b> is <b>covered</b> by adhered atoms, as shown in Figure  6 (c). The interactions between the <b>tip</b> with its <b>cover</b> layer and the big texture make the difference of average friction forces for odd or even slidings. There are attractive forces acting on the <b>tip</b> and its <b>cover</b> layer from the big texture. The direction of the composition of attractive forces is same as the odd sliding because the right part of the current tip gets more atoms than the left part considering the cover layer. Therefore, the average friction forces of the odd slidings are lower than the cases of even slidings.|$|R
