25|$|Boeing's {{cancellation}} of the Connexion by Boeing system caused concerns that in-flight internet would not be available on next-generation aircraft such as Qantas' fleet of AirbusA380s. However, Qantas announced in July 2007 that all service classes in its fleet of A380s would have wireless internet access, as well as seat-back access <b>to</b> <b>e-mail</b> and cached web browsing.

25|$|The Data Encryption Standard (DES) and the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) are {{block cipher}} designs {{that have been}} {{designated}} cryptography standards by the US government (though DES's designation was finally withdrawn after the AES was adopted). Despite its deprecation as an official standard, DES (especially its still-approved and much more secure triple-DES variant) remains quite popular; it is used across {{a wide range of}} applications, from ATM encryption <b>to</b> <b>e-mail</b> privacy and secure remote access. Many other block ciphers have been designed and released, with considerable variation in quality. Many have been thoroughly broken, such as FEAL.|$|E
25|$|The 2008 US presidential {{campaign}} {{had a huge}} presence on social networking sites. Barack Obama, a virtually unknown Democratic candidate, utilized 15 different social media websites to form relationships with the millions of American citizens who utilize those networks. His social networking profile pages were constantly being updated and interacting with followers. By {{the end of his}} campaign, Obama had 5 million social media network supporters (2.5 million on Facebook and 115,000 on Twitter). The use of social networking sites in his marketing campaign gave Barack Obama's campaign access <b>to</b> <b>e-mail</b> addresses, as posted on social network profile pages. This allowed the Democratic Party to launch e-mail campaigns asking for votes and campaign donations.|$|E

500|$|A Daily Bugle website {{revealed}} Denis Leary as George Stacy, {{lamenting the}} appearance of the wall-crawler and asking whoever spots Spider-Man <b>to</b> <b>e-mail</b> the police. The site hosted the best fan-made Spider-Man scenes. People who uploaded images of [...] "Spider-Man" [...] on the [...] "Webbed Menace" [...] viral site received a poster that sent them to a website for a boxing gym called [...] "Jerera's Boxing Gym". The gym was funded by Peter Parker's school. A viral website of that class was discovered. Entering the correct password revealed Parker's class schedule. The Midtown High School site then revealed a Twitter user tracking down Lizard and asked people in Los Angeles, New York City, Atlanta, Chicago, Salt Lake City, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Austin, Tampa, Minneapolis and New Orleans to stay tuned for details. A viral site for Oscorp Industries was available. The Twitter account that coordinated a nationwide effort to track Lizard sightings revealed locations that had packages containing Connors' shredded lab coat, an Oscorp ID badge and scientific samples of reptilian skin. When unscrambling the letters listed on each sample, the words [...] "animal dynamics lab" [...] led players to a new Oscorp Industries site focusing on a science program about reptile genetics. The site depicts Doctor Connors search for interns who could begin applying on May 14. Completing the application and supplying the keyword [...] "Mutagen" [...] unveiled a Lizard featurette. The Oscorp Industries website contained puzzles that revealed two in-game documents, two video updates featuring Connors and a following cipher that as of July 2012 had yet to be cracked. From there images were then unscrambled, revealing a research project with spiders, a letter from Mary Parker to Richard Parker that exposed his workaholic habits and a Daily Bugle newspaper that contained notes about Oscorp.|$|E

2500|$|Electronic mail, often {{shortened}} <b>to</b> <b>e-mail,</b> is {{a method}} of creating, transmitting, or storing primarily text-based human communications with digital communications systems.

5000|$|The channel prided {{itself on}} its {{interactivity}} with viewers. fX, in 1994, {{was an early}} adopter of the internet, embracing e-mail and the World Wide Web as methods of feedback. Most of the shows would feature instant responses <b>to</b> <b>e-mailed</b> questions, and one show, Backchat (hosted by Jeff Probst), was exclusively devoted to responding to viewer mail, whether sent through e-mail or traditional postal mail. Select viewers were allowed to spend {{a day at the}} [...] "apartment" [...] and take part in all of the channel's shows. Inside the channel's syndicated programming blocks, channel hosts would frequently appear during commercial breaks to read news headlines, respond <b>to</b> <b>e-mails</b> from viewers about the episode that was airing, or to promote upcoming programming.|$|R
2500|$|Google Wave {{provides}} federation {{using an}} extension of Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP), the open Wave Federation Protocol. Being an open protocol, anyone {{can use it to}} build a custom Wave system and become a wave provider. [...] The use of an open protocol is intended to parallel the openness and ease of adoption of the e-mail protocol and, like e-mail, allow communication regardless of provider. Google hoped that waves would replace e-mail as the dominant form of Internet communication. [...] In this way, Google intended to be only one of many wave providers [...] and to also be used as a supplement <b>to</b> <b>e-mail,</b> instant messaging, FTP, etc.|$|E
2500|$|Though in the 2004 Doe v. Gonzalez case it {{was ruled}} that the NSL {{provisions}} of [...] violated the First and Fourth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution, the Department of Justice had appealed against this decision. The reauthorization Act, however, modified the law and made judicial review a requirement of NSLs but never removed the permanent gag provision. Therefore, on September 6, 2007, U.S. District Judge Victor Marrero ruled {{that the use of}} NSLs to gain access <b>to</b> <b>e-mail</b> and telephone data from private companies for counter-terrorism investigations was [...] "the legislative equivalent of breaking and entering, with an ominous free pass to the hijacking of constitutional values." [...] The court struck down NSLs because the gag power was unconstitutional and courts could still not engage in meaningful judicial review of these gags.|$|E
2500|$|Privacy {{on social}} {{networking}} sites can be undermined by many factors. For example, users may disclose personal information, sites may not take adequate steps to protect user privacy, and third parties frequently use information posted on social networks {{for a variety of}} purposes. [...] "For the Net generation, {{social networking sites}} have become the preferred forum for social interactions, from posturing and role playing to simply sounding off. However, because such forums are relatively easy to access, posted content can be reviewed by anyone with an interest in the users' personal information". The UK government has plans to monitor traffic on social networks. As well, schemes similar <b>to</b> <b>e-mail</b> jamming have been proposed for networks such as Twitter and Facebook. These would involve [...] "friending" [...] and [...] "following" [...] large numbers of random people to thwart attempts at network analysis. Privacy concerns have been found to differ between users according to gender and personality. Women are less likely to publish information that reveals methods of contacting them. Personality measures openness, extraversion, and conscientiousness were found to positively affect the willingness to disclose data, while neuroticism decreases the willingness to disclose personal information.|$|E
