40|$|This Thesis {{develops}} a two-stage aggregation disaggregation model based on <b>THRUPUT</b> 2 (Morton, Rosenthal and Lim, 1995), a mobility optimization model {{used to analyze}} the ability of the Armed Forces of the United States to conduct airlifts in support of major military operations. For a given fleet of aircraft, a given network of routes, and a given set of unit movement requirements over time, <b>THRUPUT</b> 2 schedules airlift to minimize late deliveries and non-deliveries. The linear programming model presented is based on <b>THRUPUT</b> 2, but aggregates those units which share the same origin-destination pair and have overlapping time periods and therefore creates a smaller linear program. This reduction in size will consequently decrease the time needed to solve, which is desirable because repeated runs of this model are necessary to generate analytic insight and develop recommendations. The thesis further {{develops a}} disaggregation model which will remove the aggregations of the first, and therefore offer resolution similar to that of <b>THRUPUT</b> 2. NAU. S. Navy (U. S.

Applying local color-backlight-dimming technology to FSC-LCDs, we demonstrated “Stencil-FSC” methods with a field rate as low as 120 Hz to render a high luminance “multi-color ” image on the first-field and effectively suppress CBU at the same time.

40|$|AbstractIn the {{information}} age innovative instructional deign is essential for every country. Instructional design {{has to be a}} continuous research and development process for the refinement and reorganization of information intent and the activity content of educational attempts. Systems concepts are adopted to illustrate the organized complexity of instructional process. The physical setting, the network of social interactions, instructional media, teaching methods and the teacher are identified as the major structural components of the instructional system. Every kind of stimulation from the external environment of any instructional unit in any form is an input to the system. Money, material, information and people are just a few examples of inputs. The ultimate expected outputs of an instructional system are wisdom and virtue. The work done by the system between the input and the output is called the <b>thruput.</b> Communication and interaction are primary <b>thruput</b> processes in instructional systems as learning being the expected result. None of the components by themselves can be an alternative to the whole system but complement each other in a dynamic interrelationship...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To study novel ways of {{representing}} data arrays for potential application in a microcomputer-based APL interpreter. The {{goal is to}} find, for arrays containing mixed integers and real numbers, a way to improve both storage efficiency and <b>thruput,</b> over that obtainable using conventional APL interpreter array representations. Investigation: For {{the purposes of this}} study, three representative APL operators were chosen for implementation - dyadic addition, multiplication and selection. To establish a set of base cases from which to work, these three operators were implemented for two distinctly different data structures: Case- 0 : arrays containing only fixed length floating point data elements Case- 1 : arrays containing only fixed length integer data elements These two cases are termed 2 ̆ 2 homogeneous 2 ̆ 2 because all data elements within each array share a common data structure - the conventional approach for APL interpreters. Three additional 2 ̆ 2 heterogeneous 2 ̆ 2 cases were then built upon the homogeneous base cases: Case- 2 : arrays containing mixed floating point and integer fixed length data elements Case- 3 : arrays containing mixed floating point and integer data elements, with the integer elements having variable length Case- 4 : arrays containing fixed length pointers to variable length Case- 3 data elements For all of these cases, space and time tradeoffs were studied and charted. Exerciser programs were written in BASIC to drive the 5 Case-n implementations to enable direct comparison of the 5 storage allocation approaches; these driver routines prepared test data, ran the addition/multiplication/selection exercises, retrieved time and space measurements, and performed data reduction for presentation in this report. The 5 Case-n implementors were written in 6502 CPU assembly language, and provided the functions of addition, multiplication, selection, timing, and data format conversion between BASIC and Case-n data structures. Fixed length floating point arithmetic was supported on the target microcomputer for which all code was written -an Atari 800. In support of multi-byte integer arithmetic, however, original addition and multiplication atomic functions required development. Conclusions: Of the 5 cases implemented, Case- 3 (heterogeneous variable length data elements) showed the greatest promise for saving space without adversely affecting addition and multiplication <b>thruput.</b> However, the selection algorithm had to be modified from an address calculation scheme based upon the indices of the desired elements to a search algorithm more suited to the variable length data elements. This produced astonishingly fast selection <b>thruput</b> for some applications, and dismally poor selection performance for others. At the end of the report are suggestions for future development of the variable length data element selection algorithm. Case- 4 (pointers to heterogeneous variable length data elements) was introduced to enable the conventional address calculation selection scheme for variable length elements. The addition of the pointers did not have much impact upon <b>thruput,</b> but the additional space required for the pointers erased the space savings achieved with variable length elements...|$|E
40|$|Multicast routing and {{admission}} control {{can be defined}} as follows. Various network users issue online requests for a connection to certain multicast sources. The network either connects this request or rejects it ({{admission control}} decision). If request is connected, a path with sufficient bandwidth is established starting at the requesting user and ending either at the source or at one of the users previously connected to the same source (route selection decision). The goal of these admission control and route selection decisions is to maximize total number of users connected (i. e. total <b>thruput)</b> subject to the network capacity constraints. This problem can be reduced to the online maximal dense tree problem: Upon a service request from a node in a weighted graph with a distinguished source, the node is either rejected or connected to the tree of previously connected nodes. The goal is to maximize the total number of requests while keeping the density (ratio of accepted re [...] ...|$|E

The introduction of fiber technology gives rise to new applications, such as interactive TV and video-conferencing, that feature multi-point communication. Applications with multi-point communication can be modeled as sources that broadcast information to subscribing nodes along a spanning (Steiner) tree.

40|$|A hierachical {{architecture}} is very apt to build large enterprise business process management, which contains several sub workflow management systems and one main WfMS. Each sub WfMS equips a transaction queue for high performance under distributed computing environment. As the requirements from flexibility and reliability, workflow definition {{is no longer}} stationary, and the route of transaction (workflow instance) may be modified dynamically during implementing period. Therefore a multi-class, multi-chain open queue-network model is very appropriate to simulate the process of workflow at an abstract level. In spite of significant progress in other aspects of workflow technology, it is oppositely lacking in methods about evaluating and analysing workflow system. In this issue, BCMP (Baskett, Chandy, Muntz and Palacios) theorem is imported {{for the first time}} to help analyse the queue network of WfMS, though it has been widely used in communication networks field. With its help, the influence from process reengineering is possible to be studied and predicted in performance aspect. An simple demonstration is provided to show how to analyse the <b>thruput</b> with BCMP in practice...|$|E

40|$|Part 1 of {{this thesis}} {{concerns}} characterization of catalyst materials prepared by an ion beam implanter {{and by a}} multiple expansion cluster source. Ion beam synthesis was carried out on a 250 keV ion implanter. After assembling a special reaction chamber, zeolites were implanted with phosphorous and iron. This work contributed to development of a sputter reactor for ion beam synthesis. ^ Silver catalysts were examined in a reactor designed, built and evaluated for catalysts produced by the sputter reactor and by a multiple expansion cluster source. Small surface area silver foil catalysts and silver cluster catalysts showed kinetic activity for epoxidation of ethylene. The turnover numbers and selectivities calculated from these data agree with literature values for unpromoted silver catalysts. Positive results for the small surface area silver cluster catalyst demonstrate the feasibility of studying these catalysts with the special reactor. ^ Part 2 concerns fundamentals and applications of secondary ion mass spectrometry. It also describes a computer interface for a secondary ion mass spectrometer. SIMS was successfully applied to non-volatile, thermally labile organic dyes. Both precharged and neutral dyes showed structurally informative fragmentation and medium to high intensity molecular cations. Desorption of dyes from thin layer and paper chromatographic media was demonstrated. ^ A counterion effect was investigated using perrhenate salts. Neat ammonium perrhenate and lithium perrhenate displayed significant fragmentation by loss of an oxygen atom. Sodium, potassium and rubidium perrhenate salts did not show significant fragmentation. Physical mixtures of neat perrhenate salts with chloride salts of other alkali cations showed complete mixing of the cations on a microscopic level and suppresion of fragmentation by larger cations. ^ A data system was implemented for a secondary ion mass spectrometer which involved design and construction of a computer interface. Software routines for the interface were written in assembly language for increased operation efficiency. Simplicity and ease of operation were stressed in the design. The system provides for data storage and output. The SIMS interface increases <b>thruput</b> by reducing the required acquisition time. ...|$|E
