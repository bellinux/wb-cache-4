This came after repeated confidence votes that resulted in the NDP and Bloc parties not voting in favour of the government, and the Liberal Party voting in favour or not attending the vote. Rumours of a possible fall election were further fuelled by Harper's announcement of a fourth federal by-election for September 22 in the Toronto riding of Don Valley West.|$|E

It was a costume drama and it needed a costume drama budget, and it didn't get that.|$|R

It was early December before {{a small portion of}} the payment finally arrived. Much of the food supplies were spoiled and only a small percentage of the payment arrived.

They returned to their home territories under peril: aside from being weak from sickness and hunger, the Ojibwe <b>had</b> not expected <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> such a winter journey. As a result, 200-230 more Ojibwe died before reaching their homes by the following January.|$|R

In this issue of Critical Care, two authors debate the appropriateness of providing life support in accordance with a family's wishes to an individual who is unlikely to survive admission to the intensive care unit.

The report {{went on to say that}} in order to stem (or at least slow) the growth of slums in the world's cities, countries are going <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> some hard choices and make major financial commitments (with the help of the World Bank, a major player in the worldwide effort to promote slum upgrading) in order to accomplish the Millennium Development Goals towards lifting significant number of slum dwellers out of poverty.|$|R

5000|$|In {{creating}} {{her male}} leads, Hand gave Tucker and Christian numerous similarities, believing that {{doing so would}} make for a challenging love triangle. [...] "I think one reason why I created Christian Prescott and Tucker Avery to both essentially be good, decent people, was because I wanted Clara <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> real choice. It would have been easier, I think, if {{when she came to}} her big decision, one guy was kind of a jerk and one wasn't," [...] she said. Despite the commonalities, Hand feels that the characters are distinguished by their flaws, with Christian being overly privileged, and Tucker, at times, being stubborn and prideful. The author took a similar approach in creating her protagonist. [...] "Clara is flawed, but I think that gives her room to grow as a person throughout the series." ...|$|E
25|$|As per Smith's and Strachey's reports, Dr. David Beers Quinn {{theorized that}} the colonists moved north to {{integrate}} with the Chesepians that Chief Powhatan claimed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> killed. <b>To</b> <b>make</b> the journey northward, Quinn {{believed that they}} used the pinnace and other small boats to transport themselves and their belongings.

5000|$|Commodity Futures form an {{advanced}} clearing function {{for the physical}} commodity clearing. Each Futures contract would generate a particular pattern of cash flow and cash commitment at a given price between the counterparties. In a Futures contract, payments are being made all along {{the life of the}} contract, whenever the Futures price changes. This is called [...] "mark to market". Concretely, these payments involve additions and subtractions from [...] "margin accounts" [...] held at the Futures clearinghouse. It is significant that both the long and short side have to put up margin, because at the moment the contract is entered, both are in a sense equally likely to lose and so equally likely <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> payment to the other side. By means of Margin Calls, Commodity Futures shifts future imbalances between cash inflows and outflows into the present. Financial crisis in the present can also arise when these future imbalances get so large that they disrupt the present.|$|E
50|$|There {{was plenty}} of action further down the field, with Ralf Schumacher taking third, despite a late pit-stop to replace a damaged tyre. Trulli {{followed}} up his promising times earlier in the weekend by holding off the Jordan of Giancarlo Fisichella for fourth position. Behind Fisichella, Heinz-Harald Frentzen took sixth place, although {{had it not been}} for a fuel rig problem that necessitated an extra pit-stop, he could well have taken fourth. Rubens Barrichello's disappointing weekend ended with seventh position, after making a second pit-stop to repair damage caused by smashing into Räikkönen at the chicane, in a move that put the McLaren driver out of the race. Nick Heidfeld took eighth, ahead of the Jaguars of Eddie Irvine and Pedro de la Rosa. Minardi's Mark Webber had been on target for a top ten finish, only <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> late pit-stop which dropped him to eleventh. Enrique Bernoldi was the twelfth and last finisher, despite damaging his car in a clash with Massa and incurring a drive-through penalty for cutting the chicane.|$|E
5000|$|The {{ending of}} the film was changed from the book. Morris West said:Structurally {{speaking}} I've always thought The Shoes of the Fisherman {{was one of my}} weaker books. It wanders too much. The script for the film is tighter, more direct and I think it says in a stronger way part of what I wanted to say in the novel. We've come to a point in history where men - black or white, Marxist or capitalist, christian or non christian - are going <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> choice. They're either going to have to commit themselves to an act of love for each other or an act of hate for each other. Men on each side have to say: [...] "Look we're all brothers. Why do we kill each other in the streets? Don't lets drop the atomic bomb. Let's talk for one hour more." [...] Today this is the real triumph of good over evil. It's what i've tried to put into the last speech for the film.|$|E

What he meant way back then was that there should be an expectation that some sacrifices will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be made, in our generation, so that future generations can have the opportunities that we've <b>had</b> <b>to</b> grow and thrive and prosper, so that our private sector can do what a private sector does best in creating jobs. So, yeah, with some practical things that <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be made, some decisions here, with perhaps changing, in future years, not adversely affecting those who are reliant on retirement benefits today, for instance, Social Security benefits, but changing, perhaps, the eligibility in future years. That <b>has</b> <b>to</b> be something that we're brave enough, courageous enough, to start talking about." ...|$|R
