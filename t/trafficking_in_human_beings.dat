40|$|This book is {{the first}} {{academic}} study entirely devoted to Liverpool labouring-class poet and activist Edward Rushton (1756 - 1814), whose name {{was for a long}} time only associated with the foundation of the Royal School for the Blind in 1791. A former sailor, tavern keeper and editor of a paper, as of the turbulent 1790 s Rushton owned a bookshop that was a hub of intense networking with many radical writers and intellectuals. His long-lasting, consistent commitment to the most pressing debates enflaming the Age of Revolution led him to question naval impressment and British repression in Ireland, the Napoleonic wars lacerating Europe and, most prominently, both the transatlantic <b>traffic</b> <b>in</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> and the institution of slavery as such. A dedicated and unrelenting campaigner {{at the time of the}} dawning human rights discourse, Rushton was both a perceptive scrutinizer of the mechanisms of power and repression, and a remarkably complex poetic voice, fully consequent to his politics. In this book his work is the object of new and long-due critical enquiry, especially appropriate in the year that marks the bicentennial anniversary of his death. The opening up of eighteenth-century and Romantic studies to cross-disciplinary interchange allows for a more nuanced historical and critical investigation of previously erased or neglected individual and collective experiences. This expanding critical space, which highlights the systemic discursive interaction of culture, politics and society, constitutes the conceptual and methodological frame for what is intended as a comprehensive critical re-evaluation of the writer...|$|R
40|$|This essay, {{first of}} all, seeks to answer {{questions}} related {{to the problem of}} the <b>traffic</b> of migrants <b>in</b> Europe: are there organised criminal groups active in the continent who concern themselves with human trafficking and if so which groups? How do they organise their traffic? Which routes are most widely used in order to perform this criminal activity? These questions will be dealt with under a particular light: while answering them, the author will try to give a framework, though very general, of the role played in these scenarios by Western, Central and Eastern European states, sometimes as sending, sometimes as transit or destination countries. The analysis is also projected towards the comprehension of those which are the most common illicit conducts performed by organised criminals while trafficking migrants. Since the beginning, it seems noteworthy to highlight a particular point of view under which the phenomenon of <b>traffic</b> <b>in</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> can be analysed and which can explain why in this context the attention of the author is mainly focused on well-organised criminal groups. There appears to be reason to believe that this illegal traffic, when it involves organised criminal organisations, is very dangerous especially because it links an international criminal dimension to a local one. In fact, the more the traffic is organised, the more it seems to exist in illegal circuits that, starting from the traffic of migrants, come to the exploitation of these people in the local criminal markets of the destination countries. It is to say that very often trafficked people, once arrived in their host countries, are pushed by the organised trafficking groups into deviant or criminal markets, such as those of drug pushing, prostitution, begging or theft, very often as a mechanism for repaying the cost of being smuggled. The second part of this essay sets some guidelines in order to build up a feasible and comprehensive strategy, at the European regional level, to fight the international migrant <b>trafficking.</b> <b>In</b> particular, it suggests to design some countryby-country tailor-made interventions. The devising of such instruments should not only be focused on criminal law but should start from a consideration: some Central and Eastern European countries are the main sending countries or seem to be chosen as transit places from which to gather migrants before moving on towards the West; while Western European countries, on their part, are mainly receivers of illegal migration flow...|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{deals with}} the issue of early warning in {{maritime}} safety. The goal of this chapter is to compare what sort of safety culture and what level of transborder cooperation have been developed in two similar maritime areas of Europe: the North Adriatic and the Gulf of Finland. The first section outlines and discusses different scientific approaches to the sea and safety culture with reference to maritime spaces, as analysed in the relevant literature. The second section summarises the situation of maritime safety in the North Adriatic, by presenting its basic physical features, traffic volumes and routes, types of risks, and characteristics of social actors involved. In the third section the same kind of data is offered with reference to the case study of the Gulf of Finland. The fourth section concludes this chapter by focussing on the comparison between the two case studies areas. Similarities and differences are underlined, with a particular care given to the issue of transborder cooperation, among the three neighbouring countries in both sea areas, in the field of civil and environmental protection. With this chapter, the authors approach the issues of security, safety and related problems in terms of functions usually performed by public institutions and traditionally part of the public policy. However, they state, the change of welfare and its growing costs, combined with the higher and more sensitive status of security/safety issues bring the civil protection and disaster reduction right to the centre of the political debate. Moreover, the new faces of international terrorism, the changing environmental conditions and the increased criminal activities connected with mobility patterns (illegal migrations, slavery and prostitution, smuggling, <b>trafficking</b> <b>in</b> <b>human</b> <b>being,</b> illegal weapons trade) progressively erase the border line between civil and military spheres of security and {{set the stage for a}} larger and all encompassing notion of safety. According to the authors, today there is no unambiguous definition of either the concept or the substance of safety or safety culture. In EU documents and practices the notion of civil safety is used in more restricted or larger fashions, without much consistency: sometimes it is understood as part of larger concepts as civil security and in other occasions is referred to in more traditional ways as the number of rescue activities in exceptional situations like emergencies, crisis, catastrophes and natural/man made disasters.

The negative consequences arising from the security-political situation, complemented by the refugee crisis in the Balkans, which highly depend on the geo-strategic position of the Balkan countries, often referred to as a destroyer of the equilibrium factor for security in this region. A qualitative approach will be used in this paper, using analysis of the current scientific literature, academic publications and scientific papers which are dealing with detecting, identifying, researching and preventing the illegal activities in the Balkan Route, as well as assessments of some international organizations about the numbers of crimes and perpetrators in this corridor. The practical aim of the paper is to enable the way of eradicating crime by international security cooperation among all transit countries in the "Balkan Route".

40|$|Introduction: Illegal {{trafficking}} of <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> is {{a social}} and economic phenomenon {{which is to be}} combated seriously. Acute renal failure <b>in</b> <b>trafficked</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> is not common and usually results from prerenal failure. Case Series: This paper describes a group of illegal immigrants brought into the emergency department (ED) after being arrested by the police as victims of human trafficking. The group consisted of 20 young males around their twenties. They were all dehydrated and malnourished after a long journey allegedly suffered in a truck trailer. Thirteen out of 160 were reportedly dead in the whole group. Vital signs were within normal limits in all. Nine cases were found to be confused on admission, including seven with high renal function test values (BUN and creatinine). Three cases had creatinine levels higher than 4 mEq/L. These cases with acute prerenal failure were aggressively and successfully treated with volume replacement. One patient was admitted to the internal medicine ward, while others were treated in the ED for prerenal failure. Some others were vaccinated against tetanus due to cuts in extremities. After stabilization and proper treatment, the patients recovered within several days and were discharged without any sequelae. Conclusion: Clinicians should not overlook the possibility of acute prerenal failure resulting from volume depletion and malnutrition in patients subjected to illegal journeys lasting for weeks in the context of trafficking of humans. Aggressive rehydration and other supportive measures are mainstay points in the emergency management...|$|R
40|$|Highly {{original}} and innovative work that analyses conventional {{crime and the}} crimes committed by powerful individuals and groups. Examines crimes in the street, illicit drugs and drug-related offences, crimes of the elite including corruption and corporate crime. This book examines a range of criminal activities conducted in different European contexts. Offences committed by individuals and groups endowed with different resources and status are examined. Each chapter contains an implicit rejection of generalizations and {{attention is paid to}} variations and differences. Rather than searching for a unified theory of crime, the author highlights the interpretive oscillations, which always occur when we are faced with criminal behaviour. In other words, each time we subscribe to one cause of crime we may realize that also the opposite cause possesses some reasonable validity. The originality of this book consists of the 'causality of contraries' running through the chapters, whereby a tentative aetiology identified in one context finds its complete overturning in anther. The author regards the 'causality of contraries' as a crucial aspect of the anti-criminological tradition to which he claims affiliation. These 'essays in anti-criminology' deal with crimes of both the powerless and the powerful, and seek to demonstrate that both the deficiency and the abundance of legitimate opportunities may lead to crime. In {{the first part of the}} book a conventional criminal activity par excellence is examined, namely activity related to the economy of illicit drugs. In this economy the author notes a shift from a Fordist to a Toyota model of criminal activity, a shift determined by the expansion of demand and the growing variety of supply of illicit drugs. The second part of the book addresses specific cases of elite criminality, including illicit <b>trafficking</b> <b>in</b> arms and <b>human</b> <b>beings.</b> The chapters devoted to the analysis of political and administrative corruption in Italy, France, and Britain provide yet other examples of how illegal practices may be imputed to one cause in one context and its opposite in another.

Bachelor work {{is about}} {{regulation}} <b>in</b> <b>trafficking</b> of <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> <b>in</b> Latvia {{as it is}} an up – to date topic. The trafficking of people has become a global industry and serious transnational criminal phenomenon. Trafficking is organized criminal transportation of people within the country or abroad {{through the use of}} violence that is supported and implemented through purposeful actions on the part of individuals and organizations. In this project the main objectives are to look at the problem and make analysis of criminal regulation and jurisprudential precedents <b>in</b> <b>human</b> <b>trafficking.</b> My research draws on a wide variety sources, including laws, jurisdiction, monographies, materials prepared by multinational organizations and human rights reports. The term “human trafficking” is usually translated as trade in people. It is not an exact definition, because trafficking includes transportation, relocation, recruitment, hiding and commissioning. The key idea in definition is not so mach the fact of trade in persons as use of violence and fraud. Latvia is one of countries taking an active role in efforts to curb human trafficking; besides this process is clearly progressing. However, there is complacent attitude toward the phenomenon of human smuggling because trade of <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> {{is considered to be a}} serious type of crime, including complexity of this problem as a composite of a labour problem, illegal transplantation, and consequence of regional conflict within the country borders, illegal immigration and sexual exploitation. In criminal legislation of Latvia, there is regulation that defines the term human trafficking and provides punishment for such activities. Article 154. 1 of The Criminal law makes human trafficking a crime, but article 165. 1 focus on the sexual dimensions of human trafficking. These articles are in accordance with the international standards stipulated in The United Nation. In Latvia, there are official commentaries provided concerning implementation of the law. Courts generally rely on them in interpreting the law. To combat human trafficking effectively a comprehensive strategy needs to be developed and the crucial first step is to criminalizing <b>trafficking</b> of <b>human</b> <b>beings.</b> <b>In</b> some countries, there is no antitrafficking legislation. However, because of the difficulty in proving such cases, there is the lack of jurisprudential precedents. Analysis of jurisprudential precedents shows dissimilar understanding about qualification of crime. Criminal law is one of the most intrusive instruments in the hands of state authorities to recover, combat this problem and provide punishment. ...|$|R

25|$|In the UK, human {{trafficking}} cases are processed {{by the same}} officials to simultaneously determine the refugee and trafficking victim statuses of a person. However, criteria for qualifying as a refugee and a trafficking victim differ and they have different needs for staying in a country. A person may need assistance as a trafficking victim but his/her circumstances may not necessarily meet the threshold for asylum. In which case, not being granted refugee status affects their status as a trafficked victim and thus their ability to receive help. Reviews of the statistics from the National Referral Mechanism (NRM), a tool created by the Council of Europe Convention on Action against <b>Trafficking</b> <b>in</b> <b>Human</b> <b>Beings</b> (CoE Convention) to help states effectively identify and care for trafficking victims, found that positive decisions for non-European Union citizens were much {{lower than that of}} EU and UK citizens.

High refusal rates of non-EU people point to possible stereotypes and biases about regions and countries of origin which may hinder anti-trafficking efforts, since the asylum system is linked to the trafficking victim protection system.|$|E
