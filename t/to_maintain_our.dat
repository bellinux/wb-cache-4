In a January 2015 tenth-anniversary retrospective, Gamaliel emphasized that further improvements to the newspaper depended on collaboration and involvement by the Wikipedia community and invited users to contribute suggestions and join the editing team. In their first issue of the newspaper as editors-in-chief, Go Phightins! and Gamaliel wrote about the unique role of The Signpost: [...] "We will strive <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>our</b> voice and standing as an independent entity, separate from the WMF, Wikimedia chapters, WikiEd, or other entities." ...|$|E

Kekal owns the copyrights of the band's recording masters and has 100% artistic control over music, production and artwork. Kekal has recorded and produced most of its albums in its own studio/workstation, manages the band itself, does its own photo sessions, and designs its own album artwork and covers. As Jeff stated, [...] "So far, we've been known as an independent band who never want to get signed by record label, <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>our</b> independency and control over our artistic freedom, and also to own our recording masters and copyright.. Instead of band signing, we always prefer to license our finished albums to record labels." ...|$|E

Disraeli's expansionist foreign policy, which Victoria endorsed, led to conflicts such as the Anglo-Zulu War and the Second Anglo-Afghan War. [...] "If we are <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>our</b> position as a first-rate Power", she wrote, [...] "we must... be Prepared for attacks and wars, somewhere or other, CONTINUALLY." [...] Victoria saw the expansion of the British Empire as civilising and benign, protecting native peoples from more aggressive powers or cruel rulers: [...] "It is not in our custom to annexe countries", she said, [...] "unless we are obliged & forced to do so." [...] To Victoria's dismay, Disraeli lost the 1880 general election, and Gladstone returned as prime minister.

[...] Addressing the faster rate at which defenders could reinforce an area than attackers could penetrate it during the First World War, Guderian wrote that [...] "since reserve forces will now be motorized, the building up of new defensive fronts is easier {{than it used to}} be; the chances of an offensive based on the timetable of artillery and infantry co-operation are, as a result, even slighter today {{than they were in the}} last war." [...] He continued, [...] "We believe that by attacking with tanks we can achieve a higher rate of movement than has been hitherto obtainable, and—what is perhaps even more important—that we can keep moving once a breakthrough has been made." [...] Guderian additionally required that tactical radios be widely used to facilitate co-ordination and command by having one installed in all tanks.|$|E
