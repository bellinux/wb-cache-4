25|$|The {{first step}} in {{preprocessing}} is conventionally slice timing correction. The MR scanner acquires different slices within a single brain volume at different times, and hence <b>the</b> <b>slices</b> represent brain activity at different timepoints. Since this complicates later analysis, a timing correction is applied to bring all slices to the same timepoint reference. This is done by assuming the timecourse of a voxel is smooth when plotted as a dotted line. Hence the voxel's intensity value at other times not in the sampled frames can be calculated by filling in the dots to create a continuous curve.|$|E
2500|$|It {{is obvious}} from the {{generators}} just given that <b>the</b> <b>slices</b> [...] admit a transitive abelian three-dimensional transformation group, so a quotient of the solution can be reinterpreted as a stationary cylindrically symmetric solution. Less obviously, <b>the</b> <b>slices</b> [...] admit an SL(2,R) action, and <b>the</b> <b>slices</b> [...] admit a Bianchi III (c.f. the fourth Killing vector field). We can restate this by saying that our symmetry group includes as three-dimensional subgroups examples of Bianchi types I, III and VIII. Four of the five Killing vectors, {{as well as the}} curvature tensor, do not depend upon the coordinate y. Indeed, the Gödel solution is the Cartesian product of a factor R with a three-dimensional Lorentzian manifold (signature -++).|$|E

30|$|All these {{functionalities}} {{are assigned}} to links of <b>slices.</b> <b>The</b> <b>slice</b> switch and <b>the</b> <b>slice</b> gateway transport data from a source link to a target link (the relationship is 1 to 1). <b>The</b> <b>slice</b> multiplexer and demultiplexer works on multiple links on one side (the Nto 1 or 1 toN relationship).

2500|$|According to 18th century writers, {{in parts}} of Scotland there was another ritual {{involving}} the oatmeal cake.

2500|$|When {{encoding}} {{colors in}} a hue/lightness/chroma or hue/value/chroma model (using the definitions {{from the previous}} two sections) model, not all combinations of lightness (or value) and chroma are meaningful: that is, half of the colors denotable using , , and [...] fall outside the RGB gamut (the gray parts of <b>the</b> <b>slices</b> in figure 14). The creators of these models considered this a problem for some uses. For example, in a color selection interface {{with two of the}} dimensions in a rectangle and the third on a slider, half of that rectangle is made of unused space. Now imagine we have a slider for lightness: the user’s intent when adjusting this slider is potentially ambiguous: how should the software deal with out-of-gamut colors? Or conversely, If the user has selected as colorful as possible a dark purple [...] and then shifts the lightness slider upward, what should be done: would the user prefer to see a lighter purple still as colorful as possible for the given hue and lightness [...] or a lighter purple of exactly the same chroma as the original color ...|$|E
2500|$|Fontana often {{lined the}} reverse of his canvases with black gauze so that the {{darkness}} would shimmer behind the open cuts and create a mysterious sense of illusion and depth. He then created an elaborate neon ceiling called [...] "Luce spaziale" [...] in 1951 for the Triennale in Milan. In his important series of Concetto spaziale, La Fine di Dio (1963–64), Fontana uses the egg shape. With his Pietre (stones) series, begun in 1952, Fontana fused the sculptural with painting by encrusting the surfaces of his canvases with heavy impasto and colored glass. In his Buchi (holes) cycle, begun in 1949-50, he punctured {{the surface of his}} canvases, breaking the membrane of two-dimensionality in order to highlight the space behind the picture. From 1958 he purified his paintings by creating matte, monochrome surfaces, thus focusing the viewer’s attention on <b>the</b> <b>slices</b> that rend the skin of the canvas. In 1959 Fontana exhibited cut-off paintings with multiple combinable elements (he named the sets quanta), and began Nature, a series of sculptures made by cutting a gash across a sphere of terracotta clay, which he subsequently cast in bronze.|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, we analyze {{a variant}} of <b>the</b> <b>slice</b> {{spectral}} sequence of [HHR (or SSS) called <b>the</b> regular <b>slice</b> spectral sequence (or RSSS).
