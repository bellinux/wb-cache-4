30|$|Similar to {{the case}} of the firstborn {{daughter}}, the second daughter also increases the likelihood of having <b>a</b> <b>third</b> child. The effect, however, is smaller than that of the firstborn girl. Parents of a second daughter are 1.7 percentage points more likely <b>to</b> have <b>a</b> <b>third</b> child. Further, while parents with two sons are 1.2 percentage points less likely <b>to</b> have <b>a</b> <b>third</b> child, parents with two girls are 4.5 percentage points more likely <b>to</b> have <b>a</b> <b>third</b> child. This also shows that parents of a mix of male and female children are 2.4 percentage points less likely <b>to</b> have <b>a</b> <b>third</b> child relative <b>to</b> parents of same-sex children.|$|R

5|$|A {{group is}} a {{mathematical}} structure consisting {{of a set of}} objects together with a binary operation, that is, an operation combining any two objects <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>third,</b> subject to certain requirements. A group in which the objects are matrices and the group operation is matrix multiplication is called a matrix group. Since in a group every element has to be invertible, the most general matrix groups are the groups of all invertible matrices of a given size, called the general linear groups.|$|E
5|$|Another common {{progressive}} alignment method called T-Coffee is {{slower than}} Clustal and its derivatives but generally produces more accurate alignments for distantly related sequence sets. T-Coffee calculates pairwise alignments {{by combining the}} direct alignment of the pair with indirect alignments that aligns each sequence of the pair <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> sequence. It uses the output from Clustal as well as another local alignment program LALIGN, which finds multiple regions of local alignment between two sequences. The resulting alignment and phylogenetic tree are used {{as a guide to}} produce new and more accurate weighting factors.|$|E
5|$|As the February 29 trade {{deadline}} approached, Reimer's {{future with}} the rebuilding Maple Leafs became uncertain. On February 27, 2016, {{two days before}} the deadline, Reimer was traded to the San Jose Sharks, alongside Jeremy Morin, in exchange for Alex Stalock, Ben Smith and a conditional fourth round pick in the 2018 draft (condition dependent on the Sharks reaching the Stanley Cup Finals; condition met and pick was converted <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> round pick on May 25, 2016).|$|E

5|$|By {{the late}} 1820s Jennings was {{critically}} short of cash. He depended on income from political office {{to pay his}} expenses. His farm was not likely to provide sufficient financial support. Because the thirty-eight-year-old Jennings was prohibited by law from running for reelection <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> term as Indiana governor in 1823, {{he was forced to}} consider other political options. Jennings decided to return to Congress.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, the U.S. {{ratified}} the 22nd Amendment, making a president ineligible for election <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> term or for election {{to a second}} full term after serving more than two remaining years of a term of a previously elected president. The latter clause would have applied to Truman's situation in 1952 except that a grandfather clause in the amendment explicitly excluded the amendment from applying to the incumbent president.|$|E

The employee responsible was fired by the company and the BBC considered further legal action.|$|E
5|$|Production of Star Trek began {{three years}} before release under Tom Lesinski at Paramount Digital Entertainment. Lesinkski had a {{background}} in video game production, having previously worked at companies such as Crystal Dynamics, Ion Storm and Kuju Entertainment. He {{made the decision to}} produce a game in-house, rather than licensing it out <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> party as had previously been the case under the previous ten-year Activision contract. As a result, the game was the first ever to be produced and released by Paramount Studios directly.|$|E

He faced one opponent in the Democratic primary on August 26: lifelong Republican and Washington, D.C. resident H.

Paige was also unsuccessful in that effort, losing by 80% to 20%.|$|E
