Afterwards, Michael is disappointed the woman who lost her glove does not show up and tells the employees they can go home early, but the empathetic staff decide to stay and later encourage Michael to leave with them.|$|E

One of his methods {{was to have}} a waiter pass a note <b>to</b> <b>pretty</b> girls in his restaurants saying that he admired them and {{would like to have a}} quiet dinner with them sometime. Many then went on to become his customers, and some his lovers. His easy manners, charisma and exotic appeal meant that he was able to build up a large female clientele that was close to a fan club. In order to distance himself from the actual transaction, the goods and money were exchanged over a high wall so that the parties were invisible to each other.|$|E

After the loss Roma and Orndorff went their separate ways, wrestling in singles matches. Paul Roma was asked to help make WCW newcomer Alex Wright look good at SuperBrawl V.

Roma would find himself in WCW management's doghouse for complaining about having to job to Alex Wright, per Pro Wrestling Torch. Roma continued appearing in WCW, teaming with Paul Orndorff two nights later in a losing effort against Dustin Rhodes & Johnny B Badd at a WCW Pro taping.

500|$|American novelist Henry James, {{one member}} of this {{literary}} elite, referred to Austen several times with approval and on one occasion ranked her with Shakespeare, Cervantes, and Henry Fielding as among [...] "the fine painters of life". But, James thought Austen an [...] "unconscious" [...] artist whom he described as [...] "instinctive and charming". In 1905, James responded frustratingly to {{what he described as}} [...] "a beguiled infatuation" [...] with Austen, a rising tide of public interest that exceeded Austen's [...] "intrinsic merit and interest". James attributed this rise principally to [...] "the stiff breeze of the [...] special bookselling [...] body of publishers, editors, illustrators, producers of the pleasant twaddle of magazines; who have found their 'dear,' our dear, everybody's dear, Jane so infinitely to their material purpose, so amenable <b>to</b> <b>pretty</b> reproduction in every variety of what is called tasteful, and in what seemingly proves to be salable, form." ...|$|E
500|$|Slap-Happy was {{considered}} more varied than previous L7 albums. Although the album features several songs with aggressive guitar riffs that {{are reminiscent of}} the band's previous releases, {{as seen in the}} tracks [...] "On My Rockin' Machine", [...] "Long Green" [...] and [...] "Mantra Down", it also contains slow-paced and guitar-driven ballads like [...] "Livin' Large" [...] and [...] "Freezer Burn". The former song was described by Marc Weingarten of Rolling Stone as [...] "a kind of rallying cry for the indie-rock underclass", while the latter was seen as a melodic song that [...] "juxtaposes harsh words delivered in mellow, floating vocals." [...] Slap-Happy also contains songs that borrow elements from genres other than rock. For example, the song [...] "Little One" [...] contains elements of both polka and country music. As Sparks noted, [...] "We're all into all kinds of music, but I listen to very little rock, actually. Our approach was <b>to</b> <b>pretty</b> much do what we've always done, but we're not concerned with sticking with a particular style. There's diversity in our songwriting." ...|$|E

[...] In a simultaneous review of The Simpsons episode [...] "Stealing First Base" [...] and The Cleveland Show episode [...] "Once Upon a Tyne in New York" [...] that preceded [...] "Peter-assment", Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V.
