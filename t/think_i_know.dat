Having dignity is something you work on your whole life, in how you treat people and how you treat yourself. I hope I always strive to have it." [...] She continued, [...] "It's not {{something that you can}} be given or that you can just get or that you're born with. It's something that you have to work on." ...|$|E
500|$|Richardson {{began the}} 1960s with a failure. Enid Bagnold's play The Last Joke was savaged by the critics ("a {{meaningless}} jumble of pretentious whimsy" [...] was one description). His {{only reason for}} playing in the piece was the chance of acting with Gielgud, but both men quickly regretted their involvement. Richardson {{then went to the}} US to appear in Sidney Lumet's film adaptation of Long Day's Journey into Night, alongside Katharine Hepburn. Lumet later recalled how little guidance Richardson needed. Once, the director went into lengthy detail about the playing of a scene, and when he had finished, Richardson said, [...] "Ah, I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> what you want – a little more flute and a little less cello". After that, Lumet was sparing with suggestions. Richardson was jointly awarded the Cannes Film Festival's Best Actor prize with his co-stars Jason Robards Jr and Dean Stockwell.|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} on Australian Music Online Blaik listed his favourite Australian artists, and specified some of their attributes or albums: INXS and their lead singer Michael Hutchence's ability [...] "to create so much power and emotion"; Powderfinger's dedication and uniqueness, and Odyssey Number Five which had [...] "everything that I love about Powderfinger"; Crowded House especially Neil Finn's song writing capabilities; Silverchair's Diorama which was [...] "a journey from beginning to end"; The Cruel Sea's live performances; and End of Fashion's self-titled debut album, which he opined [...] "represent to us a place that {{we would want to}} be in the near future." [...] He also acknowledged AC/DC, especially their Back in Black album, as being highly influential, claiming [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> a single musician who doesn't have this record and this band in their record collection", and asking [...] "How can you not be inspired by this band?" ...|$|E
500|$|The Simpsons creator Matt Groening {{has stated}} that Azaria {{possesses}} the ability to turn unfunny lines {{into some of the}} best in an episode, while former writer Jay Kogen stated: [...] "Just when I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> [...] bag of tricks, he's always got a new thing he does to surprise me." [...] Throughout the run of The Simpsons, Azaria has had to sing in character several times, a task which he describes as easier than singing normally. The Smurfs writer David N. Weiss says Azaria [...] "has a beautiful treasure trove of talent", and [...] "became what you wished you were writing". Playwright Jenelle Riley wrote in 2005 that Azaria was [...] "by far" [...] her favorite actor, praising his [...] "versatility" [...] and [...] "tendency to take small roles that would normally fade into the background and to consistently create characters people care about", noting his roles in Shattered Glass, Mystery, Alaska and especially [...]|$|E
500|$|Verity {{earned the}} respect of Bradman, {{generally}} regarded as the greatest batsman to have played cricket, and enjoyed bowling at him. Bradman described Verity as a great cricketer and wrote that throughout their respective careers, he [...] "grew {{more and more to}} respect [...] both as a gentleman and as a player." [...] Robertson-Glasgow thought that Verity was [...] "one of only three or four bowlers who came to the battle with Bradman on not unequal terms". During the 17 Tests in which they faced each other, Verity dismissed Bradman eight times, more than any other bowler. Robertson-Glasgow believed that, but for Verity, Bradman would have averaged over 150 in Tests instead of his actual batting average. In all first-class cricket, Verity dismissed Bradman 10 times in total, on two occasions twice in the same game. Only Clarrie Grimmett equalled 10 first-class dismissals of Bradman. However, Bradman once said: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> all about Clarrie (Grimmett), but with Hedley I am never sure. You see, there's no breaking-point with him." ...|$|E

500|$|A half-measure {{complicates the}} metre of the verses, {{as well as}} the fact that the vocals begin {{in the middle of the}} first measure. The first verse comes after the refrain, and is eight {{measures}} long. The verse (for example [...] "Always, no sometimes ...") starts with an F major chord in the key of B (or E chord in the key of A) (V), which progresses to G minor, the submediant, a deceptive cadence. According to Alan Pollack, the [...] "approach-avoidance tactic" [...] (i.e., the deceptive cadence) is encountered in the verse, as the leading-tone, A, appearing on the words [...] "Always know", [...] "I know when", [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> of thee" [...] and [...] "I think I disagree", never resolves into a I chord (A in A key) directly as expected. Instead, at the end of the verse, the leading note, harmonised as part of the dominant chord, resolves to the prevailing tonic (B) at the end of the verse, after tonicizing the subdominant (IV) E chord, on [...] "disagree".|$|E
500|$|Hobart was {{a strong}} {{supporter}} of the gold standard; and insisted on it remaining {{a major part of the}} Republican campaign even in the face of Bryan's surge. [...] In his speech responding to the formal notification of his convention victory, Hobart stated, [...] "An honest dollar, worth 100 cents everywhere, cannot be coined out of 53 cents worth of silver plus a legislative fiat. Such a debasement of our currency would inevitably produce incalculable loss, appalling disaster, and National dishonor." [...] McKinley was not as strong a supporter of the gold standard as Hobart, and considered modifying some of Hobart's expressed views on the gold standard before the acceptance was printed for public distribution. [...] Hobart insisted on it being printed without change, writing, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> the sentiment of Eastern men better than you can, and with this knowledge and my convictions I must retain the statements as I have written them." [...] According to Connolly, [...] "Though a protectionist, Hobart believed the money issue, not tariffs, led to a November Republican victory, and, in denouncing silver, his rhetoric far outstripped [...] William McKinley." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} of Lyons' first {{interview}} with the gardaí, he was staying at the Salvation Army hostel in Grangegorman. Detective Garda William Mullis and Garda Joseph O'Connor approached {{him as he was}} leaving the hostel. They reported that Lyons said: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> what this is about". The gardaí brought Lyons to the Bridewell garda station, and interviewed him in the doctor's room. According to the gardaí, at one point during the interview, Lyons burst out crying and said that he had killed the two women. Lyons claimed that he was suffering withdrawal symptoms at the time and that he made the admission so that he could get more drugs. He said that Garda O'Connor had promised that the sooner he confessed, the sooner he would be released from custody and that he [...] "wasn't thinking straight". The gardaí say that he was told that he was not under arrest and that he could leave at any time. As a result of his confession, Dean Lyons was arrested on suspicion of murdering the two women at 13:46 on 26 July 1997.|$|E

[...] Up until 1860 Leskov resided with members of his family (and that of Alexander Scott) in Raisky, Penza Governorate.

However, the police were unable to identify the couple in question.

2500|$|Butler's {{last line}} in Gone with the Wind, [...] "Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn," [...] {{is one of}} the most famous lines in movie history. Gable was an almost {{immediate}} favorite for the role of Rhett with both the public and producer David O. Selznick. Since Selznick had no male stars under long-term contract, though, he needed to go through the process of negotiating to borrow an actor from another studio. Gary Cooper was Selznick's first choice. When Cooper turned down the role of Butler, he was quoted as saying, [...] "Gone With the Wind is going to be the biggest flop in Hollywood history. I’m glad it'll be Clark Gable who's falling flat on his nose, not me." [...] By then, Selznick had become determined to hire Gable, and set about finding a way to borrow him from MGM. Gable was wary of potentially disappointing an audience that had decided that no one else could play the part. He later conceded, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> now how a fly must react after being caught in a spider's web." ...|$|E
2500|$|In October 2001, {{as soon as}} {{it became}} known that the Ames strain of anthrax had been used in the attacks, {{longtime}} anti-nuclear, anti-biological warfare defense activist Barbara Hatch Rosenberg and others began suggesting that the attack might be the work of a [...] "rogue CIA agent", and they provided the name of the [...] "most likely" [...] person to the FBI. On November 21, 2001, she made similar statements to the Biological and Toxic Weapons convention in Geneva. In December 2001, she published [...] "A Compilation of Evidence and Comments on the Source of the Mailed Anthrax" [...] via the web site of The Federation of American Scientists (FAS) suggesting the attacks were [...] "perpetrated with the unwitting assistance of a sophisticated government program". She discussed the case with reporters from The New York Times. On January 4, 2002, Nicholas Kristof of The New York Times published a column titled [...] "Profile of a Killer" [...] stating [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> who sent out the anthrax last fall." [...] For months, Rosenberg gave speeches and stated her beliefs to many reporters from around the world. She posted [...] "Analysis of the Anthrax Attacks" [...] to the FAS web site on January 17, 2002. On February 5, 2002, she published [...] "Is the FBI Dragging Its Feet?" [...] In response, the FBI stated, [...] "There is no prime suspect in this case at this time". The Washington Post reported, [...] "FBI officials over the last week have flatly discounted Dr. Rosenberg's claims". On June 13, 2002, Rosenberg posted [...] "The Anthrax Case: What the FBI Knows" [...] to the FAS site. [...] On June 18, 2002, Rosenberg presented her theories to senate staffers working for Senators Daschle and Leahy. One week later, on June 25, the FBI publicly searched Hatfill's apartment. He becomes a household name. [...] "The FBI also pointed out that Hatfill had agreed to the search and is not considered a suspect." [...] American Prospect and Salon.com report, [...] "Hatfill is not a suspect in the anthrax case, the FBI says." [...] On August 3, 2002, Rosenberg tells the media that the FBI asked her if [...] "a team of government scientists could be trying to frame Steven J. Hatfill". In August 2002, Attorney General John Ashcroft labeled Steven Hatfill a [...] "person of interest" [...] in a press conference, no charges were brought against him. Hatfill, a virologist, vehemently denied he {{had anything to do with}} the anthrax (bacteria) mailings and sued the FBI, the Justice Department, John Ashcroft, Alberto Gonzales, and others for violating his constitutional rights and for violating the Privacy Act. On June 27, 2008, the Department of Justice announced it would settle Hatfill's case for $5.8million.|$|E
