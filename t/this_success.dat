5|$|During {{its first}} week it added $13 million. <b>This</b> <b>success</b> led Fox to add 35 more screens the next weekend, the widest {{domestic}} distribution the film enjoyed. Although {{it was never}} any week's top-grossing film, it remained in the top 10 through July. Its theatrical run continued through December 10, shortly before the DVD release.|$|E
5|$|Following <b>this</b> <b>success,</b> Jackson {{began to}} direct several {{personal}} insults at Silva, {{a gesture that}} infuriated the champion. Silva {{was in the midst}} of what would be a 17-fight unbeaten streak. He captured the championship from Sakuraba at Pride 17, and defeated him a total of three times. Jackson continued his negative comments towards the champion, and directed his latest insult at Silva's training camp at the time, the Chute Boxe Academy.|$|E
5|$|Keegan took Newcastle to two {{consecutive}} runners-up finishes {{in the league}} in 1995–96 and 1996–97, coming very close to winning the title in the former season. <b>This</b> <b>success</b> was in part due to the talent of players like David Ginola, Les Ferdinand and Alan Shearer, who was signed on 30 July 1996 for a then world record fee of £15million.|$|E

Holloway left by mutual consent after less than a season at the club, being replaced by Nigel Pearson.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{earliest}} successes in the west was in controlling Icerya purchasi (cottony cushion scale) in Australia, using a predatory insect Rodolia cardinalis (the vedalia beetle). <b>This</b> <b>success</b> was repeated in California using the beetle and a parasitoidal fly, Cryptochaetum iceryae.|$|E
5|$|Seven {{years after}} their defeat, with Roman {{dominance}} of the area looking assured, the Samnites rose again and defeated a Roman army in 298 BC, to open the Third Samnite War.

5|$|Shot on {{location}} at an orphanage and two factories in central Java, Panggilan Darah was a modest commercial {{success in the}} Indies and Singapore. Its soundtrack, which featured nine kroncong songs, received popular acclaim, and the film's acting received critical praise. Despite <b>this</b> <b>success,</b> Oriental was unable to recoup its expenses, and merged into Multi Film soon afterwards. Panggilan Darah, which was screened as late as 1952, may now be lost.|$|E
5|$|The album {{sold over}} 100,000 copies in 1995, over {{three times as}} many as their first album sold. <b>This</b> <b>success</b> ensured that Interscope financed the band's third album, Tragic Kingdom, which was a massive success, selling 16 million copies {{worldwide}} and attracting extensive interest in the band. The Beacon Street Collection was re-released in 1997 as part of the band's back catalog.|$|E
5|$|The {{overwhelming}} {{success of}} the Ottoman Army's operations during the Battle of Katia demonstrated the attacking strength and determination of Kress von Kressenstein's force in 1916, and their efficient implementation of appropriate tactics, particularly timing and false intelligence. <b>This</b> <b>success</b> was underpinned by the Ottoman infantry's ability to make the gruelling march across the Sinai Peninsula and be fit enough to then launch attacks with force and determination.|$|E

5|$|<b>This</b> <b>success</b> led Barnes to {{consider}} cricket {{as a potential}} career.

In response, Barnes took a job with a garage in Mosman but after finding that the necessary travel interfered too much with playing cricket, he found alternative employment, demonstrating motorbikes in the city.|$|E
5|$|After <b>this</b> <b>success</b> Mufarrij {{and his men}} {{returned}} to Palestine where they confronted Rashiq, but were again defeated and forced to flee across the desert to Homs, where Bakjur, the local governor {{on behalf of the}} Hamdanid emir of Aleppo, Sa'd al-Dawla, took them in and catered for them, probably in winter 982. Despite this hospitality, the Tayy now went north and sought to enter the service of the Byzantine Empire. Emperor Basil II accepted their request, and a few months later, in autumn 983, the Tayy fought alongside the Byzantines under the doux of Antioch, Bardas Phokas, when he went to relieve Aleppo from an attack by Bakjur, who had rebelled against Sa'd al-Dawla.|$|E

5|$|After <b>this</b> <b>success,</b> he {{was sent}} to Asia Minor, where the Turkish raids on the Byzantine borderlands had become a menace, and where Turkish {{settlers}} had begun encroaching upon imperial territory. He remained there until 1267 and achieved some success, securing the lands around the valley of the Maeander River and restoring the defences of the region. The historian George Pachymeres certainly praised his conduct of these operations, and alleged that the mere mention of his approach caused fear to his enemies.|$|E
5|$|Akroinon {{was a major}} {{success for}} the Byzantines, {{as it was the}} first {{large-scale}} victory they had scored in a pitched battle against the Arabs. Seeing it as evidence of God's renewed favour, the victory also served to strengthen Leo's belief in the policy of iconoclasm that he had adopted some years before. In the immediate aftermath, <b>this</b> <b>success</b> opened up the way for a more aggressive stance by the Byzantines, who in 741 attacked the major Arab base of Melitene. In 742 and 743, the Umayyads were able to exploit a civil war between Constantine V and Artabasdos and raid into Anatolia with relative impunity, but the Arab sources do not report any major achievements.|$|E
5|$|An {{anonymous}} {{review of}} Srigala Item in the Surabaya-based daily Soerabaijasch Handelsblad was positive, predicting the film {{would be a}} commercial success. This prediction was fulfilled, as Srigala Item reached extensive audiences– mostly lower-class natives. The Indonesian film historian Misbach Yusa Biran credits <b>this</b> <b>success</b> to escapism. He writes that the film's theme of an oppressed, financially destitute youth {{who is able to}} control his destiny by becoming a masked vigilante, allowed viewers {{to be able to see}} themselves as the Black Wolf, and thus take revenge against those who had wronged them.|$|E

5|$|Ashworth left Liverpool {{midway through}} the {{following}} season, to manage Oldham Athletic – he wished {{to be closer to}} his wife and daughter, who lived in nearby Stockport. His replacement was the former Liverpool player Matt McQueen, a club director. McQueen was intended as a temporary appointment, but he kept the job as Liverpool retained the League championship. <b>This</b> <b>success</b> owed much to the form of their goalkeeper Elisha Scott, who conceded only 31 goals during the season, a league record at the time. Liverpool's total of 60 points in the season equalled the record set by West Bromwich Albion three seasons earlier. Harry Chambers top scored in the first four post World War 1 seasons including the two title wins.|$|E

The film was edited in the Netherlands after being shot in the Indies. The film was a commercial and critical success with European audiences, but disliked by native ones; despite <b>this</b> <b>success,</b> Pareh bankrupted its producers.|$|E
5|$|Boyce financed an {{expedition}} of the explorer Frederick Schwatka to Alaska in 1896.

Boyce soon began to carry out his own expeditions. When the United States entered the Spanish–American War in 1898, Boyce set sail for Cuban waters aboard the ship Three Friends.
