5|$|After Operation Credible Sport {{ended the}} Army {{leadership}} decided the unit {{was needed for}} future contingency operations. <b>Thusly,</b> on October 16, 1981 Task Force 158 became the 160th Aviation Battalion, with Brown a founding member. The choice of the unit's name was accepted by the U.S. Army Institute of Heraldry as a logical progression of the 101st's 158th and 159th Battalions. The 160th Aviation Battalion was later renamed the 160th Special Operations Aviation Group in 1986; {{it was not until}} 1990 when it would take on its current name, 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment. In October 1983, Brown participated in the invasion of Grenada, during which his unit became the first aviation unit to use night vision goggles in combat. In the late 1980s, Brown led all U.S. forces assigned to Operation Prime Chance, which provided escort security for American-flagged Kuwaiti tankers during the Iran-Iraq War. During Operation Prime Chance Brown's unit became the first aviation unit to engage in combat using night vision devices when they engaged an Iranian-flagged ship, Iran Ajr, that was seen deploying mines in the Persian Gulf.|$|E

25|$|All {{streets and}} avenues in Miami-Dade County follow the Miami Grid, {{with a few}} exceptions, most notably Coral Gables, Hialeah, Coconut Grove and Miami Beach.

25|$|The Buddhist honorific Nyorai is the Japanese {{translation}} of Tathāgata, a Sanskrit and Pali compound word whose exact meaning is uncertain. It was {{widely used in}} Indian religions other than Brahmanism as a term of respect for religious figures of exceptional stature, but it ended up being used only by Buddhism. Sanskrit grammar offers two possibilities for breaking up the compound: either tathā (<b>thusly)</b> and āgata (come) or tathā (<b>thusly)</b> and gata (gone), and Buddhist commentaries offer {{as many as eight}} different interpretations of its meaning. The most widely accepted is “one who has thus (tathā) gone (gata)” or “one who has thus (tathā) come (āgata)”, signifying that Buddha himself was no more than one in a long series of persons in the past and future to achieve enlightenment, and teach others how to do the same.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, Halonen {{nominated}} SDP-affiliated Ritva Viljanen for {{a second}} term in the Interior Ministry. The Council of State had nominated Ilkka Laitinen, who was unambiguously seen as the most competent candidate. Over {{the course of the past}} 50 years, the President had previously only once chosen to not obey the Council of State consensus, leading to Halonen <b>thusly</b> being accused of outright cronyism.|$|E
25|$|The grape shares some {{morphological}} similarities {{with the}} Savoy wine grape Altesse {{and has been}} historically confused with the French wine grape variety. In Hungary, Furmint is sometimes confused with Kéknyelű while {{on the island of}} Korčula, in Croatia, the grape has been confused with Pošip. The Romanian wine grape Grasă de Cotnari and the Bosnian wine grape Žilavka also shares several synonyms with Furmint and are, <b>thusly,</b> often confused with the grape.|$|E
25|$|Cnut {{built on}} the {{existing}} English trend for multiple shires to be grouped together under a single ealdorman, <b>thusly</b> dividing the country into four large administrative units whose geographical extent {{was based on the}} largest and most durable of the separate kingdoms that had preceded the unification of England. The officials responsible for these provinces were designated earls, a title of Scandinavian origin already in localised use in England, which now everywhere replaced that of ealdorman. Wessex was initially kept under Cnut's personal control, while Northumbria went to Erik of Hlathir, East Anglia to Thorkell the Tall, and Mercia remained in the hands of Eadric Streona.|$|E
25|$|The recent Sino-Angolan {{association}} is illustrative. When a petroleum-rich area called for investment and rebuilding, China advanced a $5 billion loan to be repaid in oil. They sent Chinese technicians, fixing {{a large part}} of the electrical system, and leading a part of the reconstruction. In the short term Angola benefits from Chinese-built roads, hospitals, schools, hotels, football stadiums, shopping centers and telecommunications projects. In turn, Angola mortgaged future oil production of a valuable, non-renewable resource. It may turn out to be a costly trade for Angola, but their needs for infrastructure is immediate and that is precisely what China provideds when no one else is willing to do so. And <b>thusly,</b> Angola has become China's leading energy supplier.|$|E
25|$|The elderly, disabled, {{and people}} with an {{impaired}} immune system, such as HIV, cancer, or those on immunosuppressive medications, are susceptible to crusted scabies (formerly called Norwegian scabies). On those with weaker immune systems, the host becomes a more fertile breeding ground for the mites, which spread over the host's body, except the face. The mites in crusted scabies are not more virulent than in noncrusted scabies; however, {{they are much more}} numerous (up to two million). People with crusted scabies exhibit scaly rashes, slight itching, and thick crusts of skin that contain the large numbers of scabies mites. Due to being infected <b>thusly,</b> persons with crusted scabies are more contagious to other persons. Such areas make eradication of mites particularly difficult, as the crusts protect the mites from topical miticides/scabicides, necessitating prolonged treatment of these areas.|$|E
25|$|The Church of Sweden was instigated by King Gustav I (1523–60) {{and within}} the half century {{following}} his death had become established as a Lutheran state church with significant power in Swedish society, itself {{under the control of}} the state apparatus. A degree of freedom of worship (for foreign residents only) was achieved under the rule of Gustav III (1771–92), but it was not until the passage of the Dissenter Acts of 1860 and 1874 that Swedish citizens were allowed to leave the state church – and then only provided that those wishing to do so first registered their adhesion to another, officially approved denomination. Following years of discussions that began in 1995, the Church of Sweden was finally separated from the state as from 1 January 2000. However, the separation was not fully completed. Although the status of state religion came to an end, the Church of Sweden nevertheless remains Swedens national church, and as such is still regulated by the government through the law of the Church of Sweden. Therefore, it would be more appropriate to refer to a change of relation between state and church rather than a separation. Furthermore, the Swedish constitution still maintain that the Sovereign and the members of the royal family has to confess an evangelical Lutheran faith, which in praxis means they need to be members of the Church of Sweden to remain in the line of succession. <b>Thusly</b> according to the ideas of cuius regio, eius religio one could argue that the symbolic connection between state and church still remains.|$|E
500|$|The Great Flood of 1862 largely obliterated the {{placer mining}} claims along {{this part of}} the Trinity River, spurring prospectors to push west, {{establishing}} a pack trail to the area around the New River and the South Fork of the Trinity. In fact, the New River was named <b>thusly</b> for being a [...] "new" [...] river to explore for gold. Although the river gold petered out by the 1870s, lode gold was discovered in the 1880s in the mountains above the Trinity River country. Because hard rock mining was required to access the gold bearing veins, new industries such as iron forges and stamp mills prospered in the region.|$|E
500|$|Although the Daddies were {{experiencing}} commercial success {{under the guise}} of swing revivalists, having been declared the [...] "leaders" [...] of the movement by Rolling Stone, the band openly contested being labeled a retro act at the exclusion of their dominant ska and punk influences and modernist lyricism. While still vocal supporters of both the swing revival and its bands, the Daddies adamantly tried to disassociate themselves from the swing scene and in particular its nostalgia-based mentality. Perry explained to Spin in July 1998, [...] "it's not our mission to be a swing band. I'm not a guy from the '40s. That's why we play ska and use heavy guitars", noting elsewhere [...] "I can't fully take us out of the retro classification, but we harp on the fact that we're contemporary music". <b>Thusly,</b> the Daddies avoided touring with swing bands, selecting Latin rock group Ozomatli and ska/soul band The Pietasters as support on their first headlining U.S. tour, and opening for Argentine rock band Los Fabulosos Cadillacs on their 1998 North American tour. At one point, the Daddies attempted to arrange a tour with Primus which never materialized; said Perry, [...] "I know there are people who come to our shows who'd like nothing more than for us to play swing 24/7...there are plenty of bands who want to be swing bands and swing bands only. We're trying to find the audience who'll let us write songs and just be who we are".|$|E

2500|$|The Salmon Falls Creek valley was an {{important}} trading route through which the Shoshone Indians in the Snake River Plain and the Paiute in the Great Basin interacted. The first Europeans to see the creek were likely fur trappers from the British Hudson's Bay Company traveling through {{the area in the}} early 19th century. In the early 1900s a canal system was built to supply irrigation water to Idaho's Magic Valley and the city of Twin Falls was incorporated in 1905. The first proposal to dam the nearby Salmon Falls Creek for irrigation was in 1909, and surmised that an additional [...] of farm land could <b>thusly</b> be brought into production. The Salmon Falls Dam was built in 1906 and raised in 1934. However, the water supply was less than originally expected, and only [...] ended up being developed.|$|E
2500|$|Unfortunately, in {{the nearly}} half a century which followed, the grounds to the White House had fallen rather {{considerably}} into disrepair {{by the time of the}} Kennedy administration first came to office. The ill kempt state of the gardens <b>thusly</b> drew the focus of then-First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy, who eventually came to work with Rachel Lambert Mellon and Perry Wheeler on the redesign and replanting of the entire Rose and East Gardens. By the time of President Kennedy's tragic assassination in 1963 the Rose Garden had been finished to completion, although similar such revitalization on the East Garden was still a work in progress. To further honor Jacqueline Kennedy's contributions to the White House and its grounds, her immediate successor, First Lady Lady Bird Johnson, came to rename the East Garden as the [...] "Jacqueline Kennedy Garden" [...] during a ceremony on 22 April 1965.|$|E
2500|$|In mid-2004, Booker T set {{his sights}} on the United States Championship along with its champion, John Cena. After Cena got on the bad side of General Manager Kurt Angle, he did his best to get the title away from Cena. Cena {{successfully}} defended the title at The Great American Bash in a four-way elimination match against Booker, René Duprée, and Rob Van Dam. After Cena was stripped of his title by Angle for [...] "laying a hand" [...] on the GM, Booker took advantage of the situation and won an eight-man elimination match to win the vacant United States Championship, thus becoming the one-hundredth United States Champion in history, in a match that also featured Cena, Dupree, Billy Gunn, Charlie Haas, Luther Reigns, Kenzo Suzuki and Van Dam. Booker won by last eliminating both Cena and Van Dam in the course of less than 10 seconds After Angle was fired by Mr. McMahon for embellishing his injuries, Theodore Long began his first tenure as Smackdown GM, and booked a best-of-five series of matches for the United States Championship between Booker and Cena. The first match took place at SummerSlam in Toronto and saw Cena gain the pinfall victory to go up 1–0 in the series. Booker would bounce back and win the next two matches, on the edition of August 24 of Smackdown in Fresno, CA and a live event the next night in Sydney, Australia, to take a 2–1 lead. The next match in the series wouldn't come until the September 16 Smackdown from Spokane, WA, where Cena won and tied the series at two apiece. The series culminated at No Mercy, where Cena won the series 3–2, and <b>thusly,</b> the US Title.|$|E
