25|$|He {{had endured}} a further {{incident}} during his recovery period: Osoro's wealth as a marathon runner attracted kidnappers; {{his son was}} abducted and held for ransom in Kenya, but managed to escape his two kidnappers unharmed. Osoro made his major race comeback at the 2001 Chicago Marathon in October and managed seventh place overall. However, his career was put on hold again in 2002, this time for contracting malaria, and because of his mother's long-term illness. He ran at the Honolulu Marathon in December, coming in third in a Kenyan sweep {{of the top three}} alongside Mbarak Hussein and Jimmy Muindi. In June the following year he ran at the Rock 'n' Roll San Diego Marathon and, {{in spite of the fact}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>ran</b> with a lean to the right throughout (an effect of nerve damage), he won the race and recorded his third marathon time under two hours and ten minutes (2:09:38 hours).|$|E

25|$|From 1791 until 1794, Coleridge {{attended}} Jesus College. He received 70 {{pounds per}} year in scholarship to attend the school with 30 pounds from the Rustat Scholarship, a scholarship dedicated to the sons of clergymen that prove themselves in academics. However, this was only enough to provide Coleridge with a meagre living at Jesus College, which he would complain of often. This was compounded by the debt that Coleridge began to accrue and avoided paying. It is uncertain how Coleridge used his income, {{but it is possible}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>ran</b> into debt because of indulgence in wine and opium, the drug that he continued to use throughout college. It is also possible that he spent his money on prostitutes, which he deeply regretted and even had nightmares over. He was prone to sexual nightmares, and he recorded one such dream in 1803 about being pursued by a prostitute at both Christ's Hospital and Jesus College.|$|E

25|$|His early {{sketches}} gained him a {{place in}} the studios of established painters. He worked for three months in the studio of the Flemish painter Ferdinand Elle, who painted almost exclusively portraits, a genre that was of little interest to Poussin. He moved next to the studio of Georges Lallemand, but Lallemand's inattention to precise drawing and the articulation of his figures apparently displeased Poussin. However, Poussin did not fit well into the studio system, where several painters worked on the same painting. Thereafter he preferred to work very slowly and alone. Little is known of his life in Paris at this time. Court records show <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>ran</b> up considerable debts, which he was unable to pay. He studied anatomy and perspective, but the most important event of his first residence in Paris was his discovery of the royal art collections, thanks to his friendship with Alexandre Courtois, the valet de chambre of Marie de Medicis. There he saw for the first time engravings of the works of Giulio Romano and especially of Raphael, whose work had an enormous influence on his future style.|$|E
