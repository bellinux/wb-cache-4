5|$|There {{are several}} defences to {{trespass}} to land; licence, justification by law, necessity and jus tertii. Licence is express or implied permission, {{given by the}} possessor of land, {{to be on that}} land. If a licence is lawfully revoked, a licence-holder becomes a trespasser if they remain on the land. Justification by law refers to those situations in which there is statutory authority permitting a person to go onto land, such as the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, which allows the police to enter land for the purposes of carrying out an arrest. Jus tertii is where the defendant can prove that the land is not possessed by the claimant, but by a third party, as in Doe d Carter v Barnard. The exception to this defence is if the claimant is a tenant and the defendant a landlord who had no right to give the claimant his lease. Necessity is <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> it is vital to commit the trespass; in Esso Petroleum Co v Southport Corporation, the captain of a ship committed trespass by allowing oil to flood a shoreline. This was necessary to protect his ship and crew, however, and the defence of necessity was accepted.|$|E

25|$|Badiou's {{ultimate}} ethical maxim {{is therefore}} one of: 'decide upon the undecidable'. It is {{to name the}} indiscernible, the generic set, and thus name the event that re-casts ontology in a new light. He identifies four domains in which a subject (who, {{it is important to}} note, becomes a subject through this process) can potentially witness an event: love, science, politics and art. By enacting fidelity to the event within these four domains one performs a 'generic procedure', which in its undecidability is necessarily experimental, and one potentially recasts <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> being takes place. Through this maintenance of fidelity, truth has the potentiality to emerge.|$|E
25|$|These form an {{organizing}} principle and unifying theme for Asimov's robotic-based fiction, appearing in his Robot series, the stories linked to it, and his Lucky Starr series of young-adult fiction. The Laws {{are incorporated into}} {{almost all of the}} positronic robots appearing in his fiction, and cannot be bypassed, being intended as a safety feature. Many of Asimov's robot-focused stories involve robots behaving in unusual and counter-intuitive ways as an unintended consequence of how the robot applies the Three Laws to <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> it finds itself. Other authors working in Asimov's fictional universe have adopted them and references, often parodic, appear throughout science fiction as well as in other genres.|$|E
25|$|His {{experiences}} during World War I undeniably left a deep {{impression on}} his psyche. The reality {{of war on}} the mind is especially explored in his novel Doberdob. Voranc wished to convey to his reader the realism of <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> his characters lived {{and there is little}} that is sentimental about his depictions. Voranc preferred to write about the impoverished peasant and industrial working class against the impressionistic backdrop of a land that sometimes colludes against the peasant. His socialist leanings are key to understanding his later work. During the 1930s, while living away from his homeland, he became more aware of international socialism, although he adapted realism in his work to suit Slovene sensibilities.|$|E

25|$|Neither cross-side network effects nor same-side network {{effects are}} {{sufficient}} {{for an organization}} to be a MSP. Examining traditional supermarkets, {{it is clear that}} shoppers prefer higher number of suppliers and bigger variety of goods, while suppliers value higher number of buyers. Nevertheless, a supermarket does not qualify as an MSP because it does not enable direct contact between shoppers and suppliers. On the other hand, such network effects are not required for a firm to be seen as an MSP. One example is <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> niche event organizers implement a ticketing service managed by a small on-line ticket provider in their websites. Consumers affiliate with the on-line ticket provider only when they go to the website to buy the ticket. However, cross-side network effects and same-side network effects are common in MSPs.|$|E
25|$|In 1888, {{the young}} and ambitious Kaiser Wilhelm II became emperor. He could not abide advice, least of all from the most {{experienced}} politician and diplomat in Europe, so he fired Bismarck. The Kaiser opposed Bismarck's careful foreign policy and wanted Germany to pursue colonialist policies, as Britain and France had been doing for decades, as well as build a navy that could match the British. The Kaiser promoted active colonization of Africa and Asia for those areas that were not already colonies of other European powers; his record was notoriously brutal {{and set the stage}} for genocide. The Kaiser took a mostly unilateral approach in Europe with as main ally the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and an arms race with Britain, which eventually led to <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the assassination of the Austrian-Hungarian crown prince could spark off World War I.|$|E
25|$|Ventriloquism {{has been}} used as the {{evidence}} for the modality appropriateness hypothesis. Ventriloquism describes <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> auditory location perception is shifted toward a visual cue. The original study describing this phenomenon was conducted by Howard and Templeton, (1966) after which several studies have replicated and built upon the conclusions they reached. In conditions in which the visual cue is unambiguous, visual capture reliably occurs. Thus to test the influence of sound on perceived location, the visual stimulus must be progressively degraded. Furthermore, given that auditory stimuli are more attuned to temporal changes, recent studies have tested the ability of temporal characteristics to influence the spatial location of visual stimuli. Some types of EVP – electronic voice phenomenon, mainly the ones using sound bubles are considered a kind of modern ventriloquism technique and is played by the use of sophisticated software, computers and sound equipment.|$|E

Mr Dixon escaped from the wreckage with fractures. However, despite his injuries, he returned to the aircraft to help other passengers trapped in the wreckage. As a result of this selfless action, he was critically burned when a flash fire broke out on the left wing of the aircraft near a hole in the fuselage from which he was helping passengers escape.

Psychiatry as a social institution, formed and functioning in the totalitarian state, is incapable of not being totalitarian.

500|$|... "Crazy for You" [...] {{is a song}} by American singer Madonna {{from the}} soundtrack album to the 1985 film Vision Quest. It was {{released}} on March 2, 1985 by Geffen Records as the first single from the soundtrack.

The song was also included on the ballads compilation Something to Remember (1995) and the greatest hits compilation Celebration (2009). Producers Jon Peters and Peter Guber, along with music director Phil Ramone, decided to use Madonna after listening to her previous recordings, employing John Bettis and Jon Lind to write the song.

500|$|Consideration of throffers forms part of {{the wider}} {{question}} of coercion and, specifically, {{the possibility of a}} coercive offer. Determining whether throffers are coercive, and, if so, to what extent, is difficult. The traditional assumption is that offers cannot be coercive, only threats can, but throffers can challenge this. The threatening aspect of a throffer need not be explicit, as it was in Steiner's examples. Instead, a throffer may take the form of an offer, but carry an implied threat. Philosopher John Kleinig sees a throffer as an example of an occasion when an offer alone may be considered coercive. Another example of a coercive offer may be when <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the offer is made is already unacceptable; for instance, if a factory owner takes advantage of a poor economic environment to offer workers an unfair wage. For Jonathan Riley, a liberal society has a duty to protect its citizens from coercion, whether that coercion comes from a threat, offer, throffer or some other source. [...] "If other persons ... attempt to frustrate the right-holder's wants, then a liberal society must take steps to prevent this, by law if necessary. All exercises of power by others to frustrate the relevant individual or group preferences constitute unwarranted 'interference' with liberty in purely private matters." ...|$|E
