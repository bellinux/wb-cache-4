5|$|During the 1952 presidential election, the Eisenhower {{campaign}} toured Wisconsin with McCarthy. In {{a speech}} delivered in Green Bay, Eisenhower declared {{that while he}} agreed with McCarthy's goals, he disagreed with his methods. In draft versions of his speech, Eisenhower had also included a strong defense of his mentor, George Marshall, which was a direct rebuke of McCarthy's frequent attacks. However, under the advice of conservative colleagues who were fearful that Eisenhower could lose Wisconsin if he alienated McCarthy supporters, he deleted <b>this</b> <b>defense</b> from later versions of his speech. The deletion was discovered by William H. Laurence, a reporter for The New York Times, and featured on its front page the next day. Eisenhower was widely criticized for giving up his personal convictions, and the incident became the low point of his campaign.|$|E
5|$|Klis Fortress is {{probably}} {{best known for its}} defense against the Ottoman invasion of Europe in the early 16th century. Croatian captain Petar Kružić led the defense of the fortress against a Turkish invasion and siege that lasted for more than two and a half decades. During <b>this</b> <b>defense,</b> as Kružić and his soldiers fought without allies against the Turks, the military faction of Uskoks was formed, which later became famous as an elite Croatian militant sect. Ultimately, the defenders were defeated and the fortress was occupied by the Ottomans in 1537. After more than a century under Ottoman rule, in 1669, Klis Fortress was besieged and seized by the Republic of Venice, thus moving the border between Christian and Muslim Europe further east and helping to contribute to the decline of the Ottoman Empire. The Venetians restored and enlarged the fortress, but it was taken by the Austrians after Napoleon extinguished the republic itself in 1797. Today, Klis Fortress contains a museum where visitors to this historic military structure can see an array of arms, armor, and traditional uniforms.|$|E
5|$|Once the Alien and Sedition Acts were passed, the Federalists {{pushed for}} this letter to be {{printed in the}} Vermont Journal, which Spooner did, thus adding {{additional}} charges against Lyon. One other charge included publishing letters written by the poet Joel Barlow, which Lyon had read at political rallies. These also were published prior to the Acts. Lyon's defense {{was to be the}} unconstitutionality of the Acts, as Jeffersonians saw them as violating the First Amendment to the Constitution. In Lyon's particular case, there was the aforementioned letter to Alden Spooner {{as well as that of}} Barlow, which meant Lyon felt entitled to bring up the Constitution's safeguards against ex post facto laws. <b>This</b> <b>defense</b> was not allowed.|$|E

5|$|Symeon's {{theological}} and ethical treatises were original written works, {{as compared to}} many of his other writings that were taken from his talks. They cover his positions on various controversial issues of theology. Many of them were directed at Stephen, his main antagonist in the church, along with other church officials whom Symeon saw as taking an overly theoretical approach to Christianity. In these pieces Symeon defended {{the traditions of the}} early Byzantine mystical theologians from the teachings of the church officials of his own time. Central to <b>this</b> <b>defense</b> was Symeon's view that the revelation of scripture could only be understood through the experience of divine grace given to the pure of heart during contemplation.|$|E
5|$|A.J. Styles went on {{to defend}} the TNA X Division Championship against Samoa Joe at Turning Point. <b>This</b> <b>defense</b> was due to Styles accusing Joe of violating the unwritten X Division code. Styles then {{challenged}} Joe to a TNA X Division Championship match at Turning Point which Joe accepted on the November19 episode of Impact!. Joe defeated Styles at the show to become the new TNA X Division Champion. After the bout, Joe attempted to assault Styles {{in the same manner}} he did with Daniels until Daniels returned from injury to save Styles. This continued a rivalry between the three wrestlers as Joe {{went on to}} defend the title against Daniels at TNA's Final Resolution PPV event on January15, 2006, which Joe won to retain the title. At TNA's Against All Odds PPV event on February12, 2006, Daniels, Joe, and Styles competed in a Three Way match for the TNA X Division Championship; Joe gained the pinfall to retain the title. The three competed again, but this time in a Three Way Ultimate X match for the championship at TNA's Destination X PPV event on March12, 2006. Daniels won the bout, thus becoming the new TNA X Division Champion. The rivalry ended on the April13, 2006 episode of Impact! when Joe defeated Daniels to win back the championship.|$|E
5|$|The second common parasitoid, Elasmus polistis, {{also has}} {{disastrous}} {{effects on the}} P. exclamans nest. Up to 80 E. polistis will hatch out of a single cell. The males emerge first, and then will exit the nest and wait until the females emerge. Once the female moths emerge, the males will mate and reproduce, quickly destroying the P. exclamans population. In some cases the invading E. polistis will hide larvae in the nest so that the P.exclamans cannot find them. This {{is important to the}} survival of P.exclamans. The hosts will attempt to remove as many parasitoids as possible to prevent them from spreading to nearby nests. <b>This</b> <b>defense</b> mechanism has not been proven to be effective, as more often than not the E. polistis larvae go undetected by the hosts. In one experiment conducted, it was found that over 60% of all nests lost brood to the parasitoids E. polistis or C. iphitalis in 1981. It was also observed that larger satellites have a greater risk of being parasitized. This {{is due to the fact}} that the large nests are typically older. This relationship between age and parasitism can be seen with the fact that older queens’ nests tend to be parasitized more than younger queens’ nests.|$|E

When threatened or disturbed, the beetle revolves its abdomen and touches abdominal tip to offender to wipe the glands. Ants (Formica exsectoides) are a common offender and have portrayed that <b>this</b> <b>defense</b> takes place. The ants are shown to be repelled by the four major components of secretion (isoamyl acetate, iridodial, E-8-oxocitronellyl acetate, and dihydroneptalactone). Dihydroneptalactone is the main principal ingredient of chemical defense.|$|E

25|$|The Yagura castle is {{considered}} by many to be the strongest defensive position in shogi. A common Yagura structure is the Gold Yagura. It has a strongly protected king; a well-fortified line of pawns; and the bishop, rook, and a pawn all support a later attack by the rook's silver or knight. It is notoriously difficult to break down with a frontal assault, though it is weaker from the side. It is typically used against Static Rook openings that involve advancing the rook's pawn. However, one's opponent may just as easily adopt <b>this</b> <b>defense,</b> giving neither side an advantage.|$|E

Although this is a great question, the reality is that with huge power demands, the piezoelectric systems that would be installed would only provide a small percentage of power to the base and not 100 % of the power requirements. But if these energy harvesting systems could provide 27 - 42 % of the base's power then these systems would be a tremendous success. And by integrating this system into a base design could serve as a prototypical model for civilian communities and cities...|$|R

It was a tribute therefore to Crispa's individuals' capabilities to go beyond <b>this</b> <b>defense</b> set up by the three. Crispa, however had the edge at the bench since they had noted defensive aces like Padim Israel, Joy Dionisio, Yoyoy Villamin, Bay Cristobal (especially in 1983 under Coach Tommy Manotoc) while Toyota had to contend with Herrera, Javier, Coloso and Bulaong to provide the defensive spunk.|$|E
25|$|It is a diurnal species, {{but it can}} {{be found}} moving about and hunting at night as well. They are often found by turning over rocks within or near the brooks and streams they inhabit.

Queen snakes are very alert to any potential danger and will drop into the water when disturbed. They are rather docile snakes, not too likely to bite and can be easily handled. However, in doing so, one risks being polluted by malodorous feces and anal musk, similar to the behaviour of the garter snake in <b>this</b> <b>defense.</b>|$|E
25|$|By simply {{observing the}} stem of one H. physophora individual, we see the complex {{interactions}} between four different species: an ant, a plant, a fungus, and an assassin bug, {{as well as all}} of the prey that lands on the plant. The plant gives a little of its own resources to the predators, but it gets two forms of defense against herbivores and parasitic plants. To the plant, <b>this</b> <b>defense</b> is worth much more than the loss of some food. The plant has maximized its own fitness by establishing two separate and independent relationships that are not very costly but very rewarding. The insects both benefit as well, given a safe habitat and a steady food supply of other insects that land on the prey. In the perspective of A. decemarticulatus, they do not actively give any of their own resources to the plant or to the assassin bug. They simply live among them, use their resources, and hunt.|$|E
