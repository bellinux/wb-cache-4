5|$|During the Jacobite Rising of 1745, the Jacobites under Charles Edward Stuart stormed Dunrobin Castle without warning, {{because the}} Clan Sutherland {{supported}} the British government. The 17th Earl of Sutherland, who {{had changed his}} surname from Gordon to Sutherland, narrowly escaped them, exiting through a back door. He sailed for Aberdeen where he joined the Duke of Cumberland's army. On {{the death of the}} 18th Earl in 1766, <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>passed</b> to his daughter, Elizabeth, who married the politician George Leveson-Gower, later created 1st Duke of Sutherland. In 1785, the house was altered and extended again.|$|E
5|$|Since <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>passed</b> to the National Trust in 1972, {{major works}} of {{restoration}} and re-creation have been undertaken {{and a number}} of pieces of Burges furniture, mostly not original to the house, are displayed. These include a bookcase from Buckingham Street and a chimney piece from the Hall at Worcester College, Oxford, where, in the 1960s, some decorative works by Burges were removed, although his redecoration of the college Chapel remains. The aim is, as far as possible, to reinstate the work of Burges and Crace.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>house</b> {{subsequently}} <b>passed</b> to Lady Jane's niece, Lady Frances Scott, {{daughter of}} Francis Scott, Earl of Dalkeith {{who became the}} second wife of Archibald Douglas, 1st Baron Douglas. <b>The</b> <b>house</b> then <b>passed</b> in 1817 to their daughter, Lady Caroline Lucy and her husband Vice Admiral Sir George Scott. Although the couple lived at <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> Caroline made her brother, Rev. James Douglas, 4th Baron Douglas, part owner in 1827. Following both their deaths in April 1857, it was their younger sister, Mary Sidney Douglas, who inherited. <b>The</b> <b>house</b> then <b>passed</b> through her to the Drummond-Moray family.|$|R
5|$|Sir Ralph died in 1677, and {{his widow}} let {{the house to}} the Duke of Ormonde from 1686 and 1688. John Bankes the Elder regained the {{property}} in 1693, and with his wife Margaret, daughter of Sir Henry Parker of Honington Hall, completed most of his father's original development plan. In 1772 <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>passed</b> to his second son Henry who remodelled it, built a servants' wing, and enclosed the parkland for better agricultural management.|$|E
5|$|The {{legislature}} summoned {{everyone in}} the surrounding area who had any knowledge of the events at Saint Mary's, but found {{that no one was}} certain of Jennings's role in the commission. After a short debate, <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>passed</b> a resolution, voting 15 to 13, to recognize Jennings as governor and dropped it proceedings against him. The House votes opposing Jennings came largely from the state's western counties. Harrison was outraged by the decision and resigned as lieutenant governor.|$|E
5|$|Candidate state {{reptiles}} are not {{assured of}} making it through the legislative process. In Minnesota, 1998 and 1999 bills proposing the Blanding's turtle were unsuccessful. In Pennsylvania in 2009, <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>passed</b> an eastern box turtle bill which died in the Senate without a vote. Virginia proponents of the eastern box turtle have seen 1999 and 2009 bids fail. For the most recent attempt, a legislative opponent of the turtle {{said it was too}} cowardly for the state because of its defensive shell, and suggested the rattlesnake would be a better representative. The turtle also drew scorn for often perishing on roads, but its most serious problem was a too-close association with bordering state, North Carolina.|$|E

5|$|More than twelve {{generations of}} the Avery family have resided in the Avery Homestead. The {{original}} house was constructed about 1696 by William Morgan, {{around the time of}} his marriage to Margaret Avery. The two were descendents of James Morgan and James Avery respectively. <b>The</b> <b>house</b> <b>passed</b> to Deacon William Morgan Jr. who used the house to conduct church services from 1726, when North Groton became a separate parish, and lasted until the completion of a meetinghouse. Deacon William Morgan Jr. sold the house to John Wood in 1745. Nine years would pass before it would be reacquired by the Avery family in 1754. Theophilus Avery, the first, owned the house from 1757 to 1798. The second Theophilus Avery possessed the house from 1852 to 1880. Amos G. Avery acquired the house in 1946 from his father.|$|E
5|$|Sir John Brownlow was succeeded at Belton by his brother, who {{was content}} to permit Brownlow's widow, Alice, to remain in occupation. She spent the {{remainder}} of her life at Belton arranging advantageous marriages for her five daughters. On her death in 1721, <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>passed</b> to her husband's nephew (and her son-in-law) Sir John Brownlow III (later Viscount Tyrconnel). Tyrconnel, a dilettante of no great intellect, was responsible {{for many of the}} architectural features which survive in the park and garden. Between 1742 and 1751, a series of follies, including a Gothic ruin, a cascade, and a prospect or belvedere known as the Belmount Tower, were constructed for him. When built the tower had two small wings flanking each side, since removed.|$|E
5|$|The Acors Barns House {{has gone}} through several owners over its lifetime. In 1862, <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>passed</b> from Acors Barns to his son William H. Barns. In 1893, the second son, Charles Barns {{acquired}} the title {{to the house and}} transferred it upon his death to Harriet Barns Vincent, the daughter of his sister. Harriet Barns Vincent sold the house to Julia O'Sullivan in 1919. Francis McGuire purchased the house in 1956 and it would later pass to James McGuire. In 2013, James McGuire sold the house to the Community Foundation of Eastern Connecticut for $325,000. The foundation stated it would continue to preserve the house's historical integrity.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> New Zealand <b>House</b> of Representatives is a {{component}} of the New Zealand Parliament, along with the Sovereign (represented by <b>the</b> Governor-General). <b>The</b> <b>House</b> <b>passes</b> all laws, provides ministers to form a Cabinet, and supervises the work of the Government. It is also responsible for adopting the state's budgets and approving the state's accounts.|$|R
5000|$|If <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>passes</b> a Money Bill {{and sends}} that Bill to the Senate for its consent, {{and if the}} Senate does not give its consent within a month after {{receiving}} the Bill, the money bill {{is sent to the}} Governor-General for assent even though the Senate had not consented to it ...|$|R

5|$|The {{house at}} Burton Pynsent was built section by section {{over the period}} of many years. Construction was {{commenced}} by Marmaduke Jennings in approximately 1565 and was continued by the Jennings family throughout the 17th century. In 1679 <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>passed</b> to Sir William Pynsent, who had married into the family. Pynsent's son bequeathed the house to his political idol, William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham, despite never meeting him. His intention was to disinherit Lord North, a relative of his wife, who had supported a tax on Somerset cider which Pynsent disagreed with, and which Pitt had blocked. Pynsent died in 1765 and his relatives were unhappy at being left just 1,000 guineas each, and so unsuccessfully contested the will over the following six years.|$|E
5|$|The {{rift between}} Williams and Patton became {{permanent}} during negotiations {{over the state}} budget in 1999. Patton proposed to Williams a 7-cent-per-gallon gasoline tax, with 1cent of every 7 dedicated to counties with the most unpaved roads – usually heavily Republican counties ignored by past Democratic governors. Patton claimed Williams {{told him he had}} 10votes in the Senate for the increase. But gas prices spiked before the measure came to a vote in the Senate, and Williams failed to deliver his votes after <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>passed</b> the tax. The administration and key Republican senators reached a compromise that saved Patton's budget with tax changes that were mostly revenue-neutral. Patton believed Williams had deliberately misled him, however, and the two never reconciled.|$|E
5|$|Although Desha and {{his entire}} {{administration}} campaigned {{on behalf of}} New Court candidates during the legislative elections of 1825, Old Court supporters regained the state House and evenly split the Senate between Old and New Court supporters. Desha's message to the newly reconstituted General Assembly remained critical of banks and the judiciary, but urged legislators to seek a compromise to resolve the court question. Stickles records that Desha was sincere in his desire for a compromise, albeit one that would save face for the New Court Party. He promised that, if the legislature would again authorize appointment of {{a new set of}} judges, he would appoint them equally from both parties. Another plan would have expanded the court to six judges, with three appointed from each party. One legislator proposed that all members of both courts resign, along with Desha, lieutenant governor Robert B. McAfee, and all the legislators in the General Assembly, essentially allowing the state government to reset itself. This bill passed the House but was killed in the Senate. <b>The</b> <b>House</b> <b>passed</b> a measure to restore the Old Court, but the Senate deadlocked on the measure and McAfee, the presiding officer in the Senate, cast the tie-breaking vote to defeat it.|$|E

Among them were key bills setting up an Independent Elections and Boundary Review Commission [...] and a revamped Anti-Corruption Commission investigation body.|$|R
5|$|Both Houses of Congress were majority-Republican, {{but their}} {{solutions}} differed. <b>The</b> <b>House</b> <b>passed</b> {{a bill in}} June 1890 requiring the government to purchase 4.5 million ounces of silver each month (in addition to the $2– $4 million required to be coined under Bland–Allison). The Senate passed a bill by Republican Preston B. Plumb of Kansas for free coinage of silver at the legal (16:1) ratio. Sherman voted against Plumb's bill, but {{was appointed to the}} conference committee to produce a compromise bill that, now called the Sherman Silver Purchase Act, passed that July. The Treasury would buy 4.5 million ounces of silver and would issue Treasury Notes to pay for it, which would be redeemable in gold or silver. The law also provided that the Treasury could coin more silver dollars if the Secretary believed it necessary to redeem the new notes. Sherman thought the bill was the least harmful option. Harrison believed it would end the controversy, and he signed it into law. The effect of the bill, however, was the increased depletion of the nation's gold supply.|$|E
5|$|Goya went to {{exile in}} France in 1824, and {{ownership}} of <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>passed</b> to his grandson Mariano. An 1830 inventory by Brugada {{indicates that the}} work took a full wall between two windows on the first floor, opposite A Pilgrimage to San Isidro. On the wall to the right were Saturn Devouring His Son and Judith and Holofernes. Leocadia, Two Old Men and Two Old Men Eating Soup were on the left wall. Art historian Lawrence Gowing observed that the lower floor was divided thematically, with a male side– Saturn and A Pilgrimage to San Isidro– and a female side– Judith and Holofernes, Witches' Sabbath and Leocadia. The house changed owners {{a number of times}} before March 1873, when it came into the possession of the Belgian Frédéric Émile d'Erlanger, who speculated that the area would appreciate in value over the coming years. The murals had deteriorated badly after many years on the walls. To preserve them, the new owner of the house had them transferred to canvas {{under the direction of the}} art restorer of the Museo del Prado, Salvador Martinez Cubells. Following their exhibition at the Paris Exposition Universelle in 1878, where they were met with little reaction, d'Erlanger donated them to the Spanish state in 1881.|$|E
5|$|The abbey {{provided}} {{a home to}} an average of 30 to 40 canons, sometimes known as Black Canons, because of their dress (a white habit and black cloak). One of these canons, Henry Knighton, is notable for his Chronicle, which was written during his time at the abbey in the 14th century. In 1530 Cardinal Thomas Wolsey died at the abbey, whilst travelling south to face trial for treason. A few years later, in 1538, the abbey was dissolved, and was quickly demolished, with the building materials reused in various structures across Leicester, including a mansion which was built on the site. <b>The</b> <b>house</b> <b>passed</b> through several aristocratic families, and became known as Cavendish House after it was acquired by the 1st Earl of Devonshire, in 1613. The house was eventually looted and destroyed by fire in 1645, following the capture of Leicester during the English Civil War.|$|E
