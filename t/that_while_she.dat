5|$|Davis {{returned}} to work a week later, on , 2015.

The ACLU sued Davis separately for these form alterations, which they found to be of questionable legality.

Governor Beshear acknowledged that Kentucky would recognize the licenses being issued, but he could not verify the legality of the licenses issued or the means by which the marriage licenses were altered.

Seeking musical inspiration, West asked McDonald for ideas, who in turn suggested that he be introduced to Mitchell. Upon meeting Mitchell after she arrived at Studios 301 where he was recording music during the tour, West had her sing over a vocal track and quickly took a liking to her voice. U2 singer Bono and guitarist The Edge also complimented Mitchell's singing while visiting the studio. Some time later, Mitchell {{received a call from}} West who asked if she could travel to The Record Plant in Los Angeles to begin recording tracks for his third studio album. Mitchell later admitted <b>that</b> <b>while</b> <b>she</b> previously didn't know who Kanye West was and never really cared for hip-hop music, the collaboration has changed her views.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1930s, she left Blackpool, and moved south to London. Her reasons {{for doing so}} have never been satisfactorily explained, and she would offer multiple, {{contradictory}} accounts of her reasoning in later life. According to one account, her father sent her to study with the famed occultist and mystic Aleister Crowley, who had founded the religion of Thelema in 1904; Montalban's biographer Julia Philips noted <b>that</b> <b>while</b> <b>she</b> met Crowley in London, this story remains implausible. Another of Montalban's accounts held that {{she moved to the}} capital to work for the Daily Express newspaper; this claim has never been corroborated, and one of the paper's reporters at the time, Justine Glass, has claimed that she never remembered Montalban working there. Montalban often changed her stories, and informed later disciple Michael Howard that upon arrival in London, the Daily Express sent her to interview Crowley. According to this story, when she first visited him at his lodgings in Jermyn Street, he was suffering from an asthma attack, and having had experience with this ailment from a family member she was able to help him, earning his gratitude. They subsequently went to the expensive Caf√© Royal in Regent Street, where after their lunch, he revealed that he was unable to pay, leaving Montalban to sort out payment.|$|E

They find a girl who's seen the devil, a sea captain's daughter, and a sweet, red-haired forest boy who meets death halfway. All the while, Vi's feelings for Neely grow sharper, the stakes higher, and the truth harder to pin down.
