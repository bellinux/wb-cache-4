50|$|The thermal {{conductivity}} of the <b>tube</b> <b>material</b> usually depends on temperature; the mean {{thermal conductivity}} is often used.|$|E
5000|$|To {{be able to}} {{transfer}} heat well, the <b>tube</b> <b>material</b> should have good thermal conductivity. Because heat is transferred from a hot to a cold side through the tubes, there is a temperature difference through {{the width of the}} tubes. Because of the tendency of the <b>tube</b> <b>material</b> to thermally expand differently at various temperatures, thermal stresses occur during operation. This is in addition to any stress from high pressures from the fluids themselves. The <b>tube</b> <b>material</b> also should be compatible with both the shell and tube side fluids for long periods under the operating conditions (temperatures, pressures, pH, etc.) to minimize deterioration such as corrosion. All of these requirements call for careful selection of strong, thermally-conductive, corrosion-resistant, high quality tube materials, typically metals, including aluminium, copper alloy, stainless steel, carbon steel, non-ferrous copper alloy, Inconel, nickel, Hastelloy and titanium. [...] Fluoropolymers such as Perfluoroalkoxy alkane (PFA) and Fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) are also used to produce the tubing material due to their high resistance to extreme temperatures. Poor choice of <b>tube</b> <b>material</b> could result in a leak through a tube between the shell and tube sides causing fluid cross-contamination and possibly loss of pressure.|$|E

5000|$|Designing {{the process}} {{has in the past}} been a {{challenging}} task, since initial analytical modeling is possible only for limited cases. Advances in FEA and FEM in recent years has enabled hydroform processes to be more widely engineered for varieties of parts and materials. Often FEM simulations must be performed in order to find a feasible process solution and to define the correct loading curves: pressure vs. time and axial feed vs. time. In the case of more complex tube hydroformed parts the tube must be pre-bent prior to loading into the hydroforming die. Bending is done sequentially {{along the length of the}} tube, with the tube being bent around bending discs (or dies) as the tube length is fed in. Bending can be done with or without mandrels. This additional complexity of process further increases the reliance on FEM for designing and evaluating manufacturing processes. The feasibility of a hydroforming process must take into consideration the initial <b>tube</b> <b>material</b> properties and its potential for variation, along with the bending process, hydraulic pressure throughout the forming process, in inclusion of axial feed or not, in order to predict metal formability.|$|E
