5|$|<b>The</b> <b>stakes</b> <b>were</b> {{raised in}} the {{conflict}} on 10 October, when the High Court declared valid the Act granting the territories two senators each. In a half-Senate election, most successful candidates would not take their places until 1 July 1976, but the territories' senators, and those filling Field's and Bunton's seats, would assume their seats at once. This gave Labor an outside chance of controlling the Senate, at least until 1 July 1976.|$|E
5|$|Djokovic and Murray met for {{the first}} time since the {{aforementioned}} French Open final in the championship match of the season-concluding ATP World Tour Finals in London in November. Of the five meetings (all in championship matches) that took place between the pair in 2016, this one had added significance, as for the first time in tournament history, the two finalists had the chance to become year-end number 1 by winning the title. <b>The</b> <b>stakes</b> <b>were</b> high in Djokovic's case, as a win would have seen him win his fifth consecutive year-end title, and sixth overall (matching the record held by Roger Federer); Murray, on the other hand, was shooting for his first year-end title, having qualified for the championship match for the first time. Ultimately, Murray won in straight sets, ensuring he ended the year ranked world number one, and also becoming the first man other than Djokovic, Federer or Rafael Nadal to finish the year at the top of the rankings since Andy Roddick in 2003.|$|E

25|$|The {{issue of}} {{privilege}} gradually made Johnson reconsider {{his own business}} career. 'Traction' (streetcar) companies depended on route franchises granted by city councils; political connections and payoffs gave favored companies the upper hand.

25|$|The 1876 {{match against}} Steinitz {{was held at}} the West-end Chess Club in London. <b>The</b> <b>stakes</b> <b>were</b> £60 a side with the winner taking all.

25|$|The German foreign {{ministry}} at Wilhelmstraße, {{on the other}} hand, wanted to exploit Finland's precarious situation {{after the fall of}} Vyborg to connect military aid to political concessions.

25|$|The limes {{itself is}} a {{relatively}} simple construction.

The Limes had a deeper ditch and a higher mound. <b>The</b> <b>stakes</b> <b>were</b> higher too and in front of the ditch while on several parts of the limes, instead of stakes there was a simple stone wall.|$|E

The team go {{off to a good}} start with McCarthy won an eighth Munster medal following a 0–13 to 0–11 defeat of Clare in a dour provincial decider. This victory paved the way for Cork to take on Kilkenny in the subsequent All-Ireland final. <b>The</b> <b>stakes</b> <b>were</b> high as Cork were attempting to capture a first three in-a-row since 1954. The game, however, was not the classic that many expected. Cork were never really troubled over the course of the seventy minutes and a Jimmy Barry-Murphy goal helped the team to a 1–15 to 2–8 victory over their age-old rivals. This victory gave Cork a third All-Ireland title in succession and gave McCarthy a fifth and final All-Ireland medal.|$|E
25|$|Up to and {{including}} the 1894 Steinitz–Lasker match, both players, with their backers, generally contributed equally to the purse, following the custom of important matches in the 19th century {{before there was a}} generally recognized world champion. For example: <b>the</b> <b>stakes</b> <b>were</b> £100 a side in both the second Staunton vs Saint-Amant match (Paris, 1843) and the Anderssen vs Steinitz match (London, 1866); Steinitz and Zukertort played their 1886 match for £400 a side. Lasker introduced the practise of demanding that the challenger should provide the whole of the purse, and his successors followed his example up to World War II. This requirement makes arranging world championship matches more difficult, for example: Marshall challenged Lasker in 1904 but could not raise the money until 1907; in 1911 Lasker and Rubinstein agreed in principle to a world championship match, but this was never played as Rubinstein could not raise the money. In the early 1920s, Alekhine, Rubinstein and Nimzowitsch all challenged Capablanca, but only Alekhine was able to raise the US $10,000 that Capablanca demanded, and not until 1927.|$|E

500|$|Manchester United were Arsenal's opponents for the semi-final, staged at Villa Park on 3 April 2004.

[...] By 28 November, the Austrians had constructed enough parallels and batteries to fire upon the oldest of the bridges crossing the river. The bridge was entirely demolished; the French repaired it; the Austrians demolished it again. [...] It lay so directly {{in the line of fire}} of one of the batteries that it was an easy target. [...] The French could not keep it intact three days straight and furthermore, its wreckage threatened a pontoon bridge immediately downstream.|$|E

Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations, gave Vienen a positive review, and wrote, [...] "after watching 'Vienen', I can honestly say that for once of the few times this season, it felt good to be an X-Files fan again". Kessenich praised the significant development in Mulder and Scully's relationship and the return of the [...] "fourth season version" [...] of the black oil; the 1998 movie had dramatically altered the nature of the substanceinfected hosts gestate aliens inside their bodies rather than merely being taken over.|$|E
