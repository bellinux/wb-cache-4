5|$|Dialogue {{heard in}} the dream {{sequence}} uses a distinctive reversed manner of speech. This was achieved by recording the actors' line phonetically reversed, and playing this audio backwards. David Lynch had begun experimenting with the technique in 1971, and had originally planned {{to use it in}} his 1977 debut feature, Eraserhead, before it finally found use in this episode. Describing <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>learning</b> his lines backwards, Anderson notes that he first worked out the phonemes of each word rather than simply reading it back to front, and disregarded the inflection of any given word as this helped bolster the discordant effect of the end result. The reversed audio was also altered with a slight reverb effect. The actors were required to perform their movements backwards, as elements of the scene would be reversed entirely.|$|E

The main findings revolves around how cheating was used and how the framework, set up by the school institution and play elements. The fact that elements of play were implemented influenced both <b>the</b> <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> <b>learning</b> and <b>the</b> learning outcome the students articulated. <b>The</b> <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> <b>learning</b> and how experiences are structured, and related to everyday life, is mainly seen through the theories of Oskar Negt and Thomas Ziehe.

It will be discussed how the frames set up by the high school and the role play, influences <b>the</b> <b>processes</b> we have seen. Thomas Duus Henriksen and Johan Huizinga are used to elaborate how play can be understood, and how role play can be seen in a context <b>of</b> <b>learning.</b> Conclusively it is shown that there are similarities between ‘regular’ education and the role play.

25|$|Foote edited The Pica, {{the student}} {{newspaper}} of Greenville High School, and frequently used {{the paper to}} lampoon the school's principal. In 1935, Foote applied to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, hoping to join with the older Percy boys, but was denied admission because of an unfavorable recommendation from his high school principal. He presented himself for admission anyway, and as result of a battery of admissions tests, he was accepted. In 1936 he was initiated in the Alpha Delta chapter of the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity.

25|$|In Steven Johnson's book, Everything Bad Is Good for You, {{he argues}} that video games in fact demand far more from a player than {{traditional}} games like Monopoly. To experience the game, the player must first determine the objectives, {{as well as how}} to complete them. They must then learn the game controls and how the human-machine interface works, including menus and HUDs. Beyond such skills, which after some time become quite fundamental and are taken for granted by many gamers, video games are based upon the player navigating (and eventually mastering) a highly complex system with many variables. This requires a strong analytical ability, as well as flexibility and adaptability. He argues that <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>learning</b> the boundaries, goals, and controls of a given game is often a highly demanding one that calls on many different areas of cognitive function. Indeed, most games require a great deal of patience and focus from the player, and, contrary to the popular perception that games provide instant gratification, games actually delay gratification far longer than other forms of entertainment such as film or even many books. Some research suggests video games may even increase players' attention capacities.|$|E

40|$|North–South {{municipal}} partnerships {{that are}} based on practitioner-to-practitioner collaboration are explicitly concerned with joint learning and knowledge production for more effective practice.

2500|$|Technology, Davidson argues, re-shapes the way {{we learn}} and process new {{information}} in some fundamental ways.

Within this multitasking that the new workplace requires, Davidson urges her readers to re-imagine the concept of distraction. We are cultured to imagine that shopping online while finishing a report or answering personal emails and simultaneously working on a project are distractions which are detrimental to our productivity and efficiency. Every time we switch tasks, we are hurting our work. Davidson argues, however, that these small distractions afforded by technology should be thought of as innovations. [...] "When we feel distracted, something’s up. Distraction is really another word for saying that something is new, strange or different.

2500|$|Such was the {{popularity}} of Augstein's articles that the German author Hans Hellmut Kirst published a spy novel featuring Sorge as the hero while Hans-Otto Meissner wrote the book Der Fall Sorge (The Sorge Case) that was {{a cross between a}} novel and a history, blending fact and fiction together with a greater emphasis on the latter. Meissner had served as third secretary at the German Embassy in Tokyo and knew Sorge. Meissner's book, which was written as a thriller that engaged in [...] "orientalism" [...] with the portrayal of Japan as a strange, mysterious country where the enigmatic and charismatic master-spy Sorge operated as he infiltrated both the Japanese state and the German Embassy. Meissner presented Sorge as the consummate spy, a cool professional dressed in a rumpled trench coat and fedora who was a great womanizer, and much of the book is concerned with Sorge's various relationships. Later on, Meissner presented Sorge as a rather megalomaniac figure, in the process changing Sorge's motivation from loyalty to communism to colossal egoism, as he has Sorge rant about his equal dislike for both Stalin and Hitler, and has him say that he only supplies enough information to both regimes to manipulate them into destroying each other as it suits him to play one against the other. At the book's climax, Sorge has agreed to work for the American OSS in exchange for being settled to settle in Hawaii and he is in <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>learning</b> that Japan is planning on bombing Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, but his love of women prove to be his undoing as the Japanese dancer Kiyomi rejects his sexual advances.

6000|$|There {{are various}} {{complications}} which blur {{the sharpness of}} this distinction in practice. To begin with, many instincts mature gradually, and while they are immature an animal may act in a fumbling manner which {{is very difficult to}} distinguish from learning. James ("Psychology," [...] ii, 407) maintains that children walk by instinct, and that the awkwardness of their first attempts is only {{due to the fact that}} the instinct has not yet ripened. He hopes that [...] "some scientific widower, left alone with his offspring at the critical moment, may ere long test this suggestion on the living subject." [...] However this may be, he quotes evidence to show that [...] "birds do not LEARN to fly," [...] but fly by instinct when they reach the appropriate age (ib., p. 406). In the second place, instinct often gives only a rough outline of the sort of thing to do, in which case learning is necessary in order to acquire certainty and precision in action. In the third place, even in the clearest cases of acquired habit, such as speaking, some instinct is required to set in motion <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>learning.</b> In the case of speaking, the chief instinct involved is commonly supposed to be that of imitation, but this may be questioned.

60|$|Again, when children, {{with more}} than usual carelessness, break or lose the things given to them, the natural penalty--the penalty which makes grown-up persons more careful--is the {{consequent}} inconvenience. The lack of the lost or damaged article, {{and the cost of}} replacing it, are the experiences by which men and women are disciplined in these matters; and the experiences of children should be as much as possible assimilated to theirs. We do not refer to that early period at which toys are pulled to pieces in <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>learning</b> their physical properties, and at which the results of carelessness cannot be understood; but to a later period, when the meaning and advantages of property are perceived. When a boy, old enough to possess a penknife, uses it so roughly as to snap the blade, or leaves it in the grass by some hedge-side where he was cutting a stick, a thoughtless parent, or some indulgent relative, will commonly forthwith buy him another, not seeing that, by doing this, a valuable lesson is prevented. In such a case, a father may properly explain that penknives cost money, and that to get money requires labour; that he cannot afford to purchase new penknives for one who loses or breaks them; and that until he sees evidence of greater carefulness he must decline to make good the loss. A parallel discipline will serve to check extravagance.|$|E
