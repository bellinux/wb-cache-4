5|$|Cavities are {{in great}} demand for nesting by other cavity nesters, so {{woodpeckers}} face {{competition for the}} nesting sites they excavate {{from the moment the}} hole becomes usable. This may come from other species of woodpecker, or other cavity nesting birds like swallows and starlings. Woodpeckers may aggressively harass potential competitors, and also use other strategies to reduce <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> of being usurped from their nesting site; for example the red-crowned woodpecker digs its nest in the underside of a small branch, which reduces <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> that a larger species will take it over and expand it.|$|E
