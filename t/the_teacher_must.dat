40|$|Much of the {{hyperbole}} surrounding technology {{appears to}} assume that learners {{will be able to}} take control of their own learning and that teachers will be relegated to the position of facilitator. However, this paper argues that, in bringing computers into <b>the</b> classroom, <b>teachers</b> <b>must</b> play a more fundamental role in teaching and learning, in terms of both process and content. So-called 'blended learning' calls for the best elements of traditional classroom-based teaching and learning to be combined with the best elements of technology.

2500|$|An {{article in}} American Psychologist [...] sums up Milgram's {{obedience}} experiments: In Milgram's basic paradigm, a subject {{walks into a}} laboratory believing that s/he {{is about to take}} part in a study of memory and learning. [...] After being assigned the role of a teacher, the subject is asked to teach word associations to a fellow subject (who in reality is a collaborator of the experimenter). The teaching method, however, is unconventional—administering increasingly higher electric shocks to the learner. Once the presumed shock level reaches a certain point, the subject is thrown into a conflict. On the one hand, the strapped learner demands to be set free, he appears to suffer pain, and going all the way may pose a risk to his health. On the other hand, the experimenter, if asked, insists that the experiment is not as unhealthy as it appears to be, and that <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>must</b> go on. In sharp contrast to the expectations of professionals and laymen alike, some 65% of all subjects continue to administer shocks up to the very highest levels.More recent tests of the experiment have found that it only works under certain conditions; in particular, when participants believe the results are necessary for the [...] "good of science".|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} that the researcher wants to investigate the teachers’ perception in comparing between 1994 curriculum and competence-based curriculum of MAN 3 Malang. The design of this study is descriptive research. The population of this study is all of teachers of MAN 3 Malang. The sample of this study is taken by using purposive sampling technique and the result is UAN subject matter teachers who teach Indonesian, English, and Math. The real sample is 9 teachers of MAN 3 Malang. The instrument that is used in this research is an unstructured interview. After the researcher collects and analyzes the data, the three of Indonesian subject matter teachers of MAN 3 Malang conclude that competence-based curriculum is more difficult than 1994 curriculum because <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>must</b> know each student. Meanwhile, the three of English subject matter teachers conclude that competence-based curriculum is more difficult than 1994 curriculum because <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>must</b> know each student’s ability and should have the different technique in teaching learning process between low and high students. Moreover, the three of Math subject matter teachers conclude that competence-based curriculum is more difficult than 1994 curriculum because it is new curriculum and it has not been implemented yet...|$|R

40|$|The enquiry of {{this project}} is based on what is {{perceived}} as important as to how specific students and teachers experience culture in the Danish public schools. The empirical data consists of four interviews with several students and one <b>teacher</b> and <b>the</b> Clause of Objectives of the Danish Public School (cf appendix 5). These will be the objects of theoretical reflection through a constructivist and a static understanding of culture, expounded on via Herder, Hofstede, Eriksen and Hall, terms of recognition and violation by Axel Honneth, terms of field, cultural, social, and symbolic capital by Pierre Bourdieu and additionally three of the main aspects of positioning theory. Based on the project’s analysis and discussion, it is concluded that the Clause of Objectives demand that <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>must</b> provide <b>the</b> students with {{a certain level of}} knowledge of Danish culture and an understanding of other cultures. This is demanded without a definition of Danish culture and how culture in general should be perceived. According to our respondents this missing link could have severe and various effects as to how culture in the class in the aspects of community, recognition and teachings all rely on how culture is perceived and communicated by <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> and students as well as the inequity in the perception of culture. We have therefore concluded that <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>must</b> be conscious of their approach towards this vague demand of the Clause of Objectives so as to avoid the aforementioned severe effects...|$|R

60|$|A {{stranger}} who should come among us, would suppose from {{the tone of}} our religious journals, and from the general aspect of society {{on the subject of}} religion, that the whole community was divided into a thousand contending sects, who hold nothing in common, and whose sole objects are, the annoyance and destruction of each other. But if we leave out of view some hundreds, or if you please, some thousands of theological controversialists, who manage the public discussions, and say and do all that really comes before the public on this subject, it will be found, that there is vastly more religious truth admitted by common consent, among the people of New England, than is generally supposed. This common ground, I shall endeavor briefly to describe. For it is very plain, that <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>must,</b> in ordinary cases, confine himself to it. By common consent, however, I do not mean the consent of every body; I mean that of the great majority of serious, thinking men.|$|E
60|$|I {{trust the}} {{principle}} which I have been attempting to enforce, is fully before the reader's mind, namely, that moral and religious instruction in a school, {{being in a}} great degree extra-official, in its nature, must be carried no farther than the teacher can go with the common consent, either expressed or implied, {{of those who have}} founded, and who support his school. Of course, if those founders forbid it altogether, {{they have a right to}} do so, and <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>must</b> submit. The only question that can justly arise, is, whether, he will remain in such a situation, or seek employment, where a door of usefulness, here closed against him, will be opened. While he remains, he must honestly and fully submit to the wishes of those, in whose hands Providence has placed the ultimate responsibility of training up the children of his school. It is only for a partial and specific purpose, that they are placed under his care.|$|E
60|$|Another {{means of}} {{securing}} the personal attachment of boys, is to notice them,--to {{take an interest}} in their pursuits, and the qualities and powers which they value in one another. It is astonishing what an influence is exerted by such little circumstances, as stopping at a play ground a moment, to notice with interest, though perhaps without saying a word, speed of running,--or exactness of aim,--the force with which a ball is struck,--or the dexterity with which it is caught or thrown. <b>The</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>must,</b> indeed, in all his intercourse with his pupils, never forget his station, nor allow them to lay aside the respect, without which authority cannot be maintained.

60|$|Now, in {{some such}} cases as this, great good may be done both {{in respect to}} the individual, and {{to the state of}} public {{sentiment}} in school, by openly exposing a boy's misconduct. <b>The</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>must</b> always take care, however, that the state of mind and character in the guilty individual, is such that public exposure is adapted to work well as a remedy, and also that in managing it he carries the sympathies of the other boys with him. To secure this, he must avoid all harsh and exaggerated expressions, or direct reproaches, and while he is mild and gentle and forbearing himself, lead the boys to understand and feel the nature of the sin which he exposes. The opportunities for doing this to advantage will, however, be rare. Generally it will be best to manage cases of discipline more privately, so as to protect the characters of those that offend.|$|E
60|$|If now, {{the teacher}} has taken the course {{recommended}} in this chapter; if he has, by his general influence in the school, done all {{in his power to}} bring the majority of his pupils to the side of order and discipline; if he has then studied, attentively and impartially, the characters of those who cannot thus be led; if he has endeavored to make them his friends, and to acquire, by every means, a personal influence over them; if, finally, when they do wrong, he goes, plainly, but in a gentle and delicate manner, to them, and lays before them the whole case; if he has done all this, he has gone as far as moral influence will carry him. My opinion is, that this course, faithfully and judiciously pursued, will in almost all instances succeed; but it will not in all; and where it fails, there must be other, and more vigorous and decided measures. What these measures of restraint or punishment shall be, must depend upon the circumstances of the case; but in resorting to them, <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>must</b> be decided and unbending.|$|E
60|$|The course above recommended, is {{not trying}} lax and inefficient measures, {{for a long}} time, in hopes of their being {{ultimately}} successful, and then, when they are found not to be so, changing the policy. There should be, through the whole, the tone and manner of authority, not of persuasion. <b>The</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>must</b> be a monarch, and while he is gentle and forbearing, always looking on the favorable side of conduct so far as guilt is concerned, he must have an eagle eye, and an efficient hand, so far as relates to arresting the evil, and stopping the consequences. He may slowly and cautiously, and even tenderly approach a delinquent. He may be several days in gathering around him the circumstances, {{of which he is}} ultimately to avail himself, in bringing him to submission; but, while he proceeds thus slowly, and tenderly, he must come with the air of authority and power. The fact that the teacher bases all his plans, on the idea of his ultimate authority, in every case, may be perfectly evident to all the pupils, while he proceeds with moderation and gentleness, in all his specific measures. Let it be seen, then, that the constitution of your school is a monarchy, absolute and unlimited,--but let it also be seen, that the one who holds the power, is himself under the control of moral principle, in all that he does, and that he endeavors to make the same moral principle which guides him, go as far as it is possible to make it go, in the government of his subjects.|$|E
