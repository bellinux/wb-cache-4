5|$|A {{group of}} {{volunteer}} citizens in London's East End called the Whitechapel Vigilance Committee patrolled the streets looking for suspicious characters, {{partly because of}} dissatisfaction with the police effort. They petitioned <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>to</b> raise a reward {{for information about the}} killer, and hired private detectives to question witnesses independently.|$|E
5|$|Ali {{also sought}} to limit the {{influence}} of the al-Azhar sheikhs by allocating positions within <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>to</b> those educated outside of al-Azhar. He sent select students to France to be educated under a Western system and created an educational system based on that model that was parallel to, and thus bypassed, the system of al-Azhar.|$|E

The Salisbury government sent troops to the town to clear the barricades by force after {{the reading of the}} Riot Act.|$|E
5|$|By 1990, 52,000 black {{families}} had been settled on 6.5 million acres. This was insufficient {{to deal with}} the country's overcrowding problem, which was being exacerbated by the growth in the black population. That year, Zimbabwe's parliament passed an amendment allowing <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>to</b> expropriate land at a fixed price while denying land-owners the right of appeal to the courts. The government hoped that by doing so it could settle 110,000 {{black families}} on 13 million acres, which would require the expropriation of approximately half of all white-owned land. Zimbabwe's Commercial Farmers Union argued that the proposed measures would wreck the country's economy, urging <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>to</b> instead settle landless blacks on the half-a-million acres of land that was either unproductive or state-owned.|$|E
5|$|Casares {{failed to}} heed Prieto's {{warnings}} {{of a military}} conspiracy involving several generals who disliked professional politicians and wanted to replace <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>to</b> prevent the dissolution of Spain.

5|$|Despite the {{findings}} of Rae and Anderson, the Admiralty did not plan another search of its own. Britain officially labelled the crew deceased in service on 31 March 1854.

The expedition ship, the steam schooner Fox, bought via public subscription, sailed from Aberdeen on 2 July 1857.|$|E

5|$|Falun Gong sources {{overseas}} {{questioned the}} official Chinese government {{account of the}} event, and apparent inconsistencies in government's official narrative led to a hypothesis that the self-immolation was staged by <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>to</b> justify the persecution against Falun Gong by portraying its practitioners as irrational and suicidal. According to this hypothesis, the self-immolation participants were paid actors, and were presumably assured that the flames would be extinguished before doing real harm.|$|E
5|$|Fort Smith {{was chosen}} to house the civil service because of its {{geographical}} location and state of development.

The community was the easiest for <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>to</b> access, and the most well developed community, closest to Ottawa.|$|E
5|$|From {{the point}} of view of the {{domestic}} country, the subsidy is welfare improving. The 20 million subsidy is a transfer from <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>to</b> the firm hence it has no effect on national welfare (ignoring costs of taxation; as long as these are not too large the basic insight of the model goes through). Additionally the domestic firm gains 50 million which would have otherwise gone to the foreign firm.|$|E

50|$|In January 2015, <b>the</b> <b>government</b> decided <b>to</b> annul <b>the</b> land {{allotment}} for Shimoga airport because of “indifference and infighting” among the promoters.

5|$|In 1847, King Kamehameha III {{issued a}} one-cent coin, most likely {{struck by a}} firm in New England.

5|$|In 1985, Milner-Barry {{fiercely}} {{defended the}} reputation of Gordon Welchman, who had come under posthumous criticism for publishing details about the wartime work of Hut 6.
