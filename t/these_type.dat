5|$|Many {{proteins}} {{undergo a}} range of posttranslational modifications, when additional chemical groups {{are attached to the}} amino acids in proteins. Some modifications can produce hydrophobic lipoproteins, or hydrophilic glycoproteins. <b>These</b> <b>type</b> of modification allow the reversible targeting of a protein to a membrane. For example, the addition and removal of the fatty acid palmitic acid to cysteine residues in some signaling proteins causes the proteins to attach and then detach from cell membranes.|$|E
5|$|Type I are {{squamous}} {{epithelial cells}} {{that make up}} the alveolar wall structure. They have extremely thin walls that enable an easy gas exchange. <b>These</b> <b>type</b> I cells also make up the alveolar septa which separate each alveolus. The septa consist of an epithelial lining and associated basement membranes. Type I cells are not able to divide, and consequently rely on differentiation from Type II cells.|$|E
5|$|The 1982-dated issues {{banknotes}} differed {{little from}} the earlier, {{except that it}} took into account of the renaming of the country's capital from Salisbury to Harare.

5|$|This is {{the most}} common type of {{thunderstorm}} development. Mature thunderstorms are found near the center of the cluster, while dissipating thunderstorms exist on their downwind side. Multicell storms form as clusters of storms but may then evolve into one or more squall lines. While each cell of the cluster may only last 20minutes, the cluster itself may persist for hours at a time. They often arise from convective updrafts in or near mountain ranges and linear weather boundaries, such as strong cold fronts or troughs of low pressure. <b>These</b> <b>type</b> of storms are stronger than the single-cell storm, yet much weaker than the supercell storm. Hazards with the multicell cluster include moderate-sized hail, flash flooding, and weak tornadoes.|$|E
