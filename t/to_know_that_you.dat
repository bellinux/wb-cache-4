500|$|By January 2013, Zedd {{clarified}} {{that due}} to their busy schedules {{it was difficult to}} complete the project and work progressed mainly during the tour. Talking to Sirius XM Radio in December 2013, where she gave an in-depth analysis of each song from the album, Gaga further expanded on the concept of new-wave feminism: [...] "The record's all about being comfortable underneath, because you are strong enough <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> don't have to be on top to know you're worth it," [...] she concluded.|$|E

Egoyan {{assembled}} many Canadian actors he had worked with in prior films, including Bruce Greenwood, Gabrielle Rose and Sarah Polley. Egoyan explained the benefit of working with a familiar cast, saying [...] "When you’re working on a limited production schedule, it’s a comfort <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> know the personalities involved, {{you know what they}} need as opposed to having to discover that and be surprised by that." ...|$|E

500|$|Many {{critics of}} the time and since have {{declared}} it Cagney's best film, drawing parallels between Cohan and Cagney; they both began their careers in vaudeville, struggled for years before reaching the peak of their profession, were surrounded with family and married early, and both had a wife who was happy to sit back while he went on to stardom. The film was nominated for eight Academy Awards and won three, including Cagney's for Best Actor. In his acceptance speech, Cagney said, [...] "I've always maintained that in this business, you're {{only as good as the}} other fellow thinks you are. It's nice <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> people thought I did a good job. And don't forget that it was a good part, too." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{second game}} {{received}} mixed to positive reviews, with a reviewer from PC Gamer commenting {{that what he}} had hoped for in the sequel [...] "was more mind games and more uncertainty. I wanted the plodding animatronic suits to find me and rip my face off in new and interesting ways. I wanted working legs", and that [...] "what I got was a horror game dipping heavily into deception and subtlety". However, {{he also noted that}} [...] "enjoying the good parts, though, comes with a cost of a frustratingly steep difficulty". Destructoid also gave the game a positive review, saying that [...] "It's absolutely terrifying <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> could be attacked at any moment from multiple avenues" [...] and also praised the introduction of new animatronics and mechanics, but also criticizing the jumpscares and calling the game [...] "too hard for its own good".|$|E
500|$|Fincher {{stated that}} every main cast member {{was their first}} choice. In the first read through, he said [...] "I want {{everybody}} here <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> represent our first choice— each actor here represents our first choice for these characters. So do not fuck this up." [...] Spacey, whose last regular television role was in the series Wiseguy, responded positively to the script. He then played Richard III, which Fincher said was [...] "great training". Spacey supported the decision to release all of the episodes at once, believing {{that this type of}} release pattern will be increasingly common with television shows. He said, [...] "When I ask my friends what they did with their weekend, they say, 'Oh, I stayed in and watched three seasons of Breaking Bad or it's two seasons of Game of Thrones". He was officially cast on March 18, 2011. Robin Wright was approached by Fincher to star in the series when they worked together in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. She was cast as Claire Underwood in June 2011. Kate Mara was cast as Zoe Barnes in early February 2012. Mara's sister, Rooney Mara, worked with Fincher in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, and when Kate Mara read the part of Zoe, she [...] "fell in love with the character" [...] and asked her sister to [...] "put in a word for me with Fincher".

500|$|Diamond Rio {{released}} its twenty-third official chart single, [...] "Stuff", in May 2000. The song was {{originally intended to}} be the title track to their sixth studio album, {{which would have been}} released on August 22 of the same year, but according to Truman, [...] "Certain radio stations, for some reason, didn't want to play 'Stuff'." [...] As a result, [...] "Stuff" [...] was withdrawn after peaking at number 36 on the country charts, and the album was delayed until February 2001. Following this song's failure, the band released [...] "One More Day" [...] later in 2000. The song was written by Steven Dale Jones and Bobby Tomberlin, the same two writers who wrote [...] "She Misses Him on Sunday the Most". [...] "One More Day" [...] went on to spend two non-consecutive weeks at No.1 on the country charts, with the album, by this point re-titled One More Day, having its release date moved up to February 6, 2001. The song also peaked at No.29 on the Billboard Hot 100, in addition to reaching top 10 on the Adult Contemporary charts (the band's first appearance on that chart). Regarding the song's popularity among fans who have used the song to cope with personal losses, Prout said, [...] "Actually, 'One More Day' was recorded as a love song. Then one of Oklahoma State's basketball team's plane went down, then in early 2001 we lost Dale [...] in Daytona, and then of course, 9/11 came after that. And every event of that year, the song took on a different meaning to different people... We hear quite often in e-mails and people talking to us in shows. If you're asking how it makes us feel? Pretty darn special... <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> had that impact on someone's life and helped in a tough time of healing and hope." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Guardians Mikki Kendall wrote, [...] "In 'Flawless' (a {{track that}} leaked as 'Bow Down' over the summer), Beyonce quotes from author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's TedX talk 'We {{should all be}} feminists', adroitly {{addressing}} {{the idea that she}} is somehow anti-feminist for not fitting into the boxes others project onto her. It's clear that like a lot of black American women, the mainstream middle class white feminist narratives with which we are so familiar aren't necessarily compatible with Beyonce's view of herself. This album makes it clear that her feminism isn't academic; isn't about waves, or labels. It simply is a part of her {{as much as anything else}} in her life. She's pro-woman without being anti-man, and she wants the world <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can be feminist on a personal level without sacrificing emotions, friendships or fun." ...|$|E

[...] The practice was formalised from 1917, under the reign of King George V, who also sent congratulations on the attainment of a 60th Wedding anniversary. Queen Elizabeth II sends a greeting card style with the notation: [...] "I am so pleased <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are celebrating your one-hundredth birthday, I send my congratulations and best wishes to you on such a special occasion", thereafter each few years the card is updated with a current picture of the Queen to ensure people do not receive the same card more than once. The Queen further sends her congratulations on one's 105th birthday and every year thereafter {{as well as on}} special wedding anniversaries; people must apply for greetings three weeks before the event, on the official British Monarch's website.|$|E
