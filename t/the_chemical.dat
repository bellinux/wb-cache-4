Brock escapes to hunt the symbiote, which has gone on a killing spree to obtain brains. He reunites with the symbiote (after finding an alternative source of <b>the</b> <b>chemical),</b> but Paine steals the symbiote for himself. Brock frees the symbiote, and again becomes Venom.|$|E
5|$|A period 1 {{element is}} one of <b>the</b> <b>chemical</b> {{elements}} {{in the first row}} (or period) of the periodic table of <b>the</b> <b>chemical</b> elements. The periodic table is laid out in rows to illustrate periodic (recurring) trends in <b>the</b> <b>chemical</b> behaviour of the elements as their atomic number increases: a new row is begun when chemical behaviour begins to repeat, meaning that elements with similar behaviour fall into the same vertical columns. The first period contains fewer elements than any other row in the table, with only two: hydrogen and helium. This situation can be explained by modern theories of atomic structure. In a quantum mechanical description of atomic structure, this period corresponds to the filling of the 1s orbital. Period 1 elements obey the duet rule in that they need two electrons to complete their valence shell. The maximum number of electrons that these elements can accommodate is two, both in the 1s orbital. Therefore, period 1 can have only two elements.|$|E

5|$|English chemist John Newlands {{produced}} {{a series of}} papers from 1863 to 1866 noting that when the elements were listed in order of increasing atomic weight, similar {{physical and chemical properties}} recurred at intervals of eight; he likened such periodicity to the octaves of music. This so termed Law of Octaves, however, was ridiculed by Newlands' contemporaries, and <b>the</b> <b>Chemical</b> Society refused to publish his work. Newlands was nonetheless able to draft a table of the elements and used it to predict the existence of missing elements, such as germanium. <b>The</b> <b>Chemical</b> Society only acknowledged the significance of his discoveries five years after they credited Mendeleev.|$|E
5|$|In {{his report}} on The Periodic Law of <b>the</b> <b>Chemical</b> Elements, in 1869, Dmitri Mendeleev had implicitly {{predicted}} {{the existence of}} a heavier analog of titanium and zirconium. At the time of his formulation in 1871, Mendeleev believed that the elements were ordered by their atomic masses and placed lanthanum (element 57) in the spot below zirconium. The exact placement of the elements and the location of missing elements was done by determining the specific weight of the elements and comparing <b>the</b> <b>chemical</b> and physical properties.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{predictions}} of <b>the</b> <b>chemical</b> properties of rutherfordium {{were based on}} calculations which indicated that the relativistic effects on the electron shell might be strong enough that the 7p orbitals would have a lower energy level than the 6d orbitals, giving it a valence electron configuration of 6d1 7s2 7p1 or even 7s2 7p2, therefore making the element behave more like lead than hafnium. With better calculation methods and experimental studies of <b>the</b> <b>chemical</b> properties of rutherfordium compounds it could be shown that this does not happen and that rutherfordium instead behaves {{like the rest of}} the group 4 elements.|$|E
