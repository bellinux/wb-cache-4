5|$|<b>The</b> <b>holes</b> <b>in</b> the cuticle {{which allow}} for this {{digestive}} mechanism pose {{a challenge for}} the plant, since they serve as breaks in the cuticle (waxy layer) that protects the plant from desiccation. As a result, P. moranensis is usually found in relatively humid environments. The production of the stalked capture glands and sessile digestive glands is also costly. A {{recent study found that}} the density of these respective glands can be correlated to environmental gradients. For example, capture gland density was found to be highest where prey availability was low, whereas digestive glands density showed direct correlation to prey availability. These results suggest that the amount of investment in carnivorous features is an adaptation to the environmental gradients.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} {{stricken}} from the Navy List on 30 November and salvage work began on 5 December. <b>The</b> <b>holes</b> <b>in</b> the ship's hull {{had to be}} sealed to pump the water out and decrease her draft. The remains of her flight deck and upper hangar could not be made watertight and were removed using dynamite. Pontoons were used to right the ship and she was refloated on 31 July 1946. The salvage job was conducted by the Hitachi Zosen facility in Kure and they scrapped the ship afterward. The job was completed by 12 December 1947.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} forts, the {{garrison}} itself was heavily expanded {{during the initial}} construction years and became the largest garrison in Sweden, taking an exceptional position in Swedish military history of the 20th century; even {{at the start of}} the 21st century, Boden was the largest garrison city in the Swedish Army. Still, no other fortifications than the forts themselves were finished by 1908, and work now started to fill <b>the</b> <b>holes</b> <b>in</b> between them. It was realised that prepared positions were needed for the mobile batteries, and apart from those, three larger battery positions (sometimes called fästen, strongholds) were also constructed at Leåkersberget, Norra Åberget and Svedjeberget. These works were started in 1911 and were finished during the First World War. The last of the three strongholds was positioned in the mountain itself with embrasures in the mountain side, and Leåkersberget had parts of the battery position inside the mountain, but the gun emplacements outsidethe other positions were concrete fortifications above the ground, some inside a bunker and others behind a parapet.|$|E

5|$|In August 1922, Tosa {{was moved}} to Kure, still incomplete. Fifty {{thousand}} people turned out to watch as the battleship was towed out of the harbor by five tugboats. The barbettes for the 406mm (16inch) guns were in place, but no turrets or weapons had been mounted, so <b>the</b> <b>holes</b> <b>in</b> the main deck were covered with a mesh-like material. Her hull was finished, and a superstructure deck, bridge deck and conning tower had been fitted, along with a light signal mast directly aft of the second barbette. The conning tower had to be outfitted as a bridge, as {{there was no other}} suitable location; compared with those of similar ships, it was much smaller, as it only contained two levels and bridge wings. An exhaust pipe resembling an extremely small funnel was fitted so that heat could be supplied within the ship.|$|E
5|$|Several {{suggestions}} {{have been}} made {{for the history of}} the Great Stone. There was a succession of plagues in Manchester from the 14th century onwards, and during the Great Plague of 1655–56 <b>the</b> <b>holes</b> <b>in</b> the top of the stone were filled with vinegar or holy water, through which coins were passed in the belief that would halt the spread of the disease. But the holes are probably too deep for that to have been the stone's original purpose. It may have been a marker on the Roman road between Northwich and Manchester, or some kind of boundary marker. The Great Stone is also thought to have been the base of an Anglo-Saxon cross shaft. A local legend had it that the stone was slowly sinking into the earth, and that its ultimate disappearance would mark the end of the world.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese {{attack on}} the north-west coast came {{on the night of}} 8/9 February, {{beginning}} with a heavy artillery and aerial bombardment of the 22nd Brigade's positions throughout the day, followed by a waterborne assault across the Johore Strait, which began around 10:30pm. Confronted by 16 battalions from the Japanese 5th and 18th Divisions, which concentrated upon the 2/18th's and 2/20th's positions, the 2/18th's two forward companies—'A' and 'C'—strongly resisted two frontal assaults during the day. Heavy casualties were inflicted on the Japanese {{over the course of several}} hours, but the defenders were eventually forced back by heavy indirect fire and overwhelming numbers. Exploiting <b>the</b> <b>holes</b> <b>in</b> the battalion's perimeter to avoid resistance, by 1:30am on 9 February the Japanese had penetrated towards battalion headquarters near the Lim Chau Kang road, threatening to roll up the battalion's rear. Varley then ordered the forward companies to make a fighting withdrawal and fall back on battalion headquarters. Heavy fighting followed, during which the Australians suffered grave losses as groups became lost in the darkness in the thick country, before the battalion was able to re-establish itself around Ama Keng.|$|E
