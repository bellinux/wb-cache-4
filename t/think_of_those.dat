That takes courage, and also we shouldn’t forget that this account today will also overshadow all of the good that they also did.|$|E
500|$|Feroz Khan's Janbaaz (1986) {{told the}} story of a man {{fighting}} the drug menace. The film became known for its steamy love scene involving Kapadia and male lead Anil Kapoor, in which the two also shared a full on kiss, something Hindi movie-goers were not accustomed to in those days. In that same year she acted opposite Saagar co-star Kamal Haasan in her first regional film, Vikram, a Tamil-language sci-fi feature. She played the minor part of Inimaasi, a young princess who falls for the title character, played by Haasan. At that time, she also worked in numerous Hindi films made by producers from the South, including Pataal Bhairavi, which she detested. She has confessed to accepting these roles for financial gain rather than artistic merit during this period, noting, [...] "I shudder even now when I <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> films. As an artiste I got totally corrupted." ...|$|E
2500|$|Two {{months after}} his father's death, Gansevoort entered the cap and fur business. Maria sought {{consolation}} in her faith and in April was admitted {{as a member of}} the First Reformed Dutch Church. Uncle Peter Gansevoort, who was one of the directors of the New York State Bank, got Herman a job as clerk for $150 a year. What he thought of all the drama in his young life is a question biographers answer by citing Redburn: [...] "I had learned to think much and bitterly before my time," [...] the narrator remarks, adding, [...] "I must not <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> delightful days, before my father became a bankrupt... and we removed from the city; for when I <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> days, something rises up in my throat and almost strangles me." [...] According to Arvin's influential suggestion, with Melville, one has to reckon with the [...] "tormented psychology, of the decayed patrician." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, {{the earl}} always <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> around him.

2500|$|At home again, she embraces {{her true}} {{identity}} {{and becomes a}} portrait photographer noted for her distinct images of the Jewish people. Her sister announces her next sitter and when Charles appears, she quietly proceeds to take his portrait. When she has finished he asks her if they are done, and she says yes, [...] "quite done," [...] dismissing him. But his portrait remains foremost among the scattering of prints in her studio, as she muses, [...] "I hardly <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> days at all." ...|$|E
2500|$|What a history! A {{fugitive}} from Egypt and Palestine, here I am {{and find}} help, love, fostering in you people. With real rapture I <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> origins {{of mine and}} this whole nexus of destiny, through which the oldest memories {{of the human race}} stand {{side by side with the}} latest developments...The thing which all my life seemed to me the greatest shame, which was the misery and misfortune of my life—having been born a Jewess—this I should on no account now wish to have missed.|$|E
2500|$|Perry {{described}} the process [...] "a very pure moment for me" [...] and continued saying, [...] " [...] where I started my creative juices. And also {{it kind of}} exudes this euphoric feeling because everybody remembers what their teenage dreams were — all the girls that were on your poster walls." [...] After she recorded the vocals, McKee pulled Luke and Martin aside and told them her idea, to which they responded, [...] "Well why didn't you {{say that in the}} first place?". The chorus was rewritten, and the line [...] "Skin tight jeans" [...] was taken from the early [...] "trying me on" [...] version. When the final version was finished, McKee said, [...] "We were all so pumped that it had paid off. I remember Max sitting back and saying 'I wish we could bottle this feeling'. It was really magical." [...] Perry commented that even though the song was rewritten many times, she was [...] "so happy to finally get somewhere that we all agreed on" [...] after it was finished. During an interview in June 2010, Perry confirmed [...] "Teenage Dream" [...] as the second single from the album, and said that the song was about [...] "kind of like feeling that way when you were a teenager: really emotional, really invested..... It's intense being in love and being a teenager." [...] After confirming that [...] "Teenage Dream" [...] was also the title of the album, she explained that it was a throwback to her teenage years, as she thought back to her youth while contemplating marriage to her boyfriend Russell Brand. She added, [...] "To me, this year is pretty heavy. I am going to be getting married and putting out this record, and there is so much going on that it's nice to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> young dreams." ...|$|E

Of excess consumption. On this topic think whatever, since legal interventions to address intemperate appetites have {{given rise to}} a multitude of tales. Law has long been fascinated by what people eat, drink, smoke, snort, and their many games of chance...|$|R

50|$|This seems counter-intuitive: one usually <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> {{with the}} most {{decision-making}} responsibility as the ones {{with the most}} stressful lives. One theory is that the lower one is on the chain of command, the less control one has over his or her life. Not having to take orders on how to perform a task, or when to do it, results in lower heart rate, stress hormones, and blood pressure than being told how and when to perform it.|$|R
