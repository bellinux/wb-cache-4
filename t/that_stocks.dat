25|$|The {{antivenom}} {{was developed}} by a team headed by Struan Sutherland at the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories in Melbourne. Since the antivenom became available in 1981, {{there have been no}} recorded fatalities from Sydney funnel-web spider bites. In September 2012, it was reported <b>that</b> <b>stocks</b> of antivenom were running low, and members of the public were asked to catch the spiders so that they could be milked for their venom. One dose of antivenom requires around 70 milkings from a spider.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, {{the problem}} of the commons is also glaringly visible in this matter. Open access to {{resources}} leads to no incentive to conserve stocks, and actors which try to conserve lose out compared to the others when it comes to maximizing economic output. Therefore, there appeared to be a lack of concern by tribes of the First Nations about the sustainability of the fur trade. The problem of over-exploitation is not helped {{by the fact that the}} efforts by the French to remove the middlemen such as the Huron who increasingly resented their influence meant <b>that</b> <b>stocks</b> were put under more pressure. All these factors contributed to an unsustainable trade pattern in furs which depleted beaver stocks very fast.|$|E
40|$|This paper shows <b>that</b> <b>stock</b> {{volatility}} increases during recessions {{and financial}} crises from 1834 - 1987. The evidence reinforces the notion <b>that</b> <b>stock</b> prices {{are an important}} business cycle indicator. Using two different statistical models for stock volatility, I show that volatility increases after major financial crises. Moreover. stock volatility decreases and stock prices rise before the Fed increases margin requirements. Thus, {{there is little reason}} to believe that public policies can control stock volatility. The evidence supports the observation by Black [1976] <b>that</b> <b>stock</b> volatility increases after stock prices fall. ...|$|R
40|$|Do well-functioning {{stock markets}} and banks promote long-run {{economic}} growth? This paper shows <b>that</b> <b>stock</b> market liquidity and banking development both positively predict growth, capital accumulation, and productivity improvements when entered together in regressions, even {{after controlling for}} economic and political factors. The {{results are consistent with}} the views that financial markets provide important services for growth and <b>that</b> <b>stock</b> markets provide different services from banks. The paper also finds <b>that</b> <b>stock</b> market size, volatility, and international integration are not robustly linked with growth and that none of the financial indicators is closely associated with private saving rates.

40|$|Understanding {{the causal}} {{relationship}} between financial development {{and economic growth}} is important in enhancing the economy of a nation. Using the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) bounds test approach, this study finds <b>that</b> <b>stock</b> market development is cointegrated with {{economic growth in the}} context of Malaysia. Moreover, this test also suggests <b>that</b> <b>stock</b> market development has a significant positive long-run impact on economic growth. Granger-causality test based on vector error correction model (VECM) further reveals <b>that</b> <b>stock</b> market development Granger-causes economic growth. Hence, this study provides robust empirical evidence in favor of finance-led growth hypothesis for the Malaysian economy.

25|$|The EMH was {{developed}} by Professor Eugene Fama who argued <b>that</b> <b>stocks</b> always trade at their fair value, {{making it impossible for}} investors to either purchase undervalued stocks or sell stocks for inflated prices. As such, it should be impossible to outperform the overall market through expert stock selection or market timing, and that the only way an investor can possibly obtain higher returns is by chance or by purchasing riskier investments. His 2012 study with Kenneth French confirmed this view, showing that the distribution of abnormal returns of US mutual funds is very similar to what would be expected if no fund managers had any skill—a necessary condition for the EMH to hold.|$|E
25|$|In 1952, Buffett married Susan Thompson at Dundee Presbyterian Church. The {{next year}} {{they had their}} first child, Susan Alice. In 1954, Buffett {{accepted}} a job at Benjamin Graham's partnership. His starting salary was $12,000 a year (about $ today). There he worked closely with Walter Schloss. Graham was a tough boss. He was adamant <b>that</b> <b>stocks</b> provide a wide margin of safety after weighing the trade-off between their price and their intrinsic value. The argument made sense to Buffett but he questioned whether the criteria were too stringent and caused the company {{to miss out on}} big winners that had other appealing features. That same year the Buffetts had their second child, Howard Graham. In 1956, Benjamin Graham retired and closed his partnership. At this time Buffett's personal savings were over $174,000 (about $ million today) and he started Buffett Partnership Ltd.|$|E
25|$|Though {{real estate}} is still his most {{preferred}} asset class, Trump became an active financial market investor in 2011 following disappointment from depressed American real estate market and various investments in the Federal Reserve's interest yields on CDs were next to nothing. Trump stated {{that he was not}} enthusiastic to be a stock market investor, but that prime real estate at good prices was hard to find at that time and <b>that</b> <b>stocks</b> and equity securities were cheap and generating good cash flow from dividends. He profited from 40 of the 45 stocks he purchased which he sold in 2014, making it almost a 90% success rate in capital appreciation in addition to millions in earned dividends. The biggest gainers in his stock portfolio were Bank of America Corporation, The Boeing Company and Facebook, Inc earning a windfall profit of $6.7 million, $3.96 million and $3.85 million, respectively.|$|E
40|$|Since risk {{plays a role}} {{in setting}} {{dividend}} policy and granting stock options to directors, the paper investigates the effect of director compensation structure on the riskiness of the firm’s investment strategy by examining the firm’s dividend payout policy. The results imply <b>that</b> <b>stock</b> options to outside directors increase the firm’s appetite for risk and suggest <b>that</b> director <b>stock</b> options constitute a major incentive to changing corporate policies. The results also indicate <b>that</b> director <b>stock</b> options align the risk preferences of managers and directors.

60|$|If a man {{had stood}} on London Bridge, calling till he was hoarse, upon the passers-by, to join with Lord George Gordon, {{although}} for an object which no man understood, and which in that very incident had a charm of its own,--the probability is, {{that he might have}} influenced a score of people in a month. If all zealous Protestants had been publicly urged to join an association for the avowed purpose of singing a hymn or two occasionally, and hearing some indifferent speeches made, and ultimately of petitioning Parliament not to pass an act for abolishing the penal laws against Roman Catholic priests, the penalty of perpetual imprisonment denounced against those who educated children in that persuasion, and the disqualification of all members of the Romish church to inherit real property in the United Kingdom by right of purchase or descent,--matters so far removed from the business and bosoms of the mass, might perhaps have called together a hundred people. But when vague rumours got abroad, that in this Protestant association a secret power was mustering against the government for undefined and mighty purposes; when the air was filled with whispers of a confederacy among the Popish powers to degrade and enslave England, establish an inquisition in London, and turn the pens of Smithfield market into stakes and cauldrons; when terrors and alarms which no man understood were perpetually broached, {{both in and out of}} Parliament, by one enthusiast who did not understand himself, and bygone bugbears which had lain quietly in their graves for centuries, were raised again to haunt the ignorant and credulous; when all this was done, as it were, in the dark, and secret invitations to join the Great Protestant Association in defence of religion, life, and liberty, were dropped in the public ways, thrust under the house-doors, tossed in at windows, and pressed into the hands of those who trod the streets by night; when they glared from every wall, and shone on every post and pillar, so <b>that</b> <b>stocks</b> and stones appeared infected with the common fear, urging all men to join together blindfold in resistance of they knew not what, they knew not why;--then the mania spread indeed, and the body, still increasing every day, grew forty thousand strong.|$|E
