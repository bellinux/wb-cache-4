40|$|The paper {{sheds light}} on the undiscovered effects of {{twinning}} instrument. It explores whether the candidate countries are but mere ‘importers’ of Europeanization {{in the framework of}} institutional twinning and what the object of importation really is. The paper is based on two main assumptions: implementation of twinning projects enables imposed transposition of the EU acquis and it opens space for additional voluntary transfer of member states’ laws and institutions into candidate country’s legal and administrative system. It may be concluded that voluntary transposition of sophisticated objects, such as administrative procedures and methodologies, managerial styles and strategies and ‘ways of doing things’, is the most common result of horizontal <b>twinning</b> <b>cooperation.</b> Practice, though, reveals that the principle of administrative cooperation between twinning partners is misbalanced, which disturbsthe triangular administrative model. ‘Twinners’ focus more on transposition of institutional ‘non-acquis’ based on diverse domestic administrative solutions than on the transfer of legal obligations stipulated in the EU Directive...|$|E
40|$|This PhD {{dissertation}} {{seeks to}} deepen the current {{understanding of the}} European Union’s (EU) transgovernmental (TG) cooperation with its Eastern neighbours under the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP). Scholars of Europeanization and EU external governance have already pointed out the potential of EU TG cooperation to advance EU democracy promotion goals and regulatory standards to the ENP countries under the absence of EU membership perspective. The major instrument of such cooperation is Twinning, which fosters peer-to-peer, cross-border networks between civil servants and experts from EU member states (MS) and their ENP counterparts. Nevertheless, the existing literature overlooks several important aspects of EU TG cooperation, which pertain to the democratic substance, the role of MS, {{and the effectiveness of}} Twinning projects under the ENP. By drawing on interdisciplinary scholarship from EU studies and public administration, this dissertation addresses those gaps in four thematic articles. The first article provides the context for this study by presenting TG cooperation as a promising but little studied instrument, which may help the EU advance its democracy promotion agenda under the ENP. The second article introduces the concept of democratic governance substance and explores the presence and variation of democratic governance norms in Twinning projects in the Eastern neighbourhood. The third article discusses the added value that Central and Eastern European countries (CEECs) and the older MS bring for <b>Twinning</b> <b>cooperation</b> in Azerbaijan and Ukraine. The fourth and last article explores to what extent Twinning projects in Ukraine have been effective and what conditions explain their (in) effectiveness. The overall geographical focus of this work are the countries of the EU’s Eastern neighbourhood, which are covered by the ENP framework. In such a way, this dissertation proposes a new concept of democratic governance substance, conceptualises the comparative advantages of EU MS for <b>Twinning</b> <b>cooperation,</b> and suggests an original way of understanding the effectiveness of Twinning projects. In contrast to the predominantly qualitative studies of EU TG cooperation under the ENP, it also seeks to make a methodological contribution by embracing mixed-method approaches to data analysis. Finally, it provides policy-relevant recommendations regarding Twinning implementation in the future. In doing so, it relies on an original analysis of 45 semi-structured interviews, conducted with Twinning participants and experts from the Eastern neighbourhood countries, EU member states, and the European Commission between November 2014 and May 2016. Additionally, it uses a wealth of supplementary data from official Twinning documents, sectoral watchdogs, international organizations, government sources in the EU and the Eastern neighbourhood, and existing policy research. The findings reveal that, through its Twinning projects in the Eastern neighbourhood, the EU promotes democratic governance substance, which varies by configuration and magnitude across policy sectors and countries. This variation is best explained by domestic variables, such as the country’s political liberalisation, sector politicization, and sector technical complexity. In addition, the dissertation demonstrates that, during <b>Twinning</b> <b>cooperation,</b> CEECs manifest mostly country-specific comparative advantages, such as their recent transition and accession experience, socio-linguistic proximity, and shared historical legacies with the Eastern neighbourhood countries. In contrast, the older MS typically offer sector-specific comparative advantages, owing to their institutional experience, sectoral fit, existing sectoral networks with the Eastern neighbourhood countries, and prior Twinning participation. Both types of comparative advantages are found to be complementary. Finally, a configurational analysis of the effectiveness of Twinning projects in Ukraine indicates that a policy fit is the only necessary condition behind the legal and institutional convergence of the country with the EU’s policy recommendations. Thereby, institutional convergence occurs in parallel to or exceeds legal convergence in effective Twinning projects. This undermines the mainstream scholarly expectations of the wide gap between EU norm adoption and implementation (application) in EU TG cooperation under the ENP...|$|E
40|$|Same, Same, but Different -a Minor Field Study of the Future Red Cross Women’s Project, Malindi Branch, Kenya. In May 2005, we {{received}} a scholarship from the Swedish International Development Agency, SIDA, to conduct a Minor Field Study about the future women’s project at the Malindi Red Cross branch, Kenya. The branch has since May 2002 {{been involved in a}} <b>Twinning</b> <b>cooperation</b> with the Swedish Red Cross Southeast Region. The aim of this thesis is by using the Logical Framework Approach and the Intersectional perspective, to examine the situation for women in Malindi and the work of the Red Cross branch, in order to propose guidelines for the future Red Cross women’s project. The questions asked were: How can the guidelines for the women’s project be formulated in order for the vision of the Red Cross to be reached? What changes within the individual, societal and political sphere have to be accomplished {{in order to meet the}} needs and interests of different women in Malindi? The work of the Red Cross is in a political science perspective interesting as it through its role of a humanitarian organisation and NGO, plays an important role in the Kenyan civil society, performing activities and providing services that originally should be supplied by the government. We have found that it is not possible to talk about the woman in Malindi, due to the fact that women’s backgrounds, problems, needs and interests are different. Therefore it is of great importance that the Red Cross in order to accomplish its vision, i. e. to reach the most vulnerable, includes a gender and an intersectional approach into its activities and outreaches. There is a desire in Kenya to politicize the gender issue, however the future will show the will to actually implement these laws and reforms needed for the empowerment of the women. Moreover, different gender structures can only be achieved through the questioning of the traditional gender roles from both men and women and in this process we have recognised the Red Cross as an important moulder of public opinion. Finally we also want to suggest an inclusion of the gender- and the intersectional perspective into the method of LFA, since the traditional model is not sufficient in considering the different needs of different people...|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} I focus on characterizing {{international}} system of a sub-region of the Baltic Sea {{area in the}} frames of environmental cooperation. I chose a case study that represents close collaboration and progressiveness. Environmental cooperation between Finland and Russia is rather intensive and it has developed well {{during the last few}} decades. Neighbourhood and good relations among the partners have promoted it as well. The Environmental City Twinning programme consists of sub-projects carried out by Finnish cities and St. Petersburg. Twinning between cities has been beneficial for the cooperation, indeed. Twinning means close collaboration, constant interaction, day-by-day working together and informal contacts. This increases openness in the cooperation and promotes equal partnership. I wanted to choose a possibly unique case for my study. Most likely, there is something in the city twinning programme that is worth of sharing with other actors of Finnish-Russian environmental cooperation and of cooperation on other fields as well. What are the lessons learned of city <b>twinning</b> <b>cooperation,</b> will be clarified in the results of the analysis. Theoretical approach of the English school gives me tools for characterizing the international arena of cooperating cities in Finland and North-West Russia. Those tools are the concepts of: international system, international society (pluralistic and solidarist) and world society. International society is a concept that is most often used by the English school researchers. According to Hedley Bull (one of the beginners of the theory), international society emerges when “a group of states, conscious of certain common interests and common values, forms a society {{in the sense that they}} conceive themselves to be bound by a common set of rules in their relations with one another, and share in the working of common institutions” (Dunne, Kurki and Smith 2007, 134). This thesis is about cooperation; hence, it is already a sign of an international society. In this study, the question is more about thickness or thinness of the society and about what elements of international regional society can be found in the society of cooperating cities. With the help of narrative analysis and the method of the model of actants created by A. J. Greimas, I was able to identify features of an international society within the frames of cooperating cities. The theoretical approach together with the method it was possible to describe the success of the environmental cooperation as well. The case study of environmental city twinning programme is an example of Finnish-Russian cooperation. However, it can be used somewhere else as well, where the similar circumstances can be found. ...|$|E

40|$|Territorial Cooperation (TC) {{has been}} {{possible}} {{because there is}} a trajectory of many years of work invested by the local actors, participants who have become the architects of TC through the city or region involved. Transcontinental cooperation as studied by the European Union TERCO project is providing important lessons for understanding TC. The purpose of the presentation is to analyze the Andalusian-North of Morocco territorial cooperation during the last twenty years. <b>Twinning</b> cities, bilateral <b>cooperation</b> agreements and networks have structured participation in projects with varying degrees of impact on the economic, social, urban and environmental conditions. The initiatives have always been local and with a bottom-up approach. The management capacity of key organizations working in a descentralized way and their background on local development governance have made available the implementation of local iniciatives. The projects with the best results are those that are carried out jointly and adapt to Moroccan needs in agreement with its territorial development strategy which was previously defined. Special institutional and cultural mechanisms of developing in both sides of Mediterranean Sea were very helpful. The institutional weaknesses and the complexity of decision-making mechanism in Andalusia and Morocco can make relations difficult and therefore territorial cooperation weak. Territorial Cooperation needs to be flexible enough to respond to changes in the socio-economic environment. The case study of Andalusia-North of Morocco shows that local economic development (e. g. technological innovation or international trade) are important. These issues are usually approached through public-private coordination organizations, such as development agencies. As shown by some other case studies of the TERCO project the results of the participation of such agencies are still modest. Special attention should be given to TC with Morocco due to geo-strategic relations both with Spain and Europe. Not only are there sporadic problems of a bilateral strategic nature between Spain (EU) and Morocco at the Central Government level which can affect decentralized TC, but also, problems with illegal migration (an EU concern), and difficulties in acquiring visas to travel for the cooperating agents, could very well jeopardize TC initiatives...|$|R
