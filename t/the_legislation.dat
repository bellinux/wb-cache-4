5|$|By 1962, Congress {{had passed}} {{legislation}} to deny financial aid grants to Yugoslavia, {{to withdraw the}} sale of spare parts for Yugoslav warplanes, and to revoke the country's most favored nation status.

President Kennedy endorsed Kennan privately but remained noncommittal publicly, as {{he did not want to}} jeopardize his slim majority support in Congress on a potentially contentious issue.

5|$|Ginsburg {{was in the}} {{minority}} for Gonzales v. Carhart, , a 5–4 decision upholding restrictions on partial birth abortion. In her dissent, Ginsburg opposed the majority's decision to defer to legislative findings that the procedure was not safe for women. Ginsburg focused her ire on the way Congress reached its findings and with the veracity of the findings. Joining the majority for Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt, , a case which struck down parts of a 2013 Texas law regulating abortion providers, Ginsburg also authored a short concurring opinion which was even more critical of <b>the</b> <b>legislation</b> at issue. She asserted <b>the</b> <b>legislation</b> was not aimed at protecting women's health, as Texas had claimed, but rather to impede women's access to abortions.|$|E
