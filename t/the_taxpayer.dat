5|$|Carucage was {{a medieval}} English land tax {{introduced}} by King Richard I in 1194, {{based on the}} size—variously calculated—of the estate owned by <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer.</b> It was a replacement for the danegeld, last imposed in 1162, which had become difficult to collect because of {{an increasing number of}} exemptions. Carucage was levied just six times: by Richard in 1194 and 1198; John, his brother and successor, in 1200; and John's son, Henry III, in 1217, 1220, and 1224, after which it was replaced by taxes on income and personal property.|$|E
50|$|First {{approved}} by the Eighth Circuit in 1935 in Gleckman v. United States, the bank deposit cash expenditure method identifies tax evasion through review of <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer’s</b> bank deposits. This method of investigation primarily focuses on whether <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer’s</b> total bank deposits throughout the year are equal to <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer’s</b> reported income. This method is most appropriate when the majority of <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer’s</b> income is deposited in the bank and most expenses are paid by check.|$|R
50|$|The {{snapshot}} includes <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer’s</b> cash on hand, bank accounts, brokerage (stocks and bonds), house, cars, beach house, jewelry, furs, {{and other}} similar items. Generally the IRS learns about these items through very thorough and in-depth investigations, sometimes casing <b>the</b> suspected fraudulent <b>taxpayer.</b> In addition, <b>the</b> IRS also assesses <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer’s</b> liabilities. Liabilities include expenses such as <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer’s</b> mortgage, car loans, credit card debts, student loans, and personal loans. The opening net worth is the most critical {{point at which the}} IRS must assess <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer's</b> assets and liabilities. Otherwise, the net worth comparison will be inaccurate.|$|R

The Commissioner of Internal Revenue determined that deductions for travel, meals, and lodging were not deductible under 26 U.S.C.S. § 62, and that <b>the</b> <b>taxpayers</b> owed taxes on the fair {{market value of the}} car and belt under 26 U.S.C.S. § 74.|$|R
5|$|In 1997, President Clinton {{signed into}} effect <b>the</b> <b>Taxpayer</b> Relief Act of 1997, which {{included}} the largest {{capital gains tax cut}} in U.S. history. Under the act, the profits on the sale of a personal residence ($500,000 for married couples, $250,000 for singles) were exempted if lived in for at least 2 years over the last 5. (This had previously been limited to a $125,000 once-in-a-lifetime exemption for those over the age of 55.) There were also reductions {{in a number of other}} taxes on investment gains.|$|E
5|$|This {{language}} is not from the Court’s opinion in Lucas v. Earl. Instead, it is an almost direct quotation from page 17 of the taxpayer's brief filed in the case. Guy C. Earl was <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer,</b> and the brief was written by Earl’s attorneys: Warren Olney Jr., J.M. Mannon, Jr., and Henry D. Costigan. In some printed versions of the case, this statement and other quotations and paraphrases from pages 8, 10, 14, 15, 17, and 18 of the taxpayer's brief are re-printed as a headnote or syllabus above {{the opinion of the}} Court. In the case reprints that include this headnote (and many of them do not even show it), these excerpts are not clearly identified as being from the taxpayer's brief. A person not trained in analysis of legal materials would not necessarily know that this verbiage, like any headnote or syllabus, {{is not part of the}} Court’s opinion, perhaps leading to the confusion about the source of the quotation. As explained below, the Supreme Court rejected the arguments in the quotation, and <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer</b> lost the case.|$|E
5|$|The {{taxable value}} of an estate was {{initially}} assessed from the Domesday Survey, but other methods were later employed, such as valuations based on the sworn testimony of neighbours or {{on the number of}} plough-teams <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer</b> used. Carucage never raised as much as other taxes, but nevertheless helped to fund several projects. It paid the ransom for Richard's release in 1194, after he was taken prisoner by Leopold V, Duke of Austria; it covered the tax John had to pay Philip II of France in 1200 on land he inherited in that country; and it helped to finance Henry III's military campaigns in England and on continental Europe.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>taxpayer's</b> {{basis in}} <b>the</b> new {{property}} {{is determined by}} starting with <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer’s</b> basis in <b>the</b> old property exchanged.

By using <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer’s</b> basis in <b>the</b> old property as the reference point for the new property’s basis, unrecognized gain or loss is preserved.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>taxpayers,</b> {{husband and}} wife, made an {{irrevocable}} election {{to file a}} joint federal income tax return rather than separate returns {{on the advice of}} their return preparer. Subsequently, the Service examined the return and assessed a deficiency against <b>the</b> <b>taxpayers.</b> <b>The</b> deficiency existed because the return preparer took a larger deduction from income for capital losses than was allowed by law. If <b>the</b> <b>taxpayers</b> had filed separate returns employing the proper deduction for long-term capital losses, their combined tax liability would have been $19,941.10 less than the amount they paid on their joint return. As recompense for his error, the return preparer indemnified <b>the</b> <b>taxpayers</b> in that amount.|$|R

5|$|With {{investment}} subsidies, {{the financial}} burden falls upon <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer,</b> while with feed-in tariffs the extra cost is distributed across the utilities' customer bases. While the investment subsidy may be simpler to administer, the main argument in favour of feed-in tariffs is the encouragement of quality. Investment subsidies are paid out {{as a function of}} the nameplate capacity of the installed system and are independent of its actual power yield over time, thus rewarding the overstatement of power and tolerating poor durability and maintenance. Some electric companies offer rebates to their customers, such as Austin Energy in Texas, which offers $2.50/watt installed up to $15,000.|$|E
5|$|English {{taxation}} {{after the}} Norman Conquest of 1066 {{was based on}} the geld or danegeld, a national tax paid by all free men, those who were not serfs or slaves. The geld {{was based on the}} number of hides of land owned by <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer,</b> and could be demanded by the king and assessed at varying levels without the need for consultation with the barons or other subjects. During King Henry I's reign, an increasing number of exemptions, and the difficulties encountered in collecting the geld, lowered its importance to the Exchequer—the treasury of England. It is unclear whether the geld was collected at all during the reign of Henry's successor, King Stephen. Stephen's successor, King Henry II, collected the geld only twice, once in 1155 and again in 1161–1162. The geld was unpopular, and after 1162 Henry may have felt it politically expedient to stop collecting it.|$|E
25|$|In the Flora case <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer</b> did not contend, and {{the court}} did not rule, that there was no legal {{obligation}} to file Federal income tax returns or pay the related taxes. The Court's ruling in Flora was almost the opposite: <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer</b> was required to pay the full amount of tax claimed by the IRS to be owed by <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer</b> before the court would even hear a lawsuit by <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer</b> against the government to determine the correct amount of tax.|$|E

50|$|The IRS then evaluates new {{debts and}} {{liabilities}} accumulated {{in the next}} year, and assesses <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer’s</b> new net worth at the next year’s end. In addition, the IRS reviews <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer’s</b> cash expenditures throughout the tax year.

5000|$|The R&D Tax Credit {{allows for}} three {{calculation}} methods based on <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer's</b> date of incorporation, initiation of qualified research, {{and ability to}} collect required contemporaneous documentation.

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>taxpayer</b> Robert L. Schulz filed motions in {{a federal}} court to quash {{administrative}} summonses issued by the IRS seeking testimony and documents in connection with an IRS investigation. The court in Schulz did not rule that a taxpayer {{has a right to}} have the IRS explain why he or she is subject to taxation, and that issue was not presented to the court. The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the dismissal of the taxpayer's motions for a lack of subject matter jurisdiction because there was no actual case or controversy as required by Article III of the Constitution. The court reasoned that the summonses posed no threat of injury to <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer,</b> as the IRS had not yet initiated enforcement proceedings against him. In other words, <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer</b> was not entitled to a court order to quash the summonses until the IRS went to court to demand that he comply with the summons or otherwise face sanctions—something the IRS had not yet done. Once the IRS took that action, <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer</b> would then have ample opportunity to challenge the validity of the summonses.|$|E
