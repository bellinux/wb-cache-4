5|$|Takalik Abaj is {{representative}} of the first blossoming of Maya culture <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>occurred</b> by about 400 BC. The site includes a Maya royal tomb and examples of Maya hieroglyphic inscriptions that are among the earliest from the Maya region. Excavation is continuing at the site; the monumental architecture and persistent tradition of sculpture in a variety of styles suggest the site was of some importance.|$|E

5|$|At Edinburgh University, Childe {{focused on}} research, and {{although}} reportedly very kind towards his students, had difficulty speaking to large audiences; he organised the BSc degree course {{so that it}} began studying the Iron Age, progressing chronologically backward to the Palaeolithic, confusing many students. Founding the Edinburgh League of Prehistorians, he took his more enthusiastic students on excavations and invited guest lecturers to visit. Involving them in experimental archaeology, {{of which he was}} an early proponent, in 1937 he performed experiments to understand the vitrification process <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>occurred</b> at several Iron Age forts in northern Britain.|$|E

5|$|Bhopal: A Prayer for Rain is a 2014 {{historical}} drama film set {{amidst the}} Bhopal disaster <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>occurred</b> in India on 2–3 December 1984. It {{is directed by}} Ravi Kumar and features Martin Sheen, Mischa Barton, Kal Penn, Rajpal Yadav, Tannishtha Chatterjee, and Fagun Thakrar in important roles. Benjamin Wallfisch composed the film's music. Kumar got {{the idea of making}} a film based on the Bhopal disaster after he read a book based on it. Shot over a period of 18 months, it was originally slated for a late 2010 release. However, the lack of responses from distributors kept on delaying the release.|$|E
5|$|IVThe {{painting}} was rehung {{as a result}} of the revival of Napoleon's reputation, and a fresh interest into his exploits. However, before this, in 1815, the year Napoleon was exiled, Napoleonic-themed art was proscribed for artists and painters, as he was not well liked because of events <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>occurred</b> in the few years immediately preceding 1815, and Napoleon's exile. It was only truly by the 1830s that artwork related to the emperor was being created once more. As such, after being removed from the walls of the Louvre around 1815, David's version had been re-hung by the time Delaroche observed it.|$|E

5|$|The revolt in Palestine was {{markedly}} {{different from the}} revolts that sprung up elsewhere in the Egyptian-ruled Levant, such as the 1838 Druze revolt and those {{that occurred in the}} Nusayriyya Mountains and Mount Lebanon. Unlike the other Levantine revolts, the participants were not an ethnoreligiously or socially homogeneous group, but rather an assortment of societal groups from different classes, subcultures, geographical areas and religions. This also significantly distinguished it from previous popular uprisings against Ottoman rule <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>occurred</b> in Jerusalem and its vicinity, namely the Naqib al-Ashraf Revolt in 1703–1705 and the revolt of 1825–1826, which failed to attract support from the people of Nablus, Hebron, Galilee and Gaza.|$|E

The World Wrestling Federation recognized Moolah as the reigning champion but did not recognize any of the title changes <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>occurred</b> since Moolah was first awarded the title. The NWA continued the title without Moolah after her title was renamed the WWF Women's Championship.|$|E
5|$|In 1705, Edmond Halley (1656–1742) applied Newton's {{method to}} twenty-three cometary apparitions <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>occurred</b> between 1337 and 1698. He noted {{that three of}} these, the comets of 1531, 1607, and 1682, had very similar orbital elements, and he was further able {{to account for the}} slight {{differences}} in their orbits in terms of gravitational perturbation caused by Jupiter and Saturn. Confident that these three apparitions had been three appearances of the same comet, he predicted that it would appear again in 1758–9. Halley's predicted return date was later refined by a team of three French mathematicians: Alexis Clairaut, Joseph Lalande, and Nicole-Reine Lepaute, who predicted the date of the comet's 1759 perihelion to within one month's accuracy. When the comet returned as predicted, it became known as Halley's Comet (with the latter-day designation of 1P/Halley). It will next appear in 2061.|$|E

5|$|Operation Heiderose was a {{significant}} success for the division, inflicting serious losses on the Partisans. More than 900 Partisans were killed and {{a large amount of}} equipment was captured: one anti-tank gun, two mortars, 22 machine guns, over 800 rifles and nearly 500,000 rounds of small arms ammunition. The division suffered 24 killed and over 150 wounded. Communist sources hold that the Partisans suffered serious losses, with the 12th Corps alone having 250 dead, wounded and missing. However, Partisan reports estimate that German losses were significantly larger than their own. Erich Braun was recommended for the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross but the recommendation was not supported, apparently due to disagreements between the divisional staff and Phleps <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>occurred</b> during the division's formation.|$|E
5|$|The AFL–CIO's {{autonomous}} {{support of}} Solidarity {{was so successful}} that by 1984 both Democrats and Republicans agreed that it deserved public support. The AFL–CIO's example of open support was deemed to be appropriate for a democracy, and much more suitable than the clandestine funding through the CIA <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>occurred</b> before 1970. Both parties and President Ronald Reagan supported a non-governmental organization, National Endowment for Democracy (NED), through which Congress would openly fund Solidarity through an allocation in the State Department's budget, beginning in 1984. The NED was designed with four core institutions, associated with {{the two major parties}} and with the AFL-CIO and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce (representing business). The NED's first president was Carl Gershman, a former Director of Social Democrats, USA and former U.S. Representative to the United Nations committee on human rights. From 1984 until 1990, the NED and the AFL–CIO channeled equipment and support worth $4million to Solidarity.|$|E
5|$|The {{bottlenose}} dolphin can behave aggressively. Males fight for rank {{and access to}} females. During mating season, males compete vigorously with each other through displays of toughness and size, {{with a series of}} acts, such as head-butting. They display aggression towards sharks and smaller dolphin species. At least one population, off Scotland, has practiced infanticide, and also has attacked and killed harbour porpoises. University of Aberdeen researchers say the dolphins do not eat their victims, but are simply competing for food. However, Dr. Read of Duke University, a porpoise expert researching similar cases of porpoise killings <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>occurred</b> in Virginia in 1996 and 1997, holds a different view. He states dolphins and porpoises feed on different types of fish, thus food competition is an unlikely cause of the killings. Similar behaviour has been observed in Ireland. In the first half of July, 2014, four attacks with three Porpoise fatalities were observed and caught on video by the Cardigan Bay Marine Wildlife Centre in the Cardigan Bay.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} Chinese {{plan called}} for the 58th Division to attack Hagaru-ri {{on the night of}} 27 November, but the division became lost in the countryside due to the outdated Japanese maps it used. It was not until the dawn of 28 November that the 58th Division arrived at Hagaru-ri. Meanwhile, from the fighting and ambushes <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>occurred</b> the previous night, the garrison at Hagaru-ri noticed the Chinese forces around them. Lieutenant Colonel Thomas L. Ridge, commander of 3rd Battalion, 1st Marines (3/1), predicted the Chinese attack would come on the night of 28 November. Almost everyone, including rear support units with little combat training, was pressed into the front line due to the manpower shortage, and the entire perimeter was on full alert by 21:30.|$|E
5|$|The {{park was}} {{originally}} designed by Joseph Forsyth Johnson {{to host the}} first of two major expositions held in the park in the late 19th century. The Piedmont Exposition opened in October 1887 to great fanfare. The event was a success and {{set the stage for the}} Cotton States and International Exposition which was held in the park seven years later in 1895. Both exhibitions showcased the prosperity of the region <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>occurred</b> during and after the Reconstruction period. In the early 20th century, a redesign plan called the Olmsted plan, was begun by the sons of New York Central Park architect, Frederick Law Olmsted. The effort led to the addition of scenic paths in the park and the joining of the park with the Ansley park system.|$|E

Most of the money, jewelry and uncensored letters {{that they were}} carrying were impounded. The two were flown out of Bari on 30 May, and landed on an airfield at Pranjani northwest of Čačak shortly after. Because their landing at Pranjani coincided with Armstrong's departure, Baćović and Lukačević demanded that Armstrong be held as a hostage until their impounded belongings could be returned from Bari. The Chetnik personnel at the airfield refused to keep Armstrong any further, and {{he was allowed to}} depart without incident.|$|E

5|$|A seminar {{was held}} in 2011 to design the show's {{curriculum}} and educational framework, and was attended by over 80 education and media experts. The seminar, also attended by ABEGS representatives, {{was sponsored by the}} GCC Joint Program Production Institution (GCC-JPPI) and Saudi Basic Industries Corporation (SABIC), a manufacturing company based in Riyadh and one of the private corporations that sponsored the new show. The participants took into consideration the educational changes <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>occurred</b> in the region in the previous 20 years, including a more diverse and complicated world and a need for more creativity to educate young children. The seminar focused on the education needs of children throughout the Arab world, the possible effects of the show's return, and how to provide educational resources and technology to children in the 21st century. The seminar participants recommended the creation of an advisory council, consisting of education experts and media professionals, as well as expanding to new media forms other than TV, and including important Arab celebrities as guests on the show, all components that the American show used.|$|E
5|$|Charig et al. {{pointed to}} the {{presence}} of hairline cracks in the slabs running through both rock and fossil impressions, and mineral growth over the slabs <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>occurred</b> before discovery and preparation, as evidence that the feathers were original. Spetner et al. then attempted to show that the cracks would have propagated naturally through their postulated cement layer, but neglected to account {{for the fact that the}} cracks were old and had been filled with calcite, and thus were not able to propagate. They also attempted to show the presence of cement on the London specimen through X-ray spectroscopy, and did find something that was not rock; it was not cement either, and is most probably a fragment of silicone rubber left behind when moulds were made of the specimen. Their suggestions have not been taken seriously by palaeontologists, as their evidence was largely based on misunderstandings of geology, and they never discussed the other feather-bearing specimens, which have increased in number since then. Charig et al. reported a discolouration: a dark band between two layers of limestone – they say it is the product of sedimentation. It is natural for limestone to take on the colour of its surroundings and most limestones are coloured (if not colour banded) to some degree, so the darkness was attributed to such impurities. They also mention that a complete absence of air bubbles in the rock slabs is further proof that the specimen is authentic.|$|E
5|$|Gil met guitarist {{and singer}} Caetano Veloso at the Universidade Federal da Bahia (Federal University of Bahia) in 1963. The two {{immediately}} began collaborating and performing together, releasing a single and EP soon afterwards. Along with Maria Bethânia (Veloso's sister), Gal Costa, and Tom Zé, Gil and Veloso performed bossa nova and traditional Brazilian songs at the Vila Velha Theatre's opening night in July 1964, a show entitled Nós, por Exemplo (Us, for Example). Gil {{and the group}} continued to perform at the venue and he eventually became a musical director of the concert series. Gil collaborated again with members of this collective on the landmark 1968 album , whose style was influenced by The Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, an album Gil listened to constantly. Gil describes Tropicália: ou Panis et Circenses as {{the birth of the}} tropicália movement. As Gil describes it, tropicália (or Tropicalismo) was a conflation of musical and cultural developments <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>occurred</b> in Brazil during the 1950s and 1960s—primarily bossa nova and the Jovem Guarda (Young Wave) collective—with rock and roll music from the United States and Europe, a movement deemed threatening by the Brazilian government of the time.|$|E
