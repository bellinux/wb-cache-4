5|$|Attention will {{be focused}} on the {{direction}} of the blood flow in both of the venous systems, and in the perforator veins, as well as being focused on shunt detection. A shunting of blood from <b>the</b> <b>thigh</b> veins back into the lower leg veins will give a reflux situation. The veins most often found to be incompetent are the saphenous veins and the perforators communicating with the deep veins of <b>the</b> <b>thigh.</b>|$|E
5|$|In March 1916, Phillipps was {{deployed}} to France with the 28th Battalion for {{service on the}} Western Front. He participated in a raid against the forts of Armentières {{on the night of}} 6/7June, and saw action during the Battle of Pozières in July. On 5August, he was shot through <b>the</b> <b>thigh,</b> requiring evacuation to England for hospital treatment. He was promoted to captain on 12August. Phillipps rejoined his unit in October but suffered another gunshot wound to <b>the</b> <b>thigh</b> the following month, near Gueudecourt. He returned to England once more to recover, and remained in hospital until 2March 1917.|$|E
5|$|Pterosaurs' hip sockets are {{oriented}} facing slightly upwards, and {{the head}} of the femur (thigh bone) is only moderately inward facing, suggesting that pterosaurs had an erect stance.

5|$|The {{discovery}} of a juvenile specimen with a nearly complete hindlimb shows that the legs were relatively longer in juveniles, and the lower segments of the leg (shin and foot) were relatively longer than <b>the</b> <b>thigh.</b> These differences suggest that younger Allosaurus were faster and had different hunting strategies than adults, perhaps chasing small prey as juveniles, then becoming ambush hunters of large prey upon adulthood. <b>The</b> <b>thigh</b> bone became thicker and wider during growth, and the cross-section less circular, as muscle attachments shifted, muscles became shorter, {{and the growth of}} the leg slowed. These changes imply that juvenile legs has less predictable stresses compared with adults, which would have moved with more regular forward progression. Conversely, the skull bones appear to have generally grown isometrically, increasing in size without changing in proportion.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating from}} the United States Military Academy at West Point, Longstreet served in the Mexican–American War. He was wounded in <b>the</b> <b>thigh</b> at the Battle of Chapultepec, and {{afterward}} married his first wife, Louise Garland. Throughout the 1850s, he served on frontier duty in the American Southwest. In June 1861, Longstreet resigned his U.S. Army commission and joined the Confederate Army. He commanded Confederate troops during an early victory at Blackburn's Ford in July.|$|E

5|$|After {{her parents}} {{divorced}} {{when she was}} approximately four years old, Laurer had three different stepfathers and one stepmother. According to Laurer, her first stepfather threatened suicide at one point, and her biological father, who once accidentally stabbed her mother in <b>the</b> <b>thigh</b> with a bread knife, {{had a problem with}} alcoholism. From 1973 to 1983, she, her siblings and her mother moved several times.|$|E
5|$|He {{adopted a}} plan to capture a hill where republican guns could {{dominate}} the city's harbour and force the British to evacuate. The assault on the position led to the capture of the city, but during it Bonaparte was wounded in <b>the</b> <b>thigh.</b> He was promoted to brigadier general {{at the age of}} 24. Catching the attention of the Committee of Public Safety, he was put in charge of the artillery of France's Army of Italy.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the six dead, thirteen other people were wounded by gunshot in the attack, while a fourteenth person was injured subduing Loughner.

5|$|Inverse {{psoriasis}} (also {{known as}} flexural psoriasis) appears as smooth, inflamed patches of skin. The patches frequently affect skin folds, particularly around the genitals (between <b>the</b> <b>thigh</b> and groin), the armpits, {{in the skin}} folds of an overweight abdomen (known as panniculus), between the buttocks in the intergluteal cleft, and under the breasts in the inframammary fold. Heat, trauma, and infection are thought {{to play a role}} in the development of this atypical form of psoriasis.|$|E
5|$|The {{battalion}} {{was involved}} in defending against Turkish attacks on Walker's Ridge on 27 April. Hart was wounded in <b>the</b> <b>thigh</b> while supervising the establishment of defensive positions. His wounds necessitated his evacuation to Alexandria the following day. He was later awarded a Distinguished Service Order for his leadership of the battalion during this action.|$|E
5|$|The small {{saphenous vein}} (SSV), {{runs along the}} {{posterior}} aspect of the leg {{as far as the}} popliteal region, in the upper calf. Here it enters the popliteal space which is located between the two heads of the gastrocnemius muscle where it usually drains above the knee joint in the popliteal vein or a little less often in the great saphenous vein (GSV) or other deep muscular veins of <b>the</b> <b>thigh.</b> The use of ultrasonography has allowed a number of variations to be shown at this level; when no contact is made with the popliteal vein it might be seen to drain in the GSV, at a variable level; or, it may merge with the Giacomini vein and drain in the GSV at the superior 1/3 of <b>the</b> <b>thigh.</b> It can also but rarely, drain in the vein of the semimembranosus (thigh muscle) (shown below). Usually though, it connects with a perforator vein at its middle 1/3. To check for insufficiency, the Paraná maneuver is very useful.|$|E

Morgan was struck in the right side. The bullet shattered his spine, passed through his left side, and lodged in <b>the</b> <b>thigh</b> of George A. B. Berry. Another round narrowly missed Wyatt. A doctor was summoned and Morgan was moved from the floor to a nearby couch. The assassins escaped {{in the dark and}} Morgan died 40 minutes later.|$|E
5|$|Emus are farmed {{primarily}} for their meat, leather, feathers and oil, and 95% of the carcass can be used. Emu meat is a low-fat product (less than 1.5% fat), and {{is comparable to}} other lean meats. Most of the usable portions (the best cuts come from <b>the</b> <b>thigh</b> and the larger muscles of the drum or lower leg) are, like other poultry, dark meat; emu meat is considered for cooking purposes by the US Food and Drug Administration to be a red meat because its red colour and pH value approximate that of beef, but for inspection purposes it {{is considered to be}} poultry.|$|E

5|$|Governor Johnson, {{despite his}} {{presumptive}} official position, his age (50), and a crippled arm, volunteered to serve under General John C. Breckinridge and Colonel Robert P.

Johnson was recognized and helped by acquaintance and fellow Freemason, Alexander McDowell McCook, a Union general. However, Johnson died aboard the Union hospital ship Hannibal, and the provisional government of Kentucky was left leaderless.|$|E
5|$|In late November 1916, the 34th Battalion {{was shipped}} to France for {{service on the}} Western Front. Initially posted to the Armentières sector in Belgium, the {{battalion}} {{did not participate in}} its first major battle until June 1917, when it took part in the Battle of Messines after the British and Dominion operations switched to the Ypres sector of Belgium. During the engagement, Jeffries received a bullet wound to <b>the</b> <b>thigh</b> while leading a reconnaissance patrol and was evacuated to the 3rdGeneral Hospital in London. While recuperating, he was promoted to captain on 26 June, before rejoining his battalion in September as a company commander.|$|E
5|$|Legg–Calvé–Perthes syndrome, {{also called}} Avascular Necrosis of the Femoral Head, {{is where the}} ball section of the femur in the hip joint deteriorates {{following}} interruption of the blood flow and is the same condition as in humans.
