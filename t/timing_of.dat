5|$|Although {{the species}} is widely {{regarded}} as sexually monomorphic, males have been suggested to grow more quickly, and in some naturally occurring strains, males are noted to possess dark blotches on the base of their dorsal fins. The species reaches sexual maturity around one year of age, and continues to reproduce for 9–10 years. Frequency and <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> spawning {{may be related to the}} occurrence of rain. A. ocellatus fish are biparental substrate spawners, though detailed information regarding their reproduction in the wild is scarce.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — To {{increase}} the usability {{of a public}} transport system it needs to go under revolutionary changes in its operating procedure. It {{is an attempt to}} make this possible using recent computer technology, mobile computing advancements and Wi-Fi or GPRS. The Intelligent Public Transport Information System will be specifically developed for Bus Transport. In this System passenger can get information about all buses, routes, <b>timings</b> <b>of</b> buses and all stops in any particular route. This system includes two phases. One is for user and other for administrator. At user side, user can request for information about all buses, routes, <b>timings</b> <b>of</b> buses and all stops in any particular route using Wi-Fi or GPRS technology from his mobile or PDA. At administrator side, administrator can update, delete and insert information about all buses, routes, <b>timings</b> <b>of</b> buses, all stops in any particular route and helpline numbers. Administrator can have all rights about database operations...|$|R

5|$|Chickenpox was {{commonly}} {{confused with}} smallpox {{in the immediate}} post-eradication era. Chickenpox and smallpox can be distinguished by several methods. Unlike smallpox, chickenpox does not usually affect the palms and soles. Additionally, chickenpox pustules are of varying size due to variations in the <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> pustule eruption: smallpox pustules are all very nearly the same size since the viral effect progresses more uniformly. A variety of laboratory methods are available for detecting chickenpox in evaluation of suspected smallpox cases.|$|E
