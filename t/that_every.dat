5|$|Moving from {{individual}} graphs to graph families, if {{a family of}} graphs has the property <b>that</b> <b>every</b> subgraph of a graph in the family {{is also in the}} family, and every graph in the family has at most as many edges as vertices, then the family contains only pseudoforests. For instance, every subgraph of a thrackle (a graph drawn so <b>that</b> <b>every</b> pair of edges has one point of intersection) is also a thrackle, so Conway's conjecture <b>that</b> <b>every</b> thrackle has at most as many edges as vertices can be restated as saying <b>that</b> <b>every</b> thrackle is a pseudoforest. A more precise characterization is that, if the conjecture is true, then the thrackles are exactly the pseudoforests with no four-vertex cycle and at most one odd cycle.|$|E
5|$|Bose {{commented that}} Ganguly's {{greatest}} legacy {{lay in his}} influence on the younger and budding generation of cricketers. Ganguly felt <b>that</b> <b>every</b> young player should play two years of domestic cricket before being selected for international assignments. He also said <b>that</b> <b>every</b> newcomer should be given at least five games to prove himself. Later he explained that being at {{the receiving end of}} an unfair decision against him, that threatened to ruin his international cricket career, it enabled him to understand the insecurities of other newcomers in the team better than his predecessors. Ganguly had always backed the influence and contribution of younger players of the team.|$|E
