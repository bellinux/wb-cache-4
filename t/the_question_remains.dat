5|$|Scholars {{continue}} to debate whether Chacoan organization {{was based on}} primarily political or primarily ritual considerations. Archeological {{evidence suggests that the}} residents of great houses like Chetro Ketl were of a higher social class than those living in smaller settlements, which may indicate a systemic inequality that is considered a hallmark of hierarchal political systems. Others view Chaco as an egalitarian society, with an economy driven by its function as the region's ceremonial center. Because there has been little to no modern excavation in the canyon, <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>remains</b> largely unanswered. Lynne Sebastian suggests that any analysis based on a strict dichotomy of ritual versus political purpose is inherently misguided, because the Chacoans were most likely deeply influenced by both.|$|E
5|$|The {{administration}} has {{said earlier that}} {{it will be able to}} allocate different payment amounts to different people. To that end, in 2009, forms were distributed asking Iranians to report income, assets and property but <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>remains</b> on how the government will verify this information gathered by self-reporting. Many people have chosen not to report or withhold information. The {{administration has}} categorized the people into three income brackets; namely lower, middle, and higher for the implementation of the subsidy reform plan. On the other side, it was not clear in what form the compensation would be distributed, direct cash or goods. Another concern is the accuracy of government information on family incomes.|$|E

25|$|A perfect crystal is one {{in which}} the {{internal}} lattice structure extends uninterrupted in all directions. The perfect order can be represented by translational symmetry along three (not usually orthogonal) axes. Every lattice element of the structure is in its proper place, whether it is a single atom or a molecular grouping. For substances that exist in two (or more) stable crystalline forms, such as diamond and graphite for carbon, {{there is a kind of}} chemical degeneracy. <b>The</b> <b>question</b> <b>remains</b> whether both can have zero entropy at T=0 even though each is perfectly ordered.|$|E
25|$|Sleep {{studies using}} polysomnography have {{suggested}} {{that people who have}} sleep disruption have elevated nighttime levels of circulating cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone. They also have an elevated metabolic rate, which does not occur in people who do not have insomnia but whose sleep is intentionally disrupted during a sleep study. Studies of brain metabolism using positron emission tomography (PET) scans indicate that people with insomnia have higher metabolic rates by night and by day. <b>The</b> <b>question</b> <b>remains</b> whether these changes are the causes or consequences of long-term insomnia.|$|E
25|$|There are however {{problems}} with the shell model when an attempt is made to account for nuclear properties well away from closed shells.

Problems with the shell model have led some to propose realistic two-body and three-body nuclear force effects involving nucleon clusters and then build the nucleus on this basis. Two such cluster models are the Close-Packed Spheron Model of Linus Pauling and the 2D Ising Model of MacGregor.|$|E

25|$|The {{rejection}} {{is not of}} Pliny's {{eyewitness account}} or of Pliny's date, as transmitted in the text read in modern times. The rejection focuses on manuscript variants looking for possible sources of copyist alteration of Pliny's date. In some ancient and medieval manuscripts of other authors, the month has been omitted. If some original had no month, then the copyists may have felt obliged to provide one, but chose wrongly. Rolandi et al. suggest an original date of a.d. IX kal dec (November 23) or a.d. ix kal nov (October 24) {{more in line with}} the evidence of weather observations and wind patterns. <b>The</b> <b>question</b> <b>remains</b> an open one, and different reliable scholarly sources (modern secondary sources and discussions) continue to propose different dates.|$|E
500|$|All North American Drosera species produce sterile hybrids. The {{natural hybrid}} D. rotundifolia × D. linearis (conventionally but {{incorrectly}} {{referred to as}} Drosera ×anglica), is also sterile but is morphologically similar to the modern D. anglica. Errors in meiosis during ovule and pollen production, however, {{can result in a}} chromosome doubling which can allow for [...] seed to be produced. The resulting plants, known as amphiploids, would be fertile. Woods noted that this appeared to be an ongoing process with D. anglica speciating from D. rotundifolia × D. linearis through amphidiploidy in multiple locations. <b>The</b> <b>question</b> <b>remains</b> as to why D. anglica is so widespread, whereas the range of D. linearis is limited to the Great Lakes region of North America. The greater adaptability of D. anglica to varied habitat conditions could be a major factor.|$|E
500|$|If the King and Gaveston {{were indeed}} lovers, <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>remains</b> of what effect this had on their {{respective}} careers and eventual downfalls. John Boswell, in his Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality, calls Gaveston Edward's lover, and writes {{that there is}} little doubt [...] "that [...] wife and the barons of England were violently hostile to Edward's sexual proclivities, although he more than fulfilled his royal duties by fathering four children with Isabella". Boswell argues that Edward and Gaveston fell victim to a new-found concern about sexual morals among the secular powers of Europe, manifested shortly before in the trial of the Knights Templar in 1307. This interpretation is disputed by Hamilton. [...] "The favourite was murdered because of his control of patronage," [...] writes Hamilton, [...] "not because of his access to the king's bedchamber". This same view is also expressed by Roy Martin Haines, in his 2003 biography of the King.|$|E

500|$|Then, most [...] "wild" [...] plants fit {{neatly into}} the nested {{hierarchy}} of ranks used in Linnaean classification (species into genera, genera into families etc.) which aligns with Darwinian descent with modification. Choosing classification categories for cultigens is not clear-cut. Included among cultigens are: simple selections taken [...] from {{plants in the}} wild or in cultivation; artificial hybrids produced both by accident and [...] intention; plants produced by genetic engineering; clonal material reproduced by cuttings, grafting, budding, layering etc.; graft-chimaeras; selections from the wild; ancient selections of crops that date back thousands of years; selections of aberrant growth such as witches brooms; the results of deliberate repeatable single crosses between two pure lines to produce plants of a particular general appearance that is desirable for horticulture, but which are not genetically identical. <b>The</b> <b>question</b> <b>remains</b> {{as to whether the}} classification categories of cultivar, Group and grex are the most appropriate and efficient way to deal with this broad range of plant variation.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{its vast}} extent, the {{collective}} {{mass of the}} Kuiper belt is relatively low. The total mass is estimated to range between 1/25 and 1/10 {{the mass of the}} Earth. Conversely, models of the Solar System's formation predict a collective mass for the Kuiper belt of 30 Earth masses. This missing >99% of the mass can hardly be dismissed, because it is required for the accretion of any KBOs larger than [...] in diameter. If the Kuiper belt had always had its current low density, these large objects simply could not have formed by the collision and mergers of smaller planetesimals. Moreover, the eccentricity and inclination of current orbits makes the encounters quite [...] "violent" [...] resulting in destruction rather than accretion. It appears that either the current residents of the Kuiper belt have been created closer to the Sun, or some mechanism dispersed the original mass. Neptune's current influence is too weak to explain such a massive [...] "vacuuming", though the Nice model proposes {{that it could have been}} the cause of mass removal in the past. Although <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>remains</b> open, the conjectures vary from a passing star scenario to grinding of smaller objects, via collisions, into dust small enough to be affected by solar radiation. The extent of mass loss by collisional grinding is limited by the presence of loosely bound binaries in the cold disk, which are likely to be disrupted in collisions.|$|E
