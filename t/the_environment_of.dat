40|$|The overall aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{investigate}} <b>the</b> <b>environments</b> <b>of</b> AGN, in particular, the density <b>of</b> galaxies in <b>the</b> <b>environments</b> <b>of</b> radio-loud and radio-quiet AGN. This determines whether AGN trace dense environments at high redshifts and whether <b>the</b> <b>environments</b> are important in addressing the problem of radio-loud dichotomy. I extend my research by investigating whether star-formation evolves differently in high-redshift AGN <b>environments</b> compared to <b>the</b> field. I begin by investigating <b>the</b> <b>environments</b> <b>of</b> 169 AGN using Spitzer data at z ??? 1. I investigate the source density of star-forming galaxies in <b>the</b> <b>environments</b> <b>of</b> radio galaxies, radio-loud quasars and radio- quiet quasars. I do not find any significant overdensity of star-forming galaxies in these environments, although I find tentative evidence for a diff	erence in the colours of galaxies in <b>the</b> radio galaxy <b>environments</b> compared to <b>the</b> quasar and field environments. I next use VIDEO data to investigate <b>the</b> <b>environments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> quasars out to z ??? 3. Firstly, I use a training sample of QSOs and galaxies, which trains a neural network to detect QSOs in the VIDEO data. I detect 274 possible QSOs in the VIDEO data using this method. I am able to determine that {{the efficiency of the}} neural network clas- sification is 95 per cent using the training sample. I compare these results to a colour selection method, which detects 88 QSOs in the VIDEO data, and find that the neural network is able to detect ??? 80 per cent of the colour selected QSOs at Ks = 21. I then investigate the source overdensity using a radial analysis on <b>the</b> <b>environments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> VIDEO QSOs. I find a significant overdensity <b>of</b> galaxies in <b>the</b> <b>environments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> whole QSO sample and in <b>the</b> <b>environments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> radio-loud quasars compared to the radio-quiet quasars. I extend the density analysis by using a second density measure, called the spatial clustering amplitude technique, to compare <b>the</b> <b>environments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> quasars with their radio luminosities, absolute magnitudes and redshifts. I do not fi any significant correlations between environmental density and radio luminosity, absolute magnitude or redshift for the QSOs. I extend this research to investigate the type of galaxies found in <b>the</b> AGN <b>environments.</b> However, I do not find any significant differences between the type of galaxies found in <b>the</b> QSO <b>environments</b> and <b>the</b> background field...|$|R

5|$|Beagles are the {{dog breed}} {{most often used}} in animal testing, due to their size and passive nature. Beagles are used {{in a range of}} {{research}} procedures: fundamental biological research, applied human medicine, applied veterinary medicine, and protection of man, animals or <b>the</b> <b>environment.</b> <b>Of</b> the 8,018 dogs used in testing in the UK in 2004, 7,799 were beagles (97.3%). In the UK, the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 gave special status to primates, equids, cats and dogs and in 2005 the Animal Procedures Committee (set up by the act) ruled that testing on mice was preferable, even though a greater number of individual animals were involved. In 2005 beagles were involved in less than 0.3% of the total experiments on animals in the UK, but of the 7670 experiments performed on dogs 7406 involved beagles (96.6%). Most dogs are bred specifically for this purpose, by companies such as Harlan. In the UK companies breeding animals for research must be licensed under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act.|$|E
5|$|Both commanders were {{a product}} of <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> <b>of</b> European warfare, which {{generally}} took place in open fields with relatively easy mobility, and were thus uncomfortable with woodland warfare.

5|$|Owing {{to their}} wood-eating habits, many termite species can do great damage to {{unprotected}} buildings and other wooden structures. Their habit of remaining concealed {{often results in}} their presence being undetected until the timbers are severely damaged, leaving {{a thin layer of}} a wall that protects them from <b>the</b> <b>environment.</b> <b>Of</b> the 3,106 species known, only 183 species cause damage; 83 species cause significant damage to wooden structures. In North America, nine subterranean species are pests; in Australia, 16 species have an economic impact; in the Indian subcontinent 26 species are considered pests, and in tropical Africa, 24. In Central America and the West Indies, there are 17 pest species. Among the termite genera, Coptotermes has the highest number of pest species of any genus, with 28 species known to cause damage. Less than 10% of drywood termites are pests, but they infect wooden structures and furniture in tropical, subtropical and other regions. Dampwood termites only attack lumber material exposed to rainfall or soil.|$|E

40|$|Drash and Tudor {{describe}} six sets {{of reinforcement}} contingencies {{which may be}} present in <b>the</b> <b>environments</b> <b>of</b> some children eventually diagnosed with autism and suggest that these contingencies account for the etiology of “autistic” behaviors. Nevertheless, merely observing such contingencies in <b>the</b> <b>environments</b> <b>of</b> these children is insufficient to establish {{a positive correlation between}} the contingencies and “autistic” behaviors, let alone a causal relationship. To demonstrate a positive correlation, it is necessary to present evidence that the relevant contingencies are present more often in <b>the</b> <b>environments</b> <b>of</b> children exhibiting these behaviors than in <b>the</b> <b>environments</b> <b>of</b> children not exhibiting these behaviors. This condition has not been met, since no evidence to the effect that such contingencies are absent in <b>the</b> <b>environments</b> <b>of</b> typical children or children with disabilities other than autism has been presented. In fact, the opposite appears to be true, as is argued in the present commentary. It appears that Drash and Tudor's account of autism etiology is incomplete in that it neglects the role of unlearned differences between children and their possible interactions with <b>the</b> social <b>environment</b> in shaping “autistic” behaviors. Despite the misconception held by some that behavior analysis is a radically environmental approach, unlearned differences may be discussed within a behavioral framework. A “completely behavioral” account may discuss such differences in terms of susceptibility to reinforcement or punishment, speed of conditioning, or other unlearned characteristics which are potentially testable...|$|R
