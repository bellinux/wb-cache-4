5|$|Director Brian Lighthill {{revisited}} {{the radio}} adaptation proposal and obtained the rights in 1995. After Lighthill received a go-ahead from BBC Radio in 1996, he commissioned a script from Tony Mulholland, {{resulting in a}} new, two-part adaptation. The BBC produced the two-hour radio dramatization of <b>the</b> <b>novel,</b> <b>and</b> broadcast it on BBC Radio 4 in November 1997. The recording was released on cassette by BBC Audiobooks in 1998 and on CD in 2007.|$|E
5|$|In 1967, {{the book}} was adapted into the fifth film in the Eon Productions series, {{starring}} Sean Connery as Bond. Only a few elements of <b>the</b> <b>novel</b> <b>and</b> {{a limited number of}} Fleming's characters survive into the film version.|$|E
5|$|Many writers {{compare their}} {{perceptions}} of To Kill a Mockingbird as adults with when they first read it as children. Mary McDonagh Murphy interviewed celebrities including Oprah Winfrey, Rosanne Cash, Tom Brokaw, and Harper's sister Alice Lee, who read <b>the</b> <b>novel</b> <b>and</b> compiled their impressions of it as children and adults into a book titled Scout, Atticus, and Boo.|$|E
6000|$|One last weary little word. This pseudo-philosophy of mine--"pollyanalytics," [...] {{as one of}} my {{respected}} critics might say--is deduced from <b>the</b> <b>novels</b> <b>and</b> poems, not <b>the</b> reverse. <b>The</b> <b>novels</b> <b>and</b> poems come unwatched out of one's pen. And {{then the}} absolute need which one has for some sort of satisfactory mental attitude towards oneself and things in general makes one try to abstract some definite conclusions from one's experiences as a writer and as a man. <b>The</b> <b>novels</b> <b>and</b> poems are pure passionate experience. These [...] "pollyanalytics" [...] are inferences made afterwards, from the experience.|$|R

5|$|The {{literary}} Dracula transforms into a bat {{several times}} in <b>the</b> <b>novel,</b> <b>and</b> vampire bats themselves are mentioned twice in it. The 1927 stage production of Dracula followed the novel in having Dracula turn into a bat, as did the film, where Béla Lugosi would transform into a bat. The bat transformation scene was used again by Lon Chaney Jr. in 1943's Son of Dracula.|$|E
5|$|The {{novel was}} also well {{received}} by critics. Rowling was praised for her imagination by USA Today writer Deirdre Donahue. Most {{of the negative}} reviewers were concerned with the violence contained in <b>the</b> <b>novel</b> <b>and</b> with morality issues occurring throughout the book.|$|E

5|$|Tracy Enid Flick is {{a fictional}} character, {{subjected}} in the 1998 novel Election by Tom Perrotta and portrayed by Reese Witherspoon in the 1999 film {{adaptation of the}} same title. Tracy is a smart, ambitious high school student, whose quest to win a school election is nearly derailed by her own ruthlessness and desperation.

5|$|Twentieth-century feminist critics {{embraced the}} work, {{integrating}} {{it into the}} history of <b>the</b> <b>novel</b> <b>and</b> feminist discourse.

5|$|While {{more recent}} critics have {{emphasized}} the revolutionary aspects of the cross-class friendship between Jemima and Maria, others have questioned the extent of that radicalism, arguing that Jemima's story occupies a small section of <b>the</b> <b>novel</b> <b>and</b> is abruptly truncated. Mary Poovey also maintains that Wollstonecraft fails to extend her critique of marriage and society from the individual to the systemic level.|$|E
5|$|Battle Royale was {{translated}} into English by Yuji Oniki and released in North America by Viz Media on February 26, 2003. An expanded edition with a revision of Oniki's translation and an afterword by Takami was published on November 17, 2009 by Haikasoru, a division of Viz Media. This version also included {{an interview with the}} director of the book's film adaptation, Kinji Fukasaku. Viz released a new translation by Nathan Collins on April 1, 2014, under the title Battle Royale: Remastered. They also published The Battle Royale Slam Book: Essays on the Cult Classic by Koushun Takami on the same day, which includes essays on the details of <b>the</b> <b>novel</b> <b>and</b> the controversies surrounding it as well as its adaptations written by science-fiction, horror, and thriller authors such as Brian Keene, John Skipp, and Catherynne M. Valente.|$|E
5|$|During this period, Bakshi reread J. D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye, {{which he}} had first read in high school, and saw {{parallels}} between his situation {{and that of the}} book's protagonist, Holden Caulfield. Inspired to seek the film rights, he intended to shoot the story's bracketing sequences in live action and to animate the core flashback scenes. Salinger had rejected previous offers to adapt <b>the</b> <b>novel,</b> <b>and</b> had not made a public appearance since 1965 or granted an interview since 1980. Bakshi sent Salinger a letter explaining why he should be allowed to adapt the novel; the writer responded by thanking Bakshi and asserting that the novel was unfit for any medium other than its original form.|$|E

5|$|From 1999 to 2001, {{the book}} was also adapted as an {{animated}} television series, broadcast on CITV in the UK and on YTV in Canada. It was produced by Martin Rosen and starred several well-known British actors, including Stephen Fry, Rik Mayall, Dawn French, John Hurt, and Richard Briers, running {{for a total of}} 39 episodes over three seasons. Although the story was broadly based on that of <b>the</b> <b>novel</b> <b>and</b> most characters and events retained, some of the story lines and characters (especially in later episodes) were entirely new. In 2003, the second season was nominated for a Gemini Award for Best Original Music Score for a Dramatic Series.|$|E
5|$|In {{preparing}} for their roles, the actors were granted access to lawyers who {{would act as}} advisors. Ford observed murder trials with Pakula at the Recorder's Court in Detroit and viewed training footage from the Michigan Prosecutors' Association. Greta Scacchi, who plays Carolyn Polhemus, observed Linda Fairstein, head of the Manhattan District Attorney's sex crimes unit. Raúl Juliá, who plays Sandy Stern, researched his role by meeting with criminal lawyer Michael Kennedy. Paul Winfield lobbied {{for the role of}} Judge Larren Lyttle upon reading <b>the</b> <b>novel</b> <b>and</b> learning that the adaptation was to be directed by Pakula. Winfield met with New York Supreme Court judge Bruce M. Wright, who insisted that he wear a judiciary robe and observe several cases.|$|E
5|$|On 5 April 1809, {{about three}} months before the family's move to Chawton, Austen wrote an angry letter to Richard Crosby, {{offering}} him a new manuscript of Susan if needed to secure the immediate publication of <b>the</b> <b>novel,</b> <b>and</b> requesting the return of the original so she could find another publisher. Crosby replied that he had not agreed to publish the book by any particular time, or at all, and that Austen could repurchase the manuscript for the £10 he had paid her and find another publisher. She did not have the resources to buy the copyright back at that time, but was able to purchase it in 1816.|$|E

5|$|One of the {{greatest}} influences on Tolkien was the 19th-century Arts and Crafts polymath William Morris. Tolkien wished to imitate Morris's prose and poetry romances, following the general style and approach of the work. The Desolation of Smaug as portraying dragons as detrimental to landscape, has been noted as an explicit motif borrowed from Morris. Tolkien wrote also of being impressed as a boy by Samuel Rutherford Crockett's historical novel The Black Douglas and of basing the Necromancer—Sauron—on its villain, Gilles de Retz. Incidents in both The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings are similar in narrative and style to <b>the</b> <b>novel,</b> <b>and</b> its overall style and imagery have been suggested as having had an influence on Tolkien.|$|E
5|$|Peggy Robertson, Hitchcock's long-time assistant, read Anthony Boucher's {{positive}} {{review of}} <b>the</b> <b>novel</b> <b>and</b> decided {{to show the}} book to her employer, even though studio readers at Paramount Pictures had already rejected its premise for a film. Hitchcock acquired rights to the novel for $9,500 and reportedly ordered Robertson to buy up copies to preserve the novel's surprises. Hitchcock, {{who had come to}} face genre competitors whose works were critically compared to his own, was seeking new material to recover from two aborted projects with Paramount, Flamingo Feather and No Bail for the Judge. He disliked stars' salary demands and trusted only a few people to choose prospective material, including Robertson.|$|E
5|$|Pemmer Harge rem ir Tibe is Argaven Harge's cousin. Tibe {{becomes the}} prime {{minister}} of Karhide when Estraven is exiled at the beginning of <b>the</b> <b>novel,</b> <b>and</b> becomes the regent for a brief while when Argaven is pregnant. In contrast to Estraven, he seems intent on starting a war with Orgoreyn over the Sinnoth Valley dispute; as well as taking aggressive actions at the border, he regularly makes belligerent speeches on the radio. He is strongly opposed to Ai's mission. He orders Estraven to be killed at the border {{at the end of the}} novel, as a last act of defiance, knowing that Estraven and Ai's presence in Karhide means his own downfall; he resigns immediately after Estraven's death.|$|E
