5|$|On M1, the anterocone (<b>the</b> <b>cusp</b> at {{the front}} of the tooth) is not divided into smaller cuspules. The {{connection}} between the protocone and the paracone, the major cusps immediately after the anterocone, is located relatively far toward the front. Behind the paracone, the mesoloph accessory crest is present. On M2, there is no protoflexus (an indentation in front of the protocone, which on this tooth is the frontmost cusp) and the valley between the paracone and the mesoloph, the mesoflexus, is not divided into two pieces by a paracone–mesoloph connection. These traits are both characteristic of the Nectomys subclade. The mesoloph is present on M3, but the posteroloph, a crest at the back of the tooth, is absent or vestigial, as is the hypoflexus (the valley between the protocone and <b>the</b> <b>cusp</b> behind it, the hypocone). The absence or near-absence of the posteroloph is a distinctive trait that differentiates Pennatomys from related oryzomyines.|$|E

5|$|Enamel is {{the hardest}} and most highly mineralized {{substance}} of the body. It {{is one of the}} four major tissues which make up the tooth, along with dentin, cementum, and dental pulp. It is normally visible and must be supported by underlying dentin. 96% of enamel consists of mineral, with water and organic material comprising the rest. The normal color of enamel varies from light yellow to grayish white. At the edges of teeth where there is no dentin underlying the enamel, the color sometimes has a slightly blue tone. Since enamel is semitranslucent, the color of dentin and any restorative dental material underneath the enamel strongly affects the appearance of a tooth. Enamel varies in thickness over the surface of the tooth and is often thickest at <b>the</b> <b>cusp,</b> up to 2.5mm, and thinnest at its border, which is seen clinically as the CEJ. The wear rate of enamel, called attrition, is 8 micrometers a year from normal factors.|$|E

In front of the hypoconid, an ectostylid (a smaller cuspule) is present. The entoconid cusp, located lingually, is relatively high and is separated from the mesolophid before it by a deep valley. Another crest, the posterolophid, is present behind the hypoconid.

40|$|PURPOSE: To assess {{anatomical}} {{characteristics of}} the aortic valve, {{so that they may}} be useful in diagnostic situations and surgical treatment. METHODS: The study analyzed 100 healthy fixed human hearts; 84 % of them obtained from males, 61 % of them from Caucasian individuals. The ages of the individuals ranged from 9 to 86 years (mean 30 ± 15. 5 years). The characteristics assessed related to age, sex, and race were the following: number and height of <b>the</b> <b>cusps,</b> size of <b>the</b> lunulae, internal and external intercommissural distance, position of the coronary ostium in relation to the aortic valve, position of the ventricular septum in relation to the aortic valve, thickness of <b>the</b> <b>cusps.</b> RESULTS: All hearts assessed had a tricuspidal aortic valve. In regard to the height of <b>the</b> <b>cusps</b> and size of the lunula, <b>the</b> left coronary <b>cusp</b> was larger, followed by <b>the</b> right coronary <b>cusp</b> and <b>the</b> noncoronary <b>cusp.</b> <b>The</b> internal and external intercommissural distances had mean values of 24. 6 ± 5. 7 mm and 19. 7 ± 7 mm, respectively. In regard to the position of the coronary ostia, in one heart two ostia emerged from the left coronary sinus, and in another, the ostium was supracommissural. The mean diameter of the aorta was 21. 8 ± 3. 6 mm, and there were no significant sexual or racial differences, but the diameter increased progressively with the increase in age. The thickness of <b>the</b> <b>cusps</b> did not show any significant difference in the 3 points assessed. CONCLUSION: The aortic valve annulus did not show a perfect circumference, with some variations in the measurements of the annulus, in <b>the</b> <b>cusps</b> and in <b>the</b> relation with the ventricular septum...|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>cusp</b> at {{the front}} of M1, the anterocone, is {{separated}} into two smaller cusps by an indentation. In A.donovani, a ridge generally connects the two cusps {{at the front}} margin of the tooth, so that the indentation separating them is closed at the front (an anteromedian fossette), but in A.praeuniversitatis, it is open toward the front (an anteromedian flexus). An additional crest, the anteroloph, is present behind the anterocone. Further to the back, there is a pair of cusps—the protocone at the lingual, or inner, side and the paracone at the labial, or outer, side. A crest issues from the paracone and is attached to the front or middle part of the protocone. Behind the paracone, the mesoloph crest is present; an additional crest usually connects the two. At the back of the tooth, there are two additional large cusps—the hypocone (lingual) and metacone (labial)—and a prominent crest, the posteroloph, issues from the hypocone and is located behind the metacone. In A.donovani, the metacone is generally connected to the posteroloph, but in A.praeuniversitatis, it is directly connected to the hypocone. The valleys that separate the cusps extend from the lingual and labial margins to about the midline of the molar.
