40|$|Many {{real-world}} problems involve {{constraints that}} cannot be all satisfied. Solving an overconstrained problem then means {{to find solutions}} minimizing the number of constraints violated, which is an optimization problem. In this research, we study the behavior <b>of</b> the phase <b>transitions</b> and backbones <b>of</b> constraint optimization problems. We rst investigate {{the relationship between the}} phase <b>transitions</b> <b>of</b> Boolean satisfiability, or precisely 3 -SAT (a well-studied NP-complete decision problem), and the phase <b>transitions</b> <b>of</b> MAX 3 -SAT (an NP-hard optimization problem). To bridge the gap between the easy-hard-easy phase <b>transitions</b> <b>of</b> 3 -SAT and the easy-hard <b>transitions</b> <b>of</b> MAX 3 -SAT, we analyze bounded 3 -SAT, in which solutions of bounded quality, e. g., solutions with at most a constant number of constraints violated, are sufficient...|$|R

5|$|According to an {{alternative}} theory, {{popular in the}} earlier 20th century and still represented today, the medieval cultures {{in the area of}} modern Poland are not a result of massive immigration, but emerged from a cultural <b>transition</b> <b>of</b> earlier indigenous populations, who then would need to be regarded as early Slavs. This view has mostly been discarded, primarily due to a period of archaeological discontinuity, during which settlements were absent or rare, and because of cultural incompatibility of the late ancient and early medieval sites.|$|E
40|$|The thermal <b>transitions</b> <b>of</b> confi ned {{polymers}} {{are important}} {{for the application of}} polymers in molecular scale devices and advanced nanotechnology. However, thermal <b>transitions</b> <b>of</b> ultrathin polymer assemblies confi ned in subnanometre spaces are poorly understood. In this study, we show that incorporation of polyethylene glycol (PEG) into nanochannels of porous coordination polymers (PCPs) enabled observation <b>of</b> thermal <b>transitions</b> <b>of</b> the chain assemblies by differential scanning calorimetry. The pore size and surface functionality of PCPs can be tailored to study the <b>transition</b> behaviour <b>of</b> confi ned polymers.

To {{understand the}} correlation between the hydration state and the various self-assembled structures of a nonionic surfactant, terahertz time-domain spectroscopy has been performed for a C(12) E(5) solution with complementary use of small-angle x-ray scattering. Precise observations of the hydration state show clearly that <b>transitions</b> <b>of</b> the hydration state are accompanied by structural phase <b>transitions</b> <b>of</b> the surfactant from hexagonal to micelle to lamellae.

5|$|One {{disadvantage}} of the m-type section was that at frequencies past the pole of attenuation, {{the response of}} the filter started to increase again, reaching a peak somewhere in the stop-band and then falling again. Zobel overcame this problem by designing hybrid filters using a mixture of constant k and m-type sections. This gave Zobel the advantages of both: the fast <b>transition</b> <b>of</b> the m-type and good stop-band rejection of the constant k.|$|E
5|$|Photons {{can also}} be absorbed by nuclei, atoms or molecules, {{provoking}} transitions between their energy levels. A classic example is the molecular <b>transition</b> <b>of</b> retinal (C20H28O), {{which is responsible for}} vision, as discovered in 1958 by Nobel laureate biochemist George Wald and co-workers. The absorption provokes a cis-trans isomerization that, in combination with other such transitions, is transduced into nerve impulses. The absorption of photons can even break chemical bonds, as in the photodissociation of chlorine; this is the subject of photochemistry.|$|E
