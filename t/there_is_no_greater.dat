500|$|Scot Guenter (American Studies) {{considered}} the biography [...] "particularly timely" [...] for the post-September 11 relevance of Meiklejohn's democratic {{experiments in the}} face of the privatization of higher education, and of Meiklejohn's courage towards free speech. He wrote that Meiklejohn's views on curriculum would arouse [...] "needed" [...] reflection in college instructors, and that the book's audience should include university administration and those interested in civil liberties as well as historians and philosophers of education. Guenter appreciated how Nelson presented the shortcomings of Meiklejohn's ego and spendthrift lifestyle. Robert Sherman, writing for the History of Education Quarterly and reflecting on the depth of the appendices, struggled to consider [...] "how such a work could be more complete". He wrote through Louis Menand that Meiklejohn's [...] "certitude [...] to violence" [...] and that by letting him speak for himself, Nelson made the French philosopher Charles Renouvier's point that only individuals are certain and that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>greater</b> certainty. Guenter added that the biography read best in the parts where Nelson was clearly inspired by Meiklejohn's zeal and idealism, particularly the [...] "What Does the First Amendment Mean?" [...] chapter, which Guenter considered essential reading.|$|E

I want to call on you all to be strong, because <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>greater</b> responsibility than loyal service to our country and our people." [...] Rabbi Mikhailashvili stated, [...] "The Jewish community mourns the sudden loss of Zurab Zhvania. As a Jew, he had a close relationship to the Jewish community in Georgia."

2500|$|Moses, like a {{carnival}} barker, sells {{tickets to the}} trials. He serves as prosecutor, Fatty as defense attorney, Begbick as judge. First comes the case of Toby Higgins, accused of premeditated murder {{for the purpose of}} testing an old revolver. Fatty invites the injured party to rise, but no one does so, since the dead do not speak. Toby bribes all three, and as a result, Begbick dismisses the case. Next Jimmy's case is called. Chained, he is led in by Billy, from whom he tries to borrow money; Billy of course refuses, despite Jim's plea to remember their time together in Alaska. In virtually the same speech he used to attack Higgins, Moses excoriates him for not paying his bills, for seducing Jenny (who presents herself as a plaintiff) to commit a [...] "carnal act" [...] with him for money, and for inciting the crowd with [...] "an illegal joyous song" [...] {{on the night of the}} typhoon. Billy, with the chorus's support, counters that, in committing the latter act, Jimmy discovered the laws by which Mahagonny lives. Moses argues that Jim hastened his friend Joe's death in a prizefight by betting on him, and Billy counters by asking who actually killed Joe. Moses does not reply. But there is no answer for the main count against him. Jim gets short sentences for his lesser crimes, but for having no money, he is sentenced to death. Begbick, Fatty and Moses, rising to identify themselves as the injured parties, proclaim [...] "in the whole human race / <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>greater</b> criminal / than a man without money". As Jim is led off to await execution, everyone sings the [...] "Benares Song", in which they long for that exotic city [...] "where the sun is shining." [...] But Benares has been destroyed by an earthquake. [...] "Where shall we go?" [...] they ask.|$|E
