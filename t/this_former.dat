5|$|Stephen {{supported}} Maximilian of Habsburg, who {{urged the}} Three Nations of Transylvania {{to cooperate with}} Stephen against his opponents. Most Hungarian lords and prelates, however, supported Vladislaus who was crowned king on 21 September, forcing Maximilian to withdraw from Hungary in November. For John Albert (who was his father's heir in Poland) did not abandon his claim, Stephen decided to support Vladislaus {{in order to prevent}} a personal union between Hungary and Poland. He broke into Poland and captured Pocuția (now Pokuttya in Ukraine). He believed that he was entitled to <b>this</b> <b>former</b> Moldavian fief, its revenue redirected toward paying the Ottoman tribute. Stephen also supported Vladislaus against the Ottomans who broke into Hungary several times after Corvinus' death. In exchange, Vladislaus confirmed Stephen's claim to Ciceu and Cetatea de Baltă in Transylvania. John Albert, in turn, was forced to acknowledge his brother as the lawful king in late 1491.|$|E
5|$|The 1927 {{edition of}} the {{official}} Michigan highway service map {{was the first to}} show M-28 extended along US41 into Marquette County and east over the former M-25 through Munising and Newberry, before ending in downtown Sault Ste. Marie. At Negaunee, M-28 was shown along the previous routing of M-15 between Negaunee and Marquette for , while US41 ran along a portion of M-35. This southern loop routing of M-28 lasted until approximately 1936, when M-28 was displayed as concurrent with US41. The former route is now Marquette County Road 492 (CR492). Around 1930, the northern terminus of US41 was extended east from Copper Harbor to Fort Wilkins State Park. Another realignment shown in 1937 marked the transfer of US41/M-28 out of downtown Ishpeming and Negaunee. <b>This</b> <b>former</b> routing later became Bus. M-28. The highway was realigned due north between Rapid River and Trenary according to the 1938 service map. US41 was completely paved in 1951. The final two sections to be paved were in Baraga County and Keweenaw County.|$|E
5|$|While Philip V {{was busy}} {{fighting}} Rome's Greek allies, Rome viewed {{this as an}} opportunity to punish <b>this</b> <b>former</b> ally of Hannibal with a war that they hoped would supply a victory and require few resources. The Roman Senate demanded that PhilipV cease hostilities against neighboring Greek powers and defer to an international arbitration committee for settling grievances. When the comitia centuriata finally voted in approval of the Roman Senate's declaration of war in 200BC and handed their ultimatum to PhilipV, demanding that a tribunal assess the damages owed to Rhodes and Pergamon, the Macedonian king rejected it. This marked the beginning of the Second Macedonian War (200–197BC), with Publius Sulpicius Galba Maximus spearheading military operations in Apollonia.|$|E
