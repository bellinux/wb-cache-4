She was related to Francis Tresham, one of the plotters. Both Vaux and Tresham have been suspected of being the author of an anonymous letter to William Parker, 4th Baron Monteagle warning him to avoid Parliament on 5 November 1605, the day that the Gunpowder Plotters intended <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> it <b>up.</b> This <b>letter,</b> which Monteagle gave to Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury, was instrumental in foiling the plot. The identity of the letter's author has never been conclusively determined. The theory that it was written by Vaux is based largely on [...] "perceived similarities" [...] between her handwriting and that used in the letter.|$|R
