5|$|Being {{named the}} nation's top quarterback {{coming out of}} high school, Sanchez was well {{regarded}} upon his arrival at USC. With upperclassmen Matt Leinart and John David Booty returning, Sanchez did not play during his freshman year in 2005, opting to redshirt <b>to</b> <b>preserve</b> <b>a</b> year of eligibility. During this time, he participated as the quarterback of USC's scout team, earning the Trojans' Service Team Offensive Player of the Year Award.|$|E
5|$|Cabo Blanco, in the Atlantic Ocean, is {{the largest}} {{surviving}} single population of the species, and the only remaining site that still seems <b>to</b> <b>preserve</b> <b>a</b> colony structure. In the summer of 1997, a disease killed more than 200 animals (two-thirds of its population) within two months, extremely compromising the species' viable population. While opinions on the precise causes of this epidemic remain divided, the most likely cause is a morbilivirus or a toxic algae bloom.|$|E

He played college football with the Washington State Cougars. In his senior year, he missed all but two games due to a broken thumb. Alipate returned in time for the Aloha Bowl against the Houston Cougars, where he forced a fumble on Houston's final possession <b>to</b> <b>preserve</b> <b>a</b> 24–22 win.|$|E

5|$|The British {{arrival in}} Jerusalem heralded a {{rational}} philosophy of infrastructure planning and development. It respected cultural and historic heritage {{and attempted to}} preserve such elements within the blossoming construction of the modern city. The city walls were identified as such an element, so British workers acted to clear away the stalls on their perimeter and maintain an open area between {{the walls and the}} rest of the New City in the interest of an aesthetically pleasing visual basin. By the same token, planners demolished the Ottoman clock tower <b>to</b> <b>preserve</b> <b>a</b> historic skyline.|$|E
5|$|While {{awaiting}} the first delivery of stone, Simson {{noticed that the}} battlefield landscape features were beginning to deteriorate. Seeing an opportunity to not only preserve {{a portion of the}} battlefield but also keep his staff occupied, Simson decided <b>to</b> <b>preserve</b> <b>a</b> short section of trench line and make the Grange Subway more accessible. Labourers rebuilt and preserved sections of sandbagged trench wall, on both the Canadian and German sides of the Grange crater group, in concrete. The workforce also built a new concrete entrance for the Grange Subway and, after excavating a portion of the tunnel system, installed electric lighting.|$|E
5|$|A {{week after}} their loss to LSU, Alabama {{traveled}} to Starkville and defeated their long-time rival, the Mississippi State Bulldogs 24–7. After {{a pair of}} missed field goals, one from 19-yard by Cade Foster and the second from 31-yards by Jeremy Shelley, Alabama scored their first {{points in the second}} quarter. Eddie Lacy capped a five-play, 52-yard drive with a two-yard touchdown run to give the Crimson Tide a 7–0 lead. Later in the quarter Derek DePasquale missed a 41-yard field goal attempt for the Bulldogs, but on the ensuing Alabama possession Cameron Lawrence intercepted an AJ McCarron pass and returned it to the Alabama four-yard line. However, the Alabama defense held the Bulldogs to only a field goal attempt which was then missed from 29-yards by Brian Egan <b>to</b> <b>preserve</b> <b>a</b> 7–0 halftime lead for the Crimson Tide.|$|E

5|$|After {{receiving}} the kickoff, Middle Tennessee quarterback Joe Craddock led an 80-yard, 10-play drive. It included a fake punt that caught Maryland off-guard, which allowed the punter {{to complete a}} 28-yard pass for a first-down conversion. Craddock ended the drive with a 5-yard touchdown pass. On Maryland's second offensive play of the game, Da'Rel Scott broke free for a 63-yard run for a touchdown. In the second quarter, Middle Tennessee re-took the lead with a 31-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Turner threw an interception that was returned 25yards to the Maryland five-yard line, and Middle Tennessee subsequently scored on a rushing play. On Maryland's next possession, Turner completed a short pass to Darrius Heyward-Bey who ran for an 80-yard touchdown. In the fourth quarter, Maryland advanced inside the Middle Tennessee 35-yard line three times, {{but was unable to}} capitalize. Middle Tennessee defenders saved two potential touchdowns with interceptions on their own two-yard line and in the end zone <b>to</b> <b>preserve</b> <b>a</b> Blue Raider victory, 24–14.|$|E
5|$|At home {{in front}} of 75,321 fans, the Giants played the Washington Redskins in Week 8. Each team totaled 16 first downs, four punts and five penalties, and the {{difference}} in time of possession was less than one minute. However, the Giants committed no turnovers while coercing three from the Redskins. Giants cornerback Everson Walls intercepted two passes—including one that he returned for his first career touchdown—and free safety Greg Jackson intercepted another. Walls' interception set up a Giants touchdown and a 14–0 lead in the second quarter. Jackson then intercepted a pass {{in the end zone}} in the third quarter <b>to</b> <b>preserve</b> <b>a</b> 14–10 lead, and Walls returned his second interception 28yards for a touchdown that made the score 21–10 and put the game of reach in the fourth quarter.|$|E
5|$|Funerary poems {{were thought}} <b>to</b> <b>preserve</b> <b>a</b> monarch's soul in death. The Pyramid Texts are the {{earliest}} surviving religious literature incorporating poetic verse. These texts {{do not appear}} in tombs or pyramids originating before the reign of Unas (r. 2375–2345 BC), who had the Pyramid of Unas built at Saqqara. The Pyramid Texts are chiefly concerned with the function of preserving and nurturing {{the soul of the}} sovereign in the afterlife. This aim eventually included safeguarding both the sovereign and his subjects in the afterlife. A variety of textual traditions evolved from the original Pyramid Texts: the Coffin Texts of the Middle Kingdom, the so-called Book of the Dead, Litany of Ra, and Amduat written on papyri from the New Kingdom until the end of ancient Egyptian civilization.|$|E

5|$|Independent twin sets or {{independent}} doubles {{consists of two}} independent cylinders and two regulators, each with a submersible pressure gauge. This system is heavier, more expensive to buy and maintain and more expensive to fill than a single cylinder set. The diver must swap demand valves during the dive <b>to</b> <b>preserve</b> <b>a</b> sufficient reserve of gas in each cylinder. If this is not done, then if a cylinder should fail the diver may end up having an inadequate reserve. Independent twin sets do not work well with air-integrated computers as they usually only monitor one cylinder. The complexity of switching regulators periodically to ensure both cylinders are evenly used may be offset by the redundancy of two entirely separate breathing gas supplies. The cylinders may be mounted as a twin set on the diver's back, or alternatively can be carried in a sidemount configuration where penetration of wrecks or caves requires it, and where the cylinder valves are in easy reach.|$|E
5|$|The Bhuri Singh Museum at Chamba was {{established}} on 14 September 1908 {{in honour of}} the raja at the time, Raja Bhuri Singh, who ruled Chamba from 1904 to 1919. J. Ph. Vogel, an eminent indologist, and expert {{on the history of}} Chamba state, proposed the museum <b>to</b> <b>preserve</b> <b>a</b> number of valuable inscriptions, mostly in Sarda script, which contained some rare information about the medieval history of Chamba; the prashastis (inscriptions) of Sarahan, Devi-ri-kothi and mul Kihar (fountain inscription) are still preserved in the museum. Bhuri Singh donated his family collection of paintings to the museum, including royal portraits which ranged from Basohli to Guler-Kangra in style, and embroidered Pahari miniatures. Numerous artifacts, important to the heritage of Chamba were added, including coins, hill jewelry and royal and traditional costumes, arms and armour, musical instruments and other items. The current museum was built in 1975 in concrete.|$|E
5|$|The Jubilee Plantation, {{created to}} commemorate the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria, was {{established}} in 1887.

The bluebell glade is managed to encourage native British bluebells. Teck Plantation, established in 1905, commemorates the Duke and Duchess of Teck, who lived at White Lodge. Their daughter Mary married George V. Tercentenary Plantation, in 1937, marked the 300th anniversary of the enclosure of the park. Victory Plantation was established in 1946 to {{mark the end of}} the Second World War. Queen Mother's Copse, a small triangular enclosure on the woodland hill halfway between Robin Hood Gate and Ham Gate, was established in 1980 {{to commemorate the}} 80th birthday of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother.|$|E

5|$|The {{advent of}} railroads {{in the late}} 19th century led to further {{development}} in the watershed of Darby Creek. Stops along the Pennsylvania Railroad such as Darby, Prospect Park, and Ridley Park increased in population greatly. Concern {{for the health of}} the creek led Lansdowne residents to raise funds <b>to</b> <b>preserve</b> <b>a</b> stretch of the creek in 1910. In the early 1900s, the major industries in the watershed of Darby Creek included agriculture. However, in modern times, agriculture is only done in a few small areas in the watershed's upper reaches. During this time period, railroads such as the Pennsylvania Railroad, the Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington Railroad, and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad crossed the watershed. A gauging station was established on the creek at Landsowne in 1911.|$|E
5|$|Laser {{remained}} in character as Heiter throughout the filming process, often shouting {{at the rest}} of the cast on set, but wherever possible staying away from the other actors and crew between scenes <b>to</b> <b>preserve</b> <b>a</b> level of separation. He only ate food he had brought onto the set himself, eating mostly fruit. He contributed dialogue for his character and selected many of his character's outfits from his personal wardrobe. Six claims that the jacket Heiter wore, which was bought by Laser, was a genuine jacket worn by real Nazi doctors. Laser was also happy for the other actors in The Human Centipede to add their own ideas to the film. For example, when Heiter is explaining his procedure to his victims, Katsuro's dialogue was improvised, which pleased Laser. During filming Laser accidentally kicked Kitamura (Katsuro), leading to a fight on set between the actors. The incident contributed to the tension and anger throughout the scene they were filming, in which Heiter sits at his dining table eating while the centipede eats dog food from the floor alongside him. Laser also hurt Williams during the scene when Heiter roughly grabs and injects Lindsay, which caused a pause in shooting before the filmmakers could continue.|$|E
