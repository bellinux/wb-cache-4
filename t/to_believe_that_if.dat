5|$|The next season, Bradman made an {{abortive}} bid to {{join the}} Victoria state side. The Melbourne Cricket Club advertised the position of club secretary and he was led <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> he applied, he would get the job. The position, which had been held by Hugh Trumble {{until his death in}} August 1938, {{was one of the most}} prestigious jobs in Australian cricket. The annual salary of £1,000 would make Bradman financially secure while allowing him to retain a connection with the game. On 18 January 1939, the club's committee, on the casting vote of the chairman, chose former Test batsman Vernon Ransford over Bradman.|$|E
25|$|Gender {{roles in}} {{traditional}} Bezanozano families are strictly defined. Men are the {{active participants in}} discussions about public affairs, and are responsible for house construction, earning {{money to pay for}} basic family needs, and preparing the paddy fields for planting. Women are responsible for weaving, tending crops, collecting water, tending the hearth and preparing meals. Similarly, women were traditionally expected to follow behind when walking with a man. Bezanozano men working as porters used <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> a woman passed in front of him while he worked, he would be injured the next time he attempted to carry a load.|$|E
25|$|While honeymooning in Africa, Ellen Rimbauer {{fell ill}} (from an {{unspecified}} {{sexually transmitted disease}} given to her by her unfaithful husband) and made the acquaintance of Sukeena, a local tribeswoman. The two women became very close while Sukeena nursed Ellen back to health, and Sukeena accompanied the Rimbauers back to the newly completed Rose Red to work there full-time as a servant. The Rimbauers soon had two children, Adam and April (born with a withered arm), but Ellen quickly became unhappy with her marriage to her philandering and neglectful, misogynistic husband. After a spiritualist seance, Ellen came <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> she continued to build and expand the house, she would never die (echoing {{the story of the}} Winchester Mystery House).|$|E

500|$|In a {{motel room}} in Roswell, New Mexico, Mulder and Scully prepare for bed and talk. Mulder {{explains}} his belief [...] "that the dead are not lost to us. That they speak to us as part of something greater than us—greater than any alien force. And if you and I are powerless now, I want <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> we listen to what's speaking, it can give us the power to save ourselves." [...] Despite their slim chance for success, Mulder declares, [...] "Maybe there's hope." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{development}} of the Panama Canal led Los Angeles business leaders <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> modern port facilities could be built, the world's commercial fleet would descend on Los Angeles. [...] When the canal opened in August 1914, World War I had postponed the city's plans. [...] However, the city's Municipal Wharf No. 1 was nearly complete in 1914, and harbor officials next turned their attention {{the construction of a}} large bonded warehouse to handle the [...] "sea caravans" [...] that were expected to crowd the harbor {{at the end of the}} war.|$|E

Little Noely invited viewers to pick one of two boxes. We are led <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> the [...] "No Game" [...] box is picked the show will end. If the [...] "Game" [...] box is picked the name of the game shown in the box is played.|$|E

50|$|Tucker opposed {{granting}} {{title to}} land that was not in use; he argued that an individual should use land continually, in order to retain exclusive right <b>to</b> it. He <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> this practice were not followed, there was a 'land monopoly'.|$|R

"Mrs Null," [...] said Lawrence, [...] "I do {{not feel}} {{justified}} in speaking to a third person of these things, {{but this is a}} peculiar case, and, therefore, I assure you, and request you <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> me, <b>that</b> <b>if</b> Miss March shall now positively refuse me, I shall feel convinced that her affections are already occupied, and that I have no right to press my suit any longer." ...|$|R
2500|$|There {{is ample}} reason <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> {{the other two}} {{divisions}} had fought with the tenacity of Elbert’s command, things might have turned out differently, especially since General Andrew Williamson {{was on his way}} with 1200 men and General Griffith Rutherford was coming with 800 men to reinforce the army at Brier. [...] As it was, General Lincoln’s plan to win control of the South and bring the war to an end resulted in disaster. General Ashe was later accused of cowardice for leaving the field of battle while Elbert was still engaged, but since nothing could be proved, a court of inquiry found Ashe only guilty of gross neglect.|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} month, amid increasing criticism, the McDaniels rescinded {{the reward}} offer. [...] "Not {{only did it}} endanger the lives of divers who would risk going farther than they should," [...] said Sorenson, who was by then even more firmly convinced that their son had not died in the cave, [...] "it put {{all of our lives}} at risk because we have to go in to recover the bodies." [...] By that time the McDaniels had also come <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> he had not died in the cave, Ben had been murdered. A phone tip line they set up had not received any calls, and no one who had not yet said anything was likely to be further motivated to do so, they said. (Ben's father elaborated the following year that the family was told to rescind the reward while in the Vortex Spring area for exactly this reason).|$|E

5000|$|Much of {{the ending}} of the speech {{attempted}} to dispel complacency. Roosevelt laid out the situation, and then pointed out the flaws in United States isolationism. He mentioned that [...] "Some of us like <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> even <b>if</b> Great Britain falls, we are still safe, because of the broad expanse of the Atlantic and of the Pacific." [...] He refuted this by saying that modern technology had effectively reduced the distances across those oceans, allowing even for [...] "planes that could fly from the British Isles to New England and back again without refueling." ...|$|R

That was what all the boys said, and my boy {{believed}} it, though {{he had never heard}} of anybody that it happened <b>to.</b> He <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> you gave a chicken-cock burnt brandy it could lay eggs, and <b>that</b> <b>if</b> you gave a boy burnt brandy it would stop his growing. That was the way the circus-men got their dwarfs, and the India-rubber man kept himself limber by rubbing his joints with rattlesnake oil.|$|R
2500|$|Despite {{the large}} electoral victory, Olympio's {{policies}} caused significant problems {{for many of}} his supporters. His insistence on budget austerity aggravated unionist, farmers, and educated youth who sought jobs in the public sector. In addition, he clashed with the Catholic authority {{in the country and}} exacerbated tensions between the Ewe and other ethnic groups. As political difficulties increased, Olympio became increasingly authoritarian by locking up political prisoners and intimidating or shutting down opposition parties. According to Frederick Pedler [...] "He seems <b>to</b> have <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> he swept away the politicians he could rely upon the good sense of ordinary honest people." ...|$|R

50|$|Christians {{who believe}} in a cappella music today <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> in the Israelite worship {{assembly}} during Temple worship only the Priests of Levi sang, played, and offered animal sacrifices, whereas in the church era, all Christians are commanded to sing praises <b>to</b> God.

6000|$|Through ages {{in which}} the most arrogant and {{elaborate}} ideals of power and civilization held otherwise undisputed sway, {{the ideal of the}} perfect and healthy peasant did undoubtedly represent in some shape or form the conception that there was a dignity in simplicity and a dignity in labour. It was good for the ancient aristocrat, even if he could not attain to innocence and the wisdom of the earth, <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> these things were the secrets of the priesthood of the poor. It was good for him <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> even <b>if</b> heaven was not above him, heaven was below him. It was well that he should have amid all his flamboyant triumphs the never-extinguished sentiment that there was something better than his triumphs, the conception that 'there remaineth a rest.' ...|$|R

Following several weeks struggling to survive, the survivors decide to head <b>to</b> Savannah, <b>believing</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> they can find a boat, they can find safety away from the mainland. En route, Kenny and Lee are forced to euthanize Duck after being bitten by a walker, and Katjaa takes her own life later. Lee spends time teaching Clementine how to survive on her own in this new world. As they near Savannah, Clementine's walkie-talkie goes off, and an unknown man tells her to come to meet him at the hotel downtown, the same hotel her parents would have been at, where she will be safe after he kills Lee.|$|R

The five British vessels sailed on to China, where they arrived safely in early October.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} I propose a teleological account of epistemic reasons. In recent years, the main {{challenge}} for any such account {{has been to}} explicate {{a sense in which}} epistemic reasons depend on the value of epistemic properties. I argue that while epistemic reasons do not directly depend on the value of epistemic properties, they depend on a different class of reasons which are value based in a direct sense, namely reasons to form beliefs about certain propositions or subject matters. In short, S has an epistemic reason <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> p <b>if</b> and only if S is such <b>that</b> <b>if</b> S has reason to form a belief about p, then S ought <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> p. I then propose a teleological explanation of this relationship. It is also shown how the proposal can avoid various subsidiary objections commonly thought to riddle the teleological account...|$|R
