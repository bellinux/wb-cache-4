6000|$|The cold slime of {{the ditch}} covered his whole body; and, when the bell rang for study and the lines filed out of the playrooms, he felt the cold air of the {{corridor}} and staircase inside his clothes. He still tried to think what was the right answer. Was it right to kiss his mother or wrong to kiss his mother? What did <b>that</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>to</b> kiss? <b>You</b> put your face up like that to say good night and then his mother put her face down. That was to kiss. His mother put her lips on his cheek; her lips were soft and they wetted his cheek; and they made a tiny little noise: kiss. Why did people do that with their two faces? ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'We {{have to pay}} {{for this}} {{precious}} state of things with our health and our children's. Do you know the saying that the Frontier is hard on women and cattle? This isn't the frontier, but in some respects it's worse, because we have all the luxuries and appearances--the pretty glass and silver to put on the table. We have to dust, polish, and arrange 'em after we've done our housework. I don't suppose <b>that</b> <b>means</b> anything <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> but--try it for a month! We have no help. A Chinaman costs fifty or sixty dollars a month now. Our husbands can't always afford that. How old would you take me for? I'm not thirty. Well thank God, I stopped my sister coming out West. Oh yes, it's a fine country--for men.' ...|$|R
5000|$|... "It {{was based}} on this book by Ken Carey, The Starseed Transmissions, about a {{channeling}} experience he had. The whole chorus is about if {{you have had a}} channeling experience and during this experience you find something you believe and trying to convince everybody else is not always an easy task. I'm into a lot of meditating. My dad was Catholic and he tried to school me in that, but I never really agreed with him. I've always been interested in religion and the way it affects society. The Starseed thing is about going on a meditation journey and coming back with something tangible. Something you actually believe in. Something <b>that</b> <b>means</b> something <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> It is hard to convince people of my father's generation of anything other than the religious values instilled in them."

Does she, John?" ...|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Sveriges Radio Agnes said that {{the inspiration for the}} song came from a nightmare that she had one night, where she had [...] "fucked up everything" [...] regarding her relationship. She has also stated that [...] "This is the most emotional song I have ever written. When you write a song <b>that</b> <b>means</b> a lot <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> it becomes a part of yourself.

6000|$|And {{the tunes}} <b>that</b> <b>mean</b> so much <b>to</b> <b>you</b> alone-- [...] Common tunes {{that make you}} choke and blow your nose, [...] Vulgar tunes that bring the laugh that brings the groan-- [...] I can rip your very heartstrings out with those; [...] With the feasting, and the folly, and the fun-- [...] And the lying, and the lusting, and the drink, [...] And the merry play that drops you, when you're done, [...] To the {{thoughts}} that burn like irons if you think.|$|R
