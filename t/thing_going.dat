5|$|We made it {{very clear}} we were not doing another record for TVT. But they made it pretty clear they weren't ready to sell. So I felt like, well, I've finally got this <b>thing</b> <b>going</b> but it's dead. Flood and I had to record Broken under a {{different}} band name, because if TVT found out we were recording, they could confiscate all our shit and release it. Jimmy Iovine got involved with Interscope, and we kind of got slave-traded. It wasn't my doing. I didn't know anything about Interscope. And I was real pissed off at him at first because it was going from one bad situation to potentially another one. But Interscope went into it like they really wanted to know what I wanted. It was good, after I put my raving lunatic act on.|$|E

It takes a couple years off your life." [...] Lu, along with Robert Gibbs and several other Obama staffers, read Obama's manuscript for The Audacity of Hope and provided him with several editorial suggestions.|$|E
500|$|On 24 August 2010, Forster joined Celtic, {{originally}} on a season-long {{loan from}} Newcastle. Celtic manager Neil Lennon described Forster by saying, [...] "He's a big boy, he's come highly recommended, his age {{is the only}} <b>thing</b> <b>going</b> against him because otherwise he's all the qualities you look for." [...] He made his Celtic debut on 29 August 2010 away at Motherwell and kept a clean sheet as Celtic won 1–0. He {{then went on to}} play in every match of Celtic's season with the exception of two cup matches.|$|E

500|$|Recognizing Dylan's {{dissatisfaction with}} the {{progress}} of the recordings, producer Bob Johnston suggested that they move the sessions to Nashville. Johnston lived there and had extensive experience working with Nashville session musicians. He recalled how Dylan manager Albert Grossman, was hostile to the idea: [...] "Grossman {{came up to me and}} said 'If you ever mention Nashville to Dylan again, you're gone.' I said, 'What do you mean?' He said, 'You heard me. We got a <b>thing</b> <b>going</b> here'". Despite Grossman's opposition, Dylan agreed to Johnston's suggestion, and preparations were made to record the album at Columbia's A Studio on Nashville's Music Row in February 1966.|$|E
500|$|Due to the {{emergence}} of Héctor Sánchez, Whiteside did not expect to return to the Giants after 2012. [...] "I didn't really think I'd be back with the Giants. Love that team and love that organization. They've got a good <b>thing</b> <b>going</b> there. Good group of guys and I've enjoyed the time I've spent there." [...] On November 5, 2012, Whiteside was claimed off waivers by the New York Yankees, agreeing to terms with them on a one-year contract worth $625,000 in the Major Leagues and $200,000 in the Minors on November 26. [...] Just two days later, the Yankees designated Whiteside for assignment to make room for Andy Pettitte. On December 3, he was claimed off waivers by the Toronto Blue Jays.|$|E
500|$|In December 2005, Timberlake {{began working}} on his second album, FutureSex/LoveSounds, the {{follow-up}} to Justified (2002). Within three weeks, [...] "My Love" [...] {{was one of several}} songs that were recorded. In September 2006, Timberlake told Rolling Stone that the song was [...] "a hip-hop ballad" [...] and that the process of creating [...] "took two hours to imagine and execute". While promoting the album in an interview with MTV News, Timberlake revealed that {{the second half of the}} album (including [...] "My Love") focuses on anthems of love. In another interview, he revealed that [...] "My Love" [...] was a [...] "contradiction of sounds. You've got this operatic <b>thing</b> <b>going</b> on. If you take all the staccato sounds out, the essence of the song is it's a ballad, but the way the beat is inlaid underneath the vocals, it becomes a percussive ballad." ...|$|E

500|$|Sawa {{described}} {{his role as}} [...] "in the beginning, [...] was kinda loopy and cotter, and you know, probably not the most popular guy in school. I think {{he might have been}} a dork, you know, doing their stuff and they had their own <b>thing</b> <b>going</b> and they're after the two beautiful girls in school, but there's no chance of that happening. I guess after the plane goes down, his world completely changes". [...] "Devon has an every man quality that makes him accessible," [...] Wong said. [...] "He doesn't appear as if he's supremely self-assured. [...] He's more of a regular kid who can take on the complexities of the role and become a hero". Perry was amazed by Sawa's vulnerability in acting, describing him as [...] "a very distinctive actor. He's very loose and he's kind of a cut-up when he's not on camera, but the moment the camera's on, I'd never seen anybody to completely slide right through the moment".|$|E
500|$|Directed by Nick Marck, [...] "My Mother, the Fiend" [...] {{was written}} by Phil Klemmer and Dayna Lynne North. The episode marks Klemmer's eighth writing credit, the fifth and {{penultimate}} writing credit for North, and Marck's seventh directing credit. Despite being credited, Wallace (Percy Daggs III), Dick (Ryan Hansen), and Jackie (Tessa Thompson) do {{not appear in the}} episode. Among the episode's guest stars are Alyson Hannigan and Charisma Carpenter, who portray Trina Echolls and Kendall Casablancas, respectively. The two previously starred together in Buffy the Vampire Slayer, with Hannigan playing Willow Rosenberg and Carpenter portraying Cordelia Chase. Although the two characters had appeared previously, they had never shared a scene together. Jason Dohring, who portrays Logan, stated that he had a special connection with Hannigan on-set: [...] "We get together and just tease each other, she sucker-punches me. There's just a total, I don't know, we really have a sister-brother <b>thing</b> <b>going</b> on. I've never had that kind of connection with an actress before. It totally works." [...] Dohring also noted that Hannigan responded strongly to any spoilers that she was given during filming of the episode.|$|E
500|$|On May 11, 2011, Down {{announced}} on their Facebook page that they [...] "demoed {{a brand new}} tune." [...] Down played at Download Festival on Saturday 11 June 2011. They played alongside System of a Down, Avenged Sevenfold and Alice Cooper. Rex did not tour with Down during their spring 2011 shows. Crowbar bassist Pat Bruders filled in for Rex during those shows. [...] "Rex is not gonna be with us," [...] said Keenan. [...] "He's got things he needs to deal with, and we gave him an ultimatum and he's trying to work things out. We've got Pat (Bruders) from Crowbar playing bass, and he's ass-kickin' in the same way. He plays with his fingers—which is really cool; he's got the whole Geezer Butler <b>thing</b> <b>going</b> on." [...] When asked whether or not Brown was still considered {{a part of the}} band, Keenan was hopeful but hesitant: [...] "I don't know what to really say on that; he's not out of the band, but he's not playing with us live." [...] On June 22, 2011, Jimmy Bower announced that Rex Brown would not be returning to Down, and that Pat Bruders is his replacement.|$|E

500|$|The {{producers}} {{struggled to}} cast Jessie Bannon. Peter Lawrence ultimately chose Jesse Douglas, who he felt reflected Jessie's energy and intelligence—" [...] has immense energy, huge energy, {{and is the}} kind of woman who could do all the kind of things Jessie could do—you know, athletic, smart, so and so forth [...]" [...] Douglas impressed Lawrence with her active lifestyle, including ballet, equestrianism, and tennis. When asked about the character's inclusion, Douglas stated, [...] "I'd be bummed if I upset anybody. Jessie is pretty cool. It is not like she is a girl who is whining all the time. If anything, she is a really good springboard {{for the rest of the}} storyline." [...] Roth supported her, claiming that [...] "Jonny hasn't discovered girls yet but when he does Jessie would be the type of girl he'd like to be with... I think something will happen between them but right now Jess is his best friend." [...] H-B Chief Fred Seibert agreed, hinting that as adults [...] "there might be a Tracy/Hepburn <b>thing</b> <b>going</b> on."

500|$|Barkley is {{an outspoken}} {{supporter}} of gay rights. In 2006, he told Fox Sports: [...] "I'm a big advocate of gay marriage. If {{they want to}} get married, God bless them." [...] Speaking to Wolf Blitzer on CNN two years later, he said: [...] "Every time I hear the word 'conservative,' it makes me sick to my stomach, because they're really just fake Christians, as I call them. That's all they are. ... I think they want to be judge and jury. Like, I'm for gay marriage. It's none of my business if gay people want to get married. I'm pro-choice. And I think these Christians, first of all, they're not supposed to judge other people. But they're the most hypocritical judge of people we have in the country. And it bugs the hell out of me. They act like they're Christians. They're not forgiving at all." [...] During a 2011 Martin Luther King, Jr. Day double-header on TNT, Barkley responded to a statement made by Dr. King's daughter Bernice, by saying, [...] "People try to make it about black and white. [...] he talked about equality for every man, every woman. We have a <b>thing</b> <b>going</b> on now, people discriminating against homosexuality in this country. I love the homosexuality people. God bless the gay people. They are great people." ...|$|E
500|$|Ann Powers, in {{conversation}} with Billboard revealed that in trying to handle political issues and creating art, the musician {{did not want to}} compromise or keep silent. She notes that this method worked for The Clash, but that this was at a certain time and a certain place, that they benefited from being a band, and that audiences were more used to seeing men being confrontational. Conversely, Denise Sullivan writing in Keep on Pushing: Black Power Music from Blues to Hip-Hop (2011), noted that in contrast to other rock musicians, M.I.A. furthered the legacy of The Clash, [...] "creating a controversy while doing so". Critic Jon Dolan of Spin noted M.I.A. may be a [...] "confused revolutionary? brilliant provocateur?" [...] {{and one of the most}} polarising yet thrilling figures in pop music today. Sarahanna, writing in Impose magazine cited composer Igor Stravinsky in describing M.I.A.'s role as an artist who challenged the audience into breaking their mind from a conservative cycle of familiarity. Baron writing in the Village Voice felt that although M.I.A.'s bloodline, politics and grievance meant that she was more informed than most and gave her [...] "every right to be a partisan and were reason for caution," [...] he praised her efforts for leading thousands of American writers including himself to know of the situation in Sri Lanka as [...] "brilliant", noting her mainly humanitarian angle in her protesting of civilian casualties that had been vastly and disproportionately inflicted on Sri Lanka's Tamil minority and her courage in [...] "putting her success and fame on the line to use every opportunity and avenue possible to remind Americans and people around the globe of this conflict" [...] is pretty much the most admirable <b>thing</b> <b>going</b> in pop music.|$|E

Most often, they were applied on two-door hardtop or coupé models and in all types of vehicles, from economy {{compacts}} to luxury brands.

His intense vocals were what really set them apart from any of their hardcore contemporaries. Instead of [...] just the normal-typical hardcore brash screaming and pushing everything all in one verse, Alec {{had a way of}} making these minute blast songs almost melodic without compromising or losing any intensity.|$|E
2500|$|Now there's a weird <b>thing</b> <b>going</b> on. Partly {{proposed}} by {{a colleague of}} mine writing in The Nation, Christopher Hitchens. He is saying, somehow {{he seems to be}} saying, it is wrong to look at history, it is wrong to {{look at the history of}} the past century. You don't have to exonerate the appalling deeds of Osama bin Laden and his associates, if it be Osama bin Laden, to say who brought this down, who contributed to this, a number of factors. We have to look at history. For someone like Hitchens to attack Chomsky, as he's done in The Nation, saying he is somehow 'soft' on fascism because [...] tries to read history is an outrage – an absolute outrage.|$|E
2500|$|Executive Producer Santer said, [...] "With all {{the turmoil}} facing the Mitchells this year, {{it feels like}} a great time to bring back Sam, the {{original}} Mitchell sister. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank Kim Medcalf for her great work playing Sam Mitchell for three years and welcome Danniella back to pick up the baton once again." [...] In an interview with media website Digital Spy, Santer discussed the reasoning behind his decision to reintroduce Sam: [...] "What makes Sam interesting for me is that she's Ricky's first love and first wife. As Bianca and Ricky spend more time together [...] the inevitability of them at some point coming together increases. What's stopping them? Well, it's Sam. Sam and Ricky had a good <b>thing</b> <b>going</b> all those years ago. All Ricky ever gets off Bianca is indifference, whereas Sam - and who knows quite why - is less than indifferent towards him and it makes a nice change".|$|E
