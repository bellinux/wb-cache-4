5|$|Racism and {{antisemitism}} were basic {{tenets of}} the NSDAP and the Nazi regime. Nazi Germany's racial policy was based on <b>their</b> <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> {{the existence of a}} superior master race. The Nazis postulated the existence of a racial conflict between the Aryan master race and inferior races, particularly Jews, who were viewed as a mixed race that had infiltrated society and were responsible for the exploitation and repression of the Aryan race.|$|E
5|$|In 1810, Hogg {{went up to}} University College, Oxford, his father's alma mater. There he met {{and became}} friends with Percy Bysshe Shelley in October 1810. Hogg and Shelley often {{discussed}} literature and metaphysics, had a shared disdain for religion and Oxford society, and were united in <b>their</b> <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> free love and free thinking. Although Shelley's father initially feared that his son was being corrupted by Hogg's ideas, he was reassured {{when he learned that}} Hogg was from a respectable family.|$|E

5|$|The local Cathars held {{a special}} place in their {{religion}} for horses, especially through <b>their</b> <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> the transmigration of souls. There was also a belief in Pamiers that knights took their horses with them when they died. In the 12th century, the Cathar princess Esclarmonde of Foix climbed to the fortress of Château de Montségur {{on the back of a}} small, sure-footed black horse. In the 14th century, the same small black horses are mentioned as accompanying the armies of Gaston III, Count of Foix.|$|E
5|$|Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines {{takes place}} in four areas of 21st-century Los Angeles: Santa Monica, Hollywood, Downtown Los Angeles, and Chinatown. Set in the World of Darkness, the game depicts {{a world in which}} vampires, werewolves, demons, and other creatures shape human history. The vampires are bound by a code to {{maintain}} their secrecy (forbidding the use of vampiric abilities in front of humans) and avoid unnecessary killing (to preserve the vampire's last shreds of humanity). The vampires are divided into seven clans of the Camarilla, the vampire government, with distinctive traits and abilities. The Toreadors are the closest to humanity, with a passion for culture; the Ventrue are noble, powerful leaders; the Brujah are idealists who excel at fighting; the Malkavians are cursed with insanity, or blessed with insight; the Gangrel are loners, in sync with their animalistic nature; the secretive, untrustworthy Tremere wield blood magic; and the monstrous Nosferatu are condemned to a life in the shadows to avoid humanity. The clans are loosely united by <b>their</b> <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> the Camarilla's goals and opposition to the Sabbat: vampires who revel in their nature, embracing the beast within. The Anarchs are a faction of idealistic vampires opposed to the Camarilla's political structure, believing that power should be shared by all vampires.|$|E

25|$|Comparative mythology {{provides}} {{historical and}} cross-cultural perspectives for Jewish mythology. Both sources behind the Genesis creation narrative borrowed themes from Mesopotamian mythology, but adapted them to <b>their</b> <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> one God, establishing a monotheistic creation {{in opposition to}} the polytheistic creation myth of ancient Israel's neighbors.|$|E

25|$|Together with Narlikar, Hoyle {{developed}} a particle {{theory in the}} 1960s, the Hoyle–Narlikar theory of gravity. It made predictions that were roughly the same as Einstein's general relativity, but it incorporated Mach's Principle, which Einstein had tried but failed to incorporate in his theory. The Hoyle-Narlikar theory failed several tests, including consistency with the microwave background. It was motivated by <b>their</b> <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> the steady state model of the universe.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the mass}} media {{generally}} declared the March successful because of its high turnout, organizers were not confident that it would create change.

25|$|An extra-constitutional body {{called the}} 6-10 Office {{was created to}} lead the {{persecution}} of Falun Gong. The authorities mobilized the state media apparatus, judiciary, police, army, the education system, families and workplaces against the group. The campaign was driven by large-scale propaganda through television, newspaper, radio and Internet. There are reports of systematic torture, illegal imprisonment, forced labor, organ harvesting and abusive psychiatric measures, with the apparent aim of forcing practitioners to recant <b>their</b> <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> Falun Gong.|$|E
25|$|Explanations for {{the delayed}} {{presentation}} {{among women in}} Ghana have been traced to the cost of, and access to, and routine screening mammography. Furthermore, women with breast cancer in Ghana describe a feeling of hopelessness and helplessness, largely due to <b>their</b> <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> fatalism, which contributes to denial {{as a means of}} coping. Mayo et al. (2003) conclude, however, that lack of awareness may be a more critical variable than fatalism in explaining health care decisions among women in Ghana.|$|E
25|$|The Cathars' main heresy was <b>their</b> <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> dualism: {{the evil}} God created the materialistic {{world and the}} good God created the spiritual world. Therefore, Cathars preached poverty, chastity, modesty and all those values which in their view helped people to detach {{themselves}} from materialism. The Cathars presented a problem to feudal government by their attitude towards oaths, which they declared under no circumstances allowable. Therefore, considering the religious homogeneity of that age, heresy was an attack against social and political order, besides orthodoxy.|$|E

40|$|Belief {{polarization}} {{occurs when}} 2 people with opposing prior <b>beliefs</b> both strengthen <b>their</b> <b>beliefs</b> after observing the same data. Many authors have cited belief polarization {{as evidence of}} irrational behavior. We show, however, that some instances of polarization are consistent with a normative account of belief revision. Our analysis uses Bayesian networks to characterize different kinds of relationships between hypotheses and data, and distinguishes between cases in which normative reasoners with opposing beliefs should both strengthen <b>their</b> <b>beliefs,</b> cases <b>in</b> which both should weaken <b>their</b> <b>beliefs,</b> and cases <b>in</b> which one should strengthen and the other should weaken his or her belief. We apply our analysis to several previous studies of belief polarization and present a new experiment that suggests that people tend to update <b>their</b> <b>beliefs</b> <b>in</b> the directions predicted by our normative account...|$|R
