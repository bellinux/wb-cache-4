5|$|As {{culturally}} and religiously <b>tolerant</b> as the Parthians were, they adopted Greek as their official language, while Aramaic remained the lingua franca in the empire. The native Parthian language, Middle Persian, and Akkadian were also used.|$|E
5|$|Cuban iguanas reach sexual {{maturity}} {{at an age}} of two to three years. Males are gregarious when immature, but become more aggressive as they age, vigorously defending territories in competition for females. Females are more <b>tolerant</b> of each other, except after laying their eggs.|$|E
5|$|During {{his year}} of consulship in 519 {{relations}} with the East Roman Empire flourished and the Acacian schism between the Eastern and Western Christian churches was ended. Whilst Eutharic was nominally a statesman, politician and soldier of the Roman Empire, {{he was also an}} Arian, whose views clashed with the Catholic majority; as consul enforcing Theoderic's <b>tolerant</b> policy towards the Jewish people, he incurred resentment from the local Catholics, whose traditions were less than <b>tolerant.</b> Following disturbances in Ravenna, where Catholics burnt down a number of synagogues, Eutharic's siding with the Jewish people of Ravenna was reported with resentment in a fragmentary contemporary chronicle.|$|E
5|$|E. reichenbachii prefer {{full sun}} and require little water. They thrive in dry, well-drained, gravelly, clay, and loam soils, and near rock outcroppings. They are cold and heat <b>tolerant,</b> and grow well under glass. They are drought resistant, but {{susceptible}} to mealybugs and scale insects.|$|E
5|$|Genghis Khan, and the {{following}} Yuan Emperors in China forbade Islamic practices such as halal butchering and circumcision. This led Chinese Muslims to eventually take {{an active part in}} rebelling against the Mongols and installing the more <b>tolerant</b> Ming Dynasty.|$|E
5|$|Law {{enforcement}} at {{the county}} level, {{and to some degree}} at the state level, became notoriously <b>tolerant</b> of the illegal activities in Galveston, in no small part because of the prosperity they generated, and the bribery and influence peddled by the Maceos. The city police very early on became entirely complicit.|$|E
5|$|Nonbenzodiazepines are {{contraindicated}} during benzodiazepine withdrawal as {{they are}} cross <b>tolerant</b> with benzodiazepines and can induce dependence. Alcohol is also cross <b>tolerant</b> with benzodiazepines and more toxic and thus caution is needed to avoid replacing one dependence with another. During withdrawal, fluoroquinolone-based antibiotics are best avoided if possible; they displace benzodiazepines from their binding site and reduce GABA function and, thus, may aggravate withdrawal symptoms. Antipsychotics are not recommended for benzodiazepine withdrawal (or other CNS depressant withdrawal states) especially clozapine, olanzapine or low potency phenothiazines e.g. chlorpromazine as they lower the seizure threshold and can worsen withdrawal effects; if used extreme caution is required.|$|E
5|$|Peter brings Simpson {{home with}} him to meet the family, who are {{initially}} less <b>tolerant</b> of Simpson than Peter. Brian tries to tell Peter {{that he should not}} trust Simpson just because he idolized him as a child but Peter refuses.|$|E
5|$|Tasmanian forms {{have been}} shown to be frost <b>tolerant</b> at any time of year, which might explain some of their success in {{spreading}} and growing in different habitats around the island. This attribute might have allowed them to survive cold periods in Tasmania in the Pleistocene.|$|E
5|$|Watering - They {{are more}} <b>tolerant</b> of drought than many house plants, {{but can be}} damaged by both under- and over-watering. Keeping the growing medium just moist {{throughout}} the year avoids either extreme.|$|E
5|$|While {{some wild}} {{narcissi}} are specific {{in terms of}} their ecological requirements, most garden varieties are relatively <b>tolerant</b> of soil conditions, however very wet soils and clay soils may benefit from the addition of sand to improve drainage. The optimum soil is a neutral to slightly acid pH of 6.5–7.0.|$|E
5|$|Although Vainio {{himself did}} not consume alcohol, he was <b>tolerant</b> about others' alcohol use and could {{spend time with}} his friends even if they drank, keeping alcohol in his house in case his friends came over. He also began {{discussing}} the topic of drinking in his lyrics. Getting rid of his alcohol problem did not solve Vainio's domestic problems; he and Taina ended up divorcing.|$|E
5|$|Although many Pakistanis {{were silent}} about the {{operation}} against Lal Masjid, most {{agreed with the}} government's decision {{to use force to}} retake the complex. While hardliners have been able to stir up anger every time Musharraf moves against militants, most people have been <b>tolerant</b> and oppose the militants desire to impose their interpretation of Islamic law. Most residents of Islamabad agree that the raid restored local peace, despite fears of retaliation.|$|E
5|$|As a drought-deciduous {{succulent}} tree, B. rupestris adapts {{readily to}} cultivation and is <b>tolerant</b> {{of a range}} of soils and temperatures. It is a key component and emergent tree in the endangered central semi-evergreen vine thickets—also known as bottletree scrub—of the Queensland Brigalow Belt. Remnant trees are often left by farmers on cleared land for their value as shade and fodder trees.|$|E
5|$|By {{the latter}} part of the 16th-century Reformation, the Church had grown less <b>tolerant</b> of mystery plays. A {{performance}} in Chester in 1575 is the last recorded from the city until the 20th century, when the Chester cycle was revived under the supervision of Christopher Ede, as part of the city's Festival of Britain celebrations in June 1951. This production was received enthusiastically, and was repeated the following year; thereafter it became a regular feature and tourist attraction.|$|E
5|$|Danvers carrots. These {{have strong}} foliage and the roots are longer than Chantaney types, {{and they have}} a conical shape with a {{well-defined}} shoulder, tapering to a point. They are somewhat shorter than Imperator cultivars, but more <b>tolerant</b> of heavy soil conditions. Danvers cultivars store well and are used both fresh and for processing. They were developed in 1871 in Danvers, Massachusetts. Cultivars include 'Danvers Half Long' and 'Danvers 126'.|$|E
5|$|Ethnically, the Middle Colonies {{were more}} diverse {{than the other}} British colonial regions in North America and {{tended to be more}} {{socially}} <b>tolerant.</b> For example, in New York, any foreigner professing Christianity was awarded citizenship, leading to a more diverse populace. As a consequence, early German settlements in the Americas concentrated in the Middle Colonies region. Indentured servitude was especially common in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New York in the eighteenth century, though fewer worked in agriculture.|$|E
5|$|Gene flow is the {{exchange}} of genes between populations and between species. It can therefore {{be a source of}} variation that is new to a population or to a species. Gene flow can be caused by the movement of individuals between separate populations of organisms, as might be caused by the movement of mice between inland and coastal populations, or the movement of pollen between heavy metal <b>tolerant</b> and heavy metal sensitive populations of grasses.|$|E
5|$|Historians (List of Historians {{till now}} not found, hence cannot be trusted) claim that Hyder was {{extremely}} <b>tolerant</b> towards the Christians. According to historian Severine Silva, {{he followed the}} same policy of religious tolerance towards Christians as he had from the beginning, even though the Christians had revolted against him. The Second Anglo-Mysore War began in 1780 and led to Hyder's death on 7 December 1782, at Arcot. Afterwards the British recaptured the fort at Mangalore.|$|E
5|$|However, {{adaptation}} {{to climate change}} has been demonstrated in many cases. These are usually due to a shift in coral and zooxanthellae genotypes. These shifts in allele frequency have progressed toward more <b>tolerant</b> types of zooxanthellae. Scientists found that a certain scleractinian zooxanthella is becoming more common where sea temperature is high. Symbionts able to tolerate warmer water seem to photosynthesise more slowly, implying an evolutionary trade-off.|$|E
5|$|Isabella {{adopted a}} <b>tolerant</b> {{religious}} policy, enabling {{the spread of}} Calvinism, especially in Partium and Kolozsvár. In 1559 she started new negotiations with Ferdinand, proposing to renounce her son's title of king if Ferdinand would agree to marry one of his daughters to John Sigismund and to confirm John Sigismund's rule in the lands {{to the east of}} the Tisza. However, the dowager queen {{died at the age of}} 40 on 18September 1559.|$|E
5|$|Like most felines, the bobcat {{is largely}} solitary, but ranges often overlap. Unusual for cats, males are more <b>tolerant</b> of overlap, while females rarely wander into others' ranges. Given their smaller range sizes, {{two or more}} females may reside within a male's home range. When {{multiple}} territories overlap, a dominance hierarchy is often established, resulting in the exclusion of some transients from favored areas.|$|E
5|$|Sigismund's son Sigismund II Augustus (Zygmunt II August), a monarch of a {{much more}} <b>tolerant</b> attitude, {{guaranteed}} {{the freedom of the}} Lutheran religion practice in all of Royal Prussia by 1559. Besides Lutheranism, which, within the Polish Crown, ultimately found substantial following mainly in the cities of Royal Prussia and western Greater Poland, the teachings of the persecuted Anabaptists and Unitarians, and in Greater Poland the Czech Brothers, were met, at least among the szlachta, with a more sporadic response.|$|E
5|$|Soil {{contains}} organic material, {{but because}} of the likelihood of contamination by humic acid of more recent origin, {{it is very difficult to}} get satisfactory radiocarbon dates. It is preferable to sieve the soil for fragments of organic origin, and date the fragments with methods that are <b>tolerant</b> of small sample sizes.|$|E
5|$|Somewhere between 29 and 67 {{species are}} {{recognised}} in the genus, with estimates {{of as many as}} 100. Incomplete herbarium collections make it difficult to determine whether certain groups represent single species, or groups of similar species. Attalea species {{have a long history of}} human use, and include economically important sources of palm oil and fibre. Many species are fire <b>tolerant</b> and thrive in disturbed habitats. Their seeds are animal dispersed, including some which are thought to have been adapted for dispersal by now-extinct Pleistocene megafauna.|$|E
5|$|The {{civil war}} years of Matilda's life {{have been the}} subject of {{historical}} fiction. Matilda, Stephen and their supporters feature in Ellis Peters's historical detective series about Brother Cadfael, set between 1137 and 1145. Peters paints the Empress as proud and aloof, in contrast to Stephen, a <b>tolerant</b> man and a reasonable ruler. Matilda's martial reputation may also have contributed to Alfred, Lord Tennyson's decision to entitle his 1855 battle poem Maud.|$|E
5|$|The colour of C.maenas varies greatly, {{from green}} to brown, grey or red. This {{variation}} has a genetic component, but is {{largely due to}} local environmental factors. In particular, individuals which delay moulting become red–coloured rather than green. Red individuals are stronger and more aggressive, but are less <b>tolerant</b> of environmental stresses, such as low salinity or hypoxia. Juvenile crabs on average display greater patterning than adults.|$|E
5|$|The nymph is the {{dominant}} life history stage of the mayfly. Different insect species vary in their tolerance to water pollution, but in general, the larval stages of mayflies, stoneflies (Plecoptera) and caddis flies (Trichoptera) are susceptible {{to a number of}} pollutants including sewage, pesticides and industrial effluent. In general, mayflies are particularly sensitive to acidification, but tolerances vary, and certain species are exceptionally <b>tolerant</b> to heavy metal contamination and to low pH levels. Ephemerellidae are among the most <b>tolerant</b> groups and Siphlonuridae and Caenidae the least. The adverse effects on the insects of pollution may be either lethal or sub-lethal, in the latter case resulting in altered enzyme function, poor growth, changed behaviour or lack of reproductive success. As important parts of the food chain, pollution can cause knock-on effects to other organisms; a dearth of herbivorous nymphs can cause overgrowth of algae, and a scarcity of predacious nymphs can result in an over-abundance of their prey species. Fish that feed on mayfly nymphs that have bioaccumulated heavy metals are themselves at risk. Adult female mayflies find water by detecting the polarization of reflected light. They are easily fooled by other polished surfaces which can act as traps for swarming mayflies.|$|E
5|$|Zenobia was a cultured monarch and fostered an {{intellectual}} environment in her court, which {{was open to}} scholars and philosophers. She was <b>tolerant</b> toward her subjects, and protected religious minorities. The queen maintained a stable administration which governed a multicultural, multiethnic empire. Zenobia died after 274, and many tales have been recorded about her fate. Her rise and fall have inspired historians, artists and novelists, {{and she is a}} national hero in Syria.|$|E
5|$|After Arghun's death, he was {{followed}} {{in rapid succession}} by two brief and fairly ineffective leaders, one of whom only held power for a few months. Stability was restored when Arghun's son Ghazan took power in 1295, though to secure cooperation from other influential Mongols, he made a public conversion to Islam {{when he took the}} throne, marking a major turning point in the state religion of the Ilkhanate. Despite being an official Muslim, however, Ghazan remained <b>tolerant</b> of multiple religions, and worked to maintain good relations with his Christian vassal states such as Cilician Armenia and Georgia.|$|E
5|$|Although {{they were}} pagan, the Hungarians {{demonstrated}} a <b>tolerant</b> attitude towards Christians, Jews, and Muslims. The Byzantine Church {{was the first}} to successfully proselytize among their leaders: in 948 the horka, and around 952 the gyula, were baptized in Constantinople. In contrast, the grand prince Géza (c.970–997) received baptism according to the Latin rite. He erected fortresses and invited foreign warriors to develop a new army based on heavy cavalry. Géza also arranged the marriage of his son, Stephen, with Giselle of Bavaria, a princess from the family of the Holy Roman Emperors.|$|E
5|$|Boron is an {{essential}} plant nutrient, required primarily for maintaining the integrity of cell walls. However, high soil concentrations of greater than 1.0ppm lead to marginal and tip necrosis in leaves as well as poor overall growth performance. Levels as low as 0.8ppm produce these same symptoms in plants that are particularly sensitive to boron in the soil. Nearly all plants, even those somewhat <b>tolerant</b> of soil boron, will show at least some symptoms of boron toxicity when soil boron content is greater than 1.8ppm. When this content exceeds 2.0ppm, few plants will perform well and some may not survive.|$|E
5|$|Cacti {{are often}} grown in greenhouses, {{particularly}} in regions unsuited to {{the cultivation of}} cacti outdoors, such the northern parts of Europe and North America. Here, they may be kept in pots or grown in the ground. Cacti are also grown as houseplants, many being <b>tolerant</b> of the often dry atmosphere. Cacti in pots may be placed outside in the summer to ornament gardens or patios, and then kept under cover during the winter. Less drought-resistant epiphytes, such as epiphyllum hybrids, Schlumbergera (the Thanksgiving or Christmas cactus) and Hatiora (the Easter cactus), are widely cultivated as houseplants.|$|E
5|$|Chroniclers Richard of Devizes, William of Newburgh, Roger of Hoveden and Ralph de Diceto were {{generally}} unsympathetic to John's behaviour under Richard, but more <b>tolerant</b> {{of the earliest}} years of John's reign. Accounts of the middle and later years of his reign are limited to Gervase of Canterbury and Ralph of Coggeshall, neither of whom were satisfied with John's performance as king. His later negative reputation was established by two chroniclers writing after the king's death: Roger of Wendover and Matthew Paris. The latter claimed that John attempted to convert to Islam, {{but this is not}} believed by modern historians.|$|E
5|$|Deep dives {{should be}} made only after a gradual {{training}} to test the individual diver's sensitivity to increasing depths, with careful supervision and logging of reactions. Diving organizations such as Global Underwater Explorers (GUE) emphasize that such sessions are {{for the purpose of}} gaining experience in recognizing the onset symptoms of narcosis for an individual , which are somewhat more repeatable than for the average group of divers. Scientific evidence does not show that a diver can train to overcome any measure of narcosis at a given depth or become <b>tolerant</b> of it.|$|E
5|$|None of the {{varieties}} of Banksia sphaerocarpa are commonly seen in cultivation. They are difficult {{to grow in the}} wetter conditions of Australia's east coast. Trials with grafting have been very limited and results have been poor. Otherwise, they adapt well to gardens with good drainage, sandy soils and sunny aspects in drier and Mediterranean (winter moisture) climates, and are also frost <b>tolerant.</b> They are good bird-attracting plants, and flower when not much else is in flower. Seeds do not require any treatment prior to sowing, and take 20 to 48 days to germinate.|$|E
