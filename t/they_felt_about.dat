5|$|David Kaczynski {{had once}} admired and {{emulated}} his older brother, but had later {{decided to leave}} the survivalist lifestyle behind. He had received assurances from the FBI that he would remain anonymous and that his brother would not learn who had turned him in, but his identity was leaked to CBS News in early April 1996. CBS anchorman Dan Rather called FBI director Louis Freeh, who requested 24 hours before CBS broke the story on the evening news. The FBI scrambled to finish the search warrant and have it issued by a federal judge in Montana; afterwards, an internal leak investigation was conducted by the FBI, but the source of the leak was never identified. In 1996 the Evergreen Park Community High School was also placed on lockdown while FBI agents searched Kaczynski's school records. At the end of that school day, students were greeted by reporters asking how <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> <b>about</b> going to the same high school the Unabomber had attended. That night the news story was released to public.|$|E
5|$|While at Princeton, she got {{involved}} with the Third World Center (now known as the Carl A. Fields Center), an academic and cultural group that supported minority students, running their day care center, which also included after school tutoring. She challenged the teaching methodology for French because she felt {{that it should be}} more conversational. As part of her requirements for graduation, she wrote a thesis titled Princeton-Educated Blacks and the Black Community. She researched her thesis by sending a questionnaire to African American graduates, requesting they specify when and how comfortable they were with their race prior to their enrollment at Princeton and how <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> <b>about</b> it when they were a student and since then. Of the 400 alumni to whom she sent the survey, fewer than 90 responded, and her findings did not support her hope that the black alumni would still identify with the African American community, even though they had attended an elite university with all of the advantages that accrues to its graduates. She majored in sociology and minored in African American studies, graduating cum laude with a Bachelor of Arts in 1985.|$|E
25|$|Noten {{started the}} project with interviews, asking the taxi drivers how <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> <b>about</b> art, {{what they knew}} about MIMA and what they would like him, as an artist, to create for their cars. He {{received}} answers like 'I used to wear a ring for good luck', 'would like a girl on the hood', and 'I'm too busy for art'. These, sometimes puzzling, quotes were used on posters announcing the exhibition throughout the city.|$|E

500|$|Experience {{designer}} Bob Rogers and {{the design}} team BRC Imagination Arts, were commissioned to create the new post show experience entitled: [...] "The Assembly Experience." [...] The Assembly Experience is a walk-through environment, giving guest the illusion that {{they are on the}} floor of a vast automotive assembly plant. [...] Automotive doors, seats and engines glide overhead on assembly line chainveyors, while simulated automotive die-press caused the floor to [...] "rumble" [...] as each automotive part was pressed. [...] Video monitors provided real GM workers a chance to tell EPCOT visitors how <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> <b>about</b> their products and their work.|$|E
500|$|David Crane and Marta Kauffman began {{developing}} {{three new}} television pilots that would premiere in 1994 after their sitcom Family Album was cancelled by CBS in 1993. Kauffman and Crane decided to pitch the series about [...] "six {{people in their}} 20s making their way in Manhattan" [...] to NBC, since {{they thought it would}} fit best there. Crane and Kauffman presented the idea to their production partner Kevin Bright, who had served as executive producer on their HBO series Dream On. The idea for the series was conceived when Crane and Kauffman began thinking about the time when they had finished college and started living by themselves in New York; Kauffman believed they were looking {{at a time when the}} future was [...] "more of a question mark." [...] They found the concept to be interesting, as they believed [...] "everybody knows that feeling", and because it was also how <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> <b>about</b> their own lives at the time. The team titled the series Insomnia Cafe, and pitched the idea as a seven-page treatment to NBC in December 1993.|$|E
500|$|A {{music video}} {{was made by}} fashion film {{director}} Ruth Hogben in collaboration with West, who appears in a cameo in the video. The video was shot {{during the summer of}} 2011 during a two-day shoot. Hogben and West had brainstorming sessions deciding what the video was going to be conceptually, finally deciding something that would aesthetically fit the song the best. About collaborating with West, Hogben commented that the process was very organic and creative in nature, musing that the two went back and forth with ideas for visuals. The dancers in the video were not instructed to dance in any particular way by Yemi A.D. {{who was in charge of}} the dance choreography; and according to Ruth Hogben, they [...] "wanted an interpretation of how <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> <b>about</b> the song to be portrayed instead." [...] The video was eventually released May 4, 2012. The video was described as [...] "belated" [...] because it was premiered nearly a year and a half after the initial release of the album [...] "Lost in the World" [...] accompanies.|$|E
50|$|Supporters of the Act - {{members of}} the Liberals and the Democrats - argued that {{volunteer}} police would build upon the community policing practices implemented by the Government, would augment police {{in the event of}} an emergency, and would allow {{members of the}} public to contribute to a cause which <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> strongly <b>about.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In 1986 METRO was proposing an Edloe Street {{station of}} its [...] "station busway." [...] Paul Bay, the METRO {{assistant}} general manager for transit systems development, said that Sunset Terrace/Montclair residents said that <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> concerns <b>about</b> the visual effects of the proposed station and issues with noise and traffic. The station was never built.|$|R
5000|$|Parker and Stone briefly {{considered}} parodying Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight {{by having}} then-President George W. Bush gallantly {{take the blame}} for the Smithsonian heist. They decided against it, however, as <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> that jokes <b>about</b> President Bush had been [...] "done to death".|$|R
500|$|In {{terms of}} social policy, Bowlby advised that parents should be {{supported}} by society as parents are dependent on a greater society for economic provision and [...] "if a community values its children it must cherish its parents". Also [...] "husbandless" [...] mothers of children under 3 should be supported {{to care for the}} child at home rather than the child be left in inadequate care whilst the mother sought work. (It was assumed the mother of the illegitimate child would usually be left with the child). Fathers left with infants or small children on their hands without the mother should be provided with [...] "housekeepers" [...] so that the children could remain at home. Other proposals included the proper payment of foster homes and careful selection of foster carers, and frank, informative discussions with children about their parents and why they ended up in care and how <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> <b>about</b> it rather than the [...] "least said, soonest mended" [...] approach. The point that children were loyal to and loved even the worst of parents, and needed to have that fact understood non-judgementally, was strongly made.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{studies have}} {{analyzed}} the changing attitudes about sex that American adolescents have outside marriage. [...] Adolescents {{were asked how}} <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> <b>about</b> oral and vaginal sex {{in relation to their}} health, social, and emotional well-being. [...] Overall, teenagers felt that oral sex was viewed as more socially positive amongst their demographic. Results stated that teenagers believed that oral sex for dating and non-dating adolescents was less threatening to their overall values and beliefs than vaginal sex was. When asked, teenagers who participated in the research viewed oral sex as more acceptable to their peers, and their personal values than vaginal sex.|$|E
2500|$|In February1989, {{a student}} named [...] "Dread" [...] Scott Tyler draped the Flag of the United States {{across the floor}} for a piece titled What Is the Proper Way to Display a U.S. Flag? The piece {{consisted}} of a podium with a notebook for viewers to express how <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> <b>about</b> the exhibit. However, the podium was set upon a flag laid on the floor. In order for viewers to write in the notebook, they would have to walk on the flag. Viewers were occasionally arrested at the request of veterans. The school stood by the student's art in the face of protests and threats. That year, the school's federal funding was cut from $70,000 to $1 and many benefactors pulled donations.|$|E
50|$|Illness Bard, {{which was}} also {{composed}} by Liu Tianhua, reflects a kind of emotion of intellects. In 1920s, there {{were a part of}} intellects that held the feeling of disaffection. They pursued the light, tried to change current situation, although sometimes <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> confuse <b>about</b> the future of this land. When Jiang performed this solo, he made an apparent contrast among the four parts in tempo and dynamics. And it perfectly expresses the intellects’ emotions.|$|R
50|$|Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz came {{together}} {{and were able}} to create this soundtrack based on things <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> strongly <b>about</b> and found a way of expressing through music.

500|$|In October 1994, the Spice Girls began touring {{management}} {{agencies in}} order to present demos and dance routines. <b>They</b> <b>felt</b> insecure <b>about</b> {{the lack of a}} contract and were frustrated by the direction in which Heart Management was steering them. In November, the group persuaded their managers—father-and-son team Bob and Chris Herbert—to set up a showcase performance in front of industry writers, producers and A men at the Nomis Studios in Shepherd's Bush where they received an [...] "overwhelmingly positive" [...] reaction.|$|R
2500|$|Reeves and Nass {{designed}} {{an experiment}} in which 22 people come to a laboratory and told them they would be working with a computer to learn about random facts of American pop culture. At {{the end of the}} session they would ask them to evaluate the computer that they used. They would have to tell Reeves and Nass how <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> <b>about</b> that computer and how well it performed. 20 facts were presented in each session, and participants would answer if they knew “a great deal, somewhat, or very little” about the statement. After the session, participants were tested on the material and told which questions they had answered correctly or incorrectly. This computer, computer #1, then made a statement of its own performance, always stating that it “did a good job”.|$|E
2500|$|Some of Lady Avon's friends {{may have}} {{concealed}} their true views about Suez. For example, Isaiah Berlin assured [...] "dearest Clarissa" [...] that Eden had acted with [...] "great moral splendour", describing his stance as [...] "very brave", [...] "very patriotic" [...] and [...] "absolutely just", while opining to another acquaintance that his policy had been [...] "childish folly". Lady Avon herself recalled that, though she sought to [...] "bolster up" [...] {{her husband and}} scanned the newspapers for anything that she thought he ought to know, she did not feel she [...] "knew enough {{about what was going}} on to try and interfere in any way". Even so, her knowledge of the inner workings of Government was such that she was able to record in her diary the precise stance, at a critical point of the Suez operation, of every member of the Cabinet:ach was asked in turn what <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> <b>about</b> going on. Selwyn , Alec Home, Harold , Alan , Anthony Head, Peter , [...] Eccles, Duncan , James Stuart, Gwilym , and [...] Hailsham were for going on. [...] Kilmuir, [...] Heathcoat Amory, [...] Macloed, Bobbety , Patrick Buchan-Hepburn were for doing whatever Anthony wanted and Lord Selkirk was unintelligible.|$|E
2500|$|The {{atmosphere}} {{inside the}} house suddenly turned ugly when Dillon asked the teenagers what <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> <b>about</b> the LVF killing of UVF Mid-Ulster brigadier Richard Jameson, {{who had been a}} successful businessman and was extremely popular in the Portadown area. McIlwaine remained silent, however Robb had replied [...] "so fucking what, it's got fuck all to do with me" [...] which Dillon had taken exception to. When he informed Robb that Jameson had been his good friend, Robb had made further disparaging comments which also angered Brown. Brown, out of earshot of the teenagers, had decided to assault Robb in retaliation, saying he would [...] "punch the head off Andrew". Neither Robb nor McIlwaine {{had been a member of}} any loyalist paramilitary organisation, although Robb had tenuous links to the LVF having been an associate of Billy Wright, and even photographed in 1996 at a march led by Wright. Writers Henry McDonald and Ian S. Wood alleged that, unknown to the teenagers, a UVF unit had gone to [...] "The Spot" [...] to seek out two known LVF individuals rumoured to have been involved in Jameson's killing; however, they had already left the nightclub by the time the UVF arrived. The UVF men encountered Robb and McIlwaine instead, and targeted them as LVF members implicated in Jameson's death.|$|E
50|$|In April 1973, Mark Winstead {{came up with}} an {{idea for}} each member of the group to write a song <b>about</b> {{something}} <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> strongly <b>about.</b> His uncle owned a recording studio called Dark Horse in Franklin, Tennessee, and he offered the group a chance to record their songs free of charge after the spring semester was complete. The group jumped at the chance, and on May 14, 1973, they packed their gear into Tom Lewdowski's van and headed for Dark Horse Studios.|$|R

30|$|It {{should be}} noted though {{that none of the}} {{students}} used rubric during the performance assessment itself.

2500|$|Lynch got {{approval}} from Propaganda to switch projects; however, production {{was scheduled to}} begin {{two months after the}} rights had been purchased, forcing the director to work fast. He had Cage and Dern read Gifford's book and wrote a draft in a week. By Lynch's own admission, his first draft was [...] "depressing and pretty much devoid of happiness, and no one wanted to make it". Lynch did not like the ending in Gifford’s book where Sailor and Lula split up for good. For Lynch, [...] "it honestly didn’t seem real, considering the way <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> <b>about</b> each other. It didn’t seem one bit real! It had a certain coolness, but I couldn’t see it". It was at this point that the director's love of The Wizard of Oz (1939) began to influence the script he was writing and he included a reference to the [...] "yellow brick road". Lynch remembers, [...] "It was an awful tough world and there was something about Sailor being a rebel. But a rebel with a dream of the Wizard of Oz is kinda like a beautiful thing". Samuel Goldwyn, Jr. read an early draft of the screenplay and did not like Gifford’s ending either, so Lynch changed it. However, the director was worried that this change made the film too commercial, [...] "much more commercial to make a happy ending yet, if I had not changed it, so that people wouldn’t say I was trying to be commercial, I would have been untrue to what the material was saying".|$|E
2500|$|The {{suspended}} Sierra then {{contacted the}} American Civil Liberties Union, {{who agreed to}} take up her cause. The issue was considered settled after a meeting between Sierra, the ACLU, Sierra's mother and Mann, until {{a meeting of the}} school's board of education on October 29, the day of Sierra's return to school. The meeting discussed the events of the previous week, and some board members were initially sympathetic to Sierra. However, comments turned hostile {{towards the end of the}} meeting, with Sierra being told [...] "his isn't something funny or cute…ou're talking about overthrowing the government", and having her actions characterized as [...] "like you stood up and waved a Japanese flag on Pearl Harbor day". In reference to Sierra, president of the board Bill Raglin asked [...] "hat the hell is wrong with a kid like that?" [...] and board member John Luoni accused Sierra of committing treason. Sierra fled the meeting in tears. The following day, The Charleston Gazette published comments by Mann to the effect that the messages on Sierra's T-shirts included [...] "I hope Afghanistan wins" [...] and [...] "America should burn."; Mann later claimed he had been misquoted, and that he had taken his information from Jacob Reed. Students spat on Sierra's mother's car at Sissonville High, and her friends' parents wouldn't give her rides home from school. Threats, taunting, jeering by her fellow students escalated into physical assaults, and Sierra's mother pulled her out of school; the threats would ultimately cause Sierra to move out of the town. Sierra voiced her belief that people at Sissonville High were permitted to talk about how <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> <b>about</b> certain things, so long as there were others who agreed with them. She denied being anti-American, and that anarchism implies support for terrorism, countering that it is an anti-authoritarian and non-violent philosophy.|$|E
2500|$|Discipline was {{harsh and}} men could be {{executed}} for desertion, treason, cowardice, retreating without orders and ordering a retreat without orders. To maintain morale, {{the men were}} often entertained with films shown on outdoor screens together with musical troupes performing music, singing and dancing. The balalaika was often featured {{as part of the}} entertainment as it was considered to be a Russian “national instrument”. The position of the Soviet regime was that essentially sex did not exist and there were no references to matters sexual in any official publications. When the 16-year old partisan heroine Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya was hanged by the Germans on 29 November 1941, the photo of her corpse hanging from the gallows caused a sensation when published in early 1942 as she was topless, which ensured that the photo attracted much prurient interest. Unlike the German and French armies, the Red Army had no system of field brothels and the frontovik were not issued condoms as men in the British and American armies were. Venereal diseases were a major problem and those soldiers afflicted were harshly punished if discovered. The widespread rapes committed by the Red Army when entering Germany {{had little to do with}} sexual desire, but were instead acts of power, in the words of Rottman “the basest form of revenge and humiliation the soldiers could inflict on the Germans”. It was a common practice for officers to take “campaign wives” or PPZh (pokhodno-polevy zheny-“field marching wives”) as any women serving in the Red Army were told that they were now the mistresses of the officers regardless of what <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> <b>about</b> the matter or for the officers to “adopt” a civilian woman as their “campaign wife”, who often entered into the unit rosters so that they could receive pay. The [...] "campaign wives" [...] were often nurses, signallers and clerks who wore a black beret and despite being forced to become the concubines of the officers were widely hated by the frontoviks, who saw the [...] "campaign wives" [...] as trading sex for more favorable positions. The writer Vasily Grossman recorded typical remarks about the [...] "campaign wives" [...] in 1942: [...] "Where's the general?" [...] [...] "Sleeping with his whore." [...] And these girls had once wanted to be 'Tanya', or Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya." ...|$|E
5000|$|Evan Narcisse, Graeme McMillan and Douglas Wolk of Time magazine's Techland website {{found the}} book to be [...] "tepid", and stated that it failed to provide {{exposition}} for new readers, or to inform or intrigue readers as to the upcoming storyline, which <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> was emblematic <b>about</b> Marvel's [...] "insular" [...] approach to big event storylines.|$|R

Would they not cease to be, and eternal night {{come on the}} earth? They had heard dimly of the dark {{northern}} land, where it was always winter, and the night was six months long. Why should it not be so in their own land in some evil time? Every autumn the rains and frost came on; the leaves fell; the flowers withered; the birds fled southward, or died of hunger and cold; the cattle starved in the field; the very men had much ado to live. Why should not winter conquer at last, and shut up the sun, the God of light and warmth and life, for ever {{in the place of}} darkness, cold, and death? So thought the old Syrians of Canaan, and taught the Jewish women to weep, as they themselves wept every autumn, over Adonai, the Lord, which was another name for the sun, slain, as they thought, by the winter cold and rain: and then, when spring-time came, with its sunshine, flowers, and birds, rejoiced that the sun had come to life again.|$|E
