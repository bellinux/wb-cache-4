40|$|Monitoring systems give network administrators {{a better}} view and {{understanding}} of their networks. Amongst their many uses, {{they can be used}} to audit computing assets, profile resource usage, and pinpoint security problems. Current monitoring systems have not really explored the limits of monitoring scalability, preferring to focus on other important issues such as reliability and node discovery. We present a monitoring system that scale to over 100000 nodes. It has minimal local and global overhead, and maintains integrity in the face of transient network failure. Through a hierarchal organisation, our monitoring system can operate in multiple administrative zones. Since we did not have a large fleet of machines at our disposal, we simulated a large fleet of machines, upon which a smaller network of real machines was overlayed. This system was the <b>testbed</b> <b>for</b> our <b>scal...</b>|$|R
40|$|The optical conductivities {{of single}} {{crystals}} of ScAl 3, LuAl 3, and YbAl 3 were measured by spectroscopic ellipsometry {{in the energy}} range of 1. 5 – 5. 5 eV. The conductivity spectra of all show peaks between 1. 5 and 2. 0 eV originating from interband transitions. Two additional peaks around at 2. 9 and 4. 2 eV are observed <b>for</b> <b>ScAl</b> 3, and a weak shoulder is observed around at 2. 8 eV for LuAl 3. Band structure, density of states, and optical conductivity were calculated using the full-potential linear augmented plane wave method. The calculated conductivity spectrum <b>for</b> <b>ScAl</b> 3 shows peaks around at 2. 7 and 4. 3 eV. The distinctive feature of the optical conductivity <b>for</b> <b>ScAl</b> 3 comes from the extraordinary large Sc d unoccupied density of states compared to those of Yb d and Lu d. Oxidation effects on the optical properties of the sample were studied using a three-phase model.

40|$|Sc(AlxNi 1 -x) 2 is a pseudobinary C 14 Laves {{phase and}} a {{potential}} interstitial hydrogen storage material or anode in a Ni-MH battery. A previous study showed that Sc 1 Al 1 Ni 1 can store hydrogen reversibly; both interstitially and trough decomposition into ScH 2 and AlNi. It is also known that the exact composition {{is very important for}} the hydrogen storage properties of pseudobinary Laves phases. This thesis work is aimed at synthesising Sc(AlxNi 1 -x) 2 and study the effect of the Ni/Al ratio on the hydrogen absorption/desorption process as well as the interstitial storage capacity. Compositions with high nickel content had the highest capacity (at least 0. 67 wt% <b>for</b> <b>ScAl</b> 0. 66 Ni 1. 34) and ones with high aluminium content had the lowest total storage capacity (0 wt% <b>for</b> <b>ScAl</b> 1. 28 Ni 0. 62). The former composition was also shown to absorb and desorb hydrogen during multiple cycles.

The dierence-in-dierence methodology is used to establish causality. EU member states are classied as the treatment and non-EU OECD countries as the control group. The Maastricht treaty is interpreted as a quasi-experimental policy intervention that substantially advanced European integration.

We use a microfounded New Keynesian model of a monetary union which incorporates persistence in in?ation and non-Ricardian consumers, and derive optimal simple rules <b>for</b> ?<b>scal</b> authorities. We ?nd that ?scal policy {{can play an important}} role in reacting to in?ation, output and the terms of trade, but that not much is lost if national ?scal policy is restricted to react, on the one hand, to national di?erences in in?ation and, on the other hand, to either national di?erences in output or changes in the terms of trade. However, welfare is reduced if national ?scal policy responds only to output, ignoring in?ation. Optimal monetary and fiscal policies, Monetary union, Simple rules...|$|R

40|$|We {{lay out a}} {{tractable}} {{model for}} 8 ̆ 5 scal and monetary policy analysis in a currency union, and analyze its implications for the optimal design of such policies. Monetary policy is conducted by a common central bank, which sets the interest rate for the union as a whole. Fiscal policy is implemented at the country level, through the choice of government spending level. The model incorporates country-speci 8 ̆ 5 c shocks and nominal rigidities. Under our assump-tions, the optimal monetary policy requires that ination be stabilized at the union level. On the other hand, the relinquishment of an independent mone-tary policy, coupled with nominal price rigidities, generates a stabilization role <b>for</b> <b>scal</b> policy, one beyond the e ¢ cient provision of public goods. Interest-ingly, the stabilizing role for 8 ̆ 5 scal policy is shown to be desirable {{not only from the}} viewpoint of each individual country, but also from that of the union as a whole. In addition, our paper o¤ers some insights on two aspects of policy design in currency unions: (i) the conditions for equilibrium determinacy and (ii) the e¤ects of exogenous government spending variations...|$|R

Summary This paper outlines some of the implications of factor market integration <b>for</b> <b>scal</b> policy in the countries of the EU and for the EU itself. It draws particular attention to the dynamic dimensions of factor market integration, and identi es some of the many issues for further research on these topics. The past century has seen dramatic growth {{in the role of the}} public sector in the countries of Western Europe, both by extensive regulatory as well as scal interventions. By far the most important reason for the growth of public spending has been the increase in the level of redistributive (or social insurance) activities of governments. These include public pension systems and health care programs as well as a host of other policies. Tax policies also have the e ect of redistributing income among di erent groups. European economic integration, including prospective enlargement of the EU, contributes to the freer movement of factors of production, such as labor and capital, bot...|$|R
