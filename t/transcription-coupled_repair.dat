CSB belongs to the SWI 2 /SNF 2 ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler family, but {{the extent to which}} CSB remodels chromatin and whether this activity is utilized in DNA repair is unknown. Here, we show that CSB repositions nucleosomes in an ATP-dependent manner in vitro and that this activity is greatly enhanced by the NAP 1 -like histone chaperones, which we identify as new CSB-binding partners. By mapping functional domains and analyzing CSB derivatives, we demonstrate that chromatin remodeling by the combined activities of CSB and the NAP 1 -like chaperones is required for efficient <b>transcription-coupled</b> DNA <b>repair.</b> Moreover, we show that chromatin remodeling and repair protein recruitment mediated by CSB are separable activities.

40|$|Motor {{proteins}} that translocate on nucleic acids are {{key players in}} gene expression and maintenance. While the function of these proteins is diverse, they are driven by highly conserved core motor domains. In <b>transcription-coupled</b> DNA <b>repair,</b> motor activity serves to remove RNA polymerase stalled on damaged DNA, making the lesion accessible for repair. Structural and biochemical data on the bacterial transcription-repair coupling factor Mfd suggest that this enzyme undergoes large conformational changes from a dormant state to an active state upon substrate binding. Mfd can be functionally dissected into an N-terminal part instrumental in recruiting DNA repair proteins (domains 1 – 3, MfdN), and a C-terminal part harboring motor activity (domains 4 – 7, MfdC). We show that isolated MfdC has elevated ATPase and motor activities compared to the full length protein. While MfdN has large effects on MfdC activity and thermostability in cis, these effects are not observed in trans. The structure of MfdN is independent of interactions with MfdC, implying that MfdN acts as a clamp that restrains motions of the motor domains in the dormant state. We conclude that releasing MfdN:MfdC interactions serves as a central molecular switch that upregulates Mfd functions during <b>transcription-coupled</b> DNA <b>repair...</b>|$|R
50|$|DNA repair is {{the process}} by which all living cells deal with damage to their genetic material. Such damage occurs as a {{consequence}} of exposure to environmental radiations and genotoxic chemicals, but also to endogenous oxidations and the intrinsic instability of DNA. Hanawalt and his colleagues discovered a special pathway of excision repair, called <b>transcription-coupled</b> <b>repair,</b> which is targeted to expressed genes, and he studies several diseases characterized by defects in DNA repair pathways.

Mutations in these genes cause Cockayne Syndrome, which is characterized by early cessation of growth and development, leading to severe and progressive neurodysfunction associated with demyelination, sensorineural hearing loss, cataracts, cachexia, and frailty. The average lifespan of patients with the disease is 12 years. For CS Type II patients who have little neural growth after birth, the lifespan is significantly decreased to 7 years after birth. This condition can occur alongside xeroderma pigmentosum, resulting in xeroderma pigmentosum-cockayne syndrome (XP-CS).|$|E

40|$|UV-sensitive {{syndrome}} (UVsS) {{is a rare}} {{autosomal recessive}} disorder characterized by photosensitivity and mild freckling but without neurological abnormalities or skin tumors. UVsS cells show UV hypersensitivity and defective <b>transcription-coupled</b> DNA <b>repair</b> of UV damage. It was suggested that UVsS {{does not belong to}} any complementation groups of known photosensitive disorders such as xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne syndrome (CS). To identify the gene responsible for UVsS, we performed a microcell-mediated chromosome transfer based on the functional complementation of UV hypersensitivity. We found that one of the UVsS cell lines, UVs 1 KO, acquired UV resistance when human chromosome 10 was transferred. Because the gene responsible for CS group B (CSB), which involves neurological abnormalities and photosensitivity as well as a defect in <b>transcription-coupled</b> DNA <b>repair</b> of UV damage, is located on chromosome 10, we sequenced the CSB gene from UVs 1 KO and detected a homozygous null mutation. Our results indicate that previous complementation analysis of UVs 1 KO was erroneous. This finding was surprising because a null mutation of the CSB gene would be expected to result in CS features such as severe developmental and neurological abnormalities. On the other hand, no mutation in the CSB cDNA and a normal amount of CSB protein was detected in Kps 3, a UVsS cell line obtained from an unrelated patient, indicating genetic heterogeneity in UVsS. Possible explanations for the discrepancy in the genotype-phenotype relationship in UVs 1 KO are presented...|$|R

40|$|Living {{organisms are}} {{constantly}} {{exposed to a}} variety of naturally occurring and man-made chemical and physical agents that pose threats to health by causing cancer and other illnesses, as well as cell death. One mechanism by which these moieties can exert their toxic effects is by inducing modifications to the genome. Such changes in DNA often result in the formation of nucleotides not normally found in the double helix, bases containing covalent chemical alterations, single- and double-strand breaks, and interstrand and intrastrand cross-links. When these lesions are present during replication, mutations often result in the newly synthesized DNA. Likewise, when such damage occurs in a gene, transcription elongation, and hence expression, can be adversely affected because of pausing or arresting of the RNA polymerase at or near the altered site; this could result in the synthesis of a defective RNA molecule. It has become increasingly clear that transcription and DNA damage are intimately linked, since the removal of certain adducts from the genome is highly dependent on their location. When such lesions are present on the transcribed strand of actively expressed genetic loci, they are better cleared from that strand when compared to the complementary DNA or other quiescent regions. This process is called <b>transcription-coupled</b> DNA <b>repair,</b> and it modulates the mutagenic spectrum of many DNA-damaging agents. Furthermore, based upon evidence from systems in which it is absent, this process has a profound effect on ameliorating the adverse consequences of exposure to many environmentally relevant genotoxins. The precise cellular pathway that mediates the preferential clearance of DNA damage from active genetic loci has not yet been established, but it appears to be effected by a repertoire of proteins that are also involved in other DNA repair pathways and transcription as well as some factors that might be unique to it. Because a cellular process as indispensable as gene expression can be thwarted by the presence of DNA damage, an understanding of the mechanism underlying <b>transcription-coupled</b> DNA <b>repair</b> is relevant to the continued discernment of how environmental genotoxins endanger human health...|$|R
40|$|The {{nucleotide}} {{excision repair}} (NER) pathway {{is thought to}} consist of two subpathways: <b>transcription-coupled</b> <b>repair,</b> limited to the transcribed strand of active genes, and global genome repair for nontranscribed DNA strands. Recently we cloned the RAD 26 gene, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae homolog of human CSB/ERCC 6, a gene involved in <b>transcription-coupled</b> <b>repair</b> and the disorder Cockayne syndrome. This paper describes the analysis of yeast double mutants selectively affected in each NER subpathway. Although rad 26 disruption mutants are defective in <b>transcription-coupled</b> <b>repair,</b> they are not UV sensitive. However, double mutants of RAD 26 with the global genome repair determinants RAD 7 and RAD 16 appeared more UV sensitive than the single rad 7 or rad 16 mutants but not as sensitive as completely NER-deficient mutants. These findings unmask a role of RAD 26 and <b>transcription-coupled</b> <b>repair</b> in UV survival, indicate that <b>transcription-coupled</b> <b>repair</b> and global genome repair are partially overlapping, and provide evidence for a residual NER modality in the double mutants. Analysis of dimer removal from the active RPB 2 gene in the rad 7 / 16 rad 26 double mutants revealed (i) a contribution of the global genome repair factors Rad 7 p and Rad 16 p to repair of the transcribed strand, confirming the partial overlap between both NER subpathways, and (ii) residual repair specifically of the transcribed strand. To investigate the transcription dependence of this repair activity, strand-specific repair of the inducible GAL 7 gene was investigated. The template strand of this gene was repaired only under induced conditions, pointing to a role for transcription in the residual repair in the double mutants and suggesting that <b>transcription-coupled</b> <b>repair</b> can to some extent operate independently from Rad 26 p.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the contribution of}} the global and the transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair pathway to the removal of structurally different DNA lesions. The repair kinetics of UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and pyrimidine (6 - 4) pyrimidone photoproducts (6 - 4 PPs) were determined in an active and inactive gene in normal human fibroblasts and in xeroderma pigmentosum group C (XP-C) fibroblasts. Previously we have shown that in normal human cells exposed to a UV dose of 10 J/m 2 repair of CPDs takes place via two pathways: global repair and <b>transcription-coupled</b> <b>repair,</b> the latter being responsible for accelerated repair of CPDs in the transcribed strand of active genes. So far, no clear evidence for <b>transcription-coupled</b> <b>repair</b> of 6 - 4 PPs has been presented. Here we demonstrate that 6 - 4 PPs really form a target for <b>transcription-coupled</b> <b>repair.</b> In XP-C cells, exposed to 30 J/m 2 and only capable of performing <b>transcription-coupled</b> <b>repair,</b> CPDs as well as 6 - 4 PPs are removed selectively and with similar kinetics from the transcribed strand of the adenosine deaminase (ADA) gene. The non-transcribed strand of the ADA gene and the inactive 754 gene are hardly repaired. In contrast to XP-C cells, normal cells exposed to 30 J/m 2 lack strand-specific repair of both 6 - 4 PPs and CPDs, suggesting that <b>transcription-coupled</b> <b>repair</b> is overruled by global repair, probably due to severe inhibition of transcription at this high UV dose. The much more rapid repair of 6 - 4 PPs compared with CPDs in normal cells may be related to higher affinity of the global repair system for the former lesion. In XP-C cells the similarity of the rate of repair of both 6 - 4 PPs and CPDs in the transcribed strand at 30 J/m 2 indicates that <b>transcription-coupled</b> <b>repair</b> of photolesions takes place in a sequential way. Our results strongly suggest that the significance of <b>transcription-coupled</b> <b>repair</b> for removal of lesions depends on the type of lesion and on the dose employed...|$|E

Bacterial TCR additionally requires the Mfd protein, a DNA translocase that removes the stalled transcription complexes. We have determined the properties of Mfd, UvrA, and UvrB that are required for the elevated rate of repair observed during TCR.

In B cell hybridomas from mice with this κ transgene (P 5 ′C), both the VJ region and the C region, but not the region between them, were mutated at similar frequencies, suggesting that the mutation mechanism is related to transcription.

In fact, the levels of transcripts originating from the two promoters were similar, supporting a mutation model based on initiation of transcripts. Several “hotspots” of somatic mutation were noted, further demonstrating that this transgene has the hallmarks of somatic mutation of endogenous immunoglobulin genes.
