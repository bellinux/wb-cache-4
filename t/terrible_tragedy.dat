25|$|What is {{happening}} in your countries is a <b>terrible</b> <b>tragedy</b> that must end. During the African Synod, we, the pastors of the church, felt the duty to express our consternation and to launch an appeal for forgiveness and reconciliation. This {{is the only way}} to dissipate the threats of ethnocentrism that are hovering over Africa these days and that have so brutally touched Rwanda and Burundi.|$|E
25|$|Since the oil industry's {{earliest}} days, {{discovery and}} production have periodically taken a human toll. For Canada's petroleum industry, the worst incident was the Ocean Ranger disaster of 1982. In that <b>terrible</b> <b>tragedy</b> the Ocean Ranger, a semi-submersible offshore rig drilling the Hibernia J-34 delineation well, {{went down in}} a winter storm. The vessel took 84 hands into the frigid sea; none survived. This memory was fresh in everyone's mind when the field's production system was being negotiated.|$|E
25|$|A {{bright spot}} {{in the midst of}} the team's disappointing seasons came from a <b>terrible</b> <b>tragedy.</b> In February 2011, former Stingrays goaltender Kirk Daubenspeckwho played for the team from 1999 to 2006 and was part of the Kelly Cup {{championship}} team in 2001was in a near-fatal car accident that resulted in a traumatic brain injury that left him in a coma for six days. Friends, family members and former teammates from the Stingrays, the Hershey Bears, Culver Military Academy and the University of Wisconsin (Daubenspeck's alma maters) banded together to raise money to help defray the extensive medical bills. The team sold T-shirts bearing Daubenspeck's name and number (29) at the season's remaining home games. In April 2011, current and former Stingrays donned their skates and took to the ice for the team's first ever alumni game, held to benefit the Daubenspeck family. The event (held at the Carolina Ice Palace) drew a capacity crowd of over 700 and raised over $20,000 in ticket sales and from a post-game jersey auction. Daubenspeck and his family were in attendance, and Daubenspeck dropped the game's ceremonial first puck.|$|E

50|$|Gandhi {{also used}} the fasts as a penance, blaming himself for inciting Chauri Chaura and the {{divisive}} communal politics of both 1934 and 1947, especially the Partition of India. Gandhi sought to purify his soul and expiate his sins, in {{what he saw as}} his role in allowing <b>terrible</b> <b>tragedies</b> to happen. It took a heavy toll on his physical health and often brought him close to death.|$|R
5000|$|While applauding {{the tone}} and setting of the novel, some reviews cited the shallowness of the characterizations. The Guardian and Chicago Tribune reviews observe that Nella is drawn more like a worldly, feminist 21st-century girl than a naïve 17th-century one. The Chicago Tribune adds: [...] "main {{characters}} are complex and complicated and suffer <b>terrible</b> <b>tragedies,</b> but Burton doesn't give us a deep enough look into their psyches. I'd read 100 additional pages just to get inside Johannes' head".|$|R
500|$|Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film four stars, calling it [...] "one {{of the best}} films of the year, an unflinching lament for the human condition." [...] Janet Maslin, writing for The New York Times, said [...] "this fusion of Mr. Banks's and Mr. Egoyan's {{sensibilities}} stands as a particularly inspired mix" [...] and that Sarah Polley and Bruce Greenwood are [...] "particularly good here." [...] Brendan Kelly of Variety praised The Sweet Hereafter as [...] "Egoyan's most ambitious work to date," [...] and [...] "a rich, complex meditation {{on the impact of}} a <b>terrible</b> <b>tragedy</b> on a small town," [...] adding Polley and Tom McCamus are [...] "excellent." ...|$|E

60|$|She {{looked a}} very dainty picture of English rural life, {{and no wonder}} that the {{susceptible}} young Frenchman could scarce {{take his eyes off}} her pretty face. The Vicomte de Tournay was scarce nineteen, a beardless boy, on whom <b>terrible</b> <b>tragedies</b> which were being enacted in his own country had made but little impression. He was elegantly and even foppishly dressed, and once safely landed in England he was evidently ready to forget the horrors of the Revolution in the delights of English life.|$|R
2500|$|Wappel was {{the first}} {{declared}} candidate in the Liberal Party's 1990 leadership convention, announcing his candidacy on June 29, 1989. [...] He described himself as the only candidate willing to make abortion a leadership issue. [...] Wappel spoke against abortion in all circumstances, saying that while rape and incest are <b>terrible</b> <b>tragedies,</b> [...] "they cannot possibly be compounded by the further tragedy of destroying human life." [...] He also called for increased immigration to Canada and harsher penalties against drug traffickers, while opposing the Meech Lake Accord and [...] "distinct society" [...] status for Quebec.|$|R
5000|$|One of {{his most}} {{influential}} books, [...] "The Deluge", dealt with the transformations in British society {{brought about by the}} First World War. Published in 1965, its main thesis, a provocative one at the time, was that the war had brought about positive and lasting social changes (in the rôle of women, in the acceptability of state intervention for social reasons, and so on). Despite its <b>terrible</b> <b>tragedies,</b> Marwick believed that the sum result of the war was that Britain was a better place to live in the twenties than in the period before the war.|$|R
2500|$|Commonwealth of Nations – Secretary-General Don McKinnon said [...] "I {{hope that}} this <b>terrible</b> <b>tragedy</b> will make crystal clear the folly of {{violence}} {{and the importance of}} restraint and reconciliation as the only way of consolidating the democratic process.

5000|$|By {{the early}} 1930s, Hofmann {{had become an}} {{alcoholic}} but he retained exceptional pianistic command throughout this decade; Rudolf Serkin and a young Glenn Gould have recounted magical impressions created on them by Hofmann's concerts in mid-and-late 1930s. [...] After his departure from the Curtis Institute in 1938, a combination of his drinking, marital problems {{and a loss of}} interest in performing caused a rapid deterioration in his artistic abilities. Commenting on Hofmann's sharp decline, Sergei Rachmaninoff said, [...] "Hofmann is still sky high ... the greatest pianist alive if he is sober and in form. Otherwise, it is impossible to recognize the Hofmann of old". Oscar Levant wrote, [...] "one of the <b>terrible</b> <b>tragedies</b> of music was the disintegration of Josef Hofmann as an artist. In his latter days, he became an alcoholic. …His last public concert … was an ordeal for all of us".|$|R

2500|$|In March 2000 John PaulII visited Yad Vashem, the {{national}} Holocaust memorial in Israel, and later made history by touching {{one of the}} holiest sites in Judaism, the Western Wall in Jerusalem, placing a letter inside it (in which he prayed for forgiveness for the actions against Jews). In part of his address he said: [...] "I assure the Jewish people the Catholic Church … is deeply saddened by the hatred, acts of persecution and displays of anti-Semitism directed against the Jews by Christians {{at any time and}} in any place," [...] he added that there were [...] "no words strong enough to deplore the <b>terrible</b> <b>tragedy</b> of the Holocaust."

60|$|In {{this and}} {{succeeding}} chapters I purpose to exhibit and {{explain in detail}} our Lifeboats, and the great, the glorious work which they annually accomplish; also {{the operations of the}} life-saving Rocket, which has for many years rescued innumerable lives, where, from the nature of circumstances, Lifeboats could not have gone into action. I hold that we--especially those of us who dwell in the interior of our land--are not sufficiently alive to the deeds of daring, the thrilling incidents, the <b>terrible</b> <b>tragedies</b> and the magnificent rescues which are perpetually going on around our shores. We are not sufficiently impressed, perhaps, with the nationality of the work done by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, which manages our fleet of 270 lifeboats. We do not fully appreciate, it may be, the personal interest which we ourselves have in the great war, and the duty--to say nothing of privilege--which lies upon us to lend a helping hand in the good cause.|$|R
2500|$|Faustina was beatified on 18 April 1993 and canonized on 30 April 2000. Her feast day is 5 October. Divine Mercy Sunday {{is celebrated}} on the Second Sunday of Easter (which {{is the first}} Sunday after Easter Sunday). The fact that her Vatican {{biography}} directly quotes some of her reputed conversations with Jesus distinguishes her among the many reported visionaries. The author and priest Benedict Groeschel considers a modest estimate of the following of the Divine Mercy devotion in 2010 to be over one hundred million Catholics. Pope John Paul II said: [...] "The message she brought is the appropriate and incisive answer that God wanted to offer to the questions and expectations of human beings in our time, marked by <b>terrible</b> <b>tragedies.</b> Jesus said to Sr Faustina one day: 'Humanity will never find peace until it turns with trust to the Divine Mercy.'" [...] In October 2011, some cardinals and bishops sent a petition to Pope Benedict XVI that Faustina be made the fourth female doctor of the Church.|$|R
2500|$|Despite having {{voted for}} the motion, Conservative Member of Parliament Daniel Petit {{declared}} {{that there might be}} a link, as Wong suggested. [...] "I think that the billion (dollars) that we put in [...] should have been put into education and integration of immigrants in Montreal", Petit said. Dimitri Soudas, press attaché for Conservative Prime Minister Harper, said [...] "The comments of Mr. Petit are unacceptable, he should retract them and it does not reflect in any case the position of the government", adding that Petit was met by the Prime Minister's cabinet on the subject. MPs of the House of Commons criticized him for his statements, including Michel Gauthier, of the Bloc Québécois, and Denis Coderre, of the Liberal Party of Canada, who demanded apologies. He offered them promptly. [...] "I made inappropriate remarks," [...] Petit said in a statement. [...] "I withdraw them entirely because you cannot draw any link between the integration of immigrants in Quebec and the <b>terrible</b> <b>tragedy</b> at Dawson College." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another unusual aspect was the {{configuration}} of the third rail. Unlike other American commuter-rail agencies that operate trains powered by third rails, which have a contact shoe on top of their third rail, Metro-North trains' contact shoes draws current {{from the bottom of the}} third rail during operation. The Metro-North's under-running third rails are designed in order to prevent ice from building up on top during winter months and reduce the possibility of inadvertent contact with the high-voltage rail; as a consequence, the Metro-North third rails are much safer than the traditional over-running third rails. To facilitate this, the ends of the third rails adjacent to grade crossings have a slight upturn. [...] "This has never happened before, and this is a rare configuration of a third rail," [...] U.S. Senator Charles Schumer, said. [...] "Do those two add up to the explanation for this terrible, <b>terrible</b> <b>tragedy?</b> Very possibly." [...] But Steve Ditmeyer, a former Federal Railroad Administration official, told the Associated Press it would be impossible to be sure that an under-running shoe lifted the rail without also doing tests to see if the same thing would happen in the more common over-running configuration.|$|E

The <b>terrible</b> <b>tragedies</b> which befell the {{population}} of the Wynn Estate in the parish of Glenbeigh, in the 1880s is still talked about in the Glenbeigh area. The barbarity and brutality of Mr Roe, the agent for Lord Wynne, during the evictions were said to be far in excess of the worst actions of his master. Even Gladstones Land Act of 1881 which in effect said that tenants should no longer be removed at will, did little for the residents of the Wynn Estate, as during the years of 1882 and 1883 there were numerous evictions because the tenants were just not able to afford the increased rent, by a massive 50% in most cases, to pay for the construction of the castle. Not very long after this the affairs of Wynn drifted into insolvency and he made his exit from the Glenbeigh scene.While World War I was in progress the Castle and grounds were let to the British Military Command and used as a training centre for reservists. In 1921 Republican forces burned the castle to the ground and it was never rebuilt.|$|R
