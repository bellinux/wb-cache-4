5|$|The planar {{aromatic}} chromophore {{portion of}} <b>the</b> <b>molecule</b> intercalates between two base pairs of the DNA, while the six-membered daunosamine sugar {{sits in the}} minor groove and interacts with flanking base pairs immediately adjacent to the intercalation site, as evidenced by several crystal structures.|$|E
5|$|A {{group of}} {{antibodies}} {{can be called}} monovalent (or specific) if they have affinity for the same epitope, or for the same antigen (but potentially different epitopes on <b>the</b> <b>molecule),</b> or for the same strain of microorganism (but potentially different antigens on or in it). In contrast, a group of antibodies can be called polyvalent (or unspecific) if they have affinity for various antigens or microorganisms. Intravenous immunoglobulin, if not otherwise noted, consists of polyvalent IgG. In contrast, monoclonal antibodies are monovalent for the same epitope.|$|E
50|$|The spherical {{structure}} is {{induced by the}} protein's tertiary structure. <b>The</b> <b>molecule's</b> apolar (hydrophobic) amino acids are bounded towards <b>the</b> <b>molecule's</b> interior whereas polar (hydrophilic) amino acids are bound outwards, allowing dipole-dipole interactions with the solvent, which explains <b>the</b> <b>molecule's</b> solubility.|$|R
50|$|In general, the {{challenges}} of DNA replication involve the structure of <b>the</b> <b>molecules,</b> <b>the</b> chemistry of <b>the</b> <b>molecules,</b> and, from a systems perspective, the underlying relationships between the structure and the chemistry.|$|R
25|$|Liquid {{particles}} are bound firmly but not rigidly. They {{are able to}} move around one another freely, resulting in a limited degree of particle mobility. As the temperature increases, the increased vibrations of <b>the</b> <b>molecules</b> causes distances between <b>the</b> <b>molecules</b> to increase. When a liquid reaches its boiling point, the cohesive forces that bind <b>the</b> <b>molecules</b> closely together break, and the liquid changes to its gaseous state (unless superheating occurs). If the temperature is decreased, the distances between <b>the</b> <b>molecules</b> become smaller. When the liquid reaches its freezing point <b>the</b> <b>molecules</b> will usually lock into a very specific order, called crystallizing, and the bonds between them become more rigid, changing the liquid into its solid state (unless supercooling occurs).|$|R
5|$|As already described, chiral liquid-crystal {{molecules}} usually {{give rise}} to chiral mesophases. This means that <b>the</b> <b>molecule</b> must possess some form of asymmetry, usually a stereogenic center. An additional requirement is that the system not be racemic: a mixture of right- and left-handed molecules will cancel the chiral effect. Due to the cooperative nature of liquid crystal ordering, however, {{a small amount of}} chiral dopant in an otherwise achiral mesophase is often enough to select out one domain handedness, making the system overall chiral.|$|E
5|$|Covalent bonding {{takes place}} {{when one of}} the {{constituent}} atoms loses one or more electrons, with the other atom gaining the electrons, resulting in an electron cloud that is shared by <b>the</b> <b>molecule</b> as a whole. In both ionic and covalent bonding the location of the ions and electrons are constrained relative to each other, thereby resulting in the bond being characteristically brittle.|$|E
5|$|Doxorubicin is {{also known}} to be fluorescent. This has often been used to {{characterize}} doxorubicin concentrations, and has opened {{the possibility of using}} <b>the</b> <b>molecule</b> as a theranostic agent. However, there are significant limitations, as doxorubicin's fluorescence spectrum is known to depend on a variety of factors, including the pH of the environment, solvent dielectric constant and others. Doxorubicin fluorescence is quenched by binding to DNA, and shielded by micelle encapsulation. It {{is also known}} to self-quench at high concentrations. In contrast, histone binding amplifies fluorescence.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{distribution}} of <b>the</b> <b>molecules</b> by their kinetic energy is treated from statistical point of view.

25|$|In simple terms, {{electrophoresis}} is {{a process}} which enables <b>the</b> sorting of <b>molecules</b> based on size.

5|$|As noted above, {{variants}} that {{deviate from}} this template are known; what designates a Nazarov cyclization {{in particular is}} the generation of the pentadienyl cation followed by electrocyclic ring closure to an oxyallyl cation.

The propensity of the system to enter this conformation dramatically influences reaction rate, with α-substituted substrates having an increased population of the requisite conformer due to allylic strain. Coordination of an electron donating α-substituent by the catalyst can likewise increase the reaction rate by enforcing this conformation.|$|E

The metal-induced fluorescence was attributed to the lowering of the symmetry of <b>the</b> <b>molecules.</b> <b>The</b> metal-induced phosphorescence was attributed to the mixing of the singlet and triplet exciton states of <b>the</b> <b>molecules</b> by <b>the</b> spin-orbit interaction of <b>the</b> <b>molecules</b> with <b>the</b> metal atoms, and to the mixing of the singlet and triplet states by the virtual hopping of electrons between <b>the</b> excited <b>molecules</b> and <b>the</b> metal, both new mechanisms for turning on <b>the</b> phosphorescence of <b>molecules.</b>|$|R
40|$|We study a gas {{containing}} two components, a small component P {{and a large}} component Q. P is selectively {{heated to}} a high temperature and then returns to equilibrium via collisions with Q. This thermal equilibration process is analysed in a new way. We divide the kinetic energy space of <b>the</b> <b>molecules</b> of P into two regions F and D, and show that <b>the</b> <b>molecules</b> of P randomly switch (`oscillate') between the two states as time proceeds due to collisions with <b>the</b> <b>molecules</b> of Q. Initially, <b>the</b> <b>molecules</b> of P {{are all in the}} state D, however because each molecule in P collides with <b>the</b> <b>molecules</b> of Q at different times, the oscillations occur out of step with each other.
