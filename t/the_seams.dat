5|$|Bradford Colliery was a {{coal mine}} in Bradford, Manchester, England. Although {{part of the}} Manchester Coalfield, <b>the</b> <b>seams</b> of the Bradford Coalfield {{correspond}} more closely {{to those of the}} Oldham Coalfield. The Bradford Coalfield is crossed by a number of fault lines, principally the Bradford Fault, which was reactivated by mining activity in the mid-1960s.|$|E
5|$|For {{hundreds}} of years mining was an important industry for the area, {{and there were a}} number of mines in Midsomer Norton, e.g. Old Mills, Norton Hill, and Welton. However <b>the</b> <b>seams</b> were thin and with the hilly nature around, not easily worked. Generations of miners who worked in the difficult conditions of the local collieries are remembered at the Radstock Museum. The coming of the railways, particularly the Bath extension of the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway (S) in 1874, transformed the conveyance of coal out of the area.|$|E
5|$|ILC did {{not produce}} apparel for adults until the {{introduction}} of the Living Girdle in 1940, after patenting a method of manufacturing latex girdles that would not tear at <b>the</b> <b>seams</b> if they had a small tear or hole. The Living Girdle was advertised with images of mobility and comfort, such as women playing tennis or leaping while wearing it, though the solid rubber girdle was actually very uncomfortable.|$|E
50|$|There are {{at least}} six coal <b>seams</b> in <b>the</b> {{vicinity}} of the Carbondale Mine fire. <b>The</b> major <b>seams</b> in <b>the</b> area include <b>the</b> Grassy <b>seam,</b> <b>the</b> New County <b>seam,</b> <b>the</b> Clark <b>seam,</b> <b>the</b> Dunmore <b>Seam</b> #1, <b>the</b> Dunmore <b>Seam</b> #2, and <b>the</b> Dunmore <b>Seam</b> #3.|$|R
50|$|When {{making an}} outward-curved <b>seam,</b> <b>the</b> {{material}} will have reduced bulk and lie flat if notches are cut into <b>the</b> <b>seam</b> allowance. Alternatively, when making an inward-curved seam, clips are cut into <b>the</b> <b>seam</b> allowance to help <b>the</b> <b>seam</b> lie flat with reduced bulk in the fabric.|$|R
25|$|In {{order to}} achieve this effect, a seam bowler usually {{delivers}} the ball with <b>the</b> <b>seam</b> held upright, with rotation about a horizontal axis. This keeps <b>the</b> <b>seam</b> aligned vertically as it travels towards the batsman, making it likely that the ball will bounce with <b>the</b> <b>seam</b> on <b>the</b> pitch. Of course, consistently hitting <b>the</b> <b>seam</b> is {{not as easy as}} it sounds. <b>The</b> <b>seam</b> has to be held upright between the index finger and the middle finger {{at the time of the}} delivery of the ball and, most importantly, the wrist has to be dead straight when the ball is delivered. <b>The</b> <b>seam</b> and wrist position of Australia's Glenn McGrath are arguably a perfect example.|$|R
5|$|The present bridge {{dates from}} 1842. The bridge was {{constructed}} with a Town lattice, patented by Ithiel Town who {{is said to}} have supervised the construction of the bridge. If accurate, Town would have supervised the construction of the current bridge in the years preceding his death. The bridge has vertical planking and <b>the</b> <b>seams</b> are covered by battens and the roof of the structure has wood shingles. A lot of the joinery has been preserved, though the queen-post trusses around the Town lattices are not original.|$|E
5|$|The {{shell of}} Cloud Gate was fully erected {{for the grand}} opening of Millennium Park on July 15, 2004, {{although}} it was unpolished and thus unfinished, because its assembly had fallen behind schedule. The piece was temporarily uncovered on July 8 for the opening, although Kapoor was unhappy with this as it allowed the public to see the sculpture in an unfinished state. The original plan was to re-erect the tent around the sculpture for polishing on July 24, but public appreciation for the piece convinced park officials to leave it uncovered for several months. The tent was again erected in January 2005 as a 24-person crew from Ironworkers Local 63 polished <b>the</b> <b>seams</b> between each plate. In order to grind, sand and polish <b>the</b> <b>seams,</b> six levels of scaffolding were erected around {{the sides of the}} sculpture, while climbing ropes and harnesses were used to polish harder-to-reach areas. When the upper and side portions of the shell were completed, the tent was once again removed in August 2005. On October 3, the omphalos was closed off as workers polished the final section. Every weld on the Cloud Gate underwent a five-stage process, required to produce the sculpture's mirror-like finish.|$|E
5|$|After Kapoor's {{design for}} the {{sculpture}} was selected during a design competition, numerous technological concerns regarding the design's construction and assembly arose, in addition to concerns regarding the sculpture's upkeep and maintenance. Experts were consulted, some of whom believed the design could not be implemented. Eventually, a feasible method was found, but the sculpture's construction fell behind schedule. Cloud Gate was unveiled in an incomplete form during the Millennium Park grand opening celebration, as the grid of welds around each metal panel was still visible. The sculpture was concealed again while it was completed; in early 2005, workers polished out <b>the</b> <b>seams.</b> Cloud Gate was formally dedicated on May 15, 2006, and it has since gained considerable popularity, both domestically and internationally.|$|E

5|$|The {{pressure}} from the ice caused Endurance to start to take on water. To prevent the ship from flooding McNish built a cofferdam, caulking it with strips of blankets and nailing strips over <b>the</b> <b>seams,</b> standing for hours up to his waist in freezing water as he worked. He could not prevent the {{pressure from}} the ice crushing the ship though and was experienced enough {{to know when to}} stop trying. Once the ship had been destroyed he was put in charge of rescuing the stores from what had been The Ritz. With McNish in charge it took only a couple of hours to open the deck far enough to retrieve a good quantity of provisions.|$|E
5|$|Coal {{measures}} {{occur on}} the western and the eastern fringes of the Peak District, and evidence of past workings can be found from Glossop down to The Roaches, and from Stocksbridge to Baslow. The Coal measures on the eastern fringes of the Peak District form the South Yorkshire Coalfield while the Coal measures on the western fringes form the Lancashire Coalfield. Mining started in medieval times and was at its most productive in the 18th and early 19th centuries, in some cases continuing into the early 20th century. The earliest mining took place at and close to outcrops and miners eventually followed <b>the</b> <b>seams</b> deeper underground as the beds dipped beneath hillsides. At Goyt's Moss and Axe Edge, deep seams were worked and steam engines raised the coal and dewatered the mines. Coal from the eastern mines was used in lead smelting, and coal from the western mines for lime burning.|$|E
5|$|On , 1896 the leaking Sissoi Veliky reached Algiers. The captain {{planned to}} stay there for at least 20 days to {{complete}} the most urgent repairs, but five days later a telegram from Saint Petersburg forced him to leave for Piraeus. There the crew managed to seal <b>the</b> <b>seams</b> between the armour plates and repair the electrical systems. In February 1897 Sissoi Veliky steamed for Crete and she had her first gunnery exercise ten miles off the shore of Souda Bay, Crete {{at the end of}} the month. The second exercise, held on , ended in disaster when the rear turret exploded after an hour of target practice. The explosion blew the roof of the turret over the mainmast so that it struck the base of the foremast, crushing one 37mm gun and a steam cutter. The explosion killed 16 men and wounded another 15; 6 of these later died of their wounds. The badly damaged Sissoi Veliky headed to Toulon for repairs.|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} <b>the</b> welded <b>seam</b> between two plates is {{considered}} when an in-plane load {{is transmitted from}} one to the other. The shear stress distribution along <b>the</b> <b>seam</b> is studied in both cases, when <b>the</b> <b>seam</b> is open and when <b>the</b> <b>seam</b> is closed, and by two procedures, applying the traditional analysis and by means of finite element methods. This allows one to derive some interesting conclusions with respect to the convenience of closing <b>the</b> <b>seam</b> and with respect to the traditional calculation method.

5|$|On {{the other}} hand, Ekholm was {{skeptical of the}} balloon's ability to retain hydrogen, from his own measurements. His {{buoyancy}} checks {{in the summer of}} 1896, during the process of producing the hydrogen and pumping it into the balloon, convinced him that the balloon leaked too much to ever reach the Pole, let alone go on to Russia or Canada. The worst leakage came from the approximately eight million tiny stitching holes along <b>the</b> <b>seams,</b> which no amount of glued-on strips of silk or applications of special secret-formula varnish seemed to seal. The balloon was losing 68kilograms (150lb) of lift force a day. Taking into account its heavy load, Ekholm estimated that it would be able to stay airborne for 17 days at most, not 30. When {{it was time to go}} home, he warned Andrée that he would not take part in the next attempt, scheduled for summer 1897, unless a stronger, better-sealed balloon was bought.|$|E
5|$|The South Wales Coalfield {{produced}} the sought-after anthracite, bituminous and steam coals—the latter a grade {{between the two}} comprising a hard coal without the coking elements. Some of the region's coal seams contained high quantities of firedamp, a highly explosive gas consisting of methane and hydrogen, and were therefore prone to explosions; firedamp rises into the higher points of workings, including cavities or, as at Senghenydd, when <b>the</b> <b>seams</b> were being mined in an upward gradient. An additional danger of firedamp is afterdamp, a poisonous mixture of gases left after an explosion, primarily constituted of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and nitrogen. They combine with haemoglobin in the bloodstream to stop cells carrying oxygen, which can result in suffocation by lack of oxygen or anoxia. If survivors from an explosion are not rescued quickly, they face {{the possibility of being}} killed by the gas. The presence of firedamp contributed to a higher-than-average proportion of accidents: between 1880 and 1900 South Wales accounted for 18% of Britain's miners, but 48 per cent of all UK mining deaths occurred in the region. As coal output from British collieries reached its peak in 1913 there was a correspondingly large number of accidents around this time.|$|E
5|$|At 21:00, the British {{observed}} a {{fire on the}} lower decks of the Orient, the French flagship. Identifying the danger this posed to the Orient, Captain Hallowell directed his gun crews to fire their guns directly into the blaze. Sustained British gun fire spread the flames throughout the ship's stern and prevented all efforts to extinguish them. Within minutes the fire had ascended the rigging and set the vast sails alight. The nearest British ships, Swiftsure, Alexander, and Orion, all stopped firing, closed their gunports, and began edging away from the burning ship {{in anticipation of the}} detonation of the enormous ammunition supplies stored on board. In addition, they took crews away from the guns to form fire parties and to soak the sails and decks in seawater to help contain any resulting fires. Likewise the French ships Tonnant, Heureux, and Mercure all cut their anchor cables and drifted southwards away from the burning ship. At 22:00 the fire reached the magazines, and the Orient was destroyed by a massive explosion. The concussion of the blast was powerful enough to rip open <b>the</b> <b>seams</b> of the nearest ships, and flaming wreckage landed in a huge circle, much of it flying directly over the surrounding ships into the sea beyond. Falling wreckage started fires on Swiftsure, Alexander, and Franklin, although in each case teams of sailors with water buckets succeeded in extinguishing the flames, despite a secondary explosion on Franklin.|$|E
50|$|In a French <b>seam,</b> <b>the</b> {{raw edges}} of the fabric are fully {{enclosed}} for a neat finish. <b>The</b> <b>seam</b> is first sewn with wrong sides together, then <b>the</b> <b>seam</b> allowances are trimmed and pressed.

40|$|The elastic yarns and fabrics {{are gaining}} {{popularity}} in {{last few years}} {{all over the world}} because of their wearing comfort and functionality. The elastane ratio and the subsequent finishing processes influence the fabric mechanical properties and hence performance during sewing. In this paper an attempt has been made to investigate the effect of Lycra percentage, type of sewing thread and silicone finish on sewability of denim fabrics. <b>The</b> <b>seam</b> efficiency was found to be increased with Lycra percentage, while <b>the</b> <b>seam</b> pucker and needle damage were affected by the weights of the fabric rather than the Lycra percentage. <b>The</b> <b>seam</b> slippage does not show any trend with either of the Lycra percentage or fabric weight. The use of silicone finish reduces <b>the</b> <b>seam</b> efficiency, seam pucker and needle damage while <b>the</b> <b>seam</b> slippage is increased. The use of cores pun thread though helps to achieve higher <b>seam</b> efficiency; <b>the</b> <b>seam</b> pucker, seam slippage and needle damage is increased...|$|R
50|$|In use {{the blade}} is {{inserted}} into <b>the</b> <b>seam</b> underneath <b>the</b> thread to be cut.

25|$|Manufacturing {{processes}} mainly {{depend on}} the material of the shell. Most suit shells are currently assembled by stitching <b>the</b> <b>seams,</b> which {{in the case of}} neoprene suits are first butt-glued, and are then overlock stitched and waterproofed by glued seam tape. DUI use a liquid polyurethane sealing compound over <b>the</b> <b>seams</b> {{on the inside of the}} suit instead of tape, and the rubber-coated Viking suits are dipped and heat cured for a seamless waterproof layer. DUI crushed neoprene suit shells are assembled before crushing the bubbles by hydrostatic pressure, then adding seals, zippers and accessories.|$|E
25|$|A major {{challenge}} in dome construction {{is to make}} seams as invisible as possible. Painting a dome after installation is a major task and, if done properly, <b>the</b> <b>seams</b> can be made almost to disappear.|$|E

50|$|An outswinger is bowled {{by holding}} the cricket ball with <b>the</b> <b>seam</b> {{at an angle}} and the first two fingers running along either side of <b>the</b> <b>seam.</b> <b>The</b> ball must be {{released}} at 12 o'clock height. The hands should move slightly towards the left at follow through and must push down for more back-spin. Once the ball has worn on one side the shiny side should face the leg side and <b>the</b> <b>seam</b> towards first or second slip for swing. The difference of pressure caused by movement of air over the rough and smooth surfaces tends to push {{the ball to the}} left. The result is that the ball curves, or swings to the left. In case of a new ball point <b>the</b> <b>seam</b> to <b>the</b> direction of swing. The difference of the separation of air by <b>the</b> <b>seam</b> <b>the</b> ball moves away from the batsman.|$|R

25|$|Some {{acts that}} may alter the ball are permitted.

25|$|Despite finding {{neither the}} {{specific}} wires {{that caused the}} short circuit (the usual cause of arcing sounds and the likely cause of the breaker trips) nor the origin point of the fire that later consumed the plane, investigators determined that a short circuit likely sparked and ignited surrounding materials (such as insulation blankets) that sustained and propagated a fire behind {{the wall of the}} lavatory, with the plane's outer skin serving as a conduit for smoke to seep in through <b>the</b> <b>seams</b> in the interior panels and collect near the apex of the cabin.|$|E
50|$|Gas {{drainage}} {{is achieved}} by drilling boreholes into <b>the</b> <b>seam</b> in advance of mining. Gas liberated from <b>the</b> <b>seam</b> into <b>the</b> boreholes is transported out of the mine via a pipe range.|$|R
2500|$|<b>The</b> {{most famous}} <b>seam</b> in <b>the</b> South Yorkshire Coalfield was <b>the</b> Barnsley <b>seam</b> or bed. This seam which {{was up to}} 3 metres thick in places {{provided}} {{a significant amount of}} the coal produced by the coal field. <b>The</b> Barnsley <b>seam</b> coal properties varied through the depth of <b>the</b> <b>seam.</b> <b>The</b> top of <b>the</b> <b>seam</b> was a soft bright coal, the middle section known as the [...] "hards" [...] was a dull hard high quality coal suitable for raising steam. The bottoms was another band of bright soft coal called [...] "bottom softs".|$|R
30|$|Case history Mine A {{was located}} in the Book Cliffs region of central Utah (MSHA 1996). The massive Kenilworth {{sandstone}} formation lies 6 – 12  m above <b>the</b> <b>seam,</b> and <b>the</b> strata between it and <b>the</b> <b>seam</b> includes other strong siltstones and sandstones with typical strengths of about 100  MPa. Another massive sandstone, the Aberdeen, lies directly beneath <b>the</b> <b>seam.</b> <b>The</b> <b>seam</b> dip was 6 – 12 degrees, so each successive panel was about 40  m deeper than the previous one. Some mining had been conducted in a coal seam lying approximately 85  m above Mine A, {{but there were no}} noticeable stress transfers.|$|R
