40|$|AbstractThis {{research}} {{investigates the}} applications of a gyroscopic-like motion {{embedded in the}} attitude dynamics of a rigid-body that can be induced with an onboard <b>torque</b> <b>wheel.</b> The motion may be utilized by a rigid spacecraft to regain its attitude stability from a tumbling or a flat-spin situation to rotate about a designated principal axis, which parallels to the spin axis of the <b>torque</b> <b>wheel.</b> Also, the total angular momentum of the spacecraft remains conserved during the process as disturbance torques around the system in space are considered relatively very small and are ignored. To start the motion, the wheel is manipulated to rotate the spacecraft platform with reaction torque such that the projection of the total angular momentum falls in a proper quadrant on the plane perpendicular to the designated principal axis. Then, the projection is able to activate a self-induced, gyroscopic- like motion, which in effect transfers angular momentum to the wheel and the platform along the designated principal axis, aligning the designated principal axis with the total angular momentum and reducing the nutation angle between the two to zero. The phenomenon {{can be derived from}} the attitude model in terms of angular momentum. The control law of the wheel torque is formulated with the method of feedback linearization following the results from the Lyapunov stability analysis. Without any direct control effort, simulation results indicate that efficient time and energy can be achieved with effective attitude recovery of a spacecraft to any of the principal axis compared to the existing methods, and the wheel momentum accumulated during the motion can be predicted after the alignment maneuver...|$|E

Now that all the testing at Langley Research Center has been completed, a look back is warranted to evaluate the program. This paper describes some of the experiences and technology development studies by NASA, university, and industry investigators. Lessons learned are presented from three categories: the testbed development, control methods, and the operation of a guest investigator program. It is shown how structural safety margins provided a realistic environment to simulate on-orbit CSI research, even though they also reduced the research flexibility afforded to investigators. The limited dynamic coupling between the bending and torsion modes of the cantilevered test article resulted in highly successful SISO and MIMO controllers.

40|$|Large Space Structures do {{not have}} much damping, which necessitates the {{installation}} of a controller onto the structure. If the controller is improperly designed, the structure may become unstable and be destroyed. Since Large Space Structures are extremely expensive pieces of hardware, new controllers must not be tested first on the structure. They must first be tested in computer simulations. Until now, the usual procedure for simulating controlled Large Space Structures is to compute a reduced order modal representation of the structure and then apply the controller. However, this procedure entails modal truncation error. A new software package which is free from this error is currently under development within the Center for Space Construction. The more accurate finite element representation of the structure {{is used in the}} simulation, instead of the less accurate reduced order modal representation. This software also features an efficient matrix storage scheme, which effectively deals with the asymmetric system matrices which occur when control is added to the structure. Also, an integration algorithm was chosen so that the simulation is a reliable indicator of system stability or instability. The software package is fairly general in nature. Linearity of the finite element model and of the controller is the only assumption made. Actuator dynamics, sensor dynamics, noise, and disturbances can be handled by the package. In addition, output feedback of displacement, velocity, and/or acceleration signals can be simulated. Kalman state estimation was also implemented. This software was tested on a finite element model of a real Large Space Structure: The Mini-Mast Truss. Mini-Mast is a testbed at NASA-Langley which is currently under development.

40|$|AbstractBiodiesel fuel {{produced}} from palm oil is becoming cost competitive with fossil fuels {{due to the}} massive resource on Southeast Asia and biodegradable, and environmental friendliness over fossil fuels. The aim of this work was to seek and improve the palm biodiesel fuel blends as possibly high fraction for supplying diesel engine based on modified bio-fuels with bio-polymer additive. This investigation considered simultaneously about the engine performance, the reduction of gas exhaust emissions and also compliance with the main regulation standards of ASTM and SEA. The use of bio-polymer additive in palm biodiesel blends effects on engine performance and reduction of carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO 2) and nitric oxide (NOx) emissions. A chassis dynamometer used under the simulation of road load conditions with eddy current brake {{was used to measure}} engine brake power, engine <b>torque,</b> <b>wheel</b> power, and specific fuel consumption. Exhaust emission values were measured directly by sampling from exhaust pipe with a probe of the analyzers. The experimental results show that the B 40 blend with 0. 1 g bio-polymer additive the most effective improvement of properties included kinematic viscosity, specific gravity, flash point, and midpoint boiling temperature under criterion of ASTM D 445, ASTM D 1298, ASTM D 93, and ASTM D 86, respectively. Therefore, modified B 40 fuel is strongly possible to be an alternative fuel for a diesel engine. In the term of engine performance, average brake power and engine torque under engine speed tests from 1500 rpm to 4000 rpm slightly decreased by 2. 80 % and 2. 97 %, respectively as compared to B 2 reference test even though brake specific fuel consumption increased by 20. 46 %. However, it was found that gas exhaust emissions obviously decreased in diesel engine fuelled palm biodiesel blends additive. As compared to B 2 reference test, B 40 with 0. 1 g dosage obtains the great reduction in NOx, CO, and CO 2 emissions by 63. 17 %, 14. 33 %, and 53. 25 %, respectively under the engine speed at 3000 rpm.

40|$|In this thesis, an {{explicit}} time integration code which integrates multibody dynamics and the discrete element method {{is used for}} modeling the excavation and moving operation on cohesive soft soil (such as mud and snow) by bulldozers. A soft cohesive soil material model (that includes normal and tangential inter-particle force models) is used that can account for soil compressibility, plasticity, fracture, friction, viscosity, and gain in cohesive strength due to compression. In addition, a time relaxation sub-model for the soil plastic deformation and cohesive strength is added in order to account for loss in soil cohesive strength and reduced bulk density due to tension or removal of the compression. This is essential in earth moving applications since the soil that is dug typically becomes loose soil that has lower shear strength and lower bulk density (larger volume) than compacted soil. If the model {{does not account for}} loss of soil shear strength then the dug soil pile in front of the blade of a bulldozer will have an artificially high shear strength. A penalty technique is used to impose joint and normal contact constraints. An asperity-based friction model is used to model contact and joint friction. A Cartesian Eulerian grid contact search algorithm is used to allow fast contact detection between particles. A recursive bounding box contact search algorithm is used to allow fast contact detection between the particles and polygonal contact surfaces. ^ A multibody dynamics bulldozer model is created which includes the chassis/body, C-frame, blade, wheels, and hydraulic actuators. The components are modeled as rigid bodies and are connected using revolute and prismatic joints. Rotary actuators along with PD controllers are used to drive the wheels. Linear actuators along with PD controllers are used to drive the hydraulic actuators. Polygonal contact surfaces are defined for the tires and blade to model the interaction between the soil and the bulldozer. Simulations of a bulldozer performing typical shallow digging operations in a cohesive soil are presented. The simulation of a rear wheel drive bulldozer shows that, it has a limited digging capacity compared to the 4 -wheel drive bulldozer. The effect of the relaxation parameter can be easily observed from the variation in the Bulldozer 2 ̆ 7 s velocity. The higher the relaxation parameter, the higher is the bulldozer 2 ̆ 7 s velocity while it is crossing over the soil patch. For the low penetration depth run the bulldozer takes less time compared to high penetration depth. Also higher magnitudes of torques at front and rear wheels can be observed in case of high penetration depth. The model is used to predict the wheel <b>torque,</b> <b>wheel</b> speed, vehicle speed, and actuator forces during shallow digging operations on three types of soils and at two blade penetration depths. The model presented can be used to predict the motion, loads and, required actuators forces, and improve the design of the various bulldozer components such as the blade, tires, engine, and hydraulic actuators. ...|$|E

40|$|The continuous, precise {{modulation}} of {{the driving}} and braking <b>torque</b> of each <b>wheel</b> {{is considered to be}} the ultimate goal for controlling the performance of a vehicle in steady-state and transient conditions. To do so, dedicated torque-vectoring controllers which allow optimal <b>wheel</b> <b>torque</b> distribution under all possible driving conditions have to be developed.

The problem of the optimal individual <b>wheel</b> <b>torque</b> distribution for a particular driving condition can be solved through an optimization-based control allocation algorithm, which must rely on the appropriate selection of the objective function.
