5|$|Among the organisations that Playford {{belonged to}} was the local branch of <b>the</b> <b>Liberal</b> Federation, yet until the months {{preceding}} his eventual election, he never talked of holding political office. <b>The</b> <b>Liberal</b> Federation was considering a merger with the Country Party to avoid Labor retaining office during the Great Depression. Archie Cameron, an old wartime friend of Playford's {{and a federal}} Coalition MP, influenced Playford {{to run for office}} when he heard of the merger. In 1932 <b>the</b> <b>Liberal</b> and Country League (LCL) was created, and Playford ran for the multi-member constituency of Murray at the 1933 election.|$|E
5|$|At federal level, Hamersley {{is within}} the Division of Stirling, a {{marginal}} seat which historically has alternated between <b>the</b> <b>Liberal</b> Party and the Australian Labor Party. It has been held since 2004 by Michael Keenan of <b>the</b> <b>Liberal</b> Party. At polling place and subdivision level, Hamersley has supported <b>the</b> <b>Liberal</b> Party at every election since its first in 1972, the only exception being the 1983 election. In the 2001 election, the booth at East Hamersley Primary School was only won by <b>the</b> <b>Liberal</b> Party with a 0.3% two-party-preferred majority. Hamersley was in the Division of Cowan for elections held between 1984 and 1996.|$|E
5|$|Both House of Representatives seats {{have mostly}} been held by Labor, usually by {{comfortable}} margins. The Labor Party has polled {{at least seven}} percentage points more than <b>the</b> <b>Liberal</b> Party at every federal election since 1990, and their average lead since then has been 15 percentage points. The ALP and <b>the</b> <b>Liberal</b> Party have always held one Senate seat each.|$|E

50|$|The Conservatives {{replaced}} <b>the</b> <b>Liberals</b> as <b>the</b> major federalist {{party in}} Québec outside of Montreal, winning eight seats from the Bloc Québécois and two from <b>the</b> <b>Liberals.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Liberals</b> lost five Montreal-area seats and Gatineau to the Bloc.|$|R

5|$|During the {{election}} campaign, <b>the</b> <b>Liberal</b> leader was then-Prime Minister Paul Martin. After {{the election}} results were announced, Martin announced his intention to resign, but did not indicate when, other than saying he would not lead the party into the next election. On February 1, 2006, <b>the</b> <b>Liberal</b> Party Caucus chose Bill Graham as parliamentary leader, meaning he served as Leader of the Opposition in the House of Commons until the election of Stéphane Dion as Liberal leader at <b>the</b> <b>Liberal</b> Party leadership convention, held December 2–3, 2006.|$|E

5|$|Hastings {{first became}} {{involved}} in politics after the First World War, when he joined <b>the</b> <b>Liberal</b> Party to help improve social conditions for the poorer people of the United Kingdom. He was being prepared to be <b>the</b> <b>Liberal</b> candidate for Ilford in the 1918 general election but grew disheartened by <b>the</b> <b>Liberal</b> alliance with the Conservative Party, and also by the divisions in the party; as a result, he gave up the candidacy.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Liberals</b> {{had gained}} momentum, however, and the anti-CCF {{opposition}} coalesced around them, {{particularly in the}} face of events such as the Saskatchewan doctors' strike, which hurt the CCF's popularity. <b>The</b> Thatcher <b>Liberals</b> won a string of by-elections over the next three years. In the 1964 provincial election, <b>the</b> <b>Liberals</b> won a narrow victory, ending 20 years of CCF-NDP government. <b>The</b> <b>Liberals</b> were only 0.1% behind the CCF in the popular vote. However, a meltdown in Social Credit support allowed <b>the</b> <b>Liberals</b> to win a six-seat majority.|$|R
50|$|In {{the period}} {{following}} the constitutional amendment, liberalism was the dominant political {{force in the}} Netherlands. Liberalism also dominated the universities, the media and business. <b>The</b> <b>liberals</b> supported a laissez-faire economy, free trade, civil rights and a gradual expansion of suffrage. Thorbecke became Prime Minister of the Netherlands in 1849, and would serve two more terms throughout his lifetime. Because of their dominant position, <b>the</b> <b>liberals</b> did not deem it necessary to organise themselves in a political party. Instead there was a loose liberal parliamentary group and locally organised <b>liberal</b> caucuses. <b>The</b> <b>liberals</b> also did not organize their own pillar, a system of like-minded social organisations. <b>The</b> <b>liberals</b> were politically allied with the Catholics, whom <b>the</b> <b>liberals</b> granted considerable freedom of religion. After Thorbecke's death in 1872, <b>the</b> <b>liberals</b> grew increasingly disunited. By 1897, a division had emerged between the supporters of <b>the</b> progressive <b>liberal</b> Jan Kappeyne van de Coppello on the one side, and those of <b>the</b> conservative <b>liberal</b> Johan George Gleichman on the other.|$|R
5|$|Home Rule was the {{key issue}} in British {{politics}} in the late 1880s. The debate revolved around granting Ireland more powers to govern themselves. William Ewart Gladstone, <b>the</b> <b>Liberal</b> Prime Minister, proposed the First Home Rule Bill in April 1886, aiming to devolve power to Ireland. The Conservatives were opposed to the Bill, and were joined {{by a number of}} Liberal members in defeating the Bill. This caused a split in <b>the</b> <b>Liberal</b> party, the creation of <b>the</b> <b>Liberal</b> Unionist Party, and a fresh general election, just a year after the last. At the 1886 general election, the Conservatives entered government with Lord Salibsury as Prime Minister. They formed a majority with <b>the</b> <b>Liberal</b> Unionists.|$|E
5|$|Hon. Peter Milliken (<b>the</b> <b>Liberal</b> {{member for}} Kingston and the Islands) was re-elected Speaker of the Canadian House of Commons on April 3, 2006. He {{defeated}} Diane Marleau (<b>the</b> <b>Liberal</b> Member for Sudbury) and Marcel Proulx (<b>the</b> <b>Liberal</b> Member for Hull—Aylmer) {{on the first}} ballot, becoming only the third Speaker from an opposition party in history.|$|E
5|$|In 1832 the Tory Party {{evolved into}} the Conservative Party and in 1859 the Whig Party evolved, with Radicals and Peelites, into <b>the</b> <b>Liberal</b> Party. In {{opposition}} to Irish home rule, <b>the</b> <b>Liberal</b> Unionists ceded from the Liberals in 1886, aligning themselves with the Conservatives. The Labour Party was later founded, as the Labour Representation Committee, in 1900.|$|E
50|$|Twenty battleground ridings were in Ontario alone, and the Conservatives {{took the}} ridings of Brant, Oakville, Huron—Bruce and Halton from <b>the</b> <b>Liberals,</b> where <b>the</b> NDP took Thunder Bay—Superior North, Thunder Bay—Rainy River, Algoma—Manitoulin—Kapuskasing, Sudbury and Nickel Belt from <b>the</b> <b>Liberals.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Liberals</b> {{themselves}} lost 16 seats in Ontario.|$|R
50|$|Though {{they won}} the {{election}} with a slight deficit in the popular vote, upon taking office, <b>the</b> <b>Liberals</b> surged in popularity.

5000|$|Zumalacárregui then {{supported}} Ituralde, {{leaving only}} 2 or 3 battalions in observation; Zumalacárregui hastily marched {{to support his}} left wing under Ituralde. <b>The</b> <b>Liberals</b> had already compelled Ituralde to retreat. However, Zumalacárregui’s unexpected reinforcement threw <b>the</b> <b>Liberals</b> into disorder. [...] <b>The</b> <b>Liberals</b> gave way, falling back on their second line.|$|R
5|$|In February 2009, the Labour group {{resigned}} and <b>the</b> <b>Liberal</b> Democrats took {{office with a}} minority administration. In the 4 June 2009 council elections <b>the</b> <b>Liberal</b> Democrats gained four seats and, for the first time, overall control of the city council. In 2010 they increased their representation to 38 seats, giving them a majority of 6. In 2011 they lost their majority, leading to a hung council. In the 2013 local elections, in which {{a third of the}} city's wards were up for election, Labour gained 7seats and the Green party doubled their seats from 2to 4. <b>The</b> <b>Liberal</b> Democrats lost 10 seats.|$|E

50|$|The Progressive Conservatives gained {{several points}} in the popular vote, but made {{a net loss of}} two seats, with losses to the NDP {{partially}} countered by the PCs doubling their representation on MacDonald's native Cape Breton Island at the expense of <b>the</b> <b>Liberals.</b> <b>The</b> gap between <b>the</b> <b>Liberals</b> and NDP also significantly increased, in both the popular vote and seat count; while <b>the</b> <b>Liberals</b> and NDP had previously been nearly even, the NDP gained a significant advantage on <b>the</b> <b>Liberals</b> and moved into position as the primary opposition to the governing PCs.|$|R

5|$|Selfe's {{contempt}} for <b>the</b> <b>liberal</b> arts {{tradition and the}} priority he accorded practical skill have certain implications which cannot be commended.

Selfe may have lost a battle but before long, <b>the</b> <b>liberal</b> arts tradition faced still greater defeats. To these, Selfe certainly contributed, and what must be recognised {{is that in the}} vehemence of the struggle, and in the lauding of efficiency over culture, much that was valuable in <b>the</b> <b>liberal</b> arts tradition was lost.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Liberal</b> {{government}} introduced five-member block voting constituencies in Edmonton and Calgary in 1921, {{and briefly}} made Medicine Hat a double-member district.
