5|$|Remi {{developed}} {{a love of}} cinema, favouring Winsor McCay's Gertie the Dinosaur and the films of Charlie Chaplin, Harry Langdon and Buster Keaton; his later work in the comic strip medium displayed an obvious influence from them in style and content. Although not a keen reader, he enjoyed the novels of British and American authors, such as Huckleberry Finn, Treasure Island, Robinson Crusoe and The Pickwick Papers, {{as well as the}} novels of Frenchman Alexandre Dumas. Drawing as a hobby, he sketched out scenes from daily life along <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> school books. Some of these illustrations were of German soldiers, because his four years of primary schooling at the Ixelles Municipal School No. 3 coincided with the First World War, during which Brussels was occupied by the German army. In 1919, his secondary education began at the secular Place de Londres in Ixelles, but in 1920 he was moved to Saint-Boniface School, an institution controlled by the archbishop where the teachers were Roman Catholic priests. Remi proved a successful student, being awarded prizes for excellence. He completed his secondary education in July 1925 as the top of his class.|$|E
25|$|John's final {{campaign}} in France {{took place in}} 1378. He planned a 'great expedition' of mounted men in a large armada of ships to land at Brest and take control of Brittany. Not enough ships could be found to transport the horses, and the expedition was tasked with the more limited objective of capturing St. Malo. The English destroyed the shipping in St. Malo harbour and began to assault the town by land on 14 August, but John was soon hampered {{by the size of}} his army, which was unable to forage because French armies under Olivier de Clisson and Bertrand du Guesclin occupied the surrounding countryside, harrying <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> force. In September, the siege was simply abandoned and the army returned ingloriously to England. John of Gaunt received most of the blame for the debâcle.|$|E
25|$|Mumbai's innings began poorly as Mohit Sharma and Albie Morkel troubled their batsmen with {{straight}} deliveries. Both opening batsmen, Dwayne Smith and Aditya Tare, and Rohit Sharma lost their wickets {{within the first}} four overs for 16 runs. Dinesh Karthik and Ambati Rayudu attempted to build a partnership but also struggled and Karthik was dismissed after they added 36 runs. In came Kieron Pollard in the tenth over and immediately played aggressively. Pollard and Rayudu were able to score more freely against Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja to lift Mumbai to 100 for 4 after 15 overs. The following delivery, Rayudu fell to Dwayne Bravo for 37 runs and Mumbai was left with only Pollard and their bowlers. Harbhajan Singh briefly provided support for Pollard with boundaries coming from <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> bat before he fell to Bravo off a mishit. The remaining batsmen only made minimal contributions and most were dismissed by Bravo, who finished with figures of 4 for 42. Despite Pollard getting his third half-century of the season, Mumbai could only achieve a total of 148 for 9.|$|E

2500|$|Through his {{membership}} in a local Moose Club, Gacy became aware of a [...] "Jolly Joker" [...] clown club whose members—dressed as clowns—would regularly perform at fundraising events and parades in addition to voluntarily entertaining hospitalized children. By late 1975, Gacy had joined the Jolly Jokers and created his own performance characters: [...] "Pogo the Clown" [...] and [...] "Patches the Clown". Gacy designed his own costumes and taught himself how to apply clown makeup, although some professional clowns noted the sharp corners Gacy painted at <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> mouth are contrary to the rounded borders that professional clowns normally employ, {{so as not to}} scare children. Gacy is known to have performed as Pogo or Patches at numerous local parties, Democratic party functions, charitable events, and at children's hospitals. He is also known to have arrived, dressed in his clowning garb, at a favorite drinking venue named [...] "The Good Luck Lounge" [...] on several occasions with the explanation he had just performed as Pogo and was stopping for a social drink before heading home.|$|E

"It {{would be}} {{difficult}} to set about it otherwise than coolly with the thermometer thirty-five below zero," [...] remarked Fred, beating his hands together, and stamping his feet, while the breath issued from his mouth like dense clouds of steam, and fringed <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> hood and the breast of his jumper with hoar-frost.|$|E
60|$|During {{the contact}} of that {{unexpected}} and lingering kiss Mr Verloc, gripping {{with both hands}} <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> chair, preserved a hieratic immobility. When the pressure was removed he let go the chair, rose, and went to stand before the fireplace. He turned no longer {{his back to the}} room.

6000|$|We go {{into the}} cottage. It is a small {{building}} with four rooms and a kitchen on the ground floor, but {{in the sitting room}} we come upon an open fireplace,--the first I had ever seen, and in the light of it sits Grandfather McClintock, the glory of the flaming logs gilding <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> cloud of bushy white hair. He does not rise to greet us, but smiles and calls out, [...] "Come in! Come in! Draw a cheer. Sit ye down." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In {{personal}} appearance," [...] wrote Bartley in {{the sketch}} {{for which he}} now studied his subject, while he waited patiently for him to continue, [...] "Silas Lapham is a fine type of the successful American. He has a square, bold chin, only partially concealed by the short reddish-grey beard, growing to <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> firmly closing lips. His nose is short and straight; his forehead good, but broad rather than high; his eyes blue, and with a light in them that is kindly or sharp according to his mood. He is of medium height, and fills an average arm-chair with a solid bulk, which {{on the day of}} our interview was unpretentiously clad in a business suit of blue serge. His head droops somewhat from a short neck, which does not trouble itself to rise far from a pair of massive shoulders." ...|$|E
60|$|In the {{meantime}} the reader who has persevered {{so far is}} apt to go no further. The prejudice against 'wraiths' and 'ghosts' is very strong; but, then, our innocent phantasms are neither (as we understand their nature) ghosts nor wraiths. Kant broke <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> metaphysical tools against, not these phantasms, but the logically inconceivable entities which were at once material and non-material, at once 'spiritual' and 'space-filling.' There is no such difficulty about hallucinations, which, whatever else may be said about them, are familiar facts of experience. The only real objections are the statements that hallucinations are always morbid (which {{is no longer the}} universal belief of physiologists and psychologists), and that the alleged coincidences of a phantasm of a person with the unknown death of that person at a distance are 'pure flukes.' That is the question to which we recur later.|$|E

6000|$|I am {{well aware}} that the word [...] "property" [...] has been defied in our time by the {{corruption}} of the great capitalists. One would think, to hear people talk, that the Rothchilds and the Rockefellers were on the side of property. But obviously they are the enemies of property; because they are enemies of their own limitations. They do not want their own land; but other people's. When they remove their neighbor's landmark, they also remove their own. A man who loves a little triangular field ought to love it because it is triangular; anyone who destroys the shape, by giving him more land, is a thief who has stolen a triangle. A man with the true poetry of possession wishes to see the wall where his garden meets Smith's garden; the hedge where his farm touches Brown's. He cannot see the shape of his own land unless he sees <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> neighbor's. It is the negation of property that the Duke of Sutherland should have all the farms in one estate; just as it would be the negation of marriage if he had all our wives in one harem.|$|E
60|$|Our voices {{could not}} {{be heard in the}} tumult; Adrian however was eminent for the white charger he rode; spurring him, he dashed into the midst of the throng: he was recognized, and a loud cry raised for England and the Protector. The late adversaries, warmed to affection at the sight of him, joined in heedless confusion, and {{surrounded}} him; the women kissed his hands, and <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> garments; nay, his horse received tribute of their embraces; some wept their welcome; he appeared an angel of peace descended among them; and the only danger was, that his mortal nature would be demonstrated, by his suffocation from the kindness of his friends. His voice was at length heard, and obeyed; the crowd fell back; the chiefs alone rallied round him. I had seen Lord Raymond ride through his lines; his look of victory, and majestic mien obtained the respect and obedience of all: such was not the appearance or influence of Adrian. His slight figure, his fervent look, his gesture, more of deprecation than rule, were proofs that love, unmingled with fear, gave him dominion over the hearts of a multitude, who knew that he never flinched from danger, nor was actuated by other motives than care for the general welfare. No distinction was now visible between the two parties, late ready to shed each other's blood, for, though neither would submit to the other, they both yielded ready obedience to the Earl of Windsor.|$|E
60|$|The elderly Huguenot {{had stood}} silent after his repulse by the king, {{with his eyes}} cast moodily downwards, and a face in which doubt, sorrow, and anger contended for the mastery. He was a very large, gaunt man, raw-boned and haggard, with a wide forehead, a large, fleshy nose, and a {{powerful}} chin. He wore neither wig nor powder, but Nature had put her own silvering upon his thick grizzled locks, and the thousand puckers which clustered round <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> eyes, or drew {{at the corners of}} his mouth, gave a set gravity to his face which needed no device of the barber to increase it. Yet in spite of his mature years, the swift anger with which he had sprung up when the king refused his plaint, and the keen fiery glance which he had shot at the royal court as they filed past him with many a scornful smile and whispered gibe at his expense, all showed that he had still preserved something of the strength and of the spirit of his youth. He was dressed as became his rank, plainly and yet well, in a sad-coloured brown kersey coat with silver-plated buttons, knee-breeches of the same, and white woollen stockings, ending in broad-toed black leather shoes cut across with a great steel buckle. In one hand he carried his low felt hat, trimmed with gold edging, and in the other a little cylinder of paper containing a recital of his wrongs, which he had hoped to leave in the hands of the king's secretary.|$|E

60|$|But Megaleep the Wanderer {{makes no}} such {{provision}} he depends upon Mother Nature {{to take care}} of him. In summer he is brown, like the great tree trunks among which he moves unseen. Then the frog of his foot expands and grows spongy, so that he can cling to the mountain-side like a goat, or move silently over the dead leaves. In winter he becomes a soft gray, the better to fade into a snowstorm, or to stand concealed in plain sight on the edges of the gray, desolate barrens that he loves. Then the frog of his foot arches up out of the way; <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> hoof grow sharp and shell-like, so that he can travel over glare ice without slipping, and cut the crust to dig down for the moss upon which he feeds. The hoofs, moreover, are very large and deeply cleft, so as to spread widely when his weight is on them. When you first find his track in the snow, you rub your eyes, thinking that a huge ox must have passed that way. The dew-claws are also large, and the ankle joint so flexible that it lets them down upon the snow. So Megaleep has a kind of natural snowshoe with which he moves easily over the crust, and, except in very deep, soft snows, wanders at will, while other deer are prisoners in their yards. It is the snapping of these loose hoofs and ankle joints that makes the merry clacking sound as caribou run.|$|E
6000|$|Thus the [...] "Crossing the Brook," [...] {{and such}} other {{elaborate}} and large compositions, are actually painted in nothing but grey, brown, and blue, with a point {{or two of}} severe local color in the figures; but in the minor drawings, tender passages of complicated color occur not unfrequently in easy places; and even before the year 1800 he begins to introduce it with evident joyfulness and longing in his rude and simple studies, just as a child, {{if it could be}} supposed to govern itself by a fully developed intellect, would cautiously, but with infinite pleasure, add now and then a tiny dish of fruit or other dangerous luxury to the simple order of its daily fare. Thus, in the foregrounds of his most severe drawings, we not unfrequently find him indulging in the luxury of a peacock; and it is impossible to express the joyfulness with which he seems to design its graceful form, and deepen with soft pencilling the bloom of its blue, after he has worked through the stern detail of his almost colorless drawing. A rainbow is another of his most frequently permitted indulgences; and we find him very early allowing <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> evening clouds to be touched with soft rose-color or gold; while, whenever the hues of nature in anywise fall into his system, and can be caught without a dangerous departure from it, he instantly throws his whole soul into the faithful rendering of them. Thus the usual brown tones of his foreground become warmed into sudden vigor, and are varied and enhanced with indescribable delight, when he finds himself by the shore of a moorland stream, where they truly express the stain of its golden rocks, and the darkness of its clear, Cairngorm-like pools, and the usual serenity of his aërial blue is enriched into the softness and depth of the sapphire, when it can deepen the distant slumber of some Highland lake, or temper the gloomy shadows of the evening upon its hills.|$|E
