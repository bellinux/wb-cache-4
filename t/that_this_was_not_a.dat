5|$|The Mae Shi {{explained}} the group's inspiration {{to write the}} song in a statement. The group felt Bale's outburst was irrational and was motivated to write a piece about it. The Mae Shi emphasized in their statement <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> traditional song associated with their group's normal work, but rather a homage to Bale.|$|E
5|$|A CBC investigation, {{intended}} to test {{access to information}} following Bill 29, discovered that some departments and agencies were refusing to release previously available details about how much public employees take home above their base salaries. When the media was briefed on Bill 29 the-then Deputy Minister of Justice, Donald Burrage, said that {{the provisions of the}} act which enabled the public to see bonuses offered to public service employees had not been changed. Minister Hutchings confirmed that only the base salary, or a salary range, plus a range of possible bonuses, are now available. However, he said <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> change due to Bill 29 and that the information on salaries is only voluntary.|$|E
5|$|By the {{beginning}} of World War I, B3, B4, and B5 were at Dover and were deployed on a line between Calais and the Goodwin Sands to protect {{the passage of the}} British Expeditionary Force to France. Each submarine would sail from Dover before dawn to be secured at the buoy marking their billet at dawn, the idea being that {{they would be able to}} slip from the buoy when they spotted an enemy ship and manoeuvre to attack. <b>That</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> good tactic was proved when B3 narrowly avoided a torpedo from a German U-boat on the morning of 2 October. Nonetheless the scheme was successful and the BEF crossed to France without loss.|$|E

5|$|In Tan Liang Joo John, Justice Judith Prakash stated <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> closed list, {{and that}} the court is {{entitled}} {{to take into account}} all the circumstances of the case which in its view go towards showing bad faith. She also noted that English authorities impose another limit on the content of criticism – that the acts or words in question must neither impute improper motives to nor impugn the integrity, propriety and impartiality of judges or the courts. However, she declined to follow these authorities and averred that to impose such a limit would be unnecessary and potentially over-restrictive of legitimate criticism.|$|E
5|$|The {{attacks of}} 28 March were a {{continuation}} of the rapid advances that had so shattered the Fifth Army since the first days of the Spring Offensive. Prisoners of war taken by the 48th Battalion attested to the fact <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> set-piece assault, but merely an attack off the line of march. The 50th Reserve Division was in no state to renew the offensive on the following day, and 229 RIR was withdrawn from the line. It had suffered 309 casualties, with 230 RIR losing another 240.|$|E
5|$|At the time, {{very few}} people in Wales had seen an opera, {{and they had no}} idea what it was like. The opera {{programmes}} provided explanations, especially that the singers would wear costumes but would not be acting. Those who were members of Welsh nonconformist churches needed reassurance <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> theatrical performance, as acting and theatres were held in as much contempt as taverns. Parry was raised in the nonconformist Annibynwyr Chapel and adhered to the tenets of his faith for his entire life. The majority of participants in the first performance of Blodwen were music students of Parry; his two older sons were also part of the production, playing piano and harmonium. Before the performance, Parry spoke to the audience. He repeated what had been printed in the programmes: that the participants were not acting and explained to those gathered what an opera was. Despite this, there were some clergymen who were not pleased.|$|E

5|$|The conspirators practiced {{different}} ways of murdering Turner. According to informant statements to law enforcement, one of the conspirators was to pretend there was car trouble, and the others would then approach Turner with their guns. Informants later told law enforcement officials that the conspirators intended to hide out at an international network of Rajneesh communes if the plan was successful. According to The Oregonian the assassinations were not carried out because Ma Anand Sheela became distracted by political power plays within the Rajneesh commune {{and other members of}} the organization who were trying to remove her from her position within the group. And according to witness information, Ma Anand Sheela was persuaded not to carry out this action through conversations with Carol Matthews, who stated to her <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> solution in any way and would be a horrendous action.|$|E
5|$|With Soviet troops already {{stationed}} in the country according to the Mutual Assistance Treaty, {{it was impossible to}} mount effective military resistance. On June 15, Lithuania unconditionally accepted the ultimatum and lost its independence. The Soviets sought to show the world <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> military occupation and annexation, but a legitimate socialist revolution, initiated by the local population demanding to join the Soviet Union. Therefore, the Soviets followed semi-legal procedures: they took control of the government institutions, installed a new puppet government, and carried out show elections to the People's Seimas. During its first session, the Seimas proclaimed creation of the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic and petitioned to be admitted into the Soviet Union. The petition was officially accepted by the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union on August 3, 1940. At the same time almost identical processes took place in Latvia and Estonia. Lithuania would not regain its independence until the proclamation of the Act of the Re-Establishment of the State of Lithuania on March 11, 1990.|$|E

25|$|Two {{days after}} Venegas took office, Father Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla {{delivered}} the Grito de Dolores (the Cry from Dolores) and rose in rebellion.

25|$|The Navy {{dispatched}} two Nimitz-class supercarriers (the USS John C. Stennis and USS Dwight D.

The Navy maintained that the battle group was dispatched to the Persian Gulf before Iran detained the British sailors, and <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> show of force in response to Iran.|$|E
25|$|The initial French {{reaction}} to the island's fall was to tell the British they could keep it if they wanted, but could expect no compensation if they handed it back. It was soon realised <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> plausible stance, as the island {{could be used as}} a base for privateers and the Royal Navy. Ultimately after two years of occupation the island was handed back to France in the wake of the Treaty of Paris (1763), exchanged directly for the return of Menorca to Britain.|$|E

25|$|Another {{approach}} is to use speech recognition software.

25|$|On May 15, Pat Burrell was {{designated}} for assignment after another struggling {{start to the}} season. He would later clear waivers and become a free agent. The Rays called up Hank Blalock to replace him on the roster. Blalock's minor league contract included an out clause that his agent Scott Boras stated he would activate within the next week, which would force the Rays to either promote him or let him become a free agent. However Andrew Friedman, Executive Vice President of the Rays, said <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> factor {{in the decision to}} bring him up.|$|E
25|$|French {{threatened}} resignation unless his aide de camp Major Algy Lawson, {{who had not}} attended Staff College, {{was appointed}} Brigade-Major of the 1st Cavalry Brigade. He suspected a War Office plot led by the rising staff officers Henry Rawlinson and Henry Wilson, whom at this stage he distrusted. Despite being advised by Esher <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> sufficiently serious matter to justify such obstinacy, French got his way (December 1904) by threatening {{to appeal to the}} King. He also got his way over a similar matter involving Esher’s son Lt Maurice Brett, who served as French’s ADC, and on this occasion did approach the King’s secretary (February 1905).|$|E

25|$|After {{ordering}} his {{engineers to}} begin rebuilding the bridge, Jackson directed Col. Thomas T. Munford's 2nd Virginia Cavalry {{to cross the}} swamp and capture some of the Union guns abandoned during the bombardment. As the men and horses waded through water that was belly deep and fouled with debris, Jackson and Maj. Gen. D.H. Hill crossed the river to perform a personal reconnaissance. A Union artillery shell exploded {{only a few feet}} away from the generals mounted on horseback, although neither was injured. Jackson saw that Union artillery and infantry was reinforcing the position, and that Federal sharpshooters would play havoc with his engineers on the bridge. He realized <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> place that he could make an opposed crossing.|$|E
25|$|After test screenings, it {{was decided}} to re-shoot Captain Kirk's death. Originally, Kirk was shot and killed by Doctor Soran, but it was felt by the test {{audience}} <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> fitting death for such an iconic character. The re-shoot changed the manner of his death, so that instead, he sacrifices himself by leaping across a broken walkway to retrieve Soran's control pad and de-cloak the trilithium warhead. As the production crew had already spent weeks removing traces of their shoot from the Valley of Fire, the set had to be rebuilt under a very tight schedule, followed by effects work to remove wires and rigging in time for the footage {{to be included in the}} final cut.|$|E
25|$|According to Goenner, the {{contributions}} to the book are a mixture of mathematical–physical incompetence, hubris, and {{the feelings of the}} critics of being suppressed by contemporary physicists advocating for the new theory. The compilation of the authors show, Goenner continues, <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> reaction within the physics community—only one physicist (Karl Strehl) and three mathematicians (Jean-Marie Le Roux, Emanuel Lasker and Hjalmar Mellin) were present—but a reaction of an inadequately educated academic citizenship, which didn't {{know what to do with}} relativity. As regards the average age of the authors: 57% were substantially older than Einstein, one third was around the same age, and only two persons were substantially younger. Two authors (Reuterdahl, von Mitis) were antisemitic and four others were possibly connected to the Nazi movement. On the other hand, no antisemitic expression can be found in the book, and it also included contributions of some authors of Jewish ancestry (Salomo Friedländer, Ludwig Goldschmidt, Hans Israel, Emanuel Lasker, Oskar Kraus, Menyhért Palágyi).|$|E
