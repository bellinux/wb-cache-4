25|$|The Rev. Mr. Leslie, of Castlebellingham, who {{threatened}} the Gaelic league with his wrath for daring {{to hold a}} Feis on Sunday, has, we regret to say, found an imitator in a Catholic clergyman {{at the other side}} of Ireland – the Rev. Father Donor, of Shanagolden. <b>This</b> <b>gentleman</b> acted similarly towards the Gaelic League of Foynes, which proposed to hold its Feis on a Sunday, and to appease him the Feis was held on a week day, with the result that numbers of people were deprived from attending it. Although the Sunday fixture was abandoned to please him, neither Father Donor nor any of his curates attended the Feis.|$|E
500|$|Sigler, who {{was offered}} the role only days before filming commenced, {{said that she had}} always been a fan of Carey, and {{accepted}} the offer immediately. She described that the shoot was set in the 1960s, and that she played the singer's mother during and after her pregnancy. Sigler described the plot: [...] "With my character, she's basically going against her parent's wishes to be with <b>this</b> <b>gentleman.</b> She's pregnant with a baby, which is Mariah, and they run away together. So it's kind of an epic love story, it's nice." [...] Carey revealed that the video would incorporate a rainstorm scene in New York City. Carey jokingly explained how she originally did not intend to get wet, but felt it added a lot to the video.|$|E

500|$|Schuyler and Washington were devastated {{upon hearing}} of Montgomery's death. Schuyler {{believed}} that without Montgomery, victory in Canada was not possible. He wrote to Congress and Washington that [...] "My amiable friend, the gallant Montgomery, is no more; the brave Arnold is wounded; {{and we have}} met a severe check, in an unsuccessful attempt on Quebec, May Heaven be graciously pleased that the misfortune may terminate here." [...] Washington wrote to Schuyler, [...] "In the death of <b>this</b> <b>gentleman,</b> America has sustained a heavy loss, as he had approved himself a steady friend to her rights and of ability to render her the most essential services." [...] Congress reacted to Montgomery's death by {{trying to keep the}} loss as quiet as possible. They feared the news would lower the morale of the troops and civilians.|$|E
500|$|Writing in the South Australian Register, George William Francis, {{director}} of the Botanic Garden, said that the 32species of timber Ninnis had collected settled [...] "that important question, is there timber around [...] or not?" [...] Noting that the member of the expedition originally intended to return biological specimens to Adelaide had failed to do so, Francis wrote that [...] "we are very much indebted to <b>this</b> <b>gentleman</b> [...] who has thus supplied us {{at a time when}} we have failed in obtaining information through the appointed channel." [...] Upon the conclusion of the expedition in 1866, Ninnis received the thanks of the Parliament of South Australia for his work. His research on the expedition later formed the basis of a published work, Remarks on the Natural History, Meteorology, and Native Population of Northern Australia.|$|E
2500|$|A celebrated {{performer}} {{has seen}} fit to oblige {{the world with a}} confession of his faith; or, Br–’s RELIGIO DRAMATICI. <b>This</b> <b>gentleman,</b> in his laudable attempt to shift from his person the obloquy of Judaism, with the forwardness of a new convert, in trying to prove too much, has, in the opinion of many, proved too little. A simple declaration of his Christianity was sufficient; but, strange to say, his apology has not a word about it. [...] We can do no less than congratulate the general state of Christendom upon the accession of so extraordinary a convert.|$|E

2500|$|Historians with archival access have {{confirmed}} that Stalin was intimately involved in the terror. Russian historian Oleg V. Khlevniuk states [...] "…theories about the elemental, spontaneous nature of the terror, about a loss of central control {{over the course of}} mass repression, and about the role of regional leaders in initiating the terror are simply not supported by the historical record." [...] Stalin personally directed Yezhov to torture those who were not making proper confessions. In one instance, he told Yezhov [...] "Isn't it time to squeeze <b>this</b> <b>gentleman</b> and force him to report on his dirty little business? Where is he: in a prison or a hotel?" [...] In another, while reviewing one of Yezhov's lists, he added to M. I. Baranov’s name, [...] "beat, beat!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Ingres {{remained}} in Rome for six years. He devoted {{much of his}} attention to the training of the painting students, as he was later to do at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris. He re-organized the Academy, increased the size of the library, added many molds of classical statues to the Academy collection, and assisted the students in getting public commissions in both Rome and Paris. He traveled to Orvieto (1835), Sienna (1835), and to Ravenna and Urbino to study the paleochristian mosaics, medieval murals and Renaissance art. He devoted considerable attention to music, one of the subjects of the academy; he welcomed Franz Liszt and Fanny Mendelssohn. He formed a long friendship with Liszt. The composer Charles Gounod, who was a pensioner at the time at the Academy, described Ingres's appreciation of modern music, including Weber and Berlioz, and his adoration for Beethoven, Haydn, Mozart and Gluck. He joined the music students and his friend Niccolò Paganini in playing Beethoven's violin works. Gounod wrote that Ingres [...] "had the tenderness of an infant and the indignation of an apostle." [...] When Stendhal visited the Academy and disparaged Beethoven, Ingres turned to the doorman, indicated Stendahl, and told him, [...] "If <b>this</b> <b>gentleman</b> ever calls again, I am not here." ...|$|E
2500|$|Later that day, the Supreme Court {{issued a}} {{statement}} that it had ordered the army to remove Zelaya from office. The Supreme Court stated [...] "The armed forces, in charge of supporting the constitution, acted to defend the state of law and {{have been forced to}} apply legal dispositions against those who have expressed themselves publicly and acted against the dispositions of the basic law". On 30 June, the military's chief lawyer, Colonel Herberth Bayardo Inestroza Membreño, showed a detention order, signed 26 June by a Supreme Court judge, which ordered the armed forces to detain the president, identified by his full name of José Manuel Zelaya Rosales, at his home in the Tres Caminos area of the capital. It cited him for treason and abuse of authority, among other charges. Colonel Inestroza later stated that deporting Zelaya did not comply with the court order: [...] "In the moment that we took him out of the country, in the way that he was taken out, there is a crime. Because of the circumstances of the moment this crime occurred, {{there is going to be}} a justification and cause for acquittal that will protect us." [...] He said the decision was taken by the military leadership [...] "in order to avoid bloodshed". He said [...] "What was more beneficial, remove <b>this</b> <b>gentleman</b> from Honduras or present him to prosecutors and have a mob assault and burn and destroy and for us to have to shoot?" [...] Colonel Inestroza also commented that Zelaya's allegiance to Hugo Chávez was hard to stomach and [...] "It would be difficult for us, with our training, to have a relationship with a leftist government. That's impossible. I personally would have retired, because my thinking, my principles, would not have allowed me to participate in that." ...|$|E

2500|$|Marshall was {{thrust into}} the office of Chief Justice {{in the wake of}} the presidential {{election}} of 1800. With the Federalists soundly defeated and about to lose both the executive and legislative branches to Jefferson and the Democratic-Republicans, President Adams and the lame duck Congress passed what came to be known as the Midnight Judges Act, which made sweeping changes to the federal judiciary, including a reduction in the number of Justices from six to five (upon the next vacancy in the court) so as to deny Jefferson an appointment until two vacancies occurred. As the incumbent Chief Justice Oliver Ellsworth was in poor health, Adams first offered the seat to ex-Chief Justice John Jay, who declined on the grounds that the Court lacked [...] "energy, weight, and dignity." [...] Jay's letter arrived on January 20, 1801, and as there was precious little time left, Adams surprised Marshall, who was with him at the time and able to accept the nomination immediately. The Senate at first delayed, hoping that Adams would make a different choice, such as promoting Justice William Paterson of New Jersey. According to New Jersey Senator Jonathan Dayton, the Senate finally relented [...] "lest another not so qualified, and more disgusting to the Bench, should be substituted, and because it appeared that <b>this</b> <b>gentleman</b> [...] was not privy to his own nomination". Marshall was confirmed by the Senate on January 27, 1801, and received his commission on January 31, 1801. While Marshall officially took office on February 4, at the request of the President he continued to serve as Secretary of State until Adams' term expired on March 4. President John Adams offered this appraisal of Marshall's impact: [...] "My gift of John Marshall to the people of the United States was the proudest act of my life." ...|$|E
