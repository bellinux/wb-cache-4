Branagh stated the footage contains [...] "things like the Asgardian parents, Odin and Frigga, played by the beautiful Rene Russo, there's some beautiful scenes in there that I <b>think</b> <b>people</b> <b>will</b> enjoy. And certainly Thor and Loki interacting in different ways that just fill {{in a little bit}} of a back story, that was part of our rehearsal and research."

It {{was one of the}} first songs written for the group's debut studio album, DNA. Unlike most The X Factor (UK) alumni, the band were adamant on being involved with the writing of their first original single. Band member Perrie Edwards stressed, [...] "At the end of the day, it's our name on it. If we're not happy, then I <b>think</b> <b>people</b> <b>will</b> see straight through it."

Murphy said, [...] "We didn't want to have a show where they were in high school for eight years. We really wanted to be true to that experience." [...] Adult characters played by Matthew Morrison and Jane Lynch would remain to provide continuity to the series, though according to Falchuk, some students—Rachel, Finn and Kurt in particular—would likely remain on the show after they graduate. In May 2012, Murphy said that just because a character on the show graduates high school does not mean that they are leaving, [...] "A lot of people have been writing Dianna's off the show, Amber's off the show — they're not off the show.

When I read that [...] I said, 'I <b>think</b> <b>people</b> <b>will</b> misconstrue that.' She's excited about where her character is going. They all are.

I'm not really so interested in it working on a purely cerebral level. I'm much more concerned with it on an emotional level and that you leave feeling a certain way."

[...] Miller continued that he was [...] "past the point of fighting" [...] discussions of how [...] "arty or brainy" [...] he was, but had hoped for greater emphasis [...] "on what the songs are about—be it the boy-girl situation, or being depressed about some key failure I've had, or getting a little bit of understanding about life." [...] In another 1993 interview, Miller mused:I don't think I'm in danger of making albums that don't age well, because I haven't ever fit into the times spectacularly well. I've always been aware of myself drawing on a musical vocabulary so broad {{that a lot of people}} don't get what I consider to be my real songwriting coups. I think they go right past a lot of people. The bad part of that is I probably won't become a big star. But the good part is that I don't <b>think</b> <b>people</b> <b>will</b> find the albums less useful over time. They'll sound as good in 2004 as they will in 1994.|$|E

The deed was recorded in both Counties on June 5, 1998. The former Central Hudson power lines were finally removed in 2009, as part of Walkway construction. On December 21, 2010, the Walkway corporation conveyed the entire structure to the New York State Bridge Authority, which restored high-limit liability insurance and [...] "deep-pocket" [...] maintenance assurance for the first time since November 2, 1984. On September 5, 2009, conversion work and repairs to the structural steel and the laying of concrete slabs for the walkway were completed.

We just have to do our best, try and win both races and see how it goes." [...] Buemi, the pre-title favourite, missed the New York City races because of a World Endurance Championship commitment at the Nürburgring, but stated he would prepare for the Montreal events the same way as he would with any other ePrix: [...] "We will try to do the best possible. I hope we can finish this season in style and look forward to it." [...] He created controversy when he raised the issue of his crash with di Grassi at the 2016 London ePrix, saying: [...] "If [...] happens once more like this, what do you <b>think</b> <b>people</b> <b>will</b> think then? It will be very hard to explain for him. He can’t afford anything like that again for his reputation, can he?" [...] Di Grassi responded by noting Buemi lost the first season championship through a driver error and said Buemi had more pressure and another mistake would prevent him from reclaiming the championship: [...] "Everyone feels pressure in a different way of course. He has pressure big time this weekend, much more than me, this is because everyone will be waiting to see if those mistakes come again in Montreal." ...|$|E

She loves school and homework and is usually a kind polite person who thinks of others especially her friends. However, she has a surprisingly ferocious temper, especially when wanting to protect her friends. Her parents are often shown as busy and her father is a transvestite, making life for her difficult as she has {{no one to talk}} to and had to rely on herself. Originally outcast due to her looks, Akemi has developed a close friendly bond with Inari. She develops feelings for Keiko, but chooses to cover it since she <b>thinks</b> <b>people</b> <b>will</b> see her weirdly as love between girl and girl is strange. After some encouragement from her friends, she eventually decides to accept her own feelings. While Sanjou rejects her, the two still remain friends.|$|R
2500|$|Before Slumdog Millionaire was released, Patel {{auditioned for}} the role of Zuko by {{submitting}} a tape to the studio. Shyamalan called Patel personally to inform him that he got the part. Training for the film was intense, as he had to learn Wushu and different martial arts. Patel recalls fighting, punching, and throwing and said the experience was [...] "truly amazing." [...] While he was filming Slumdog in India, he would finish a take and turn one of the channels over to the animated series. Even though it is based on a cartoon, he wanted to bring as much of himself as possible to the character he was portraying. Shaun Toub, who was cast as Iroh, describes his character in the first film as [...] "loose" [...] and [...] "free". He compares Zuko's [...] "obsession" [...] to his childhood memories and how kids are always looking for their parents' approval, saying that Zuko just wants his father's. [...] "He isn't necessarily bad, he just {{has a great deal of}} built up anger and forgets to consider others. I <b>think</b> <b>people</b> <b>will</b> understand that he's not bad, he's just angry and hurting because he really wants his father to love him, but his father is too busy with other things." [...] He says that Patel is an [...] "18 year old with all this energy," [...] and that Patel was able to influence him into appreciating the business of filmmaking more. While comparing the animated series to the film, he says the film is much more serious. He attributed this change to the director trying to relate to every age group, rather than just kids.|$|E

Schuldiner also played guitar in the [...] "supergroup" [...] Voodoocult on the album Jesus Killing Machine in 1994 and played a guest solo on Naphobia's 1995 release, Of Hell on the track [...] "As Ancients Evolve" [...] as a favor to the band's bassist at the time who was a friend of Schuldiner's. Schuldiner was also asked {{to be one of the}} many guest vocalists on Dave Grohl's 2001 Probot. Grohl, Napalm Death, Ozzy Osbourne, and Anthrax all increased efforts to raise funds for Schuldiner's medical bills with Grohl trying to involve Schuldiner on an album he was working on. In a 1999 interview Schuldiner spoke about why he didn't sing on the album The Fragile Art of Existence [...] "...these vocals are all I ever wanted to do in Death but couldn't. I've had this dream of recording like that for years, and it seems like a dream come true. Tim Aymar is an amazing singer and this is the main difference. I <b>think</b> <b>people</b> <b>will</b> be surprised at the violence and strength of the album. Many people are expecting something like Iron Maiden, but, despite being one of my favorite bands, I didn't want to make an Iron Maiden-like album. I wanted to make an unpredictable album, just like I did in Death, I guess. I don't like to make predictable albums." ...|$|E
2500|$|We weren't {{trying not}} {{to put out a}} record. It was just one thing after another and time flew by. When you don't do your band like a career like us, you've got other things to do than worry about getting records made. If you don't put a {{deadline}} on it, it may never get done. Like us, you turn around and it's been six years. The first year or two after the last record, we were still touring and not thinking about making an album. Then, in the third year, we were busy and it took a few months to write and get in the studio. There's lag time at the label and then it's winter... It just goes on and on. When NOFX asked us if we wanted to go on the road with them, {{we thought it would be}} fun, but we thought it would be better if we had the record finished. We hadn't planned on being done in October. It was for later in the year, so we had to kick it in high gear and get into the studio. Everything worked backwards from there 'cause if we had fucked it up, we'd be looking at 2009 before the album was done. That deadline really got it all together, but it was only a matter of a few weeks. We'd planned to go into the studio three weeks after we actually did. We'd have only rehearsed with the luxury time, so we were ready. Most of [...] the last 12 months, so it's a new record, not stuff we were sitting on and hadn't recorded.
