25|$|Optimization will {{generally}} focus on improving {{just one or}} two aspects of performance: execution time, memory usage, disk space, bandwidth, power consumption or some other resource. This will usually require a trade-offnbsp&— where one factor is optimized at <b>the</b> <b>expense</b> <b>of</b> <b>others.</b> For example, increasing the size of cache improves runtime performance, but also increases the memory consumption. Other common trade-offs include code clarity and conciseness.|$|E
25|$|Generally {{the courts}} have taken a deferential {{approach}} to reviewing unions' decisions challenged as a breach of their duty of fair representation. Recognizing that the collective bargaining process typically requires compromises, which may favor some workers at <b>the</b> <b>expense</b> <b>of</b> <b>others,</b> {{the courts have}} held that a union only breaches its duty if it acts arbitrarily, in bad faith or discriminatorily. Practical considerations have also led the courts to refuse to second-guess unions' decisions: if a court or jury could substitute its judgment as to whether a particular grievance had merit, then unions could not function, since their decisions would rarely be final in any practical sense. Accordingly, the courts have refused to overturn union decisions as arbitrary {{so long as they}} were based on a reasoned decision by the union, even if the court might believe that this decision was wrong.|$|E
25|$|The {{venue for}} the All-Star Game is chosen by Major League Baseball. The {{criteria}} for the venue are subjective; generally, cities with new ballparks {{and those who have}} not hosted the game in a long time—or ever—tend to get selected. Over time, this has resulted in certain cities being selected more often at <b>the</b> <b>expense</b> <b>of</b> <b>others,</b> mainly due to timely circumstances: Cleveland Stadium and the original Yankee Stadium are tied for the most times a venue has hosted the All-Star game, both hosting four games. New York City has hosted more than any other city, having done so nine times in five different stadiums. At the same time, the New York Mets failed to host for 48 seasons (1965–2012), while the Los Angeles Dodgers have not hosted since 1980 (37 years as of 2017). Among current major league teams, the Washington Nationals and the Tampa Bay Rays have yet to host the All-Star game, but the Nationals are scheduled to host the game in 2018.|$|E

25|$|There {{has been}} {{considerable}} research {{in recent times}} {{on the role of}} cognitive variables among the set of factors that can lead to rape. A detailed conceptual analysis shows that objectification might underlie denial of agency and personhood that leads to rape. Sexually violent men {{have been shown to be}} more likely to consider victims responsible for the rape and are less knowledgeable about the impact of rape on victims. Such men may misread cues given out by women in social situations and may lack the inhibitions that act to suppress associations between sex and aggression. They may have coercive sexual fantasies, and overall are more hostile towards women than are men who are not sexually violent. In addition to these factors, sexually violent men are believed to differ from other men in terms of impulsivity and antisocial tendencies. They also tend to have an exaggerated sense of masculinity. Sexual violence is also associated with a preference for impersonal sexual relationships as opposed to emotional bonding, with having many sexual partners and with the inclination to assert personal interests at <b>the</b> <b>expense</b> <b>of</b> <b>others.</b> A further association is with adversarial attitudes on gender, that hold that women are opponents to be challenged and conquered.|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} main claims to unwind {{substantive}} transactions that could unjustly enrich some creditors' at <b>the</b> <b>expense</b> <b>of</b> <b>others.</b> First, the Insolvency Act 1986 section 127 declare every transaction void which is entered after {{the presentation of}} a winding up petition, unless approved by a court. In Re Gray’s Inn Construction Co Ltd Buckley LJ held that courts would habitually approve all contracts that were plainly beneficial to a company entered into in good faith in the ordinary course of business. The predominant purpose of the provision is to ensure unsecured creditors are not prejudiced, and the company's assets are not unduly depleted. However, in Re Gray's Inn because a host of transactions honoured by the company's bank, in an overdrawn account, between the presentation and the winding up petition were being granted, this meant unprofitable trading. So, the deals were declared void. In Hollicourt (Contracts) Ltd v Bank of Ireland, the Court of Appeal held that a bank itself which allows overpayments will not be liable to secondarily creditors if transactions are subsequently declared void. It took the view that a bank is not unjustly enriched, despite any fees for its services the bank may receive. Second, under IA 1986 section 238, transactions at an undervalue may be avoided regardless of their purpose, but only {{up to two years}} before the onset of insolvency. For example, in Phillips v Brewin Dolphin Bell Lawrie Ltd the liquidators of an insolvent company, AJ Bekhor Ltd, claimed rescind the transfer of assets to a subsidiary, whose shares were then purchased by the investment management house Brewin Dolphin for £1. The only other consideration given by Brewin Dolphin was the promise to carry out a lease agreement for computers, which itself was likely to be unwound and therefore worthless. The House of Lords held that the total package of connected transactions could be taken into account to decide whether a transaction was undervalued or not, and held that this one was.|$|E

Elspeth is also probably unfaithful to him on several occasions.

500|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the end of the series' run, several colleges and universities such as Johns Hopkins, [...] Brown University, and Harvard College have offered classes on The Wire in disciplines ranging from law to sociology to film studies. Phillips Academy, a boarding high school in Massachusetts, offers a similar course as well. University of Texas at San Antonio offers a course where the series is taught as a work of literary fiction. In an article published in The Washington Post, Anmol Chaddha and William Julius Wilson explain why Harvard chose The Wire as curriculum material for their course on urban inequality: [...] "Though scholars know that deindustrialization, crime and prison, and the education system are deeply intertwined, they must often give focused attention to just one subject in relative isolation, at <b>the</b> <b>expense</b> <b>of</b> <b>others.</b> With the freedom of artistic expression, The Wire can be more creative. It can weave together the range of forces that shape the lives of the urban poor." [...] University of York's Head of Sociology, Roger Burrows, said in The Independent that the show [...] "makes a fantastic contribution to their understanding of contemporary urbanism", and is [...] "a contrast to dry, dull, hugely expensive studies that people carry out on the same issues". The series is also studied as part of a Master seminar series at the Paris West University Nanterre La Défense. In February 2012, Slovenian philosopher Slavoj Žižek gave a lecture at Birkbeck, University of London titled The Wire or the clash of civilisations in one country. In April 2012, Norwegian academic Erlend Lavik posted online a 36-minute video essay called [...] "Style in The Wire" [...] which analyzes the various visual techniques used by the show's directors over the course of its five seasons.|$|E
500|$|Canning's {{trial was}} marked by the prosecution's {{inability}} to find any evidence whatsoever {{that she had been}} anywhere but in Wells's home, and where Canning was in January 1753 remains unknown. [...] Similarly, mystery surrounds the precise movements of the Squires family, when it was supposed they were travelling through Dorset early in 1753. [...] The writer F. J. Harvey Darton suspected that the family were smugglers, and that it was significant they had passed through Eggardon, where Isaac Gulliver operated (although Gulliver was, at the time, a child). [...] The 18th-century artist Allan Ramsay claimed that Canning's initial story was [...] "exceedingly stupid", and false. [...] He viewed the lack of detail in her testimony as unsurprising to a more analytical mind. [...] The US author Lillian Bueno McCue theorised that she was an amnesiac, and that her former employer, John Wintlebury, was to blame for her imprisonment at the Wells house. [...] Treherne (1989) considers this theory very unlikely however, and instead concludes that Canning was almost certainly at Enfield Wash, but was not kept prisoner at Wells's home. [...] He suggests that Robert Scaratt implanted the suggestion that Canning had been held at the Wells's house, as a useful decoy, and that he had somehow been involved in an unwanted pregnancy. [...] Treherne also suggests that Canning was suffering from partial amnesia, and that she may not have lied intentionally at the trial of Squires and Wells. [...] He calls Canning [...] "the first media product." [...] Although some early authors adopted the same stance as Fielding or Hill, who actively took sides in the affair, most later writers believe that Canning did not tell the truth. [...] Moore (1994), however, believes that Canning was probably innocent. Moore explains discrepancies between Canning and the Squires' testimonies as understandable omissions and modifications, and placing much emphasis on the ability of those men in power to follow their own pursuits—often at <b>the</b> <b>expense</b> <b>of</b> <b>others.</b>|$|E

Narcissistic individuals use various strategies to protect the self at <b>the</b> <b>expense</b> <b>of</b> <b>others.</b> They tend to devalue, derogate, insult and blame others, and they often respond to threatening feedback with anger and hostility. Since the fragile ego of individuals with NPD is hypersensitive to perceived criticism or defeat, they are prone to feelings of shame, humiliation and worthlessness over minor or even imagined incidents. They usually mask these feelings from others with feigned humility or by isolating themselves socially, or they may react with outbursts of rage, defiance, or by seeking revenge. The merging of the [...] "inflated self-concept" [...] and the [...] "actual self" [...] is seen in the inherent grandiosity of narcissistic personality disorder.

2500|$|Lorenzo DiTommaso {{compared}} Dunes {{portrayal of}} the downfall of a galactic empire to Edward Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire which argues that Christianity led to the fall of Ancient Rome. In [...] "History and Historical Effect in Frank Herbert's Dune" [...] (1992), Lorenzo DiTommaso outlines similarities between the two works by highlighting {{the excesses of the}} Emperor on his home planet of Kaitain and of the Baron Harkonnen in his palace. The Emperor loses his effectiveness as a ruler from excess of ceremony and pomp. The hairdressers and attendants he brings with him to Arrakis are even referred to as [...] "parasites". The Baron Harkonnen is similarly corrupt, materially indulgent, and sexually decadent. Gibbon's Decline and Fall blames the fall of Rome on the rise of Christianity. Gibbon claimed that this exotic import from a conquered province weakened the soldiers of Rome and left it open to attack. Similarly, the Emperor's Sardaukar fighters are little match for the Fremen of Dune because of the Sardaukar's overconfidence and the Fremen's capacity for self-sacrifice. The Fremen put the community before themselves in every instance, while the world outside wallows in luxury at <b>the</b> <b>expense</b> <b>of</b> <b>others.</b>|$|E
