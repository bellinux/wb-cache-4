5|$|Starting {{with a free}} plot {{of land in the}} United Kingdom and {{few hundred}} {{thousand}} pounds, the player must build a profitable amusement park. Money is spent on building rides, shops, and staff, and earned through sale of entry tickets, merchandise, and refreshments. Shops available include those selling foodstuff (such as ice creams) or soft drinks, and games such as coconut shies and arcades. Their attributes can be customised, which may affect customers' behaviour: for example, affecting the flavour of foods (e.g. by altering the amount of sugar and ice cream contains) may affect customers' enticements to return. Facilities such as toilets, and items that enhance the park's scenery (such as trees and fountains) can be purchased. Over thirty attractions, ranging in complexity from the bouncy castle and tree house to more complicated and expensive rides such as the roller coaster and Ferris wheel are available. Also available as rides are shows (called 'acts') with themes such as clowns and mediaeval. Certain rides, such as roller coasters, require a track to be laid out. The ride complement varies between platforms: for example, the PlayStation version is missing the mediaeval and dolphin shows. Rides require regular maintenance: if neglected for too long they will explode. Depending on the platform, it is possible to tour <b>the</b> <b>park</b> <b>or</b> the rides.|$|E

25|$|The beaches at Jacob Riis Park {{consists}} of 14 bays numbered east-to-west on the Atlantic coast. The main beach occupies the western half of <b>the</b> <b>park,</b> <b>or</b> Bays 6 through 14, {{at the mouth}} of the Central Mall. Bays 1 through 5 lie on the eastern half in front of Neponsit Beach Hospital and the park bathhouse. Bay 1 is directly in front of the hospital, while the bathhouse feeds into Bay 4. The main beach features a distinctive crescent shape opening towards the Atlantic Ocean. The eastern half of the beach is much more narrow than the western half. Each bay is separated by reinforced concrete jetties, boulders, and rows of wooden pilings which extend into the ocean. The jetties also stabilize the sand of the beach. Until the 1950s, Bays 1 and 2 were part of the Neponsit Hospital property. Adjacent to the east of Bay 1 is Rockaway Beach, another public beach which stretches from Neponsit to Far Rockaway at the east end of the peninsula. A fence separates the two beaches.|$|E

500|$|The protections {{normally}} {{afforded to}} national parks have not halted the degradations of Marojejy National Park. [...] The hunting of lemurs, including the silky sifaka, is a persistent problem, {{as is the}} harvesting of precious hardwoods, such as rosewood and palissandre. [...] Semi-precious gemstones, such as amethyst, are still mined {{within the boundaries of}} the park, while slash and burn agriculture and wood collection for firewood and construction continue to cause the periphery to recede. [...] These pressures are growing strong as the population in the region continues to increase. [...] In 2003, approximately 200,000 people lived within [...] of the park, 80% of whom were farmers that were still dependent upon the forest for agricultural land and various products, such as honey, firewood, and plant fibers, as well as tree bark from plants of the family Rutaceae (primarily genus Evodia) used to ferment betsabetsa, a local sugarcane spirit. [...] Additionally, inappropriate use of <b>the</b> <b>park</b> <b>or</b> excessive visitation by guests could also pose a threat to the fragile high-altitude scrub.|$|E
500|$|The {{boundaries}} of Marojejy National Park were originally established by approximation when {{the park was}} established in 1952. [...] With a second decree (no. 66-242) from the government of Madagascar in 1966, the park's status as a strict nature reserve was reaffirmed, and its boundaries were marked by 89 points.

[...] The families were later expelled for violating these conditions. [...] Many families from the local communities did not understand why such a large area so rich in resources and necessary for their survival was forbidden to them, and between the late 1980s and 1993, they stopped honoring the status of the park. [...] They began clearing the outer edges of the reserve to start plantations of vanilla and coffee. [...] In 1993, the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) and the Service des Eaux et Forêts renewed conservation efforts in the area, evicted the people living inside the reserve, and renegotiated the borders with the local community, based on the 1966 decree. [...] Trails and posts were then used to clearly mark the edges of the reserve. [...] In the years following these events, many communities living near the borders of the park have become more involved in forest surveillance, and deforestation has fallen off sharply to only a few hectares a year.|$|E
