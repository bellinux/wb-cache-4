40|$|Cephalopods are {{important}} prey for numerous seabird species.

As such more common pelagic species {{are considered to be}} top predators, the study proposes to know what constitutes their main food.

Teuthida cephalopods constitute the main food item for the three tuna species, while X. gladius feeds mainly on Ommastrephidae cephalopods.

40|$|The oceanic tuna fishery uses four {{principal}} gear types, longline, purse seine, {{pole and}} line (or baitboat), and troll, deployed by fishing vessels from approximately 25 different countries and territories. Each gear type may be deployed {{in a variety of}} configurations to target a particular species of fish. Longliners deploy numerous baited hooks arranged on lines up to 75 n. mi. in length. The number of hooks deployed and the depths at which they operate are adjusted to target different species in different regions of the ocean. The range of depths fished by <b>tuna</b> <b>longliners</b> has shifted to deeper layers during the last 50 years so that the catchability coefficient (the probability that a hook will catch a fish) has changed over time in various ways for various species.

The response variable was the CPUE defined as number of fish caught per thousand hooks. The following factors were tested in the analyses: year (9), month (12), area (5) and target (3). The levels of the factor “area” were based on the spatial distribution of the fishing sets, while the levels of the factor “target ” were defined by a cluster analysis, as five areas; and cluster C 1 : other fishes; C 2 : blue shark; and C 3 : swordfish. A stepwise approach was initially used to identify the variables and interactions with a significant influence on the CPUE. The “target ” and “area ” were the main factors explaining the observed CPUE variability (36. 5 % and 28. 5 %, respectively). The overall pattern of the standardized CPUE indicates a relatively high stability, up to 2005. In 2006, however, there was a strong increase of the CPUE.

The longline tuna fishery appears only in the three central provinces of Vietnam (Khanh Hoa, Binh Dinh, and Phu Yen) and its main targeted species are bigeye and yellowfin tuna. The gillnet and purse seine fisheries appear in almost all central coastal provinces and their catches are mainly skipjack tuna.

40|$|The tuna {{fisheries}} in Sri Lanka are undergoing significant developmental changes, {{with more and}} more tuna fishing boats making multi-day fishing trips in offshore waters. There are now about 1200 multi-day boats and more boats of larger size (> 40 ft length) continue to enter these fisheries and stay out at sea for more than 10 days; some even fish in international waters. Gillnets and longlines are used in combination, and together account for more than 95 % of the total fishing effort. The total production of large pelagic fish is in the region of 75, 000 t, about 55, 000 t of which is from offshore areas. The continuous expansion of the offshore fishing fleet and the extended area of operation have contributed to this increase in production. The average catch rates of the tuna-fishing fleet have remained about 200 kg/boat night, with some variations between different craft-gear combinations. All species of tunas together contribute about 50 % of the catch of large pelagic species. Almost 60 % of the tuna catch consists of skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis), followed by yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares), which represents 20 %. Sharks and billfish also form a significant percentage of the large pelagic catch. With the issuing of permits to local and foreign fishing companies to land the <b>tuna</b> caught by <b>longliners</b> operating in international waters, few local boat owners have started longlining for tunas at the 50 - 100 m depth range to target the deep-swimming large yellowfin (Thunnus albacares) and bigeye (Thunnus obesus) tunas.

40|$|This study {{provides}} a historical {{overview of the}} use of drifting fish aggregating devices (DFADs) in purse seine fisheries since the early 1990 s, using global tuna fisheries datasets from the four tuna Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs). Tropical tuna purse seine fisheries typically target large yellowfin (Thunnus albacares) and bigeye (Thunnus obesus) tunas on free-swimming schools and skipjack (Katsuwonus pelamis) and juveniles of yellowfin and bigeye associated with drifting objects. DFADs have enabled global skipjack catches to markedly increase, and have also introduced major scientific issues for all tuna-RFMOs. In particular, they have strongly modified the fishing strategies of purse seiners that fish on a combination of free-swimming and DFAD-associated schools. Consequently, the cumulated search time traditionally used to quantify nominal fishing effort to assess the status of tuna stocks is inconsistent and cannot be used to derive time series of abundance indices from catch-per-unit of-effort (CPUE). In addition, the lack of information available on the construction, deployment, and use of DFADs has prevented effective monitoring of the fishing pressure {{over the last two decades}} exerted by purse seine fleets using this fishing mode. Juveniles of tropical tunas represent a substantial proportion of purse seine catch on DFADs in the three oceans, which has raised particular concern for some bigeye stocks that have been subject to overfishing in the past. Catches of juvenile tunas by DFAD fishing may also result in a decrease in recruitment for fisheries that target adult <b>tunas</b> such as <b>longliners.</b> In addition, some demographic parameters of tunas and other species associated with DFADs may be affected by the resultant habitat modification arising from the widespread deployment of DFADs. Evidence in the literature and provided by the ratio-estimator method suggest that fishing DFAD-associated schools may result in about 100 000 t of bycatch and discards annually. In addition, there is further potential for ghost fishing related mortality of sensitive species such as marine turtles and pelagic sharks. In this context and following a precautionary approach, we finally discuss the increasing need for all tuna-RFMOs to reduce, or at least monitor and control, the use of DFADs to mitigate their adverse effects not only on yellowfin and bigeye stocks but also on open-ocean ecosystems...|$|R
40|$|Historical {{longline}} catch {{per unit}} effort (CPUE) constitutes the major time series used in tuna stock assessment {{to follow the}} trend in abundance {{since the beginning of}} the large-scale tuna fisheries. The efficiency and species composition of a longline fishing operations essentially depends on the overlap in the vertical and spatial distribution between hooks and species habitat. Longline catchability depends on the vertical distribution of hooks and the aim of our paper was to analyse principal factors affecting the deviation of observed longline hook depths from predicted values. Since observed hook depth is usually shallower than predicted, this deviation is called longline shoaling. We evaluate the accuracy of hook depth distribution estimated from a theoretical catenary model commonly used in longline CPUE standardizations. Temperature-depth recorders (TDRs) were deployed on baskets of a monitored longline. Mainline shapes and maximum fishing depths were similar to gear configurations commonly used to target both yellowfin and bigeye <b>tuna</b> by commercial <b>longliners</b> in the central part of the South Pacific Ocean. Our working hypothesis assumes that the maximum fishing depth reached by the mainline depends on the gear configuration (sag ratio, mainline length per basket), the fishing tactics (bearing of the setting) and environmental variables characterizing water mass dynamics (wind stress, current velocity and shear). Based on generalized additive models (GAMs) simple transformations are proposed to account for the non-linearity between the shoaling and explanatory variables. Then, generalized linear models (GLMs) were fit to model the effects of explanatory variables on the longline shoaling. Results indicated that the shoaling (absolute as well as relative) was significantly influenced by (I) the shape of the mainline (i. e., the tangential angle), which is the strongest predictor, and (2) the current shear and the direction of setting. Geometric forcing (i. e. transverse versus in-line) between the environment and the longline set is shown for the first time from in situ experimental fishing data. Results suggest that a catenary model that does not take these factors into consideration provides a biased estimate of the vertical distribution of hooks and must be used with caution in CPUEs standardization methods. Since catchability varies in time and space we discuss how suitable data could be routinely collected onboard commercial fishing vessels in order to estimate longline catchability for stock assessments...|$|R
