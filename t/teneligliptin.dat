The rats were fed with a normal chow diet (NCD) or a 60 % high-fat diet (HFD) with or without <b>teneligliptin</b> for 4 weeks. The plasma uric acid level was not significantly different between the control and <b>teneligliptin</b> groups under the NCD condition. However, the plasma uric acid level was significantly decreased in the HFD-fed <b>teneligliptin</b> treated rats compared to the HFD-fed control rats. The expression levels of xanthine dehydrogenase (Xdh) mRNA in liver and epididymal adipose tissue of NCD-fed rats were not altered by <b>teneligliptin</b> treatment. On the other hand, Xdh expression was reduced significantly in the epididymal adipose tissue of the HFD-fed <b>teneligliptin</b> treated rats {{compared with that of}} HFD-fed control rats, whereas Xdh expression in liver did not change significantly in either group. Furthermore, <b>teneligliptin</b> significantly decreased Xdh expression in 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes. DPP- 4 treatment significantly increased Xdh expression in 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes. With DPP- 4 pretreatment, <b>teneligliptin</b> significantly decreased Xdh mRNA expression compared to the DPP- 4 -treated 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes.

Materials and Methods: In an initial 12 -week, double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel-group study, patients (n = 204) were randomized to <b>teneligliptin</b> 20 mg or placebo once daily added to their stable pioglitazone therapy. This {{was followed by a}} 40 -week, open-label period during which all patients received <b>teneligliptin</b> once daily. The primary end-point was the change in hemoglobin A 1 c (HbA 1 c) from baseline to week 12. Results: Patients in the <b>teneligliptin</b> group showed significantly greater reductions in HbA 1 c compared with the placebo group at week 12 (P < 0. 001). The changes in HbA 1 c from baseline to week 12 were- 0. 9 – 0. 0 % (least-squares mean – standard error) in the <b>teneligliptin</b> group and- 0. 2 – 0. 0 % in the placebo group. The change in fasting plasma glucose from baseline to week 12 was greater in the <b>teneligliptin</b> group than in the placebo group (P < 0. 001).

This is a positive step toward the management of T 2 DM in developing countries, where the cost of medicine is out-of-pocket expenditure and is a limiting factor for health care. This review evaluates the efficacy and safety of <b>teneligliptin</b> in the management of T 2 DM. <b>Teneligliptin</b> has been systematically evaluated in T 2 DM as monotherapy with diet and exercise and in combination with metformin, glimepiride, pioglitazone, and insulin in short-term (12  weeks) and long-term (52 weeks) studies. These studies have reported a reduction in HbA 1 c of 0. 8 %– 0. 9 % within 12  weeks of therapy. Two 52 -week studies reported sustained improvement in glycemic control with <b>teneligliptin.</b> <b>Teneligliptin</b> {{has been found to be}} well tolerated, and the safety profile is similar to other dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors. Hypoglycemia and constipation are the main adverse events. <b>Teneligliptin</b> can be administered safely to patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease without dose adjustment. Similarly, it can be used in patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic impairment. <b>Teneligliptin</b> is effective and well tolerated and may have an important role in the management of T 2 DM.

Dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP) - 4 inhibitors, anti-diabetic agents, are expected to be effective for the treatment of NAFLD. In the present study, we established a novel NAFLD model mouse using monosodium glutamate (MSG) and a high-fat diet (HFD) and investigated the effects of a DPP- 4 inhibitor, <b>teneligliptin,</b> on the progression of NAFLD. Male MSG/HFD-treated mice were divided into two groups, one of which received <b>teneligliptin</b> in drinking water. Administration of MSG and HFD caused mice to develop severe fatty changes in the liver, but <b>teneligliptin</b> treatment improved hepatic steatosis and inflammation, as evaluated by the NAFLD activity score. Serum alanine aminotransferase and intrahepatic triglyceride levels were significantly decreased in teneligliptin-treated mice (p < 0. 05).

The effects of the dipeptidyl peptidase- 4 inhibitor <b>teneligliptin</b> on CVD-related biomarkers in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM) receiving HD treatment are poorly understood. To determine whether <b>teneligliptin</b> has anti-CVD properties, we assessed its effects on soluble P-selectin (sP-selectin), platelet-derived microparticles (PDMPs), plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI- 1), soluble E-selectin (sE-selectin), soluble vascular adhesion molecule 1 (sVCAM- 1), and adiponectin plasma levels in HD and non-HD patients with T 2 DM. Methods: Patients with T 2 DM eligible for <b>teneligliptin</b> monotherapy or combination therapy (eg, <b>teneligliptin</b> plus a sulfonylurea) were administered <b>teneligliptin</b> (20 mg/d) once daily for 6 months. Plasma levels of sP-selectin, PDMPs, PAI- 1, sE-selectin, sVCAM- 1, and adiponectin were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay at baseline and after 3 months and 6 months of treatment. Results: <b>Teneligliptin</b> therapy significantly reduced plasma levels of sP-selectin, PDMPs, and PAI- 1 compared with baseline levels, while significantly increasing adiponectin levels. sE-selectin and sVCAM- 1 levels were significantly decreased only at 6 months. The reduction in sP-selectin, PDMPs, and PAI- 1 was more significant in HD patients than in non-HD patients. However, the improvement in adiponectin levels was unchanged with HD treatment.

This “real life” data collection was conducted to assess the efficacy of <b>teneligliptin</b> in Indian T 2 DM patients. Methods: Predesigned structured proforma was used to collect information from the prescribing physicians regarding the efficacy of <b>teneligliptin</b> when prescribed as monotherapy as well as combination therapy with other antidiabetic drugs in T 2 DM patients. Information on the glycemic parameters at baseline prior to starting <b>teneligliptin</b> {{and at the end}} of 3 months therapy was collected. The efficacy was assessed by analyzing the mean change in 3 -month values of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA 1 c), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and postprandial plasma glucose (PPG).

40|$|AbstractTo {{assess the}} impact of {{concomitant}} inhibition of sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT) 2 and dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP 4) for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM), the effect of combined treatment with canagliflozin, a novel SGLT 2 inhibitor, and <b>teneligliptin,</b> a DPP 4 inhibitor, on glucose intolerance was investigated in Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats. Canagliflozin potently inhibited human and rat SGLT 2 and moderately inhibited human and rat SGLT 1 activities but did not affect DPP 4 activity. In contrast, <b>teneligliptin</b> inhibited human and rat DPP 4 activities but not SGLT activities. A single oral treatment of canagliflozin and <b>teneligliptin</b> suppressed plasma glucose elevation in an oral glucose tolerance test in 13 week-old ZDF rats. This combination of agents elevated plasma active GLP- 1 levels in a synergistic manner, probably mediated by intestinal SGLT 1 inhibition, and further improved glucose intolerance. In the combination-treated animals, there was no pharmacokinetic interaction of the drugs and no further inhibition of plasma DPP 4 activity compared with that in the teneligliptin-treated animals. These results suggest that the inhibition of SGLT 2 and DPP 4 improves glucose intolerance and that combined treatment with canagliflozin and <b>teneligliptin</b> is a novel therapeutic option for glycemic control in T 2 DM...|$|E

In the present research work, we aimed to perform stability studies on <b>teneligliptin</b> and develop and validate a method for its estimation and identification by RP-HPLC. A new RP-HPLC method was developed and validated for <b>teneligliptin</b> as per the ICH guidelines and used as a stability-indicating method. The <b>teneligliptin</b> pure drug was used for the study and stressed under acid, base, neutral (hydrogen peroxide), UV photolysis, and thermal conditions.

The obtained degraded samples were further analyzed by UPLCMS/MS, to identify the products formed. It is observed that a change in retention times and mass analysis in LCMS is due to the time lag between the sample elution from LC and undergoing ionization in MS. The major molecular ion fragments formed for all the three stress conditions are different except 310.30 ((4 -(4 -(1 -aminovinyl) piperazin- 1 yl) pyrrolidin- 2 -yl) (thiazolidin- 3 -yl) methanone), 214.19 (N,N-diethyl- 1 -phenyl- 1 H-pyrazol- 5 -amine), and 155.65 (1 -(pyrrolidin- 3 -yl) piperazine) were observed in both base and thermal stress conditions. A characteristic of 354.30 (4 -(4 -(1 ethyl- 3 -methyl- 1 H-pyrazol- 5 -yl)piperazin- 1 -yl)-N-(mercaptomethyl)-N-methylpyrrolidine- 2 -carboxamide) and 375.72 ((4 -(4 -(3 -methyl- 1 -vinyl- 1 H-pyrazol- 5 -yl)piperazin- 1 -yl)pyrrolidin- 2 -yl) (thiazolidin- 3 -yl)methanone) molecular ion peaks was observed in base condition and thermal condition, respectively. The products formed with photolytic stress were completely different with molecular ions at 138.08 (N,N-diethyl- 1 H-pyrazol- 5 -amine) and 136.18 (2 -aminoN-(mercaptomethyl)-N-methylacetamide) which are not observed in other stress conditions. From the data, it is observed that comparatively less degradation occurred for photolysis stress than for base and thermal stress. The fragmentation pattern shows that the degraded products are similar for the base and thermal stress samples. Further study is required for determining the degraded products toxicity by quantifying the samples.|$|E
30|$|The {{recovery}} of the method was determined by adding a known amount of the drug to the standard concentration. The recovery was performed at three levels of 80, 100, and 120  % of <b>teneligliptin</b> standard concentration.

30|$|The {{molecular}} ion peak for <b>teneligliptin</b> {{was observed at}} 427.22 in ESI mode. In base-stressed sample, the major intense fragments with M+ of 354.30 at a retention time of 1.195  min, 310.30 and 214.19 at a retention time of 1.345  min, and 178.73 and 155.65 at a retention time of 1.205  min were observed. In peroxide-stressed sample, the fragments with M+ of 138.08 and 136.18 were observed at a retention time of 1.666 and 1.467  min, respectively. In thermal-stressed sample, the fragments with M+ of 375.72 at a retention time of 0.455  min and fragments 214.20, 310.31, and 155.69 at a retention time of 1.325  min were observed. There is no degradation peaks for <b>teneligliptin</b> in acid- and UV-stressed conditions. The scan mode is PDA with both positive (E+) and negative (E−) scans at total ion current (TIC) chromatogram. Both the scans were compared with diode array spectra.|$|E
