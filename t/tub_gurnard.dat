40|$|The {{present study}} {{describes}} the first isolation of Tenacibaculum maritimum from <b>tub</b> <b>gurnard</b> (Chelidonichthys lucernus L.), cultured in Italy. After 3 days shipment from one fish farm to our laboratory facilities, {{a group of}} 20 <b>tub</b> <b>gurnard</b> showed eroded mouth, rotten fins and severe skin ulcerative lesions. Mortality reached 90 % {{of the population in}} 9 days. Traditional bacteriological and PCR analysis allowed the identification of the causative agent as T. maritimum. Serological characterization of the isolate demonstrated that it belongs to serotype O 3. Histopathological examination showed severe skin necrosis, dermis congestion associated with eterophilic and macrophagic infiltration. Immunohistochemical analysis, using specific polyclonal antiserum against T. maritimum serotype O 3, allowed the visualization of numerous positively stained macrophagic cells.

40|$|<b>Tub</b> <b>gurnard</b> (Trigla lucerna L.) {{has been}} {{investigated}} as a new potential fish for farming in the last years. In fact, the decrease in prices, occurred after the increase of sea bass and sea bream production, {{is a source of}} many problems for several Mediterranean fish farm system. For this reason the possibility of diversifying the production has been considered towards other valuable species. The lack of knowledge about the genetic population structure of this Triglidae has prompted the attention on the evaluation of its genetic variability for a better management of broodstock and <b>tub</b> <b>gurnard</b> discrimination according to the geographic distribution. Microsatellite markers have been elected to characterise, at DNA level, the species. They have never been described neither in <b>tub</b> <b>gurnard</b> fish, nor in species from the same suborder. To isolate SSR from the tube gurnard, the FIASCO (Fast Isolation by AFLP of Sequences COntaining repeats) protocol was chosen and 32 loci were isolated. In order to verify the informativity of the isolated loci, three different population, reared and wild type sampled in the middle Adriatic and in the Trieste gulf, were analyzed. Moreover two multiplex PCR were developed and the genotyping of 45 animals, from different populations, was performed showing a high allele ranges between the considered samples...|$|E
40|$|Two {{episodes of}} flexibacteriosis caused by T. maritimum were {{diagnosed}} in wild turbot and farmed <b>tub</b> <b>gurnard</b> in Italy. The two different cases {{occurred in the}} facilities of Universtiy of Camerino during reproduction trials. A group of 10 adult turbot showed haemorrhagic, frayed fins and eroded mouth two weeks after capture from the North Adriatic Sea. The disease was controlled by antibiotic therapy. A group of 20 <b>tub</b> <b>gurnard</b> showed eroded mouth, rotten fins and severe skin ulcerative lesions, after 3 days of transportations from a fish farm to our laboratory facilities. Mortality reached 90 % of the population within 9 days. Traditional bacteriological and PCR analysis of the isolates in the two episodes allowed {{the identification of the}} causative agent as Tenacibaculum maritimum.

40|$|The {{suitability}} of using discards from artisanal fisheries as feed for wild-caught Chelidonichthys lucerna (L.) reared in submerged cages in the Adriatic Sea was investigated. Three-hundred juvenile <b>tub</b> <b>gurnard</b> (72. 9 ± 11 g, 18 ± 1 cm) were captured and separated into four circular 35. 3 m 3 submerged cages. Two stocking densities were used: two cages contained 60 fish each (1. 7 fish m- 3; CG-L) and two cages contained 90 fish each (2. 55 fish m- 3; CG-H). Growth performance and survival rates were recorded over a 240 day {{period during which}} <b>tub</b> <b>gurnard</b> were fed with a variety non-target fishery discards, including common crab, sardine, Atlantic chub mackerel, anchovy, and salema. The survival rate was approximately 90 % in both groups (CG-L = 91 % and CG-H = 90 %), with final stocking densities of 0. 32 kg m- 3 and 0. 49 kg m- 3 for the CG-L and CG-H groups, respectively. There {{were no significant differences}} in final mean body weight or length between the CG-L group (206 ± 23 g, 24. 6 ± 2 cm) and the CG-H group (215. 5 ± 32 g, 24. 8 ± 2 cm). The condition index was similar between the two groups (1. 38 and 1. 42 for CG-L and CG-H, respectively). The feed conversion ratio was high in both the CG-H (2. 39) and CG-L (2. 32) cages. These results demonstrate that viable growth rates of <b>tub</b> <b>gurnard</b> may be obtained by feeding recycled fishery discards and rearing in cages placed on the seabed, which allows for the natural benthic behavior of this species...|$|E
40|$|The ICES Working Group on Assessment of New MoU Species met at ICES Head-quarters in Copenhagen, Denmark, during 18 – 22 March 2012. There were 9 partici-pants from 7 countries.

40|$|The quality {{traits of}} the fillets from <b>tub</b> <b>gurnard</b> (Chelidonichthys lucerna L.) fished in the mid-Adriatic Sea were investigated. Forty fishes per season were sampled to {{evaluate}} the proximate composition, cholesterol content and fatty acid profile of fillets. Seasons signifi- cantly affected the quality traits of flesh. The protein content ranged from 19. 39 % in winter to 19. 67 % in summer, without significant dif- ferences. Lipid content was notably higher in spring (2. 28 %) and summer (2. 32 %), com- pared to autumn (1. 72 %) and winter (1. 31 %). Energy content was significantly higher in spring (416. 45 kJ/ 100 g) and summer (417. 97 kJ/ 100 g) compared to autumn (391. 35 kJ/ 100 g) and winter (372. 79 kJ/ 100 g). Saturated fatty acid content was highest in spring (35. 88 %), whereas monounsaturated acid con- tent was not influenced by season. The n- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acid content exceeded 37 % of total fatty acid content during summer. The n- 6 /n- 3 ratio remained favourably low across all seasons (from 0. 16 to 0. 18), with a slight significant increase in autumn (0. 31). In conclusion, this study indicates that the flesh of <b>tub</b> <b>gurnard</b> has high nutritional value year-round, with the best results (in terms of n- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids) being obtained in summer...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe first {{occurrence}} of {{striped red mullet}} Mullus surmuletus in the Pomeranian Bay (in 2007) and the {{occurrence of}} three very rarely noted species (<b>tub</b> <b>gurnard</b> Chelidonichthys lucerna, Atlantic horse mackerel Trachurus trachurus, thicklip grey mullet Chelon labrosus) collected in 2007 – 2008 in the Pomeranian Bay, Szczecin Lagoon and Lake Dąbie are reported. Their expansion is probably due to increased sea temperatures resulting from climate change, {{as well as the}} inflow of saline water. The ‘visitors’ hosted eight pathogens from four taxonomic groups: Protozoa, Nematoda, Acanthocephala and Mollusca. Nematodes, the most numerous ones, were found in three host species. All the parasite species were new for the hosts examined; only the larvae of the acanthocephalan Corynosoma strumosum had already been recorded in one of the hosts (Chelidonichthys lucerna). The stomachs of almost all the fish examined were empty, but the species composition of the parasite fauna found showed that the fish must have ingested some food in the Pomeranian Bay...|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 546 <b>tub</b> <b>gurnard</b> (Chelidonichthys lucernus L., 1758) were caught monthly by trawl surveys carried out between September 1999 and August 2000 in İzmir Bay (Aegean Sea). Fork lengths of females ranged from 12. 7 to 34. 4 cm, and of males from 14. 1 to 29. 9 cm. The female: male ratio was 1 : 0. 52. The maximum age {{observed}} was 5 for females and 3 {{for males and}} the length-weight relationships were estimated as W= 0. 0051 *L 3. 245 and W= 0. 0053 *L 3. 237, respectively; the von Bertalanffy growth equations were Lt = 49. 09 (1 -e- 0. 186 (t+ 1. 484)); Lt = 31. 44 (1 -e- 0. 886 (t+ 0. 886)) and Lt = 52. 12 (1 -e- 0. 163 (t+ 1. 609)) for females, males and both sexes, respectively. The growth performance index value (Φ) was computed as 2. 646 for all specimens.

40|$|Background and Purpose: CYP 1 A {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{sensitive}} biomarkers in fish of exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). These compounds induce a dose-dependent transcriptional induction of the CYP 1 A gene that results in increased protein concentrations. The aim of this study was the detection of changes in CYP 1 A protein levels as a result of the exposure of fish to PAHs and PCBs at the mouth of the river Bojana in the spring. Materials and Methods: The PAH and PCB contents in seawater and sediment were determined by gas chromatography. CYP 1 A induction was examined in the hepatopancreas of Red mullet (Mullus barbatus), European hake (Merluccius merluccius) and <b>Tub</b> <b>gurnard</b> (Trigla lucerna) by immunoblot analysis. Results and Conclusions: Chemical analyses of seawater and sediment revealed the presence of several PAHs and PCBs. CYP 1 A was detected in the hepatic microsomal fraction in all examined fish species as an adaptive response to the presence of pollutants. The reported changes at the molecular level represent an early-warning signal that reflected the biological response of fish to elevated toxin concentrations in the environment...|$|E
40|$|The {{impact of}} the gillnet fishery on Merluccius merluccius (European hake) was {{investigated}} in the northern Tyrrhenian Sea, western Mediterranean. Four mesh sizes were tested: 53, 62. 5, 70 and 82 mm. Horse mackerel (Trachurus trachurus), hake and <b>tub</b> <b>gurnard</b> (Chelidonichthys lucerna) dominated the catches, from a minimum of 89 % (82 mm mesh) {{to a maximum of}} 97. 8 % (70 mm) of the biomass caught. Efficiency of the four meshes was not significantly different with respect to the total hake catches. Selectivity on M. merluccius was assessed by Sechin and SELECT methods. Tangling was an important catch modality for hake, as evidenced by the results of the Sechin model which described only the first mode of the size distributions corresponding to the entangled specimens. SELECT showed that the bi-modal function gave the best adjustment to the length-frequency distributions; the modal catch sizes were 33, 39. 2, 43. 6 and 51 cm total length respectively for the 53, 62. 5, 70 and 82 mm mesh sizes. Taking into account the size of first maturity for females (35. 1 cm TL), 62. 5 mm is the most adequate mesh for exploiting hake as it gives some protection to both immature specimens and large females...|$|E
40|$|For the seaward harbour {{extension}} of the Port of Rotterdam in the Netherlands, approximately 220 million m 3 sand was extracted between 2009 and 2013. In order to decrease the surface area of direct impact, the authorities permitted deep sand extraction, down to 20 m below the seabed. Biological and physical impacts of large-scale and deep sand extraction are still being investigated and largely unknown. For this reason, we investigated the colonization of demersal fish in a deep sand extraction site. Significant differences in demersal fish species assemblages in the sand extraction site were associated with variables such as water depth, median grain size, fraction of very fine sand, biomass of white furrow shell (Abra alba) and time after the cessation of sand extraction. Large quantities of undigested crushed white furrow shell fragments were found in all stomachs and intestines of plaice (Pleuronectes platessa), indicating {{that it is an}} important prey item. One and two years after cessation, a significant 20 -fold increase in demersal fish biomass was observed in deep parts of the extraction site. In the troughs of a landscaped sandbar however, a significant drop in biomass down to reference levels and a significant change in species assemblage was observed two years after cessation. The fish assemblage at the crests of the sandbars differed significantly from the troughs with <b>tub</b> <b>gurnard</b> (Chelidonichthys lucerna) being a Dufrêne-Legendre indicator species of the crests. This is a first indication of the applicability of landscaping techniques to induce heterogeneity of the seabed although it remains difficult to draw a strong conclusion due the lack of replication in the experiment. A new ecological equilibrium is not reached after 2 years since biotic and abiotic variables are still adapting.

Biological and physical impacts of large-scale and deep sand extraction are still being investigated and largely unknown. For this reason, we investigated the colonization of demersal fish in a deep sand extraction site. Two sandbars were artificially created by selective dredging, copying naturally occurring meso-scale bedforms to increase habitat heterogeneity and increasing post-dredging benthic and demersal fish species richness and biomass. Significant differences in demersal fish species assemblages in the sand extraction site were associated with variables such as water depth, median grain size, fraction of very fine sand, biomass of white furrow shell (Abra alba) and time after the cessation of sand extraction.

40|$|Several commercially {{important}} {{demersal fish}} stocks for the North Sea fisheries {{are classified as}} “category 11 ” {{in the light of}} the EU policy paper on fisheries management (17 May 2010, COM(2010) 241). For stocks in this category, there is no STECF (Scientific, technical and economic committee for fisheries) management advice, due to the unknown status of the stocks. The reason for this is that the data and information available to perform analytical stock assessments are highly uncertain or lacking. This document describes existing data and options for collecting new data for the evaluation of the state of category 11 stocks. We focus on turbot and brill in the North Sea. Existing data from logbooks and the market sampling program can be used to estimate LPUE series used in age-based stock assessment methods, similar to other commercially important flatfish species such as plaice and sole. Landings Per Unit of Effort (LPUE) data of the Dutch beam trawl fleet > 221 kW were standardised for engine power and corrected for targeting behaviour as described below and graphically shown in Figure 3. 2. 1. The methods are similar to those used to analyse commercial LPUE data for North Sea plaice, described in Quirijns and Poos (2010). Landing rates (LPUE) by market category were calculated for the period 2002 - 2010. The corrected LPUE series indicate an increase in commercial LPUE for both species during the period 2002 - 2006. For turbot, the LPUE stays stable in the first five years, increases between 2006 and 2008, and decreases afterwards. The increase in brill LPUE is larger, and occurs throughout the study period. Compared to other commercially important flatfish species relatively few brill and turbot market samples are taken. This reduces the ability to track the cohorts in the LPUE series of the older ages which is a prerequisite for reliable stock assessment estimates. Also, the time series currently spans only 9 years. Collection of additional data may therefore be desirable. Expanding the BTS survey will provide industry independent data and would therefore give easily interpretable results. The option of an industry survey is also a good option if the survey is already being executed for sole and plaice. However, both options are costly. Therefore, the option of increasing the samples of turbot and brill at the auction is relatively easy and relatively inexpensive and therefore at present the most promising. The methods used for this document will not per definition be applicable for all category 11 species. For dab, flounder, lemon sole and <b>tub</b> <b>gurnard,</b> samples at the auctions are taken to collect biological data. For these species it may be possible to raise the data in a similar way as was done in this report to estimate the age composition of the stock. For other species (witch flounder, horse mackerel, silver smelt, red mullet and squid) there is no market sampling. For these species, other methods will have to be developed...|$|E
