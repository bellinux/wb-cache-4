5|$|To {{the east}} of the house a series of {{terraces}} leads down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fish</b> Pond. The retaining walls {{at the southern end of}} the upper terrace are listed at GradeII, as are the retaining walls at the end of the upper terrace and the steps leading down to the middle terrace. Stretching along the middle terrace is a long rectangular pool containing a three fountains. The retaining walls of this pool are listed at GradeII, as are the railings on the north and the south side of the terrace. On each side of the pool are two compartments framed by yew hedges. Between these compartments, on each side, is a statue by Raymond Smith. Both of these were made in 1852 for the 2ndMarquess and are listed at GradeII. The one to the north depicts a stag at bay, and that to the south a hunter on a rearing horse.|$|E

25|$|If {{excessive}} {{salt water}} {{were allowed to}} migrate into Salmon Bay, the salt could eventually damage the freshwater ecosystem. To prevent this, a basin was dredged just above (east of) the large lock. The heavier salt water settles into the basin and drains through a pipe discharging downstream of the locks area. In 1975, the saltwater drain was modified to divert some salt water from the basin <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> ladder, where it is added via a diffuser <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> ladder attraction water; see below.|$|E
25|$|The first fishing of {{the season}} was {{accompanied}} by prescribed rituals and a ceremonial feast known as ″kooyit″.

25|$|Glochidia are {{generally}} species-specific, and will only live {{if they find}} the correct fish host. Once the larval mussels attach <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fish,</b> the fish body reacts to cover them with cells forming a cyst, where the glochidia remain for two to five weeks (depending on temperature). They grow, break free from the host, and drop {{to the bottom of}} the water to begin an independent life.|$|E
25|$|Vänern {{has many}} {{different}} fish species. Locals {{and government officials}} try to enforce fishing preservation projects, due to threats <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> habitat. These threats include water cultivation in the tributaries, pollution and the M74 syndrome. Sport fishing in Vänern is free and unregulated, both from the shore and from boats (with some restrictions, e.g. a maximum of three salmon or trout per person per day). Commercial fishing requires permission.|$|E
25|$|A major {{concept in}} the sport of fly fishing is that the fly imitates some form of fish prey when {{presented}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> by the angler. As aquatic insects such as Mayflies, Caddisflies and Stoneflies were the primary prey being imitated during the early developmental years of fly fishing, there were always differing schools of thought on how closely a fly needed to imitate the fish's prey.|$|E

25|$|Species such as {{shellfish}} that occupy intermediate trophic levels often play a dual role, both filtering organic bottom-level organisms {{from the}} water and generating some ammonia. Waste feed may also provide additional nutrients; either by direct consumption or via decomposition into individual nutrients. In some projects, the waste nutrients are also gathered and reused in the food given <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> in cultivation. This can happen by processing the seaweed grown into food.|$|E
25|$|Frankston's fishing {{industry}} was further developed {{with the assistance}} of Thomas McComb, who funded the construction of Frankston Pier in 1857. Following a petition by residents, to the Victorian colonial Department of Public Works, the pier was extended into deeper water in 1863. A gaslamp was installed {{at the end of the}} pier and a lamplighter was also employed. Frankston Fish Company was founded in 1867, by a consortium of local businessmen including Thomas Ritchie, in order to transport the catches of local fishermen in bulk <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> markets of the Melbourne city centre.|$|E

25|$|Bottom fishing has {{operated}} {{for over a}} century on heavily fished grounds such as the North Sea and Grand Banks. While overfishing has long been recognised as causing major ecological changes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> community on the Grand Banks, concern has been raised more recently about the damage which benthic trawling inflicts upon seabed communities. A species of particular concern is the slow growing, deep water coral Lophelia pertusa. This species is home to a diverse community of deep sea organisms, but is easily damaged by fishing gear. On 17 November 2004, the United Nations General Assembly urged nations to consider temporary bans on high seas bottom trawling.|$|E
25|$|The {{material}} {{used for}} the rod itself changed from the heavy woods native to England, to lighter and more elastic varieties imported from abroad, especially from South America and the West Indies. Bamboo rods became the generally favoured option from the mid 19th century, and several strips of the material were cut from the cane, milled into shape, and then glued together to form light, strong, hexagonal rods with a solid core that were superior to anything that preceded them. George Cotton and his predecessors fished their flies with long rods, and light lines allowing the wind to {{do most of the}} work of getting the fly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fish.</b>|$|E
25|$|Bennett {{studied the}} Pteranodon remains curated by the Yale Peabody Museum. His {{research}} debunked several claims originally made by O. C. Marsh. The teeth Marsh originally referred to Pteranodon Bennett attributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> genus Xiphactinus. Bennet {{also argued that}} none of the Pteranodon species Marsh named after P. longiceps were actually distinct from it. Bennett criticized conclusions drawn by Miller and Harksen as well. Bennett criticized the former's 1971 classification scheme for Pteranodon species and the latter's 1966 reconstruction of Pteranodon sternbergi as having excessively long jaws. Nyctosaurus also received some attention in this paper. Bennett concluded that N. bonneri was a junior synonym of N. gracilis.|$|E

25|$|The plot {{centers on}} a {{conflict}} between Jonah and God. God calls Jonah to proclaim judgment to Nineveh, but Jonah resists and attempts to flee. He goes to Joppa and boards a ship bound for Tarshish. God calls up a great storm at sea, and, at Jonah's insistence, the ship's crew reluctantly cast Jonah overboard {{in an attempt to}} appease God. A great sea creature, sent by God, swallows Jonah. For three days and three nights Jonah languishes inside the fish's belly. He says a prayer in which he repents for his disobedience and thanks God for His mercy. God speaks <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fish,</b> which vomits out Jonah safely on dry land.|$|E
25|$|The Fishes {{are also}} {{associated}} with the German legend of Antenteh, who owned just a tub and a crude cabin when he met a magical fish. They offered him a wish, which he refused. However, his wife begged him to return <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> {{and ask for a}} beautiful furnished home. This wish was granted, but her desires were not satisfied. She then asked to be a queen and have a palace, but when she asked to become a goddess, the fish became angry and took the palace and home, leaving the couple with the tub and cabin once again. The tub in the story is sometimes recognized as the Great Square of Pegasus.|$|E
