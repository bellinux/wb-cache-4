Nethicite {{can be described as}} either deifacted or manufacted (literally, god-made or man-made). During the course of the game, it is discovered that deifacted nethicite is nethicite created by the Occuria, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>ultimate</b> source of known pieces of deifacted nethicite is the Sun-Cryst they created. Deifacted nethicite contains a large amount of magic and is known to influence the history of Ivalice.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{started in}} June 2017 to extend Tonkin Highway north, past Ellenbrook {{and through the}} Swan Valley to Brand Highway and Great Northern Highway in Muchea. Interchanges are planned at {{junctions}} with Reid Highway, Hepburn Avenue and Beechboro Road North, Gnangara Road, The Promenade, Stock Road, Neaves road and Brand Highway and Great Northern Highway. The 3rd stage was originally planned to be a 2 lane single-carriageway road with at-grade intersections, with provision for upgrading in the future, but in the end, it was decided <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>ultimate</b> plan with a 4 lane dual-carriageway was to go ahead. The previously planned route of the PDNH, prior to 2012, followed Lord Street, east of Whiteman Park. Construction is due to be completed mid 2019.|$|E
5|$|Peasants {{and their}} {{supporters}} advocated the notion that each family was supposed to receive at least four hectares of land; in their system, which made note of differences in local traditional, peasants living in wetlands were to be assigned 16 pogoane (approx. eight hectares), those living in plains 14 (approx. seven hectares), inhabitants of hilly areas 11 (between five and six hectares), while people inhabiting the Southern Carpathian areas were supposed to receive eight pogoane (approx. four hectares). This program was instantly rejected by many landowners, and the negotiations were ended through a decision taken by Heliade Rădulescu, when it was again decided <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>ultimate</b> resolution was a prerogative of the future Assembly. The failure to address this most significant of the problems faced by Wallachians contributed to weakening support for the revolutionary cause.|$|E

5|$|A {{designer}} named Tateaki Koshiki steps forward, {{claiming he}} developed the Solid State system before committing suicide. Kusanagi dives into his cyberbrain and into Koshiki's trap, allowing him to hack her cyberbrain. The Puppeteer reveals that he was spread across several egos until a collective consciousness emerged and developed into a Solid State, allowing him {{to move into the}} society beyond as the vanishing mediator. Later, Batou tells a recovering Kusanagi that the real Tateaki Koshiki used a cybernetic body and built the Solid State after he was hired by Munei. Kusanagi does not reveal that the Puppeteer was a fragment of herself, but Batou already knew from being linked to her during the dive. Batou concludes <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>ultimate</b> identity of the Puppeteer will remain unknown and that incident will be written off as a scandal.|$|E
5|$|Lucas {{revisited}} {{the scene}} in the 1997 Special Edition release of A New Hope, restoring the sequence and replacing Mulholland with a CGI version of Jabba the Hutt and the English dialogue with Huttese, a fictional language created by sound designer Ben Burtt. Joseph Letteri, the visual effects supervisor for the Special Edition, explained <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>ultimate</b> goal of the revised scene was to make it look as if Jabba the Hutt was actually on the set talking to and acting with Harrison Ford and that the crew had merely photographed it. Letteri stated that the new scene consisted of five shots that took over a year to complete. The scene was polished further for the 2004 release on DVD, improving Jabba's appearance with advancements in CGI techniques, although neither release looks exactly like the original Jabba the Hutt puppet.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} of process theology has challenged the Irenaean tradition by teaching that God's power is limited {{and that he}} cannot be responsible for evil. Twentieth century philosopher Alvin Plantinga supported {{the idea that this}} world is the best possible world, arguing that the good in the world (including God's infinite goodness) outweighs the evil and proposing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>ultimate</b> good of God's sacrifice when Jesus was crucified necessitated the existence of evil. His free will defence was not a theodicy because he was trying to show the logical compatibility of evil and the existence of God, rather than the probability of God. D. Z. Phillips and Fyodor Dostoyevsky challenged the instrumental use of suffering, suggesting that love cannot be expressed through suffering. However, Dostoyevsky also states that the beauty of love is evident, in that love can continue to grow, withstand and overcome even the most evil acts. Michael Tooley argued that the magnitude of suffering is excessive and that, in some cases, cannot lead to moral development. French theologian Henri Blocher criticised Hick's universalism, arguing that such a view negates free will, which was similarly important to the theodicy.|$|E

40|$|Panpsychism harbors an {{unresolved}} tension, {{the seriousness}} of which {{has yet to be}} fully appreciated. I capture this tension as a dilemma, and offer panpsychists advice on how to resolve it. The dilemma, briefly, is as follows. Panpsychists are committed to the perspicuous explanation of macro-mentality in terms of micro-mentality. But panpsychists take the micro-material realm to feature not just mental properties, but also micro-subjects to whom these properties belong. Yet it is impossible to explain the constitution of a macro-subject (like one of us) in terms of the assembly of micro-subjects, for, I show, subjects cannot combine. Therefore the panpsychist explanatory project is derailed by <b>the</b> insistence <b>that</b> <b>the</b> world???s <b>ultimate</b> material constituents (ultimates) are subjects of experience. The panpsychist faces a choice of abandoning her explanatory project, or recanting <b>the</b> claim <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>ultimates</b> are subjects. This is the dilemma. I argue <b>that</b> <b>the</b> latter option is to be preferred. This needn???t constitute a wholesale abandonment of panpsychism, however, since panpsychists can maintain <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>ultimates</b> possess phenomenal qualities, despite not being subjects of those qualities. This proposal requires us to make sense of phenomenal qualities existing independently of experiencing subjects, a challenge I tackle in the penultimate section. The position eventually reached is a form of neutral monism, so another way to express the overall argument is to say that, keeping true to their philosophical motivations, panpsychists should really be neutral monists...|$|R

25|$|Russell {{claimed that}} he was more {{convinced}} of his method of doing philosophy than of his philosophical conclusions. Science was one of the principal components of analysis.

He believed the same was true of philosophy. Russell held <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>ultimate</b> objective of both science and philosophy was to understand reality, not simply to make predictions.|$|E
25|$|The idea <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>ultimate</b> good {{exists and}} is not orderable but is {{globally}} measurable is reflected in various ways in economic (classical economics, green economics, welfare economics, gross national happiness) and scientific (positive psychology, the science of morality) well-being measuring theories, all of which focus on various ways of assessing progress towards that goal, a so-called genuine progress indicator. Modern economics thus reflects very ancient philosophy, but a calculation or quantitative or other process based on cardinality and statistics replaces the simple ordering of values.|$|E
