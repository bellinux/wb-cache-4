40|$|High {{performance}} neutron {{sources are}} being proposed for many scientific and industrial applications, ranging from material studies, hybrid reactors and <b>transmutation</b> <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>wastes.</b> In the case <b>of</b> <b>transmutation</b> <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>wastes,</b> accelerator driven systems (ADS) are {{considered as one}} of the main technical options for such purpose. In ADS a high performance spallation neutron source becomes an essential element for its operation and control. This spallation source must fulfil very challenging nuclear and thermo-mechanical requirements, because of the high neutron rates needed in ADS. The material selection for this key component becomes of paramount importance, particularly the source window that separates the vacuum accelerator tube from the spallation material where the accelerated protons impinge. In this paper, an integral analysis of spallation sources is done, taking as a reference the projects in this field proposal in the framework of European projects. Our analysis and calculations show that titanium and vanadium alloys are more suitable than steel as structural material for an industrial ADS beam window, mostly due to its irradiation damage resistance...|$|R

However, the costs for construction, safety and maintenance of such complex installations are expected to be very high, let alone the amount of research needed to develop a practical design (see above).

However, the solution of a subcritical reactor might be favoured for a better public acceptance [...] - [...] it is considered more acceptable to burn the waste than to bury it {{for hundreds of thousands of}} years.

5000|$|Fast neutron {{reactors}} {{can reduce}} the total radiotoxicity of nuclear waste, and dramatically reduce the waste's lifetime. They can also use all or {{almost all of the}} fuel in the waste. Fast neutrons have an advantage in the <b>transmutation</b> <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>waste.</b> With fast neutrons, the ratio between splitting and the capture of neutrons of plutonium or minor actinide is often larger than when the neutrons are slower, at thermal or near-thermal [...] "epithermal" [...] speeds. The transmuted odd-numbered actinides (e.g. from Pu-240 to Pu-241) split more easily. After they split, the actinides become a pair of [...] "fission products." [...] These elements have less total radiotoxicity. Since disposal of the fission products is dominated by the most radiotoxic fission product, cesium-137, which has a half life of 30.1 years, the result is to reduce nuclear waste lifetimes from tens of millennia (from transuranic isotopes) to a few centuries. The processes are not perfect, but the remaining transuranics are reduced from a significant problem to a tiny percentage of the total waste, because most transuranics can be used as fuel.|$|E

In this work we will assess where we stand on these neutron-capture cross section measurements {{and how we can}} achieve the short-lived Minor Actinides nuclei involved in the nuclear fuel cycle. The CENBG collaboration applied the surrogate method to determine the neutron-capture cross section of 233 Pa(T 1 / 2 = 27 d). The 233 Pa (n,γ) cross section is then deduced from the measured gamma decay probability of 234 Pa compound nucleus formed via the surrogate 232 Th(3 He,p) reaction channel. The obtained cross section data, covering the neutron energy range 0. 1 to 1 MeV, have been compared with the predictions of the Hauser-Feshbach statistical model.
