5|$|Best was {{studying}} at the Collegiate Grammar School {{when he decided}} he wanted to be in a music group, so Mona bought him a drum kit from Blackler's music store and Best formed his own band; The Black Jacks, who later played in The Casbah. Chas Newby joined the group, as did Ken Brown, but only after he had left The Quarrymen. The reason for Brown's exit from the group was that he turned up on the seventh Saturday night of The Quarrymen residency at The Casbah with the flu, so Mona ordered him upstairs to the Best's living room to rest. This caused a massive quarrel {{with the rest of the}} group when Mona came to pay them, as they wanted Brown's money to be shared amongst <b>the</b> <b>three</b> <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> as Brown had not played. Mona refused, so The Quarrymen angrily cancelled their residency and stormed out.|$|E

5|$|Contador faced {{repeated}} {{challenges from}} Riccardo Riccò and Danilo Di Luca in the race's final week. They {{were separated by}} {{less than a minute}} after stage 15, and though Di Luca would falter slightly in the Giro's second individual time trial, the time gap among <b>the</b> <b>three</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> was just 21 seconds heading in to the Giro's final mountain stage.

The name meant that the group would contain a revolving cast of non-permanent members getting on and off the stage like a musical roundabout, with only Curtis as mainstay and singer.

5|$|Gaara's initial attire, {{along with}} the costumes of his siblings, was {{difficult}} for Kishimoto to draw on a weekly basis. Because of this, Kishimoto gave <b>the</b> <b>three</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> simpler costumes {{towards the end of}} Part I; Gaara received an outfit with an upright collar. In addition to being easier to draw, it was used to demonstrate the change in relationship between Gaara and Naruto following their previous fight. Kishimoto cites The Matrix, one of his favorite movies, as an inspiration for Gaara's new costume, and he considers it to be his favorite costume of the three siblings. For Part II, there was a scene where an antagonist Deidara was sitting on Gaara's body. This shot was inspired by Akira, a manga by Katsuhiro Otomo that Kishimoto was a fan of.|$|E

5|$|Henry Fuseli {{would later}} create {{one of the}} more famous portrayals of the Three Witches in 1783, {{entitled}} The Weird Sisters or The Three Witches. In it, the witches are lined up and dramatically pointing at something all at once, their faces in profile. This painting was parodied by James Gillray in 1791 in Weird Sisters; Ministers of Darkness; Minions of the Moon. Three figures are lined up with their faces in profile in a way similar to Fuseli's painting. However, the three figures are recognisable as Lord Dundas (the home secretary at the time), William Pitt (prime minister), and Lord Thurlow (Lord Chancellor). <b>The</b> <b>three</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> are facing a moon, which contains the profiled faces of George III and Queen Charlotte.

In May 1959 Fleming, Bryce, Cuneo and McClory met first at Bryce's Essex house and then in McClory's London home as they came up with a story outline which was based on an aeroplane full of celebrities and a female lead called Fatima Blush. McClory was fascinated by the underwater world and wanted to make a film that included it. Over the next few months, as the story changed, there were ten outlines, treatments and scripts. Numerous titles were proposed for these works, including SPECTRE, James Bond of the Secret Service and Longitude 78 West.|$|E
