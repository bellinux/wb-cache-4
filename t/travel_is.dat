5|$|Air <b>travel</b> <b>is</b> {{discouraged}} for up {{to seven}} days after complete resolution of a pneumothorax if recurrence does not occur. Underwater diving is considered unsafe after an episode of pneumothorax unless a preventative procedure has been performed. Professional guidelines suggest that pleurectomy be performed on both lungs and that lung function tests and CT scan normalize before diving is resumed. Aircraft pilots may also require assessment for surgery.|$|E

Photographer Terry Evans, a Chicagoan, says that although 90% of the photographs were taken while in a helicopter, her preferred method of <b>travel</b> <b>is</b> hot air balloon, but Chicago was usually too windy to shoot by balloon.|$|E
5|$|Space <b>Travel</b> <b>is</b> {{an early}} video game {{developed}} by Ken Thompson in 1969 that simulates {{travel in the}} solar system. The player flies their ship around a two-dimensional scale model {{of the solar system}} with no objectives other than to attempt to land on various planets and moons. The player can move and turn the ship, and adjust the overall speed by adjusting the scale of the simulation. The ship is affected by the single strongest gravitational pull of the astronomical bodies.|$|E
5|$|The {{ring-tailed lemur}} is diurnal and semi-{{terrestrial}}. It {{is the most}} terrestrial of lemur species, spending as much as 33% of its time on the ground. However it is still considerably arboreal, spending 23% of its time in the mid-level canopy, 25% in the upper-level canopy, 6% in the emergent layer and 13% in small bushes.

5|$|The {{system is}} {{split into two}} parts, with lines north of Boston having a {{terminus}} at North Station and lines south of Boston having a terminus at South Station. There is no direct {{connection between the two}} stations, but <b>travel</b> <b>is</b> made possible by transferring to the MBTA's subway system (although this requires an intermediate transfer at either Park Street or Downtown Crossing) or the 4 bus. This lack of direct connection could be alleviated by the proposed (but currently shelved) North–South Rail Link, which would build a tunnel connecting the two terminals.|$|E
5|$|The village's {{transportation}} system includes highways, streets, and a rail line; its {{low population density}} favors automobiles. Briarcliff Manor is accessible by the controlled-access Taconic State Parkway; {{it can also be}} reached by U.S. Route 9, New York State Route 9A and New York State Route 100, which traverse the village north to south. East-west <b>travel</b> <b>is</b> more difficult; Long Hill, Pine, Elm, and Scarborough Roads are narrow, winding, and hilly. Routes 9 and 9A are the most heavily traversed roadways in the village.|$|E

5|$|Wet snow {{avalanches}} are a low-velocity {{suspension of}} snow and water, with the flow confined {{to the surface of}} the pathway. The low speed of <b>travel</b> <b>is</b> due to the friction between the sliding surface of the pathway and the water saturated flow. Despite the low speed of travel (~), wet snow avalanches are capable of generating powerful destructive forces, due to the large mass, and density.|$|E
5|$|When winter storms hit, {{bringing}} with them combinations of precipitation that making driving difficult and sometimes dangerous, moviegoers often prefer to stay home.

5|$|In Final Fantasy XIII-2, a 24-year-old Hope is {{leader of}} the {{scientific}} expedition group known as the Academy {{a decade after the}} events of Final Fantasy XIII. He helps Noel and Serah in their journey to find Lightning when they arrive in his time. Other than knowing that time <b>travel</b> <b>is</b> possible and wishing to undo events of the past, Hope is planning on reviving Cocoon with a different power source. Originally planning to create an artificial fal'Cie, he is dissuaded upon seeing a vision of Serah fighting his creation. He and his assistant Alyssa Zaidelle then use a time capsule to go 387 years into the future to oversee Hope's New Cocoon Project, a plan to build a man-made Cocoon in preparation for Cocoon's destined fall in the next century. When the old Cocoon does fall, Hope and Sazh manage to rescue Vanille and Fang from the crystal pillar before it crumbles.|$|E
5|$|The Naturalist on the River Amazons, subtitled A Record of the Adventures, Habits of Animals, Sketches of Brazilian and Indian Life, and Aspects of Nature {{under the}} Equator, during Eleven Years of <b>Travel,</b> <b>is</b> an 1863 book by the British naturalist Henry Walter Bates about his {{expedition}} to the Amazon basin. Bates and his friend Alfred Russel Wallace set out to obtain new species and new evidence for evolution by natural selection, as well as exotic specimens to sell. He explored {{thousands of miles of}} the Amazon and its tributaries, and collected over 14,000 species, of which 8,000 were new to science. His observations of the coloration of butterflies led him to discover Batesian mimicry.|$|E
5|$|The game spans six levels, each lasting {{about five}} minutes, {{with a variety}} of boss battles. Over the course of the game, the plot is {{revealed}} through cutscenes using the game's own graphic engine. Gameplay consists of a player controlling a flying dragon and his rider through an aiming reticle that can be moved over the whole screen with the D-pad; the player must shoot a variety of enemies (ranging from machines to monsters) in a 3D post-apocalyptic fantasy environment of barren landscapes and mysterious ruins of a fallen civilization. Progression through the levels is made at a predetermined pace, as the player is constantly set along a rail of gameplay. The only time the game pauses is during boss battles. The field of vision can be directed with the aiming reticle on the x and y-axis, but the overall direction of <b>travel</b> <b>is</b> predetermined. The dragon follows the reticle movements, allowing the player to avoid enemy projectiles and obstacles.|$|E

5|$|Mass Effect 2 is set {{within the}} Milky Way galaxy during the 22nd century where {{interstellar}} <b>travel</b> <b>is</b> possible {{through the use}} of mass transit devices called Mass Relays, a technology believed to have been built by an extinct alien race known as the Protheans. A conglomerate body of governments known as the Citadel Council controls {{a large percentage of the}} galaxy and is responsible for maintaining law and order among races of the galactic community. Races that belong to the Citadel Council include humans, asari, salarians and turians. Other alien races seen in the game include the reptilian krogan and drell, the environmental suited quarians, and a hostile race of networked artificial intelligences called geth. During the events of the original Mass Effect, a geth army attempted to open a portal for the Reapers, a highly advanced machine race of synthetic-organic starships that are believed to eradicate all organic civilization every 50,000 years. The galactic community has since lived in fear of another possible invasion. Meanwhile, a human supremacist organization called Cerberus believes that humans deserve a greater role in the galactic community and supports the principle that any methods of advancing humanity's ascension are entirely justified, including illegal experimentation and terrorist activities.|$|E
5|$|Space <b>Travel</b> <b>is</b> a spaceflight {{simulation}} video game, {{presented in}} a two-dimensional top-down view, with monochrome graphics consisting of white lines on a black background. In it, the player controls a spaceship as it flies through {{a representation of the}} solar system. The game has no specific objectives, other than to attempt to land on the various planets and moons of the system. The planets and most of the moons in the solar system are represented to scale both in size and distance from each other, though the orbits are simplified to be circles. To land on a body, the player's ship must cross the line representing the surface while moving at a low enough speed. The player is able to control the ship to go forwards and backwards and turn. The ship moves at a constant level of acceleration relative to the scale of the screen, which the player can control; scaling the screen up high enough allows the player to travel across the solar system in seconds, though they risk overshooting their target and becoming unable to find the solar system again, and scaling down allows the player to be moving slowly enough to land. The ship is always {{in the center of the}} screen, facing the top; turning the ship right or left therefore rotates the solar system around the ship instead.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} recognises {{that there}} are no viable alternative aviation fuels, and whilst it accepts that the exemption of aviation fuel from fuel tax is anomalous, it sees no scope for a unilateral approach in addressing this. The strategy adopted in the White Paper seeks to mitigate the global impact of air transport primarily through emissions trading schemes. Although the Kyoto Protocol implemented emissions trading as a means to reduce emissions at national levels, the global nature of air transport means that all air <b>travel</b> <b>is</b> excluded from this mechanism. The government is seeking to redress this through the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), which has been working on the environmental issue since 1998, but progress is slow. In the meantime efforts are being made to include aviation in the EU Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS) with an original target to implement this by 2008. In 2006 the government re-affirmed this policy as the best approach for addressing the climate change impacts of aviation, and current proposals aim at accomplishing this for all flights within the EU by 2011, with the scheme being extended to include all flights to and from the EU the following year.|$|E
