5|$|The first sod was <b>turned</b> <b>at</b> Galashiels on 3 March 2010, when Scottish {{transport}} minister Stewart Stevenson {{attended a}} ceremony {{in the presence}} of campaigner Madge Elliot. This triggered a clause in the 2006 Waverley Railway Act, which committed the Scottish Government to complete the line to Tweedbank once works had been commenced.|$|E
5|$|Two unassisted triple plays were <b>turned</b> <b>at</b> Forbes Field. The {{first took}} place on May 7, 1925, when Pittsburgh's Glenn Wright {{achieved}} the feat.

5|$|The tunnel {{was officially}} opened on 30 May 1980 by Minister of Transport and Communications Ronald Bye and officially taken into use on 1 June. The tunnel, {{including}} Nationaltheatret, cost NOK 625 million Norwegian krone (NOK), of which Oslo Municipality had paid NOK170 million. At first, {{the tunnel and}} Nationaltheatret was used by commuter trains from Lillestrøm to Drammen and Spikkestad, and trains from Eidsvoll and Årnes used the tunnel and <b>turned</b> <b>at</b> Skøyen. On 27 May 1989, OsloV was closed and all traffic started running via Nationaltheatret.|$|E

5|$|At the time, Akersbanerne {{was working}} on {{building}} the Lambertseter Line, which is located further east in Aker. This caused an uproar amongst the residents in the Ekeberg area, who wanted the Ekeberg Line extended, in {{what became known as}} the thousand meter, before the construction of the Lambertseter Line. The municipality therefore granted free municipal land and a grant of NOK50,000 for expropriation. Construction started in July 1940, after having been delayed by the German occupation of Norway. The construction included a new double track from Holtet to Bråten. During the construction at Sæter, the trams <b>turned</b> <b>at</b> Bråten and backed to Sæter, where they used the turning loop. The thousand meter extension to Ljabru opened on 17 September 1941.|$|E
5|$|The tunnel {{was officially}} opened on 30 May 1980 by Minister of Transport and Communications, Ronald Bye, and officially taken into use on 1 June. When it opened, {{it was the}} eighth-longest railway tunnel in Norway, {{although}} since 2005 {{it has been the}} thirteenth-longest. The tunnel cost 625million Norwegian krone(NOK), of which Oslo Municipality had paid NOK170million. At first, the tunnel was used by commuter trains from Lillestrøm to Drammen and Spikkestad, and trains from Eidsvoll and Årnes used the tunnel and <b>turned</b> <b>at</b> Skøyen. Oslo Central Station was taken into use on 26 November 1986. On 27 May 1989, Oslo West Station was closed and all traffic transferred to OsloS.|$|E
5|$|During the American Civil War (18611865), cavalry {{held the}} most {{important}} and respected role it would ever hold in the American military. Field artillery in the American Civil War was also highly mobile. Both horses and mules pulled the guns, though only horses were used on the battlefield. At the beginning of the war, most of the experienced cavalry officers were from the South and thus joined the Confederacy, leading to the Confederate Army's initial battlefield superiority. The tide <b>turned</b> <b>at</b> the 1863 Battle of Brandy Station, part of the Gettysburg campaign, where the Union cavalry, in the largest cavalry battle ever fought on the American continent, ended the dominance of the South. By 1865, Union cavalry were decisive in achieving victory. So important were horses to individual soldiers that the surrender terms at Appomattox allowed every Confederate cavalryman to take his horse home with him. This was because, unlike their Union counterparts, Confederate cavalrymen provided their own horses for service instead of drawing them from the government.|$|E

5|$|When Thorpe {{broke the}} 200m {{freestyle}} Olympic {{record in the}} heats the following morning, his main rival Pieter van den Hoogenband of the Netherlands (with World No. 2 ranked and teammate Michael Kim bypassing the 200 metres) conceded defeat. However, van den Hoogenband showed {{his hand in the}} semi-finals by cutting more than a second off his personal best, to set a new world record of 1min 45.35s. Thorpe qualified second with a personal best of his own, 0.02s slower, and was under immense pressure to win the final the following day after his double gold on the first night. Van den Hoogenband started quickly and Thorpe chased him, reaching the 100m mark just 0.04s behind. Both swimmers <b>turned</b> <b>at</b> 150m in identical times. As a result of starting harder than usual, Thorpe faded as van den Hoogenband drew away to claim gold and equal his world record, stunning the home crowd. Thorpe touched in 1min 45.83s, {{the first time that he}} had swum slower in the final than in the qualifying rounds. Thorpe though would never again lose to Van Den Hoogenband in a long course 200 metres race again. Thorpe returned to victory when he led off the 4×200m freestyle relay the following night, setting up a 10m lead over American Scott Goldblatt in the first leg. Although Thorpe was unable to reclaim the individual world record, he, Klim, Kirby and Todd Pearson lowered their world record to 7min 07.05s, over five seconds ahead of the Americans—the largest winning margin in an Olympic relay for half a century. Thorpe rounded off his Olympics by swimming in the heats of the 4×100m medley relay, and collected a silver medal when the finals quartet finished behind the Americans. Thorpe's performances as Australia's leading medalist for the Games were recognised when the Australian Olympic Committee granted him the honour of carrying the flag at the closing ceremony. With three gold and two silver medals, Thorpe was the most successful athlete at the 2000 Olympic Games. At year's end, he was again named by Swimming Australia as the Swimmer of the Year, but van den Hoogenband usurped him as the leading male swimmer chosen by Swimming World Magazine.|$|E

5000|$|Two-player [...] (or larger) teams compete by {{alternating}} {{teams and}} alternating players within each team. For example, if teams consist of players 1 and 2 versus players 3 and 4, and player 1 breaks, turns alternate {{in the pattern}} 1 (breaking), 3, 2, 4, 1, 3, 2, 4, etc. I.e., the ending of a player's <b>turn</b> <b>at</b> the table ends that team's <b>turn</b> <b>at</b> the table.

25|$|Translation: In this year, they (the Vikings) visited Devonshire and at {{the mouth}} of the Severn, pillaging in Cornwall, Devon and Wales. They went to Watchet, and there caused much damage by dint of arson and {{wholesale}} slaughter.

25|$|The Vulcan railcars had a driver's {{compartment}} at each end, so {{they did}} not need to be <b>turned</b> <b>at</b> the terminus for the return journey. They originally had 28 and 22 seats in the two passenger compartments. In the mid-1950s the smaller compartment in each vehicle was reduced by 2 seats and replaced with a small guard's compartment, thus reducing the total number of passengers from 50 to 48. A luggage compartment had space for about 1 ton of luggage, and an onboard toilet was provided.|$|E

25|$|The {{convertiplane}} {{featured a}} single Continental-built R-975 radial piston engine that powered twin air compressors. The compressors pumped air via ducts {{to the main}} rotor for vertical flight, while the engine drove the two-bladed pusher propeller for horizontal flight. During forward flight the wing provided 80% of the lift with the remainder generated by the main rotor autorotating at about 50% of normal rpm. When in hover mode, the rotor <b>turned</b> <b>at</b> 410 RPM but slowed to 180 RPM for high-speed flight above 125 knots.|$|E

Bush again led all American League players with 703 plate {{appearances}} and 504 assists and was again among the league leaders with 118 bases on balls (2nd), 99 runs (6th), 35 stolen bases (8th), 340 putouts at shortstop (2nd), 61 double plays <b>turned</b> <b>at</b> shortstop (2nd), 5.45 range factor at shortstop (2nd), and 57 errors (2nd).|$|E
25|$|With {{the line}} closing in Bærum {{there came a}} series of protests. A main {{political}} concern was the increased traffic and congestion on the highways. The tramway continued to run to Jar, and therefore an extension of this service along the Kolsås Line was called for. After small investments were made the tram to Jar was extended to Bekkestua on 20 August 2007. The unidirectional SL79 trams had to run to Avløs to turn around, although they did not operate revenue services on the last leg, while SL95 trams <b>turned</b> <b>at</b> Bekkestua. The last day with a tram service was 15 February, after which the tram service was cut at Lilleaker.|$|E

25|$|Deliveries to {{operational}} units began in August 1917. Jasta 10 {{was the first}} recipient of the new aircraft, followed by Jasta 4. While markedly better than the earlier Roland designs, the D.III was generally considered inferior to the Albatros D.III and D.V. German pilots variously criticized the Pfalz’s heavy controls, low speed, lack of power, or low rate of climb compared to the Albatros. The D.III slipped in turns, leading to crashes when unwary pilots <b>turned</b> <b>at</b> very low altitudes. Moreover, the Pfalz stalled sharply and spun readily. Recovery from the resulting flat spin was difficult, though some pilots took advantage of this trait to descend quickly or evade enemy aircraft.|$|E
25|$|In a south-pointing chariot, {{according}} to the hypothesis, Shaft B was connected to one road wheel and Shaft C was connected through a direction-reversing gear to the other road wheel. This made Shaft A rotate at a speed that was proportional {{to the difference between}} the rotation speeds of the two wheels. The pointing doll was connected (possibly through intermediate gears) to Shaft A. When the chariot moved in a straight line, the two wheels <b>turned</b> <b>at</b> equal speeds, and the doll did not rotate. When the chariot turned, the wheels rotated at different speeds (for the same reason as in an automobile), so the differential caused the doll to rotate, compensating for the turning of the chariot.|$|E
25|$|Formerly, the Fourth Avenue Line served trains {{from the}} BMT Culver Line, which {{connected}} to the 36th Street station via the lower level of the Ninth Avenue station south of Green-Wood Cemetery from a now-demolished elevated structure. Following the connection of the Culver Line to the South Brooklyn Line of the IND on October 30, 1954, this service <b>turned</b> <b>at</b> Ditmas Avenue instead. Later on, service via the BMT Culver Line was cut {{back to being a}} shuttle that ran between Ditmas Avenue and Ninth Avenue. Shuttle service ended in 1975, with homes and housing developments erected over the right-of-way of the two demolished stations in the 1980s and again in the 2010s. The barest stub of the old elevated line is still visible at Ditmas Avenue.|$|E
