She never allowed herself to enter a house by the back or side door, so now she went to the front, where, disappointed at not seeing any of the family although she had made good use of her eyes, she was obliged to ask a servant to conduct her to Mrs. Blynn.

60|$|We {{shall not}} say it was an {{accident}} that brought Paul and Eve side by side, and a little separated from the others; for a secret sympathy had certainly exercised its influence over both, and probably contributed as much as any thing else towards bringing about the circumstance. Although the Wigwam stood in the centre of the village, its grounds covered several acres, and were intersected with winding walks, and ornamented with shrubbery, in the well-known English style, improvements also of John Effingham; for, while the climate and forests of America offer so many inducements to encourage landscape gardening, it is the branch of art that, of all the other ornamental arts, is perhaps the least known in this country. It is true, time had not yet brought the labours of the projector to perfection, in this instance; but enough had been done to afford very extensive, varied, and pleasing walks. The grounds were broken, and John Effingham had turned the irregularities to good account, by planting and leading paths among them, to the great amusement of the lookers-on, however, who, like true disciples of the Manhattanese economy, had already begun <b>to</b> <b>calculate</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of what they termed grading the lawns, it being with them as much a matter of course to bring pleasure grounds down to a mathematical surface, as to bring a rail-road route down to the proper level.|$|E

50|$|An Ankanam is {{a unit of}} measure {{similar to}} an acre. It is used mainly in regions of Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, India - Nellore, Anekal, Bengaluru and Tirupathi. An Ankanam is {{measured}} as 72 sq ft, (mostly in the Nellore District) and, in some places (such as Tirupathi), 36 sq ft. In Nellore, one acre equals 605 Ankanams, and 1 cent amounts to 6.05 Ankanams. This unit is very popular, presumably because it is easier <b>to</b> <b>calculate</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> {{of a piece of}} land.|$|E
50|$|An EPC {{gives an}} {{indication}} of the energy efficiency of a dwelling.
