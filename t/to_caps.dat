60|$|A fair {{comparison}} between the French women {{of the seventeenth century}} and those of the eighteenth would, perhaps, have a balanced result, though it is common to be a partisan on this subject.

The women of the seventeenth century, when love was on the wane, took to devotion, at first mildly and by halves, as English women take <b>to</b> <b>caps,</b> and finally without compromise; with the women of the eighteenth century, Bossuet and Massillon had given way to Voltaire and Rousseau; and when youth and beauty failed, then they were thrown on their own moral strength.|$|E
