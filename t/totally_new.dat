5|$|After {{the birth}} of her son, Aguilera stated in an {{interview}} with Ryan Seacrest that her forthcoming album would include a <b>totally</b> <b>new</b> aspect of herself as an artist, because of the pregnancy with her son. During an interview with People in 2008, Aguilera stated {{that she was going to}} start recording new material for her forthcoming album at her home in Beverly Hills. On the album, entitled Bionic, Aguilera was inspired by electronic and electronica music, which she heard a lot during her pregnancy.|$|E
5|$|From {{the outset}} the Jaguar was {{equipped}} with a navigation and attack system. While A versions had a reliable double gyroscopic system and a Doppler radar derived from the Mirage IIIE, the GR1s had a <b>totally</b> <b>new</b> digital system with an inertial navigation system and a heads-up display, plus a LRMTS (Laser Ranging and Marked Targeting System) in the nose. These systems were a step above the current technology of the time, but reliability was quite low.|$|E
5|$|At a temple, which Meera visits as {{her daily}} ritual, Zeenat makes her first contact. Zeenat is {{too afraid to}} tell Meera {{the truth about the}} situation, and she does not reveal who she is or why she has come. Over a few weeks, they become good friends and spend most of the time together. Their {{friendship}} brings out the missing part in each of their personalities. In the process, Zeenat realizes helplessness; this is <b>totally</b> <b>new</b> to her forthright way of thinking. Meera, on the other hand, gets a glimpse of freedom; this brings her out of the shell of the traditions in her haveli and gives her a new perspective on her life.|$|E

5|$|The {{company was}} one of the {{beneficiaries}} of the collapse of London Forest, gaining three routes in Walthamstow. The services of Golden Boy were also taken over, in September 1992, although this deal involved no vehicles and no garage. In July 1993, Lynton Travel purchased 41-vehicle independent Citibus Tours, based in Chadderton near Oldham. Other changes made in 1993 included the opening of a new garage in Grays to replace the previous building, and a <b>totally</b> <b>new</b> garage at Ware which replaced that at Hoddesdon. Two more operators were taken over in 1994, namely coach operators Airport Coaches of Stansted Airport and Biss Bros of Bishops Stortford.|$|E
5|$|Barriers to {{reproduction}} {{between two}} diverging sexual populations {{are required for}} the populations to become new species. Gene flow may slow this process by spreading the new genetic variants also to the other populations. Depending on how far two species have diverged since their most recent common ancestor, it may still be {{possible for them to}} produce offspring, as with horses and donkeys mating to produce mules. Such hybrids are generally infertile. In this case, closely related species may regularly interbreed, but hybrids will be selected against and the species will remain distinct. However, viable hybrids are occasionally formed and these new species can either have properties intermediate between their parent species, or possess a <b>totally</b> <b>new</b> phenotype. The importance of hybridisation in producing new species of animals is unclear, although cases have been seen in many types of animals, with the gray tree frog being a particularly well-studied example.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, The Exorcist was re-released in a 40th Anniversary Edition in paperback, hardcover, and {{audiobook}} formats {{with new}} cover artwork. As described by Blatty, this new, updated edition features new and revised material. The 40th Anniversary Edition of The Exorcist {{will have a}} touch of new material in {{it as part of}} an all-around polish of the dialogue and prose. First time around I never had the time (meaning the funds) to do a second draft, and this, finally, is it. With forty years to think about it, a few little changes were inevitable – plus one new character in a <b>totally</b> <b>new</b> very spooky scene. This is the version I would like to be remembered for. Tor/Forge have also re-published The Ninth Configuration and Legion, with new, updated cover artwork.|$|E

5|$|In the 1880s Muller {{was active}} for his businesses, and {{travelled}} to the Congo Conference in Berlin in 1884, to Portugal in 1886 and North Africa in 1889. In {{the same year}} he succeeded his father as consul general for Liberia in the Netherlands, a position he would hold until 1913. After a third business journey to Africa in 1890, now to Liberia and the Gold Coast, for Hendrik Muller & Co., he returned home seriously ill, and had to convalesce for months. In this period he fell out {{with his father and}} younger brother Abram Muller, about both personal and business matters. It was a personal break that would never be healed and with professional repercussions. In 1891 Muller left business for good and embarked on a <b>totally</b> <b>new</b> career.|$|E
5|$|Nike Zeus was an {{anti-ballistic missile}} (ABM) system {{developed}} by the US Army during the late 1950s and early 1960s, designed to destroy Soviet intercontinental ballistic missile warheads before they could hit targets in the United States. It was designed by Bell's Nike team, and was initially based on the earlier Nike Hercules anti-aircraft missile. The original Zeus A, given the tri-service identifier XLIM-49, was designed to intercept warheads in the upper atmosphere, mounting a 25 kiloton W31 nuclear warhead. During development, the concept changed to protect a much larger area and intercept the warheads at higher altitudes. This required the missile to be greatly enlarged into the <b>totally</b> <b>new</b> design, Zeus B, mounting a 400 kiloton W50 warhead. In several successful tests, the B model proved itself able to intercept warheads, and even satellites.|$|E
25|$|Work {{continued}} {{to try to}} address these issues, but in 1947 a <b>totally</b> <b>new</b> design started that would emerge as the RPG-2. This design was clearly superior, {{and work on the}} RPG-1 ended in 1948.|$|E

25|$|According to Irenaeus, Christ, {{being born}} out of the Virgin Mary, created a <b>totally</b> <b>new</b> {{historical}} situation.

25|$|Later Jewish {{revisions}} and recensions of the Greek {{against the}} Hebrew are well attested, {{the most famous}} of which include the Three: Aquila (128CE), Symmachus, and Theodotion.
