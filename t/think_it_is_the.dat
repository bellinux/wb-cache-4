25|$|Some {{authorities}} also {{equate the}} town named Menapia (or Manapia) as Wexford town – others place it further {{north along the}} east coast, roughly near Wicklow town. A river called the Modonnu(s), whose estuary is near Menapia, is often {{said to be the}} Slaney – others <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Avoka river. It is because the Slaney is the only major river in the south-east that many as a result think that it is the Modonnu(s) river, thereby making Menapia equal to Wexford town (this theory only seems to work if Hook Head is made the Sacred Cape). Most authorities seem to agree that Menapia is not Wexford, but is a town located further north along the coast. However, this is not certain.|$|E

I don't <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> role of the BBC to spend my money on a moral purpose." ...|$|E

500|$|Two Christian reviewers {{and some}} theologians have {{mentioned}} {{the presence of}} Christian themes in the film. Writing for Catholic News Agency, Robert Barron said: I don’t <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> least bit accidental that Waters (Gus’s last name) and Grace (Hazel’s middle name) met in the sacred heart of Christ and thereby, despite their shared suffering, managed to give life to one another... Hazel effectively repudiates her nihilism and materialism as she responds across the barrier of death to Gus’s 'okay'." [...] He also noted: [...] " [...] this film a satisfying presentation of Christianity? Hardly. But {{for those who are}} struggling to find their way to meaning and faith, it's not an entirely bad place to start." ...|$|E

I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> most {{important}} strategic place in the world." [...] That year, Congress passed the Wilcox National Air Defense Act, which provided for a new airbase in Alaska for cold-weather testing and training. A survey team visited Fairbanks in 1936, and in 1937, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt issued Executive Order 7596, which set aside [...] of public land east of Fairbanks for the new airbase, which was named Ladd Army Airfield after Army pilot Arthur Ladd. Preliminary construction began in summer 1939, {{a few days before}} Germany invaded Poland to start World War II. The first runway was finished in September 1940, and the base was dedicated then, before most of the buildings were complete.|$|E
500|$|Though {{the synagogue}} had {{undertaken}} innovations {{in some areas}} of Jewish law, it still insisted on strict adherence in others. In 1878 Tinter was dismissed for officiating at the marriage of a Jewish woman and Christian man, and Baith Israel was, for a time, the only congregation in Brooklyn that celebrated Jewish holidays for the traditional two days. In 1889 Baith Israel asserted it was [...] "the only orthodox congregation in the city", and that year the board forced the resignation of a Mr. J. Folkart, for transgressing the laws of Yom Kippur. In 1892, when Hyman Rosenberg was expelled as rabbi of Brooklyn's Beth Jacob synagogue for eating ham, the Brooklyn Eagle canvassed local rabbis for their views on the matter. While George Taubenhaus, rabbi of Beth Elohim stated, [...] "I do not believe my congregation would expel me if I ate ham", Baith Israel's rabbi Friedlander responded, [...] "While there are some differences between the reform and orthodox Jews, I do not <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> place for any Jewish minister to eat ham. The reformers do not so strictly observe the old Mosaic law, but {{it does not seem to}} me a good example for a rabbi to set to his congregation." ...|$|E

But nobody says that President Truman was a terrorist. All the men we went for individually – Wilkin, Martin, MacMichael and others – were personally interested in succeeding in the fight against us.|$|E
2500|$|On 31 May 2012, Pietersen {{announced}} his retirement from one-day international cricket. Although he intended to still play Twenty20s for England, and especially the World Twenty20 tournament in September 2012, the terms of his central contract meant {{that he had to}} retire from both forms. Remaining available for Test cricket only, Pietersen said that [...] "with the intensity of the international schedule and the increasing demands on my body, I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> right time to step aside and let the next generation of players come through to gain experience for the World Cup in 2015." [...] This announcement came {{on the back of his}} 80 against the West Indies at Trent Bridge as England took an unassailable 2–0 lead in the three-Test series. However, on 9 July 2012, Pietersen reversed his decision and suggested that he may return to ODIs in the future.|$|E

The title of the novel is Across the River and Into the Trees. The author, of course, is Ernest Hemingway, the most important, the outstanding author out of the millions of writers who have lived since 1616." [...] Tennessee Williams, in The New York Times, wrote: [...] "I could not go to Venice, now, without hearing the haunted cadences of Hemingway's new novel. It is the saddest novel in the world about the saddest city, and when I say I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> best and most honest work that Hemingway has done, you may think me crazy. It will probably be a popular book. The critics may treat it pretty roughly. But its hauntingly tired cadences are the direct speech of a man's heart who is speaking that directly for the first time, and that makes it, for me, the finest thing Hemingway has done." ...|$|E
2500|$|Van Vliet {{arrived in}} Salt Lake City on 8 September. Historian Harold Schindler states that his {{mission was to}} contact Governor Young and inform him of the expedition's mission: to escort the new appointees, {{to act as a}} posse comitatus and to {{establish}} at least two and perhaps three new U.S. Army camps in Utah. Conversing with Van Vliet, Young denied complicity in the destruction of the law offices of U.S. Federal Judge Stiles and expressed concern that he (Young) might suffer the same fate as the previous Mormon leader, Joseph Smith, to which Van Vliet replied, [...] "I do not <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> intention of the government to arrest you," [...] said Van Vliet, [...] "but to install a new governor of the territory". Van Vliet's instructions were to buy provisions for the troops and to inform the people of Utah that the troops would only be employed as a posse comitatus when called on by the civil authority to aid in the execution of the laws.|$|E
