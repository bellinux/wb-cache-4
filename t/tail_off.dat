The Bf 109F-2 proved an excellent match to the Spitfire V, but Oesau disliked its reduced armament compared to the 'Emil', and continued to fly an E-4 model in preference to the Bf 109F, until lack of spares forced him to switch to the newer variant. Upon his appointment on 4 July 1941, he addressed JG 2 with the following words.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool's {{first season}} in the Second Division in 1954–55 brought them an 11th-place finish. During this season the club {{suffered}} the biggest defeat in its history, a 9–1 loss to Birmingham City. Although in the following season they improved to third place, {{it was not enough}} for Welsh to keep his job and he was sacked {{at the end of the}} season. His replacement was Phil Taylor, a former captain of the club and a member of the coaching staff. Taylor signed players such as Ronnie Moran, Alan A'Court and Jimmy Melia, who would become mainstays of the club for seasons to come, but was unable to guide Liverpool back to the First Division. The Liverpool board persisted with him, despite the club's loss to non-League side Worcester City in the third round of the FA Cup in January 1959. His tenure ended during the 1959–60 season; after a good start, their form began to <b>tail</b> <b>off</b> mid-season, and after a defeat to Huddersfield Town, Taylor resigned. The man who replaced him was Huddersfield's manager, Bill Shankly.|$|E
5|$|Even {{with the}} growth of {{industry}} there were not enough good jobs: as a result, from 1841 to 1931, about two million Scots emigrated to North America and Australia, and another 750,000 Scots relocated to England. With a population of 4.8 million in 1911, Scotland sent 690,000 men to the First World War, of whom 74,000 died in combat or from disease, and 150,000 were seriously wounded. Thus, although Scots were only 10 per cent of the British population, they made up 15 per cent of the national armed forces and eventually accounted for 20 per cent of the dead. While emigration began to <b>tail</b> <b>off</b> in England and Wales after the First World War, it continued apace in Scotland, with 400,000 Scots, 10 per cent of the population, estimated to have left the country between 1921 and 1931. When the Great Depression hit in the 1930s there were no easily available jobs in the US and Canada, and emigration fell to less than 50,000 a year, bringing to an end the period of mass migrations that had opened in the mid-eighteenth century. This contributed to the growth of the population, which reached a peak of 5,240,800 in 1974. Thereafter it began to fall slowly, moving down to 5,062,940 in 2000. There was also a decrease in some urban populations as a result of slum clearance, overspill and relocation to new towns, with the population of Glasgow falling from over a million in 1951 to 629,000 in 2001. Rural areas also saw a loss of population, particularly the Highlands and Hebrides. In {{the early part of the}} twenty-first century Scotland saw a rise in its population to 5,313,600 (its highest ever recorded) at the 2011 census.|$|E

He took his last first-class wicket (John Barclay) against Sussex in July 1981, although he did play two further Championship games without reward. His final List A game was for Minor Counties against Leicestershire in the 1982 Benson and Hedges Cup; he picked up the wickets of ex-Test cricketers Chris Balderstone and Roger Tolchard.|$|E
25|$|While {{emigration}} {{began to}} <b>tail</b> <b>off</b> in England and Wales after the First World War, it continued apace in Scotland, with 400,000 Scots, ten per {{cent of the}} population, estimated to have left the country between 1921 and 1931. The economic stagnation was only one factor; other push factors included a zest for travel and adventure, and the pull factors of better job opportunities abroad, personal networks to link into, and the basic cultural similarity of the United States, Canada, and Australia. Government subsidies for travel and relocation facilitated the decision to emigrate. Personal networks {{of family and friends}} who had gone ahead and wrote back, or sent money, prompted emigrants to retrace their paths. When the Great Depression hit in the 1930s there were no easily available jobs in the US and Canada and emigration fell to less than 50,000 a year, bringing to an end the period of mass migrations that had opened in the mid-18th century.|$|E

500|$|Magpies are {{ubiquitous}} {{in urban areas}} all over Australia, and have become accustomed to people. A small percentage of birds become highly aggressive during breeding season from late August to early - mid October, and will swoop and sometimes attack passersby.

Almost all attacking birds (around 99%) are male, and they are generally known to attack pedestrians at around [...] from their nest, and cyclists at around [...] There appears to be some specificity in choice of attack targets, with the majority of individuals specializing on either pedestrians or cyclists.

New flight control software is to eliminate the need for the tail skid by keeping the <b>tail</b> <b>off</b> the runway surface regardless {{of the extent to which}} pilots command the elevators. [...] Boeing is also redesigning the inboard flap fairings to reduce drag by reducing pressure on the underside of the wing. The outboard raked wingtip is to have a divergent trailing edge, described as a"poor man's airfoil" [...] by Boeing; this originally developed for the McDonnell Douglas MD-12 project. [...] Another change involves elevator trim bias.

500|$|... "Bop Gun" [...] was {{originally}} meant {{to serve as}} the second season finale, but NBC decided to make it the season premiere with the hopes of getting increased ratings from a guest appearance by Robin Williams. Williams portrayed Robert Ellison, the husband of a slain woman tourist. Several news sources indicated Williams took on the role as a favor to Homicide executive producer Barry Levinson, who directed Williams in the films Good Morning, Vietnam (1987) and Toys (1992). But Fontana said Williams agreed to take the part based on the actor's positive impression of both the show in general and the [...] "Bop Gun" [...] script in particular. Fontana said of Williams, [...] "He read the script, responded instantly and said, 'When do you want me there?'. He {{could not have been more}} prepared or more of a gentleman to everyone, and he worked his <b>tail</b> <b>off.</b> That whole experience was a joy." [...] Williams himself said of the show, [...] "Visually, it was just so different from anything else on television." [...] Although Williams was primarily known for his comedic work, the Homicide producers and Williams himself consciously decided to remain true to the original script, rejecting the idea of adding humor or jokes to the episode. Williams' scenes were filmed over three days, and the actors found the part emotionally draining. Fontana said, [...] " [...] worked like a dog. It was quite a special event for all of us.

They {{remained}} unbeaten until a 3–0 loss to Arsenal in December, {{followed by another}} to Crystal Palace {{at the end of}} the month. The club's form began to <b>tail</b> <b>off</b> and Arsenal moved above them in January. [...] After a 4–4 draw against Everton in an FA Cup replay in February, Dalglish announced his resignation as manager, citing stress as the reason. Coach Ronnie Moran became caretaker manager; he won three of the ten matches he was in charge of, as they fell further behind Arsenal. Former player Graeme Souness was announced as manager in April, but the club were unable to catch Arsenal, who won the league by seven points. Souness reshaped the team during the 1991–92 season, which not been replenished by Dalglish since the signings of Barnes and Beardsley. [...] Beardsley, Gary Gillespie and Steve McMahon were sold. Souness bought Dean Saunders for £2.9million, but Liverpool finished in sixth position, the first time they had finished outside the top two since 1981. The club did reach the final of the FA Cup against Sunderland, which they won 2–0. The season saw Liverpool compete in Europe for the first time since the Heysel stadium disaster in 1985; they were readmitted a year after other English clubs. Liverpool reached the quarter-finals of the UEFA Cup, where they lost to Italian team Genoa 4–1 over two legs. The Boot Room, which had been a meeting place for Liverpool's coaches since Bill Shankly was manager was demolished during Souness' time at the club. A new press room was built in its place.|$|E
