Tanguturi Prakasam, however had offered a ministerial berth with full power, was categorically rejected by Latchanna. With mid-term elections on hand, prime minister and president of Congress, Jawaharlal Nehru convinced N. G.

40|$|Background: Approximately 30 % of Sri Lankans {{work in the}} {{agricultural}} industry, with the third largest agricultural product being rubber. Rubber tapping involves repetitive and high paced work, static muscle loading, non-neutral body postures, and forceful physical exertion, all potential risk factors for musculoskeletal disorders. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on two plantations near Galle, Sri Lanka to study the risk factors of MSDs and injuries in rubber <b>tappers.</b> Questionnaires were administered to 300 rubber <b>tappers,</b> and an ergonomic analysis using Quick Exposure Check was performed on 90 <b>tappers.</b> Univariate and multivariate analysis {{were used to determine}} risk factors for MSDs and injuries. Results: 66 % of rubber <b>tappers</b> reported experiencing an MSD in the past 12 months. Multivariate analysis revealed that many demographic, work condition, personal and psychosocial factors were associated with MSDs. A total of 594 injuries were experienced in the last 12 months, resulting in <b>tappers</b> missing 1080 days of work. Factors associated with injuries were working an additional job and depression. Conclusions: MSDs and injuries are common among rubber <b>tappers</b> in Sri Lanka. Numerous factors contribute to the high prevalence. These results suggest a need for injury monitoring on plantations. Furthermore, work process modifications should be used to help reduce the number of MSDs and injuries. Thesi...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{individual differences}} in work behaviour of rubber <b>tappers.</b> The study examined sex, age, experience and race differences and their interactions with terrain on job performance, absenteeism, and job satisfaction of 1053 rubber <b>tappers.</b> Rubber <b>tappers</b> are unskilled blue-collar workers who essentially do {{the same type of}} work and are paid the same rates of pay. There are very few studies that have compared male and female blue-collar workers doing similar jobs in organisational settings. This study {{is one of the few}} investigations that examine sex differences in job performance of blue-collar workers doing same job using production data. Studies on age differences in work behaviour encounter numerous methodological difficulties such as high turnover, internal transfers and problems associated with age differences in educational levels. The participation of rubber <b>tappers</b> in this study is envisaged to overcome these difficulties because attrition rates of rubber <b>tappers</b> are low, and internal transfers are non existent. Further, the educational levels of rubber <b>tappers</b> are relatively similar across different age cohorts, as most rubber <b>tappers</b> have little or no education. Two measures of both job performance and absenteeism were derived from payroll records. The two job performance measures were total crop production and attendance. The two absenteeism measures were avoidable and unavoidable absence rates. Overall job satisfaction was determined using a 4 -item scale. Significant sex, age, experience and race differences were obtained for job performance, absenteeism and job satisfaction. Significant interactive effects were also obtained for sex, age, experience, race and terrain for job performance and absenteeism. The results are discussed in relation to the abilities and motivation of rubber <b>tappers.</b> The implication of these findings for employee selection and human resource management in rubber estates is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Data on job {{performance}} were collected for 1, 053 male (N = 461) and female (N = 592) rubber <b>tappers</b> from nine different estates in Malaysia, and analysed for age, sex and tenure differences. Job performance data {{were based on}} output measures derived from production records over a 12 -month period. Since the type of terrain varied considerably across plantations, terrain was classified as either ‘hilly’ or ‘undulating’ {{and the effects of}} terrain type on performance were also examined. The relationship between age and total output took the form of an inverted U. Partial correlation analyses indicated that tenure, rather than age, was the main determinant of {{job performance}}. More experienced rubber <b>tappers</b> were found to perform better than less experienced rubber <b>tappers.</b> Women had significantly higher output levels than did men. <b>Tappers</b> working on estates with predominantly hilly terrains produced significantly higher levels of output than did <b>tappers</b> working on estates with predominantly undulating terrains. Neither sex nor tenure interacted significantly with terrain. These results are discussed in relation to previous research concerned with group differences in job performance...|$|R
