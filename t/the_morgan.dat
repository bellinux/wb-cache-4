5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Morgan</b> {{trotting}} stallion Shepherd F. Knapp was {{exported to}} England in the 1860s, where his trotting ability influenced the breeding of Hackney horses. During this period, numerous Morgan mares {{may have been}} brought west and integrated into Texan horse herds, which influenced {{the development of the}} American Quarter Horse breed. <b>The</b> <b>Morgan</b> horse also was an ancestor of the Missouri Fox Trotter. By the 1870s, however, longer-legged horses came into fashion, and Morgan horses were crossed with those of other breeds. This resulted in the virtual disappearance of the original style Morgan, although a few remained in isolated areas.|$|E
