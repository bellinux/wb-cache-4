Georgia Tech clinched the Coastal Division by beating Duke 42–24 and finished with 5-3 league record. Georgia Tech played against Florida State in the 2012 ACC Championship Game on December 1 in Charlotte, which was coach Paul Johnson's second appearance in <b>the</b> <b>title</b> <b>game.</b> The Yellow Jackets lost to the Seminoles 21–15.|$|E
5|$|By the 1951 season, Motley {{started to}} feel the {{physical}} effects of his hard-hitting, up-the-middle running style. He suffered a knee injury in training camp, and he was getting older; {{by the time the}} season was in full swing, he was 31. Motley only ran for 273 yards and one touchdown that year, an uncharacteristically low total. Despite Motley's troubles, the Browns made the championship game again after winning the American Conference with an 11–1 record. Cleveland, however, lost <b>the</b> <b>title</b> <b>game</b> to the Rams, 24–17. Motley had just five carries and 23 yards.|$|E
5|$|Ishikawa {{attended}} Federal Way High School in Federal Way, Washington, {{where he}} lettered in baseball, leading {{his team to}} the Washington State Class 4A Title as a junior in 2001 and to <b>the</b> <b>title</b> <b>game</b> as a senior in 2002. He was drafted in the 21st round of the 2002 Major League Baseball Draft by the San Francisco Giants. The Giants gave him a $955,000 bonus {{to prevent him from}} attending Oregon State University. The bonus was the highest back then for a non-first-round player, cued on by the organization's approaching signing deadline. The Giants could afford to pay a 21st-round pick that much because their higher picks had signed quickly for routine bonuses.|$|E
2500|$|The start {{times for}} the Conference Championship Games were also changed, from 12:30p.m. and 4:00p.m. EST to 3:00p.m. and 6:30p.m. respectively. [...] The {{conferences}} would then begin to annually alternate between the early and late games, with the first game during this 2002–03 season being <b>the</b> NFC <b>title</b> <b>game</b> and <b>the</b> second <b>the</b> AFC <b>title</b> <b>game.</b> Since then, <b>the</b> NFC <b>title</b> <b>game</b> is first in even-numbered seasons (2002, 2004, etc.) and <b>the</b> AFC <b>title</b> <b>game</b> first in odd-numbered seasons (2003, 2005, etc.).

5|$|McBride and his {{partners}} sold the team {{to a group of}} Cleveland businessmen in 1953 for a then-unheard-of $600,000. Eight years later, the team was sold again, this time to a group led by New York advertising executive Art Modell. Modell fired Brown before the 1963 season, but the team continued to win behind running back Jim Brown. The Browns won the championship in 1964 and reached <b>the</b> <b>title</b> <b>game</b> the following season, losing to the Green Bay Packers. The team subsequently reached the playoffs three times in the late 1980s, but fell short of playing in the Super Bowl, the inter-league championship game between the NFL and the rival American Football League (AFL) that started in 1966.|$|E
5|$|The Browns {{continued}} to succeed {{upon entering the}} NFL in 1950, winning the championship that year and reaching <b>the</b> <b>title</b> <b>game</b> in both 1951 and 1952. In January 1951, McBride testified in nationally televised hearings before the Kefauver Committee, where he was questioned about his Continental Press Service and alleged ties to organized crime and illegal gambling. It emerged that McBride partnered with Cleveland police captain John Fleming in real estate deals and had Fleming on the Yellow Cab payroll until 1941. McBride denied the mafia connections, claimed he never broke the law and was never charged with any crime. Congress later passed legislation making such wire services illegal.|$|E
5|$|After {{retiring}} as a player, Cousy {{published his}} autobiography Basketball Is My Life in 1963, {{and in the}} same year became coach at Boston College. In the 1965 ECAC Holiday Basketball Festival at Madison Square Garden, Providence defeated Boston College 91-86 in <b>the</b> <b>title</b> <b>game,</b> when the Friars were led by Tourney MVP and All-American Jimmy Walker. Providence was coached by Joe Mullaney, who was Cousy's teammate at Holy Cross when the two men were players there in 1947. In his six seasons there, he had a record of 117 wins and 38 losses and was named New England Coach of the Year for 1968 and 1969. Cousy led the Eagles to three NIT appearances, including a berth in the 1969 NIT Championship and two National Collegiate Athletic Association tournaments, including the 1967 Eastern Regional Finals.|$|E
50|$|Every AFC team {{except the}} Houston Texans {{has played in}} an AFC Championship Game at least once. The Seattle Seahawks, who have been members in both the AFC and the NFC, hold the {{distinction}} of appearing in both conference <b>title</b> <b>games,</b> a loss in <b>the</b> AFC conference <b>title</b> <b>game</b> to <b>the</b> Los Angeles Raiders for Super Bowl XVIII and a win in <b>the</b> NFC conference <b>title</b> <b>game</b> over <b>the</b> Carolina Panthers for Super Bowl XL. Note: The Baltimore Colts appeared in <b>the</b> NFL conference <b>title</b> <b>game</b> for Super Bowl III and then appeared in <b>the</b> AFC conference <b>title</b> <b>game</b> for Super Bowl V, becoming {{the first team to}} play for both conference <b>titles.</b> <b>The</b> Cleveland Browns were the second team to do so when they appeared in <b>the</b> NFL conference <b>title</b> <b>game</b> for Super Bowl III against the Baltimore Colts and then appeared in <b>the</b> AFC conference <b>title</b> <b>game</b> for Super Bowl XXI. The Pittsburgh Steelers have the most appearances in the AFC Championship Game at 16, with 11 of those games being in Pittsburgh, the most for either conference.|$|R

5|$|As Jim Brown's star rose, players {{began to}} {{question}} Paul Brown's leadership and play-calling in the late 1950s. The skepticism {{came to a head}} in a game against the Giants {{at the end of the}} 1958 season in which a win or tie would have given the Browns a spot in the championship game against Ewbank's Colts. In the third quarter, the Browns drove to New York's 16-yard line with a 10–3 lead and lined up for a field goal. But Coach Brown called a timeout before Groza could make the try, which alerted the Giants to a possible fake kick. Brown indeed called a fake, and the holder stumbled as he got up to throw, ruining the play. The Giants came back to win the game by a field goal and reach the championship, while the Browns went home without a spot in <b>the</b> <b>title</b> <b>game</b> for the second year in a row.|$|E
5|$|Farmer's 18 {{points in}} the semifinals against Pleasure Ridge Park helped Clay County to a 9290 win and a rematch in <b>the</b> <b>title</b> <b>game</b> against Ballard High School. Farmer set a title game record against Ballard, scoring 51 points on 20 of 32 {{shooting}} (including 9 of 14 from three-point range), but Clay County lost 8879. Ron King set the previous title game record in 1969 with 44; only Kelly Coleman's 69-point performance in 1956 bested Farmer's 51 points in a tournament game. He was selected to the all-tournament team, received a Dawahares' Sweet Sixteen Academic Scholarship Award, and was voted the tournament's MVP. Following the state tournament, Farmer said he was contacted by LSU, Vanderbilt, Virginia, and Indiana in addition to schools who had previously recruited him.|$|E
5|$|Wade {{attended}} Harold L. Richards High School in Oak Lawn. Wade {{quickly found}} {{success as a}} wide receiver on the football team, but he needed to work extremely hard to earn playing time on the varsity basketball team during his junior year. While he did not acquire much playing time during his second year, his stepbrother, Demetris McDaniel, was {{the star of the}} team. Wade grew four inches in the summer before his junior year and saw an increase in playing time, averaging 20.7 points and 7.6 rebounds per game. The following year, Wade averaged 27.0 points and 11.0 rebounds per game while leading his team to a 24–5 record. It advanced to <b>the</b> <b>title</b> <b>game</b> of the Class AA Eisenhower Sectional. During this season he set school records for points (676) and steals (106) in a season. Wade has stated that his high school coach, Jack Fitzgerald, {{was one of the most}} positive influences in his life during this time. Wade was recruited by only three college basketball teams (Marquette University, Illinois State, and DePaul University) due to academic problems.|$|E
2500|$|Texas won <b>the</b> Big 12 <b>title</b> <b>game,</b> {{and with}} it a spot in <b>the</b> BCS <b>title</b> <b>game,</b> in {{controversial}} fashion. [...] As the game clock appeared to run out with Nebraska winning 12–10; officials ruled that the time left on the clock was reviewable and ordered 1 second put back on the clock, allowing the Longhorns to kick a field goal for a 13–12 win, a result that left then-Nebraska coach Bo Pelini claiming that {{it was part of}} a BCS conspiracy.

5|$|On {{the basis}} of that record, Holy Cross got into the 1947 NCAA Tournament as the last seed in the then only eight-team tournament. In the first game, they {{defeated}} Navy 55-47 in front of a sell-out crowd at Madison Square Garden. Mullaney led the team in scoring with 18 points, thanks to Navy coach Ben Carnevale's decision to have his players back off from Mullaney, who was reputed as being more of a playmaker than a shooter. In the semifinal game, the Crusaders faced CCNY, coached by Nat Holman, one of the game's earliest innovators. Led by Kaftan's thirty points, Holy Cross easily defeated the Beavers 60–45. In the championship game, the Crusaders faced Oklahoma, coached by Bruce Drake, in another sold-out game at Madison Square Garden. Kaftan followed up his 30-point semifinal heroics with a mere 18 points in <b>the</b> <b>title</b> <b>game,</b> which was far more than enough for the team to defeat the Sooners 58–47. Cousy played poorly, however, scoring only four points on 2-for-13 shots. Holy Cross became the first New England college to win the NCAA tournament. On their arrival back in Worcester, the team was given a hero's welcome by about ten thousand cheering fans who met their train at Union Station.|$|E
