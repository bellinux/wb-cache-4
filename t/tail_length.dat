5|$|A 2006 study {{suggested}} that the correlation of <b>tail</b> <b>length</b> and body size in males, wing length in females, and lifespan for both sexes were signs of individual quality, and the wrens of high quality tend to mate with like individuals. The courting and antagonistic encounters that involve the tail fanning and wing drooping was suggested to be a possible signaling use. Age and life experience are not thought of as significant for potential mates due to their relatively short lifespan and sedentary lifestyle. Due to the large size of male wrens and the male's vigor in defending its territory, intrasexual selection was given as a {{possible explanation for the}} sexual dimorphism.|$|E
5|$|In 66 to 74 {{specimens}} {{measured by}} Goodman and colleagues, total length was 87 to 96mm (3.4 to 3.8in), averaging 91.1mm (3.59in); <b>tail</b> <b>length</b> was 38 to 48mm (1.5 to 1.9in), averaging 42.4mm (1.67in); hindfoot length is 6 to 7mm (0.2 to 0.3in), averaging 6.3mm (0.25in); tragus length was 5 to 6mm (0.2 to 0.2in), averaging 5.8mm (0.23in); ear length was 9 to 11mm (about 0.4in), averaging 9.4mm (0.37in); forearm length was 35 to 40mm (1.4 to 1.6in), averaging 37.4mm (1.47in); and body mass was 3.8 to 7.3g (0.13 to 0.26oz), averaging 4.9g (0.17oz).

5|$|It is a small, mouse-like rodent. It {{differs from}} the very similar eastern voalavo mainly in some measurements, such as a greater <b>tail</b> <b>length.</b> It also resembles small species of Eliurus, but the fur is darker {{and there is no}} tail tuft. The fur is soft, short, and thick, and appears dark gray on most of the upperparts, but more {{brownish}} on the sides. On the back, the cover hairs, which form {{the main part of the}} fur, are three-colored: most of the hair is gray, followed by a narrow light buff band and a black tip. The longer guard hairs are black. The fur of the underparts is not different in overall color, but the individual hairs are gray for about three quarters of their length and white at the tips, except for those at the chin, which are white throughout.|$|E
5|$|Pipistrellus raceyi is a {{small to}} {{medium-sized}} pipistrelle. It is long-furred and the body is reddish above, with the head a trifle darker, and yellowish-brown below. The glandular swellings on the muzzle, next to the nose, are hairless. The dark, short, round ears bear three to five ridges. The crescent-shaped tragus (a projection {{on the inner side}} of the outer ear) is about half as long as the ear and contains a slight constriction on the back side of its base. The wings are dark. The third through fifth metacarpals (hand bones) are about equally long, but the first phalange (finger bone) on the third finger is short. P.endoi has a longer first phalange on the third metacarpal. P.raceyi has short tibiae (lower leg bones) and small feet and the tail is shorter than the head and body. Forearm length is 28.0 to 31.2mm (1.10 to 1.23in), <b>tail</b> <b>length</b> is 22.9 to 30.3mm (0.90 to 1.19in), hindfoot length is 5.3 to 7.5mm (0.21 to 0.30in), and ear length is 7.5 to 10.6mm (0.30 to 0.42in) in 13 measured specimens.

5|$|There is {{only one}} named species of Sinosauropteryx, S. prima. A {{possible}} second species {{is represented by the}} specimen GMV2124 (aka NGMC2124), which was described as a third, larger specimen of S. prima by Ji and Ji in 1997. However, in a 2002 presentation and abstract for the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology, Nick Longrich showed that this specimen differs in several anatomical aspects from the others, including its relatively large size, proportionally longer shins, and shorter tail. Longrich suggested that GMV2124 was a compsognathid coelurosaurian, while Sinosauropteryx proper was a more primitive kind of coelurosaurian or even a basal carnosaurian. In 2007, Gishlick and Gauthier concurred that this specimen was probably a new taxon, and tentatively re-classified it as Sinosauropteryx?sp., though they suggested it may belong in a new genus. Also in 2007, Ji, Ji and colleagues wrote that GMV2124 is probably a new genus, noting the differences in <b>tail</b> <b>length</b> and hindlimb proportions.|$|E
5|$|Voalavo {{is a small}} rodent {{resembling}} a mouse with gray fur. Species of the genus are among the smallest known nesomyines, close in size only to Monticolomys koopmani. In terms of external morphology, Voalavo is barely different from Eliurus; fur coloration patterns, general morphology of the feet, and number of mammae (six) {{are all the same}} in both genera. However, all species of Eliurus have a pronounced tuft of elongated hairs {{at the tip of the}} tail, a feature that is absent in Voalavo, although the latter does have slightly longer hairs near the tip. The tail is longer than the head and body. Relative <b>tail</b> <b>length</b> in northern voalavo (136% of head and body length) is comparable to that of the longest-tailed species of Eliurus, Grandidier's tufted-tailed rat and Petter's tufted-tailed rat, but V.antsahabensis has a somewhat shorter tail. Furthermore, the pads of the feet are larger in Eliurus, and specifically, the thenar pad (located at the middle of the tarsus) is circular and fairly small in Voalavo, but longer and larger in Eliurus. On the chest, Voalavo species have a gland that produces a sweet-swelling musk in breeding males; this gland is absent in Eliurus. Unlike all other nesomyines but Brachyuromys, Voalavo lacks an entepicondylar foramen, an opening on the humerus (upper forelimb bone).|$|E

40|$|Context. Recently, two {{exoplanet}} {{candidates have}} been discovered, KIC 12557548 b and KOI- 2700 b, whose transit profiles show {{evidence of a}} comet-like tail of dust trailing the planet, thought to be fed by the evaporation of the planet’s surface. Aims. We aim to put constraints on {{the composition of the}} dust ejected by these objects from the shape of their transit light curves. Methods. We derive a semi-analytical expression for the attenuation of the dust cross-section in the tail, incorporating the sublimation of dust grains as well as their drift away from the planet. This expression shows that the <b>length</b> of the <b>tail</b> is highly sensitive to the sublimation properties of the dust material. We compute <b>tail</b> <b>lengths</b> for several possible dust compositions, and compare these to observational estimates of the <b>tail</b> <b>lengths</b> of KIC 12557548 b and KOI- 2700 b, inferred from their light curves. Results. The observed <b>tail</b> <b>lengths</b> are consistent with dust grains composed of corundum (Al 2 O 3) or iron-rich silicate minerals (e. g., fayalite, Fe 2 SiO 4). Pure iron and carbonaceous compositions are not favoured. In addition, we estimate dust mass loss rates of 1. 7 ± 0. 5 M ⊕ Gyr− 1 for KIC 12557548 b, and> 0. 007 M ⊕ Gyr− 1 (1 σ lower limit) for KOI- 2700 b...|$|R

25|$|Different populations within Cape Dwarf Chameleons {{were found}} to have {{different}} preferences regarding Perch Diameter. The two main populations, Kogelberg and Stellenbosch, were seen to have different behavior. Kogelberg tended to use perches that were significantly wider on average than perches used by the Stellenbosch site which chose perches by random. Hand size has a direct correlation with grip strength on both broad and narrow dowels, rod-like structures, in both populations. The longer the <b>tail</b> <b>length,</b> the greater the strength. This species prefers to sleep on perches of specific diameters that correspond to their specific morphology. Animals from habitats characterized by wider perches are also stronger than their counterparts living in habitats with narrow branches. This has led to sexual selection for chameleons with specific traits like hand size and <b>tail</b> <b>length.</b>|$|E
25|$|The docked {{tail of the}} Vizsla is {{significantly}} longer than that of other dogs with traditionally docked tails such as the Weimaraner, Doberman, Boxer, and Australian Shepherd. Since the tail is docked when the puppy is less than three days old, this longer dock can result in some variation in <b>tail</b> <b>length</b> among Vizsla dogs from different breeding programs.|$|E
25|$|Some Aussies {{are born}} with {{naturally}} bobbed tails. Others have full long tails, and others with natural partial bobs, where the tail is shorter and appears stubby. Breeders have historically docked the tails when the puppies are born. In the United States and Canada, the standard calls for a natural bob or docked tail not to exceed four inches as a defining characteristic; however, some long-tailed examples have been successfully shown and been given recognition. Any natural <b>tail</b> <b>length</b> is permitted when showing in Europe, where docking has been banned in most countries, including the United Kingdom.|$|E
50|$|The Japanese Onagadori {{evolved from}} the common {{domestic}} chicken. They have green junglefowl in their paternal ancestry.

50|$|Nowak {{indicates}} the typical weight range of lions as 150 to 250 kg {{for males and}} 120 to 182 kg for females. The size of adult lions varies across their range, with those from the southern African populations in Zimbabwe, the Kalahari and Kruger Park (P. l. bleyenberghi, P. l. vernayi, or P. l. krugeri) averaging around 189.6 kg and 126.9 kg in males and females respectively, compared to 174.9 kg and 119.5 kg {{of male and female}} lions from East Africa. Reported body measurements in males are head-body lengths ranging from 170 to 250 cm, <b>tail</b> <b>lengths</b> of 90 - 105 cm. In females reported head-body lengths range from 140 to 175 cm, <b>tail</b> <b>lengths</b> of 70 - 100 cm, however, the frequently cited maximum head and body length of 250 cm fits rather to extinct Pleistocene forms, like the American lion, with even large modern lions measuring several centimetres less in length.|$|R
25|$|The seepage {{salamander}} {{is easily}} {{confused with the}} Pygmy Salamander (Desmognathus wrighti). These two species overlap in a small area of southern North Carolina. D. wrighti and D. aeneus are the smallest species in the genus Desmognathus and are the only terrestrial direct-developers, lacking a free-swimming larval stage. They both have vomerine teeth, and similar <b>tail</b> <b>length</b> to total body length ratios; however, they have different patterns and coloration. Seepage salamanders have a smoother top of the head. The mental glands are also shaped differently in the males. The pygmy salamander has a large, U-shaped mental gland while the seepage salamander's is small and kidney shaped.|$|E
25|$|Kangaroo rats are four-toed heteromyid rodents {{with big}} hind legs, small front legs and {{relatively}} large heads. Adults typically weigh between 70 and 170 g. The tails of kangaroo rats are longer than both {{their bodies and}} their heads. Another notable feature of kangaroo rats are their fur-lined cheek pouches, which are used for storing food. The coloration of kangaroo rats varies from cinnamon buff to dark gray, depending on the species. There is also some variation in length {{with one of the}} largest species, the banner-tailed kangaroo rat being six inches in body length and a <b>tail</b> <b>length</b> of eight inches. Sexual dimorphism exists in all species, with males being larger than females.|$|E
25|$|The {{juvenile}} {{golden eagle}} {{is similar to}} the adult but tends to be darker, appearing black on the back especially in East Asia. Compared to adults, juveniles have a more unfaded color. Young birds are white for about two-thirds of their <b>tail</b> <b>length</b> ending with a broad, black terminal band. Occasionally, juvenile eagles have white patches on the remiges at the bases of the inner primaries and the outer secondaries, forming a crescent marking on the wings which tend to be divided by darker feathers. Rarely, juvenile birds may have only trace amounts of white on the tail. Compared to the relatively consistently white tail, the white patches on the wing are extremely variable and some juveniles have almost no white visible. Juveniles of less than 12 months of age tend to have the most extensive amount of white to the plumage. By their second summer, the white underwing coverts are usually replaced by a characteristic rusty-brown color. By the third summer, the upper-wing coverts are largely replaced by dark brown feathers, however not all feathers moult at once giving many juvenile birds a grizzled pattern. The tail also follows a similar pattern of maturation. Due to the amount of variability in different individuals, juvenile eagles cannot be reliably aged on sight alone. Many golden eagles still have white on the tail during their first attempt at nesting. The final adult plumage is not fully attained until the birds are between 5 and a half and 6 and a half years old.|$|E
50|$|Ear {{carriage}} is erect, but {{can also}} be tipped, or button, all of which contribute to an intelligent, alert expression. The tail has been traditionally docked to about 2-3 inches, but the bobtail gene is very common in Rat Terriers and {{can result in a}} variety of <b>tail</b> <b>lengths.</b> Today, some breeders prefer a natural, undocked tail, which is accepted in the breed standards.|$|R

50|$|Sexual {{selection}} is another driving force {{with an unusual}} influence, in that females exhibit preference for males with low-frequency signals (which are energetically expensive and easily detected by predators), but most males exhibit this frequency only intermittently.
