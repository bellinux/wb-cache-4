5|$|Criticism over artistic {{matters in}} The Pall Mall Gazette {{provoked}} {{a letter in}} self-defence, and soon Wilde was a contributor to <b>that</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> journals during 1885–87. He enjoyed reviewing and journalism; the form suited his style. He could organise and share his views on art, literature and life, yet in a format less tedious than lecturing. Buoyed up, his reviews were largely chatty and positive. Wilde, like his parents before him, also supported the cause of Irish Nationalism. When Charles Stewart Parnell was falsely accused of inciting murder Wilde wrote a series of astute columns defending him in the Daily Chronicle.|$|E
5|$|Jerry Fodor {{was born}} in New York City in 1935, of Jewish descent. He {{received}} his A.B. degree (summa cum laude) from Columbia University in 1956, where he studied with Sydney Morgenbesser, and a PhD in Philosophy from Princeton University in 1960, {{under the direction of}} Hilary Putnam. From 1959 to 1986 Fodor was on the faculty of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Massachusetts. From 1986 to 1988 he was a full professor at the City University of New York (CUNY). From 1988 until his retirement in 2016 he was State of New Jersey Professor of Philosophy and Cognitive Science at Rutgers University in New Jersey, where he is now emeritus. Besides his interest in philosophy, Fodor passionately follows opera and regularly writes popular columns for the London Review of Books on <b>that</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> topics.|$|E
5|$|Melish {{had been}} fielding {{inquiries}} from collectors since Roosevelt signed the legislation, but from mid-May, those who wrote received back only postcards stating the new issue was oversubscribed. The summer of 1936 was {{the peak of}} the commemorative coin boom, and Melish announced the new pieces would be sold in sets of three by mint mark for $7.75 (a high price at that time). Order blanks were sent to those who had written early, and soon these blanks were selling for $10. Yet few collectors were successful in having their orders filled, with most having their payment returned as the coins had supposedly sold out. The sets quickly jumped in price to $40. At this high level, many coins proved available. Numismatist Q. David Bowers stated that these were most likely surreptitiously sold by Melish and other insiders. Melish also allowed the issuers of the York County, Maine Tercentenary half dollar to purchase, at the original issue price, several sets—members of the public could order at most one set at that price. In return, he sought to purchase <b>that</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> commemorative coins in quantities beyond the usual order limit. Nevertheless, when the Oregon Trail Memorial Association, issuer of the long-lived half dollar honoring the trail, tried to purchase a set, Melish replied that they were sold out.|$|E

5|$|The French, who {{had started}} {{construction}} on Fort Carillon in 1755, {{used it as a}} launching point for the successful siege of Fort William Henry in 1757. Despite <b>that</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> successes in North America in 1757, the situation did not look good for them in 1758. As early as March, Louis-Joseph de Montcalm, the commanding general responsible of the French forces in North America, and the Marquis de Vaudreuil, New France's governor, were aware that the British were planning to send large numbers of troops against them, and that they would have relatively little support from King Louis XV of France. The lack of support from France was in large part due to an unwillingness of the French military to risk the movement of significant military forces across the Atlantic Ocean, which was dominated by Britain's Royal Navy. This situation was further exacerbated by Canada's poor harvest in 1757, which resulted in food shortages as the winter progressed.|$|E
5|$|The {{so-called}} Baptism of Poland and {{the attendant}} processes {{did not take}} place through Mieszko's German connections. At that time, Mieszko {{was in the process of}} fixing an uneasy relationship with the Bohemian state of Boleslaus I. The difficulties were caused mainly by Czech cooperation with the Veleti. Already in 964, the two parties arrived at an agreement on <b>that</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> issues. In 965, Mieszko married Boleslaus' daughter Doubravka. Mieszko's chosen Christian princess, a woman possibly in her twenties, was a devout Christian and Mieszko's own conversion had to be a part of the deal. This act in fact followed in 966 and initiated the Christianization of Greater Poland, a region that up to that point had not been exposed to Christian influence, unlike Lesser Poland and Silesia. In 968, an independent missionary bishopric, reporting directly to the pope, was established, with Jordan installed as the first bishop.|$|E
25|$|During {{the debates}} over the ten-hour day a Whig-supporting Lowell {{newspaper}} published a verse suggesting that Butler's father had been hanged for piracy. Butler sued the paper's editor and publisher for <b>that</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> allegations that had been printed about himself. The editor was convicted and fined $50, but the publisher was acquitted on a technicality. Butler blamed the Whig judge, Ebenezer Rockwood Hoar, for the acquittal, inaugurating a feud between the two that would last for decades and significantly color Butler's reputation in the state.|$|E

25|$|Today, high {{technology}} {{is the foundation of}} the local economy, and there exist few remnants of the city's agricultural past. In 1990, Kevin Duggan began his position as city manager. He built a relationship with Google, Inc., and issued a long-term lease to <b>that</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> technology companies. As of 2014, those leases generate over $5 million per year in city revenue. Duggan reinstituted a special tax district for the Shoreline area, which was a landfill and pig farm in 1990. That money allowed the city to create a large park and golf course on the site. The Castro Street downtown area also benefitted from a special tax district.|$|E
25|$|In {{the winter}} of 1927/28, MCC sent a cricket team to South Africa; the team, Wisden noted, was {{scarcely}} representative of top-class English cricket, since Jack Hobbs, Patsy Hendren, Maurice Tate, Harold Larwood and several prominent amateurs were either not selected or declined to go. Legge was one {{of half a dozen}} amateur players, and equalled his then-highest score when he made 120 against Orange Free State. <b>That</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> decent scores in first-class matches led to his selection for the first Test, but he failed to score in his only innings, being one of eight England batsmen who contributed only 13 runs between them to a match-winning score of 313.

25|$|Wienis {{plans to}} launch his {{offensive}} {{on the night of}} his nephew's coronation as king and sole ruler of Anacreon. Hardin attends the coronation ceremony and is arrested, but he has already arranged with Anacreonian High Priest Poly Verisof, who is aware of the true nature of Scientism and is also Terminus's Ambassador to Anacreon, to foster a popular uprising against Wienis. Convincing the Anacreonian populace that an assault against the Foundation and Terminus is blasphemous, Verisof leads an infuriated mob to the royal palace and surrounds it, demanding Hardin's release. Meanwhile, under the leadership of its priest-attendant, Theo Aporat, the crew of the space cruiser mutinies against its commander, Admiral Prince Lefkin, Wienis's son. Lefkin confronts the mutineers and, captured, is forced to broadcast a message to Anacreon demanding Wienis's arrest and threatening a bombardment of the royal palace if <b>that</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> demands are not met. Wienis, maddened by his failure, orders Hardin's execution, but his royal guardsmen refuse to obey him. Attempting and failing, due to a protective energy field, to kill Hardin personally, Wienis commits suicide.|$|E

Boreman made her charges public for the press corps at a press conference, with Dworkin, feminist lawyer Catharine MacKinnon, and members of Women Against Pornography. After the press conference, Dworkin, MacKinnon, Gloria Steinem, and Boreman began discussing the possibility of using federal civil rights law to seek damages from Traynor and the makers of Deep Throat. Boreman was interested, but backed off after Steinem discovered that the statute of limitations for a possible suit had passed.|$|E
500|$|X-ray {{crystallography}} {{had just}} begun as a discipline in 1911, and had advanced relatively rapidly from simple salt crystals to crystals of complex molecules such as cholesterol.

500|$|One of the {{athletic}} feats for which Youngblood is best known, is that of playing the entire 1979 playoffs, including Super Bowl XIV, with a fractured left fibula. He also played in the 1980 Pro Bowl with the injured leg, {{a week after the}} Super Bowl. In the playoffs, Youngblood sacked Dallas Cowboys quarterback Roger Staubach near the sideline in the waning moments of the divisional playoff game versus the Cowboys. Playing with the fractured leg was noted by Sports Illustrated in their Top 10 list of athletes playing in pain. For <b>that</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> achievements Jack was dubbed the [...] "John Wayne of football" [...] by Jim Hanifan and echoed by Hall of Fame coach John Madden.

500|$|Justice McHugh drew analogies {{between the}} {{legislation}} {{at issue in}} the case, and previous legislation which had authorised indefinite administrative detention, such as the arrangements under the War Precautions Act 1914. Regulations made under <b>that</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> acts allowed the internment of several thousand people, including German Australians during World War I and Japanese Australians during World War II. McHugh noted that those arrangements had been challenged, and upheld, in the High Court (for example in the 1915 case of Lloyd v Wallach), and emphasised that at no time had anyone questioned that detention for protective purposes, as opposed to punitive purposes, would conflict with Chapter III. He concluded that although the situation at hand was [...] "tragic", the courts were {{not at liberty to}} question the propriety of decisions made by the Parliament of Australia on moral or human rights grounds, given the absence of a bill of rights in Australia.|$|E
500|$|With its choruses {{presented}} in what Harrison biographer Elliot Huntley describes as [...] "thundering, echo-drenched crescendo", [...] "Let It Down" [...] received a hard rock arrangement that recalls {{the sound of}} Wright's former band Spooky Tooth. Like Huntley, authors Chip Madinger and Mark Easter recognise the song as the most obvious example of Spector's influence on the album. In their book Eight Arms to Hold You, Madinger and Easter also credit the producer with [...] "creating havoc" [...] during the making of All Things Must Pass. According to Harrison's later recollections and those of Molland, Klaus Voormann and orchestral arranger John Barham, Spector's erratic behaviour and alcohol intake became a further burden on Harrison, alongside his marital problems {{and the death of}} his mother in July 1970. During a session at Apple Studio, Spector fell over and broke his arm; <b>that</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> [...] "health issues" [...] left Harrison to do much of the production work alone through to 12 August.|$|E

500|$|Blackstone's {{legacy and}} main work of note is his Commentaries. Designed {{to provide a}} {{complete}} overview of English law, the four-volume treatise was repeatedly republished in 1770, 1773, 1774, 1775, 1778 and in a posthumous edition in 1783. Reprints of the first edition, intended for practical use rather than antiquary interest, were published until the 1870s in England and Wales, and a working version by Henry John Stephen, first published in 1841, was reprinted until after the Second World War. Legal education in England had stalled; Blackstone's work gave the law [...] "at least a veneer of scholarly respectability". William Searle Holdsworth, one of Blackstone's successors as Vinerian Professor, argued that [...] "If the Commentaries had not been written when they were written, I think it very doubtful <b>that</b> , <b>and</b> <b>other</b> English speaking countries would have so universally adopted the common law." [...] In the United States, the Commentaries influenced Alexander Hamilton, John Marshall, James Wilson, John Jay, John Adams, James Kent and Abraham Lincoln, and remain frequently cited in Supreme Court decisions.|$|E
500|$|In September 1943 Richard Shaver, an Amazing reader, {{began to}} {{correspond}} with Palmer, who soon asked him to write stories for the magazine. Shaver responded with a story called [...] "I Remember Lemuria", published in the March 1945 issue, which was presented by Palmer as a mixture of truth and fiction. The story, about prehistoric civilizations, dramatically boosted Amazings circulation, and Palmer ran a new Shaver story in every issue, culminating in a special issue in June 1947 devoted entirely to the Shaver Mystery, as it was called. Amazing soon drew ridicule for these stories. A derisive article by William S. Baring-Gould in the September 1946 issue of Harper's prompted William Ziff to tell Palmer to {{limit the amount of}} Shaver-related material in the magazine; Palmer complied, but his interest (and possibly belief) in this sort of material was now significant, and he soon began planning to leave Ziff-Davis.
