The results, based on data from Guangdong and Fujian Provinces, suggest that the system has generally achieved its aims but geographical variations remain. © 2006 by The Regents of the University of California.

40|$|Since 1978, the {{decentralization}} reforms, in general, and {{the reforms}} {{in planning and}} fiscal systems, in particular, have brought about {{dramatic changes in the}} context of central-regional/local relationships, which have in turn generated a tremendous impact on and problems for China's regional development. This article aims to examine the impacts and consequences of China's decentralization reform on regional development over the past seventeen years. With a brief review of prereform experiences, this article focuses on the decentralization reforms of planning and fiscal systems in the 1980 s and 1990 s: the contract-responsibility reforms and the ongoing tax-sharing reforms, and their regional implications and consequences. Special attention is paid to regionalism that is emerging {{as a result of these}} reforms. The authors argue that regionalism, in forms of territorial segmentation and confrontation, was planted in the traditional administrative economic system, but grew and was exacerbated by the current flawed or uncompleted decentralization reforms. The current <b>tax-sharing</b> <b>system</b> reform, which centered the functional division between the center and localities, seems to be on the right track, but its fate is hard to predict and far from claiming success. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
30|$|Other {{research}} {{has revealed that}} fluctuations in policy implementation between loose and strict methods are commonplace in grassroots Chinese society, and the resultant problems in grassroots governance also proliferate. For instance, since the 1980 s, local governments’ extrabudgetary revenues in tax and fiscal systems increased significantly, and the institutional oversight of fiscal expenditures weakened. The <b>tax-sharing</b> <b>system</b> tightened up local governments’ extrabudgetary revenue, but their continuing fiscal expenditures {{in the same manner}} brought about major debts for local governments (Zhou 2012). In the 1990 s, grassroots governments were unduly reliant on rural taxes and surcharges (santi wutong) for government expenditures, despite being warned numerous times by the central state. This led to the emergence of “absorptive” (jiqu xing) local governments (Zhou 2006). In the area of financial regulation, many local governments did not regulate private lending, creating significant risks. Once the problem was uncovered, local governments banned private lending completely, jeopardizing stable financial development and local economic development (Zhang 2006; Gao and Tang 2012). In the area of letters and petitions (xinfang), the administrative methods of grassroots governments aggrieved many people; once the state affirmed the value of letters and petitions, local cases of letters and petitions surged and overwhelmed grassroots governments (Tian 2012).|$|E
40|$|In {{countries}} with <b>tax-sharing</b> <b>systems,</b> assigning local governments {{a large share}} of locally generated revenues is often thought to promote economic development. The more local officials benefit from local economic activity, the more supportive of business and less corrupt they should be, resulting in higher output. Some attribute China's rapid growth to its high local retention rates and Russia's 1990 s stagnation to the central clawback of local revenues. I show that such arguments ignore an important actor in the game - the central government. If increasing the local tax share improves incentives for local authorities, it worsens them for central officials. The net effect on output is indeterminate.

40|$|Based on {{more than}} two years of ethnographic {{fieldwork}} in Hunan, the prototype of rural China, this dissertation explains why a predatory state emerged in China at the village, township, and county levels in the 1990 s. It also explores patterns of peasant resistance to the predatory state and analyzes the impact of peasant protest on local and national rural policies. The local government in rural China experienced a profound fiscal crisis in the 1990 s. Because of internal corruption and competition from the private sector, the public sector collapsed, depriving local governments of their main source of revenue. The <b>tax-sharing</b> <b>system</b> adopted in 1994 and various unfunded central mandates significantly increased local fiscal responsibilities. The fiscal crisis induced local governments to impose ever-increasing taxes and fees on peasants. The rise of the predatory local state led to widespread peasant discontent. In only a few cases, however, did peasants succeed in mounting sustained protest against the local government. This happened when peasants sensed an opening in the political opportunity structure and when peasant leaders emerged. Protests usually started when peasants acquired central documents on lowering peasant burdens, which they used to argue that they had the right to withhold taxes and fees. Peasant leaders were ?peasant cadres? and ?peasant intellectuals,? who were better-educated than other peasants and who had worked for the party-state {{at some point in their}} lives. As a result, they could speak and write well. They also had good knowledge of party polices, which allowed them to challenge the interpretative framework of the local government without appearing to question the legitimacy of the party-state. Finally, they provided a shield of protection for their fellow villagers. The state eventually repressed most protests by jailing protest leaders. However, protestors sometimes obtained economic concessions from the local government. Moreover, in the 2000 s, the central government reformed rural public finance and introduced subsidies to peasants and local governments (the ?tax-for-fee reform? and the policy of ?constructing the new socialist countryside?). This cycle of revenue maximization, resistance, and reform illuminates the interactive and mutually transformative relationship between the state and society in China...|$|E
