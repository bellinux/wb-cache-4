5|$|<b>The</b> <b>ironic</b> {{thing is}} that we grew up {{listening}} to primarily American music {{and fell in love with}} American music. I love country music. I grew up with George Jones and Charley Pride and Jim Reeves. All that stuff was playing in the house. That's what I wanted to seek out. That's what I wanted to play. Carol was into Tammy Wynette. Trev Warner is Kym's dad, and he was the first person to bring bluegrass music to Australia.|$|E
5|$|Stuart Buck, a lawyer, also {{explored}} {{this issue}} in Acting White: <b>The</b> <b>Ironic</b> Legacy of Desegregation (2010). He said that segregated black schools had featured teachers, counselors, and others of the same race as the student population, and the adults often acted as mentors to the students. Integration of many public schools since the mid- to late-20th century may have resulted in schools in which black students perceived they were controlled or dominated by whites. A black student trying to achieve high educational success may then be considered as trying to leave the minority group.|$|E

25|$|Francis Poulenc was a French {{composer}} and pianist. He was predominantly gay, yet struggled with his sexuality.

25|$|Cabaret, {{which gave}} birth to {{so many of the}} arts of modernism, {{including}} the immediate precursors of film, may be said to have begun in France in 1881 {{with the opening of the}} Black Cat in Montmartre, the beginning of <b>the</b> <b>ironic</b> monologue, and the founding of the Society of Incoherent Arts.|$|E

But the Hong Kong Administration, after taking years {{to bring in the}} anti-smoking legislation, immediately granted smoking deferral exemptions to any licensed restaurant or bar that applied for same – the exemptions remain valid until 1 July 2009. <b>The</b> <b>ironic</b> fact is that the Health Department is the authority granting the smoking law exemptions whilst having to treat the results.|$|E
25|$|Burke {{claimed that}} Bolingbroke's {{arguments}} against revealed religion {{could apply to}} all social and civil institutions as well. Lord Chesterfield and Bishop Warburton (and others) initially thought that the work was genuinely by Bolingbroke rather than a satire. All the reviews of the work were positive, with critics especially appreciative of Burke's quality of writing. Some reviewers failed to notice <b>the</b> <b>ironic</b> nature of the book, which led to Burke stating {{in the preface to}} the second edition (1757) that it was a satire.|$|E
25|$|Maecenas endeavoured also {{to divert}} the less {{masculine}} genius of Propertius from harping continually on his love to themes of public interest, an effort which to some extent backfired in <b>the</b> <b>ironic</b> elegies of Book III. But if the motive of his patronage had been merely political, it never could have inspired the affection which it did in its recipients. The great charm of Maecenas in his relation to the men of genius who formed his circle was his simplicity, cordiality and sincerity. Although not particular {{in the choice of}} some of the associates of his pleasures, he admitted none but men of worth to his intimacy, and when once admitted they were treated like equals. Much of the wisdom of Maecenas probably lives in the Satires and Epistles of Horace. It has fallen to the lot of no other patron of literature to have his name associated with works of such lasting interest as the Georgics of Virgil, the first three books of Horace's Odes, and the first book of his Epistles.|$|E

500|$|On 2 October, Banksy stenciled a {{piece in}} Chelsea that [...] read [...] "This is my New York accent" [...] in the {{traditional}} typography of New York street art and below in a more typical handwriting style read, [...] "...normally I write like this".

500|$|With {{its heavy}} use of irony, {{symbolism}} and metaphor, the novel also {{lends itself to}} less straightforward readings. As with many of Crane's fictional works, the novel's dialogue often uses distinctive local dialects, contributing to its apparent historicity; for example, Jim Conklin muses {{at the beginning of}} the novel: [...] "I s'pose we must go reconnoiterin' 'round th' kentry jest t' keep 'em from gittin' too clost, or t'develope'm, or something". <b>The</b> <b>ironic</b> tone increases in severity as the novel progresses, especially in terms of <b>the</b> <b>ironic</b> distance between the narrator and protagonist. The title of the work itself is ironic; Henry wishes [...] "that he, too, had a wound, a red badge of courage", echoing a wish to have been wounded in battle. The wound he does receive (from the rifle butt of a fleeing Union soldier), however, is not a badge of courage but a badge of shame.|$|E
500|$|Its humorous {{style and}} sexual innuendos {{influenced}} City Hunter, and Shinichirō Watanabe's works Cowboy Bebop and Space Dandy owe their nostalgic appearance and <b>the</b> <b>ironic</b> tone, respectively, to Cobra. Cobra's [...] "provoking look", ironic style and capacity of changing {{from a little}} smile to a serious face also inspired video game designer Hideki Kamiya to create the character of Dante from the Devil May Cry series.|$|E

500|$|Although Roth, Gough and Millar {{knew the}} show would be action-oriented, {{they wanted to}} reach 7th Heavens [...] "middle America iconography". To create atmosphere, the team decided the meteor shower {{bringing}} Clark to Earth would be <b>the</b> <b>ironic</b> foundation of the show. The primary source of his life on Earth and the super-powered beings Clark must fight, it would take away {{the parents of the}} girl he loves and start Lex Luthor down a dark path. Roth appreciated Clark's conflict in dealing with the fact that his arrival caused so much pain.|$|E
500|$|Ulysses' {{apparent}} {{disdain for}} {{those around him}} is another facet of <b>the</b> <b>ironic</b> perspective. He declares that he is [...] "matched with an aged wife" [...] (3), indicates his weariness in governing a [...] "savage race" [...] (4), and suggests his philosophical distance from his son Telemachus. A skeptical reading of the second paragraph finds it a condescending tribute to Telemachus and a rejection of his [...] "slow prudence" [...] (36). However, the adjectives used to describe Telemachus—"blameless", [...] "discerning", and [...] "decent"—are words with positive connotations in other of Tennyson's poetry and within the classical tradition, where [...] "blameless" [...] is an attribute of gods and heroes.|$|E
500|$|Until {{the early}} twentieth century, readers reacted to [...] "Ulysses" [...] sympathetically. The meaning of the poem was {{increasingly}} debated as Tennyson's stature rose. After Paull F. Baum criticized Ulysses' inconsistencies and Tennyson's conception of the poem in 1948, <b>the</b> <b>ironic</b> interpretation became dominant. Baum finds in Ulysses echoes of Lord Byron's flawed heroes, who similarly display conflicting emotions, self-critical introspection, and a rejection of social responsibility. Even Ulysses' resolute final utterance—"To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield"—is undercut by irony, when Baum and later critics compare this line to Satan's [...] "courage never to submit or yield" [...] in John Milton's Paradise Lost (1667).|$|E
