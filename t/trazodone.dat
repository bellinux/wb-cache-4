5|$|Drugs {{may cause}} or affect {{clitoral}} priapism. The drug <b>trazodone</b> {{is known to}} cause male priapism as a side effect, but {{there is only one}} documented report that it may have caused clitoral priapism, in which case discontinuing the medication may be a remedy. Additionally, nefazodone is documented to have caused clitoral engorgement, as distinct from clitoral priapism, in one case, and clitoral priapism can sometimes start as a result of, or only after, the discontinuation of antipsychotics or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).|$|E
25|$|The {{primary use}} of <b>trazodone</b> is the {{treatment}} of major depression. Data from open and double-blind trials suggest the antidepressant efficacy of <b>trazodone</b> is {{comparable to that of}} amitriptyline, doxepin, and mianserin. Also, <b>trazodone</b> showed anxiolytic properties, low cardiotoxicity, and relatively mild side effects.|$|E
25|$|<b>Trazodone</b> is metabolized by CYP3A4, a liver enzyme. Inhibition of this enzyme {{by various}} other {{substances}} may delay its degradation, leading to high {{blood levels of}} <b>trazodone.</b> CYP3A4 may be inhibited by many other medications, herbs, and foods, and as such, <b>trazodone</b> may interact with these substances.|$|E
25|$|Around 70 to 75% of 14C-labelled <b>trazodone</b> {{was found}} to be {{excreted}} in the urine within 72hours. <b>Trazodone</b> is highly protein-bound.|$|E
25|$|Early {{case reports}} had {{indicated}} that <b>trazodone</b> {{is associated with}} improvement in obsessive-compulsive disorder, but a double-blind, placebo-controlled study found that <b>trazodone</b> lacked antiobsessional effects.|$|E
25|$|Because <b>trazodone</b> has minimal {{anticholinergic}} activity, it {{was especially}} welcomed {{as a treatment for}} geriatric patients with depression when it first became available. Three double-blind studies reported <b>trazodone</b> has antidepressant efficacy similar to that of other antidepressants in geriatric patients. However, a side effect of <b>trazodone,</b> orthostatic hypotension, which may cause dizziness and increase the risk of falling, can have devastating consequences for elderly patients; thus, this side effect, along with sedation, often makes <b>trazodone</b> less acceptable for this population, compared with newer compounds that share its lack of anticholinergic activity but not the rest of its side-effect profile. Still, <b>trazodone</b> is often helpful for geriatric patients with depression who have severe agitation and insomnia.|$|E
25|$|There are {{reported}} cases of high doses of <b>trazodone</b> precipitating serotonin syndrome. There are also reports of patients taking multiple SSRIs with <b>trazodone</b> and precipitating serotonin syndrome.|$|E
25|$|<b>Trazodone</b> {{appears to}} be {{relatively}} safer than TCAs, MAOIs, {{and a few of}} the other second-generation antidepressants in overdose situations, especially when it is the only agent taken. Fatalities are rare, and uneventful recoveries have been reported after ingestion of doses as high as 6,000–9,200mg. In one report, 9 of 294 cases of overdose were fatal, and all nine patients had also taken other central nervous system (CNS) depressants. When <b>trazodone</b> overdoses occur, clinicians should carefully monitor for hypotension, a potentially serious toxic effect. In a report of a fatal <b>trazodone</b> overdose, torsades de pointes and complete atrioventricular block developed, along with subsequent multiple organ failure, with a <b>trazodone</b> plasma concentration of 25.4mg/L on admission.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{its lack}} of {{anticholinergic}} side effects, <b>trazodone</b> is especially useful in situations in which antimuscarinic effects are particularly problematic (e.g., in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia, closed-angle glaucoma, or severe constipation). Trazodone's propensity to cause sedation is a dual-edged sword. For many patients, the relief from agitation, anxiety, and insomnia can be rapid; for other patients, including those individuals with considerable psychomotor retardation and feelings of low energy, therapeutic doses of <b>trazodone</b> may not be tolerable because of sedation. <b>Trazodone</b> elicits orthostatic hypotension in some patients, probably {{as a consequence of}} α1-adrenergic receptor blockade. Mania has been observed in association with <b>trazodone</b> treatment, including in patients with bipolar disorder, as well as in patients with previous diagnoses of major depression.|$|E
25|$|Many clinicians use low-dose <b>trazodone</b> as an {{alternative}} to benzodiazepines for the treatment of insomnia. Two recent reviews found that <b>trazodone</b> is the second most prescribed agent for insomnia, but as most studies have been limited to patients with depression, few studies actually support trazodone's use in primary insomnia.|$|E
25|$|<b>Trazodone</b> {{has also}} been {{reported}} to have antianxiety properties. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, the anxiolytic efficacy of <b>trazodone</b> was {{comparable to that of}} diazepam in weeks 3–8 of treatment for generalized anxiety disorder, although patients treated with diazepam had greater improvement during the first 2 weeks of treatment.|$|E
25|$|<b>Trazodone</b> was {{not found}} to {{increase}} the discontinuation success rate.|$|E
25|$|Elevated {{prolactin}} concentrations {{have been}} observed in patients taking <b>trazodone.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Trazodone</b> is well absorbed after oral administration, with {{mean peak}} blood levels {{obtained}} at about one hour after ingestion. Absorption is somewhat delayed and enhanced by food. The mean blood elimination half-life is biphasic: the first phase's half-life is 3 to 6hours, {{and the following}} phase's half-life is 5 to 9hours. The drug is extensively metabolized, {{with three or four}} major metabolites having been identified in the human body, particularly mCPP, which may contribute to the side effect profile of <b>trazodone</b> and which probably accounts for trazodone's serotonergic effects. <b>Trazodone</b> levels are about 10-fold those of mCPP with treatment.|$|E
25|$|<b>Trazodone</b> was {{discovered}} in Italy in the 1960s by Angelini Research Laboratories as a second-generation antidepressant. It was developed according to the mental pain hypothesis, which was postulated from studying patients and which proposes that major depression {{is associated with a}} decreased pain threshold. In sharp contrast to most other antidepressants available {{at the time of its}} development, <b>trazodone</b> showed minimal effects on muscarinic cholinergic receptors. <b>Trazodone</b> was patented and marketed in many countries all over the world. It was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1981 and was the first non-tricyclic antidepressant approved in the US.|$|E
25|$|<b>Trazodone,</b> {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Oleptro among others, is an {{antidepressant}} of the serotonin antagonist and reuptake inhibitor (SARI) class. It is a phenylpiperazine compound. <b>Trazodone</b> also has anti-anxiety (anxiolytic) and sleep-inducing (hypnotic) effects. Its side-effect profile and potential toxicity are considerably {{different from those of}} the original antidepressants (i.e., the monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)).|$|E
25|$|Aripiprazole is a phenylpiperazine and is {{chemically}} {{related to}} nefazodone, etoperidone, and <b>trazodone.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Trazodone</b> is {{a potent}} 5-HT2A {{antagonist}}, {{as well as an}} antagonist on other serotonin receptors.|$|E
25|$|Compared to the {{reversible}} MAOI antidepressant drug moclobemide, {{significantly more}} impairment of vigilance occurs with <b>trazodone.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{relatively}} rare, but dramatic, {{side effect}} associated with <b>trazodone</b> is priapism, {{likely due to}} its antagonism at α-adrenergic receptors. More than 200 cases have been reported, and the manufacturer estimated {{that the incidence of}} any abnormal erectile function is about one in 6,000 male patients treated with <b>trazodone.</b> The risk for this side effect appears to be greatest during the first month of treatment at low dosages (i.e. <150mg/day). Early recognition of any abnormal erectile function is important, including prolonged or inappropriate erections, and should prompt discontinuation of <b>trazodone</b> treatment. Clinical reports have also described trazodone-associated psychosexual side effects in women, including increased libido, priapism of the clitoris, and spontaneous orgasms.|$|E
25|$|The {{combined}} {{actions of}} 5-HT2A and 5HT2C receptor antagonism with serotonin reuptake inhibition only occur at moderate to {{high doses of}} <b>trazodone.</b> Doses of <b>trazodone</b> lower than those effective for antidepressant action are frequently used for the effective treatment of insomnia. Low doses exploit trazodone's potent actions as a 5-HT2A receptor antagonist, and its properties as an antagonist of H1 and α1-adrenergic receptors, but do not adequately exploit its SERT or 5-HT2C inhibition properties, which are weaker. Since insomnia {{is one of the}} most frequent residual symptoms of depression after treatment with an SSRI, a hypnotic is often necessary for patients with a major depressive episode. Not only can a hypnotic potentially relieve the insomnia itself, but treating insomnia in patients with major depression may also increase remission rates due to improvement of other symptoms such as loss of energy and depressed mood. Thus, the ability of low doses of <b>trazodone</b> to improve sleep in depressed patients may be an important mechanism whereby <b>trazodone</b> can augment the efficacy of other antidepressants.|$|E
25|$|<b>Trazodone</b> acts {{predominantly}} as a 5-HT2A receptor antagonist {{to mediate}} its therapeutic benefits against anxiety and depression. Its inhibitory effects on serotonin reuptake and 5-HT2C receptors are comparatively weak. Hence, <b>trazodone</b> {{does not have}} similar properties to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and is not particularly associated with increased appetite and weight gain, unlike other 5-HT2C antagonists like mirtazapine. Moderate 5-HT1A partial agonism is likely to contribute to trazodone's antidepressant and anxiolytic actions to some extent as well.|$|E
25|$|<b>Trazodone</b> {{has been}} {{reported}} to cause seizures in a small number of patients who took it concurrently with medications to control seizures.|$|E
25|$|<b>Trazodone</b> is a triazolopyridine {{derivative}} and a phenylpiperazine that is chemically {{related to}} nefazodone and etoperidone, {{each of which}} are derivatives of it.|$|E
25|$|<b>Trazodone</b> is {{generally}} described as {{acting as a}} potent serotonin 5-HT2A and α1-adrenergic receptor antagonist, a weak serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI), and a weak antihistamine or histamine H1 receptor inverse agonist. Its 5-HT2A receptor antagonism and weak serotonin reuptake inhibition {{form the basis of}} its common label as a serotonin antagonist and reuptake inhibitor (SARI). <b>Trazodone,</b> both itself and via its major active metabolite meta-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP), also binds to a variety of other receptors. It is an antagonist at most or all of the receptors it binds to except the 5-HT1A receptor, where it acts as a partial agonist similarly to buspirone and tandospirone but with comparatively greater intrinsic activity. Conversely, mCPP is a non-selective agonist of most of the serotonin receptors it binds to. A range of weak affinities (Ki) have been reported for <b>trazodone</b> at the human histamine H1 receptor including 220nM, 350nM, 500nM, and 1,100nM.|$|E
25|$|As a {{consequence}} of the production of mCPP as a metabolite, patients administered <b>trazodone</b> may test positive on EMIT II urine tests for the presence of MDMA ("ecstasy").|$|E
25|$|If {{the patient}} is under 18 {{years of age and}} <b>trazodone</b> is {{combined}} with other antidepressant medications, it may increase the possibility of suicidal thoughts or actions.|$|E
25|$|Case {{reports have}} noted cardiac arrhythmias {{emerging}} {{in relation to}} <b>trazodone</b> treatment, both in patients with pre-existing mitral valve prolapse and in patients with negative personal and family histories of cardiac disease.|$|E
25|$|Since <b>trazodone</b> may impair {{the mental}} and/or {{physical}} abilities required for performance of potentially hazardous tasks, such as operating an automobile or machinery, the patient should be cautioned {{not to engage}} in such activities while impaired.|$|E
25|$|QT {{prolongation}} {{has been}} reported with <b>trazodone</b> therapy. Arrhythmia identified include isolated PVCs, ventricular couplets, and in two patients short episodes (three to four beats) of ventricular tachycardia. Several post-marketing reports have been made of arrhythmia in trazodone-treated patients who have pre-existing cardiac disease and in some patients {{who did not have}} pre-existing cardiac disease. Until the results of prospective studies are available, patients with pre-existing cardiac disease should be closely monitored, particularly for cardiac arrhythmias. <b>Trazodone</b> is not recommended for use during the initial recovery phase of myocardial infarction. Concomitant administration of drugs that prolong the QT interval or that are inhibitors of CYP3A4 may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmia.|$|E
25|$|The {{possibility}} of suicide in depressed patients remains during treatment and until significant remission occurs. The number of tablets prescribed {{at any one}} time should take into account this possibility, and patients with suicidal ideation should never have access to large quantities of <b>trazodone.</b>|$|E
25|$|Trazodone's potent α1-adrenergic {{blockade}} {{may cause}} some side effects like orthostatic hypotension and sedation. Conversely, along with 5-HT2A and H1 receptor antagonism, it {{may contribute to}} its efficacy as a hypnotic. <b>Trazodone</b> lacks any affinity for the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, so does not produce anticholinergic side effects.|$|E
25|$|While some substitutive pharmacotherapies {{may have}} promise, current {{evidence}} is insufficient to support their use. Some studies found that the abrupt substitution of substitutive pharmacotherapy was actually less effective than gradual dose reduction alone, and only three studies found benefits of adding either melatonin, paroxetine, or <b>trazodone</b> and valproate {{in conjunction with a}} gradual dose reduction.|$|E
25|$|While <b>trazodone</b> {{is not a}} true {{member of}} the SSRI class of antidepressants, it does still share many {{properties}} of the SSRIs, especially the possibility of discontinuation syndrome if the medication is stopped too quickly. Care must, therefore, be taken when coming off the medication, usually by a gradual process of tapering down the dose {{over a period of}} time.|$|E
25|$|Serotonin {{antagonist}} and reuptake inhibitors (SARIs) while mainly used as antidepressants, {{are also}} anxiolytics and hypnotics. They act by antagonizing serotonin receptors such as 5-HT2A and inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin, norepinephrine, and/or dopamine. Additionally, most also act as α1-adrenergic receptor antagonists. The {{majority of the}} currently marketed SARIs belong to the phenylpiperazine class of compounds. They include <b>trazodone</b> and nefazodone.|$|E
25|$|Patient A {{suffers from}} schizophrenia. Their {{treatment}} included {{a combination of}} ziprasidone, olanzapine, <b>trazodone</b> and benzotropine. The patient experienced dizziness and sedation, so they were tapered off ziprasidone and olanzapine, and transition to quetiapine. <b>Trazodone</b> was discontinued. The patient then experienced excessive sweating, tachycardia and neck pain, gained considerable weight and had hallucinations. Five months later, quetiapine was tapered and discontinued, with ziprasidone re-introduction into their treatment due to the excessive weight gain. Although the patient lost the excessive weight they gained, they then developed muscle stiffness, cogwheeling, tremor and night sweats. When benztropine was added they experienced blurry vision. After an additional five months, the patient was switched from ziprasidone to aripiprazole. Over the course of 8 months, patient A gradually experienced more weight gain, sedation, developed difficulty with their gait, stiffness, cogwheel and dyskinetic ocular movements. A pharmacogenomics test later proved the patient had a CYP2D6 *1/*41, with has a predicted phenotype of IM and CYP2C19 *1/*2 with predicted phenotype of IM as well.|$|E
