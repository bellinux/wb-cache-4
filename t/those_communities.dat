5|$|The Nation Alliance Party {{was founded}} in June 2007 by four people: realtor Wei Ping Chen of Delta, renovator Steven Lian from Surrey, tourism guide Randy Liu from Burnaby, and Simon Fraser University student Locan Wang. Party leader Wei Ping Chen had immigrated to Canada from Beijing, via Australia. He {{witnessed}} the challenges that recent immigrants faced once in a new country, and how uninvolved they were in politics. Contrasted to his experience in China, Wei Ping Chen {{was impressed with the}} political freedoms available in Canada and felt motivated to start a political party. He felt that political campaigns oriented towards recent immigrants and people whose first language is not English, would empower <b>those</b> <b>communities</b> to become more politically active.|$|E
25|$|The next {{sections}} of MD 765 to be designated were between Sunderland and Owings when MD 2 was relocated north of MD 4 in 1965. Unsuffixed MD 765 {{was assigned to}} the old road through Port Republic and St. Leonard after MD 2-4 was relocated to its present course to the west of <b>those</b> <b>communities</b> in 1981. The four mainline portions of MD 765 through the Lusby and Solomons areas were designated when MD 2-4 was relocated through <b>those</b> <b>communities</b> in 1987. MD 765R and MD 765Q did not originally connect; the highways were connected when a new road was built between them parallel to MD 2-4 in 1999.|$|E
25|$|The {{environmental}} justice {{aspect of this}} is that hydraulic fracturing sites {{are more likely to be}} located in places with a higher percentage of minority and low-income people. This means higher water contamination, air pollution, ecosystem harm, and more risk for earthquakes for <b>those</b> <b>communities.</b>|$|E

25|$|By 1999, the {{district}} was expanded further to 175 cities and towns, adding most that were served by or adjacent to commuter rail lines, though the MBTA did not {{assume responsibility for}} local service in <b>those</b> <b>communities</b> adjacent to or served by commuter rail.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the strong}} {{challenge}} from Farrell, Shays was re-elected to Congress in the 2006 election by a slim margin of 6,645 votes (3%). Shays lost Bridgeport, Stamford, Norwalk, Westport, and Weston to Farrell, but her margin in <b>those</b> <b>communities</b> was insufficient to overcome Shays' {{lead in the}} more Republican towns in the district.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, the {{district}} was expanded further to 175 cities and towns, adding most communities that were served by or adjacent to Commuter Rail lines (again including Maynard).

25|$|Several {{thousand}} Israelis practice Messianic Jewish denominations, {{which are}} often considered as Christian sects. The Messianic Jews usually combine Jewish and Christian practices, but do recognize Jesus as the Messiah. There are no exact numbers on <b>those</b> <b>communities,</b> but {{it is believed that}} several hundred to several thousand ethnic Jews belong to this tradition as well as several thousand Israelis of mixed ancestry (mostly mixed Jewish and Slavic).|$|E
25|$|In 2016, {{several dozen}} Old Order Amish {{families}} relocated to Kings County {{in the province}} of Prince Edward Island as part of a planned, long-term migration. Increasing land prices in Ontario had reportedly limited the ability of members in <b>those</b> <b>communities</b> to purchase new farms. Currently two separate settlements have been established {{in the vicinity of the}} town of Montague; one west of the town in the Summerville - New Perth area, and the other northeast of the town in the Dundas - Bridgetown area.|$|E
50|$|Jewish House is an Australian-Jewish {{non-profit}} organisation assisting homeless people. It {{is based in}} the Eastern Suburbs of Sydney.

25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, the mountain became a luxury resort and a sought-after area for the food needs of various religious communities. One of <b>those</b> <b>communities,</b> the Brothers of Christian Instruction of St Gabriel, went as far as building a school and an arboretum {{for the benefit of the}} neighboring population. In 1976, the Government of Quebec acquired part of the mountain. It established a park in 1985 that, since 1999, is managed by the Société des établissements de plein air du Québec (SÉPAQ).|$|E
25|$|The Mexican army, which pervaded the Zapatista region, {{had little}} effect on river crime, and may have abetted it. In Guatemala, the absence of the {{expelled}} CPR communities, which had helped keep the selva safe and secure, now left it open to invasion, illegal logging, smuggling of immigrants, arms, artifacts, and drugs. (Many members of <b>those</b> <b>communities</b> now work as Defensores, but their numbers are few, and they are poorly paid.) The region continued in a state of low-grade terror and occupation for ten years.|$|E
25|$|In the {{beginning}} of the 21st century, new Jewish communities have been established in Mumbai, New Delhi, Bangalore, and other cities in India. The new communities have been established by the Chabad-Lubavitch movement which has sent rabbis to create <b>those</b> <b>communities.</b> The communities serve the religious and social needs of Jewish business people who have immigrated or visiting India, and Jewish backpackers touring India. The largest centre is the Nariman House in Mumbai. There are currently 33 synagogues in India, although many no longer function as such and today vary in their levels of preservation.|$|E

25|$|In addition, the {{majority}} of Franco-Ontarians are, out of necessity, functionally or fluently bilingual in English, a fact that encourages borrowing, as does {{the fact that the}} English language has a greater prestige in the province from its being a majority language. Franco-Ontarian communities with a small francophone population tend to have more English-influenced French, and some younger speakers there may feel more comfortable using English than French. On the other hand, the French spoken in French-dominant Ontarian communities (such as Hearst and Hawkesbury), or in <b>those</b> <b>communities</b> near the Quebec border (such as Ottawa), is virtually indistinguishable from Quebec French.|$|E
25|$|In {{anticipation}} of the 2010 Harley Bike Week rally, a local Harley-Davidson dealership said events would still take place for their bike week event, but on a reduced schedule of only 5 days, May 11 to 16, while the website Myrtle Beach Bike Week, LLC says a full-length rally of May 716 would take place. Both sources say {{there would be no}} vendors inside the city limits of Myrtle Beach during the Harley Bike Week, and they both encouraged attendees to boycott the city and patronize <b>those</b> <b>communities</b> and businesses outside the city which did support Harley Bike Week.|$|E
25|$|A sizable Sephardic {{community}} {{had settled in}} Morocco and other Northern African countries, which were colonized by France in the 19th century. Jews in Algeria were given French citizenship in 1870 by the décret Crémieux (previously Jews and Muslims could apply for French citizenship, but had to renounce the use of traditional religious courts and laws, which many {{did not want to}} do). When France withdrew from Algeria in 1962, the local Jewish communities largely relocated to France. There are some tensions between some of <b>those</b> <b>communities</b> and the earlier French Jewish population (who were mostly Ashkenazi Jews), and with Arabic-Muslim communities.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ed. M.)

Although there is much material available as to <b>those</b> <b>community</b> resources that are being utilized and best suited for elementary schools, as well as suggestions and techniques for making the best use of them, little data are available as to a method or plan of determining to what extent the elementary schools are utilizing the resources of their particular community. Through research, it is hoped that a representative list of <b>those</b> <b>community</b> resources that are being utilized by individual teachers or groups of teachers throughout the country can be evolved, and a questionnaire, in the form of a check list, built. In this check list, the community resources will be classified and placed in the following categories: (1) Field trips, (2) Resource Visitors, (3) Interviews with Resource People, (4) Collections and Exhibits, (5) Contacts with Community Agencies, (6) Local Resource Surveys, and (7) Community Service Enterprises...|$|R

25|$|Human-generated {{pollution}} {{of the lake}} and, by extension, New York City's watershed, also increased. Local communities resisted pressure from the city to install sewage treatment plants until the late 1990s, when more of <b>those</b> <b>communities</b> were relying on city water to handle their rapid development. In 2000 {{the city and the}} county reached a deal to build a plant to handle sewage from the many homes around the lake whose original septic systems were failing, and divert it to the Hudson River. Four years later the city also helped the town and county install stormwater control units along Route 52.|$|E
25|$|A bill {{signed into}} law in September 2014, {{mandated}} the CARB to draft a financial plan to meet California's goal of putting one million vehicles on the road while making sure that disadvantaged communities can participate. CARB had to change the Clean Vehicle Rebate program to provide an extra credit for low-income drivers who wish to purchase or lease an electric car. CARB also provides assistance to carsharing programs in low-income neighborhoods and install charging stations in apartment buildings in <b>those</b> <b>communities.</b> Under bill SB 1275, low-income residents who agree to scrap older, polluting cars will also get a clean vehicle rebate on top of existing payments for junking smog-producing vehicles.|$|E
25|$|Two {{hundred years}} later, {{there was a}} rebirth of the {{popularity}} of the doctrines in the Azores; their religious manifestations, rituals and symbols began to permeate the islands and, consequently, persist until today. These acts of faith were heavily influenced by Franciscan spiritualists, who were members of the first religious order that colonized the Azores, and brought with them traditions that were being extinguished on the mainland by Catholic Church orthodoxy. Here, in isolated communities under environmental pressures and the uncertainties of life, the millenarian rites of the Holy Spirit were accepted and fostered. The Azores, and <b>those</b> <b>communities</b> that had their origins in the archipelago, became the last outposts of Joachimite doctrines.|$|E
