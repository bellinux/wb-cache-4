5|$|In {{contrast}} to the minor themes in the B strain, the <b>third</b> <b>section</b> is upbeat but with bittersweet harmonies, returning once again to the scale of B-flat major. Here, for the first time, the piece departs from the standard left-hand pattern that characterizes most ragtime. This section of the piece {{has been compared to}} the style of twelve bar blues. The C strain also represents the only known time when Joplin departs from the standard sixteen-bar form, being instead 24 bars in length with an uneven 14- and 10-bar division. Its first 12 measures parallel the 12-bar blues form and the next two measures extend the subdominant as a transition into the last ten bars.|$|E
5|$|The LNWR began {{construction}} {{work on the}} surface section of the new tracks in 1909. By 1911, it had modified the plans to omit the underground section and to split its proposed electrified services into three. The first section was to follow the existing surface route into Euston on newly electrified tracks, the second section was {{to connect with the}} North London Railway at Chalk Farm and continue on electrified tracks from there to Broad Street station in the City of London. The <b>third</b> <b>section</b> involved the extension of the Bakerloo Tube from Paddington to Queen's Park.|$|E
5|$|The chelicerae ("claw horns") {{that give}} the sub-phylum its name {{normally}} consist of three sections, and the claw is formed by the <b>third</b> <b>section</b> and a rigid extension of the second. However, spiders' have only two sections, and the second forms a fang that folds away behind the first when not in use. The relative sizes of chelicerae vary widely: those of some fossil eurypterids and modern harvestmen form large claws that extended ahead of the body, while scorpions' are tiny pincers {{that are used in}} feeding and project only slightly in front of the head.|$|E
5|$|The short {{second section}} in common {{time is a}} 12 bar {{bridging}} interlude linking the first and <b>third</b> <b>sections.</b> The key modulates from D minor to C minor, so that the surrounding first and <b>third</b> <b>sections</b> can modulate from their starting key to its dominant and thus the whole movement can return to its original key at the close.|$|R

5|$|The {{restructured}} French Herd Book {{is described}} as having a <b>third</b> <b>section</b> called certified purebred (race pure certifié in French) intermediate between the first two for recording animals that do not comply with the breed standard (for example incorrectly coloured hair in certain places), have double muscling genes, or are polled. Limousins imported into France that comply with Council Directive 2009/157 are also recorded in sub-class 2 (sous-classe 2 in French) of the certified purebred class {{because they do not}} comply with the French HBL requirement of being Full French.|$|E
5|$|The <b>third</b> <b>section</b> {{discusses}} {{the rulers of}} secular society and their flaws. The fourth, which is a formal section, deploys a series of Baroque paradoxes {{in the context of}} the Good Friday mass. This past manner is regarded ironically by the poet in the fifth section as he looks back on his period of experimentation in 'the years of l'entre deux guerres as 'largely wasted'. He welcomes approaching old age as a new opportunity to find renewal, although it might only be a rediscovery of 'what has been lost and found and lost again'.|$|E
5|$|The <b>third</b> <b>section</b> to open {{was from}} Bloor Street to the Gardiner Expressway. This section {{involved}} {{the removal of}} CPR rail sidings on the eastern bank of the Don from Eastern Avenue north. Royal Drive, which was a two-way road that connected with Bloor Street between Broadview Avenue and the Viaduct was re-purposed into a one-way north-bound on-ramp. A pedestrian overpass bridge was constructed to connect {{the east and west}} sections of Riverdale Park. The section opened in conjunction with the section of the expressway from the parkway to York Street on November 6, 1964. It was opened ceremonially by Ontario Premier John Robarts.|$|E

5|$|On September 20, 2014, a ribbon-cutting {{ceremony}} for the High Line was held, {{followed by the}} opening of the <b>third</b> <b>section</b> of the High Line Park on September 21, and a procession down the High Line. The third phase, costing US$76 million, is divided into two parts. The first part, costing US$75 million, which opened on September 21, is {{from the end of the}} existing Phase 2 of the High Line to the line's terminus at 34th Street west of 11th Avenue. The second part, the spur, was going to contain such amenities as a bowl-shaped theater but has changed and will provide more room to install ambitious artworks curated by the public art program. It will also be integrated with 10 Hudson Yards, which has already been built over the High Line Spur. The spur will include a plinth when it opens in 2018.|$|E
5|$|When {{the boats}} first {{started for the}} port, the Tripolitanians began firing upon them with their shore batteries. The {{shelling}} lasted until 11:00 PM and delayed the assault until 1:00 AM when the Nerid began escorting the boats in closer to shore. Though at first the second Sardinian attack was unnoticed by the Tripolitanians, a sentry sighted the approaching force at 2:30 AM. Despite resistance from the Tripolitanian fleet and forces ashore, Mamelli pushed his force onward through grapeshot and musket fire. He soon reached the Tripolitanian brig and had his force board her, killing its officers and captain {{as well as a}} large portion of its crew. A second section of boats assaulted the schooners, taking them by boarding. At the same time, the <b>third</b> <b>section</b> of Sardinian boats managed to force their way ashore despite heavy opposition, capturing the dockyard and routing its Tripolitanian defenders. At 3:30 AM Mamelli fired off two rockets to signal a retreat, and burned the Tripolitanian ships his force had captured.|$|E

25|$|The <b>third</b> <b>section</b> of {{the park}} {{is located on the}} west side of the second and was inaugurated in 1974. It has a surface area of 242.9 hectares.

Although some recreational activities such as archery and horseback riding are practiced there, the importance of this area is primarily as an ecological preserve for various species of flora and fauna, such as snakes and lizards. In 1992, it was decreed as a Protected Natural Area. In 2010, there were reports of feral dogs attacking visitors in the <b>third</b> <b>section.</b> Approximately 150 feral dogs were living in the small canyon areas of this section that year.|$|E
