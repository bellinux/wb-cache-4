60|$|During {{a couple}} of days, we {{frequently}} answered these hails. Sometimes {{there was a group}} of high-water-stained, tumble-down cabins, populous with colored folk, and no whites visible; with grassless patches of dry ground here and there; a few felled trees, with skeleton cattle, mules, and horses, eating the leaves and gnawing the bark--no other food for them in the flood-wasted land. Sometimes there was a single lonely landing-cabin; near it the colored family that had hailed us; little and big, old and young, roosting on the scant pile of household goods; these consisting of a rusty gun, some bed-ticks, chests, tinware, stools, a crippled looking-glass, a venerable arm-chair, and six or eight base-born and spiritless yellow curs, attached to the family by strings. They must have their dogs; can't go without their dogs. Yet the dogs are never willing; they always object; so, one after another, in ridiculous procession, they are dragged aboard; all four feet braced and sliding along the stage, head likely to be pulled off; but the <b>tugger</b> marching determinedly forward, bending to his work, with the rope over his shoulder for better purchase. Sometimes a child is forgotten and left on the bank; but never a dog.|$|E

50|$|The TLC <b>Tugger</b> is a tapeless {{foreskin}} restoration device {{invented by}} Ron Low. The device {{consists of a}} silicone 'tugger', retaining cone, and an elastic strap. The silicone <b>tugger</b> is placed against the glans. Skin from the penile shaft or inner skin is then rolled over the <b>tugger.</b> The retaining cone is then used to hold the skin in place. Finally, a strap {{is attached to the}} <b>tugger</b> and then tied around the knee in order to induce tension. This tension allows the inner or outer foreskin to grow. A newer version of the TLC <b>Tugger</b> has been created called the TLC <b>Tugger</b> X which includes weights that can be tied to straps to add extra tension allowing for faster growth of the foreskin.|$|E
5000|$|Continuing on this golden period, Tuggeranong won a Premiership/Championship double 1991.

Military applications of DMFCs are an emerging application since they have low noise and thermal signatures and no toxic effluent. These applications include power for man-portable tactical equipment, battery chargers, and autonomous power for test and training instrumentation.

50|$|Tuggeranong United was {{the first}} club from Canberra to {{represent}} the ACT in the inaugural FFA Cup. <b>Tuggers</b> were not originally going to represent the nation’s capital when Capital Football decided a pre-season cup competition in 2014 would decide who would represent the ACT, rather than last season’s Federation Cup champions. Tuggeranong United were the 2013 Federation Cup champions after beating Cooma 3-2, and upon hearing the initial decision by Capital Football, decided to lodge a formal appeal to the federation to change their mind. With rival clubs backing, the appeal was successful at a Capital Football board meeting on 18 February 2014 and federation put Tuggeranong forward as the ACT representative on the proviso of finding a more suitable venue to host matches given Kambah 2 has only basic amenities and inadequate lighting. This decision directly affected 2014 Federation Cup winners, Belconnen United FC, as the blue devils missed out on qualification to the FFA Cup.|$|R
50|$|The {{machines}} {{form part}} of the material handling equipment industry that, amongst others, also covers fork lift trucks, overhead cranes and pallet jacks.Although ‘electric tug’ {{is perhaps the most}} commonly used term, suppliers and customers regularly use a range of other names that include towing tractors, battery-powered tugs, electric hand trucks, electric <b>tuggers</b> and pedestrian operated tugs.The tugs move loads across a single level. They do not lift the load clear of the ground which is why the load must be on wheels. If the load itself does not have wheels, it would be placed on a wheeled platform often referred to as a trolley, bogie or skate. The tug connects to this wheeled platform just as a fork lift truck links to a pallet in order to move a load sat on it.In most cases a steel coupling (male) attached to the machine itself connects to a corresponding coupling (female) bolted to the load’s bogie. A second bogie or multiple bogies will each have identical female couplings attached to them so that a single male coupling attached to the machine can move them all without alterations.|$|R

40|$|The {{expansion}} {{of a plant}} can lead to many difficulties. This had been the case at BAE Land Systems SA. The company is a division of BAE Land Systems and is experiencing rapid expansion due to large contracts received. More production lines need to be established, more vehicles need {{to be built in}} the same time as in the past, more staff needs to be contracted and more systems need to be implemented. This project will focus on exploiting problems in the production line and the supply system of the consumables that are needed on the production line in order to achieve the needed expansion in production. Using a top-bottom approach helped to identify the need to produce more vehicles per day. Two big problems stand out. Firstly, that the production line should be fitted to a schedule and, secondly, that the production line encounters production standstills because of insufficient supplies at stations, thus resulting in a slow production ratio. These problems are addressed separately, but with established communication between the two production systems. The production line is placed on an hourly schedule to ensure constant output. To achieve this, production is balanced between the production line stations. In addition, bottle necks at station six are fixed by way of redesigning the tools which are used at the assembling points of valves. The supply chain has been redesigned with the help of <b>tuggers</b> and trolleys, which ensure that the supplies arrives just-in-time to eliminate the problem of production standstills. In addition, the inventory on the line has been reduced. It is critically important to run the production line as smooth as possible and to keep the production rate high, in order that the production demands are met and that BAE can continue to grow its business.

40|$|This Masters Thesis {{has been}} {{performed}} at Futuris Automotive in Adelaide, Australia. Futuris Automotive designs and manufactures automotive interior solutions. The {{purpose of this}} project {{is to make a}} recommendation to Futuris Automotive of how the tracks should be assembled at the plant in Edinburgh Park. The track is the steel frame that the front seat cushion rests on and that allows the seat to go back and forth. The aim of the project is to design a Track Assembly area with high labour efficiency, minimum storages and without need of forklifts. The work environment must be safe and ergonomic. The current way of assembling tracks at the plant in Edinburgh Park requires large storages because of the batch building manufacturing principle. This leads to high stockholding costs and long lead times and requires a lot of floor space. The production does not run in a smooth continuos flow because of all the out-of-cycle work that the operators need to do, including running three different sub-assembly stations and change over material racks. The result of the project is that the tracks should be produced in sequence, in the same order that they are used. This solution gives the smallest buffers, shortest lead times and needs no additional equipment. It requires little floor space and allows for good material handling. The weaknesses of the solution, quality and reliability, are handled with quality assurances and a buffer of finished tracks. No forklift is needed, the material is transported with <b>tuggers</b> from the Distribution Centre in sequence. The floor space needed is decreased with 250 square metres compared to the present situation. 1. 5 operator less is needed per shift, the stockholding cost is reduced with 22, 500 Australian dollars yearly and the lead time through the system is lowered from todays 18 - 45 hours, depending on track type, to about six hours. A trial of producing tracks in sequence was conducted which did not show any unexpected problems with the solution and we recommend Futuris to do further trials to ensure that the line balancing is reasonable and practical and that the cycle time is matching the takt time before deciding upon implementing it.

40|$|Heerema Marine Contractors is {{building}} the world’s largest semi-submersible crane vessel ‘Sleipnir’. During the design phase of this vessel, model tests {{were performed to}} evaluate the hydrodynamic properties. In the model test, a significant roll motion at a period of 40 s was found. Because this response is not {{within the range of}} first order wave excitation, it received great attention. Later, the 40 s is proved to be the natural roll period of the vessel which can be excited by the difference frequency of the two first order wave components, thus it is called a 2 nd order roll in this thesis. The aim of this thesis is to explain this phenomenon in a better way and to investigate whether this 2 nd order roll identified in the model test will be a true problem in reality. In {{the first part of the}} thesis, the physical reasons for the existence of 2 nd order roll as well as the methodology to quantify 2 nd order roll are discussed. Besides the resonance effect, the nonlinear excitation is proved to be quite considerable and the damping ratio is low within the natural frequency range because of the ship’s shape features. For the nonlinear excitations, Quadratic Transfer Functions (QTF’s) are firstly calculated based on the Pinkster’s theory. The second order forces and moments are further simulated by three methods in both frequency domain and time domain, where the advantages and limitations of each method are discussed. For the damping, special attention is paid to the linearization method in the frequency domain and the application of Cummins’ equation in the time domain. The use of a cubic damping term is proposed to fix the inaccuracies of the current methods. Furthermore, the second order roll motion is simulated both in the frequency domain and time domain. All simulations are validated by comparing the results with the measured data from the model test. Multi-directional wave conditions are also simulated to make the methodology applicable in the real world. The second part of the thesis discusses an important phenomenon in the second order roll, i. e. the variance of the standard deviation of each simulation is quite large. The reasons for this phenomenon are the non-uniqueness in the excitation and the low damping ratio. Thus 2 nd order roll should be predicted as a probability distribution instead of a specific value because it has a much larger variance compared to the first order motions. The sensitivity of the factors makes the model test and the real situation different, and the factors causing a difference in the real situation are discussed by an explanation of the physical reasons supported by simulations. In the third part, the discussion is moved on to the reality. The second order roll is identified from offshore measurements of the existing semi-submersible ‘Thialf’, in both the free floating and free hanging stage. It is further used to validate the simulation methodology and the discussed characteristics for 2 nd order roll. In the end the operability of the Sleipnir is evaluated, and it is concluded that the 2 nd order roll actually has a dominant contribution to the overall roll motion. However, with the 2 nd order roll included, Sleipnir’s roll motion is still acceptable. The overall roll motion stays below a maximum amplitude of 0. 5 degree in the normal operational sea states (HsTp 2 < 75). As mitigations, bilge keels, <b>tuggers</b> and DP systems are proposed for the 2 nd order roll phenomenon. Offshore and dredging engineerin...|$|R
