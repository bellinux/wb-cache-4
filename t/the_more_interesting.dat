25|$|The {{empirical}} {{data to support}} the media equation is thorough and expansive. Studies have tested {{a wide variety of}} communication characteristics with the media – manners, personality, emotion, social roles and form. Below are explanations of some of <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> findings that support the media equation.|$|E
25|$|Technology may {{be viewed}} as a threat to those who {{perceive}} that automation might replace jobs. A benefit of continuous auditing is that it performs routine, repetitive tasks and provides the opportunity for <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> exploratory work that adds far more value to the organization.|$|E
50|$|The European Parliament, National broadcasters, the EBU, {{with the}} {{cooperation}} of the Communication Commissioner, Margot Wallström, are jointly working to make <b>the</b> 2009 election <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> to <b>the</b> public and increase turnout. Previously, diverse news media in the European Union, {{and the fact that the}} election takes place over several days, have made it hard to attract viewers. The media consortium is hoping to focus <b>the</b> 2009 election <b>more</b> towards <b>the</b> EU level and the European Parliament itself, hoping to make <b>the</b> election <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> and cosmetically appealing for television viewers. Members of the European Parliament (MEP) also started initiatives in late 2007 to make <b>the</b> election <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> to voters in a bid to increase turnout.|$|R

25|$|The second option, {{and perhaps}} <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> one, is that India {{can choose to}} access the third stage of thorium {{reactors}} by skipping the more difficult second stage of the plan through some appropriately selected parallel approach such as the high-temperature gas-cooled reactor, the molten salt reactor, or the various accelerator driven systems.|$|E
25|$|The {{study of}} birds in India {{during the colonial}} period began with hunting and it was only later that more careful {{observations}} were made. Many civil servants and army officers took an interest in hunting for sport and often made notes on the birds that they shot while some of <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> species were skinned and sent back to museums in England for identification.|$|E
25|$|Among <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> of Ludlow’s {{articles}} was “E Pluribus Unum”, {{published in}} The Galaxy in November 1866. It reviews attempts by pre-relativistic physicists {{to unify the}} known forces into a single force. It is occasionally anachronistic, as when Ludlow reviews failed attempts to explain the enormous energy radiated from the sun using classical physics, eventually settling on the heat given off by incoming meteor collisions as the most likely explanation.|$|E

25|$|The {{unabridged}} version {{contains many}} illustrations with drawings, photogravures, and coloured maps. It also contains vivid narratives of personal adventures of the author, {{his views on}} British expansionism, passages of deep reflection about the requirements of a civilised government, criticism of military and political leaders and religion. The first edition was reviewed by The Times, which described it as containing material sufficient for two good books and one bad one, with the bad one being <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>interesting.</b>|$|E
25|$|These anecdotes provide {{glimpses of}} {{other aspects of}} these {{prominent}} people, sharing, actually, greater realization of their humanity and the human concerns of their officials and ordinary subjects. One of <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> passages is {{the account of the}} symposium held at the home of Harun al-Rashid's famous vizier Yahya the Barmakid on the topic of love. A dozen leading thinkers provide their definition of love and then a thirteenth, a Magian judge, speaks at greater length on that theme.|$|E
25|$|This final {{critique}} of writing {{with which the}} dialogue concludes {{seems to be one}} of <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> facets of the conversation for those who seek to interpret Plato in general; Plato, of course, comes down to us through his numerous written works, and philosophy today is concerned almost purely with the reading and writing of written texts. It seems proper to recall that Plato's ever-present protagonist and ideal man, Socrates, fits Plato's description of the dialectician perfectly, and never wrote a thing.|$|E

25|$|Perhaps one of <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> discoveries {{were the}} avian remains found in Unit II. The {{skeletal}} remains of an immature sea bird was found, careful positioned with small fish and crab remains, {{in association with}} a right handprint pressed into {{a large piece of}} mortar. Another bird skeleton was found along with carefully arranged sticks parallel to one another. Two more sets of avian related materials were found: a large amount of bird guano and a scattering of bird down.|$|E
25|$|First, Archie is not {{a friend}} but a paid employee, who acts as secretary, chauffeur, and legman to the mountainous and {{sedentary}} Wolfe. Then they differ in all important respects—age, background, physique, and education. Finally, {{it is impossible to}} say which is <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> and admirable of the two. They are complementary in the unheard-of ratio of 50-50. … Archie has talents without which Wolfe would be lost: his remarkable memory, trained physical power, brash American humor, attractiveness to women, and ability to execute the most difficult errand virtually without instructions. Minus Archie, Wolfe would be a feckless recluse puttering in an old house on West 35th Street, New York.|$|E
25|$|Following {{submission}} of their application, TVS were anticipating {{that they would}} be forced into a shotgun marriage with Southern, but in the event TVS won outright against the seven other contenders since their plans for a better mix of programmes and greater investment were considered good enough to operate the franchise alone. This was the official line given by the IBA, but it was also considered that Southern's non-local ownership (the majority shareholders were companies based in London and Dundee) and their very conservative nature led to it being dropped in favour of <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> proposals made by TVS in their franchise application.|$|E

25|$|Sean Humby {{created a}} variant of maka dai dai shogi called Hishigata shogi. (See the {{external}} link below.) It was motivated by criticisms that maka dai dai takes {{a very long time}} to finish, and that <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> pieces have little opportunity for play. The only difference is in the setup, which places the opposing pieces close together and leaves the armies' rear flanks exposed, though Humby recommends that the teaching king be played as the weaker Western variant (as a queen), probably referring to the single alternative offered by Sean Evans' ShogiVar software, which is Queen plus 3-step King with full lion power, no longer believed to be the correct move by anyone.|$|E
25|$|The seventh {{edition of}} Yudh Abhyas is {{currently}} underway since 5 March 2012 in two locations under the South Western Command. The US Army contingent {{is from the}} US Army Pacific (USARPAC), part of the United States Pacific Command (USPACOM). The Command Post Exercise has an engineer brigade headquarters with its planners from both sides, while the Field Training Exercise comprises troops of the 2nd Squadron 14th US Cavalry Regiment from the 25th Infantry Division, Hawaii, along with a platoon of Strykers, and a similar sized Indian Army contingent of mechanised infantry. The event is all <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> {{as a number of}} key surveillance, communications and Improvised Explosive Devices detection and neutralisation technologies, available to both sides have been fielded in the exercise.|$|E
25|$|When copies are not {{sufficient}} for accurate transcription, PJM staff may travel to the repositories to view the originals of Madison's papers. Many originals are held by the Library of Congress and the National Archives of the United States. The Library of Congress makes digital images of their collection available free for online public viewing via American Memory. This resource allows interested scholars {{to become familiar with}} the evolution of Madison's style over his lifetime, and also gives them the opportunity to see the varieties of penmanship and languages Madison had to decipher. Interpreting some of these more complex documents, particularly those from non-native English speakers and from correspondents with limited formal education, is one of <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> challenges the PJM staff deals with on a regular basis.|$|E
5000|$|In 2009, RaboDirect ran <b>the</b> Life's <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> {{when you}} tell the truth {{marketing}} campaign that included TV commercials which featured staff confessing truths about themselves, and a microsite called Truthbank where customers could [...] "confess" [...] their own truths.|$|R
60|$|The {{correspondence}} delivered included (exactly as Sir Patrick had foreseen) {{a letter}} from Lady Lundie.

25|$|In the end, {{options for}} the {{financing}} of the purchase came down to two companies, Westpac and Allco Leasing. One of <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> notes to the Allco proposal {{was the nature of}} the financing arrangements it was proposing. At the time of the proposed financing deal, interest rates in Australia were around 16-17%, placing a significant burden on companies in their business dealings. To work around this, Allco proposed a financing structure that involved a cross-border financing arrangement in Japan. It also required the establishment of a special purposes lessor company, incorporated in the Cayman Islands, to minimise withholding tax liabilities from the Japanese and Australian taxation agencies. Allco refused to release specific information on the proposed structure, due to its policy prohibiting the release of specific details of this financing arrangement until it had secured a mandate for their services.|$|E
500|$|Hoffman {{was also}} {{discreet}} about his {{religious and political}} beliefs, but {{it is known that}} he voted for the Green Party candidate Ralph Nader in the 2000 presidential election. He felt that keeping his personal life private was beneficial to his career: [...] "The less you know about me <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> it will be to watch me do what I do".|$|E
500|$|Greg Burgas, of Comic Book Resources, critiqued Anarky as [...] "one of <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> {{characters}} of the past fifteen or twenty years [...] {{because of what he}} wants to accomplish..." [...] Burgas continued, comparing the nature of Anarky as a change agent against Batman: [...] "He is able to show how ineffective Batman is against the real problems of society, and although Batman stops his spree, we find ourselves sympathizing much more with Anarky than with the representative of the status quo." ...|$|E
