40|$|The {{measurement}} of the ultimate properties of elastomers is characterized by variability in the data. For example, when {{a sufficient number of}} specimens is tested, distributions in the values of the stress-at-break, strain-at-break, and <b>time-to-break</b> are commonly obtained. It is pointed out that such variability can be rationalized on the basis of variations in both the degree of crosslinking and in the size of naturally occurring flows present in the elastomer...|$|E
