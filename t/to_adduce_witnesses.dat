50|$|HOTA is {{an acronym}} for Home Office Type Approval, a testing and {{certification}} process by the Home Office in the United Kingdom that speed cameras must pass before evidence from them can be admissible in UK courts by way of certification in accordance with Section 20 of the Road Traffic Offenders Act 1988 (RTOA) (Amended by the Road Traffic Act 1991). It is a misconception that speed enforcement devices must be Home Office Type Approved before they may be deployed on public roads to gather evidence of speeding offences however if the device does not have UK Type Approval then the evidence from the device {{is not able to}} be certified but must be <b>adduced</b> by a <b>witness</b> and perhaps an expert witness who is able <b>to</b> <b>adduce</b> evidence of its accuracy. The RTOA route via Section 20 certification is a clear advantage over the unapproved equipment route to court.|$|R

(2) If the {{petitioner}} {{applies to}} the court for leave <b>to</b> <b>adduce</b> additional evidence, and shows {{to the satisfaction of}} the court that such additional evidence is material and that there were reasonable grounds for the failure <b>to</b> <b>adduce</b> such evidence in the proceeding before the Secretary, the court may order such additional evidence (and evidence in rebuttal thereof) to be taken before the Secretary, and <b>to</b> be <b>adduced</b> upon the hearing, in such manner and upon such terms and conditions as to the court may seem proper. The Secretary may modify findings, or make new findings, by reason of the additional evidence so taken, and the Secretary shall file such modified or new findings, and the Secretary's recommendations, if any, for the modification or setting aside of original regulation, with the return of such additional evidence.|$|R

50|$|On appeal, the Court of Appeals {{denied the}} Party's motion for leave <b>to</b> <b>adduce</b> {{additional}} evidence, which the Party had alleged {{would show that}} three witnesses for the Attorney General had committed perjury before the Board, and affirmed the Board's order.|$|R
50|$|In certain circumstances, {{the onus}} {{will be on}} the accused during the bail application. For a Schedule 6 offence, the accused has <b>to</b> <b>adduce</b> {{evidence}} <b>to</b> satisfy the court that exceptional circumstances exist in which the interests of justice permit his release. For a Schedule 5 offence, the accused has <b>to</b> <b>adduce</b> evidence <b>to</b> satisfy the court that the interests of justice permit his release. The court hearing such a bail application, when the offence is a Schedule 5 or 6 offence, must conduct a careful enquiry before deciding to release the accused on bail. (There must be proper proof that the offence is indeed a scheduled offence.) S v Rudolph is a prominent example of the application of this onus.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, let Sam do it!" [...] {{cried the}} unseen chorus. The first speaker, unnecessarily, perhaps--for the motion {{had been carried}} almost unanimously--but {{possibly}} {{with the idea of}} convincing the one member of the party in whose bosom doubts might conceivably be harboured, went on <b>to</b> <b>adduce</b> reasons.|$|R

60|$|He was {{followed}} briefly by the Solicitor-General and Mr. Fiddlestick; but though they talked fluently enough, addressing themselves to various minor points, {{they had nothing}} fresh of interest <b>to</b> <b>adduce,</b> and finishing at half-past three, James rose to reply on the whole case {{on behalf of the}} plaintiff.|$|R

50|$|Apart from this, {{the accused}} was {{compelled}} <b>to</b> <b>adduce</b> evidence {{in order to}} avoid a conviction. The effect of the presumption therefore was to force the accused to break his silence. Therefore, s 72(4) limited the rights to be presumed innocent and to remain silent guaranteed in s 35(3)(h) of the Constitution.|$|R

If, for example, it is necessary <b>to</b> <b>adduce</b> evidence, {{this can be done}} under the proviso to s 102(1) of the interim Constitution prior to the referral of the matter to this Court. The issues should also be properly canvassed in the written arguments.|$|R
25|$|The {{burden of}} persuasion should not be {{confused}} with the evidential burden, or burden of production, or duty of producing (or going forward with) evidence which is an obligation that may shift between parties over the course of the hearing or trial.

5000|$|In Ex parte Harmse, an {{important}} case in South African insolvency law, the applicant’s statement indicated {{an excess of}} assets over liabilities, but the only evidence that he <b>adduced</b> <b>to</b> prove otherwise were certain letters written by estate agents or valuers.

25|$|In most civil trials, the {{plaintiff}} begins the proceedings {{by making a}} speech opening his or her case. After {{the plaintiff}} has presented all the evidence {{on his or her}} behalf, the defendant must decide whether or not <b>to</b> <b>adduce</b> evidence. If he or she elects not to do so, the plaintiff may make a speech closing his or her case, and the defendant then proceeds to state his or her case. However, if the defendant elects <b>to</b> <b>adduce</b> evidence, he or she proceeds to open his or her case, present the evidence on his or her behalf, and make a speech closing the case. The plaintiff may then make a speech in reply. If any party in his or her final speech raises a fresh point of law or cites any authority not previously cited, the other party may make a further speech in reply to that point of law or authority.|$|R
50|$|This {{case has}} been {{followed}} by R v Walker, where an individual accused of shoplifting attempted <b>to</b> <b>adduce</b> expert evidence of their condition, which it was claimed made them more vulnerable to threats of duress. While the case was described as borderline by the Court of Appeal, {{it was decided that}} such evidence could be properly admitted where it was not commonly found in ordinary individuals. A strict approach to such evidence has faced criticism in some cases, with the decision of R v Masih highlighting how a borderline case may be difficult for the courts. Here, an individual with an IQ of 72 was not permitted <b>to</b> <b>adduce</b> expert evidence of his difficulties in comprehension, social situations, and of his particular vulnerabilities. Had his IQ been three points lower at 69, he would have been seen in law as having a mental defect, and thus such evidence would have been admissible.|$|R
50|$|At the appeal, the {{prosecution}} was given permission <b>to</b> <b>adduce</b> additional evidence <b>to</b> the effect that in 2001 Fricker had been convicted in Switzerland of multiple incidents of damaging public property. However, the Court said {{that it did not}} take this into consideration as {{the prosecution}} had provided insufficient information about the earlier conviction. Fricker's caning, postponed pending the appeal, would now be carried out.|$|R
25|$|In retrospect, {{although}} Ahlquist {{was right}} in his ″one transmitter – two receptors″ postulate, he erred {{in the identification of}} the transmitter with adrenaline. There is an additional qualification. For many responses to sympathetic nerve stimulation, the ATP co-stored with noradrenaline (see above) is a cotransmitter. It acts through purinoceptors. Lastly, Ahlquist failed <b>to</b> <b>adduce</b> the selectivity of all antagonists known at his time for the α-adrenoceptor as an additional argument.|$|R

40|$|This thesis aims <b>to</b> <b>adduce</b> new {{arguments}} <b>to</b> {{the discussion}} concerning the Italo-Celtic hypothesis from the nominal derivational morphology {{of the relevant}} languages.

50|$|On remand, the Board denied several motions {{filed by}} the Party seeking to {{introduce}} additional evidence. The Court of Appeals also denied a motion by the party for leave <b>to</b> <b>adduce</b> additional evidence, but granted the Board permission to consider a motion by the Party regarding another of the Attorney General's witnesses who had also allegedly committed perjury. The Board granted the Party's motion, reopened the hearings, and the witness was recalled and crossexamined.|$|R
50|$|Ruhlen {{believes}} his classification of the world's languages {{is supported by}} population genetics research by the geneticist Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza, who has identified the distribution of certain human genes in populations throughout the world.

Cavalli-Sforza's findings are argued to match up remarkably well with Ruhlen's language classification. Ruhlen's linguist opponents hold that genetic relatedness cannot be used <b>to</b> <b>adduce</b> linguistic relatedness.|$|R
