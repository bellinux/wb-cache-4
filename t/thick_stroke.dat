Doing this requires a writing instrument responsive to the user's drawing pressure: specialist fountain pens (with fine, flexible nibs) were originally used, but pencils are now more commonly used.|$|E

50|$|Uniquely for Adobe's {{professional}} typefaces, a {{basic set}} of Utopia's styles has been open-sourced by Adobe, {{allowing it to}} be used for free. This comprises regular, italic, bold and bold italic styles of the regular size, with 229 glyphs for each, including ligatures but not small capitals. Adobe donated the Utopia typeface (in the form of PostScript Type 1 files) to the X Consortium, for use in the X Window System, a popular graphical environment for Unix workstations. Conversions of the Type 1 files to ttf and otf files have also been made. This release is designed for use at small text sizes, with a large x-height and quite <b>thick</b> <b>stroke</b> widths. Adobe retains rights to the Utopia name, and prohibits modified fonts from being redistributed without the name being changed.|$|E

50|$|This is {{the only}} {{manuscript}} of the Beatus Commentary on the Apocalypse of Liébana, also called Beatus, produced in Portugal during the Middle Ages. This is a relatively primitive version of the text, probably copied from a ninth century original. It is written in a Carolingian minuscule style that made {{the transition to the}} Gothic. His miniatures are at number 70, including 18 full-page, 20 of the half-page and the other smaller and variable dimensions. The manuscript also retains its original binding.These illustrations were considered archaic for the time, marked by a <b>thick</b> <b>stroke</b> and colors dominated by orange and yellow. They may have been copied from an older model, perhaps close to the original manuscript written by Beatus of Liebana. There are also repeatedly scenes of everyday life at the time of Sancho I of Portugal. Finally, Beatus map belonging to the manuscript has been preserved but only half of it. It was reunited with the manuscript after being separated from it.|$|E
30|$|Paint is {{not only}} used by artists as a direct colorant, but, as with sculptures, its {{material}} presence {{can also be used}} to create texture or apply shadows or highlights. When enjoying the view of a painting, we are not always conscious of the impact that the painting’s topography has on its depiction. Van Gogh sometimes painted flower petals with a single <b>thick</b> <b>stroke,</b> and the ambient lighting would do the rest by casting shadows and reflecting highlights. In other works, such as those of Rembrandt, the painting shows its age through craquelure, a three dimensional process where the paint has cracked apart, leaving dark canyons in the topography.|$|E
50|$|As a {{somewhat}} precise design that emphasises contrast between <b>thick</b> and thin <b>strokes,</b> modern designers may prefer different revivals for different text sizes, printing methods and onscreen display, since a design intended to appear elegant in large text sizes could look too spindly for body text. Factors {{which would be}} taken into account include compensation for size and ink spread, if any (the extent of which depends on printing methods and type of paper used; it does not occur on screens). Among digitisations, František Štorm's extremely complete range of versions is particularly praised for featuring three optical sizes, the text version having <b>thicker</b> <b>strokes</b> to increase legibility as metal type does. Meanwhile, the common digitisation of Baskerville Old Face bundled with many Microsoft products features dramatic contrasts between thin and <b>thick</b> <b>strokes.</b> This makes it most suited to headings, especially since it does not have an italic.|$|R

50|$|Along with Giambattista Bodoni of Italy, Firmin Didot is {{credited}} with establishing {{the use of the}} Didone or 'Modern' style of serif typefaces. The types that Didot used are characterized by extreme contrast in <b>thick</b> <b>strokes</b> and thin strokes, by the use of hairline serifs and by the vertical stress of the letters. Many fonts today are available based on Firmin Didot's typefaces, and are often called Didot as a result.|$|R

50|$|An {{eccentric}} {{method of}} reworking and parodying Didone typefaces {{has long been}} to invert the contrast, making the thin <b>strokes</b> <b>thick</b> and the <b>thick</b> <b>strokes</b> thin. First seen around 1821 in Britain and occasionally revived since, these are often called reverse-contrast fonts. They effectively become slab serif designs because of the serifs becoming thick. In the 19th century, these designs were called Italian because of their exotic appearance, but this name is problematic since the designs have no clear connection with Italy; they do slightly resemble capitalis rustica Roman writing, although {{this may be a}} coincidence. They were also called Egyptian, an equally inauthentic term applied to slab serifs of the period.|$|R

5000|$|OCR-A is a font {{that arose}} {{in the early days}} of {{computer}} optical character recognition when there was a need for a font that could be recognized not only by the computers of that day, but also by humans.

50|$|His {{work is a}} {{quest to}} find the visual {{equivalent}} for the complex interaction between imagination, feeling, consciousness and the painting technique itself. To achieve this goal, Dillemans says, painters have a difficult and at times tedious task to fulfill. They cannot not {{be satisfied with the}} clear perception of reality as an evidence of truth, but must try harder to understand more fully their subjects. With <b>thick</b> <b>strokes</b> and an impressive relief on the surface, Dillemans's style contains a refined form of elasticity and plasticity.|$|R
50|$|Although Évariste Carpentier {{only gave}} up his studio in Paris in 1892, he {{returned}} to Belgium in 1886. There, he witnessed the increasing popularity of impressionism among artists from Brussels, such as Les XX. During his long stay in France, {{he had already been}} exposed to impressionists, but he had been influenced to a greater extent by the naturalism of Jules Bastien-Lepage and Jules Breton. His initial outdoor paintings, which had been produced with darker, <b>thicker</b> <b>strokes,</b> gave way to a noticeably brighter palette and progressively lighter brushstrokes.|$|R
5000|$|The concept, {{now called}} as reverse-contrast or reverse-stress type, predated Clarendon altogether.

5000|$|Lee was an {{advertising}} design director and designed Impact with posters and publicity material in mind. Its <b>thick</b> <b>strokes,</b> compressed letterspacing, and minimal interior counterform are specifically aimed, {{as its name}} suggests, to [...] "impact". Impact has a high x-height, reaching nearly to three-quarters the capital line. Ascenders are short, and descenders even shorter. With narrow apertures and folded-up letterforms, the lower-case can be quite hard to read printed small, especially for people with vision problems. The face is intended for headlines and display use rather than body text. As a display design, it was not released with an italic or bold weight.|$|R
