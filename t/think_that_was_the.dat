500|$|Davis played {{through a}} {{shoulder}} injury early in the 1993 season. Defensive end Reggie White, who signed with the Green Bay Packers following the 1992 season after spending eight seasons with the Eagles and earned seven Pro Bowl selections, said that he believed he destroyed Davis' confidence as a rookie and second-year player, as Davis had to go up against White in practice every week. White said [...] "there are some guys who get very discouraged because they can't block you. I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> situation at times with Antone." [...] Davis, however, disputed White's statements as the Eagles played against the Packers in {{the second week of}} the season. Dave Goldberg, a writer for the Associated Press, named Davis to his [...] "all-" [...] team after his performance against White. Davis started in every game for the Eagles at right tackle in 1993.|$|E
500|$|Writing for The A.V. Club, Todd VanDerWerff {{rated the}} episode an A, calling it [...] "an {{occasionally}} beautiful, occasionally haunting, often overwritten story". He {{felt that the}} episode took the uncommon route of tying together several previously-mentioned aspects of the series' mythology, making it [...] "easy to believe the pieces might come together at this point". However, VanDerWerff {{also noted that the}} episode's two main plot threads—Scully's cancer and Mulder's investigation—seemed [...] "clumsily grafted" [...] together, and did not explore the theme of living with the fear of death as well as the previous episode, [...] "Never Again", had done. Frank Spotnitz praised the episode, saying, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> best mythology episode we ever did. It's my favorite one". Chris Carter has stated that he feels [...] "Memento Mori" [...] ranks [...] "among the best mythology episodes of all nine seasons".|$|E

500|$|The episode {{features}} a guest appearance by actor William Daniels as KITT, a character from the Knight Rider television series of which Homer is a fan. KITT is an artificially intelligent electronic computer module installed in an automobile. In the episode, {{after failing to}} cheer Homer up with a film reel of his life, the family shows him a video featuring KITT. The automobile, seen driving in the desert, tells Homer the following: [...] "Hello Homer. It's me, KITT, from TV's Knight Rider. Your family has asked me to invite you to a very special ..."; the film reel breaks just before KITT finishes his sentence. This of course leads to Homer becoming even more depressed. [...] Daniels' appearance in [...] "The Wizard of Evergreen Terrace" [...] {{was the first and}} only time that he voiced KITT outside of Knight Rider and the film Knight Rider 2000. He recalls that [...] "when I told my son in New York that I {{was going to be on}} The Simpsons, I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> first time that he was really impressed with what I was doing! The Simpsons is a great show and I'm glad they thought of KITT in one of their jokes." ...|$|E
500|$|For the {{flashback}} {{scene at}} the Tower of Joy, actor Robert Aramayo was cast to play a young Eddard Stark. In an interview with Access Hollywood, Aramayo stated {{that he was a}} big fan of the series, and that [...] "it was an honor and a gift {{to be able to be}} a part of it." [...] In regards to portraying the character similar to Sean Bean, who played Eddard Stark in the first season, Aramayo noted, [...] "I didn't want to get too hung up in sounding like Sean because I think that would've sort of got in my way if I'd have just situated all my work in that place. I watched a lot of footage of him playing Ned in the first season again, repeatedly, especially one particular fight scene that he was in and I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> biggest help for me when creating this version of Ned – was watching what Sean did with Ned in the first season and trying to work out what a younger man's version of that is." [...] In a separate interview with The Hollywood Reporter Aramayo spoke about auditioning for the role, stating, [...] "The chance to audition to be on the show was a dream, even to audition. It was an absolute dream to me. I was very excited to audition, and landing the role was beyond my wildest dreams. Then when I found out the role was Ned, it was overwhelming." ...|$|E
500|$|Writer and supervising {{producer}} Brad Kern {{reflected on}} the show's cancellation, saying, [...] "Ten years later, everybody you talk to... they all love the show. I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> biggest disappointment about the show not coming back. We knew we were doing something special." [...] Told of the show's success in the TV Guide [...] "Save Our Shows" [...] poll, Sandy Grushow said, [...] "Obviously I'm happy and not entirely surprised", but added, [...] "You can't dismiss a season's worth of ratings." [...] Kim Manners, director on {{nearly a third of}} the Brisco episodes, said working on the series gave him an opportunity to grow creatively. He told writer Joe Nazzaro, [...] "It really woke me up as a director, almost spiritually", and that directing for Brisco was a large contributing factor to his success as a regular director on The X-Files. Manners said, [...] "When they didn't give it a second year, I was devastated", adding that he wished Cuse would have made a feature film based on Brisco. Considering the show's short life, Cuse later commented, [...] "If the show could have survived into a second season, I think it could have ended up running for actually a long time. Some shows just sort of fall through the cracks in the right away and they kind of stay on the air long enough to aggregate an audience. I think if circumstances had been different, Brisco could have had a much longer life." [...] Cuse also said the Friday night time slot hurt Briscos chances of building an audience, saying, [...] "We were on at 8 p.m. on Friday night, which is sort of a death slot– I mean people do still go bowling– few shows have succeeded in that slot." ...|$|E

2500|$|Chevrolet {{designer}} Clare MacKichan recalled {{about creating}} the Chevy II: [...] "There {{was no time}} for experimentation or doodling around with new ideas from either the engineers or from us in design; And {{it had to be a}} basic-type car." [...] The 1962 Chevy II rode a 110-inch wheelbase, compared to 109.5 for the Ford Falcon, at which Chevy's new compact was aimed. [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> quickest program we ever did at any time," [...] he continued. [...] "We worked night and day on that car, and it didn't take very long to run it through our shop because we had a deadline." [...] And that's what made the Chevy II one of the fastest new-car development programs in GM history – just 18 months after the designers got the green light, the first production Chevy II rolled off the Willow Run, Michigan, assembly line in August 1961, in time for its September 29 introduction. Unlike the Corvair, the 1962 Chevy II was deliberately never intended to be revolutionary in concept or execution; its mission was to give Chevrolet buyers a simple, back-to-the-basics compact car. When he announced the Chevy II to the press, Chevrolet General Manager Ed Cole described the car as offering [...] "maximum functionalism with thrift." ...|$|E
