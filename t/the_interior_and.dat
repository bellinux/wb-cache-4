40|$|Deductive Inference for <b>the</b> <b>Interiors</b> <b>and</b> Exteriors of Horn TheoriesIn this paper, we {{investigate}} the deductive inference for <b>the</b> <b>interiors</b> <b>and</b> exteriors of Horn knowledge bases, where <b>the</b> <b>interiors</b> <b>and</b> exteriors were introduced by Makino and Ibaraki [11] to study stability properties of knowledge bases. We present a linear time algorithm for the deduction for <b>the</b> <b>interiors</b> <b>and</b> {{show that it}} is co-NP-complete for the deduction for the exteriors. Under model-based representation, we show that the deduction problem for interiors is NP-complete while the one for exteriors is co-NP-complete. As for Horn envelopes of the exteriors, we show that it is linearly solvable under model-based representation, while it is co-NP-complete under formula-based representation. We also discuss the polynomially solvable cases for all the intractable problems...|$|R

5|$|A solar chimney (or thermal chimney, in this context) is {{a passive}} solar {{ventilation}} system {{composed of a}} vertical shaft connecting <b>the</b> <b>interior</b> <b>and</b> exterior of a building. As the chimney warms, the air inside is heated causing an updraft that pulls air through the building. Performance can be improved by using glazing and thermal mass materials {{in a way that}} mimics greenhouses.|$|E

An attempt to retake Malta ended disastrously, however, when the local population sided with the Arabs and massacred the Byzantine garrison.|$|E
