500|$|Enough Said was {{the fifth}} film written and {{directed}} by Nicole Holofcener. After the release of her fourth film, Please Give (2010), she was approached by Matthew Greenfield and Claudia Lewis from Fox Searchlight, who offered to produce Holofcener's next project on the condition that it was more mainstream than her previous films. She wrote three drafts of the screenplay over six months. The premise was partly inspired by Holofcener's own life as a divorced mother of two teenagers and her [...] "feelings and fears about what [...] life will be like when [...] kids go away". While writing the film, she said, [...] "I was having thoughts about my ex-husband and my new boyfriend and thinking about being married and how I'm <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> relationship that's happier the second time." [...] Small details of the plot were also drawn from her life; Albert's guacamole-eating habit was inspired by a story that her boyfriend told her about his ex-wife.|$|E

At another, Ben impersonates former President Ronald Reagan, which prompts Leslie, pretending to be United Kingdom Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, to say, [...] "Oh, President Reagan, my blazer popped open." [...] In a different scene, Andy seeks to write a song for Li'l Sebastian that is 5,000 times better than Elton John's [...] "Candle in the Wind", which inspires him to write the original song [...] "5,000 Candles in the Wind". Other songs played during Li'l Sebastian's memorial service include [...] "Wild Horses" [...] by The Rolling Stones and [...] "A Horse with No Name" [...] by America. In an attempt to explain to someone that she and Ben were hugging, Leslie explains she recently won a McArthur Genius Grant and that Ben was simply congratulating her. In addition, during Tom and Jean-Ralphio's eulogy presentation for Lil' Sebastian, a still of the Trifid Nebula in Sagittarius is seen. The image is more popularly recognized as the cover art for progressive rock band King Crimson's 1971 album Islands.|$|E

2500|$|According to Sexual Health Resource, [...] "The man-on-top sex {{positions}} {{are very good}} for couples who are <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> baby, because penetration can be very deep. If the woman holds on to her legs behind her knees and draws her thighs right back, sperm can be deposited deep in the vaginaâ€”at {{the neck of the}} womb. This provided the best chance of conception occurring." [...] Getting Pregnant Tips notes the importance of not using too large a sex pillow while in the missionary position as it can cause the sperm to pool behind the cervix. Francoeur states that [...] "male-above sex promotes fertility by keeping the opening of the vagina higher than the seminal pool, which, in turn, helps sperm get into the womb and find the egg." [...] However, according to BabyCenter, [...] "There is no evidence that any particular sexual position is more likely to lead to conception." [...] Donnica Moore agrees, stating that while there are no scientific studies regarding the best sexual positions for reproduction, the missionary (man on top) position is typically considered optimal for conception.|$|E
