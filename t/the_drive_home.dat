He decides {{to stay in}} the car by himself to {{continue}} listening after they reach home and accidentally hits the gear shift, causing the car to move forward. Thinking he can drive, Stewie takes the car for a ride and is thrilled by the experience. He hears on the car radio a contest to win Justin Bieber concert tickets. Stewie calls the radio station on his cell phone but loses control of the car and crashes into a lamppost. (Herbert is heard on the radio winning the tickets.)

2500|$|When he {{returned}} to the camp he and Patterson aborted their plan to remain looking for more evidence and departed for home, fearing the rain would wash out their exit. After attempting to go out along [...] "the low road"—Bluff Creek Road—and finding it blocked by a mudslide, they went instead up the steep Onion Mountain Road, off whose shoulder their truck slipped; extracting it required the (unauthorized) borrowing of a nearby front-end loader. <b>The</b> <b>drive</b> <b>home</b> from their campsite covered about 580 miles, the initial 28.8 miles on a low-speed logging road, and then about 110 miles on twisty Route 96. Driving a truck with three horses, and allowing for occasional stops, it would have taken 13 hours to get home Saturday evening, at an average speed of 45mph; it would have taken 14.5 hours at a 40mph average speed.|$|E
