5|$|Satchel {{was easier}} to catch. He could <b>throw</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> a quart cup. But Rogan {{was all over the}} plate—high, low, inside, outside. He'd walk five-six men, but he didn't give up many runs. Bullet had a little more steam on the ball than Paige—and he had a better-breaking curve. The batters thought it was a fastball heading for them and they would jump back from the plate and all of a sudden, it would break sharply for a strike. I would rank him with today's best. I have never seen a pitcher like him, and I have caught some of the best {{pitchers}} in the business.|$|E
5|$|Another bombshell is {{dropped in}} Dimitri's {{life when he}} finds out that Anton Lang, who he {{believed}} to be the son of two Marick family employees, is really his son with his maid, Corvina Lang (Margaret Sophie Stein). Dimitri had had a drunken one-night stand with Corvina which he had no memory of. Dimitri is happy to finally be a father, but Corvina convinces him not to tell Anton the truth right away. Dimitri attempts to forge relationship with Anton so it will ease the shock of the news. Nevertheless, Anton, who had believed Corvina was his sister, doesn't take the news of his parentage well and marries Kendall to <b>throw</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> Dimitri's face. Eventually, Anton sees Kendall for the manipulator that she is and divorces her. Anton and Dimitri manage to work things out before Anton leaves town.|$|E
25|$|After Beatty has left, Montag reveals to Mildred that, {{over the}} last year, he has {{accumulated}} a stash of books that he has kept hidden in their air-conditioning duct. In a panic, Mildred grabs a book and rushes to <b>throw</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> their kitchen incinerator. Montag subdues her and tells her {{that the two of}} them are going to read the books to see if they have value. If they do not, he promises the books will be burned, and all will return to normal.|$|E

25|$|Proceedings {{start at}} around 3pm with the {{throwing}} of twelve Sack Hoods. These are rolled hessian sacks sewn up {{to prevent them}} unrolling. This is a prequel to the main game, mainly for children. The youngsters in the crowd run for them when thrown and attempt {{to get them off}} the field. If they are tackled then they must immediately <b>throw</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the air unless the challenger is a Boggin in which case the hood is ‘boggined’ and it is returned to the Lord who starts it off again.|$|E
500|$|In 1993, Povenmire and Marsh {{conceived}} the series Phineas and Ferb, {{based on their}} similar experiences of childhood summers spent outdoors. [...] Povenmire spent 14–16 years pitching Phineas and Ferb to several networks. Most rejected it as unfeasible for the complexity of its plots, but Povenmire persevered, later observing [...] "It was really the show we wanted to see: if this was on the air, I'd watch it, and I don't always feel that about every show I work on." [...] Even the Walt Disney Company initially rejected Povenmire's pitch, but asked to keep the proposal packet: [...] "Usually that means they <b>throw</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the trash later," [...] Povenmire recalled. [...] Eventually Disney called Povenmire back with an acceptance, {{on the condition that}} he would produce an 11-minute pilot. He called Marsh, who was living in England, to ask him if he would like to work on the pilot; Marsh accepted immediately and moved back to the United States.|$|E
500|$|The Akron Community Foundation {{established}} a Dante Lavelli Scholarship Fund in 2010 to help Hudson High athletes pay for college. [...] "He {{was one of}} the best I’d ever seen," [...] Willie Davis, a defensive end who played for the Browns shortly after Lavelli retired, said. [...] "He set the mold with his running patterns and catching the ball." [...] After Lavelli died, Graham praised his abilities and remembered his eagerness to get his hands on the ball. [...] "He was always coming into the huddle and telling me he was open and that I should throw to him," [...] Graham said. [...] "He wasn't saying that to be a big shot. He just loved to play. If he was open by a few inches, he'd be yelling, 'Otto, Otto.' Many a time when I was stuck and heard that voice I would <b>throw</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> his direction and darned if he didn't come down with it. He had fantastic hands." ...|$|E

500|$|Brooks did not {{direct and}} write a film again for seven years until 2004's Spanglish. Filming took six months, ending in June with three days of {{additional}} filming in October; Brooks produced three endings for the film, shooting several scenes in [...] "15 to 25 takes" [...] as {{he did not feel}} the film was tonally complete, although the script did not change much during filming. He opted to cast Adam Sandler in a more dramatic role than his usual goofball comedy parts based on his performance in Punch-Drunk Love and Sandler's relationship with his family. Describing the length of production, Brooks said: [...] "It's amazing how much more perverse you are as a writer than as a director. I remember just being so happy that I'd painted myself into some corners [...] I thought that would make it interesting. When I had to wrestle with that as a director, it was a different story." [...] Brooks's directing style [...] "drove [...] bats", especially Téa Leoni, with Cloris Leachman (who replaced an ill Anne Bancroft a month into filming) describing it as [...] "free-falling. You're not going for some result. It's just, <b>throw</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the air and see where it lands." [...] The film was poorly received and was a box-office failure.|$|E
500|$|Before {{completing}} The Way I See It, Saadiq previewed its {{songs in}} May 2008 to music industry associates and journalists at the Sony Club in New York City. He also planned a grassroots marketing {{strategy for the}} record, which evolved from his difficulty with Columbia executives to promote the album and their idea of issuing its songs as vinyl records. He felt that [...] "nobody at the label knew" [...] him {{in an interview with}} The Dallas Morning News: [...] "They had this record that I turned in that sounded like a '60s record. 'What the hell do we do with this record?' It was quality. There was not a lot of marketing and promotion, but they knew I had the credibility so you don't just <b>throw</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the garbage ... I don't mind being a [...] because that's actually a better road to take. I have to go in one more time and prove myself again because I am starting over again." [...] In the week leading up to its release, Saadiq made promotional appearances at V-103's For Sisters Only, the International Soul Music Summit, and the Uptown Restaurant & Lounge in Atlanta. He also performed songs from the album on VH1 Soulstage. Columbia released the album both on CD and as a collector's edition box set with 7-inch vinyl singles. In the United Kingdom, it was issued with two bonus tracks—a [...] "Euro version" [...] of [...] "Big Easy" [...] and the song [...] "Come On Home".|$|E
2500|$|In September 1895, Telephone No. 2 {{was fitted}} {{with the most}} {{powerful}} searchlight on the Columbia River, rated at 5,000 candle power. [...] The light was manufactured in New York and had been furnished by Campbell & Swigert, of Portland, and installed by their chief engineer, Joseph Gleason. [...] The light {{was reported to be}} “so simply constructed that the pilot can <b>throw</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> any desired position by the pressure of three fingers.” ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{boss of the}} ice themed level, Itamor, {{was changed}} from a large cat robot to an ice monster type robot. In the game, Ristar must grab hot dishes of food, and <b>throw</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> Itamor's mouth. In Japan, it was {{considered}} clever to use [...] "hot food" [...] to defeat a cat, due to a Japanese cultural reference regarding a [...] "cat-tongue" [...] not liking hot food. In English-speaking regions, that reference is non-existent, so it was changed to a [...] "cold ice monster" [...] being defeated by being melted by [...] "hot food".|$|E
2500|$|A story [...] from Amsterdam, 1345, {{claims that}} a priest {{was called to}} {{administer}} Viaticum to a dying man. He told the family that if the man threw up, they were to take the contents and <b>throw</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the fire. The man threw up, and the family did what the priest had advised them to do. The next morning, {{one of the women}} went to rake the fire and noticed the Host sitting on the grate, unscathed and surrounded by a light. It has apparently passed through both the man's digestive system and the fire unscathed. [...] The story is commemorated with an annual silent procession through central Amsterdam.|$|E
2500|$|Povenmire persisted {{and later}} pitched the series to Nickelodeon, {{where it was}} {{considered}} by high-level executives but rejected again as too complicated. Then, after 16 years of trying, Povenmire landed a pitch with Disney. The network did not immediately accept the show, but told Povenmire they would keep the packet. Povenmire assumed this meant an end to negotiations, aware that the phrase usually [...] "means they <b>throw</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the trash later." [...] Disney then surprised him by accepting. Said Povenmire, [...] "Disney {{was the first to}} say, 'Let's see {{if you can do it}} in 11 minutes.' We did it in the pilot and they said, 'Let's see if you can do it for 26 episodes.|$|E

2500|$|On August 11, 2011, {{major news}} media in Utah {{reported}} that Anderson had denounced the Democratic Party and had resigned his {{membership of the}} party. Anderson {{wrote in a letter}} to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee that [...] "Until the Democratic Party shows some spine and draws a line in the sand — that an end to the tax breaks for the wealthy needs to be part of any debt/budget bill — please take my name off your list." [...] He added: [...] "I'm done with the Democratic Party. As I said on Amy Goodman's show a couple years ago, I've put my 'Proud Democrat' coffee mug in storage. I think now I'll just <b>throw</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the garbage and have done with it" [...] and that [...] "The Constitution has been eviscerated while Democrats have stood by with nary a whimper.

2500|$|In the Wu-Tang Manual, {{a book by}} the RZA on {{the origins}} of the Wu-Tang Clan, he recalls a concert at which Biggie and Wu-Tang both performed, at which Raekwon and Ghostface were {{reportedly}} under the influence, and angry at some comments B.I.G. made in The Source. In RZA's view, had the artists and their entourages met up that night, things could have gotten violent, but nothing of the sort ever occurred. It is worth mentioning that on B.I.G.'s final studio album Life After Death he took a shot back at Raekwon on the song [...] "Kick in the Door" [...] (which was a diss song to several other rappers as well) with the line; [...] "Fuck that, why try/Throw bleach in ya eye" [...] which was a response to lyrics from Raekwon's song [...] "Ice Water", where Raekwon rhymed; [...] "...To top it all off, beefin' for White/Pullin' bleach out, tryin'a <b>throw</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> my eyesight." [...] On the posthumous 1997 song [...] "Victory," [...] released on Puff Daddy's album No Way Out, B.I.G. also rhymes, [...] "Militant/Y'all faggots ain't killin' shit," [...] in response to a Ghostface Killah line on the song [...] "Criminology" [...] where he raps; [...] "RZA baked the track and it's militant/Then I react like a convict, and start killin' shit." [...] It is also worth mentioning that B.I.G. chose RZA to produce the track [...] "Long Kiss Goodnight", a song allegedly aimed at Biggie's longtime rival Tupac Shakur, which appeared on Life After Death.|$|E
