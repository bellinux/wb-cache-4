BMT- 11 is a fibrosarcoma developed in C 57 BL/ 6 mice. The conditioned medium of BMT- 11 <b>tumour</b> <b>tissues</b> obtained from mice treated with various anti-cancer drugs had chemotactic activity for LAK cells (LAK-attractant activity). mRNA expression of interleukin (IL) - 1 alpha, IL- 6, IL- 8, interferon (IFN) -gamma, and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) -alpha was observed in untreated <b>tumour</b> <b>tissues,</b> which were not enhanced by cyclophosphamide treatment. mRNA expression of TGF-beta 1 was not detected in untreated <b>tumour</b> <b>tissues</b> by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), but was detected in <b>tumour</b> <b>tissues</b> treated with cyclophosphamide. Recombinant human TGF-beta 1 showed LAK-attractant activity at a concentration of 0. 1 ng ml- 1 and 1 ng ml- 1, whereas fresh splenocytes were not attracted by TGF-beta 1. Anti-TGF-beta 1 antibody inhibited LAK-attractant activity in the conditioned medium of <b>tumour</b> <b>tissues</b> treated with cyclophosphamide to approximately 35 % that of control at 100 micrograms ml- 1. These findings indicate that TGF-beta 1 produced in the <b>tumour</b> <b>tissues</b> of mice treated with anti-cancer drugs could be a LAK attractant. By a 4 h 51 Cr release assay of natural killer cell-resistant BMT- 11 tumour cells, we observed that TGF-beta 1 at a concentration from 0. 01 ng ml- 1 to 10 ng ml- 1 did not inhibit LAK activity in an effector phase.

40|$|Abstract Background Vascular endothelial {{growth factor}} (VEGF) {{is a potent}} mitogen for endothelial cells, and its {{expression}} has been correlated with increased tumour angiogenesis. Although numerous publications dealing with the measurement of circulating VEGF for diagnostic and therapeutic monitoring have been published, {{the relationship between the}} production of tissue VEGF and its concentration in blood is still unclear. The aims of this study were to determine: 1) The expression pattern of VEGF isoforms at the protein level in colorectal and lung adenocarcinoma in comparison to the pattern in corresponding adjacent normal tissues 2) The relationship between the expression pattern of VEGF and total level of circulating VEGF in the blood to clarify whether the results of measuring circulating VEGF can be used to predict VEGF expression in <b>tumour</b> <b>tissues.</b> Methods Ninety-four tissue samples were obtained from patients, 76 colorectal <b>tumour</b> <b>tissues</b> and 18 lung <b>tumour</b> <b>tissues.</b> VEGF protein expression pattern and total circulating VEGF were examined using western blot and capture ELISA, respectively. Results Three major protein bands were predominately detected in tumour samples with an apparent molecular mass under reducing conditions of 18, 23 and 26 kDa. The 18 kDa VEGF protein was expressed equally in both normal and colorectal <b>tumour</b> <b>tissues</b> and predominately expressed in normal tissues of lung, whereas the 23 and 26 kDa protein was only detected at higher levels in <b>tumour</b> <b>tissues.</b> The 18, 23 and 26 kDa proteins are believed to represent the VEGF 121, the VEGF 165 and the VEGF 189, respectively. There was a significant correlation of the expression of VEGF 165 with a smaller tumour size maximum diameter 189 with advanced clinical stage of colorectal tumours. The measurement of total circulating VEGF in serum revealed that cancer patients significantly (p Conclusion Our findings indicate that the expression patterns of VEGF isoforms are altered during tumourigenesis as certain isoform overexpression in <b>tumour</b> <b>tissues</b> correlated with <b>tumour</b> progression indicating their important role in tumour development.

40|$|Abstract Backgound Angiomotin is a newly {{discovered}} molecule that regulates the migration and tubule formation of endothelial cells. It therefore has {{been implicated in}} the control of angiogenesis under physiological and pathological conditions. This study examined the expression of angiomotin and its analogues, angiomotin-like 1 (L 1) and -like 2 (L 2) in breast <b>tumour</b> <b>tissues,</b> and analysed their correlation with angiogenesis and clinical outcomes. Methods Human breast tissues (normal n = 32 and tumours n = 120) were used. The levels of expression of angiomotin, L 1 and L 2 were determined using reverse transcription PCR. Microvessels were stained using antibodies against PECAM, von Willebrand factor (factor 8, or vWF) and VE-cadherin. The transcript levels of angiomotin and its analogues were assessed against the clinical and pathological background, including long term survival (120 months). Results Breast cancer tissues expressed {{significantly higher levels of}} angiomotin transcript, compared with normal mammary tissues (33. 1 ± 11 in normal versus 86. 5 ± 13. 7 in <b>tumour</b> <b>tissues,</b> p = 0. 003). Both L 1 and L 2 were seen at marginally higher levels in <b>tumour</b> than normal <b>tissues</b> but the difference was not statistically significant.

50|$|The FP is an {{infectious}} disease with horizontal transmission. An alphaherpesvirus called fibropapilloma-associated turtle herpesvirus (FPTHV) {{is believed to}} be the causative agent of the disease, though no real proof of its causality exists.

Possible factors include some parasites, bacteria, environmental pollutants, UV-light, changing water temperatures and biotoxins.

40|$|Purpose The {{tuberous}} sclerosis (TSC) genes TSC 1 and TSC 2 encode the protein products hamartin and tuberin, respectively, and are putative tumour suppressor genes. Germ-line mutation of either TSC gene {{leads to the}} development of the heritable disorder TSC. This disorder is characterized by the development of hamartomas in many organs and is associated with the proliferative lung disease, lymphangioleiomyomatosis, the brain tumour giant cell astrocytoma and occasionally with renal cell carcinoma. However, the TSC genes have not been studied in breast cancer. The current study investigated the expression of the TSC gene products and the potential mechanisms of their aberrancy in human breast cancer cells and tissues. Experimental design and results Using immunohistochemical analysis, both hamartin and tuberin were found to be strongly stained in normal mammary epithelial cells and weakly in stromal cells. In invasive <b>tumour</b> <b>tissues,</b> however, the staining of both proteins were to be markedly reduced (P < 0. 01). At message level, although normal and <b>tumour</b> <b>tissues</b> expressed both TSC products, the transcript levels of tuberin was significantly lower in <b>tumour</b> <b>tissues</b> compared with normal tissues (P < 0. 05). There was no statistical difference between node negative and node positive tumours with both hamartin and tuberin. Tumours from patients who developed recurrence and died from breast cancer had significantly low levels of tuberin compared with those who remained disease free (P = 0. 03 and 0. 05, respectively). Likewise, hamartin levels were significantly lower in patients with metastasis, recurrence and mortality, when compared with those remained disease free (P = 0. 001, 0. 041 and 0. 003, respectively). Using methylation specific PCR, the TSC 1 promoter was found to be heavily methylated in ZR 751, MDA MB 435, and BT 549, but not in MCF- 7 which expressed highly level of hamartin. TSC 1 promoter methylation was also seen in most breast tumours, but only in a limited number of normal tissues. The methylation of TSC 2 promoter appears to be less frequent. MDA MB 468, MDA MB 483, MDA MB 435 S and weakly MDA MB 435 were found to have methylated TSC 2 promoter. In breast tissues, however, a very small number of samples were found to have methylation of the TSC 2 promoter. Conclusion TSC 1 genes are aberrantly expressed in human breast cancer cell lines and breast <b>tumour</b> <b>tissues</b> and their promoters are seen to be methylated in breast <b>tumour</b> <b>tissues.</b> The expression of TSC 1 is associated with an unfavourable clinical outcome in patients with breast cancer...|$|R
50|$|Now {{with one}} single local {{application}} using hydrogel scaffolds embedded with a 2-pair FRET/NSET (Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer/NanoSurface Energy Transfer) gold nanobeacons (also known as dark-gold nanobeacons) {{we are able}} to overcome drug resistance by detecting and silencing a multidrug resistance protein (MRP1), before chemotherapeutic drug delivery in vivo. Our platform contains hydrogel embedded with dark-gold nanoparticles modified with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-intercalated nanobeacons that serve as an ON/OFF molecular nanoswitch triggered by the increased MRP1 expression within the <b>tumour</b> <b>tissue</b> microenvironment. This nanoswitch can sense and overcome multidrug resistance (MDR) prior to local drug release. These nanoprobes comprise a thiol-DNA-hairpin labelled with a NIR dye and a thiol-DNA oligo labelled with a dark quencher (BHQ2), polyethylene glycol (PEG), and intercalated drug- all of which are conjugated to a gold nanoparticle core. These dark-gold nanobeacons are then loaded with 5-FU that intercalates in the beacon stem (dsDNA part) of the DNA-hairpin oligo. Under hairpin configuration, the proximity of the NIR dye to the dark quencher leads to fluorescence quenching. Hybridization of the DNA hairpin to a complementary mRNA target restores fluorescence emission due to the gold nanobeacons' conformational reorganization that causes the fluorophore and the quencher to part from each other, yielding a quantitative response. On the other hand, the release of the 5-FU drug can only occur when DNA hairpin hybridizes with the complementary target and can be measured once the distance from the 5-FU and the gold core increases, escalating the drug emission.To evaluate the efficiency of the dark-gold nanobeacon probes in sensing and in overcoming MDR in vivo, an orthotopic breast cancer mouse model was developed by injecting 5-FU resistant MDAMB-231 cells to the mammary fat pad of female SCID hairless congenic mice. Efficacious and local delivery of the dark-gold nanobeacon probes is achieved by the implantation of a hydrogel disk on top of the triple-negative breast tumours using a polyamidoamine (PAMAM G5) dendrimer cross-linked with dextran aldehyde, which provides enhanced stability of the embedded nanoparticles. Despite the cross-resistance to 5-FU, more than 90% tumour reduction is achieved in vivo, following 80% MRP1 silencing compared with the continuous tumour growth following only drug or nonsense nanobeacon administration.|$|E

Using cDNA array, we analysed the expression profiles of 550 cancer-related genes in 36 colorectal adenomas (18 flat-type and 18 protruded-type adenomas) and 14 early invasive carcinomas. Among the 550 genes, we chose 32 genes the average expression levels of which were at least three-fold up- or downregulated in <b>tumour</b> <b>tissues</b> compared with levels in matched normal tissues. A total of 13 and 19 genes were identified as up- and downregulated genes in <b>tumour</b> <b>tissues,</b> respectively.
