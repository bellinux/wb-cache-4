5|$|As {{early as}} the 1909 Bogue plan, this part of Lower Queen Anne had been {{considered}} for a civic center. The Civic Auditorium (later the Opera House, now McCaw Hall), the ice arena (later Mercer Arena), and the Civic Field (rebuilt in 1946 as the High School Memorial Stadium), all built in 1927 had been placed there based on <b>that</b> <b>plan,</b> as was an armory (the Food Circus during the fair, later Center House).|$|E
5|$|Like {{another ten}} {{cities in the}} world, this London was named after the English capital of London by John Graves Simcoe, who also named the local river the Thames, in 1793. That was {{understandable}} since John Graves Simcoe {{and many of the}} original settlers were from Britain. Simcoe had intended London to be the capital of Upper Canada. Guy Carleton (Governor Dorchester) rejected <b>that</b> <b>plan</b> after the War of 1812, but accepted Simcoe's second choice, the present site of Toronto.|$|E

5|$|Despite the Interior Department's {{rejection}} of the overall Rampart Dam project, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers continued its engineering feasibility study on the project. <b>That</b> <b>plan</b> was completed on June 25, 1971, and it included most of the previous federal documents pertaining to the project, including the electricity market studies published by the Department of the Interior in 1965, the Fish and Wildlife study of 1964, and other studies about the economic feasibility of the project. A detailed description of potential construction methods and the overall plan for the project were included, as were reports about the site's geography and hydrology. In total, the report encompassed two volumes including more than 480 pages. Because the construction season at the site is only five months, the Corps of Engineers projected that several decades {{would be needed to}} build the dam and associated structures.|$|E
5|$|Even {{after the}} station opened in 1928, efforts {{to extend the}} line past Flushing persisted. In 1928, the New York City Board of Transportation (BOT) {{proposed}} allowing IRT trains to build a connection to use the Port Washington branch, but the IRT did not accept the offer since this would entail upgrading railroad crossings and the single-tracked line. Subsequently, the LIRR abandoned the branch in 1932. As part of the 1929 IND Second System plan, the Flushing Line would have had branches to College Point and Bayside east of Main Street. <b>That</b> <b>plan</b> was revived in 1939. The BOT kept proposing {{an extension of the}} Flushing Line past Main Street until 1945, when World War II ended and new budgets did not allow for a Flushing extension. Since then, several New York City Transit Authority proposals for an eastward extension have all failed.|$|E

5|$|From {{the area}} of Daugavpils she entered Lithuania, where in April 1831 her unit is rumored to have seized the town of Zarasai, {{although}} the historians are not sure this event really occurred. She planned to take Daugavpils, but after a reconnaissance mission discovered {{that the city was}} defended by a strong garrison and was impregnable to attack by such a small force as her own unit, <b>that</b> <b>plan</b> was abandoned. She then returned to Samogitia and headed for Panevėžys, where on 30 April she joined forces with the unit commanded by Karol Załuski. On May 4, she fought at the battle of Prastavoniai; shortly afterwards, with Konstanty Parczewski, she fought at Maišiagala. On 5 May, she witnessed General Dezydery Chłapowski entering the area with a large force and taking command over all units fighting in the former Grand Duchy.|$|E

During Kratos' second quest, Gyges {{revealed}} that he had planned to use the Ambrosia to revive his brothers, Briareus and Cottus, and then reclaim the world, but Kratos' initial retrieval thwarted <b>that</b> <b>plan.</b> Kratos destroyed both Gyges and the Tree of Life — which contained the Ambrosia — with the Fire of Apollo.|$|E
5|$|Hines led sixty {{men from}} Toronto, Ontario, on August 25, 1864. They arrived during the Democratic Party National Convention held in Chicago that year. The Copperheads had told Hines {{to wait until}} that time, as they said that 50,000 Copperheads would {{be there for the}} event. However, encountering Copperhead {{hesitation}} to assist Hines and his force, and with Federal authorities apparently knowledgeable of the plot, Hines and his men were forced to flee Chicago on August 30, 1864. Many of the men thought Anderson may have been a double agent, forcing him to leave the group. A second attempt to free the Camp Douglas Confederate prisoners occurred during the United States Presidential Election of 1864, but <b>that</b> <b>plan</b> was also foiled.|$|E

5|$|In 1963, Hogg {{purchased}} property near Round Top, {{hoping to}} move its historic building to Bayou Bend. When <b>that</b> <b>plan</b> proved impractical, she decided to restore it in place and temporarily moved to Round Top. After personally supervising {{the restoration of the}} Winedale Inn, a stagecoach inn near Round Top, Hogg donated the property to the University of Texas at Austin. Known as the Winedale Historical Center, it is used primarily as an outdoor museum and music center, and annually hosts Shakespeare at Winedale. In 1969, she restored her parents' house in Quitman; the town renamed it the Ima Hogg Museum in her honor. The museum holds items from the history of Wood County and northeast Texas. She later restored the home of her maternal grandfather and had it moved to the park.|$|E
5|$|John Bradstreet, who {{had been}} {{captured}} at Canso and held prisoner at Louisbourg, returned to New England in a prisoner exchange, and gave a detailed report to Shirley that emphasised the weaknesses of the French fort. William Vaughn, who owned several businesses in Maine that were vulnerable to raids from New France, toured New England advocating an expedition to capture Louisbourg. Shirley and other leaders in New England and New York sent letters to colonial authorities in London seeking support for such an expedition, citing the vulnerable conditions at Louisbourg. Vaughn and Bradstreet wanted to attack Louisbourg that winter with an all-colonial force. Shirley doubted the practicality of <b>that</b> <b>plan,</b> but in January 1745 submitted it to the provincial assembly (General Court), which declined to support the plan, but did request that Britain undertake an attack on Louisbourg.|$|E
5|$|John Kadlec, a {{consulting}} engineer {{on the original}} construction, has testified that he raised concerns at the time about sloppy workmanship and inadequate construction materials at the site, including structural columns that were already crooked, steel beams that were already rusting despite being new, and the ultimately fateful decision to place the complex's parking area on the roof. According to Kadlec, the construction company opted to resolve the structural issues not by redoing the construction, but by anchoring the building's back wall to the rock outcropping behind it. James Keywan, the building's original architect, testified that he also strongly objected to the rooftop parking, but had little choice once Algocen made their decision to proceed with <b>that</b> <b>plan.</b>|$|E

5|$|President Steyn {{played a}} minor role in Operation Savannah, the South African covert {{intervention}} in the Angolan Civil War, most notably when she rescued 26 advisors to the National Liberation Front of Angola who had been cut off after a failed attack on Luanda on 28 November. To provide manpower for the French corvettes under construction, the ship was placed in reserve in early 1977. The United Nations arms embargo imposed later that year put paid to <b>that</b> <b>plan</b> and she was recommissioned the following year. Shortly before President Kruger was recommissioned on 15 August 1980, President Steyn was permanently decommissioned on 1 August, after the navy decided to only keep two of the sisters active.|$|E
5|$|Romance is {{the eighth}} studio album by Mexican singer Luis Miguel. It was {{released}} by WEA Latina on 19 November 1991. Although the production was originally intended as another collaboration with Juan Carlos Calderón, <b>that</b> <b>plan</b> was scrapped when Calderón was unable to compose songs for the album. Facing a new-material deadline in his recording contract, at his manager's suggestion Miguel chose bolero music for his next project. Mexican singer-songwriter Armando Manzanero was hired by WEA Latina to co-produce the album with Miguel. Recording began in August 1991 at Ocean Way Recording in Hollywood, California, with Bebu Silvetti the arranger.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} recommissioned as the {{flagship}} of the China Squadron on 1 December 1881 {{under the command}} of Rear Admiral Meyer. She was relieved by her sister La Galissonnière in April 1884. She became flagship of the Levant Squadron after she arrived in France, but was in bad shape and soon placed in reserve at Cherbourg. Victorieuse became the flagship of Rear Admiral Barrera, second-in-command of the Northern Squadron on 10 February 1892. The ship was on summer maneuvers off the Iberian coast in July 1893. Two years later she became the flagship of Rear Admiral Ménard. She was initially condemned in May 1897, but this was reversed so she could convoy torpedo boats to Bizerte. <b>That</b> <b>plan</b> was later cancelled and Victorieuse was paid off in 1899, becoming guardship of the outer harbor at Brest until finally condemned the following year.|$|E
