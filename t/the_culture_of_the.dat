It is practised in religious ceremonies in Hindu temples in Bali, but is now banned in many countries on grounds of cruelty.|$|E
50|$|By the Iron Age, {{starting}} in the 7th century BC, the Iberian Peninsula consisted of complex agrarian and urban civilizations, either Pre-Celtic or Celtic (such as the Lusitanians, Celtiberians, Gallaeci, Astures, Celtici and others), <b>the</b> <b>cultures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Iberians in the eastern and southern zones and <b>the</b> <b>cultures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Aquitanian in <b>the</b> western portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pyrenees.|$|R

5|$|The Crusaders' mentality {{to imitate}} the customs from their Western European homelands meant that {{there were very few}} {{innovations}} developed from <b>the</b> <b>culture</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crusader states. Three notable exceptions to this rule are the military orders, warfare and fortifications. The Hospitallers (Order of Knights of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem) were founded in Jerusalem before the First Crusade but added a martial element to its ongoing medical functions to become a much larger military order. In this way the knighthood entered the previously monastic and ecclestical sphere.|$|E
5|$|The Word for World is Forest also {{challenges}} {{the idea of}} colonialism; the Terran colonists are depicted as being blind to <b>the</b> <b>culture</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Athsheans, and convinced that they represent a higher form of civilization.

5|$|The authors {{discuss the}} broader concept of denial using social science theory, noting its {{occurrence}} appears in society when individuals are frightened or ashamed of their actions. They write that these motivations, when expanded {{from an individual}} to wider society, present themselves {{as a form of}} disease. The book identifies climate change denial itself as a pathology afflicting <b>the</b> <b>culture</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> planet. The authors lament that an inverse relationship exists between an increasing scientific consensus regarding climate change, and a simultaneous increase in denial within the greater public about the same issue.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>culture</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> islands {{has been}} {{affected}} by the successive influences of Celtic, Norse and English speaking peoples and this is reflected in names given to the islands. Most of the Hebrides have names with Scots Gaelic derivations, whilst those of the Northern Isles tend to be derived from the Viking names. A few have Brythonic, Scots and even perhaps pre-Celtic roots.|$|E

50|$|Chibados (or quimbandas) are third-gender men {{who lived}} most often as women. They were found among <b>the</b> <b>cultures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ndongo {{and other parts}} of what is today Angola. They were first {{described}} in the west by the Portuguese.|$|R
5|$|The {{end of the}} war {{drastically}} reduced military investment in the island. Increasing enforcement of gambling laws and the growth of Las Vegas, Nevada as a competitive center of gambling and entertainment put pressure on the gaming industry on the island. Finally in 1957, Texas Attorney General Will Wilson and the Texas Rangers began a massive campaign of raids which disrupted gambling and prostitution in the city. As these vice industries crashed, so did tourism, taking the rest of the Galveston economy with it. Neither the economy nor <b>the</b> <b>culture</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city was the same afterward.|$|E
5|$|There is {{debate about}} the extent to which the Renaissance {{improved}} on <b>the</b> <b>culture</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Middle Ages.

50|$|Despite some {{similarities}} in <b>the</b> <b>cultures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Eskimo peoples, their cultural diversity {{makes it hard}} to generalise how Eskimos and Inuit used masks.

5|$|With {{remnants}} of the Holocaust and artifacts relevant to Judaism in Oklahoma, the Sherwin Miller Museum of Jewish Art preserves the largest collection of Judaica in the Southwestern and South-Central United States. Other museums, such as the Tulsa Historical Society, the Tulsa Air and Space Museum & Planetarium, the Oklahoma Jazz Hall of Fame, and the Tulsa Geosciences Center, document histories of the region, while the Greenwood Cultural Center preserves <b>the</b> <b>culture</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city's African American heritage, housing a collection of artifacts and photography that document {{the history of the}} Black Wall Street prior to the Tulsa Race Riot of 1921.|$|E
5|$|With urbanisation, {{distinctive}} urban accents {{have arisen}} which often differ greatly from the historical accents {{of the surrounding}} rural areas and sometimes share features with Southern English accents. Northern English dialects remain {{an important part of}} <b>the</b> <b>culture</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> region, and the desire of speakers to assert their local identity has led to accents such as Scouse and Geordie becoming more distinctive and spreading into surrounding areas.|$|E
5|$|As {{the vice}} {{industries}} crashed, so did tourism, {{and the rest}} of the Galveston economy declined with it. The economy stagnated during the 1950s, and after 1957 the Free State was effectively gone. Fort Crockett, which had been used as an Army recreation center following the war, was shut down in 1955. Many of the island's most important entertainment business leaders left the city and set up shop in Las Vegas. Neither the economy nor <b>the</b> <b>culture</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city were the same afterward. Civic leaders made several failed attempts at new ventures, including the Oleander Bowl football tournament (1948) and the Pelican Island bridge (1956) for access to a new industrial park, which never materialized. The city's television station, KGUL, moved to Houston in 1959; the telephone company headquarters and many other businesses relocated off the island as well. To make matters worse, some of the island's attractions were destroyed by Hurricane Carla in 1961 and never rebuilt.|$|E
40|$|Cyanoacrylate {{has been}} used in {{medicine}} and dentistry for many years. It {{has been used}} as a postextraction dressing and retrograde filling material in endodontic surgery. <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> this study was to evaluate <b>the</b> cytotoxic effects <b>of</b> Histoacryl and other two homologue ethyl cyanoacrylates, Super Bonder and Ultrabond, on cultured fibroblasts, using the Trypan blue dye exclusion assay. The cyanoacrylates were applied to round glass coverslips, which were placed in contact with NIH 3 T 3 cells. After 0, 6, 12 and 24 h (short-term assay; viability) and 1, 3, 5 and 7 days (long-term assay; survival), the cells were examined under phase light microscopy and counted. The data were compared by the Kruskal-Wallis test. In the short-term experiments, only <b>the</b> <b>cultures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ultrabond group (GIV) presented significant smaller percentages <b>of</b> cell viability than <b>the</b> <b>cultures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other groups (GI: control; GII: Super Bonder; GIII: Histoacryl). Although <b>the</b> <b>cultures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Super Bonder group (GII) presented smaller percentages of cell viability than <b>cultures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other groups (GI, GIII, GIV) at the long-term assay, this group was the only experimental group presenting a continuous and progressive cell growth. Our results have shown an in vitro biocompatibility of Histoacryl and ethyl cyanoacrylate homologues. These cyanoacrylates could therefore be of importance for endodontic purposes...|$|R
25|$|The most {{prominent}} feature <b>of</b> Crux is <b>the</b> distinctive asterism {{known as the}} Southern Cross.
