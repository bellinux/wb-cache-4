5|$|Ebsary {{made her}} senior debut for South Australia in the Women's National Cricket League (WNCL) during the 2000–01 {{season at the}} age of 18.

Ebsary was selected in every match in her first three seasons, but in that time, scored only 136 runs at a batting average of 8.50 and took 13 wickets from 24 matches. The following year, Ebsary raised her career average above 10 for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> was selected in the Australian Under-23 team. In 2004–05 she made more than 100 runs in a season for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> the following year she made 149 runs at 29.80.
