40|$|Abstract Background Animal {{trypanosomosis}} in sub-Saharan Africa is a {{major obstacle}} to livestock based agriculture. Control relies on drugs with increasing incidence of multiple-drug resistance. A previous mapping experiment in an F 2 population derived from the indigenous trypanotolerant N’Dama cattle crossed to susceptible (Kenya) -Boran cattle under controlled challenge, uncovered a number of <b>trypanotolerance</b> QTL (T-QTL). The {{present study was to}} determine expression of N’Dama <b>trypanotolerance</b> in a backcross to the Boran under conditions of field challenge, and whether chromosomal regions associated with <b>trypanotolerance</b> in the F 2 experiment showed similar effects in the BC population. Methods 192 backcross animals to the Boran were produced in six batches from June 2001 to December 2006. At one year of age animals were moved to the field and exposed to natural challenge over about one year in Southwest Kenya (Narok). The animals were individually recorded weekly for body weight, packed cell volume, parasitaemia score, and drug treatments, and were genotyped using 35 microsatellite markers spanning 5 chromosomes found in the F 2 study to harbour T-QTL. Results The F 1 were most trypanotolerant, Boran least, and BC intermediate. Females showed distinctly higher <b>trypanotolerance</b> than males. There was a positive correlation in the BC population between <b>trypanotolerance</b> and number of N’Dama origin marker alleles. QTL mapping revealed T-QTL distributed among all five targeted chromosomes, corresponding in part to the results obtained in the F 2 experiment. Conclusions N’Dama origin <b>trypanotolerance</b> is expressed in a BC population under field conditions in proportion to N’Dama origin marker alleles. Consequently, marker assisted selection in such populations may be a means of increasing <b>trypanotolerance,</b> while retaining the desirable productive qualities of the recurrent parent. </p...|$|E

40|$|Trypanosomosis {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{constraints}} on animal production in areas of Africa which have the greatest potential for significant increases in domestic livestock populations and livestock productivity. While the eradication of trypanosomosis from the entire continent is an unrealistic goal, considerable effort has been invested in the control of this disease through the use of trypanocidal drugs, management of the vector and exploitation of the genetic resistance exhibited by indigenous breeds. There is little hope that a conventional, anti-infection vaccine will be produced in the near future. Drug resistance is developing faster than generally thought. The control of the tsetse fly has been attempted over many decades. The decreasing efficacy of available trypanocidal drugs and the difficulties of sustaining tsetse control increase the imperative need to enhance <b>trypanotolerance</b> through selective breeding, either within breeds or through cross-breeding. <b>Trypanotolerance</b> has been defined as the relative capacity of an animal to control the development of the parasites and to limit their pathological effects, the most prominent of which is anaemia. A major constraint on selection for <b>trypanotolerance</b> in cattle, for both within-breed and cross-breeding programmes, has been the absence of practical reliable markers of resistance or susceptibility. Distinct humoral immune response to trypanosome infection is the major feature of bovine <b>trypanotolerance.</b> The role that these responses play in the control of infection or disease is being addressed by ongoing research, but remains a matter of speculation at present. Results in recent years have shown that packed cell volume (PCV) in particular and parasitaemia, the two principal indicators of <b>trypanotolerance,</b> are strongly correlated to animal performance. However, although direct effects of trypanosome infections of PCV and growth are obvious, more sensitive diagnostic methods for reflecting parasite control are required so that individual animals can be categorised reliably for their parasite control capability. One key finding is the major contribution made by each of the indicators evaluated to the overall <b>trypanotolerance</b> variance. Preliminary genetic parameters for PCV provide evidence that <b>trypanotolerance</b> is not only a breed characteristic but is also a heritable trait within the N'Dama population; this brings new opportunities for improved productivity through selection for <b>trypanotolerance.</b> More reliable estimation of genetic parameters of the indicators may well show that these parameters must be handled simulateneously for optimal progress. This would require diagnostics for assessing parasite control capability that identify trypanosome species more accurately, especially in mixed infections. A major advantage of trypanotolerant livestock, particularly N'Dama cattle, is the resistance or adaptation of this breed to many of the important pathogens which prevail in the sub-humid and humid tropics. Research on practical indicators of resistance to these conditions will be required to establish relevant integrated strategies based on disease-resistant livestock. Selective breeding will require the integration of the traits that farmers hold important for their production systems...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Trypanosomosis, a protozoal disease {{affecting}} livestock, {{transmitted by}} Glossina (tsetse) flies {{is a major}} constraint to agricultural production in Sub-Saharan Africa. It is accepted that utilization of the native <b>trypanotolerance</b> exhibited {{in some of the}} African cattle breeds to improve <b>trypanotolerance</b> of more productive but susceptible breeds, will offer a cost effective and sustainable solution to the problem. The success of this approach is {{based on the premise that}} quantitative trait loci previously identified under relatively controlled situations confer useful <b>trypanotolerance</b> under natural field situations. As part of a study to authenticate this hypothesis, a population of 192 cattle, consisting of six batches of N’Dama and Kenya-Boran backcross animals [(N’Dama x Kenya-Boran) x Kenya-Boran] born over the period 2002 to 2006 was constructed. Some of the batches also included pure Kenya-Boran cattle, or N’Dama x Kenya- Boran F 1 animals. Each batch was exposed as yearlings to natural field trypanosomosis challenge over a period of about one year; the entire challenge period extending from December 2003 to June 2007. Performance of the animals was evaluated by weekly or biweekly measurements of body weight, packed blood cell volume (PCV), parasitemia score, and number of trypanocide treatments. From these basic data, 49 phenotypes were constructed reflecting dynamics of body weight, packed cell volume (PCV) and parasitemia under challenge.

The {{first part of the}} study investigated livestock keeper knowledge about trypanosomosis and <b>trypanotolerance.</b> For each breed 60 livestock keepers were interviewed, resulting in a total of 240 interviews. The second part of the study focused on biological evidence for <b>trypanotolerance.</b> Blood samples of about 100 head of cattle per breed were collected during peak trypanosomosis challenge period and analyzed for packed cell volume (PCV) and parasitaemia. In addition individual body measurements of the sampled animals were taken and the keepers provided some information regarding their animals. Livestock keeper interviews revealed that trypanosomosis was considered a major problem in all areas (95 – 100 %). Almost all Abigar livestock keepers knew how trypanosomosis is transmitted, whereas only 34 – 52 % of the keepers of the other breeds had that knowledge. Most Sheko keepers (75 %) knew of <b>trypanotolerance</b> and claimed to have trypanotolerant animals in their own herds. Among the other three breeds the knowledge of <b>trypanotolerance</b> was much less (8 – 18 %). A majority of the keepers were interested in purchasing trypanotolerant animals. PCV was highest among Horro (26. 2) and Sheko (25. 1) cattle whereas Abigar had the lowest PCV (20. 0). Sheko were least infected by trypanosomes (6 %) and had the lowest number of trypanocidal treatments per year (1 treatment/animal and year). Abigar cattle were most infected (23 %) followed by Gurage (20 %) and Horro (17 %). Gurage had by far the highest number of treatments per animal and year (24). There were large differences between the number of cattle perceived by the keepers to be infected, and the number detected from blood sampled, among Abigar, Gurage and Horro. Sheko livestock keepers were better at correctly diagnosing trypanosomosis in their animals. It is concluded that Sheko cattle have higher <b>trypanotolerance</b> attributes of the breeds investigated and a better use of this breed could improve cattle health and household welfare in tsetse-infested areas...|$|E

We evaluated the role of the haemopoietic system in <b>trypanotolerance</b> by comparing the performance of five Chimaeric Boran/N'Dama twin calves with that of singletons of the two breeds. Chimaeric Boran/N'Dama pairs of twins were produced in recipient Boran cows by embryo transfer, and the majority of haemopoietic cells in all twinned individuals were of Boran origin. Thus, N'Dama chimaeras differed from N'Dama singletons in that the bulk of their haemopoietic system was derived from their susceptible Boran twins, while Boran chimaeras differed little from Boran control animals. All cattle became parasitaemic and developed anaemia. The N'Dama chimaeras did not manage their anaemia and white blood cell counts effectively. However, they were able to limit parasitaemia development. These results suggest that <b>trypanotolerance</b> is the result of two mechanisms, one that improves parasite control and is independent of the genetic origin of the haemopoietic tissue, and another that is influenced by haemopoietic tissue genotype and which improves control over anaemia.

A number of trypanotolerant cattle breeds are found in West Africa, and identification of the genes conferring <b>trypanotolerance</b> could lead to effective means of genetic selection for <b>trypanotolerance.</b> In this context, high resolution mapping in mouse models are a promising approach to identifying the genes associated with <b>trypanotolerance.</b> In previous studies, using F 2 C 57 BL/ 6 J × A/J and C 57 BL/ 6 J × BALB/cJ mouse resource populations, <b>trypanotolerance</b> QTL were mapped within a large genomic intervals of 20 - 40 cM to chromosomes MMU 17, 5 and 1, and denoted Tir 1, Tir 2 and Tir 3 respectively. Subsequently, using F 6 C 57 BL/ 6 J × A/J and C 57 BL/ 6 J × BALB/cJ F 6 advanced intercross lines (AIL), Tir 1 was fine mapped to a confidence interval (CI) of less than 1 cM, while Tir 2 and Tir 3, were mapped within 5 - 12 cM. Tir 1 represents the major <b>trypanotolerance</b> QTL. Results In order to improve map resolutions of Tir 2 and Tir 3, an F 12 C 57 BL/ 6 J × A/J AIL population fixed for the susceptible alleles at Tir 1 QTL was generated. An F 12 C 57 BL/ 6 J × A/J AIL population, fixed for the resistant alleles at Tir 1 QTL was also generated to provide an additional estimate of the gene effect of Tir 1. The AIL populations homozygous for the resistant and susceptible Tir 1 alleles and the parental controls were challenged with T. congolense and followed for survival times over 180 days. Mice from the two survival extremes of the F 12 AIL population fixed for the susceptible alleles at Tir 1 were genotyped with a dense panel of microsatellite markers spanning the Tir 2 and Tir 3 genomic regions and QTL mapping was performed. Tir 2 was fine mapped to less than 1 cM CI while Tir 3 was mapped to three intervals named Tir 3 a, Tir 3 b and Tir 3 c with 95 % confidence intervals (CI) of 6, 7. 2 and 2. 2 cM, respectively. Conclusions The mapped QTL regions encompass genes that are vital to innate immune response and can be potential candidate genes for the underlying QTL. </p...|$|E
