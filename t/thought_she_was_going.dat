5|$|After the shooting, Saldívar {{entered her}} red 1994 GMC pickup truck {{and tried to}} leave the motel parking lot. Motel {{employee}} Rosario Garza saw Saldívar leave her room with a wrapped towel. It was later <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to Q-Productions to shoot Quintanilla, Jr. and others who were waiting for Selena. However, she was spotted by a responding police officer in a vehicle. The officer left his vehicle, drew his gun, and ordered Saldívar out of the truck. Saldívar did not comply; she backed up and parked adjacent to two cars. Her truck was then blocked in by the police vehicle. Saldívar picked up the pistol, pointed it at her right temple, and threatened to commit suicide. A SWAT team and the FBI Crisis Negotiation Unit were brought in. Musicologist Himilce Novas later said the event was reminiscent of O.J. Simpson's planned suicide 10 months earlier.|$|E
25|$|Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman John Kerry {{stated that}} he {{expected}} Clinton to face some tough questions, but <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> {{to do a good}} job at (being Secretary of State). Christopher Hitchens of Vanity Fair called her nomination a ludicrous embarrassment on the edition of November 18, 2008 of Hardball due to the Clintons' overseas connections, her actions during the 2008 Democratic Presidential Primary. Senator John Cornyn (R-Texas) voted against a unanimous voice approval, citing ethical concerns. He sought not to block the nomination through a filibuster, but to voice his opposition to her policies. Senator David Vitter (R-Louisiana) also voted against Clinton in Committee citing her husband's foreign donations for his non-profit entities.|$|E
500|$|Garrett's Miss Pawhuska's jockey at the time, C. W. Cascio, said of {{her when}} he raced her at Del Rio, Texas, [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> {{to have to go}} all out just to keep up with those big two-year-olds—what with her little enough to run under their bellies." [...] Her last race was at Enid, Oklahoma, and it was a match race against Bob K K, which she won.|$|E
60|$|At first I <b>thought</b> that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> {{to ignore}} me entirely, but finally <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> better of it.|$|R
6000|$|... "She didn't say nothing. I didn't stop. I {{just said}} what he said I was to and then I beat it. I <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> might <b>be</b> <b>going</b> to start weepin'." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> hesitated; I <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> perhaps <b>going</b> to {{say that}} we had been very base. But she remarked after a moment, in a candid, {{wondering}} way, [...] "How much you must want them!" ...|$|R
500|$|In an unaired {{pilot for}} 30 Rock, Rachel Dratch, a former SNL cast member, {{originally}} {{played the role}} of Jenna DeCarlo. In August 2006, executive producer Lorne Michaels announced that Dratch would be replaced as Jenna but would portray different roles in other episodes. [...] In the re-tooled pilot, Dratch appears as The Girlie Shows cat wrangler. Later in the month, NBC announced that Jane Krakowski had replaced Dratch in the role of Jenna, and that the character was renamed Jenna Maroney. Michaels said that [...] "everyone is thrilled that she is joining the cast", and <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to be a [...] "perfect fit".|$|E
2500|$|Benson's {{band had}} a high {{turnover}} of musicians, as they frequently left to marry G.I.s they met while touring. She once commented, [...] "I lost seven in one year to America. Only the other week a girl slipped away from the stage. I <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to the lavatory but she went off with a G.I. Nobody's seen her since." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bankhead was {{director}} Irving Rapper's first {{choice for the}} role of Amanda in the film version of Tennessee William's The Glass Menagerie. Laurette Taylor, who originated the role of Amanda, was an idol of Bankhead's and also an alcoholic, whose brilliant performance in the original Broadway production reversed years of career decline. Rapper called Bankhead's screen test the greatest performance he had ever seen: [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to be difficult, but she was like a child, so sweet and lovely. I was absolutely floored by her performance. It's the greatest test I've ever made or seen in my life. I couldn't believe I was seeing such reality. Bankhead was absolutely natural, so moving, so touching without even trying. The crew was stunned, too." [...] But studio head Jack Warner rejected the idea because of his fear of Tallulah's drinking; though she promised not to drink during shooting, he refused to give her the part. The role was given to Gertrude Lawrence instead, whose acting was panned by most critics.|$|E
60|$|They strolled away, {{among the}} lanes {{beginning}} to be indistinct in the twilight - she leaning on his arm - and <b>she</b> little <b>thought</b> how <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> down, down, down, Mrs. Sparsit's staircase.|$|R
50|$|Comfort Grody - Jabez's close {{childhood}} friend who <b>thought</b> that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to marry Jabez, {{based on what}} Jabez said to her before he left to calm down following Victoria's disappearance. Comfort is British.|$|R
50|$|While Andrew Curtin was {{carrying}} Catherine E. Davidson, she gave Curtin her ring. Catherine E. Davidson {{gave him the}} ring because <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to die and wanted to thank Andrew Curtin for carrying her to the ambulance.|$|R
2500|$|During the episode, Ziva tells {{a witness}} {{that she and}} Tony shared a hotel room, and that she took the couch so she wouldn't have to hear Tony whine about his back. Tony in turn tells McGee that he took the couch. Ziva asks him why he lied and he returns the question. There was much {{speculation}} {{on the part of}} fans about whether the characters might have shared more than was divulged, but Weatherly said in response, [...] "The truth of what happened is probably something that can be discovered inside the episode itself. If you really listen to what they say, I think it is pretty clear what happened: Nothing." [...] He clarified that Tony and Ziva had [...] "a tremendous amount of fun" [...] in Paris and that, [...] "Ziva had more fun with Tony than she <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to have, which maybe shocked her a little bit, because she was so angry at him after he killed her boyfriend last year." [...] Cote de Pablo added, [...] "Michael has his views of what happened in Paris. I have mine. We haven't discussed it. But all I can say is it was good." [...] Shortly afterwards, Glenn Diaz from BuddyTV reported that the cast was divided on whether or not the characters should be allowed to progress beyond [...] "unfulfilled sexual tension".|$|E
2500|$|She {{rang the}} wall-crank phone two times before being shot {{twice in the}} face from the same window. One bullet entered her right cheek and exited behind her left ear. The other went in her lower jaw just below the lip, {{breaking}} it and splintering out several teeth before lodging under her tongue. She dropped to her knees but soon managed to get on her feet. She ran to get a pistol from the living room, but she was blinded by her own blood. She heard the killer tearing loose the rusted screen wire on the back porch. She <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to be killed, so she stumbled toward her bedroom {{near the front of}} the house to leave a note. Meanwhile, the killer ran to the back of the house and made his way up the steps and into the side-screened porch through the back screen door. She heard the killer coming through the kitchen window, so she turned around and ran through the dining room, through the bedroom, down a hallway, through another bedroom, and then into the living room and out the front door, leaving behind a [...] "virtual river of blood" [...] and teeth throughout the house and across the street. Barefooted and still in her blood-soaked nightgown, she ran across the street to her sister and brother-in-law's house. Since no one was home, she ran 50yards more to A. V. Prater's house. Prater answered her call for help. She gasped, [...] "Virgil's dead", then collapsed. Prater shot a rifle in the air to summon another neighbor, Elmer Taylor. Prater called to Taylor to bring his car because Mr. and Mrs. Starks had been shot. Taylor, along with Mr. and Mrs. Prater and their baby, rode with Mrs. Starks to Michael Meagher Hospital (now Miller County Health Unit) at 503 Walnut Street. Mrs. Starks gave Mr. Taylor, the driver, one of her teeth with a gold filling. She was in a semi-conscious state, slumping forward on the front seat. Although she lost a considerable amount of blood, she showed no signs of going into shock and her heart rate remained normal. Miller County Sheriff W. E. Davis, who became head of the investigation, questioned Mrs. Starks in the operating room at Michael Meagher Hospital. The news was printed on the front page the next morning, on Saturday May 4, reading [...] "MURDER ROCKS CITY AGAIN; FARMER SLAIN, WIFE WOUNDED". Four days later, Sheriff Davis talked with Mrs. Starks again at the hospital. Mrs. Starks discounted a rumor that was circulating about Virgil hearing a car outside his home several nights in a row, fearing of being killed.|$|E

6000|$|... "Well done, little 'un," [...] said Mr. Tulliver, laughing, while Tom felt rather {{disgusted with}} Maggie's knowingness, though beyond measure cheerful at the <b>thought</b> that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> {{to stay with}} him. Her conceit would soon be overawed by the actual {{inspection}} of his books.|$|R
60|$|With {{something}} of an effort, she banished her disturbing <b>thoughts.</b> <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to marry Jim. Perhaps she could mold him a little. Yet she did not know; {{she did not want}} to conventionalize him; there was something rather fine about his ruggedness. Then she began to wonder why she had asked him to tell nobody yet. Girls she knew had found an obvious satisfaction in exhibiting their lovers, but she had felt a need for concealment. This <b>was</b> not because <b>she</b> feared her mother's disapproval; it looked as if she had unconsciously tried to leave open a way of escape. By and by a car rolled up the drive and Mordaunt came in.|$|R
60|$|The crude {{realism of}} the picture, {{possibly}} harmless enough in its effect upon others, overpowered and sickened her. By a curious fascination {{she would look}} at it again and again, till every line of the engraver's performance seemed really a transcript from what had happened before his eyes. With such details fresh in her <b>thoughts</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> {{out of the door}} to make arrangements for confirming, by repetition, her marriage with another. No interval was available for serious reflection on the tragedy, or for allowing the softening effects of time to operate in her mind. It was as though her first husband had died that moment, and <b>she</b> <b>was</b> keeping an appointment with another in the presence of his corpse.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Mr. Robinson, don't {{you talk}} like that. You wouldn't {{take it all}} calm that way if you <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to have him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed, my lady?" [...] I <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> {{to tell me}} her dreams, but no, {{when she}} spoke next it was only to ask a question.|$|E
6000|$|... “My gracious, that’s {{the worst}} {{experience}} I {{ever had in}} my life!” panted Leo, as soon as he could speak. “I <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to chew me up!” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The Squire {{told me so}} himself," [...] he went on, {{keeping his}} eyes remorselessly fixed upon her face. She leaned forward and he <b>thought</b> that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to faint, but she did not. By a supreme effort she {{recovered}} herself and drank a glass of sherry which was standing by her side.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Am I heartless?' <b>she</b> <b>thought.</b> 'I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> {{to leave}} him--I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> into life; I {{shall have to}} fight now, there'll be no looking back.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh," [...] said Westover, and he {{felt that}} she had proudly wished to account for a quality which she hoped he had noticed in her cooking. He <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> might <b>be</b> <b>going</b> to tell him {{something}} more of herself, but she only said, [...] "Well, any {{time you want to}} show me your way of makin' coffee," [...] and went out of the room.|$|R

6000|$|... "The lady ducked {{her head}} under her mantilla, and {{drew in a}} long breath. I <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to scream, but with all that intake of air she only came out with: 'Me likee Americanos.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Daphne Wing's {{eyes and}} lips {{opened and closed}} again. And the awful thought went through Gyp: 'Poor thing! <b>She</b> <b>thought</b> it <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to <b>be</b> him, and it's only me!' Then the white lips said: ...|$|R
5000|$|Yuri is {{the more}} romantic of the two. She likes romantic dinners, moonlit walks, and very wealthy men. But for the most part, she usually finds men who care more about what their fathers think {{about what happens to}} their prized {{possessions}} than to her. One time, <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to get married. It turned out her prospective groom had found a new love, and she took her frustration out on her and Kei's next mission.|$|R
5000|$|During elimination, Real {{gave his}} first chain to Promo. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> scared {{to take it}} at first because <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> Chance <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to get really mad. Chance was disappointed, but didnt yell or get out of control.|$|R
6000|$|... "Maxwell? I {{thought the}} change might do him good; yes," [...] said Matt, with a cowardly joy in his {{escape from the}} worst he feared. He <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> {{to speak to him}} of Suzette.|$|E
60|$|For {{a moment}} I <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to smile. We were both {{thinking}} of Edwin. But {{it was only}} for a moment, and then her face grew cold once more, and the chin resumed its angle of determination.|$|E
6000|$|One {{time the}} {{trembling}} of this poor lip {{was so strong}} and her tears ran down so fast that I <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to tell me all her woe, so I takes her two hands in mine and I says: ...|$|E
