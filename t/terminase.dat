50|$|Several dsDNA bacteriophages and the herpesviruses encode a {{powerful}} ATP driven DNA translocating machine that encapsidates a viral genome into a preformed capsid shell or prohead. The critical {{components of the}} packaging machine are the packaging enzyme (<b>terminase)</b> which acts as the motor and the portal protein that forms the unique DNA entrance vertex of prohead. The <b>terminase</b> complex consists of a recognition subunit (small <b>terminase)</b> and an endonuclease/translocase subunit (large <b>terminase)</b> and cuts viral genome concatemers. It forms a motor complex containing five large <b>terminase</b> subunits. The terminase-viral DNA complex docks on the portal vertex. The pentameric motor processively translocates DNA until the head shell is full with one viral genome. The motor cuts the DNA again and dissociates from the full head, allowing head-finishing proteins to assemble on the portal, sealing the portal, and constructing a platform for tail attachment. Only a single gene encoding the putative ATPase subunit of the <b>terminase</b> (UL15) is conserved among all herpesviruses. To a lesser extent this gene {{is also found in}} T4-like bacteriophages suggesting a common ancestor for these two groups of viruses. Another paper has also suggested that herpesviruses originated among the bacteriophages.|$|E

The stimulation of ATPase activity of p 16, although induced under packaging conditions, is not dependent of the actual DNA packaging and in this respect the Φ 29 enzyme is similar to other viral <b>terminases.</b> Protein p 16 competes with DNA and RNA in the interaction with the viral prohead, which occurs through the N-terminal region of the connector protein (p 10). In fact, p 16 interacts in a nucleotide-dependent fashion with the viral Φ 29 -encoded RNA (pRNA) involved in DNA packaging, and this binding can be competed with DNA. Our results are consistent with a model for DNA translocation in which p 16, bound and organized around the connector, acts as a power stroke to pump the DNA into the prohead, using the hydrolysis of ATP as an energy source...|$|R

40|$|Metagenomic islands (MGIs) {{have been}} defined as genomic regions in prokaryotic genomes that under-recruit from metagenomes {{where most of the}} same genome {{recruits}} at close to 100 % identity over most of its length. The presence of MGIs in prokaryotes has been associated to the diversity of concurrent lineages that vary at this level to disperse the predatory pressure of phages that, reciprocally, maintain high clonal diversity in the population and improve ecosystem performance. This was proposed as a Constant-Diversity (C-D) model. Here we have investigated the regions of phage genomes under-recruiting in a metavirome constructed with a sample from the same habitat where they were retrieved. Some of the genes found to under-recruit are involved in host recognition as would be expected from the C-D model. Furthermore, the recruitment of intragenic regions known to be involved in molecular recognition also had a significant under-recruitment compared {{to the rest of the}} gene. However, other genes apparently disconnected from the recognition process under-recruited often, specifically the <b>terminases</b> involved in packaging of the phage genome in the capsid and a few others. In addition, some highly related phage genomes (at nucleotide sequence level) had no metaviromic islands (MVIs).

40|$|Complex {{double-stranded}} (ds) DNA viruses such as bacteriophages {{and certain}} animal viruses (e. g. adenoviruses and herpesviruses) exhibit a complex maturation process that involves various steps. A {{first step is}} the assembly of a viral prohead, which {{is followed by the}} packaging of the DNA genome. During the entire process of genome packaging and after this key step, the prohead under-goes several transitions that end up in a final mature virion. One shared feature in viral maturation is the connector, a homo-dodecameric protein that {{plays a key role in}} the first steps of the prohead assembly and in DNA packaging [1]. The connector is found in a unique vertex of the prohead and is associated with other viral components of the packaging machinery building the portal vertex. Viral ATPases, called <b>terminases,</b> form part of this portal complex and their activity is required for DNA translocation. Approximately one molecule of ATP is hydrolysed to package 2 bp of DNA. The complex machinery that translocates the DNA inside the viral prohead is quite effective, as it does so at a speed of around 100 bp per second, generating forces up to 57 pN [3].

40|$|The {{completed}} genome {{sequence of}} the temperate Streptomyces phage straight phiC 31 is reported. straight phiC 31 contains genes that are related by sequence similarities to several other dsDNA phages infecting many diverse bacterial hosts, including Escherichia, Arthrobacter, Mycobacterium, Rhodobacter, Staphylococcus, Bacillus, Streptococcus, Lactobacillus and Lactococcus. These observations provide further evidence that dsDNA phages from diverse bacterial hosts are related and have had access to a common genetic pool. Analysis of the late genes was particularly informative. The sequences of the head assembly proteins (portal, head protease and major capsid) were conserved between straight phiC 31, coliphage HK 97, staphylococcal phage straight phiPVL, two Rhodobacter capsulatus prophages and two Mycobacterium tuberculosis prophages. These phages and prophages (where non-defective) from evolutionarily diverse hosts are, therefore, likely to share a common head assembly mechanism i. e. that of HK 97. The organisation of the tail genes in straight phiC 31 is highly reminiscent of tail regions from other phage genomes. The unusual organisation of the putative lysis genes in straight phiC 31 is discussed, and speculations are made as to the roles of some inessential early gene products. Similarities between certain phage gene products and eukaryotic dsDNA virus proteins were noted, in particular, the primase/helicases and the <b>terminases</b> (large subunits).

To {{understand the nature}} of the packaging defect, the interaction of the cohesive end site (cos) specific for phage 21 (cos phi 21) with phage lambda <b>terminase</b> has been investigated. The ability of lambda <b>terminase</b> to cleave cos phi 21 was studied in vitro; lambda <b>terminase</b> cleaved cos phi 21 only 1 % as well as it cleaved the phage lambda cohesive end site (cos lambda). In vitro packaging experiments showed that the lambda and 21 packaging specificities observed in vivo are also found in vitro. The cos cleavage reaction was modified so that competition experiments could be performed; these experiments showed that cos phi 21 was unable to bind lambda <b>terminase,</b> thus identifying the nature of the defect. Previous work [Feiss, M., Fisher, R. A., Siegele, D. A., Nichols, B. P. & Donelson, J. E.

Therefore, <b>terminase</b> binding to cos requires interactions with base pairs to the Nu 1 side of the cohesive end symmetry segment. The evidence supports the proposition that cos consists of adjacent sites for binding of <b>terminase</b> and for nicking by <b>terminase.</b> Because cos phi 21 can be cut by lambda <b>terminase</b> to terminate DNA packaging, it is proposed that the <b>terminase</b> that binds and nicks at the initial cos site is brought into contact with the terminal cos site by the packaging process. <b>Terminase</b> recognizes and nicks the cohesive end sequence of the terminal cos without requiring the binding site...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2013 Packaging of viral genomes into procapsids by <b>terminase</b> enzymes is conserved in many DNA viruses. Terminases bind to linear concatemers of {{replicated}} viral genomes and concomitantly excise (mature) and package {{a single}} genome per procapsid. In this thesis, I interrogate {{the role of}} E. coli integration host factor (IHF) in mediating the site-specific assembly of bacteriophage lambda <b>terminase</b> at its cognate DNA site, cos, which serves as the packaging initiation site. IHF binds to an I-element within cos and introduces a strong bend in the duplex. It was previously demonstrated that the small <b>terminase</b> subunit could stabilize an IHF-induced bend at cos. I hypothesized that <b>terminase</b> holoenzyme and IHF cooperatively assemble at cos and wrap the duplex into a compact nucleoprotein complex. Rigorous analysis of this cooperative assembly is complex due to the multiple <b>terminase</b> and IHF binding elements within cos. Therefore, I dissected the cos site into individual specific and nonspecific IHF binding sequences, and analyzed the relevant protein affinities for these subsites {{as well as for}} (1) the full-length cos site and (2) a random nonspecific (NS) sequence of equivalent length. Analytical ultracentrifugation and electrophoretic mobility shift studies show that IHF and <b>terminase</b> only modestly discriminate between cos and NS-DNA substrates; however, the two proteins cooperatively bind to cos-DNA. The data suggest that IHF confers site-specificity of binding to <b>terminase.</b> Also evident is significant nonspecific DNA binding concurrent with specific interactions, even on specific DNA substrates. IHF likely facilitates the high-affinity cooperative assembly of a relevant nucleoprotein complex at the cos site despite significant nonspecific binding of both proteins to DNA, with the functional significance of nonspecific DNA binding being the enhancement of protein-DNA interactions. Furthermore, sedimentation equilibrium studies demonstrate that while <b>terminase</b> assembles in the absence of IHF as a dimer on a 274 bp DNA substrate inclusive of the entire cos site, in the presence of IHF a nucleoprotein complex of mass consistent with five <b>terminase</b> protomers and two IHF molecules results. This finding further implicates IHF in the cooperative assembly of a specific ternary IHF-DNA-terminase complex at the packaging initiation site of bacteriophage lambda. A <b>terminase</b> packaging enzyme that both (1) site-specifically matures DNA and (2) packages DNA in a sequence-independent manner must be capable of both specific and nonspecific DNA binding. This work furthers the understanding of (1) one of the factors (IHF) involved in the site-specific assembly of a nucleoprotein complex required for the initiation of viral packaging, and (2) the nature of the specific nucleoprotein complex assembled at the cos site prior to DNA maturation and packaging...|$|E

Recent evidence suggests that the phage DNA packaging motor is one of the strongest force-generating molecular motors reported to date.

In order to identify the DNA translocating ATPase, the sequences of the packaging/terminase genes of coliphages T 4 and RB 49 and vibriophages KVP 40 and KVP 20 have been analyzed.

In HSV, the <b>terminase</b> likely comprises the UL 15, UL 28, and UL 33 proteins (pUL 15, pUL 28, and pUL 33, respectively).

Crystal structures of the large <b>terminase</b> nuclease domain from Thermus thermophilus bacteriophage G 20 c exhibits the closest similarity with the RuvC endonucleases which belong to the RNase H-like superfamily. Biochemical and mutagenesis studies identified catalytically indispensable residues including D 294, D 429 and D 347 at the nuclease active site. Structures in complex with different metals reveal that only one catalytic metal ion is found at the active site {{in the absence of}} DNA. Binding of the second metal ion is likely to be facilitated by the observed conformational variability of loop L 1, which may bring the two catalytic aspartic acids D 347 and D 294 closer to each other.

In this paper we present {{evidence that the}} failure of these phage mutants to mature DNA {{is a reflection of}} a mechanism that modulates <b>terminase</b> nicking activity during normal phage development. We have constructed plasmids that contain the λ-cohesive end site (cos) and the genes that code for DNA <b>terminase,</b> the enzyme that matures DNA by cutting at cos. The DNA <b>terminase</b> genes are under control of a thermosensitive cI repressor. These plasmids lack most of the genes involved in prohead morphogenesis and other head precursors. However, when repression is lifted by destruction of the thermosensitive repressor, the <b>terminase</b> synthesized is able to cut almost 100 % of the plasmids.

The structure reveals a common scheme for oligomerization of <b>terminase</b> DNA-recognition components, and provides insights {{into the role of}} gp 1 in formation of the packaging-competent <b>terminase</b> complex and assembly of the <b>terminase</b> with the portal, in which ring-like protein oligomers stack together to form a continuous channel for viral DNA translocation...|$|E
40|$|Nu 1 and A, {{the genes}} coding for {{bacteriophage}} lambda DNA <b>terminase,</b> {{rank among the}} most poorly translated genes expressed in E. coli. To understand {{the reason for this}} low level of translation the genes were cloned into plasmids and their expression measured. In addition, the wild type DNA sequences immediately preceding the genes were reduced and modified. It was found that the elements that control translation are contained in the 100 base pairs upstream from the initiation codon. Interchanging these upstream sequences with those of an efficiently translated gene dramatically increased the translation of <b>terminase</b> subunits. It seems unlikely that the rare codons present in the genes, and any feature of their mRNA secondary structure {{play a role in the}} control of their translation. The elimination of cos from plasmids containing Nu 1 and A also resulted in an increase in <b>terminase</b> production. This result suggests a role for cos in the control of late gene expression. The <b>terminase</b> subunit overproducer strains are potentially very useful for the design of improved DNA packaging and cosmid mapping techniques...|$|E
40|$|Many {{double-stranded}} DNA (dsDNA) viruses utilize <b>terminase</b> enzymes, which package viral DNA into empty procapsids. Bacteriophage lambda (λ) catalyzes viral DNA packaging {{with the}} functional <b>terminase</b> holoenzyme, composed of subunits gpNu 1, which {{is involved in}} viral genome recognition, and gpA, which cleaves the concatemeric viral DNA into a single genome and then translocates the now mature viral genome into a procapsid. Using sequence alignment studies we mutated the N-terminal ATPase domain (D 178 E/E 179 D) and truncated the C terminus at residue 622 to stabilize the dynamic teriminase structure. The mutation impacted the fully assembled holoenzyme, increasing nuclease and helicase activity, while showing only minimal ATPase activity {{as compared to the}} wild type holoenzyme. DNA binding studies suggest that in the presence of viral DNA, the holoenzyme mutant is confined to a single conformation. Future crystallization studies with the holoenzyme mutant and the viral DNA may allow for structure solution of the DNA packaging complex. Here we present the biochemical characterization of the assembled <b>terminase</b> holoenzyme mutant and the individual gpA subunit of bacteriophage lambda <b>terminase...</b>|$|E
40|$|During DNA {{replication}} by the λ-like bacteriophages, immature concatemeric DNA {{is produced}} by rolling circle replication. The concatemers are processed into mature chromosomes with cohesive ends, and packaged into prohead shells, during virion assembly. Cohesive ends are generated by the viral enzyme <b>terminase,</b> which introduces staggered nicks at cos, an approx. 200 bp-long sequence containing subsites cosQ, cosN and cosB. Interactions of cos subsites of immature concatemeric DNA with <b>terminase</b> orchestrate DNA processing and packaging. To initiate DNA packaging, <b>terminase</b> interacts with cosB and nicks cosN. The cohesive ends of N 15 DNA {{differ from those of}} λ at 2 / 12 positions. Genetic experiments show that phages with chromosomes containing mismatched cohesive ends are functional. In at least some infections, the cohesive end mismatch persists through cyclization and replication, so that progeny phages of both allelic types are produced in the infected cell. N 15 possesses an asymmetric packaging specificity: N 15 DNA is not packaged by phages λ or 21, but surprisingly, N 15 -specific <b>terminase</b> packages λ DNA. Implications for genetic interactions among λ-like bacteriophages are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Members of the SaPI {{family of}} Staphylococcus aureus {{pathogenicity}} islands are highly mobile, superantigen-encoding genetic elements that depend upon specific helper bacteriophages for their horizontal transfer. Following helper phage infection, these elements excise, replicate, and package their genomes in virions {{provided by the}} helper phage. One of the novel features {{of this process is}} the use of a SaPI-encoded small subunit of <b>terminase,</b> which replaces the phage small <b>terminase</b> subunit and redirects <b>terminase</b> packaging specificity to SaPI DNA. The SaPI genome, like that of the helper phage, is packaged from concatemers by a headful packaging mechanism, resulting in encapsidated DNA molecules that exhibit terminal redundancy and partial circular permutation. In this study we have localized the site of initial cleavage in SaPI 1, a prototype member of this family, and have defined a small region of the SaPI 1 genome sufficient for specific packaging. The cleavage site was initially localized to an intergenic region upstream of SaPI 1 operon 1 by identification of submolar fragments in restricted SaPI 1 virion DNA. Ligation of linkers to the ends of SaPI virion DNA, followed by amplification and sequencing of the linker/SaPI 1 junction, further defined the sites of initial cleavage. A fragment encompassing this region was cloned into a plasmid vector co-expressing SaPI 1 small <b>terminase</b> and shown to confer high frequency plasmid transduction by helper phage 80 α. The critical determinants for SaPI 1 -specific packaging were further defined by deletion analysis of the cloned fragment. These results demonstrate that the sequence required for SaPI 1 -specific packaging maps to a small region upstream of the promoter for SaPI 1 operon 1. This is strikingly different from the pac site used by the helper phage <b>terminase,</b> which, like other phage pac sites, maps to within the small <b>terminase</b> gene itself...|$|E
40|$|The <b>terminase</b> enzyme of {{bacteriophage}} k is a hetero-oligomeric protein which catalyzes the site-specific endonucleolytic cleavage of X DNA and its packaging into phage proheads; it {{is composed}} of {{the products of the}} A Nul and A genes. We have developed a simple method to select mutations in the <b>terminase</b> genes carried on a high-copy-number plasmid, based on the ability of wild-type <b>terminase</b> to kill recA strains ofEscherichia coli. Sixty-three different spontaneous mutations and 13 linker insertion mutations were isolated by this method and analyzed. Extracts of cells transformed by mutant plasmids displayed variable degrees of reduction in the activity of one or both <b>terminase</b> subunits as assayed by in vitro A DNA packaging. A method of genetically mapping plasmid-borne mutations in the A gene by measuring their ability to rescue various A Aam phages showed that theA mutations were fairly evenly distributed across the gene. MutantA genes were also subcloned into overproducing plasmid constructs, and it was determined {{that more than half of}} them directed the synthesis of normal amounts of full-length A protein. Three of the A gene mutants displayed dramatically reduced in vitro packaging activity only when immature (uncut) X DNA was used as the substrate; therefore, these mutations may lie in the endonuclease domain of <b>terminase.</b> Interestingly, the putative endonuclease mutations mapped in two distinct locations in the A gene separated by at least 400 bp. The NuJ and A gene products (gpNul and gpA, respec...|$|E
40|$|The {{maturation}} {{and packaging}} of bacteriophage lambda DNA {{are under the}} control of the multifunctional viral <b>terminase</b> enzyme, which is composed of the protein products of Nu 1 and A, the two most leftward genes of the phage chromosome. <b>Terminase</b> binds selectively to the cohesive end site (cos) of multimeric replicating lambda DNA and introduces staggered nicks to regenerate the 12 -base single-stranded cohesive ends of the mature phage genome. The purified gpNu 1 subunit of <b>terminase</b> forms specific complexes with cos lambda DNA. DNase I footprinting experiments showed that gpNu 1 bound to three distinct regions near the extreme left end of the lambda chromosome. These regions coincided with two 16 -base-pair sequences (CTGTCGTTTCCTTTCT) that were in inverted orientation, as well as a truncated version of this sequence. Bear et al. (J. Virol. 52 : 966 - 972, 1984) isolated a mutant phage which contained a CG to TA transition at the 10 th position of the rightmost 16 -base-pair sequence, and this phage (termed lambda cos 154) exhibits a defect in DNA maturation when it replicates in Escherichia coli which is deficient in integration host factor. Footprinting experiments with cos 154 DNA showed that gpNu 1 could not bind to the site which contained the mutation but could protect the other two sites. Since the DNA-packaging specificity of <b>terminase</b> resides in the gpNu 1 subunit, these studies suggest that <b>terminase</b> uses these three sites as recognition sequences for specific binding to cos lambda...|$|E
