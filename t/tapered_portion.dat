50|$|Aircraft {{designers}} employed mostly {{planar wing}} designs with simple dihedral after World War II, {{prior to the}} introduction of winglets. With the wide acceptance of winglets in new sailplane designs of the 1990s, designers sought to further optimize the aerodynamic performance of their wingtip designs. Glider winglets were originally retrofitted directly to planar wings, with only a small, nearly right-angle, transition area. Once the performance of the winglet itself was optimized, attention was turned to the transition between the wing and winglet. A common application was tapering the transition area from the wing tip chord to the winglet chord and raking the transition area back, to place the winglet in the optimal position. If the <b>tapered</b> <b>portion</b> was canted upward, the winglet height could also be reduced. Eventually, designers employed multiple non-planar sections, each canting up at a greater angle, dispensing with the winglets entirely.|$|E

5000|$|The {{innermost}} cylinder {{forming the}} chamber and rifled bore {{is called a}} tube or, with certain construction techniques, a liner. A second layer cylinder called the jacket extends rearward past the chamber to house the breechblock. The jacket usually extends forward through the areas of highest pressure, through the recoil slide, and may extend {{all the way to}} the muzzle. The forward part of the barrel may be tapered toward the muzzle because less strength is required for reduced pressures as the projectile approaches it. This <b>tapered</b> <b>portion</b> of barrel is called the chase. Very large guns sometimes use shorter outer cylinders called hoops when manufacturing limitations make full length jackets impractical. Hoops forward of the slide are called chase hoops. [...] The jacket or forward chase hoop may be flared outward in the form of a bell at the muzzle for extra strength to reduce splitting because the metal at that point is not supported on the forward end. [...] As many as four or five layers, or hoop courses, of successively tensioned cylinders have been used. [...] Layers are designated alphabetically as the [...] "A" [...] tube enclosed by the [...] "B" [...] jacket and chase hoops, enclosed by the [...] "C" [...] hoop course, enclosed by the [...] "D" [...] hoop course, etc. Individual hoops within a course are numbered from the breech forward as the B1 jacket, the B2 chase hoop, and then the C1 jacket hoop, the C2 hoop etc. [...] Successive hoop course joints are typically staggered and individual hoop courses use lap joints in preference to butt joints to minimize the weakness of joint locations. Cylinder diameter may be varied by including machined shoulders to prevent forward longitudinal movement of an inner cylinder within an outer cylinder during firing. Shoulder locations are similarly staggered to minimize weakness.|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY The Celestin and Eder-Puestow {{methods of}} dilating benign {{oesophageal}} strictures have been compared prospectively in a randomised trial. One {{hundred and thirty}} three dilatations were performed on 72 patients. There {{was no significant difference}} between the two techniques with regard to the long term relief of symptoms. Celestin dilatation was quicker, less likely to cause pharyngeal trauma, and less damaging to guide wires. It could not be used, however, in those patients in whom only a short length of guide wire could be passed through the stricture. Dilatation of the oesophagus is an established technique for the treatment of benign strictures and as a prelude to the intubation of malignant lesions. ' The use of a guide wire, placed through the stricture at endoscopy and over which the dilators are passed, has greatly increased the safety of the procedure. 2 The Eder-Puestow metal olive dilators have been in use for many years and the method entails the successive passage of up to 12 olives each mounted on a separate stem, to a maximum diameter of 15 - 18 mm. Multiple dilatations are required in 60 % of patients. 3 The method described by Celestin and Campbell uses only two tapered dilators made from Neoplex, a firm but pliable material, 4 with maximum diameters of 12 and 18 mm respectively and the <b>tapered</b> <b>portion</b> is 20 cm in length.

40|$|Normally testis is {{developed}} in the abdomen and descends in to the designated scrotal sac {{at the time of}} birth or within one or two years after birth. Several factors are associated with proper descent of the testis. Failure to descend, may lead to undescended testis or cryptorchidism. In the present case, we found an undescended testis partly in the inguinal canal and partly in the abdomen in a 71 -year-old male cadaver. The epididymis descended first and its major portion was outside the superficial inguinal ring. The rest of the flattened epididymis was found inside the canal attached to the upper tapered pole of the testis and the vas deferens was found arising from this portion. The testicular vessels traversing through the deep inguinal ring then entered the postero-lateral portion of the <b>tapered</b> <b>portion</b> of the testis within the canal. No torsion and necrotic changes were observed in the undescended testis. Histological examination revealed a normal pattern in the epididymis which was outside the canal and a primitive duct system in the part of the epididymis within the canal. However, the entire testis showed only non-canalized smaller seminiferous tubules with very few cellular components and large inter-tubular spaces. The most common problems associated with such undescended testes are altered fertility, testicular cancer, inguinal hernia and testicular torsion with necrosis. Therefore, identifying the condition, evaluating the associated syndromes, proper diagnosis and therapeutic strategies are very important to prevent the adverse consequences mentioned above.

40|$|This report {{describes}} tests {{made for}} the purpose of determining the distribution of pressure over a model of the <b>tapered</b> <b>portion</b> of the upper wing and the aileron of a Fokker D-VII Airplane. Normal pressures were measured simultaneously at 74 points distributed over the wing and aileron. Tests were made throughout the useful range of angles of attack with aileron setting ranging from - 20 degrees to + 20 degrees. The results are presented graphically. It was found that the pressure distribution along the chord is in general similar to that of thick tapered airfoils previously tested. The maximum resultant pressure recorded was five times the dynamic pressure. The distribution of the air load along the span may be assumed to be uniform for design purposes. Aileron displacements affect the pressures forward to {{the leading edge of the}} wing and may increase the air load on the outer portion of the wing by a considerable amount. With the wing at large angles of attack, the overhanging portion of the aileron creates usually a burble flow and therefore a large drag. The balance reduces the control stick forces at small angles of attack for all aileron displacements. At large angles of attack it does this for small displacements only. With the airplane at its maximum speed, an angle of attack of 18 degrees, and a down aileron displacement of 20 degrees, the bending moment tending to break off the overhanging portion of the aileron will be greater than that caused by a uniform static load of 35 pounds per square foot...|$|E

30|$|The {{comparing}} the IT of self-tapping and non-self-tapping implants were resulted the self-tapping implant higher insertion values than with non-self-tapping implants {{in a clinical}} study (Marković et al. 2013). The conical Implant compared with cylindric screw-type implant resulted in higher primary stability in soft bone (Sakoh et al. 2006). The primary stability of five implant designs was compared in fresh human cadavers. In type 4 bones, the MkIV Brånemark implant maintained a high primary stability in compare with all other types tested (O’Sullivan and Sennerby 2000). However, when measuring the area of these white layers, {{it was found that}} self-tapping straight implant of MK 3 had the smallest, followed by ST, BL, TE, and self-tapping tapered implant of MK 4. Therefore, this result could be the implant macro-design (e.g. tapered and straight) effect to IT than cutting chamber. This order correlates with the implant torque values, suggesting that the size of the white layer is closely related to insertion torque values. It is presumed that the white layer occurs when the cell structure of the artificial bone is damaged by an external force, with variations in reflection factor and refractive index causing the area to become cloudy. Therefore, the location of the white layer is thought to correspond with the site of stress concentration. In addition, if the size of the white layer does indeed correspond with stress, it could be used to indicate the location, direction, and magnitude of force acting on the artificial bone. The present study showed that the IT and white layer increased according to the <b>tapered</b> <b>portion,</b> resulting in a positive correlation. In other words, the primary stability was shown to be highly dependent on the implant design.|$|E

The flagellar hairs of Olisthodiscus have identical morphology and dimensions to these internal elements. Zoospores of the filamentous xanthophycean algae Bumilleria sicula, Heterococcus spp. and Tribonema spp. have similar internal vesicles containing aligned tubes and fibres with precisely the same morphology and dimensions as the flagellar hairs: base plus shaft, 1 - 2 /im long, two terminal fibres per hair, 05 — 08 /*m long, shaft diameter of approximately 15 nm and a helical periodicity of the shaft of 8 nm. The aligned tubes are absent from the vegetative xanthophycean cell, appear during zoosporogenesis and disappear during early stages of zoospore settlement.

The Covered Endovascular Reconstruction of the Aortic Bifurcation (CERAB) technique was recently introduced to reconstruct the aortic bifurcation in a more anatomical and physiological fashion. The aim {{of this study is to}} compare the geometrical consequences of various stent configurations in vitro. METHODS: Anatomic vessel phantoms of the aortoiliac bifurcation were created to accommodate stent configurations. Self-expandable nitinol KS, balloon-expandable covered KS, and two versions of the CERAB configuration were deployed, one with the iliac legs positioned inside the tapered part of the aortic cuff (1) and one with the legs deployed above this level (2). Computed tomography data were obtained to assess the geometry. The conformation ratio (D-ratio) was calculated by use of the ratio of the major and minor axes. The proximal mismatch area, mean mismatch area, and total mismatch volume were calculated. RESULTS: The highest D-ratios were observed in the nitinol KS and the CERAB configuration, implying an ideal "double-D" shape. The proximal and mean mismatch areas were four- to sixfold lower in the CERAB (1) configuration when compared with nitinol KS and CERAB (2), respectively, whereas the covered KS had the highest mismatch area. Nitinol and covered KS had the largest mismatch volume, whereas the mismatch volume was the lowest in the CERAB (1) configuration. CONCLUSIONS: Although nitinol self-expandable stents have a high stent conformation, the lowest radial mismatch was found in the CERAB (1) configuration, supporting the hypothesis that the CERAB configuration is the most anatomical and physiological reconstruction of the aortic bifurcation. Within the CERAB configuration, the two limbs are ideally positioned inside the <b>tapering</b> <b>portion</b> of the cuff, minimizing mismatch...|$|R

To secure our material resources and to get better mechanical properties it is proposed to adopt the combined extrusion/forging and/or multi-stage processes for the production of different types of collet chuck holders. In general, it is found challenging to predict the metal flow by 3 D combined extrusion/forging process of complicated sections, collet chuck holder in particular, due to its complexity nature of analysis. From experiments it is observed that the complete process to get the first three components can be assumed to compose of four stages and fourth one of two stages with regard to forward/backward extrusion, forging, die corner filling, and flash formation. The mechanical, microscopic, micro hardness and residual stress analyses are performed for all the four components manufactured under different frictional conditions and ram velocities.

5000|$|The hippodrome at Mount Lykaion, {{located in}} a valley below and {{to the north of}} the altar, is the only extant hippodrome from Greek antiquity, and is {{therefore}} crucial to our understanding of Greek athletic festivals. The hippodrome was constructed on roughly a north-south orientation with a retaining wall of about 140 meters along the eastern side curving around the northern end. Modern excavations have discovered <b>portions</b> <b>tapering</b> column drums that may belonged to the turning posts at either end of the race-course, from whose location it appears that the hippodrome could have had a length of 320 meters and a width of 140. A bath building is being excavated about 35 meters to the northeast of the hippodrome; a large portion of it appears to have been dedicated to a cistern, and large stone basins from the middle of the structure have been uncovered ...|$|R
