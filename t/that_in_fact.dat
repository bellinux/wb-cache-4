5|$|According to {{specialist}} Gabriel Defert on {{the basis}} of statistical data available from the Portuguese and Indonesian authorities, and from the Catholic Church, between December 1975 and December 1981, approximately 308,000 Timorese lost their lives; this constituted about 44% of the pre-invasion population. Similarly Indonesian Professor George Aditjondro, formerly of Salatiga University in Java, concluded from his study of Indonesian Army data <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> 300,000 Timorese had been killed {{in the early years of}} the occupation.|$|E
5|$|John Fortescue's History of the British Army {{says that}} Howe's {{casualties}} numbered 214 British and 99 Hessians. However, Rodney Atwood {{points out that}} Fortescue's figure for the Hessians includes the entire Hessian casualties from 19–28 October and <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> only 53 of these casualties were incurred at the Battle of White Plains. This revised figure would give a total of 267 British and Hessians killed, wounded or missing at White Plains. Henry Dawson, on the other hand, gives Howe's loss as 47 killed, 182 wounded and 4 missing.|$|E

He reveals <b>that,</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact,</b> the Syndicate seeks Archer's head, and in this matter he is the slave and the Orion women are his masters. The Orions escape and travel to the Bridge, as do T'Pol and Tucker. Navaar tells Archer to arrest T'Pol, but Tucker stuns all the male crew-members with his phaser, and T'Pol disables the Orion ship with a pulse sent from Enterprise deflector dish. They send the Orions back to their ship, and T'Pol finally admits she would personally like Tucker to return, and he replies that he has already requested a transfer back to Enterprise.|$|E
5|$|Britain's key {{argument}} was that (prior to Venezuela's independence) Spain {{had not taken}} effective possession of the disputed territory, and said <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> the local Indians had had alliances with the Dutchs, giving the Dutch a sphere of influence which the British acquired in 1814. After fifty-five days of hearings, the arbitrators retired for six days. The American arbitrators found the British argument preposterous, since American Indians had never been considered to have any sovereignty. However the British had the advantage that Martens wanted a unanimous decision, and the British threatened to ignore the award if it didn't suit them. They were also able to argue a loss of equity, since {{under the terms of}} the treaty lands occupied for fifty years would receive title – and a number of British gold mines would be narrowly lost to this cutoff if their lands were awarded to Venezuela.|$|E
5|$|By 1968, {{the wild}} herd were {{concentrated}} mostly on BLM lands owing to previous roundups {{and construction of}} boundary fences. That year, the BLM again stated its intention to remove the herds, {{this time with the}} possibility of returning a small number (either 15 or 35) to the range. In response to the new announcement, the Pryor Mountain Wild Horse Association (PMWHA) was formed with the goal of preventing the roundup, and began working in concert with larger organizations such as the International Society for the Protection of Animals. The BLM argued that the horses were being removed because they were likely to starve, as they had overgrazed their environment, while the PMWHA argued the degradation of the range was not due to the horses and <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> they were in no danger of starving. The organization further charged that the BLM was acting at the behest of other state and federal organizations who wished to see the horses removed, rather than acting in line with public opinion. The PMWHA was also concerned with the effect that the penning would have on the feral horses.|$|E

5|$|The Earl of Oxford, {{commanding}} {{the right wing}} of the Neville army, broke the opposing Yorkist line, under William, Lord Hastings, early in the battle. Oxford's men proceeded to chase the fleeing soldiers, and ended up looting away from the battlefield. Oxford managed to regroup his men, but, returning to the battlefield, as James Ross has put it, 'disaster struck.' In the time he and his force had been absent, the line of battle had shifted almost ninety degrees, so instead of returning to attack Edward's rear, he crashed into Montagu's section. The fog prevented identification, and Oxford's men fought with Montagu's. Montagu may, one chronicler suggests, have mistakenly seen Oxford's 'Streaming star' banner as the king's 'Sunne in splendour,' and thus believe that the Earl had gone over to York. Recently though, one historian has pointed out <b>that,</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact,</b> Oxford had never previously used such a cognizance, and it was more prosaically just a case of men confused by fog.|$|E
5|$|The Liverpool {{painting}} {{was commissioned by}} Arthur George, Third Earl of Onslow, after Delaroche and George reportedly visited the Louvre in Paris, where they saw David's version of the famous event. It had only recently been re-hung in the museum after a resurgence of interest in Napoleon, nearly 40 years after he was exiled. Agreeing that the {{painting was}} unrealistic, George, who owned a sizable collection of Napoleonic paraphernalia, commissioned Delaroche {{to create a more}} realistic depiction. Elizabeth Foucart-Walker asserts <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> the painting that hangs in the Louvre was produced first as it was already in America by 1850, when the Liverpool painting was produced. Stephen Bann suggests that Arthur George's meeting with Delaroche may have occurred, but Delaroche chose to produce two works that are almost identical and send one to America. The Liverpool version of the painting is more refined.|$|E
