The Portuguese embassy had also become aware that ambassadors from the exiled King of Malacca were sent <b>to</b> <b>Beijing</b> seeking assistance from the Chinese emperor in expelling the conquering Portuguese so that their king could be reinstalled there. The Portuguese also knew of two officials in the Censorate—Qiu Daolong and He Ao— who sent memorials to the throne that condemned the Portuguese conquest of Malacca and that their embassy should be rejected.

5|$|When Hong Taiji died in 1643, he was {{replaced}} by the young Shunzhi Emperor and two co-regents: Dorgon and Jirgalang. In 1644, under their leadership, the Qing dynasty defeated the weakened Ming dynasty and moved its capital <b>to</b> <b>Beijing.</b> The Deliberative Council of Ministers was Dorgon's main policymaking body during his regency. Soon after moving <b>to</b> <b>Beijing,</b> he gave the Council control over both military and civil affairs, and expanded its membership to all lieutenant-generals and deputy lieutenant-generals in the Manchu and Mongol Banners, as well as to all Mongols and Manchus who held posts of Grand Secretary or Board president. Far from limiting Dorgon's power, the Council served as his tool to denounce and arraign other princes who challenged his authority. In May 1644, for instance, he had Hong Taiji's son Hooge accused of seditious behavior and made Hooge's enemies testify against him in front of the Council. He used the same method to purge Hooge for good in 1648.|$|E
