5|$|After Reagan's {{military}} buildup, <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union did {{not respond}} by further building its military because the enormous military expenses, along with inefficient planned manufacturing and collectivized agriculture, were already a heavy burden for <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> economy. At the same time, Saudi Arabia increased oil production, even as other non-OPEC nations were increasing production. These developments contributed to the 1980s oil glut, which affected <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union, as oil was {{the main source of}} Soviet export revenues. Issues with command economics, oil price decreases and large military expenditures gradually brought <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> economy to stagnation.|$|E
5|$|After {{the station}} opened, Soviet protests persisted. The issue was raised at {{official}} visits to <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union by Norwegian politicians in 1966, 1967 and 1968. <b>The</b> <b>Soviet</b> Consul in Barentsburg visited Ny-Ålesund in 1968 {{and attempted to}} make inspections of the installation. On 28 August 1968, Norway and <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union agreed for a one-time, two-day Soviet inspection of the station. The last protest against the installation was made in April 1969.|$|E
5|$|As part of <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union, the Armenian SSR {{transformed}} from a largely agricultural hinterland to an important industrial production center, while its population almost quadrupled from around 880,000 in 1926 to 3.3 million in 1989 due to natural growth and large-scale influx of Armenian Genocide survivors and their descendants. On August 23, 1990, it was renamed the Republic of Armenia after its sovereignty was declared, but remained in <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union until its official proclamation of independence on 21 September 1991. Its independence was recognized on 26 December 1991 when <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union ceased to exist. After the dissolution of <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union, {{the state of the}} post-Union Republic of Armenia existed until the adoption of the new constitution in 1995.|$|E
50|$|Despite having {{far fewer}} troops than <b>the</b> <b>Soviets,</b> <b>the</b> Finnish forces (12th division) {{repelled}} the Red Army because <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> were only prepared to proceed along roads. The Kollaa area had very few roads, {{all of them}} guarded by Finnish troops; and <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> {{were not able to}} proceed cross-country without skis.|$|R

5|$|Average wage {{rates in}} <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union were {{published}} relatively rarely. Some academics in the West believed {{this was because}} <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> government wanted to conceal low average earnings. Alec Nove wrote in 1966 (when wage statistics were published {{for the first time}} since the Second World War) that the lack of transparency surrounding average wages was intended to prevent Soviet workers from discovering the huge disparities that existed between wages in different sectors of <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> economy.|$|E
5|$|By 1985, {{international}} {{isolation and}} economic hardships had forced Vietnam to rely {{more and more}} on <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union for help. During the Chinese invasion in February 1979, <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union provided $1.4 billion worth of military aid to Vietnam, a figure that peaked at $1.7 billion in the period between 1981 and 1985. Then, to help Vietnam implement its third Five Year Plan (1981–1985), <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union provided a sum of $5.4 billion to the Vietnamese Government for its expenditures; economic aid ultimately reached $1.8 billion annually. <b>The</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union also provided 90 percent of Vietnam’s demand for raw materials and 70 percent of its grain imports. Even though the figures suggest <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union was a reliable ally, privately Soviet leaders were dissatisfied with Hanoi's handling of the stalemate in Kampuchea and resented the burden of their aid program to Vietnam as their own country was undergoing economic reforms. In 1986, <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Government announced that it would reduce aid to friendly nations; for Vietnam, those reductions meant the loss of 20 percent of its economic aid and one-third of its military aid.|$|E
5|$|By early 1985, Reagan's anti-communist {{position}} {{had developed}} into a stance known as the new Reagan Doctrinewhich, in addition to containment, formulated an additional right to subvert existing communist governments. Besides continuing Carter's policy of supporting the Islamic opponents of <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union and the Soviet-backed PDPA government in Afghanistan, the CIA also sought to weaken <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union itself by promoting Islamism in the majority-Muslim Central Asian Soviet Union. Additionally, the CIA encouraged anti-communist Pakistan's ISI to train Muslims {{from around the world}} to participate in the jihad against <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union.|$|E

50|$|On 2 March 1969, a {{group of}} People's Liberation Army (PLA) troops ambushed Soviet border guards on Zhenbao Island. <b>The</b> <b>Soviets</b> {{suffered}} 58 dead, including a senior colonel, and 94 wounded. The Chinese suffered 29 dead. <b>The</b> <b>Soviets</b> retaliated on 15 March by bombarding Chinese troop concentrations on the Chinese bank of the Ussuri River and by storming Zhenbao Island. <b>The</b> <b>Soviets</b> sent four T-62 tanks to attack the Chinese patrols on the island {{from the other side}} of the river. One of the leading tanks was hit and the tank commander was killed. On 16 March 1969, <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> entered <b>the</b> island to collect their dead; the Chinese held their fire. On 17 March 1969, <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> tried to recover the disabled tank, but their effort was repelled by the Chinese artillery. On 21 March, <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> sent a demolition team attempting to destroy the tank. The Chinese opened fire and thwarted <b>the</b> <b>Soviets.</b> With <b>the</b> help of divers of the Chinese navy, the PLA pulled the T-62 tank onshore. The tank was later given to the Chinese Military Museum.|$|R
5|$|Contemporaneously to {{establishment}} {{of the office of}} the President, representatives of the Congress of People's Deputies voted to remove Article 6 from <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> constitution which stated that <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union was a one-party state controlled by the Communist Party which, in turn, played the leading role in society. This vote weakened the Party and its hegemony over <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union and its people. Upon death, resignation, or removal from office of an incumbent President, the Vice President of <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union would assume the office, though <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union collapsed before this was actually tested. After the failed August Coup the Vice President was replaced by an elected member of the State Council of <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union.|$|E
5|$|Dissident {{success was}} mixed. Jews wanting to emigrate from <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union in the 1970s formed the most successful, and most organised, {{dissident}} movement. Their {{success can be}} attributed to the movement's support abroad, most notably from the Jewish community in the United States. In addition, as a group they were not advocating a transformation of Soviet society; the Jewish dissident movement was simply interested in leaving <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union for Israel. <b>The</b> <b>Soviet</b> Government subsequently sought to improve diplomatic ties with the First World by allowing the Jews to emigrate. The emigration flow was reduced dramatically as Soviet–American tension increased in the later half of the 1970s, though it was revived somewhat in 1979, peaking at 50,000. In the early 1980s, however, <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> leadership decided to block emigration completely. Despite official claims that anti-Semitism was a bourgeois ideology incompatible with socialism, the truth was that Jews who openly practiced their religion or identified as Jewish from a cultural standpoint faced widespread discrimination from <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> system.|$|E
5|$|During the Khrushchev era, {{especially}} from 1956 through 1962, <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union attempted to implement major wage reforms intended to move Soviet industrial workers {{away from the}} mindset of overfulfilling quotas that had characterised <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> economy during the preceding Stalinist period and toward a more efficient financial incentive.|$|E
25|$|A special British Joint Intelligence Subcommittee report titled German Strategy and Capacity to Resist, {{prepared}} for Winston Churchill's eyes only, predicted that Germany might collapse {{as early as}} mid-April if <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> overran its eastern defenses. Alternatively, the report warned that the Germans might hold out until November if they could prevent <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> from taking Silesia. Hence, any assistance provided to <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> on <b>the</b> Eastern Front could shorten the war. At the time of bombing, <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> were conducting their Lower Silesian Offensive.|$|R
25|$|The Poles and <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> re-established {{diplomatic}} relations in 1941, following the Sikorski-Mayski Agreement; but <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> broke them off again in 1943 after the Polish government demanded an independent {{examination of the}} recently discovered Katyn burial pits. <b>The</b> <b>Soviets</b> then lobbied <b>the</b> Western Allies to recognize the pro-Soviet Polish puppet government of Wanda Wasilewska in Moscow.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Soviets</b> {{attacked}} with 122nd Rifle Division. The stalling of {{the offensive}} forced <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> to reinforce it in late December 1939 with the 88th Rifle Division.|$|R
5|$|Following <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> {{occupation}} of Latvia in 1940 Latvia was annexed by <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union and the Freedom Monument was considered for demolition, but no such move was carried out. Soviet sculptor Vera Mukhina is sometimes credited for rescuing the monument, because she considered {{it to be}} of high artistic value. Soviet propaganda attempted to alter the symbolic meaning of the monument to better fit with Communist ideology, but it remained a symbol of national independence to the general public. Indeed, on June 14, 1987, about 5,000 people gathered at the monument to commemorate the victims of <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> regime and to lay flowers. This rally renewed the national independence movement, which culminated three years later in the re-establishment of Latvian sovereignty {{after the fall of}} <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> regime.|$|E
5|$|France, Egypt, <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union, Britain, Israel, {{and others}} were deeply {{involved}} in the civil war behind the scenes.

5|$|Hockey is Canada's {{national}} winter sport, and Canadians {{are extremely}} {{passionate about the}} game. The nation has traditionally done very well at the Olympic games, winning 6 of the first 7 gold medals. However, by 1956 its amateur club teams and national teams could not compete with the teams of government-supported players from <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union. <b>The</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union competed in its first World Championship in 1954, defeating Canada and winning the gold medal. At the 1956 Winter Olympics in Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy, <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> team went undefeated and won its first gold medal. Canada's team lost to the Soviets and the United States in the medal round, winning the bronze. The 1960 Winter Olympics, in Squaw Valley, United States, saw the first, and to date only, team from Australia compete in the tournament. Canada, <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union, Czechoslovakia and Sweden were the top four teams heading into the Games, but were all defeated by the American team, which won all seven games en route to its first Olympic gold medal.

5|$|Home Army {{relations}} with <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Red Army became increasingly poor {{over the course}} of the war. Not only had <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union invaded Poland on 17 September 1939, following the German invasion beginning 1 September 1939, but even after the Germans invaded <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union in June 1941 the latter saw Polish partisans loyal to the Polish Government in Exile more as a potential obstacle to Soviet plans to take control of postwar Poland, than as a potential ally. On orders from <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Stavka (high command), issued on 22 June 1943, Soviet partisans engaged Polish partisans in combat, and it has been claimed that they attacked the Poles more often than they did the Germans.|$|E
50|$|In Latvia, NKVD {{units were}} the main anti-partisan force {{fighting}} against 10,000 active members of the resistance forces. <b>The</b> <b>Soviets</b> signed separate ceasefire agreements with the different resistance forces, which did not become active until {{after the end of}} the war; the agreement in Lithuania differed from those in Estonia and Latvia. <b>The</b> <b>Soviets</b> introduced conscription immediately after their occupation of Vilnius in July 1944.

5|$|In 1954, <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union {{suggested}} that it should join NATO to preserve peace in Europe. The NATO countries, fearing that <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union's motive was to weaken the alliance, ultimately rejected this proposal.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union {{shot down}} a United States U-2 spy plane.

At first, the United States believed that Powers could be freed by crafting an argument regarding international principles. To this end, Miskovsky {{and two other}} lawyers (Alexander W. Parker and Frank Rogers) wrote a brief stating that Power's U-2 plane did not violate Soviet airspace any more than Sputnik violated American airspace. However, <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union refused to allow foreigners to defend Powers. Powers was ultimately defended by a lawyer who acted as a spokesman for <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> government.|$|E
50|$|In 1942 {{many of the}} {{remaining}} Japanese sailors left the River Defence Fleet and rejoined the Imperial Japanese Navy, severely limiting the Defence Fleet's operation efficiency.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Soviets</b> soon {{developed}} <b>the</b> 7.62×39mm M43 cartridge, the semi-automatic SKS carbine and the RPD {{light machine}} gun. Shortly after World War II, <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> developed <b>the</b> AK-47 assault rifle, which would quickly replace <b>the</b> SKS in <b>Soviet</b> service. In <b>the</b> 1960s, <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> introduced <b>the</b> RPK light machine gun, an AK-47 type weapon with a stronger receiver, a longer heavy barrel, and a bipod, {{that would eventually}} replace the RPD light machine gun.|$|R
25|$|These borders {{had little}} to do with ethnic make-up, but <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> felt it {{important}} to divide the region. They saw both Pan-Turkism and Pan-Islamism as threats, which dividing Turkestan would limit. Under <b>the</b> <b>Soviets,</b> <b>the</b> local languages and cultures were systematised and codified, and their differences clearly demarcated and encouraged. New Cyrillic writing systems were introduced, to break links with Turkey and Iran. Under <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> <b>the</b> southern border was almost completely closed and all travel and trade was directed north through Russia.|$|R
