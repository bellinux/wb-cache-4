5|$|Being {{the first}} period 8 element, ununennium is {{predicted}} to be an alkali metal, below lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, caesium, and francium.

Ununennium is predicted to continue the <b>trend</b> <b>and</b> have a valence electron configuration of 8s1. It is therefore expected to behave much like its lighter congeners; however, it is also predicted to differ from the lighter alkali metals in some properties.|$|E

5|$|Disrupted by {{mountains}} once again, Gustav never regained {{its former}} strength.

5|$|Justinian saw the orthodoxy of {{his empire}} {{threatened}} by diverging religious currents, especially Monophysitism, which had many adherents {{in the eastern}} provinces of Syria and Egypt. Monophysite doctrine, which maintains that Jesus Christ had one divine nature or a synthesis of a divine and human nature, had been condemned as a heresy by the Council of Chalcedon in 451, and the tolerant policies towards Monophysitism of Zeno and Anastasius I had {{been a source of}} tension in the relationship with the bishops of Rome. Justin reversed this <b>trend</b> <b>and</b> confirmed the Chalcedonian doctrine, openly condemning the Monophysites. Justinian, who continued this policy, tried to impose religious unity on his subjects by forcing them to accept doctrinal compromises that might appeal to all parties, a policy that proved unsuccessful as he satisfied none of them.|$|E
5|$|Lord Thomas Bulkeley {{bought the}} castle from the Crown in 1807 for £735, {{incorporating}} {{it into the}} park that surrounded his local residence, Baron Hill. By then the castles of North Wales had become attractive locations for visiting painters and travellers, who considered the ivy-clad ruins romantic. Although not as popular as other sites in the region, Beaumaris formed part of this <b>trend</b> <b>and</b> was visited by the future Queen Victoria in 1832 for an Eisteddfod festival and it was painted by J. M. W. Turner in 1835. Some of the castle's stones may have been reused in 1829 to build the nearby Beaumaris Gaol.|$|E
5|$|Most tern {{species are}} declining in numbers {{due to the}} loss or {{disturbance}} of breeding habitat, pollution and increased predation.

5|$|Retaliatory punishments, or Qisas, are practised: for instance, an eye can be surgically removed at {{the insistence}} of a victim who lost his own eye. This {{occurred}} in a case reported in 2000. Families of someone unlawfully killed can choose between demanding the death penalty or granting clemency in return for a payment of diyya, or blood money, by the perpetrator. There has been a growing trend of exorbitant blood-money demands, for example a sum of $11 million was reported as being recently demanded. Saudi officials and religious figures have criticized this <b>trend</b> <b>and</b> said that the practise of diyya has become corrupted.|$|E
5|$|The {{subsequent}} Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties would issue {{their own}} paper money as well.

At the archeological dig at Jehol there was a printing plate found that dated to the year 1214, which produced notes that measured 10cm by 19cm in size and were worth a hundred strings of 80 cash coins.

5|$|Though {{molybdenum}} forms compounds {{with various}} organic molecules, including carbohydrates and amino acids, it is transported throughout {{the human body}} as MoO42−. At least 50 molybdenum-containing enzymes were known by 2002, mostly in bacteria, and the number is increasing with every year; those enzymes include aldehyde oxidase, sulfite oxidase and xanthine oxidase. In some animals, and in humans, the oxidation of xanthine to uric acid, a process of purine catabolism, is catalyzed by xanthine oxidase, a molybdenum-containing enzyme. The activity of xanthine oxidase is directly proportional {{to the amount of}} molybdenum in the body. However, an extremely high concentration of molybdenum reverses the <b>trend</b> <b>and</b> can act as an inhibitor in both purine catabolism and other processes. Molybdenum concentration also affects protein synthesis, metabolism, and growth.|$|E

5|$|Typhoon Paka, {{known in}} the Philippines as Typhoon Rubing, was the last {{tropical}} cyclone of the 1997 Pacific Ocean hurricane and typhoon season, and was among the strongest Pacific typhoons {{in the month of}} December. Paka, which is the Hawaiian name for Pat, developed on November 28 from a trough well to the southwest of Hawaii. The storm tracked generally westward for much of its duration, and on December 7 it crossed into the western Pacific Ocean. Much of its track was characterized by fluctuations in intensity, and on December 10 the cyclone attained typhoon status as it crossed the Marshall Islands. On December 16, Paka struck Guam and Rota with winds of 230km/h (145mph), and it strengthened further to reach peak winds on December 18 over open waters. Subsequently, it underwent a steady weakening <b>trend,</b> <b>and</b> on December 23 Paka dissipated.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone Jokwe {{remained}} {{over land}} for about 18hours before emerging into the Mozambique Channel, weakening quickly to tropical storm status. Upon reaching open waters, convection {{increased over the}} center, and late on March 9 Jokwe re-intensified to a tropical cyclone as an eye reappeared on satellite imagery. The cyclone turned to the south-southeast, around the periphery of a ridge to its east. An upper-level low to its south produced good outflow which, in combination with warm waters, allowed Jokwe to re-intensify. Late on March 10, the storm passed about 35km (21mi) east of Europa Island, and shortly thereafter the MFR upgraded Jokwe to intense tropical cyclone status with winds of 170km/h (105mph). Subsequently, an increase in wind shear caused a steady weakening <b>trend,</b> <b>and</b> by March 12 Jokwe weakened to tropical storm status as its center became partially exposed from the deep convection; at the same time, the storm turned to the southwest.|$|E
5|$|In late September, a {{tropical}} wave persisted {{in the northeastern}} Atlantic Ocean. The low-pressure area later became sufficiently organized to be classified as {{a tropical}} storm at 0000 UTC on September 22. The disturbance quickly organized after tropical cyclogenesis, and reached a strength equivalent to a modern-day Category 1 hurricane strength at 1800 UTC later that day. The American steamship Otho encountered the system that day, and reported gale force winds {{in conjunction with a}} peripheral barometric pressure of 996 mbar (hPa; 29.42 inHg). The tropical cyclone continued to the east-northeast, where it gradually intensified. At 1200 UTC on September 23, the hurricane attained modern-day Category 2 hurricane intensity with winds of 100 mbar (155 km/h); a peak which would be maintained for at least the following 12 hours. A second steamship, the Lobito, reported hurricane-force winds along with a minimum pressure of 977 mbar (hPa; 28.85 inHg); this would be the lowest pressure measured associated with the tropical cyclone. After reaching peak intensity, the hurricane began a weakening <b>trend,</b> <b>and</b> degenerated to a Category 1 hurricane at 0600 UTC as it passed over the Azores. The following day, the hurricane recurved westward, where it weakened before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone on September 28. This remnant system subsequently dissipated.|$|E
