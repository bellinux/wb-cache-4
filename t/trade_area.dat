5|$|Uzbekistan remains {{hesitant}} {{to join the}} Economic Union, with Uzbek officials making opposing claims on the prospect of integration.

Uzbekistan began its integration process when Russia announced it would write off USD$865 million off debt owed by the country. Uzbekistan joined the CIS Free <b>Trade</b> <b>Area</b> in 2014, meaning it has free trade with EEU member states.|$|E

50|$|While {{those are}} only {{abstract}} {{examples of the}} ratings, consider how the system works in practice with the example of Ohio.

5|$|Missoula {{began as}} a trading post in the 1860s {{situated}} along the Mullan Military Road {{to take advantage of}} the first route across the Bitterroot Mountains to the plains of Eastern Washington. Its designation as county seat in 1866 and location of the hastily built Fort Missoula in 1877 ensured Missoula's status as a regional commercial center; a status further consolidated in 1883 with the arrival of the Northern Pacific Railway. The railroad expanded Missoula's <b>trade</b> <b>area</b> to cover a 150-mile radius, and Missoula's location as the railway's division point and repair shops provided hundreds of jobs. When the railway began expanding again in 1898, increased freight shipments came through the city, and with the arrival of the Milwaukee Road and regional office for the U.S. Forest Service as well as the opening of the Flathead Indian Reservation to settlement all within a couple years of each other beginning in 1908, the economy began to rapidly expand.|$|E
5|$|Beyond {{timber and}} education, Missoula's {{economic}} mainstay {{has been of}} one as a regional trade center. Missoula has an immediate <b>trade</b> <b>area</b> of approximately 180,000 residents. The Missoula is the hub of its Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) Economic Area, which includes the Montana Counties of Flathead, Lake, Lincoln, Mineral, Missoula, Ravalli, and Sanders. , the BEA listed the economic area population at 306,050. Key businesses sectors serving the area include health care, retail shopping, transportation, financial services, government and social services, education, events, arts and culture. Health care in particular is one of Missoula's fastest growing industries with St. Patrick Hospital (western Montana's only LevelII Trauma center) and the Community Medical Center already the city's second and third largest employers behind the university. 55% of employment in Missoula {{is made up of}} the service and retail sectors. Export industries are concentrated in heavy and civil engineering, construction, beverage production, technical services, truck transportation, and forestry-, logging-, and wood-related industries. In addition to nearly 4million out-of-state visitors annually, which makes tourism a significant aspect of the Missoula economy, Missoula also is home to a vibrant sector of alternative healthcare.|$|E
50|$|Trade blocs can be {{stand-alone}} {{agreements between}} several states (such as the North American Free Trade Agreement) {{or part of}} a regional organization (such as the European Union). Depending {{on the level of}} economic integration, trade blocs can be classified as preferential <b>trading</b> <b>areas,</b> free <b>trade</b> <b>areas,</b> customs unions, common markets, or economic and monetary unions.|$|R
40|$|The {{number of}} {{preferential}} trade agreements has greatly {{increased over the}} past two decades, yet most existing bilateral arrangements take the form of free <b>trade</b> <b>areas,</b> and less than ten percent can be considered to be fully °edged customs unions. This paper develops a political economy model of trade policy under imperfect competition to provide a positive explanation for the prevalence of free <b>trade</b> <b>areas.</b> In a three- country setting, a representative from each prospective member is elected to determine the tariffs to be applied on imported goods. Under a customs union, the necessity to coordinate tariffs leads voters to strategically delegate power to more protectionist representatives. Contrary to most of the existing literature, we show that strategic delegation may imply that free <b>trade</b> <b>areas</b> increase welfare compared to customs unions. Moreover, the model also indicates that free <b>trade</b> <b>areas</b> {{are more likely to be}} politically viable than customs unions. ...|$|R

5|$|Though both England and Scotland {{recognised}} Anne {{as their}} queen, only the English Parliament had settled on Sophia, Electress of Hanover, as the heir presumptive. The Parliament of Scotland (the Estates) had not formally settled the succession {{question for the}} Scottish throne. In 1703, the Estates passed a bill that declared that their selection for Queen Anne's successor {{would not be the}} same individual as the successor to the English throne, unless England granted full freedom of trade to Scottish merchants in England and its colonies. At first Royal Assent was withheld, but the following year Anne capitulated to the wishes of the Estates and assent was granted to the bill, which became the Act of Security 1704. In response the English Parliament passed measures which threatened to restrict Anglo-Scottish trade and cripple the Scottish economy if the Estates did not agree to the Hanoverian succession. Eventually, in 1707, both Parliaments agreed on an Act of Union which united England and Scotland into a single political entity, the Kingdom of Great Britain, and established the rules of succession as laid down by the Act of Settlement 1701. The union created the largest free <b>trade</b> <b>area</b> in eighteenth-century Europe.|$|E
