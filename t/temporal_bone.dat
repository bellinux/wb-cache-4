5|$|In {{other great}} apes, the foramen spinosum is found {{not in the}} sphenoid bone but {{in parts of the}} <b>temporal</b> <b>bone</b> such as the {{squamous}} part, found at the sphenosquamosal suture, or absent.|$|E
5|$|The {{inner ear}} sits within the <b>temporal</b> <b>bone</b> {{in a complex}} cavity called the bony labyrinth. A central area known as the {{vestibule}} contains two small fluid-filled recesses, the utricle and saccule. These connect to the semicircular canals and the cochlea. There are three semicircular canals angled {{at right angles to}} each other which are responsible for dynamic balance. The cochlea is a spiral shell-shaped organ responsible for the sense of hearing. These structures together create the membranous labyrinth.|$|E
5|$|People with cranial CSF leaks, the rarer form, have a 10% risk of {{developing}} meningitis per year. If cranial leaks last more than seven days, the chances {{of developing}} meningitis are significantly higher. Spinal CSF leaks cannot result in meningitis due to the sterile conditions of the leak site. When a CSF leak occurs at the <b>temporal</b> <b>bone</b> surgery becomes {{necessary in order to}} prevent infection and repair the leak. Orthostatic hypotension is another complication that occurs due to autonomic dysfunction when blood pressure drops significantly. The autonomic dysfunction is caused by compression of the brainstem, which controls breathing and circulation.|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} {{different}} malformations of the cochlea could be demonstrated. Nevertheless, {{we could not}} delineate a distinct malformation of the inner ear, that {{can be linked to}} a neural tube defect. Neural tube defects are a frequent and heterogeneous group of malformations, ranging from the survivable spina bifida to fatal anencephaly. In multiple animal models an involvement of the vestibulocochlear system has been demonstrated. In this article human fetal <b>temporal</b> <b>bones</b> of neural tube defects were analysed in a multimodular work-up. The morphologic study was performed with light microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and synchrotron radiation-based microcomputed tomography. Immunohistochemistry for different neuronal markers such as peripherin, beta-III-tubulin and vimentin helped to evaluate ontogenetic tissue development. Eight fetal <b>temporal</b> <b>bones</b> with neural tube defects and five control <b>temporal</b> <b>bones</b> were included into the morphologic study. The morphologic results of the neural tube defect <b>temporal</b> <b>bones</b> showed six regularly developed cochleas and two with only a single cochlear turn. Three of the neural tube defect <b>temporal</b> <b>bones</b> were further examined with immunohistochemical analysis. No differences in the staining pattern for peripherin, beta-III-tubulin and vimentin were detected...|$|R

5|$|The bony {{labyrinth}} {{refers to}} the bony compartment which contains the membranous labyrinth, contained within the <b>temporal</b> <b>bone.</b> The inner ear structurally begins at the oval window, which receives vibrations from the incus of the middle ear. Vibrations are transmitted into the inner ear into a fluid called endolymph, which fills the membranous labyrinth. The endolymph is situated in two vestibules, the utricle and saccule, and eventually transmits to the cochlea, a spiral-shaped structure. The cochlea consists of three fluid-filled spaces: the vestibular duct, the cochlear duct, and the tympanic duct. Hair cells responsible for transduction—changing mechanical changes into electrical stimuli {{are present in the}} organ of Corti in the cochlea.|$|E
5|$|Approximately {{one out of}} one {{thousand}} children suffer some type of congenital deafness related {{to the development of}} the inner ear. Inner ear congenital anomalies are related to sensorineural hearing loss and are generally diagnosed with a computed tomography (CT) scan or a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. Hearing loss problems also derive from inner ear anomalies because its development is separate from that of the middle and external ear. Middle ear anomalies can occur because of errors during head and neck development. The first pharyngeal pouch syndrome associates middle ear anomalies to the malleus and incus structures as well as to the non-differentiation of the annular stapedial ligament. <b>Temporal</b> <b>bone</b> and ear canal anomalies are also related to this structure of the ear and are known to be associated with sensorineural hearing loss and conductive hearing loss.|$|E
5|$|The pinna {{consists}} of the curving outer rim called the helix, the inner curved rim called the antihelix, and opens into the ear canal. The tragus protrudes and partially obscures the ear canal, as does the facing antitragus. The hollow region {{in front of the}} ear canal is called the concha. The ear canal stretches for about 1inch (2.5cm). The first part of the canal is surrounded by cartilage, while the second part near the eardrum is surrounded by bone. This bony part is known as the auditory bulla and is formed by the tympanic part of the <b>temporal</b> <b>bone.</b> The skin surrounding the ear canal contains ceruminous and sebaceous glands that produce protective ear wax. The ear canal ends at the external surface of the eardrum.|$|E

5|$|The {{two species}} of the {{wildebeest}} are known to hybridise. Male black wildebeest {{have been reported to}} mate with female blue wildebeest and vice versa. The differences in social behaviour and habitats have historically prevented interspecific hybridisation between the species, however hybridisation may occur when they are both confined within the same area. The resulting offspring is usually fertile. A study of these hybrid animals at Spioenkop Dam Nature Reserve in South Africa revealed that many had disadvantageous abnormalities relating to their teeth, horns and the wormian bones in the skull. Another study reported an increase {{in the size of the}} hybrid as compared to either of its parents. In some animals, the tympanic part of the <b>temporal</b> <b>bone</b> is highly deformed and in others the radius and ulna are fused.|$|E
5|$|The ear drum {{may become}} {{perforated}} {{in the event}} of a large sound or explosion, when diving or flying (called barotrauma), or by objects inserted into the ear. Another common cause of injury is due to an infection such as otitis media. These may cause a discharge from the ear called otorrhea, and are often investigated by otoscopy and audiometry. Treatment may include watchful waiting, antibiotics and possibly surgery, if the injury is prolonged or the position of the ossicles is affected. Skull fractures that go through the part of the skull containing the ear structures (the <b>temporal</b> <b>bone)</b> can also cause damage to the middle ear. A cholesteatoma is a cyst of squamous skin cells that may develop from birth or secondary to other causes such as chronic ear infections. It may impair hearing or cause dizziness or vertigo, and is usually investigated by otoscopy and may require a CT scan. The treatment for cholesteatoma is surgery.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} whether pathological findings {{were present in}} cochlear vessels for patients with diabetes mellitus. Twenty-six <b>temporal</b> <b>bones</b> from 13 patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and 40 <b>temporal</b> <b>bones</b> from 20 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were examined. Type 2 diabetic <b>temporal</b> <b>bones</b> were divided into 2 groups according to diabetic management (22 <b>temporal</b> <b>bones</b> with insulin therapy, and 18 with oral hypoglycemic drugs). Age-matched normal control <b>temporal</b> <b>bones</b> were also selected. The vessel wall thickness in the cochlear spiral modiolar artery was measured under a light microscope, and the vessel wall ratio (vessel wall thickness/outer diameter of the vessel× 100) was calculated. The vessel wall thickness and vessel wall ratio in type 1 diabetes mellitus were significantly greater than in normal controls. Type 2 diabetic patients with insulin therapy showed significantly greater vessel wall thickness and vessel wall ratios than controls. In type 2 diabetes mellitus, the vessel wall thickness and vessel wall ratio were greater in patients treated with insulin therapy than in those treated with oral hypoglycemic agents. Type 2 diabetic patients with insulin therapy showed an increased vessel wall thickness and vessel wall ratio {{compared to patients with}} type 1 diabetes mellitus. In conclusion, the cochlea in patients with diabetes mellitus shows circulatory disturbance compared to age-matched normal controls...|$|R

Objective: Comparison of blockage of the longitudinal flow of endolymph between ears affected by Meniere’s disease and normal ears. Methods: We examined 21 <b>temporal</b> <b>bones</b> from 13 subjects who had Meniere’s disease and 21 normal <b>temporal</b> <b>bones</b> from 12 controls. Results: The endolymphatic duct was blocked in five (23 %) ears affected by Meniere’s disease (p = 0. 016). The utricular duct was blocked in 16 (76 %) ears affected by Meniere’s disease and 11 (52 %) normal ears (p = 0. 112). The saccular duct was blocked in 6 (28 %) of ears affected by Meniere’s disease and 16 (76 %) normal ears (p = 0. 001).

40|$|Developmental {{events in}} the <b>temporal</b> <b>bones</b> shift the pattern of a given speech sound’s {{acoustic}} profile through the time children are mapping linguistic sound systems. Before age 5 years, frequency information in vowels is differentially accessible through the years children are acquiring the sound systems of their native language(s). To model the acoustic effects caused by developing <b>temporal</b> <b>bones,</b> data collected to elicit steady-state vowels from adult native speakers of English and Diné were modified to reflect the form of children’s hearing sensitivities at different ages based on patterns established in the psychoacoustic literature. It was assumed, {{based on the work}} of psychacousticians (e. g., Werner, Fay & Popper 2012; and Werner & Marean 1996), that the effects caused by immature <b>temporal</b> <b>bones</b> were conductive immaturities, and the age-sensitive filters were constructed based on psychoacoustic research into the hearing of infants and children. Data were partitioned by language, sex, and individual vowels and compared for points of similarity and difference in the way information in vowels is filtered because of the constraints imposed by the immaturity of the <b>temporal</b> <b>bones.</b> Results show that the early formant pattern becomes successively modified in a constrained pattern reflecting maturational processes. Results also suggest that children may well be switching strategies for processing vowels, using a more adult-like process after 18 months. Future research should explore if early hearing not only affects individual speech sounds but their relationships to one another in the vowel space as well. Additionally, there is an interesting artifact in the observed gradual progression to full adult hearing which may be the effect of the foramen of Huschke contributing to the filters at 1 year and 18 months. Given that immature <b>temporal</b> <b>bones</b> reflect brain expansion and rotational birth in hominids, these results contribute to the discussion of the biological underpinnings of the evolution of language.
