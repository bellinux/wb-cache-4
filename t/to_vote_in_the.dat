5|$|In 1572, Sigismund II Augustus, {{the last}} {{king of the}} Jagiellonian dynasty, died without any heirs.

5|$|In Taw Cheng Kong v. Public Prosecutor (1998), the High Court {{suggested}} on an obiter {{basis that}} voting {{is a privilege}} rather than a right.

If the right to vote were to be found to be implicit in the Constitution, the judiciary would be better able to protect the right when issues arise before the courts.|$|E

5|$|The Croatian Parliament tasked the Croatian State Election Committee with {{referendum}} voting organization, ballot counting, {{and result}} publication. The committee scheduled the referendum vote for 22 January 2012 starting at 07:00 and lasting until 19:00, at regular polling stations in Croatia, in Croatian military units, in Croatian diplomatic missions abroad, on Croatian-flagged vessels and in prisons: 6,750polling stations in all. For the referendum, all polling stations were grouped {{in a single}} district. Voters traveling abroad were permitted <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Croatian diplomatic missions as with Croatian presidential elections; however, the initial instructions by the Ministry of Public Administration did not allow voters within Croatia who were away from their place of residence <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> referendum, nor did it allow absentee ballots. GONG, the Croatian election supervision NGO, requested that the authorities correct this. One restriction was removed by 3 January, when voters were permitted to register to vote in Croatia away from their legal residence. Registration was possible until 7 January, in person, by fax, or by e-mail. When the registration process completed in early January 2012 ahead of the referendum, there were 4,504,686voters in the voter registry (the same one used in parliamentary and presidential elections).|$|E
5|$|The Virginia Secession Ordinance was to “repeal the {{ratification}} of the Constitution of the United States of America, by the State of Virginia.” Two days after the secession resolution and {{a month before the}} referendum, the Confederate flag was raised over Virginia's capitol building, a delegation was sent <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Confederate Congress, state militias were activated and a Confederate army was invited to occupy Richmond. Though the ballots from Unionist counties were lost, the total referendum votes counted numbered more than that of the 1860 presidential election by including men voting viva voce aloud in Confederate army camps, approving secession by 128,884 to 32,134.|$|E
30|$|For {{voters that}} live <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country that {{provides}} the most encouraging policies to enhance immigrants’ political participation (the Netherlands), Turkish and Islamic identifications relate positively <b>to</b> local <b>voting</b> likelihood. This corresponds to the theoretical expectations. These expectations are best reflected for Islamic identification, which relates negatively <b>to</b> <b>voting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country that has the least encouraging policies, namely Austria, while Islamic identification relates positively <b>to</b> <b>voting</b> <b>in</b> countries with <b>the</b> more encouraging policies, namely Germany and the Netherlands. The pattern is less clear {{when it comes to}} Turkish identification, since it relates positively <b>to</b> <b>voting</b> <b>in</b> Austria (though not significantly) and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Netherlands, the countries that differ the most when it comes to policies surrounding the political participation of immigrants. Therefore only partial support for hypothesis 2 is found.|$|R

5|$|The government's {{campaign}} was criticized as having poor promotional videos, especially lacking in informational value. The {{final days of}} the campaign were marked by events in support of and opposition to joining the EU, as the Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs set up an EU information event in Zagreb, while a protest against EU accession at the main city square drew 200 (some arrests occurred). The Croatian Bishops' Conference called on citizens <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> referendum, reminding Croatians that Croatia is a part of European culture while refraining from directly advocating either position. The Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts also supported joining the EU with 93 academicians in favour, 2 against and 1 abstention; they said that the event represents a great opportunity for Croatia. In contrast to EU accession opponents' request to postpone the referendum until Generals Gotovina and Markač were released by the ICTY, Gotovina himself urged citizens of Croatia <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> referendum and said that he would vote in favour of joining the EU.|$|E
