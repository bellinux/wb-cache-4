40|$|Abstract Background There are {{concerns}} that proton pump inhibitors (PPI) are being over prescribed in both {{primary and secondary}} care. This study aims to establish potential cost savings in a community drug scheme for a one year period according to published clinical and cost-effective guidelines for PPI prescribing. Methods Retrospective population-based cohort study in the Republic of Ireland using the Health Services Executive (HSE) Primary Care Reimbursement Services (PCRS) pharmacy claims database. The HSE-PCRS scheme is means tested and provides free health care including medications to approximately 30 % of the Irish population. Prescription items are WHO ATC coded and details of every drug dispensed and claimants’ demographic data are available. Potential cost savings (net ingredient cost) were estimated according to UK NICE clinical guidelines for all HSE-PCRS claimants on PPI therapy for ≥ 3 consecutive months starting in 2007 {{with a one year}} follow up (n= 167, 747). Five scenarios were evaluated; (i) change to PPI initiation (cheapest brand); and after 3 months (ii) <b>therapeutic</b> <b>switching</b> (cheaper brand/generic equivalent); (iii) dose reduction (maintenance therapy); (iv) <b>therapeutic</b> <b>switching</b> and dose reduction and (v) therapeutic substitution (H 2 antagonist). Results Total net ingredient cost was € 88, 153, 174 for claimants on PPI therapy during 2007. The estimated costing savings for each of the five scenarios in a one year period were: (i) € 36, 943, 348 (42 % reduction); (ii) € 29, 568, 475 (34 %); (iii) € 21, 289, 322 (24 %); (iv) € 40, 505, 013 (46 %); (v) € 34, 991, 569 (40 %). Conclusion There are opportunities for substantial cost savings in relation to PPI prescribing if implementation of clinical guidelines in terms of generic substitution and step-down therapy is implemented on a national basis. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background. Circulating microRNAs are {{appealing}} biomarkers to monitor several processes underlying cardiovascular diseases. Platelets {{are a major}} source for circulating microRNAs. Interestingly, the levels of specific microRNAs were reported to correlate {{with the level of}} platelet activation. The aim {{of the present study was}} to test whether the treatment with the novel antiplatelet agent, ticagrelor, is associated with modulation in the levels of key platelet-derived microRNAs. Methods and Results. Patients were randomly selected from those participating in the SHIFT-OVER study, in which we had previously evaluated the effect of the <b>therapeutic</b> <b>switch</b> from clopidogrel to ticagrelor on platelet aggregation. Circulating levels of selected microRNAs were measured before and after the <b>therapeutic</b> <b>switch</b> from a dual antiplatelet therapy including acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and clopidogrel to the more potent ticagrelor. Interestingly, the circulating levels of miR- 126 (p= 0. 030), miR- 223 (p= 0. 044), and miR- 150 (p= 0. 048) were significantly reduced, while the levels of miR- 96 were increased (p= 0. 038). No substantial differences were observed for the remaining microRNAs. Conclusions. Switching from a dual antiplatelet treatment with clopidogrel to ticagrelor is associated with significant modulation in the circulating levels of specific microRNAs. If confirmed in larger, independent cohorts, our results pave the way for the use of circulating microRNAs as biomarkers of platelets activity in response to specific pharmacological treatments...|$|R
40|$|Assessing tumor {{response}} to chemotherapy {{is crucial to}} patient management and is currently achieved by monitoring changes in tumor size using clinical examination backed up by radiologi-cal and sonographic measures. A poor response to the primary treatment regime usually prompts either change of chemo-therapy regime or an early resort to surgery. Poor response might also require {{a greater degree of}} surgical intervention. Complete and partial response to chemotherapy are associated with longer disease-free and overall survival, whereas minimal response suggests poor long-term survival regardless of postop-erative therapy. Many studies evaluated the role of early response for selecting subsequent therapy in patients initially treated with NACT. Early detection of response might be used: • As a predictor of pathological response. • As a predictor of long-term outcome. • As a decision tool to change therapy. • To identify patients who might (not) benefit from a <b>therapeutic</b> <b>switch...</b>|$|R
40|$|Background: Oncological disease {{progression}} {{can be difficult}} to manage for physicians, due to <b>therapeutic</b> <b>switch</b> after a previous treatments’ failure, but also because oncologist have to be linked with information about clinical conditions for patient reassurance. Our research considers person an integrated system, looking at fundamental needs of patients, according to theoretical and empirical basis of Neo-functionalism in psychology. Several studies report more unmet needs in patients affected by cancer, despite an increased attention about bad news communication. Previous studies in the field of healthcare have shown that both communication and psychological characteristics of patients are fundamental for the therapeutic alliance and satisfaction in care. Aims: This study aims to explore emotional experience and psychological needs of cancer patients who have experienced {{disease progression}}. Specifically, the study investigates unmet needs and their associations with illness perception and quality of life. Materials and Methods: The research included 61 cancer patients who have progressed after a chemotherapy. They have been undergone to psychological questionnaires to evaluate specific needs (Needs Evaluation Questionnaire – NEQ), illness perception (Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire – Brief IPQ) and quality of life (EORT QLQ-C 30). Also socio-demographic data and informations on medical therapies are considered. Results: Patients give greater importance to the empathic relationship with physician rather than accurate information about disease. Associations were found between factors observed. A patient who feels understood by the doctor has a positive illness perception and good quality of life. The need to be guided is the most reported by patients. Fragility in progression disease is accompanied by low illness control perceived, and greater delegation to the physician. The last result may be influenced by Sicilian cultural context, characterized by great caregiving and ability to be guided. Moreover, delegation to the physician is higher in patients with low levels of education. Conclusions: The results presented in this work seem to confirm that a greater knowledge about patient's specific needs of information, involvement, support, and associations with illness perception and perceived quality of life, facilitate care relationship in disease progression conditions. A good emotional contact is associated with less fear and more trust, so physician can guide patients also in difficult steps such as <b>therapeutic</b> <b>switch</b> after a previous treatments’ failure...|$|R
40|$|New {{formulations}} and <b>therapeutic</b> <b>switching</b> of {{the established}} drugs, amphotericin B and paromomycin, together {{with the discovery of}} miltefosine, have significantly improved the opportunities for treatment of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) chemotherapy. However, for human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), Chagas disease and cutaneous leishmaniases there has been limited progress. For HAT, a novel diamidine, parfuramidine, is in phase III clinical trial for early-stage disease, but for the treatment of late-stage disease there are no new drugs and combinations of eflornithine with melarsoprol or nifurtimox have been the focus of clinical studies. For Chagas disease, different classes of compounds that have validated biochemical targets, sterol biosynthesis methylases and cysteine proteases, are in various stages of development. The genome sequences that are now available for the pathogens that cause the leishmaniases and trypanosomiases, and new methods for rapid validation of targets, are part of the solution to discover new drugs. The integration of medicinal chemistry, pharmacokinetics, project planning and interaction with the pharma/biotech sector are essential if progress is to be made.

40|$|Generic {{losartan}} {{provides an}} opportunity to enhance angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) prescribing efficiency, with all ARBs essentially being similar. Initially, there was limited activity in NHS Bury (UK). This changed in March 2011 with <b>therapeutic</b> <b>switching</b> and other measures encouraging the prescribing of losartan following generics to enhance its utilization versus patented ARBs. This study aims {{to assess the impact}} of multiple measures on losartan utilization, its price and total ARB expenditure. An interrupted time series analysis was performed. Utilization was measured as prescription items dispensed, typically 28 days. No immediate change in losartan utilization was observed following generics. This changed after the multiple initiatives with losartan accounting for 65 % of all single ARB items dispensed by the study end. ARB expenditure was 59 % below prestudy levels by the study end, which was helped by a 92 % reduction in expenditure per item for losartan. Annual net savings from the program were estimated at just under GB£ 290, 000, which is over eight-times the cost of implementation. Multiple measures can enhance prescribing efficiency. Health authorities cannot rely on a 'spillover' effect from other classes in order to affect changes in physician prescribing habits...|$|E
40|$|The Office of Fair Trading (OFT) Report on the UK Pharmaceutical Price Regulation Scheme (PPRS) {{recommends}} {{that when the}} current five-year PPRS expires in 2010 it be replaced with 'value-based pricing' which involves pre-launch centralised government price setting based on a cost-per-QALY threshold plus periodic ex post reviews.

I conclude that PPRS has performed well as a procurement bargain between industry and the UK government. It does not, however, incentivise efficient relative prices. That is not its job. I identify a number of problems with the OFT proposals. I recommend that key elements of a reformed UK pharmaceutical environment for 2010 should include an expanded role for HTA but with companies retaining freedom to set prices at launch; HTA use targeted via a contingent value of information approach; a retained backstop PPRS, perhaps moving to an RPI-X type control; the use of risk sharing and non-linear pricing arrangements; measures to ensure more effective <b>therapeutic</b> <b>switching</b> at local level; and measures to improve the take up of cost-effective treatments.

40|$|Thalidomide is an {{effective}} immunomodulatory drug in man, but its mechanism of action remains unclear. We hypothesized that, {{in addition to its}} reported inhibitory effects on production of monocyte-derived tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), thalidomide might be effective at the level of Th immunoregulation. In a comparative study with the immunosuppressant cyclosporin A, we have demonstrated a potent and specific effect of thalidomide on cytokine production relating to the distinct Th 1 and Th 2 subsets. It induced and enhanced the production of IL- 4 and IL- 5 and, at the same dose (1000 ng/ml), significantly inhibited interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) production in phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) -stimulated human peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) cultures. Stimulation of PBMC with recall antigen (streptokinase:streptodornase (SKSD)) at 144 h in the absence of thalidomide resulted in a predominantly Th 1 response, with the production of IFN-gamma and IL- 2. Thalidomide switched this response from a Th 1 to a Th 2 type. The effect was most pronounced at 1000 ng/ml thalidomide, where inhibition of IFN-gamma and enhancement of IL- 4 production was maximal. In unstimulated cultures thalidomide alone induced IL- 4 production. Cyclosporin A, in contrast, inhibited both Th 1 and Th 2 cytokine production by PHA-stimulated PBMC. Time course data from thalidomide-treated cultures revealed that the augmented IL- 4 production diminished as the culture time increased, whereas IFN-gamma production was significantly increased. This response might be due to activation-induced apoptosis of Th 2 cells or the induction of Th 2 cell anergy, in the continued presence of stimulating agents, with the emergence of IFN-gamma-secreting Th 1 cells when Th 2 antagonism declines. The effects of thalidomide and related compounds may enhance our understanding of the mechanisms of T helper cell selection, offer the possibility of controlled <b>therapeutic</b> <b>switching</b> between Th 1 and Th 2 responses, and may lead to a rational approach for the treatment of some T cell-mediated immunological disorders...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Renin-angiotensin {{inhibitor}} {{drugs have}} been a target for health authority initiatives across Europe {{with the potential for}} substantial savings once generic angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) became available without compromising care. Recently, losartan was the first angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) to lose its patent. In Denmark, the authorities removed all other ARBs from the reimbursement list, apart from losartan, as they were all seen as essentially similar for the management of hypertension or congestive heart failure at appropriate doses, but more expensive. Similarly, all other ARB fixed-dose combinations (FDCs), apart from losartan, were removed from the reimbursement list. Objective: The aims of the study were to (i) assess the impact of these reimbursement changes on the subsequent utilisation of losartan and other ARBs alone or as FDCs; (ii) assess changes in the prices of losartan and other ARBs post-generic losartan to calculate potential savings; and (iii) compare the impact of the policies in Denmark with other European countries to provide guidance. Methodology: This was a retrospective segmented regression analysis of an interrupted time-series design comparing utilisation patterns before and after the changes in ARB reimbursement status. Utilisation was measured in defined daily doses (DDDs). Changes in total expenditure and expenditure/DDD were also assessed over time. Results: Losartan utilisation grew from 31 to 33 % of total single ARB utilisation before generic losartan, to 93 % by October 2011. There was a corresponding decrease in the utilisation of all other ARBs. Both changes were significant (p < 0. 001). Total expenditure on single ARBs in 2011 was 77 % below 2009 levels despite a 16 % increase in utilisation. Estimated savings were 290. 5 million Danish Kroner (DKK). A similar trend was seen for losartan FDCs, which was also significant (p < 0. 001). Discussion: Losartan utilisation grew appreciable following the changes. The change was much greater than seen in countries that had eased prescribing restrictions for losartan but not the other ARBs. Active <b>therapeutic</b> <b>switching</b> programmes plus education and financial incentives also significantly enhanced losartan utilisation following generics in two countries and regions; however, the increase in losartan utilisation was less than that seen in Denmark. © 2013 Springer International Publishing Switzerland...|$|E

Few studies have evaluated patients' views or understanding of <b>therapeutic</b> <b>switches.</b> AIM To obtain patient and pharmacist perspectives on switching from atorvastatin to simvastatin within an English Primary Care Trust (PCT). Method All patients undergoing this switch, in seven self-selected East Lancashire practices, were sent postal questionnaires covering demographics, experiences and views regarding switching, with no reminder. Practice pharmacists implementing switches in these practices were interviewed about processes and their views on these. Results: Pharmacists' switching process involved a standard letter offering a telephone consultation or appointment, plus an information leaflet. They considered most patients accepted switches, with few requesting consultations. Four hundred and ninety-four patients were identified and {{a response rate of}} 48. 6 % (240) obtained. The majority of respondents were happy with the switch (53. 7 %) and how they were informed (60. 1 %), with these findings being positively correlated. However over half (52. 9 %) did not understand the reason for the switch, particularly those with lower educational qualifications. Patients unhappy about switching perceived they had experienced side effects, or only learned of the switch on collecting a prescription or did not recall the consultation offer. Respondents indicated a preference for future switches to involve a face-to-face consultation (59. 8 %), with two-thirds (65. 2 %) agreeing that community pharmacists should explain medication switches. Conclusion: The standard process used, in line with nationally-designed templates, resulted in many patients being unhappy with or lacking understanding of switching statins, suggesting that improvements may be needed...|$|R

It is approved by regulatory agencies (eg, US Food and Drug Association, European Medicines Agency) in all {{countries in which}} it is manufactured, except Switzerland, as first-line highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for the treatment of naïve patients with HIV infection and a viral load HIV-RNA level of ≤ 100, 000 copies/mL. Two large trials (ECHO and THRIVE) comparing RPV with efavirenz, along with different background regimens, led to approval of the drug, while a more recent trial (STaR) explored the use of STR. RPV showed noninferiority to efavirenz in all the studies, including superiority as an STR in patients with HIV-RNA ≤ 100, 000 copies/mL in the STaR study. A positive CD 4 cell response was observed in all the studies, both in the RPV and efavirenz groups. The incidence of virologic failures was higher for RPV, but was mostly referred to patients with HIV-RNA > 100, 000 copies/mL. There were fewer adverse events (AEs) with the RPV-based regimens versus efavirenz-based regimens, with a lower discontinuation rate because of AEs, especially psychiatric–neurological AEs, and a significantly lower rate of blood-lipid abnormalities. In the SPIRIT study (a switch study), significantly greater improvements from baseline in serum total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and trygliceride were demonstrated in patients switching to RPV/FTC/TDF from a ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor (PI/r) -based regimen, than in those who continued treatment with a PI/r regimen. RPV&# 39;s better tolerability, associated with its once-daily STR formulation, is key to improving patients&# 39; adherence and quality of life, which are among the most important factors affecting the therapeutic efficacy of an antiretroviral regimen. In summary, RPV/FTC/TDF STR is a valuable treatment option for the majority of antiretroviral-naïve HIV-infected patients.

40|$|Introduction: Low {{bone mineral}} density (BMD) and {{osteoporosis}} are prevalent in HIV-infected patients and {{were associated with}} HIV infection and tenofovir-containing ART. Materials and Methods: The GUSTA study (GUided Simplification with Tropism Assay) is a two-arm, prospective, multicenter, 1 : 1 randomized controlled trial designed to demonstrate the non-inferiority of <b>therapeutic</b> <b>switch</b> to maraviroc+darunavir/ritonavir (MVC+DRV/r) 300 / 800 / 100 mg QD against the continuation of previous triple cART in patients with stable virological suppression. Enrolment criteria include HIV 1 -RNA 6 months, R 5 tropism and CD 4 > 200 cells/µL for > 3 months. Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry scans of proximal femur and lumbar spine were performed at baseline and week 48. Bone composition was evaluated using L 2 -L 4 lumbar column and proximal femoral BMD, T-score and the Z-score. At the same timepoints, plasma bone metabolism biomarkers were measured. Linear regression {{was used to compare}} means of differences between arms. The association between BMD changes and the baseline variables was assessed by linear regression. Results: 27 patients were included, 13 from study group and 14 from control group, 74. 1 % were males, 44. 4 % heterosexuals, 81. 5 % Caucasian, median age was 47 years (IQR 41 – 53), time from HIV diagnosis 13. 4 years (9 – 19), CD 4 553 /µL (406 – 739), nadir CD 4 201 /µL (76 – 283). At baseline, median ART duration was 10. 5 years (5. 7 – 15. 3), the majority of patients (70. 4 %) was on tenofovir, 63 % was on a PI-based regimen and 14, 8 % on an NNRTI-based regimen. Mean proximal femur BMD from baseline increased over 48 weeks by 2. 06 % (SD 2. 24) in the study arm and decreased by − 2. 77 % (SD 4. 63) in control arm (p= 0. 003). The change over 48 weeks in proximal femur T-score was significantly different between the study (+ 0. 11, SD 0. 22) and control arm (− 1. 14, SD 0. 27, p= 0. 016).

40|$|Background An {{increase}} of therapeutic substitution after patent expiry {{might have a}} negative effect on cost-savings generated with newly introduced generic drugs. To evaluate influences of patent expiry on <b>therapeutic</b> substitution, <b>switch</b> behaviour before and after patent expiry was investigated. Aim To describe proton pump inhibitor use and investigate substitution patterns from omeprazole before and after patent expiry. Methods Data were obtained from the InterAction DataBase. Proportional proton-pump inhibitor use was identified per quarter during the study period 2000 - 2003. For the second part two cohorts - one before and one after patent expiry - were defined. The number of switchers was quarterly identified during 2 -year follow-up period. For statistical analyses the chi-square test and hazard ratio were used. Results In proportional use, a downward trend for omeprazole was found. After patent expiry, significantly more patients switched to other proton pump inhibitors (P < 0. 001). The hazard ratio of 0. 62 (95 % CI: 0. 57 - 0. 69), indicates that for every six patients switching before patent expiry, 10 patients switch after patent expiry. Conclusions After patent expiry more patients switch to another proton pump inhibitor. In light of the total savings achieved with generic omeprazole, the importance of this negative impact on total cost-savings on proton pump inhibitors is unclear...|$|R

In the 18 patients (17.3 %) with I-AU that showed improvement, the administration of corticosteroids was prolonged for several months, then tapered, and finally discontinued in the following 12  months; immunosuppressive drugs were, however, maintained until remission. The same treatment modality was employed in ten patients (9.6 %) with SDA-AU, who likewise improved when the immunosuppressive drugs were maintained. Finally, in the 31 patients with worsening disease (29.8 %), including 21 with I-AU and 10 with SDA-AU, the <b>therapeutic</b> approach was <b>switched</b> to one based on monoclonal antibodies.|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} of atypical antipsychotics represents an important {{advance in the}} treatment of schizophrenia. As their therapeutic efficacy, tolerability and safety profiles are clearly superior to classical neuroleptics, atypical antipsychotic agents are considered to be the treatment of choice in first episode patients. In addition, an increasing number of patients are being switched from classical to atypical antipsychotic agents. Switching is especially relevant in patients with a poor therapeutic response to classical neuroleptics and persistent symptoms (positive symptoms, negative symptoms, depressive syndromes, cognitive deficit); in patients with a psychotic relapse despite compliance; in patients with important side-effects (not only acute and tardive extrapyramidal symptoms [EPS] and general side-effects, but also dysphoria or neuroleptic-induced deficit syndrome [NIDS]); and in patients who are non-compliant due to side-effects. Switching to atypical antipsychotics should be performed with extreme care in stabilised patients; or in patients who present a danger to themselves or others at relapse; or in patients who are on depot neuroleptics who were non-compliant to previous oral treatment. Switching requires careful planning {{to reduce the risk of}} withdrawal effects (neuroleptic withdrawal syndrome, cholinergic rebound, exacerbation of symptoms or relapse, rebound of parkinsonism, dystonia, akathisia, dyskinesia), which may mask the beneficial effects and lead to early discontinuation of the new treatment. Patients, family and carers should be actively involved at all stages, and educated about the possible benefits and problems associated with switching therapy. Cross-tapering old and new treatment is the preferred method for switching and this involves tapering off the previous antipsychotic agent and any adjunctive treatment (sedatives, anticholinergic medication), while gradually titrating the new atypical antipsychotic agent to the established <b>therapeutic</b> dose. <b>Switching</b> patients to amisulpride treatment offers effective antipsychotic therapy, with a positive effect on negative and depressive symptoms. Amisulpride treatment also results in improved quality of life and social functioning in addition to fewer relapses and days of hospitalisation during long-term follow-up. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|As a therapist, the {{therapeutic}} alliance {{formed in the}} relationship building phase of counseling is of critical importance in {{setting the stage for}} the future success and outcomes of treatment. When working with an ethnic minority population, it is imperative that the therapist take into consideration aspects of the client’s culture, such as language and socio cultural norms. At times the therapist must also accept that he/she is not the majority culture represented, but rather he/she is the minority. Therapists must also remember that they themselves are not the client and, as such, must switch their perspective to those of the individual with whom they are working. With this comes the question of how cultural diversity fits into this need for therapists to <b>switch</b> <b>therapeutic</b> modalities. The United States has traditionally been known as “the melting pot ” of the world. Increased immigration into the country has caused several subcultures within the larger American culture to develop, which is evidenced by areas in large cities known as “China town”, “Little Italy ” etc. While there are several ethnic subcultures contained within the United States, the focus of this paper will be on the Hispanic culture. However, please note that the research and ideas contained within this document can and should be applied to other cultures as well...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} the <b>therapeutic</b> effects of <b>switching</b> from one acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (ChEI), donepezil, galantamine or rivastigmine, {{to another in}} Alzheimer's disease patients. METHODS: We retrospectively enrolled 171 Alzheimer's disease patients, whose ChEI medication was changed. The patients were evaluated on three major aspects of dementia - cognitive, affective and {{activities of daily living}} (ADL) measures - at 6 months (M) before the drug switch, at the time of drug switch (baseline), and at 3 M and 6 M after the drug switch. RESULTS: The doses of the three ChEI were significantly lower at 6 M after the switch compared with the pre-switch doses. Improvements in apathy were found at 3 M when switching from donepezil to galantamine, but not to rivastigmine, but this switch had adverse effects on ADL. Improvements in cognitive scores at 3 M were also found when switching from galantamine to rivastigmine, but not to donepezil. However, both of these changes improved Abe's Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia scores (ABS), except ADL. Switching from rivastigmine to donepezil worsened ABS at 6 M, but preserved cognitive and ADL scores. CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests that despite a relatively lower dose of ChEI after the switch, switching from donepezil or rivastigmine preserved cognitive functions for at least 6 M. Switching from galantamine to rivastigmine improved Mini-Mental State Examination and ABS at 3 M, but did not improve ADL scores. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2017; 17 : 1843 - 1848...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To prospectively {{evaluate}} {{the safety and}} short-term <b>therapeutic</b> efficacy of <b>switching</b> monopolar radiofrequency ablation (RFA) with multiple electrodes to treat medium-sized (3. 1 - 5. 0 cm), hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC). Materials and Methods: In this prospective study, 30 patients with single medium-sized HCCs (mean, 3. 5 cm; range, 3. 1 - 4. 4 cm) were enrolled. The patients were treated under ultrasonographic guidance by percutaneous switching monopolar RFA with a multichannel RF generator {{and two or three}} internally cooled electrodes. Contrast-enhanced CT scans were obtained immediately after RFA, and the diameters and volume of the ablation zones were then measured. Follow-up CT scans were performed at the first month after ablation and every three months thereafter. Technical effectiveness, local progression and remote recurrence of HCCs were determined. Results: There were no major immediate or periprocedural complications. However, there was one bile duct stricture during the follow-up period. Technical effectiveness was achieved in 29 of 30 patients (97 %). The total ablation time of the procedures was 25. 4 ± 8. 9 minutes. The mean ablation volume was 73. 8 ± 56. 4 cm 3 and the minimum diameter was 4. 1 ± 7. 3 cm. During the follow-up period (mean, 12. 5 months), local tumor progression occurred in three of 29 patients (10 %) with technical effectiveness, while new HCCs were detected in six of 29 patients (21 %). Conclusion: Switching monopolar RFA with multiple electrodes in order to achieve a sufficient ablation volume is safe an...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, we {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the role of inflammation in Myelofibrosis (MF) and the cross-talk between leukemic cells and their microenvironment in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). In MF, we explored how inflammatory stimuli could modulate the malignant clone of HSCs. We observed potent effects of combinations of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL- 1 β/ TNF-α/TIMP- 1) on survival, clonogenic potential and migration of CD 34 + cells isolated from MF patients at diagnosis or without treatment. Our {{data suggest that the}} malignant clone is driven not only by intrinsic properties but also by the interplay with the inflammatory microenvironment. In AML, we showed that an inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP- 1) could be considered as a ‘bad actor’ in the leukemic context. TIMP- 1 modulates different pathways and we highlighted a cytokine function on AML blasts from AML patients at diagnosis. The survival, migration and proliferation of AML blasts was supported by TIMP- 1, delineating a signaling pathway mediated through its receptor CD 63 and PI 3 K/Akt/p 21. In parallel, in a mouse model of AML MLL-AF 9, we also explored the interaction between bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) and leukemic blasts. Through a novel system of co-cultures, we demonstrated the supportive/protective role of BMSCs, as non-adherent cells 'mesenspheres'. In this cross-talk we found a reduction of ROS levels and lipid peroxidation in leukemic blasts co-cultured with BMSCs, in stressed conditions. Importantly, we found also chemo-protective role of mesenspheres on leukemic cells mediated by mitochondria transfer. Surprisingly, this interaction could be explained as transfer of sources of anti-oxidants and nutrients between BMSCs and leukemic cells. Through the entire work, we shed new light on mechanisms and networks in haematological malignancies, such as MF and AML, driving toward novel <b>therapeutic</b> strategy to <b>switch</b> off an inflammatory microenvironment and key players of the malignant niches...|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesThis study {{sought to}} assess the {{effectiveness}} of a strategy of using drug-eluting stents (DES) with a different drug (switch) in patients with DES in-stent restenosis (ISR). BackgroundTreatment of patients with DES ISR remains a challenge. MethodsThe RIBS-III (Restenosis Intra-Stent: Balloon Angioplasty Versus Drug-Eluting Stent) study was a prospective, multicenter study that aimed to assess results of coronary interventions in patients with DES ISR. The use of a different DES was the recommended strategy. The main angiographic endpoint was minimal lumen diameter at 9 -month follow-up. The main clinical outcome measure was a composite of cardiac death, myocardial infarction, and target lesion revascularization. ResultsThis study included 363 consecutive patients with DES ISR from 12 Spanish sites. The different-DES strategy was used in 274 patients (75 %) and alternative <b>therapeutic</b> modalities (no <b>switch)</b> in 89 patients (25 %). Baseline characteristics were similar in the 2 groups, although lesion length was longer in the switch group. At late angiographic follow-up (77 % of eligible patients, median: 278 days) minimal lumen diameter was larger (1. 86 ± 0. 7 mm vs. 1. 40 ± 0. 8 mm, p = 0. 003) and recurrent restenosis rate lower (22 % vs. 40 %, p = 0. 008) in the different-DES group. At the last clinical follow-up (99 % of patients, median: 771 days), the combined clinical endpoint occurred less frequently (23 % vs. 35 %, p = 0. 039) in the different-DES group. After adjustment using propensity score analyses, restenosis rate (relative risk: 0. 41, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 0. 21 to 0. 80, p = 0. 01), minimal lumen diameter (difference: 0. 41 mm, 95 % CI: 0. 19 to 0. 62, p = 0. 001), and the event-free survival (hazard ratio: 0. 56, 95 % CI: 0. 33 to 0. 96, p = 0. 038) remained significantly improved in the switch group. ConclusionsIn patients with DES ISR, the implantation of a different DES provides superior late clinical and angiographic results than do alternative interventional modalities...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the cost effectiveness of commonly used antidepressants as first-line treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) in Belgium. The model structure was based on a decision tree developed by the Swedish TLV (TandvAyenrds- och lakemedelsformAyennsverket) and adapted to the Belgium healthcare setting, using primary local data on the patterns of treatment and following KCE [Federal Knowledge Center (Federaal Kenniscentrum voor de Gezondheidszorg) ] recommendations. Comparators were escitalopram, citalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, duloxetine, venlafaxine, and mirtazapine. In the model, patients not achieving remission or relapsing after remission on the assessed treatment moved to a second <b>therapeutic</b> step (titration, <b>switch,</b> add-on, or transfer to a specialist). In case of failure in the second step or following a suicide attempt, patients were assumed to be referred to secondary care. The time horizon was 1 year and the analysis was conducted from the National Institute for Health and Disability Insurance (NIHDI; national health insurance) and societal perspectives. Remission rates were obtained from the TLV network meta-analysis and risk of relapse, efficacy following therapeutic change, risk of suicide attempts and related death, utilities, costs (2012), and resources were derived from the published literature and expert opinion. The effect of uncertainty in model parameters was estimated through scenario analyses and a probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA). In the base-case analysis, escitalopram was identified as the optimal strategy: it dominated all other treatments except venlafaxine from the NIHDI perspective, against which it was cost effective with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of a,not sign 6, 352 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Escitalopram also dominated all other treatments from the societal perspective. At a threshold of a,not sign 30, 000 per QALY and from the NIHDI perspective, the PSA showed that the probability of escitalopram being identified as the optimal strategy ranged from 61 % (vs. venlafaxine) to 100 % (vs. fluoxetine). Escitalopram was associated with the highest probability of being the optimal treatment from the NIHDI and societal perspectives. This analysis, based on new Belgian clinical practice data and following KCE requirements, provides additional information that may be used to guide the choice of treatments in the management of MDD in Belgium...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare the rate and extent of nifedipine bioavailability after single dose administration of Adalat OROS 30 (Reference) and Nifedipine Sandoz retard 30 tablets (Test). Both modified release formulations are marketed in Member States of the European Union. Prior to the clinical study the in vitro dissolution characteristics were investigated. There was a significant pH dependency observed with the Test product but drug release with the Reference product was almost independent of the experimental conditions used. In the subsequent open, randomized, controlled, 4 -way crossover study both pharmaceutical products were administered to 28 healthy male volunteers, either after fasting overnight or immediately after a high-fat American breakfast. Blood sampling was performed over 48 hours post-dose for the determination of pharmacokinetic profiles of nifedipine. Considerable differences were observed between the two formulations when administered to fasted subjects where maximum nifedipine plasma concentration (C(max)) were higher in the case of the Test formulation. Differences were even more pronounced after a high-fat American breakfast. Under these conditions a significant food interaction was detected in the case of Nifedipine Sandoz retard 30 with a three-fold increase in the mean C(max) when compared to values obtained in fasting subjects. In contrast, food intake had no clinically relevant effect on bioavailability of nifedipine (rate and extent) in the case of Adalat OROS 30. The pharmacokinetic findings in this study were reflected in the adverse event pattern which indicated a potential tolerability problem in the case of Nifedipine Sandoz retard 30. The results confirm the relationship between the in vitro dissolution profile results and the effects of the drug in vivo. Dose dumping after intake of a high-fat meal could be shown. Nifedipine Sandoz retard 30 is not bioequivalent to Adalat OROS 30 and produced highly variable and poorly predictable nifedipine plasma concentrations. The differences observed between the two products investigated may have direct <b>therapeutic</b> relevance when <b>switching</b> from one formulation to the other and, in particular, when administration conditions change i. e. administration in the fasting state and administration with a meal, since the pharmacological and therapeutic actions of nifedipine are closely associated with the concentratio...|$|R
40|$|Background/Aim. Switching {{the patient}} from one {{pharmaceutical}} {{formulation of the}} same drug to another, may lead to therapeutic inadequancy in some cases. To minimize the risk, careful pharmacokinetic studies are desired in the pre-registration period and afterwards. Methods. A randomized, crossover design with one-week wash-out period between each dose was applied. Serum samples, obtained before dosing and at various appropriate time points up to 15 hours, were analyzed for nimesulide content by a high-performance liquid chromatographic method with ultraviolet (UV) detection. The pharmacokinetics and relative bioavailability of three different pharmaceutical formulations containing nimesulide, manufactured by the same pharmaceutical factory, were studied prospectively in 12 healthy subjects of both sexes. A single 100 -mg oral dose of nimesulide {{was given to the}} volunteers in the form of conventional tablets, mouth dissolving tablets or as a suspension. Analysis of variance, power analysis, 90 % confidence intervals, and two one-sided tests were used for the statistical analysis of pharmacokinetic parameters. Results. The tolerability of all preparations was excellent. The respective confidence intervals of the ratios of geometric means of Cmax and AUC 0 - ∝ of nimesulide were out of acceptable limits either for conventional tablets in comparison with suspension or for mouth dissolving tablets when compared with conventional tablets. A comparison of mouth dissolving tablets with suspension showed a statistically significant difference between Cmax values (suprabioavailability of mouth dissolving tablets), while the point estimate of the ratio of geometric means of AUC 0 - ∝ was 0. 945 with the corresponding 90 % confidence interval of 0. 902 − 0. 991. At the 5 % level of significance, there were no differences between the formulations under the study in times elapsed to peak serum concentrations, as revealed by the non-parametric Wilcoxon signed ranks test. Conclusion. Only a 90 % confidence interval for the relative differences of log-transformed AUC 0 - ∝ values of nimesulide absorbed from mouth dissolving tablets vs. suspension was included in the 80 % to 125 % interval proposed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). On that basis, mouth dissolving tablets (Nimulid-MD ™) were considered bioequivalent to Nimulid ™ suspension according to the extent of drug absorption. Concerning the comparable amounts of nimesulide available in the systemic circulation after application of these formulations the one might not expect <b>therapeutic</b> failure after <b>switching</b> the patient from one to another...|$|R
