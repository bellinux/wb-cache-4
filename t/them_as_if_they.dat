5|$|In the Northern Territory, P. fimbriata has {{no special}} tactics against other jumping spiders {{and tries to}} treat <b>them</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were web spiders, and then either tries to jump on them or gives up. Hence this variant is poor at {{catching}} other jumping spiders. The Northern Territory variant of P. fimbriata {{is not as good}} as the Queensland one as catching web spiders, but better than the Sri Lanka variant and some other species of Portia. It is not enthusiastic about pursuing insects, but very good at catching those it pursues, as the performance table above shows While pursuits by the Queensland variant typically take 26minutes, those of the Northern Territory variant typically take 3 to 5minutes, like some other species of Portia.|$|E

No matter how fantastic or improbable her statements, she always delivered <b>them</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were the irrefutable truth.

Eupen worked closely with the SS and German police commanders in Warsaw during the deportation of Jews in early 1943 and had prisoners brought to him from the Warsaw Ghetto for the necessary replacements. According to Franciszek Ząbecki, the local station master, Eupen often killed prisoners by [...] "taking shots at <b>them,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were partridges".

500|$|The {{two main}} writers, Brenton and Wolstencroft, had {{different}} styles and influences in their scripts. Wolstencroft {{was influenced by}} American television to make the episodes pacier. His chosen writing style {{was a mixture of}} the [...] "grittyness" [...] of le Carré's works and James Bond-like fantasies. While writing the series, the writer introduced a set of [...] "MI5 terminology", terms used by the main characters in the series. According to Oyelowo, Wolstencroft's scripts included more spy terms, stating [...] "we curse David Wolstencroft often. His dialogue tends to be the most chewy," [...] and the actors had to learn <b>them</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> spoke as such on a daily basis. Brenton, meanwhile, adopted the same writing style based on early episodes of Taggart, a Scottish-based crime drama; the writer was impressed by the show's ability to add more to the plot halfway through. He also took inspirations from novels including le Carré's Tinker, Tailor, soldier, Spy. Mirren wrote [...] "One Last Dance", which he felt was difficult to write as he had to tie two main storylines together. Brenton and Wolstencroft collaborated to write [...] "Lesser of Two Evils" [...] due to timing constraints. Wolstencroft pitched the story, and then each writer wrote 30 pages of dialogue.|$|E
500|$|After Pitman's capture, he was {{marched to}} Richmond {{in a weak}} {{physical}} state. He was imprisoned in the Confederate Libby Prison and Belle Isle, which were notoriously harsh prisons. Pitman's letters home described his place of incarceration as the [...] "Pen" [...] where [...] "the filthy meat [...] thrown to <b>them</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were dogs". The condition of his incarceration including the shortage of food, lack of sanitation, overcrowding and his physical weakness made him susceptible to virulent diseases present in the Confederate prisons. Carter described how the prisons [...] "wore out the brave spirit". During a prisoner exchange, Pitman was released by the Confederate Army at City Point, Virginia, on December12, 1862, and then sent to Camp Parole, Annapolis. Suffering from complications due to the conditions of his imprisonment, he contracted [...] "lung fever", which was perhaps pneumonia. Carter wrote later how his friend had [...] "linger feebly a few weeks, like the flickering of an expiring flame, then quietly pass away to an eternal life". Pitman died at Camp Parole on February27, 1863, just weeks short of his eighteenth birthday. According to historians Anita Manning and Justin Vance, Pitman [...] "has the unfortunate {{distinction of being the}} only known Hawaiian or Pacific Islander to die as a prisoner of war in the Civil War".|$|E
500|$|Twitterbots {{are capable}} of {{influencing}} public opinion about culture, products and political agendas by automatically generating mass amounts of tweets through imitating human communication. The New York Times states, [...] "They have sleep-wake cycles so their fakery is more convincing, making them less prone to repetitive patterns that flag them as mere programs." [...] The tweets generated vary anywhere from a simple automated response to content creation and information sharing, all of which depends on {{the intention of the}} person purchasing or creating the bot. The social implications these Twitterbots potentially have on human perception are sizeable according to a study published by the ScienceDirect Journal. Looking at the Computers as Social Actors (CASA) paradigm, the journal notes, [...] "people exhibit remarkable social reactions to computers and other media, treating <b>them</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were real people or real places." [...] The study concluded that Twitterbots were viewed as credible and competent in communication and interaction making them suitable for transmitting information in the social media sphere. While the technological advances have enabled the ability of successful Human-Computer Interaction, the implications are questioned due to the appearance of both benign and malicious bots in the Twitter realm. Benign Twitterbots may generate creative content and relevant product updates whereas malicious bots can make unpopular people seem popular, push irrelevant products on users and spread misinformation, spam and/or slander.|$|E

500|$|Continuing their {{practice}} from previous seasons, Parker and Stone wrote and produced each episode within {{the week before}} its broadcast date, although as in previous seasons, only Parker was listed as writer in the end credits. The duo conceived a list of episode ideas {{at the start of}} the season, but said they preferred to wait until the last minute to start working. Deadline pressure, they explained, energized <b>them</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were doing a live show. Stone said of the practice, [...] "We kind of need that [...] to work. We're, like, 'We have to do something right now. It's going on the air in just a few minutes.'" [...] For example, three days before the broadcast of the season premiere, [...] "The Ring", the script was only half-finished and the animation was incomplete. Likewise, they did not start work on [...] "Whale Whores" [...] until five days before the episode aired, and the scripts for [...] "Margaritaville" [...] and [...] "Pee" [...] were both still being finished the day before the episodes were first broadcast. Parker and Stone said [...] "Dead Celebrities" [...] was a particularly challenging episode to make—they were up all night working on it the day before it aired, and did not finish until 11a.m. on its broadcast date. Some critics have said that this short turnaround process helps South Park stay fresh and allows the show to address current events in a timely fashion.|$|E
500|$|The three lead {{characters}} do {{not have}} last names because [...] "they are not normal people". Romanek believed that the three main characters act with great dignity. He noted {{that they are not}} materialistic or looking for power, but just desire to acknowledge their love for each other and stay close in their friendship. An example he mentioned was how Ruth tries to seek redemption by attempting to set right a big mistake she had made. What he found the most moving aspect of the film was the [...] "graceful place of acceptance that Kathy comes to at the end". Child actors Isobel Meikle-Small, Ella Purnell, and Charlie Rowe play the younger versions of Never Let Me Gos three lead actors. Hawkins, who co-starred with Mulligan in An Education, had a supporting role as Miss Lucy, who is a teacher at an isolated English boarding school where the students slowly become {{aware of the fact that}} they are feared by people in the outside world. Charlotte Rampling portrays Miss Emily, a schoolmaster who presides over the orphanage at Hailsham. Richard was cast as an administrator, who is known as Madame. The character has been conducting an ongoing project that aims to analyse the students’ characters and psychologies, which has been compared to treating <b>them</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were subjects in an experiment.

While he shows little interest in baseball to outsiders, he has practiced daily at the Tsukishima Batting Center in the [...] cage and above since {{he was old enough}} to swing a bat. Ko is described by several other characters, including Ichiyo, Yuhei Azuma, and Junpei Azuma, as very like Aoba. In particular, they say the two are both very competitive, and Junpei attributes their frequent squabbling to their similarities. After a sandlot game against Aoba's team in elementary school, Ko is inspired by her pitching form to become a pitcher himself, and at Wakaba's urging secretly adopts Aoba's daily training regimen. Although he does not play baseball in junior high school, Akaishi and Nakanishi convince him to join the high school baseball team. With his changeup pitches, control, and incredible fastball, he becomes the ace pitcher in Seishu High School, as well as a strong hitter. Ko describes himself as having no self-confidence and an excellent liar. Despite being at odds with one another, Ko and Aoba share a deep bond through their love for Wakaba. Ko takes to heart what Aoba has to say and values her opinion more than others.|$|E
