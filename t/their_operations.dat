Until then Axis aircraft could fly inland almost at will as long as they remained at low altitude.

This changed during Rösselsprung as Allied fighter-bombers went low en-masse {{for the first time}}, establishing full aerial superiority. Consequently, both the ZNDH and Luftwaffe were forced to limit <b>their</b> <b>operations</b> in clear weather to early morning and late afternoon hours.|$|E
