5|$|The author {{contrasts}} Regents of the University of California v. Bakke {{with the}} Supreme Court's 1971 decision in Griggs v. Duke Power Co., which ruled that employers {{did not have}} to willfully discriminate against employees to violate <b>Title</b> <b>VII</b> of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Chief Justice Warren E. Burger wrote that certain standardized tests given by employers could be discriminatory, even if that was not the employer's intent. Another case discussed by Heins is the 1980 Supreme Court decision in Fullilove v. Klutznick, wherein the court ruled constitutional a federal law requiring a percentage of funds for a building project to be used for minority workers.|$|E
5|$|The tunnel {{construction}} became unintentionally {{involved in}} the women's rights movement when Janet Bonnema was accepted for an engineering technician position {{in the construction of}} the Straight Creek Tunnel in 1970. Bonnema was restricted from entering the tunnel itself, however, due to the miners' superstition that women who entered underground mines and tunnels would bring bad luck. In 1972 Bonnema filed a $100,000 class action suit against the Colorado Department of Transportation, citing <b>Title</b> <b>VII</b> of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. As Colorado voters had passed the Equal Rights Amendment that year, the state settled Bonnema's case out of court for $6,730. Bonnema entered the tunnel for the first time on November 9, 1972, prompting 66 workers to temporarily walk off the job; most returned the next day. She continued with the project until the tunnel opened.|$|E

40|$|Plaintiffs {{and their}} {{attorneys}} have an increasingly viable argument that <b>Title</b> <b>VII’s</b> definition of “sex” includes sexual orientation and gender identity, expanding employers’ potential liability. This {{is based in}} part on the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s (EEOC) firm position that both sexual orientation and gender identity are protected under the statute...|$|R
40|$|The fiftieth {{anniversary of}} <b>Title</b> <b>VII’s</b> ban on sex {{discrimination}} provides an occasion {{to reflect on}} its successes and failures in achieving workplace sex equality. Although considerable progress has occurred, advances have been both uneven and unsteady. This Article shows that a primary limit on legal reform has been attitudinal. Before and after <b>Title</b> <b>VII’s</b> enactment, private and public officials have defended sex discrimi-nation and inequality by appealing to naturalized conceptions of sex difference. Persistent stereotypes portray women as more devoted to family roles than work roles and, consequently, less committed to their jobs than men. Similar stereotypes portray women as primarily interested in female-typed jobs said to reward feminine traits and values. Viewed {{through the lens of}} such assumptions, sex-based disparities in employ-ment are not inequalities: They are the inevitable expression of innate and cultural sex differences...|$|R
25|$|Title VII’s anti-retaliation {{provision}} forbids employer {{actions that}} “discriminate against” an employee (or job applicant) {{because he has}} “opposed” a practice that <b>Title</b> <b>VII</b> forbids or has “made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in” a <b>Title</b> <b>VII</b> “investigation, proceeding, or hearing.” (a).|$|E
25|$|<b>Title</b> <b>VII</b> of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is {{a federal}} law that prohibits {{employers}} from discriminating against employees {{on the basis of}} sex, race, color, national origin, and religion. It generally applies to employers with fifteen or more employees, including federal, state, and local governments. <b>Title</b> <b>VII</b> also applies to private and public colleges and universities, employment agencies, and labor organizations.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, the EEOC and some federal courts began holding that sexual {{harassment}} is also prohibited under the Act. In 1986, the Supreme Court held in Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson, , that {{sexual harassment is}} sex discrimination and is prohibited by <b>Title</b> <b>VII.</b> Same-sex sexual harassment has also been held in a unanimous decision written by Justice Scalia to be prohibited by <b>Title</b> <b>VII</b> (Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc., , 118 S.Ct. 998).|$|E
5000|$|In Kirkland v. New York State Department of Correctional Services, 711 F.2d 1117 (2d Cir. 1983), the Second Circuit {{affirmed the}} {{district}} court's {{approval of a}} settlement that determined promotional order based partly on exam results and partly on race-normed adjustments to the exam, after minority employees made a prima facie showing that the test had an adverse impact on minorities. The Court of Appeals noted that [...] "voluntary compliance is a preferred means of achieving <b>Title</b> <b>VII's</b> goal of eliminating employment discrimination," [...] id. at 1128, and that requiring a full hearing on the test's job-validity before approving a settlement [...] "would seriously undermine <b>Title</b> <b>VII's</b> preference for voluntary compliance and is not warranted," [...] id. at 1130. Thus, [...] "a showing of a prima facie case of employment discrimination through a statistical demonstration of disproportionate racial impact constitutes a sufficiently serious claim of discrimination {{to serve as a}} predicate for a voluntary compromise containing race-conscious remedies." [...] Id. at 1130.|$|R
50|$|Arbaugh petitioned for certiorari to the U.S. Supreme Court, which granted {{review of}} the {{decision}} to resolve conflicting opinions among the Courts of Appeals on the question whether <b>Title</b> <b>VII's</b> employee-numerosity requirement was jurisdictional or simply an element of a plaintiff's claim for relief. The U.S. Solicitor General was granted permission to participate in oral argument as amicus curiae, to argue in support of Arbaugh's legal interpretation.|$|R

25|$|In the United States, racial {{profiling}} of minorities by law-enforcement officials {{has been called}} racial discrimination. Within {{the criminal justice system}} in the United States, minorities are convicted and imprisoned disproportionately when compared to the majority. As early as 1866, the Civil Rights Act and Civil Rights Act of 1871 provided a remedy for intentional racism in employment by private employers and state and local public employers. The Civil Rights Act of 1991 expanded the damages available in <b>Title</b> <b>VII</b> cases and granted <b>Title</b> <b>VII</b> plaintiffs the right to a jury trial.|$|E
25|$|Among other things, {{the suit}} alleged that, by {{discarding}} the test results, the City and the named officials discriminated against the plaintiffs {{based on their}} race, in violation of both <b>Title</b> <b>VII</b> of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 253, as amended, 42 U. S. C. §2000e et seq., and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The City and the officials defended their actions, arguing {{that if they had}} certified the results, they could have faced liability under <b>Title</b> <b>VII</b> for adopting a practice that had a disparate impact on the minority firefighters.|$|E
5000|$|Justice Ginsburg {{wrote an}} opinion concurring in the judgment, joined by Justice Sotomayor, objecting to an analogy {{made in the}} opinion that {{compared}} the [...] "results from" [...] language in drug statutes to similar language found in <b>Title</b> <b>VII’s</b> anti-retaliation provision. Citing her dissent in University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center v. Nassar, , she argued that the Court’s interpretation of similar language (in that case, “because of”) lacked sensitivity to real-life concerns.|$|R
5000|$|Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, , was a {{decision}} of the Supreme Court of the United States. The case arose out of a suit for sex discrimination by a male oil-rig worker, who claimed that he was repeatedly subjected to sexual harassment by his male co-workers with the acquiescence of his employer. The Court held that <b>Title</b> <b>VII's</b> protection against workplace discrimination [...] "because of... sex" [...] applied to harassment in the workplace between {{members of the same}} sex.|$|R
50|$|The Court {{determined}} that <b>Title</b> <b>VII's</b> mixed motive discrimination {{did not apply}} to retaliation claims, and therefore Gross v. FBL Financial Services, Inc. was instructive. The Court opined that the placement of the mixed-motive test in the status-based discrimination section and not the retaliation section indicated Congress' intent to exclude retaliation claims from that standard. The Court then turned to the text of the retaliation provision and found it similar to the ADEA provision addressed in Gross v. FBL Financial Services, Inc.|$|R
25|$|Crawford v. Metropolitan Government of Nashville, , is a United States Supreme Court case {{in which}} the Court {{unanimously}} ruled that <b>Title</b> <b>VII</b> of the 1964 Civil Rights Act protects an employee who opposes unlawful sexual harassment, but does not report the harassment him or herself.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, the EEOC {{ruled that}} {{employment}} {{discrimination on the}} basis of gender identity or transgender status is prohibited under <b>Title</b> <b>VII.</b> The decision held that {{discrimination on the basis}} of gender identity qualified as {{discrimination on the basis of}} sex whether the discrimination was due to sex stereotyping, discomfort with the fact of an individual's transition, or discrimination due to a perceived change in the individual's sex. In 2014, the EEOC initiated two lawsuits against private companies for discrimination on the basis of gender identity, with additional litigation under consideration. As of November 2014, Commissioner Chai Feldblum is making an active effort to increase awareness of <b>Title</b> <b>VII</b> remedies for individuals discriminated on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity.|$|E

5000|$|They first {{introduced}} the term [...] "but-for causation" [...] {{to describe what}} Price Waterhouse suggests should be the burden of proof, but rejected its validity as {{an interpretation of the}} phrase [...] "because of" [...] in <b>Title</b> <b>VII's</b> section on prohibited actions. They reasoned that the two are separate because Congress, in writing the provision, did not write [...] "solely because of", and so, a process that only involved some small amount of discrimination would still be prohibited by the statute.|$|R
40|$|In {{a recent}} adjudication, the EEOC {{concluded}} that discrimination against a transgendered individual is sex discrimination. To many readers, this conclusion may seem obvious, but in fact, most courts that {{have considered the}} anti-discrimination rights of transgendered employees have taken a narrower approach. [...] . As I will argue in this column, the EEOC has the better of the argument. Its ruling takes an honest, straightforward look at the nature of transgender discrimination and the natural scope of <b>Title</b> <b>VII’s</b> broad prohibition of sex discrimination in employment...|$|R

Federal contractors are prohibited by executive order from engaging in sexual orientation and gender identity discrimination.

In December 2004, the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit continued this ignoble cultural pastime when they decided Everson v. Michigan Department of Corrections. In this decision, the Everson Court accepted the Michigan Department of Correction's claim that “the very manhood” of male prison guards both threatens the safety of female inmates and violates the women's “special sense of privacy in their genitals” and declared that sex-specific employment policies for prison guards is not impermissibly discriminatory.

Given the [...] "unfairness" [...] and [...] "waste of judicial resources," [...] entailed in tying the employee-numerosity requirement to subject-matter jurisdiction, the Court considered it [...] "the sounder course" [...] to refrain from construing the requirement as jurisdictional.
