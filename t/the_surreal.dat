5|$|There {{are also}} proper classes with field structure, which are {{sometimes}} called Fields, {{with a capital}} F. <b>The</b> <b>surreal</b> numbers form a Field containing the reals, and would be a field {{except for the fact}} that they are a proper class, not a set.

5|$|Combinatorial {{game theory}} {{provides}} alternative reals as well, with infinite Blue-Red Hackenbush as one particularly relevant example. In 1974, Elwyn Berlekamp described a correspondence between Hackenbush strings and binary expansions of real numbers, {{motivated by the}} idea of data compression. For example, the value of the Hackenbush string LRRLRLRL... is 0.0101012...=. However, the value of LRLLL... (corresponding to 0.111...2) is infinitesimally less than 1. The difference between the two is <b>the</b> <b>surreal</b> number , where ω is the first infinite ordinal; the relevant game is LRRRR... or 0.000...2. follows directly from Berlekamp's Rule.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, Fey {{appeared}} in <b>the</b> <b>surreal</b> comedy Martin & Orloff. She made her debut as writer and co-star of the 2004 teen comedy Mean Girls. Characters and {{behaviors in the}} movie are based on Fey's high school life at Upper Darby High School and on the non-fiction book Queen Bees and Wannabes by Rosalind Wiseman. The cast includes other past cast members of SNL including Tim Meadows, Ana Gasteyer, and Amy Poehler. The film received favorable reviews, and was a box office success, grossing US$129million worldwide.|$|E
2500|$|In another {{approach}} to <b>the</b> <b>surreals,</b> given by Alling, [...] explicit construction is bypassed altogether.

5|$|In bold colors Geisel {{illustrated}} <b>the</b> <b>surreal</b> {{scenery and}} strange {{human and animal}} characters of the book with the strong, loose, energetic line that remained familiar in his later works. Ruth MacDonald saw Geisel's drawing style as fully formed in Mulberry Street, arguing that only his page design improved in later books, better keeping children's attention without confusing them. Philip Nel found the artwork in Geisel's later books {{to have a greater}} energy and looseness than in Mulberry Street or his earlier cartooning. Nel felt Geisel began loosening up toward his classic style as early as Horton Hatches the Egg (1940) and reached fruition with 1950's If I Ran the Zoo (1950).|$|E
5|$|Robin Pierson of The TV Critic {{gave the}} episode a mixed review, rating the episode a 67/100, calling {{it one of}} the most densely packed pilots on television. He {{mentioned}} that it was entertaining but said that there were many jokes that followed the quality does not win out over quantity saying. He compared Peter to Homer Simpson and he compared the show to The Simpsons and King of the Hill. He criticized the amount of unfunny jokes while he praised <b>the</b> <b>surreal</b> moments. At the end of his review he stated that Family Guy was a different kind of animated comedy which set out to do jokes that other cartoons couldn’t do, also mentioning that the show had promise to become really funny.|$|E
5|$|The {{story of}} Secret of Evermore {{begins with a}} black and white {{flashback}} to 1965, in a small town called Podunk, USA. In a laboratory situated on the roof of a mansion, a malfunction occurs which floods the area with white flash of light. Thirty years later, the game's young protagonist is leaving a theater when his pet dog chases after a cat in the street. The boy hurriedly follows after him, eventually reaching a large, abandoned mansion. He discovers the hidden laboratory with a large machine built in the center. When the dog begins to chew on some wires, the pair find themselves transported to <b>the</b> <b>surreal</b> world of Evermore, beginning in the space station Omnitopia. A butler dressed in a white tuxedo greets the boy when he appears, only to lock him in a room with several attack robots. The boy manages to escape in a shuttle pod, where he finds his dog holed up in the cockpit.|$|E

5000|$|Every {{surreal number}} is a game, {{but not all}} games are <b>surreal</b> numbers, e.g. <b>the</b> game { 0 [...] is not a <b>surreal</b> number. <b>The</b> class of games is more general than <b>the</b> <b>surreals,</b> and has a simpler definition, but lacks some of the nicer {{properties}} of <b>surreal</b> numbers. <b>The</b> class of <b>surreal</b> numbers forms a field, but the class of games does not. <b>The</b> <b>surreals</b> have a total order: given any two surreals, they are either equal, or one {{is greater than the}} other. The games have only a partial order: there exist pairs of games that are neither equal, greater than, nor less than each other. Each surreal number is either positive, negative, or zero. Each game is either positive, negative, zero, or fuzzy (incomparable with zero, such as {1|−1}).|$|R
5|$|When Nolan's family {{relocated}} to Chicago during his formative years, he started making films with Adrien and Roko Belic. He has continued his {{collaboration with the}} brothers, receiving a credit for his editorial assistance on their Oscar-nominated documentary Genghis Blues (1999). Nolan also worked alongside Roko (and future Pulitzer Prize winner Jeffrey Gettleman) on documenting a safari across four African countries, organized by the late photojournalist Dan Eldon in the early 1990s. Nolan was educated at Haileybury and Imperial Service College, an independent school in Hertford Heath, Hertfordshire, and later read English literature at University College London (UCL). He chose UCL specifically for its filmmaking facilities, which comprised a Steenbeck editing suite and 16mm film cameras. Nolan {{was president of the}} Union's Film Society, and with Emma Thomas (his girlfriend and future wife) he screened 35 mm feature films during the school year and used the money earned to produce 16 mm films over the summers. During his college years, Nolan made two short films. The first was <b>the</b> <b>surreal</b> 8 mm Tarantella (1989), which was shown on Image Union (an independent film and video showcase on the Public Broadcasting Service). The second was Larceny (1995), filmed over a weekend in black and white with a limited cast, crew, and equipment. Funded by Nolan and shot with the society's equipment, it appeared at the Cambridge Film Festival in 1996 and is considered one of UCL's best shorts.|$|E
25|$|Looked at in this manner, <b>the</b> <b>surreal</b> numbers {{resemble}} a power series field, {{except that the}} decreasing sequences of exponents must be bounded in length by an ordinal and {{are not allowed to}} be as long as the class of ordinals.

2500|$|Every {{surreal number}} is a game, {{but not all}} games are <b>surreal</b> numbers, e.g. <b>the</b> game [...] 0 } is not a <b>surreal</b> number.

2500|$|However, it {{is always}} {{possible}} to construct a surreal number that is greater than any {{member of a set}} (by including the set {{on the left side of}} the constructor) and thus <b>the</b> collection of <b>surreal</b> numbers is a proper class.

25|$|In {{contrast}} to the real numbers, a (proper) subset of <b>the</b> <b>surreal</b> numbers {{does not have a}} least upper (or lower) bound unless it has a maximal (minimal) element. Conway defines a gap as {L | R}, L < R, L ∪ R = 𝐍𝐨; this is not a number because {{at least one of the}} sides is a proper class. Gaps can also be thought of as the equivalent of Dedekind sections, and the Dedekind completion 𝐍𝐨𝕯 of <b>the</b> <b>surreal</b> numbers with the natural ordering is a (proper class-sized) linear continuum.|$|E
25|$|Ordered fields {{extending}} the reals are the hyperreal numbers and <b>the</b> <b>surreal</b> numbers; {{both of them}} contain infinitesimal and infinitely large numbers and are therefore non-Archimedean ordered fields.|$|E
25|$|The numeric {{forms are}} placed in {{equivalence}} classes; each such equivalence class is a surreal number. The elements of {{the left and right}} set of a form are drawn from the universe of <b>the</b> <b>surreal</b> numbers (not of forms, but of their equivalence classes).|$|E
50|$|After an {{infinite}} number of stages, infinite subsets become available, so that any real number a can be represented by { La | Ra },where La is the set of all dyadic rationals less than a and Ra is the set of all dyadic rationals greater than a (reminiscent of a Dedekind cut). Thus the real numbers are also embedded within <b>the</b> <b>surreals.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In On Numbers and Games, {{the classic}} {{exposition}} on surreal numbers, John Horton Conway provided {{a number of}} examples of concepts that had natural extensions from the ordinals to <b>the</b> <b>surreals.</b> One such function is the -map this mapping generalises naturally to include all surreal numbers in its domain, which in turn provides a natural generalisation of the Cantor normal form for surreal numbers.|$|R

25|$|One {{advantage}} of this alternative realization is that equality is identity, not an inductively defined relation. Unlike Conway's realization of <b>the</b> <b>surreal</b> numbers, however, the sign-expansion requires a prior construction of the ordinals, while in Conway's realization, the ordinals are constructed as particular cases of surreals.|$|E

25|$|Non-standard analysis, {{introduced}} by Abraham Robinson, rehabilitated the infinitesimal approach to calculus, which {{had fallen into}} disrepute in favour {{of the theory of}} limits, by extending the field of real numbers to the Hyperreal numbers which include infinitesimal and infinite quantities.
