[...] Ornais's owner, Andy Stewart, later said: [...] "We're still grieving but I think this whole hyped up situation regarding the Grand National is totally wrong... National Hunt racing is safer and compliant with every single sport that goes along. My son snowboarded in France and, unfortunately, he had an accident and he'll never walk again.

500|$|The {{episode was}} mostly well-received, with a {{retrospective}} {{of the first}} season in [...] Entertainment Weekly rating it a B+, describing it as [...] "A very cool-looking episode <b>that</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> best job so far of illuminating the agents' position with relation to the government [...] "; also noting the character of Max Fenig as a precursor to those of The Lone Gunmen. Keith Phipps, writing for The A.V. Club, also rated the episode a B+, calling it [...] "a strong entry", finding that it served as a [...] "slow reveal" [...] of the series' [...] themes. Phipps also noted the importance of Max Fenig {{as a sign of}} [...] "the human toll exacted by all the dark goings on" [...] in the series, claiming that [...] "without Max we just get Mulder and Scully chasing a mysterious downed object and coming up empty-handed. With Max, we start to realize the stakes for which they're playing". Matt Haigh, writing for Den of Geek, reviewed the episode negatively, calling it [...] "a mundane forty minutes" [...] that [...] "really fails to impress", and noting that the plot follows [...] "more or less the same pattern", as the series' previous mythology episodes. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode three stars out of five. Shearman described [...] "Fallen Angel" [...] as having been produced [...] "with style and wit", feeling that it featured a relatively static plot but was nevertheless entertaining. He found Duchovny's performance in the episode, and its final scene featuring Deep Throat's ambiguous motivations, to have been the highlights of an episode otherwise filled with [...] "smoke and mirrors"; comparing it to the earlier episode [...] "Conduit" [...] in this regard.|$|E
500|$|During {{the casting}} process, Keamy was {{described}} as a military type in his late-twenties who does not question orders. [...] Chris Carabott of IGN wrote that [...] "in a show that features characters fraught with uncertainty, Keamy is the polar opposite and his Marine mentality definitely sets him apart. [...] His team has a physical advantage {{and with the help of}} Mr. Widmore, they have a tactical advantage as well. [...] Keamy is like a bulldog being thrown into a cage full of kittens (except for [...] Sayid)". [...] Jay Glatfelter of The Huffington Post, stated that [...] "Keamy is Crazy! … out of all the bad guys on the Island—past, present, and future—Keamy has to be one of the most dangerous ones. [...] Not because of how big he is, or the weaponry, but his willingness to kill at the drop of a hat. [...] That doesn't bode well for our Losties [...]" [...] Co-show runner/executive producer/writer Carlton Cuse has stated that he and the other writers create [...] "complex" [...] characters because they [...] "are interested in exploring how good and evil can be embodied in the same characters and [...] the struggles we all have to overcome the dark parts of our souls"; however, he later clarified that there is an exception: [...] "Keamy's bad, he knows he's bad, but he's ... a guy <b>that</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> job." [...] Damon Lindelof stated that [...] "the great thing about Keamy is that he is like a ... merciless survivor. [...] 's this great moment [...] where he just sort of hackie-sacks [...] over to where [...] Omar is standing. [...] Omar is certainly an acceptable casualty as far as Keamy is concerned." [...] According to a featurette in the Lost: The Complete Fourth Season – The Expanded Experience DVD set, Keamy likes [...] "heavy weaponry" [...] and [...] "physical fitness" [...] and dislikes [...] "negotiations" [...] and [...] "doctors".|$|E

2500|$|Although Haskell defines monads {{in terms}} of the return and bind functions, it is also {{possible}} to define a monad {{in terms of}} return and two other operations, join and fmap. This formulation fits more closely with the original definition of monads in category theory. The fmap operation, with type (t→u) → Mnbsp&t→Mnbsp&u, takes a function between two types and produces a function <b>that</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> [...] "same thing" [...] to values in the monad.

2500|$|GameSpy's Will Tuttle and Sal Accardo also {{praised the}} {{graphics}} and online mode, but they too criticized the single player campaign. [...] "Historical Campaign [...] gets very confusing because you frequently switch sides from battle to battle", stated Tuttle. He added that {{it felt like}} the game's campaign was [...] "tacked on to allow people without PS2 online to have fun." [...] 1UP.com's Andrew Pfister followed suit, also praising the graphics. [...] "Visually, Battlefront is exceptional. Never before have the Star Wars battles been so well recreated and detailed". He criticized the game's AI, however. He felt that it was too easy to defeat them, and that they often did not follow commands issued by the player. As with other reviewers, Pfister felt the single player mode was the weak point of the game, citing the PlayStation 2 version specifically for players without online access. Overall, he felt the problems with the game were outweighed by its qualities. [...] "Battlefront manages to stand tall as a great game <b>that</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> best job we've yet seen of playing out the battles of the Star Wars movies." ...|$|E
