5|$|One day at Emain Macha, Cú Chulainn overhears Cathbad {{teaching}} his pupils. One {{asks him}} what that day is auspicious for, and Cathbad replies that any warrior who takes arms that day will have everlasting fame. Cú Chulainn, though only seven years old, goes to Conchobar {{and asks for}} arms. None of the weapons given to him withstand his strength, until Conchobar gives him his own weapons. But when Cathbad sees this he grieves, because he had not finished his prophecy—the warrior who took arms that day would be famous, but his life would be short. Soon afterwards, {{in response to a}} similar prophecy by Cathbad, Cú Chulainn demands a chariot from Conchobar, and only the king's own chariot withstands him. He sets off on a foray and kills the three sons of Nechtan Scéne, who had boasted they had killed more Ulstermen than there were Ulstermen still living. He returns to Emain Macha in his battle frenzy, and the Ulstermen are afraid he will slaughter them all. Conchobar's wife Mugain leads out the women of Emain, and they bare their breasts to him. He averts his eyes, and the Ulstermen wrestle him into a barrel of cold water, which explodes from the heat of his body. <b>They</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> a second barrel, which boils, and a third, which warms to a pleasant temperature.|$|E
500|$|He {{joined the}} AAA Columbus Clippers for their playoffs. Kipnis batted [...]455 in five games, and hit for the cycle on September 17 in the Clippers’ victory that {{clinched}} the International League title. His big game was voted {{second in the}} 2010 Fans Choice [...] "Best Game" [...] Minor League Baseball Yearly Awards. Veteran catcher Luke Carlin said: They bring up Kipnis from Akron, {{and we look at}} this little guy and say, 'Where did he come from, and what is he doing here?' We were teasing him, and all he does is go out and hit about a million. I mean, here's this little infielder and <b>they</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> the fifth spot ... What's that about? He goes out and hits for the cycle.|$|E
500|$|There was {{discussion}} among {{the producers of}} the series regarding whether Bertram {{should be included in}} the storyline, as he had not appeared in any episodes for several years. An un-used scene was intended for broadcasting which showed Stewie, while trying to find Waldo in an Abercrombie & Fitch catalog, saying to Brian [...] "Oh, turn to the next page. I bet <b>they</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> someone's utility pocket", but it was never used as it was not deemed funny enough for the episode. Originally, Peter singing [...] "Milkshake" [...] to inmates at a prison was going to be naked and push his nipples from underneath, but broadcasting standards objected; as a result, the show broadcast Peter wearing underpants and pushing his nipples from the side. When Peter and Lois are in the restaurant and Peter leaves to [...] "warn the chef of Lois' arrival", Lois was intended to say [...] "If he won't put something in me, I will", but the gag was never broadcast.|$|E
60|$|<b>They</b> had <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> {{the best}} bed in Mrs. Savor's little guest-room, and when Annie entered, the {{minister}} was apologising {{to her for}} spoiling it.|$|R
50|$|Wednesday, July 7: Julie {{convinced}} her father that Tom was ill and needed their help so <b>they</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> up <b>in</b> {{the guest room}} for the night after he had collapsed from fatigue.|$|R
6000|$|... 'My uncle {{went out}} to see, and reports that <b>they</b> have <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> prison. As yet no harm has been done him. The palace has been sacked; nothing but the bare walls remain.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why don't <b>they</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> {{the cells}} till the morning?' said the colonel testily. 'See if they've damaged him, sergeant.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why don't <b>they</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> {{the cells}} till the morning?" [...] said the colonel testily. [...] "See if they've damaged him, sergeant." ...|$|E
60|$|Jake {{gave them}} some trouble, but <b>they</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> a re-made bed {{and went back}} to the verandah, where Bethune sat down.|$|E
50|$|Ryan {{initially}} {{expressed concerns}} whether Khan could expect the Afghan authorities to free him, {{upon his return}}, or whether <b>they</b> would <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> the Afghan prison system., but Khan did not ultimately face arrest upon his return to Afghanistan.|$|R
6000|$|... "Both of them, Dowley. In {{that day}} a man {{will be his}} own {{property}}, not the property of magistrate and master. And he can leave town whenever he wants to, if the wages don't suit him!--and <b>they</b> can't <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> the pillory for it." ...|$|R
60|$|In {{a moment}} more Mr. Henshaw reappeared, with the {{information}} that since Lowell had objected so strongly to the coal locker <b>they</b> had <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> the oil closet (the rankest place on board), and now there were two lockers for the two remaining prisoners.|$|R
6000|$|<b>They</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> lead when he {{was dead}} [...] And {{shrouded}} up so neat, And they the leaden coffin weigh [...] Lest the Plumber should be a cheat.|$|E
6000|$|... "Down the Jersey {{coast and}} back. They {{said they thought}} a little ocean air would do the crazy man good before <b>they</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> the sanitarium. I own up that I was suspicious, but they claimed {{everything}} was straight." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{drank too}} much cider, and it got into his head, and <b>they</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> Weatherbury stocks for it. Father was obliged to get {{somebody}} else {{for a day or}} two, and Enoch hasn't {{had anything to do with}} the woods since." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm dreadfully worried over Gran'pa Jim," [...] said she, [...] "for those terrible {{agents of}} the Secret Service seem bent on {{catching}} him. And he doesn't wish to be caught. If they arrested him, do you think <b>they</b> would <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> jail, Aunt Hannah?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, sir,' rejoined Mr. Weller. 'Wotever is, is right, as {{the young}} nobleman sweetly remarked wen <b>they</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> down <b>in</b> the pension list 'cos his mother's uncle's vife's {{grandfather}} vunce lit the king's pipe vith a portable tinder-box.' 'Not a bad notion that, Sam,' said Mr. Bob Sawyer approvingly.|$|R
50|$|Rabbids:The Rabbids are the antagonists of {{the game}} and have {{captured}} Rayman. <b>They</b> have <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> a gladiator-styled arena where he must take part in all their challenges in order {{to face up to the}} Rabble Droid. They are completely insane and would do literally anything to stop Rayman.|$|R
60|$|When {{they got}} on board the {{schooner}} the sails were going up and nobody else was hit. Marston and Rupert carried Wyndham to the cabin and Marston remembered his horror when <b>they</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> his berth. A glancing bullet, turning over endways, had mangled {{the lower part of}} his face.|$|E
60|$|<b>They</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> his easy-chair, and wheeled it {{near the}} window; then, {{swinging}} open the door, exposed {{him to the}} free current of morning air. But not all the air that is, nor all the winds that ever blew 'twixt Heaven and Earth, could have brought new life to him.|$|E
6000|$|If I {{had been}} a Heathen, [...] I'd have piled my pyre on high, [...] And in a great red {{whirlwind}} [...] Gone roaring to the sky; [...] But Higgins is a Heathen, [...] And a richer man than I; [...] And <b>they</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> an oven, [...] Just {{as if he were}} a pie.|$|E
50|$|Abdullah {{was offered}} {{football}} scholarships from several schools, but schools such as Alabama and Auburn {{wanted him to}} play cornerback, while {{he wanted to be}} a running back. Nebraska coach Bo Pelini, however, while making no guarantees, told <b>him</b> that <b>they</b> would <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> a position that would maximize his talent. Pelini's view was the critical factor in choosing Nebraska.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I do mean it. Though the juries and {{the judges}} {{should say that}} he was not my husband, though all the judges in England should say it, I would not believe them. <b>They</b> may <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> prison and so divide us; but they never shall divide my bone from his bone, and my flesh from his flesh. As you are ashamed of me, I had better go back to-morrow.' ...|$|R
5000|$|He co-starred with Jack Warner in {{a thriller}} {{directed}} by Lewis Gilbert, Emergency Call (1952). Rank tried Steel in a comedy, Something Money Can't Buy (1952), with Patricia Roc {{but the public}} response was not enthusiastic. <b>They</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> back <b>in</b> uniform in The Planter's Wife (1952), set during the Malayan Emergency. It was the sixth most popular film of 1952 in Britain, although Steel's part was a relatively minor one in support of Jack Hawkins and Claudette Colbert.|$|R
6000|$|... "I have to say," [...] whispered Heda, [...] "that {{for myself}} I care nothing, but that I could never bear {{to see all}} these stories about my poor father raked up. Also there is Maurice to be considered. It would be terrible if <b>they</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> prison--or worse. Let us go to Zululand, Mr. Quatermain, and {{afterwards}} get out of Africa. Don't you agree, Maurice?" ...|$|E
60|$|He {{could not}} answer such {{a piece of}} logic as that. He yielded, and began to praise the orcharded levels which now {{replaced}} the vine-purpled slopes of the upper river. He said <b>they</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> mind of orchards that he had known in his boyhood; and they, agreed that the supreme charm of travel, after all, was not in seeing something new and strange, but in finding something familiar and dear {{in the heart of}} the strangeness.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes,' said Halvor, 'he {{has only}} gone {{to break down}} a bit of spruce fir. It won't be long before he is here.' And then he asked them the way to Soria Moria Castle. <b>They</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> the right way, {{and when he came}} in front of the castle it was so full of horses and people that it swarmed with them. But Halvor was so ragged and torn with {{following}} the West Wind through bushes and bogs that he kept on one side, and would not go among the crowd until the last day, when the feast was to be held at noon.|$|E
50|$|As {{they lived}} {{near to the}} town of Killenaule in County Tipperary, both Harnett and Lawlor knew Philip Fenton well as he rode for local trainer Edward O'Grady as an amateur for many years, {{securing}} a Cheltenham Festival success for the trainer on Loving Around in the 1996 National Hunt Chase. Both told Fenton that if their son of Presenting was not sold on then <b>they</b> would <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> training at his Carrick On Suir base in the neighbouring county of Waterford.|$|R
50|$|In 1986, Moss {{felt the}} need {{to get away from the}} {{commercial}} fast track and moved to a farm in upstate New York, where he started dreaming in a language he did not know that proved to be an archaic form of the Mohawk language. Helped by native speakers to interpret his dreams, Moss came to believe that <b>they</b> had <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> touch with an ancient healer - a woman of power - and that they were calling him to a different life.|$|R
50|$|They trio {{arrive at}} the {{warehouse}} and Michael heads in alone to get his share. He meets with The Mutt and Dinny, but the two plan on betraying him. The Mutt knocks Michael out with a wrench and he and Dinny carry the unconscious Michael to The Mutt's car. As <b>they</b> are <b>putting</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> the boot, Jim approaches, armed with a pistol. He knocks both Dinny and The Mutt out while Brenda steals the entire €30,000. With Michael back in the car, the trio head out.|$|R
60|$|Cursing, and swearing, and gnawing his fingers, {{he went on}} to Swinestead Abbey, {{where the}} monks set before him {{quantities}} of pears, and peaches, and new cider--some say poison too, but there is very little reason to suppose so--of which he ate and drank in an immoderate and beastly way. All night he lay ill of a burning fever, and haunted with horrible fears. Next day, <b>they</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> a horse-litter, and carried him to Sleaford Castle, where he passed another night of pain and horror. Next day, they carried him, with greater difficulty than on the day before, to the castle of Newark upon Trent; and there, on the eighteenth of October, in the forty-ninth year of his age, and the seventeenth of his vile reign, was an end of this miserable brute.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{going to}} give you girls a bunch of lavendar apiece," [...] said Miss Lavendar brightly, as if she had not heard the answer to her question. [...] "It's very sweet, don't you think? Mother always loved it. She planted these borders long ago. Father named me Lavendar because he was so fond of it. The very first time he saw mother was when he visited her home in East Grafton with her brother. He {{fell in love with her}} at first sight; and <b>they</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> the spare room bed to sleep and the sheets were scented with lavendar and he lay awake all night and thought of her. He always loved the scent of lavendar after that [...] . and that was why he gave me the name. Don't forget to come back soon, girls dear. We'll be looking for you, Charlotta the Fourth and I." ...|$|E
6000|$|Nevertheless, Madame de Ribaumont {{was equal}} to the occasion; nothing {{could have been more}} courtly, graceful, or unembarrassed than her manner of {{receiving}} of King's gallant compliments, and of performing all the courtesies suited to the hostess and queen of the place: it was the air that would have befitted the stateliest castle hall, yet that in its simplicity and brightness still more embellished the old ruinous convent-cell. The King was delighted, he sat down upon one of the three-legged stools, took Rayonette upon his knee, undertook to finish washing the radishes, but ate nearly all he washed, declaring that <b>they</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> mind of his old hardy days on the mountains of Bearn. He insisted on hearing all Rayonette's adventure in detail; and on seeing the pearls and the silver bullet, 'You could scarcely have needed the token, sir,' said he with a smile to Berenger; 'Mademoiselle had already shown herself of the true blood of the bravest of knights.' ...|$|E
50|$|Throughout {{his career}} his abiding concern {{was for the}} comfort of his {{patients}}. He {{was a man of}} few words, but a good listener, and the stories told by his patients testify to the respect in which they held him and the trust <b>they</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "It was {{the verses}} that did it," [...] said Harry; [...] "they had {{an hour to}} do Themistocles on the hearth of Admetus, and there he beat them all to shivers. 'Twas all done smack, smooth, without a scratch, in Alcaics, and Cheviot heard Wilmot saving, 'twas no mere task, but had poetry, and {{all that sort of}} thing in it. But I don't know whether that would have done, if he had not come out so strong <b>in</b> the recitation; <b>they</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> on <b>in</b> Priam's speech to Achilles, and he said it--Oh it was too bad papa did not hear him! Every one held their breath and listened." ...|$|R
5000|$|He was {{the first}} black {{graduate}} to work at the Luansha Mines. Before independence, he lived in a little house in no man's land in the Copperbelt. They did not want to <b>put</b> <b>him</b> with the black miners in those tiny houses because he was a graduate, but <b>they</b> could not <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> a big house in the white area either because he was black.|$|R
