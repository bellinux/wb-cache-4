25|$|Verhoeven's {{first feature}} film Business Is Business was {{released}} in 1971 and was not especially well received. His first national success did not come until 1973 with <b>Turkish</b> <b>Delight,</b> starring Rutger Hauer and Monique van de Ven. This film {{is based on a}} novel by bestselling Dutch author Jan Wolkers and tells the passionate love story of an artist and a liberal young girl from a rather conservative background. The film received an Academy Award nomination for Best Foreign Language Film in 1974. In 1999 the film won a Golden Calf for Best Dutch Film of the Century. Verhoeven's 1975 film Katie Tippel again featured Hauer and van de Ven, but it would not match the success of <b>Turkish</b> <b>Delight.</b>|$|E

25|$|Verhoeven {{followed}} those successes {{with the}} equally intense and provocative Basic Instinct (1992), an erotic thriller.

25|$|After 20 {{years of}} filmmaking in the United States, Verhoeven {{returned}} to his homeland, the Netherlands, for the making of Black Book. The story was written by Verhoeven and screenwriter Gerard Soeteman, with whom he made successful films such as <b>Turkish</b> <b>Delight</b> (1973) and Soldier of Orange (1977). The two men {{had been working on}} the script for fifteen years, but they solved their story problems in the early 2000s by changing the main character from male to female. According to Verhoeven, Black Book was born out of elements that did not fit in any of his earlier movies, and it {{can be seen as a}} supplement to his earlier film about World War II Soldier of Orange.|$|E
25|$|In {{the modern}} age, Budapest {{developed}} its own peculiar cuisine, based on {{products of the}} nearby region, such as lamb, pork and vegetables special to the region. Modern Hungarian cuisine is a synthesis of ancient Asiatic components mixed with French, Germanic, Italian, and Slavic elements. The food of Hungary {{can be considered a}} melting pot of the continent, with a culinary base formed from its own, original Magyar cuisine. Considerable numbers of Saxons, Armenians, Italians, Jews and Serbs settled in the Hungarian basin and in Transylvania, also contributing with different new dishes. Elements of ancient Turkish cuisine were adopted during the Ottoman era, in the form of sweets (for example different nougats, like white nougat called törökméz, quince (birsalma), <b>Turkish</b> <b>delight,</b> Turkish coffee or rice dishes like pilaf, meat and vegetable dishes like the eggplant, used in eggplant salads and appetizers, stuffed peppers and stuffed cabbage called töltött káposzta.

500|$|One {{role that}} was not {{difficult}} to cast was Rutger Hauer as Roy Batty, the violent yet thoughtful leader of the replicants. Scott cast Hauer without having met him, based solely on Hauer's performances in Paul Verhoeven's movies Scott had seen (Katie Tippel, Soldier of Orange and <b>Turkish</b> <b>Delight).</b> Hauer's portrayal of Batty was regarded by Philip K. Dick as, [...] "the perfect Batty—cold, Aryan, flawless". Of the many films Hauer has made, Blade Runner is his favorite.

He had realised that the [...] "Queen of Narnia" [...] (as she had introduced herself) and the White Witch were one and the same after a conversation with Lucy, but was still determined to taste more <b>Turkish</b> <b>Delight</b> and remained convinced that the Witch would deliver her promise to make him heir to her throne.|$|E

2500|$|The {{original}} Dairy Milk bar ("with a {{glass and}} a half of fresh milk") was launched in 1905.

2500|$|Jelly {{beans are}} a small bean-shaped type of {{confectionery}} with a hard candy shell and a gummy interior which come {{in a wide variety}} of flavors. The confection is primarily made of sugar. The <b>Turkish</b> <b>Delight,</b> a Middle Eastern candy made of soft jelly, covered in confectioner's powder, with roots dating to biblical days, was an early precursor to the jelly bean that inspired its gummy interior. However, it is generally thought that jelly beans first surfaced in 1861 when Boston confectioner and inventor William Schrafft urged people to send his jelly beans to soldiers during the American Civil War. It wasn't until July 5, 1905, that the mentioning of jelly beans was published in the Chicago Daily News. The advertisement publicized bulk jelly beans sold by volume for nine cents per pound, according to the book, [...] "The Century in Food: America's Fads and Favorites". Today, most historians contend that in the United States, they were first linked with Easter in the 1930s.|$|E
2500|$|Without a doubt, one of {{the most}} popular dishes in Romania, and perhaps can be called the {{national}} dish is Sarmale, or Sarma in other cultures of the Balkans, and the Caucasus; a mixture of pork, beef, and lamb, or just plain pork, with onions and rice, wrapped in semi-sour cabbage or grape leaves, and then placed usually in a porcelain pot with tomato paste and pork cuts. This dish is then slow-cooked, and commonly served with cornmeal (mămăligă, which is a type of polenta). One of the most common meals is the mămăligă, a cornmeal mush, for a long time considered the [...] "poor man's meal" [...] (N-are nici o mămăligă pe masă - [...] "He hasn't even a mămăligă on the table"), but it has become very appreciated in recent times. Pork is the main meat used in Romanian cuisine, but also beef is consumed and a good lamb or fish dish is never to be refused. In conjunction with special events or periods, different recipes are prepared. During Christmas, nearly every family slaughters a pig and cooks it using a wide variety of traditional recipes like cârnaţi - a type of long sausage with meat; caltaboşi - sausages made with liver and other internal organs; piftie - a jelly made from parts like the feet, head and ears; tochitură (a kind of stew) - served along with mămăligă and wine ("so that the pork can swim"); and tobă (head cheese). The meal is sweetened with the traditional cozonac (sweet bread with nuts, poppy seeds or lokum - rahat in Romanian, known in English as <b>Turkish</b> <b>delight).</b> Lamb is traditional for Easter; the main dishes are borș de miel (lamb sour soup), roast lamb and drob - a cooked mix of offal, meat and fresh vegetables, which is quite similar to Scottish haggis, served with pască (pie made with cottage cheese) as a sweetener.|$|E
60|$|Forsytes, as is {{generally}} admitted, have shells, like that extremely useful little animal {{which is made}} into <b>Turkish</b> <b>delight,</b> in other words, they are never seen, or if seen would not be recognised, without habitats, composed of circumstance, property, acquaintances, and wives, which seem to move along with them in their passage through a world composed {{of thousands of other}} Forsytes with their habitats.

6000|$|But for the {{beautiful}} experiment of {{lying in bed}} I might never have discovered it. For years I {{have been looking for}} some blank spaces in a modern house to draw on. Paper is much too small for any really allegorical design; as Cyrano de Bergerac says, [...] "Il me faut des géants." [...] But when I tried to find these fine clear spaces in the modern rooms such as we all live in I was continually disappointed. I found an endless pattern and complication of small objects hung like a curtain of fine links between me and my desire. I examined the walls; I found them to my surprise to be already covered with wallpaper, and I found the wallpaper to be already covered with uninteresting images, all bearing a ridiculous resemblance to each other. I could not understand why one arbitrary symbol (a symbol apparently entirely devoid of any religious or philosophical significance) should thus be sprinkled all over my nice walls like a sort of small-pox. The Bible must be referring to wallpapers, I think, when it says, [...] "Use not vain repetitions, as the Gentiles do." [...] I found the Turkey carpet a mass of unmeaning colours, rather like the Turkish Empire, or like the sweetmeat called <b>Turkish</b> <b>Delight.</b> I do not exactly know what <b>Turkish</b> <b>Delight</b> really is; but I suppose it is Macedonian Massacres. Everywhere that I went forlornly, with my pencil or my paint brush, I found that others had unaccountably been before me, spoiling the walls, the curtains, and the furniture with their childish and barbaric designs.|$|E
