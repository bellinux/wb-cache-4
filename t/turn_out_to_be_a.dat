5|$|Coyle {{retired from}} playing duties in 1980, but {{continued}} as manager. In 1982, future manager David Jeffrey joined the club following {{a stint in}} the Manchester United youth team and played for Coyle under many of his trophy successes, captaining the side for much of that time. One of Coyle's biggest achievements as manager was leading the club to six consecutive league titles between 1981–82 and 1986–87, equalling the record for the most consecutive titles which was set by Belfast Celtic in 1947–48. 1986 was the year that Noel Bailie began what would <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> 25-year career at the club. Although a defender for most of that time, Bailie began as a left midfielder.|$|E
5|$|The {{status of}} the period 7 {{congener}} of the noble gases, oganesson (Og), is not known—it {{may or may not}} be a noble gas. It was originally predicted to be a noble gas but may instead be a fairly reactive solid with an anomalously low first ionisation potential, due to relativistic effects. On the other hand, if relativistic effects peak in period 7 at element 112, copernicium (as is thought to be the case), oganesson may <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> noble gas after all, albeit more reactive than either xenon or radon. Regardless, oganesson is predicted to be a nonmetal, and probably the only one in period 7.|$|E

5|$|Written by Edward Young, this is {{a horror}} story set in an {{isolated}} house. It would feature a group of university staff, one who was a cripple, trapped in the house during winter. One of the characters would <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> murderer. The story took its name and theme from the poem Night-Thoughts by Edward Young, namesake of the story's writer. It was later adapted by Young for Big Finish in February 2006. The adaptation featured the Seventh Doctor and Ace, as well as Big Finish-original companion Hex.|$|E
5|$|In week 12, in {{what would}} <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> preview of Super Bowl XXI, veteran {{defensive}} end George Martin (at 34 the oldest player on the team) intercepted a pass from Denver Broncos quarterback John Elway and returned it 78yards for a touchdown before being tackled from behind {{in the end zone}} by a celebrating Lawrence Taylor. Then in the final two minutes of the game, Simms hit fan–favorite Phil McConkey for a 46-yard pass. This led to another game-winning kick from Allegre as the Giants defeated Denver 19–16 in front of 75,116 fans at Giants Stadium. With the victory the Giants completed their second five-game winning streak of the season, several of them in close contests; the margin of victory in those five games was 7, 3, 3, 2, and 3 points.|$|E
5|$|In {{what would}} <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> preview of Super Bowl XXV, the Giants lost {{at home to}} the Buffalo Bills 17–13 in Week 15. The game was played in inclement weather, which caused 10,295 no-shows at Giants Stadium. They led the Bills in total yards (313 to 264), rushing yards (157 to 65), first downs (20 to 13) and time of {{possession}} (37:59 to 22:01), but lost nonetheless. Simms broke his foot during the game, causing him to miss {{the remainder of the}} season, and was replaced by Jeff Hostetler, who had engineered the Giants' Week 7 fourth-quarter comeback against Phoenix. The Bills built a 14–10 second quarter lead behind 74- and 78-yard touchdown drives. The teams alternated field goals to make the score 17–13. However, the Giants could not score in the fourth quarter despite mounting drives to the Bills' 18 and 23yard lines. This was Lionel Manuel's last game as a Giant, as he was waived afterwards.|$|E

5|$|Pattillo Higgins {{was born}} to Roberto James and Sarah (Raye) Higgins on December 5, 1863, in Sabine Pass, Texas. His family moved to Beaumont when he was six years old. He {{attended}} school {{until he reached the}} fourth grade, after which he apprenticed as a gunsmith under his father’s direction. In his youth, he was a violent troublemaker, pulling pranks and harassing African Americans. When he was seventeen, he pulled a prank on a black Baptist church that got the attention of a sheriff deputy. The deputy fired a warning shot over Higgins' head, after which Higgins fired back and delivered what would later <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> fatal hit. The wounded deputy managed to fire again, striking Higgins lower left arm. Higgins' arm would later become severely infected, requiring amputation from the elbow down. Higgins was put on trial for the murder of the deputy, but he would be found not guilty by a jury that perceived his act as self-defense. After his acquittal, he worked as a logger along the Texas-Louisiana border, apparently unhindered by his lack of an arm. It was in 1885 that he attended a Baptist revival meeting where he made the decision to become a Christian. Realizing that the lumber camps were not the ideal place to maintain a good morality, he decided to return to Beaumont, Texas to establish himself as a businessman.|$|E

25|$|According to many phoneticians, {{the sounds}} of {{language}} arrange and re-arrange themselves through self-organization Speech sounds have both perceptual ("how you hear them") and articulatory ("how you produce them") properties, all with continuous values.
