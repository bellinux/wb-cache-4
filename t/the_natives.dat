5|$|After {{a victory}} over Spen Valley District, the team {{travelled}} west to play Somersetshire, Devonshire, Taunton, and Gloucestershire, and won all five games. The victory over Somerset was the New Zealanders' largest of the tour; they scored nine tries in a 17–4 victory. Half-back Keogh played outstandingly for <b>the</b> <b>Natives,</b> while the entire side demonstrated superior passing and combination to their opposition. Devonshire and Tauton suffered heavy defeats by the New Zealanders, before a strong Gloucestershire side was dismissed. After defeating Midland Counties, <b>the</b> <b>Natives</b> returned to London.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to England, <b>the</b> <b>Natives</b> faced Lancashire in Manchester, where they lost 1–0. Two days later they drew with Batley Bulldogs, despite their opposition scoring five tries. Their next match was against Yorkshire, who {{were one of}} the strongest counties in the country, and {{went on to win the}} inaugural County Championship that season. Yorkshire fielded a weakened team, and were subsequently defeated 10–6 by <b>the</b> <b>Natives,</b> who scored six tries. After a further two victories, the team travelled to Wales, where they lost 3–0 to Llanelli, before facing Wales on 22 December.|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} two {{large-scale}} battles between the Spanish and Pipil armies resulted in decisive victories for the European invaders, <b>the</b> <b>natives</b> preferred to flee their settlements at their approach rather than face the conquistadors on an open battlefield. A common tactic of <b>the</b> <b>natives</b> was to concentrate themselves in strongly-defended mountaintop fortresses.|$|E

50|$|The name of <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> Polish Church was {{inspired}} by the name of a church associating the descendants of <b>the</b> <b>native</b> peoples of America, <b>the</b> Indians: <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> American Church. Likewise as <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> American Church, <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> Polish Church refers to the old (pre-Christian) ethnic beliefs, at the same time respecting all later-come religions. The term Church that appears in the organisation’s name is used solely to denote a religious organisation of believers and their clergy.|$|R

5|$|In 1717, François-Marie Picoté de Belestre {{established}} {{the post of}} Ouiatenon (modern Lafayette, Indiana) to discourage the Wea from coming under British influence. In 1732, François-Marie Bissot, Sieur de Vincennes, established a similar post near the Piankeshaw in the town that still bears his name. Although the forts were garrisoned by men from New France, Fort Vincennes was the only outpost to maintain a permanent European presence until the modern day. Jesuit priests accompanied many of the French soldiers into Indiana {{in an attempt to}} convert <b>the</b> <b>natives</b> to Christianity. The Jesuits conducted missionary activities, lived among <b>the</b> <b>natives</b> and learned their languages, and accompanied them on hunts and migrations. Gabriel Marest, one of the first missionaries in Indiana, taught among the Kaskaskia as early as 1712. The missionaries came to have great influence among <b>the</b> <b>natives</b> and {{played an important role in}} keeping the native tribes allied with the French.|$|E
5|$|In 1878, the Bannock {{people and}} {{northern}} Shoshone tribes {{participated in the}} Bannock War, a war against white settlers in the region over the destruction of camas root — {{a major source of}} food for <b>the</b> <b>natives</b> — by white settlers' hogs. The Bannock and the Northern Paiute suffered from violence during the conflict, and once the white settlers had won the war, <b>the</b> <b>natives</b> were allotted into various reservations. The Northern Paiute were sent to the Yakama Indian Reservation, and in later years have been dispersed throughout several reservations in the western United States.|$|E
5|$|In {{a parody}} of Avatar, {{taking place in the}} future, Krusty the Clown sends the {{military}} force to the planet Rigel 7 to find the a sacred extract Hilarrium, so he can easily entertain his Nazi audience. The military recruits Bart and Milhouse to befriend the alien race in avatar bodies. They succeed in this and Bart ends up getting Kang's daughter pregnant after falling in love with her. They learn that the extract Hilarrium, which is excreted by their queen, is primarily used by <b>the</b> <b>natives</b> to reduce the mood swings of pregnant women. Milhouse then contacts the military of their location, which then attacks <b>the</b> <b>natives.</b> In the battle, <b>the</b> <b>natives</b> are helped by all the animals of the planet, which eventually defeats the military. Kang and Kodos then admit that they would have just given the Hilarrium to the humans.|$|E
50|$|In Africa, Matt Parkman {{continues}} his spirit walk with <b>the</b> strange <b>native</b> who has precognitive painting powers, {{similar to those}} of Isaac Mendez. <b>The</b> <b>native</b> reveals that he has painted Matt's life ever since he was a boy. They reach <b>the</b> <b>native's</b> house, and Matt is shown numerous paintings of himself, mostly beginning from when he discovered his powers. <b>The</b> <b>native</b> tells him that one painting has to change. <b>The</b> <b>native</b> paints over an image of Matt with a woman (who distinctly resembles Daphne, the speedster Hiro is currently confronting) and a baby that has no longer come to pass, replacing it with a scene where Matt grieves over a dead woman he holds in his arms. Matt later wants to know what this all means, and <b>the</b> <b>native</b> invites Matt into his house, where Matt takes a seat and he is seen eating something that <b>the</b> <b>native</b> has given him. Matt tells <b>the</b> <b>native</b> that he does not feel anything. <b>The</b> <b>native</b> gives Matt his Walkman and says this will help. Matt's eyes then turn white and his pupils vanish, as when <b>the</b> <b>native</b> and Isaac Mendez use their power. Matt then begins to learn about the future.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Native</b> Americans traded furs {{and food}} with the Dutch for various goods.

5|$|Pontiac's War has {{traditionally}} been portrayed as a defeat for <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> Americans, but scholars now usually {{view it as a}} military stalemate: while <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> Americans had failed to drive away the British, the British were unable to conquer <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> Americans. Negotiation and accommodation, rather than success on the battlefield, ultimately brought an end to <b>the</b> war. <b>The</b> <b>Native</b> Americans had in fact won a victory of sorts by compelling the British government to abandon Amherst's policies and instead create a relationship with <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> Americans modeled on the Franco-Native alliance.|$|R
5|$|Keogh {{had played}} in at least 70 of the 107 matches on tour, of which only one was in New Zealand. As well as his 34 tries in the British Isles, Keogh scored ten tries in Australia. His last match for <b>the</b> <b>Natives</b> was against his own {{province}} of Otago; he stayed in Dunedin {{as the rest of}} the team moved on to Christchurch. <b>The</b> <b>Natives</b> won 11–8 and scored five tries, with the play of Keogh praised in particular.|$|E
5|$|People {{have lived}} along the Rogue River {{and its tributaries}} for at least 8,500years. European explorers made first contact with Native Americans (Indians) {{toward the end of}} the 18thcentury and began beaver {{trapping}} and other activities in the region. Clashes, sometimes deadly, occurred between <b>the</b> <b>natives</b> and the trappers and later between <b>the</b> <b>natives</b> and European-American miners and settlers. These struggles culminated with the Rogue River Wars of 1855–56 and removal of most of <b>the</b> <b>natives</b> to reservations outside the basin. After the war, settlers expanded into remote areas of the watershed and established small farms along the river between Grave Creek and the mouth of the Illinois River. They were relatively isolated from the outside world until 1895, when the Post Office Department added mail-boat service along the lower Rogue. As of 2010, the Rogue has one of the two remaining rural mail-boat routes in the United States.|$|E

50|$|The Spanish conquistadors {{tried to}} subdue <b>the</b> <b>native</b> people and force Catholicism on <b>the</b> <b>native</b> people during <b>the</b> early 17th century, {{which led to}} the Pueblo Revolt of 1680. The people {{withstood}} the Spaniards by climbing {{to the top of the}} Black Mesa. The siege ended with the surrender of <b>the</b> <b>native</b> people, but <b>the</b> Spanish gave <b>the</b> <b>native</b> people some freedom of religion and other self-governing rights.|$|R
5|$|The Russians, {{unlike the}} British and Americans, endeavoured to convert <b>the</b> <b>natives</b> to Christianity. Many Aleuts joined the Russian Orthodox Church. Russian missionaries founded {{a number of}} churches for <b>the</b> <b>natives,</b> such as the Church of the Holy Ascension in Unalaska. A notable Russian missionary was Saint Innocent of Alaska. For {{his work as a}} missionary, bishop, and later {{archbishop}} in Alaska and the Russian Far East he was canonized. One of the earliest Christian martyrs in North America was Saint Peter the Aleut. Other important Russian missionaries include Herman of Alaska and Joasaph Bolotov.|$|E
5|$|The side left Christchurch and {{travelled}} north {{where they}} played Wairarapa in Masterton. The match was won 10–8, {{and the next}} day they faced Wellington, who they also defeated. The fixture against Wellington was nearly abandoned because Scott and the Wellington Rugby Union could not agree on a venue; the match went ahead only when the Wellington officials agreed to cede <b>the</b> <b>Natives</b> all profit from the match. After this <b>the</b> <b>Natives</b> travelled to Auckland where they played their last match, against the province on 24 August. The match was lost 7–2 after each team scored two tries each, but the Aucklanders kicked a drop-goal and a conversion. The loss ended a remarkable run of matches– <b>the</b> <b>Natives</b> had a 31-game unbeaten streak in rugby matches that started with their victory over Widnes on 9 March; the side won 30, and drew one match between the defeats.|$|E
5|$|The task of {{incorporating}} eastern Honduras into the Spanish Empire {{fell to the}} evangelising efforts of Spanish missionary orders. The earliest Franciscan missionaries, {{at the beginning of}} the 17th century, attempted to convert <b>the</b> <b>natives</b> in their own settlements. It soon became obvious that this was impractical, given the paucity of available missionaries, and the wide dispersal of Indian villages and towns. The friars changed their tactics, and gathered <b>the</b> <b>natives</b> in mission towns, known as reducciones.|$|E

5|$|Born near Mobile, then {{a part of}} French Louisiana, on May 31, 1760, Simon Favre {{was the son of}} Jean Claude Favre (1721–1782) and Marguerite Wiltz (1740–1805). His grandfather, Jean Baptiste Favre, {{came from}} Royan, France, and by {{tradition}} was a cabin boy when Pierre D'Iberville placed him on shore near Biloxi to make contact with <b>the</b> <b>natives.</b> His father was a government interpreter who was commissioned to explain the terms of the Treaty of Paris (1763) to <b>the</b> <b>natives</b> upon the conclusion of the French and Indian War.

5|$|By summer 1537, Montejo {{believed}} that Higueras {{had been almost}} completely pacified, with very few casualties amongst either the Spanish or <b>the</b> <b>natives.</b> Gracias a Dios and San Pedro were more secure, and many Indians had returned to their villages, encouraged by Montejo's moderate policies. In reality, only the areas around the Spanish settlements had been thoroughly conquered, and in the remoter areas {{the vast majority of}} <b>the</b> <b>natives</b> were still hostile to the Spanish, and determined to resist. In contrast to other provinces, the Spanish were unable to recruit reliable native auxiliaries to assist their conquest.|$|E
5|$|During the night, {{three of}} the militia's horses wandered off; the next day, June 25, three men {{went in search of}} the animals while the rest stayed behind. At the cabin, seven Native American braves {{appeared}} in the distance. The troops immediately began pursuing <b>the</b> <b>natives,</b> who fled into the woods, instead of reporting the sighting to Dement. The Native American warriors, as had been done other times {{during the course of the}} war, set an ambush for the militia men in the forest. The militia pursued <b>the</b> <b>natives</b> into the woods and, as they entered the forest, <b>the</b> <b>natives</b> opened fire, the volley instantly killed two militia men and wounded another. The militia retreated and formed a battle line but the native forces would not relent. The rest of Dement's company attempted to rescue the outmatched militia men but were unable to beat back the native warriors. Black Hawk's band attacked the militia men, again forcing the beleaguered force to fall back to the Kellogg cabin and barn.|$|E
5|$|In {{a speech}} at the Berlin Geographical Society in 1919, Detzner claimed that <b>the</b> <b>natives</b> of New Guinea had opposed Australian {{domination}} and resisted a military recruitment that amounted to slavery, that even the English plantation holders wished to remain independent of Australia, and that <b>the</b> <b>natives</b> were collecting money to build a war memorial for the Germans. The report on Detzner's speech, transmitted from a news agency in London, caused a small flutter in Australian government circles, but generally was dismissed; an earlier report by the Australian judiciary had absolved the Australian force of improper recruiting or treatment of the New Guineans. An angry letter to the editor from another Australian source, who claimed to have been in service in Morobe from 1914–1915, received little attention.|$|E
5000|$|Hybridization {{occurs when}} members of two {{different}} species mate {{with one another and}} produce viable offspring that carry genes from both parents.
