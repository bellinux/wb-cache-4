500|$|The {{documentary}} tells {{its story}} {{by focusing on}} the careers of six women—The Fabulous Moolah, Mae Young, Gladys [...] "Kill 'Em" [...] Gillem, Ida Mae Martinez, Ella Waldek and Penny Banner. It begins by describing the beginning of wrestling in the 1930s. By the 1940s, American men had to leave the country to fight in World War II, leaving females to take over the sport. At first, women's wrestling was seen as a side-show, and it was banned in several states. The film mostly focuses on these years—the 1940s—along with the 1950s and 1960s, better known as the [...] "heyday of women's wrestling", when the sport became more accepted and popular. The six women are interviewed and <b>tell</b> <b>their</b> <b>stories</b> of why they entered wrestling. They also share tales of being exploited financially, unruly fans, and being physically abused. The film splices in archival footage of their matches, television clips, and footage from a 1951 movie entitled Racket Girls in between interviews. The film also covers their post-wrestling occupations: lion-tamer, detective, nurse, and yodeler. The film ends with footage from the Gulf Coast Wrestlers Reunion, where they meet to swap stories.|$|E

[...] In 1968, the house dissociated from the national fraternity, and adopted the name Chi Phi Heorot. [...] The [...] "Heorot" [...] in Chi Phi Heorot comes from the medieval poem Beowulf, in which Heorot is the great hall where warriors converge to <b>tell</b> <b>their</b> <b>stories.</b> [...] After several suspensions by the college in the early 1980s, it re-joined the Chi Phi national in 1981. [...] This was short-lived; in 1987, because of damage done to the house that the college insisted upon having repaired for safety reasons but the Chi Phi national refused to help finance, the Dartmouth brotherhood again opted to become a local fraternity. [...] In exchange for financing renovations to the structure, the college assumed ownership of the property and house. [...] In its second incarnation as a local fraternity, the brotherhood chose the name Chi Heorot. Notable alumni include Gerry Geran '18, Adam Nelson '97, and Andrew Weibrecht '09, all Olympic medalists.|$|E
