50|$|Mahan {{believed}} first, {{that good}} political and naval leadership {{was no less}} important than geography {{when it came to}} the development of sea power. Second, Mahan's unit of political analysis insofar as sea power was concerned was a <b>transnational</b> <b>consortium,</b> rather than a single nation state. Third, his economic ideal was free trade rather than autarchy. Fourth, his recognition of the influence of geography on strategy was tempered by a strong appreciation of the power of contingency to affect outcomes.|$|E
50|$|Mahan {{contended that}} with a command of the sea, even if local and temporary, naval {{operations}} in support of land forces could be of decisive importance. He also believed that naval supremacy could be exercised by a <b>transnational</b> <b>consortium</b> acting in defense of a multinational system of free trade. His theories, expounded before the submarine became a serious factor in warfare, delayed the introduction of convoys as a defense against German U-boats during World War I. By the 1930s, the US Navy had built long-range submarines to raid Japanese shipping; but in World War II, the Japanese, still tied to Mahan, designed their submarines as ancillaries to the fleet and failed to attack American supply lines in the Pacific.|$|E
30|$|The ILocalApp project (incidentally {{learning}} {{other cultures}} and languages through an APP) is a 3 -year Erasmus+[*]KA 2 project, carried out by a <b>transnational</b> <b>consortium</b> (University of Bologna, Italy; the Adam Mickiewicz University, Poland; University of Lapland, Finland; Centre for Social Studies, Portugal). Its main goal is to design and develop a mobile application for incidental learning [13, 14] of four cultures and languages: Finnish, Italian, Polish, and Portuguese [15]. ILocalApp aims to let its users acquire language and culture, thanks to learners’ participation in an informal way [16]. Learners {{would be able to}} wander around the city while using the application to enjoy language and culture geolocalized contents in a context-aware way. Thus, mobility students (e.g. Erasmus, exchange, overseas, International, mobility students, etc.) would be supported in their daily activities, getting in touch with local language and culture in a simple and innovative way, which enhances their integration and their interaction with the country hosting them [17].|$|E

40|$|End {{of project}} reportThis project was a {{development}} project connected to an INTERREG sub-programme called the Northern Periphery Programme (NPP). More specifically, {{this project was}} funded as an NPP Preparatory Project. The aim of such NPP Preparatory Projects is to facilitate {{the development of a}} <b>transnational</b> <b>consortium</b> that may produce an application to the NPP for a main project. Such a main project application will not directly ensue from this Preparatory Project, although it may do so in the future. Nevertheless, there are tangible immediate returns to Teagasc from this Preparatory Project that include 1) the opportunity, if considered appropriate, for Teagasc to join an existing NPP main project in 2011 that promotes a new mechanism to support rural enterprise such as food and tourism {{in the form of the}} Economusuem® concept and 2) the establishment of new international and national academic and agency contacts working in the area of local development...|$|E
