5|$|Jumping {{technique}} {{has played a}} significant part {{in the history of}} the event. High jumpers typically cleared the bar feet first in the late 19th century, using either <b>the</b> <b>Scissors,</b> Eastern cut-off or Western roll technique. The straddle technique became prominent in the mid-20th century, but Dick Fosbury overturned tradition by pioneering a backwards and head-first technique in the late 1960s – the Fosbury Flop – which won him the gold at the 1968 Olympics. This {{technique has}} become the overwhelming standard for the sport from the 1980s onwards. The standing high jump was contested at the Olympics from 1900 to 1912, but is now relatively uncommon outside of its use as an exercise drill.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> rolling <b>scissors</b> {{maneuver}} {{is somewhat}} different. Like <b>the</b> flat <b>scissors,</b> <b>the</b> rolling <b>scissors</b> maneuver is typically an engagement of two fighters of similar capabilities {{with respect to}} their thrust-to-weight ratios (and thus similar climbing capabilities), turning characteristics and wing loading. Whereas <b>the</b> flat <b>scissors</b> typically results from a failed attack resulting in a slow speed differential overshoot of the defender by the attacker, <b>the</b> rolling <b>scissors</b> usually results from a failed attack at higher speed, and overshoot. <b>The</b> rolling <b>scissors</b> is also often initiated by the attacker first diving from a higher altitude at the bandit and overshooting the bandit in the vertical, as well as horizontal plane.|$|R
50|$|Basic Fighter Maneuvering theory recognizes two {{different}} types of <b>scissors</b> maneuvers; <b>the</b> flat <b>scissors</b> and <b>the</b> rolling <b>scissors.</b>|$|R
5000|$|By {{imagining the}} {{difference}} between the initial conditions of the flat and rolling scissors, one can see how that the addition of the vertical component of the initial overshoot turns the rolling scissor engagement into a three-dimensional rolling encounter. Unlike <b>the</b> flat <b>scissors</b> which results in a fight to roll and turn the plane quickly, reverse turn quickly, and attempt to deplete energy in order to get behind the other aircraft to set up a successful shot, the contest in <b>the</b> rolling <b>scissors</b> is still one of successfully controlling forward motion so as to maneuver behind the other aircraft (get [...] "on his six" [...] in fighter pilot terminology). In <b>the</b> rolling <b>scissors,</b> <b>the</b> successful pilot is the one who best manages his energy in the climbs and descents of the barrel rolls, as they eventually come to have a larger overall effect on the reduction of forward speed than the simpler strategies used to reduce thrust, add drag or time the rolls and turns in <b>the</b> flat <b>scissors.</b>|$|R

25|$|The second {{match was}} a Carson City Silver Dollar match between John Tenta and Big Bubba, who was {{accompanied}} by Jimmy Hart. Attached {{to one of the}} ringposts by straps was a tall steel pole, with a sock of silver coins hanging from the top. At the start of the match, both attempted to get the sock but were stopped by the other. Bubba climbed the turnbuckles but Tenta forced him to drop onto the top turnbuckle. After performing an atomic drop onto the turnbuckle, Tenta tossed Bubba to the outside. Tenta attempted to remove the straps. Bubba came back and uses a belt to choke Tenta. He then used athletic tape to tape Tenta's left wrist to the middle rope and continued attacking Tenta with the belt. As Bubba cut Tenta's hair with scissors, Tenta performed a low blow. Using <b>the</b> <b>scissors,</b> he cut his hand free and attempted to cut the straps. Bubba stopped him, and performed a spinebuster. Bubba then told Hart to climb the pole. As Hart got the sock, Tenta performed a scoop slam. Tenta grabbed the sock from Hart, hit Bubba with it, and pinned Bubba for the victory.|$|E

500|$|Greed {{received}} mostly negative reviews. The {{trade paper}} Harrison's Report said that [...] "f a contest {{were to be}} held to determine {{which has been the}} filthiest, vilest, most putrid picture {{in the history of the}} motion picture business, I am sure that Greed would win." [...] Variety Weekly called it [...] "an out-and-out box office flop" [...] only six days after its premiere and claimed that the film had taken two years to shoot, cost $700,000 and was originally 130 reels long. The review went on to say that [...] "nothing more morbid and senseless, from a commercial picture standpoint, has been seen on the screen for a long, long time" [...] and that despite its [...] "excellent acting, fine direction and the undoubted power of its story... it does not entertain." [...] In its December 1924 – January 1925 issue, Exceptional Photoplays called it [...] "one of the most uncompromising films ever shown on the screen. There have already been many criticisms of its brutality, its stark realism, its sordidness. But the point is that it was never intended to be a pleasant picture." [...] In the February 1925 issue of Theatre Magazine, Aileen St. John-Brenon wrote that [...] "the persons in the photoplay are not characters, but types—they are well selected, weighed and completely drilled. But they did not act; they do not come to life. They perform their mission like so many uncouth images of miserliness and repugnant animalism." [...] Mordaunt Hall of the New York Times gave the film a mostly positive review in regards to the acting and directing while criticizing how it was edited, writing that MGM [...] "clipped this production as much as they dared... and are to be congratulated on their efforts and the only pity is that they did not use <b>the</b> <b>scissors</b> more generously in the beginning." [...] In a Life Magazine article, Robert E. Sherwood also defended MGM's cutting of the film and called von Stroheim [...] "a genius... badly in need of a stopwatch." [...] Iris Barry of the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) disliked the tinting, saying [...] "a not very pleasing yellow tinge is smudged in." [...] A March 1925 review in Pictureplay magazine stated, [...] "perhaps an American director would not have seen greed as a vice." ...|$|E

2500|$|Kahlo's {{paintings}} often feature root imagery {{with roots}} {{growing out of}} her body to tie her to the ground, reflecting in a positive sense the theme of personal growth; in a negative sense of being trapped in a particular place, time and situation; and finally in an ambiguous sense of how memories of the past influence the present for either good and/or ill. In My Grandparents and I, Kahlo painted herself as a ten-year holding a ribbon that grows from an ancient tree that bears the portraits of her grandparents and other ancestors while her left foot is a tree trunk growing out of the ground, reflecting Kahlo's view of humanity's unity with the earth, and her own sense of unity with Mexico itself. In Kahlo's paintings, trees serve as symbols of hope, of strength and of a continuity that transcends generations. Additionally, hair features {{as a symbol of}} growth and of the feminine in Kahlo's paintings and in Self Portrait with Cropped Hair, Kahlo painted herself wearing a man's suit and shorn of her long hair, which she had just cut off. Kahlo holds <b>the</b> <b>scissors</b> with one hand menacingly close to her genitals, which can be interpreted as a threat to Rivera whose frequent unfaithfulness infuriated her and/or a threat to harm her own body just like she has attacked her own hair, a sign of the way that women often project their fury against others onto themselves. Moreover, the picture reflects Kahlo's frustration not only with Rivera, but also her unease with the patriarchal values of Mexico as <b>the</b> <b>scissors</b> serve as a symbol of a malevolent sense of masculinity that threatens to [...] "cut up" [...] women, both metaphorically and literally. In Mexico, the traditional Spanish values of machismo were widely embraced, and as a woman, Kahlo was always uncomfortable with machismo.|$|E

5000|$|More {{typically}} {{what happens}} next in <b>the</b> rolling <b>scissors</b> is that <b>the</b> initial attacker, aware of his vulnerability caused by the overshoot, also rolls his aircraft, and pulls his nose toward the bandit's aircraft. Due to the two components of the initial overshoot (vertical and horizontal), if the pilots keep attempting to turn their noses toward their opponent, then energy management, elements of roll and turn (as in the flat scissors; although in <b>the</b> rolling <b>scissors</b> there are no reverses of turn), as well as climbs and descents {{will be required to}} maintain maneuvering that might, if successful, result in a position from which a shot can be made. What evolves therefore in <b>the</b> rolling <b>scissors</b> is a maneuver that is essentially two aircraft barrel-rolling, involving rolling and looping motions, climbing and descending and turning while the aircraft rolls around its longitudinal axis. The barrel roll has a vertical component which the aileron roll lacks. Unfortunately, the two maneuvers are often confused in many contexts, or are used as if they are interchangeable terms. They are not. The [...] "snap roll" [...] is yet another maneuver, commonly seen in aerobatics performances, and is similar to a flat spin (thus involving an aerodynamic stall) and is not typically of any use in ACM) around each other's flight path, which might look like two interwoven cork-screws, or a double helix. The more barrel rolls that are flown in <b>the</b> rolling <b>scissors,</b> <b>the</b> more nearly the rolls become horizontal only, as each pilot attempts to deplete enough forward speed to place his fighter behind the other.|$|R
