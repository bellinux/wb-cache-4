After briefly {{threatening}} to sue for libel and calling the report [...] "journalistic terrorism", Pérez Balladares later stated {{that it had been}} correct, describing it as [...] "the first time, perhaps in my life, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> to swallow my words." [...] When Gorriti's work visa expired the following year, however, the Panamanian government refused to renew it, triggering a storm of criticism from international press NGOs and domestic opposition parties. Under pressure, the Pérez Balladares government later relented, and Gorriti's visa was renewed.|$|E
500|$|Monteux {{believed}} {{that most of}} the anger aroused by the work was due not to the music but to Nijinsky's choreography, described by Stravinsky as [...] "knock-kneed and long-haired Lolitas jumping up and down". With the composer's agreement Monteux presented a concert performance in Paris in April 1914. Saint-Saëns, who was present, declared Stravinsky mad and left in a rage, but he was almost alone in his dislike. At the end Stravinsky was carried shoulder-high from the theatre after what he described as [...] "the most beautiful performance <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> of the Sacre du printemps". That performance was part of a series of [...] "Concerts Monteux", presented between February and April 1914, in which Monteux conducted the orchestra of the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées {{in a wide range of}} symphonic and concertante works, including the concert premiere of the orchestral version of Ravel's Valses nobles et sentimentales. His last notable engagement before the outbreak of war was as conductor of the premiere of Stravinsky's opera The Nightingale at the Palais Garnier.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the first}} test he made 33 in the first innings and was not out for 25 in the second, when he and Rod Marsh famously refused {{to go for a}} victory. Cosier later said [...] "there's no way <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> any second {{thoughts}} about the way Rod or I batted in Adelaide... I loved it." ...|$|E

2500|$|In a 2005 interview, Pearce states:"I'm {{very happy}} about that because I see Death in June {{as part of a}} European {{cultural}} revival. I'm pleased that the Old Gods are being resurrected, {{for want of a better}} word. Old symbols. I feel very pleased that I am a part of that process and <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> influence. At this stage in the game, so to speak, it's not false modesty to say that I am content with my influence." ...|$|E

He left school {{in the summer of}} 2005 with a Grade A in PE amongst his other GCSE results. In his final year at school, he was awarded the PE department's prize for {{services}} to sport. In the presentation, Morris commented: [...] "Gareth has a fierce determination to succeed and has the character and qualities to achieve his personal goals. He {{is one of the most}} unselfish individuals <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> the pleasure to help educate." ...|$|E
2500|$|Schnitzler's {{works were}} often controversial, both for their frank {{description}} of sexuality (in {{a letter to}} Schnitzler Sigmund Freud confessed [...] "I have gained the impression that you have learned through intuition – although actually {{as a result of}} sensitive introspection – everything <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> to unearth by laborious work on other persons") and for their strong stand against anti-Semitism, represented by works such as his play Professor Bernhardi and his novel Der Weg ins Freie. However, although Schnitzler was himself Jewish, Professor Bernhardi and Fräulein Else are among the few clearly identified Jewish protagonists in his work.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{not meant}} <b>that,</b> and was rather taken by surprise. For a moment all <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> {{in my mind}} in {{connexion}} with Mr. Woodcourt seemed {{to come back and}} confuse me.|$|R
60|$|Whilst I {{was looking}} at the books, the door opened, and the Count entered. He saluted me in a hearty way, and hoped <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> a good night's rest. Then he went on.|$|R

2500|$|Arena's autobiography, Now I Can Dance, {{published}} by HarperCollins, {{was released on}} 14 October 2013 in paperback and E-book format. It is billed by HarperCollins as [...] "Honest and intimate, funny and frank, Now I Can Dance is the long-awaited memoir from the very special, much-loved singer, songwriter and pop diva, Tina Arena." [...] She told Kathy McCabe of News Corp Australia that [...] "I don't need to put a book out to {{put food on the}} table. It started to dawn on me in the last year <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> an unbelievable life and I want people to know it's been hilarious, there's been a lot of laughter in my journey." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sophia Bush portrays Brooke Davis. [...] "What I do {{like about}} her– the things <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> to portray her going through– you always learn {{a lesson from}} Brooke", stated Bush. [...] "She always manages to pick herself up when she falls on her face. And I respect that. She is not all high and mighty and she doesn't act like she is always right. She {{has a lot of}} {{convictions}} and she is [...] really loyal friend. I appreciate how loyal she is. She doesn't take betrayal lightly and she doesn't think it is OK to lie to someone." [...] Brooke is the beautiful captain of the high school cheerleading squad, and the best friend of Peyton, and close friend of Haley. She has twice been a girlfriend to Lucas. Though her life appears perfect at the beginning, she is seen to suffer from having to deal with her distant parents, her friends' inability to take her seriously, and the betrayal of Lucas and Peyton when they date behind her back leaving her hurt. She eventually overcomes the betrayal and is determined to live a full, happy life.|$|E

"Well, if you <b>had</b> been so {{sound asleep}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> to violently wake you up, <b>I</b> should <b>have</b> done so. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> my chance, Netta.

6000|$|... "Perhaps I only persuaded myself <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had.</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{been reading}} William James on {{religious}} experiences and I was thinking {{very much of}} Conversion. I tried to experience Conversion...." ...|$|R

60|$|I {{think he}} understood, though I could explain nothing, but <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> a fear {{something}} <b>had</b> happened to him, for {{from that time}} forward he dropped all reserve with me, and talked openly of our approaching parting.|$|R
60|$|I {{was very}} much impressed, {{and not for the}} first time, by my {{guardian}}'s subtlety. To confess the truth, I very heartily wished, and not for the first time, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> some other guardian of minor abilities.|$|R
60|$|This {{peculiar}} {{pride of}} race would <b>have</b> amused me in another man. I found myself listening to Monsieur de St. Gre with gravity, and I {{did not dare}} to reply <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> evidence of Mademoiselle's aptness of retort.|$|R

60|$|After <b>I</b> <b>had</b> drunk {{half a dozen}} glasses, my {{policy of}} temperateness in mind, <b>I</b> decided <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> enough for <b>that</b> time.

6000|$|... "You've scruples <b>that</b> <b>I</b> shouldn't <b>have</b> <b>had,</b> and you've ideas <b>that</b> <b>I</b> shouldn't <b>have</b> <b>had</b> either.

60|$|Immediately the {{pangs of}} hunger and thirst began to assail me. Where before <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> but a mild craving {{for food and}} drink, I now {{actually}} suffered for want of it, and all because of the tantalizing sight <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> of food almost within my grasp.|$|R
6000|$|... "You are," [...] she whispered, [...] "the old Victor again! Thank God <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> {{this one}} glimpse of you! I am ashamed {{to think how}} terrified I have been." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{have only}} to add, by way of {{postscript}} to these preliminary chapters, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> recourse to Moliere's recipe, and read my manuscript over to my old woman, Janet MacEvoy.|$|E
60|$|Ignoring {{the fact}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> all the luck, <b>I</b> was {{inclined}} to be self-satisfied when I thought of Sam. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> pitted my wits against his, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> won.

6000|$|... “I don’t see how I am {{to teach}} you,” I made protest. “I am just {{learning}} for myself.
