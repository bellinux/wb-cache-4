40|$|Chemical {{composition}} of Hibiscus drinks (Koor and Vimto varieties, commercial and traditional, infusions and syrups) (n = 8) {{was related to}} sensory evaluation and acceptance. Significant correlations between chemical composition and sensory perception of drinks were found (i. e. anthocyanin content and Hibiscus taste) (p < 0. 05). Consumers (n = 160) evaluated drink acceptability on a 9 -point verbal hedonic scale. Three classes of behaviour were identified: (a) <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>preferred</b> syrup (43 % of consumers); (b) <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>preferred</b> infusion (36 %); and (c) <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>preferred</b> all of the samples (21 %). Acceptability of 'syrup likers' was positively correlated to sweet taste, reducing sugar content and inversely correlated to acidic taste and titratable acidity (p < 0. 10). Acceptability of 'infusion likers' was positively correlated to the taste of Hibiscus drink and anthocyanin content. The study showed that the distinctions between the acceptability groups are very clear {{with respect to the}} chemical composition and rating of sensory attributes. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

25|$|Thinking {{and feeling}} are the {{decision-making}} (judging) functions. The thinking and feeling functions are both {{used to make}} rational decisions, based on the data received from their information-gathering functions (sensing or intuition). <b>Those</b> <b>who</b> <b>prefer</b> thinking tend to decide things from a more detached standpoint, measuring the decision by what seems reasonable, logical, causal, consistent, and matching a given set of rules. <b>Those</b> <b>who</b> <b>prefer</b> feeling tend to come to decisions by associating or empathizing with the situation, looking at it 'from the inside' and weighing the situation to achieve, on balance, the greatest harmony, consensus and fit, considering {{the needs of the}} people involved. Thinkers usually have trouble interacting with people who are inconsistent or illogical, and tend to give very direct feedback to others. They are concerned with the truth and view it as more important.|$|E

40|$|The Occupational {{preferences}} {{of a sample}} of undergraduate science students from two Colleges in London were explored {{by means of an}} Occupational Preferences Questionnaire. The study was intended to explore the relation of the preference for Research or Non-Research Occupations to other dimensions of Psychological relevance: Intelligence, Personality Factors, Values,Orientations to work satisfaction and Conformity. A classification of occupations in Science, according to the Research - Non-Research criterion was obtained by means of a Principal Components Analysis. Persons <b>who</b> <b>preferred</b> the Research Occupations tended to be more reserved, detached, critical and cool, rather than easy-going persons; to like things or words rather than dealing with people, to enjoy working alone {{but at the same time}} liking intellectual companionship and to be self-sufficient rather than group-dependent and accustomed to making their own decisions. The mean personality profile (l 6 P. F.) for <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>preferred</b> the Research Occupations was found to be very similar to the "Typical Profile" of the research scientists. However, no very strong differences in personality factors were found between <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>preferred</b> research occupations and <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>preferred</b> other occupations. The main difference between these groups was on their conformity scores as measured by a conformity test developed by the researcher. Thus, <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>preferred</b> research occupations scored significantly lower inconformity than <b>those</b> <b>who</b> liked teaching, administration, sales, etc. Refinement of the Conformity Test is suggested as it may be a useful instrument in selection procedures. The general pattern of occupational values expressed by this sample was found to be similar to those reported for College Students in previous literature. Persons <b>who</b> <b>preferred</b> Research Occupations valued the interest of the work most highly while <b>those</b> <b>who</b> had other occupational preferences placed a higher value on meeting or working with people. <p...|$|R

Within both camps there is a wide range of opinions. Of those who favour independence, some are in favour of an immediate unilateral declaration of independence. Others see it as something to be attained gradually and with the full consent of the Danish government and the Danish nation. In the unionist camp there are also many who foresee and welcome a gradual increase in autonomy even while strong ties with Denmark are maintained.|$|E

25|$|Waterless urinals {{are often}} {{installed}} alongside UDDTs {{for the convenience}} of male users. Urinals also reduce the risk that male users standing over the UDDT for urination (rather than sitting or squatting) inadvertently urinate into the feces vault or feces container. It is generally advisable that all UDDT users sit or squat to urinate. If urinals are provided, they can be used for <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>prefer</b> a standing position. Female urination devices are also available but they are not necessary for use with UDDTs as women normally sit or squat to urinate, a good posture which minimises urine from getting into the feces vault.|$|E
25|$|In 2015 a {{university}} level course aiming {{to encourage and}} support practitioners working with young children to introduce the Cornish language into their settings was launched. The Cornish Language Practice Project (Early Years) is a level 4 course approved by Plymouth University and run at Cornwall College. The course is not a Cornish language course, but students will be assessed {{on their ability to}} use the Cornish language constructively in their work with young children. The course will cover such topics as Understanding Bilingualism, Creating Resources and Integrating Language and Play, but the focus of the language provision will be on Cornish.

500|$|The initial slow pacing, {{especially}} {{compared to}} the first episodes of Noir, became a main reason why the audience often dropped watching Madlax before it could present its later story turns which eventually resulted in the moderate success of the series. Among other suggested reasons behind the mediocre popularity of the show were: the market saturation, which resulted from other anime series attempting to repeat the success of Noir since 2001; the expectable disinterest against a [...] "Noir remake", found among the fans of the first series; the over-the-top action scenes that some felt to be ridiculous; and its unconventional genre, which straddled Madlax uncomfortably between fans of mystical science fiction and <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>prefer</b> Noir strict realism.|$|E
500|$|Ayane {{is often}} {{regarded}} as a top-tier character {{in many of the}} games she is playable in, especially in the DOA fighting games where she was noted for being very unpredictable and confusing for the opponent as well as fast and hard to counter. Previewing the original Dead or Alive for the PlayStation, Computer & Video Games opined she [...] "has an unusual floaty kind of fighting style, but has some great moves. Her quick punches make stringing combos together easy, and her throws are great for hitting people into the Danger Zone" [...] (an interactive feature within some arenas). In Prima Games' official guide for Dead or Alive Ultimate (a remake version of Dead or Alive and Dead or Alive 2), Eric Mylonas declared Ayane the [...] "tougher of the two siblings" [...] as she [...] "brings strings of blindingly fast combos into play and has devastating holds and throws." [...] Mylonas wrote Ayane has a major weakness in that she can not stop moving without becoming [...] "an easy prey," [...] and she may not be favored by <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>prefer</b> [...] "huge, over-the-top moves," [...] but for a [...] "more patient sort, there's probably no better character in the game." [...] According to GameSpy's guide to Ultimate by Andrew Alfonso, Ayane's key moves include her high kick—which is [...] "a lot" [...] better than Kasumi's—with another move so powerful [...] "it's almost unfair to use it." [...] He also noted how she can be actually more effective with her back turned towards her opponent, {{despite the fact that the}} characters cannot block when facing away from an enemy. In his guide to Dead or Alive 3, Alfonso wrote Ayane is a very unpredictable and quick attacker, even more than in the previous games in the series, and should be played primarily for her backwards position, hers being the best such stance of all the characters in the game. Ayane's speed and deceiving attacks make her a [...] "pretty good" [...] partner for slower fighters for tag team battles, but her primary partners are other ninja characters.|$|E
