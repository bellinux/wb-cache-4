40|$|<b>The</b> <b>electrode</b> {{resistances}} {{of solid}} solutions of 75 mol% Bi 2 O 3 − 25 mol% Er 2 O 3 with sputtered and with copressed gold gauze electrodes were compared. In contrast with literature no enhancement of <b>the</b> <b>electrode</b> process could be observed for <b>the</b> copressed <b>electrodes.</b> <b>The</b> measurements show an oxygen partial pressure dependence of power− 0. 5 for <b>the</b> <b>electrode</b> resistance. Additionally 18 O 2 exchange results {{also point to}} a low oxygen coverage and dissociative adsorption of oxygen. <b>The</b> <b>electrode</b> surface contributes significantly to <b>the</b> <b>electrode</b> process...|$|R
50|$|During re{{charging}}, the charger applies a high DC voltage, usually around 150-200 volts, to <b>the</b> <b>electrode,</b> charging it with electrostatic charge. The quartz fiber, {{having the}} same charge, is repelled by the surface of <b>the</b> <b>electrode</b> due to <b>the</b> coulomb force and bends away from <b>the</b> <b>electrode.</b> After charging, <b>the</b> charge remains on <b>the</b> <b>electrode</b> because it is insulated.|$|R
50|$|For this to work, {{the cell}} {{capacitance}} must {{be higher than}} <b>the</b> <b>electrode</b> capacitance by at least an order of magnitude. Capacitance slows the kinetics (the rise and fall times) of currents. If <b>the</b> <b>electrode</b> capacitance is much {{less than that of}} the cell, then when current is passed through <b>the</b> <b>electrode,</b> <b>the</b> <b>electrode</b> voltage will change faster than the cell voltage. Thus, when current is injected and then turned off (at the end of a duty cycle), <b>the</b> <b>electrode</b> voltage will decay faster than the cell voltage. As soon as <b>the</b> <b>electrode</b> voltage asymptotes to the cell voltage, the voltage can be sampled (again) and the next amount of charge applied. Thus, the frequency of the duty cycle is limited to the speed at which <b>the</b> <b>electrode</b> voltage rises and decays while passing current. <b>The</b> lower <b>the</b> <b>electrode</b> capacitance <b>the</b> faster one can cycle.|$|R
5|$|Resonance was noticed {{early on}} in {{experiments}} with the Leyden jar, invented in 1746. The Leyden jar stores electricity due to its capacitance, and is, in fact, an early form of capacitor. When a Leyden jar is discharged by allowing a spark to jump between <b>the</b> <b>electrodes,</b> the discharge is oscillatory. This was not suspected until 1826, when Felix Savary in France, and later (1842) Joseph Henry in the US noted that a steel needle placed close to the discharge does not always magnetise in the same direction. They both independently drew the conclusion {{that there was a}} transient oscillation dying with time.|$|E
5|$|Technological adaptations {{have also}} {{utilised}} living beetles as cyborgs. For example, a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency funded project implanted electrodes into adult male Rhinoceros beetles, {{allowing them to}} be remotely controlled via a radio receiver held on its back. Electrical signals delivered via <b>the</b> <b>electrodes</b> command the insect to take off, turn left or right, or hover in midflight. The research was intended to suggest proof-of-concept for surveillance purposes. Similar technology {{has been applied to}} the flower beetle Mecynorhina torquata to stimulate different walking gaits and lengths of a live beetle controllable by a human operator.|$|E
5|$|Boron was not {{recognized}} as an element until it was isolated by Sir Humphry Davy and by Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac and Louis Jacques Thénard. In 1808 Davy observed that electric current sent through a solution of borates produced a brown precipitate on one of <b>the</b> <b>electrodes.</b> In his subsequent experiments, he used potassium to reduce boric acid instead of electrolysis. He produced enough boron to confirm a new element and named the element boracium. Gay-Lussac and Thénard used iron to reduce boric acid at high temperatures. By oxidizing boron with air, they showed that boric acid is an oxidation product of boron. Jöns Jakob Berzelius identified boron as an element in 1824. Pure boron was arguably first produced by the American chemist Ezekiel Weintraub in 1909.|$|E
50|$|Electrodes' {{ability to}} produce pseudocapacitance {{strongly}} depends on <b>the</b> <b>electrode</b> materials' chemical affinity to the ions adsorbed on <b>the</b> <b>electrode</b> surface {{as well as on}} <b>the</b> <b>electrode</b> pore structure and dimension.

5|$|The {{amount of}} {{americium}} {{in a typical}} new smoke detector is 1microcurie (37kBq) or 0.29 microgram. This amount declines slowly as the americium decays into neptunium-237, a different transuranic element with a much longer half-life (about 2.14 million years). With its half-life of 432.2 years, the americium in a smoke detector includes about 3% neptunium after 19 years, and about 5% after 32 years. The radiation passes through an ionization chamber, an air-filled space between two electrodes, and permits a small, constant current between <b>the</b> <b>electrodes.</b> Any smoke that enters the chamber absorbs the alpha particles, which reduces the ionization and affects this current, triggering the alarm. Compared to the alternative optical smoke detector, the ionization smoke detector is cheaper and can detect particles which {{are too small to}} produce significant light scattering; however, it is more prone to false alarms.|$|E
5|$|With ample {{current density}} and ionization, this forms a {{luminous}} electric arc (a continuous electric discharge similar to lightning) between <b>the</b> <b>electrodes.</b> Electrical resistance along the continuous electric arc creates heat, which dissociates more gas molecules and ionizes the resulting atoms (where degree of ionization {{is determined by}} temperature), and as per the sequence: solid-liquid-gas-plasma, the gas is gradually turned into a thermal plasma. A thermal plasma is in thermal equilibrium, {{which is to say}} that the temperature is relatively homogeneous throughout the heavy particles (i.e. atoms, molecules and ions) and electrons. This is so because when thermal plasmas are generated, electrical energy is given to electrons, which, due to their great mobility and large numbers, are able to disperse it rapidly and by elastic collision (without energy loss) to the heavy particles.|$|E

500|$|To {{strike the}} {{electric}} arc, <b>the</b> <b>electrode</b> {{is brought into}} contact with the workpiece by a very light touch with <b>the</b> <b>electrode</b> to <b>the</b> base metal then is pulled back slightly. This initiates the arc and thus the melting of the workpiece and <b>the</b> consumable <b>electrode,</b> and causes droplets of <b>the</b> <b>electrode</b> to be passed from <b>the</b> <b>electrode</b> to <b>the</b> weld pool. Striking an arc, which varies widely based upon electrode and workpiece composition, can be the hardest skill for beginners. The orientation of <b>the</b> <b>electrode</b> to workpiece is where most stumble, if <b>the</b> <b>electrode</b> is held at a perpendicular angle to the workpiece the tip will likely stick to the metal which will fuse <b>the</b> <b>electrode</b> to <b>the</b> workpiece which will cause it to heat up very rapidly. The tip of <b>the</b> <b>electrode</b> needs to be at a lower angle to the workpiece, which allows the weld pool to flow out of the arc. [...] As <b>the</b> <b>electrode</b> melts, <b>the</b> flux covering disintegrates, giving off shielding gases that protect the weld area from oxygen and other atmospheric gases. In addition, the flux provides molten slag which covers the filler metal as it travels from <b>the</b> <b>electrode</b> to <b>the</b> weld pool. Once part of the weld pool, the slag floats to the surface and protects the weld from contamination as it solidifies. Once hardened, it must be chipped away to reveal the finished weld. As welding progresses and <b>the</b> <b>electrode</b> melts, <b>the</b> welder must periodically stop welding to remove <b>the</b> remaining <b>electrode</b> stub and insert a new <b>electrode</b> into <b>the</b> <b>electrode</b> holder. This activity, combined with chipping away the slag, reduces {{the amount of time that}} the welder can spend laying the weld, making SMAW one of the least efficient welding processes. In general, the operator factor, or the percentage of operator's time spent laying weld, is approximately 25%.|$|R

25|$|Due to {{the absence}} of leads and {{proximity}} to <b>the</b> <b>electrodes,</b> MLCC chips have significantly lower parasitic inductance than f. e. leaded types, which makes them suitable for higher frequency applications.

25|$|Some {{deterioration}} {{occurs on}} each charge–discharge cycle.

50|$|For novices in electrochemistry, the {{predictions}} of this equation appear counter-intuitive, i.e. that ip increases at faster voltage scan rates. It {{is important to remember}} that current, i, is charge (or electrons passed) per unit time. In cyclic voltammetry, the current passing through <b>the</b> <b>electrode</b> is limited by the diffusion of species to <b>the</b> <b>electrode</b> surface. This diffusion flux is influenced by the concentration gradient near <b>the</b> <b>electrode.</b> <b>The</b> concentration gradient, in turn, is affected by the concentration of species at <b>the</b> <b>electrode,</b> and how fast the species can diffuse through solution. By changing the cell voltage, the concentration of the species at <b>the</b> <b>electrode</b> surface is also changed, as set by the Nernst equation. Therefore, a faster voltage sweep causes a larger concentration gradient near <b>the</b> <b>electrode,</b> resulting in a higher current.|$|R
40|$|Various spatiotemporal {{patterns}} of {{dark and light}} stripes are formed {{on the surface of}} an electrode put in an electrolyte solution in a Ag and Sb coelectrodeposition system.

When <b>the</b> <b>electrode</b> is placed vertically, natural convection generally emerges in the electrolyte solution in the vicinity of <b>the</b> <b>electrode</b> surface during electrodeposition and flows upward along <b>the</b> <b>electrode</b> surface. When convective flow along <b>the</b> <b>electrode</b> surface was eliminated by placing <b>the</b> <b>electrode</b> horizontally, <b>the</b> configuration of the one-directional traveling waves (anisotropic shape) changed to an isotropic shape.

25|$|The {{surge current}} rating of film {{capacitors}} {{can be enhanced}} by various internal configurations.

25|$|The voltage {{at which}} the {{dielectric}} becomes conductive is called the breakdown voltage, and is given by {{the product of the}} dielectric strength and the separation between <b>the</b> <b>electrodes.</b> The dielectric strength depends on temperature, frequency, shape of <b>the</b> <b>electrodes,</b> etc. Because a breakdown in a capacitor normally is a short circuit and destroys the component, the operating voltage is lower than the breakdown voltage.
