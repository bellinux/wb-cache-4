Richard was openly opposed to her character remarrying, but she was eventually convinced by the executive producer and battled, successfully, for Pauline to keep the [...] "Fowler" [...] surname.

500|$|Children of Earth {{director}} Euros Lyn {{remarks that}} by the third series Gwen has grown so that [...] "she now is {{on a par with}} Jack, in terms of having the knowledge and the experience to make decisions and to be a heroine". Daniel Martin of The Guardian opines that her characterisation in the serial [...] "shows just how far she's come", whilst Robert Lloyd of the Los Angeles Times feels that she is a [...] "soulful leather-jacketed action heroine". Myles states that Gwen becomes a harsher character, but she feels that, [...] "if she wasn't, people would die". David Cornelius observes that Gwen is no longer the kind-hearted outsider she was when she first joined Torchwood. By Children of Earth she has become [...] "colder and much more aggressive". Her horrific experiences turn her into [...] "a biting cynic"; when both government and army betray the British people, Gwen claims to understand finally why the Doctor does not save humanity from world crises. She believes he [...] "must look at this planet and turn away in shame". A press release stated that Miracle Day had Gwen [...] "make <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>terrible</b> decisions, on behalf of all mankind". This is evident in [...] "The Blood Line", where her character is shown to be willing to sacrifice the entire Torchwood team, in addition to her dying father, {{for the good of the}} world. Commenting on Gwen's characterisation in this episode, Dan Martin notes that [...] "Gwen sees transition into the Earth Mothering Tank Girl become complete, as she plays God and appears to love it." ...|$|E
500|$|Paige {{transferred}} to the New York production of Sunset Boulevard to make her Broadway debut at the Minskoff Theatre on 12 September 1996, staying with the show until it closed on 22 March 1997. On the Sunset Boulevard set in Broadway, the staircase steps had to be raised six inches (15cm) {{in order to accommodate}} Paige's short stature, or it would have been hard to see her behind the banister. [...] Paige was welcomed to the Broadway stage with a long standing ovation from the audience, and received largely positive reviews for her New York performance as Norma Desmond: [...] "The lush sound and the sheer power of her voice are, to put it simply, incredible", wrote one critic, whilst another said [...] "Her voice has great range, remarkable clarity and emotional force". Paige was the first Norma Desmond in Sunset Boulevard to sing one of the show's key songs, [...] "With One Look", which she did first at Lloyd Webber's wedding to Madeleine Gurdon, although at the time the song was called [...] "Just One Glance". Lloyd Webber noted, regarding Paige's performance of one of the show's other prominent songs, [...] "As If We Never Said Goodbye", that it was [...] "as good, if not the best, of anything I've ever heard of mine". [...] Regarding the key lyric in the song, [...] "This world's waited long enough. I've come home at last", Paige had sought to change the way the melody was sung, despite being fully aware of Lloyd-Webber's fastidious tendencies. To her, the moment was not exploited to its fullest potential, so she approached the show's musical director, David Caddick, and expressed her wish to hold the word [...] "home", to which he agreed. Although she had been disappointed when she hoped to perform on Broadway in Evita, Cats and Chess, Paige stated of her debut there, [...] "It was just the most perfect time to go with that particular show". After Sunset Boulevard finished, she suffered from depression, commenting that the show's closing [...] "was <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>terrible</b> feeling.... I'd felt I'd lost something so very important to me. I thought it had died and gone away." ...|$|E
