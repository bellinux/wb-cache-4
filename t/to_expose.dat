5|$|Bob Bishop confronts Noah Bennet (Jack Coleman), {{telling him}} that his {{daughter}} Claire Bennet (Hayden Panettiere) is trying <b>to</b> <b>expose</b> The Company {{and that they will}} have to take drastic measures. Claire is packing up her father's files, when her boyfriend West Rosen arrives to try and stop her from revealing his secret. Angered, she gives him his file and breaks up with him. Noah returns home and tells Claire not <b>to</b> <b>expose</b> The Company, informing her that he has made a deal. He will work for them and in exchange his family will be left alone to lead normal lives.|$|E

30|$|In fact, we {{determined}} {{a significant positive}} relation between perceived distance <b>to</b> areas <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> coastal flooding and the under-assessment indicator across the study sites. We also show significant negative relationship between perceived distance and the indicator of similarity. When {{a significant relationship between}} the perceived distance <b>to</b> areas <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> coastal flooding and sketch mapping indicators was found, sketch mapping indicators were best explained by the perceived distance. Our results are supported by the study of O’Neill et al. (2016). To our knowledge, their study was the first to show the negative relationship between perceived distance to hazard zone and flood risk perception. Thus, as the perceived distance to hazard zone increased, flood risk perception decreased. In our study, {{we determined}} that the perceived distance <b>to</b> areas <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> coastal flooding {{is an important factor in}} assessing respondents’ sketch maps of the spatial extent of coastal flooding. In fact, as the perceived distance <b>to</b> areas <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> coastal flooding increased, respondents’ under-assessment of the spatial extent of coastal flooding increased. Moreover, as the perceived distance <b>to</b> areas <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> coastal flooding increased, the similarity between individuals’ perceptions of coastal flooding extent and expert estimations decreased.|$|R

5|$|The {{walls of}} one of the private {{chambers}} on the upper floor were covered with 16th century limewash which was removed in 1995, <b>to</b> <b>expose</b> a 13th-century wall painting with a depiction of Jesus on the cross and two other figures. The crucifixion scene with rosettes and vine leaf decoration was uncovered in the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Various {{non-governmental}} organizations participate in marine conservation activism, wherein they {{draw attention to}} and aid in various problems in marine conservation, such as pollution, whaling, bycatch, and so forth. Notable organizations include the Greenpeace who focus on overfishing and whaling among other things, and Sea Shepherd Conservation Society who are known for taking direct-action tactics <b>to</b> <b>expose</b> illegal activity.|$|E
5|$|A near-Earth {{supernova}} is {{a supernova}} {{close enough to}} the Earth to have noticeable effects on its biosphere. Depending upon the type and energy of the supernova, it could be as far as 3000light-years away. Gamma rays from a supernova would induce a chemical reaction in the upper atmosphere converting molecular nitrogen into nitrogen oxides, depleting the ozone layer enough <b>to</b> <b>expose</b> the surface to harmful ultraviolet solar radiation. This has been proposed as the cause of the Ordovician–Silurian extinction, which resulted in the death of nearly 60% of the oceanic life on Earth.|$|E

5|$|Acid2 {{is a test}} page {{published}} and promoted by the Web Standards Project <b>to</b> <b>expose</b> web page rendering flaws in web browsers and other applications that render HTML. Named after the acid test for gold, it {{was developed in the}} spirit of Acid1, a relatively narrow test of compliance with the Cascading Style Sheets 1.0 (CSS1) standard, and was released on 13 April 2005. As with Acid1, an application passes the test if the way it displays the test page matches a reference image.|$|E
5|$|As the {{cover-up}} begins, a copy-cat killing occurs, but McNulty quickly identifies and arrests the culprit. Pearlman tells McNulty and Freamon {{that they can}} no longer be allowed to do investigative work and warns of criminal charges if the scandal becomes public. They opt to retire. Haynes attempts <b>to</b> <b>expose</b> Templeton but the managing editors ignore the fabrications and demote anyone critical of their star reporter. Carcetti pressures Daniels to falsify crime statistics to aid his campaign. Daniels refuses and then quietly resigns rather than have his FBI file leaked.|$|E

5000|$|One of {{the major}} {{differences}} between lead-containing and lead-free solder pastes is the [...] "flow" [...] of the solder in its liquid state. Lead-containing solder has a lower surface tension, and tends to move slightly to attach itself <b>to</b> <b>exposed</b> metal surfaces that touch {{any part of the}} liquid solder. Lead-free solder conversely tends to stay in place where it is in its liquid state, and attaches itself <b>to</b> <b>exposed</b> metal surfaces only where the liquid solder touches it.|$|R
40|$|The intact intima of {{the rabbit}} {{abdominal}} aorta contained a well-defined, fairly continuous endothelial basement membrane {{and a network}} fo fine fibrils, which branched {{from both sides of}} the basement membrane. Partial ligation of the abdominal aorta of the rabbit resulted in endothelial desquamation, but left a layer of subendothelial fine fibrils and occasionally, segments of endothelial basement membrane. Platelets adhered <b>to</b> <b>exposed</b> fine fibrils including those extending from basement membrane fragments. Adhesion <b>to</b> occasionally <b>exposed</b> collagen fibres occurred but there was no direct adhesion <b>to</b> <b>exposed</b> internal elastic lamina or elastin fragments, for these elements were always covered by a thin layer of fine fibrils...|$|R
5|$|Despite having dark plumage in a {{tropical}} climate, frigatebirds have found ways not to overheat—particularly {{as they are}} exposed to full sunlight when on the nest. They ruffle feathers to lift them away from the skin and improve air circulation, and can extend and upturn their wings <b>to</b> <b>expose</b> the hot undersurface to the air and lose heat by evaporation and convection. Frigatebirds also place their heads in the shade of their wings, and males frequently flutter their gular pouches.|$|E
5|$|During combat, {{the player}} can circle the enemy <b>to</b> <b>expose</b> weak points and escape {{dangerous}} positions. Changing position temporarily stops the gauges charging. Likewise, enemies may change position {{to force the}} dragon into vulnerable areas; a radar {{at the bottom of}} the screen indicates safe, neutral and dangerous areas, with the front and rear areas typically posing the most danger. Weak points can sometimes only be attacked from dangerous areas, and enemies' attack patterns often change mid-battle, forcing the player to adapt.|$|E
5|$|Egwene begins <b>to</b> <b>expose</b> the Black Ajah {{among the}} rebels, {{requiring}} every sister to re-swear her allegiances. Fifty sisters are exposed and executed, while twenty {{are able to}} escape. Taking advantage of the weakened White Tower defenses following the Seanchan raid, the rebels prepare an immediate attack. Just before the attack is mounted, the Tower Aes Sedai announce that Elaida was captured in the Seanchan raid, {{and that they would}} have Egwene as their leader, the Amyrlin Seat. The rebels return and they begin rebuilding the Tower.|$|E

5|$|Gasteroid {{fruit body}} types are either roughly spherical or tuberous, {{occasionally}} with stipes, and {{usually have a}} peridium that is either simple or multi-layered. Mature gasteroid fruit bodies generally open irregularly at maturity <b>to</b> <b>expose</b> a powdery gleba with a color ranging from white to yellow or black-brown to black. Capillitia are generally absent from the gleba. Spores are spherical or nearly so, and have a surface texture that ranges from smooth to wart-like and spiny, or sometimes with reticulations. Hyphae have clamp connections.|$|E
5|$|He {{appeared}} in the modestly acclaimed film Apt Pupil, which was directed by Bryan Singer and based on a story by Stephen King. McKellen portrayed a fugitive Nazi officer, living under a false name in the US, who is befriended by a curious teenager (Brad Renfro) who threatens <b>to</b> <b>expose</b> him unless he tells his story in detail. He was subsequently nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor {{for his role in}} the 1998 film Gods and Monsters, wherein he played James Whale, the director of Show Boat (1936) and Frankenstein.|$|E
5|$|His {{body was}} cut down {{after an hour}} by the hangman, John Foxton, who claimed Corder's {{trousers}} and stockings according to his rights. The body was taken back to the courtroom at Shire Hall, where it was slit open along the abdomen <b>to</b> <b>expose</b> the muscles. The crowds were allowed to file past until six o'clock, when the doors were shut. According to the Norwich and Bury Post, over 5,000 people queued to see the body.|$|E
50|$|Further Johannessen {{found that}} levels of IL-6 were reduced <b>to</b> 90% when <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> 25 μg/mL {{citrinin}} (CTN) and <b>to</b> 40% when <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> 50 μg/mL. Levels of IL-8 and cell viability were also reduced to 80% and 20% when <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> respectively 25 and 50 μg/mL CTN for 72 hours. These {{results show that}} pleiotropic cytokine TGFβ1 and pro-inflammatory cytokines were (slightly) decreased when <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> increasing doses of CTN. IL-6 and IL-8 however remained mostly at non-toxic concentrations.|$|R

5|$|In {{her first}} year of service, Australia visited as many major Australian ports as {{possible}}, <b>to</b> <b>expose</b> the new navy to the widest possible audience and induce feelings of nationhood: naval historian David Stevens claims that these visits did more to break down state rivalries and promote the unity of Australia as a federated commonwealth than any other event. During late 1913, footage for the film Sea Dogs of Australia was filmed aboard the battlecruiser; the film was withdrawn almost immediately after first screening in August 1914 because of security concerns.|$|E
