40|$|The {{activated}} partial thromboplastin {{time after}} heparin removal (aPTT/HR) is an anionexchange procedure that permits the unobstructed monitoring of the progress of coumarin anticoagulation by removing interfering heparin.

40|$|In {{congenital}} factor VII deficiency {{the clinical}} picture {{is related to}} the levels of factor VII coagulant activity; when factor VII:C levels are very low the bleeding episodes can occur frequently.

40|$|Adequate classifications of {{disorders}} are {{of paramount importance}} {{in the management of}} congenital bleeding disorders. Classification of congenital FVII deficiency should be simple, based on few tests using thromboplastins of different origin. The first thromboplastin to be used is a rabbit brain preparation since it has been proven that this is the one that, overall, yields the lowest activity level. This is particularly so since molecular biology techniques have supplied important information with regard to the structure–function relation but have failed to supply a satisfactory classification of the defect. Mutations in the same domain have yielded different forms of FVII deficiency. Furthermore, molecular biology techniques are time consuming and are not feasible in every laboratory. A classification of FVII deficiency based on clinical, clotting, and immunological assays is proposed. This classi-fication is suited for practical clinical purposes and may represent a useful preparatory basis for molecular biology studies.

Normal FVII activity is obtained using human placenta thromboplastin but low activity using rabbit or bovine brain thromboplastin. Exons 2 - 8 and the intron-exon junctions of the FVII genes of the propositus were amplified by PCR from DNA extracted from peripheral white blood cells, and screened by single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis. DNA fragments showing aberrant mobility were cloned and sequenced. We detected a single-point mutation, a homozygous G to A transition at nucleotide position 6, 055 in exon 4, {{which results in}} the substitution of Arg 79 by Gln in the first EGF-like domain.

Factor VII antigen levels were also found to be reduced (mean 45. 5 U/dl; SD 7. 8) in 13 of them. These figures were compared with those of 50 normals and 28 obligatory heterozygotes for F VII deficiency. The phenotypical behaviors in the propositi were found to be equal to those of the F VII congenital deficiency heterozygotes: the discrepant one (VII+) and the nondiscrepant one (VII-/R). Fifteen families of the propositi could also be studied, totalling 55 additional individuals; in 25 of them (ten pedigrees) a mild F VII deficiency was found showing the same phenotypical features of the corresponding propositi. We therefore believe that these individuals with mild F VII deficiency can be considered as heterozygotes for the defect, since the other vitamin K-dependent clotting factors were normal; the defect is transmitted throughout the kindred with the same mode of inheritance as F VII congenital deficiency; and F VII:C and F VII:Ag levels are highly comparable with those of known obligatory heterozygotes for F VII deficiency. On the grounds of a careful statistical analysis we propose a formula which allows a discrimination between the two phenotypes of the heterozygotes for F VII congenital deficiency.

When hirudin {{was added to}} undisturbed blood it prevented platelet release as well as fibrin I formation. In contrast, hirudin added to agitated blood {{had little effect on}} platelet release despite complete inhibition of fibrin I formation. Collagen added to either undisturbed or agitated blood increased platelet release and then fibrin I formation, and ADP added to undisturbed blood caused an initial burst of platelet release followed by slight acceleration of fibrinopeptide A cleavage. Prostaglandin E 1 and theophylline prevented platelet release in both undisturbed and agitated blood, but did not affect fibrin I formation. The results with inhibitors in agitated blood suggest that fibrin I formation and platelet release can occur independently {{in the presence of the}} increased interactions induced by agitation. Addition of thrombin or <b>tissue</b> <b>thromboplastin</b> to undisturbed blood accelerated fibrin I formation with little effect on platelet release.

40|$|Factor VII (FVII) {{deficiency}} {{is one of}} the two congenital coagulation disorders {{that was}} not discovered by the description of a new bleeding patient whose clotting pattern did not fit the blood coagulation knowledge of the time (the other is factor XIII deficiency). The existence of an additional factor capable of accelerating the conversion of prothrombin into thrombin was suspected before 1951, the year in which the first family with FVII deficiency was discovered. As several investigators were involved in the discovery of FVII deficiency {{from both sides of the}} Atlantic, several different names were tentatively suggested to define this entity, namely stable factor (in contrast with labile factor or FV), cothromboplastin, proconvertin, serum prothrombin conversion accelerator, prothrombin acceleration, and autoprothrombin I. The last term was proposed by those who denied the existence of this new entity, which was instead considered to be a derivate of prothrombin activation, namely autoprothrombin. The description of several families, from all over the world, of the same defect, however clearly demonstrated the singularity of the condition. Factor VII was then proposed to define this protein. In subsequent years, several variants were described with peculiar reactivity toward <b>tissue</b> <b>thromboplastins</b> of different origin. Molecular biology techniques demonstrated several gene mutations, usually missense mutations, often involving exon 8 of the FVII gene. Later studies dealt with the relation of FVII with tissue factor and activated FVII (FVIIa). The evaluation of circulating FVIIa was made possible by the use of a truncated form of tissue factor, which is only sensitive to FVIIa present in the circulation. The development of FVII concentrates, both plasma derived and recombinant, has facilitated therapeutic management of FVII-deficient patients. The use of FVIIa concentrates was noted to be associated with the occasional occurrence of thrombotic events, mainly venous. Total or partial liver transplants have been performed with success in these patients and have “cured” their deficiencies. Prenatal diagnosis has also been performed and recent research involves the development of inhibitors of FVII[*]+[*]tissue factor complex or of FVIIa. This approach, if successful, could provide another antithrombotic therapeutics tool.

We provide evidence that this elevated risk for coagulation may be related to increased proportions of monocytes expressing cell surface <b>tissue</b> factor (TF, <b>thromboplastin)</b> in persons with HIV infection. Monocyte TF expression could be induced in vitro by lipopolysaccharide and flagellin, but not by interleukin- 6.

40|$|Semen {{contains}} enzymes and inhibitors of the haemostatic {{system as}} well as the high molecular weight seminal vesicle (HMW-SV) proteins. The former may have roles in seminal clotting and in liquefaction through “fibrinolytic” activity, which may ultimately affect fertility. Although a limited number of studies have addressed the subject, the role of clotting and fibrinolytic factors in semen remains poorly understood. The liquefaction time and the distribution of components vary across split ejaculates. This may have an important bearing on the way clotting/fibrinolytic factors in semen are assessed. Semen contains <b>tissue</b> factor (TF, <b>Thromboplastin,</b> CD 142), which originates from the prostate and is associated with prostasomes. The function of TF (and prostasomes) in semen is still a matter for speculation. Recently the presence of minute amounts of factor VII in semen has been demonstrated but its importance is uncertain. Semen also contains a thrombin-like enzyme, prothrombin fragments 1 and 2 (F 1 + 2), D-dimer (DD) and thrombin-antithrombin (TAT) complexes. The presence of several fibrinolytic factors has been demonstrated in semen but few questions about their potential impact on semen quality have been raised. Factors found include tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA), urinary plasminogen activator (u-PA) and plasmin. There are also traces of fibrinogen, plasminogen, plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1 (PAI- 1), factor VIII coagulant activity (VIII:c) and fibrin monomers. The co-ordinate expression of both TF and PAI- 1 by decidual cells of the endometrium is believed to be important in maintaining haemostasis during endovascular trophoblast invasion. Kallikrein-like serine protease inhibitors including prostate specific antigen (PSA) are known to be present in semen at high concentrations. In semen PSA is also found in a complex form with protein C inhibitor (PCI) with mutually inhibitory consequences. A better understanding of the spectrum of coagulating and liquefaction agents in semen to include classical haemostatic processes and the pathogenesis resulting from any imbalances between or within either system may provide the basis for the development of more selective and efficient agents affecting global fertility.

In addition, there are conflicting reports of Factor VII assays on serum from patients with coagulation abnor-malities (4 - 7). Such variations might be technical but could also depend upon the disorder stud-ied. Therefore, the development of increased Fac-tor VII activity during clotting of blood from var-ious patients, encompassing most known coagu-lation disorders, has been investigated. Using a standardized technique, it was found that some clotting factors are necessary for the development of increased Factor VII activity, while others ap-pear to be unnecessary...|$|E
40|$|The {{significance}} of anticardiolipin antibodies and the lupus anticoagulant was studied in 58 consecutive patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. On 85 occasions serum IgG and IgM anticardiolipin antibodies were measured by an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and simultaneous plasma samples tested for lupus anticoagulant activity. The most significant association with clinical events (previous thrombosis or thrombocytopenia occurring in 11 / 58 patients) was with prolonged <b>tissue</b> <b>thromboplastin</b> inhibition time (TTIT) followed by prolonged kaolin cephalin clotting time (KCCT) then raised IgG anticardiolipin antibody concentrations and dilute Russell's viper venom time. Although IgG anticardiolipin antibodies or KCCT {{were the most}} sensitive tests in identifying this group, the TTIT was the most specific (98 %). Nine patients were IgG anticardiolipin antibody positive and lupus anticoagulant negative, of whom one had thrombocytopenia but none had thrombosis. The presence of a lupus anticoagulant in anticardiolipin antibody positive patients increases specificity for certain adverse clinical events...|$|E
40|$|We have {{investigated}} here the coordinate expression of both procoagulant (PCA) and fibrinolytic (FA) activity of cells from 16 human ovarian carcinoma cases. To avoid interference of contaminating host cells, we used cells isolated in primary culture from ascitic fluid or from solid tumor. The FA was determined in cellular extracts by an amidolytic assay {{in the presence}} of fibrin monomers. FA, which was plasminogen dependent in almost all of the cases, showed a wide range of activity (from less than 0. 001 to 2. 30 UK units/mg protein). The molecular analysis of plasminogen activator (by SDS-PAGE and fibrin autography) showed a single molecular form of 52, 000 daltons, inhibited by an antibody against human urokinase. PCA, studied with a one stage clotting assay in disrupted cells, was of <b>tissue</b> <b>thromboplastin</b> type in all instance and varied from 12. 0 to 1300 thromboplastin units/ 10 (4) cells. No simple correlation was found between FA and PCA in the cellular samples studied; moreover, for neither parameter was it possible to find any changes with the staging of the disease...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: HELLP {{syndrome}} (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelets) {{has a high}} {{fetal mortality}} and maternal morbidity, partly due to its late diagnosis. In order to facilitate earlier diagnosis, we studied the changes occurring in natural coagulation inhibitors, fibronectin and haptoglobin as potential early markers of endothelial damage, coagulation cascade activation and intravascular hemolysis. METHODS: The study compared antithrombin (AT-III), protein C and S activity, plasma fibronectin, 'prothrombin time' and 'partial prothrombin time' (AST, ALT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), bilirubin and serum haptoglobin in 17 asymptomatic controls, 19 preeclampsia patients and 11 HELLP syndrome patients. RESULTS: HELLP syndrome patients had higher fibronectin and D-dimer values, lower AT-III and protein C activity, a lower platelet count and higher LDH than healthy controls; only 25 % had raised bilirubin. Serum haptoglobin was lower in HELLP syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Early on in HELLP syndrome, there is probably a pro-coagulatory imbalance in the placental microcirculation. Endothelial damage causes <b>tissue</b> <b>thromboplastin</b> release and coagulation cascade activation due to collagen exposure; the vascular lesion increases thromboplastin in the bloodstream and triggers distant coagulation processes, suggesting compensated disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. Measuring plasma fibronectin and coagulation inhibitors should be supported by testing haptoglobin as a marker of intravessel hemolysis to differentiate conventional preeclampsia from HELL...|$|E
