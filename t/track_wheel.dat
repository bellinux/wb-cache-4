40|$|AbstractAt present, the {{application}} of pipelines in industries is becoming more severe. The application is not limited for home application only but it can stretch up to thousands of kilometers across countries. Pipelines are used to transport water, sewage, flammable liquid, high pressure gasses and oil. In order to ensure efficient pipelines performance, the pipelines need to undergo routine monitoring, maintenance and repairing activities. However, {{due to the nature}} of pipelines that are long, interconnected, and sometimes buried underground or far beneath the sea make it hard to accomplish the tasks. Relying on human labor for the cleaning and maintenance process is not efficient, not safe and not economical. Therefore, there is a strong demand for a robot that can help the cleaning and repairing process in the pipelines. The main aim of this research is to produce an in-pipe robot. This paper will specifically discuss about the development of hardware and software of <b>track</b> <b>wheel</b> for in-pipe robot application. The Caterpillar concept has been chosen to be considered for further development. The Caterpillar that is equipped with special made <b>track</b> <b>wheel</b> is able to move and also climb in pipelines. The scope of this project is limited to 14 ” inner diameter of UPVC pipe. The development of the wheel track has followed a systematic engineering design process. Experiments have been conducted to validate the software and hardware. As a result, the developed <b>track</b> <b>wheel</b> successfully climbed up to 300 without skidding or slipping. Consequently, the designed <b>track</b> <b>wheel</b> can be considered to be applied as locomotion of the in-pipe robot. The <b>track</b> <b>wheel</b> can be used to move, climb and maneuver the robot in the pipeline smoothly...|$|E

In this paper, the tuning fuzzy Vector Field Orientation (FVFO) feedback control method is proposed for a four <b>track</b> <b>wheel</b> skid-steered mobile robot (4 -TW SSMR) using flexible fuzzy logic control (FLC). The extended Kalman filter is utilized to estimate the positions, velocities and orientation angles, which are used for feedback control signals in the FVFO method, based on the AHRS kinematic motion model and velocity constraints. In addition, in light of the wheel slip and the braking ability of the robot, we propose a new method for estimating online wheel slip parameters based on a discrete Kalman filter to compensate for the velocity constraints. As demonstrated by our experimental results, the advantages of the combination of the proposed FVFO and wheel slip estimation methods overcome the limitations of the others in the trajectory tracking control problem for a 4 -TW SSMR...|$|E

A power-assisted hemiplegic (one-sided paralysis) wheelchair was developed that can effectively be propelled with one arm while remaining maneuverable, lightweight, and foldable.

A controls program was developed that analyzes wheel position and steering to respond to the motion of the hand-driven wheel. Extensive testing was performed to ensure design integrity.

Cataloged from PDF version of thesis report. Includes bibliographical references (page 52). This project presents in detail an electrically operated mechanical robotic system based on an animated character of Pixar’s WALL-E (2008). The replica’s boxy physical structure is built using plywood mounted on top of <b>track</b> <b>wheel</b> which is a complex mechanical combination of parts like teethed wheel, metallic frames and some soft PVC wood casted shapes driven by 2 independent single shaft geared DC motor. The movements of the arms and neck are attained {{with the help of}} servo-motors. This sophisticated entertainment robot has features like its head pivots realistically; movement of different body parts, and also some supplementary enhancements incorporated such as giving WALL-E some vocal through audio system. The main focus of our work is developing a life-size meticulous Arduino-based entertainment robot entirely from custom-fabricated parts with distinctive features which can be controlled wirelessly, motivated from the animated character and as a constant reminder of how we should deal with our technologies without hampering the regular order of our personal and sociocultural life, we strived for building a life-size robotic structure of WALL-E to keep our conscience ever functional.

40|$|Higher spatial {{resolution}} imaging data is always desirable {{to the international}} community of planetary scientists interested in improving understanding of surface formation processes. We have previously developed a novel Super-resolution restoration (SRR) technique (Tao & Muller, 2016) using Gotcha sub-pixel matching, orthorectification, and segmented 4 th order PDE-TV, called GPT SRR, which is able to restore 5  cm- 12. 5  cm near rover scale images (equivalent to Navcam projected FoV at a range of ≥  5  m) from multiple 25  cm resolution NASA MRO HiRISE images. The SRR technique has been successfully applied to the rover traverses for the MER and MSL missions within the EU FP- 7 PRoViDE project. These SRR results have revealed new surface information including the imaging of individual rocks (diameter ≥  25  cm) by comparison of the original HiRISE image and rover Navcam orthorectified image mosaics. In this work, we seek evidence from processing {{a very large number of}} stereo reconstruction results from all Navcam stereo images within PRoViDE, registration and comparison with the corresponding SRR image, in order to derive a quantitative assessment on key features including rocks (diameter <  150  cm) and rover <b>track</b> <b>wheel</b> spacing. We summarise statistics from SRR-Navcam measurements and demonstrate that our unique SRR datasets will greatly support the geological and morphological analysis and monitoring of Martian surface and can also be applied to landing site selection, in order to avoid unsuitable terrain, for any future lander/rover as well as help to define future rover paths...|$|E

For small radius curves, where wear is the dominating damage mechanism, an increase in the level of lateral irregularities leads to a transition towards a mixed RCF/wear regime for the outer (high) rail. The influence of wheel and rail geometries on degradation is studied by parametrisation of wheel/rail geometries, employing a design of experiments scheme to the multibody simulations that determine degradation, and finally by deriving meta-models through regression analysis. The meta-models link estimated degradation magnitudes to key geometric parameters. The advantage of the meta-models is that degradation magnitudes can be evaluated with a very low computational cost. This has the benefit that measured wheel and rail profiles can be ranked based on how detrimental they are. Examples are presented for altered gauge corner and flange root geometries, and also for hollow worn wheels. A field study of RCF of locomotive wheels shows its strong dependence on operational conditions. Seasonal variations in the number of wheel reprofilings are explained in terms of seasonal variations in weather conditions, lubrication practices and rail grinding. </p...|$|E
