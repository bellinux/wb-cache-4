40|$|We studied 35 Cretaceous {{limestone}} specimens {{from five}} Pacific plate Deep Sea Drilling Project sites. Inclination IN {{of the natural}} remanence is on average 17 ° shallower than the average 44 ° expected paleofield inclination I. Anhysteretic remanence (ARM) applied identically to various axes {{was found to be}} weakest (ARMmin) perpendicular to bedding and strongest (ARMmax) parallel to <b>bedding.</b> <b>The</b> average ARMmin/ARMmax of 0. 87 as well as the inclination shallowing of 17 ° likely originated from sediment compaction rotating the long axes of magnetite grains <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedding</b> plane. This origin is theoretically and experimentally consistent with the average fractional compaction of 0. 6 experienced by our sediments (estimated from their porosity). A compaction origin is also supported by the significant correlation found between tan IN/tan I and ARMmin/ARMmax. The correlation line's slope of 2. 3 ± 0. 7 agrees with theory, taking into account our observation that ARM given perpendicular to the long axes of magnetite grains has on average ∼ 0. 37 times the intensity of ARM given axially. These results suggest that compaction-induced inclination shallowing may be detected in a suite of fine-grained magnetite-bearing sediments by looking for a correlation between tan IN and ARMmin/ARMmax (having shown that ARM anisotropy is foliated in <b>the</b> <b>bedding</b> plane). This correlation line's prediction of IN when ARMmin/ARMmax = 1 should estimate I corrected for inclination shallowing. ...|$|R

40|$|Clay {{minerals}} {{recovered from}} the Galapagos hydrothermal mounds (Holes 506 C, 507 D, and 509 B) are mainly iron-rich nontronite-like minerals enriched in potassium. Nontronites from Hole 509 B show a distinct tendency to become micaceous <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> lower <b>beds</b> of clay sediments. Mn-crusts consist mainly of todorokite or a mixture of todorokite and nontronite. Minerals of clay and Mnrich sediments in the mounds originated from hydrothermal solutions of uncertain origin.

Clubbing occurs in stages {{over a long period}} of time and somepatients may not be aware of the changes and its significance. When a normal distal digit is viewed from the side, the angle made by the proximal nail fold and nail plate (Lovibond’s angle) is typically less than or equal to 160 °. In clubbing, Lovibond’s angle is increased and eventually progresses to an increase in the nail curvature with enlargement of the digit giving the drumstick appearance(Refer to Supplementary text).

2500|$|The {{portion of}} I-490 from exit15 {{southeast}} to the Can of Worms follows the original {{path of the}} Erie Canal through the city of Rochester. After the canal was rerouted to bypass Rochester in 1920, <b>the</b> former canal <b>bed</b> was purchased by the city for roughly $1.5million (equivalent to $ in [...] ).

The Rochester Subway, as it became known, began operation in 1927. As ridership on the line declined in the 1940s and early 1950s, the city elected to shut the subway down in 1956 and use the right-of-way for a new highway connecting the Inner Loop to the recently completed New York State Thruway south of Rochester.|$|R

50|$|Increasing {{environmental}} concentrations {{and changing}} distributions of PBDEs in sediments of the Clyde River Estuary in Scotland, UK have been assessed. Analysis of six sediment cores each of 1 m depth from Glasgow city to Greenock revealed that total concentrations of increased <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> river <b>bed</b> surface (0-10 cm). Amounts of PBDE ranged from 1 to 2,645 µg/kg (dry wt. sediment) {{with a mean}} of 287 µg/kg (dry wt. sediment). Down-core PBDE congener profiles showed that higher concentrations were due to elevated levels of BDE-209. The majority of the sediment records clearly showed a change from mainly lower molecular weight BDEs 47,99, 183, 153 at lower depths to BDE-209 near the surface, a change in congener and homologue group patterns that corresponds to the restrictions of penta- and octaBDE commercial mixtures under EU law in 2004-2006.|$|R

40|$|The {{behavior}} of turbulent open channel flows over permeable surfaces {{is not well}} understood. In particular, {{it is not clear}} how the surface and the subsurface flow within <b>the</b> permeable <b>bed</b> interact and influence each other. In order to clarify this issue we carried out two sets of experiments, one involving velocity measurements in open channel flows over an impermeable bed composed of a single layer of spheres, and another one where velocities were measured over and within a permeable bed made of five such layers. Comparison of surface flow velocity statistics between the two sets of experiments confirmed that bed permeability can significantly affect flow resistance. It was also confirmed that even in the hydraulically rough regime, the friction factors for <b>the</b> permeable <b>bed</b> increase with increasing Reynolds number. Such an increase in flow resistance implies a different distribution of normal form-induced stress between the permeable and impermeable bed cases. Subsurface flow measurements performed within <b>the</b> permeable <b>bed</b> revealed that there is an intense transport of turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) occurring from the surface to the subsurface flow. We provide evidence that the transport of TKE <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> lower <b>bed</b> levels is driven mainly by pressure fluctuations, whereas TKE transport due to turbulent velocity fluctuations is limited to a thinner layer placed in the upper part of <b>the</b> <b>bed.</b> It was also confirmed that the turbulence imposed by the surface flow gradually dissipates while penetrating within the porous medium. Dissipation occurs faster for the small scales than for the large ones, which instead are persistent, although weak, even at <b>the</b> lowest <b>bed</b> level...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. Fourteen englacial {{conduits}} were mapped within 2 km of the terminus of the temperate Matanuska Glacier, Alaska, USA, to ice {{depths of}} 65 m using speleological techniques. Detailed threedimensional {{maps of the}} conduits were made over 3 years to characterize conduit relationships with glacier structural features and to track conduit evolution through time. All conduits consisted of single unbranching passages that followed fractures in the ice. All conduits were either too constricted to continue or became water-filled at their deepest explored point and {{were not able to}} be followed to <b>the</b> glacier <b>bed.</b> Conduit morphology varied systematically with the orientation of the glacier principal stresses, allowing them to be categorized into two broad classes. The first class of conduits were formed by hydrostatic crevasse penetration where a large supraglacial stream intersected longitudinal crevasses. These conduits plunged <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> glacier <b>bed</b> at angles of 30 – 408. The second class of conduits formed where smaller streams sank into the glacier on shear crevasses. Many of these conduits changed direction dramatically where they intersected transverse crevasses at depth. These results suggest that the conduits observed in this study formed along fractures and, over their surveyed length, were not affected by gradients in ice overburden pressure...|$|R
