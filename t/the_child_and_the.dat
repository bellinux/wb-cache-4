5|$|Another tradition, {{related by}} R.C. MacLeod, told of certain events {{which took place}} after an heir to the clan's chiefship was born. The story related how at this time, there was much rejoicing at Dunvegan Castle, and since the infant's nursemaid was anxious {{to join in the}} festivities in the hall below, she left the infant alone in her room. When the baby awoke, crying of cold, no human help could hear him in his secluded room; however, a host of fairies {{appeared}} and wrapped the infant in the Fairy Flag. Meanwhile, the clansmen banqueting below demanded to see <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> maid was ordered to bring him forth. When she brought out the baby, wrapped in the flag, everyone gazed in wonder at <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> garb wrapped around him. The room was filled with the fairies' song which declared that the flag had the power to save the clan three times. When the song ended, and silence fell across the crowded room, the flag was taken from the infant and locked in a chest where it has ever since been preserved.|$|E
5|$|A three-year {{civil war}} {{followed}} his death. By the Treaty of Verdun (843), a kingdom between the Rhine and Rhone rivers {{was created for}} Lothair to go with his lands in Italy, and his imperial title was recognised. Louis the German was in control of Bavaria and the eastern lands in modern-day Germany. Charles the Bald received the western Frankish lands, comprising most of modern-day France. Charlemagne's grandsons and great-grandsons divided their kingdoms between their descendants, eventually causing all internal cohesion to be lost. In 987 the Carolingian dynasty was replaced in the western lands, with the crowning of Hugh Capet (r. 987–996) as king. In the eastern lands the dynasty had died out earlier, in 911, {{with the death of}} Louis <b>the</b> <b>Child,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> selection of the unrelated Conrad I (r. 911–918) as king.|$|E

Dewey continually argues that education and learning are social and interactive processes, and thus the school itself is a social institution through which social reform can and should take place. In addition, he believed that students thrive {{in an environment where}} they are allowed to experience and interact with the curriculum, and all students should have the opportunity to take part in their own learning.|$|E
