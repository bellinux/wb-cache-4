5|$|American {{historian}} Richard Landes, {{who specializes}} {{in the history of}} apocalypticism and was co-founder and director of the Center for Millennial Studies at Boston University, argues that new and emerging technologies often trigger alarmism among millenarians and even the introduction of Gutenberg's printing press in 1436 caused waves of apocalyptic thinking. The Year 2000 problem, bar codes and Social Security numbers all triggered end-time warnings which either proved to be false or simply were no longer taken seriously once the public became accustomed to these technological changes. Civil libertarians argue that <b>the</b> <b>privatization</b> of surveillance {{and the rise of the}} surveillance-industrial complex in the United States does raise legitimate concerns about the erosion of privacy. However, skeptics of mass surveillance conspiracism caution that such concerns should be disentangled from secular paranoia about Big Brother or religious hysteria about the Antichrist.|$|E

In 2004 and 2005, Ryan pushed the Bush administration to propose <b>the</b> <b>privatization</b> of Social Security. His proposal ultimately failed {{when it did}} not gain {{the support of the}} then-Republican presidential administration. In 2005, Ryan and Senator John Sununu of New Hampshire introduced the Social Security Personal Savings Guarantee and Prosperity Act, also known as the Ryan-Sununu plan. The plan would have allowed employees to direct a portion of their Federal Insurance Contributions Act payroll tax on their wages to a private account which invested in a stock portfolio managed by the Social Security Administration. Versions of the plan were included in Ryan's later budget proposals.|$|E
5|$|Bernardo Grinspun, {{the first}} {{minister}} of the economy, arranged an increase in wages, reaching the levels of 1975. This caused inflation to reach 32%. He also tried to negotiate more favourable terms on the country's foreign debt, but the negotiations failed. Risking a default, he negotiated with the IMF, which requested spending cuts. International credits prevented default {{at the end of}} 1984, but he resigned in March 1985 when the debt reached $1billion and the IMF denied further credits. Grinspun was succeeded by Juan Vital Sourrouille, who designed the Austral plan. This plan froze prices and wages, stopped the printing of money, arranged spending cuts, and established a new currency, the Austral. The plan was a success in the short term, and choked inflation. Inflation rose again {{by the end of the}} year, the CGT opposed the wage freeze, and business community opposed the price freeze. Alfonsín thought that <b>the</b> <b>privatization</b> of some state assets and a deregulation of the economy might work, but those proposals were opposed by both the PJ and his own party.|$|E

5|$|Cavallo began {{a second}} wave of privatizations with the Correo Argentino and the nuclear power plants. He also limited {{the amount of money}} {{released}} to the provinces. He still had the full support of Menem, despite growing opposition within the PJ. The Mexican Tequila Crisis impacted the national economy, causing a deficit, recession, and a growth in unemployment. The government further reduced public expenditures, the wages of state workers, and raised taxes. The deficit and recession were reduced, but unemployment stayed high. External debt increased. The crisis also proved that the economic system was vulnerable to capital flight. The growing discontent over unemployment and the scandals caused by <b>the</b> <b>privatization</b> of the Correo led to Cavallo's removal as minister, and his replacement by Roque Fernández. Fernández maintained Cavallo's fiscal austerity. He increased the price of fuels, sold the state shares of YPF to Repsol, fired state employees, and increased the value-added tax to 21%. He also undertook more privatization. A new labor law was met with resistance, both by Peronists, opposition parties, and unions, and could not be approved by Congress. The 1997 Asian financial crisis and the 1998 Russian financial crisis also affected the country with consequences that lasted longer than the Tequilla Crisis and started a depression.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} ballot on November 2, 2004, Boustany and Mount {{garnered}} the most votes; Cravins {{was defeated by}} less than two thousand votes. As both fell short of a majority, a second ballot was mandated. In the subsequent campaign, Mount criticized Boustany for favoring {{tax cuts for the}} rich and being indifferent to health care, while Boustany rejected the attacks as false and stressed his willingness to work with Democrats and Independents. Boustany in turn portrayed Mount as liberal and favoring tax increases. Mount criticized Boustany for favoring <b>the</b> <b>privatization</b> of social security, an unpopular position in Louisiana, and as distant from the interests of individual voters. She received endorsements from U.S. Senator John Breaux, who had represented the 7th district for over fourteen years, and Governor Kathleen Blanco. Boustany was helped by Vice President Dick Cheney, who campaigned on his behalf in Lake Charles. Mount, however, was not endorsed by Democratic primary opponent Don Cravins, who complained about the state Democratic Party's endorsement of Mount in a partially party funded mailer that excluded him and which he believed contributed to his narrow loss. Cravins prepared a suit in federal court claiming that the state Democratic Party violated the Voting Rights Act.|$|E
