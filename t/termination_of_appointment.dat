As a descriptive research, the study population comprised the 481 secondary schools in Ondo State, Nigeria. This {{was made up of}} 281 public and 200 private schools as well as 210 urban and 272 rural schools. The sample consisted of 245 schools made up of 142 public and 103 private schools. Out of the 142 public schools, 62 were urban while 80 were rural schools. Out of the 103 private schools, 47 were urban while 56 were rural schools. Out of the 4250 teachers in the schools, 960 teachers were selected. The methods of selection were also by multi-stage and stratified random sampling techniques. The instrument used to collect data was a questionnaire while the data collected were analyzed using percentages, Person r product moment correlation and the t-test. The findings revealed that one major cause of examination malpractices in the schools was indiscipline among students that made many of them to be involved in examination malpractices. Other important causes include the non-implementation of the examination malpractices decree and the lack of effective supervision of students during examinations. It was recommended that concerted efforts should be made at improving the level of discipline among students through counseling services in the schools. There should be the full implementation of the examination malpractices decree. There should be increased efforts at effective supervision of students during examinations. The <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>appointment</b> of examination officials and teachers involved in perpetrating examination malpractices should be in force to serve as a deterrent to others...|$|E

He wrote sporadically for the Mackay Daily Mercury for many years and in 1932 published Literature by Languages: A Roll Call, a survey of world literature. His later publications included A Shakespeare or Two (1935), The Practice of Literary History (1936), Courses in Literary History (1938), Scrambled Scrutinies (1949), and Metrical Diversions of a Sexagenarian (1952). Amiet's diverse interests included astronomy and Australian literature. He opposed the White Australia policy during the 1930s and gave his support to recruitment drives during World War II. An agnostic, he died in 1959 at Mater Hospital, Mackay, of cardiorenal failure. The Amiet Memorial Library in Mackay is named for him.|$|R
40|$|This article replies to Professor Kalt's {{response}} to my opening article, "Senate <b>Termination</b> <b>of</b> Presidential Recess <b>Appointments.</b> " I argue that as a simple straight forward textual matter the Senate majority can terminate a presidential recess appointment by terminating their session, i. e., the session that meets following a presidential intersession recess appointment. If the president makes an intrasession recess appointment (assuming such things have any constitutional validity at all), the Senate can terminate that appointment too - by terminating the current session, immediately reassembling, and then terminating the new session! I do not argue that American history or the Constitution's structure support this position, nor do I feel inclined to do so, where as here, the text is reasonably clear. I do, however, marshal some policy arguments to support the textual argument, although I frankly acknowledge that these arguments should not control {{the meaning of a}} constitutional clause...|$|R

However, two years later, Mrs. Douglas-Hamilton died unexpectedly without having established the financial independence of the school that she had intended.
