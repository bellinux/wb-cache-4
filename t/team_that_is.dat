5|$|In clock-limited sports, games {{often end}} with a team that holds the lead killing the clock rather than {{competing}} aggressively against the opposing team. In contrast, baseball has no clock; a team cannot win without getting the last batter out and rallies are not constrained by time. At almost any turn in any baseball game, the most advantageous strategy is some form of aggressive strategy. In contrast, again, the clock comes into play even {{in the case of}} multi-day Test and first-class cricket: the possibility of a draw often encourages a <b>team</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> batting last and well behind to bat defensively, giving up any faint chance at a win to avoid a loss. Baseball offers no such reward for conservative batting.|$|E
