40|$|Surface {{cladding}} utilizes a {{high energy}} input to deposit a layer on substrate surfaces providing protection against wear and corrosion. In this work, TiC particulates were incorporated by melting single tracks in powder preplaced onto AISI 4340 {{low alloy steel}} surfaces using a Tungsten Inert Gas (<b>TIG)</b> <b>torch</b> {{with a range of}} processing conditions. The effects of energy input and powder content on the melt geometry, microstructure and hardness were investigated. The highest energy input (1680 J/mm) under the <b>TIG</b> <b>torch</b> produced deeper (1. 0 mm) and wider melt pools, associated with increased dilution, compared to that processed at the lowest energy (1008 J/mm). The melt microstructure contained partially melted TiC particulates associated with dendritic, cubic and globular type carbides precipitated upon solidification of TiC dissolved in the melt; TiC accumulated more near to the melt-matrix interface and at the track edges. Addition of 0. 4, 0. 5 and 1. 0 mg/mm 2 TiC gave hardness values in the resolidified melt pools between 750 to over 1100 Hv, against a base hardness of 300 Hv; hardness values are higher in tracks processed with a grcater TiC addition and reduced energy input...|$|E

A noninvasive fiber sensor embedded within a <b>TIG</b> <b>torch</b> collects the plasma radiation originated during the welding process. The spectral information is then processed in two consecutive stages. A compression algorithm is first applied to the data, allowing real-time analysis. The selected spectral bands are then used to feed a classification algorithm, which will be demonstrated to provide an efficient weld defect detection and classification.

Empirical analysis indicated that, though both the grain refining conditions reduced the sensitization width relative to the conventional weld, the width was virtually nil with cryogenic cooling suggesting the elimination or reduction of sensitization. Similarly, the microstructure of cryogenically cooled welds showed no ditched grain boundary but aluminum powder treated welds revealed extensive ditching and none in titanium treated welds while knifeline attack was observed in welds treated with the mixture of aluminum and titanium powders...|$|E

30|$|Another way to {{introduce}} activating elements is utilizing gas containing active elements. For ferroalloys, activating elements, such as oxygen and sulfur, can decrease the surface tension of molten metal and reverse Marangoni convection flow, eventually obtain {{a much deeper}} weld depth. Accordingly, Heiple and Burgardt [25] added {{a small amount of}} SO 2 into the argon shielding gas and obtained obviously increased weld penetration. Fujii et al. [26, 27] developed an Advanced A-TIG (AA-TIG) welding method to prevent oxidation consumption of the tungsten electrode by using a double shielding gas torch instead of the normal <b>TIG</b> welding <b>torch.</b> An assisted <b>TIG</b> arc with Ar+O 2 or Ar+CO 2 mixed shielding gas and low current was used by Fan and Huang [28 – 30] to form a thin oxide layer {{to introduce}} oxygen element before the common TIG welding and dramatically increase weld penetration in the end.

40|$|Tungsten Inert Gas welding {{is a very}} {{effective}} welding process widely used in many industries for joining of sheets, stainless steel pipes, automobile parts and many other manufacturing processes. This welding process has an additional advantage of protecting the weld bead {{with the help of}} shielding gas or inert gas which avoids the oxidation of the bead, making the joint wear resistant and slag free. This has increased the demand of TIG welding extensively. Generally, it is done manually by holding filler rod in one hand and the <b>TIG</b> <b>torch</b> with other. Thus, the process requires a high amount of skill and human labor. Automation of TIG welding will not only reduce human labor but also improve accuracy. The project aims to develop and design an automated filler rod feeding system for TIG welding. To fulfil this purpose, a number of mechanisms are considered namely rack-pinion mechanism, slider-crank mechanism and screw-nut mechanism. The advantages and limitations of each mechanism are weighed against each other to decide the best mechanism that can be implemented. The mechanism is then designed and fabricated so as to fulfil the objectives of the project. It has also been ensured that the product at the completion of this project is industry oriented and has commercial value. After a rigorous analysis of the different mechanisms possible, screw and nut mechanism was chosen to be fabricated. The feeding of the filler rod is coordinated with the movement of the <b>TIG</b> <b>torch.</b> The suggested mechanism is one of its first in this particular field and can prove to be a worthy replacement of the presently used wire-feeding arrangement. With proper research in this area, it can be expected that better mechanisms and arrangements will emerge or materializ...|$|E

Parameter such as heat input of the torch was varied between 540, 608 and 675 J/mm and its effect on the resolidified melt pool was studied. Glazing under all energy inputs produced more than 1 mm thick resolidified clad layer. The microstructural analysis revealed the clad layer with dispersion of dendrites of Ti-Al nitrides and Ti-Al intermetallic in ferrite matrix. The concentration of dendrites were found to be maximum near the surface and decreased at deeper depths.

In this work, two different amounts of TiC powder of nominal size 45 to 100 µm were embedded on AISI 4340 steel surfaces by melting under a Tungsten Inert Gas (<b>TIG)</b> welding <b>torch</b> with an energy input of 2640 J/mm. The microstructure, geometry and hardness {{of the single}} track composite layers were investigated. The resolidified melt tracks were hemispherical in shape. With increasing TiC content, the melt dimensions reduced a little but the microstructure had a remarkable change. The track with 1. 5 mg/mm 2 TiC gave more un-melted TiC, partially melted TiC and agglomeration of ceramic particulates while the 1. 0 mg/mm 2 track dissolved most TiC particulates and precipitated carbides {{in the form of}} dendrite, globular and flower type particles; dendrites are almost absent in the 1. 5 mg/mm 2 track. A reduced TiC addition created more fluid melt which accelerated dissolution of TiC and that caused more carbide precipitation in the 1. 0 mg/mm 2 track compared to that with 1. 5 mg/m...|$|R

This study was carried out to investigate the hardness behaviour of low alloy steel (LAS) surface modified with TiC under a tungsten inert gas (<b>TIG)</b> arc <b>torch.</b> The effects of welding current, traversing speed, arc voltage and argon flow rate on surface hardness during the surface alloying treatment were analyzed using Taguchi’s experimental design. The hardness behaviour of the TIG-processed composite coating was assessed with a Wilson Wolpert microhardness machine. The analysis of the experimental results based on the Taguchi’s design revealed that the welding speed and welding voltage are the most significant process parameters influencing the surface hardness performance of the composite coated layer. The signal-to-noise response was used to identify the optimum parameter combination for maximizing the surface quality characteristics.

40|$|The {{use of a}} {{tungsten}} {{inert gas}} (<b>TIG)</b> welding <b>torch</b> {{has resulted in the}} development of an economical route for surface engineering of alloys, giving similar results to the more expensive high power laser. Due to the preheating generated by both techniques, the extent of the temperature rise is sufficient to produce significant changes to the melt dimensions, microstructure and properties between the first and last tracks melted during the coating of a complete surface. The present study examines if similar changes can occur between the start and finish locations of a single track of 50 mm length. The results show that for a TIG melted surface of a microalloy steel substrate, with or without incorporating preplaced SiC particles, in either argon or argon-helium environments, a maximum temperature of 375 °C developed in the second third of the track. Even over this short distance, a hardness decrease of > 300 Hv was recorded in the re-solidified SiC coated substrate melt zone, microstructure of a cast iron with cracks were observed. Also porosity was found in all the tracks, with and without preplaced SiC powders...|$|R

An exploratory research is conducted to form a composite coating on AISI 4340 steel surfaces by incorporating a mixture of TiC and hexagonal Boron Nitride (h-BN) particulates using powder placement and <b>TIG</b> <b>torch</b> melting techniques. Initial results show the evidence of TiC incorporation in all tracks but the presence of h-BN is limited in a few tracks. However, processing conditions are identified that can produce composite coatings incorporating both TiC and h-BN particulates. The melt microstructure consists of {{a small amount of}} un-melted TiC and h-BN, partially melted TiC particulates with eutectic structure containing precipitated TiC and TiB 2 particles. Hardness of the coating is found to fluctuate along the melt depth. However, the maximum hardness of the coating is about 3 times the base hardness of 250 HV...|$|E

The melt microstructure consisted of both undissolved and partially dissolved TiC particulates, together {{with a variety of}} morphologies and sizes of TiC particles precipitated during solidification. Preheating, resulting from the overlapping operation occurred, producing additional melting of the TiC particulates and deeper melt depths but with a reduced volume fraction of TiC precipitates in the subsequent tracks.

40|$|Titanium alloys are {{attractive}} in aerospace applications for low density and good mechanical properties {{but they have}} poor in oxidation and wear resistance. A coating layer of titanium aluminide can mitigate these problems to some extent and make the alloys suitable for hot structure applications. This paper discusses the formation of titanium aluminide coatings on commercial purity titanium (CPTi) surfaces by melting a pre-placed aluminium and titanium powder mixture, using a tungsten inert gas (<b>TIG)</b> welding <b>torch.</b> Depending on powder composition and energy input, the resolidified melt layer produced a single phase a 2 -Ti 3 Al or a dual phase a 2 and y-TiAl microstructures of lamellar or columnar dendritic types.

40|$|The Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) {{consists}} of 1080 conical tubes, which are furnace brazed themselves, manifolds, and surrounding structural jacket making almost four miles of braze joints. Subsequent furnace braze cycles are performed due to localized braze voids between the coolant tubes. SSME nozzle experiences extremely high heat flux (180 mW/sq m) during hot fire. Braze voids between coolant tubes {{may result in}} hot combustion gas escape causing jacket bulges. The nozzle can be disqualified for flight or result in mission failure if the braze voids exceed the limits. Localized braze processes were considered to eliminate braze voids, however, damage to the parent materials often prohibited use of such process. Being the only manned flight reusable rocket engine, it has stringent requirement on the braze process. Poor braze quality or damage to the parent materials limits the nozzle service life. The objective {{of this study was}} to develop a laser brazing process to provide quality, localized braze joints without adverse affect on the parent materials. Gold (Au-Cu-Ni-Pd-Mn) based high temperature braze alloys were used in both powder and wire form. Thin section iron base superalloy A 286 tube was used as substrate materials. Different Laser Systems including CO 2 (10. 6 micrometers, 1 kW), ND:YAG (1. 06 micrometers, 4 kW). and direct diode laser (808 nm. 150 W) were investigated for brazing process. The laser process variables including wavelength. laser power, travel speed and angle of inclination were optimized according to bead geometry and braze alloy wetting at minimum heat input level, The properties of laser brazing were compared to that of furnace brazing. Microhardness profiles were used for braze joint property comparison between laser and furnace brazing. The cooling rate of laser brazing was compared to furnace brazing based on secondary dendritic arm spacing, Both optical and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) were used to evaluate the microstructures of the braze materials and tube substrate. Metallography of the laser braze joint was compared to the furnace braze. SEM Energy Disperse X-Ray Spectra (EDX) and back scattered imaging were used to analyze braze alloy segregation. Although all of the laser systems, CO 2, ND:YAG, and direct diode laser produced good braze joint, the direct diode laser was selected for its system simplicity, compactness and portability. Excellent laser and braze alloy coupling is observed with powder alloy compared to braze alloy wire. Good wetting is found with different gold based braze alloys. The laser brazing process can be optimized so that the adverse affect on the parent materials can be eliminated. Metallography of the laser braze joint has shown that quality braze joint was produced with laser brazing process. Penetration of the laser braze to the substrate is at neglectable level. Zero penetration is observed. Microstructure examinations shown that no observable changes of the microstructure (grain structure and precipitation) in the HAZ area between laser braze and furnace braze. Wide gaps can be laser brazed with single pass for up to 0. 024 inches. Finer dendritic structure is observed in laser brazing compared with equiaxial and coarser grain of the furnace brazing microstructure. Greater segregation is also found in the furnace braze. Higher hardness of the laser braze joint comparing to furnace braze is observed due to the fast cooling rate and Finer microstructure in the laser brazing. Laser braze joint properties meet or exceed the furnace joint properties. Direct diode laser for thin section tube brazing with high temperature braze alloys have been successfully demonstrated. The laser's high energy density and precise control has shown significant advantages in reducing process heat input to the substrates and provide high quality braze joints comparing to other localized braze process such as <b>torch,</b> <b>TIG,</b> and MPTA processes. Significant cost savings can be realized particularly with localized braze comparing to a full furnace braze cycle...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn this study, {{thermal stress}} {{analyses}} were performed in the tungsten inert gas (TIG) welding process of two different stainless steel specimens in order to compare their distortion mode and magnitude. The growing presence of non-conventional stainless steel species like duplex family generates uncertainty about how their material properties could be affected under the welding process. To develop suitable welding numerical models, authors must consider the welding process parameters, geometrical constraints, material nonlinearities and all physical phenomena involved in welding, both thermal and structural. In this sense, four different premises are taken into account. Firstly, all finite elements corresponding to the deposition welding are deactivated and, next, they are reactivated according to the torch's movement to simulate mass addition from the filler metal into the weld pool. Secondly, {{the movement of the}} <b>TIG</b> <b>torch</b> was modelled in a discontinuous way assuming a constant welding speed. Thirdly, the arc heat input was applied to the weld zone using volumetric heat flux distribution functions.

40|$|The {{sensitization}} {{features in}} FSS welds {{are discussed in}} the present work. The welds were produced on a 1. 5 mm thick plate of 16 wt%Cr ferritic stainless steel conforming to AISI 430 commercial steel grade, using <b>TIG</b> <b>torch</b> in argon environment at a heat flux between 1008 W and 1584 W and speed between 2. 5 mm/s and 3. 5 mm/s. The sensitization was evaluated by electrolytic etching of the weld cross sections in 10 % oxalic acid. The characterization of the weld section for sensitization indicates that the size of the sensitized zone increases in direct proportion to the quantum of the heat input (combination of heat flux and welding speed). Microstructural analysis suggests that sensitization is promoted in the welds when the processing conditions (heat flux and welding speed) restricts the transformation occurring during cooling through the dual phase region, i. e. the welding conditions that promote transformation of delta ferrite (δ) to austenite (γ) during cooling cycle can prevent sensitization in the FSS welds and such conditions found in this investigation correspond to welding with a heat flux in the range 1008 W to 1296 W   and speed 3 mm/s to 3. 5 mm/s.

40|$|A surface {{engineering}} technique {{based on a}} Tungsten Inert Gas (<b>TIG)</b> <b>torch</b> was used to melt single tracks {{on the surface of}} a micro-alloyed steel with a hardness of 150 HV. The influenceof three shielding gases, argon, helium and nitrogen, on the microstructure and hardness of the re-solidified surfaces was analyzed. In all melting techniques, the heat generated by the source is normally conducted to the substrate ahead of the torch, and has been described as ‘preheat’. This leads to a gradually higher substrate temperature, from the start to the finish of a melted surface track. The aim of this research was to analyze any inhomogeneities in the microstructure, due to ‘preheat’, which is rarely considered in the published literature. Three thermocouples were located along the melted track in order to record the temperature at three different points. An energy input of ~ 840 J/mm was used in each experiment and the results show that the maximum temperature recorded by the last thermocouple, No three (subjected to the preheat), for argon, helium and nitrogen gas was 590 ºC, 1120 º C and 740 ºC respectively, where a difference of 150 ºC and 200 ºC was registered between the first and thirdthermocouples when using helium and nitrogen respectively. The corresponding hardness values were 170 HV, 162 HV and 225 HV, and the corresponding surface roughness values were 6 μm, 12 μm and 25 μm.

Approach: In this study {{the possibility of the}} formation of intermetallic and nitride claddings on plain carbon steel surfaces by in situ melting of preplaced titanium and aluminum powder mixture under Tungsten Inert Gas (<b>TIG)</b> <b>torch</b> had been investigated. Results: Addition of 1. 3 and 1. 8 mg mm - 2 Ti and Al powder and melting at energy inputs between 540 - 675 J mm - 1 in nitrogen environment successfully created more than 1 mm thick clad layer consisting of a mixture of titanium-aluminum nitrides and aluminides. All resolidified melt layers produced dendrite microstructures; the dendrite concentration is more near the surface area compared to the deeper melt depth. A maximum surface hardness of around 900 Hv was developed in most of the tracks and this hardness corresponds to high concentration of dendrites within the modified layer. Oxidation at 600 °C for 72 h, of the clad steel gave weight gains of 0. 13 mg mm - 2, compared to 0. 37 mg mm - 2 for the substrate.
