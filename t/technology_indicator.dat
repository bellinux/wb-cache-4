40|$|This paper {{presents}} a quantitatively based method for comparing {{the structure of}} National Systems of Innovation (NSI). The emphasis is on technological interdependencies at the industrial level in Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. The mapping of the interdependencies, based on input-output tables, builds on a graph theoretical model (a minimal flow analysis). R&D expenses are used as the <b>technology</b> <b>indicator.</b> The NSI framework is taken as the point of departure. It is claimed that 'history matters', through relating historical descriptions and analyses of industrialization processes {{to the findings of}} structural analyses of R&D interdependencies within the NSIs. The paper shows that the national systems tend to cluster in two main 'bulks'. One is centred around industrial chemicals and/or pharmaceuticals, and the other is centred around communication equipment, electronics etc. In most cases these clusters {{do not appear to be}} closely technologically related through embodied R&D flows, i. e. it seems appropriate to assume that two distinct technology bases are at play.

However, some exogenous external factors other than time can also affect the rate of TC. In this paper we model TC via a combination of time trend (purely non-economic) and other observable exogenous factors, which we call technology shifters (economic factors). We use several composite technology indices based on appropriate combinations of the external economic factors which are indicators of different aspects of technology. These technology indices are embedded into the production function {{in such a way that}} they can complement to different inputs. By estimating the generalized production function, we get estimates of TC which is decomposed TC into a pure time component as well as several producer specific external economic factors. Furthermore, the technology shifters allow for non-neutral and biased shifts in TC. We also consider a simple model in which the technology shifters are aggregated into one single index. The empirical model uses panel data on OECD, accession and enhanced engagement countries observed during 1980 - 2006. technical change, total factor productivity growth, <b>technology</b> <b>indicator,</b> technology shifter, OECD countries...|$|E

40|$|In the {{literature}} technical change is mostly {{assumed to be}} exogenous and specified {{as a function of}} time. However, some exogenous external factors other than time can also affect technical change. In this paper we model technical change via time trend (purely external non-economic) as well as other exogenous (external economic) factors (technology shifters). We define technology index based on the external economic factors which are indicators of ¡®technology¡¯. Thus our definition of production function is amended to accommodate everal technology shifters which are not separable from the traditional inputs. That is, these technology shifters allow for non-neutral shift in the production function. In doing so we are able to decompose technical change (a component of TFP change) into two parts. One part is driven by time (manna from heaven) and the other part is related to producer specific external economic factors. These exogenous technology shifters are aggregated (via hedonic aggregator functions) into several groups (technology indices) for parsimonious parametric specification. The empirical model uses panel data on Chinese provinces. We identify a number of key technology shifters and their effect on technical change and TFP growth of provinces.

40|$|Nowadays, {{the impact}} of the {{measurement}} and testing infrastructure on economic performance and trade is theoretically and even politically widely accepted. However, there are no empirical studies on this issue. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to elucidate {{the impact of}} innovation capacity and technical standards as one important part of the measurement and testing infrastructure on international trade flows and competitiveness. In order to focus on the direct causlity between innnovative technology and measurement and testing standards and the respective market, the empirical analysis concentrates on the trade of measurement and testing products of a country witha top position in measurement and testing technology. In its empirical analysis of Switzerland's trade flows with Germany, France and the UK, the paper follows the approach of the pionneering paper of Swann et al. (EconomicJournal 106 (19996) 1297), who integrated for the first time technical standards as a <b>technology</b> <b>indicator</b> in the estimation of UK trade performance. The trade flows in measurement and testing products from 1980 until 1995 are explained by both indicator for innovative capcity and for the degree of standardisation. The first indicator is based on the patent applications at the European patent office. The later uses the stocks of technical standards in the countries differented by their regional scope. Four different trade equations are analysed, besides an export and an import function, the trade balance and the intra-industry trade. The results clearly show that both Switzerland's innovative capacity and its stocks of standards are able to explain its export performance in the three countries. Secondly, especially the stocks of international standards in Switzerland have a positive impact on imports into Switzerland from the three countries, confirming their positive role for fostering trae in general. Thirdly, Switherland's export surplus concerning the three trade partners is positively affected by the stock on international standards in Switzerland, which seem to be an important factor for international competitiveness. Finally, the results of the intra-industry model underline the common view of the general trade-fostering effect of even national standards in the case of the trade with the three countries...|$|E

From our point of view, ceteris paribus, the decision to patent is based on the intuitive expectation of profits with the new technology –which is influenced both by economic growth itself and by marketing possibilities, as well as by institutional questions, such as the real possibility of enforcing the patent monopoly– and the cost of obtaining the monopoly -in monetary and institutional terms (the existence of required exams or the necessity of implementation, etc.). In general, as occurs in other types of capital investments, success is determined by multiple circumstances, which does not invalidate the possibility of studying the intensity and direction of investment activity. To accomplish that, we will attempt to a) characterize and analyze the Spanish institutional environment related to industrial property to measure the degree to which it supported innovative activity; b) explain the evolution of registries throughout the 19 th century and discover the degree of foreign presence in the system; c) analyze the patents solicited by residents in Spanish territory to see whether their geographic distribution over time is related to the formation and integration of the national market; d) study the presence of firms in the system and what socio-professional activities the applicants were engaged in, which could help determine the degree of complexity of technology in Spain; e) describe how the investment processes in technologies were distributed within the economic structure of the country to discover in which sectors innovative activity was concentrated and if it coincided with what we know about the Spanish industrialization process; and finally, f) study the obligatory exploitation of patents and the duration of monopolies, to attempt to uncover data on the real effectiveness of the system in inducing innovation and the forces which brought this about.
