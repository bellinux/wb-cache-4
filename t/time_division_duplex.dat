50|$|DECT {{operates}} as a multicarrier Frequency division multiple access (FDMA) / Time division multiple access (TDMA) system. This means that the radio spectrum is divided into physical carriers in two dimensions: frequency and time. FDMA access provides up to 10 frequency channels, and TDMA access provides 24 time slots per every frame of 10 ms. DECT uses <b>Time</b> <b>division</b> <b>duplex</b> (TDD), which means that down- and uplink use the same frequency but different time slots. Thus a base station provides 12 duplex speech channels in each frame, with each time slot occupying any available channel - thus 10 x 12 = 120 carriers are available, each carrying 32 kbit/s.|$|E
5000|$|CT2, {{as used in}} Europe and Hong Kong, {{required}} {{adherence to}} the MPT 1322 and MPT 1334 technical standards. Most striking {{was the use of}} TDD (<b>time</b> <b>division</b> <b>duplex)</b> channels where one radio channel carried both sides of a duplex telephone conversation. This solved the problem of different propagation paths between two widely separated channels (up to 45 MHz in some cellular systems), but also placed an upper limit on the range of CT-2 signaling, since the speed of light (and radio signals) prevented long transmission paths. However, the use of TDD made available many frequency bands for CT-2 use, since a [...] "paired" [...] return path was not needed.|$|E
50|$|Adaptive {{modulation}} systems invariably {{require some}} channel state {{information at the}} transmitter. This could be acquired in <b>time</b> <b>division</b> <b>duplex</b> systems by assuming the channel from the transmitter to the receiver is approximately {{the same as the}} channel from the receiver to the transmitter. Alternatively, the channel knowledge can also be directly measured at the receiver, and fed back to the transmitter. Adaptive modulation systems improve rate of transmission, and/or bit error rates, by exploiting the channel state information that is present at the transmitter. Especially over fading channels which model wireless propagation environments, adaptive modulation systems exhibit great performance enhancements compared to systems that do not exploit channel knowledge at the transmitter.|$|E
