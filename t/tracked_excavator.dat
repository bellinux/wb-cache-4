40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} {{we intend to}} make a noise monitoring, {{produced}} by band conveyors, monitorization necessary for finding solutions to reduce noise. The main sources of noise pollution are: <b>tracked</b> <b>excavators</b> with rotor and band conveyors. For the urban areas and forested areas the <b>tracked</b> <b>excavators</b> with rotor is not a source of noise pollution. They represent a source of noise just inside the career, {{because of the way}} adjacent extraction steps, which is a natural barrier against the propagation of noise. The band conveyor T 111 from the Mining Unit of Career Rosia, which is transporting excavated material represents a source of noise pollution for residents of the village of Rosia of Jiu due to he`s close location. Exposure to noise for long-term can cause adverse effects on health...|$|R
5000|$|Excavators {{are also}} called diggers, JCBs (a {{proprietary}} name, in {{an example of}} a generic trademark), mechanical shovels, or 360-degree excavators (sometimes abbreviated simply to 360). <b>Tracked</b> <b>excavators</b> are sometimes called [...] "trackhoes" [...] by analogy to the backhoe. In the UK, wheeled excavators are sometimes known as [...] "rubber ducks." ...|$|R
50|$|Because digging {{while on}} tires {{intrinsically}} causes {{the machine to}} rock, and the swinging weight of the backhoe could cause the vehicle to tip, most backhoe loaders use hydraulic outriggers or stabilizers at the rear when digging and lower the loader bucket for additional stability. This means that the bucket must be raised and the outriggers retracted when the vehicle needs to change positions, reducing efficiency. For this reason many companies offer miniature <b>tracked</b> <b>excavators,</b> which sacrifice the loader function and ability to be driven from site to site, for increased digging efficiency.|$|R
50|$|Their {{relatively}} small frame and precise control make backhoe-loaders very useful and common in urban engineering {{projects such as}} construction and repairs in areas too small for larger equipment. Their versatility and compact size makes them {{one of the most}} popular urban construction vehicles. For larger projects, a <b>tracked</b> <b>excavator</b> is generally used.|$|E
50|$|In {{plantation}} {{forests in}} parts of Europe, the tree stumps left after felling are now sometimes {{pulled out of the}} ground to supply wood fuel for biomass power stations. The stump is the base of the trunk and the attached woody roots. Tree stumps and roots are extracted using a hydraulic head on a <b>tracked</b> <b>excavator</b> or with a mechanical head equipped by a special tool for tractors. Stump harvesting is expected to provide an increasing component of the woody material required by the woody biomass power sector in Europe.|$|E
5000|$|A {{geologic}} {{preliminary investigation}} is {{a survey of}} the subsoil conducted by an engineering geologist in conjunction with a civil engineer. Typically, the footprint of the structure is established on the proposed building site and trenches up to fourteen feet deep are dug both outside, and more importantly, inside, the proposed footprint using the bucket-end of a backhoe. In extreme cases, a larger, more powerful <b>tracked</b> <b>excavator</b> is used. The geologist is looking for potential failure planes, expansive clays, excessive moisture, potential for proper compaction, and other variables that go into the construction of a solid foundation (such as potential for liquefaction). Materials are also gathered to determine the maximum compaction value (a [...] "proctor") of the subsurface. Prelims should always be conducted prior to the construction of any permanent structure.|$|E

40|$|This {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} focused on a cost calculation for the operation of construction machine. Because this group is a signifiant volume of the total costs, and it affects not only the amount of profit but also the overall cost production, {{it is important to}} track these costs, especially in the construction companies that carry out the ground works or construction of roads. The next section carried out a calculation of prices of construction work, as well as a determination of rental billing rate of the equipment.

5000|$|The {{excavator}} {{is based}} on a 2008 Liebherr 984 that was heavily modified by Kocurek Excavators Ltd for the Birmingham-based demolition Coleman & Company. It was bought for around NZ$4m and imported to New Zealand by Auckland-based demolition firm Nikau Contractors, and arrived in the Port of Lyttelton in September 2011. [...] The <b>tracked</b> <b>excavator</b> weighs 208 t and has a maximum reach of 65 m. When the articulated arm is not extended, the reach is 25 m. The excavator is not suited for demolishing the bottom two storeys of a building. At full reach, a 2.5 t demolition attachment can be fitted to the hydraulic boom. At 40 m reach, the machine can handle a 6 t concrete breaker. The excavator got its nickname following a naming competition on Christchurch radio station More FM.|$|E
50|$|The only {{significant}} difference between the smaller and larger testing devices is the method of catching the reaction mass. The catching method for larger tests uses gravel. This is achieved by placing the Statnamic device on the test pile and lowering the reaction mass onto its hanger. A large containing container is then placed around the assembly and filled with gravel. As the Statnamic weights move upwards the gravel moves to fill the void left and support the weights once movement has ceased. Due to the time required to place and remove the gravel after testing this method is reserved for tests above 16MN. Smaller rigs utilise a hydraulic catching mechanism that allows the mass to be caught within the frame of the device. This allows up to ten individual piles to be tested in a day or multiple cycles on a single pile at 15 minute intervals. Further description of the hydraulic catching mechanism is given by Middendorp (2000). The most recent development is the mounting of a 1MN Statnamic device on a 360° <b>tracked</b> <b>excavator</b> which allows rapid deployment (1 hour) and increased production.|$|E

The present limit values for the sound power level L_W_A= 106 dB to 113 dB dependend on the performance are the basic precondition for the participation in the free movement of goods within the EU-States. These limit values do not always meet the present state of the sound insulation technology. The Federal Environmental Agency (UBA) has extended to awarding catalogue for the eco-label 'Blauer Engel RAL-UZ 53 '' for low-noise building machines and devices by the category of the excavators of high capacity (P_N> 85 kW). The present report shows that it is possible from the economic and technical aspect to introduce on the market of the EU states <b>tracked</b> <b>excavators</b> of the 40 tons category with a sound power level L_W_A= 101 dB and with a sound pressure level L_p_A= 71 dB at the operator's place at the dynamic working cycle according to the EU-Direktive 89 / 514 /EEC. In this connection sound insulation measures were carried out at the source of relatively low-noise driving motors and passive sound insulation measures (exhaust emission air inlet silencers, optimized silencers, full encasing/partial encasing).

40|$|There are {{different}} biomass harvesting technologies {{which can be}} classified based on the source of biomass, machinery and logistic. Slash-bundlers {{have been used in}} biomass utilization to collect forest harvesting residues. In Australia, the harvesting residues are estimated about 3 million cubic meters. Thus this study aimed to evaluate the productivity and cost of bundling operation, assessment of collected and left slash in the operation site and cost of site preparation in clear felled area of Eucalyptus nitens. In a distinct plot firstly raking the slash into windrow by <b>tracked</b> <b>excavator</b> was timed. Then continues time study method was applied to evaluate the bundling production. Work cycle of bundling operation included loading the slash, bundling, cutting and removing the bundles. Any working delay was recorded during the operations.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the role of {{mechanization}} in the treatment of chestnut coppice forests in the Italian Apennines. Two harvesting companies operating with mechanical processor in four different contexts in Liguria and in Tuscany regions were analyzed. The first enterprise was using a Keto 51 head mounted on a Valmet farm tractor, whereas the second one a Foresteri 25 RH installed on a 14 tonne Caterpillar <b>tracked</b> <b>excavator.</b> Field data collection allowed detailing the operational methods applied by these enterprises and provided interesting figures: the rate of utilization of both processors was about 64 %, and their productivity varied between 7 and 10 m 3 /net hour. Daily productivity was found in the range of 25 - 40 m 3 using Keto 51, and 40 - 55 m 3 for the Foresteri 25 RH. Machine operating cost (including labour) was rated at about 100 €/scheduled hour. Considering the financial incentives provided by the regional Rural Development Programme, harvesting costs have been estimated in the range of 15 and 33 €/m 3, allowing the two companies to carry out profitable activities in the local markets...|$|E
40|$|Cut-to-length (CTL) {{harvesting}} systems involving {{small and}} large harvesters and a forwarder were simulated us-ing a modular computer simulation model. The two har-vesters simulated were a modified John Deere 988 <b>tracked</b> <b>excavator</b> with a single grip sawhead and a Timbco T 425 based excavator with a single grip sawhead. The for-warder used in the simulations was a Valmet 524 machine with 2. 4 -meter log bunks. Production rates and costs were examined {{for a wide range}} of even-age oak forest stand conditions. The simulation results suggest that when the tree’s DBH is less than 26 cm, harvesting using the Timbco T 425 is about 30 % more expensive than using the John Deere 988. However, if the tree is larger than 26 cm of DBH, the unit cost of the Timbco T 425 was about 8 % less than that of the John Deere 988. The balanced John Deere 988 CTL system was 31 % more productive and 8 % more expensive than the balanced Timbco T 425 CTL system in the 20 to 36 cm DBH range. General regression equations were developed for estimating the productivity and cost for the range of conditions simulated. The results should be valuable to managers, planners, and loggers consider-ing the use of CTL systems in this region...|$|E
40|$|A {{model is}} {{presented}} that predicts {{the total cost}} of plant maintenance (i. e. direct cost of maintenance plus indirect cost of lost production) and is derived studying a random sample of <b>tracked</b> hydraulic <b>excavators.</b> Analysis is based on the machine history file data of 33 plant items, modelled using multiple regression (MR) analysis. Validation of the model was determined via the combination of an observed high R 2 at 0. 94 and various statistical tests which confirmed the prerequisites of a rigorous MR analysis. Machine weight, type of industry and company attitude towards predictive maintenance were found to be the best predictor variables of total plant maintenance cost. The paper also discusses reasons underlying the inclusion of predictor variables in the final model, and concludes with clear directions for future research in this field.

40|$|Forest health, {{wildfire}} {{prevention and}} water quality protection are three interrelated environmental issues in the Lake Tahoe Basin. In this study, approximately 0. 61 ha of an overstocked montane mixed conifer forest on the West Shore of the Lake Tahoe Basin was thinned using a Fecon masticator powered by a Cat 235 <b>tracked</b> <b>excavator.</b> Following mastication, soil compaction was measured using a recording penetrometer to a maximum depth of 46 cm (18 in) in five randomly located plots, each consisting of three 15. 2 m (50 ft) long transects approximately parallel to the machine tracks onto undisturbed soil. Masticated materials (woodchips, tree shreddings) remained on site as mulch to depths in excess of 30 cm (12 in) above the mineral soil surface, with an estimated mean depth of 10 cm (4 in). No bare soil in machine tracks where mulching occurred was found, while 6 % and 9 % bare soil was measured in a nearby undisturbed or “native ” area and in tracks lacking mulch, respectively. Resistance to penetration increased with depth and decreased with distance from the machine track regardless of location. No significant differences in compaction were found in 13 of 15 comparisons of resistance values at particular distances and varying depths.

40|$|The Swedish {{parliament}} {{has decided}} that Sweden should increase its usage of renewable fuel sources {{to a level of}} 50 % of the total energy consumption in Sweden by the year 2020. One way to reach that goal may be to increase the usage of stumps as a bio-fuel. In Sweden stump harvesting is possible on about 5 - 10 % of the total harvested area and thus contribute with 1, 3 - 2, 6 TWh per year. An increase stump harvest doesn't come without its drawbacks for the environment. When harvesting stumps a <b>tracked</b> <b>excavator</b> is used to pry the stumps from the ground and then cut the stumps into smaller pieces. Storing stumps makes for cleaner and dryer stump wood. Shredding of stumps is increasingly used to get higher payloads on the trucks used to haul the stumps and thus increasing the economically feasible transport distances. The goal of this master thesis was to examine the productivity of a Doppstadt 3060 W and to perform a market research regarding shredders and grinders. To calculate productivity of the shredder, the machine was filmed during work. After that a direct continuous time study was carried out. The crushed parts of the stumps was measured at the heating plant. The market research was carried out by methodic structuring of available information. The productivity of the shredder Doppstadt 3060 W amounted to a mean value of 19, 25 ton/E 0 h.

40|$|The {{excavation}} of foundations, general earthworks and earth removal tasks are activities which involve the machine operator {{in a series}} of repetitive operations, suggesting opportunities for the automation through the introduction of robotic technologies with subsequent improvements in machine utilisation and throughput. The automation of the earth removal process is also likely to provide a number of other benefits such as a reduced dependence on operator skills and a lower operator work load, both of which might be expected to contribute to improvements in quality and, in particular, the removal of the need for a local operator when working in hazardous environments. The Lancaster University Computerised Intelligent Excavator or LUCIE has demonstrated the achievement of automated and robotic excavation through the implementation of an integrated, real-time, artificial intelligence based control system utilising a novel form of motion control strategy for movement of the excavator bucket through ground. Having its origins in the systematic observation of a range of machine operators of differing levels of expertise, the control strategy as evolved enables the autonomous {{excavation of}} a high quality rectangular trench {{in a wide variety of}} types and conditions of ground and the autonomous removal of obstacles such as boulders along the line of that trench. The paper considers the development of the LUCIE programme since its inception and sets out in terms of the machine kinematics the evolution and development of the real-time control strategy from an implementation on a one-fifth scale model of a back-hoe arm to a full working system on a JCB 801 360 ° <b>tracked</b> <b>excavator...</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a model to predict the hourly cost of downtime (using regression equations) for <b>tracked</b> hydraulic <b>excavators</b> operating in the UK opencast mining industry. A three-stage process was utilized for the model's development.

Both cycle time and hire cost models were revealed to be good predictors, as exhibited by the ‘high’ R 2 values of 0. 86 and 0. 95, respectively. A plant expert employed within the Defence Logistics Organisation, UK Ministry of Defence, validated these regression models and the process by which downtime costs were predicted.

50|$|This type {{of vehicle}} {{consists}} of a <b>tracked</b> Crawler <b>excavator</b> device, built and configured {{to carry out the}} job required. It is controlled tended from the vessel by an umbilical cable. Operating seabed tractors show great similarity with the operation of Remotely operated underwater vehicles.The control of the seabed tractor will be carried out from its control location, with the operator driving the unit as if they were on board. This can be achieved by using camera’s attached to the unit. These are also operated from the control location. There are a lot of factors to be taken into account. For example, when laying a cable, the cable itself forms a hazards as it can get caught in the umbilical cable. Seabed tractors are often compared to a remotely operated underwater vehicle, but they usually move somewhat slower, being less agile. They can be used together with a remotely operated underwater vehicle to enhance the overview and to survey the progress and performance.|$|R
40|$|The {{underlying}} {{reason for}} mechanizing tree planting in southern Sweden is the biologically good planting results produced by today's tree planting machines. Nevertheless, {{the productivity of}} these <b>tracked</b> <b>excavators</b> with crane-mounted tree planting devices is too low for them to compete economically with manual planting. The objective of this thesis was to investigate concepts for 1) seedling packaging, 2) base machines, 3) planting devices, and 4) seedling carousels that could cost-efficiently increase the productivity of today's planting machines in southern Sweden. Article I analyzed the cost-efficiency of two seedling packaging concepts that decrease {{the time needed to}} reload planting devices with seedlings. The analysis showed, however, that machine-specific seedling packaging was costlier than delivering the seedlings in their cultivation trays, although band-mounted seedlings will probably be the most flexible and cost-efficient packaging system as mechanized planting becomes more common. Article II and III used a discrete-event simulation tool and detailed terrain, machine, and planting device models to simulate the productivity of conceptual two-armed excavators and multi-headed crane-mounted planting devices. Two arms per excavator proved to be an inefficient concept for increasing the productivity of today's planting machines when compared to multi-headed planting devices. Although four planting heads per device was the most productive configuration on easy to moderate terrain, three-headed devices were best at combining high productivity with acceptable silvicultural results on all terrain types. Article IV used a test-rig to study the feasibility of tray-wise seedling reloading on today's most common planting device. Seedling reloading was twice as fast when done tray-wise rather than seedling-wise, and deplugging proved to be a reliable method of extracting seedlings from suitable cultivation trays even when performed at the excavator’s boom-tip during mounding work. Overall, this thesis confirms that there is high potential for technical improvements that increase the productivity and lower the planting costs of today's tree planting machines. Such improvements will likely include faster seedling reloading via tray-wise-loaded carousels or band-mounted seedlings, multi-headed planting devices that produce high quality planting spots using adapted soil preparation methods, and sensors that aid the operator in choosing microsites...|$|R
