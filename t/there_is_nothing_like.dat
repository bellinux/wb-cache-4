500|$|One {{role that}} was not {{difficult}} to cast was Rutger Hauer as Roy Batty, the violent yet thoughtful leader of the replicants. Scott cast Hauer without having met him, based solely on Hauer's performances in Paul Verhoeven's movies Scott had seen (Katie Tippel, Soldier of Orange and Turkish Delight). Hauer's portrayal of Batty was regarded by Philip K. Dick as, [...] "the perfect Batty—cold, Aryan, flawless". Of the many films Hauer has made, Blade Runner is his favorite. As he explained in a live chat in 2001, [...] "Blade Runner needs no explanation. It just [...] All of the best. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>like</b> it. To {{be part of a}} real masterpiece which changed the world's thinking. It's awesome." [...] Hauer rewrote his character's [...] "tears in rain" [...] speech himself and presented the words to Scott on set prior to filming.|$|E
500|$|In his autobiography, Shankly gave {{insights}} into his character {{such as his}} world-view as a socialist, explaining that the socialism he believed in was not about politics but about collectivism, with everyone working {{for each other and}} enjoying a share of the rewards. That was the basis of his approach to football which is a team game in which everyone works together and shares the rewards. He admitted to idolising Robert Burns, whose birthplace was only 26 miles from Glenbuck and he was inspired by many of Burns' philosophical quotations, such as [...] "A man's a man for a' that". Shankly had no time for bigotry or prejudice, especially arising from differences of religion. He compared the cities of Glasgow and Liverpool by saying that [...] "fortunately <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>like</b> the Rangers–Celtic situation in Liverpool because the supporters of Liverpool and Everton are a mixed bunch whose religion is football".|$|E
500|$|Nancy Banks-Smith of The Guardian {{stated the}} series is [...] "one of those shiny and insubstantial series," [...] adding that [...] "all that leaping out of bed at dawn on the pretext {{that you have to}} go and sell a house tends to wear thin." [...] Banks-Smith also called the story [...] "slightly unexpected" [...] and stated, [...] "Spooks appears to plume itself on its authenticity, and there are moments, well one moment, so stupid it has to be true." [...] Fellow Guardian {{reviewer}} Gareth McLean stated that Spooks is [...] "so good it makes {{you want to be a}} spy." [...] Dennis Landmann of MovieFreak rated the series eight out of ten, calling it [...] "thrilling, dramatic, and fast", while [...] "much more concise" [...] than many American series. Landmann added; [...] "Each story is complex and convincing, plus the scripts are very well written. A lot goes on in each episode, and it's detrimental for a show like this to keep the action and tension going as fast as possible." [...] The reviewer also noted that having only six episodes worked as an advantage over American television, stating [...] "while this seems incredibly short, the idea is actually very good. This ensures that each episode is strong in content and execution. American shows tend to run for 20–25 episodes a season, and while developments occur, there are always the filler episodes. With [...] <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>like</b> it, no filler material at all. In fact, the first season sees a lot of development." ...|$|E

"Believe me, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>like</b> {{a female}} singer who can {{step up and}} belt out the lines, yet has enough Sauvé Fair to finesse the lighter side of the material, and [...] "Panic In The Year Zero" [...] {{is a perfect example}} of that. If the vocals are the constancy, the guitar is the meat and potatoes, {{delivering}} resounding lines that drive the material and vary the intensity nicely; one moment giving meaningful power chords, the next moving with an asynchronous line. The bass uses space appropriately, developing astute lines that emphasize relationships to the drums here and the guitar there, always keeping it interesting." ...|$|E

2500|$|Thus, {{salvation}} {{is available}} through other religions and revelations of God. [...] While the Legio are clear that God has provided specific revelations and even incarnations for different peoples of the world, this does not translate into an exclusivist position in which only adherents of Legio Maria will be with God in heaven. [...] According to Schwartz, “most Legios affirmed that Heaven {{was a place where}} the Father, Son, Holy Spirit, Mary, saints, angels and Old Testament prophets and patriarchs are without color, a place where <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>like</b> Mzungu (European/white person) and African.” [...] She concludes that the Legio Maria Church has “formulat their own version of an anti-racist black liberation theology,” which is unique.|$|E
