5|$|Fertig's {{televised}} in-ring debut for {{the brand}} on the July 25 episode of ECW on Sci Fi, defeating Little Guido Maritato, with Ariel acting as his valet. The next week, in another vignette, Ariel revealed {{his name to}} be Kevin <b>Thorn.</b> Ariel then increased her ringside presence during Thorn's matches, often interfering in his matches, and <b>Thorn</b> began a scripted feud with Balls Mahoney. In order to counteract Ariel's interference, Mahoney began bringing in Francine as an equalizer. The two teams feuded until early October, until Francine was released by WWE. As Ariel began to feud with Kelly Kelly, <b>Thorn</b> became {{caught up in the}} feud and at the December to Dismember pay-per-view, <b>Thorn</b> and Ariel defeated Kelly and Kelly's on-screen boyfriend Mike Knox in a mixed tag team match, after Knox walked out on Kelly.at Royal Rumble (2007), <b>Thorn</b> made his royal rumble debut where he was eliminated by Chris Benoit.|$|E
5|$|He competed on the {{independent}} circuit {{for the next}} year, before returning to WWE to wrestle on its ECW brand as Kevin <b>Thorn,</b> a vampire character. He gained Ariel as a valet, and later joined the New Breed faction in early 2007. After Ariel was released in mid-2007, <b>Thorn</b> continued to wrestle on ECW, but was sent to OVW in late 2007, after undergoing an image change. He wrestled in both OVW and WWE's other developmental territory, Florida Championship Wrestling, until January 2009, when {{he was released from}} his contract. He then returned to {{the independent}} circuit, and also wrestled in Europe as Seven <b>Thorn.</b>|$|E
5|$|In mid-2006, Martinez {{joined the}} ECW brand as Ariel, a tarot reading fortune teller.

Instead, Ariel and <b>Thorn</b> began appearing in vignettes together, and on July 25, <b>Thorn</b> made his in-ring debut with Ariel acting as his valet.|$|E

5|$|Joseph {{is said to}} {{have arrived}} in Glastonbury by boat over the flooded Somerset Levels. On {{disembarking}} he stuck his staff into the ground and it flowered miraculously into the Glastonbury <b>Thorn</b> (or Holy <b>Thorn).</b> This is said to explain a hybrid Crataegus monogyna (hawthorn) tree that only grows within a few miles of Glastonbury, and which flowers twice annually, once in spring and again around Christmas time (depending on the weather). Each year a sprig of <b>thorn</b> is cut, by the local Anglican vicar and the eldest child from St John's School, and sent to the Queen.|$|E
5|$|On February 6, 2007, Ariel and <b>Thorn</b> joined Elijah Burke, Matt Striker, and Marcus Cor Von {{in forming}} the New Breed stable.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Several woody Thai Rubiaceae (ca. 30 taxa) are {{distinguished}} {{by the presence}} of <b>thorns</b> or hooks (curved or recurved <b>thorns).</b> Most of these taxa belong to the tribe Gardenieae (Catunaregam, Ceriscoides, Dioecrecis, Fagerlindia, Oxyceros, Tamilnadia), two to the Vanguerieae (Canthium, Meyna), and one to the Coptosapelteae (Uncaria). The climbing hooks of Uncaria spp. morphologically represent modified inflorescence stalks, while <b>thorns</b> are vegetative lateral shoots with limited growth in all other taxa. In Ceriscoides, <b>thorns</b> are short lateral branches which, in turn, bear very abbreviated leafy and/or flowering shoots. In the monotypic Tamilnadia, short lateral branches terminally bear one or two pairs of short <b>thorns.</b> In the monotypic Dioecrescis, paired <b>thorns</b> are primarily on lateral shoots which occur in clusters in {{the lower part of the}} trunk. In the remaining taxa, <b>thorns</b> are short shoots produced in the leaf axils of long shoots, often together with leafy and/or flowering short shoots (accessory bud/shoot formation; <b>thorns</b> then always above the leafy and/or flowering brachyblasts; one or the other may not be developed). <b>Thorns</b> are either straight or curved (sometimes within a genus, e. g. Canthium spp.). The presence of curved <b>thorns</b> or hooks is associated with a climbing or straggling habit (Uncaria; Thai Oxyceros spp.; amongst the thorny Thai Canthium spp., only those with such a habit have curved <b>thorns).</b> Noteworthy is the presence of two different types of hooks (and shoot morphology) within Oxyceros. A key to the taxa is provided...|$|R

5|$|Acquired in 1995 by the <b>Thorn</b> EMI group, Dillons was the UK's {{second largest}} {{bookseller}} behind Waterstones {{and was the}} bookselling arm of EMI's retail division, which included HMV. Following the demerger of <b>Thorn</b> and EMI in 1996, the retail arm was divested from the EMI portfolio within a year and spun off into the HMV Media Group, an investment venture between EMI Group and Advent International private equity group. This venture included HMV, Dillons and Waterstones (the latter bought from WHSmith for Â£300 million), combining to make an international entertainment retailer of over 500 stores. Following a rebuffed takeover attempt in 1997 of WHSmith, Tim Waterstone {{became part of the}} deal and by May 1998, following the Â£801 million deal completion became chairman of the group. All Dillons stores were incorporated within the Waterstones brand by 1998.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} <b>thorns</b> and spines on the feeding of 5 herbivore species in arid Australia. The herbivores were the rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), euro kangaroo (Macropus robustus), red kangaroo (Macropus rufus), sheep (Ovis aries), and cattle (Bos taurus). Five woody plants without spines or <b>thorns</b> and 6 woody plants with <b>thorns</b> {{were included in the}} study. The spines and <b>thorns</b> were not found to affect the herbivores' rates of feeding (items ingested/min), but they did reduce the herbivores' rates of biomass ingestion (g-dry/item). The reduction in biomass ingested occurred in two ways: at a given diameter, twigs with spines and <b>thorns</b> had less mass than undefended plants, and the herbivores consumed twigs with smaller diameters on plants with spines and <b>thorns.</b> The relative importance of the two ways that twigs with spines and <b>thorns</b> provided less biomass varied with herbivore body mass. Reduced twig mass was more important for small herbivores, while large herbivores selected smaller diameters. The effectiveness of spines and <b>thorns</b> as anti-herbivore defenses did not vary with the evolutionary history of the herbivores (i. e. native vs. introduced). Spines and <b>thorns</b> mainly affected the herbivores' selection of maximum twig sizes (reducing diameter and mass), but the minimum twig sizes selected were also reduced...|$|R

5|$|In Royal Prussia (Eastern Pomerania in {{contemporary}} Poland), <b>Thorn</b> had fallen already in December 1658, but Elbing and Marienwerder withstood.

5|$|In the north, the Royal Prussian nobles {{concluded}} a defensive {{alliance with the}} Electorate of Brandenburg on 12 November in the Treaty of Rinsk, permitting Brandenburgian garrisons. Danzig (Gdansk), <b>Thorn</b> (Torun) and Elbing (Elblag) had not participated in the treaty, with <b>Thorn</b> and Elbing surrendering to Sweden. In the Treaty of KÃ¶nigsberg on 17 January 1656, Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg and Duke of Prussia, took the Duchy of Prussia, formerly a Polish fief, as a fief from Charles X Gustav. The Brandenburgian garrisons in Royal Prussia were withdrawn, and when Marienburg (Malbork) surrendered in March, Danzig remained the only town not under Swedish control.|$|E
