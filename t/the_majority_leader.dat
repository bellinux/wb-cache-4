5|$|While the {{committees}} are established by formal Senate rules, {{there are a}} number of caucuses that exercise significant influence over the legislative process. The most powerful of these are the Democratic Caucus and the Republican Caucus, each of which has a leader and a whip, referred to as a majority and minority leader and whip. As Democrats currently control a majority of seats in the Senate, their leader is referred to as <b>the</b> <b>Majority</b> <b>Leader,</b> and their caucus is able to influence legislation to a greater extent than the Republican caucus. <b>The</b> <b>Majority</b> <b>Leader</b> and Minority leader are responsible for managing their party's participation in debate on the floor. Party caucuses also raise and distribute campaign money to assist their candidates. The Legislative Black Caucus of Maryland and Women Legislators of Maryland, caucuses of African-American and female Senators respectively, also play prominent roles in the Senate.|$|E
5|$|John Boehner, {{a member}} of the Republican Party from Ohio, served as <b>the</b> <b>Majority</b> <b>Leader</b> of the United States House of Representatives from February 2006 until January 2007.

When Republicans reassumed control of the House of Representatives in January 2011, Boehner was elected as Speaker, with the votes of all 241 of his fellow Republicans. In 2014, some House Republicans reached out to Ben Carson about his interest in becoming Speaker should they be able to oust Boehner; Carson declined, citing his impending candidacy for president. Boehner's Republican opponents formed a congressional caucus, called the Freedom Caucus, in January 2015 to focus their opposition. Though Boehner was reelected as Speaker {{at the beginning of the}} 114th United States Congress that month, 25 conservative members of the Republican caucus did not vote for him. Daniel Webster, a Republican from Florida, received 12 votes.|$|E
25|$|The current Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, of the United States House of Representatives {{serves as}} floor {{leader of the}} {{opposition}} party, and is the counterpart to <b>the</b> <b>Majority</b> <b>Leader.</b> Unlike <b>the</b> <b>Majority</b> <b>Leader,</b> the Minority Leader is on the ballot for Speaker of the House during the convening of the Congress.

The Minority Leader usually meets with <b>the</b> <b>Majority</b> <b>Leader</b> and the Speaker to discuss agreements on controversial issues.|$|E

25|$|The 2009 New York State Senate {{leadership}} {{crisis was}} a political dispute that began on June 8, 2009.

Republican Senator Libous argues that since his original motion was on the floor, the session {{could not have been}} adjourned. Furthermore, like all motions, motions for adjournment require a vote, which never took place before Breslin adjourned the session.|$|E
