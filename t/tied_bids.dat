40|$|A first-price sealed-bid {{auction of}} an item for which bidders are risk-neutral and have privately known values {{is shown to}} have an {{equilibrium}} in mixed be-havioral strategies if the joint distribution of bidders ’ values has a continuous density on a cubical support.

50|$|In general, {{making a}} very low bid can be {{advantageous}} if the player has correctly guessed that the opponent is making a high bid; despite losing a (presumably high-scoring) prize, the player gains an advantage in bidding power that can last for multiple turns. In the variant in which <b>tie</b> <b>bids</b> cause prizes to accumulate, the player with a bidding advantage might make bids that {{are more likely to}} tie, knowing that he can then use his uncontested high-bid card to win the accumulated group.|$|R
40|$|When {{an inside}} lender has private {{information}} about a firm, there is an information asymmetry among lenders. The effect of this asymmetry on the relative rates for firms borrowing from an insider or outsider is not well established. In the Sharpe (1990) model, an inside lender with private information competes against an outside lender with public information. In a correction to the model, von Thadden (2004) shows {{that there is no}} pure-strategy equilibrium due to the “winner’s curse. ” Because the outsider must compensate for the winner’s curse to break even, one might expect outsider rates to be higher than insider rates. However, due to the winner’s curse, the expected interest rates for each firm type are higher at the inside lender. In this paper, I show analytically that the inside rate can be either higher or lower depending on the parameter space. This result is limited because it depends somewhat on an assumption about which lender wins {{in the event of a}} <b>tie</b> <b>bid.</b> Under the assumption that the lenders split the firms in a <b>tie</b> <b>bid,</b> an analytical solution shows that the inside (outside) rate is higher for low (high) quality borrower pools. A numerical analysis further investigates the parameter space where the outside rate is higher than the inside rate. The results show that the magnitude of the difference between the outside and inside rate is greatest for borrower pools in which the probability of success for a good firm is significantly higher than the probability of success for the average firm...|$|R
40|$|The NCC decided, {{four days}} before the auction, that to allay fears about the coin toss it would change the rules of the auction. To {{eliminate}} the coin toss, the NCC set up a rule where there was no longer a maximum bid on the sealed bid phase of the auction. In the unlikely event that there was a tie between bidders, then these bidders would have to rebid with their <b>tied</b> <b>bid</b> being the new minimum bid. However, by setting up this new rule, the NCC had to relax one of its stated goals of the auction. When the NCC took out the maximum bid requirement, it was now possible that the bidders in the sealed bid phase could bid mor...|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of private {{information about a}} firm can affect the competition among potential lenders. In the Sharpe (1990) model of information asymmetry among lenders (with the von Thadden (2004) correction), an uninformed outside bank faces a winner’s curse when competing with an informed inside bank. This paper examines the model’s prediction for observed interest rates at an inside vs. outside bank. Although the outside bank wins more bad firms than the inside bank, the winner’s curse also causes the outside rate conditional on firm type to be lower in expectation than the inside rate conditional on firm type. I show analytically that the expected interest rate at the outsider can be either higher or lower than the expected interest rate at the insider, depending on the net of these two effects. Under {{the assumption that the}} banks split the firms in a <b>tie</b> <b>bid,</b> a numerical solution shows that the outside expected interest rate is higher than the inside expected interest rate for high quality borrower pools, but the outside expected interest rate is lower for low quality borrower pools.

50|$|Prior to the {{commencement}} of the 2012 ATP season, Tomic and Lleyton Hewitt both committed to the Davis Cup team for all <b>ties</b> in a <b>bid</b> to re-enter the world group. In the second rubber of the first zonal tie against China, Tomic was victorious against Wu Di. In the second zonal tie of 2012, he recorded two straight sets victories in a 5-0 rout of South Korea. In the 2012 Davis Cup World Group Playoffs, Tomic was victorious in his first rubber against Cedrik-Marcel Stebe in four sets but fell to Florian Mayer in straight sets which would see Australia lose to Germany 3-2 overall.|$|R
5000|$|Play {{proceeds}} in {{a series}} of rounds. The players make [...] "closed bids" [...] for the top (face up) prize by selecting a card from their hand (keeping their choice secret from their opponent). Once these cards are selected, they are simultaneously revealed, and the player making the highest bid takes the competition card. Rules for <b>ties</b> in the <b>bidding</b> vary, possibilities including the competition card being discarded, or its value split between the tied players (possibly resulting in fractional scores). Some play that the current prize may [...] "roll over" [...] to the next round, so that two or more cards are competed for at once with a single bid card.|$|R
2500|$|The {{conflict}} in Iraq provoked {{anger and frustration}} throughout the Arab world and the British acknowledged {{the rapid growth of}} Arab nationalist feeling among the Arab population, large segments of which saw the events in Iraq as a valiant struggle against imperialism. British Foreign Secretary, Anthony Eden, officially stated Britain's support of strong pan-Arab <b>ties</b> in a <b>bid</b> to ease anti-British sentiments in the region. The events of the region influenced the creation of the Arab Union Club in Egypt in 1942 which called for developing stronger ties between Egypt and the Arab world.

40|$|Online {{peer-to-peer}} (P 2 P) lending {{services are}} {{a new type of}} social platform that enables individuals borrow and lend money directly from one to another. In this paper, we study the dynamics of bidding behavior in a P 2 P loan auction website, Prosper. com. We investigate the change of various attributes of loan requesting listings over time, such as the interest rate and the number of bids. We observe that there is herding behavior during bidding, and for most of the listings, the numbers of bids they receive reach spikes at very similar time points. We explain these phenomena by showing that there are economic and social factors that lenders take into account when deciding to bid on a listing. We also observe that the profits the lenders make are <b>tied</b> with their <b>bidding</b> preferences. Finally, we build a model based on the temporal progression of the bidding, that reliably predicts the success of a loan request listing, as well as whether a loan will be paid back or not...|$|R
