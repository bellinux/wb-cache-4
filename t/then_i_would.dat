25|$|Heirens's lawyers {{pressured}} {{him to take}} Tuohy's plea bargain. That deal, {{which was}} the topic of that closed-door meeting with Tuohy, stated that Heirens would serve one life sentence if he confessed to the murders of Josephine Ross, Frances Brown, and Suzanne Degnan. With {{the help of his}} lawyers, he began drafting a confession using the Chicago Tribune article as a guide:As it turned out, the Tribune article was very helpful, as it provided me with a lot of details I didn't know. My attorneys rarely changed anything outright, but I could tell by their faces if I had made a mistake. Or they would say, 'Now, Bill, is that really the way it happened?' <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> change my story because, obviously, it went against what was known (in the Tribune).|$|E

500|$|According to Henderson, {{since the}} {{intelligent}} design movement uses ambiguous references to a designer, any conceivable entity may fulfill that role, including a Flying Spaghetti Monster. Henderson explained, [...] "I don't {{have a problem}} with religion. What I {{have a problem with}} is religion posing as science.

500|$|After this, however, he {{detailed}} ways {{in which}} he felt that Oppenheimer had hindered his efforts towards an active thermonuclear development program, and at length criticized Oppenheimer's decisions not to invest more work onto the question {{at different points in}} his career, saying: [...] "If {{it is a question of}} wisdom and judgment, as demonstrated by actions since 1945, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> say one would be wiser not to grant clearance." ...|$|E

[...] Cast in April 2005, Owen spent several weeks collaborating with Cuarón and Sexton about his role. [...] Impressed by Owen's {{creative}} insights, Cuarón and Sexton brought him on board as a writer. [...] "Clive {{was a big}} help," [...] Cuarón told Variety. [...] "I would send a group of scenes to him, and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> hear his feedback and instincts." ...|$|E

500|$|PopMatters {{reviewer}} Brendan Maher accused Insane Clown Posse of misogyny {{and described}} The Amazing Jeckel Brothers as [...] "music to strangle your ex-girlfriend to". Robert Christgau gave the album a C+, writing [...] "Though they claim clown, they rarely get funnier than 'I'd cut my head off but <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> be dead'." [...] However, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic gave the album a {{four out of}} five star rating, writing that [...] " [...] actually delivered an album that comes close to fulfilling whatever promise their ridiculous, carnivalesque blend of hardcore hip hop and shock-metal had in the first place".|$|E
500|$|While {{working on}} the Magical Mystery Tour film, Evans wrote about his work duties: [...] "I would get {{requests}} from {{the four of them}} to do six different things at one time, and it was always a case of relying on instinct and experience in awarding priorities. They used to be right sods for the first few days, until they realised that everything was going to go smoothly and they could get into the routine of recording. ... <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> find time between numerous cups of tea and salad sandwiches and baked beans on toast to listen to the recording in the control room." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{exclusive}} written interview with The Westmorland Gazette nine months into his sentence, Park talked {{of how he}} had struggled with prison, saying: [...] "They [...] may smoke incessantly, play loud music, the TV or video games, rifle your drawers, steal, lie etc. There {{is not a lot}} you can do about it... I watched a guy [...] "chasing the dragon". It frightened me to death. I had never seen that before." [...] He refused to answer detailed questions about the trial or case, but protested his innocence, saying [...] "If I knew who killed my wife, how, where, why, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have said so.

500|$|After the event, Jenner took an American flag from {{a spectator}} {{and carried it}} during the victory lap, {{starting}} a tradition that is now common among winning athletes. Abandoning vaulting poles in the stadium, with no intention of ever competing again, Jenner stated that: [...] "In 1972, I {{made the decision that}} I would go four years and totally dedicate myself to what I was doing, and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> move on after it was over with.

What fun she was." [...] Novelist Hervey Allen called Marjory Stoneman Douglas and Muir, [...] "the Stewart Avenue Gang". The two were fond of having sherry together and gossiping, but those moments were followed by serious talk of the future of libraries, and {{the role of women in}} South Florida. They were confidants, and often shared their work with one another. Douglas never learned to drive and never owned a car. Her house also had no air conditioning, electric stove, or dishwasher.|$|E
500|$|When George Lucas first {{approached}} Steven Spielberg for Raiders of the Lost Ark, Spielberg recalled, [...] "George said if I {{directed the}} first one <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have to direct a trilogy. He had three stories in mind. It turned out George did not have three stories in mind {{and we had to}} make up subsequent stories." [...] Spielberg and Lucas attributed the film's tone, which was darker than Raiders of the Lost Ark, to their personal moods following the breakups of their relationships (George with his wife, and Spielberg with his girlfriend). In addition, Lucas felt [...] "it had to have been a dark film. The way Empire Strikes Back was the dark second act of the Star Wars trilogy." ...|$|E

500|$|After a {{thorough}} pre-flight check I would take off and, once at circuit height, I would trim the aircraft {{and try to}} get her to fly straight and level with hands off the stick... Once the trim was satisfactory I would take the Spitfire up in a full-throttle climb at 2,850rpm to the rated altitude of one or both supercharger blowers. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> make a careful check of the power output from the engine, calibrated for height and temperature... If all appeared satisfactory I would then put her into a dive at full power and 3,000rpm, and trim her to fly hands and feet off at [...] IAS (Indicated Air Speed). Personally, I never cleared a Spitfire unless I had carried out a few aerobatic tests to determine how good or bad she was.|$|E
500|$|Nielsen's half-uncle Jean Hersholt was {{an actor}} {{known for his}} {{portrayal}} of Dr. Christian in a radio series of that name, and the subsequent television series and films. In a 1994 Boston Globe article, Nielsen explained, [...] "I did learn very early that when I would mention my uncle, people {{would look at me}} as if I were the biggest liar in the world. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> take them home and show them 8-by-10 glossies, and things changed quite drastically. So I began to think that maybe this acting business was not a bad idea, much as I was very shy about it and certainly without courage regarding it.

500|$|O'Leary {{also worked}} in the early 1970s to exclude trans people from gay rights issues because she felt that rights for trans people would be too {{difficult}} to attain. Sylvia Rivera left New York City in the mid-1970s, relocating to [...] upstate New York, but later returned to {{the city in the}} mid-1990s to advocate for homeless members of the gay community. The initial disagreements between participants in the movements, however, often evolved after further reflection. O'Leary later regretted her stance against the drag queens attending in 1973: [...] "Looking back, I find this so embarrassing because my views have changed so much since <b>then.</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> never pick on a transvestite now." [...] "It was horrible. How could I work to exclude transvestites {{and at the same time}} criticize the feminists who were doing their best back in those days to exclude lesbians?" ...|$|E
