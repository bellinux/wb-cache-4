5|$|As the West German public's {{awareness}} of the SS atrocities grew in the 1970s and 1980s, the attitudes towards Waffen-SS veterans shifted dramatically.

40|$|What does it {{mean for}} Aboriginal Australians to {{experience}} happiness, what are <b>their</b> <b>understandings</b> of happiness, and how have these understandings been constructed over time? As different cultural understandings of happiness cannot easily be translated from one setting to another, it is useful to start with elaborating an anthropological analysis from the standpoint of local people's perspectives. In this chapter, I provide an ethnographic account from the all-Aboriginal community of Murrin Bridge in central-western New South Wales. New South Wales is the Australian state in which Aboriginal people first experienced European occupation and have been participants in colonial encounters since 1788. I demonstrate how Murrin Bridge Aboriginal people have constructed <b>their</b> <b>understandings</b> of happiness or, as Murrin Bridge people say, 'to be well' and 'to enjoy life'. Anthropological fieldwork, literature-based research and ethnographic accounts assure that cultural differences are presented from the people's perspective, illustrating <b>their</b> <b>understandings</b> in acceptable and culturally safe terms. Hence, anthropologists are meant to be taking on the role of students, not teachers, learning from the people in whose lives they are participating and observing (Spradley 1980; MacClancy 2002) ...|$|R

Using in-depth case studies, we then consider the part played by these typifications in how parents negotiate <b>their</b> <b>understandings</b> with <b>their</b> partner where they hold divergent views. We conclude that Parents' understandings are developed and situated in different personal and structural contexts that shape rather than determine <b>their</b> <b>understandings</b> and negotiations...|$|R

5|$|O'Connor {{wrote that}} there had been a {{hardening}} of police attitudes, with officers believing that proportionality meant reciprocity. The deployment of officers in riot gear had become a routine response to lawful protest, largely the result of an ignorance of the law and a lack of leadership from the Home Office and police chiefs. Officers were being trained to use their riot shields as weapons. Police forces across the country differed in their training, the equipment they had access to, and <b>their</b> <b>understanding</b> of the law. The failure to understand the relevant legislation was in part due to its complexity, the report said, with 90 amendments to the Public Order Act passed since 1986.|$|E

Their chief port, Cattigara, seems to have been in the lower Mekong Delta. The Great Gulf served as a combined Gulf of Thailand and South China Sea, as Marinus of Tyre and Ptolemy's belief that the Indian Ocean was an inland sea caused them to bend the Cambodian coast south beyond the equator before turning west to join southern Libya (Africa). Much of this is given as unknown lands, but the north-eastern area is placed under the Sinae.|$|E

5|$|As well as {{spending}} time in Sydney's art community, in 1954 Haefliger and Bellette purchased a cottage in Hill End, an old gold mining village in central New South Wales. They added a studio, and the site became both a weekender and a venue for social visits and artistic endeavours by colleagues from the Sydney circle, including Drysdale, Margaret Olley, John Olsen, David Edgar Strachan and Donald Friend. This gathering of artists, {{sometimes referred to as}} the Hill End Group, is known for its landscape art. Bellette, though sometimes a painter of landscapes, was known for her classical subjects and still lifes, which critics struggled to accommodate within <b>their</b> <b>understanding</b> of the Hill End Group. Nevertheless, several still lifes from this period are held in public collections, including Still Life with Fish (1954), in the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery, and Still life with wooden bowl (c. 1954), in the Art Gallery of New South Wales. These images were often rendered with strong colour, which was also sometimes a feature of earlier works on which critics would remark.|$|E
5|$|The Gospel of the Hebrews is {{the only}} Jewish–Christian gospel which the Church Fathers refer to by name. The {{language}} of composition {{is thought to be}} Greek. The provenance has been associated with Egypt; it probably began circulating in Alexandria, Egypt in {{the first decades of the}} 2nd century and was used by Greek-speaking Jewish–Christian communities there. The communities to which they belonged were traditional, conservative Christians who followed the teaching of the primitive Christian church in Jerusalem, integrating <b>their</b> <b>understanding</b> of Jesus with strict observance of Jewish customs and law, which they regarded as essential to salvation. Despite this, the gospel displays no connection with other Jewish–Christian literature, nor does it appear to be based on the Gospel of Matthew or the other canonical gospels of what is now orthodox Christianity. Instead, it seems to be taken from alternative oral forms of the same underlying traditions. Some of the fragments suggest a syncretic gnostic influence, while others support close ties to traditional Jewish Wisdom literature.|$|E

40|$|Functions {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} topics in secondary school mathematics, especially for students who wish to take higher-level mathematics courses beginning with calculus. The prerequisites for Advanced Placement Calculus state that a thorough understanding of functions is needed for those who wish to succeed in the course and pass the AP Calculus Exam. However, research has shown that students’ struggles with calculus concepts could be traced to inadequate prerequisite knowledge of functions. Since thousands of students take and pass the AP Calculus Exam every year, it is important to investigate which aspects of functions AP Calculus students generally do and do not understand, and to determine how well <b>their</b> <b>understandings</b> of functions relate to their performance on the exam. In order to explore this, students from AP Calculus classes in three different schools were tested on <b>their</b> <b>understandings</b> of functions at the end of the course, after they had already taken the AP Calculus Exam. Additionally, some of the participants were also interviewed to further ascertain <b>their</b> <b>understandings</b> of functions. Finally, the AP Calculus Exam scores for all participants were collected and compared to <b>their</b> function <b>understandings.</b> It was found that 1) most participants’ understandings of functions were less than sufficient for an AP Calculus course, and 2) there was a high positive correlation between function understandings and scores on the AP Calculus Exam. These results suggest that more work must be done in developing students’ understandings of functions in the secondary mathematics curriculum, and greater measures should be taken to ensure that students entering AP Calculus have a sufficient understanding of the prerequisite knowledge...|$|R
