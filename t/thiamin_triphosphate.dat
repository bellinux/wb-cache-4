40|$|Thiamin (vitamin B 1) was {{the first}} vitamin {{characterized}} and its discovery was at {{the origin of the}} concept of vitamin. Thiamin deficiency mainly affects the nervous system and causes two classical diseases, beriberi (a polyneuritic syndrome) and Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome (anterograde amnesia resulting from brain lesions in alcoholics). Thiamin transport through the membranes of intestinal and other cells requires specific carriers. As the process is rather slow, various lipid-soluble thiamin precursors with better bioavailability have been developed. In the cytosol, thiamin is pyrophosphorylated to thiamin diphosphate (ThDP), an indispenable cofactor in cell energy metabolism. Therefore, thiamin deficiency causes decreased cofactor function, leading to neuronal death. In addition, non-cofactor roles of the triphosphorylated derivatives <b>thiamin</b> <b>triphosphate</b> (ThTP) and adenosine <b>thiamin</b> <b>triphosphate</b> (AThTP) {{may play a role in}} metabolic regulation and may contribute to the pathology of thiamin deficiency-induced brain lesions. Current research interests are focused on the metabolism and role of thiamin derivatives (especially in catalysis by ThDP-dependent enzymes) and the biochemical and pathophysiological mechanisms by which thiamin deficiency induces specific brain lesions and may be implicated in other disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease and diabetes.

40|$|Thiamin (vitamin B 1) is a {{pharmacological}} agent boosting central metabolism {{through the}} action of the coenzyme thiamin diphosphate (ThDP). However, positive effects, including improved cognition, of high thiamin doses in neurodegeneration may be observed without increased ThDP or ThDPdependent enzymes in brain. Here, we determine protein partners and metabolic pathways where thiamin acts beyond its coenzyme role. Malate dehydrogenase, glutamate dehydrogenase and pyridoxal kinase were identified as abundant proteins binding to thiamin- or thiazolium-modified sorbents. Kinetic studies, supported by structural analysis, revealed allosteric regulation of these proteins by thiamin and/or its derivatives. <b>Thiamin</b> <b>triphosphate</b> and adenylated <b>thiamin</b> <b>triphosphate</b> activate glutamate dehydrogenase. Thiamin and ThDP regulate malate dehydrogenase isoforms and pyridoxal kinase. Thiamin regulation of enzymes related to malate-aspartate shuttle may impact on malate/citrate exchange, responsible for exporting acetyl residues from mitochondria. Indeed, bioinformatic analyses found an association between thiamin- and thiazolium-binding proteins and the term acetylation. Our interdisciplinary study shows that thiamin is not only a coenzyme for acetyl-CoA production, but also an allosteric regulator of acetyl-CoA metabolism including regulatory acetylation of proteins and acetylcholine biosynthesis. Moreover, thiamin action in neurodegeneration may also involve neurodegeneration-related 14 - 3 - 3, DJ- 1 and β-amyloid precursor proteins identified among the thiamin- and/or thiazolium-binding proteins...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThiamin-diphosphate (TDP) kinase which catalyzes <b>thiamin</b> <b>triphosphate</b> {{formation}} from TDP {{requires a}} low-molecular-mass cofactor {{in addition to}} ATP and Mg 2 +. The cofactor was isolated in a crystalline form from pig skeletal muscle and identified as creatine by proton NMR, mass spectrometry, infrared spectrometry and elemental analysis. The isolated cofactor and authentic creatine supported the same activity of partially purified TDP kinase at identical molar concentrations. Neither creatine phosphate nor creatinine showed activity as a cofactor. This is the first report showing evidence {{of the existence of}} a creatine-dependent enzyme...|$|E
40|$|A {{sensitive}} method, {{based on}} fluorescence detection, for {{the determination of}} thiamin derivatives after precolumn derivatization is described. The separation is achieved on a PRP- 1 column using ion-pair reversed-phase HPLC. This method is especially well adapted to the detection of <b>thiamin</b> <b>triphosphate</b> in complex mixtures such as tissue extracts. The detection limit for TTP is 50 fmol. The contents of thiamin derivatives were determined in primary cultures of rat cerebellar granule neurons and cerebral astrocytes. The amount of TTP is about five times higher in neurons than in astrocytes. Thus in rat brain TTP seems to be essentially associated with neurons and the intracellular concentration {{is estimated to be}} about 0. 2 microM. Our results suggest the existence, in nerve cells, of specific regulatory mechanisms not related to the blood-brain barrier and responsible for the maintenance of thiamin homeostasis in brain.
