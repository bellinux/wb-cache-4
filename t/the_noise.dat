5|$|Behavioral {{researchers}} have found that a choice for instant versus delayed gratification is influenced by several factors including whether the reward is negative or positive reinforcement. A past study by Solnick et al., focused on an experiment where the main concentrations were time added to both conditions and the preference of the participants with experiencing a loud noise for variable amounts of time: 15, 30, 60, and 90 seconds. The buttons to turn off <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> were manipulated by one button turning off <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> for {{a short amount of time}} and the other turning <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> off for an extended time. The participants were found to be more willing to turn off <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> immediately for 90 seconds rather than turning it off for the 120 seconds after a 60-second delay was issued. Findings illustrate that participants chose not to delay their gratification for the relief of noise but rather instantly silence it for a shorter amount of time.|$|E

Other errors, such as discretization and initialization, also can be treated as uncertainties in computational model, that is, <b>the</b> process <b>noise</b> in (5). How to obtain <b>the</b> proper process <b>noise</b> is still a great challenge and active topic in many state-space approaches [40]. So is <b>the</b> measurement <b>noise.</b> <b>The</b> process <b>noise</b> and <b>the</b> measurement <b>noise</b> are adjusted manually in this work because the aim of this work is to establish a proper stochastic framework {{to address the issue of}} input forces.

5|$|As {{a result}} of {{increased}} sales of hybrid electric vehicles in several countries, {{some members of the}} blind community have raised concerns about <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> reduction when those vehicles operate in all-electric mode, as blind people or the visually impaired consider <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> of combustion engines a helpful aid while crossing streets and feel quiet hybrids could pose an unexpected hazard.

5|$|Communications signals {{can be sent}} {{either by}} analog signals or digital signals. There are analog {{communication}} systems and digital communication systems. For an analog signal, the signal is varied continuously {{with respect to the}} information. In a digital signal, the information is encoded as a set of discrete values (for example, a set of ones and zeros). During the propagation and reception, the information contained in analog signals will inevitably be degraded by undesirable physical noise. (The output of a transmitter is noise-free for all practical purposes.) Commonly, <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> in a communication system can be expressed as adding or subtracting from the desirable signal in a completely random way. This form of noise is called additive noise, with the understanding that <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> can be negative or positive at different instants of time. Noise that is not additive noise is a much more difficult situation to describe or analyze, and these other kinds of noise will be omitted here.|$|E

5|$|For the {{construction}} of the Second Avenue Subway, the MTA, with the engineering firm Arup, worked to reduce <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> levels in stations. In order to reduce noise for all future stations starting with the Second Avenue Subway, the MTA is investing in low-vibration track using ties encased in concrete-covered rubber and neoprene pads. Continuously welded rail, which is also being installed, reduces <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> being made by the wheels of trains. The biggest change {{that is going to be}} made is in the design of stations. Current stations were built with tile and stone, which bounce sound everywhere, while newer stations will have the ceilings lined with absorbent fiberglass or mineral wool that will direct sound toward the train and not the platform. With less noise from the trains, platform announcements could be heard more clearly. They will be clearer with speakers spaced periodically on the platform, angled so that announcements can be heard by the riders. The Second Avenue Subway has the first stations to test this technology.|$|E

Because the quantum efficiency of Hubble's detectors is quite low at 300nm, <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> in observations at this wavelength is {{primarily due to}} CCD noise rather than sky background; thus, these observations could be conducted at times when high background noise would have harmed the efficiency of observations in other passbands.|$|E
