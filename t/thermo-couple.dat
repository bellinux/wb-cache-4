5000|$|The thermo-galvanometer is an {{instrument}} for measuring small electric currents. It was invented by William Duddell about 1900. The following is {{a description of the}} instrument taken from a trade catalog of Cambridge Scientific Instrument Company dated 1905: For a long time the need of {{an instrument}} capable of accurately measuring small alternating currents has been keenly felt. The high resistance and self-induction of the coils of instruments of the electro-magnetic type frequently prevent their use. Electro-static instruments as at present constructed are not altogether suitable for measuring very small currents, unless a sufficient potential difference is available.The thermo-galvanometer designed by Mr W. Duddell can be used for the measurement of extremely small currents to a high degree of accuracy. It has practically no self-induction or capacity and can therefore be used on a circuit of any frequency (even up to 120,000~ per sec.) and currents as small as twenty micro-amperes can be readily measured by it [...] It is equally correct on continuous and alternating currents. It can therefore be accurately standardized by continuous current and used without error on circuits of any frequency or wave-form.The principle of the thermo-galvanometer is simple. The instrument consists of a resistance which is heated by the current to be measured, the heat from the resistance falling on the thermo-junction of a Boys radio-micrometer. The rise in temperature of the lower junction of the <b>thermo-couple</b> produces a current in the loop which is deflected by the magnetic field against the torsion of the quartz fibre.|$|E

The cylinder-block temperature at the bottom-dead-center of the piston was high and the temperature at the top-dead-center was low. The difference in the temperatures at both centers became large as the discharge pressure increased. The swash-plate and valve-plate temperatures were high at the delivery side and the temperatures were low at the suction side.

40|$|Temperature of bearing/seal {{parts of}} axial piston pumps was measured. Both of a {{rotating}} cylinder-block type pump and a rotating swash-plate type pump were prepared; five <b>thermo-couples</b> were {{embedded in the}} swash-plate and one thermistor {{was placed in the}} suction conduit for the former pump, and five <b>thermo-couples</b> were installed in the cylinder-block and one was at the casing for the latter pump. Hydraulic mineral oils with ISO VG 22, 32, 46 and 68 and the waterglycol type hydraulic fluid with VG 32 were used at the test fluids. The maximum discharge pressure was 20 MPa and the maximum rotational speed was 28. 3 rps. The inlet oil temperature was specified at 30 to 50 ℃. At the atmospheric pressure to the maximum discharge pressure, the temperatures, flow rates and the torque were measured.

During the execution of the dilatometer experiments an additional external tension and compression load below the yield point of the softer austenitic phase was applied (Table  2).

For using the serial-dynamic and space network, we need a large amount of data, more than the data that a <b>thermo-couple</b> uses during 120 seconds. Thus, specialists have had to design new software in order to stimulate the difference curves we should use for each network input.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{hydrostatic}} density {{structure of the}} inner disc rim around Herbig Ae stars using the thermo-chemical hydrostatic code prodimo. We compare the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and images from our hydrostatic disc models to that from prescribed density structure discs. The 2 D continuum radiative transfer in prodimo includes isotropic scattering. The dust temperature is set by the condition of radiative equilibrium. In the thermal-decoupled case, the gas temperature is governed by the balance between various heating and cooling processes. The gas and dust interact thermally via photoelectrons, radiatively, and via gas accommodation on grain surfaces. As a result, the gas is much hotter than in the <b>thermo-coupled</b> case, where the gas and dust temperatures are equal, reaching a few thousands K in the upper disc layers and making the inner rim higher. A physically motivated density drop at the inner radius ('soft-edge') results in rounded inner rims, which appear ring-like in near-infrared images. The combination of lower gravity pull and hot gas beyond similar to 1 au results in a disc atmosphere that reaches a height over radius ratio z/r of 0. 2, while this ratio is 0. 1 only in the <b>thermo-coupled</b> case. This puffed-up disc atmosphere intercepts larger amount of stellar radiation, which translates into enhanced continuum emission in the 3 - 30 mu m wavelength region from hotter grains at similar to 500 K.

40|$|Electron Beam Welding (EBW) is {{a highly}} {{efficient}} and precise welding method increasingly used within the manufacturing chain and of growing importance in different industrial environments such as the aeronautical and aerospace sectors. This is because, compared to other welding processes, EBW induces lower distortions and residual stresses due to the lower and more focused heat input along the welding line. This work describes the formulation adopted for the numerical simulation of the EBW process {{as well as the}} experimental work carried out to calibrate and validate it. The numerical simulation of EBW involves the interaction of thermal, mechanical and metallurgical phenomena. For this reason, in this work the numerical framework couples the heat transfer process to the stress analysis to maximize accuracy.

The definition of an ad hoc moving heat source is proposed to simulate the EB power surface distribution and the corresponding absorption within the work-piece thickness. Both heat conduction and heat radiation models are considered to dissipate the heat through the boundaries of the component. The material behavior is characterized by an apropos thermo-elasto-viscoplastic constitutive model. Titanium-alloy Ti 6 A 14 V is the target material of this work.
