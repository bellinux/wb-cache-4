Each profession's unique nano programs, perks and research also provide combat abilities used by the player during the fight. These can heal the owner, cause additional damage, lower {{the skills of the}} enemy, blind them or otherwise hinder the enemy's ability to fight. Once the target is dead, the player is able to loot money and items from the enemy's body.|$|E

The raven expresses surprise that the valkyrie seems unfamiliar with the deeds of Harald, and tells her about his deeds for several stanzas. At stanza 15, a question and answer format begins where the valkyrie asks the raven a question regarding Harald, and the raven responds in turn. <b>This</b> <b>continues</b> until the poem ends abruptly.|$|E

5|$|The major use {{of silver}} besides coinage {{throughout}} most of history was {{in the manufacture of}} jewellery and other general-use items, and <b>this</b> <b>continues</b> to be a major use today. Examples include table silver for cutlery, for which silver is highly suited due to its antibacterial properties. Western concert flutes are usually plated with or made out of sterling silver; in fact, most silverware is only silver-plated rather than made out of pure silver; the silver is normally put in place by electroplating. Silver-plated glass (as opposed to metal) is used for mirrors, vacuum flasks, and Christmas tree decorations.|$|E
5|$|The surface {{interval}} (SI) or surface interval time (SIT) is {{the time}} spent by a diver at surface pressure after a dive during which inert gas which was still present {{at the end of}} the dive is further eliminated from the tissues. <b>This</b> <b>continues</b> until the tissues are at equilibrium with the surface pressures. This may take several hours. In the case of the US Navy 1956 Air tables, it is considered complete after 12 hours, The US Navy 2008 Air tables specify up to 16 hours for normal exposure. but other algorithms may require more than 24 hours to assume full equilibrium.|$|E

At (3:11), the bass guitar joins in, followed by the drum kit, building to a gradual crescendo, eventually climaxing at (3:42) into a distortion-laden chord progression, using the chords F♯ minor, D major, and A major. At (3:46), a guitar solo is played over these chords. <b>This</b> <b>continues</b> until (5:09), after all instruments have faded out except for the tremolo-laden feedback of the guitar.|$|E

5|$|The affront at {{the heart}} of Show Boat is still very alive today. It begins with the book and its {{negative}} and one-dimensional images of Black people, and continues on through the colossal and deliberate omission of the Black experience, including the pain of a people traumatized by four centuries of attempted genocide and exploitation. Not to mention the appropriation of Black music for the profit of the very people who oppressed Blacks and Africans. All <b>this</b> <b>continues</b> to offend deeply. The ol' man river of racism continues to run through the history of these productions and is very much part of this (Toronto) production. It is part of the overwhelming need of white Americans and white Canadians to convince themselves of our inferiority – that our demands don't represent a challenge to them, their privilege and their superiority.|$|E

At the intersection with Township Road 406, State Route 664 starts winding in several directions, but following a northward basis. <b>This</b> <b>continues</b> until the intersection with Arbutus Drive, where it heads {{straight to the}} northwest. At a clearing in a nearby forest, State Route 664 enters the community of Swissdale. The stay in the community is short, with the highway leaving after a few blocks. Just north of Swissdale, State Route 664 makes a long hairpin turn, curving {{from east to west}} before turning north once again. Just after the intersection with Honey Suckle Lane, State Route 664 progresses towards Haneyville.|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} is heterogeneous. Israeli Jews comprise some 82% of the population, almost 14% are Christians (the {{majority of whom}} are Arab Christians) and, some 4% are Muslims (of which many are Ahmadis). Haifa also includes Druze and Bahá'í communities. In 2006, 27% of the Arab population was aged 14 and under, compared to 17% of the Jewish and other population groups. The trend continues in the age 15-29 group, in which 27% of the Arab {{population is}} found, and the age 30-44 group (23%). The population of Jews and others in these age groups are 22% and 18% respectively. Nineteen percent of the city's Jewish and other population is between 45 and 59, compared to 14% of the Arab population. <b>This</b> <b>continues</b> with 14% of Jews and others aged 60–74 and 10% over age 75, in comparison to 7% and just 2% respectively in the Arab population.|$|E
5|$|The {{ultimate}} {{fate of the}} Universe {{is still}} unknown, because it depends critically on the curvature index k and the cosmological constant Λ. If the Universe were sufficiently dense, k would equal +1, meaning that its average curvature throughout is positive and the Universe will eventually recollapse in a Big Crunch, possibly starting a new Universe in a Big Bounce. Conversely, if the Universe were insufficiently dense, k would equal 0 or −1 and the Universe would expand forever, cooling off and eventually reaching the Big Freeze and the heat death of the Universe. Modern data suggests {{that the rate of}} expansion of the Universe is not decreasing, as originally expected, but increasing; if <b>this</b> <b>continues</b> indefinitely, the Universe may eventually reach a Big Rip. Observationally, the Universe appears to be flat (k = 0), with an overall density that is very close to the critical value between recollapse and eternal expansion.|$|E

5|$|Ununennium is {{predicted}} to have a melting point between 0°C and 30°C: thus {{it may be a}} liquid at room temperature. It is not known whether <b>this</b> <b>continues</b> the trend of decreasing melting points down the group, as francium's melting point is known so poorly, having been variously been stated to be around 23°C or 27°C, with both values very close to the caesium value (28.5°C), possibly due to the extreme heat generated by francium's radioactive decay. The boiling point of ununennium is expected to be around 630°C, which is lower than that of all the previous elements in the group, following the downward periodic trend. The density of ununennium has been variously predicted to be between 3 and 4g·cm−3, continuing the trend of increasing density down the group, using the predicted value for francium between 2.8 and 3.0g·cm−3.|$|E
5|$|As the Nameless officially do not exist, {{the upper}} echelons of the Gallian Army exploit {{the concept of}} {{plausible}} deniability in order to send them on missions that would otherwise make Gallia lose face in the war. While at times this works to their advantage, such as a successful incursion into Imperial territory, other orders cause certain members of the 422nd great distress. One such member, Gusurg, becomes so enraged that he abandons his post and defects {{into the ranks of}} Calamity Raven, attached to the ideal of Darcsen independence proposed by their leader, Dahau. At the same time, elements within Gallian Army Command move to erase the Nameless in order to protect their own interests. Hounded by both allies and enemies, and combined with the presence of a traitor within their ranks, the 422nd desperately move to keep themselves alive {{while at the same time}} fight to help the Gallian war effort. <b>This</b> <b>continues</b> until the Nameless's commanding officer, Ramsey Crowe, who had been kept under house arrest, is escorted to the capital city of Randgriz in order to present evidence exonerating the weary soldiers and expose the real traitor, the Gallian General that had accused Kurt of Treason.|$|E
5|$|The factor {{limiting}} {{this process}} {{is the amount of}} energy that is released through fusion, which is dependent on the binding energy that holds together these atomic nuclei. Each additional step produces progressively heavier nuclei, which release progressively less energy when fusing. In addition, from carbon-burning onwards, energy loss via neutrino production becomes significant, leading to a higher rate of reaction than would otherwise take place. <b>This</b> <b>continues</b> until nickel-56 is produced, which decays radioactively into cobalt-56 and then iron-56 {{over the course of a}} few months. As iron and nickel have the highest binding energy per nucleon of all the elements, energy cannot be produced at the core by fusion, and a nickel-iron core grows. This core is under huge gravitational pressure. As there is no fusion to further raise the star's temperature to support it against collapse, it is supported only by degeneracy pressure of electrons. In this state, matter is so dense that further compaction would require electrons to occupy the same energy states. However, this is forbidden for identical fermion particles, such as the electron – a phenomenon called the Pauli exclusion principle.|$|E
