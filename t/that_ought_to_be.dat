25|$|Like all {{insurance}} schemes, {{different types}} of premiums are available under the country's NHIS. Ghanaian contributors are grouped according to their levels of income. Based on the group a Ghanaian contributor may fall in, there is specific premium <b>that</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> paid. This was done since the socio-economic condition scheme contributors {{is not the same}} and the Ghanaian contributions was to be affordable for all to ensure that nobody is forced to remain in cash and carry system. This meant that Ghanaian contributions payable could vary from one district to the other as even the disease burden was also not the same in all the districts. To ensure that all Ghanaian citizens made some contribution to the scheme, a 2.5% Health Insurance Levy on selected goods and services was passed into law so that the money collected could be put into a National Health Insurance Fund to subsidize fully paid contributions to the District Health Insurance Schemes.|$|E

This {{suggestion}} is a complete reversal of the truth. If a comparison is to be made with the Nazis, it is surely those who wish to force an imported régime upon the Arab population who are guilty of the spirit of aggression and domination. Lord Wedgwood's proposal that Arabs should be subjugated by force to a Jewish régime is inconsistent with the Atlantic Charter, and <b>that</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> told to America.

It is composed in the key of G major, and contains a metronome of 128 beats per minute. Musically, it carries out a chord progression of D–Em–Bm–C, while the group members' vocal ranges go from the notes of G3 to E5. Lyrically, the song addresses the deterioration of a relationship, which is more visible on the song's chorus, where the trio sings [...] "I can feel a flatline, <b>that</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a wave".|$|E

[...] Journalist Mark Baumer highlighted the juxtaposition of Hal with the fast-talking debaters, who are at opposite ends of the spectrum with their speech but are both struggling with communication and expression. Blitz said that [...] "Even when [...] can speak incredibly fast and are packing their sentences with tons of SAT words, they still don't know exactly what they're talking about. There is still a question about whether their content of what they're talking about matches up with what they're feeling or trying to express.

The A.V.

He also criticized the frequent Costco promotion. Phipps praised Ayoade: [...] "...he lends an unpredictable element to the group dynamic, and to the film. It’s the sort of performance <b>that</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> plucked for use in another, better movie." [...] Varietys Justin Chang complimented {{the interaction between the}} four leads, but criticized the film for relegating ethnic characters to murder victims and female characters [...] "to be protected or consoled". He described the film as a [...] "lowbrow, lame-brained mash-up of buddies-on-patrol comedy and sci-fi actioner, held together (barely) by an endless string of penis jokes". However, he praised Ayoade's [...] "mellow, nerdy-funky appeal [...] one of the [...] few novel aspects".|$|E

Nonetheless, it fits into a sinister pattern which has been forming ever since the United Nations was organized." [...] Dr. George A. Snyder of Hollywood sent a letter to all members of Congress in which he demanded an investigation of the Alaska Mental Health Bill's proponents for [...] "elements of treason against the American people behind the front of the mental health program". The Keep America Committee of Los Angeles similarly called the proponents of the bill a [...] "conspiratorial gang" [...] <b>that</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> [...] "investigated, impeached, or at least removed from office" [...] for treason. Retired brigadier general Herbert C.

[...] "Could you write a history of baseball without mentioning Joss? Nobody ever has. <b>That</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the measure of a man's fitness for the Hall of Fame, the only measure." [...] However, Warren Giles, then-chairman of the Hall of Fame's Veterans Committee, pointed out to baseball historian Bob Broeg in 1972 that induction to the Hall required [...] "participation in ten championship seasons." [...] Joss {{had been on the}} Cleveland roster in 1911 and participated in spring training, falling ill just before regular season play commenced. Hence it was argued he had [...] "participated" [...] in the 1911 season, his tenth. The Hall's Board of Directors waived the eligibility requirements for Joss. Joe Reichler, a member of the Commissioner's office, worked to allow Joss to become eligible for the Hall and succeeded in 1977. Joss was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1978. He is the only player in the Hall of Fame whose regular season playing career lasted fewer than ten years.|$|E
