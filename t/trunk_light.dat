25|$|Cars are {{typically}} fitted with multiple types of lights. These include headlights, {{which are used}} to illuminate the way ahead and make the car visible to other users, so that the vehicle can be used at night; in some jurisdictions, daytime running lights; red brake lights to indicate when the brakes are applied; amber turn signal lights to indicate the turn intentions of the driver; white-coloured reverse lights to illuminate the area behind the car (and indicate that the driver will be or is reversing); and on some vehicles, additional lights (e.g., side marker lights) to increase the visibility of the car. Interior lights on {{the ceiling of the}} car are usually fitted for the driver and passengers. Some vehicles also have a <b>trunk</b> <b>light</b> and, more rarely, an engine compartment light.|$|E
2500|$|The American ECD {{was once}} again {{restricted}} to the four-door sedan only for 1977. The model incorporated the new Gremlin front clip {{like the rest of}} the American line of the year. The [...] "258" [...] engine displacement emblems were replaced by new [...] "4.2" [...] units and the bumper guards were included free of extra charge. Power brakes were moved to the standard equipment list. Most of the light group was also installed as standard equipment; aside from the already existing courtesy lights came the hood light, <b>trunk</b> <b>light</b> and glove box light. The electric clock was fully standardized in all units. Front seat belts were upgraded into three-point retractable units. The rear seat back got a concealed fold-down armrest. AMC's original factory air conditioning system for the first time became available as optional equipment. The Carter RBS one-barrel carburetor was discontinued leaving only the Carter YF model.|$|E

2500|$|As the 1977 models arrived, the {{engineering}} upgrades {{seen on the}} 258 six the year before finally saw {{the light on the}} 282. An all-new head design with Quench-type combustion chambers took compression ratio from 7.7:1 to 8.0:1. It was accompanied by a totally new aluminum intake manifold with improved flow keeping the Holley 2300 two-barrel carburetor. These improvements made the 1977 American Rally the best-performing model of its series, even surpassing the high compression 1972 model. Despite this, advertised horsepower and torque ratings were the same as the year before. The power increase allowed the use of a new 3.07:1 rear differential gear ratio for better economy and top speed without losing acceleration and towing capacity. The front high-back bucket seats obtained new patterns {{and for the first time}} since 1972 reclining mechanism (as standard equipment), three-point front seatbelts with double retractable mechanism were added, a new VAM-designed digital tachometer took the place of the conventional analog unit in the midyear. In the exterior, the largest novelty of the year was the application of the new Gremlin front clip. New decals covering only the front fenders in their top sides started near the doors all the way to the marker lights, between the lights and stripe was a [...] "Rally 4.6" [...] sticker. Like the three luxury versions of the line for the year, the 1977 American Rally was the first unit of its series to offer the original factory air conditioning system as an option.

5000|$|For the 2001 US {{model year}} (2000 {{calendar}} year), the VE was eliminated and the S model was introduced. The CE became the new base model offered in 5 speed manual or 4 speed automatic transmission and the sporty S replaced the Touring Package. The 2001 model year {{also got a}} slight refresh with the new front headlights, redesigned front bumper, auxiliary DC power port with a higher armrest (LE 4 speed automatic models), inside trunk release for accidental lockouts in the trunk, new controls for the air conditioner that had the rear glass defrost button relocated with a button for the recirculation of air, and round reverse lights. The 'sportiness' of the S model built upon the CE models with a gauge cluster with tachometer in a red/black theme with an outside temperature gauge, a charcoal gray and black interior, standard front fog lamps, color matched side skirts, color matched rear mudflaps, a color matched front grill, a trunk release lever next to the gasoline cap door lever (but not on the remote fob), power mirrors, a <b>trunk</b> <b>light,</b> 14" [...] 'S' model wheel covers, and lighted map lights on the rear view mirror. The S model lacked the 60/40 folding rear seat, or tilt steering of the LE model. The 'S' model had no performance advantage over the other models: it was purely an appearance package.

40|$|Background: Neutrophilic dermatoses {{comprise}} {{a wide spectrum}} of inflammatory diseases with overlapping features characterized histologically by the presence of an aseptic neutrophilic infiltrate in the epidermis, dermis, and/or hypodermis and are often associated with systemic inflammatory and neoplastic disorders. Observations: We describe 3 patients with an unusual neutrophilic dermatosis characterized by relapsing episodes of fever, widespread infiltrated plaques with bullous appearance, and variable involvement of the arms, legs, abdomen, and/or <b>trunk.</b> <b>Light</b> microscopy studies showed marked edema of the papillary dermis with an inflammatory infiltrate consisting mainly of mature neutrophils. All 3 patients were morbidly obese, and workup revealed underlying cancer in 2 cases: myeloma and breast carcinoma. Management of the underlying disease resulted in long-term remission of the skin disease. Conclusions: The clinicopathologic features in our 3 cases best correspond to a widespread giant cellulitislike form of Sweet syndrome. Knowledge of this newly observed unusual variant of Sweet syndrome within the broad spectrum of neutrophilic diseases is important for its prompt and proper management...|$|E
40|$|Stem {{photosynthesis}} {{can contribute}} significantly to woody plant carbon balance, particularly in times when leaves are absent or in 'open' crowns with sufficient light penetration. We explored the significance of woody tissue (stem) photosynthesis for the carbon income in three California native plant species via measurements of chlorophyll concentrations, radial stem growth, bud biomass and stable carbon isotope composition of sugars in different plant organs. Young plants of Prunus ilicifolia, Umbellularia californica and Arctostaphylos manzanita were measured and subjected to manipulations at two levels: <b>trunk</b> <b>light</b> exclusion (100 and 50 %) and complete defoliation. We found that long-term light exclusion resulted in a reduction in chlorophyll concentration and radial growth, demonstrating that trunk assimilates contributed to trunk carbon income. In addition, bud biomass was lower in covered plants compared to uncovered plants. Excluding 100 % of the ambient light from trunks on defoliated plants led to an enrichment in 13 C of trunk phloem sugars. We attributed this effect {{to a reduction in}} photosynthetic carbon isotope discrimination against 13 C that in turn resulted in an enrichment in 13 C of bud sugars. Taken together our results reveal that stem photosynthesis contributes to the total carbon income of all species including the buds in defoliated plants...|$|E
