5|$|<b>The</b> <b>analogy</b> <b>of</b> a {{game was}} first {{proposed}} by Hans-Georg Gadamer {{in an attempt}} to demonstrate the epistemic unity of language. He suggested that language is like a game which everyone participates in and is played by a greater being. Gadamer believed that language makes up the fundamental structure of reality and that human language participates in a greater language; Christianity teaches this to be the divine word which created the world and was incarnate in Jesus Christ.|$|E
5|$|The place-name 'Blyth' {{is first}} attested in 1130 as 'Blida', and takes {{its name from}} the river Blyth. The river-name comes from the Old English {{adjective}} 'blithe' meaning 'gentle' or 'merry', and still used today. Interestingly, the town of Blyth is referred to as 'Blithmuth' in 1236 and 'Blithemuth' in 1250. Had this name persisted, the town would today be referred to as 'Blythmouth', on <b>the</b> <b>analogy</b> <b>of</b> Tynemouth to the south.|$|E
5|$|Finally, Aristotle {{observed}} that the child does not take just any form, but is given it by the parents' seeds, which combine. These seeds thus contain form, or in modern terms information. Aristotle makes clear that he sometimes intends this third sense by giving <b>the</b> <b>analogy</b> <b>of</b> a woodcarving. It takes its form from wood (its material cause); the tools and carving technique used to make it (its efficient cause); and the design laid out for it (its eidos or embedded information). Aristotle further emphasises the informational nature of form by arguing that a body is compounded of elements like earth and fire, just as a word is compounded of letters in a specific order.|$|E

5|$|Professor Nathan Katz {{writes of}} <b>the</b> <b>analogy</b> <b>of</b> a burning building, {{used by the}} Buddha in the Lotus Sutra, which casts {{religious}} language as imperative. In the analogy, a father sees his children {{at the top of}} a burning building. He persuades them to leave, but only by promising them toys if they leave. Katz argues that the message of the parable is not that the Buddha has been telling lies; rather, he believes that the Buddha was illustrating the imperative use of language. Katz believes that religious language is an imperative and an invitation, rather than a truth-claim.|$|E
5|$|Stratton wrote Experimental Psychology and its Bearing upon Culture {{to explain}} both typical {{psychological}} experiment methodology {{and how the}} results obtained answered philosophical problems. The book covered experimental results in psychology and how they influenced overall social behavior and the everyday cultural life of people. It did so {{by looking at the}} history of experimental psychology, and then surveying experimental methods covering both their applications and limits. Stratton pointed out how psychological experiments differed from the ones in physiology. The survey of experiments also included studies on mental perception, including among the blind. Stratton noted that the blind did have a sense of space. He also described how measurements of mental phenomena were both possible and being done in practice, though he did believe the results had to be interpreted on a psychic scale different from the usual physical ones used for measures such as lengths and weights. He rejected the argument the mind was unitary and could not be studied by splitting it into parts, by drawing on <b>the</b> <b>analogy</b> <b>of</b> studying a tree by looking at its constituent parts, themselves not functionally trees. He presumed sensations were akin to trees in how they could be split up into parts.|$|E
