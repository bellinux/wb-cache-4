40|$|This paper {{argues that}} three major issues {{need to be}} {{addressed}} when examining the effects of <b>the</b> WTO's <b>TRIPs</b> <b>agreement</b> on capability building in developing economies. First, the agreement looks at seven instruments, which have both common as well as differing implications for capability building in developing economies. Second, four major theoretical arguments address the agreement, i. e. market-oriented, regulation, path-dependent knowledge dynamics and network synergies, and public and basic good characteristics of certain IPRs. Third, the capacity of economies to participate actively in the agreement depends on basic and high tech capabilities. The LIDEs have neither the basic infrastructure to ensure compliance nor the high tech infrastructure to support innovative activities. The Asian NIEs - especially the Republic of Korea - enjoy strong high tech and innovative capabilities. The second-tier NIEs and Latin American NIEs are generally endowed with strong basic infrastructure to strengthen compliance, but lack the high tech infrastructure to support innovative activities. Indeed, The LIDEs on average show higher levels of high tech infrastructure and resident patents than the second-tier NIEs.

2500|$|This Russian {{interpretation}} {{was heavily}} criticized by Western countries {{and in particular}} by the United States. Russian scholars, however, repeatedly (and, {{in the opinion of}} Elst, rightly) pointed out {{that there had been a}} very prominent precedent: in 1989, when the U.S. had joined the Berne Convention, they also had denied the retroactivity of the treaty. From 1989 until 1995, the U.S. only respected the copyrights under the Berne Convention on foreign works from another country that were published on or after the later of that country's adherence date to the Berne Convention and March 1, 1989 (the adherence date of U.S.), and on foreign works from a UCC country according to the provisions of the UCC, which meant on works that were published after the later of September 16, 1955 (the date the UCC entered in force for the U.S. and the other initial signatories) and the adherence date of the foreign UCC country. In the case of Russian or Soviet works, this meant that until 1996, the U.S. continued to recognize only copyrights on Soviet works published after May 27, 1973. The U.S. faced harsh critique for its unilateral denouncement of the retroactivity of the Berne Convention defined in article 18(1) BC. Ultimately, the U.S. had to reverse its position on that issue. It implemented <b>the</b> <b>TRIPS</b> <b>agreement</b> (a precondition to becoming a WTO member) in its Uruguay Round Agreements Act (URAA), which was signed into law on December 8, 1994.
