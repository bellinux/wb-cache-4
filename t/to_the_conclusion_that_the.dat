5|$|Dominican missionaries {{were active}} in Verapaz and the {{southern}} Petén from the late 16th century through the 17th century, attempting non-violent conversion with limited success.

In the resulting positions Black has found it difficult to generate any winning chances, and even finding equality has not been a simple task. The fact that one must know a lot of theory just to secure a draw has rendered the entire variation beginning with 9...b5 rather unattractive from Black's point of view, even though it appears to be objectively the best move.|$|E
5|$|Within the Lithostrotia, Opisthocoelicaudia {{has been}} found to be closely related to the genera Alamosaurus, Neuquensaurus, Rocasaurus and Saltasaurus, {{together}} forming the family Saltasauridae. Interrelationships of these genera are contested. Many scientists considered Opisthocoelicaudia to be most closely related to Alamosaurus, with both genera forming a monophyletic group, the Opisthocoelicaudiinae. Other scientists came <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>conclusion</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Opisthocoelicaudiinae is paraphyletic (not forming a natural group). Contradicting most other studies, Upchurch and colleagues in 2004 argued that Alamosaurus has to be placed outside the Saltasauridae as a close relative of Pellegrinisaurus, and therefore is not related to Opisthocoelicaudia at al.|$|E

5|$|A copy of The Times {{informed}} von Reuter {{that the}} Armistice was to expire {{at noon on}} 21 June 1919, the deadline by which Germany was to have signed the peace treaty. Von Reuter came <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>conclusion</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> British intended to seize the German ships after the Armistice expired. Unaware that the deadline had been extended to the 23rd, Reuter ordered the ships to be sunk. On the morning of 21 June, the British fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers, and at 11:20 Reuter transmitted the order to his ships. Kaiser sank at 13:24; the ship was raised in 1929 and broken up for scrap in Rosyth starting in 1930.|$|E
5|$|American {{shipwreck}} hunter David Mearns {{first learned}} of the battle in 1996, and began to study it {{as a prelude to}} a search for the ships in 2001. Mearns, with the aid of other researchers, focused on primary sources (rediscovering several archive files and diaries in the process), and came <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>conclusion</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> German accounts were true, and that the ship would be found at the northern position. After attracting the interest of the RAN, Mearns entered into a partnership with HMAS Sydney Search, a not-for-profit company set up to administer and help fund an expedition to locate Sydney and Kormoran. State and Federal government grants totalling just under A$5 million, coupled with private and corporate donations, were used to fund a 45-day search from the end of February to early April 2008.|$|E
5|$|Farmer {{formed the}} Jazztet in 1959, with the {{composer}} and tenor saxophonist Benny Golson, after each man independently came <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>conclusion</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> other {{should be a}} member of his new sextet. The Jazztet lasted until 1962, recorded several albums for Argo and Mercury Records, and assisted in the early careers of pianist McCoy Tyner and trombonist Grachan Moncur III. In the early 1960s Farmer established a trio with guitarist Jim Hall and bassist Steve Swallow; his relationship with Hall lasted from 1962 to 1964, and included two tours of Europe, one of which had concerts recorded for the BBC's Jazz 625 programme, which were later released on DVD. Hall left the second tour while the quartet, which included Swallow and drummer Pete La Roca, was engaged in Berlin, and a pianist replaced him; this was ultimately Steve Kuhn. In 1964, this new quartet recorded the album Sing Me Softly of the Blues for the Atlantic label. These bands played laid back, melodious music during a period when avant-garde jazz was becoming more common.|$|E

5|$|Following the German {{collapse}} in November 1918, {{a significant portion}} of the High Seas Fleet was interned in Scapa Flow according to the terms of the Armistice. Rheinland and her three sisters were not among the ships listed for internment, so they remained in German ports. However, a copy of The Times informed von Reuter that the Armistice was to expire at noon on 21 June 1919, the deadline by which Germany was to have signed the peace treaty. Rear Admiral von Reuter came <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>conclusion</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> British intended to seize the German ships after the Armistice expired. To prevent this, he decided to scuttle his ships at the first opportunity. On the morning of 21 June, the British fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers; at 11:20 Reuter transmitted the order to his ships.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Philip J. Currie, {{benefiting from}} much more {{extensive}} finds {{and a general}} increase in anatomical knowledge of theropods, compared several tyrannosaurid skulls and came <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>conclusion</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> two species are more distinct than previously thought. The decision to use one or two genera is rather arbitrary, as the two species are sister taxa, {{more closely related to}} each other than to any other species. Recognizing this, Currie nevertheless recommended that Albertosaurus and Gorgosaurus be retained as separate genera, as he concluded that they were no more similar than Daspletosaurus and Tyrannosaurus, which are almost always separated. In addition, several albertosaurine specimens have been recovered from Alaska and New Mexico, and Currie suggested that the Albertosaurus-Gorgosaurus situation may be clarified once these are described fully. Most authors have followed Currie's recommendation, but some have not.|$|E
5|$|In December 1996, former classmate Tuomas Holopainen invited Turunen to {{join his}} new {{acoustic}} mood music project, and she immediately agreed. At the recording session for the first demo Holopainen discovered that due to her classical singing lessons, Turunen's voice had become much more powerful than he recalled from their school days. At the following band practices, Emppu Vuorinen used an electric guitar instead of an acoustic guitar because he felt that it gave a better accompaniment to her voice. Holopainen later explained that the band members had gradually realised that Turunen's voice had become too dramatic for acoustic mood music and eventually came <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>conclusion</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> music had to be massive too. Hence Holopainen decided to form Nightwish as a metal band.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-19thcentury, manor {{owners in}} Estonia found the native Estonian Horse {{too small for}} their {{agricultural}} needs, and came <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>conclusion</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> population would benefit from crossbreeding. Finnish horses were among the good quality breeds considered for the job. The state stud farm of Tori was founded as the central base for the new Estonian breed in 1856, and ten Finnish mares and three stallions were bought for its needs. Though some purebred Finnish horses were produced, they were used mainly for crossbreeding; the later offspring of part-Finnish crossbreds, however, did not prove as good as expected, and the Tori stud gradually stopped using Finnish horses. One Finnish-Arabian stallion, Orro, has had noteworthy influence on the modern-day Tori horse, through his widely used great-grandson Harun 42 T.|$|E
5|$|Quinton, {{a student}} at the school {{mentioned}} before, calls his father after he sees the legless beggar man in his room at night. His father tells him that it was his imagination, goes back downstairs, but then screams. Quinton rushes down to find his father dead and his eyes turned red with blood. Doggett and Scully investigate this latest death after the police tell them about the strange man the boy saw. While discussing the lack of any damage to the body except the broken blood vessels in the eyes, Scully comes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>conclusion</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> man is still inside the latest victim. She rushes to the morgue and finds the boy’s father with a distended belly. She cuts into him and then sees a hand emerge from the scalpel incision. After being temporarily knocked over, she follows a bloody trail, opens a door {{at the end of the}} trail, and finds no one there. Unbeknownst to her, however, the beggar is watching her.|$|E
5|$|The arcs in the Adams ring remain unexplained. Their {{existence}} is a puzzle because basic orbital dynamics imply {{that they should}} spread out into a uniform ring over a matter of years. Several theories about the arcs' confinement have been suggested, the most widely publicized of which holds that Galatea confines the arcs via its 42:43 co-rotational inclination resonance (CIR). The resonance creates 84 stable sites along the ring's orbit, each 4° long, with arcs residing in the adjacent sites. However measurements of the rings' mean motion with Hubble and Keck telescopes in 1998 led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>conclusion</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> rings are not in CIR with Galatea.|$|E

5|$|The fleet {{remained}} in captivity during the negotiations in Versailles that ultimately produced the treaty {{that ended the}} war. A copy of The Times informed von Reuter that the Armistice was to expire at noon on 21 June 1919, the deadline by which Germany was to have signed the peace treaty. Rear Admiral von Reuter came <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>conclusion</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> British intended to seize the German ships after the Armistice expired.

On the morning of 21 June, the British fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers; at 11:20 Reuter transmitted the order to his ships. Hindenburg was the last ship to sink, at 17:00. Her captain had deliberately arranged that the ship sank {{on an even keel}} {{to make it easier for}} her crew to escape. After several unsuccessful attempts, she was raised on 23 July 1930, only to be scrapped at Rosyth between 1930 and 1932. Her bell was presented to the Bundesmarine (Federal Navy) on 28 May 1959.|$|E
5|$|The medieval chronicler William of Malmesbury {{says that}} the king also seized and {{depopulated}} many miles of land (36 parishes), turning it into the royal New Forest region to support his enthusiastic enjoyment of hunting. Modern historians have come <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>conclusion</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> New Forest depopulation was greatly exaggerated. Most of the lands of the New Forest are poor agricultural lands, and archaeological and geographic {{studies have shown that}} the New Forest was likely sparsely settled when it was turned into a royal forest. William was known for his love of hunting, and he introduced the forest law into areas of the country, regulating who could hunt and what could be hunted.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} {{extensive}} historiographical {{debate over the}} comparative strengths of the fleets, although they were ostensibly evenly matched in size, each containing 13 ships of the line. However, the loss of Culloden, the relative sizes of Orient and Leander and the participation in the action {{by two of the}} French frigates and several smaller vessels, as well as the theoretical strength of the French position, leads most historians <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>conclusion</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> French were marginally more powerful. This is accentuated by the weight of broadside of several of the French ships: Spartiate, Franklin, Orient, Tonnant and Guillaume Tell were each significantly larger than any individual British ship in the battle. However inadequate deployment, reduced crews, and the failure of the rear division under Villeneuve to meaningfully participate, all contributed to the French defeat.|$|E
