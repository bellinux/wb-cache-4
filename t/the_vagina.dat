5|$|Cervical {{agenesis}} {{is a rare}} congenital {{condition in}} which the cervix completely fails to develop, often associated with the concurrent failure of <b>the</b> <b>vagina</b> to develop. Other congenital cervical abnormalities exist, often associated with abnormalities of <b>the</b> <b>vagina</b> and uterus. The cervix may be duplicated in situations such as bicornuate uterus and uterine didelphys.|$|E
5|$|Females {{have two}} {{openings}} located under {{the edge of}} the mantle in the mantle cavity: the opening of <b>the</b> <b>vagina</b> and an opening for laying eggs. <b>The</b> <b>vagina</b> accepts the sperm during copulation. <b>The</b> <b>vagina</b> is connected to the bursa copulatrix and to the spermatheca (for storing sperm). The other opening is for laying eggs. Egg cells originate in the ovary. Egg cells travel through the oviduct to the fertilization chamber, where fertilization occur. Eggs then develop in the glandular uterus. A capsule is formed in the diverticulum next to the uterus. The eggs are then laid.|$|E
5|$|A pudendal nerve block, {{also known}} as a saddle nerve block, is a local {{anesthesia}} technique used in a obstetric procedure to anesthetize the perineum during labor.

5|$|Adjuvant {{radiotherapy}} {{is commonly}} used in early-stage (stage I or II) endometrial cancer. It can be delivered through vaginal brachytherapy (VBT), which is becoming the preferred route due to its reduced toxicity, or external beam radiotherapy (EBRT). Brachytherapy involves placing a radiation source in the organ affected; {{in the case of}} endometrial cancer a radiation source is placed directly in <b>the</b> <b>vagina.</b> External beam radiotherapy involves a beam of radiation aimed at the affected area from outside the body. VBT is used to treat any remaining cancer solely in <b>the</b> <b>vagina,</b> whereas EBRT can be used to treat remaining cancer elsewhere in the pelvis following surgery. However, the benefits of adjuvant radiotherapy are controversial. Though EBRT significantly reduces the rate of relapse in the pelvis, overall survival and metastasis rates are not improved. VBT provides a better quality of life than EBRT.|$|E

5|$|Physical sexual {{stimulation}} of the clitoris {{is the most common}} way for women to achieve orgasm; general statistics indicate that 70–80 percent of women require direct clitoral stimulation (consistent manual, oral or other concentrated friction against the external parts of the clitoris) to reach orgasm, though indirect clitoral stimulation (for example, via vaginal penetration) may also be sufficient for female orgasm. The area near the entrance of <b>the</b> <b>vagina</b> (the lower third) contains nearly 90percent of the vaginal nerve endings, and there are areas in the anterior vaginal wall and between the top junction of the labia minora and the urethra that are especially sensitive, but intense sexual pleasure, including orgasm, solely from vaginal stimulation is occasional or otherwise absent because <b>the</b> <b>vagina</b> has significantly fewer nerve endings than the clitoris.|$|E

40|$|Two {{new species}} of Calicotyle (Monocotylidae: Calicotylinae) are {{described}} from elasmobranchs in the western Gulf of California. Calicotyle californiensis n. sp. is described from a single specimen collected from a gray smoothhound shark (Mustelus californicus, Carcharhiniformes: Triakidae). It is distinguished from its congeners by the combination of having vaginal pores opening within the intercecal space, distal regions of <b>the</b> <b>vaginae</b> twisting, proximal regions of <b>the</b> <b>vaginae</b> fusing medially to form a kidney bean-shaped structure, and a relatively long male copulatory organ recurving three times and passing between the distal penis bulb and the seminal vesicle. Calicotyle urobati n. sp. is described from 16 specimens collected from at least the cloaca and rectum of the round rays Urobatis halleri and Urobatis maculatus (Rajiformes: Urolophidae). It is distinguished from its congeners by the combination of having vaginal pores opening outside the intercecal space and proximal regions of <b>the</b> <b>vaginae</b> terminating at <b>the</b> level of the ceca. Members of Calicotyle have not been reported previously from the eastern Pacific Ocean or from these hosts. In the past, species of Calicotyle have been distinguished based primarily on the shape and length of the male copulatory organ and hamuli. Divisions of <b>the</b> <b>vaginae</b> and <b>the</b> positions of the vaginal pores are also useful in distinguishing members of the genus...|$|R

5|$|Birth {{control is}} another consideration: women with SCI {{are usually not}} {{prescribed}} oral contraceptives since the hormones in them {{increase the risk of}} blood clots, for which people with SCI are already at elevated risk.

50|$|The {{dimensions}} and shape of <b>the</b> human <b>vagina</b> are of great importance in medicine and surgery; {{there appears to be}} no one way, however, to characterize <b>the</b> <b>vagina's</b> size and shape. In addition to variations in size and shape from individual to individual, a single woman's vagina can vary substantially in size and shape during sexual arousal and sexual intercourse. Parity is associated with a significant increase in the length of the vaginal fornix. The potential effect of parity may be via stretching and elongation of the birth canal at the time of vaginal birth.|$|R

5|$|In Bruce Bagemihl's {{survey of}} The Zoological Record (1978–1997)– which {{contains}} {{over a million}} documents from over 6,000 scientific journals– 539 articles focusing on the penis were found, while 7 were found focusing on the clitoris. In 2000, researchers Shirley Ogletree and Harvey Ginsberg concluded {{that there is a}} general neglect of the word clitoris in common vernacular. They looked at the terms used to describe genitalia in the PsycINFO database from 1887 to 2000 and found that penis was used in 1,482 sources, vagina in 409, while clitoris was only mentioned in 83. They additionally analyzed 57 books listed in a computer database for sex instruction. In the majority of the books, penis was the most commonly discussed body part– mentioned more than clitoris, vagina, and uterus put together. They last investigated terminology used by college students, ranging from Euro-American (76%/76%), Hispanic (18%/14%), and African American (4%/7%), regarding the students' beliefs about sexuality and knowledge on the subject. The students were overwhelmingly educated to believe that <b>the</b> <b>vagina</b> is the female counterpart of the penis. The authors found that the students' belief that the inner portion of <b>the</b> <b>vagina</b> is the most sexually sensitive part of the female body correlated with negative attitudes toward masturbation and strong support for sexual myths.|$|E

While G-spot opponents argue that because there are very few tactile nerve endings in <b>the</b> <b>vagina</b> and that therefore the G-spot cannot exist, G-spot proponents argue that vaginal orgasms rely on pressure-sensitive nerves.|$|E

40|$|AbstractBackgroundThe lactobacilli {{are a part}} of the {{bacterial}} flora of <b>the</b> human <b>vagina.</b> Detection of normal Lactobacillus species in <b>the</b> <b>vaginas</b> of healthy women in different geographical locations, and evaluation of their specific properties, can aid in the selection of the best species for preventing sexually transmitted diseases in the future. This study was performed to isolate and identify the Lactobacillus species in <b>the</b> <b>vaginas</b> of healthy women and to evaluate the adherence of these lactobacilli to Vero and HeLa cell lines. MethodsThe study included 100 women. Bacteria were isolated from healthy women and purified. Phenotypic and biochemical tests were performed to identify the lactobacilli. The Lactobacillus species were detected by molecular methods using polymerase chain reaction amplification of the full length of the 16 S rDNA of the isolated bacteria. Several isolates of each species were then selected to study their adherence to Vero and HeLa cell lines. ResultsAmong the 50 samples taken from healthy women meeting the inclusion criteria, Lactobacillus species were identified in 33 (66 %) samples. Of these lactobacilli, 14 isolates were Lactobacillus crispatus, six (18. 2 %) were Lactobacillus gasseri, nine (27 %) were Lactobacillus rhamnosus, and the rest were either Lactobacillus salivarius (6 %) or Lactobacillus plantarum (6 %). L. rhamnosus showed the greatest adhesion to the cells when compared to the other tested species. All the lactobacilli isolated in this study showed a smaller capacity for cell adherence when compared with control species. ConclusionL. crispatus, L. rhamnosus, and L. gasseri were the dominant Lactobacillus species in <b>the</b> <b>vaginas</b> of healthy women in Iran. L. rhamnosus attached more readily to the cells than did the other species; therefore, this isolate is a good candidate for further studies on the potential health benefits and application of lactobacilli as probiotics...|$|R
