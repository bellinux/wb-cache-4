5|$|For instance, a 2008 {{study of}} medical systems in Zambia {{published}} by the International Anesthesia Research Society found that only 50 percent of hospitals had an emergency medical system that transported patients. Just 24 percent of ambulances carried oxygen, with only 40 percent carrying drugs of any kind. Furthermore, only 29 intensive care beds were available {{in all of the}} hospitals surveyed, and these were only found in major hospitals. This implies <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> critically ill patients are receiving care in general hospital wards.|$|E

5|$|In 1912, Vesto Slipher made spectrographic {{studies of}} the {{brightest}} spiral nebulae to determine their composition.

5|$|In February 2010, the IMA {{shifted from}} current {{environmental}} control standards within their exhibition spaces, allowing {{temperature and humidity}} fluctuation of a few degrees {{on either side of}} the suggested standard.

5|$|It {{has been}} a long-held {{assumption}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> stars occur in gravitationally bound, multiple-star systems. This is particularly true for very massive O and B class stars, where 80% of the stars {{are believed to be}} part of multiple-star systems. The proportion of single star systems increases with decreasing star mass, so that only 25% of red dwarfs are known to have stellar companions. As 85% of all stars are red dwarfs, most stars in the Milky Way are likely single from birth.|$|E

5|$|Polls showed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> {{the public}} still disapproved of Truman's {{decision}} to relieve MacArthur, {{and were more}} inclined to agree with MacArthur than with Bradley or Marshall.

5|$|A {{document}} prepared on 17 July 1943 by the 5th Guards Tank Army headquarters summarised {{the combat}} losses incurred by the formation from 12 to 16 July inclusive {{for all of}} its five corps, as well as smaller units directly subordinated to the army headquarters. The document reported the following irrecoverable losses: 222 T-34s, 89 T-70s, 12 Churchills, 8 SU-122s, 3 SU-76s, and 240 support vehicles. The document reported damaged vehicles still under repair as 143 T-34s, 56 T-70s, 7 Churchills, 3 SU-122s, and 3 SU-76s, with no figures for support vehicles. The document reported personnel casualties as 2,940 killed in action, 3,510 wounded in action, and 1,157 missing in action. This totals 334 irrevocable losses in tanks and self-propelled guns, with another 212 tanks and self-propelled guns under repair, and 7,607 casualties. The historian Karl-Heinz Frieser argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> these losses must have occurred on 12 July.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{black-throated blue warbler}} is a {{socially}} monogamous species, males are frequently observed in territories of other males, suggesting the occurrence of extra-pair matings. Nestling parentage is identified by microsatellites in a study plot at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire. The results show that extra-pair fertilization occurs and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> the extra-pair sires come from males in neighboring territories. Only very few extra-pair sires are from distant territories. This local reproductive interaction is also supported by another study conducted earlier, which finds that extra pair fertilizations are strongly and positively correlated with local synchrony {{but there is no}} significant association with population level synchrony.|$|E

Alvarado tried them in their absence, and condemned them to death; he branded all the Pipil prisoners as slaves.|$|E
5|$|Compositional {{information}} from the visible and infrared spectrometer (VIR), gamma-ray and neutron detector (GRaND), and framing camera (FC), all indicate <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> the surface composition of Vesta {{is consistent with the}} composition of the howardite, eucrite, and diogenite meteorites.

However, olivine has only been detected in localized regions of the northern hemisphere, not within Rheasilvia. The origin of this olivine is currently uncertain.|$|E
