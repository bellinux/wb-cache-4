He asks Dales how Skur escaped and Dales speculates that someone might have helped Skur escape hoping that {{the truth of what}} was done to him may one day be revealed. The episode ends with a final flashback of Bill Mulder driving down a road with Skur and giving Skur the keys <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>and</b> walking away.|$|E
5|$|The game is set after {{a fictional}} World War III in a post-apocalyptic United States where various gangs prey on towns in which {{survivors}} {{from the war}} have gathered. The player assumes the role the eponymous female protagonist, Angel, as she defends the towns and searches for her lost friend. The game is played from a bird's eye view as the player controls a car and its mounted machine guns in order to destroy enemies and vehicles. Players can find more powerful guns to attach <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>and</b> can also use special weapons such as napalm or spike strips which are picked up after killing certain enemies.|$|E

25|$|Despite their {{practice}} staged-robbery the previous day, as the Katy No. 2 approached, Reed threw the switch too early. Engineer Joseph Hotchkiss stopped the train {{when he saw}} the signal light change, far short of the siding. Reed and the others were forced to run towards the train yelling and shooting. Hotchkiss and the fireman alerted the messengers using the bell cord connected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>and</b> jumped off the train to hide in a small ravine nearby.|$|E
25|$|As Roberts {{drove away}} with Mangum, {{the two women}} began to argue. Roberts pulled over and {{attempted}} to push Mangum out of the car. When that failed, Roberts drove Mangum to a nearby Kroger supermarket, went inside, and told a female security guard that a woman was refusing to leave her car. The guard walked <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>and</b> asked Mangum to leave, but Mangum remained in the vehicle. The guard said {{that she did not}} smell alcohol on Mangum's breath, but thought she might have been under the influence of other drugs. At 1:22 AM, the guard called 911 to report that Mangum refused to leave the car. Police then arrived, removed Mangum from the car and questioned her.|$|E

50|$|Graveyard Carz {{went through}} a total revamp: new logo, new graphics, and new show format built upon the changes made in Season 5. Rather than {{focusing}} on the cast and their daily activities, focus has shifted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> <b>and</b> their builds in order to draw in viewers disheartened by the original format of the show.|$|R
25|$|When Emma regains consciousness, {{she gets}} out of the car to confront Ingrid, believing that she was there. But Emma refuses to believe Ingrid when she warns her that Gold only wanted to hurt her for his own self-benefits. Emma notices that the image is an {{illusion}} as she tries to touch Ingrid, so she returns <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>and</b> speeds off to the mansion. As Emma arrives at the place, Gold sets up the hat to absorb her and her powers in a closed room. Emma waits for Gold at the other side, and before she opens the door, Gold appears behind her, telling Emma that everything will be fine once her powers are gone, and that she will be able to live a normal life. Emma then thanks Gold, not knowing will happen next as she ponders about opening the door.|$|E
25|$|At 7am Platform 1 was cordoned off, as {{the camera}} crew filmed the three presenters drawing lots to {{determine}} which mode of transport to take. Jeremy Clarkson was allocated Tornado, May got the Jaguar while motorcycle fan Richard Hammond got the bike. Tornado was scheduled to depart at 7:25am. The race officially started with a blast on Tornado's whistle. James May and Richard Hammond proceeded <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>and</b> bike which were parked in York Way. Tornado left approximately 90–120seconds late due to delays in the camera crew boarding the support coach. As seen on the programme, Hammond was delayed as he changed into his biker's leathers and was delayed again {{as he struggled to}} start the Black Shadow. The Vincent was eventually started by a motorcycle technician named Jim Church, who had been employed to provide technical support for the shoot.|$|E
500|$|The ECTunes system, {{and most}} others so far disclosed, use a control box, with software, digital {{amplifiers}} and weather-friendly external speakers.

500|$|A Tesla Roadster {{was used}} to record the game's tire sounds. The {{developers}} chose the Tesla due to its near-silent electric motor which allowed them to record the sounds cleanly without engine or exhaust noise. Two microphones were mounted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>and</b> pointed at the tire for recording. Lance Hayes, the award-winning composer for Forza Motorsport 3, returned to score Forza Motorsport 4, which features a combination of his music and other licensed artists. 15 songs were provided by Hayes for the user interface and some in-race music. In speaking of {{the tone of the}} soundtrack, Hayes stated [...] "The score has an increased cinematic feel as well as incorporating many of the styles (downtempo, electronic, ambient) that made the Forza Motorsport 3 OST a fan favorite." ...|$|E
500|$|Following Katz, {{the vast}} {{majority}} of Fourth Amendment search cases have turned on the right to privacy, but in United States v. Jones (2012), the Court ruled that the Katz standard did not replace earlier case law, but rather, has supplemented it. In Jones, law enforcement officers had attached a GPS device on a car's exterior without Jones' knowledge or consent. The Court concluded that Jones was a bailee <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>car,</b> <b>and</b> so had a property interest in the car. Therefore, since the intrusion on the vehicle—a common law trespass—was for the purpose of obtaining information, the Court ruled that it was a search under the Fourth Amendment. The Court used similar [...] "trespass" [...] reasoning in Florida v. Jardines (2013), to rule that bringing a drug detection dog to sniff at the front door of a home was a search.|$|E
500|$|A Free Rides opening intertitle {{denotes the}} film's setting as [...] "in the wide open spaces, where men are men and girls will be girls, the hills {{are full of}} romance and adventure". The film shows two women walking {{together}} alongside a road near their home. A wealthy male motorist in a right-hand-drive 1912 Haynes 50-60 Model Y Touring Car arrives and offers them a lift. After some hesitation, the women accept his offer and sit beside him in the front seat. The man then kisses and fondles them. Later, as he urinates behind a tree, the women voyeuristically watch him. When {{he is about to}} finish, the women quickly return to the car. After his return, the women urinate behind the tree while the man secretly watches them and becomes sexually aroused. The women return <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>and</b> the man offers them a drink.|$|E

500|$|Sinclair {{himself said}} in 2005 that the C5 [...] "was early {{for what it}} was. People reacted {{negatively}} and the press didn't help. It was too low down and people felt insecure, hence it got bad press." [...] Sam Dawson of Classic and Sport Car Magazine described the C5 as [...] "incredibly fun to drive", suggesting that the safety concerns [...] "could have been addressed if it wasn't {{for the fact that}} it was already doomed as a national joke." [...] He noted the disconnect between the media's expectations of a serious electric car and the reality of the C5, which he called [...] "just a fun way of getting around". Professor Stuart Cole of the University of South Wales comments that the C5 suffered from the design of the roads and the attitudes of the time, which were not geared towards pedal or electric vehicles: [...] "In the days before unleaded petrol, your face would have been at the height of every exhaust pipe, and drivers weren't used to having to consider slower-moving cyclists. But with more cycle lanes, better education, and workplaces providing showers, etc., the world now is much more geared up for people looking for alternatives <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>car,</b> <b>and</b> hopefully will become even more so in the future." ...|$|E
2500|$|Citroën had {{attempted}} to replace the ultra-utilitarian 2CV several times (with the Dyane, Visa, and the AX). Its comically antiquated appearance became an advantage <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>car,</b> <b>and</b> it became a niche product which sold because it was different from anything else on sale. Because of its down-to-earth economy car style, it became popular with {{people who wanted to}} distance themselves from mainstream consumerism— [...] "hippies"— and also with environmentalists.|$|E

2500|$|Power density: Power from a {{solar array}} {{is limited by}} the size of the vehicle and area that can be exposed to sunlight. This can also be {{overcome}} by adding a flatbed and connecting it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>and</b> this gives more area for panels for powering the car. While energy can be accumulated in batteries to lower peak demand on the array and provide operation in sunless conditions, the battery adds weight and cost to the vehicle. The power limit can be mitigated by use of conventional electric cars supplied by solar (or other) power, recharging from the electrical grid.|$|E
2500|$|Although most of {{the town}} was in fear of the Phantom, some kids {{continued}} parking on lonely roads. Some of them hoped to apprehend the evasive slayer. One night, Officer Tillman Johnson was patrolling a lonely road with Arkansas State Trooper Charley Boyd when they came up to a parked car. Johnson got out while Boyd stayed behind. Johnson walked up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>and</b> noticed a couple. He said, [...] "I am Tillman Johnson with the Miller County Sheriff's Department.

50|$|Though Ford's {{name was}} {{attached}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> ensuing legend, he had ironically sold his stake in them for $800 to Barney Oldfield <b>and</b> Cooper when <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> had refused <b>to</b> start during a test drive {{two weeks before}} the first race. Ultimately, Ford would abandon his share of the racing money, but would reserve <b>the</b> right <b>to</b> promotions <b>and</b> publicity of <b>the</b> <b>cars,</b> which secured his image behind their eventual successes. He meanwhile built up Ford Motor Company, which surpassed Winton in terms of production by the end of 1903.|$|R
