5|$|Takalik Abaj Monument23 {{dates to}} the Middle Preclassic period, and is found in Takalik Abaj, an {{important}} city {{in the foothills of}} the Guatemalan Pacific coast, in the modern department of Retalhuleu. It appears to be an Olmec-style colossal head re-carved into a niche figure sculpture. If originally a colossal head <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> the only known example from outside the Olmec heartland.|$|E
5|$|Jerold J. Abrams and Elizabeth F. Cooke, in {{the book}} The Philosophy of TV Noir argue that the episode {{stresses}} abductive reasoning, a type of logic that goes from data or a description of something to a hypothesis that accounts for the reliable data and seeks to explain relevant evidence. Abductive reasoning follows the logic: a surprising fact, C, is observed (Result); If A, the hypothesis, were true, C would make perfect sense (Rule); Thus, {{there is reason to}} suspect that A is true (Case). An example that has been given is: the lawn is wet. But if it is raining, <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> unsurprising that the lawn is wet. Therefore, it is raining. This logical method is favored by Mulder throughout most of the show. In this episode, however, it is Scully who first uses the method. She takes three separate facts—the massive size of some types of mushrooms, the hallucinogenic properties of some fungi, and the carnivorous nature of certain types of plants—and formulates an abductive conclusion: she and Mulder are trapped underground, experiencing a hallucination, and slowly being digested.|$|E

5|$|Nomura {{placed a}} secret trailer in Kingdom Hearts {{in hopes that}} fans would want a sequel. He was unsure if fans would want a sequel and felt {{that if they did}} not, <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> best to leave certain events in the first game unexplained. After Kingdom Hearts Final Mix was completed, {{development}} for Kingdom Hearts II began. There were several obstacles to clear before development could begin on a sequel. One was the development team's desire to showcase Mickey Mouse more; Mickey's inclusion in the first game was restricted to a very small role. Nomura had planned for the sequel to take place a year after the first and originally intended for the events of that year to be left unexplained. To bridge the gap between the two games, Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories was developed. Nomura was hesitant about releasing a game on the Game Boy Advance because he felt the 3D graphics of the original game would not translate well into 2D. He changed his position after hearing that children wanted to play Kingdom Hearts on the handheld system.|$|E
25|$|No map {{from the}} sphere {{to the plane}} can be both {{conformal}} and area-preserving. If it were, <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a local isometry and would preserve Gaussian curvature. The sphere and the plane have different Gaussian curvatures, so this is impossible.|$|E
25|$|Some economists {{argue that}} a single world {{currency}} is unnecessary, because the U.S. dollar is providing many {{of the benefits of}} a world currency while avoiding some of the costs.

25|$|The October 1981 {{timetable}} {{required a}} handful of the older railmotors to stay in service, with two of the unreliable Tulloch DRC and four of the worn-out DERM types.

25|$|Working {{with the}} ALARP principle, before {{a patient is}} exposed for a nuclear {{medicine}} examination, {{the benefit of the}} examination must be identified.

25|$|If {{it becomes}} {{necessary}} {{to differentiate between}} mutations in genomic DNA, mitochondrial DNA, and RNA, a simple convention is used.

Note that, for mutations in RNA, the nucleotide code is written in lower case.|$|E
25|$|For many decades, {{scientists}} {{had no way}} {{to determine whether or not}} the Higgs field existed, because the technology needed for its detection did not exist at that time. If the Higgs field did exist, <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> unlike any other known fundamental field, but it also was possible that these key ideas, or even the entire Standard Model, were somehow incorrect. Only discovering that the Higgs boson and therefore the Higgs field existed solved the problem.|$|E

25|$|It was the Manx Government's {{position}} that, if the United Kingdom {{had decided}} {{to participate in the}} euro, <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> likely that the Island would also choose to participate. Primarily this was because most of the Island's trade is with the United Kingdom and other countries of Europe, and the break-up of the existing currency union with the UK would cause economic harm to the Island. There was also concern that the island's economy is not large enough to withstand attack by currency speculators if the Manx pound became a stand-alone free-floating currency.|$|E
25|$|Giovanni Pacini, another Catanese composer, {{was still}} in Milan in late June after the well-received premiere on 10 June of his opera Il Talismano at La Scala, where it went on to receive a total of 16 performances. To Bellini, he {{appeared}} to be a rival, and with his recent success, Pacini received offers to compose an opera for both Turin and Venice for the Carnival season. He accepted both offers, but the La Fenice impresario included a proviso that if he were to be unable to fulfill the Venice contract, <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> transferred to Bellini.|$|E
25|$|The Romans {{responded with}} {{defensive}} measures. Caistor-by-Norwich, Chelmsford and Forum Hadriani (present day Voorburg) (the civitas of the Canninefates near The Hague) were all fortified c. 200, and the Romans began a defensive system of protection especially along {{the coasts of}} Britain and the Continent. This system would be continually maintained and improved upon, which the Romans {{would not have done}} unless there was a continuing threat to be addressed. The system would continue to evolve through the disappearance of Chauci raiders and their replacement by the Frankish and Saxon ones, up {{to the end of the}} 4th century. By <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> known as the Saxon Shore, a name given it by the Notitia Dignitatum.|$|E

25|$|The first {{hearing was}} held with the Shafii {{scholars}} who accused Ibn Taymiyyah of anthropomorphism. At the time Ibn Taymiyyah was 42 years old. He {{was protected by}} the then Governor of Damascus, Aqqush al-Afram, during the proceedings. The scholars suggested that he accept that his creed was simply that of the Hanbalites and offered this as {{a way out of}} the charge. The issue being, if Ibn Taymiyyah ascribed his creed to the Hanbali school of law <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> just one view out of the four schools which one could follow rather than a creed everybody must adhere to. Ibn Taymiyyah was uncompromising and maintained that it was obligatory for all scholars to adhere to his creed.|$|E
25|$|Why {{this style}} gained {{mainstream}} acceptance in the 1950s {{is a matter}} of debate. American social realism had been the mainstream in the 1930s. It had been influenced not only by the Great Depression, but also by the muralists of Mexico such as David Alfaro Siqueiros and Diego Rivera. The political climate after World War II did not long tolerate the social protests of these painters. Abstract expressionism arose during World War II and began to be showcased during the early forties at galleries in New York such as The Art of This Century Gallery. The McCarthy era after World War II was a time of artistic censorship in the United States, but if the subject matter were totally abstract <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> seen as apolitical, and therefore safe. Or if the art was political, the message was largely for the insiders.|$|E
25|$|Giant isopods {{collected}} {{along the}} east coast of Australia by setting traps exhibit a variation in diversity with water depth. The deeper the water, the fewer number of species found, and the larger the species tended to be. The giant isopods found in very deep waters off Australia were compared to those found off Mexico and India. From the fossil record it is thought that Bathynomus existed more than 160 million years ago, so it did not evolve independently in all three locations, but since <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> expected that Bathynomus would show divergent evolution in the various locations. However the giant isopods in all three locations were almost identical in appearance (although there are some differences, and they are separate species). This reduced phenotypic divergence is linked to the extremely low light levels of their habitat.|$|E
