While the barrier is expected to function as designed until roughly 2070, concepts for its future enlargement or redesign are already being discussed.|$|E
5|$|The Chelsea Waterworks Company {{occupied}} a {{site on the}} north bank of <b>the</b> <b>Thames</b> opposite the Red House Inn. Founded in 1723, the company pumped water from <b>the</b> <b>Thames</b> to reservoirs around Westminster through a network of hollow elm trunks. As London spread westwards, the former farmland to the west became increasingly populated, and <b>the</b> <b>Thames</b> became seriously polluted with sewage and animal carcasses. In 1852 Parliament banned water from being taken from <b>the</b> <b>Thames</b> downstream of Teddington, forcing the Chelsea Waterworks Company to move upstream to Seething Wells.|$|E

5|$|East Tilbury, {{which stands}} at {{the western end of}} the section of <b>the</b> <b>Thames</b> known as Lower Hope Reach, was {{fortified}} long before the building of Coalhouse Fort due to its vulnerability to seaborne attackers. Settlements on both sides of <b>the</b> <b>Thames</b> were raided by the French in 1379 during {{the second phase of the}} Hundred Years' War. The attack prompted the building of Cooling Castle on Kent's Hoo Peninsula between 1380 and 1385 but there was initially no corresponding move to improve the defences of East Tilbury.|$|E

The city's largest park, Springbank Park, is 140-hectare (300 acre) and contains 30km (19mi) of trails. It is also home to Storybook Gardens, a family attraction open year-round.|$|E

5|$|Since the Victorian era <b>the</b> <b>Thames</b> {{has been}} {{extensively}} embanked, {{and many of its}} London tributaries now flow underground. <b>The</b> <b>Thames</b> is a tidal river, and London is vulnerable to flooding. The threat has increased over time because of a slow but continuous rise in high water level by the slow 'tilting' of Britain (up in the north and down in the south) caused by post-glacial rebound.|$|E

5|$|The town {{grew up as}} a {{river port}} at the {{confluence}} of <b>the</b> <b>Thames</b> and the Kennet. Both of these rivers are navigable, and Caversham Lock, Blake's Lock, County Lock, Fobney Lock and Southcote Lock are all within the borough.
