25|$|The term harbour salvage {{refers to}} the salvage of vessels {{stranded}} or sunk in sheltered waters.

25|$|The simplex {{algorithm}} {{applied to}} the Phase I problem must terminate with a minimum value for the new objective function since, being the sum of nonnegative variables, its value is bounded below by 0. If the minimum is 0 then the artificial variables can be eliminated from the resulting canonical tableau producing a canonical tableau equivalent to the original problem. The simplex algorithm can then be applied to find the solution; this step is called PhaseII. If the minimum is positive <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> feasible solution for the Phase I problem where the artificial variables are all zero. This implies that the feasible region for the original problem is empty, and so the original problem has no solution.|$|E

25|$|The {{polarization}} {{of the incoming}} photon (or beam) can be resolved as two polarizations on the x and y axis. If the input polarization {{is parallel to the}} fast or slow axis, <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> {{polarization of}} the other axis, so the output polarization {{is the same as the}} input (only the phase more or less delayed). If the input polarization is 45° to the fast and slow axis, the polarization on those axes are equal. But the phase of the output of the slow axis will be delayed 90° with the output of the fast axis. If not the amplitude but both sinus values are displayed, then x and y combined will describe a circle. With other angles than 0° or 45° the values in fast and slow axis will differ and their resultant output will describe an ellipse.|$|E
25|$|Criticism of Hrdy's {{hypothesis}} {{emerges from}} evidence {{which suggests that}} male primates can discriminate between their own offspring and the offspring of others. In one study, researchers analysed the DNA of 75 juvenile baboons to conclude who fathered them. They found that males selectively cared for their own offspring, particularly when their offspring became involved in aggressive confrontations which posed the possibility of injuries or {{a threat to their}} social standing. Evidently, if males can discriminate between their own offspring and the offspring of others, <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> purpose in the female attempting to create paternity confusion during the pregnancy stage. This would be counter-intuitive, as, once the offspring is born, the males will know whether the offspring is, or is not, their own. Future research will need to be conducted in this vein to investigate whether males in other species show the ability to discriminate between their own offspring and the offspring of others before coming to any decisive conclusions.|$|E
25|$|By {{assuming}} a deterministic physical universe, the objection can be formulated more precisely. When a person decides {{to walk across}} a room, it is generally understood {{that the decision to}} do so, a mental event, immediately causes a group of neurons in that person's brain to fire, a physical event, which ultimately results in his walking across the room. The problem is that if there is something totally nonphysical causing a bunch of neurons to fire, <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> physical event which causes the firing. This means that some physical energy is required to be generated against the physical laws of the deterministic universe—this is by definition a miracle and there can be no scientific explanation of (repeatable experiment performed regarding) where the physical energy for the firing came from. Such interactions would violate the fundamental laws of physics. In particular, if some external source of energy is responsible for the interactions, then this would violate the law of the conservation of energy. Dualistic interactionism has therefore been argued against in that it violates a general heuristic principle of science: the causal closure of the physical world.|$|E

25|$|In this schema, {{three main}} {{prerequisites}} are posited for globalization to occur. The {{first is the}} idea of Eastern Origins, which shows how Western states have adapted and implemented learned principles from the East. Without the traditional ideas from the East, Western globalization would not have emerged the way it did. The second is distance. The interactions amongst states were not on a global scale and most often were confined to Asia, North Africa, the Middle East, and certain parts of Europe. With early globalization, it was difficult for states to interact with others that were not within close proximity. Eventually, technological advances allowed states to learn of others' existence and another phase of globalization was able to occur. The third has to do with interdependency, stability, and regularity. If a state is not dependent on another, <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> way for either state to be mutually affected by the other. This is one of the driving forces behind global connections and trade; without either, globalization would not have emerged the way it did and states would still be dependent on their own production and resources to function. This is one of the arguments surrounding the idea of early globalization. It is argued that archaic globalization did not function in a similar manner to modern globalization because states were not as interdependent on others as they are today.|$|E
25|$|The tackle is {{complete}} when the ball-carrier {{is brought to}} the ground; this is judged {{to be the case}} as soon as a knee touches the ground while being held by the opposition. The tackler is designated as any player that also goes to ground when making the tackle. If no player goes to ground when tackling a player, <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> tackler. The tackler has to immediately let the tackled player go and get to their feet before attempting to compete for the ball. If they do not get to their feet, they must roll away from the tackled player. The player that is tackled must immediately play the ball by pushing, passing or placing it in any direction. If a player is involved in the tackle, but does not go to ground, they must also release the tackled player, allowing them the chance to play the ball. Only players on their feet, and supporting their own weight, may pick up the ball and any players on the ground must not prevent them from gaining possession. Except for the tackler (player who went to ground when making the tackle) and the tackled player, all other players must enter the tackle area from behind the ball. The tackle must not be dangerous. Dangerous tackles are ones that make contact with their opponent around their neck or head, with a locked elbow and extended arm ("stiff arm"), without using their arms ("shoulder charge"), when they are in the air, when they don't have the ball, or ones that drive or drop a players head or neck into the ground while their feet are in the air ("spear tackle"). Using a foot to trip a player is also illegal.|$|E
500|$|His view, {{supported}} by many economists and commentators at the time, was that creditor nations {{may be just}} as responsible as debtor nations for disequilibrium in exchanges and that both should be under an obligation to bring trade back into a state of balance.

In the words of Geoffrey Crowther, then editor of The Economist, [...] "If the economic relationships between nations are not, by one means or another, brought fairly close to balance, <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> set of financial arrangements that can rescue the world from the impoverishing results of chaos." ...|$|E

500|$|In particular, Fodor {{criticizes the}} instrumentalism of Daniel Dennett.

Now, according to Fodor, if one remains at this level of analysis, <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> possibility of explaining why the intentional strategy works:There is ... a standard objection to instrumentalism ...: it is difficult to explain why the psychology of beliefs/desires works so well, if the psychology of beliefs/desires is, in fact, false.... As Putnam, Boyd and others have emphasized, from the predictive successes of a theory to the truth of that theory there is surely a presumed inference; and this is even more likely when ... we are dealing with the only theory in play which is predictively crowned with success. It is not obvious ... why such a presumption should not militate in favour of a realist conception ... of the interpretations of beliefs/desires.|$|E
500|$|The Hurricane Research Division of the Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory {{created the}} r-CLIPER (rainfall {{climatology}} and persistence) model {{to act as}} a baseline for all verification regarding tropical cyclone rainfall.

[...] There is a definite advantage to using the forecast track with r-CLIPER because it could be run out 120hours/5days with the forecast track of any tropical cyclone globally within a short amount of time. [...] The short range variation which uses persistence is the Tropical Rainfall Potential technique (TRaP) technique, which uses satellite-derived rainfall amounts from microwave imaging satellites and extrapolates the current rainfall configuration forward for 24hours along the current forecast track. [...] This technique's main flaw is that it assumes a steady state tropical cyclone which undergoes little structural change with time, which is why it is only run forward for 24hours into the future.|$|E
