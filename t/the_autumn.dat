5|$|A {{strategy}} {{for dealing with}} seasonal plenty is to eat {{as much as possible}} and store the surplus nutrients as fat. Marmots do this, and may be 50% heavier in <b>the</b> <b>autumn</b> than in the spring. They rely on their fat reserves during their long winter hibernation. Beavers feed on the leaves, buds, and inner bark of growing trees, as well as aquatic plants. They store food for winter use by felling small trees and leafy branches in <b>the</b> <b>autumn</b> and immersing them in their pond, sticking the ends into the mud to anchor them.

5|$|After Sercey {{returned}} to Île de France his squadron broke up.

By the time this force {{returned to}} Île de France Sercey had sailed to Batavia, leaving instructions for Forte and Prudente to follow him.

Sercey was furious, but could do nothing to alter Malartic's arrangements.|$|E
