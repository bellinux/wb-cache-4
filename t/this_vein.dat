40|$|A {{communicating}} vein {{between the}} left renal vein {{and the left}} ascending lumbar vein has only rarely {{been reported in the}} imaging literature. There are very few reports of varicosity of <b>this</b> communicating <b>vein.</b> Nonetheless, awareness about <b>this</b> communicating <b>vein</b> is of utmost importance for surgeons performing aortoiliac surgeries and nephrectomies as it may pose technical difficulties during surgery or cause life-threatening retroperitoneal hemorrhage. Varicosity of this venous channel may be mistaken for paraaortic lymphadenopathy, adrenal pseudo-mass, or renal artery aneurysm. We report a case of a patient with varicosity of <b>this</b> communicating <b>vein,</b> which mimicked a left renal artery aneurysm. A novel hypothesis is also proposed to explain the relationship with abdominal pain...|$|R

5|$|The artistic {{community}} appreciated {{his work}} in <b>this</b> <b>vein,</b> and Rodin was invited to Paris Salons by such friends as writer Léon Cladel.

French statesman Leon Gambetta expressed a desire to meet Rodin, and the sculptor impressed him when they met at a salon. Gambetta spoke of Rodin in turn to several government ministers, likely including , the Undersecretary of the Ministry of Fine Arts, whom Rodin eventually met.|$|E
5|$|Gibbs, now 18, {{returned}} to the reserves {{for much of the}} following season. Watford's first-team struggled, failing to win any of their first nine league games. Although his first start of the season ended in an 2–0 defeat to Queens Park Rangers, Gibbs retained his place for 10 of the remaining 11 matches, experiencing only one further defeat. Continuing in <b>this</b> <b>vein,</b> 1985–86 saw Gibbs establish himself as the team's first choice right-back. He missed only two games all season, both of which resulted in defeat for Watford. His first goal came on 5 April 1986 in a 4–1 home victory over Newcastle United, while he also played in a 5–1 win over Chelsea at Stamford Bridge {{on the final day of}} the season. Gibbs' consistency helped him to third place in the voting for the club's Player of the Season award.|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY: Vein of Galen aneurysmal malformations (VGAM) are {{characterized}} by multiple arterio-venous connections draining into a markedly enlarged median draining <b>vein.</b> <b>This</b> ectatic <b>vein</b> is not the vein of Galen, but its embryonic precursor, the median prosencephalic vein of Markowski. During normal development, the posterior portion of the median prosencephalic vein persists as the vein of Galen, while its anterior portion regresses in parallel {{with the formation of}} the internal cerebral veins (ICV). It has been traditionally thought that, in children with a VGAM, the deep venous system does not connect to and, a fortiori, does not drain into the ectatic median prosencephalic vein/vein of Galen. This report describes a case of successfully treated VGAM in which the drainage of an ICV into the vein of Galen was only demonstrated by follow-up MR imaging and venography. The potential implications of this finding for the management of VGAMs are discussed. Vein of Galen aneurysmal malformations (VGAMs) are in-tracranial vascular lesions typical of the pediatric popula-tion. They {{are characterized}} by multiple arteriovenous con-nections draining into a markedly enlarged median draining <b>vein.</b> <b>This</b> ectatic <b>vein</b> is not, however, the vein of Galen per se, but its embryonic precursor, the median prosencephalic vei...|$|R

5|$|The {{committee}} {{found that}} the CMF was a hollow shell of its former self, depleted in numbers and in equipment and unable to adequately fulfil its tasks. However, it still {{found that the}}re was a role for the CMF to play in the strategic environment that existed at the time, although it would no longer be called upon to provide the base upon which mobilisation {{in a time of war}} would be built, instead it would be used to augment the Regular Army. This was the first step in creating the concept of a total force, in which the differing virtues of the citizen soldier and the regular soldier would be used to complement each other, and in <b>this</b> <b>vein</b> the Millar Report recommended that the name be changed from the CMF to the Australian Army Reserve.|$|E
5|$|Well-known poets of the Edwardian {{era of the}} 1890s, such as Alfred Austin, Stephen Phillips, and William Watson, {{had been}} working {{very much in the}} shadow of Tennyson, {{producing}} weak imitations of the poetry of the Victorian era. They continued to work in <b>this</b> <b>vein</b> into {{the early years of the}} 20th century. As the new century opened, Austin was still the serving British Poet Laureate, a post he held up to 1913. In the century's first decade, poetry still had a large audience; volumes of verse published in that time included Thomas Hardy's The Dynasts, Christina Rossetti's posthumous Poetical Works, Ernest Dowson's Poems, George Meredith's Last Poems, Robert Service's Ballads of a Cheechako and John Masefield's Ballads and Poems. Future Nobel Prize winner William Butler Yeats was devoting much of his energy to the Abbey Theatre and writing for the stage, producing relatively little lyric poetry during this period. In 1907, the Nobel Prize for Literature was awarded to Rudyard Kipling.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{many of his}} predecessors, James VI {{actively}} despised Gaelic culture. However, in the 1580s and 1590s he strongly {{promoted the}} literature of the country of his birth in Scots. His treatise, Some Rules and Cautions to be Observed and Eschewed in Scottish Prosody, published in 1584 when he was aged 18, was both a poetic manual and a description of the poetic tradition in his mother tongue, to which he applied Renaissance principles. He became patron and member of a loose circle of Scottish Jacobean court poets and musicians, later called the Castalian Band, which included William Fowler (c. 1560–1612), John Stewart of Baldynneis (c. 1545–c. 1605), and Alexander Montgomerie (c. 1550–98). They translated key Renaissance texts and produced poems using French forms, including sonnets and short sonnets, for narrative, nature description, satire and meditations on love. Later poets that followed in <b>this</b> <b>vein</b> included William Alexander (c. 1567–1640), Alexander Craig (c. 1567–1627) and Robert Ayton (1570–1627). By the late 1590s the king's championing of his native Scottish tradition was to some extent diffused by the prospect of inheriting of the English throne.|$|E

5|$|The {{contention}} that the scene depicts the festival for Athena is fraught with problems. Later sources indicate {{that a number of}} classes of individual who performed a role in the procession are not present in the frieze, these include: the hoplites, the allies in the Delian league, the skiaphoroi or umbrella bearers, the female hydraiphoroi (only male hydrai bearers are portrayed) thetes, slaves, metics, the panathenaic ship, and some would suggest the kanephoros, although there is evidence that she is accounted for. That what we now see {{was meant to be a}} generic image of the religious festival is problematic since no other temple sculpture depicts a contemporary event involving mortals. Locating the scene in mythical or historical time has been the principal difficulty of the line of inquiry. John Boardman has suggested that the cavalry portray the heroization of the marathonomachoi, the hoplites who fell at Marathon in 490, and that, therefore these riders were the Athenians who took part in the last pre-war Greater Panathenaia. In support, he points out, the number of horsemen, chariot passengers (but not charioteers), grooms, and marshals comes to the same as the number Herodotos gives for the Athenian dead: 192. Equally suggestive of a reference to the Persian War, is the similarity several scholars have noted of the frieze to the Apadana sculpture in Persepolis. This has variously been posited to be democratic Athens counter posing itself to oriental tyranny, or, aristocratic Athens emulating the Imperial East. Further to this zeitgeist argument there is J.J. Politt’s {{contention that}} the frieze embodies a Periclean manifesto, which favours the cultural institutions of agones (or contests, as witnessed by the apobatai), sacrifices, and military training as well as a number of other democratic virtues. More recent scholarship pursuing <b>this</b> <b>vein</b> has made the frieze a site of ideological tension between the elite and the demos with perhaps, only the aristocracy present, and merely veiled reference to the ten tribes.|$|E
25|$|Kundera also ventures often into musical matters, {{analyzing}} Czech folk music, {{quoting from}} Leoš Janáček and Bartók. Further in <b>this</b> <b>vein,</b> he interpolates musical excerpts into the text (for example, in The Joke), or discusses Schoenberg and atonality.|$|E
