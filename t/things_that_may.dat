25|$|In America, {{not only}} do U.S. {{students}} receive sex education within school or religious programs, {{but they are also}} educated by their parents. American parents are less prone to influencing their children's actual sexual experiences than they are simply telling their children what they should not do. They promote abstinence while educating their children with <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> make their adolescents not want to engage in sexual activity.|$|E

Several politicians and state institutions run by the FPV released messages warning about terrible <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> happen if Macri was elected president. Scioli claims {{that it was a}} campaign to encourage public awareness. It is rumored that the campaign may have been suggested by the Brazilian João Santana, who organized a similar one in Brazil during the ballotage of Dilma Rousseff and Aécio Neves.|$|E
25|$|For <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> be {{considered}} as two-dimensional objects (like text), front-back reversal cannot usually explain the observed reversal. In {{the same way that}} text {{on a piece of paper}} appears reversed if held up to a light and viewed from behind, text held facing a mirror will appear reversed, because the observer is behind the text. Another way to understand the reversals observed in images of objects that are effectively two-dimensional is that the inversion of left and right in a mirror is due to the way human beings turn their bodies. To turn from viewing the side of the object facing the mirror to view the reflection in the mirror requires the observer to look in the opposite direction. To look in another direction, human beings turn their heads about a vertical axis. This causes a left-right reversal in the image but not an up-down reversal. If a person instead turns by bending over and looking at the mirror image between his/her legs, up-down will appear reversed but not left-right. This sort of reversal is simply a change relative to the observer and not a change intrinsic to the image itself, as with a three-dimensional object.|$|E
500|$|Genesis of the Daleks also {{displays}} {{a battle between}} good and evil. Letts enjoyed {{the fact that the}} story did not have clear heroes and villains, but rather a conflict of principle. The discussion between the Doctor and Davros about the hypothetical viral weapon demonstrates this. Hinchcliffe described it as the [...] "hero meets antihero" [...] moment, with the two engaged in [...] "intellectual grappling". The episode also presents the [...] "moral dilemma" [...] of whether the Doctor should destroy the Daleks, resulting in the famous [...] "Have I the right?" [...] scene. The Doctor's comparison to knowingly killing a child who would {{grow up to be a}} dictator shows how the Doctor's ethics are influenced by his non-linear experience of time. (The Twelfth Doctor would again revisit this theme in the 2015 episodes [...] "The Magician's Apprentice" [...] and [...] "The Witch's Familiar".) He considers the good <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> come out of the Daleks, such as that [...] "many future worlds would become allies". The Doctor's conclusion that he does not have the right is an example of utilitarian reasoning, and a [...] "duty-based ethical" [...] position. Sladen recalled that Baker took the scene very seriously, almost [...] "agonising" [...] over the dialogue.|$|E

500|$|... "Hannah Banana" [...] {{was written}} by series regular Cherry Chevapravatdumrong and {{directed}} by John Holmquist, before {{the conclusion of the}} eighth production season. Commenting on the original development of the episode, series creator and executive producer Seth MacFarlane stated, [...] " [...] was the result of our ongoing desire to let the series stagnate, and kind of evolve <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> have run their course. There's only so many times you can do the Evil Monkey jumping out of that closet, before the joke gets old, and I think often times there's a fear to mess with what works, and change things permanently. [...] We literally retired the Evil Monkey in this episode, and got a great episode out of it, which was worth it, and kind of evolved the series in a way." [...] Singer and actress Candace Marie provided the voice of Miley Cyrus. Marie received the role when her producer alerted her of the audition, and she eventually received a call from the Family Guy casting director a month later. Even though the episode mocked Cyrus, Marie did not think she would upset any of Cyrus' fans. She added that she is a fan herself, and [...] "was very impressed by the way Family Guy developed the episode," [...] and thought it was [...] "a huge compliment for them to refer to Miley as the [...] "perfect popstar."" [...] After voicing Cyrus, Marie was called back to Family Guy to voice Meg's friend Beth for [...] "several upcoming episodes." [...] Marie described Beth as a girl that is [...] "rarely addressed in conversation but loves to chime in whenever she can." [...] The song in the episode sung by Cyrus {{was written by}} Chevapravatdumrong, and composed and performed by Family Guy composer Walter Murphy.|$|E

2500|$|Anesthesia is unique, {{in that it}} is not {{a direct}} means of treatment, rather it allows others to do <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> treat, diagnose, or cure an ailment which would {{otherwise}} be painful or complicated. The best anesthetic, therefore is the one with the lowest risk to the patient that still achieves the endpoints required to complete the procedure. The first stage of an anesthetic is the pre-operative risk assessment made up of the medical history, physical examination and [...] lab tests. Diagnosing a person's pre-operative physical status allows the clinician to minimize anesthetic risks. [...] A well completed medical history will arrive at the correct diagnosis 56% of the time which increases to 73% with a physical examination. [...] Lab tests help in diagnosis but only in 3% of cases, underscoring the need for a full history and physical examination prior to anesthetics. Incorrect pre-operative assessments or preparations are the root cause of 11% of all adverse anesthetic events.|$|E
2500|$|Taboos {{are most}} urgent for {{avoiding}} harm and losses. Inner Commands of the Book of Changes, Ch'ih-sung tzu's Classic, and The Life-dealing Amulets of the Ho-t'u-chi are unanimous {{in saying that}} the gods of heaven and earth who {{are in charge of}} misdeeds make deductions from people's three-day reckonings according to the degree of their wrongdoing. As these reckonings decrease, a man becomes poorer and falls ill; frequently he suffers anxiety. When no more are left, he dies. Since there are hundreds of <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> give rise to deductions, I cannot give a complete account. It is also said that there are Three Corpses [...] in our bodies, which, though not corporeal, actually are of a type with our inner, ethereal breaths, the powers, the ghosts, and the gods [...] They want us to die prematurely. (After death they become a man's ghost and move about at will to where sacrifices and libations are being offered.) Therefore, every fifty-seventh day of the sixty-day cycle they mount to heaven and personally report our misdeeds to the Director of Fates. Further, during the night of {{the last day of the}} month the hearth god also ascends to heaven and makes an oral report of a man's wrongs. For the more important misdeeds [...] a whole period of three hundred days is deducted. For the minor ones they deduct one reckoning , a reckoning being three days. Personally, I have not yet been able to determine whether this is really so or not, but that is because the ways of heaven are obscure, and ghosts and gods are hard to understand. (6, tr. Ware 1966:115-6) ...|$|E
