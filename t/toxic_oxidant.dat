Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was applied in order to estimate the impact of the <b>toxic</b> <b>oxidant</b> potassium permanganate (PM) on the intracellular structural and functional alterations at the whole cell level using the soil bacteria Arthrobacter oxydans as a model culture. We compared the total melting heat and the temperature of DNA-protein complex (DNP) melting at the PM application prior to the calorimetry measurement and after 24 -h exposure at the concentration range 0. 02 – 1. 4 mM. The initial oxidative effect caused changes in the pattern of the whole cell melting spectra (mainly at the temperature range 56 – 78 °C), the decrease of Tmax °C DNP melting, and did not influence significantly the total heat of bacterial melting at different concentrations of PM. The prolonged effect of permanganate up to 24 h was characterized by a biphasic dose-dependent response to stress estimated by the DSC technique and the colony-forming assay. The low doses of PM (0. 02 and 0. 2 mM) stimulated cell proliferation, and increased the total whole cell melting heat and the temperature of DNP melting. The toxic effect of PM up to 0. 04 mM reduced cell viability, changed the character of multipeaked thermograms, and lowered the total melting heat and the temperature of DNP melting in a concentration-dependent manner. This study presents the DSC method for evaluating and monitoring the effects of exposure to potential human and environmental toxicants...|$|E

Many studies of oxidative damage in atherosclerosis previously have concentrated on damage by nonhalogenated oxidants, but HOCl is a highly <b>toxic</b> <b>oxidant</b> produced by myeloperoxidase in phagocytes, which {{is also likely to}} be important in the disease pathogenesis. Currently some controversy exists over the products resulting from reaction of HOCl with LDL lipids, in particular regarding whether predominantly chlorohydrins or lipid peroxides are formed. In this study LC-MS of phosphatidylcholines in human LDL treated either with HOCl or the myeloperoxidase system was used as a specific method to detect chlorohydrin and peroxide formation simultaneously, and with comparable sensitivity. Chlorohydrin products from lipids containing oleic, linoleic and arachidonic acids were detected, but no hydroperoxides of linoleoyl or arachidonoyl lipids could be observed. This study provides the first direct evidence that lipid chlorohydrins rather than peroxides are the major products of HOCL- or myeloperoxidase-treated LDL phospholipids. This in turn provides important information required for the study of oxidative damage in vivo which will allow the type and source of oxidants involved in the pathology of atherosclerosis to be investigated...|$|E

This is not present in other angiotensin-converting enzymes such as enalapril (EPR). The hepatotoxic effect of carbon tetrachloride (CCl 4) may result from induction of reactive oxygen free radicals. The aim {{of this study was to}} analyse the effects of CPR and non-sulphydryl-containing enalapril (EPR) in healthy rats and in rats with CCL 4 -induced toxic hepatitis. The rats were divided into two major groups. The first group consisted of healthy rats, and the second group consisted of rats with CCl 4 -induced toxic hepatitis. Each major group was sub-divided into 3 groups, where CPR, EPR, or a placebo was administered. The resulting 6 sub-groups were analysed for the hepatic effects of CPR and EPR in healthy rats and in rats with CCl 4 -induced toxic hepatitis. Co-administration of CPR or EPR with CCl 4 lead to an increase in hepatic enzyme levels, and to a greater level of liver damage in comparison with CCl 4 alone. In conclusion, both CPR and EPR may lead to hepatotoxicity, and sulphydryl-containing CPR does not appear to protect the liver from the <b>toxic</b> <b>oxidant</b> effect of CCl 4...|$|E

40|$|Modulation of {{intracellular}} antioxidant {{concentration is}} a double-edged sword, {{with both sides}} exploited for potential therapeutic benefits. While antioxidants may hamper the efficacy of chemotherapy by scavenging reactive oxygen species and free radicals, {{it is also possible}} that antioxidants alleviate unwanted chemotherapy-induced toxicity, thus allowing for increased chemotherapy doses. Under normoxic environment, antioxidants neutralize <b>toxic</b> <b>oxidants,</b> such as reactive oxygen species (ROS), maintaining them within narrow boundaries level. This redox balance is achieved by various scavenging systems such as enzymatic system (e. g., superoxide dismutases, catalase, and peroxiredoxins), nonenzymatic systems (e. g., glutathione, cysteine, and thioredoxin), and metal-binding proteins (e. g., ferritin, metallothionein, and ceruloplasmin) that sequester prooxidant metals inhibiting their participation in redox reactions. On the other hand, therapeutic strategies that promote oxidative stress and eventually tumor cells apoptosis have been explored based on availability of chemotherapy agents that inhibit ROS-scavenging systems. These contradictory assertions suggest that antioxidant supplementation during chemotherapy treatment can have varied outcomes depending on the tumor cellular context. Therefore, understanding the antioxidant-driven molecular pathways might be crucial to design new therapeutic strategies to fight cancer progression...|$|R
40|$|In this study, the {{production}} of the highly <b>toxic</b> <b>oxidant</b> hypochlorous acid (HOCl) by the phagocytic enzyme myeloperoxidase (MPO) was quantitated and the concomitant alterations of low density lipoprotein (LDL) were analyzed in view of the potential role of LDL in atherosclerosis. Using the monochlorodimedone assay, it was found that HOCl is produced in micromolar concentrations. The kinetics of the decrease of tryptophan fluorescence appeared to be a sensitive method to monitor LDL alterations under near in vivo conditions. Therefore, this method was used to subsequently compare the effectiveness of MPO inhibitors that block production of HOCl with compounds that act as HOCl traps. The efficiency of MPO inhibitors to prevent LDL damage increased in the series benzohydroxamic acid 6 salicylhydroxamic acid 6 3 -amino- 1, 2, 4 -triazole 6 sodium azide 6 potassium cyanide 6 p-hydroxy-benzoic acid hydrazide, while for the HOCl traps the protective efficiency increased in the series glycine 6 taurine 6 methionine.

We investigated the mechanism of H 2 O 2 toxicity for L. donovani chagasi promastigotes, and factors responsible for their relative H 2 O 2 resistance. There was a dose-dependent toxic effect of H 2 O 2 for promastigotes isolated during logarithmic phase of growth. In contrast, stationary phase promastigotes were less susceptible to H 2 O 2 toxicity, and more infectious for BALB/c mice. By spin trapping we found that hydroxyl radical (.

OH was generated after the addition of H 2 O 2 to the cytosol but not the membranes of fractionated promastigotes, and the magnitude of. OH was greater in log than in stationary promastigote cytosol. Deferoxamine inhibition suggested that intracellular promastigote iron catalyzes. OH formation via the Fenton reaction. Furthermore, exposure of log-phase promastigotes to heat shock induced a relative H 2 O 2 -resistant state, which {{was not associated with}} a decrease in.

To further define skin and lung responses to O(3) exposure, SKH- 1 hairless mice were exposed to either 0. 8 ppm of O(3) (a level occasionally reached in very polluted areas) or ambient air 6 h/day for 6 consecutive days. O(3) exposure resulted in the depletion of alpha-tocopherol in lung and plasma and induction in both skin and lung of heme oxygenase 1, cyclooxygenase 2, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen. O(3) -exposed animals showed a similar extent of upregulation of COX- 2 and PCNA in lung and skin, whereas HO- 1 was more responsive in skin than in lung (7 -fold induction vs. 2 -fold induction). In addition to these measures of response to oxidative stress, O(3) exposure led to the activation of nuclear factor kappaB measured as IkappaBalpha phosphorylation in both tissues. We conclude that in this model, O(3) at high pollutant levels is able to affect both lung and skin biology, inducing depletion of alpha-tocopherol and inducing stress-related responses in both skin epidermis and respiratory tract epithelium...|$|E

However, neutrophil activation and accumulation into tissues trigger tissue damage due to release of a plethora of <b>toxic</b> <b>oxidants</b> and proteases, a cause of acute lung injury (ALI). Despite its clinical importance, the molecular regulation of neutrophil migration is poorly understood. The small GTPase Rap 1 b is generally viewed as a positive regulator of immune cell functions by controlling bidirectional integrin signaling. However, we found that Rap 1 b-deficient mice exhibited enhanced neutrophil recruitment to inflamed lungs and enhanced susceptibility to endotoxin shock. Unexpectedly, Rap 1 b deficiency promoted the transcellular route of diapedesis through endothelial cell. Increased transcellular migration of Rap 1 b-deficient neutrophils in vitro was selectively mediated by enhanced PI 3 K-Akt activation and invadopodia-like protrusions. Akt inhibition in vivo suppressed excessive Rap 1 b-deficient neutrophil migration and associated endotoxin shock. The inhibitory action of Rap 1 b on PI 3 K signaling may be mediated by activation of phosphatase SHP- 1. Thus, this study reveals an unexpected role for Rap 1 b as a key suppressor of neutrophil migration and lung inflammation...|$|R

In the present study, we investigated the role of human thioredoxin (hTRX) in the acquisition of cellular resistance to cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (II) (CDDP). The expression and activity of hTRX in Jurkat T cells was dose-dependently enhanced by exposure to CDDP, as determined by immunoblot analysis and insulin reducing assay. Furthermore, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase analysis using the hTRX promoter-reporter gene construct revealed that treatment of Jurkat cells with CDDP caused transcriptional activation of the hTRX gene, which might be mediated through increased generation of intracellular reactive oxygen intermediates. To examine the biological significance of hTRX induction, we established hTRX-overexpressing derivatives of L 929 fibrosarcoma cells by stable transfection with the hTRX cDNA. The clones, which constitutively expressed the exogenous hTRX, displayed increased resistance to CDDP-induced cytotoxicity, compared with the control clones. After exposure to CDDP, the control cells showed {{a significant increase in}} the intracellular accumulation of peroxides, whereas the hTRX-transfected cells did not.

40|$|Abstract: Molecular oxygen is toxic for {{anaerobic}} organisms {{but it is}} also {{obvious that}} oxygen is poisonous to aerobic organisms as well, since oxygen plays an essential role for inducing molecular damage. Molecular oxygen is a triplet radical in its ground-stage (. O-O.) and has two unpaired electrons that can undergoes consecutive reductions of one electron and generates other more reactive forms of oxygen known as free radicals and reactive oxygen species. These reactants (including superoxide radicals, hydroxyl radicals) possess variable degrees of toxicity. Nitric oxide (NO•) contains one unpaired electron and is, therefore, a radical. NO • is generated in biological tissues by specific nitric oxide synthases and acts as an important biological signal. Excessive nitric oxide production, under pathological conditions, leads to detrimental effects of this molecule on tissues, which can be attributed to its diffusion-limited reaction with superoxide to form the powerful and <b>toxic</b> <b>oxidant,</b> peroxynitrite. Reactive oxygen and nitrogen species are molecular “renegades”; these highly unstable products tend to react rapidly with adjacent molecules, donating, abstracting, or even sharing their outer orbital electron(s). This reaction not only changes the target molecule, but often passes the unpaired electron along to the target, generating a second free radical, which can then go on to react with a new target amplifying their effects.

At the end of 4 h after ligation, the rats were sacrificed and ulcer index, gastric juice volume, pH and other biochemical parameter of gastric juice were evaluated. Stomachs of rats were evaluated biochemically to determine oxidant and antioxidant parameters. Pretreatment with gallic acid significantly decreased ulcer index, gastric juice volume, free and total acidity, total protein, DNA content and increased pH and carbohydrates concentration. Gallic acid at a dose of 100 and 200 mg/kg exerted 69. 7 and 78. 9 % ulcer inhibition, respectively. The levels of superoxide dismutase, catalase, reduced glutathione, glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidise, glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase were increased while reduction in myeloperoxidase and lipid peroxidation were observed in the stomach tissues of the drug treated rats. The histopathological studies further confirmed the antiulcer activity of gallic acid.

The expression of manganese superoxide dismutase mRNA was shown to increase in most of the immortal chicken embryo fibroblast (CEF) cells tested, while expression of catalase mRNA appeared to be dramatically decreased in all immortal CEF cells compared to their primary counterparts. The expression of copper–zinc superoxide dismutase mRNA was shown to increase slightly in some immortal CEF cells. The glutathione peroxidase expressed relatively similar levels in both primary and immortal CEF cells. As primary and immortal DF- 1 CEF cells were treated with 10 – 100 μM of hydrogen peroxide (concentrations known to be sublethal in human diploid fibroblasts), immortal DF- 1 CEF cells were shown to be more sensitive to hydrogen peroxide, and total cell numbers were dramatically reduced when compared with primary cell counterparts. This increased sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide in immortal DF- 1 cells occurred without evident changes in either antioxidant gene expression, mitochondrial membrane potential, cell cycle distribution or chromatin condensation. However, the total number of dead cells without chromatin condensation was dramatically elevated in immortal DF- 1 CEFs treated with hydrogen peroxide, indicating that the inhibition of immortal DF- 1 cell growth by low concentrations of hydrogen peroxide is due to increased necrotic cell death, but not apoptosis.

40|$|Reactive oxygen {{intermediates}} {{generated by}} the phagocyte NADPH oxidase are critically important components of host defense. However, these highly <b>toxic</b> <b>oxidants</b> can cause significant tissue injury during inflammation; thus, {{it is essential that}} their generation and inactivation are tightly regulated. We show here that an endogenous proline-arginine (PR) -rich antibacterial peptide, PR- 39, inhibits NADPH oxidase activity by blocking assembly of this enzyme through interactions with Src homology 3 domains of a cytosolic component. This neutrophil-derived peptide inhibited oxygen-dependent microbicidal activity of neutrophils in whole cells and in a cell-free assay of NADPH oxidase. Both oxidase inhibitory and direct antimicrobial activities were defined within the amino-terminal 26 residues of PR- 39. Oxidase inhibition was attributed to binding of PR- 39 to the p 47 phox cytosolic oxidase component. Its effects involve both a polybasic amino-terminal segment and a proline-rich core region of PR- 39 that binds to the p 47 phox Src homology 3 domains and, thereby, inhibits interaction with the small subunit of cytochrome b 558, p 22 phox. These findings suggest that PR- 39, which {{has been shown to be}} involved in tissue repair processes, is a multifunctional peptide that can regulate NADPH oxidase production of superoxide anion O 2 -. thus limiting excessive tissue damage during inflammation...|$|R

Forty-four patients were selected and classified as having intermittent or persistent asthma (mild, moderate or severe). The spontaneous or phorbol myristate acetate (PMA, 30 nM) -induced superoxide release by granulocytes and monocytes was determined at 0, 5, 15, and 25 min. cGPx activity was assayed spectrophotometrically. The spontaneous superoxide release by granulocytes from patients with mild (N = 15), moderate (N = 12) or severe (N = 6) asthma was higher at 25 min compared to healthy individuals (N = 28, P 0. 05 in all times of incubation, Duncan test). cGPx activity of granulocytes and monocytes from patients with persistent asthma (N = 20) was also similar to healthy individuals (N = 10, P > 0. 05, Kruskal-Wallis test). We conclude that, under specific circumstances, granulocytes from children with persistent asthma present a higher respiratory burst activity compared to healthy individuals.

This change was significantly attenuated by rebamipide at a concentration less than 1 mM, showing that rebamipide may inhibit oxidant production from H pylori elicited neutrophils. To assess whether rebamipide attenuates gastric mucosal injury, we tested its inhibitory action on H pylori induced gastric mucosal damage associated with neutrophils in vitro. Rabbit gastric mucosal cells were monolayered in culture wells and coincubated with human neutrophils and H pylori, and the cytotoxicity index was then calculated. Cultured gastric cells were significantly damaged when they were incubated with human neutrophils activated by H pylori. This cellular damage was attenuated by rebamipide in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, spectrophotometrical measurement showed that rebamipide (1 mM) inhibits urease activity by 21. 7 %. As monochloramine (an oxidant yielded by reaction of neutrophil derived chlorinated oxidant and ammonia) is proposed as an important toxic molecule in this model, the current findings suggest that the preventive effect of rebamipide on H pylori elicited neutrophil induced gastric mucosal injury may result from its inhibitory actions on the neutrophilic oxidative burst as well as H pylori derived urease activity...|$|R

Ca 24 transients and the corresponding Ca 24 currents were elicited by 300 -msec depolarizing pulses from- 40 to 0 mV. Within 200 seconds after HOCI addition, the amplitude of the Ca 2 + transients was reduced from 402 ± 89 to 82 + 29 nM (p< 0. 01) while intracellular free Ca 24 concentration ([Ca 2 + 1]) increased from 78 ±+ 16 to 265 +± 48 nM (p< 0. 01). During this time, the amplitude of the slow inward currents increased by 10 %, while steady-state holding current remained stable.

Iron in the circulation and in extravascular fluid remains nonreactive by binding with transferrin, which delivers ferric ion (Fe 3 +) to transferrin receptors (TFR) located on cell membranes. One TFR together with four transferrin-bound Fe 3 + (two per transferrin) is internalized into endocytotic vesicle, where Fe 3 + is released from transferrin at low pH (~ 5.6 – 6.2) and reduced by metalloreductase STEAP (six transmembrane epithelial antigen of the prostate) proteins to ferrous ion (Fe 2 +). Fe 2 + can be transported out of endosomes via the divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT 1) and the iron-depleted endosomes recycle TFR back to plasma membrane (Andrews, 2008). Cytosol Fe 2 + is tightly constricted due to the deleterious effects of superoxide formation, which can further lead to Haber–Weiss–Fenton reaction generating the most <b>toxic</b> <b>oxidant,</b> hydroxyl radical (∙OH), in cells (Aisen, 2001). Thus, cytosol Fe 2 + is likely protected in endosomal compartments. There are increasing evidences to support the roles of vesicular trafficking in intracellular iron homeostasis, such as exocyst complex component 6 (EXOC 6, also known as Sec 15 l 1) for the recycling of transferrin {{and the release of}} TFR exocytic vesicles (Lim et al., 2005), and sorting nexin 3 (SNX 3) for the recycling of TFR and iron assimilation (Chen et al., 2013). Beyond these animal models, evidences from confocal-living imaging of reticulocytes show that TFR-containing vesicles colocalize transiently with mitochondria and endosomal iron is released into mitochondrial compartments (Sheftel et al., 2007). However, the molecules mediating the fusion events of TFR recycling still remain to be identified.|$|E

We found no correlation between Prx levels and {{the duration of the}} after-ripening period required before germination. Thus, Prxs are unlikely to contribute to maintenance of dormancy. RNA interference lines almost devoid of AtPER 1 protein developed and germinated normally under standard growth room conditions. However, seeds from lines overexpressing PER 1 were less inclined to germinate than wild-type seeds in the presence of NaCl, mannitol, and methyl viologen, suggesting that Prx can sense harsh environmental surroundings and play a part in the inhibition of germination under unfavorable conditions...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Eosinophilic influx is {{characteristic}} of numerous inflammatory conditions. Eosinophil peroxidase (EPO) is a major enzyme present in eosinophils and upon degranulation, becomes re-leased into the airways of asthmatics. As {{a result of its}} cationic nature and its ability to catalyze the formation of highly <b>toxic</b> <b>oxidants,</b> EPO has signif-icant potential to induce cellular injury. The focus {{of the present study was}} to determine the cell-signaling events important in EPO-induced death of lung epithelial cells. In the presence of hydrogen peroxide and nitrite (NO 2 –; hereafter called EPO with substrates), EPO catalyzes the formation of nitrogen dioxide. EPO with substrates induced rapid and sustained activation of c-Jun-NH 2 -termi-nal kinase (JNK) and led to cell death, as was evidenced by enhanced mitochondrial depolariza-tion, cytochrome c release, cleavage of caspases 9 and 3, poly-adenosine 5 -diphosphate ribosylation of proteins, the formation of single-stranded DNA, and membrane permeability. Moreover, EPO with substrates caused Rho-associated coiled coil-con-taining kinase- 1 -dependent dynamic membrane blebbing. Inhibition of JNK activity in cells ex-pressing a dominant-negative JNK- 1 construct (JNK-APF) prevented mitochondrial membrane depolarization and substantially decreased the number of cells blebbing compared with vector controls. The cellular responses to EPO with sub-strates were independent of whether NO 2 –, bro-mide–, or thiocyanide – was used as substrates. Our findings demonstrate that catalytically active EPO is capable of causing significant damage to lung epithelial cells in vitro and that this involves th...|$|R
40|$|The {{therapeutic}} effect of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) {{is thought to}} be due mainly to its inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, but there is {{a growing body of research}} that now demonstrates a variety of NSAIDs effects on cellular signal transduction pathways other than those involving prostaglandins. Nitric oxide (NO) as a free radical and an agent that gives rise to highly <b>toxic</b> <b>oxidants</b> (peroxynitrile, nitric dioxide, nitron ion), becomes a cause of neuronal damage and death in some brain lesions such as Parkinson and Alzheimer disease, and Huntington's chorea. In the present study, the in vivo effect of three NSAIDs (lysine clonixinate (LC), indomethacine (INDO) and meloxicam (MELO)) on NO production and nitric oxide synthase expression in rat cerebellar slices was analysed. Rats were treated with (a) saline, (b) lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (5 mg kg− 1, i. p.), (c) saline in combination with different doses of NSAIDs and (d) LPS in combination with different doses of NSAIDs and then killed 6 h after treatment. NO synthesis, evaluated by Bred and Snyder technique, was increased by LPS. This augmentation was inhibited by coadministration of the three NSAIDs assayed. None of the NSAIDs tested was able to modify control NO synthesis. Expression of iNOS and neural NOS (nNOS) was detected by Western blotting in control and LPS-treated rats. LC and INDO, but not MELO, were able to inhibit the expression of these enzymes. Therefore, reduction of iNOS and nNOS levels in cerebellum may explain, in part, the anti-inflammatory effect of these NSAIDs and may also have importance in the prevention of NO-mediated neuronal injury...|$|R
40|$|This article {{reviews the}} pathophysiologic concept that {{superoxide}} and hydrogen peroxide, generated by activated leukocytes, together with low-molecular-weight chelate iron derived from fecal sources and from denatured hemoglobin, amplify the inflammatory response and subsequent mucosal damage {{in patients with}} active episodes of ulcerative colitis. The putative pathogenic mechanisms reviewed are as follows: (l) Dietary iron is concentrated in fecal material owing to normally limited iron absorption. (2) Mucosal bleeding, characteristic of ulcerative colitis, as well as supplemental oral iron therapy for chronic anemia, further conspire to maintain or elevate mucosal iron concentration in colitis. (3) Fenton chemistry, driven especially by leukocyte-generated superoxide and hydrogen peroxide, leads to formation of hydroxyl radicals. (4) The resultant oxidative stress leads to the extension and propagation of crypt abscesses, either through direct membrane disruption by lipid peroxidation or through generation of secondary <b>toxic</b> <b>oxidants</b> such as chloramines. (5) Chemotactic products of lipid peroxidation, including 4 -hydroxynonenal, provide positive feedback to accelerate this inflammatory/oxidative process, leading to acute exacerbations of the disease. (6) Other oxidized products, such as oxidized tryptophan metabolites, created by free radical mechanisms {{in or near the}} mucosa, may act as carcinogens or tumor promotors that contribute to the exceedingly high incidence of colon carcinoma in patients suffering from chronic ulcerative colitis. In this way, self-sustaining cycles of oxidant formation may amplify flare-ups of inflammation and mucosal injury in ulcerative colitis. This concept, if proved correct by subsequent research, would provide a rationale for several novel clinical approaches to the management of ulcerative colitis, including use of SOD mimetics, iron chelators, and chain-breaking antioxidants...|$|R
40|$|The free {{radicals}} nitric oxide and superoxide anion {{react to form}} peroxynitrite (ONOO-), a highly <b>toxic</b> <b>oxidant</b> species. In vivo formation of ONOO- has been demonstrated in shock and inflammation. Herein we provide evidence that cytotoxicity in cells exposed to ONOO- is mediated by DNA strand breakage and the subsequent activation of the DNA repair enzyme poly(ADP ribose) synthetase (PARS). Exposure to ONOO- (100 microM to 1 mM) inhibited mitochondrial respiration in cultured J 774 macrophages and in rat aortic smooth muscle cells. The loss of cellular respiration was rapid, peaking 1 - 3 h after ONOO- exposure, and reversible, with recovery {{after a period of}} 6 - 24 h. The inhibition of mitochondrial respiration was paralleled by a dose-dependent increase in DNA strand breakage, reaching its maximum at 20 - 30 min after exposure to ONOO-. We observed a dose-dependent increase in the activity of PARS in cells exposed to ONOO-. Inhibitors of PARS such as 3 -aminobenzamide (1 mM) prevented the inhibition of cellular respiration in cells exposed to ONOO-. Activation of PARS by ONOO [...] mediated DNA strand breakage resulted in a significant decrease in intracellular energy stores, as reflected by a decline of intracellular NAD+ and ATP content. 3 -Aminobenzamide prevented the loss of NAD+ and ATP in cells exposed to ONOO-. In contrast, impairment of cellular respiration by the addition of the nitric oxide donors S-nitroso-N-acetyl-DL-penicillamine or diethyltriamine nitric oxide complex, was not associated with the development of DNA strand breaks, in concentrations up to 1 mM, and was largely refractory to PARS inhibition. Our results suggest that DNA damage and activation of PARS, an energy-consuming futile repair cycle, {{play a central role in}} ONOO [...] mediated cellular injury...|$|E
40|$|Peroxynitrite is a <b>toxic</b> <b>oxidant</b> species {{produced}} from nitric oxide (NO) and superoxide. We have recently {{observed that the}} cell-permeable superoxide dismutase mimetic Mn(III) tetrakis(4 -benzoic acid) porphyrin (MnTBAP) inhibits the suppression of mitochondrial respiration elicited by authentic peroxynitrite in vitro. Here we have investigated the relative potency of MnTBAP {{and a range of}} related compounds in terms of inhibition of peroxynitrite-induced oxidation and cytotoxicity. In addition, we tested the effects of MnTBAP on the vascular and the cellular energetic failure in rodent models of endotoxic shock. We observed a dose-related inhibition of the peroxynitrite-induced oxidation of dihydrorhodamine 123 to rhodamine by MnTBAP, ZnTBAP and FeTBAP, but not by MnTMPyP [(5, 10, 15, 20 -tetrakis(N-methyl- 4 ′-pirydyl) porphinato) -manganese (III) ]. In addition, MnTBAP, ZnTBAP and FeTBAP, but not MnTMPyP prevented the suppression of mitochondrial respiration by authentic peroxynitrite in cultured J 774 macrophages. In rat cultured aortic smooth muscle cells, MnTBAP protected against the suppression of mitochondrial respiration in response to authentic peroxynitrite, immunostimulation and nitric oxide (NO) donor compounds. MnTBAP slightly reduced the amount of nitrite/nitrate produced in response to immunostimulation in these cells. Administration of MnTBAP, 15 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 i. v., before the administration of endotoxin (15 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, i. v.) to rats ameliorated the development of vascular hyporeactivity and the development of endothelial dysfunction in the thoracic aorta ex vivo. MnTBAP also prevented the endotoxin-induced decrease in mitochondrial respiration, the development of DNA single strand breaks, and the depletion of intracellular NAD+ in peritoneal macrophages ex vivo. MnTBAP did not inhibit the expression by endotoxin of the inducible NO synthase in lung samples. MnTBAP did not alter survival rate in mice challenged with high dose endotoxin. Our findings, taken together with previous data demonstrating protective effects of NO synthase inhibitors against the endotoxin-induced contractile and energetic failure in the models of shock used in the current study, and with the known ability of peroxynitrite to cause cellular energy depletion, suggest a role for peroxynitrite in the pathogenesis of cellular energetic failure and contractile dysfunction in endotoxin shock...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Although many {{drugs are}} {{available}} {{for the treatment of}} gastric ulcers, often these drugs are ineffective. Many antidepressant drugs have been shown to have antiulcer activity in various models of experimental ulcer. One such drug, the antidepressant mirtazapine, has been reported to have an antiulcer effect that involves an increase in antioxidant, and a decrease in oxidant, parameters. To date, however, there is no information available regarding the antiulcer activity for a similar antidepressant, fluvoxamine. This study aimed to investigate the antiulcer effects of fluvoxamine and to determine its relationship with antioxidants. Methods Groups of rats fasted for 24 h received fluvoxamine (25, 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg), ranitidine (50 mg/kg) or distilled water by oral gavage. Indomethacin (25 mg/kg) was orally administered to the rats as an ulcerative agent. Six hours after ulcer induction, the stomachs of the rats were excised and an ulcer index determined. Separate groups of rats were treated with the same doses of fluvoxamine and ranitidine, but not with indomethacin, to test effects of these drugs alone on biochemical parameters. The stomachs were evaluated biochemically to determine oxidant and antioxidant parameters. We used one-way ANOVA and least significant difference (LSD) options for data analysis. Results The 25, 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg doses of fluvoxamine exerted antiulcer effects of 48. 5, 67. 5, 82. 1 and 96. 1 %, respectively, compared to the control rat group. Ranitidine showed an 86. 5 % antiulcer effect. No differences were observed in the absence of indomethacin treatment for any dose of fluvoxamine or for ranitidine. The levels of antioxidant parameters, total glutathione and nitric oxide, were increased in all fluvoxamine groups and in the ranitidine group when compared with the indomethacin-only group. In addition, fluvoxamine and ranitidine decreased the levels of the oxidant parameters, myeloperoxidase and malondialdeyhyde, in the stomach tissues of the rats when compared to indomethacin group. Conclusion We conclude that fluvoxamine has antiulcer effects, and that these occur by a mechanism that involves activation of antioxidant parameters and inhibition of some <b>toxic</b> <b>oxidant</b> parameters. </p...|$|E
30|$|Porous carbon {{material}} (PCM)-based supercapacitors have triggered increasing interest {{during the past}} decades {{by virtue of their}} high power density, fast charge-discharge rate, and long cycling stability [1 – 10]. They have been widely used as power sources for versatile applications requiring quick bursts of energy, such as high-power electronic devices, electric vehicles (EVs), and hybrid EVs [11, 12]. It is well known that the supercapacitive performance of PCMs strongly depends on their nanostructure. Although clear efforts aimed at designing advanced PCMs with well-defined nanostructure for optimizing supercapacitive properties are hot research aspects, e.g., carbon nanospheres [13, 14], carbon nanotubes [15, 16], and carbon nanorods [17, 18], their practical applications are significantly limited by the high cost, multi-step processes, and heavily usage of <b>toxic</b> strong <b>oxidants</b> [19].|$|R
40|$|At {{the onset}} of infection, Leishmania promastigotes are phagocytized by {{mammalian}} macrophages. They must survive despite exposure to <b>toxic</b> <b>oxidants</b> such as hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) and superoxide (. O 2 -) generated during phagocytosis. We investigated {{the effects of these}} oxidants on Leishmania chagasi promastigotes and promastigote mechanisms for oxidant resistance. According to spin trapping and electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometry,. O 2 - could be generated by exposure of promastigotes to the redox-cycling compound menadione. Incubation in either menadione or H 2 O 2 caused a concentration-dependent loss of promastigote viability. However, incubation in sublethal concentrations of H 2 O 2 or menadione caused a stress response in promastigotes. This oxidant-induced response was associated with an increase in the amount of heat shock protein hsp 70. Induction of a stress response by exposure of promastigotes either to heat shock or to sublethal oxidants (H 2 O 2 or menadione) caused promastigotes to become more resistant to H 2 O 2 toxicity. Sublethal menadione also caused promastigotes to become more virulent in a BALB/c mouse model of leishmaniasis. We previously correlated H 2 O 2 cytotoxicity for promastigotes with the formation of hydroxyl radical (. OH) from H 2 O 2. However, according to electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometry, the increase in H 2 O 2 resistance after exposure to sublethal oxidants was not associated with diminished generation (i. e., scavenging) of. OH. These data suggest that there is a cross-protective stress response that occurs after exposure of L. chagasi promastigotes to heat shock or to sublethal H 2 O 2 or. O 2 -, exposures that also occur during natural infection. This response results in increased resistance to H 2 O 2 toxicity and increased virulence for a mammalian host...|$|R
