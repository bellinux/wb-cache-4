40|$|Component {{separation}} for the Planck HFI data {{is primarily}} concerned with the estimation of <b>thermal</b> <b>dust</b> emission, which requires the separation of <b>thermal</b> <b>dust</b> from the cosmic infrared background (CIB). For that purpose, current estimation methods rely on filtering techniques to decouple <b>thermal</b> <b>dust</b> emission from CIB anisotropies, which tend to yield a smooth, low- resolution, estimation of the dust emission. In this paper we present a new parameter estimation method, premise: Parameter Recovery Exploiting Model Informed Sparse Estimates. This method exploits the sparse nature of <b>thermal</b> <b>dust</b> emission to calculate all-sky maps of <b>thermal</b> <b>dust</b> temperature, spectral index and optical depth at 353 GHz. premise is evaluated and validated on full-sky simulated data. We find the percentage difference between the premise results and the true values to be 2. 8, 5. 7 and 7. 2 per cent at the 1 σ level across the full sky for <b>thermal</b> <b>dust</b> temperature, spectral index and optical depth at 353 GHz, respectively. Comparison between premise and a GNILC-like method over selected regions of our sky simulation reveals that both methods perform comparably within high signal-to-noise regions. However outside of the Galactic plane premise is seen to outperform the GNILC-like method with increasing success as the signal-to-noise ratio worsens.

40|$|Using the Planck 2015 {{data release}} (PR 2) {{temperature}} maps, we separate Galactic <b>thermal</b> <b>dust</b> emission from cosmic infrared background (CIB) anisotropies. For this purpose, we implement a specifically tailored component-separation method, the so-called generalized needlet internal linear combination (GNILC) method, which uses spatial information (the angular power spectra) to disentangle the Galactic dust emission and CIB anisotropies. We produce significantly improved all-sky maps of Planck <b>thermal</b> <b>dust</b> emission, with reduced CIB contamination, at 353, 545, and 857 GHz. By reducing the CIB {{contamination of the}} <b>thermal</b> <b>dust</b> maps, we provide more accurate estimates of the local dust temperature and dust spectral index over the sky with reduced dispersion, especially at high Galactic latitudes above b = +/- 20 degrees. We find that the dust temperature is T = (19. 4 +/- 1. 3) K and the dust spectral index is beta = 1. 6 +/- 0. 1 averaged over the whole sky, while T = (19. 4 +/- 1. 5) K and beta = 1. 6 +/- 0. 2 on 21 % of the sky at high latitudes. Moreover, subtracting the new CIB-removed <b>thermal</b> <b>dust</b> maps from the CMB-removed Planck maps gives access to the CIB anisotropies over 60 % of the sky at Galactic latitudes vertical bar b vertical bar > 20 degrees. Because they are a significant improvement over previous Planck products, the GNILC maps are recommended for <b>thermal</b> <b>dust</b> science.

40|$|In this paper, we {{implement}} a perturbative approach, first proposed by Bouchet & Gispert (1999), to estimate variation of spectral index of galactic polarized synchrotron emission, using linear combination of simulated Stokes Q polarization maps of selected frequency bands from WMAP and Planck observations on {{a region of}} sky dominated by the synchrotron Stokes Q signal. We find that, a first order perturbative analysis recovers input spectral index map well. Along with the spectral index variation map our method provides a fixed reference index, β̂_ 0 s, over the sky portion being analyzed. Using Monte Carlo simulations we find that, = - 2. 84 ± 0. 01, which matches very closely with position of a peak at β_s(p) = - 2. 85, of empirical probability density function of input synchrotron indices, obtained from the same sky region. For <b>thermal</b> <b>dust,</b> mean recovered spectral index, = 2. 00 ± 0. 004, from simulations, matches very well with spatially fixed input <b>thermal</b> <b>dust</b> spectral index β_d = 2. 00. As accompanying results of the method we also reconstruct CMB, <b>thermal</b> <b>dust</b> and a synchrotron template component with fixed spectral indices over the entire sky region. We use full pixel-pixel noise covariance matrices of all frequency bands, estimated from the sky region being analyzed, to obtain reference spectral indices for synchrotron and <b>thermal</b> <b>dust,</b> spectral index variation map, CMB map, <b>thermal</b> <b>dust</b> and synchrotron template components. The perturbative technique as implemented in this work has the interesting property that it can build a model to describe the data with an arbitrary but enough degree of accuracy (and precession) as allowed by the data. We argue that, our method of reference spectral index determination, CMB map, <b>thermal</b> <b>dust</b> and synchrotron template component reconstruction is a maximum likelihood method.

40|$|To {{study the}} amount of arsenic {{emission}} from the coal power stations (mainly Permo-Carboniferous coal) in China in different combustion conditions. the arsenic content of the coal. the fly ash and the cinder in high-temperature power stations as well as mid-low temperature power stations have been analyzed. This note provides a rough estimate of {{the total amount of}} arsenic emission as well as emission ratio from steam coal combustion in China. The results show that by combustion of 1 t of Permo-Carboniferous coal (containing roughly 5 mg/kg arsenic), high-temperature power stations emit roughly 0. 40 g arsenic into the atmosphere and the arsenic emission rate is about 7. 70 %: mid-low power stations emit roughly 0. 15 g arsenic into the atmosphere and the arsenic emission rate is about 2. 97 %. a total of 600 million tons coal is burnt annually in China power stations. and the coal comes mainly from Permo-Carboniferous depositing in the North China Plate and northwest China coal mines. Taking the average arsenic content of the coal used at the value of 5 mg/kg. the total annual arsenic emission from steam coal combustion into the atmosphere is about 195. 0 t. Most of the arsenic in coal can be released in the process of coal combustion. and the most of the released arsenic can be seized by the fly ash and then both of them are seized by the <b>dust</b> <b>catcher</b> of power station. so the arsenic emission ratio to the atmosphere is declined: in addition. research on the arsenic emission amount and emission rules from the coal power stations in China should go on the coal power stations with the dry-process <b>dust</b> <b>catchers</b> by the experiments results.

We have {{observed}} several infrared-luminous galaxies {{which are in}} the process of merging (Mkn 231, Arp 299, NGC 6240, NGC 520, and IRAS 17208 - 0014) at 1. 2 mmwith the multi-channel bolometer at the IRAM 30 -meter telescope. Such observations of the long-wavelength <b>thermal</b> <b>dust</b> emission provide an alternative to CO as a measure of the gas mass.

Our calculations are conservative. We have chosen a ν 2 emissivity; other emission laws result in higher dust temperatures. We have made our calculations assuming a metallicity of 2 Z⊙, which is low for a galactic nucleus. We have not assumed any enhancement of the dust emission through agglomeration of dust particles nor destruction of grains. Finally, we have assumed that all of the gas associated with 1. 2 mm <b>thermal</b> <b>dust</b> emission is molecular.

We perform realistic simulations of the Planck observations at the polarized frequency bands from 30 to 353 GHz for two all-sky surveys as expected for the nominal mission. These simulations include CMB, synchrotron and <b>thermal</b> <b>dust</b> Galactic emissions and instrumental noise. (Note that systematic effects are not considered {{in this paper}}). For the synchrotron and <b>thermal</b> <b>dust</b> Galactic emissions we use a coherent 3 D model of the Galaxy describing its mater density and the magnetic field direction and intensity. We first simulate the synchrotron and dust emissions at 408 MHz and 545 GHz, respectively, and then we extrapolate them to the Planck frequency bands. We perform a likelihood analysis to compare the simulated data {{to a set of}} models obtained by varying the pitch angle of the regular magnetic field spatial distribution, the relative amplitude of the turbulent magnetic field, the radial scale of the electron and dust grain distributions, and the extrapolation spectral indices for the synchrotron and <b>thermal</b> <b>dust</b> emissions. We are able to set tight constraints on all the parameters considered. We have also found that the observed spatial variations of the synchrotron and <b>thermal</b> <b>dust</b> spectral indices should not affect our ability to recover the other parameters of the model. From this, we conclude that the Planck satellite experiment can precisely measure the main properties of the Galactic magnetic field.

40|$|We present {{statistical}} analysis of diffuse Galactic synchrotron emission and polarized <b>thermal</b> emission from <b>dust.</b> Both Galactic synchrotron emission and polarized <b>thermal</b> emission from <b>dust</b> reflect statistics of magnetic field fluctuations and, therefore, Galactic turbulence. We mainly focus on the relation between observed angular spectra and underlying turbulence statistics. Our major findings are as follows. First, we find that magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence in the Galaxy can indeed explain diffuse synchrotron emission from high galactic latitude. Our model calculation suggests that either a one-component extended halo model or a two-component model, an extended halo component (scale height � 1 kpc) plus a local component, can explain the observed angular spectrum of the synchrotron emission. However, discrete sources seem to dominate the spectrum for regions near the Galactic plane.

We simultaneously constrain the <b>dust</b> luminosity function, <b>thermal</b> <b>dust</b> spectral energy distribution (SED) and clustering properties of CIB sources, {{and the evolution}} of these quantities over cosmic time. We find that the data strongly require redshift evolution in the <b>thermal</b> <b>dust</b> SED. In our adopted parametrization, this evolution takes the form of an increase in graybody dust temperature at high redshift, but it may also be related to a temperature - dust luminosity correlation or evolution in dust opacity. The counts and spectra together constrain the evolution of the <b>thermal</b> <b>dust</b> luminosity function up to z 2. 5 - 3, complementing approaches relying on rest-frame mid-infrared observations of the rarest bright objects.

We perform a likelihood analysis to compare the maps of the Ka, Q, V and W bands of the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (Wmap) and the 353 GHz Archeops data to the models obtained by varying the pitch angle of the regular magnetic field, the relative amplitude of the turbulent magnetic field and the extrapolation spectral indices of the synchrotron and <b>thermal</b> <b>dust</b> emissions. The best-fit parameters obtained for the different frequency bands are very similar and globally the data seem to favor a negligible isotropic turbulent magnetic field component at large angular scales (an anisotropic line-of-sight ordered component can not be studied using these data). From this study, we conclude that we are able to propose a consistent model of the polarized diffuse Galac- tic synchrotron and <b>thermal</b> <b>dust</b> emissions in the frequency range from 33 to 353 GHz, where most of the CMB studies are performed and where we expect a mixture of these two main foreground emissions.

3000|$|It {{was known}} that {{overexposure}} to airborne respirable dust will cause disabling or fatal respiratory disease, and health problems of coal dust {{have been an}} ongoing occupational health concern. As far as Chinese coal mines, {{it was reported that}} there was over 2.65 million workers exposure to dust and the pneumoconiosis detection percentage was up to 7.2  %, and the number of accumulated pneumoconiosis patients had been over 57, 000 (Zheng 2011). The risks of occupational health of workers, who exposure to coal dust cloud, are directly related to coal metamorphic degree, coal dust concentration, cumulatively exposure time et al. (Naidoo et al. 2005; Belle and Phillips 2009; Onder and Yigit 2009; Qin and Liu 2009; Zhang et al. 2013). For examples, the statistical data from NIOSH (The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health) indicated that: for USA underground coal mines, the pneumoconiosis detection percentage of workers exposure to coal dust had arisen from 4  % to 9  %, from 1999 to 2007, as the mining intensity increased (Hall 2008). If the pneumoconiosis detection percentage of coal workers can be kept or decreased, the key may be dust isolated and removal in working/heading face, where there usually is the highest concentration of coal dust. In terms of the problem of coal dust pollutant in two faces, the most effective method of pollutant removal may be the dust isolated (or removal) by ventilation and collection by <b>dust</b> <b>catchers</b> (Reed et al. 2004; Guo 2007; Li et al. 2007; Wei 2008; Liu et al. 2009; Liu 2011; Kuznetsov et al. 2012; Li et al. 2012; [...] Liu et al. 2012). The <b>dust</b> <b>catchers</b> employed in underground coal mines, can be classified as filtering, centrifugal separation and comprehensive system (Colinet et al. 2005; Black et al. 2007; Shorokhov et al. 2009; Koo et al., 2010; Faschingleitner and Hoflinger 2011; Torano et al. 2011; Konorev and Nesterenko 2012; Li et al. 2013). For examples, the <b>dust</b> <b>catcher</b> usually applied in German underground coal mines, is usually a fiber bag precipitator, its dust collection efficiency is high and the bulk is also large. In Poland, the main <b>dust</b> <b>catcher</b> is a cyclone dust collector, and its collection efficiency is up to 99.3  %, and the dewatering efficiency is also up to 98  %, but the operating resistance is over 2, 300 Pa. The collection efficiencies of the above two dust precipitators are usually higher than 95  %, but they may be not suitable for application in Chinese underground mines. Why is so? In the view of economy to technique ratio and engineering geology, the cross sectional area of heading/mining faces is usually not larger than 15  m 2, and the most part is lower than 10  m 2, especially underground coal mines in central southern and southwestern China such as Hunan, Guizhou, Yunan, etc. Therefore, the advanced dust precipitators, which are employed in Germany, Poland et al., are in too large bulk or too high operating resistance for the majority of Chinese underground coal mines. Comprehensively analyzing research progress at home and abroad, as far as Chinese underground coal mines, the shortcoming of the existing dust collector is that: (1) the efficiency of dust removal is low (about 80  %), or (2) the dewatering rate is low (lower than 85  %), or (3) the operating resistance is high (more than 2, 200  Pa), or (4) the length/width is long/wide (more than 10  m/ 2.5  m), or (5) the bulks are large.|$|R

40|$|Many {{studies of}} {{anomalous}} microwave emission (AME) have computed an AME emissivity {{to compare the}} strength of the AME detected in different regions. Such a value is usually defined as the ratio between the intensity of the AME at 1 [*]cm and the <b>thermal</b> <b>dust</b> emission at 100 [*]μm. However, as studies of Galactic dust emission have shown, the intensity of the <b>thermal</b> <b>dust</b> emission at 100 [*]μm is strongly dependent on the dust temperature, which has severe implications for the AME emissivity defined in this way. In this work, we illustrate and quantify this effect and find that the AME emissivity decreases by a factor of 11. 1 between dust temperatures of 20 and 30 [*]K. We, therefore, conclude that computing the AME emissivity relative to the 100 [*]μm emission does not allow for accurate comparisons between the AME observed in different environments.

We cross-correlate synchrotron, free-free and <b>thermal</b> <b>dust</b> templates with the WMAP 7 -year maps using synchrotron templates at both 408 MHz and 2. 3 GHz to assess the amount of flat synchrotron emission that is present, and the impact that this has on the correlations with the other components. We find that there is only a small amount of flattening visible in the synchrotron spectral indices by 2. 3 GHz, of around Δβ 0. 05, and that the significant level of dust-correlated emission in the lowest WMAP bands is largely unaffected by the choice of synchrotron template, particularly at high latitudes (it decreases by only 7 per cent when using 2. 3 GHz rather than 408 MHz). This agrees with expectation if the bulk of the anomalous emission is generated by spinning dust grains. Comment: 11 pages, 6 figures, 6 tables. Accepted for publication in MNRA...|$|R
40|$|Giga-parsec scale {{alignments}} of the quasar {{optical polarization}} vectors {{have been proven}} to be robust against a scenario of contamination by the Galactic interstellar medium (ISM). This claim has been established by means of optical polarization measurements of the star light surrounding the lines {{of sight of the}} 355 quasars for which reliable optical polarization measurements are available. Taking advantage of the full-sky and high quality polarization data released by the $Planck$ satellite, we provide an independent, complementary and up-to-date estimation of the contamination level of the quasar optical polarization data by the diffuse Galactic <b>thermal</b> <b>dust</b> emission. Our analysis reveals contamination signatures of the quasar optical polarization data by Galactic dust for about twenty per cent of the sample. We provide new arguments showing that Galactic <b>thermal</b> <b>dust</b> cannot account for the reported quasar optical polarization alignments. We provide new and independent quality criteria to apply to the polarization sample for future inquiries in the framework of the cosmological-scale correlations of quasar polarization vector orientations that could compete with the isotropic principle of the cosmological paradigm.

30|$|The <b>dust</b> <b>catchers</b> {{that are}} used in {{underground}} coal mines can be classified, {{on the basis of the}} dedusting mechanisms that they employ, as filtering, centrifugal separation and comprehensive systems (Colinet et al. 2005; Black et al. 2007; Shorokhov et al. 2009; Koo et al. 2010; Faschingleitner and Hoflinger 2011; Torano et al. 2011; Konorev and Nesterenko 2012; Li et al. 2013). In Germany, fibre bag precipitators are usually adopted in underground coal mines because of their high dust collection efficiency. However, they are very bulky. In Poland, cyclone dust collectors have a large share of the market. They bear advantages of a collection efficiency of up to 99.3  % and a dewatering efficiency of up to 98  %. Their disadvantages lie in an operating resistance of over 2, 300  Pa and an even greater bulk than fibre bag precipitators.|$|R

In particular the focus is shifting towards polarized microwave emission with the goal of detecting signature from primordial gravitational waves and inflation.

40|$|Experimental {{evidence}} is adduced for an interstellar carbon grain formation mechanism in which SiC nucleates at higher temperatures than 900 - 1100 C in a hydrogen atmosphere to furnish a surface for subsequent carbon condensation. Studies comparing the {{spatial distribution of}} the 11. 2 -micron SiC feature, or its spectral shape, with <b>thermal</b> <b>dust</b> emission, may further elucidate the present relationship.
