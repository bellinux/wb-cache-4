25|$|Aircraft flight instruments, however, operate using {{pressure}} differential to compute Mach number, not temperature. <b>The</b> <b>assumption</b> <b>is</b> {{that a particular}} pressure represents a particular altitude and, therefore, a standard temperature. Aircraft flight instruments need to operate this way because the stagnation pressure sensed by a Pitot tube is dependent on altitude as well as speed.|$|E
50|$|If <b>the</b> <b>assumptions</b> <b>are</b> violated, a {{possible}} {{solution is to}} use the Greenhouse & Geisser or the Huynh & Feldt adjustments to the degrees of freedom because they can correct for issues that can arise should the sphericity of <b>the</b> covariance matrix <b>assumption</b> <b>be</b> violated.|$|R

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Assumption</b> <b>is</b> {{important}} to many Catholic and Orthodox Christians as the Virgin Mary's heavenly birthday (the day that Mary was received into Heaven). Belief about her acceptance into {{the glory of}} Heaven is seen by some Christians as {{the symbol of the}} promise made by Jesus to all enduring Christians that they too will be received into paradise. The Assumption of Mary is symbolised in the Fleur-de-lys Madonna.|$|E
30|$|<b>The</b> first <b>assumption</b> <b>is</b> a {{well-known}} <b>assumption</b> and <b>is</b> also true in real practice. <b>The</b> second <b>assumption</b> <b>is</b> true for linear seperable systems but not true for nonlinear and inseparable systems.

If <b>the</b> <b>assumption</b> <b>is</b> made in the driver software, success may be version-dependent. In addition, any host device might not support a 4GB SDSC card, since the specification lets it assume that 2GB is the maximum for these cards.|$|E
25|$|Many theologians note {{by way of}} {{comparison}} that in the Catholic Church, <b>the</b> <b>Assumption</b> <b>is</b> dogmatically defined, while in the Eastern Orthodox tradition, the Dormition is less dogmatically than liturgically and mystically defined. Such differences spring from a larger pattern in the two traditions, wherein Catholic teachings are often dogmatically and authoritatively defined – {{in part because of}} the more centralized structure of the Catholic Church – while in Eastern Orthodoxy, many doctrines are less authoritative.|$|E
25|$|The Reut Institute expands {{on these}} {{concerns}} of many Israeli Jews {{and says that}} a one-state scenario without any institutional safeguards would negate Israel's status as a homeland for the Jewish people. When proposed as a political solution by non-Israelis, <b>the</b> <b>assumption</b> <b>is</b> that the idea is probably being put forward {{by those who are}} politically motivated to harm Israel and, by extension, Israeli Jews. They argue that the absorption of millions of Palestinians, along with a right of return for Palestinian refugees, and the generally high birthrate among Palestinians would quickly render Jews an ethnic minority and eliminate their rights to self-determination.|$|E

25|$|The site is {{enclosed}} by a stone wall, {{interrupted by a}} large, paved entrance facing south, uphill towards Hameldown. The wall would have been substantial – in some places its ruins are more than 15 feet (4.5 m) in thickness. However, the site is of limited value from a defensive point of view, so <b>the</b> <b>assumption</b> <b>is</b> that the wall was to keep livestock in, and predators out.

25|$|The bill tip organ is {{a region}} found near {{the tip of}} the bill in several types of birds that forage {{particularly}} by probing. The region has a high density of nerve endings known as the corpuscles of Herbst. This consists of pits in the bill surface which in the living bird is occupied by cells that sense pressure changes. <b>The</b> <b>assumption</b> <b>is</b> that this allows the bird to perform 'remote touch', which means that it can detect movements of animals which the bird does not directly touch. Bird species known to have a 'bill-tip organ' includes members of ibisis, shorebirds of the family Scolopacidae, and kiwis.|$|E
25|$|In Monte Carlo, {{an initial}} {{configuration}} is refined by taking random steps which are accepted or rejected {{based on their}} induced improvement in score (see the Metropolis criterion), until {{a certain number of}} steps have been tried. <b>The</b> <b>assumption</b> <b>is</b> that convergence to the best structure should occur from a large class of initial configurations, only one of which needs to be considered. Initial configurations may be sampled coarsely, and much computation time can be saved. Because of the difficulty of finding a scoring function which is both highly discriminating for the correct configuration and also converges to the correct configuration from a distance, the use of two levels of refinement, with different scoring functions, has been proposed. Torsion can be introduced naturally to Monte Carlo as an additional property of each random move.|$|E

25|$|While in an organization, it is {{important}} to focus on traits and functionalities of leaders from within, it is also key to focus on the relational side of leadership. Being relational with leaders/followers allows for relationships to be built. While looking at the two different models (vertical dyad linkage theory and leader–member exchange theory), different perspectives from each side are gained. For an organization to be democratic, the LMX theory supports the claims of it. The influence of VDL model helped get LMX theory to where it is today. Usually <b>the</b> <b>assumption</b> <b>is</b> leaders can only build close relations with trusted assistants due to lack of time and resources. Leaders developing relations usually results in partnerships with certain followers, but leaders have the responsibility to make relations and offer partnerships to all of the followers (Hackman & Johnson, 2009, pg. 94). Making partnerships with all of the followers will increase the performance of the organization as a whole. Once this relation is built a relation trust is built and more information is able to be revealed to the organization leader.|$|E
