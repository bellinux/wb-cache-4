At present, <b>TAs</b> <b>are</b> classified from different views by many scientists being from various fields. However, there are still some urgent problems that need to <b>be</b> clarified about <b>TAs.</b> The relationships and differences of various <b>TAs</b> <b>are</b> not revealed and a mature, widely accepted and systematic classification has not been established. Based on previous research, <b>TAs</b> <b>are</b> systematically classified in this paper, taking consideration of systematic, hierarchical and practical principles. Firstly, <b>TAs</b> can <b>be</b> divided into global TAs and local TAs in the light of their descriptive spatial extent. Secondly, according to their algorithms, <b>TAs</b> <b>are</b> classified into basic TAs, compound TAs, features TAs and statistical <b>TAs.</b> Thirdly, <b>TAs</b> <b>are</b> distinguished into morphologic TAs and structural TAs according to their descriptive themes. Fourthly, on the basis of the relationship of TAs values and coordinate axes direction, <b>TAs</b> <b>are</b> grouped into geometrical TAs, isotropic TAs, axial TAs, and anisotropic TAs. Moreover, <b>TAs</b> can <b>be</b> labelled as first-order TAs, second-order TAs and multiple-order TAs by partial derivatives degree of elevation data. Being parameters of landform characteristics, <b>TAs</b> <b>are</b> the basis of quantitative geomorphologic research and essential indices that differentiate landform areas. So the classification is helpful in understanding the exact semantic meaning of TAs and their interrelationships for users. And it’s helpful in selecting effectively and reasonably TAs in practice.
