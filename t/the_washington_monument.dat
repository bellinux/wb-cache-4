5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>Monument</b> {{attracted}} enormous crowds {{before it}} officially opened. For {{six months after}} its dedication, 10,041 people climbed the 898 steps and 50 landings to the top. After the elevator {{that had been used}} to raise building materials was altered to carry passengers, the number of visitors grew rapidly, and an average of 55,000 people per month were going to the top by 1888. The annual visitor count peaked between 1979 and 1997, where an average of 1.1 million visitors visited annually; however, from 2005 to 2010, <b>the</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>Monument</b> has had an average of only 631,000 visitors each year. As with all historic areas administered by the National Park Service, the national memorial was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966.|$|E

5|$|A National Park Service {{spokesperson}} {{reported that}} surveys revealed cracks {{near the top}} of <b>the</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>Monument,</b> the world's tallest stone structure, which remained closed for repairs until May 2014. The earthquake severely damaged three of the four pinnacles (corner spires) on the central tower of the Washington National Cathedral, cracked some of its flying buttresses, and caused additional damage. As the cathedral's insurance policy did not cover earthquake damage, cathedral officials stated that they would need to raise millions of dollars to fully evaluate the damage and to stabilize and repair its limestone exterior.|$|E

After this incident, the surrounding grounds were modified in places to restrict the possible unauthorized approach of motor vehicles.|$|E
5|$|Myers and {{his wife}} did the first balloon {{ascension}} on the Fair grounds on July 4 to race the aeronaut Tracy A. Tisdell to draw crowds. A second ascension was done by Myers on August 27.

Myers landed 21 miles from his starting location and Tomlinson ended up hundreds of miles off course before he landed.|$|E
5|$|Secretary of War Jefferson Davis, at Pierce's request, led surveys {{with the}} Corps of Topographical Engineers of {{possible}} transcontinental railroad routes throughout the country. The Democratic Party had long rejected federal appropriations for internal improvements, but Davis felt {{that such a}} project could be justified as a Constitutional national security objective. Davis also deployed the Army Corps of Engineers to supervise construction projects in the District of Columbia, including {{the expansion of the}} United States Capitol and building of <b>the</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>Monument.</b>|$|E
50|$|Other {{memorials}} to Washington were {{erected in}} Maryland {{and in the}} nearby national capital, including the one now in <b>Washington</b> <b>Monument</b> State Park (nearBoonsboro, Maryland and the Appalachian Trail), which was first constructed in 1827. The Boonsboro monument as it now stands reflects at least two rebuildings after the structure had fallen into ruin. In 1848 Mills's <b>Washington</b> <b>Monument</b> in <b>the</b> national capital was begun, {{but it would not}} be completed and dedicated until 1885. Because of this, for decades <b>the</b> Baltimore <b>Washington</b> <b>Monument</b> served as a leading symbol of American pride and gratitude towards George Washington, as a founding father and the first President of the nation. Mid 19th century maps, for instance, pair the Baltimore column with the Capitol building because <b>the</b> <b>Washington,</b> DC <b>monument</b> had only just begun.|$|R
50|$|In early 1848, workers {{started to}} build <b>the</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>Monument's</b> foundation. According to {{historian}} Jesse Holland, {{it is very}} likely that African-American slaves were among the construction workers and stonecutters, given that slavery prevailed in Washington and its surrounding states at that time, and slaves were commonly used in public and private constructions. However, unlike with respect to the White House, no documents attesting to the use of slave labor in the Monument's construction have been found.|$|R

The group traveled with Spike Jones before breaking up in 1955, following his sister's marriage. Sundby moved on to the real estate business.|$|R
5|$|The National Mall is a large, open park in {{downtown}} Washington between the Lincoln Memorial and the United States Capitol. Given its prominence, the mall {{is often the}} location of political protests, concerts, festivals, and presidential inaugurations. <b>The</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>Monument</b> and the Jefferson Pier are {{near the center of}} the mall, south of the White House. Also on the mall are the National World War II Memorial at the east end of the Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool, the Korean War Veterans Memorial, and the Vietnam Veterans Memorial.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by George Meyer and {{directed}} by Wes Archer, {{and it was the}} first episode for which Al Jean and Mike Reiss served as show runners. It features multiple references to the 1939 film Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, including the scene in which Lisa appeals to Lincoln's statue at the Lincoln Memorial for advice. Other Washington landmarks referenced in the episode include the Jefferson Memorial, the Watergate Hotel, the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, the White House, the National Air and Space Museum, and <b>the</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>Monument.</b>|$|E
5|$|The gavel used to ceremonially {{strike the}} {{cornerstone}} three times {{was given by}} Washington to Valentine Reintzel, the Worshipful Master of Lodge 9 of Maryland. After Reintzel's death in 1817, the gavel was donated to the lodge by his family. The lodge kept the gavel at its meeting place until 1922 when it {{was placed in the}} vault of Riggs National Bank, now a branch of PNC Bank, where it remains today. It has occasionally been removed for important Masonic cornerstone ceremonies, including that of the National Cathedral and <b>the</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>Monument.</b>|$|E

5|$|As {{the number}} of {{expected}} participants grew, the rally was moved from the grounds of <b>the</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>Monument</b> to {{the east end of}} the Mall facing the Capitol. The stage was {{on the east side of}} the rally with an open back, allowing the Capitol building to provide the backdrop for the performances. In order to meet the public safety requirements of the National Park Service permit, the Mall between the Capitol and 14th Street was divided into sections, with access aisles lined by portable fences. Speakers and jumbotron television screens were placed along both the north and south edges to encourage the crowd to spread out rather than press against the main stage.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, a {{temporary}} visitor security screening center {{was added to}} the east entrance of <b>the</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>Monument</b> {{in the wake of the}} September 11 attacks. The one-story facility was designed to reduce the ability of a terrorist attack on the interior of the monument, or an attempt to seize and hold it. Visitors obtained their timed-entry tickets from the Monument Lodge east of the memorial, and passed through metal detectors and bomb-sniffing sensors prior to entering the monument. After exiting the monument, they passed through a turnstile to prevent them from re-entering. This facility, a one-story cube of wood around a metal frame, was intended to be temporary until a new screening facility could be designed.|$|E
5|$|The {{hearing was}} held at a {{temporary}} building near <b>the</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>Monument</b> housing offices of the AEC. It began on April 12, 1954, and lasted four weeks.

5000|$|Monuments are {{frequently}} {{used to improve}} {{the appearance of a}} city or location. Planned cities such as Washington D.C., New Delhi and Brasília are often built around <b>monuments.</b> For example, <b>the</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>Monument's</b> location was conceived by L'Enfant to help organize public space in the city, before it was designed or constructed. Older cities have monuments placed at locations that are already important or are sometimes redesigned to focus on one. As Shelley suggested in his famous poem [...] "Ozymandias" [...] ("Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!"), the purpose of monuments is very often to impress or awe.|$|R
500|$|Progress {{toward a}} {{memorial}} finally began in 1833. That year {{a large group}} of concerned citizens formed <b>the</b> <b>Washington</b> National <b>Monument</b> Society.
