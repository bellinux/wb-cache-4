50|$|The {{surgery is}} {{performed}} with the patient under general anesthesia. A kidney can be removed through an open incision or laparoscopically. For <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>procedure,</b> the surgeon makes an incision {{in the side of}} the abdomen to reach the kidney. Depending on circumstances, the incision can also be made midline. The ureter and blood vessels are disconnected, and the kidney is then removed. The laparoscopic approach utilizes three or four small (5-10 mm) cuts in the abdominal and flank area. The kidney is completely detached inside the body and then placed in a bag. One of the incisions is then expanded to remove the kidney for cancer operations. If the kidney is being removed for other causes, it can be morcellated and removed through the small incisions. Recently, this procedure is performed through a single incision in the patient's belly-button. This advanced technique is called single port laparoscopy.|$|E

40|$|A {{prospective}} {{study was conducted}} from March 1999 to April 2000 that included 73 patients who underwent elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy for uncomplicated gallstone disease. The study was conducted at one surgical unit in the Department of Surgery and Department of Radio-diagnosis and one surgical unit in the Department of Surgery, Maulana Azad Medical College and the associated Lok Nayak Hospital, {{which is the largest}} referral hospital in northern India and is located in the capital of India. A preoperative ultrasound was performed just prior to surgery, and 4 ultrasonographic parameters were analyzed, namely gallbladder wall thickness, contracted gallbladder, impaction of gallstones at the neck of the gallbladder, and common bile duct stones. The surgical findings were objectively graded as difficult or easy laparoscopic cholecystectomy according to 5 operative parameters, namely total time taken for the surgery, time taken to dissect gallbladder bed, spillage of stones, tear of gallbladder during dissection, and conversion to <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>procedure.</b> Of the 73 cases, 17 (23. 3 %) were conversions to <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>procedure.</b> Of the 21 (28. 76 %) cases predicted to be difficult, 17 (23. 3 %) were technically difficult, of which 13 (17. 8 %) were converted to <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>procedure.</b> Of the 52 (71. 23 %) cases predicted to be easy on ultrasonography, only 7 (9. 38 %) were found to be difficult on surgery, of which only 4 (5. 48 %) had to be converted to <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>procedure.</b> Based on our results, we conclude that preoperative ultrasonography is of great value in selecting patients preoperatively for laparoscopic cholecystectomy and minimizing complications and conversion to <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>procedure...</b>|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: For the {{surgical}} treatment of gastrooesophageal reflux disease (GORD), laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication has largely replaced <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>procedure.</b> Retrospective and prospective non-randomised {{studies have shown}} similar results after laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication compared with <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>procedure.</b> METHODS: In a multicentre randomised trial candidates for surgical treatment of GORD {{were randomly assigned to}} either laparoscopic or open 360 degrees Nissen fundoplication. Primary endpoints were dysphagia, recurrent GORD, and intrathoracic hernia. Secondary endpoints were effectiveness and quality of life. This planned interim analysis focuses on endpoints and complications and in-hospital costs. FINDINGS: At the time of interim analysis, 11 patients in the laparoscopic group and one in the conventional group had reached a primary endpoint (p= 0. 01; relative risk= 8. 8, 95 % CI 1. 2 - 66. 3).

40|$|Background: Pain in the retrocalcaneal space can be incapacitating. Patients who do {{not respond}} to nonoperative {{treatment}} may seek a surgical solution. The first purpose of this paper was to describe and evaluate the efficacy of a minimally invasive procedure to address retrocalcaneal pain caused by retrocalcaneal bursitis, a Haglund spur, and impingement. The second purpose was to compare the endoscopic technique with a standard open technique. Methods: Our prospective study included thirty-three heels in thirty consecutive patients with chronic pain in the ret-rocalcaneal space for which nonoperative treatment had failed and endoscopic decompression was performed. The mean age was forty-nine years (range, nineteen to seventy-nine years). This group was compared with a group of sev-enteen heels in fourteen patients with the same diagnostic criteria who were treated with an open technique. Both groups of patients were evaluated preoperatively and postoperatively with the AOFAS (American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society) Ankle-Hindfoot Scale, and the patients treated with the endoscopic procedure were also evaluated postoperatively with the University of Maryland 100 -point Painful Foot Center Scoring System. Results: In the endoscopic group, the AOFAS scores averaged 61. 8 points preoperatively and 87. 5 points postopera-tively (p < 0. 001). The endoscopic procedures yielded nineteen excellent, five good, three fair, and three poor results at an average of twenty-two months postoperatively. (Three patients were excluded from the study.) In the open-treat-ment group, the AOFAS scores averaged 58. 1 points preoperatively and 79. 3 points at an average of forty-two months postoperatively (p = 0. 006).

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a theoretical model {{based primarily on}} transaction costs, for comparing the various tendering mechanisms used for transportation Public-Private Partnership (PPP) projects. In particular, the model contrasts negotiated procedures with <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>procedure,</b> {{as defined by the}} current European Union legislation on public tendering. The model includes both ex ante transaction costs (borne during the tendering stage) and ex post transaction costs (such as enforcement costs, re-negotiation costs, and costs arising from litigation between partners), explaining the trade-off between them. Generally speaking, it is assumed that <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>procedure</b> implies lower transaction costs ex ante, while the negotiated procedure reduces the probability of the appearance of new contingencies not foreseen in the contract, hence diminishing the expected value of transaction costs ex post. Therefore, the balance between ex ante and ex post transaction costs is the main criterion for deciding whether the open or negotiated procedure would be optimal. Notwithstanding, empirical evidence currently exists only on ex ante transaction costs in transportation infrastructure projects. This evidence has shown a relevant difference between the two procedures as far as ex ante costs are concerned, favouring <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>procedure.</b> The model developed in this paper also demonstrates that a larger degree of complexity in a contract does not unequivocally favour the use of a negotiated procedure. Only in those cases dealing with very innovative projects, where important dimensions {{of the quality of the}} asset or service are not verifiable, may we observe an advantage in favour of the negotiated procedure. The bottom line is that we find it difficult to justify the employment of negotiated procedures in most transportation PPP contracts, especially in the field of roads. Nevertheless, the field remains open for future empirical work and research on the levels of transaction costs borne ex post in PPP contracts, as well as on the probabilities of such costs appearing under any of the procurement procedures...|$|E

Hypothesis: <b>The</b> <b>open</b> Bankart <b>procedure</b> renders stable and well-functioning shoulders in the long term in a large proportion of patients. Study Design: Retrospective follow-up study with independent reexaminers. Methods: Fifty-four patients (54 shoulders) with symptomatic, posttraumatic, recurrent anterior shoulder instability underwent an <b>open</b> Bankart reconstruction <b>procedure</b> with suture anchors. All of the patients had a Bankart lesion. Forty-seven patients (87 %) were reexamined by independent observers at a mean follow-up period of 69 months (range, 48 to 114). Results: The recurrence rate, including both dislocations and subluxations, was 17 % (8 of 47). The median Rowe score was 90 points (range, 24 to 100) at the follow-up, and the median Constant score was 88. 5 points (range, 41 to 100). External rotation in abduction was a median of 90 ° (range, 25 ° to 125 °) in the involved shoulders, as compared with 97. 5 ° (80 ° to 125 °) in the noninjured shoulders (P 0. 0001).

Methods: A retrospective study comparing the laparoscopic and <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>procedures</b> was performed in 77 consecutive patients with choledochal cyst in our hospital. Thirty-nine patients operated on between June 2001 and September 2003 were in the laparoscopic group, whereas 38 patients in <b>the</b> <b>open</b> group were operated on between February 1999 and May 2001. Results: Patient demographics were similar between the 2 groups. The duration of operation was significantly longer in the laparoscopic group than in <b>the</b> <b>open</b> group (median, 230 vs 190 minutes; P<<. 001). In contrast, the durations of delayed oral feeding and hospital stay postoperatively were significantly shorter in the laparoscopic group (median, 4 vs 5 days [P <. 01] and median, 5 vs 7 days [P <. 01], respectively.) There were no differences in the early and late complication rates between the 2 groups. Conclusions: Laparoscopic treatment of choledochal cyst in children is feasible and safe.

Open cholecystectomy done in 292 (19. 6 %) mostly in patients with contra-indications for laparoscopy, 1194 (80. 4 %) initiated laparoscopically, 1086 [91 %] completed laparoscopically and 108 (9 %) converted to open procedure.

40|$|Laparoscopic {{cholecystectomy}} {{continues to}} attract controversy {{with regard to}} a perceived higher incidence of bile duct injury than in <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>procedure.</b> One possible cause {{for this is the}} trend away from intraoperative cholangiography previously considered an essential part of <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>procedure.</b> Under the auspices of The Association of Surgeons of Great Britain and Ireland, a questionnaire was sent to all its consultant fellows asking for details about their individual experience of the most serious injury, bile duct resection. In all, 1100 questionnaires were sent; 362 (33 %) replies were returned. Of those who replied, 300 performed laparoscopic cholecystectomy as part of their practice. The experience of the respondents was divided into three groups; 19 surgeons had performed < 50 laparoscopic cholecystectomies, 53 between 50 and 100 and 228 had performed over 100. Ninety-five (32 %) never performed intraoperative cholangiography, 167 (56 %) on a selective basis and 38 (12 %) routinely. In all, 58 bile duct resection injuries were reported by 48 surgeons. Of the bile duct resection injuries reported, 49 of 58 (85 %) occurred when an intraoperative cholangiogram was not performed. These figures suggest that if the incidence of bile duct resection injury is to be decreased in laparoscopic cholecystectomy, the use of intraoperative cholangiography has an integral role to play...|$|E
