Other Na+-dependent transporters, like system ASC (MeAIB-insensitive Na+-dependent l-alanine transport) and the nucleoside carrier show similar inductions. Up-regulation of system A is not explained {{by changes in}} the dissipation rate of the Na+ <b>transmembrane</b> <b>gradient,</b> as deduced from uptake measurements performed {{in the presence of}} monensin. To determine whether induced system A shared any similarity with the activity found in hepatoma cell lines, we analyzed the N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) sensitivity of system A in both regenerating and control rat liver plasma membrane vesicles. NEM treatment was equally effective in inhibiting system A in both experimental groups. Thus, during the prereplicative phase of liver growth, a transport activity similar to basal system A is up-regulated in liver parenchymal cells, by a stable mechanism that does not involve changes in the Na+ <b>transmembrane</b> <b>gradient...</b>|$|E

Variety of physiological and pathophysiological implications of skeletal muscle myokines secretion has been described; however, upstream signals and sensing mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain poorly understood. It is well documented that in skeletal muscles intensive exercise triggers dissipation of <b>transmembrane</b> <b>gradient</b> of monovalent cations caused by permanent activation of voltage-gated Na+ and K+ channels. Recently, we demonstrated that sustained elevation of the [Na+]i/[K+]i ratio triggers expression of dozens ubiquitous genes including several canonical myokines, such as interleukin- 6 and cyclooxygenase 2, in the presence of intra- and extracellular Ca 2 + chelators. These data allowed us to suggest a novel [Na+]i/[K+]i-sensitive, Ca 2 +i-independent mechanism of excitation-transcription coupling which triggers myokine production. This pathway exists in parallel with canonical signaling mediated by Ca 2 +i, AMP-activated protein kinase and hypoxia-inducible factor 1 α (HIF- 1 α).

40|$|Abstract Background At {{least some}} {{clinical}} data suggests that, {{regardless of which}} major coronary artery is narrowed, the early ST segment body surface pattern {{is characterized by a}} minimum near precordial lead V 5 and a broad area of left precordial negative potentials. Some clinical data also suggests that late ST segment potentials can localize an ischemic heart region. Objective A computer model of a heart/torso system was implemented to study the relationship between transmembrane potentials throughout the heart and clinically observed body surface potential patterns during the early and late ST segments in ischemic patients. Methods Transmembrane potentials were selected to produce body surface potentials that matched the clinical data. Results The early ST segment pattern was matched by assigning: (i) an epicardial <b>transmembrane</b> potential <b>gradient</b> that is consistent with the normal activation/repolarization sequence, according to which the left lateral epicardium activates relatively late; (ii) an endocardial transmembrane potential distribution with the lowest transmembrane potentials in the ischemic region; and (iii) overall lower transmembrane potentials to the endocardium compared to the epicardium. Late ST segment potentials, which localized the area of the ischemic region, were generated by reducing the epicardial <b>transmembrane</b> potential <b>gradient</b> and increasing the endocardial <b>transmembrane</b> potential <b>gradient.</b> Conclusion The non-localizing nature of early ST segment depression could be due to global epicardial and endocardial <b>transmembrane</b> potential <b>gradients</b> related to the activation/repolarization sequence, whereas the possibly localizing nature of late ST segment depression could be due to the relative removal of the epicardial gradient, and an increase of the <b>transmembrane</b> potential <b>gradient</b> across the endocardium. </p...|$|R

In the recycling fermentor the calculated Δp values were independent of the specific growth rate and of the growth phase with both relaxed mutants. Δp values measured in the chemostat at different specific growth rates yielded the same result. Results with a wild-type E. coli that expresses the stringent response at specific growth rates lower than 0. 01 h−, corresponding to generation times greater than 70 h, showed that Δp varies inversely with specific growth rate.

40|$|The {{anaerobic}} bacterium Fusobacterium nucleatum uses glutamate decarboxylation {{to generate}} a <b>transmembrane</b> <b>gradient</b> of Na+. Here, we demonstrate that this ion-motive force is directly coupled to ATP synthesis, via an F 1 Fo-ATP synthase with a novel Na+ recognition motif, shared by other human pathogens. Molecular modeling and free-energy simulations of the rotary element of the enzyme, the c-ring, indicate Na+ specificity in physiological settings. Consistently, activity measurements showed Na+ stimulation of the enzyme, either membrane-embedded or isolated, and ATP synthesis was sensitive to the Na+ ionophore monensin. Furthermore, Na+ has a protective effect against inhibitors targeting the ion-binding sites, both in the complete ATP synthase and the isolated c-ring. Definitive evidence of Na+ coupling is provided by two identical crystal structures of the c 11 ring, solved by X-ray crystallography at 2. 2 and 2. 6 A ̊ resolution, at pH 5. 3 and 8. 7, respectively. Na+ ions occupy all binding sites, each coordinated by four amino acids and a water molecule. Intriguingly, two carboxylates instead of one mediate ion binding. Simulations and experiments demonstrate that this motif implies that a proton is concurrently bound to all sites, although Na+ alone drives the rotary mechanism.

The way of insertion of this small protein (32 amino acids) into membranes is still unknown. Here we show that the protein is able to insert in monolayers. The limiting surface pressure of 35 mN/m for 1, 2 -dioleoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine and 1, 2 -dioleoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphoglycerol lipid systems indicates that this spontaneous insertion can also occur in vivo. By carboxyfluorescein leakage experiments of vesicles it is demonstrated that protein monomers, or at least small aggregates, are more effective in releasing carboxyfluorescein than highly aggregated protein. The final orientation of the protein in the bilayer after insertion was addressed by proteinase K digestion, thereby making use of the unique C-terminal location of the antigenic binding site. After insertion the C-terminus is still available for the enzymatic digestion, while the N-terminus is not. This leads to the overall conclusion that the protein is able to insert spontaneously into membranes without the need of any machinery or <b>transmembrane</b> <b>gradient,</b> with the positively charged C-terminus remaining on the outside.

The mitochondria-penetrating peptide crossed to the inner leaflet of the model membranes without disrupting the lamellarity.

L-[3 H]proline uptake was stimulated by a <b>transmembrane</b> NaCl <b>gradient</b> [outside (o) greater than inside (i) ] {{to a greater}} extent in BBMV from labyrinth than those from the bladder. Detailed study of the labyrinth proline-transport processes revealed a specific dependence on NaCl, with negligible stimulatory effects by NaSCN, Na-gluconate, or KCl. A <b>transmembrane</b> proton <b>gradient</b> (o greater than i) was without stimulatory effect on proline transport. A transmembrane potential difference alone, in the presence of equilibrated NaCl and L-[3 H]proline, led to net influx of the labeled amino acid, suggesting that the uptake process was electrogenic and capable of bringing about the net transfer of positive charge to the vesicle interior. Although a <b>transmembrane</b> Na <b>gradient</b> alone, in the presence of equilibrated Cl and L-[3 H]proline, was able to bring about the net influx of the amino acid, a <b>transmembrane</b> Cl <b>gradient</b> alone under Na- and L-[3 H]proline-equilibrated conditions was not, suggesting that only the Na gradient could energize the carrier process through cotransport, while the anion served an essential activating role.

Based on the intrinsic fluorescence of tyrosine or tryptophan residues, the partition of NrTPs and crotamine to membranes with variable lipid compositions was studied. Partition coefficient values (in the 102 – 105 range) followed essentially the compositional trend POPC:POPG≤POPG<POPC≤POPC:cholesterol. Leakage assays showed that NrTPs induce minimal lipid vesicle disruption. Fluorescence quenching of NrTPs, either by acrylamide or lipophilic probes, revealed that NrTPs are buried in the lipid bilayer only for negatively-charged membranes. Adoption of partial secondary structure by the NrTPs upon interaction with POPC and POPG vesicles was demonstrated by circular dichroism. Translocation studies were conducted using a novel methodology, based on the confocal microscopy imaging of giant multilamellar vesicles or giant multivesicular liposomes.

Na,K-ATPase has {{an important role in}} synaptic transmission and memory formation. Accumulation of beta-amyloid (Aβ) at the early stages of Alzheimer's disease is accompanied by reduction of Na,K-ATPase functional activity. The molecular mechanism behind this phenomenon is not known. Here we show that the monomeric Aβ(1 - 42) forms a tight (Kd of 3 [*]μM), enthalpy-driven equimolar complex with α 1 β 1 Na,K-ATPase. The complex formation results in dose-dependent inhibition of the enzyme hydrolytic activity. The binding site of Aβ(1 - 42) is localized in the "gap" between the alpha- and beta-subunits of Na,K-ATPase, disrupting the enzyme functionality by preventing the subunits from shifting towards each other. Interaction of Na,K-ATPase with exogenous Aβ(1 - 42) leads to a pronounced decrease of the enzyme transport and hydrolytic activity and Src-kinase activation in neuroblastoma cells SH-SY 5 Y. This interaction allows regulation of Na,K-ATPase activity by short-term increase of the Aβ(1 - 42) level. However prolonged increase of Aβ(1 - 42) level under pathological conditions could lead to chronical inhibition of Na,K-ATPase and disruption of neuronal function.

40|$|The {{bacterial}} flagellar motor (BFM) {{is responsible}} for driving bacterial locomotion and chemotaxis, fundamental processes in pathogenesis and biofilm formation. In the BFM, torque is generated at the interface between transmembrane proteins (stators) and a rotor. It is well-established that the passage of ions down a <b>transmembrane</b> <b>gradient</b> through the stator complex provides the energy needed for torque generation. However, the physics involved in this energy conversion remain poorly understood. Here we propose a mechanically specific model for torque generation in the BFM. In particular, we identify two fundamental forces involved in torque generation: electrostatic and steric. We propose that electrostatic forces serve to position the stator, while steric forces comprise the actual 'power stroke'. Specifically, we predict that ion-induced conformational changes about a proline 'hinge' residue in an α-helix of the stator are directly responsible for generating the power stroke. Our model predictions fit well with recent experiments on a single-stator motor. Furthermore, we propose several experiments to elucidate the torque-speed relationship in motors where the number of stators may not be constant.

No differences could be observed in intracellular ATP levels, {{the presence or absence}} of a <b>transmembrane</b> pH <b>gradient,</b> or the levels of phosphorylated glycolytic intermediates when resistant cells were studied by 31 P NMR in {{the presence or absence of}} tellurite. In the sensitive strain, we observed that the <b>transmembrane</b> pH <b>gradient</b> was dissipated and intracellular ATP levels were rapidly depleted upon exposure to tellurite. Only the level of phosphorylated glycolytic intermediates remained the same as observed with resistant cells. Upon exposure to selenite, no differences could be observed by 31 P NMR between resistant and sensitive strains, suggesting that the routes for selenite and tellurite reduction within the cells differ significantly, since only tellurite is able to collapse the <b>transmembrane</b> pH <b>gradient</b> and lower ATP levels in sensitive cells. The presence of the resistance determinant tehAB, by an as yet unidentified detoxification event, protects the cells from uncoupling by tellurite...|$|R
40|$|<b>Transmembrane</b> osmotic <b>gradients</b> applied {{on large}} unilamellar 1 -palmitoyl- 2 -oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine vesicles {{were used to}} {{modulate}} the potency of melittin to induce leakage. Melittin, an amphipathic peptide, changes the permeability of vesicles, as studied using the release of entrapped calcein, a fluorescent marker. A promotion of the ability of melittin to induce leakage was observed when a hyposomotic gradient (i. e., internal salt concentration higher than the external one) was imposed on the vesicles. It is proposed that structural perturbations caused by the osmotic pressure loosen the compactness of the outer leaflet, which facilitates the melittin-induced change in membrane permeability. Additionally, we have shown that this phenomenon is not due to enhanced binding of melittin to the vesicles using intrinsic fluorescence of the melittin tryptophan. Furthermore, we investigated {{the possibility of using}} a <b>transmembrane</b> pH <b>gradient</b> to control the lytic activity of melittin. The potency of melittin in inducing release is known to be inhibited by increased negative surface charge density. A <b>transmembrane</b> pH <b>gradient</b> causing an asymmetric distribution of unprotonated palmitic acid in the bilayer is shown to be an efficient way to modulate the lytic activity of melittin, without changing the overall lipid composition of the membrane. We demonstrate that the protective effect of negatively charged lipids is preserved for asymmetric membranes...|$|R
