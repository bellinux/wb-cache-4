Rejath R.G of Kerala Kaumudi said, [...] "Renjith has beautifully conceived the film", and praised {{the technical aspects}} with special mention to Kunjunni's camera work and the three [...] "beautiful" [...] songs composed by Sreevalsan. He summarised it as [...] "a watchable good film {{that could have been}} much better if the director paid a little more attention to the screenplay. <b>The</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> loses steam here and there particularly in the post-interval sequences". Deccan Chronicle rated the film 2.5 out of 5 and said, [...] "Any of [...] fans, who are exposed to thrillers of Hollywood and Bollywood like Ocean's 11 and Special 26 will lose the thrill soon. There is nothing commendable about the script or cinematography or music", but he praised Mohanlal's action sequences and car chasing scenes, Siddique and his companion's performances, and Mythili and Musthafa's [...] "heart touching" [...] moments. He called the message of the film [...] "socially relevant" [...] and [...] "effective". Akhila Menon of Filmibeat also gave the film 2.5 out of 5 stars. He praised the performances of Mohanlal and Siddique, but was less enthusiastic about the script, observing that [...] "Ranjith's craft as a filmmaker is visible throughout the movie. But what Loham lacks is his brilliance as a writer".|$|E

30|$|When to {{exercise}} a real option is a strategic decision. If the option is non-dedicated, {{the firm and}} its competitors hold an option on the identical asset, and whoever exercises first may get the fundamental asset. <b>The</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> provided uncertainty stays on the market or technology, no one can <b>be</b> certain <b>that</b> they want <b>the</b> asset. <b>The</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> naturally <b>that</b> no firm knows what condition the game will be in at future times.
