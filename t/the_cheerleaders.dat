The family watches from the stand and sees Ned Flanders and his family, who claims to enjoy the high levels of safety the drivers use. Later, a squad of cheerleaders fires free T-shirts from air cannons into the crowd, and Homer rudely demands one. Irritated, Maude leaves to buy hot dogs. <b>The</b> <b>cheerleaders</b> send a full salvo of T-shirts in Homer's direction, but he bends down at the last second to pick up a bobby pin on the ground. Maude returns at that exact moment, gets hit by the T-shirts and falls {{over the edge of the}} bleachers to her death on the parking lot.|$|E
5|$|Sue informs Will {{that the}} club {{receiving}} {{payment for the}} commercial revokes their amateur status, and thus their eligibility to compete at sectionals. Quinn, who {{has been trying to}} convince Sue to let her appear in the cheerleaders' photographs despite being removed from the team due to her pregnancy, reminds Sue that as their coach she has often given <b>the</b> <b>cheerleaders</b> perks which would also render them ineligible for competition. She demands that Sue sacrifice one of the cheerleaders' six pages in the yearbook to the glee club. Sue agrees, and accepts Quinn back onto the cheerleading team, but Quinn tells her she no longer wishes to be a cheerleader. Will announces that he will not be accompanying the club to sectionals, as {{he was the one who}} accepted payment, and as such they will only be allowed to compete without his involvement. The glee club then has their group photograph taken for the yearbook, but the copy in the library is subsequently defaced by hockey player Dave Karofsky (Max Adler) and football player Azimio (James Earl).|$|E

25|$|Marching bands {{serve as}} {{entertainment}} during American football games, {{may also be}} known as pep band. For college and high school marching bands, this is {{the primary purpose of}} the ensemble. The home team's band plays the national anthem before kickoff (often as part of a pre-game show), as well as other music while in the stands during the game. Bands cheer with <b>the</b> <b>cheerleaders,</b> and some bands create their own cheers. Marching bands then perform a show during halftime. When both teams' bands are present, it is common protocol for the visiting band to perform first. After halftime, some high school bands use the third quarter of the game to take a break and get food. College bands and some high school bands do not have such breaks, but continue playing in the stands during the entirety of the game. The band often stay the entire game, playing the school's fight song and alma mater at the end of the game regardless of the outcome.|$|E

Although Stanley is heavily critical of most of the group, Rachel convinces the members that their differences give them a unique edge, and fires the choreographer. <b>The</b> <b>cheerleaders</b> also lead Mercedes Jones (Amber Riley) to believe that fellow club member Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer) has feelings for her, leaving her hurt when he rejects her advances.

As Will is about to kiss her, Sue backs out and decides she prefers that the trophy be set up in the choir room as a reminder of her superiority.|$|E
500|$|Antonia Coffman, a {{spokeswoman}} for The Simpsons, told The Charlotte Observer that [...] "the Lowe's incident didn't inspire the scene" [...] and that the episode {{was not meant to}} offend anyone. After WCCB had gotten the opportunity to actually see the episode they decided that they would air it, realizing that the original commercial was misleading and that they did not think the episode was making fun of the incident. In the episode, the viewers can see that Lenny tries {{to get the attention of}} <b>the</b> <b>cheerleaders</b> by raising his hand so that they aim a T-shirt with the cannon at him. However, he is hit by a car tire instead. Unlike what the commercial implied, Lenny is not killed and is soon back in his seat. WCCB told the Associated Press that their interpretation of the scene was that someone threw the tire to Lenny because he was raising his hand, and that the tire did not actually come from a car crash on the track. Despite this, the affiliate announced that they would start the broadcast of the episode with a message warning viewers of the scene anyway.|$|E
500|$|Lester's fantasies are {{emphasized}} by slow- and repetitive-motion shots; Mendes uses double-and-triple cutbacks in several sequences, and the score alters {{to make the}} audience aware that it is entering a fantasy. One example is the gymnasium scene—Lester's first encounter with Angela. While <b>the</b> <b>cheerleaders</b> perform their half-time routine to [...] "On Broadway", Lester becomes increasingly fixated on Angela. Time slows to represent his [...] "voyeuristic hypnosis" [...] and Lester begins to fantasize that Angela's performance is for him alone. [...] "On Broadway"—which provides a conventional underscore to the onscreen action—is replaced by discordant, percussive music that lacks melody or progression. This nondiegetic score is important to creating the narrative stasis in the sequence; it conveys a moment for Lester that is stretched to an indeterminate length. The effect is one that Stan Link likens to [...] "vertical time", described by the composer and music theorist Jonathan Kramer as music that imparts [...] "a single present stretched out into an enormous duration, a potentially infinite 'now' that nonetheless feels like an instant". The music is used like a visual cue, so that Lester and the score are staring at Angela. The sequence ends with the sudden reintroduction of [...] "On Broadway" [...] and teleological time.|$|E

500|$|The music video, {{directed}} by Yankovic's manager Jay Levey, is a near shot-for-shot {{parody of the}} original video for [...] "Smells Like Teen Spirit", which depicts the band playing {{at a high school}} concert while it descends into riot. Yankovic is present on guitar and vocals as Kurt Cobain, with Steve Jay on bass as Krist Novoselic, and Jon [...] "Bermuda" [...] Schwartz on drums as Dave Grohl. All three wear clothing and long-haired wigs to imitate the look of Nirvana in [...] "Smells Like Teen Spirit". Yankovic's video uses many of the same props, actors and camera angles; in particular, the video was shot in the same Culver City, California sound stage as Nirvana's video, several of <b>the</b> <b>cheerleaders</b> and audience members were from the original video, and Tony De La Rosa reprises his role as the janitor. Levey stated {{that they were able to}} recreate much of the same setting with help of the producers of the original Nirvana video once they were aware that the song had Cobain's blessing. Yankovic had a brief conversation with Samuel Bayer, the original director of [...] "Smells Like Teen Spirit" [...] in preparation for the video shoot. Although Yankovic noted that [...] "he was certainly going along with it", he felt that Bayer was [...] "the least enthused" [...] because [...] "he was a true artiste" [...] and was reluctant to see his work parodied.|$|E
500|$|Murphy {{initially}} {{intended the}} episode {{to be the}} second of the season paying tribute to a single band or artist, following the Britney Spears tribute episode [...] "Britney/Brittany", and considered covering songs by Elton John, Prince, The Beatles, Bruce Springsteen or Michael Jackson. Although several artists agreed to a tribute, ultimately it was decided that songs by multiple acts would be covered. Katy Perry's [...] "California Gurls" [...] was used as the opening number, performed as a dance routine by the school cheerleading squad, the Cheerios. Paying homage to Perry's original music video, one element features <b>the</b> <b>cheerleaders</b> appearing to shoot fire from their breasts. Falchuk, the episode's director, stated that the sequence was included to attract male Super Bowl viewers who would not ordinarily watch Glee. Rachel and Puck perform a duet of Lady Antebellum's [...] "Need You Now", intended to showcase the merits of glee club. Finn leads a performance of The Zombies' [...] "She's Not There" [...] as the halftime show warm-up number, and rival a cappella choir the Dalton Academy Warblers perform Destiny's Child's [...] "Bills, Bills, Bills", led by Blaine. A mash-up of Jackson's song [...] "Thriller" [...] with [...] "Heads Will Roll" [...] by the Yeah Yeah Yeahs was used as the final number. In early reports relating to the episode, Lynch claimed that Couric and Morrison would perform a dance number to [...] "Tea for Two", Vincent Youmans and Irving Caesar's song from the 1925 musical No, No, Nanette. This rumor was later dispelled by Murphy.|$|E
500|$|After {{their mother}} Paula (Maeve Quinlan) {{takes on a}} new job, the Carlin family moves {{from a small town}} in Ohio to Los Angeles, California. The three Carlin {{siblings}} start at King High School, where they each try to fit in. Glen (Chris Hunter), a talented basketball player, tries out for the school basketball team, upsetting the star player Aiden Dennison (Matt Cohen) and his cheerleader girlfriend Madison Duarte (Valery Ortiz). Tensions between Glen and Aiden escalate into a locker room fight over Aiden's ex-girlfriend Ashley Davies (Mandy Musgrave), and Glen takes the spotlight in his first game, leaving Aiden on the bench. Glen's sister Spencer (Gabrielle Christian) joins the cheerleading squad but ends up doing little more than take orders from Madison. She befriends the rebellious Ashley, but when Ashley indicates her interest in girls, Spencer starts to avoid her, only to admit later that she enjoyed their time spent together. That night, though, she dreams of being taunted by <b>the</b> <b>cheerleaders</b> and called gay, although she denies it. Glen and Spencer's adopted African American brother Clay (Danso Gordon) is smart but naïve, and he finds himself facing the racial tensions of LA that he never experienced in Ohio. After Clay strikes up a conversation with a girl named Chelsea Lewis (Aasha Davis), he is beaten up by her ex-boyfriend Dallas (Marcus Brown) when Clay tries to defend her. He then earns the respect of Sean Miller (Austen Parros), who is cynical about the way African Americans are treated in society, and when they go driving they are pulled over by the police for [...] "driving while black".|$|E
