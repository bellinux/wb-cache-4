5|$|Other {{scientists}} {{working for}} Davros, now {{aware of his}} plans, free the Doctor and give him enough time to rig the Dalek incubation room with explosives which would end {{the threat of the}} Daleks. As he is about to touch the two exposed wire ends to set them off, the Doctor questions if he has the right <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>that</b> <b>decision</b> and forgoes setting the explosions off. Just then, he learns that Davros has agreed to stop and allow the Kaled leaders to vote on the continuation of the project. As the leaders gather for this vote, the Doctor is able to recover the Time Ring and destroy the recordings he made, while learning that the Thals and Mutos have prepared the means to destroy the bunker. As the vote is called, Davros reveals this was all a decoy, giving the Daleks he sent to the Thal time to return to the bunker and exterminate the remaining Kaleds. Harry and Sarah escape the chaos, while the Doctor returns to set off the incubator room's explosives, but a Dalek inadvertently completes the circuit and sets it off itself. The Doctor escapes in time before the Thal and Mutos' bomb caves in the bunker, trapping Davros and the Daleks. Inside, Davros realises the Daleks have gained a will of their own, and attempts to stop the production line, but a Dalek incapacitates him.|$|E
25|$|Administrative law is {{the area}} of law {{concerning}} the control of powers exercised by the government. It functions to regulate decision-making processes by public authorities with regard to maintaining basic standards of fairness and legality. Administrative law in Singapore originates from and shares many similarities with administrative law in the United Kingdom. In general, claims for judicial review in administrative law fall under three broad categories– illegality, irrationality and procedural impropriety. Instances of illegality fall under two main headings: whether the authority was empowered {{to make the decision}} in question, and whether it properly exercised its discretion <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>that</b> <b>decision.</b> Grounds for illegality under the first heading include simple ultra vires, and errors as to precedent facts. The second heading includes grounds of judicial review such as making decisions on the basis of insufficient evidence or errors of material fact, failing to take into account relevant considerations and taking into account irrelevant ones, making decisions for improper purposes, fettering of discretion, and failing to fulfil legitimate expectations.|$|E

I think they are a good thing, but I think the parent should have some input. The state doesn't own your children. Parents own the children, {{and it is an}} issue of freedom."

At that time (before the NBA Draft Lottery was {{introduced}} in 1985), the first pick was awarded by coin flip. Olajuwon recalled: [...] "I really believed that Houston {{was going to win}} the coin flip and pick the number 1 draft choice, and I really wanted to play in Houston so I had <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>that</b> <b>decision</b> (to leave early)." [...] His intuition proved correct, and a lucky toss placed Houston ahead of the Portland Trail Blazers. Olajuwon was considered the top amateur prospect in the summer of 1984 over fellow collegians and future NBA stars Michael Jordan, Charles Barkley, and John Stockton, and was selected first overall by the Rockets in the 1984 NBA draft.|$|E

500|$|... "The Master Plan" [...] {{marked the}} first {{appearance}} of Adam Scott, who also appeared in the subsequent season finale [...] "Freddy Spaghetti" [...] and became a regular cast member during the third season. Scott left the Starz comedy Party Down to join the Parks and Recreation cast, a decision he made {{in part because it}} was unclear whether Starz would renew the series: [...] "It was a matter of me asking Starz {{if it was going to}} continue, and them saying they weren't ready <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>that</b> <b>decision.</b> I couldn't pass up the opportunity on Parks and Rec for a show that could possibly not exist anymore." [...] Schur said when the Ben Wyatt character was written, Scott was envisioned as the [...] "dream scenario" [...] for casting. Schur described Scott as [...] "brilliant and funny" [...] and praised his comedic range: [...] "There just aren't that many people with a comedic range that spans Step Brothers to Party Down.". Several commentators said Ben Wyatt closely resembles the character Scott played on Party Down, Henry Pollard. While Ben was a politician who found great success at a young age then suffered a downfall, Henry was an actor who became a caterer after his acting career declined. Scott, however, said he feels they are [...] "vastly different characters and circumstances". The idea of a character trying to rebuild a government career following a humiliating public failure was one of the original ideas for the series of Parks and Recreation in general, but one that was ultimately not used until the Ben Wyatt character was introduced. During the scene when Ben explains his failed mayoral tenure, shots of a newspaper clip with images of the character's prom pictures are shown. Those pictures are the actual high school prom photos of actor Adam Scott.|$|E

40|$|I tested {{predictions}} about foraging decisions and stopover durations {{based on a}} mortality-minimizing migratory model in two shorebird species on southward migration. Semipalmated and adult western sandpipers migrate early, under low predation danger and are predicted <b>to</b> <b>make</b> behavioural <b>decisions</b> <b>that</b> allow them to avoid exposure to the seasonal increase in abundance of their main predator, peregrine falcons. Juvenile western sandpipers migrate later, experiencing higher predation danger. They are predicted <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>decisions</b> <b>that</b> reduce vulnerability <b>to</b> falcons. Early migrants seasonally lowered vigilance and adjusted stopover duration, increasing migratory speed to remain ahead of the approaching migratory falcons. Late migrants had higher vigilance, and stopover duration trends fitting reduced vulnerability {{at the expense of}} migratory speed. Flight initiation distance and spatial usage were not consistent with predictions. These species appear <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>decisions</b> <b>that</b> depend on spatial and temporal proximity to predator migrations, as predicted by a mortality-minimizing migration model...|$|R

2500|$|After {{receiving}} the proposal, the General Assembly enacted House Bill 3202 introduced by State Delegate William J. Howell, which allowed {{the region to}} enact tolling on the project by creating the Hampton Roads Transportation Authority, as well as authorizing tax increases requested by the MPO to finance the other major projects in the region's plan, including the controversial civil remedial fees, {{a plan that would}} have allowed the HRTA to raise nearly $169 million in taxes in its first year. However, the authority's taxing authority was short-lived. On February 28, 2008, the State Supreme Court ruled in Marshall v. Northern Virginia Transportation Authority [...] that the taxation authority granted to these non-elected bodies violated the Constitution of Virginia: The General Assembly also may not accomplish through Chapter 896 , indirectly, that which it is not empowered to do directly, namely, impose taxes on the citizenry {{in the absence of an}} affirmative, recorded vote of a majority of all members elected to each body of the General Assembly. Thus, by enacting Chapter 896 , the General Assembly has failed to adhere to the mandates of accountability and transparency that the Constitution requires when the General Assembly exercises the legislative taxing authority permitted by the Constitution. If payment of the regional taxes and fees is to be required by a general law, it is the prerogative and the function of the General Assembly, as provided by Article IV, Section 1 of the Constitution, <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>that</b> <b>decision,</b> in a manner which complies with the requirements of Article IV, Section 11 of the Constitution. The opinion did not find the existence of the HRTA (or the NVTA for that matter) to be unconstitutional, nor did it strike the authority of the regional authorities to impose tolling on the roadways.|$|E

6000|$|The {{sound of}} wheels died away, but Soames still stood intent; then, {{suddenly}} covering his ears, {{he walked back}} to the river. To come before its time like this, with no chance to foresee anything, not even to get her mother here! It was for her mother <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>that</b> <b>decision,</b> and she couldn't arrive from Paris till to-night! If only he could have understood the doctor's jargon, the medical niceties, so as to be sure he was weighing the chances properly; but they were Greek to him--like a legal problem to a layman. And yet he must decide! He brought his hand away from his brow wet, though the air was chilly. These sounds which came from her room! To go back there would only make it more difficult. He must be calm, clear. On the one hand life, nearly certain, of his young wife, death quite certain, of his child; and--no more children afterwards! On the other, death perhaps of his wife, nearly certain life for the child; and--no more children afterwards! Which to choose?.... It had rained this last fortnight--the river was very full, and in the water, collected round the little house-boat moored by his landing-stage, were many leaves from the woods above, brought off by a frost. Leaves fell, lives drifted down--Death! To decide about death! And no one to give him a hand. Life lost was lost for good. Let nothing go that you could keep; for, if it went, you couldn't get it back. It left you bare, like those trees when they lost their leaves; barer and barer until you, too, withered and came down. And, by a queer somersault of thought, he seemed to see not Annette lying up there behind that window-pane on which the sun was shining, but Irene lying in their bedroom in Montpellier Square, as it might conceivably have been her fate to lie, sixteen years ago. Would he have hesitated then? Not a moment! Operate, operate! Make certain of her life! No decision--a mere instinctive cry for help, in spite of his knowledge, even then, that she did not love him! But this! Ah! there was nothing overmastering in his feeling for Annette! Many times these last months, especially since she had been growing frightened, he had wondered. She had a will of her own, was selfish in her French way. And yet--so pretty! What would she wish--to take the risk. 'I know she wants the child,' he thought. 'If it's born dead, and no more chance afterwards--it'll upset her terribly. No more chance! All for nothing! Married life with her for years and years without a child. Nothing to steady her! She's too young. Nothing to look forward to, for her--for me! For me!' He struck his hands against his chest! Why couldn't he think without bringing himself in--get out of himself and see what he ought to do? The thought hurt him, then lost edge, as if it had come in contact with a breastplate. Out of oneself! Impossible! Out into soundless, scentless, touchless, sightless space! The very idea was ghastly, futile! And touching there the bedrock of reality, the bottom of his Forsyte spirit, Soames rested for a moment. When one ceased, all ceased; it might go on, but there'd be nothing in it! ...|$|E
