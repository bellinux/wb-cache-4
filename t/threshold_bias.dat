40|$|We study biased Maker-Breaker {{positional}} games {{between two}} players, {{one of whom}} is playing randomly against an opponent with an optimal strategy. In this paper we consider the scenario when Maker plays randomly and Breaker is "clever", and determine the sharp <b>threshold</b> <b>bias</b> of classical graph games, such as connectivity, Hamiltonicity, and minimum degree-$k$. We treat the other case, that is when Breaker plays randomly, in a separate paper. The traditional, deterministic version of these games, with two optimal players playing, are known to obey the so-called probabilistic intuition. That is, the <b>threshold</b> <b>bias</b> of these games is asymptotically equal to the <b>threshold</b> <b>bias</b> of their random counterpart, where players just take edges uniformly at random. We find, that despite this remarkably precise agreement {{of the results of the}} deterministic and the random games, playing randomly against an optimal opponent is not a good idea: the <b>threshold</b> <b>bias</b> becomes significantly more tilted towards the random player. An important qualitative aspect of the probabilistic intuition carries through nevertheless: the bottleneck for Maker to occupy a connected graph is still the ability to avoid isolated vertices in her graph.

40|$|A {{single mode}} {{electromagnetic}} resonator coupled to a two-level hybrid-quantum-dot(hQD) is studied theoretically as a laser(maser), when the hQD is {{driven out of}} equilibrium with external applied d. c. bias voltage. Using the formalism of the non-equilibrium Green's functions for the hQD and the semi-classical laser equations, we determine the relevant physical quantities of the system. We find that due to the resonant Andreev reflections {{and the formation of}} the Floquet-Andreev side-resonances in the sub-gap region, at appropriate gate voltages and above a certain <b>threshold</b> <b>bias</b> voltage and damping factor of the resonator, the two-level QD has non-zero gain spectrum and lasing can happen in the system in the frequency range of superconducting gap. Furthermore, our results show that depending on the damping factor of the resonator and above a specific <b>threshold</b> <b>bias</b> voltages, the lasing can be either due to single electron transitions or cascaded electron transitions between the Andreev resonances and Floquet-Andreev side-resonances.

40|$|Background: Comparative and {{predictive}} {{analyses of}} suicide data from different countries {{are difficult to}} perform due to varying approaches {{and the lack of}} comparative parameters. Methodology/Principal Findings: A simple model (the <b>Threshold</b> <b>Bias</b> Model) was tested for comparative and predictive analyses of suicide rates by age. The model comprises of a six parameter distribution that was applied to the USA suicide rates by age for the years 2001 and 2002. Posteriorly, linear extrapolations are performed of the parameter values previously obtained for these years in order to estimate the values corresponding to the year 2003. The calculated distributions agreed reasonably well with the aggregate data. The model was also used to determine the age above which suicide rates become statistically observable in USA, Brazil and Sri Lanka. Conclusions/Significance: The <b>Threshold</b> <b>Bias</b> Model has considerable potential applications in demographic studies of suicide. Moreover, since the model can be used to predict the evolution of suicide rates based on information extracted from past data, it will be of great interest to suicidologists and other researchers in the field of mental health...|$|E

40|$|<b>Threshold</b> <b>biasing</b> of a Gaussian random field gives {{a linear}} {{amplification}} of the reduced two point correlation function at large distances. We show that for standard cosmological models {{this does not}} translate into a linear amplification of the power spectrum (PS) at small k. For standard CDM type models {{this means that the}} "turn-over" at small k of the original PS disappears in the PS of the biased field for the physically relevant range of the threshold parameter ν. In real space this difference is manifest in the asymptotic behaviour of the normalised mass variance in spheres of radius R, which changes from the "super-homogeneous" behaviour σ^ 2 (R) ∼ R^- 4 to a Poisson-like behaviour σ^ 2 _ν(R) ∼ R^- 3. This qualitative change results from the intrinsic stochasticity of the threshold sampling. While our quantitative results are specific to the simplest <b>threshold</b> <b>biasing</b> model, we argue that our qualitative conclusions should be valid generically for any biasing mechanism involving a scale-dependent amplification of the correlation function. One implication is that the real-space correlation function will be a better instrument to probe for the underlying Harrison Zeldovich spectrum in the distribution of visible matter, as the characteristic asymptotic negative power-law ξ (r) ∼ -r^- 4 tail is undistorted by biasing...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAn Avoider–Enforcer game {{is played}} by two players, called Avoider and Enforcer, on a {{hypergraph}} F⊆ 2 X. The players claim previously unoccupied elements of the board X in turns. Enforcer wins if Avoider claims all vertices of some element of F, otherwise Avoider wins. In a more general version of the game a bias b is introduced to level up the players' chances of winning; Avoider claims one element of the board {{in each of his}} moves, while Enforcer responds by claiming b elements. This traditional set of rules for Avoider–Enforcer games is known to have a shortcoming: it is not bias monotone. We relax the traditional rules in a rather natural way to obtain bias monotonicity. We analyze this new set of rules and compare it with the traditional ones to conclude some surprising results. In particular, we show that under the new rules the <b>threshold</b> <b>bias</b> for both the connectivity and Hamiltonicity games, played on the edge set of the complete graph Kn, is asymptotically equal to n/logn. This coincides with the asymptotic <b>threshold</b> <b>bias</b> of the same game played by two “random” players...|$|E

40|$|Waiter-Client and Client-Waiter {{games are}} two-player, perfect {{information}} games, with no chance moves, {{played on a}} finite set (board) with special subsets known as the winning sets. Each round of the biased (1 :q) game begins with Waiter offering q+ 1 previously unclaimed elements of the board to Client, who claims one. The q elements remaining are then claimed by Waiter. If Client fully claims a winning set by the time all board elements have been offered, he wins in the Client-Waiter game and loses in the Waiter-Client game. We give an estimate for the <b>threshold</b> <b>bias</b> of the (1 :q) Waiter-Client and Client-Waiter versions of two different games: the non- 2 -colourability game, played on the complete k-uniform hypergraph, and the k-SAT game. In particular, we show that the unique value of q at which {{the winner of the}} Client-Waiter version of the non- 2 -colourability game changes is 1 /nnk 2 ^-k(1 +o_k(1)) and, for the Waiter-Client version, the corresponding value of q is 1 /nnk 2 ^Θ_k(k). Additionally, we show that the <b>threshold</b> <b>bias</b> for the Waiter-Client and Client-Waiter versions of the k-SAT game is 1 /nnk up to a factor that is exponential and polynomial in k respectively. This shows that these games exhibit the "probabilistic intuition". Comment: 16 page...|$|E

Our results suggest that: (1) the deficits for alignment <b>thresholds</b> and <b>bias</b> are uncorrelated; (2) in the majority of strabismic amblyopes, both deficits are scale invariant; (3) the form of the regional distribution depends on the spatial measure used and the scale at which it is measured; and (4) there is a poor correlation between the deficit for either spatial measure and the contrast sensitivity loss.

We introduce a multistep fractal weathering assessment scheme devoted to extract fractal weathering classifiers from texture analysis of the mineral's image. Our scheme enables to quantitatively estimate the global and local information about the geometry of the weathering pattern. This information is basic to develop geometrical indices of weathering, which can significantly enrich the common qualitative and semiquantitative weathering assessment schemes. To justify the fractal approach, a strong statistical self-similarity has been documented for both the weathering and fresh features of two common silica minerals: quartz and biogenic A-opal (phytolith) over four orders of length scales.

40|$|Stimulation of {{transcription}} by extracellular signals is a {{major component}} of a cell's decision making. Yet the quantitative relationship between signal and acute transcriptional response is unclear. One view is that transcription is directly graded with inducer concentration. In an alternative model, the response occurs only above a threshold inducer concentration. Standard methods for monitoring transcription lack continuous information from individual cells or mask immediate-early transcription by measuring downstream protein expression. We have therefore used a technique for directly monitoring nascent RNA in living cells, to quantify the direct transcriptional response to an extracellular signal in real time, in single cells. At increasing doses of inducer, increasing numbers of cells displayed a transcriptional response. However, over the same range of doses, the change in cell response strength, measured as the length, frequency and intensity of transcriptional pulses, was small, with considerable variation between cells. These data support a model in which cells have different sensitivities to developmental inducer and respond in a digital manner above individual stimulus <b>thresholds.</b> <b>Biased</b> digital responses may be necessary for certain forms of developmental specification.

40|$|The {{distribution}} of the apparent total energy emitted by a gamma-ray burst reflects not only the {{distribution of}} the energy actually released by the burst engine, but also the distribution of beaming angles. Using the observed energy fluences, the detection thresholds and burst redshifts for three burst samples, I calculate the best-fit parameters for lognormal and power-law distributions of the apparent total energy. Two of the samples include a small number of bursts with spectroscopic redshifts, while the third sample has 220 bursts with redshifts determined by the proposed variability-luminosity correlation. I find different sets of parameter values for the three burst samples. The Bayesian odds ratio cannot distinguish between the two model distribution functions for the two smaller burst samples with spectroscopic redshifts, but does favor the lognormal distribution for the larger sample with variability-derived redshifts. The data do not rule out a distribution with a low energy tail which is currently unobservable. I find that neglecting the burst detection <b>threshold</b> <b>biases</b> the fitted distribution to be narrower with a higher average value than the true distribution; this demonstrates the importance of determining and reporting the effective detection threshold for bursts in a sample.

The question arises whether the object features of opponent shapes can be compared by touch. Therefore, we investigated whether human observers were able to discriminate the curvatures of convex and concave shapes, irrespective of whether the shape was convex or concave. Using a 2 AFC procedure, subjects had to compare the curvature of a convex shape to the curvature of a concave shape. In addition, results were also obtained for congruent shapes, when the curvature of either only convex shapes or only concave shapes had to be compared. Psychometric curves were fitted to the data to obtain <b>threshold</b> and <b>bias</b> results. When subjects explored the stimuli with a single index finger, significantly higher thresholds were obtained for the opponent shapes than for the congruent shapes. However, when the stimuli were touched by two index fingers, one finger per surface, we found similar <b>thresholds.</b> Systematic <b>biases</b> were found when the curvature of opponent shapes was compared: the curvature of a more curved convex surface was judged equal to the curvature of a less curved concave surface. We conclude that human observers had the ability to compare the curvature of shapes with an opposite direction, but that their performance decreased when they sensed the opponent surfaces with the same finger. Moreover, they systematically underestimated the curvature of convex shapes compared to the curvature of concave shapes...|$|R
