Women who try to deal with sexual harassment on their own, regardless of what they do, seem to be in a no-win situation.|$|E
25|$|Abelardo Lafuente Garcia-Rojo (Madrid 1871 – Shanghai 1931) was a Spanish {{architect}} and entrepreneur {{who had his}} own studio in colonial Shanghai. Between 1913 and 1931 {{he was the only}} Spaniard to have an architect studio registered in the city; Lafuente collaborated with several contemporary architects. Lafuente blended the mozarab and moorish styles from Spain into Chinese architecture. In 2009, the Spanish architect Alvaro Leonardo Perez established the Lafuente Research Project. <b>The</b> <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> project were first presented at the Shanghai World Expo in 2010 in collaboration with the Instituto Cervantes.

There have also been several studies done studying this cross culturally. One study that explored this relationship, was a study conducted in 2009 by Eadaoin Hui and Tat Sing Chau. In this study, Hui and Chau looked at the relationship between forgiveness interventions and Chinese children who were less likely to forgive those who had wronged them. <b>The</b> <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> study showed that there was an effect of forgiveness interventions on the young Chinese children.|$|E
25|$|A study {{performed}} by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Gas Research Institute (GRI) in 1997 sought to discover whether the reduction in carbon dioxide emissions from increased natural gas (predominantly methane) use would be offset by a possible increased level of methane emissions from sources such as leaks and emissions. The study concluded that the reduction in emissions from increased natural gas use outweighs the detrimental effects of increased methane emissions. More recent peer-reviewed studies have challenged <b>the</b> <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> study, with researchers from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) reconfirming findings of high rates of methane (CH4) leakage from natural gas fields.|$|E
25|$|In a 1997 {{paper on}} the effect of police hiring on crime rates, Levitt used the timing of mayoral and gubernatorial {{elections}} as an instrumental variable to identify a causal effect of police on crime. Past studies had been inconclusive because of the simultaneity inherent in police hiring (when crime increases, more police are hired to combat crime). <b>The</b> <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> paper were found {{to be the result of}} a programming error. This was pointed out in a comment by Justin McCrary published in the American Economic Review in 2002.

25|$|Although {{antiretroviral}} {{therapy has}} helped {{to improve the quality}} of life of people living with HIV, there is still a need to explore other ways to further address the disease burden. One such potential strategy that was investigated was to add interleukin 2 as an adjunct to antiretroviral therapy for adults with HIV. A Cochrane review included 25 randomized controlled trials that were conducted across six countries. The researchers found that interleukin 2 increases the CD4 immune cells, but does not make a difference in terms of death and incidence of other infections. Furthermore, there is probably an increase in side-effects with interleukin 2. <b>The</b> <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> review do not support the use of interleukin 2 as an add-on treatment to antiretroviral therapy for adults with HIV.|$|E
25|$|In the study, {{researchers}} created {{two versions}} of the same news story – one with compelling negative images and one without. Participants were asked to watch a 20 minute news video (half of the participants saw the negative images and the other half did not) and an additional ten-minute video. They were instructed to pay attention because they would be tested afterwards. A follow up survey was sent 6 to 7 weeks later to measure memory and recall from the news video. The results support the idea that people better remember information that comes after a negative event. Respondents who viewed the negative images better remembered {{the second half of the}} newscast than the part preceding the negative images. <b>The</b> <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> study further support the media equation assumption that mediated experiences are the same as natural experiences.|$|E
25|$|The {{existence}} {{of both the}} proto-Parthenon and its destruction were known from Herodotus, and the drums of its columns were plainly visible built into the curtain wall north of the Erechtheon. Further physical evidence of this structure was revealed with the excavations of Panagiotis Kavvadias of 1885–90. <b>The</b> <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> dig allowed Wilhelm Dörpfeld, then director of the German Archaeological Institute, to assert that there existed a distinct substructure to the original Parthenon, called Parthenon I by Dörpfeld, not immediately below the present edifice as had been previously assumed. Dörpfeld's observation was that the three steps of the first Parthenon consisted of two steps of Poros limestone, {{the same as the}} foundations, and a top step of Karrha limestone that was covered by the lowest step of the Periclean Parthenon. This platform was smaller and slightly {{to the north of the}} final Parthenon, indicating that it was built for a wholly different building, now completely covered over. This picture was somewhat complicated by the publication of the final report on the 1885–90 excavations, indicating that the substructure was contemporary with the Kimonian walls, and implying a later date for the first temple.|$|E

The committee of inquiry was to consist of eight members, Sir Algernon West was made chairman. They were tasked to investigate [...] "the constitution, duties and administration of the Heralds' College". The main issues being the anomalous position of the College, who are theoretically officials of the Royal Household, but actually derive their income from fees paid by private individuals for their services. Some {{of the members of the}} committee (a minority) wanted (like Burke thirty-four years earlier) to make officers of the College of Arms into [...] "salaried civil servants of the state". Despite concluding that some form of change was necessary, the inquiry categorically stated that any changes [...] "is at the present time and in present circumstances impracticable."
