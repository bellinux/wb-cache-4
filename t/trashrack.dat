40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an investigation into}} the different <b>trashrack</b> designs and their impact on fluid flow losses. Three different rackbar profiles were examined which cause different flow losses. A simple low-cost rectangle profile was used as a base-case and compared with two alternative aerodynamically-shaped profiles, which made the <b>trashrack</b> much more expensive. The river’s flow from 200 m upstream of the hydropower plant to the turbine inlet was simulated by 3 D CFD simulations using an ANSYS CFX 12 solver. The aim of the simulations was to predict the exact velocity field ahead of the <b>trashrack.</b> The local head-losses caused by the <b>trashrack</b> were then calculated using an empirical formula at each point of the velocity field, and finally integrated to obtain the gross head-loss caused by the specific <b>trashrack</b> design. Annual losses during electricity production were then predicted using experimentally-obtained river flow-rate data and the net profit then calculated, which served for the final study of the alternative <b>trashrack</b> design’s economics. The study showed that a profit from the alternative <b>trashrack</b> design could be expected after a period of 10 years, which may be of the interest when replacing an old or damaged <b>trashrack</b> with a new one...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} study of open channels flows across conventional and fish-friendly <b>trashrack</b> models in a towing tank is reported. Experiments are conducted for two kinds of trashracks, respectively comprised of fixed-width rectangular and profiled bars. Various <b>trashrack</b> orientation angles, bar-to-bar spacings and incoming flow velocities are investigated, while detailed Particle Image Velocimetry measurements are carried-out upstream and downstream of the trashracks in the streamwise-spanwise plane, along with pressure recordings. A stitching technique applied to the quasi time-resolved PIV snapshots allows a precise reconstruction of the flows, leading to the investigation of extended datasets. The flow analysis reveals significant effects of the various <b>trashrack</b> configurations on the topology of the flow, with a strong influence on the mixing layer and {{on the extent of}} the downstream recirculation region...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Applying various {{conventional}} and modern monitoring methods a function control of downstream migration facilities and turbine passage related mortality {{was conducted at}} the Kostheim Hydro Plant (4, 9 MW; two Kaplan turbines; Δh max. 3, 74 m, at MQ 2, 36 m) at the river Main (km 3, 2). Furthermore, the perceptibility and passability of a nature-like bypass for upstream migration was examined. Results showed a size selectivity of the bypass caused by an unsuitable entrance position 40 m downstream of the outlet of the turbines. The effectiveness of the downstream migration facilities proved to be low, leading to high mortalities at the <b>trashrack</b> and during turbine passage. The vertical bar <b>trashrack</b> with a bar spacing of 20 mm showed little repellent effect and was passed by most fish up to a size of 20 - 25 cm total length, causing scale loss and haematoma in Atlantic salmon smolts and cyprinid species. Eels smaller than 65 cm were unable to pass the <b>trashrack</b> and the majority was killed by the <b>trashrack</b> cleaning device. Particularly, smaller eels experienced high mortalities at the turbine passage...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2012 A failure {{analysis}} investigation was completed on the <b>trashracks</b> at Powerhouse One of Rock Island Dam. The investigation {{was part of}} the overall condition assessment and rehabilitation work being performed at the dam. The <b>trashracks</b> were deemed a faulty system in 2005 when MWH, a contractor for Chelan County PUD, initially inspected the racks. Building on the original work completed by MWH, this project compiled background information and conducted field inspections to evaluate the future reliability of the <b>trashracks.</b> The field inspections identified consistent failures of the diagonal tie rods, discovered cracks in the rackbar welds, and highlighted the noticeable presence of corrosion damage. Though localized failures were identified, a static analysis concluded that the overall structural design was adequate for continued operations. Field tests and a finite element model were compared in a dynamic analysis to ensure the vibration induced stresses did not reach the allowable limit. Ultimately, the <b>trashracks</b> received new diagonal braces constructed from angle iron to replace the failing tie rods. Damaged welds, caused by the propagation of cracks from welding defects, were repaired and the racks were sandblasted to remove corrosion debris and repainted to prevent future degradation...|$|R
40|$|A {{bypass system}} for postspawned American shad Alosa sapidissima began {{operation}} in 1980 on the Connecticut River canal system at Holyoke Dam. The {{purpose of the}} bypass was to enable downstream migrants that enter the canal to exit and avoid death due to delay or passage through hydroelectric turbines at water use facilities. The bypass system had the following elements: (1) an underwater AC electrical or acoustic barrier to prevent American shad from leaving the bypass area, (2) an underwater DC electrical field to immobilize fish for collection, and (3) a collection box with transfer pipe to carry fish into the river below the dam. During studies of the bypass system from 1979 to 1983, {{we found that the}} fish barriers were ineffective, the collection system was partially effective for American shad but not for anadromous species that passed through <b>trashracks,</b> and American shad could be immobilized and transported at high velocity through a pipe and have only low mortality (4 - 9 %). Radio-tagged American shad, unwilling to pass through <b>trashracks</b> at water exits on the canal, behaved like trapped fish and were delayed an average of two or more days before dying or exiting the canal. An estimated 10 of 47 (21 %) of the radio-tagged fish were passed. In 1980, when the greatest number of American shad were passed, an estimated 142, 000 (37 % of the fish lifted at the dam) survived spawning and used the bypass. After several years of operation, it was evident that, even with major improvements, the bypass could not pass the available American shad, and it was not useful for protecting other anadromous migrants that did not avoid <b>trashracks...</b>|$|R

40|$|Problems {{contributing}} to the low fish guidance at Rocky Reach Dam were investigatedthrough laboratory experiments and a computer model. Particular attention was given todetermining how strobe lights {{could be used to}} improve fish guidance efficiency. In general, juvenile Chinook and coho salmon and rainbow trout tended to avoid or escape strobelight at intensities between 0. 1 and 5 ìE/m 2 /s. The EG 2 ̆ 6 G strobe lights used at Rocky ReachDam produced an intensity of about 1 ìE/m 2 /s at a distance of 10 ft. Escape speed averagedabout 7 bI/s and was dependent on strobe light intensity and the level of light that fish wereadapted to. Escape speed increased with strobe flash rate, with a flash rate of 200 /mm or abovebeing sufficient to induce speed near the maximum observed. Strobe intensity above 5 ìE/m 2 /sand flash rates above about 500 /mm tended to stun fish. Juvenile steelhead were attracted to thelow light intensities of the strobe 2 ̆ 7 s penumbra. A computer model was developed to describe the trajectories of fish as affected by water currentsand swimming to avoid strobe lights and the <b>trashrack.</b> A model suggested that trashrackpassage was a critical factor in fish guidance efficiency. In laboratory experiments, strobe lightcould be used to force rainbow trout through a trashrack-like barrier. However, at Rocky ReachDam, strobe lights were ineffective at forcing subyearling Chinook through the <b>trashrack.</b> Thus, ahypothesis was formulated that the submersible traveling screen behind the <b>trashrack</b> may havegenerated sound stimuli that inhibited <b>trashrack</b> passage; moreover, it appeared that strobe lightswere ineffective in counteracting this aversive stimuli...|$|E

40|$|Several amphihaline species, such as silver eels, suffer high {{mortality}} rates during their downstream migration, {{due to their}} passage through turbines. The combination of adapted trashracks (inclined or angled screen, lower bar spacing, …) with bypasses can efficiently prevent these mortalities. A numerical study {{has been carried out}} with such angled trashracks. Numerical results with model scale racks were validated against previous experimental results on model trashracks, resulting from head loss and velocity distribution measurements (Raynal et al., 2013). Real scale racks were then computed in order to evaluate the influence of both the bar spacing and the channel width on velocity distributions in real dimensions. The mesh generation and the numerical simulations were performed by the open source CFD software suite OpenFOAM. The <b>trashrack</b> solid comprised basic elements, individually created using CAD software and directly inserted in OpenFOAM’s mesh generation utility. For small scale configurations, grid refinement was applied at the flume walls, at <b>trashrack</b> bars and downstream of the <b>trashrack,</b> whereas only bars were refined for real scale racks. The resulting number of cells ranged between 100, 000 and 1, 500, 000. Steady state results were obtained by solving the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations for an incompressible and monophasic flow. The k-ε, k-ε-based RNG, k-ω, k-ω-based shear stress transport (SST) and Spalart-Allmaras models were examined to select the most appropriate one in terms of computation time and result accuracy. Results show that the k-ε-RNG is the model best agreeing with experimental results. Two-dimensional calculations seem to provide quite satisfactory results although both the head losses {{and the size of the}} recirculation zone downstream of the <b>trashrack</b> are slightly under-estimated. Real scale results confirm experimental ones and show that the bar spacing slightly effects upstream velocity profiles. Downstream of the rack, simulations with different flume width demonstrated that the size of the recirculation zone is proportional to the channel width...|$|E
40|$|Between 2004 and 2007, 116 {{downstream}} migrant silver eels (Anguilla anguilla) were monitored at a {{hydropower plant}} on the Gave de Pau river in South-West France using radio and PIT telemetry. The objectives of the study were: (i) to determine the environmental conditions when eels arrived and passed the facility; (ii) to determine the rate of eel escapement (passage other than via the turbines); (iii) to describe the behaviour of eels faced with the intake structure and the permeability of the intake <b>trashracks</b> for the different sizes of eel; and (iv) to determine whether surface bypasses originally designed for salmon could be effective for eels. Five types of behaviour of silver eels in the forebay and at the plant intakes were identified. The study showed the key factor influencing both eel behaviour and the route taken through the plant was variation in river discharge. Escapement rate was related to eel length and the spill flow to river flow ratio, which could be described by a logistic regression model. The surface bypasses originally designed for salmon were found to aid downstream eel migration significantly. At velocities < 0. 40 m·s− 1, no eels, even the largest, for which the racks are a physical barrier, were found impinged on the <b>trashracks...</b>|$|R

In 1983, the initial measurements of fish guidance levels were less than 25 % for yearling and subyearling Chinook (O. tshawytscha) and coho (O. kisutch) salmon and approximately 33 % for steelhead (O. mykiss), compared with expected levels greater than 70 % for all species. Modifications based upon hydraulic models and field research {{were made to the}} <b>trashracks,</b> STSs, and face of the powerhouse. With these modifications, yearling Chinook and coho salmon guidance levels greater than 75 % were sometimes attained, but maximum steelhead guidance was less than 70 %.

Water depths and velocity profiles were acquired upstream and downstream of each rack configuration. The results reveal that the head-loss coefficient for angled racks with streamwise bars does not depend on the rack angle and can be calculated with equations for racks perpendicular to the channel. Upstream velocity profiles along the rack are not significantly affected by the rack angle and downstream transverse profiles are nearly uniform. A comparison with conventional angled trashracks with bars set perpendicular to the rack revealed the many advantages of streamwise bars...|$|E

The maximum turbine discharge varied from 20 to 85 m 3 /s and the width of intakes varied from 11 to 30 m depending on the plant. The surface bypasses were located laterally along the intake atone end of the <b>trashrack.</b> The mean bypass discharges varied from 0. 4 to 4 m 3 /s, or an averageof 2 to 8 % of the turbine discharge. The efficiency of the devices was evaluated by the markrecapturetechnique. Radio telemetry was used to monitor movement patterns of salmon andseat trout smolts {{in front of the}} intake and near bypass entrances. Depending on the site, themean bypass efficiency was found to be between 17 and 80 %. Behaviour of fish in the vicinity ofthe <b>trashrack</b> and the bypass seemed to be largely influenced by the flow pattern. Poor hydraulicconditions (turbulence, strong acceleration, upwellings) and insufficient discharge were identifiedthrough direct and video observations as being responsible for many aborted passages at thebypass entrances. The results suggest that siting of surface bypass systems must take into account flow patterns inboth the <b>trashrack</b> area and intake canal.

40|$|A 1 : 6 scale {{physical}} model and a computational {{model of a}} Tracy Fish Collection Facility (TFCF) primary bypass intake with approach louvers were studied to refine bypass approach velocity distributions. The TFCF functions to prevent fish entrainment at the Tracy Pumping Plant. The TFCF collects fish that are {{then returned to the}} Delta. To achieve efficient fish collection, velocity fields should be generated that are uniform and that supply well directed guidance to the bypass entrance. In the first phase of this study, modeling was used to develop low maintenance internal features of the bypass entrance that generated near-uniform internal velocity distributions (Kubitschek 2003). This second phase study focused on extending the 1 : 3 model findings to the approach flow. Study findings show that velocity distributions {{in the vicinity of the}} bypass entrance are influenced by approach flow velocity distributions. This may imply that the TFCF <b>trashracks</b> and louvers should be maintained clean to sustain uniform velocity fields approaching and entering the intakes. Findings also show that by adding a minor flow restriction to the backside of the louver immediately adjacent to the bypass entrances, a local through louver high velocity zone can be eliminated which should improve fish guidance to the bypass intake. Finally, findings show that acceptable passing flow and bypass entrance hydraulics can be maintained with the bypass guide wall removed. This supports possible future guide wall removal that could lead to application of improved louver cleaning techniques (i. e., eliminate the need for removal of the louver panels during cleaning) ...|$|R

In BioIndex testing {{the goal is}} to identify those operations within the range identified by Index testing where the survival of fish passing through the turbine is maximized. BioIndex testing includes the immediate tailrace region as well as the turbine environment between a turbine's intake <b>trashracks</b> and the exit of its draft tube. The US Army Corps of Engineers and the Department of Energy have been evaluating a variety of means, such as numerical and physical turbine models, to investigate the quality of flow through a hydro-turbine and other aspects of the turbine environment that determine its safety for fish. The goal is to use these tools to develop hypotheses identifying turbine operations and predictions of their biological performance that can be tested at prototype scales. Acceptance of hypotheses would be the means for validation of new operating rules for the turbine tested that would be in place when fish were passing through the turbines. The overall goal of this project is to evaluate the performance of numerical blade strike models as a tool to aid development of testable hypotheses for bioIndexing. Evaluation of the performance of numerical blade strike models is accomplished by comparing predictions of fish mortality resulting from strike by turbine runner blades with observations made using live test fish at mainstem Columbia River Dams and with other predictions of blade strike made using observations of beads passing through a 1 : 25 scale physical turbine model...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The River Mill Dam Hydroelectric Development {{is part of}} the Clackamas River Hydroelectric Project in {{northwest}} Oregon, USA owned and operated by Portland General Electric (PGE). A downstream migrant fish collector and bypass facility was installed on the dam in 2012. The dam was constructed in 1911, and although a fish ladder was included at the time, and upstream passage of anadromous and resident fish has always been provided, downstream passage was only possible through the turbines or over the spillway until the collector and bypass was added. The collector is unique in that attraction water used to entice the fish into the collector is provided by the integration of one of the original five turbine/generators into the collector. This eliminates the need for pumps or the spilling of water to drive the attraction flow, and results in very costeffective operation. The majority of the attraction flow is screened away from the fish and passes directly through the turbine. The orientation of the collector entrance is also designed to work in conjunction with the powerhouse <b>trashracks</b> in front of the remaining four turbine/generator units to lead the fish toward the entrance. The fish bypass facilities include a sampling station that automatically sorts fish by size and a bypass pipe to the tailrace that combines smoothly at high velocity with a second bypass pipe from another dam upstream. The project has been extremely successful, and has safely collected and bypassed numbers of fish far in excess of its original design capacity in both of {{the first two years of}} operation. This presentation will provide an overview of the project, the hydraulic design involved in the unique turbine integration and fish attraction characteristics, and the impressive biological results from the initial years of operation...|$|R
40|$|The Acoustic Scintillation Flow Meter (ASFM) {{has been}} used to make turbine {{discharge}} measurements in over 25 different low-head intakes {{in the course of the}} past 8 years. These measurements were highly repeatable (random uncertainty < ± 0. 5 %), but in some cases, apparent systematic errors, ranging from ± 1 % (the limit of verification accuracy) to – 7 % were observed. An intensive review of potential sources for systematic error in the hydraulic environment of short intakes was therefore undertaken. The chief sources considered were the element spacing in the sensor arrays, boundary effects at the intake passage walls, the implementation of the flow algorithm, and the effects of non-uniformities in the velocity and turbulence fields caused by major <b>trashrack</b> supports in the intake upstream of the ASFM location. The results of this review are summarized; they show that significant contributions to systematic error arise only from the effects of spatial variations in velocity and turbulence produced by upstream structures. Compilation of data shows the systematic error to be dependent on the product of the width, number and drag coefficient of large vertical <b>trashrack</b> supports at the intake entrance. In the absence of such supports, or at locations far enough downstream, systematic errors are consistently negligible. ASFM flow measurement algorithms implicitly assume uniformity along the path for either the flow velocity or for the local turbulence intensity. Errors in the path-averaged velocity are introduced if a non-uniform velocity distribution along a path is accompanied by a non-uniform distribution of turbulence. Since the wakes of <b>trashrack</b> supports are regions of reduced velocity and elevated turbulence, the wakes from supports oriented perpendicularly to the ASFM sampling path will produce a negative bias. Simultaneous measurements along coplanar horizontal and vertical ASFM paths at a low-head plant on the Columbia River are presented to illustrate this effect, and show that the bias can be corrected with knowledge of the form of the velocity and turbulence variations...|$|E

An experiment was conducted in 1998 at the Pointis water intake, on the Garonne River, to define location for a future downstream bypass for Atlantic salmon smolts. The study of the movements of 28 radiotagged smolts revealed that under low hydraulic conditions (flow velocities < 0. 5 - 0. 6 m/s), the smolts maintain their position for a significant time (median time greater than one day) in the intake canal, despite the large spacing (5 cm) between {{the bars of the}} <b>trashrack.</b> During this time, they explore the whole area of the intake canal above the <b>trashrack.</b> A light placed on the left bank just upstream from the <b>trashrack</b> concentrated the fish on the same bank as the lamp, {{in the vicinity of the}} lighted area. The proportion of fish passing downstream from the Rodère dam itself was estimated. This dam, located downstream from the Pointis plant, supplies the Camon hydroelectric powerhouse. It appeared that the proportions of smolts passing through the Rodere dam were related to the ratio of discharge at the dam to the total Garonne flow : 70 % of the smolts passed by when the discharge at the dam corresponded to 40 - 50 % of the total Garonne flow. The time taken by radiotagged smolts to go from the Pointis plant to the Camon powerhouse (5. 4 km) varied from 1 hour 17 minutes to 12 days with a median value of more than one day, and depended on river discharges.

40|$|Abstract. — This paper {{describes}} a simulation study of reconnection options for white sturgeon Acipenser transmontanus subpopulations in adjacent river segments {{above and below}} CJ Strike Dam on the Snake River, Idaho, USA. In contrast to the downstream river segment, the upstream river segment is long and has areas that are suitable for spawning during normal and wet hydrologic conditions. We evaluated demographic and genetic consequences of upstream and downstream passage using different model assumptions about <b>trashrack</b> spacing and density-dependent effects on the spawning interval. Our genetic results predict that, although reconnection would introduce new alleles to the upstream subpopulation, it would also preserve alleles from the down-stream subpopulation by propagating them in the larger subpopulation above the dam. Our demographic results predict that halving the space between trashracks would have large and unequivocal benefits, whereas the predicted effects of reconnection were smaller and more sensitive to model assumptions. Simulated upstream passage tended to benefit both subpopulations only {{in the absence of}} density-dependent limitation. In the presence of density dependence, the combination of halved <b>trashrack</b> spacing and upstream and downstream passage produced the best results. Narrower trashracks kept spawning adults in the upstream segment with spawning habitat, while allowing their progeny to migrate downstream.

The model area covers an about 200 m × 300 m section of the Beyhan 1 reservoir, the intake structure having four units, the trash racks and penstocks. Experiments were carried out at various reservoir water levels with specified unit operation discharges for various unit operation conditions.

40|$|Abstract: To conciliate the {{hydroelectric}} {{production and}} the restoration and protection plans of migratory species, in particular salmon (Salmo salar), sea trout (Salmo trutta) and eel (Anguilla anguilla), and more generally the longitudinal continuity for fish species, {{it is necessary to}} avoid or at least reduce damages to fish passing through turbines. The best way to reduce fish mortality would be to install fish-friendly turbines, {{but it is not a}} cost-effective solution on existing installations and in the present state of the art their use is very limited in terms of head and discharge ranges. Transforming conventional intakes into socalled “fish-friendly” ones is therefore considered as one of the most acceptable solutions. We present here the development of criteria for the design and dimensioning of fishfriendly intakes for small hydropower plants in France (up to ≈ 100 m 3 /s until now). These criteria were established from the feedback following the evaluation of existing downstream bypasses in France and abroad, and from hydraulic studies on downscale models. Fish-friendly intakes comprise a <b>trashrack</b> designed to guide fish towards its downstream end and to the entrances of bypasses, through which fish safely reach the tailwater. Criteria concern (1) the clear space between bars to avoid the passage of fish through the <b>trashrack</b> and via turbines, (2) the inclination or angulation of the rack to guide fish towards the bypasses located at its downstream end, (3) the normal velocity through the rack to avoid fish impingement, and (4) the number, positions, dimensions, and discharge of bypasses to collect the fish. New formulae have also been proposed to evaluate head-losses for inclined or angled trashracks with low bar-spacing...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: To {{mitigate}} {{negative effects}} of hydropower production on riverine fish populations, new technological solutions need to be found to increase downstream fish passage. In this study, downstream passage of Atlantic salmon smolt was documented at the power plant Unkelmühle (River Sieg, Germany). Here, a novel approach is used, combining a 10 mm vertical <b>trashrack</b> with surface bypasses and a vertical slot pass for fish protection. Fish migrating through surface bypasses can be diverted into a concrete basin for monitoring purposes. A complex radio telemetry system was used to cover all potential migration corridors. In spring 2014, 78 salmon smolt were tagged with radio transmitters and released about 9 km upstream the power station. Additionally, another 800 smolt were dye marked and released at the same site. An intense monitoring program during the following weeks provided, amongst others, migration time, routes and speed. Catches in the monitoring basin showed that salmon was the dominant species migrating through the surface bypass (more than 60 %), followed by nase, barbel and brown trout. Smolt were mainly caught after dusk and migration {{could be related to}} water discharge and temperature with wild smolt migrating slightly later than the stocked ones. Telemetry data showed that most smolt migrated with the main current towards the turbines, but were prevented from going through the turbines by the <b>trashrack</b> and used the surface bypasses instead. Migration speed for smolt differed according to the river stretch fish swam through (natural river stretch, reservoir and power plant). Studies at Unkelmühle as well as at two other power plants with different technological approaches for fish protection will continue to compare solutions and concepts that enable downstream fish passage...|$|E
40|$|Experimental {{results for}} fish-friendly trashracks {{placed in an}} open water channel are presented. <b>Trashrack</b> models with {{different}} bar shape, spacing and inclination are tested. The numerous configurations provide results on head losses which are fitted by a new formula which takes into account all these parameters. It especially separates the blocking ratio due to bars, which is impacted by the inclination, from that due to transversal elements, such as spacer rows, whose effect on the flow is not altered with the rack inclination. Clogging, which {{is more likely to}} occur more on grids with thin space between bars, was simulated with a set of perforated plates. Its influence on head losses has been investigated, and a small adaptation of the formula proposed for clean grids was sufficient to obtain satisfactory results for clogged ones...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—A micro-scale {{hydroelectric}} {{plant has}} been proposed for Crow Creek, a mountain stream located in an off-grid area of the Chugach Range near Girdwood, Alaska. The run-of-river plant design has an expected generation capacity of 125 kW, and could power up to thirty homes and displace polluting diesel generation. The cold-climate hydrology and thermal regime of the stream are crucial {{in the design of}} hydroelectric plants in sub-Arctic regions. Solutions for intake ice problems discussed include the inducement of ice cover formation, deep submergence of hydraulic intake works, mechanical ice removal, and even <b>trashrack</b> heating. Also discussed are the physical characteristics of penstocks, the burial and insulation of penstocks to prevent ice blockage, and frazil ice problems. The cold-climate problems of the stream will not preclude micro-hydropower development, but the Crow Creek site demands special design considerations and maintenance procedures...|$|E
40|$|To prevent fish {{entrainment}} at the Tracy Pumping Plant, the Tracy Fish Collection Facility (TFCF) {{was designed}} to guide fish along a diagonal line of louvers into one of four primary bypass intakes. Replacement primary bypass intakes and transition boxes with a new tapered choke design were installed in 2004 to improve hydraulic conditions for fish collection. The replacement intakes were developed in the laboratory for an expected range of field operating conditions. Hydraulic field evaluations were conducted to verify {{the performance of the}} new intakes. Velocity profiles were collected in the intake entrance and upstream of the intakes to document velocity field distributions. Results show that common field conditions such as bypass ratios less than 1. o and high debris loads adversely affect bypass performance by degrading uniformity in the vertical velocity profiles at the bypass entrances. Such uniformity is considered a performance indicator from past studies connected with fish salvage efficiency. Facility operation with bypass ratios greater than 1. 0 provides the best hydraulic conditions for efficient fish collection by minimizing flow disruption and eddying and promoting smooth flow acceleration into the intakes. Since debris can affect approach velocity distributions, debris fouling on the <b>trashrack</b> and louvers should be minimized...|$|E
40|$|Different design {{criteria}} for successful flushing of hydropower headworks have been evaluated. Main {{focus has been}} on handling of floating debris for small hydropower plant in Norway, as well as sediment handling for run of the river-projects in sediment-carrying rivers. As a new way of cleaning intake screens clogged by debris, the concept of backflushing has been investigated. The intake screen, called trash rack, is then cleaned by a reveresed water flow over a short period of time, and the clogged material flushed out thorugh a flushing pipe. A physical test tank was developed to evaluate parameters for a successful flushing of trash racks with different degrees of clogging. A test device was developed to evaluate adhesion, i. e. the level of friction between clogged material and the trash rack. The required gross water velocity over a trash rack during flushing for detaching of the clogged material was found to be in the range of 0. 1 to 0. 2 m/s, with a typical value of 0. 12 m/s. The clogged material tend to resist a maximum limit of pressure difference over the trash rack before it detaches. Results are showing a pressure difference resistance in the range of 0. 05 - 0. 10 meterWater Column (mWC). The pressure difference prove hard to obtain as parts of the <b>trashrack</b> is cleaned. Hence, a flushing gate should be opened at a high rate to obtain the best flushing efficiency. A field trip to Nepal has been conducted to gain experience in sediment handling, and to work with physical models at HydroLab Pvt Ltd in Kathmandu. Observed intake solutions have been evaluated both against existing theory and results from a physical model study. It has been documented through a model test series that the flushing ability of an undersluice gate is limited to only a few meters upstream of the flushing gate. The limit for flushing by bed transport has been tested in a model, and compared to theory for evaluating initial movement of the sediment bed. Experiments are supporting that Shield s theory of critical shear stress can be used to predict the occurrence of bed movement. Design and operation of settling basins have been investigated, together with the appurtenant different strategies for flushing. The possibility of applying the concept of backflushing of trash racks for headworks arrangements including sediment settling basins have been evaluated. For projects where the trash rack can be located upstream of the settling basin, the combination seems feasible, as parts of the water storage in the settling basin could be used for the backflushing. However, the trash rack should be placed downstream of the settling basins for most Himalayan headworks arrangements, which makes backflushing impossible...|$|E
