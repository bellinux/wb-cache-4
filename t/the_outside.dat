5|$|A typical keep {{would have}} {{between three and}} seven stories {{discernible}} from <b>the</b> <b>outside.</b> Its inner structure including the number of floors could differ from the outward appearance. Castle towers at Himeji, Inuyama, Matsue and Matsumoto Castle have one floor more than is visible from <b>the</b> <b>outside.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although {{the door}} was unlocked, a thumb screw inside {{apparently}} {{made it difficult for}} a child to open. The door had a knob on <b>the</b> <b>outside,</b> but only a small turn latch on the inside.|$|E
5|$|As a defence {{against the}} cold, {{a colony of}} emperor {{penguins}} forms a compact huddle (also known as the turtle formation) {{ranging in size from}} ten to several hundred birds, with each bird leaning forward on a neighbour. As the wind chill is the least severe {{in the center of the}} colony, all the juveniles are usually huddled there. Those on <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> upwind tend to shuffle slowly around the edge of the formation and add themselves to its leeward edge, producing a slow churning action, and giving each bird a turn on the inside and on <b>the</b> <b>outside.</b>|$|E

50|$|Before the renovations, {{there were}} no toilets within the station, and the Suginami public toilet in <b>the</b> square <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> station was used. With the new over-track station building, however, toilets were built inside the ticket gates, {{including}} a multipurpose toilet. After the station's renovations were completed, <b>the</b> public toilet <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> station was rebuilt. <b>The</b> shops <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> south exit were closed before the renovation.|$|R
50|$|Recent work {{suggests}} that <b>the</b> area <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> South Ireland End Moraine was inundated by Irish Ice {{during and after}} the LGM. At the same time parts of <b>the</b> area <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> South Wales End Moraine must also have been inundated by ice.|$|R
5|$|Beef steak can {{be cooked}} {{to a level}} of very rare (bleu, a cold raw center), rare, medium rare, medium, medium well done, or well done. Pittsburgh rare is charred on <b>the</b> <b>outside.</b> Beef, unlike certain other meats, {{does not need to be}} cooked through. Food-borne human {{illnesses}} are not normally found within a beef steak, though surfaces can potentially be contaminated from handling, and thus, very rare steak (seared on <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> and raw within) is generally accepted as safe.|$|E
5|$|Gordon led on the lap-38 restart, {{followed}} by Truex and Burton. One lap later, Burton, with assistance from Johnson, passed Gordon for the lead. Kenseth claimed first position on lap 40 after driving on <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> lane. Vickers followed Johnson {{on the inside}} line to reclaim the lead on the following lap, before Sadler passed Vickers around <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> for the lead on the 44th lap. On lap 45, Mears led after passing Sadler, and debris was located on the backstretch, triggering a second caution. All drivers, including Mears, elected to make pit stops. Sadler reclaimed first position and led the field back up to speed at the lap-49 restart, ahead of Mears and Kyle Busch. Hamlin and Kyle Busch led the cars driving on <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> lane, with Busch claiming the lead on lap 51, pulling away {{from the rest of}} the field. Kurt Busch, with help from Vickers, got ahead of Kyle Busch to move into first place.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} storm, lack of power {{prevented}} communications and <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> world had little {{knowledge of the}} extent of the damage in Dominica. A citizen named Fred White ended that by using a battery-operated ham radio to contact the world.|$|E

5|$|In 1964, {{the largest}} {{earthquake}} ever {{recorded in the}} United States struck Anchorage and southern Alaska, cutting communications to <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> world. The quake was felt in Fairbanks, and it took 40 minutes for communications to be re-established with the Associated Press office in Seattle. When the connection was restored, the News-Miner sent the first reports of the earthquake to <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> world. The quake also destroyed {{the offices of the}} Anchorage Times, the leading newspaper in that city. The News-Miner offered its press facilities to the Times, and the two papers shared a masthead as Anchorage recovered from the tremor.|$|E
5|$|On Saturday afternoon, Matt Kenseth was fastest in {{the second}} {{practice}} session {{with a time of}} 30.321 seconds, ahead of Clint Bowyer and Earnhardt. Travis Kvapil was fourth-fastest; David Gilliland was fifth and Biffle sixth. Johnson, Newman, Hornish and Edwards followed in the top ten. Kyle Busch scraped <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> wall while driving up the track; he sustained minor damage and did not switch to a back-up car. Later that day, Kahne paced the final practice session with a time of 30.580 seconds; Edwards was second and Paul Menard third. Gordon was fourth-fastest, ahead of Hendrick Motorsports teammates Johnson and Earnhardt. Reutimann was seventh-fastest, Biffle eighth, Bowyer ninth, and Dave Blaney tenth. Bowyer moved to <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> of the track but was unable to steer left and hit <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> wall leaving turn-two and into the backstretch; he came down the track and Kyle Petty hit Bowyer and damaged his front-left fender before Bowyer's car stopped after he made contact with the inside wall. Bowyer was required to use a back-up car but Petty was able to repair his chassis.|$|E

5|$|A typical {{structure}} {{would have}} {{four or more}} central posts planted {{in the ground and}} connected at the top by cross beams. The smoke hole would be left open in the center. Around the central structure there was a larger ring of shorter posts, also connected by cross beams. Rafters radiated from the central cross beams to <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> cross beams, and then split planks or beams formed the slanting or vertical side walls.|$|E

5|$|After {{the final}} whistle, {{there was a}} pitch {{invasion}} by Celtic fans, which meant that the Celtic team could not be presented the trophy on the pitch. Some of the Celtic players also had their shirts taken by Celtic supporters. Celtic captain Billy McNeill had to be ushered around <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> of the stadium under armed guards to receive the trophy on a podium in the stand.|$|E
5|$|Albania still {{maintained}} some {{links with}} <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> world at this time, trading with neutral countries, such as Austria and Sweden, and establishing links across the Adriatic Sea with its former colonial power Italy. However, a modest relaxation of domestic controls was curtailed by Hoxha in 1973 with a renewed wave of repression and purges directed against individuals, {{the young and}} the military, whom he feared might threaten his hold on the country. A new constitution was introduced in 1976 that increased the Communist Party's control of the country, limited private property and forbade foreign loans. The country sank into a decade of paranoid isolation and economic stagnation, virtually cut off from <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> world.|$|E
5|$|All the {{buildings}} of the University in Sampaloc {{with the exception of}} the Seminary, the Printing Press and two first floors of Main Building were occupied. The war internees occupied three floors of the Main Building, the entire Education Building (presently UST Hospital), the Domestic Science building, and the School of Mines building. Communication between them and <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> world was prevented by the Japanese as much as possible.|$|E
