25|$|Like other lentiviruses, HIV-1 encodes a trans-activating {{regulatory}} protein (Tat), which {{is essential for}} efficient transcription of the viral genome. Tat acts by binding to an RNA stem-loop structure, the trans-activating response element (TAR), found at the 5′ ends of nascent HIV-1 transcripts. In binding <b>to</b> <b>TAR,</b> Tat alters {{the properties of the}} transcription complex, recruits the positive transcription elongation complex (P-TEFb) of cellular CDK9 and cyclin T1, and hence increases the production of full-length viral RNA.|$|E
25|$|In the 1840s the {{recently}} formed abolitionist Liberty Party attempted to attract Virginians to their cause and did draw some members from western Virginia. The advocacy of abolitionism however also brought about violent reactions from pro-slavery Virginians. From 1840 through the 1850s {{most of the}} notable mob actions against abolitionists in Virginia took place in western Virginia. In 1839 a mob from Guyandotte crossed the Ohio River and kidnapped a man in order <b>to</b> <b>tar</b> and feather him. In 1854 West Virginians again crossed the river to Quaker Bottom (now Proctorville) to beat abolitionists.|$|E
500|$|West of the river, Highway63 and its brief collector-distributor system curve {{north to}} follow the Athabasca's west bank toward Fort MacKay, passing the {{neighbourhood}} of Ross Haven en route to trumpet interchanges each at Thickwood Boulveard, Confederation Way, and Parsons Access Road, the last of which essentially marks the northern limit of Fort McMurray's residential development. [...] The divided highway continues north alongside the river through boreal forest <b>to</b> <b>Tar</b> Island where it bends slightly northwest. [...] The northbound and southbound lanes diverge as the highway passes between the Suncor Energy and Syncrude plants near Mildred Lake. [...] The two carriageways then rejoin and the highway becomes undivided, but [...] later a brief [...] divided section precedes a second crossing of the Athabasca River on the Peter Lougheed Bridge. [...] The Fort MacKay Road splits to the north from the divided section prior to the river, providing access to the community of Fort MacKay. [...] East of the river, Highway63 curves north along the east bank to a point approximately [...] north of Fort MacKay near the Fort MacKay/Albian Aerodrome, where the highway designation ends at an intersection with a dirt road. [...] The unnamed local paved road continues for another [...] before becoming gravel. [...] In the winter months, it carries on north to Fort Chipewyan on the western shore of Lake Athabasca as a winter road through the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo, paralleling the Athabasca River.|$|E

500|$|On December 16, 1972, the Portuguese 6th {{company of}} Commandos in Mozambique killed the {{inhabitants}} of the village of Wiriyamu, in the district of Tete. Referred to as the 'Wiriyamu Massacre', the soldiers killed between 150 (according to the Red Cross) and 300 (according to a much later investigation by the Portuguese newspaper Expresso based in testimonies from soldiers) villagers accused of sheltering FRELIMO guerrillas. The action, [...] "Operation Marosca", was planned at the instigation of PIDE/DGS agents and guided by agent Chico Kachavi, who was later assassinated while an inquiry into the events was being carried out. The soldiers were told by this agent that [...] "the orders were to kill them all", never mind that only civilians, women and children included, were found. All of the victims were civilians. The massacre was recounted in July 1973 by the British Catholic priest, Father Adrian Hastings, and two other Spanish missionary priests. Later counter-claims have been made in a report of Archbishop of Dar es Salaam Laurean Rugambwa that alleged that the killings were carried out by FRELIMO combatants, not Portuguese forces. In addition, others claimed that the alleged massacres by Portuguese military forces were fabricated <b>to</b> <b>tar</b> the reputation of the Portuguese state abroad. Portuguese journalist Felícia Cabrita reconstructed the Wiriyamu massacre in detail by interviewing both survivors and former members of the Portuguese Army Commandos unit that carried out the massacre. Cabrita's report was published in the Portuguese weekly newspaper Expresso and later in a book containing several of the journalist's articles.|$|E

Both the Conservative campaign and several Conservative-aligned newspapers sought <b>to</b> <b>tar</b> Khan as an apologist for, or even sympathiser with, Islamic extremism. Goldsmith's campaign material referred to Khan as [...] "radical and divisive", while comments on the Conservatives' Facebook campaign material often displayed anti-Muslim sentiment. Labour accused Goldsmith's campaign of using rhetoric that was a [...] "dog-whistle" [...] to Islamophobia, while the Conservatives responded that it was [...] "utterly predictable that Labour label their opponents as racists", citing the fact that during the 2008 mayoral campaign, the party had also accused Johnson of employing racist rhetoric.|$|E

2500|$|Many {{scholars}} have accused Eliade of [...] "essentialism", {{a type of}} over-generalization in which one incorrectly attributes a common [...] "essence" [...] to a whole group—in this case, all [...] "religious" [...] or [...] "traditional" [...] societies. Furthermore, some see a connection between Eliade's essentialism with regard to religion and fascist essentialism with regard to races and nations. To Ellwood, this connection [...] "seems rather tortured, in the end amounting {{to little more than}} an ad hominem argument which attempts <b>to</b> <b>tar</b> Eliade's entire [...] work with the ill-repute all decent people feel for storm troopers and the Iron Guard". However, Ellwood admits that common tendencies in [...] "mythological thinking" [...] may have caused Eliade, as well as Jung and Campbell, to view certain groups in an [...] "essentialist" [...] way, and that this may explain their purported antisemitism: [...] "A tendency to think in generic terms of peoples, races, religions, or parties, which as we shall see is undoubtedly the profoundest flaw in mythological thinking, including that of such modern mythologists as our three, can connect with nascent anti-Semitism, or the connection can be the other way." ...|$|E
