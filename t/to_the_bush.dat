5|$|Malcolm visits {{his parents}} and informs them that Catherine is pregnant. He asks Susan and Karl to {{relocate}} to England and help him and Catherine out with the baby. Susan and Karl reminisce about their time on Ramsay Street and they decide to stay. Susan counsels Nate through his PTS, but she is affected by Nate's stories and becomes depressed herself. She seeks professional counselling {{at the hospital and}} tries to find Nate a qualified counsellor. She notices that Nate's progress has suffered and follows him out <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bush</b> when he acts strangely. She falls in a hole he is digging as therapy and he nearly buries her alive, but sees her in time and rescues her. Susan falls out with Brad Willis (Kip Gamblin) when Karl accidentally drinks a chemical catalyst Brad was using in the Men's Shed. She questions Brad's commitment to teaching. Susan and Sheila are named judges for the Erinsborough Festival Bake-Off, but decide to enter the competition instead. They compete against Janelle Timmins (Nell Feeney), but after their bakes fall to the floor, Karl is declared the winner. After Karl learns Susan has a secret bank account, which contains her , she dares him to spend big and he buys into the Off Air bar.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, the Beti {{at large}} detested French forced labour {{practices}} and taxes. Some people fled <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bush</b> before the tax collector arrived; others circumvented taxes by counting wives as out-of-town visitors or {{waiting until the}} last minute to pay and thus reducing the collector's cut of the tax money. If the taxes were not collected to the satisfaction of the colonial administrators, Atangana himself was expected to make up some of the difference. To counter these minor rebellions, chiefs could punish their subjects with 15 days in jail or 100 franc fines without due process of law. This was meant to be reserved for only certain infractions, but Atangana and other chiefs interpreted it broadly to include all sorts of difficult behaviour. Atangana and his sub-chiefs were expected to discipline such difficult subjects. He exerted continual pressure on the sub-chiefs, who in turn placed constant pressure on the villagers to pay taxes and supply labourers.|$|E

50|$|There are {{two main}} types of glass fiber {{manufacture}} and two main types of glass fiber product. First, fiber is made either from a direct melt process or a marble remelt process. Both start with the raw materials in solid form. The materials are mixed together and melted in a furnace. Then, for the marble process, the molten material is sheared and rolled into marbles which are cooled and packaged. The marbles are taken <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fiber manufacturing facility where they are inserted into a can and remelted. The molten glass is extruded <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bushing</b> <b>to</b> be formed into fiber. In the direct melt process, the molten glass in the furnace goes directly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bushing</b> for formation.|$|R
5|$|Paul {{returns to}} Erinsborough and sets {{fire to the}} Lassiter's complex. He also kills Gus Cleary (Ben Barrack), when Gus catches him. Paul helps rebuild the complex and reclaims Lassiter's for himself. Paul has affairs with both Izzy Hoyland (Natalie Bassingthwaighte) and Liljana Bishop (Marcella Russo). He later frames Liljana's husband, David (Kevin Harrington) for fraud. Paul strikes a deal with Affirmacon to build on Ramsay Street and he gets his protégé Dylan Timmins (Damien Bodie) to pollute the local wetlands. When Paul wants {{to pull out of}} the deal, he is taken <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bush</b> and beaten up. Paul escapes and falls down a cliff, badly {{breaking}} his leg. While Paul recovers in hospital, his leg becomes infected and is amputated. Paul's sister, Lucy, encourages him to make a proper home for himself in Erinsborough and he moves into Number 22. Paul begins a relationship with Izzy and his estranged daughter Elle moves in. To celebrate the Lassiter's Hotel 20th anniversary, Paul and several of his neighbours go on a joy flight to Tasmania. During the flight, a bomb explodes causing the plane to crash into the sea. Paul, Izzy and Elle survive.|$|E
5|$|The New York Times {{supported}} the 2003 invasion of Iraq. On May 26, 2004, {{a year after}} the war started, the newspaper asserted that some of its articles had not been as rigorous as they should have been, and were insufficiently qualified, frequently overly dependent upon information from Iraqi exiles desiring regime change. Reporter Judith Miller retired after criticisms that her reporting of the lead-up to the Iraq War was factually inaccurate and overly favorable <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> administration's position, for which The New York Times later apologized. One of Miller's prime sources was Ahmed Chalabi, an Iraqi expatriate who returned to Iraq after the U.S. invasion and held a number of governmental positions culminating in acting oil minister and deputy prime minister from May 2005 until May 2006.|$|E
5|$|The Shangani Patrol {{continued}} its approach {{during the late}} evening, and scouted close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bush</b> enclosure housing Lobengula. Captain William Napier repeatedly called to the king in the Matabele language, Sindebele, but received no reply from the Matabele leaders, who remained silent and hid themselves. The patrol's actions confused the Matabele, who could not understand why {{there appeared to be}} so few Company soldiers, nor why they would reveal their position like this. They concluded that it must be a trap, and were only satisfied that it was not when Wilson's men had stopped during their approach to call to Lobengula five times. Following the fifth call from Napier, Mjaan ordered his riflemen to gather around the patrol, intending to pocket it. Noticing this, Wilson ordered a retreat, and took up a well-covered position in the bush where he could hide until daybreak. When Lieutenant Hofmeyer and Troopers Bradburn and Colquhoun were lost amid the increasingly stormy night, Wilson briefly backtracked to recover them.|$|E

40|$|Power {{transformer}} bushings {{are among}} the least reliable components in high voltage systems, therefore the knowledge of their wear condition {{is very important for}} a proper network management. The aim of this work is <b>to</b> study <b>the</b> limits of applicability of an on-line monitoring method for transformer bushings previously presented by the authors. <b>The</b> technique allows <b>to</b> continuously estimate <b>the</b> variation of <b>the</b> <b>bushing</b> capacitance and its dissipation factor, without requiring <b>to</b> disconnect <b>the</b> <b>bushing</b> itself from <b>the</b> network. The method is based on a high frequency impedance measurement at <b>the</b> <b>bushing</b> tap. It is clear that its value is not only related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bushing,</b> but it also depends on the other substation devices. For this reason, it is vital <b>to</b> discriminate <b>the</b> variations of <b>the</b> parameters due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bushing</b> from those due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rest of the components. In order to understand these dependencies and <b>to</b> evaluate <b>the</b> applicability of the monitoring method, a high-frequency equivalent model of the substation is required. In this work, a typical substation has been modeled considering a frequency around 1 MHz. Through proper simulations, the applicability of the method has been investigated, in particular the impact of the high voltage transmission lines has been studied...|$|R
