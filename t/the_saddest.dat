Famed sports author Pete Hamill mentioned that one of <b>the</b> <b>saddest</b> experiences of his life was watching Robinson lose to Archer. He was even knocked down and Hamill pointed out that Archer had no knockout punch at all; Archer admitted afterward {{that it was only}} the second time he had knocked an opponent down in his career. The crowd of 9,023 at the Civic Arena in Pittsburgh gave Robinson several standing ovations, even while he was being thoroughly outperformed by Archer.|$|E

Falcon Beach, an internationally broadcast television drama, was filmed at Winnipeg Beach, Manitoba.|$|E
5|$|In 1871, {{following}} Prussia's victories, the German {{states were}} united into the German Empire, with William as the Emperor and Frederick as heir-apparent {{to the new}} German monarchy. Although William thought {{the day when he}} became Emperor <b>the</b> <b>saddest</b> of his life, Frederick was excited to be witness to a great day in German history. Bismarck, now Chancellor, disliked Frederick and distrusted the liberal attitudes of the Crown Prince and Princess. Often at odds with his father's and Bismarck's policies and actions, Frederick sided with the country's liberals in their opposition to the expansion of the empire's army. The Crown Prince also became involved in many public works projects, such as the establishment of schools and churches in the area of Bornstedt near Potsdam. To assist his father's effort to turn Berlin, the capital city, into a great cultural centre, he was appointed Protector of Public Museums; it was largely due to Frederick that considerable artistic collections were acquired, housed in Berlin's new Kaiser Friedrich Museum (later known as the Bode Museum) after his death. In 1878, when his father was incapacitated by injury from an assassination attempt, Frederick briefly took over his tasks but was soon relegated to the sidelines once again. His lack of influence affected him deeply, even causing him to think about suicide.|$|E
40|$|A novel {{technique}} for localization of narrowband near-field sources is presented. The technique utilizes <b>the</b> sensor-angle distribution (<b>SAD)</b> that treats <b>the</b> source range and direction-of-arrival (DOA) information as sensor-dependent phase progression. <b>The</b> <b>SAD</b> draws parallel to quadratic time-frequency distributions and, as such, {{is able to}} reveal {{the changes in the}} spatial frequency over sensor positions. For a moderate source range, <b>the</b> <b>SAD</b> signature is of a polynomial shape, thus simplifying the parameter estimation. Both uniform and sparse linear arrays are considered in this work. To exploit the sparsity and continuity of <b>the</b> <b>SAD</b> signature in <b>the</b> joint space and spatial frequency domain, a modified Bayesian compressive sensing algorithm is exploited to estimate <b>the</b> <b>SAD</b> signature. In this method, a spike-and-slab prior is used to statistically encourage sparsity of <b>the</b> <b>SAD</b> across each segmented SAD region, and a patterned prior is imposed to enforce the continuous structure of <b>the</b> <b>SAD.</b> <b>The</b> results are then mapped back to source range and DOA estimation for source localization. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is verified using simulation results with uniform and sparse linear arrays where the array sensors are located on a grid but with consecutive and missing positions...|$|R
40|$|Behavioural finance {{argues that}} some market {{anomalies}} {{can be explained}} by assuming investors are not always fully rational. This thesis contributes a greater understanding of the relationship between investor mood and financial markets, through exploring the effect of seasonal affective disorder (SAD) on UK financial markets. Chapter 2, the first empirical chapter, investigates <b>the</b> <b>SAD</b> effect on UK stock portfolio returns, by employing daily returns of all stocks traded on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) from 1988 to 2011. <b>The</b> chapter constructs <b>SAD</b> variables and six stock portfolios to examine <b>the</b> <b>SAD</b> effect in different stock portfolios, with some well-known market anomalies and weather factors are considered. The estimation result supports the existence of <b>the</b> <b>SAD</b> effect in UK stock portfolio returns, and <b>the</b> <b>SAD</b> effect is more pronounced in small size stock portfolios. Chapter 3, explores <b>the</b> <b>SAD</b> effect on UK stock trading activities, by applying a variety of econometric techniques to ascertain whether SAD affects stock portfolio turnover. The analysis indicates the more people suffer from <b>SAD,</b> <b>the</b> less stock turnover, and <b>the</b> <b>SAD</b> effect is more influential on small size stock turnover. Chapter 4 turns to bond markets, aiming to ascertain <b>the</b> <b>SAD</b> effect on UK government bond returns. We study <b>the</b> relationship between <b>SAD</b> indicators and eight government bond returns, and a positive correlation between SAD indicators and government bond returns are uncovered. The result suggests that investors prefer investing in government bonds when suffering from SAD. Overall, this thesis demonstrates a clear and significant relationship between investor mood and UK financial markets, through exploring <b>the</b> <b>SAD</b> effect on stock and government bond markets. This thesis concludes that <b>the</b> onset of <b>SAD</b> leads to lower stock returns and turnover, and higher government bond returns; and that recovery from SAD leads to higher stock returns and turnover, and lower government bond returns...|$|R

25|$|Hook goes {{calling for}} Emma and {{stands on a}} rooftop to get attention. He jumps off, and Emma uses magic to take him safely to the ground, before asking {{why he was so}} sure she’d save him. He says he was optimistic, and then asks what {{happened}} between them in Camelot. He says he forgives her, but she says that she's the Dark One and forgiveness. Hook says there’s nothing she’s done could be as bad as what he’s done. He shows her a ring that belonged to Barnaby, and whom he killed front of his wife. He says that every ring he wears is a sad story. She shows him the ring he gave her to keep safe, and he says it was <b>the</b> <b>saddest</b> story of all; it belonged to a man better than him, his brother Liam. She tries to give it back but he tells her to keep it. He says he wore rings as trophies and now they’re just reminders. When Emma asks if Hook wants to know the truth, no matter how terrible, Hook says he loves her no matter what, and Emma says she needs to show him something. She takes him to her house and she points him to a telescope. He looks and sees the sea and a full moon over the waves. She says he told her the ocean calmed him and he says it’s a nice home she picked, but Emma says that he picked it, not her. He looks at the newspaper and recognized his handwriting on it. She says he told her this was their future and she says everything she did was to keep that future alive. He asks again for the truth and she says they’re almost there and kisses him. She says she can’t tell him everything because he would try and stop her. After the kiss, Hook gets groggy and asks what she's doing, before passing out.|$|E

500|$|Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly {{gave the}} album B−.

[...] Nevertheless, he praised the [...] "jaunty disco" [...] of [...] "Sorry for Love", and [...] "Have You Ever Been in Love" [...] which [...] "builds in {{intensity}} to sound like [...] "a James Bond movie theme as delivered by Barbra Streisand." [...] Tucker described [...] "Rain, Tax (It's Inevitable)" [...] as the most [...] "idiosyncratic" [...] and [...] "idiomatic" [...] song that Dion has ever recorded. According to the positive review from Mike Ross of Jam!, A New Day Has Come [...] "picks up where Falling into You left off." [...] Dion's album is a full of [...] "bombast, melodrama and soaring love ballads indistinguishable from anything she's ever done." [...] Attempts at modernity are [...] "spotty", though [...] "welcome". Ross noticed that ballads are the strongest tracks on the album and praised [...] "Goodbye's (<b>The</b> <b>Saddest</b> Word)", with [...] "two soaring key changes" [...] in the same song, which is then launched into a [...] "high Earth orbit of melodrama by an orchestra that would make John Williams blush with envy." [...] Barnes & Noble also gave the album favorable review and wrote that the new songs reveal a more [...] "spiritual" [...] and [...] "edgier" [...] Dion. They praised the [...] "uplifting" [...] title track, [...] "heartfelt, country-tinged" [...] "Goodbye's (<b>The</b> <b>Saddest</b> Word)", [...] "anthemic, gospel choir-accented ballad" [...] "Prayer", [...] "bluesy, honky-tonk rocker" [...] "Ten Days", [...] "soaring ballad" [...] "Have You Ever Been in Love", and [...] "solid renditions" [...] of [...] "Nature Boy" [...] and [...] "At Last".|$|E

[...] To Bathurst, however, [...] "it is tempting to see Stroma's abandonment as the result of some appalling trauma. Abandonment is always taken as a sign of failure, a collective death... But Stroma does not feel sad. True, there is sorrow in seeing the once meticulous vegetable patches turned over to weeds, or wondering how many more winters the box beds will stand before they start to rot. But that isn't the whole story. What is interesting about Stroma is not the fact of its abandonment, but the tale of its past." ...|$|E
