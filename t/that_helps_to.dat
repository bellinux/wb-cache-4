5|$|Computed tomography, {{also known}} as CT scanning, of a {{complete}} Majungasaurus skull (FMNH PR 2100) allowed a rough reconstruction of its brain and inner ear structure. Overall, the brain was very small relative to body size, but otherwise similar to many other non-coelurosaurian theropods, with a very conservative form closer to modern crocodilians than to birds. One difference between Majungasaurus and other theropods was its smaller flocculus, a region of the cerebellum <b>that</b> <b>helps</b> <b>to</b> coordinate movements of the eye with movements of the head. This suggests that Majungasaurus and other abelisaurids like Indosaurus, which also had a small flocculus, did not rely on quick head movements to sight and capture prey.|$|E
5|$|Gene therapy {{typically}} {{involves the}} use of a non-infectious virus (i.e., a viral vector such as the adeno-associated virus) to shuttle genetic material into a part of the brain. The gene used leads to the production of an enzyme <b>that</b> <b>helps</b> <b>to</b> manage PD symptoms or protects the brain from further damage. In 2010 there were four clinical trials using gene therapy in PD. There have not been important adverse effects in these trials although the clinical usefulness of gene therapy is still unknown. One of these reported positive results in 2011, but the company filed for bankruptcy in March 2012.|$|E

5|$|HIV is {{typically}} transmitted through unprotected sex or intravenous drug use, {{and is often}} associated with groups such as promiscuous gay men, illicit drug users, and sex workers. For these reasons, and also because of fears of contagion, people living with HIV are frequently subjected to stigma and discrimination. Publicity campaigns around the world have aimed to counter HIV-related prejudices and misconceptions and to replace them with an accurate understanding <b>that</b> <b>helps</b> <b>to</b> prevent new infections. These efforts have been aided by various celebrities – including American basketball star Magic Johnson and South African judge Edwin Cameron – who have publicly announced that they are HIV-positive.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, the US Food and Drug Administration {{approved}} the drug exenatide (marketed as Byetta) {{for the management}} of type 2 diabetes. It is a synthetic version of a protein, exendin-4, derived from the Gila monster's saliva. In a three-year study with people with type 2 diabetes, exenatide led to healthy sustained glucose levels and progressive weight loss. The effectiveness is because the lizard protein is about 50% identical to glucagon-like peptide-1 analog (GLP-1), a hormone released from the human digestive tract <b>that</b> <b>helps</b> <b>to</b> regulate insulin and glucagon. The lizard protein remains effective much longer than the human hormone, helping diabetics keep their blood sugar levels under control. Exenatide slows the emptying of the stomach and causes a decrease in appetite, contributing to weight loss.|$|E
5|$|State Route 149 (SR 149) {{is a short}} {{state highway}} <b>that</b> <b>helps</b> <b>to</b> connect Oroville and Chico through rural Butte County. Connecting State Route 70 at Wicks Corner with State Route 99 east of Durham, it forms part of the primary northsouth highway through the eastern Sacramento Valley, a Focus Route of the Interregional Road System. SR 149 was {{formerly}} part of the Oroville-Chico Highway; {{the majority of the}} latter was merged into other routes. In the mid-1970s, the highway was reallocated onto a newer two-lane alignment. A project to widen the two-lane road to a four-lane expressway was completed in late 2008, removing the bottleneck from the Oroville-Chico highway.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} the associations of popularity, substance use, athletic abilities, physical attractiveness, and physical and relational aggression with likeability by same-gender and cross-gender peers among early adolescents (N = 3, 312; M age = 13. 60, with 92. 7 % {{of the participants in}} the 12 - 14 age range). Data collection consisted of peer nominations in 172 classrooms of 34 secondary schools. Taking a goal-framing perspective, it was argued that key to understanding the association between popularity and likeability is the distinction between features <b>that</b> <b>help</b> <b>to</b> achieve popularity and features <b>that</b> <b>help</b> <b>to</b> maintain popularity. In support of our hypotheses, popularity and substance use, athletic abilities, and physical attractiveness (characteristics <b>that</b> <b>help</b> <b>to</b> become popular) contributed significantly to likeability, whereas physical and relational aggression (characteristics <b>that</b> <b>help</b> <b>to</b> maintain popularity) negatively predicted likeability. These specific nature of these effects depended on the reference group (same-gender vs. other-gender peers) and were further moderated by popularity. ...|$|R

25|$|A {{buffer strip}} {{is an area}} of land {{maintained}} in permanent vegetation <b>that</b> <b>helps</b> <b>to</b> control air, soil, and water quality, along with other environmental problems, dealing primarily on land that is used in agriculture. Buffer strips trap sediment, and enhance filtration of nutrients and pesticides by slowing down runoff that could enter the local surface waters. The root systems of the planted vegetation in these buffers hold soil particles together which alleviate the soil of wind erosion and stabilize stream banks providing protection against substantial erosion and landslides. Farmers can also use buffer strips to square up existing crop fields to provide safety for equipment while also farming more efficiently.|$|E
25|$|Ephaptic {{transmission}} is when two nerves {{communicate with each}} other via an artificial synapse between nerves. Healthy peripheral nerves are insulated with a myelin sheath <b>that</b> <b>helps</b> <b>to</b> both enhance electric transmission and to prevent cross-talk between parallel nerves. After a lesion, it has been observed that regenerating nerves might not be myelinated effectively. Consequently, the two nerve fibers can come into contact and provide a means for an impulse to be directly conducted through the nerve membrane. An analogy for this is having two uninsulated electrical wires placed adjacent to each other. Thus, the two nerves are able to “cross-talk” and send action potentials in both directions.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the healthiest}} {{behaviors}} displayed by resilient {{families in the}} wake of a death is honest and open communication. This facilitates an understanding of the crisis. Sharing the experience of the death can promote immediate and long-term adaptation to the recent loss of a loved one. Empathy is a crucial component in resilience because it allows mourners to understand other positions, tolerate conflict, and be ready to grapple with differences that may arise. Another crucial component to resilience is the maintenance of a routine <b>that</b> <b>helps</b> <b>to</b> bind the family together through regular contact and order. The continuation of education and a connection with peers and teachers at school is an important support for children struggling with the death of a family member.|$|E

25|$|Bayesian {{decision}} analysis {{can also be}} applied to the channel selection process. In order to help provide further information the method can be used that produces results in a profit or loss aspect. Prior information can include costs, expected profit, training expenses and any other costs relevant to the decision as well as managerial experience which can be displayed in a normal distribution. Bayesian decision making under uncertainty lets a marketing manager assess his/her options for channel logistics by computing the most profitable method choice. A number of different costs can be entered into the model <b>that</b> <b>helps</b> <b>to</b> assess the ramifications of change in distribution method.
