5|$|<b>The</b> <b>sandwich</b> {{was first}} {{created in the}} early twentieth century after {{marshmallow}} creme, a sweet marshmallow-like spread, was invented in Massachusetts. During World War I, a recipe for a peanut butter and marshmallow creme sandwich, the earliest known example of <b>the</b> <b>sandwich,</b> was published. The term “fluffernutter” was created by an advertising agency in 1960 as a more effective way to market <b>the</b> <b>sandwich.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{the initial}} testing period, <b>the</b> <b>sandwich</b> was renamed the Big King {{and added to}} the {{national}} menu {{at the end of}} the summer of 1997the first major product introduction since the company added its BK Broiler chicken sandwich in 1990. Unlike the Double Supreme, the new Big King lacked the interior bread piece the Big Mac had, and the advertising used to promote the Big King continued to utilize the 75% more beef claim. However, the new sandwich was introduced while the company was dealing with a highly publicized beef recall from one of its key suppliers, Hudson Foods, and had to deal with accusations that the introduction was designed to distract the public and media from the recall. <b>The</b> <b>sandwich</b> was initially introduced in the United States at a 99¢ (USD) price point, which helped propel sales to nearly twice the estimated volume and causing many locations to sell out of the burger patties used to produce <b>the</b> <b>sandwich.</b>|$|E

40|$|Solutions of the boundary-value {{problem for}} {{electromagnetic}} waves {{guided by a}} layer of a homogeneous and isotropic (metal or dielectric) material sandwiched between a structurally chiral material (SCM) and a periodically multilayered isotropic dielectric (PMLID) material were numerically obtained and analyzed. If <b>the</b> <b>sandwiched</b> layer is sufficiently thick, the two bimaterial interfaces decouple from each other, and each interface may guide one or more electromagnetic surface waves (ESWs) by itself. Depending on {{the constitution of the}} two materials that partner to form an interface, the ESWs can be classified as surface-plasmon-polariton waves, Tamm waves, Dyakonov–Tamm waves, or Uller–Zenneck waves. When <b>the</b> <b>sandwiched</b> layer is sufficiently thin, the ESWs for single bimaterial interfaces coalesce to form compound guided waves (CGWs). The phase speeds, propagation distances, and spatial profiles of the electromagnetic fields of CGWs are {{different from those of the}} ESWs. The energy of a CGW is distributed in both the SCM and the PMLID material, if <b>the</b> <b>sandwiched</b> layer is sufficiently thin. Some CGWs require <b>the</b> <b>sandwiched</b> layer to have a minimum thickness. Indeed, the coupling between the two faces of <b>the</b> <b>sandwiched</b> layer is affected by the ratio of the thickness of <b>the</b> <b>sandwiched</b> layer to <b>the</b> skin depth in that material and the rates at which the fields of the ESWs guided individually by the two interfaces decay away from their respective guiding interfaces...|$|R

40|$|In this article, <b>the</b> <b>sandwiching</b> method, a novel, simple, and {{cost-effective}} capillary electrophoresis (CE) chip fabrication approach, is proposed. In this new approach, polymer PET-laminated film {{rather than the}} commonly used silicon wafer is chosen to be the material of the chip; a micro CNC machining center is adopted to cut the microchannels; and a temperature-controlled roll laminator is used to bond the microchannels in between two sealing PET films. Separation experiments using red Rhodamine B and blue Xylene Cyanole illustrate that the separation efficiency of <b>the</b> <b>sandwiching</b> CE chip {{is comparable to the}} semiconductor-based chip and the conventional capillary. However, <b>the</b> <b>sandwiching</b> method requires much less complicated fabrication processes and is more cost-effective...|$|R

5|$|Burger King's first broiled chicken {{sandwich}} {{was introduced}} in 1990 and was called the BK Broiler. This sandwich was made with lettuce, tomato and a dill ranch sauce served on an oat dusted roll. The product {{came at a time}} of fundamental change in terms of chicken product in the restaurant industry; more than 90% of chicken products sold by the major chains were fried. Shortly after its introduction, <b>the</b> <b>sandwich</b> was selling more than a million units per day, and poaching sales from traditional fried chicken chains such as Kentucky Fried Chicken. Additionally, the sandwiches were part of an industry trend towards the diversification of menus with healthier products such as reformulated cooking methods and salads.

According to The Life and Cuisine of Elvis Presley, it was the focus of a midnight sandwich run by Elvis Presley and his friends. Taking his private jet from Graceland, Presley and his friends purchased 30 of the sandwiches and spent two hours eating them and drinking Perrier and champagne before flying home. The story became legend and <b>the</b> <b>sandwich</b> became the subject of continued media interest and part of numerous cookbooks, typically focused around Presley's love of food.|$|E

5|$|Introduced as {{a direct}} {{challenge}} of corporate rival McDonald's, the Big King was Burger King's response to the Big Mac and had a similar style and taste. <b>The</b> <b>sandwich</b> was originally introduced in 1993 under the name Double Supreme during its testing stage. The name was switched to Big King when it was introduced nationally in 1997, and again to the King Supreme when reintroduced in 2002. <b>The</b> <b>sandwich</b> was discontinued in the North American market in the mid-2000s. In November 2013, Burger King brought the Big King back to the North American market as a permanent menu item. The Big King sandwich's recipe {{is exactly the same}} as the original 1990s recipe, including a three-piece roll. The Big King sandwich is also sold in many of the company's international markets in several forms.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, sugar {{shortages}} during World War I hurt {{sales of}} Archibald Query's Marshmallow Creme, so Query sold his recipe in 1920 to two men from Swampscott, Massachusetts, H. Allen Durkee and Fred L. Mower, who began distributing the product through their company, Durkee-Mower Inc. The pair renamed the product Toot Sweet Marshmallow Fluff, and Durkee-Mower continues {{to sell the}} product under the name Marshmallow Fluff. <b>The</b> <b>sandwich</b> made with peanut butter and marshmallow fluff continued to be eaten, but was not called a Fluffernutter until 1960, when an advertising firm Durkee-Mower hired created the term as a more effective way to market <b>the</b> <b>sandwich.</b> Fluffernutter is a registered trademark of Durkee-Mower, although the company's U.S. trademark registrations for the term cover only ice cream and printed recipes. In 2006, Durkee-Mower sued Williams-Sonoma Inc. in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, alleging that Williams-Sonoma infringed on its trademark by selling a marshmallow and peanut butter chocolate-covered candy under the Fluffernutter name.|$|E

5|$|The company {{introduced}} its first broiled chicken sandwich, the BK Broiler, in 1990. <b>The</b> <b>sandwich</b> included a dill-ranch mayonnaise and was {{served on a}}n oat-bran roll. In 1998, BK reformulated the BK Broiler into a larger, more male-oriented sandwich: a larger chicken patty with mayonnaise served on a Whopper bun. In 2002, BK changed the name of <b>the</b> <b>sandwich</b> to Chicken Whopper and added a smaller Chicken Whopper Jr. sandwich. The company replaced the Chicken Whopper line with another broiled sandwich line in 2003, the BK Baguette line. The chicken sandwich, served on a fresh cooked baguette roll, and came in several varieties, {{all of which were}} topped with a series of ingredients that were low in fat. They were sold in the United States at one time, but are now sold only in the European market. The failed Baguette line was replaced in North America with the current grilled chicken iteration, the TenderGrill sandwich.|$|E
5|$|The {{packaging}} {{has undergone}} many changes since its inception.

To cut back on the amount of paper that the company used, the paperboard box was fully eliminated in 1991 and was replaced with waxed paper. For a short time in 2002, the company used a gold-toned, aluminum foil wrapping for <b>the</b> <b>sandwich</b> as part of the 45th anniversary of <b>the</b> <b>sandwich.</b> The packaging was changed again in 2012 when the company moved to half wrapped sandwich packaged in a paper board box.|$|E
5|$|Despite being off {{the menu}} in the United States for several years, {{the product was}} still sold in several other {{countries}} under several names during the interim of its unavailability in the United States.
