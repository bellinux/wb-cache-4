500|$|On 16 February 2010, Oasis won {{the award}} for Best Brit Album of the Last 30 Years at the 2010 Brit Awards. Liam Gallagher {{collected}} the award alone before presenting his speech, which thanked Bonehead, McGuigan and Alan White but not his brother, Noel. Liam threw his microphone and the band's award into the crowd. On 15 March 2010, Liam defended his actions at the awards ceremony, saying [...] "I'm sick of it all being about me and Noel, <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>months</b> has pretty much been all about me and him so I thought it was only right to mention the other lads who played on the album and the best fans in the world," [...] and [...] "I {{thought it was a}} nice gesture to give this to the fans, obviously it was misinterpreted as per usual." [...] about throwing the award.|$|E
500|$|Howe {{was opposed}} in his riding by CCF {{candidate}} Doug Fisher, a {{local high school}} teacher. Fisher's campaign was well financed, with support from his party, the unions, {{and a number of}} corporate enemies Howe had made over the years. Fisher was able to buy up the key time on the local television station—Howe initially scheduled no television appearances. The voters of Port Arthur saw Fisher on television every night, explaining why the Liberals had gone wrong in his view, and what his party proposed to do to correct matters. Called back to his riding after the remainder of his disastrous Prairie tour was canceled, Howe found that Fisher's appeals had caused defections among Liberals. Howe managed to get TV time just before the election and according to Bothwell and Kilbourn [...] "treated his viewers to the sight of a tired, harsh old man, telling them that the nice young fellow that they had been seeing on television for <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>months</b> was, if not a communist himself, then associated with the communists. No one believed him." [...] Fisher defeated Howe by over a thousand votes. Howe was gracious in defeat, shaking Fisher's hand at the television station, and assuring the member-elect's mother, long a Howe admirer, that there were many things for him to do. [...] Howe's defeat came as the Liberals still led narrowly in the reported returns. The Tories forged ahead, and took the greater number of seats, 112 to 105. [...] St. Laurent could have remained in office until Diefenbaker and the Tories defeated him in the House, but chose not to—a course with which Howe agreed. The Liberals left office on 21 June 1957, with Howe the only remaining minister of those sworn in with Mackenzie King in 1935.|$|E
2500|$|Struggling with {{clinical}} depression throughout his career, Rypien's mental health was eventually made {{known to the}} Vancouver Canucks organization during their 2008 training camp; the team consequently coordinated his treatment {{for the remainder of}} his tenure with the team. Among his teammates, Canucks defenceman Kevin Bieksa was the first Rypien confided in regarding his depression. During his first leave of absence in 2008–09, Rypien disappeared. Bieksa met with Manitoba Moose general manager Craig Heisinger, with whom Rypien had a close personal relationship, in Edmonton and drove to Rypien's Alberta home in search of him. Upon finding Rypien, Bieksa brought him back to Vancouver to live with his family. When Rypien returned from his leave, he was assigned by the Canucks to the Manitoba Moose. Upon arriving in Winnipeg, he publicly spoke about his absence, commenting that [...] "doing the work I've done <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>months</b> I've made a lot of gains as a person." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 8 July 2008, the U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice {{before her}} arrival in Tbilisi said that {{granting}} NATO Membership Action Plan to Georgia would help resolve the Abkhaz and South Ossetian problems. The statement caused a negative outcry in Moscow: the Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov responded, during {{his meeting with}} the de facto Abkhaz president Sergei Bagapsh, that Georgia's NATO integration process [...] "may undermine the conflict resolution" [...] process. Rice arrived in Georgia on 9 July. [...] "Frankly, {{some of the things}} that Russia did over <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>months</b> added to tensions in the region," [...] she said in Tbilisi. [...] "Georgia is an independent state. It has to be treated like one. We have said that both Georgia and Russia need to avoid provocative behavior." [...] On 11 July 2008 Deputy Foreign Minister Grigol Vashadze called for an urgent UN Security Council meeting on the conflict zones. The U.N. Security Council discussed the overflights at a closed meeting on 21 July, however no decision was reached. Russian envoy Vitaliy Churkin denounced the [...] "pro-Georgian bias" [...] of some Security Council members.|$|E
2500|$|The fishermen's prayers {{may have}} been {{answered}} in 1989, as a record tuna catch brought an infusion of prosperity to San Pedro's fishermen and also to Mary Star of the Sea. [...] The catch that year included 767 of the biggest Pacific blue fin tuna ever taken by a commercial fishing fleet, each fish weighing 300 to 1,000 pounds—a size never seen or caught before. [...] The giant tuna generated [...] "the biggest excitement in years for San Pedro's fishing fleet." [...] One San Pedro fisherman referred to the unusual catch as [...] "God's gift to the San Pedro fishermen," [...] and another called it [...] "a miracle." [...] At the time, the Los Angeles Times did a feature article on the giant fish, focusing on the tight relationship between the fishermen and Mary Star of the Sea. [...] The article noted that the fishermen and cannery workers of San Pedro had provided most of the funding to build the new Mary Star of the Sea Catholic Church in the 1950s. [...] Msgr. Gallagher, interviewed by the Times, noted that the church, too, had benefited from the fishermen's good fortune: [...] "Our collections <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>months</b> are noticeably higher than usual. I think you can thank those big fish." ...|$|E
2500|$|The second {{match of}} the night {{featured}} no active storylines between the members of each team, although tecnico Dr. Wagner Jr. and rudo L.A. Park had a long running on-again-off-again storyline that actually continued for years after the Sin Pidad event. Dr. Wagner Jr. would team up with Dos Caras Jr. and Rey Bucanero to take on L.A. Park and Los Guerreros del Infierno representatives Eclipse and Olímpico in a traditional Six-man [...] "Lucha Libre rules" [...] tag team match. The driving storyline behind the second match centered around the CMLL World Women's Championship that had seen champion Hiroka wart off challenger Dark Angel's advances several times over <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>months.</b> Curiously the match did not include Lady Apache who had already been announced as challenging for the title only 10 days after Sin Piedad. The rudo champion Hiroka would team up with La Amapola and the masked Princesa Sujei to take on Dark Angel, Marcela, and Sahori in the second match {{of the night}}. The opening match of the show featured the Arena México debut of Flash as he teamed up with fellow tecnico and Super Nova to face the tag team of Artillero and Súper Comando, collectively known as Los Hombres del Camoflaje ("Men in Camouflage). For CMLL wrestlers working in Arena Mexico means that {{they are working on}} at the highest level of CMLL, especially if they work on Friday nights, where CMLL holds their most important shows CMLL Super Viernes or their major annual shows. The Sin Piedad show would be Flash's first opportunity to showcase his wrestling skills in front of CMLL's [...] "hometown crowd".|$|E
