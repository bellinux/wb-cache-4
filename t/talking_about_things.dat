500|$|He {{frequently}} {{tells the}} press that [...] "My music is not Christian, Lecrae is." [...] He told Miami New Timess Crossfade that [...] "I think Christian is a wonderful noun, but a terrible adjective. Are there Christian shoes, Christian clothes, Christian plumbers, Christian pipes? I think if you're going to, you should label it hip-hop... hip-hop is a particular poetic style. Labeling it with the faith assumes that the song {{is going to be}} some kind of sermon, but there's a lot of social and political things that I don't think make it gospel or Christian music." [...] He also stated, [...] "I like to wrap my mind around a total situation. I'm a social anthropologist. If I never been homeless, let me try to be homeless for a week and soak up that information. More like a method actor. So for me it's spending time with people and <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>things</b> from their perspective." ...|$|E
