5|$|Smart's {{two most}} widely known works are A Song <b>to</b> <b>David</b> and Jubilate Agno, both {{at least partly}} written during his {{confinement}} in asylum. However, Jubilate Agno was not published until 1939 and A Song <b>to</b> <b>David</b> received mixed reviews until the 19th century. To his contemporaries, Smart was known mainly for his many contributions in the journals The Midwife and The Student, along with his famous Seaton Prize poems and his mock epic The Hilliad. Although he is primarily recognised as a religious poet, his poetry includes various other themes, such as his theories on nature and his promotion of English nationalism.|$|E
5|$|According <b>to</b> <b>David</b> A. Norris, {{a scholar}} specializing in Serbian {{cultural}} history, conditions in 19th-century Serbia were unsuitable {{for the development}} of visual art. Materials were difficult to come by, studio and exhibition spaces were virtually non-existent, and there were no art patrons willing to financially support painters and purchase their finished works. In {{the first half of the}} 19th century, Serbian visual artists dedicated themselves almost exclusively to decorating the walls of churches and producing icons and other religious objects. There were some painters of Serb heritage living outside Serbia, such as Uroš Knežević and Jovan Popović, who resided in the Austrian Empire.|$|E

5|$|According <b>to</b> <b>David</b> Potter, Vaballathus {{inherited}} his father's exact titles. Hartmann {{points that}} there have been cases where a Greek word was translated directly to Palmyrene and a Palmyrene equivalent was also used to mean the same thing. The dedication to Odaenathus would be the using of a Palmyrene equivalent, while the inscription of Vaballathus would be the direct translation. Despite all the arguments, it cannot be certain without doubt that Odaenathus was a corrector.|$|E
5|$|According <b>to</b> <b>David</b> White, Yoga Yajnavalkya {{was more}} {{significant}} in practice than the Patanjali's Yogasutras before the 12th century. Among the texts on asanas and meditation, it dominated the Indian yoga scene. Along with texts such as Yoga Vasistha, chapters embedded inside the Hindu epic the Mahabharata and literature related to traditions such as Hatha Yoga, Pashupata Yoga and Tantric Yoga, the Yoga Yajnavalkya was historically influential in Indian spiritual traditions.|$|E

Affeldt attended Northwest Christian High School, a Division 2-B school in Colbert, Washington. He participated in three sports while there, but it was baseball that drove several major league scouts to the school to see him pitch. He graduated in 1997.|$|E

5|$|After A Song <b>to</b> <b>David,</b> {{he tried}} to publish a {{collection}} of his Psalms translations, and Newbery sought to ruin him by hiring James Merrick to produce his own translations. Newbery then hired Smart's new publisher, James Fletcher, which in turn forced Smart {{to find a new}} publisher, delaying the printing of his Psalms. Finally, on 12 August 1765, he printed A Translation of the Psalms of David, which included Hymns and Spiritual Songs and a second edition of A Song <b>to</b> <b>David.</b> This work was criticised by Tobias Smollett who was working with Newbery at the time, and Newbery's edition by Merrick was constantly compared with Smart's. However, modern criticism has received Smart's version in a more favourable light. While working on this project, he was also working on a translation of the Phaedrus and a verse translation of Horace. His verse Horace was published in July 1767 including a preface in which he attacked Newbery, but the attack was in vain because Newbery died soon after.|$|E

David calls a meeting with Charles and Jim (John Krasinski), but Charles insists Dwight (Rainn Wilson) also be present because he had been Charles's right-hand man. However, during the meeting Dwight embarrasses Charles with outlandish suggestions, such as unleashing a hive of bees.|$|E

5|$|Between the 4th and 12th centuries, {{seven or}} more correctors {{worked on this}} codex, {{making it one of}} the most {{corrected}} manuscripts in existence. Tischendorf during his investigation in Petersburg enumerated 14,800 corrections only in the portion which was held in Petersburg (2/3 of the codex). According <b>to</b> <b>David</b> C. Parker the full codex has about 23,000 corrections. In addition to these corrections some letters were marked by dots as doubtful (e.g. ṪḢ). Corrections represent the Byzantine text-type, just like corrections in codices: Bodmer II, Regius (L), Ephraemi (C), and Sangallensis (Δ). They were discovered by E.A. Button.|$|E
