500|$|The {{final cut}} of [...] "Cog" [...] {{consists}} of two continuous sixty-second dolly shots taken from a technocrane, stitched together [...] later in post-production. (The stitching appears during {{the moment when the}} muffler rolls across the floor.) Four days of filming were required to get these two shots, two days for each minute-long section. Filming sessions lasted seven hours and the work was exacting, as some parts needed to be positioned with an accuracy of a sixteenth of an inch. Despite the detailed instructions derived from the testing period, small variations in ambient temperature, humidity and settling dust continually threw off the movement of the parts enough to end the sequence early. It took 90 minutes on the first day just to get the initial <b>transmission</b> <b>bearing</b> to roll correctly into the second. Between testing and filming, 606takes were needed to capture the final cut. The team commandeered two of Honda's six hand-assembled Accords—one to roll off the trailer {{at the end of the}} advertisement, the other to be stripped for parts. While several sections of the early scripts had to be abandoned due to the total unavailability of certain Accord components, by the time production finished the accumulated spare parts filled two articulated lorries.|$|E

However, with just eight miles left to go, he coasted into the pits with a <b>transmission</b> <b>bearing</b> failure. The car was refurbished and entered by STP in the 1968 Indianapolis 500.

50|$|The 51st International 500 Mile Sweepstakes {{was held}} at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Speedway, Indiana, over two days, Tuesday May 30 and Wednesday May 31, 1967.

With three laps to go, however, Jones coasted to a stop when a $6 <b>transmission</b> <b>bearing</b> failed. A. J.

At this point, Parnelli Jones seemingly has the race wrapped up, holding nearly a full lap lead over second place A. J. Foyt. Third place Al Unser is more than two laps down. Shockingly, with only four laps to go, a $6 <b>transmission</b> <b>bearing</b> failed, and the Turbine quietly coasted to a stop {{near the entrance to}} pit lane.

During starting as water level is below line shaft bearing it requires prepublication before start. Selection of the bearing material becomes critical {{in situations where}} we don’t have pre lubrication water available. Also remote start and stop is difficult. In this scenario pump runs dry during initial start. Our aim is to develop bearing which {{will take care of}} dry running. When pumped water is sea water / raw water containing sand/abrasive particles then line shaft sleeve bearing should withstand against wear. To cater the problems in conventional bearings and to find the appropriate bearing material focus is given on latest trends & Tribological developments in the world. Different PTFE based composite bearing. In this study, composite materials were comparatively investigated under actual load and sliding velocities by using in a Pump. The influence of inorganic fillers MoS 2, on the wear of the glass & bronze fabric reinforced epoxy composites under dry & wet running conditions has been checked.

Component life {{is a function of the}} ratio of elastohydrodynamic film thickness to composite surface roughness.

Based on a multi-degree-of-freedom dynamic analysis, a predefined three-dimensional model of the bearing is used in a frequency domain synthesis with analytical and experimental modal analyses and FEM updating in order to obtain the system 2 ̆ 7 s overall dynamic properties. Such an approach separates the model of the bearing and its investigation from the remaining linear part of the whole system, which speeds up the computation andbroadens the investigationćs capabilities.

Even though the car lacked handling, it almost won the 1967 Indy 500 until it broke down with eight miles to go. The problem was caused by a <b>transmission</b> <b>bearing.</b> In 1968, the Turbine crashed into the wall during qualifying at Indy. Today the Granatelli Turbine is now a museum gem of Indy's two brief years of turbine power. This also marks the first Indy race to not feature a front-engine roadster.|$|E

While he first gained notoriety by re-introducing the legendary Novi, his most famous entries were his turbine-powered cars in 1967 and 1968. In both years, he endured the excruciating frustration of seeing probable race-winners fail near the end; Joe Leonard's breakdown in the Lotus 56 with 10 laps remaining in 1968 had been topped the previous year when Parnelli Jones, leading comfortably with just three laps to go, suffered {{the failure of a}} six dollar <b>transmission</b> <b>bearing</b> in the STP-Paxton Turbocar and retired, handing a sure victory to A.

50|$|Between 1967 and 1971, Pratt & Whitney {{turbine engines}} {{were used in}} American Championship Car Racing and Formula One.

One car crashed during qualifying. Two of the remaining cars qualified fastest and second fastest, but all three retired from the race. Turbine cars were deemed illegal before the following year's race, so Lotus chief Colin Chapman developed the car for use in Formula One and an updated 56B competed in half a dozen Formula One races in 1971.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} reduce costly downtime, {{adequate}} condition monitoring of the automatic transmission components in heavy duty construction equipment is necessary. The transmission in such equipment enables to change the gear ratio automatically. Further, the bearings in an automatic transmission provide low friction support to its rotating parts and act as an interface separating stationary from rotating components. Wear or other bearing faults may {{lead to an increase}} in energy consumption as well as failure of other related components in the automatic transmission, and thus costly downtime. In this study, different sensor data (particularly vibration) was collected on the automatic transmission during controlled test cycles in an automatic transmission test rig to enable adequate condition monitoring. An analysis of the measured vibration data was carried out using signal processing methods. The results indicate that predictive maintenance information related to the automatic <b>transmission</b> <b>bearings</b> may be extracted from vibrations measured on an automatic transmission. This information may be used for early fault detection, thus improving uptime and availability of heavy duty construction equipment...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{present study}} aims {{to present the}} main {{concepts}} of the sugarcane straw to energy planning. Throughout the study, the subject is contextualized highlighting broader aspects of sustainability, which is considered the main driver towards agro-energy modernization. Concerning sugarcane straw, we first evaluated its availability regarding technical and economic aspects, and then it summarized the straw production chain for energy supply purposes. As a proposal to support agro-energy planning, it is presented some spatial tools that have been barely used in the Brazilian energy planning context so far. Therefore, working on straw to electricity associated with supply chain basis, we developed a conceptual model to spatially assess this bioenergy system. Using the model proposed, it is described the whole supply chain at state level, which accounted the potential of a single mill to explore straw, as well as main costs associated with straw acquisition, investments on the straw recovery routes and electricity <b>transmission.</b> <b>Bearing</b> these concepts in mind, it is fully believed that spatial analysis can bring important information for agro-energy action plans...|$|E

40|$|The NR 20 Receiver is an instantaneous, all-round-looking, {{wide band}} SH/F D/F set {{designed}} {{to indicate the}} <b>bearings</b> of pulse <b>transmissions.</b> <b>Bearings</b> are shown unambiguously as radial lines on a cathode-ray tube. The frequency range covered by the present model is approximately 8, 000 to 11, 500 Mc (2. 6 to 3. 75 cm.), with somewhat degraded performance at the extremes of the band. The equipment is intended for installation either on shipboard or on an aircraft.

It {{should be noted that the}} present antenna system is capable of receiving signals polarized in only the horizontal plane. For other polarlizations different antennas will be required. The principal advantage of a direction finder of this type is that it provides a probability of intercept of approximately unity for signals within the useful range.
