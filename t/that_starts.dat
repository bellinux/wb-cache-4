5|$|This section {{establishes}} the fact that, although recipients may receive various federal awards during their lifespan, the individual federal grants are awarded for a specified time period, usually one year. Federal regulations prohibit {{the use of}} funds from a grant award outside its specified time frame unless authorized by a federal agency, and auditors should verify that the recipient expends its grant during that time only. For example, a surplus from a federal award <b>that</b> <b>starts</b> on January 1, 2006 and ends on December 31, 2006 cannot be used after December 31, because its lifespan has terminated. This surplus must {{be returned to the}} federal agency unless otherwise authorized.|$|E

5|$|Apart {{from the}} stable isotopes, {{which make up}} almost all lead that exists naturally, there are trace {{quantities}} of a few radioactive isotopes. One of them is lead-210; although it has a half-life of only 22.3 years, small quantities occur in nature because lead-210 is produced by a long decay series <b>that</b> <b>starts</b> with uranium-238 (which has been present for billions of years on Earth). Lead-211, -212, and -214 {{are present in the}} decay chains of uranium-235, thorium-232, and uranium-238, respectively, so traces of all three of these lead isotopes are found naturally. Minute traces of lead-209 arise from the very rare cluster decay of radium-223, one of the daughter products of natural uranium-235. Lead-210 is particularly useful for helping to identify the ages of samples by measuring its ratio to lead-206 (both isotopes are present in a single decay chain).|$|E
5|$|M-149 is a rural two-lane highway <b>that</b> <b>starts</b> in the {{community}} of Thompson southwest of Manistique on Lake Michigan. It runs west-northwesterly through woodlands away from a junction with US2 along a small pond in the area. The road curves to the north and passes the cemetery and some small farms south of a crossing with a line of the Canadian National Railway. North of the tracks, the road meets County Road 442 (CR442) near Indian Lake. M-149 turns to the west at that junction while CR442 runs easterly to connect to the main unit of the Indian Lake State Park. The highway continues to a junction with CR455, which connects to the western unit of the state part, after which the trunkline turns to the northwest through forested terrain. The highway turns back to the west before intersecting another CR442 in the area. At this junction, M-149 turns to the north where it continues for several miles until curving eastward. M-149 intersects the northern end of CR455 and turns north once again until it terminates at the main gate to the Palms Book State Park, home of Kitch-iti-kipi (the Big Spring).|$|E
5|$|Mysteries of Westgate is a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} {{that is based}} on the fantasy role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons, and uses the d20 System rules, which are based on determining the results of most tasks, such as attacks, by performing the equivalent of rolling a 20-sided die. The player begins the game by either importing their character from Neverwinter Nights 2 or creating a new one <b>that</b> <b>starts</b> at character level 8. Each character has a race (such as human or elf) and a class (such as fighter or wizard), which determine the character's main abilities. Mysteries of Westgate has gameplay similar to the original Neverwinter Nights 2 and uses the same systems for gameplay elements, such as character levels, combat, and magic. The gameplay takes place primarily from an overhead perspective in a three-dimensional environment. The player moves and commands characters with the mouse.|$|E

Four developmental trajectories were identified: (a) nondisengaged group <b>that</b> <b>started</b> with initially low levels followed by an important decline, (b) normative group <b>that</b> <b>started</b> with initially moderate levels followed by a decline, (c) later desister group <b>that</b> <b>started</b> with initially high-medium levels followed by an increase from 14 to 16 years and an even steeper decline from 16 to 20 years, and (d) chronic group <b>that</b> <b>started</b> with and maintained medium-high levels.

Forts 5 and 6 occupy the upper slopes of the mountain and offer panoramic views of Lake Songkhla and the Gulf of Thailand. The two pagodas on the summit of Khao Daeng were built on the base of fort 10 during the 1830s to commemorate the suppression of rebellions in Kedah.|$|E
5|$|The North Norfolk Coast Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) is {{an internationally}} {{important}} protected area in Norfolk, England.

The mountain can also be accessed via another unpaved road that begins in the Scott's Bottom Nature Area in Green River, Wyoming. The peak is accessible year-round, weather permitting. The Green River access road is in worse shape than the Rock Springs side, and it has several road hazards such as steep grades, poor grading, and off-road vehicle traffic. Along with serving radio needs, the peak also is a popular hiking and mountain biking location in the area. There are many smaller roads and trails that spring from the peak that offer varied degrees of challenge.|$|E
5|$|You Don't Know Jack {{is played}} {{out as a}} fictional trivia game show for one to four players, with the goal to win the most virtual money {{at the end of}} the game. Each game uses a pre-defined set of ten {{questions}} from over seventy episodes, titled by the name of the show's fictional sponsor. Most questions are multiple choice, providing one correct and three incorrect answers, along with a short timer <b>that</b> <b>starts</b> once the question has been completely presented. All players play at the same time, entering their choice of answer before the 20 second timer runs out. If a player is correct, they get a base dollar amount plus a bonus defined by how quickly they answered, while if they miss the question, they lose a similar amount of money. Failing to answer does not cost the player any money.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the regular}} season games {{resulted}} in a tie, which is unusual in baseball given the provision in {{the rules of the game}} to play extra innings to determine a winner. The game between the Sydney Blue Sox and the Melbourne Aces at Blacktown Olympic Park was the second game of a makeup doubleheader as a result of rain earlier that weekend washing out two games, and so had been shortened to seven innings. A rain delay during the first game of the day forced the second game to a later start. Under a provision in the ABL rules that is modeled on the International Baseball Federation's tiebreaker rule, in any extra inning <b>that</b> <b>starts</b> within an hour of the curfew time for the game—a time set to allow the visiting team time to meet travel schedules to return home at the end of a series—each team starts with runners at first and second base with nobody out. In addition, no new inning may start within 15minutes of the curfew time. The game was scoreless at the end of the regulation seven innings, and was tied at 1–1 at the end of the eighth inning, which ended at the curfew time. Though the game was an official game, the result did not count towards the season standings.|$|E
