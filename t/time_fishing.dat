5|$|Although {{there were}} {{conflicting}} reports {{on whether he}} retired from the Army in 1947, 1949 or 1950, he left the army only shortly before the Buffalo Soldiers were disbanded as part of President Harry S. Truman's initiative to integrate the Army. His next job was at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda where he worked as a security guard. By the time he retired for a second time, in 1970, he had become the chief of the guards at the institution. He spent much of his spare <b>time</b> <b>fishing,</b> reading the Bible, and recounting tales of his extensive military experiences, which made him a popular and respected figure within the community. His wife of 57 years, Genevieve Hill Matthews, died in 1986 and one of his daughters, Shirley Ann, died two years later.|$|E

25|$|Fishing seasons are set by {{countries}} or localities to indicate {{what kinds of}} fish may be caught during sport fishing (also known as angling) for {{a certain period of}} <b>time.</b> <b>Fishing</b> seasons are enforced to maintain ecological balance and to protect species of fish during their spawning period during which they are easier to catch.|$|E

25|$|Other {{studies of}} the Gombe chimps show that young females and males learn to fish for {{termites}} differently. Female chimps learn to fish for termites earlier and better than the young males. Females also spend more <b>time</b> <b>fishing</b> while at the mounds with their mothers—males spend more time playing. When they are adults, females need more termite protein because with young to care for, they cannot hunt the way males can.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes {{considered}} {{within the}} broad category of angling is where contestants compete for prizes {{based on the}} total length or weight of a fish, usually of a pre-determined species, caught within a specified <b>time</b> (<b>fishing</b> tournaments). Such contests have evolved from local fishing contests into large competitive circuits, where professional anglers are supported by commercial endorsements. Professional anglers are not engaged in commercial fishing, even though they gain an economic reward. Similar competitive fishing exists at the amateur level with fishing derbies. In general, derbies are distinguished from tournaments; derbies normally require fish to be killed. Tournaments normally deduct points if fish can not be released alive.|$|E
25|$|Voelker {{spent much}} of his <b>time</b> <b>fishing</b> near Ishpeming when he was not writing. He kept his car stocked with fishing poles and other supplies, and for seven or eight months of the year, he was out fishing or hiking in the woods. He was said to have fished five or six days a week for 20 years, {{according}} to one close friend. He was also known for his skills as a card player, specifically cribbage. Many readers attempted to locate Frenchman's Pond based on the descriptions from his books. Voelker did many things to discourage them from finding it, including leaving debris in the road to the pond, although he did take some people with him to the pond. Frenchman's Pond is still owned by his daughter Grace and his grandson Adam.|$|E

25|$|He {{was born}} in the fishing town of Kizukuri in Nishitsugaru District. His father, who worked as an electrician, was a keen amateur sumo enthusiast and Vice President of the Prefectural Sumo Federation. He was {{determined}} to see his son succeed in sumo and even built a dohyō in the garden for him to practise. Asahifuji also did well at sumo at school, finishing third in a national schoolboy competition, and later winning the West Japan Student Newcomers tournament while studying at Kinki University. However, tiring of the never-ending training, he gave up sumo for a while and spent his <b>time</b> <b>fishing.</b> Eventually an acquaintance of his father introduced him to Ōshima-oyakata, former ōzeki Asahikuni, who had recently opened his own heya or stable of wrestlers, Ōshima stable.|$|E
25|$|Of {{the plants}} that exist at Fajã dos Cubres the {{predominant}} species include, the sharp-pointed rush (Juncus acutus), along the lagoon, Queen Anne's lace (Daucus carota) and the Azorean spurge (Euphorbia azorica). The presence of estuary grasses (Ruppia maritima) within the lagoon is of great importance, since they were exceptional within the Azores (and only at this site). The fajã {{has a variety of}} typical marine flora and fauna, and its lagoon has become a natural refuge for diverse marine and migratory birds. Nesting birds include the Cory's shearwater (Calonectris diomedea borealis), common snipe (Gallinago gallinago), yellow-legged gull (Larus cachinnans atlantis) and the common tern (Sterna hirundo). In addition, annually, farmers bring cattle down to the fajã to graze. Although prohibited now, at one <b>time</b> <b>fishing</b> occurred in the lagoon, mostly mullet and anchovies, using netting techniques.|$|E
25|$|In February 1913, Stalin {{was arrested}} while back in Saint Petersburg. He {{was sentenced to}} four years exile in Turukhansk, a remote part of Siberia from which escape was {{particularly}} difficult. In August, he arrived {{in the village of}} Monastyrskoe, although after four weeks was relocated to the hamlet of Kostino. In March 1914, concerned over a potential escape attempt, the authorities moved Stalin to the hamlet of Kureika {{on the edge of the}} Arctic Circle. In the hamlet, Stalin had an affair with Lidia Pereprygia, who was thirteen at the time and thus a year under the legal age of consent in Tsarist Russia. Circa December 1914, Pereprygia gave birth to Stalin's child, although the infant soon died. She gave birth to another of his children, Alexander, circa April 1917. In Kureika, Stalin lived closely with the indigenous Tunguses and Ostyak, and spent much of his <b>time</b> <b>fishing.</b>|$|E
50|$|In the {{earliest}} <b>times,</b> <b>fish</b> constituted {{about half of}} the settlers' diet, together with vegetables and fruit.

50|$|Species of Philometra require two hosts to {{complete}} their lifecycle. After the larval worms are released from the host fish, they are ingested by copepods which act as an intermediate host.

50|$|First European {{settlers}} to {{the area}} arrived in 1633, with more settlers arriving in 1639. The history of the village is closely linked to sugar farming, and Charlotteville's deep-water harbour was also of importance for the town's development. In more recent <b>times</b> <b>fishing</b> has been important for Charlotteville's economy.|$|R
25|$|In {{the early}} days, the {{inhabitants}} {{on the island}} were mostly farmers and fishermen. The major population concentrated in the northeast portion of the island. Farmers grew rice, vegetables and pineapples, while fishermen lived in huts connected by plank walkways in the small harbour of Tsing Yi Tong which stretched far back into the island. Many fishermen also lived on their junks and boats all the <b>time,</b> <b>fishing</b> in the nearby waters. Even {{as late as the}} 1970s, Tsing Yi Tong resembled Tai O with its characteristic stilt houses and water vehicles. Like many other fishing villages in Hong Kong, the Tsing Yi dwellers worshipped Tin Hau, the goddess of mercy and the sea. A Tin Hau Temple was built on the shore of Tsing Yi Tong. At the birthday of Tin Hau, fishermen of all nearby waters would come to the Temple for celebrations. The temple was white in color and thus people call it Pak Miu (白廟, lit. White Temple).|$|E
500|$|Other {{threats to}} the giant otter include {{conflict}} with fishermen, who often view the species as a nuisance (see below). Ecotourism also presents challenges: while it raises money and awareness for the animals, by its nature it also increases human effect on the species, both through associated development and direct disturbances in the field. A number of restrictions on land use and human intrusion are required to properly maintain wild populations. Schenck et al., who undertook extensive fieldwork in Peru in the 1990s, suggest specific [...] "no-go" [...] zones where the species is most frequently observed, offset by observation towers and platforms to allow viewing. Limits {{on the number of}} tourists at any one <b>time,</b> <b>fishing</b> prohibitions, and a minimum safe distance of [...] are proposed to offer further protection.|$|E
500|$|Burnet {{was born}} in Traralgon, Victoria; his father, Frank Burnet, a Scottish {{emigrant}} to Australia, was {{the manager of the}} Traralgon branch of the Colonial Bank. His mother Hadassah Burnet (née Mackay) was the daughter of a middle-class Scottish immigrant, and met his father when Frank was working in the town of Koroit. Frank was 36, and 14 years older than Hadassah when they married in 1893. The family was socially conservative Anglo-Saxon Protestant. Frank Macfarlane Burnet was the second of seven children and from childhood was known as [...] "Mac". He had an older sister, two younger sisters and three younger brothers. The eldest daughter Doris had a mental disability that consumed most of Hadassah's time and the family saw Doris's condition as an unspoken stigma, discouraging the other children from inviting friends home, lest they come across the eldest daughter. From his early years in Traralgon, Mac enjoyed exploring the environment around him, particularly Traralgon Creek. He first attended a private school run by a single teacher before starting at the government primary school at the age of 7. Mac was distant from his father—who liked to spend his free <b>time</b> <b>fishing</b> and playing golf—from a young age. He preferred bookish pursuits from a young age and was not enamoured of sport, and by the age of eight was old enough to analyse his father's character; Mac disapproved of Frank and saw him as a hypocrite who espoused moral principles and put on a facade of uprightedness, while associating with businessmen of dubious ethics. Hadassah was preoccupied with Doris, so Mac developed a rather solitary personality.|$|E

2500|$|Many of Rodgers' family {{emigrated to}} America from the British Isles {{in the years}} prior to the American Revolution. Rodgers' father, Colonel John Rodgers, was born in Scotland in 1726 and was a proponent of the patriot cause. He emigrated to America and married Elizabeth Reynolds from Delaware in 1760. Born in 1742, she also was of Scottish ancestry. They had eight children, four sons and four daughters, of which John Rodgers was among the oldest. [...] Rodgers was born in 1772 on a farm in a village near the [...] "Susquehanna Ferry" [...] on the north shore of the Susquehanna River (flowing into the northeastern Chesapeake Bay near today's Perryville in Cecil County, where the tavern house still exists) where he was raised for the first {{thirteen}} years of his childhood. While Rodgers was still a youth, the village on the south shore (in Harford County) was named [...] "Havre de Grace" [...] by the passing Marquis de Lafayette after a famous port of the same name in France. The young Rodgers was an unusually strong and vital boy who spent much of his <b>time</b> <b>fishing</b> in the waters of the Susquehanna River and Chesapeake Bay near his home. He attended school in this locale and read many books about seafaring life, fostering his love of ships and the sea. He had often seen schooner-rigged ships berthed at Havre de Grace but longed to see the large square-rigged vessels he had always read about. With a strong desire to see such ships he decided to go to Baltimore and, not revealing this desire to anyone, made his way on foot to the city. Upon realizing that John was missing, Rodgers' father, Colonel Rodgers, set out on horseback and came upon his son just as he was entering the city, insisting that his son return home to the family. But John, now in his mid-teens and with Baltimore in sight, ardently refused. Realizing that his son had his heart set on seeing the large seagoing ships berthed at Baltimore and its famous waterfront neighborhood of Fells Point and even going to sea, Colonel Rodgers relented and arranged his son's apprenticeship with Captain Benjamin Folger, a master ship builder of Baltimore, a veteran of the American Revolution who had served aboard merchant ships and as commander of the Felicity, the ship used in the capture of the notorious privateer 'Jack-o-the-Lantern'. By the time the young Rodgers joined him, Folger was captain of his own ship, the Maryland. John Rodgers was put aboard a ship on which he would remain for the five years of his apprenticeship. Upon bidding his son farewell, Colonel Rodgers requested that his son never indulge in strong drink, and to this request the younger Rodgers promised, and kept his word. In adult life Rodgers did not indulge in spirituous drink.|$|E
