5|$|During the 1950s Notosusanto wrote extensively, {{focusing}} on essays but also writing poems and, later, short stories; {{the last of}} his creative works were written around 1956. He published four short story anthologies between 1958 and 1963. The first, Hudjan Kepagian (Morning Rain), consisted of six short stories. It dealt with <b>the</b> <b>struggle</b> <b>against</b> the Dutch colonists during the revolution. His second anthology, Tiga Kota (Three Cities), was published the following year and followed events in three cities: Rembang, Yogyakarta, and Jakarta. The others, and his numerous stories which were published outside of anthologies, mostly dealt with the war and the positive effects of revolution.|$|E
5|$|In a World Tomorrow episode {{broadcast}} on 8 May 2012, Rajab accused the US of opposing democracy in Bahrain when it asked Russia {{not to sell}} arms for Syria while selling arms to Bahrain, and in July, shortly before Rajab's arrest, {{he noted that the}} presence of US Fifth Fleet in Bahrain made <b>the</b> <b>struggle</b> <b>against</b> the monarchy more difficult because US support, accompanied by the support, or silence, of the international community, was seen as giving the green light for repression and attacks on human rights defenders.|$|E
5|$|K'inich B'aaknal Chaak was enthroned in 688, {{twenty years}} after Ruler 2, and reigned for twenty-seven years. During his reign he {{restored}} Toniná's power {{with a number of}} military victories over Palenque, and his reign was dominated by <b>the</b> <b>struggle</b> <b>against</b> the rival city for regional power. Ballcourt 1, the larger of Toniná's two ballcourts, was dedicated in 699 to celebrate three victories over the city's arch-rival. The ballcourt originally had six sculptures of bound captives, all vassals of the enemy Palenque king from the Usumacinta region. The date of the king's death is unknown.|$|E

Instead, he dropped out in December 1821 and enlisted in the 1st Fusilier Battalion. Prince Dom Pedro, son and heir of King JoãoVI, had just embarked upon <b>the</b> <b>struggle</b> <b>against</b> Portugal {{that would lead to}} the independence of Brazil on 7 September 1822. The prince was later acclaimed Dom PedroI, the first Brazilian emperor, on 12 October. Those Brazilian and Portuguese forces who remained loyal to Portugal refused to accept this outcome, which led to a war fought on several fronts across Brazil.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} {{occasional}} tension between those musicians {{who went into}} exile, and were therefore able to perform for, and raise awareness among, much larger audiences, and anti-apartheid musicians who remained in South Africa. The latter group has received significantly less popular attention, though Vershbow states that it played an equally {{important role in the}} movement, and Schumann argues that it was responsible for putting significant pressure on the apartheid government. The role of music in social change in South African is examined in the documentary film , released in 2002. The film focuses specifically on the 'liberation music' of <b>the</b> <b>struggle</b> <b>against</b> white domination.|$|E
5|$|Across the country, {{statues of}} Cecil Rhodes were removed and squares and roads named after {{prominent}} colonial figures were renamed after black nationalists. In 1982 Salisbury was renamed Harare. Mugabe employed North Korean architects to design Heroes' Acre, a monument and complex in western Harare to commemorate <b>the</b> <b>struggle</b> <b>against</b> minority rule. Zimbabwe also received much aid from Western countries, whose governments hoped that {{a stable and}} prosperous Zimbabwe would aid the transition of South Africa away from apartheid and minority rule. The United States provided Zimbabwe with a $25 million three-year aid package. The UK financed a land reform program, and provided military advisers to aid {{the integration of the}} guerrilla armies and old Rhodesian security forces into a new Zimbabwean military. Members of both ZANLA and ZIPRA were integrated into the army, although there remained a strong rivalry between the two groups. As President, Mugabe retained Walls {{as the head of the}} armed forces.|$|E

5|$|Among the bishops, {{only two}} stood out as {{significant}} political figures, the more prominent {{of whom was}} Robert Winchelsey, Archbishop of Canterbury. Long a formidable presence in English public life, Winchelsey had led <b>the</b> <b>struggle</b> <b>against</b> Edward I to uphold {{the autonomy of the}} church, and for this he had paid with suspension and exile. One of Edward II’s first acts as king had been to reinstate Winchelsey, but rather than responding with grateful loyalty, the archbishop soon reassumed a leadership role in the fight against the king. Although he was trying to appease Winchelsey, the king carried an old grudge against another prelate, Walter Langton, Bishop of Lichfield. Edward had Langton dismissed from his position as treasurer of the Exchequer and had his temporal possessions confiscated. Langton had been an opponent of Winchelsey during the previous reign, but Edward II’s move against Langton drew the two Ordainers together.|$|E
5|$|Andronikos {{began his}} reign well; in particular, the {{measures}} {{he took to}} reform {{the government of the}} Empire have been praised by historians. According to George Ostrogorsky, Andronikos was determined to root out corruption: Under his rule, the sale of offices ceased; selection was based on merit, rather than favouritism; officials were paid an adequate salary so as to reduce the temptation of bribery. In the provinces, Andronikos's reforms produced a speedy and marked improvement. The aristocrats were infuriated against him, and to make matters worse, Andronikos seems to have become increasingly unbalanced; executions and violence became increasingly common, and his reign turned into a reign of terror. Andronikos seemed almost to seek the extermination of the aristocracy as a whole. <b>The</b> <b>struggle</b> <b>against</b> the aristocracy turned into wholesale slaughter, while the Emperor resorted to ever more ruthless measures to shore up his regime.|$|E
5|$|Beaumont {{was present}} {{for some of}} the most notable events of Henry VI's reign. He was present at the arrest of Humphrey, duke of Gloucester in 1447, helped defend the king against Jack Cade's Rebellion in 1450, and helped {{suppress}} the rebellion of Richard, duke of York in 1452. While York and his allies ended up fighting against the king, Beaumont remained loyal to the Lancastrian crown during the 1450s, which saw the beginning of the Wars of the Roses. His personal loyalty to Henry VI eventually cost him his life – he was killed, bodyguarding the king, at the battle of Northampton in 1460. Beaumont's son, William Beaumont, continued <b>the</b> <b>struggle</b> <b>against</b> the Yorkists.|$|E

5|$|But {{apart from}} the {{clerical}} business, Las Casas had also traveled to Spain for his own purpose: to continue <b>the</b> <b>struggle</b> <b>against</b> the colonists' mistreatment of the Indians. The encomienda had, in fact, legally been abolished in 1523, {{but it had been}} reinstituted in 1526, and in 1530 a general ordinance against slavery was reversed by the Crown. For this reason it was a pressing matter for Bartolomé de las Casas to plead once again for the Indians with Charles V who was by now Holy Roman Emperor and no longer a boy. He wrote a letter asking for permission to stay in Spain a little longer in order to argue for the Emperor that conversion and colonization were best achieved by peaceful means.|$|E
5|$|During {{this period}} <b>the</b> <b>struggle</b> <b>against</b> colonial rule intensified. Nationalism became the {{pre-eminent}} cause. Claiming Indian superiority became the tool of cultural revivalism {{resulting in an}} essentialising model of Indian womanhood {{similar to that of}} Victorian womanhood: special yet separated from public space. Gandhi legitimised and expanded Indian women's public activities by initiating them into the non-violent civil disobedience movement against the British Raj. He exalted their feminine roles of caring, self-abnegation, sacrifice and tolerance; and carved a niche for those in the public arena. Peasant women {{played an important role in}} the rural satyagrahas of Borsad and Bardoli. Women-only organisations like All India Women's Conference (AIWC) and the National Federation of Indian Women (NFIW) emerged. Women were grappling with issues relating to the scope of women's political participation, women's franchise, communal awards, and leadership roles in political parties.|$|E
5|$|The people, {{who felt}} the {{severity}} of his laws, {{at the same time}} acknowledged their justice, and found themselves protected from the rapacity of their superiors. Andronikos's energetic efforts to rein in the oppressive tax collectors and officials of the empire did much to alleviate the lot of the peasantry. However, his efforts to check the power of the nobility were considerably more problematic. The aristocrats were infuriated with him, and to make matters worse, Andronikos seems to have become increasingly deranged; executions and violence became increasingly common, and his reign turned into a reign of terror. Andronikos seemed almost to seek the extermination of the aristocracy as a whole. <b>The</b> <b>struggle</b> <b>against</b> the aristocracy turned into wholesale slaughter, as the emperor resorted to ever more ruthless measures to shore up his regime.|$|E

5|$|The rebels had {{multiple}} sources for arms, {{but did not}} possess heavy weaponry, {{with the exception of}} two artillery pieces. Sources for weapons included the Turkish forces in southern Anatolia, Bedouin tribes who either sold or smuggled Mauser rifles to the rebels that the Germans had distributed to the tribes during World War I, weapon stockpiles left behind by Ottoman troops fleeing Syria during the British-Arab offensive in 1918, and raids against French arms warehouses. The rebels' arsenal largely consisted of German Mauser rifles, revolvers, shotguns, and Turkish five-shooters, as well as sabres and daggers. According to Khoury, the rebels also possessed twelve light machine guns. Following the destruction of the Arab government in July 1920, the Turks became the main arms suppliers of the rebels. The rebels distinguished the Turkish armed movement in Anatolia from the Ottomans, who the rebels viewed negatively, by stressing the role of Turkish general Mustafa Kemal, who was viewed as the quintessential guerrilla leader in <b>the</b> <b>struggle</b> <b>against</b> French occupation.|$|E
5|$|Transylvania, {{together}} with the neighboring counties, gained the status of an autonomous state under Ottoman suzerainty after the central territories of the Kingdom of Hungary had been annexed by the Ottomans in 1541. The fall of the kingdom also deprived Wallachia and Moldavia of their main ally in <b>the</b> <b>struggle</b> <b>against</b> the Ottoman Empire. In 1594 Michael the Brave of Wallachia joined an anti-Ottoman alliance initiated by Pope Clement VIII. After a series of victory over the Ottomans, he turned against Transylvania and Moldavia where pro-Polish and pro-Ottoman princes were reigning. He invaded and occupied Transylvania in 1599, and Moldavia in 1600. Although the union of the three countries collapsed in four months, it served as an ideal for later generations working for the unification of the lands that now form Romania.|$|E

The difficulty is that the required data are very diverse and are not to be found in a single archive. They are scattered between the State Archive of the Russian Federation, the archive of the Russian Federation State Statistical Committee (Goskomstat), the archives of the RF Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD of Russia), the FSB of Russia, the RF General Prosecutor's Office, and the Russian Military and Historical Archive. Further documents are held in the archives of 83 constituent entities of the Russian Federation, in urban and regional archives, as well as in the archives of the former Soviet Republics, now the 11 independent countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States or the three Baltic States (Baltics).|$|E
