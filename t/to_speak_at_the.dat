5|$|Crowley left Busch and {{returned}} to London, where he took Pearl Brooksmith as his new Scarlet Woman. Undergoing further nasal surgery, it was here in 1932 that {{he was invited to}} be guest of honour at Foyles' Literary Luncheon, also being invited by Harry Price <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> National Laboratory of Psychical Research. In need of money, he launched a series of court cases against people whom he believed had libelled him, some of which proved successful. He gained much publicity for his lawsuit against Constable and Co for publishing Nina Hamnett's Laughing Torso (1932) – a book he thought libelled him – but lost the case. The court case added to Crowley's financial problems, and in February 1935 he was declared bankrupt. During the hearing, it was revealed that Crowley had been spending three times his income for several years.|$|E

5|$|One {{day after}} the report was released, Metropolitan Herman {{resigned}} from his position as Metropolitan. That November, the OCA elected a new Primate at its 15th Annual All-American Council. Metropolitan Jonah (Paffhausen) was chosen because he had recently been appointed as a bishop (only 11 days prior) and was viewed to not be involved with the previous financial scandal. Metropolitan Jonah immediately took a strong stance against the previous scandal and became a very public metropolitan, seeking to repair damage done by the previous scandal and bring the OCA into the public realm. Metropolitan Jonah also sought to improve relations with non-Orthodox groups and especially sought to repair {{the relations between the}} OCA and traditional Anglican groups. He was invited twice <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> conference of the Anglican Church of North America, in 2009 and 2012.|$|E
5|$|The Azusa Street Revival was a {{historic}} revival meeting {{that took place}} in Los Angeles, California, and is the origin of the Pentecostal movement. Neely Terry, an African American woman who attended a small holiness church pastored by Julia Hutchins in Los Angeles, made a trip to visit family in Houston late in 1905. While in Houston, she visited Seymour's church, where he preached on receiving the Holy Spirit with the evidence of speaking in other tongues, and though he had not experienced this personally, Terry was impressed with his character and message. Once home in California, Terry suggested that Seymour be invited <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> local church. Seymour received and accepted the invitation in February 1906, and he received financial help and a blessing from Parham for his planned one-month visit.|$|E
5|$|He {{started with}} a {{collection}} of seven basic statistics (assists, blocks, fouls, points, rebounds, steals, and turnovers) from Yahoo! Sports on every NBA player from the previous season and adjusted the stats for time in play. The software grouped the players into color-coded nodes and connected them with lines that represented statistical similarities. Alagappan had expected the software to create five groups of nodes by statistical advantages, which would each represent a position of play, but the software instead returned 13 node groups representing 13 mathematically described positions. The assignments compare player statistics and not individual style. Originally unconfident in his results, he explored the data on his own for a week before sharing his findings with his bosses and basketball statisticians including Ken Pomeroy, who replied in encouragement. He then applied and was accepted <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> 2012 MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference. By May 2012, at least four NBA teams and one MLB team had contacted Ayasdi about using their technology.|$|E
