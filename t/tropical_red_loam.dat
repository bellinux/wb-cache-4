50|$|It {{has a wide}} distribution, {{occurring}} {{throughout the}} Avon Wheatbelt and Coolgardie biogeographic regions, with outliers as far west as Perth and {{as far south as}} Esperance. The relief is generally gentle slopes. It grows in a range of soils: <b>red</b> <b>loams,</b> <b>red</b> clay <b>loams,</b> yellow and <b>red</b> sand, and laterite.|$|R
30|$|Soils in {{the area}} have been {{classified}} into deep <b>red</b> <b>loam,</b> black soil and red sandy soil. The majority {{of the study area}} is covered by <b>red</b> <b>loam,</b> and <b>red</b> sandy soil. Ferruginous black soils are also seen at places. Black soils are deep to very deep and generally occur in the depressions adjacent to hilly areas of district. Alluvial soils occur along the river courses (CGWB report by Balakrishnan 2008).|$|R

50|$|It has a {{population}} that is scattered through the West Kimberley region of Western Australia. It prefers alluvial soils or <b>red</b> <b>loams</b> and is found on sandstone ridges and low flat areas.|$|R
50|$|The plant {{grows in}} well drained, deep clay loamy soil; laterite, <b>red</b> <b>loam</b> and {{alluvial}} soils are considered most suitable. Areca nut farming, to achieve good yield, needs large application of organic manures and chemical fertilizers.|$|R
50|$|The {{range of}} the plant is on sandplains and undulating areas along the south of Western Australia in the {{southern}} Wheatbelt and south western Goldfields-Esperance regions where it grows in <b>red</b> <b>loam,</b> grey sandy loam and sometimes gravelly soils.|$|R
50|$|The diffuse {{spreading}} shrub {{can grow}} to {{a height of}} 0.3 to 2 m. It flowers from June to July producing yellow flowers. The plant will grown in <b>red</b> <b>loam,</b> sand or gravel soils and is often found on the plains or rocky hills.|$|R
30|$|The {{incredible}} {{variation in}} geology, topography and climate {{has resulted in}} formation of <b>red</b> sandy <b>loam,</b> clay loam and alluvial soils. The <b>red</b> <b>loam</b> soils occur in {{the central part of}} the Garo Hills and on the uplands of central and eastern Meghalaya. Alluvial soils occur at foothills and along river courses along the northern, western and southern border of the State. The most soils are lateritic (oxisol) type derived from Archaen gneisses, schists and granites (Gnasser [1964]). The soils of Meghalaya are acidic with pH varying from 3.8 to 6.9 (Shankar et al. [1991]).|$|R
40|$|Tropical soils {{include a}} wide variety of pedogenic {{materials}} common to the tropical regions of the world, of which the material properties and engineering behaviour may vary significantly. These soils in many ways have unique characteristics that can mainly be ascribed to the compositions and micro-structures of a material developed under hot, wet soil-forming conditions. Due to the variation in their properties and behaviour, the classification of soils formed under such conditions as distinct and well-defined soil types appears to have been avoided in the past. Unfortunately, this has brought about the grouping and classification of materials of significantly varying chemical, geological and/or geotechnical properties and engineering behaviour under a single, all-encompassing term of <b>tropical</b> <b>red</b> soils. The unique pedogenic environment and soil characteristics further mean that conventional soil mechanics concepts and geotechnical investigative procedures, developed almost exclusively from work completed on temperate soils, do not necessarily apply to soils formed in tropical environments. This research reviews the typical and unique characteristics and behaviour of <b>tropical</b> <b>red</b> soils as summarised in the existing literature, including the application of existing soil classification systems and the possible ambiguity existing in the classification and nomenclature pertaining to soils formed in tropical environments. Significant inconsistencies in the identification and classification of <b>tropical</b> <b>red</b> soils and laterites were observed to exist throughout the available literature, with frequently overlapping ranges of geological, geotechnical and chemical properties reported for both lateritic and <b>tropical</b> <b>red</b> soil types. Much has been written in the existing literature regarding the unique material characteristics and engineering behaviour of <b>tropical</b> <b>red</b> soils and the inapplicability of conventional soil mechanics concepts. The majority of the available results, conclusions and recommendations in the existing literature refer to residual <b>tropical</b> <b>red</b> soils only, with very little information regarding the characteristics and behaviour of transported <b>tropical</b> <b>red</b> soils being reported. The characteristics and behaviour of a number of transported <b>tropical</b> <b>red</b> soil horizons, from a selected area in the Mayoko region of the Republic of the Congo, were evaluated through conventional and specialised testing regimes during the completion of this study. A large number of disturbed and undisturbed samples were collected from the study area and submitted to geotechnical laboratories in South Africa to establish the chemical-, mineralogical-, index and mechanical properties of these soils. The test results, sample preparation and test procedures and effect of these on the engineering behaviour of the material were evaluated and compared to the typical results reported for residual <b>tropical</b> <b>red</b> soils in the literature. A number of the findings from this study, particularly the sensitivity of <b>tropical</b> <b>red</b> soils to change in moisture content and effect of the dispersing agent on the reported particle size distribution of such soils, confirmed the findings which {{have been reported in the}} literature for residual <b>tropical</b> <b>red</b> soils. However, the transported <b>tropical</b> <b>red</b> soils were also found to differ markedly from residual <b>tropical</b> <b>red</b> soils in certain aspects, most notably in terms of the apparent effect of the lack of remnant structure on the material mechanical properties, permeability, sample disturbance and relevance of tests completed on remoulded test specimens.

40|$|Abstract: A {{factorial}} {{pot experiment}} was conducted using {{two types of}} soils (sandy <b>loam</b> and <b>red</b> clay <b>loam)</b> that are commonly used for commercial vegetable production in Bundaberg, region of Central Queensland Australia. The soils were amended with 0, 25, 50 and 75 t/ha of green waste biochar and minimum doses of N, P and K (30 kg/ha, 30 kg/ha and 40 kg/ha respectively). After two weeks of plant establishment, the pots were leached with 1. 5 litres of deionised water at week intervals, and cation concentrations of the leachate were determined. In 25 t/ha biochar treatment, {{there was a significant}} (P< 0. 05) reduction in K and Ca leaching by 40 % and 26 % respectively from sandy loam, and of Ca by 23 % from the <b>red</b> clay <b>loam.</b> Soil water holding capacity and soil organic carbon were also increased in both biochar treated soils. After 12 weeks of growth, shoot weight was significantly (P< 0. 05) higher in 25 t/ha biochar-treated sandy <b>loam</b> and <b>red</b> clay <b>loam</b> (32 % and 31 % respectively). These results clearly demonstrated that a higher yield of capsicum can be achieved from green waste biochar application in sandy <b>loam</b> and <b>red</b> clay <b>loam</b> at 25 t/ha biochar...|$|R

50|$|The reserve {{receives}} {{an average annual}} rainfall of 1930 mm. The climate is sub tropical, though at an elevation ranging from 360 to 732 m, it is cooler than at the coast nearby. Soils are derived from Miocene basalt, which provide a deep <b>red</b> <b>loam.</b> Below the basalt are less fertile sedimentary rocks. The western area of the reserve where it adjoins the Great Dividing Range has partly eroded, forming areas of cliffs, rocks and shallow soils. Deep gullies, isolated hills and sharp edged rocky ridges occur here. Rocks include pebbly mudstone, conglomerate siltstone and shale. Serpentinite outcrops can also be seen.|$|R

50|$|There are 105 {{commercial}} farms around Tsumeb. The area consists {{largely of}} rolling hills covered in thorn bush. Tsumeb {{falls under the}} dry woodland, savanna vegetation zone. The soil around Tsumeb varies in quality from very fertile <b>red</b> <b>loam</b> through black turf to chalky clay and loam. The district is thus suitable for intensified farming and crop production. There is an abundance of ground water and regular rainfall in the summer months. Irrigation makes the area even more productive. Farmers in the area grow citrus fruits with much success. The main crops grown are maize, sorghum and sunflowers. Cattle farming is also widespread.|$|R
