50|$|The {{disadvantage}} {{of the system}} is that it provides a single point of failure for security. If the key to a district's Knox-Box is stolen or copied, a thief can enter any building that has a Knox-Box. Sometimes a building manager wires the building's Knox-Box into a burglar alarm system so that opening the box trips the alarm, negating its use in facilitating clandestine entry. All Knox commercial boxes have a standard <b>tamper</b> <b>switch</b> for this purpose.|$|E
50|$|This signal {{indicates}} that {{a portion of the}} building's fire protection system has been disabled (such as a fire sprinkler control valve being closed and, consequently, a sprinkler <b>tamper</b> <b>switch</b> being activated), or, less frequently, that a lower priority initiating device has been triggered (such as a duct smoke detector). Depending on the system's design, the supervisory point may be latching, meaning the panel must be reset to clear the supervisory condition, or non-latching, meaning the indicator automatically goes out when the condition has cleared. However, some panels require a reset regardless of whether the supervisory point is latching or non-latching.|$|E
50|$|Common {{applications}} of micro switches include the door interlock on a microwave oven, levelling and safety switches in elevators, vending machines, and to detect paper jams or other faults in photocopiers. Micro switches {{are commonly used}} in <b>tamper</b> <b>switches</b> on gate valves on fire sprinkler systems and other water pipe systems, where {{it is necessary to}} know if a valve has been opened or shut.|$|R
50|$|Where {{lighting}} circuits {{must not}} be accidentally switched off (for example, school corridors), a vandal resistant switch may be installed. These require a key to operate and so discourage casual or accidental operation of the <b>switch.</b> The <b>tamper</b> resistant <b>switches</b> are also used in corridor and restroom lighting controls in public buildings such as schools.|$|R
60|$|While a Division Superintendent of {{a railway}} was {{attending}} closely to his business of placing obstructions {{on the track}} and <b>tampering</b> with the <b>switches</b> he received word that the President of the road was about to discharge him for incompetency.|$|R
50|$|A points lever, ground throw, or switchstand is a lever and {{accompanying}} linkages {{that are used}} to align the points of a switch manually. This lever and its accompanying hardware is usually mounted to a pair of long sleepers that extend from the switch at the points. They are often used in a place of a switch motor on infrequently used switches. In some places, the lever may be some distance from the points, as part of a lever frame or ground frame. To prevent the <b>tampering</b> of <b>switches</b> by outside means, these switches are locked up when not in use.|$|R
50|$|Krazy Kat and his pal Ducky are on {{vacation}} as they board a train at the station. But their pleasant ride {{is going to}} have some disruptions when their rival Blackrat (who looks like a naked Mickey Mouse) also goes on board. Moments after the train departed, Krazy and Ducky were confronted by Blackrat. The cat and the rodent engage in a brawl while the mallard stands aside, serving as Krazy's back up. Krazy eventually wins the fight and kicks Blackrat off the train. Though removed from the ride, Blackrat still looks to get back at them as the rodent <b>tampers</b> a track <b>switch,</b> sending the train into another track.|$|R
