40|$|Graduation date: 1998 The {{purpose of}} this study was to analyze preservice teachers' talk about gender issues in {{education}} through a poststructural feminist theoretical framework. Eighteen Master of Arts in Teaching students volunteered to participate in a seminar. During the seminar the participants wrote about and discussed gender issues in teaching. Data collected from the seminar included transcripts of audio-taped conversations as well as response journals and autobiographical sketches written by the participants. Four themes, gender talk, teacher talk, confessional <b>talk,</b> and <b>resistance</b> <b>talk,</b> were explored in the data. The theme gender talk included the participants' observations of and discussions about the differences between females and males. Teacher talk included discussions of what it means to be a teacher and how gender, race, and class impact the teacher's role and the educational experience of children. The data illustrated the multiple and competing discourses these preservice teachers employed when discussing gender issues. The themes confessional <b>talk</b> and <b>resistance</b> <b>talk</b> focused on how the participants talked about gender. These themes raised questions about teacher education practices. They served to illustrate the power relationships inherent in teacher education and how these relations of power act to authorize some discourses and suppress others. Modifications of teacher education practices were recommended by the researcher. These recommendations included helping preservice teachers deconstruct the discourses of education and the role of the teacher as well as suggesting that preservice teachers could benefit from alternate and varied educational sites in which to explore issues of teaching...|$|R

This essay investigates the meaning and the reasons of resistance according to a theoretical, aesthetic, and cultural point of view. The thesis is that resistance has to be considered as an articulation of difference, and that means following a different logic of thought, no longer rigid or monolithic but plural, like a new grammar, syntax, and practice of creativity, challenge, provocation, multiplicity, and pluralism. In this sense the aesthetics of resistance is an art of difference, the capability of creating cultural formations that provide elegance and refinement...|$|R

40|$|Observations {{from three}} {{case studies of}} public sector reforms are reported.

Personnel were invited to the managerial decision making process, but this functioned rather as therapy than as a channel for actual employee influence.

A framework distinguishing between four interpretations of resistance and corresponding decision making strategies is suggested. The framework {{can be used to}} understand and discuss different interpretations of resistance and choices pertaining to employee influence in the decision making process.

40|$|The {{plant hormones}} jasmonic acid (JA) and {{salicylic}} acid (SA) play key roles in plant defenses against pathogens and several WRKY transcription {{factors have been}} shown to have a role in SA/JA crosstalk. In a previous study, overexpression of the poplar WRKY gene PtrWRKY 89 enhanced resistance to pathogens in transgenic poplars. In this study, the promoter of PtrWRKY 89 (ProPtrWRKY 89) was isolated and used to drive GUS reporter gene. High GUS activity was observed in old leaves of transgenic Arabidopsis containing ProPtrWRKY 89 -GUS construct and GUS expression was extremely induced by SA solution and SA+MeJA mixture but not by MeJA treatment. Subcellular localization and transactivation assays showed that PtrWRKY 89 acted as a transcription activator in the nucleus. Constitutive expression of PtrWRKY 89 in Arabidopsis resulted in more susceptible to Pseudomonas syringae and Botrytis cinerea compared to wild-type plants. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis confirmed that marker genes of SA and JA pathways were down-regulated in transgenic Arabidopsis after pathogen inoculations. Overall, our results indicated that PtrWRKY 89 modulates a cross <b>talk</b> in <b>resistance</b> to P. syringe and B. cinerea by negatively regulating both SA and JA pathways in Arabidopsis...|$|R

40|$|It {{is widely}} known that Glycine max L.

Yet, the yearly yield of soybean is not as high as can be expected due to Heterodera glycines Ichinole, or soybean cyst nematode (later, SCN). SCN is one of the most destructive pests and pathogens of soybean and the main methods for control have proven to be problematic and time-consuming so far (Koenning 2000; UIPC 2015). Lineages of soybean that are resistant to SCN have been developed but it is yet unknown what the cause of this resistance is. Rgh 1 and Rhg 4 loci are two main loci that are considered when <b>talking</b> about <b>resistance</b> and Rhg 4 locus, while required for resistance to SCN race 3, has not been fully mapped. Focusing on the Rhg 4 locus, this study was aimed at uncovering the potential causes of resistance of soybean to SCN.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a laboratory collective resistance (CR) game {{to study how}} different forms of repeated interactions, with and without communication, can help coordinate subordinates' collective resistance to a ???divide-and-conquer??? transgression against their personal interests. In the one-shot CR game, a first???mover (the ???leader???) decides whether to transgress against two responders. Successful transgression increases the payoff of the leader {{at the expense of}} the victim(s) of transgression. The two responders then simultaneously decide whether to challenge the leader. The subordinates face a coordination problem in that their challenge against the leader's transgression will only succeed if both of them incur the cost to do so. The outcome without transgression can occur in equilibrium with standard money-maximizing preferences with repeated interactions, but this outcome is not an equilibrium with standard preferences when adding non-binding subordinate ???cheap talk??? communication in the one-shot game. Nevertheless, we find that communication (in the one-shot game) is at least as effective as repetition (with no communication) in reducing the transgression rate. Moreover, communication is better than repetition in coordinating resistance, because it makes it easier for subordinates to identify others who have social preferences and are willing to incur the cost to punish a violation of social norms.

The AWB called a protest in which the town was inundated by angry opponents of De Klerk, including armed paramilitary members of the AWB. The supporters had showed up from far and wide, even a group of angered White Namibian farmers joined in the mass protest.

40|$|Infections {{have been}} the major cause of disease {{throughout}} the history of human populations. With the introduction of antibiotics, it was thought that this problem should disappear. However, bacteria have been able to evolve to become antibiotic resistant. Nowadays, a proficient pathogen must be virulent, epidemic, and resistant to antibiotics. Analysis of the interplay among these features of bacterial populations is needed to predict the future of infectious diseases. In this regard, we have reviewed the genetic linkage of antibiotic resistance and bacterial virulence in the same genetic determinants as well as the cross <b>talk</b> between antibiotic <b>resistance</b> and virulence regulatory circuits with the aim of understanding the effect of acquisition of resistance on bacterial virulence. We also discuss the possibility that antibiotic resistance and bacterial virulence might prevail as linked phenotypes in the future. The novel situation brought about by the worldwide use of antibiotics is undoubtedly changing bacterial populations. These changes might alter the properties of not only bacterial pathogens, but also the normal host microbiota. The evolutionary consequences of the release of antibiotics into the environment are largely unknown, but most probably restoration of the microbiota from the preantibiotic era is beyond our current abilities...|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} an {{empirical}} exploration of Foucault's theoretical ideas on resistance, through {{a case study}} of cervical cancer screening and women's responses to the official discourse surrounding it. In England, this form of screening is organised through a national programme and consistently achieves coverage of over 80 %. Given this high attendance it may appear that any resistance is negligible. However, this thesis argues that such a focus on attendance, or behaviour, is misguided and that, by focusing attention on the level at which the official discourse on screening is interpreted, understood and made sense of by individual women, it is possible to identify instances of thought and <b>talk</b> based <b>resistance.</b> Using qualitative interviews with a sample structured to include a range of ethnic backgrounds and ages, the thesis identifies three key forms of resistance. Firstly, women may resist the general subject position suggested within the official discourse and make sense of screening in ways that are meaningful to them as individuals. Secondly, many women resist the general 'at risk' status suggested and negotiate their own position drawing on a range of risk factors that do not always fit well with those medically recognised. Thirdly, in making sense of the information they receive, women frequently attempt to create a rational framework of knowledge and understanding which can lead to them interpreting issues such as risk factors or disease development in different ways. Based upon these, the thesis argues for conceptualising power and resistance in terms of a complex network of possibilities with multiple points of potential difference or divergence that can lead to individuals adopting very different subject positions. Although the majority of resistance detailed is thought and talk based, this is nevertheless important as it provides the means for challenges to the official discourse and constitutes a necessary prerequisite for further behavioural resistance.

40|$|International audienceRésumé La reformulation, marque d'une écoute empathique {{initialement}} développée par Rogers, trouve aujourd'hui de nouvelles orientations et applications dans le champ de la psychothérapie. L'objet de cet article est d'expliquer plus avant cette technique et d'examiner son rôle et ses principales formes dans la thérapie centrée sur la personne de Rogers et l'entretien motivationnel (EM), et de faire le point sur les études empiriques portant sur l'influence de la reformulation et de l'empathie dans l'efficacité des psychothérapies validées scientifiquement, et notamment de l'entretien motivationnel. Les changements et enrichissements apportés par l'entretien motivationnel à la reformulation sont mis en évidence à travers les nouveaux objectifs visés et techniques employées, et notamment en lien avec la production de discours-changement. Les effets du discours-changement sont étudiés à travers une revue de la littérature et notamment des études psycholinguistiques. Enfin, de nouvelles pistes de recherche sont proposées. Ainsi, il est intéressant de vérifier quel rôle joue l'écoute réflective, technique centrale de l'EM, dans la production du discours-changement du client et dans l'efficacité de l'EM et des psychothérapies. Enfin, il semble important d'élargir son utilisation aux différents types de psychothérapie et d'en évaluer ses effets. Summary Reflection, a {{key element}} of empathic listening, initially developed by Carl Rogers, has found new purposes and applications in modern psychotherapy. The aim {{of this article is to}} explain this technique in more depth and to examine its role and main forms in Rogers' client-centered therapy and motivational interviewing (MI), and to review empirical studies based on the influence of reflection and empathy in the effectiveness of empirically validated psychotherapies, and in particular MI. In fact, in the Rogers' approach, (Rogers et Kinget, 1962 [2]), as well as in MI and in CBT, in spite of their orientation towards change and a certain directivity, reflection is considered as the main way to express accurate empathy. Empathy is a central feature in several therapeutic approaches and has been particularly associated with positive results in the treatment of various problems (Miller et Rollnick, 2002; Miller et Baca, 1982; Greenberb et al., 2001 [8 – 10]). This therapeutic attitude, widely used by Rogers (1951, 1959, 1968 [11 – 13]), has been adopted by the authors of MI, Miller et Rollnick (2002, 1991 [4, 8]), as well as by other forms of effective psychotherapies. Reflective listening plays a central role in both MI and the Rogers's client-centered approach; in MI, it was adopted and enriched with new, more complex forms, as well as with objectives which differ from Rogers' approach. In MI, the client's talk which reflect their intentions to change (change-talk) are predominantly reflected upon. MI requires thus a selective method of response to the client's speech to reduce ambivalence and guide the person towards change. Four sub-categories, including cognitive, emotional and behavioral dimensions of commitment to change, constitute the preparatory change-talk: the desire, ability, reason and need to change, "commitment" and the "first steps". The sustain talk consists of statements opposing change, and <b>resistance</b> <b>talk</b> consists of interruptions and disagreements with the therapist. According to Miller et Rose (2009 [18]), the effectiveness of MI is based on its influence on change-talk. These authors hypothesized that behavioral change is directly linked to client change-talk during MI sessions, and that it is inversely linked to sustain talk. According to those authors, the effective use of the MI technique increases change-talk in clients and reduces sustain talk, which predicts effective change in behavior. Studies comparing MI to more traditional treatment models or minimal intervention show the links between MI-consistent behaviors and the emergence of more change-talk compared with other approaches or minimal intervention (Apodaca et Longabaugh, 2009; Moyers et al., 2007 [23, 24]). Current research by Amrhein et al. (Amrhein et al., 2003; Amrhein, 2004 [14, 26]) shows that the intensity of commitment to change by the client and the first steps predict long-term change in behavior. Expressions of change-talk such as desire, ability, the reason and the need to change do not systematically initiate change but they announce the reinforcement of commitment to change. The effect of the intensity of client commitment talk on behavior change has been verified in a study on CBT for hospitalized cocaine addicts (Aharonovich et al., 2008 [27]). In conclusion, reflection allows the therapist to evoke the client's statements in the direction of the desired change, and to reinforce it, which should then lead to an effective change in behavior. However, it is still too early to make any conclusions about the efficiency of reflective listening. Despite its frequent use in psychotherapy, the specific therapeutic effectiveness of reflecting is still rarely assessed in empirical studies. It would thus be interesting to assess the role that reflective listening, a central technique in MI, plays in the production of the client's change-talk, in the building of the therapeutic alliance and in the effectiveness of MI and other empirically validated psychotherapies. Finally, it is important to expand its use to different types of psychotherapy and to assess its impact...|$|R
