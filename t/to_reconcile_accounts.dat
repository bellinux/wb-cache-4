The GLS reconciliation method is applied <b>to</b> <b>reconciling</b> the 1997 GDP-by-industry accounts and the Input-output accounts. The GDP-by-industry accounts measure GDP by industry using industry gross income, and the input-output accounts measure GDP by industry as the residual between gross output and intermediate inputs.

The results show that using reliability <b>to</b> <b>reconcile</b> different <b>accounts</b> produces statistically meaningful balanced estimates. The study demonstrates that reconciling a large system of disaggregated accounts is empirically feasible and computationally efficient. ...|$|R

Congress required that the accounts be audited and reconciled before the Bureau of Indian Affairs transferred funds to a third party. Interior's fiscal year 1990 appropriations act added a requirement that the <b>accounts</b> be <b>reconciled</b> <b>to</b> the earliest possible date and that Interior obtain an independent certification of the reconciliation work. The American Indian Trust Fund Management Reform Act of 1994 required Interior to provide tribes with <b>reconciled</b> <b>account</b> statements as of September 30, 1995.

When Interior's reconciliation project was completed in January 1996, each tribe was provided a report that included unreconciled account statements with schedules of proposed adjustments based on results for each year of the five-year reconciliation. Later that year, GAO reported shortcomings in Interior's reconciliation project. As of May 1997, Interior had provided reconciliation reports to 310 tribes, 51 of which disputed the reconciliation results, and 41 of which accepted the results. Of the remaining 218 tribes, 47 had requested more time to consider the results, and 171 had not responded to the reconciliation results.

500|$|Herodotus's {{narrative}} {{after the}} Battle of Ephesus is ambiguous in its exact chronology; historians generally place Sardis and Ephesus in 498 BC.

He next says that [...] "Daurises, Hymaees, and Otanes, all of them Persian generals and married to daughters of Darius, pursued those Ionians who had marched to Sardis, and drove them to their ships. After this victory they divided the cities among themselves and sacked them." [...] This passage implies these Persian generals counter-attacked immediately after the Battle of Ephesus.

40|$|More {{accurate}} {{valuation of}} fixed assets in the Balance Sheet and calculation of depreciation in current cost terms are aims of inflation accounting. This report demonstrates which of the commonly used traditional depreciation methods might best be adapted to measurement of fixed asset values and current cost depreciation under the guidelines established in the Richardson Report. Also, depreciation allowances and book values are compared for the proposed current cost methods and the present historical cost system. The comparison of methods (and rates) of depreciation was made using a cross-section of tractors and headers for which data was collected {{in a recent survey}} of New Zealand wheat growers. The best method and optimum rate of depreciation was defined on the basis of minimum sums of squares of errors (SSE) between assessed values and calculated book values. This approach attempts <b>to</b> <b>reconcile</b> the <b>accounting</b> and economic viewpoints with regard to measurement of depreciation. The use of standard depreciation formulae and indexed historical cost means that the results may be useful for accounting purposes. However, since depreciation is calculated by valuing assets first and then computing the depreciation, the approach conforms to economic theory...|$|R

5000|$|The {{incident}} {{is a matter}} of some controversy. One source [...] states Jastrząb was escorting PQ 15, i.e. travelling with the convoy. Others however [...] state she was covering PQ 15’s passage by patrolling the Norwegian coast against a sortie by German capital ships, one of five submarines so assigned. These sources state Jastrząb was out of position; Pertek however states that it was the convoy which was out of position, and other sources confirm the convoy had altered course to avoid ice. The position of the incident, 200 miles from the Norwegian coast is inconsistent with a mission to patrol that coast, typically no more than 10 to 20 miles out. Pertek also (after Romanowskis testimony) states Jastrząb was fired upon despite showing yellow recognition smoke candles; however other sources do not confirm this. Finally Pertek states the commanders of St Albans and Seagull were found guilty at a court martial over the incident; Kemp states that the court of enquiry (a normal procedure following the loss of a ship, though not of friendly fire cases) found no blame could be attributed to either commander.

Once these religious elements are removed, Richards argues that it is clear [...] "the whole episode was political in nature." [...] He points out for Justinian's plans to recover Rome and Italy, [...] "that there should be a pro-Eastern pope substituted as soon as possible. The ideal candidate was at hand in Constantinople.

2500|$|Historian Peter Green, in his 1974 book Alexander of Macedon, {{proposed}} a way <b>to</b> <b>reconcile</b> the <b>accounts</b> of Diodorus and Arrian. [...] According to Green's interpretation, the riverbank was guarded by infantry, not cavalry, and Alexander's forces sustained heavy {{losses in the}} initial attempt to cross the river and were forced to retire. [...] Alexander then grudgingly accepted Parmenion's advice and crossed the river during the night in an uncontested location, and fought the battle at dawn the next day. [...] The Persian army hurried {{to the location of}} Alexander's crossing, with the cavalry reaching the scene of the battle first before the slower infantry, and then the battle continued largely as described by the Arrian and Plutarch accounts. [...] Green accounts for the differences between his account and the ancient sources by suggesting that Alexander later covered up his initial failed crossing. Green devotes an entire appendix in support of his interpretation, taking the view that for political reasons, Alexander could not admit even a temporary defeat. Thus, the initial defeat was covered up by his propagandists by a very heroic (and Homeric) charge into the now well-deployed enemy. In his preface to the 2012 reprint, Green states: [...] "on the evidence as it stands that theory remains untenable and the contradiction inexplicable." ...|$|R
40|$|Although we {{perceive}} a richly detailed visual world, {{our ability to}} identify individual objects is severely limited in clutter, particularly in peripheral vision. Models of such “crowding” have generally been driven by the phenomenological misidentifications of crowded targets: using stimuli that do not easily combine to form a unique symbol (e. g. letters or objects), observers typically confuse the source of objects and report either the target or a distractor, but when continuous features are used (e. g. orientated gratings or line positions) observers report a feature somewhere between the target and distractor. <b>To</b> <b>reconcile</b> these <b>accounts,</b> we develop a hybrid method of adjustment that allows detailed analysis of these multiple error categories. Observers reported the orientation of a target, under several distractor conditions, by adjusting an identical foveal target. We apply new modelling to quantify whether perceptual reports show evidence of positional uncertainty, source confusion, and featural averaging on a trial-by-trial basis. Our results show that observers make {{a large proportion of}} source-confusion errors. However, our study also reveals the distribution of perceptual reports that underlie performance in this crowding task more generally: aggregate errors cannot be neatly labelled because they are heterogeneous and their structure depends on target-distractor distance...|$|R
