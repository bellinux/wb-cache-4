5|$|Attempts by fans {{to write}} in Quenya began in the 1970s, when the total corpus of {{published}} Elvish comprised {{only a few hundred}} words.

As a result, newly invented Elvish texts require conjecture and sometimes the coinage of new words. The use of Quenya has expanded over the years as new words have been created, forming a Neo-Quenya language <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>based</b> on Tolkien's original Quenya but incorporates many new elements.|$|E

5|$|The Drosophila melanogaster genome {{contains}} 29 serpin encoding genes.

Thirteen of the Drosophila serpins occur as isolated genes in the genome (including Serpin-27A, see below), with the remaining 16 organised into five gene clusters that occur at chromosome positions 28D (2 serpins), 42D (5 serpins), 43A (4 serpins), 77B (3 serpins) and 88E (2 serpins).|$|E
