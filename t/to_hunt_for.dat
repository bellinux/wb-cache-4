5|$|Archibald {{and colleagues}} {{suggested}} the life habits of Macabeemyrma ovata {{may have been}} similar to extant Myrmeciinae ants. The ant is large with long legs and elongated mandibles. It presumably had large eyes that were used <b>to</b> <b>hunt</b> <b>for</b> prey and navigation, and the ant was possibly equipped with a sting. Colonies most likely nested in the soil like most other Myrmeciinae, but like some Myrmecia species it is possible they were an arboreal nesting species. Workers were solitary foragers, foraging {{on the ground or}} onto vegetation while preying on arthropods. Workers most likely did not recruit other ants to food sources or lay down pheromone trails.|$|E

5|$|Archibald {{and colleagues}} {{suggested}} the life habits of extinct Myrmeciinae ants including Prionomyrmex {{may have been}} similar to extant ants within the subfamily. These ants foraged {{on the ground and}} possibly onto trees and low vegetation while preying on arthropods. These ants may have collected plant nectar, as Myrmecia species use this as a food source. Workers may have not recruited nest mates to food sources or lay down pheromone trails, as these ants were solitary hunters. Workers would have relied on their vision <b>to</b> <b>hunt</b> <b>for</b> prey and help themselves navigate.|$|E
5|$|The wasps {{preferentially}} {{hunt for}} female cicadas {{because they have}} more consumable tissue, but male cicadas are easier to locate, which explains the systemic bias towards male kills. They chiefly hunt for Tibicen duryi, Tibicen dealbata and Tibicen parallela. Cicada killers are capable of thermoregulation, which allows them <b>to</b> <b>hunt</b> <b>for</b> cicadas during the day, when the cicadas are most prominent. The species is mostly harmless to humans. Some males when emerging early fly into the trees to feed on sap, and the species {{has been known to}} feed on nectar.|$|E
5|$|Archibald {{and colleagues}} {{suggested}} that the behavioural habits for Myrmeciites ants, like that of other extinct Myrmeciinae taxa, may have been similar to its extant relatives. Workers would forage onto trees or vegetation to capture arthropod prey or to feed on nectar, soiling either in the ground or in the trees, making them an arboreal nesting insect. Like other Myrmeciine ants, Myrmeciites most likely did not lay pheromone trails or recruit nestmates to food sources; these ants may have been solitary foragers, relying on their eyes <b>to</b> <b>hunt</b> <b>for</b> prey and for navigational purposes. The nuptial flight of M. (?) tabanifluviensis probably occurred during the late spring or summer, as in extant relatives.|$|E

5|$|At {{the launch}} of the Iraq War dozens of 12-member Special Forces teams {{infiltrated}} southern and western Iraq <b>to</b> <b>hunt</b> <b>for</b> Scud missiles and pinpoint bombing targets. Scores of Navy SEALs seized oil terminals and pumping stations on the southern coast. Air Force combat controllers flew combat missions in MC-130H Combat Talon IIs and established austere desert airstrips to begin the flow of soldiers and supplies deep into Iraq. It {{was a far cry from}} the Persian Gulf war of 1991, where Special Operations forces were kept largely on the sidelines. But it would not be a replay of Afghanistan, where Army Special Forces and Navy SEALs led the fighting. After their star turn in Afghanistan, many special operators were disappointed to play a supporting role in Iraq. Many special operators felt restricted by cautious commanders. From that point, USSOCOM has since killed or captured hundreds of insurgents and Al-Qaeda terrorists. It has conducted several foreign internal defense missions successfully training the Iraqi security forces.|$|E
5|$|Captain Murray {{then took}} Levant {{on a cruise}} <b>to</b> <b>hunt</b> <b>for</b> French or American vessels off Cadiz. While {{pursuing}} this task in June 1779 he ran across the Spanish battle fleet, comprising 32 ships {{of the line and}} two frigates, heading south towards an unknown destination. Spain was still nominally a neutral power and after a brief exchange of pleasantries the Spanish fleet left Levant unmolested and continued on its way. Murray immediately set sail for England to report that the Spanish were at sea, pausing off Land's End on 17 July to capture the French privateer La Revanche. Levant finally reached Portsmouth in late July but by this time Murray's news of the Spanish fleet was out of date; Spain had already declared war on Britain and her fleet had reached Gibraltar to commence an extended siege.|$|E
5|$|Deployed in India, Nolan was {{eventually}} made the regimental riding master and an aide-de-camp to General George Berkeley, commander-in-chief in Madras, accompanying him on horse trials {{to evaluate the}} use of geldings as cavalry mounts rather than stallions, and was made a Captain in 1850. Returning to Great Britain in 1851, he toured continental Europe and wrote two books on horsemanship and cavalry theory, the second of which, Cavalry: Its History and Tactics, was universally acclaimed and led to the adoption of a Nolan-designed saddle by the British Army. A trusted voice on cavalry matters, Nolan was dispatched to the Middle East {{in the early days of}} the Crimean War <b>to</b> <b>hunt</b> <b>for</b> appropriate mounts. After returning he was attached to the staff of General Richard Airey, and in this role delivered the order that led to the Charge of the Light Brigade.|$|E

5|$|HMS Hardy was the {{flotilla}} {{leader for}} the H-class destroyers, built for the Royal Navy in the mid-1930s. During the Spanish Civil War of 1936–1939 the ship spent considerable time in Spanish waters, enforcing the arms blockade imposed by Britain and France {{on both sides of}} the conflict. Hardy was transferred to Freetown, Sierra Leone, in October 1939 <b>to</b> <b>hunt</b> <b>for</b> German commerce raiders in the South Atlantic with Force K. After returning to the United Kingdom in early 1940, the ship became flagship of the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla assigned to the Home Fleet. During the Norwegian campaign of 1940, Hardy participated in the First Battle of Narvik where she sank one German destroyer. As the British ships were withdrawing, they were discovered by two other German destroyers that so badly damaged Hardy that she had to be run aground to stop her from sinking. The ship was lifted by a rising tide and eventually capsized.|$|E
5|$|Hashimoto ordered I-58 northward {{looking for}} {{additional}} ships to attack. She picked up {{reports of the}} atomic bombing of Hiroshima in intercepted radio transmissions on 7 August but Hashimoto continued <b>to</b> <b>hunt</b> <b>for</b> Allied ships south of Bungo Strait. On 9 August she launched two kaitens against a convoy, and Hashimoto claimed a destroyer probably sunk. On 12 August he launched his remaining kaitens and claimed a merchant ship probably sunk. I-58 surfaced in Bungo Strait on 15 August, where Hashimoto learned of the Gyokuon-hōsō signaling the Japanese surrender {{and end of the}} war. She traveled up the Inland Sea and arrived at Hirao where Hashimoto emotionally informed his crew {{of the end of the}} war. After the war, it was confirmed Indianapolis was the only ship I-58 had sunk. It was the last Japanese naval success of World War II. When Hashimoto came home from the war, he learned that his entire family had been killed in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima on 7 August.|$|E
5|$|Hautpoult {{had fought}} hard during the {{engagement}} and was badly damaged, suffering between 80 and 90 casualties. Pompee was also badly damaged, losing nine killed and 30 wounded, including Fahie wounded. Other casualties were suffered on Castor, with one killed and five wounded; Neptune one killed and four wounded and Recruit one wounded. In total, British losses were 11 killed and 40 wounded. Cochrane ordered Pompee {{and the newly}} captured French ship back to port, promoting Napier to command the ship of the line for his service on Recruit and despatching York and Captain <b>to</b> <b>hunt</b> <b>for</b> Troude's remaining squadron. Despite their efforts, Troude evaded pursuit and eventually reached Cherbourg in May. In addition to Napier there were further promotions and awards and Hautpoult was taken into the Royal Navy as HMS Abercromby. Four decades later the battle was among the actions recognised by a clasp attached to the Naval General Service Medal, awarded upon application to all British participants still living in 1847.|$|E

5|$|The {{lesser yellow-headed vulture}} is a {{scavenger}} and subsists {{almost entirely}} on carrion. It will eat roadkill or the carcass of any animal, but is also known <b>to</b> <b>hunt</b> <b>for</b> food, especially small aquatic animals in marshes. It prefers fresh meat, but often cannot make the first cut into the carcass of a larger animal because its beak is {{not strong enough to}} tear into the tough hide. The lesser yellow-headed vulture will no longer feed on a piece of carrion once the meat {{is in a state of}} extreme decay, as it becomes contaminated with microbial toxins. Like other vultures, it plays an important role in its ecosystem by disposing of carrion which would otherwise be a breeding ground for disease.|$|E
5|$|After his release, he {{travelled}} to Schleswig-Holstein to join Baroness Gisela von Donner, {{an earlier}} acquaintance, on her estate {{and lived with}} her three children. During this time, Galland found work as a forestry worker. There he convalesced and came {{to terms with his}} career and alleged knowledge of Nazi war crimes. Galland began <b>to</b> <b>hunt</b> <b>for</b> the family and traded the kills in the local markets to supplement meagre meat rations. Soon Galland rediscovered his love of flying. Kurt Tank, the designer of the Fw 190, requested that he go to his home in Minden to discuss a proposal. Tank had been asked to work for the British and Soviets, and had narrowly avoided being forcibly kidnapped by the latter. Tank, through a contact in Denmark, informed Galland about the possibility of the Argentine Government employing him as a test pilot for Tank’s new generation of fighters. Galland accepted and flew to Argentina. He settled with Gisela in El Palomar, Buenos Aires. Galland enjoyed the slow life. His time there, aside from work commitments, was taken up with Gisela and the active Buenos Aires night life. Galland found South America a world away from post-war shortages of Germany. Soon, he took up gliding again.|$|E
5|$|In 1392 however, Carrouges {{was present}} {{for one of}} the more notorious occurrences in fourteenth century France; the first descent into madness of King Charles VI. As a chevalier d'honneur, Carrouges {{accompanied}} the King on campaign and thus was present when the Royal Army entered Brittany <b>to</b> <b>hunt</b> <b>for</b> Pierre de Craon, a noble who had fled Paris following a failed attempt to murder Olivier de Clisson, Constable of France. As the army passed Le Mans on 8 August 1392, a loud noise within his entourage startled the French King, who believing himself to be under attack, lashed out at the nearest person to him. The man happened to be his brother Louis of Valois, who turned and fled from his brother's sword. Killing several pages who attempted to calm his temper, the King set off on full pursuit of Louis, leaving the army strung out across the countryside behind him. The pursuit continued for hours until the exhausted King was eventually subdued by his bodyguard, including Jean de Carrouges.|$|E

5|$|The Barracudas were {{replaced}} by the Seafires of No. 30 Naval Fighter Wing, which consisted of 801 and 880 Squadrons, on 8 November and the Seafires provided air cover for minelaying operations by escort carriers from 11 to 21 November. The next day, Admiral Sir Henry Ruthven Moore, Commander-in-Chief of the Home Fleet, hoisted his flag in Implacable and the ship set sail <b>to</b> <b>hunt</b> <b>for</b> a convoy that had been reported near Alsten Island (Operation Provident) with the Seafires and Fireflies of 801, 880, and 1771 Squadrons aboard. Bad weather prevented aircraft from being launched until 27 November, but they located the convoy and sank two merchantmen, including , and damaged six others. Upon her return to Scapa on 29 November, Moore lowered his flag, but Vice Admiral Sir Frederick Dalrymple-Hamilton, second in command of Home Fleet, hoisted his flag on 6 December for Operation Urbane, another minelaying operation during which her Fireflies helped to sink a German minesweeper. Dalrymple-Hamilton transferred his flag off Implacable {{when she returned to}} Scapa on 9 December. On 15 December she began a refit at Rosyth preparatory to her transfer to the British Pacific Fleet, which included augmenting her light AA armament.|$|E
5|$|The balloon {{had carried}} {{a lot of}} food, of a kind adapted more for a balloon voyage than for travels on foot. Andrée had {{reasoned}} that {{they might as well}} throw excess food overboard as sand, if losing weight was necessary; and if it was not, the food would serve if wintering in the Arctic desert did after all become necessary. There was therefore less ballast and large amounts of heavy-type provisions, 767kg (1690lb) altogether, including 200liters of water and some crates of champagne, port, beer, etc., donated by sponsors and manufacturers. There was also lemon juice, though not as much of this precaution against scurvy as other polar explorers usually thought necessary. Much of the food was in the form of cans of pemmican, meat, sausages, cheese, and condensed milk. By the time they crashed, they had thrown some of it overboard. The three men took most of the rest with them on leaving the crash site, along with other necessities such as guns, tent, ammunition, and cooking utensils, making a load on each sled of more than 200kg (440lb). This was not realistic, as it broke the sleds and wore out the men. After one week, they sorted out and left behind a big pile of food and non-essential equipment, bringing the loads down to 130kg per sled. It became more necessary than ever <b>to</b> <b>hunt</b> <b>for</b> food. They shot and ate seals, walruses, and especially polar bears throughout the march.|$|E

When his roommate is away one night, Dylan and Kira begin a secret affair. When Dylan overhears Mason and Kira discussing how pitiful he is, Dylan decides to commit suicide. He jumps off a tall building, but survives due to unlikely events. That night, he is visited by a demon who claims he spared Dylan's life. The demon says Dylan must now murder one person for every additional month he wants to live. Dylan convinces himself this was a hallucination, but he begins to grow sick as the end of the month approaches. When the demon appears a second time, Dylan decides to track down a man who molested Dylan's friend when they were children. After shooting him, Dylan's sickness goes away. The next month, Dylan struggles to find another target he feels deserves to die. He settles on a brothel run by a Russian mob. He murders one of the men, but is violently beaten by one of the sex workers before he escapes. His unexplained injuries lead Kira to end their secret romance, although they remain friends. Dylan begins taking boxing lessons and stalking a corrupt businessman.
