Identification of missing persons can be performed either by a direct match with reference samples from personal items, or, as in this thesis, based on calculation of kinship between the missing person and assumed reference relatives. Siblings share between zero and two alleles IBD, while a parent and child will share one, apart from mutations. In the calculations, this and allele frequencies in the population is used. To indicate kinship, the hypothesis that the missing person is related to the reference members is compared to the hypothesis stating that the missing person is unrelated to the known reference members, and the results are presented as a likelihood ratio. This thesis examined how different scenarios <b>will</b> affect <b>the</b> <b>identification</b> of missing persons by use of reference relatives. The accuracy of <b>the</b> <b>identification</b> has been studied by having a different number of reference relatives and genetic markers, and is done {{to be able to say}} what is appropriate so that <b>the</b> <b>identification</b> <b>will</b> be informative.

These techniques would for example be useful to make a better estimation of the coupled dynamics of an engine-generator set (gen-set) on a ship. Large ships are commonly equipped with a gen-set to provide power to the vessels and to the electrical consumers on board.
