40|$|Unit {{tests are}} {{primarily}} written {{as a good}} practice to support software evolution, i. e., to help developers to identify and fix bugs, to refactor code and to serve as documentation for a unit of software under test. To achieve these benefits, unit tests ideally should cover all possible paths in a program. One unit test usually covers one specific path in one function or <b>method.</b> However, a <b>test</b> <b>method</b> is not necessary an encapsulated, independent entity. Often a <b>test</b> <b>method’s</b> coverage is a superset of another <b>test</b> <b>method’s</b> coverage set and thus defects are not well isolated, i. e., one defect causes multiple <b>test</b> <b>methods</b> to fail. In this work we present an approach to automatically migrate JUNIT test classes to JEXAMPLE. JEXAMPLE allows <b>test</b> <b>methods</b> to declare explicit dependencies to other <b>test</b> <b>methods</b> and therefore improves defect isolation. With dynamic analysis we recover the coverage set of each <b>test</b> <b>method</b> and by partially ordering the <b>test</b> <b>methods</b> by means of their coverage sets we derive implicit dependencies between <b>test</b> <b>methods.</b> With program transformation we rewrite the original JUNIT test classes as test classes with explicit dependencies between <b>test</b> <b>methods</b> that can be executed with JEXAMPLE.

RESULTS: The alkali-silica reactivity for those aggregates was verified by chemical test of KS F 2546 and accelerated mortar-bar test of ASTM C 1260. However, it was not by mortar-bar test of KS F 2546 and concrete prism test of ASTM C 1293. CONCLUSIONS: The above results showed that relationship among the four <b>test</b> <b>methods</b> were very low. The results from 3 types of <b>test</b> <b>methods</b> using cement-aggregate combinations appeared to be different. Because the environmental conditions of <b>test</b> <b>methods</b> for measuring the alkali-silica reactivity such as equivalent alkali content(external source), humidity, temperature, and times were different though the aggregates were same.
