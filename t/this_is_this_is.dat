However, the models do not predict the cause of specific development dyslexia - and hence <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> examined in detail. It is conceived of a syndrome in which the major symptoms is difficulty in reading, and this is accompanied by minor symptoms such as speech retardation or defect, motor disorders, perceptual disorders, abnormal lateral preferences, spatial and temporal disorientation. Other factors unusually frequent in the background of specific developmental dyslexics are - adoption, multiple birth, a history of difficult pregnancy or difficult birth, a history of difficult pregnancy or difficult birth or severe illness in early childhood. An hereditary factor is involved in some cases. The cause of specific developmental dyslexia has been ascribed to many malfunctions. Some are inadequate in explaining the facts known about the dundrome - for example, direct emotional causation. The minimal brain damage and the maturational leg hypotheses are retained. It is possible that the two causes are interrelated, in that brain damage causes an inhibition of maturation. A genetic factor could be envisaged to set in either case, in the former being represented as a malformation. (e. g. vascular). It is considered of great importance to institute a screening programme at age five to predict potential reading failure cases and thus give them help from the start of reading. A format for such a programme is suggested. Given maximum opportunity, severe reading problems can be overcome. Given less than this, delinquency often is a result...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Considered to be a children’s {{picture book}} classic, J. M. Barrie’s Peter Pan script and {{subsequent}} versions, including Disney’s platinum boxed DVD set, had their origin in Barrie’s earlier text entitled Little White Bird. This latter text is now recognised as an autobiographical treatise on paedophilia {{in general and}} Barrie’s obsession with one young boy in particular. Literary myth has also suggested that this text appeared in a men’s only magazine, which had paedophiliac leanings, as perhaps the first sealed centrefold. With the exception of Rose’s 1 (1984) brief mention of this foundational essence of evil and a few psychological applications of Barrie’s text as representing some men’s inability to mature psychologically 2 no research {{appears to have been}} undertaken into the transtextual nature of Peter Pan or its existential commentary. Using the principles of visual metaphor (Fitzsimmons 2007) and Lakoff’s (2006) ‘folk theory of language 3, this paper argues that because Peter Pan arose in a context of time and place when the concept of evil had begun to lose it’s religious overtones and in a context of situation when Barrie began to wrestle with what he perceived to be the social epitome of evil. Thus Peter Pan represents a grounded theory of liminality. In other words Barrie’s words are “heavy words lightly thrown ” 4 and although couched in a children’s text represent an untapped definition of evil. Key Words: evil, language use, children’s literature, Peter Pan 1 Conceptual Foundations This paper had its conceptual birth at the 2007 Evil conference when it was discussed at some length {{that the only way to}} effectively describe evil is through the modality of theological discourse. While to a large degree I concurred I could not help but wonder about the other linguistic means through which concepts and ideologies are defined. Off the top of my head I could think of numerous novels that dealt with the double binaries of good and evil. In narrative concepts are not always explicitly defined, as <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the paradigm that uses interplay of metaphor, myth through which we “touch the unspeakable”. 5 In narrative ‘the unspeakable ’ elements and emotions in our lives such as hope, Peter Pan as Evil Escritoire: A children’s classic and the heart of darknes...|$|E
