5|$|Little {{is known}} about <b>the</b> <b>extinction</b> <b>of</b> Plesiorycteropus, but MacPhee assumed it may have {{happened}} around 1000 years ago, when <b>the</b> <b>extinction</b> <b>of</b> {{the rest of the}} subfossil fauna of Madagascar is thought to have concluded. Nothing like it was reported by 17th-century European explorers of the island, and one bone has been radiocarbon dated to around 2150 Before Present (200 BCE). Its extinction is somewhat anomalous, as other recently extinct Madagascan animals—such as subfossil lemurs, Malagasy hippopotamuses, the giant fossa, and elephant birds—were generally larger and not exclusively insectivorous; also, some species with likely more specialized diets, such as the falanouc (Eupleres goudoti) and aye-aye (Daubentonia madagascariensis), did survive. Early human colonists of Madagascar may have caused <b>the</b> <b>extinction</b> <b>of</b> Plesiorycteropus through the destruction of the forest and other disturbances.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>extinction</b> <b>of</b> megalodon set {{the stage}} for further changes in marine communities. The average body size of baleen whales {{increased}} significantly after its disappearance, although possibly due to other, climate-related, causes. Conversely however, the increase in baleen whale size may have contributed to <b>the</b> <b>extinction</b> <b>of</b> megalodon, as they may have preferred to go after smaller whales; bite marks on large whale species may have come from scavenging sharks. Megalodon may have simply become coextinct with smaller whale species, such as Piscobalaena nana. <b>The</b> <b>extinction</b> <b>of</b> megalodon had a positive impact on other apex predators of the time, such as the great white shark, in some cases spreading to regions where megalodon became absent.|$|E
5|$|The {{radiocarbon}} dating of the skeletal remains from 56 Beringian wolves showed a continuous population from over 50,800 YBP until 12,500YBP, followed by one wolf dated at 7,600YBP. This indicates that their population was in decline after 12,500YBP, although megafauna was still available {{in this region}} until 10,500YBP. The timing of this latter specimen {{is supported by the}} recovery of mammoth and horse DNA from sediments dated 10,500 YBP–7,600 YBP from the interior of Alaska. The timing for <b>the</b> <b>extinction</b> <b>of</b> horses in North America and the minimum population size for North American bison coincide with <b>the</b> <b>extinction</b> <b>of</b> an entire wolf haplogroup in North America, indicating that the disappearance of their prey caused <b>the</b> <b>extinction</b> <b>of</b> this wolf ecomorph. This resulted in a significant loss of phenotypic and genetic diversity within the species.|$|E

5|$|Both the Rodrigues {{solitaire}} and the dodo are now extinct. A common {{threshold of}} <b>the</b> <b>extinction</b> <b>of</b> the dodo is 1662, but some possible sightings {{had been made}} as late as 1688. The last sighting with a description was in 1662, but a statistical analysis by Roberts and Solow found that <b>the</b> <b>extinction</b> <b>of</b> the dodo was in 1693. The Rodrigues solitaire was killed off later than the dodo. The IUCN uses an extinction date of 1778 for the solitaire, although a more probable date {{would be in the}} 1750s or 1760s. Both birds became extinct as a consequence of human hunting and the introduction of mammals that ate the birds and their eggs.|$|E
5|$|Cats {{have a high}} {{breeding}} rate. Under controlled breeding, {{they can}} be bred and shown as registered pedigree pets, a hobby known as cat fancy. Failure to control the breeding of pet cats by neutering, {{as well as the}} abandonment of former household pets, has resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, requiring population control. In certain areas outside cats' native range, this has contributed, along with habitat destruction and other factors, to <b>the</b> <b>extinction</b> <b>of</b> many bird species. Cats have been known to extirpate a bird species within specific regions and may have contributed to <b>the</b> <b>extinction</b> <b>of</b> isolated island populations. Cats are thought to be primarily responsible for <b>the</b> <b>extinction</b> <b>of</b> 33 species of birds, and the presence of feral and free-ranging cats makes some otherwise suitable locations unsuitable for attempted species reintroduction.|$|E
5|$|Reductions in {{the size}} of host populations may cause a {{long-lasting}} reduction of louse taxonomic richness, for example, birds introduced into New Zealand host fewer species of lice there than in Europe. Louse sex ratios are more balanced in more social hosts and more female-biased in less social hosts, presumably due to the stronger isolation among louse subpopulations (living on separate birds) in the latter case. <b>The</b> <b>extinction</b> <b>of</b> a species results in <b>the</b> <b>extinction</b> <b>of</b> its host-specific lice. Host-switching is a random event that would seem very rarely likely to be successful, but speciation has occurred over evolutionary time-scales so it must be successfully accomplished sometimes.|$|E

In order to correct for the effect <b>of</b> dimer absorption, <b>the</b> <b>extinction</b> coefficient <b>of</b> N 2 O 4 has also been measured. The effect of a decrease in temperature on NO 2 absorption is a reduction in <b>the</b> <b>extinction</b> coefficient <b>of</b> approximately 10 % in the range from 320 to 380 nm...|$|R
50|$|Johnson and Wroe {{observed}} {{the relationship between}} the dingo and <b>the</b> <b>extinctions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tasmanian devil, the thylacine, and the Tasmanian native hen and the arrival of humans. The paper documented the obviously competitive relationship between the dingo, the thylacine and the Tasmanian devil, and noted that the dingo may have actually fed on the native hen. Yet, the paper concludes, people ignore the emergence of humans on the continent among all of this. In the end, the competitiveness of the dingo and thylacine populations led to <b>the</b> <b>extinctions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thylacine, but the arrival of the humans only further exacerbated this.|$|R
50|$|Often a {{subpopulation}} of {{a species}} {{will also be a}} subspecies.

5|$|At {{the close}} of the Ice Age, with the loss of cold and dry {{conditions}} and <b>the</b> <b>extinction</b> <b>of</b> much of its prey, the Beringian wolf became extinct. <b>The</b> <b>extinction</b> <b>of</b> its prey has been attributed to the impact of climate change, competition with other species, including humans, or a combination of both factors. Local genetic populations were replaced by others from within the same species or of the same genus. Of the North American wolves, only the ancestor of the modern North American gray wolf survived. The remains of ancient wolves with similar skulls and dentition have been found in western Beringia (north-east Siberia). In 2016 a study showed that some of the wolves now living in remote corners of China and Mongolia share a common maternal ancestor with one 28,000-year-old eastern Beringian wolf specimen.|$|E
40|$|Published {{evidence}} for <b>the</b> human-mediated <b>extinction</b> <b>of</b> megafauna is examined and {{is found to}} be unsubstantiated. It is shown that the claimed evidence is not based on data describing the growth of human population but on the fabricated data. However, even these fabricated data, which were claimed to support <b>the</b> human-induced <b>extinction</b> <b>of</b> megafauna, contradict this claim. The belief in <b>the</b> human-induced <b>extinction</b> <b>of</b> megafauna appears to be so strong that even contradicting evidence based on the fabricated data is interpreted as the evidence supporting this belief.
