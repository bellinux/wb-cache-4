5|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1907, Baden-Powell went on an {{extensive}} speaking tour arranged by his publisher, Arthur Pearson, to promote his forthcoming book, Scouting for Boys. He had not simply rewritten his Aids to Scouting; he omitted <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>aspects</b> and transferred the techniques (mainly survival) to non-military heroes: backwoodsmen, explorers (and later on, sailors and airmen). He also added innovative educational principles (the Scout method) by which he extended the attractive game to a personal mental education.|$|E
5|$|The revisionist {{tradition}} {{continues to}} the present time, through popular history books, web sites and wargames. New titles appear every year, propagating the myths first put forth by HIAG's propaganda efforts. Some of the books are amateur historical studies that focus solely on <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>aspects</b> of the Waffen-SS. Others are reprints of apologetic accounts by former Waffen-SS personnel. Adding to the volume of material are groups of international admirers who consider Waffen-SS to have been incorrectly judged by history.|$|E

50|$|As in {{the case}} of {{national}} power, <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>aspect</b> of security is an important, but not the sole, component of national security. To be truly secure, a nation needs other forms of security. Authorities differ in their choice of nation security elements. Besides <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>aspect</b> of security, <b>the</b> aspects of diplomacy or politics; society; environment; energy and natural resources; and economics are commonly listed. The elements of national security correlate closely to the concept of the elements of national power. Romm (1993) lists security from narcotic cartels, economic security, environmental security and energy security as the non-military elements of national security.|$|R
5|$|Responsibility {{for nuclear}} power {{and nuclear weapons}} was {{transferred}} from the Manhattan District to the United States Atomic Energy Commission on 1 January 1947. On 29 January 1947, Secretary of War Robert P. Patterson and Secretary of the Navy James V. Forrestal issued a joint directive creating the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project (AFSWP) to control <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>aspects</b> of nuclear weapons. Groves was appointed its chief on 28 February 1947. In April, AFSWP moved from the New War Department Building to the fifth floor of the Pentagon. Groves had already made a start on the new mission by creating Sandia Base in 1946.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Groves {{remained}} {{in charge of}} the Manhattan Project until responsibility for nuclear weapons production was handed over to the United States Atomic Energy Commission in 1947. He then headed the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project, which had been created to control <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>aspects</b> of nuclear weapons. He was given a dressing down by the Chief of Staff of the United States Army, General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower, and told that he would never be appointed Chief of Engineers. Three days later, Groves announced his intention to leave the Army. He was promoted to lieutenant general just before his retirement on 29 February 1948 in recognition of his leadership of the bomb program. By a special Act of Congress, his date of rank was backdated to 16 July 1945, the date of the Trinity nuclear test. He {{went on to become a}} vice-president at Sperry Rand.|$|E

25|$|In 1995–96, a NATO-led {{international}} {{peacekeeping force}} (IFOR) of 60,000 troops served in Bosnia and Herzegovina, beginning on December 21, 1995 to implement and monitor <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>aspects</b> of the Dayton Peace Agreement. IFOR was succeeded by a smaller, NATO-led Stabilization Force or SFOR. The number of SFOR troops was reduced first to 12,000 {{and then to}} 7,000.

FARC operatives that participate in these units usually are also intellectuals which can concentrate in studying military science, as another part of their service is to introduce newer weapons to the guerrilla group. The regular training given to all the FARC's commanders at certain ranks includes an overview of the new strategies and weapons found to be useful in the war.|$|E
25|$|Defeat meant {{acceptance}} of Union {{and the search}} for an identity that was Unionist but also uniquely Scottish. One aspect was converting Highlanders from half-naked savages into a noble warrior race. For decades before 1745, rural poverty drove many to enlist in European armies but while military experience was common, <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>aspects</b> of clanship itself had been in decline for many years. Foreign service was banned after 1745 and recruitment into the British Army accelerated as deliberate policy. Britain was at war for 43 of the years between 1756 and 1815 with Scotland providing disproportionate numbers of recruits. During Empire, British policy makers focused recruiting on a small number of so-called 'martial races,' a category including Highlanders, Sikhs, Dogras and Gurkhas. In many ways, this view remains with us today.|$|E

25|$|The meeting {{took place}} on 19 July in the villa of Senator Achille Gaggia in Feltre, near Belluno. There Mussolini, Bastianini and Ambrosio met with Hitler and the generals of the OKW to discuss the {{situation}} and the possible countermeasures. The German delegation was full of generals, but neither Goering nor Ribbentrop were present, showing that the Germans were focusing on <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>aspects</b> of the situation. Ambrosio prepared for the meeting meticulously, and the day before spoke plainly to Mussolini, telling him that his duty was to exit {{the war in the}} next 15 days. The Germans, on the other hand, had lost faith in the Italians and were only interested in occupying northern and central Italy, leaving the Italian army alone to defend the country from the Allies. Moreover, they proposed that the Axis supreme command in the peninsula be taken over by a German general (possibly Rommel). The first two hours of the meeting were as usual a monologue by Hitler, blaming the Italians for their weak military performance and asking for draconian measures: Mussolini was unable to speak a word. The meeting was suddenly interrupted when an Italian aide came into the room and told Mussolini that at that moment the Allies were for the first time heavily bombing Rome. During the lunch pause, Ambrosio and Bastianini pressed the Duce to tell Hitler that for Italy a political solution to the war was necessary, but Mussolini replied that he had been tormented for months by the dilemma of leaving the alliance or continuing the war: in reality, Mussolini could not overcome the sense of inferiority he felt in the presence of Hitler , and did not have the courage to speak frankly with his German colleague.|$|E
500|$|Nichols {{remained}} with the Manhattan Project {{after the war}} until it {{was taken over by}} the Atomic Energy Commission in 1947. He was the military liaison officer with the Atomic Energy Commission [...] from 1946 to 1947. After briefly teaching at the United States Military Academy at West Point, he was promoted to major general and became chief of the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project, responsible for <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>aspects</b> of atomic weapons, including logistics, handling and training. He was Deputy Director for the Atomic Energy Matters, Plans and Operations Division of the Army's general staff, and was the senior Army member of the military liaison committee that worked with the Atomic Energy Commission.|$|E
500|$|Manstein gave {{testimony}} {{at the main}} Nuremberg trials of war criminals in August 1946, and prepared a paper that, along with his later memoirs, helped cultivate the myth of a [...] "clean Wehrmacht"—the myth that the German armed forces were not culpable for the atrocities of the Holocaust. In 1949 he was tried in Hamburg for war crimes and was convicted on nine of seventeen counts, including the poor treatment of prisoners of war and failing to protect civilian lives in his sphere of operations. His sentence of eighteen years in prison was later reduced to twelve, and he served only four years before being released in 1953. As a military advisor to the West German government in the mid-1950s, he helped re-establish the armed forces. His memoir, Verlorene Siege (1955), translated into English as Lost Victories, was highly critical of Hitler's leadership, and only dealt with <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>aspects</b> of the war, ignoring its political and ethical contexts. Manstein died in Munich in 1973.|$|E

500|$|Architectural {{research}} in the late 20th and early 21st centuries focused less on <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>aspects</b> of the fortifications, however, and more on their roles as luxurious palaces and symbols of royal power. Each of the castles {{was designed to be}} suitable to support the royal court, should it visit. In the late 13th century, this meant having several sets of private chambers, discreet service facilities and security arrangements, producing, in effect, a royal palace in miniature. Some of these survive largely intact; Conwy, for example, has what historian Jeremy Ashbee considers to be the [...] "best preserved suite of medieval private royal chambers in England and Wales", including a private garden {{for the use of the}} queen. When built, the castles would have been more colourful than today, in keeping with the fashions of the 13th century. At Conwy, for example, the walls were white-washed with a lime render, and the putlog holes in the walls may have been used to display painted shields called targes from the walls.|$|E
500|$|In November 1934, Walker, now {{a student}} at the Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth, testified with Robert Olds, Claire Chennault, Donald Wilson, Harold George and Robert Webster on <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>aspects</b> of {{aviation}} before the Howell Commission on Federal Aviation. All were current or former instructors at the Air Corps Tactical School, and all except Chennault were part of the Bomber Mafia. They argued for an independent air force, in contradiction to Army doctrine. Walker told the commission: [...] "unless we create an adequate and separate Air Force, this next war 'will begin in the air and end in the mud'-in the mud and debris of the demolished industries that have brought us to our knees." [...] They were unable to persuade the commission to recommend an independent air force, although it did agree that the Air Corps should be granted greater autonomy within the Army. The commission concluded that [...] "there is ample reason to believe that aircraft have now passed far beyond their former position as useful auxiliaries... An adequate striking force for use against objectives both near and remote is a necessity for a modern army".|$|E
500|$|The Special Weapons Office was {{abolished}} in November 1946, and the Manhattan Project {{followed suit}} {{at the end}} of the year. A civilian agency, the United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), was created by the Atomic Energy Act of 1946 to take over the functions and assets of the Manhattan Project, including development, production and control of nuclear weapons. The law provided for a Military Liaison Committee (MLC) to advise the AEC on military matters, and Parsons became a member. A joint Army-Navy organization, the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project (AFSWP), was created to handle <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>aspects</b> of nuclear weapons. Groves was appointed to command the AFSWP, with Parsons and Air Force Major General Roscoe C. Wilson as his deputies. In this capacity, Parsons pressed for the development of improved nuclear weapons. During the Operation Sandstone series of nuclear weapon tests at Enewetak Atoll in 1948, Parsons once again served as deputy commander. Parsons hoped that his next posting would be to sea, but he was instead sent to the Weapons Systems Evaluation Group in 1949. He finally returned to sea duty in 1951, this time as Commander, Cruiser Division 6, despite having never commanded a ship. Parsons and his cruisers conducted a tour of the Mediterranean [...] He then became Deputy Chief of the Bureau of Ordnance in March 1952.|$|E

500|$|Cornwallis's predecessor, John Macpherson, had {{authorised}} {{negotiations with}} the sultan of Kedah {{for the establishment of}} a company trading post on the island of Penang. [...] Captain Francis Light, a trader familiar with the East Indies, negotiated an agreement in which the sultan, who was surrounded by powerful adversaries, received a share of the trade profits and a defensive military alliance in exchange for Penang. [...] Captain Light made representations to the sultan that the company had agreed to these terms, and occupied the island in August 1786. [...] Cornwallis, concerned that <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>aspects</b> of the agreement might draw the company into conflicts with the sultan's adversaries or the Dutch, withheld approval of the agreement and requested the company's directors to decide the issue. [...] When the company refused the military alliance, the sultan began blockading the island, renamed Prince of Wales Island by Light, and started in 1790 to accumulate troops with the view toward forcibly evicting the British. Cornwallis's brother William, then with the Royal Navy in the area, sailed from Penang to pick up troops in India for its defence. Captain Light, however, routed the sultan's forces in April 1791 before those reinforcements arrived. An agreement was then signed in which the company paid the sultan an annual stipend for the use of Penang. [...] The fort that Captain Light constructed to protect Penang's principal town, George Town, became known as Fort Cornwallis in the earl's honour.|$|E
