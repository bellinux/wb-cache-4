5|$|The 1991 Yugoslav {{campaign}} in Croatia {{was a series}} of engagements between the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA), the Yugoslav Navy and the Yugoslav Air Force, and <b>the</b> <b>Croatian</b> National Guard (ZNG) then <b>the</b> <b>Croatian</b> Army (HV) during <b>the</b> <b>Croatian</b> War of Independence. The JNA was originally deployed in order to preserve Yugoslavia, and the initial plan of the campaign entailed the military occupation of Croatia and the removal of <b>the</b> <b>Croatian</b> leadership elected in 1990. The JNA intervention was the culmination of its involvement in the confiscation of weapons from Croatia's Territorial Defence, and in <b>the</b> <b>Croatian</b> Serb revolt that had begun in August 1990. From that time, the JNA had been frequently deployed to form a buffer zone between the insurgents and the ZNG or <b>the</b> <b>Croatian</b> police. In effect, these JNA buffer zones often secured the territorial gains of the insurgents and led to an increasingly hostile relationship between the JNA and Croatia. The JNA campaign plan was amended shortly before the campaign to include the relief of JNA barracks besieged by the ZNG. The besieging and subsequent capture of several JNA facilities allowed Croatia to arm its previously poorly equipped military and to equip new recruits.|$|E
5|$|The Hungarian {{government}} recognised Croats as {{a minority}} native to Hungary; it has decided to implement the optional regulations of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages with respect to <b>the</b> <b>Croatian</b> language and establish a minority self-government for <b>the</b> <b>Croatian</b> minority in Hungary, guaranteeing cultural autonomy. <b>The</b> <b>Croatian</b> minority set up 127 local and 7 county self-governments in Hungary. There are concerns that Croatian minority rights in Hungary are being diminished, but the president of Croatia has assessed that both Croatian and Hungarian minority policies were appropriate. <b>The</b> <b>Croatian</b> minority in Hungary is particularly active in Pécs, where the Scientific Institute of Croats in Hungary and <b>the</b> <b>Croatian</b> Theatre have been established.|$|E
5|$|Tuđman's stance was {{motivated}} by his belief that Croatia could not win a war against the JNA.

5|$|After World War II, Croatia {{became a}} one-party Socialist federal {{unit of the}} Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Croatia was ruled by the Communists and enjoyed a degree of {{autonomy}} within the Yugoslav federation. In 1967, a group of Croatian authors and linguists published the Declaration on the Status and Name of <b>the</b> <b>Croatian</b> Literary Language, demanding greater autonomy for <b>the</b> <b>Croatian</b> language. The declaration contributed to a national movement seeking greater civil rights and decentralization of the Yugoslav economy, culminating in <b>the</b> <b>Croatian</b> Spring of 1971, which was suppressed by Yugoslav leadership. The 1974 Yugoslav Constitution gave increased autonomy to federal units, essentially fulfilling a goal of <b>the</b> <b>Croatian</b> Spring and providing a legal basis for independence of the federative constituents.|$|E
40|$|Purpose of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} and compare differences in oral health awareness between Croatian and Italian urban adolescents. The sample consisted of primary school last grade students aged between 13 and 15 years, 300 children from Zagreb (Croatia) and 298 children from Bari (Italy). Oral health awareness was evaluated using a self-administered standardized questionnaire. Self-perception of oral health proved to be different between the two groups (p< 0. 001). <b>The</b> <b>Croatians</b> reported that their oral health was »excellent« or »very-good« more often than the Italians (68. 6 % vs. 50. 2 %). The reasons given for visiting a dentist were different (p< 0. 001). The Italians cleaned their teeth more often than <b>the</b> <b>Croatians</b> (»two or more times a day«, 83. 1 % vs. 72. 2 %, p< 0. 003). Wooden toothpicks were preferred by <b>the</b> <b>Croatians</b> (p< 0. 001), while floss was preferred by the Italians (p= 0. 03). The awareness regarding the use of fluoridated toothpaste was higher in the Italian group (95. 6 % vs. 72. 5 %, p< 0. 001). <b>The</b> <b>Croatians</b> were consuming sweetened foods more often than the Italians (p< 0. 001). Croatian adolescents reported more indicators of a lower level of oral health awareness than the Italians, while on <b>the</b> contrary <b>Croatians</b> had higher esteem of their oral health. Defining national preventive strategies is essential for improving adolescents’ attitudes toward oral health in both countries, particularly in Croatia...|$|R
