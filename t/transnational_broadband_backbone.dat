40|$|This {{research}} {{looks into}} {{the impact of the}} National ICT <b>broadband</b> <b>backbone</b> in Tanzania which was launched in July 23 rd, 2009. The National ICT <b>broadband</b> <b>backbone</b> has been managed and operated by Tanzania Telecommunications Company Limited since its launch up to now. The research will look on the types of contracts entered between telecommunications operators/ ISPs and Tanzania Telecommunication Company Limited (TTCL) during the lease of the bandwidth. It will also focus on the policies if any and regulations related to the lease of the bandwidth from the National ICT <b>broadband</b> <b>backbone</b> as provided by the Tanzania Communication Regulatory Authority. The researcher will suggest on what to be done and what type of policies to be made so as to act as the guidance between both broadband service providers and customers in leasing of the bandwidth. The researcher will also look on the National ICT <b>broadband</b> <b>backbone</b> present in other countries and compare the type of service from those countries and Tanzania. Policies from other countries will also be compared to policies in Tanzania. If policies in Tanzania do not exist, suggestion on new policies will be given based on the existing policies in other countries with amendments for them to be suitable to be used in Tanzania. The research will discuss on different papers provided by the International Telecommunication Union on the issue and how it guides regulatory authorities of different countries in providing such service in general. Finally the researcher will look into the economic benefits that the National ICT <b>broadband</b> <b>backbone</b> provides in Tanzania and other countries as large. The research will be divided in a total of five chapters which are context of the study, literature review, research methodologies, recommendations, and summary and conclusions...|$|R

Basically, shared VSAT IP service, such as Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB) service {{seems to be}} the favorite low cost solution for <b>broadband</b> IP satellite <b>backbone</b> compared to the more costly Single Channel Per Carrier (SCPC). Answers to questions, such as typical configurations providing the service, will be described. Some of these services may be run without any government license.

40|$|The {{vision of}} the Tanzanian {{national}} ICT policy is for “Tanzania to become a hub of ICT infrastructure and ICT solutions that enhance sustainable socio-economic development and accelerate poverty reduction both nationally and globally”. To achieve this, Tanzanian National ICT <b>Broadband</b> <b>Backbone</b> (NICTBB) is being constructed using optical fibre technology that will connect all its regions and districts, giving them access to the 10, 000 km-length national and regional broadband infrastructure {{as well as to}} the undersea fibre cables landing on its shores. Innovations in <b>broadband</b> <b>backbone</b> coupled with optical fiber technology have lowered the costs of providing ICT services to virtually any location, for example from an inner-city neighborhood to a rural village or to remote areas in other places of the world. In this study, quantitative and qualitative research have been applied to analyze data obtained from interviews, questionnaires and publications in order to assess the economic benefits and challenges of NICTBB since it became operational. Despite the economic benefits of NICTBB, the study found that there is still a role for the Tanzanian government to provide last mile connectivity solutions for rural areas to enable people to access the internet via the NICTBB, as well as to educate them on how to exploit and use broadband for economic development. Since constructing the NICTBB is only the first step toward realizing the potential benefits from broadband access, government should now ensure that it is accessible and affordable to rural area people so that majority of Tanzanians can be effective in utilizing the backbone in their daily activities, thereby enhancing economic development...|$|R

In 1997, the Singapore General Hospital installed a <b>broadband</b> <b>backbone</b> even before the technology was generally viable. Today, the system supports the transmission of high-quality X-rays, CT- and MRI-scanned images, and electrocardiogram. And the latest decision is to supplement the existing facilities with wireless technology.

30|$|While {{cognitive}} approaches have already widely {{been applied to}} WSNs, they are usually used for spectrum-sensing purposes[18, 19], rather than for signal quality feedback, which is done in this article. Spectrum sensing {{is the process of}} recording the occupation of the different frequency bands and the variation of this occupation over time. Knowledge of the (un)occupied frequency bands allows choosing the frequency band that is most suited for packet transmission. A holistic approach to cognition and a framework that can help achieve end-to-end goals of application-specific sensor networks is provided in[20]. In[21], models and algorithms for self-optimization are presented, in networks that are interconnected through a <b>broadband</b> wireless mesh <b>backbone</b> network. An architectural approach is followed, where positions of backbone and terminal nodes are optimized for very large networks (e.g., 50 [*]×[*] 50 [*]km 2). The self-optimization is based on a mathematical model and uses flocking algorithms and particle swarm optimization, a relatively slow-converging optimization method.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Wireless mesh {{networks}} hold {{promises to}} provide robust and high-throughput data delivery to wireless users. In a mesh network, high-speed Access Points (HAPs), equipped with advanced antennas, {{communicate with each}} other over wireless channels and form an indoor/outdoor <b>broadband</b> backhaul. This <b>backbone</b> efficiently forwards user traffic to a few gateway APs (GAPs), which additionally have high-speed connections to the wired Internet. In this paper, we describe ROMER, a resilient and opportunistic routing solution for mesh networks. ROMER balances between long-term route stability and shortterm opportunistic performance. It builds a runtime, forwarding mesh on a per-packet basis that offers a set of candidate routes. The actual forwarding path by each packet opportunistically adapts to the dynamic channel condition and exploits the highestrate wireless channels at the time. To improve resilience against lossy links, HAP failures or HAPs under DoS attacks, ROMER delivers redundant data copies in a controlled and randomized manner over the candidate forwarding mesh. We evaluate the effectiveness of ROMER through both simulations and analysis. I...|$|R
40|$|The {{incredible}} {{explosion of}} ICT (Information and Communication Technology) field we assisted to {{during the last}} few years deeply influenced our life from many points of view, from our daily habits to the way of communicating to other peoples. A lot of telecommunication companies flourished, offering a continuously increasing number of heterogeneous services and researching new technologies to convey them. Services and technologies have been growing jointly: every new idea for a new service involved the adoption of a new technology to can support it. On the other hand the achievement of new network technologies opened the way to innovative as unpredictable services. Until some years ago data and voice were conceived as two separated service categories: the former carried out with a packet switched approach, the latter with a circuit switched one. Thanks to higher bandwidth rates reached by later technologies, it has been possible to integrate data and voice on the same network backbone using a packet switched technique. At the same time, users began to getting familiar with new available solutions such as VoIP and video conference, also forcing access networks to evolve themselves. Many wired solutions (xDSL family, optical fibres) were proposed to face increasing bandwidth requests, offering digital transmissions to users. Moreover, the low prices of network devices modified the communication idea: cabled local area network (LAN) became very popular like a way to interconnect PC or to share common utility devices. The main drawback in these scenarios is the big effort in term of time and money not only in cabling set up phase, but also in case of a new node addition. In spite of wired solutions, wireless communication systems has a number of advantages, not least the mobility of the devices within the environment and the connectivity for rural areas not reached by wired infrastructures. As regards the first aspect, we can talk about the employment of WiFi technology in Local Area Network. It is a simple matter to relocate a communicating device, and no additional cost of rewiring and excessive downtime is associated with such a move. It is also a simple matter to add in a communication device to the system or remove one from the system without any disruption to the remainder of the system itself. Other than the initial outlay on setting up the cell sites, the cost of running and maintaining a radio based communication solution is minimal. These, and other factors, show the appeal that a radio communication system has for the office environment. Taking into account the second aspect, we can focus on the employment of WiMAX technology in Metropolitan Area Network. Just as Wi-Fi is based on the IEEE 802. 11 standard, WiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access) systems are based on the IEEE 802. 16 standard, whose first version was approved in 2001 to define high-speed wireless service to stationary sites over distances up to 50 kilometers, while the maximum range for Wi-Fi is a few hundred meters. One reason for WiMAX's greater range is that it can transmit at higher power levels, depending on the radio band. WiMAX has the capability to run at 75 Mbps - many times the speed of digital subscriber lines (DSL) - but this capacity will usually be divided among many users. WiMAX was conceived to provide the same kind of fast Internet service afforded by DSL, cable modem and even fiber-optic systems. For this reason, it has also been called Wireless MAN (MAN stands for "metropolitan-area network"). The ability to provide these broadband connections wirelessly, without laying wire or cable in the ground, greatly lowers the cost to provide these services. So, WiMAX may change the economics for any place where the cost of laying or upgrading landlines to broadband capacity is prohibitively expensive, as in emerging countries. In countries like India, Mexico and China, for instance, where wired infrastuctures are currently insufficient or lacking, WiMAX can become part of the <b>broadband</b> <b>backbone.</b> The first version of the standard 802. 16 was followed by three amendments 802. 16 a, 802. 16 b and 802. 16 c to address issues of radio spectrum, quality of service and inter-operability respectively. This project ended in 2004 with the release of 802. 16 - 2004 [1] and the withdrawal of the earlier 802. 16 documents including the a/b/c amendments. Despite the technology's origins, the WiMAX community more recently began to work on a mobile version of the standard, called IEEE 802. 16 e, which is popularly known as mobile WiMAX. Like Wi-Fi, it is intended to provide service to laptop computers and other mobile devices, but it will have greater range, probably up to a few kilometers...|$|R
