5|$|The RAAF played eight matches for the season, winning {{four and}} losing the rest. Miller's top score was 141 in faster-than-even time against Public School Wanderers at Hove. He {{went on to}} play for Dominions, a {{composite}} team from the British Commonwealth, in a two-day match against England in August, scoring 32 and two and bowling a total of eight overs for 46 runs without taking a wicket. England fielded a team of almost <b>Test</b> <b>standard,</b> with six capped Test players and four others who made their debut immediately after the resumption of international cricket following the war. The match marked the first meeting between Miller and his good friend, England batsman Denis Compton. In their first battle at the crease, Miller aimed a short ball that took off past Compton's shoulder and went for four byes. By {{the end of his}} season, Miller's bowling began to attract media attention. He ended the season in a match at Lord's between the airmen: the RAAF against the RAF. Miller took 3/23 and scored 91 in the RAAF's total of 8/164. None of the matches during the 1943 season were accorded first-class status.|$|E

25|$|Worcestershire were so weak {{the club}} could not {{compete in the}} Championship in 1919, and their form in 1920 – when they lost three {{successive}} games by an innings and over 200 runs – was probably the worst of any county side. Their form, with one remarkable exception, was woeful up to the early thirties. Fred Root, {{one of the first}} exponents of leg theory bowling, took over 1,500 wickets for the county and was a <b>Test</b> <b>standard</b> player in an otherwise fourth-rate team. In Cyril Walters and the Nawab of Pataudi the team acquired its first class batsmen since the Fosters, but both had to give up the game after playing brilliantly in 1933 – when the bowling was briefly very weak.|$|E
25|$|On 18 January 2006, Zimbabwe Cricket {{announced}} that they were suspending the playing of Test cricket {{for the rest of}} the year. Zimbabwe's coach Kevin Curran said that Zimbabwe were aiming to play their next Test against the West Indies in November 2007. It was felt by observers that the Zimbabwean national team was not of sufficient <b>Test</b> <b>standard,</b> and that competing against Full Member sides would do little to improve standards, given the likely one-sided nature of the games. Bangladesh, for a long time seen as the 'whipping boys' of Test cricket, recorded their first win against Zimbabwe, and were thereafter regarded as being of a superior standard. On 8 August 2011, Zimbabwe recorded a resounding victory in the one Test match series over Bangladesh, played in Harare.|$|E
25|$|A typical Test match stadium {{would be}} larger than these defined minimums, with over 20,000 square yards of grass (having a {{straight}} boundary of about 80m). In contrast an association football field needs only about 9,000 square yards of grass, and an Olympic stadium would contain 8350 square yards of grass within its 400m running track, {{making it difficult to}} play international cricket in stadiums not built for the purpose. Nevertheless, Stadium Australia which hosted the Sydney Olympics in 2000 had its running track turfed over with 30,000 seats removed to make it possible to play cricket there, at a cost of A$80million. This {{is one of the reasons}} cricket games generally cannot be hosted outside the traditional cricket-playing countries, and a few non-Test nations like Canada, the UAE and Kenya that have built <b>Test</b> <b>standard</b> stadiums.|$|E

500|$|The current {{scoring method}} for all IQ tests is the [...] "deviation IQ". In this method, an IQ score of 100 {{means that the}} test-taker's {{performance}} on the test is at the median level of performance in the sample of test-takers of {{about the same age}} used to norm the test. An IQ score of 115 means performance one standard deviation above the median, a score of 85 performance one standard deviation below the median, and so on. Lewis Terman and other early developers of IQ tests noticed that most child IQ scores come out to approximately the same number by either procedure. Deviation IQs are now used for standard scoring of all IQ tests in large part because they allow a consistent definition of IQ for both children and adults. By the current [...] "deviation IQ" [...] definition of IQ <b>test</b> <b>standard</b> scores, about two-thirds of all test-takers obtain scores from 85 to 115, and about 5 percent of the population scores above 125.|$|E
2500|$|Brown {{performed}} inconsistently in {{the remainder}} of his career after 1947 and never quite reached <b>Test</b> <b>standard,</b> but he occasionally produced an outstanding innings to delimit [...] "periods of comparative failure". Whenever he scored a century, it tended to be a [...] "large one" [...] (i.e., 150-plus) that would {{have a significant impact on}} the outcome of the match. Wisden described his matchwinning 150* against Glamorgan in 1948 as [...] "a masterly achievement and technically correct". In 1949, he scored his first double-century, exactly 200, against Kent at Canterbury. 1951 was his second-best season with nearly 1,700 runs and his highest score against Somerset. In 1955, aged 37, he completed 1,000 runs for the ninth time, but his season's average was down to 22.57 and he decided, perhaps rightly in Wisden's view, to retire there and then. Brown had a successful benefit in 1953 and, after his retirement from cricket, became a publican.|$|E

2500|$|Karl Pearson was {{important}} in {{the founding of the}} school of biometrics, which was a competing theory to describe evolution and population inheritance {{at the turn of the}} 20th century. His series of eighteen papers, [...] "Mathematical Contributions to the Theory of Evolution" [...] established him as the founder of the biometrical school for inheritance. In fact, Pearson devoted much time during 1893 to 1904 to developing statistical techniques for biometry. These techniques, which are widely used today for statistical analysis, include the chi-squared <b>test,</b> <b>standard</b> deviation, and correlation and regression coefficients. Pearson's Law of Ancestral Heredity stated that germ plasm consisted of heritable elements inherited from the parents as well as from more distant ancestors, the proportion of which varied for different traits. Karl Pearson was a follower of Galton, and although the two differed in some respects, Pearson used a substantial amount of Francis Galton's statistical concepts in his formulation of the biometrical school for inheritance, such as the law of regression. The biometric school, unlike the Mendelians, focused not on providing a mechanism for inheritance, but rather on providing a mathematical description for inheritance that was not causal in nature. While Galton proposed a discontinuous theory of evolution, in which species would have to change via large jumps rather than small changes that built up over time, Pearson pointed out flaws in Galton's argument and actually used Galton's ideas to further a continuous theory of evolution, whereas the Mendelian's favored a discontinuous theory of evolution. While Galton focused primarily on the application of statistical methods to the study of heredity, Pearson and his colleague Weldon expanded statistical reasoning to the fields of inheritance, variation, correlation, and natural and sexual selection.|$|E

40|$|The {{blast wave}} emanating from an {{explosion}} produces an almost instantaneous rise in pressure which can then cause Blast Overpressure (BOP) injuries to nearby persons. BOP injury criteria are specified in <b>test</b> <b>standards</b> to relate BOP measurements in a testing environment to {{a risk of}} BOP injury. This study considered the adequacy of <b>test</b> <b>standards</b> in evaluating BOP protection concepts for the torso. Four potential BOP injury scenarios were studied to determine the likelihood of injury and the adequacy of <b>test</b> <b>standards</b> for appropriate protection concepts. In the case of vehicle blast, BOP injury is unlikely and <b>test</b> <b>standards</b> are adequate. In the scenario involving an explosive charge detonated within a vehicle, and the close proximity to a hand grenade scenario, <b>test</b> <b>standards</b> are not available. The demining scenario was identified as of importance as <b>test</b> <b>standards</b> are available, but do not mandate the evaluation of BOP protection. A prototype South African Torso Surrogate (SATS) was developed to explore this scenario further. The SATS was required to be relatively inexpensive and robust. The SATS was cast from silicone (selected to represent body tissue characteristics) using a torso mould containing a steel frame and instrumented with chest face-on pressure transducer and accelerometer. The SATS was subjected to an Anti-Personnel (AP) mine test and the Chest Wall Velocity Predictor and Viscous Criterion were used to predict that BOP injuries would occur in a typical demining scenario. This result was confirmed by applying the injury criteria to empirical blast predictions from the Blast Effects Calculator Version 4 (BECV 4). Although limitations exist {{in the ability of}} injury criteria and measurement methods to accurately predict BOP injuries, generally a conservative approach should be taken. Thus, it is recommended that the risk of BOP injuries should be evaluated in demining personal protective equipment <b>test</b> <b>standards...</b>|$|R
