5000|$|The chorda tympani nerve carries its {{information}} to {{the nucleus of the}} solitary tract, and shares this area with the greater superficial petrosal and glossopharyngeal nerves. When the greater superficial petrosal and glossopharyngeal nerves are cut, regardless of age, the chorda tympani nerve takes over the space in the <b>terminal</b> <b>field.</b> This takeover of space by the chorda tympani {{is believed to be the}} nerve reverting to its original state before competition and pruning. The chorda tympani, as part of the peripheral nervous system, is not as plastic in early ages. In a study done by Hosley et al. and a study done by Sollars, it has been shown that when the nerve is cut at a young age, the related taste buds are not likely to grow back to full strength. [...] In a bilateral transection of the chorda tympani in mice, the preference for sodium chloride increases compared to before the transection. Also avoidance of higher concentrations of sodium chloride is eliminated. The amiloride-sensitive channels responsible for salt recognition and response is functional in adult rats but not neonatal rats. This explains part of the change in preference of sodium chloride after a chorda tympani transection.The chorda tympani innervates the fungiform papillae on the tongue. According to a study done by Sollars et al. in 2002, when the chorda tympani has been transected early in postnatal development some of the fungiform papillae undergo a structural change to become more “filliform-like”.

40|$|AbstractA {{reduction}} of dopamine release or D 2 receptor blockade in the <b>terminal</b> <b>fields</b> of the mesolimbic system, particularly the amygdala, clearly reduces conditioned fear. Similar D 2 receptor antagonism in the neural substrates {{of fear in}} the midbrain tectum attenuates the processing of unconditioned aversive information. However, {{the implications of the}} interplay between opposing actions of dopamine in the rostral and caudal segments of the dopaminergic system are still unclear. Previous studies from this laboratory have reported the effects of dopaminergic drugs on behavior in rats in the elevated plus maze, auditory-evoked potentials (AEPs) recorded from the midbrain tectum, fear-potentiated startle, and conditioned freezing. These findings led to an interesting framework on the functional roles of dopamine in both anxiety and fear states. Dopamine D 2 receptor inhibition in the <b>terminal</b> <b>fields</b> of the mesolimbic dopamine system generally causes anxiolytic-like effects, whereas the activity of midbrain substrates of unconditioned fear are enhanced by D 2 receptor antagonists, suggesting that D 2 receptor-mediated mechanisms play opposing roles in fear/anxiety processes, depending on the brain region under study. Dopamine appears to mediate conditioned fear by acting at rostral levels of the brain and regulate unconditioned fear at the midbrain level, likely by reducing the sensorimotor gating of aversive events...|$|R

Afferent connections to these rNST-PBN projection neurons were identified by anterograde labeling of the chorda tympani (CT), glossopharyngeal (IX), and lingual (LV) nerves. We used voltage- and current-clamp recordings in brain slices to characterize the expression of both the transient A-type potassium current, IKA and the hyperpolarization-activated inward current, Ih, important determinants of neuronal repetitive discharge characteristics. The majority of rNST-PBN neurons express IKA, and these IKA-expressing neurons predominate in CT and IX terminal fields but were expressed in {{approximately half of the}} neurons in the LV field. rNST-PBN neurons expressing Ih were evenly distributed among CT, IX and LV terminal fields.

Initial learning of the delayed nonmatching-tosample (DNMS) task was impaired in the E animals relative to unoperated control monkeys. On the delay portion of DNMS, the performance of E animals was nearly at control levels at short delays (up to 60 set) but was impaired at 10 min and 40 min retention intervals. On the retest of DNMS, the E animals performed normally at all retention intervals. The E animals were unimpaired on the four other memory tasks. Neuroanatomical studies revealed a significant transverse expansion of the <b>terminal</b> <b>field</b> of the perirhinal cortical projection in the CA 1 region of the hippocampus. Compared to unlesioned, anatomical control monkeys, the transverse length of the perirhinal <b>terminal</b> <b>field</b> in CA 1 increased approximately 70 % in the E monkeys. Although this was a striking morphological alteration, {{it is not known}} whether the sprouting of this projection influenced the behavioral recovery.

As brain mesolimbic dopamine pathways have been proposed {{to be associated with the}} pathophysiology of psychotic disorders, we thought it would be of interest to examine whether these animals present disturbances in the mesolimbic dopamine system. To this end we studied by immunocytochemical, in situ hybridization procedures and receptor autoradiography, several markers of the mesotelencephalic dopamine pathway in heterozygous reeler mice and controls.

The results show that the <b>terminal</b> <b>fields</b> differ in the two layers [...] those in layer 3 are restricted to a line of projection, whereas those in layer 6 are elongated along the dimension orthogonal to a line of projection.

40|$|Vestibular nerve afferents innervating the {{bullfrog}} utriculus {{differ in}} their response dynamics and sensitivity to natural stimulation. They also supply hair cells that differ markedly in hair bundle morphology. To examine the peripheral innervation patterns of individual utricular afferents more closely, afferent fibers were labeled by the extracellular injection of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) into the vestibular nerve after sectioning the vestibular nerve medial to Scarpa's ganglion to allow the degeneration of sympathetic and efferent fibers. The peripheral arborizations of individual afferents were then correlated with the diameters of their parent axons, the regions of the macula they innervate, and the number and type of hair cells they supply. The utriculus is divided by the striola, a narrow zone of distinctive morphology, into media and lateral parts. Utiricular afferents were classified as striolar or extrastriolar according to the epithelial entrance of their parent axons {{and the location of}} their <b>terminal</b> <b>fields.</b> In general, striolar afferents had thicker parent axons, fewer subepithelial bifurcations, larger <b>terminal</b> <b>fields,</b> and more synaptic endings than afferents in extrstriolar regions. Afferents in a juxtastriolar zone, immediately adjacent to the medial striola, had innervation patterns transitional between those in the striola and more peripheral parts of the medial extrastriola. moast afferents innervated only a single macular zone. The <b>terminal</b> <b>fields</b> of striolar afferents, with the notable exception of a few afferents with thin parent axons, were generally confined {{to one side of the}} striola. Hair cells in the bullfrog utriculus have perviously been classified into four types based on hair bundle morphology. Afferents in the extrastriolar and juxtastriolar zones largely or exclusively innervated Type B hair cells, the predominant hair cell type in the utricular macula. Striolar afferents supplied a mixture of four hair cell types, but largely contacted Type B and Type C hair cells, particularly on the outer rows of the medial striola. Afferents supplying more central striolar regions innervated fewer Type B and larger numbers of Type E and Type F hair cells. Striolar afferents with thin parent axons largely supplied Type E hair cells with bulbed kniocilia in the innermost striolar rows...|$|R
