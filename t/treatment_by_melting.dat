40|$|The world {{consumption}} of metals and energy {{has increased in}} last few decades {{and it is still}} increasing. Total volume production results to higher waste production. Raw material basis of majority metals and fossil fuels for energy production is more complex and current waste treatment has long term tendency. Spent power cells of different types have been unneeded and usually they are classified as dangerous waste. This important issue is the main topic of the thesis, in which author describes pyrometallurgical method for storage batteries – power cells and catalysts treatment. During the process there were tested a trial of spent NiMH, Li – ion power cells and spent copper catalysts with metal content <b>treatment</b> <b>by</b> <b>melting</b> and gasification process in plasma arc reactor. The synthetic gas produced from gasification process has been treated by cogenerations micro turbines units for energy recovery. The metal and slag from treatment process are produced into two separately phases and they were analyzing continually...|$|E
40|$|The 6 xxx series alloys {{are well}} known for {{desirable}} combinations of high strength, weldability,corrosion resistance and formability. This paper investigates the influence of chemical composition on the solution heat treatment parameters of rheo-high pressure die cast (R-HPDC) 6 xxx series aluminium alloys. The presence of copper in the 6 xxx series aluminium alloys affects the solution heat <b>treatment</b> <b>by</b> promoting incipient <b>melting.</b> The incidence of incipient melting is investigated for the R-HPDC alloys using Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and optical microscopy. RHPDC is known to produce surface liquid segregation and centre-line liquid segregation when processing the alloys and these areas are the most susceptible to incipient melting. The applicability of single and multiple step solution heat treatments are investigated. The alloys {{used for this study}} include the Cu-free alloy 6082, as well as the Cu-containing alloys 6013 and 6111...|$|R
40|$|International audienceNano-sized {{precipitated silica}} coated calcium {{carbonate}} fillers (PCC-Si) were modified by an alkyl- and a fluoro-alkoxysilane derivative, respectively. PCC-Si surface modification {{was characterized by}} elemental analysis, Fourier transform infrared analysis and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The modification conditions used for surface treatment led to a similar grafting density (around 3. 2 mu mol m(- 2)) for the two alkoxysilane derivatives. A significant decrease of filler hydrophilicity was observed after the alkoxysilane <b>treatment.</b> Nanocomposites prepared <b>by</b> <b>melt</b> mixing the modified fillers (10 wt. %) with polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) depicted no color change, an enhanced filler dispersion state with an homogeneous dispersion of very small filler aggregates (less than 150 nm diameter size), an increase of the thermal stability at high temperature and no change of the PVDF crystalline morphology. The oxygen permeability decrease measured on the nanocomposite prepared from the perfluorooctyltriethoxysilane modified filler was in good agreement with Maxwell law. The permeability increase evidenced for the nanocomposite based on the octyltriethoxysilane modified PCC suggested the formation of weak interfaces in this system...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe paper {{deals with}} the {{influence}} of surface treatment of olive husk flour (OHF) by trimethox-yoctadecylsilane (TMOS) on the morphology and physical properties of bio-composites based on poly(3 -hydroxybutyrate-co- 3 -hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV). Biocomposites based on PHBV/OHF: 80 / 20 (w/w) before and after filler <b>treatment</b> were prepared <b>by</b> <b>melt</b> compounding, while the modification of OHF surface by TMOS was performed by thermo-chemical vapor deposition. Scanning electron microscopic observations showed that modification of OHF by TMOS led to homogeneous and finer dispersion of the filler particles in PHBV matrix, indicating improved compatibility between the two components. Further, TGA data revealed an increase in thermal stability of treated PHBV/OHF biocomposites. An increase in the crystalline index determined by DSC was also observed due to the nucleating effect of OHF in the polymer matrix, however more pronounced for the treated biocomposites. The latter exhibited better tensile properties, as confirmed by DMA results, showing higher reinforcing effect of OHF for the treated biocomposites. This study highlighted significant improvements of the properties of PHBV/OHF biocomposites through silane treatment of OHF. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
