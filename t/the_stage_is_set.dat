5|$|One {{model for}} the {{formation}} of this category of supernova is a close binary star system. The progenitor binary system consists of main sequence stars, with the primary possessing more mass than the secondary. Being greater in mass, the primary is the first of the pair to evolve onto the asymptotic giant branch, where the star's envelope expands considerably. If the two stars share a common envelope then the system can lose significant amounts of mass, reducing the angular momentum, orbital radius and period. After the primary has degenerated into a white dwarf, the secondary star later evolves into a red giant and <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>is</b> <b>set</b> for mass accretion onto the primary. During this final shared-envelope phase, the two stars spiral in closer together as angular momentum is lost. The resulting orbit can have a period as brief as a few hours. If the accretion continues long enough, the white dwarf may eventually approach the Chandrasekhar limit.|$|E

On the square riser, from left to right, sit singers Viji Shankar, Lakshmi Shankar and Kamala Chakravarty, with percussionist Harihar Rao and bansuri player Hariprasad Chaurasia just behind them. Spread out along the crescent-shaped platform (from left to right) are three bowed string players, L. Subramaniam, Satyadev Pawar and Sultan Khan; Anant Lal, on shehnai; then the four drummers, T.V. Gopalkrishnan, Alla Rakha, Rijram Desad and Kamalesh Maitra, the last two partly surrounded by their tarangs (circles) of hand drums. Completing the ring of musicians along this curved riser is sitarist Kartick Kumar; Gopal Krishan, behind a raised vichitra veena; and finally Shivkumar Sharma, behind the large, harpsichord-like santoor. Shankar conducts the orchestra from just in front of the first riser, his back to the audience.|$|E

Confronted with the possibility of being lied to all her life and dooming many sentient species to destruction, or an alternative of believing all she ever loved and trusted has betrayed her – Demosthenes, her father, her friend, her world. Qing-jao instead continues her godspoken rite of woodgrain tracing until her death and is honored by those on Path who still believe in the gods as the last true godspoken. She is elevated to god status after her death. Si Wang-mu sets off with Peter to take control over Starways Congress to stop the Fleet closing in on Lusitania. The new Valentine-persona journeys to find a planet to which the population of Lusitania can evacuate. <b>The</b> <b>stage</b> <b>is</b> <b>set</b> for the final book of the four-part series, Children of the Mind.|$|E

500|$|... "All Souls" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from television critics. Dave Golder from SFX magazine named the episode's Nephilim as among {{of the top}} [...] "10 TV Angels". He applauded the episode's role-switching, allowing Scully to be the believer and Mulder to be the skeptic. John Keegan from Critical Myth awarded the episode an 8 out of 10 and called it [...] "nother gem of the fifth season". He cited that the episode was [...] "the last strong Scully-centric episodes for quite some time" [...] and was a [...] "stunning exploration of her questions of faith." [...] Furthermore he wrote that [...] "a number of important psychological questions are addressed, and <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>is</b> <b>set</b> for her decisions in Fight the Future." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club wrote positively of the episode and awarded it a [...] "B+". Despite calling the entry [...] "an occasionally too-slow episode", VanDerWerff praised Anderson, lauding her performance as [...] "another [...] potential Emmy tape in a season full of them". Furthermore, he enjoyed the juxtaposition of Scully's skepticism and her religious beliefs, noting that the series could have taken the idea {{into the realm of}} irony, but instead played it [...] "with a deathly seriousness" [...] that allowed it to work.|$|E
500|$|In Oedipus Rex, Oedipus is the protagonist. Oedipus' {{infanticide}} {{is planned}} by his parents, Laius and Jocasta, to avert him from fulfilling a prophecy; in truth, the servant entrusted with the infanticide passes the infant on {{through a series}} of intermediaries to a childless couple, who adopt him not knowing his history. Oedipus eventually learns of the Delphic Oracle's prophecy of him, that he would kill his father and marry his mother; Oedipus attempts to flee his fate without harming those he knows as his parents (at this point, he does not know that he is adopted). Oedipus meets a man at a crossroads accompanied by servants; Oedipus and the man fight, and Oedipus kills the man (who was his father, Laius, although neither knew at the time). He becomes the ruler of Thebes after solving the riddle of the sphinx and in the process, [...] marries the widowed queen, his mother Jocasta. [...] Thus <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>is</b> <b>set</b> for horror. When the truth comes out, following from another true but confusing prophecy from Delphi, Jocasta commits suicide, Oedipus blinds himself and leaves Thebes. At the end of the play, order is restored. This restoration is seen when Creon, brother of Jocasta, becomes king, and also when Oedipus, before going off to exile, asks Creon {{to take care of his}} children. [...] Oedipus's children will always bear the weight of shame and humiliation because of their father's actions.|$|E

2500|$|Wesley {{undergoes}} {{yet another}} drastic personality change in Angels fifth season {{following the death}} of his love, Fred. Denisof believes that the loss of Fred caused Wesley to become understandably [...] "unbalanced". [...] "By the time we get to the last few episodes, he's got a handle on the grief and is functioning in a more level-headed way," [...] says Denisof. [...] "But underlying it is a huge hole in his heart and it makes it possible for the decision that they make in the final episode. For him emotionally, <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>is</b> <b>set</b> for a life or death battle, possibly for the last time, because at this point, there's nothing more for him to lose." [...] Denisof talked with Whedon about what storylines would have been in place had the television series received another season; Wesley would not have died, and he and Illyria would have featured in an arc in which the transformation of Illyria to Fred would have been extended over many episodes and taken to a [...] "much deeper, darker place" [...] than it briefly was in the late fifth-season episode, [...] "The Girl in Question". Denisof continues, They would have progressed the relationship between Wesley and Illyria in such a way it would conflict with his own feelings for Fred, in a much more profound way. And then we would have gone into the switching of Fred and Illyria and having these two people that he was having these strong feelings about. That {{was going to be a}} fairly long journey in the following season, all of which got abbreviated tremendously when [...] decided to cancel the show. The cancellation of the show was the inspiration for Wesley's death; Whedon gave Denisof the option of keeping the character alive, but Denisof believed killing the character was right for the story, [...] "It was very upsetting to read. It's too good a story because it hurts." ...|$|E
