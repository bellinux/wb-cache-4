5|$|Adams' 1996 sequel, Tales from Watership Down {{includes}} stories {{where the}} female rabbits {{play a more}} prominent role in the Watership Down warren. It has been suggested <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>might</b> have been an attempt to modernise the story, {{to make it more}} in tune with the political sensibilities of the 1990s, when it was published.|$|E
5|$|An {{examination}} of the blood stains found inside 46Lower Belgrave Street demonstrated that Rivett had been attacked in the basement kitchen, while Lady Lucan had been attacked {{at the top of}} the basement stairs. The blood stains found inside the Ford Corsair were of the AB blood group; the report concluded <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>might</b> have been a mixture of blood from both women. Hair similar to Lady Lucan's was also found inside the car.|$|E
5|$|At about noon, {{several hundred}} special constables were led onto the field. They formed two {{lines in the}} crowd a few yards apart, {{in an attempt to}} form a {{corridor}} through the crowd between the house where the magistrates were watching and the hustings, two waggons lashed together. Believing <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>might</b> be intended as the route by which the magistrates would later send their representatives to arrest the speakers, some members of the crowd pushed the waggons away from the constables, and pressed around the hustings to form a human barrier.|$|E

5|$|Bigfin reef squids exhibit strong {{positive}} phototactic behaviour (attraction to light) {{and will}} move readily {{within a certain}} distance of a light source. Studies have proposed <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>might</b> be an involuntary stimulus behaviour, as the squids immediately stop all other movements once a light source is switched on. The colour of the light does not matter, {{but it has been}} shown that they react more strongly to underwater lights between the intensities of 1.5 to 2.5lx, with peak ranges of 2.5 to 10.0lx.|$|E
5|$|His biographer, Brian Little, {{suggests}} <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>might</b> {{have been}} {{a way for the}} newcomers to become part of Bristol maritime society, as well as making it possible for Woodes Rogers to become a freeman, or voting citizen, of the city. Little also suggests that it is likely that Rogers gained his maritime experience with Yeamans' ship on the Newfoundland fleet. Rogers completed his apprenticeship in November 1704.|$|E
5|$|Matilda {{returned}} to Normandy in 1125 and spent {{about a year}} at the royal court, where her father Henry was still hoping that his second marriage would generate a male heir. In the event <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>might</b> fail to happen, Matilda was now Henry's preferred choice, and he declared that she was to be his rightful successor if he should die without a male heir. The Anglo-Norman barons were gathered together at Westminster on Christmas 1126, where they swore in January to recognise Matilda and any future legitimate heir she might have.|$|E

5|$|Another {{unidentified}} parrot specimen, {{this one}} brown and housed in Cabinet du Roi, {{was described by}} the French naturalist Comte de Buffon in 1779 under his entry for the Mascarene parrot, in which he pointed out {{similarities and differences between}} the two. The English palaeontologist Julian Hume has suggested the possibility <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>might</b> have been a lesser vasa parrot, if not a discoloured old Mascarene grey parakeet (Psittacula bensoni). The specimen is now lost. English zoologist and author George Robert Gray assigned some eclectus parrot (Eclectus roratus) subspecies from the Moluccas to Mascarinus in his book A List of the Genera of Birds from the 1840s, but this idea was soon dismissed by other writers.|$|E
5|$|Dissection {{occurs when}} blood accumulates {{in the wall}} of the blood vessel. This is most likely due to a tear in the tunica intima (the inner layer), {{allowing}} blood to enter the tunica media, although other lines of evidence have suggested that the blood may instead arise from the vasa vasorum, the small blood vessels that supply the outer layer of larger blood vessels. Various theories exist as to whether people who sustain carotid and vertebral artery dissection, even if not suffering from a connective tissue disorder, have an underlying vulnerability. Biopsy samples of skin and other arteries has indicated <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>might</b> be a possibility, but no genetic defect in collagen or elastin genes has been convincingly proven. Other studies have indicated inflammation of the blood vessels, as measured by highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP, a marker of inflammation) in the blood.|$|E
5|$|Fox {{had raised}} $1.7 {{million by the}} time he was forced to abandon the Marathon. He {{realized}} that the nation was about to see the consequences of the disease, and hoped <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>might</b> lead to greater generosity. A week after his run ended, the CTV Television Network organized a nationwide telethon in support of Fox and the Canadian Cancer Society. Supported by Canadian and international celebrities, the five-hour event raised $10.5 million. Among the donations were $1 million each by the governments of British Columbia and Ontario, the former to create a new research institute to be founded in Fox's name, and the latter an endowment given to the Ontario Cancer Treatment and Research Foundation. Donations continued throughout the winter, and by the following April, over $23 million had been raised.|$|E

5|$|In the {{afternoon}} of 7 April, Trifunović again pressed Petrović to order a withdrawal from the border. Petrović accepted <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>might</b> become necessary if {{the situation on the}} immediate right flank of the 7th Army deteriorated further, but the idea was opposed by the Slovene {{chief of staff of the}} headquarters of the 1st Army Group, Armijski đeneral Leon Rupnik, who suggested that Trifunović, a Serb, should personally lead night attacks to push the Germans back. At 19:30, the Yugoslav Supreme Command advised Petrović that he had approval to withdraw endangered units on the right wing of the 7th Army. Morale in the 7th Army had started to decline due to fifth column elements encouraging soldiers to stop resisting the enemy.|$|E
5|$|Kant {{believed}} that the Categorical Imperative provides us with the maxim that {{we ought not to}} lie in any circumstances, even if we are trying to bring about good consequences, such as lying to a murderer to prevent them from finding their intended victim. Kant argued that, because we cannot fully know what the consequences of any action will be, the result might be unexpectedly harmful. Therefore, we ought to act to avoid the known wrong—lying—rather than to avoid a potential wrong. If there are harmful consequences, we are blameless because we acted according to our duty. Driver argues <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>might</b> not be a problem if we choose to formulate our maxims differently: the maxim 'I will lie to save an innocent life' can be universalized. However, this new maxim may still treat the murderer as a means to an end, which we have a duty to avoid doing. Thus we may still be required to tell the truth to the murderer in Kant's example.|$|E
5|$|Little archaeological {{evidence}} {{relates to the}} period immediately after the dissolution, or to the Tudor house built on part of the site. A sawpit {{was found in the}} outer courtyard. It is considered <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>might</b> date from the early period of the Brookes' house, or it may have been constructed during the later years of the abbey. The kitchens to the south of the Tudor house and their drainage systems appear to have been used by the Brookes, and according to Brown and Howard-Davis, were possibly rebuilt by the family. The areas previously occupied by the cloisters and the guest quarters were probably used as middens. Few archaeological findings remain from the Georgian house, apart from a fragment of a wall from the south front, and the foundations of the north wing. The much-altered medieval undercroft still stands, with its Norman doorway and Victorian replica, barrel vaulting, wine bins, and blind arcading in the former outer parlour.|$|E

5|$|The Yugoslav Supreme Command ordered Petrović to use Mountain Detachment Rišnajaski {{to capture}} Fiume, across the Rječina river from Sušak, but {{the order was}} soon {{rescinded}} due to the deteriorating situation in the flanking 4th Army. In the afternoon of 7 April, Trifunović again pressed Petrović to order a withdrawal from the border. Petrović accepted <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>might</b> become necessary if {{the situation on the}} immediate right flank of the 7th Army deteriorated further, but the idea was opposed by the {{chief of staff of the}} headquarters of the 1st Army Group, Armijski đeneral Leon Rupnik, who suggested that Trifunović should personally lead night attacks to push the Germans back.

5|$|Throughout {{his career}} as a {{professional}} footballer and for years afterwards, Ramsey claimed to be two years younger than he really was — including in his ghosted autobiography, Talking Football, published in 1952. This began when Ramsey first turned professional with Southampton during the Second World War. He told Southampton he was born in 1922 rather than 1920, reasoning <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>might</b> improve his career prospects and compensate for the years he had lost to the hostilities. He propagated this false age for over two decades, in press articles, his autobiography and Who's Who — but not on official documents such as his marriage papers, in which he listed his true date of birth. Only after his knighthood in 1967 did Ramsey reveal his true age, deciding that he could not lie to Debrett's, publisher of Debrett's Peerage & Baronetage.|$|E
5|$|With the Bábí {{community}} now irrevocably divided, {{the followers}} of Mirza Yahya tried to discredit Bahá'u'lláh to the Ottoman authorities, accusing him of causing agitation against the government. While an investigation cleared Bahá'u'lláh, it did bring {{to the attention of}} the government that Bahá'u'lláh and Mirza Yahya were propagating religious claims, and, fearing <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>might</b> cause future disorder, they decided to again exile the 'Bábí' leaders. A royal command was issued in July 1868 condemning the Bábís to perpetual imprisonment and isolation in far-flung outposts of the Ottoman Empire— Famagusta, Cyprus for Mirza Yahya and his followers, and Acre, in Ottoman Palestine, for Bahá'u'lláh and his followers.|$|E

5|$|Stansfield {{had long}} felt {{uncomfortable with the}} idea of medical {{officers}} marrying. Louise Hind, in Gender and Class in English Asylums, 1890–1914, hints <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>might</b> have been the result of misogynist tendencies, although Hubert Bond, his obituary-writer and former colleague, preemptively defended him against these claims. Stansfield nevertheless married twice; firstly, in 1908 to Mary Caroline (died 1926), a daughter of the Hon. James Dever, a Canadian senator from St John's, Newfoundland. After her death, he married (in 1929) Marie, second daughter of Alexander Effremoff, of Moscow; he had met her in Paris, where she had been living in exile after the Russian Revolution. There were no children from either marriage, but he worked with the scouting movement, and served as President of the North Central Kent Boys' Scouts Association. He was a fond rose-grower and it was the gardens at Southmead in Wimbledon which attracted him and his first wife to the house; they lived there for many years. He retired to Castello Devachan in Sanremo, Italy, with his second wife, before going to Paris to seek treatment for an illness; he died there on 19 February 1939. His widow remained at the Castello in Sanremo until her death in 1973, spending her last 21 years as starosta of the Russian Orthodox parish community there.|$|E
