5|$|As I {{made clear}} in my {{telegram}} to the FIDE delegates, the match conditions I proposed were non-negotiable. Mr. Cramer informs me <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> of the winner {{being the first}} player to win ten games, draws not counting, unlimited number of games and if nine wins to nine match is drawn with champion regaining title and prize fund split equally were rejected by the FIDE delegates. By so doing FIDE has decided against my participation in the 1975 World Chess Championship. Therefore, I resign my FIDE World Chess Championship title. Sincerely, Bobby Fischer.|$|E
5|$|The ICJ's {{decision}} is final and {{not subject to}} appeal. Nevertheless, in June 2008 Rais Yatim stated that Malaysia had renewed its search for the letter written by Governor Butterworth to the Sultan and Temenggung of Johor seeking permission to build Horsburgh Lighthouse on Pedra Branca. He noted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> of the ICJ allowed a case to be reviewed within ten years if new evidence was adduced. In response, Singapore's Law Minister K. Shanmugam said that the city-state would {{wait to see what}} new evidence the Malaysian government could come up with.|$|E
5|$|Cameron and Comfort {{participated in}} a {{televised}} debate with atheists Brian Sapient and Kelly O'Conner of the Rational Response Squad, at Calvary Baptist Church, in Manhattan, on May 5, 2007. It was moderated by ABC's Martin Bashir and parts of it were aired on Nightline. At issue was the existence of God, which Comfort stated he could prove scientifically, without relying on faith or the Bible. The audience was composed of both theists and atheists. Points of discussion included atheism and evolution. While Sapient contended during his arguments that Comfort violated the rules by talking about the Ten Commandments, Cameron later stated on The Way of the Master radio show <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> of the debate {{did not say that}} the Bible could never be referenced, but rather that Comfort simply {{had to come up with}} one argument that did not reference the Bible or faith.|$|E
50|$|The {{respondents}} defended {{their actions}} by arguing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> was {{a bona fide}} occupational requirement (BFOR). Namely, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> was required to maintain an acceptable standard for firefighting.|$|R

25|$|However, {{there are}} {{limitations}} to <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> of necessity. One suggested limitation is <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> is inapplicable if the disqualification {{of a member}} will still leave a quorum of an administrative agency capable of acting. Another is <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> of necessity will not justify an adjudicator sitting where actual bias can be shown.|$|R
5|$|In China, {{silk-worm}} farming {{was originally}} restricted to women, and many women {{were employed in}} the silk-making industry. Even though some saw {{the development of a}} luxury product as useless, silk provoked such a craze among high society <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> in the Li Ji were used to limit its use {{to the members of the}} imperial family. For approximately a millennium, the right to wear silk was reserved for the emperor and the highest dignitaries. Silk was, at the time, a sign of great wealth, because of its shimmering appearance. This appearance was due to silk's prism-like shape/structure, which refracted light from every angle. After some time, silk gradually extended to other classes of Chinese society. Silk began to be used for decorative means and also in less luxurious ways: musical instruments, fishing, and bow making. Peasants did not have the right to wear silk until the Qing dynasty (1644–1911).|$|E
5|$|Prior to the Tourist Trophy the Isle of Man had {{hosted the}} English trials for the Gordon Bennett Cup as the English {{government}} had banned motor racing on its roads. The Automobile Club {{wanted to run}} an event to help develop fuel efficiency in motor cars and opted {{to use the same}} route as had been used for the trials. In order to make the event relevant to those cars on general sale they imposed rules to prevent specialist race cars from entering, though there were complaints <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> were too restrictive and detracted from the spectacle.|$|E
5|$|The {{preliminary}} hearing began on March 13, 1951, and lasted three days, {{during which the}} Crown called 20witnesses. Diefenbaker alleged <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> of the CNR did not require that the telegraph operator listen to the repeat of his message, but merely recommended that he should. Nevertheless, Diefenbaker's motion to dismiss was unsuccessful and Atherton was committed for trial before the Supreme Court of British Columbia (a trial-level court). Manslaughter was a charge for which the accused {{did not have the}} option of a speedy trial before a county court judge, and Atherton's case was set for the Spring Assizes in Prince George.|$|E
50|$|In the U.S., {{interested}} parties can sue {{to have a}} judge review the rulemaking process once <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> is finalized. Interested parties frequently sue the rulemaking agency, asking the court to order the agency to reconsider. For example, environmental groups may sue, claiming <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> is too lax on industry; or industry groups may sue, claiming <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> is too onerous.|$|R
50|$|According to some commentators, <b>the</b> {{common law}} <b>rule</b> dates to <b>the</b> twelfth century and took its modern {{form in the}} eighteenth century. Critics of <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> argue <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> is unjust because it {{requires}} no intent to kill. In favor of <b>the</b> <b>rule,</b> {{it can be argued}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> affirms <b>the</b> principle of the sanctity of human life by imposing harsher penalties for crimes that destroy human life.|$|R
5000|$|Ty Grigg {{suggests}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> has {{not been}} [...] "effective at curbing infidelity". He argues <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> [...] "has framed relating with the opposite sex with fear", and that {{this leads to a}} diminished mutual respect, which in turn creates [...] "the kind of environment where inappropriate relating is more likely to occur." [...] Others, however, suggest that unfaithful pastors must have failed to implement <b>the</b> <b>rule.</b>|$|R
5|$|There is circumstantial {{evidence}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> also influenced Australian rules football conceived {{a couple of}} years later. The two codes shared the unique feature of lacking the offside rule. There are also similarities in the laws for kicking off, kick outs, throw-ins and the fair catch. Henry Creswick (possibly a relative of Nathaniel Creswick) was born in Sheffield but emigrated to Australia with his brother in 1840 (the town of Creswick is named after them). He moved to Melbourne in 1854 and became involved in the local cricket scene. He played first class cricket for Victoria during the 57–58 season alongside three of the founders of Melbourne Football Club including Tom Wills, the man credited with creating the original rules.|$|E
5|$|When he was fifteen, Vainio {{felt sure}} he would become a writer. As a young man he read a book about poetics, and later said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> were easy to break once he had learned them. It became {{apparent}} in essays written whilst at the gymnasium that Juha had talent as a writer. However, teachers sometimes had mixed feelings about his writing; at one time he received no grade for a lighthearted column-like text he had written, because the teacher felt {{that it could not}} be graded as an essay. Although essays were his strong point, school was uninteresting for Juha. He considered quitting school, but the principal persuaded him to change his mind. He was transferred to another school and was later joined there by his friend Risto Warjus. In the end, the only school subjects in which Vainio excelled were singing and sports.|$|E
5|$|Dunderdale {{announced}} her candidacy for the PC Party leadership on December 30, 2010, and {{was endorsed by}} her entire caucus. While she originally stated she would step down as premier if she {{decided to run for}} the leadership after announcing her candidacy Dunderdale said she will only step down if someone challenges her for the leadership. On January 10, 2011, an hour before nominations were set to close in the leadership election Brad Cabana, a blogger and a former mayor in Saskatchewan, filed his nomination papers becoming Dunderdale's only challenger. The next day however the PC Party's credentials committee announced that Cabana was ineligible to enter the race because he was unable to collect the 50 signatures needed by PC party members to be nominated. Cabana appealed the party's decision but it was announced on January 27, 2011, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> committee upheld the previous ruling by the credentials committee. With Cabana being ineligible to run Dunderdale was officially named the leader-designate, she was sworn in as leader at the party's convention on April 2, 2011.|$|E

50|$|The Court also {{suggested}} obiter dictum <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> {{ought not to}} apply in cases where its application would produce manifest inconvenience and absurdity. More broadly, <b>the</b> Court states <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> does not apply if when {{looking at all the}} circumstances, it is apparent <b>that</b> <b>the</b> parties could not have intended a binding agreement until notice of acceptance was communicated to the offeror.|$|R

5|$|Linguistic {{study of}} the Khmer {{language}} divides its history into four periods one of which, the Old Khmer period, is subdivided into pre-Angkorian and Angkorian. Pre-Angkorian Khmer, the Old Khmer language from 600 CE through 800, is only known from words and phrases in Sanskrit texts of the era. Old Khmer (or Angkorian Khmer) is the language as it was spoken in the Khmer Empire from the 9th century until the weakening of the empire sometime in the 13th century. Old Khmer is attested by many primary sources and has been studied in depth by a few scholars, most notably Saveros Pou, Phillip Jenner and Heinz-Jürgen Pinnow. Following {{the end of the}} Khmer Empire the language lost the standardizing influence of being the language of government and accordingly underwent a turbulent period of change in morphology, phonology and lexicon. The language of this transition period, from about the 14th to 18th centuries, is referred to as Middle Khmer and saw borrowing from Thai, Lao and, to a lesser extent, Vietnamese. The changes during this period are so profound <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> of Modern Khmer can not be applied to correctly understand Old Khmer. The language became recognizable as Modern Khmer, spoken from the 19th century till today.|$|E
5|$|The first {{recorded}} baseball event in Australia {{took place in}} Melbourne, Victoria in 1857, between teams from Collingwood and Richmond. Accounts vary as to the details, including {{whether it was a}} single game or a series of threegames, though details in common include a score of 350–230 in favour of Collingwood, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> used were some form of hybrid between cricket and baseball, with teams batting until all players were out, and runs being scored for every base crossed, rather than just for reaching home plate. Though there are no records to confirm it, the commonly held belief is that baseball in Australia originated on the Ballarat gold-fields among American miners. The Claxton Shield, the first annually recurring national tournament, commenced in 1934. Though the tournament itself has been supplanted at various points in its history, the physical Shield is still awarded to the national champions in the Australian Baseball League. From 2011, the national champions will meet other champions from Japan, South Korea and Chinese Taipei in the Asia Series.|$|E

50|$|The {{proposed}} changes were generally opposed by patent agents and attorneys, manufacturing companies, biotechnology companies, and independent inventors. There was concern <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> changes failed {{to consider the}} difficulties commonly encountered in getting a patent, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> changes would result in inventors failing {{to get the full}} range of patent protection to which they are entitled. The groups also maintained <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> changes were not consistent with the current regulations on continuations.|$|R

25|$|The crucial {{properties}} of {{this set of}} rules are that they are sound and complete. Informally this means <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> are correct and that no other rules are required. These claims can be made more formal as follows.|$|E
