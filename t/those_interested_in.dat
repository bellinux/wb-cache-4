5|$|Code: Veronicas story, setting, {{and artistic}} design strayed {{away from the}} series standard. While {{previous}} games are set in the United States and have a corresponding American feel to them, Code: Veronica {{is set in the}} Southern Ocean and Antarctica and carries a European gothic horror inspired design. This is made clear in the environments which features gothic architecture and art in addition to central European carvings and German-style weaponry. In addition, the gothic feel is emphasized through the story. The horror in Code: Veronica is driven by this story which follows a crazed man and the fate of his noble bloodline. The story is told partly through a lullaby, and this method of story telling is intended to bring out European operatic undertones. This contrasts to previous games in the series which were driven by the panic elements from American horror films, such as monsters and zombies. With regards to managing the art staff, Mikami split them up depending on their interests. <b>Those</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> guns worked solely on gun designs while <b>those</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> environments were sent to photograph houses and castles for research.|$|E

5|$|Milburn {{felt that}} the opening {{chapters}} (and introduction) did well to establish the volume, and was happy with {{the inclusion of the}} more empirical contributions, given their potential theoretical significance. He picked out the chapters by Driessen, Boyer and Wissenburg respectively as highlights, suggesting that the contributions of Driessen and Boyer seemed to challenge the volume's second stated goal, and noting that, though it was strong, he disagreed with the claims of Wissenburg's chapter. Garner highlighted the contributions of Flanders and Driessen, and commended the editors for putting together the book. Hooley concluded his review by claiming that the book offered something to <b>those</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> the place of animals in politics, but that much of its contents would be of more interest for those looking to read about environmental political theory.|$|E
5|$|Sawtooth National Forest {{balances}} {{interests of}} different groups, such as <b>those</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> recreation, preservation, or resource extraction. The forest practices conservation of resources, {{in some areas}} allowing for production of raw materials, such as lumber for construction purposes and wood pulp for paper products, alongside recreational uses, while in other areas only recreation is permitted. Additionally, mineral extraction through mining and {{oil and natural gas}} exploration and recovery are also conducted, though in Sawtooth National Forest this has become less common due to a consensus to protect the natural surroundings. Leases offered to ranchers to allow them to graze cattle and sheep on the forest are common. The forest provides guidelines and enforces environmental regulations to ensure that resources are not overexploited and that necessary commodities are available for future generations.|$|E

The club remained at its original location until it was raided by Prohibition agents in 1931. After the raid, it moved to East 51st Street. From 1934 until its closure in 1965, it was located at 3 East 53rd Street, just east of Fifth Avenue, when it became world-renowned with its celebrity clientele and luxury.

5|$|In the 1970s French sociologists, {{particularly}} <b>those</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> critical theory, re-examined {{this historical}} legacy. The Annales School conducted extensive research into how order was maintained in pre-revolutionary France, {{focusing on the}} operation of the police, concepts of deviancy and religion. Histories of the Bastille since then have focused on the prison's role in policing, censorship and popular culture, in particular how these impacted on the working classes. Research in West Germany during the 1980s examined the cultural interpretation of the Bastille against the wider context of the French Revolution; Hanse Lüsebrink and Rolf Reichardt's work, explaining how the Bastille came to be regarded as a symbol of despotism, was among the most prominent. This body of work influenced historian Simon Schama's 1989 book on the Revolution, which incorporated cultural interpretation of the Bastille with a controversial critique of the violence surrounding the storming of the Bastille. The Bibliothèque nationale de France held a major exhibition on the legacy of the Bastille between 2010 and 2011, resulting in a substantial edited volume summarising the current academic perspectives on the fortress.|$|E
5|$|The game's use of The Simpsons-style humor {{received}} a mixed reception. Both GameSpot and GameTrailers {{said that the}} game delivered more than enough laughs to make it worth playing through at least once. It was considered enjoyable for both hardcore and casual The Simpsons fans by IGN and GameDaily, who also called it a particularly appealing game for diehard fans. Despite the few problems that the game had, GameSpy {{said that it was}} worth it to see the humorous parodies. Eurogamer's Tom Bramwell, however, believed that the game's humor could only carry it so far, and suggested that <b>those</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> The Simpsons humor should purchase a box set of one of the television series' seasons instead. Joe Juba of Game Informer called the game an average experience. He elaborated that the game would appeal primarily to fans of the television series, but would not be worth playing for people unfamiliar with it.|$|E
