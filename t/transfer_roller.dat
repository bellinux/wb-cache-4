50|$|The ink {{fountain}} stores {{a quantity of}} ink in a reservoir and feeds small quantities of ink to the distribution rollers from the {{ink fountain}} roller and the ink ductor roller. The ink ductor roller is a movable roller that moves {{back and forth between}} the ink fountain roller and an ink distribution roller. As the ductor contacts the ink fountain roller, both turn and the ductor is inked. The ductor then swings forward to contact an ink distribution <b>roller</b> and <b>transfers</b> ink to it. There are generally two types of ink distribution rollers: the ink rotating <b>rollers</b> (or ink <b>transfer</b> <b>rollers),</b> which rotate in one direction, and the ink oscillating rollers (or ink vibrating rollers), which rotate and move from side to side. The ink distribution rollers receive ink and work it into a semiliquid state that is uniformly delivered to the ink form rollers. A thin layer of ink is then transferred to the image portions of the lithographic plate by the ink form rollers.|$|R

The screens consist of gray scales from 0 to 100 % of dot {{coverage}}, and the solid blocks also have coverage scales from 0 to 100 %. Printing experiment was performed, and densities and dot coverage of specific places were measured and recorded. Based on the testing data, density or dot coverage undulation with printing impressions was indicated by curves. Furthermore analysis was taken. Dot gains in the same prints are not constant, which cause that saddle shape in prints. Some reasons from construction of press such as the gap of cylinder, swing of <b>transferring</b> <b>roller</b> and oscillation of oscillating rollers were brought out. Same values of ink presetting can not get the same printing quality in the ink zones which have the same graphic coverage. The traditional press has a long make-ready time in printing running, which can reduce the efficiency of press.

40|$|In {{roll-based}} printing systems, {{controlled release}} of liquid ink to the substrate surface is achieved through {{the transport of}} the liquid ink {{through a series of}} ink <b>transfer</b> <b>rollers</b> in the form of splitting liquid bridges. An in-depth understanding of the liquid transport process through the ink <b>transfer</b> <b>rollers</b> is essential for advancing the roll-based printing technology and achieving the highest quality printing. In this study, the phase-field method is investigated to characterize the liquid bridges in roll-based printing systems. Phase-field models of two-phase flow systems are being used increasingly often in a variety of applications ranging from microfluidics to turbulent flows. However, there are limited implementations of the phase-field method to simulate the liquid ink transport in roll-based printing systems. There are advantages of the phase-field method over other methods that are generally used for simulating the liquid transport in roll-based printing systems such as the volume of fluid method and the moving mesh methods. This study demonstrates that the phase-field method is an effective tool to simulate the liquid ink transport in roll-based printing systems that facilitates the treatment of certain characteristics of the ink flows such as moving and deforming interfaces, topology changes, and slipping contact lines. In the phase-field simulations described in this study, the liquid ink transport between the rollers is approximated as the stretching and splitting of liquid bridges with pinned or moving contact lines between vertically separating surfaces. The interface separating the liquid and the surrounding air is represented as a diffuse interface with finite thickness across which the two phases mix. First, the simulation conditions that yield accurate results are determined by examining the effect of the phase-field parameters and the mesh characteristics on the simulation results. The simulation results show that a sharp interface limit is approached when the capillary width is decreased keeping the mobility proportional to the capillary width squared. This limit best represents real interfaces having molecular thickness in the micron-scale flows investigated. Close to the sharp interface limit, the mobility changes over a specified range are observed to have no significant influence on the simulation results. The computational mesh is segmented into regions of varying mesh fineness or adaptive mesh refinement is implemented to reduce the computational cost of resolving thin interfaces in the simulations. The simulation results are validated against data reported in existing studies of liquid ink transport in roll-based printing systems for selected capillary width and mobility values. Next, the liquid ink transport from the axisymmetric cells on the surface an ink-metering roller to the surface of stamp features is simulated. The function of the cells on an ink-metering roller is to control the amount of liquid ink delivered to the stamp surface. The resolution of printing is limited by the width of the cell openings, since uniform inking of the stamp requires the width of the cell openings to be smaller than the size of the stamp features. The cell geometries explored in the simulations are selected to enable printing with higher resolution than the current industry standards. Increasing the resolution of printing would improve the performance of printed products and expand their range of functionality. The results of the simulations indicate that under negligible inertial effects {{and in the absence of}} gravity, the amount of liquid ink transferred from a cell with low surface wettability to a stamp with high surface wettability increases as the cell sidewall steepness and the cell surface wettability decrease, and the stamp surface wettability and the capillary number increase. The amount of liquid ink removed from the cell does not change significantly as the cell depth increases above a certain value. High-resolution printing strategies, which indicate how the printing parameters should be manipulated to more precisely control the printed layer thickness, to eliminate printing defects, and to minimize cell clogging, are derived by analyzing the simulation results. The cells with different sidewall inclination angles are used to represent the cells with irregular surface topography on novel materials and novel roller designs that could be used for stamp inking during high-resolution roll-based printing, such as the pores on porous materials and the cells fabricated with poor control over cell geometry due to manufacturing difficulties at small length scales. The variations in the printed layer thickness with the cell sidewall inclination angle is found to be significant (~ 10 - 100 nm for cells with 2 -[mu]m opening width) indicating that the variations in cell geometry should be minimized when designing advanced rollers for use in high-resolution roll-based printing. by Fahri Erinc Hizir.

The two-piece bolt mechanism consists of a bolt head that contains two cylindrical rollers and a wedge-shaped locking piece, attached to a heavy bolt carrier. When fired, the build-up of gas pressure generated by the ignited powder charge exerts rearward pressure on the bolt, which is then <b>transferred</b> onto the <b>rollers.</b> The rollers are cammed inward against appropriately shaped walls in the barrel extension, displacing the locking piece. The geometry of the camming ramps on the wedge-like locking piece ensure a rearward velocity that is {{greater than that of}} the bolt. This ensures that the bullet has left the barrel, allowing bore pressures to drop to a safe level before the rollers are fully retracted, clearing the barrel extension notches and releasing the bolt, which is then engaged by the bolt carrier and withdraws together with the entire moving assembly.|$|R
40|$|Pumping {{suspensions}} and pastes {{has always}} been a significant technological challenge in a number of industrial applications ranging from food processing to mining. Peristaltic pumps have become popular to pump and/or dose complex fluids, due to their robustness. During the transport of suspensions with peristaltic pumps, clogging issues may arise, particularly during transient operations. That is a matter of particular concern whenever the pumping device is used intermittently to generate flow only on demand. Further understanding of the transient dynamics of such systems and of the conditions that can lead to jamming would result in more robust peristaltic pump design. To achieve these goals, an experimental setup that simplifies the statorrotor assembly of a peristaltic hose pump was used. In this setup, a <b>roller</b> <b>transfers</b> momentum to a liquid suspension, upon application of a constant load. The evolution of the velocity of the roller was recorded for different concentrations of mono-dispersed spheres of different diameters. The flow is found not to be strongly dependent on the dispersed particle volume fraction, if the size of the suspended phase is comparable with the hose diameter. Conversely, the flow is strongly slowed down when their size is small and the particle concentration is increased. These findings could help improving the design of peristaltic pumps by a more appropriate sizing, given the diameter of the hose and that of the particles to be transported...|$|R

One of the drawbacks of the original Il-62 design was the lack of a cargo bay <b>roller</b> <b>transfer</b> system, which necessitated manual loading of pre-packaged baggage and cargo thus making preparation of the aircraft rather slow (a cargo/baggage conveyance system is standard on the Il-62M). Conversely, there is relatively easy access to all serviceable mechanical components including the engines [...] whilst the plane's thrust reversal capabilities allows reverse taxiing without the need for tow-vehicles. Powerplant overhaul intervals varied between specifications and maintenance procedures and between the thrust reverse-capable outer engines and the inner ones. Czech Airlines operated an early Il-62 on a proving basis up to 3000 hrs between overhauls, which was well beyond the recommended (and their usual) intervals which were nearer 2000 hrs [...] although Interflug were able to designate up to 5000 hrs with their service facilities.

A maximum cell yield of 1. 2 x 10 (6) cells/mL was obtained in stirred-tank microcarrier batch culture while cell numbers in the Wave Bioreactor could not be determined accurately due to the fast sedimentation of microcarriers under non-rocking conditions required for sampling. Detailed off-line analysis was carried out to understand the behaviour of the virus-host cell system in both cultivation systems. Metabolic profiles for glucose, lactate, glutamine, and ammonium showed slight differences for both systems. E-FL cell growth was on the same level in stirred-tank and Wave Bioreactor with a higher volumetric cell yield compared to roller bottles. Propagation of MEV, which can only replicate efficiently in mitotic cells, was characterized in the Wave Bioreactor using a multiple harvest strategy. Maximum virus titres of 10 (6. 6) to 10 (6. 8) TCID(50) /mL were obtained, which corresponds to an increase in virus yield by a factor of about 10 compared to cultivations in roller bottles. As a consequence, a single Wave Bioreactor cultivation of appropriate scale can replace hundreds of roller bottles.

5000|$|During {{the years}} that Frigidaire was owned by General Motors, it was very {{competitive}} in the automatic clothes-washing-machine business. Frigidaire engineer Kenneth Sisson, also credited with {{the design of the}} incrementing timer used on clothes washers and dishwashers for years to come, designed the Frigidaire automatic washer with the Unimatic mechanism in the late 1930s. Production of the first Frigidaire automatic clothes washers was halted due to World War II and therefore the machine was not formally introduced until 1947. The washing action of a Frigidaire automatic was unique in that the agitator pulsated up and down, a unique departure from the traditional oscillating type. The Frigidaire washers were commonly named for their mechanisms, which, in true General Motors fashion, underwent frequent changes over the years. The Unimatic was in production the longest, for any single Frigidaire mechanism, from 1947 to 1958. The Pulsamatic mechanism, unique in that it pulsated 630 times per minute, was introduced in 1955 for the lower-end models. This became the foundation for the Multimatic, introduced for the 1959 model year. The Multimatic lasted through 1964, as the Rollermatic was brought out for the 1965 lineup. The Rollermatic was unique in that instead of using an oil-filled gearcase, metal and urethane <b>rollers</b> <b>transferred</b> the power within the mechanism. This underwent a slight revision in 1970 for the new eighteen-pound capacity 1-18, which kept the same basic mechanism but differed in that it was belt-driven off of the motor and added a recirculating pump. Besides the unique action, another notable feature of these older washers was the final, high-speed spin cycle (nicknamed [...] "Rapidry"), 1140 revolutions per minute in the Unimatic, 850 in the Multimatic, and 1010 in the high-end Rollermatic models.|$|R
40|$|Under the {{supervision}} of Professors William Beckman and John Mitchell; 139 pp. Heated rollers {{are used in the}} forest product, printing and plastic processing industry to regulate product temperature during web processing. Improved regulation of product temperatures during processing results in a higher quality product as well as reduced waste and energy usage. This project leads to better understanding of the thermal contact resistance and the thermal interactions between heated plastic webs and rollers. A new experimental method to measure the contact resistance between the two surfaces of one rigid and one pliable material is developed and used to measure the thermal contact resistance of a different plastic web to roller interfaces. Two blocks, initially at different temperatures, are brought together with the sample being studied between the blocks. The resulting time temperature profile can be used to determine the joint contact resistance. The physically static, thermally transient technique allows joint resistance measurements to be made quickly and easily using minimal equipment. The average joint resistances measured for the polyester, polypropylene and embossed polyethylene samples were 0. 0006, 0. 0007 and 0. 0028 m 2 -K/W respectively over a pressure range of 0. 25 to 6 kpa. A finite difference model of the web and roller system was used to model the heat <b>transfer</b> between <b>rollers</b> and webs. Given the required roller and web inlet conditions, the program could calculate the web outlet temperature and power draw from the roller. The roller model was developed with following intentions and results: 1. To simulate an internally heated roller as well as a roller having surface heat generation. Little difference was found in the surface temperature profiles of the differently heated rollers, but for the internally heated roller case, the hot fluid supply temperature needed was substantially higher than the actual roller surface temperature. 2. To develop a simple algebraic correlation that predicts the web heating effectiveness for thin webs accurately. This was achieved for plastic webs of less than 0. 30 mm thickness over a wide range of processing conditions. 3. To calculate the roller to web interface contact resistance based on measured web inlet, outlet and roller surface temperatures. A series of tests with a pilot scale facility was used to determine the effect of air entrainment on the contact resistance. The contact resistance measured in the static tests was then used to predict the web heating found in dynamic tests cases using the pilot scale facility. Infrared pyrometers were used extensively in the experiments and were the limiting factor in experimental accuracy. Good agreement was found for the opaque PVC sample within the experimental margin of error. For the highly translucent plastics, the static and dynamic tests did not show a good match, and the high error in the infrared temperature measurements was apparent...|$|R
40|$|Nearshore {{processes}} on barred beaches are {{studied with}} a process-based numerical model. The two major {{goals of the}} study are to expand the body of knowledge about nearshore processes on barred beaches gaining {{a better understanding of}} the physical mechanisms affecting bar migration events and to enhance the numerical model in order to accomplish realistic simulations of bar migration events on storm time scales. The numerical model is used to study the effect of physical processes on the hydrodynamics and morphodynamics in the nearshore environment. The numerical model system consists of a linear spectral refraction-diffraction model, REF/DIF S, a quasi- 3 D nearshore circulation module, SHORECIRC, energetics-based sediment transport models, and a morphological evolution model. A laboratory experiment with an offshore bar migration case followed by an onshore bar migration case is used for modeling purposes and verifications. A number of enhancements are made to the wave and circulation modules of the numerical model system specifically for simulations on barred beaches. The model modifications and enhancements are: a combined breaking wave parameter with a spatial variation in the wave model, a method accounting for breaking wave persistence in the wave model, a method accounting for the new breaker roller lag in the wave model, the dynamic pressure component in the radiation stress forcing, a roller contribution with different depth variation options for the short wave forcing in the circulation model, wave height instead of water depth as the turbulent length scale in the eddy viscosity calculations in the circulation model, and a slope term for the default sediment transport formula. The effect of surface shape parameter and the roller face angle on radiation stress and mean water level predictions are investigated. In reality, the organized wave energy is <b>transferred</b> to <b>roller</b> development over a transition distance and the roller does not immediately contribute to the radiation stresses; therefore, showing the importance of the roller lag mechanism for mean water level predictions. The cross-shore variation of the vertical momentum balance is studied to observe the variation of forcing agents of the undertow current. The cross-shore pressure gradient is the most dominant forcing term affecting the depth structure of the undertow current. The effect of different depth variations of the roller contribution to the short wave forcing on the undertow current is investigated. The mechanism accounting for breaking wave persistence and the mechanism accounting for the roller lag are shown to be important for predictions of the undertow currents on barred beaches. The skewed wave orbital velocities are introduced to the linear wave model by an empirical parametrization method and are found to contribute strongly to the onshore bar migration. The enhancements made to the wave dissipation and roller are found to significantly affect the predicted migration of the bar as well as the maintainance of the trough. Ph. D.

40|$|Purpose. Lack of {{kinematics}} {{models and}} imperfection {{of the known}} dynamics models of the roller bearings of railway rolling stock axle-boxes do not allow designing the optimal structure of bearing cages, providing the required service life and reliability of bearing units of wheel sets for cars and locomotives. The studies of kinematics and dynamics of roller bearings of axle boxes for cars and locomotives and modeling of their parts interaction to create the analytical method of bearing cages calculation are necessary. Methodology. This purpose has been achieved due to the modeling of kinematics of the ideal (without gaps) and real (taking account the gaps, manufacturing and installation errors) bearings, substantiation of the transfer mechanism of motion from the rollers to bearing cage, modeling the dynamics of rolling, research of interaction forces of the rollers with bearing cage. Findings. It is established that the kinematics of ideal bearing {{is determined by the}} contact deformations of the rollers and rings, when the kinematics of real bearing depends mainly on the side gaps in the windows of the bearing cage. On the basis of studies of the real bearing kinematics the dynamics models of the rollers and bearing cage interaction were constructed. The conducted studies of kinematics and dynamics of rolling bearings have changed our view of them as of the planetary mechanism, explained the reason of bearing cage loading, and confirmed the possibility of destruction during operation. Originality. It was first proposed a mechanism for motion <b>transfer</b> from the <b>rollers</b> to the bearing cage of roller bearings, consisting in that the side gap in the bearing cage window is reduced gradually multiple of the number of rollers of radial loading area according to the bearing cage motion. The models of roller bearing dynamics, which allow calculating the interaction forces of parts for all modes of operation, were improved. Practical value. Use of the offered models of kinematics and dynamics of the roller bearings will develop analytical calculation method of the bearing cage for the choice of its optimal design according to criterion of maximum service life and reliability of the bearing unit of wheel sets of the railway rolling stock...|$|R
40|$|The {{work in this}} {{dissertation}} {{is focused}} on ultrasonic inspection of bearing components. Roller bearings sustain the heavy loads railcars can often encounter in the rail industry and consist of an inner and outer ring with <b>rollers</b> <b>transferring</b> the load between the two. Rollers in smaller bearings are typically spherical with {{the contours of the}} rings conforming closely to this spherical geometry. Tapered roller bearings were designed to increase this load capacity by increasing the contact area between the rollers and raceways by using rollers of cylindrical shape. This design allows for the support of heavier railcars but introduces a higher likelihood of encountering a defect below the contact surfaces due to increased contact area between rollers and rings. ^ In this work, metrics for ultrasonic quantification of inclusion content are described and applied to railcar bearings. An analysis program is then developed to quantify inclusion content in a consistent manner regardless of the part geometry such that meaningful comparisons between different steels can be made. Ultrasonic scanning methods and reference parts for equipment setup and calibration are also described. ^ In a similar manner, an alternative mode of defect detection is employed to detect inclusions in this critical region utilizing surface waves which propagate only near the surface of the part. The analysis code developed also characterizes these defects in terms of similar metrics for comparison between steels. Inspection routines and novel reference parts for verification of experimental setup and parameters are developed. ^ Predictions of the ultrasonic attenuation of waves in the presence of several types of defects are presented {{as a result of the}} analysis and theoretical development. The work presents predictions of detection limits in terms of both defect size and type, as well as the incorporation of steel characteristics such as the average grain size. ^ Bulk inspection of defects is modeled considering backscattered signals as a function of defect size and type, as well as the grain size of the steel used. Predictions of backscattered amplitude are given for defects with sizes and types that are of concern for fatigue considerations. Previous studies utilize an approach that models grain noise and defect backscatter independently. This work presents a unified approach to this problem that has not been performed previously. ...|$|R
40|$|The North Endcap Calorimeter (NEC) is to {{be moved}} from the clean room to the north {{sidewalk}} {{in preparation for the}} final installation on the DO detector center beam. In order to make this move, the cable bridge must be 'flattened' and the NEC lifted to move over it. The detector is moved west, approximately 24 feet, while the moveable counting house remains stationary. This movement allows the cable bridge to 'flatten' i. e. become horizontal. The cable bridge lowering is steadied and stabilized by 7. 5 ton hoist mounted on the moveable counting house. By moving the detector to lower the bridge, a vacancy has been created in the pit that must be filled {{to the level of the}} clean room rail elevation. This filler will consist of concrete shield blocks, stacked in two rows. These rows are spaced appropriately to match the wheel base of the EC transporter. A steel plate is placed on top of each row of shield blocks and leveled to the elevation of the clean room rails. Steel plates will be installed and leveled on the north sidewalk similar to those used on the south sidewalk for the CC installation. These plates are used as rails for the Hilman rollers, bearing surfaces for shim blocks used during lifting and anchors for holding the transporter extension units and the transfer bridge. After the plates are installed, the transfer bridge is put in place, spanning the cable bridge, shimmed and leveled. The transporter extension units are positioned next to the transfer bridge on the north sidewalk. With the completion of this prep work, the actual transfer of the NEC from the clean room can begin. The NEC is pulled from the clean room with the same mechanism (cyl. and chain) that was used for the CC and the pull anchor point will be located at the end of the concrete blocks. The NEC will come out of the north west door in the clean room and move along the temporary rail plates in the pit until it is in line with the transfer bridge. At this point the NEC is ready to be elevated to the level of the transfer bridge. The elevation process is the same as that used for the CC installation. When the correct elevation is attained the transporter extensions are positioned and fastened to the transporter on the south side. Static column supports will be added underneath the transporter to minimize deflections as the NEC is rolled off. The carriage extensions are now put in place and the Hilman <b>rollers</b> <b>transferred</b> into position under the extensions. The NEC is now ready to be pulled off of the transporter and onto the transfer bridge. Again using the Cyl. and chain mechanism, with the anchor point attached to the transporter extension on the north sidewalk, pull the NEC completely off of the transporter and onto the transfer bridge. Once the NEC is on the transfer bridge a rearrangement of equipment must be done. The transporter extension on the north sidewalk is decoupled from the transfer bridge and moved against the wall of the fixed counting area. The transporter extension at the south end of the transporter is removed, the transporter is decoupled from and moved to the north side of the transfer bridge. The transporter is supported from the floor at an elevation equal to the transfer bridge and coupled to it. The transporter extension is fastened to the north end of the transporter. The movement of the NEC now continues until it is back on the transporter. At this time the transfer bridge, concrete shield blocks and steel plates in the pit are removed. The detector is moved back to its normal parked position(cable bridge up). The NEC is lowered to the sidewalk (reverse of elevation procedure). Welding of the heads is then finished prior to final installation on the center beam. The final installation is identical to the CC installation, using all the same equipment. The finite element analysis of the transfer bridge design was done by Kay Weber of the Accelerator Mechanical Support Group...|$|R
