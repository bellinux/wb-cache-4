Mario Vargas Llosa wrote of Trujillo's machismo and {{treatment}} of women, [...] "e went to bed with his ministers' wives, not only because he liked <b>these</b> <b>ladies</b> {{but because it was}} a way to test his ministers. He wanted to know if they were ready to accept this extreme humiliation. Mainly the ministers were prepared to play this grotesque roleand they remained loyal to Trujillo even after his death." [...] Trujillo's sexual conquests and public humiliations of his enemies also serve to affirm his political power and machismo. In Niessa's words, [...] "The implication is that maximum virility equals political dominance." ...|$|E
500|$|Destiny's Child {{recorded}} R {{songs with}} styles that encompasses urban, contemporary, and dance-pop. In the group's original line-up, Knowles {{was the lead}} vocalist, Rowland was the second lead vocalist, Luckett was on soprano, and Roberson was on alto. Knowles remained as the lead vocalist in the group's final line-up as a trio, however, Rowland and Williams also took turns in singing lead {{for the majority of}} their songs. Destiny's Child cited R singer Janet Jackson as one of their influences. Ann Powers of The New York Times described Destiny's Child music as [...] "fresh and emotional... <b>these</b> <b>ladies</b> have the best mixes, the savviest samples and especially the most happening beats." [...] In the same publication, Jon Pareles noted that the sound that defines Destiny's Child, aside from Knowles' voice, [...] "is the way its melodies jump in and out of double-time. Above brittle, syncopated rhythm tracks, quickly articulated verses alternate with smoother choruses." [...] The group usually harmonize their vocals in their songs, especially on the ballads. In most instances of their songs, each member sings one verse and chimes in at the chorus. In their third album Survivor (2001), each member sings lead in the majority of the songs. Knowles said, [...] "...everybody {{is a part of the}} music... Everybody is singing lead on every song, and it's so great—because now Destiny's Child is at the point vocally and mentally that it should be at." [...] Knowles, however, completely led songs like [...] "Brown Eyes" [...] and [...] "Dangerously in Love". The group explored their lyrics to man-to-woman relationship, sisterhood and female empowerment anthems.|$|E
500|$|Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian {{commented that}} the lead vocals of the songs {{were likely to be}} sung by each member equally, noting that it made the album a [...] "democratic" [...] one; however she criticized them for {{squandering}} [...] "the extent of their talents" [...] on the album. Tom Sinclair of Entertainment Weekly also noticed its [...] "overall air of democracy at work" [...] and noted that Destiny Fulfilled [...] "often moves at a molasses-like pace, weighted down with a preponderance of exquisitely executed but ultimately dull ballads". Jenny Eliscu of Rolling Stone magazine echoed his comments, saying, [...] "In all but a couple of songs, the verses are divided into three sections, with Beyonce leading things off, followed by Rowland, then Williams". She noted that after a couple of upbeat songs, [...] "the album slumps into an endless string of overwrought R ballads where the only saving grace is... <b>these</b> <b>ladies</b> can harmonize like nobody's business." [...] Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine has {{commented that the}} ballads of the album build into [...] "the same sort of standoffish sexual supply-and-demand bartering that has marred their worst tracks". Most of the critics questioned why Beyoncé had to return to Destiny's Child after achieving the most success among the members of the group. Henderson lambasted Beyoncé to performing again with the group with the [...] "full intention" [...] of taking advantage to bolster her [...] "divette" [...] status to superstardom. In May 2006, Destiny Fulfilled was listed at number 24 on a list titled [...] "The 50 Worst Albums Ever!" [...] compiled by Q magazine.|$|E

It is said that <b>these</b> <b>ladies</b> came here after the event of the battle of Karbala on the 10th day of the month of Muharram in 61 AH (October 10, CE 680). Bibi Pak Daman, which means the [...] "chaste lady", is the collective name of the six ladies believed to interred at this mausoleum, though it is also (mistakenly) popularly used to refer to the personage of Ruqayyah bint Ali alone. They were among the women who brought Islam to South Asia, preaching and engaging in missionary activity in the environs of Lahore. It is said that Data Ganj Bakhsh, considered a great Sufi saint of the South Asia, was himself a devotee of the Bibi Pak Daman shrine and received holy knowledge from this auspicious shrine.|$|E
2500|$|Writing {{about the}} character's {{popularity}} in cosplay community, where hers, Ayane's and Leifang's {{has been most}} popular DOA cosplays among the Japanese, Brian Ashcraft of Kotaku stated in 2012: [...] "Kasumi {{is one of the}} most iconic characters in Japanese gaming. Her ninja outfit in its various colors is instantly recognizable. She isn't merely in Dead or Alive; she is Dead or Alive." [...] Actress and model Leila Arcieri chose the [...] "incredible" [...] Kasumi as a game character she would team up with if needed. WomanGamers.com appreciated Kasumi's portrayal [...] "as a woman of action and deeds" [...] who is [...] "willing to risk everything in order to search for her missing brother". The website opined the character suffered from [...] "the 'jiggle wiggle peek-a-boo factor' for which the series is both famous and infamous", but nevertheless rated her 8.14/10 as [...] "a very pleasing character." [...] It also positively noted [...] "the popularity of the DOA characters with Japanese females, coupled with the fact that <b>these</b> <b>ladies</b> are not portrayed as damsels in distress but instead are shown to be dangerous opponents with their own agendas." [...] The pseudonym of professional gamer Marjorie Bartell [...] "Kasumi Chan" [...] was inspired by the character. The alias of another professional gamer, Marie-Laure Norindr [...] "Kayane" [...] from France, was created from a conjunction of the names of her two favourite DOA characters, Kasumi and Ayane.

2500|$|Because Aretha Franklin {{made the}} song “Respect” a hit, many who sampled {{and cover the}} song {{referred}} to Franklin’s version rather than Otis’s. For instance, Diana Ross & The Supremes and the Temptations made a cover of this song in their collaborated LP “Diana Ross & the Supremes Join the Temptations." [...] The Supremes were a female group consisting of Diana Ross, Mary Wilson, and Florence Ballard. Later this group would be known as Diana Ross & The Supremes. The Temptations, on the other hand, were a male group consisting of Eddie Kendricks, Paul Williams, Otis Williams, Melvin Franklin and Elbridge “Al” Bryant.” Both groups were signed under Berry Gordy’s Motown Record Label and it was Gordy’s idea to pair up his two most successful artists. With this collaborative LP, Gordy also organized a prime-time special TV program titled “TCB,” a commonly used abbreviation standing for “Taking Care of Business.” [...] Among the songs on the LP that were performed on this program included a cover of Aretha Franklin’s version of “Respect.” The two groups took Franklin’s message to new heights as the male versus female duet illustrated a battle of each gender demanding their own respect. Additionally, this cover highlights the Supremes’ own battle for racial equality. Much like Aretha Franklin, The Supremes’ rise to fame coincided with the Civil Rights Movement, in which <b>these</b> <b>ladies</b> used their fame and status {{in the fight for}} racial equality. The Supremes were the most successful Motown group to break down racial boundaries within the popular music industry. They represented racial integration, black empowerment, and black womanhood and their cover of “Respect” with the Temptations illustrates that.|$|E
