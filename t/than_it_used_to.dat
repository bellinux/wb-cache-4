Today, the body of water is less productive <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> be because of runoff from urban areas (mostly on the Western Shore) and farms (especially on the Eastern Shore and in the Susquehanna River watershed), over-harvesting, and invasion of foreign species.|$|E
25|$|Under {{all three}} of the {{conceptual}} approaches to animal cruelty discussed above, performing unnecessary experiments or demonstrations upon animals that cause them substantial pain or distress may be viewed as cruelty. Due to changes in ethical standards, this type of cruelty tends to be less common today <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> be in the past. For example, schoolroom demonstrations of oxygen depletion routinely suffocated birds by placing them under a glass cover, and animals were suffocated in the Cave of Dogs to demonstrate the density and toxicity of carbon dioxide to curious travellers on the Grand Tour.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn the {{classical}} bin packing problem one {{is given a}} list of items and asked to pack them into the fewest possible unit-sized bins. Given two lists, L 1 and L 2, where L 2 is derived from L 1 by deleting some elements of L 1 and/or reducing the size of some elements of L 1, one might hope that an approximation algorithm would use no more bins to pack L 2 <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>uses</b> <b>to</b> pack L 1. Johnson and Graham have given examples showing that First-Fit and First-Fit Decreasing can actually <b>use</b> more bins <b>to</b> pack L 2 than L 1. Graham has also studied this type of behavior among multiprocessor scheduling algorithms. In the present paper we extend this study of anomalous behavior to a broad class of approximation algorithms for bin packing. To do this we introduce a technique which allows one to characterize the monotonic/anomalous behavior of any algorithm in a large, natural class. We then derive {{upper and lower bounds}} on the anomalous behavior of the algorithms which are anomalous and provide conditions under which a normally nonmonotonic algorithm becomes monotonic...|$|R

25|$|Fogg {{had thought}} it was one day more than it {{actually}} was, because he had forgotten this simple fact. During his journey, he had added a full day to his clock, at the rhythm of an hour per fifteen degrees, or four minutes per degree, as Verne writes. At the time, {{the concept of a}} de jure International Date Line did not exist. If it did, he would have been made aware {{that it would be a}} day less <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> be once he reached this line. Thus, the day he would add to his clock throughout his journey would be thoroughly removed upon crossing this imaginary line. But a de facto date line did exist since the UK, India and the US had the same calendar with different local times, and he should have noticed when he arrived to the US that the local date was not the same as in his diary (his servant Jean Passepartout kept his clock in London time, despite the tips of his surroundings).|$|E
25|$|After the riot, Trench {{recognised}} {{the necessity}} to implement further reform of the government. So, with the assistance from Holmes, the government began a City District Officer Scheme in May 1968 {{which was based on}} the existing District Officer system in the New Territories. Under the new scheme, Hong Kong Island and Kowloon were divided into 10 different districts. Each district had a District Office where the District Officer concerned could collect public opinions, receive complaints and provide advice and quick responses. This scheme effectively drew the relationship {{between the government and the}} general public closer <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> be, as the general public could easily express their needs and demands to the District Officer nearby. Alongside the reform, the Secretariat for Chinese Affairs was reorganised into the Home Affairs Department in February 1969 while the post of the Secretary for Chinese Affairs was renamed into the Secretary for Home Affairs. Holmes continued to serve after the reorganisation and was made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in the same year. Before retiring from the Home Affairs Department, he had been focusing on the legislation on abolishing polygyny. Yet, such legislation was completed in October 1971, five months after his retirement from the civil service.|$|E

[...] He illustrates by pointing out that steroids in a baseball player's system do not cause home runs all by themselves but do make home runs more likely.

500|$|Bridge Street Bridge (Chantry Bridge) is a {{single-span}} metal {{bridge that}} carries Bridge Street over the navigation. [...] The street continues eastwards and originally crossed {{the river at}} Rotherham Bridge. [...] As originally constructed in 1483 the bridge had four arches and was [...] wide, but it was widened and a fifth arch added in 1768. In 1930 a new bridge was built nearby, a little further upstream, {{and as part of}} the work, the fifth arch was removed and the bridge was returned to its Medieval width. Because of improvements to the river made in the 18th and 19th centuries, it is wider <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> be, and the bridge no longer reaches the west bank. [...] The chapel on the bridge is one of only three complete bridge chapels that still exist in Britain, the other two being at Wakefield, West Yorkshire, and St Ives, Huntingdonshire. Dating from about 1483, it remained in use as a chapel until the reign of King Edward VI (1547–1553). It was put to use as almshouses during the 17th and 18th centuries, and in 1779 it was used as a prison. Later, it became a private dwelling and finally a tobacconist's shop, before being returned to its original use as a chapel; it was formally reconsecrated in 1924 by the Bishop of Sheffield.|$|E

500|$|Yorke is Radiohead's {{principal}} songwriter and lyricist; songs usually {{begin with}} a sketch by Yorke, which is harmonically developed by Jonny Greenwood before the other members develop their own parts. Arrangement is a collaborative effort, with all the band members having roles in the process; all the band's songs are credited to [...] "Radiohead". While Jonny Greenwood plays most lead guitar parts, O'Brien makes use of effects units to create ambient effects. The Kid A and Amnesiac sessions brought a change in Radiohead's musical style and working method. Since their shift from conventional rock music instrumentation toward an emphasis on electronic sound, the members have gained flexibility and now regularly switch instruments depending on the particular song requirements. On Kid A and Amnesiac, Yorke played keyboard and bass, while Jonny Greenwood often played ondes Martenot, bassist Colin Greenwood worked on sampling, and O'Brien and Selway branched out to drum machines and digital manipulation, also finding ways to incorporate their primary instruments, guitar and percussion, respectively, into the new sound. The relaxed 2003 recording sessions for Hail to the Thief led to a different dynamic in Radiohead, with Yorke admitting in interviews that his power in the band had been [...] "absolutely unbalanced" [...] {{and that he would}} [...] "subvert everybody else's power at all costs.

Ryan Gilbey of The Independent {{considered the}} film wise {{to dispense with}} the cast of The Original Series: [...] "For the first time, a Star Trek movie actually looks like something more ambitious than an extended TV show," [...] he wrote. Conversely, critic Bob Thompson felt that First Contact was more {{in the spirit of}} the 1960s television series than any previous installment. The Globe and Mail Elizabeth Renzeti said that First Contact succeeded in improving on the [...] "stilted" [...] previous entry in the series, and that it featured a renewed interest in storytelling. Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times wrote, [...] "First Contact does everything you'd want a Star Trek film to do, and it does it with cheerfulness and style." [...] Adrian Martin of The Age noted that the film was geared towards pleasing fans: [...] "Strangers to this fanciful world first delineated by Gene Roddenberry will just have to struggle to comprehend as best they can," [...] he wrote, but [...] "cult-followers will be in heaven". The New York Times Janet Maslin said that the [...] "film's convoluted plot will boggle all but hard-core devotees" [...] of the series, while Variety Joe Leydon wrote that the film did not require intimate knowledge of the series and that fans and non-fans alike would enjoy the film. While Renzetti considered the lack of old characters from the previous seven movies a welcome change, Maslin said that without the original stars, [...] "The series now lacks [...] much of its earlier determination. It has morphed into something less innocent and more derivative <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> be, something the noncultist is never less likely to enjoy." [...] For one thing, this film's convoluted plot will boggle all but hard-core devotees. }} Conversely, Roger Ebert called First Contact one of the best Star Trek films, and James Berardinelli found the film the most entertaining Star Trek feature in a decade; [...] "It has single-handedly revived the Star Trek movie series, at least from a creative point of view," [...] he wrote.|$|E

50|$|The {{present day}} range of Ascinara {{is much less}} <b>than</b> what <b>it</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> be, {{as a result of}} both climatic changes and {{increased}} competition. In New Zealand in particular, the range of A. lucida has decreased. This is not a result of a pollen limitation, as Ascarina produces enough pollen to spread far beyond its habitable range, and even cross water to islands near New Zealand, but rather its vulnerability to both drought and frost. A. lucida grew reliably in regions of approximately 1500mm rainfall, and abundantly in areas of approximately 2500mm rainfall. In addition, a light frost would cause severe damage to leaves and flower buds. This vulnerability to climate change limits the range in which Ascarina can grow.|$|R

And at her performance of the same opera in London in 1957 (her first performance at Covent Garden after the weight loss), critics again felt her voice had changed for the better, that it had now supposedly become a more precise instrument, with a new focus. Many of her most critically acclaimed appearances are from the period 1954–1958 (Norma, La traviata, Sonnambula and Lucia of 1955, Anna Bolena of 1957, Medea of 1958, to name a few).|$|E
