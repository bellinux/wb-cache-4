5|$|A {{commission}} {{run by the}} Federal Council of Churches in America sought {{issuance of}} a half dollar to mark the anniversary, and the bill passed through Congress without opposition in 1923 and was signed by President Warren G. Harding. Sketches were prepared by commission chairman Rev. John Baer Stoudt and converted <b>to</b> <b>plaster</b> models by the Mint's aging chief engraver, George T. Morgan. The models were initially rejected by the Commission of Fine Arts, which required revisions {{under the supervision of}} Buffalo nickel designer James Earle Fraser.|$|E
5|$|Allosaurus is {{regarded}} as senior synonym of the genera Creosaurus, Epanterias, and Labrosaurus. Most of the species that are regarded as synonyms of A. fragilis, or that were misassigned to the genus, are obscure and were based on scrappy remains. One exception is Labrosaurus ferox, named in 1884 by Marsh for an oddly formed partial lower jaw, with a prominent gap in the tooth row {{at the tip of}} the jaw, and a rear section greatly expanded and turned down. Later researchers suggested that the bone was pathologic, showing an injury to the living animal, and that part of the unusual form of the rear of the bone was due <b>to</b> <b>plaster</b> reconstruction. It is now regarded as an example of A. fragilis.|$|E

5|$|Alumni Hall was {{constructed}} by the Benedictine monks and local contractors from 1891 through the winter of 1892; the building was designed by Patrick W. Ford, an Irish-American architect from Boston. Nearing completion in February 1892, {{all that remained was}} for workers to continue <b>to</b> <b>plaster</b> the interior walls; sadly, a fire which was most likely caused by a heating stove's gate not closed completely, sparked an ember and destroyed the entire structure. Thankfully, no one was seriously hurt because of the fire. The monks were forced to rebuild the college, spending considerably less money on the construction, as they had only received $55,000 from the Insurance Commissioner of the State of New Hampshire. In an effort to save money, many bricks were salvaged from the previous structure and pieces of granite were cut from large granite rocks still visible on the current quad. In 1893, the current building that remains the center of campus was completed; the fire delayed the first academic semester by one year. To avoid the possibility of another fire, a power house {{was constructed}} separately from the building. Farmland complete with livestock, beanpoles and tomato plants lined the present-day quad and adjacent fields, as the monks were completely self-sufficient. In 1912, the bell tower (the inside is pictured to the right) and ivy were added to the building; in 1923, the college's second chapel (the first being located on the second floor at the present-day business office) was constructed as a connecting wing. Today this second chapel is the college's Chapel Arts Center, which hosts art exhibits and other cultural events. It still boasts ornate stained glass windows and painted ceilings.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the best}} {{preserved}} phases of Temple 16 is the Rosalila, built over the remains of five previous versions of the temple. Archaeologist Ricardo Agurcia discovered the almost intact shrine while tunneling underneath {{the final version of}} the temple. Rosalila is notable for its excellent state of preservation, including the entire building from the base platform up to the roof comb, including its highly elaborate painted stucco decoration. Rosalila features K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' placed at the centre of a mythological tableau, combining the founder of the dynasty with the sky deity Itzamna in avian form. The mythological imagery also includes anthropomorphic mountains, skeletons and crocodiles. Vents in the exterior were designed so smoke from incense being burned inside the shrine would interact with the stucco sculpture of the exterior. The temple had a hieroglyphic stone step with a dedicatory inscription. The stone step is less well preserved than the rest of the building, but a date in AD571 has been deciphered. Due to the deforestation of the Copán valley, the Rosalila building was the last structure at the site to use such elaborate stucco decoration — vast quantities of firewood could no longer be spared to reduce limestone <b>to</b> <b>plaster.</b> A life-size copy of the Rosalila building has been built at the Copán site museum.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the medical}} {{treatment}} {{she had received}} in San Francisco, Kahlo's health problems continued throughout the 1940s. Due to her spinal problems, she wore twenty-eight separate supportive corsets, varying from steel and leather <b>to</b> <b>plaster,</b> between 1940 and 1954. She also experienced pain in her legs, while the infection on her hand had become chronic, and she also underwent treatment for syphilis. In addition, {{the death of her}} father in April 1941 plunged her into a depression. Her ill health made her increasingly confined to La Casa Azul, which became the center of her world. She enjoyed taking care of the house and its garden, and was kept company by friends, servants, and various pets, including spider monkeys, Xoloitzcuintlis, and parrots.|$|E

50|$|This tropic heat {{actually}} {{is the cause}} that the steel structure, which most roofs {{in that part of}} the world are built on, expands and contracts all the time. By doing so, the sun-battered steel structure causes the roof tiles to dislodge and slowly creates small openings between the roof tiles, through which rain water can run into, creating leaks that can cause much damage <b>to</b> <b>plastered</b> ceilings and electric wiring.|$|R

25|$|Controversy erupted {{before the}} fight when Mosley's trainer, Naazim Richardson, {{observed}} that Margarito had a pasty white substance in his handwraps. One doctor described this material as plaster {{hidden in the}} wrapped hands of Margarito, leading to accusations {{that he may have}} been trying to cheat. At Richardson's insistence, California State Inspector Dean Lohuis called for Margarito's hands to be rewrapped. According to Judd Burstein, the attorney for Mosley, Margarito had wet pads in the wrapping. Mosley's doctor, Robert Olvera, likened the material to the type of plaster used to make casts. Burstein said he seized the pad removed from the wrapping and another pad found in Margarito's dressing room. Both were placed in a sealed box that was given to Lohuis for further study. The California Department of Justice laboratory later confirmed the substance to be similar in nature <b>to</b> <b>plaster</b> of Paris.|$|E
500|$|The {{painting}} is in poor condition. Time and a complicated transfer– which involved mounting crumbling plaster onto canvas– have caused extensive damage and significant paint loss. The work {{seems to have}} been seriously damaged even before its removal from the walls of Goya's home; the base of dry plaster may have contributed to its early deterioration. Frescos completed on dry (rather than wet) plaster cannot survive for a long period on a roughened surface. Evan Connell believes that in applying oil <b>to</b> <b>plaster</b> Goya [...] "made a technical mistake that all but guaranteed disintegration".|$|E
500|$|Officials in Maine {{wanted a}} {{commemorative}} half dollar to circulate as {{an advertisement for}} the centennial of the state's admission to the Union, and of the planned celebrations. A bill to allow such a coin passed Congress without opposition, but then the state's centennial commission decided to sell the coins at $1, double the face value. [...] The Commission of Fine Arts disliked the proposed design, and urged changes, but Maine officials insisted, and de Francisci converted the sketches <b>to</b> <b>plaster</b> models, from which coinage dies could be made.|$|E

2500|$|Marshall Fredericks, {{a renowned}} Michigan sculptor, agreed {{to create the}} figure of Christ for the Cross. The process took four years from {{sketches}} <b>to</b> <b>plaster</b> mold. The figure was then cast in bronze at the Kristians-Kunst Metalstobori Foundry in Oslo, Norway. Weighing seven tons and [...] tall from head to toe, {{it was one of}} the largest castings to ever be shipped across the Atlantic Ocean. [...] Workers raised the sculpture into place August 9, 1959, and attached to the Cross with 13 bolts [...] long and [...] in diameter. The formal dedication occurred seven days later.|$|E
2500|$|This {{ceiling was}} done {{at the time the}} new Chapel was built. It would not have been {{possible}} to remove a wood and plaster ceiling entire, or even in pieces, and re-erect it, and there would have been no need for an expensive model if the old vaulting had been in the College, ready to put up again. Also, the entry of 18 June 1659, [...] "began <b>to</b> <b>plaster</b> the Chapel roof" [...] which, doubtless, refers to the panels of plaster between the wood ribs. It may be objected that this is very late for a fan-vaulted roof, and so it would be anywhere but in Oxford. The fan-vaulting in St. Mary's Porch was done in 1637, and the great fan-vaulted staircase at Christ Church was not done until 1640. So there is no reason at all why it should not have seemed quite the natural thing to cover even a partially Renaissance building in this manner, especially one with so much Gothic feeling about its windows.|$|E
2500|$|When Dean Amos died in 1941, the new {{quarters}} {{were still}} unfinished. The Alumnae Association created the Thyrsa W. Amos Fund <b>to</b> <b>plaster</b> {{the walls and}} to furnish Room 1217 in her name. Room 1217 was never finished, but after World War II the other rooms on the twelfth floor were completed including room 1201, {{now known as the}} Braun Room. Mrs. A. E. Braun donated the furnishings and floral carved mahogany wood paneling which she had purchased in 1941 from the library of the home of Grant McCargo in the East End of Pittsburgh. The Braun Room was dedicated in 1946 and serves, along with its furniture, {{as an example of a}} modern reproduction of Louis XV design. Original blue carpeting was replaced in 1955 with a Persian rug, named [...] "The Iron Rug of Persia", that was donated by the daughter and son-in-law of A. E. Braun. Restored in 2015, the rug was made for a regional Khan in the northern part of Iran around 1810. Other features of the room include a low bookcase, bordered and topped with classic carving, that was crafted by university carpenters to replace the original fireplace whose inclusion was impractical on the 12th floor, along with two crystal drop chandeliers.|$|E
