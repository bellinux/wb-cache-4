I also {{believe that this}} nation has got a deep affection for Queen Elizabeth." [...] It was her view {{that it would be}} {{appropriate}} for Australia to become a republic only once Queen Elizabeth II's reign ends. On the process for becoming a republic, Gillard said [...] "What I would like to see as the prime minister is <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>work</b> our way through to an agreement on a republic." [...] In 2010, then opposition leader Tony Abbott, who previously served as Executive Director of Australians for Constitutional Monarchy, supported the status quo.

[...] Kate Kendall, executive director of the National Center for Lesbian Rights, said of her experience with Wolfson at Lambda: [...] "What I can now say is that, in the intervening years, what has been made unmistakably clear to me by the lesbians and gay men <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>work</b> with and represent, is that the denial of our right to marry exacerbates our marginalization; winning that right is the cornerstone of full justice." ...|$|E

Johansson reportedly resigned because of [...] "a fundamental difference of opinion {{in regards to the}} boycott, divestment and sanctions movement". In her statement she described SodaStream as [...] "not only committed to the environment but to building a bridge to peace between Israel and Palestine, supporting neighbours working alongside each other, receiving equal pay, equal benefits and equal rights". SodaStream CEO Daniel Birnbaum has also accused Oxfam of supporting the BDS movement against Israel as a whole, a charge Oxfam denied, saying that [...] "this is about trade from the settlements" [...] and specific to settlements outside Israel's pre-1967 border. which Oxfam states, due to their location, pose an obstacle to any future two-state solution.|$|E
