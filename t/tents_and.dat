5|$|The mass {{influx of}} {{refugees}} presented various social issues for South Vietnam. The new arrivals {{needed to be}} integrated into society with jobs and housing, as long periods in <b>tents</b> <b>and</b> temporary housing would sap morale and possibly foster pro-communist sympathies. Diem had to devise programs to ease his new citizens into the economic system.|$|E
5|$|The {{retreating}} Muslim {{army was}} met by the ferocious Arab women in the camps.

5|$|A {{receiving}} station was formed from the immobile sections of light horse and mounted rifle brigades' field ambulances, a section from the 1/1st Welsh and the 157th Indian Field Ambulances with an operating unit, the Anzac Field Laboratory, and a detachment from an Egyptian hospital. This Receiving Station {{took over the}} site near Jericho, occupied by the main dressing station during the two Transjordan attacks, which could accommodate 200 patients in mud huts, 400 patients in <b>tents,</b> <b>and</b> 700 patients in the abandoned Desert Mounted Corps headquarters.|$|E

5|$|Following Cyprien, the Government of Madagascar did not request {{international}} assistance in post-storm recovery. By January10, a cargo plane carrying 65million MGF (2002 MGF; US$10,062) worth of relief supplies was deployed to the affected regions. The supplies, consisting of medical supplies, <b>tents,</b> <b>and</b> one tonne of rice, {{were given to}} local authorities to be distributed to the affected population. Sanitary items were also distributed {{by the government to}} avoid an outbreak of water-borne diseases such as diarrhea and cholera.|$|E

In many drawings there is a strong sense of waiting: waiting to move into battle, waiting for the war to end, waiting to be sent home.|$|E
5|$|Jerome had a {{post office}} by 1883. It added a schoolhouse in 1884 and a public library in 1889. After four major fires between 1894 and 1898 {{destroyed}} much of the business district {{and half of the}} community's homes, Jerome was incorporated as a town in 1899. Incorporation made it possible to collect taxes to build a formal fire-fighting system and to establish building codes that prohibited <b>tents</b> <b>and</b> other fire hazards within the town limits. Local merchant and rancher William Munds was the first mayor.|$|E

5|$|Larry Schmittou {{sold his}} {{majority}} {{interest in the}} Sounds to Al Gordon, president of AmeriSports Companies LLC, before the 1997 season. The new ownership group refurbished every area of the stadium, including the concession stands, bathrooms, concourse, stadium exterior, home clubhouse (a visitor's clubhouse had been built under the third base bleachers for the 1996 season), and parking lots. Several sections of bleachers in left field past third base were removed and replaced by <b>tents</b> <b>and</b> a group picnic area. This brought the seating capacity to 11,500.|$|E
5|$|Manning {{became the}} target of {{bullying}} at the school {{because she was the}} only American and was viewed as effeminate. Manning had come out to two friends in Oklahoma as gay, but was not open about it at school in Wales. The students would imitate her accent, and apparently abandoned her once during a camping trip; her aunt told The Washington Post that Manning awoke to an empty camp site one morning, after everyone else had packed up their <b>tents</b> <b>and</b> left without her.|$|E
5|$|The British then {{established}} garrisons {{along their}} supply lines, which {{stretched across the}} Sinai from the Suez Canal. Patrols and reconnaissances were regularly carried out to protect the advance of the railway and water pipeline, built by the Egyptian Labour Corps. These supply lines were marked by railway stations and sidings, airfields, signal installations and standing camps where troops could be accommodated in <b>tents</b> <b>and</b> huts. At this time the Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF) had a ration strength of 156,000 soldiers, plus 13,000 Egyptian labourers.|$|E

In 1999, {{it was estimated that}} more than half of the city's inhabitants lived in <b>tents</b> <b>and</b> shacks, which were used for residential as well as business purposes. The city is broken into nine arrondissements, sub-divided into alphabetised Îlots. These are Teyarett, Ksar, Tevragh Zeïna, Toujournine, Sebkha, El Mina, Dar Naïm, Arafat and Riad. The Sebkha (Cinquième) Arrondissement is home to a large shopping area.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the {{expedition}} Nansen continued {{to experiment with}} equipment and techniques, altering the designs of skis and sledges and investigating types of clothing, <b>tents</b> <b>and</b> cooking apparatus, thereby revolutionising methods of Arctic travel. In the era of polar exploration which followed his return, explorers routinely sought Nansen's advice as to methods and equipment—although sometimes they chose not to follow it, usually to their cost. According to Huntford, the South Pole heroes Amundsen, Scott, and Ernest Shackleton were all Nansen's acolytes.|$|E

5|$|Amanda caused heavy {{damage in}} the {{northeast}} Gulf of Mexico and the Florida Panhandle. In addition to sinking the USS Amanda, several other ships encountered the storm or were also capsized. At least 38deaths occurred at sea. In St. Marks, Florida, strong winds destroyed homes and fences, {{as well as the}} salt works, ruining about 40,000bushels of salt. Storm surge inundated crops and the railroad tracks. A total of 40people and 48mules and oxen drowned. An additional 32people drowned at Dickerson Bay and Goose Creek. Some coastal forts were damaged, while <b>tents</b> <b>and</b> equipment used by Confederate troops were lost. In Tallahassee, heavy rainfall and severe gales were reported, damaging homes and other properties. The hurricane caused upward of 110fatalities.|$|E
5|$|Frederick {{realized}} the gambit by 2:30 pm. By 3:00pm, the entire Prussian army had struck camp, loaded their <b>tents</b> <b>and</b> gear, and fallen into line. Friedrich Wilhelm von Seydlitz took his 38 squadrons of cavalry {{and moved toward}} the Janus and Pölzen, small hills between Rossbach and Reichertswerben. Except for a few moments, the advance was hidden entirely from view. He was followed by Colonel Karl Friedrich von Moller's battery of 18 guns, which positioned themselves temporarily on the reverse of the Janus between the infantry's left and the cavalry's right. Seven squadrons remained in Rossbach to contain Saint-Germain's advanced post.|$|E
5|$|In December 1903, in {{an effort}} to avert another bout of Beebe's throat ailment, Hornaday sent him on an {{expedition}} to Mexico which would last until the following April. Since Mexico was still largely unstable at this point, he and Blair traveled on horseback and lived mostly in <b>tents,</b> <b>and</b> both carried revolvers for self-protection. Although the purpose of the expedition was to discover, identify and collect Mexico's birds, it has also been described as yet another honeymoon between him and Blair. Beebe's first book, titled Two Bird Lovers in Mexico, was an account of this expedition. The last chapter was written by Blair, and was an explanation of how to plan and execute a vacation in the wilderness. The book was enthusiastically well received.|$|E

5|$|Independence grew {{quickly when}} more gold {{was found in}} the nearby mountains. Within two years of its {{settlement}} permanent buildings had replaced the original <b>tents,</b> <b>and</b> a mining concern from Leadville had bought up all the claims. In two years they produced gold worth $190,000 ($ in modern dollars), funding the construction of a stamping mill and sawmill. In Aspen, further down the valley, silver was found in even greater abundance than Independence's gold. B. Clark Wheeler, an early investor in those mines, funded the construction of a stage road to Leadville, the first road to cross the pass. It opened in November 1881, with winter already in full swing at the pass.|$|E
5|$|On April29, 1963, {{less than}} half a year after Karen, Typhoon Olive caused {{extensive}} damage in Guam and the Mariana Islands. With many residents living in <b>tents,</b> <b>and</b> debris from the storm still scattered about, severe damage was anticipated. Schools, churches, and other structures were opened as shelters in order to protect those without homes. Ultimately, Guam was spared the worst of the storm though much of Saipan was devastated. The island was again devastated in 1976 by Typhoon Pamela which buffeted the island with destructive winds for 36hours. Though weaker than Karen, the longer lasting impact of Pamela was regarded as more destructive.|$|E
