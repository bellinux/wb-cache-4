5|$|After the {{telephone}} calls, Bamber {{made his way}} by car to the farmhouse, as did PS Bews, PC Myall and PC Saxby from Witham Police Station, passing Bamber on Pages Lane. They <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> that he was driving much slower than them. Bamber's cousin, Ann Eaton, testified that Bamber was normally a fast driver.|$|E
5|$|Bamber {{visited the}} farm {{on the evening}} of Tuesday, 6 August. He <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> that his parents {{suggested}} to Sheila that evening that the boys be placed in day-time foster care with a local family. Bamber said Sheila did not seem bothered by the suggestion and had simply said she would rather stay in London. The boys had been in foster care before, although in London rather than near White House Farm, and it had not appeared to cause a problem for Sheila. Her psychiatrist, Dr. Ferguson, <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> of Appeal in 2002 that any suggestion that the children be removed from her care would have provoked a strong reaction from Sheila, but that she might have welcomed daytime help.|$|E
5|$|A {{particularly}} damning {{piece of}} evidence came from a bonnetmaker named Maria Durden who <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> that Webster had visited her {{a week before the}} murder and had said {{that she was going to}} Birmingham to sell some property, jewellery and a house that her aunt had left her. The jury interpreted this as a sign that Webster had premeditated the murder and convicted her after deliberating for about an hour and a quarter.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> Supreme <b>Court</b> of Honduras has {{rejected}} a demand by the Organization of American States to reinstate the ousted President, Manuel Zelaya. OAS chief Jose Miguel Insulza was <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>court's</b> position was [...] "irreversible" [...] {{when he met}} its president for two hours in the capital Tegulcigalpa. Danilo Izaguirre, spokesman for <b>the</b> Supreme <b>Court,</b> confirmed that it had rejected the OAS secretary general's demand. [...] "Insulza asked Honduras to reinstate Zelaya but the president of <b>the</b> <b>court</b> Jorge Rivera categorically answered {{that there is an}} arrest warrant for him", he said.|$|R
5|$|Despite Sheila's erratic mental state, her {{psychiatrist}} <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> {{that the}} kind of violence necessary to commit the murders was not consistent with his view of her. In particular, {{he said he did not}} believe she would have killed her father or children, because her difficult relationship was confined to her mother. Her ex-husband said the same: that, despite her tendency to throw things and sometimes hit him, she had never harmed the children. June Bamber's sister, Pamela Boutflour, testified that Sheila was not a violent person and that she had never known her to use a gun; June's niece, Ann Eaton, <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> that Sheila did not know how to use one. Bamber disputed this, telling police on the night of the shooting, as they stood outside the house, that he and Sheila had gone target shooting together. He acknowledged later that he had not seen her fire a gun as an adult.|$|E
5|$|At his trial, Bonnet downplayed his own {{authority}} over his pirate crew. He <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> that his crew engaged in piracy against his will, {{and said he}} had warned them that he would leave the crew unless they stopped robbing vessels. He further stated that he had been asleep during the capture of the sloop Francis. The court did not accept these protestations. Boatswain Ignatius Pell testified that Bonnet's quartermaster, Robert Tucker, had more power than Bonnet. A powerful quartermaster {{appears to have been a}} common feature of pirate crews in the early modern era.|$|E
5|$|Bamber <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> that, {{during his}} visit on 6 August, hours before the murders, he had loaded the rifle, {{thinking}} he had heard rabbits outside, but hadn't used it. He had then left it on the kitchen table, with a full magazine {{and a box of}} ammunition, before leaving the house. When he left it in the kitchen, it did not have the silencer or telescopic sight attached, he said; they had been on the rifle in late July according to a nephew, but Bamber said his father must have removed them in the meantime. The prosecution disputed this, maintaining that the silencer was on the rifle when the family was murdered.|$|E
50|$|Rather, {{based upon}} the {{evidence}} presented when the lawsuit was brought more than 50 years later, the founders, since deceased, apparently first became aware of each other's businesses in 1970. Representatives of <b>the</b> Texas chain <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> during <b>the</b> federal lawsuit {{that the company had}} no plans for expansion into Virginia. (Neither the North Carolina-based What-A-Burger chain, nor any of the many others with similar names, was party to this particular lawsuit).|$|R
5000|$|D'Amico {{received}} the nickname [...] "Nose" [...] {{because of his}} [...] "Romanesque nose", one mob informant <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> during his testimony. At the Gotti trial, mobster Michael DiLeonardo said, [...] "D'Amico had his nose fixed, a (rhinoplasty). He had a big, distorted nose at one time", D'Amico {{was said to have}} been upset with prosecutors for using the nickname. John Gotti loved him because... Jackie was a fellow gambler who placed all his bets for him ...|$|R
50|$|Mr Rai, who was deposing in {{the case}} a few days ago, had also <b>told</b> <b>the</b> CBI <b>court</b> that he feared for his life after which he was {{provided}} protection inside the jail and additional security for his travels to <b>the</b> <b>court.</b>|$|R
5|$|During {{the hearing}} into the gunfight at the O.K. Corral, Wyatt {{testified that he}} offered the US$3,600 in Wells Fargo reward money ($1,200 per robber) to Ike Clanton and Frank McLaury in return for {{information}} about the identities of the three robbers. Wyatt testified that he had other motives for his plan, as well; he hoped that arresting the murderers would boost his chances for election as Cochise County sheriff. Wyatt <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> that he had taken the extra step of obtaining a second copy of a telegram for Ike from Wells Fargo assuring that the reward for capturing the killers applied either dead or alive.|$|E
5|$|In {{front of}} around 60 students, Bayliss stimulated the nerves with {{electricity}} {{for half an}} hour, {{but was unable to}} demonstrate his point. The dog was then handed to a student, Henry Dale, a future Nobel laureate, who removed the dog's pancreas, then killed him with a knife through the heart. This became a point of embarrassment during the libel trial, when Bayliss's laboratory assistant, Charles Scuttle, testified that the dog had been killed with chloroform or the ACE mixture. After Scuttle's testimony Dale <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> that he had, in fact, used a knife.|$|E
5|$|Levin {{was interviewed}} by police in November 1985, when he said Winston Silcott had led the attack with a machete; he <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> in 2014 that {{that had been a}} mistake. The court heard that, during Nove's 1992–1994 investigation, police offered Levin {{immunity}} from prosecution, gave him £5,000 and paid for a flight from Spain when he missed his flight home from a holiday. They approached him again in January 2008 for his testimony and helped him with expenses and a deposit for accommodation.|$|E
50|$|In January 2012, <b>The</b> Union Government <b>told</b> <b>the</b> Supreme <b>Court</b> that <b>the</b> Radia tapes {{broadcast}} by media organisations were tampered with {{and the government}} agencies were not responsible for its leakage.|$|R
25|$|Thaksin {{was charged}} with {{illegally}} concealing billions of baht of his wealth by transferring ownership of Shin Corp. shares to his drivers and maids, without their knowledge.

5|$|Manning <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> that, {{during her}} {{interaction}} with WikiLeaks on IRC and Jabber, she developed {{a friendship with}} someone there, believed to be Julian Assange (although neither knew the other's name), which she said made her feel she could be herself. Army investigators found 14 to 15 pages of encrypted chats, in unallocated space on her MacBook's hard drive, between Manning and someone believed to be Assange. She wrote {{in a statement that}} the more she had tried to fit in at work, the more alienated she became from everyone around her. The relationship with WikiLeaks had given her a brief respite from the isolation and anxiety.|$|E
5|$|The rifle had {{normally}} {{been used}} to shoot rabbits with the silencer and telescopic sight attached. The court heard that the telescopic sight {{had to be removed}} with a screwdriver, but it was usually left in place because it was time-consuming to realign it. Nevill's nephew visited the farmhouse on the weekend of 26–28 July 1985, and <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> that he had seen the rifle, in the gun cupboard in the ground-floor office, with the sight and silencer attached. He had taken the gun out and used it for target practice.|$|E
5|$|Ann Marten {{was called}} to give {{evidence}} {{of the events of}} the day of Maria's disappearance and her later dreams. Thomas Marten then <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> how he had dug up his daughter, and Maria's 10-year-old brother George Marten revealed that he had seen Corder with a loaded pistol before the alleged murder and later had seen him walking from the barn with a pickaxe. Lea gave evidence concerning Corder's arrest and the objects found during the search of his house. The prosecution suggested that Corder had never wanted to marry Maria, but that her knowledge of some of his criminal dealings had given her a hold over him, and that his theft of the money sent by her child's father had been a source of tension between them.|$|E
5000|$|However, on 23 February 2012, the Union Home Ministry of the UPA {{government}} replying to a Supreme <b>Court</b> observation, <b>told</b> <b>the</b> Supreme <b>Court</b> that it {{was opposed}} to the decriminalisation of gay sex. [...] "This is highly immoral and against the social order," [...] <b>the</b> Home Ministry <b>told</b> <b>the</b> apex <b>court.</b> It said that India's moral and social values were different from other countries, and therefore, the nation should not be guided by them. The Central Government reversed its stand on 28 February 2012, asserting {{that there was no}} error in decriminalising gay sex. This resulted in the SC pulling up the Centre for frequently changing its stand on the issue. Don't make a mockery of the system and don't waste <b>the</b> <b>court's</b> time, an apex <b>court</b> judge <b>told</b> <b>the</b> government.|$|R

5000|$|In June 2009, police <b>told</b> <b>the</b> High <b>Court</b> {{that they}} {{suspected}} {{that members of}} the UDA were involved in the killing, with the judge concluding that there were [...] "sectarian overtones" [...] to the attack.|$|R
5|$|In {{the early}} evening Hare took the stand to give evidence. Under {{cross-examination}} about the murder of Docherty, Hare claimed Burke had been the sole murderer and McDougal had twice been involved by bringing Docherty {{back to the house}} after she had run out; Hare stated that he had assisted Burke in the delivery of the body to Knox. Although he was asked about other murders, he was not obliged to answer the questions, as the charge related only to the death of Docherty. After Hare's questioning, his wife entered the witness box, carrying their baby daughter who was suffering from whooping cough. Margaret used the child's coughing fits as a way to give herself thinking time for some of the questions, and <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> that she had a very poor memory and could not remember many of the events.|$|E
5|$|On 16 August 2007, {{acting on}} a suo motu notice, the Supreme Court of Pakistan took up the extrajudicial killings {{of the people at}} the Lal Masjid and Jamia Hafsa complex. Performance of the Islamabad {{administration}} attracted the reprimand of the court for its slow pace. The court was informed that 61 students were in custody, of whom 39 were on bailable offences. The Chief Justice of Pakistan ordered immediate release of 20 people considered innocent, as recommended by a joint investigation team. National Crisis Management Cell Director Javed Iqbal Cheema <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> that 28 DNA tests had not been confirmed. The Chief Justice also pointed out that Islamabad Deputy Commissioner Mohammad Ali had stated that 30 bodies remained unidentified.|$|E
5|$|The inquest {{was opened}} and adjourned in April 2009. The City of London coroner, Paul Matthews, {{expressed}} concern about whether he had appropriate expertise, and Peter Thornton QC, who specializes in protest law, took over. The inquest opened on 28 March 2011 before a jury. The court heard from Kevin Channer, a cardiologist at Royal Hallamshire Hospital, who analysed electrocardiogram (ECG) data from the defibrillator paramedics had used on Tomlinson. He said the readings were inconsistent with an arrhythmic heart attack, but consistent with death from internal bleeding. Pathologist Nat Carey concurred regarding the cause of death. Graeme Alexander, a hepatologist, said that in his opinion Tomlinson had died of internal bleeding {{as a result of}} trauma to the liver after the fall. He <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> that Tomlinson had been suffering from serious liver disease, which would have made him susceptible to collapse from internal bleeding.|$|E
25|$|In November 1994 <b>the</b> Supreme <b>Court</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> appeals <b>court</b> {{to reconsider}} after a related Supreme <b>Court</b> decision. <b>The</b> appeals <b>court</b> {{reversed}} its decision in April 1995, and in June {{the same year}} Prof. Moyibi Amodo was elected to succeed Jeffries as department chairman. Jeffries remains a professor at CCNY.|$|R
50|$|Shyamvar Rai, one of {{the accused}} who turned an {{approver}} in the Sheena Bora murder case, <b>told</b> <b>the</b> CBI <b>court</b> {{that he was not}} aware that after becoming the key witness in the case he would be entitled to an acquittal.|$|R

5|$|The jury heard how {{the murder}} weapons {{had been found}} in a shed at Nazir's house along with two bags of bloodied clothes. DNA and {{fingerprints}} belonging to Nazir was found on the hunting knife and Parker's blood was found on both the hammer and knife. His blood was also found on the clothes of two of the accused, along with Nazir and Mahrad's DNA and a pathologist told how marks on Parker's body matched the hammer found in Nazir's shed. Three balaclavas were also recovered from the property, again containing traces of Parker's blood, Nazir's younger brother Wyed <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> he had seen his brother cleaning the murder weapon {{on the night of the}} killing and witnessed all four defendants with blood on their clothing. Further witnesses reported Nazir admitting to beating someone up, Mahrad admitting to kicking Parker and Awan recalling stabbing him. A witness also saw all four defendants kicking Parker.|$|E
5|$|Though usually {{opposing}} {{each other}} in their reporting of events, reporting by both the Epitaph and the Nugget initially supported the lawmen's version of events. Woods, the publisher of the pro-Cowboy Nugget, was out of town during the hearings, and an experienced reporter, Richard Rule, wrote the story. The Nugget staff had a close relationship with Sheriff Behan, but Rule's story, as printed in the Nugget the day after the shootout, backed up the Earps' version of events. This varied widely from Behan's and the Cowboys' later court testimony. Subsequent stories about the gunfight published in the Nugget after that day supported Behan's and the Cowboys' view of events. Other stories in the Epitaph countered the Nuggets later view entirely and supported the lawmen. In addition, Dr. George Goodfellow, who examined the Cowboys after their death, <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> that the angle of the wound in Billy Clanton's wrist indicated that his hands could not have been in the air, or holding his coats open by the lapels, as witnesses loyal to the Cowboys testified.|$|E
25|$|During the Hogan lawsuit trial AJ Daulerio, {{a former}} Gawker editor, <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> {{that he would}} {{consider}} a celebrity sex tape non-newsworthy if the subject was {{under the age of}} four. Daulerio later <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> he was being flippant in his statements.|$|E
