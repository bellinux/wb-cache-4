40|$|This paper {{discusses}} Sidel’s {{criticism of}} certain Kerschensteiner’s views about work-school and work-education. Sidel disputed that Kerschensteiner was {{the creator of}} the idea about work-school, emphasizing that, significantly before Kerschensteiner, he put forth this idea in his papers, in which he proved the pedagogical value of work and the need for work-school. Sidel objects to Kerschensteiner <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> convincingly elaborate the need for introducing work-school, that, when explaining the need for handcraft, he underestimated the significance of books for education and culture in general, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> specify the term "giftedness", <b>that</b> is, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> indicate <b>that</b> besides spiritual, there are other kinds of giftedness and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> understand correctly the relation between work and obviousness. Sidel also thinks that Kerschensteiner <b>did</b> <b>not</b> understand the relation between the society, state and education, i. e. <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> demonstrate <b>that</b> school reform is conditioned by social reasons, that work-school is a social an political need, that work education is the need and interest of modern society and state. Also, he objects to Kerschensteiner <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> understand nor emphasize the significance and value of handcraft for artistic education, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> speak about the role of work in the development of inventive spirit of the young, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> sufficiently emphasize <b>that</b> significance of handcraft for the development of will, moral and character, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> speak in which way work-school can be realized, i. e. <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> see the mutual relationship between social development and school and <b>did</b> <b>not</b> demand any social changes for the purpose of accomplishing that goal. Sidel concludes that Kerschensteiner’s work-school, introduced in the conditions of monarchist organization of schools in Germany, cannot be a role model which should be followed...|$|R
