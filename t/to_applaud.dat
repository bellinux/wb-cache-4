Similar reviews were voiced out by other such portals, many of which pointing out no real flaws from the film.|$|E
5|$|Having found {{success in}} both {{domestic}} and European cup competitions, Revie took the decision to focus exclusively on the league for the 1968–69 campaign. They went {{the rest of the}} season unbeaten in the league following a 5–1 defeat to Burnley at Turf Moor on 19 October, and secured the title with a 0–0 draw with challengers Liverpool at Anfield; after the game Revie led his team back out onto the pitch <b>to</b> <b>applaud</b> the Liverpool supporters, who in turn applauded the Leeds team. His team set a number of records: most points (67), most wins (27), fewest defeats (2), and most home points (39); a still-unbroken club record is their 34 match unbeaten run that extended into the following season.|$|E

5|$|The 1896 Olympic Games {{were the}} first held in the Modern era and the most {{important}} international multi-sport event Greece had ever hosted. The rules of the Games generally excluded women from competition. Influenced by both his times—in the Victorian era women were considered to be inferior to men—and his admiration for the ancient Olympic Games, when only men were allowed to participate in the events, Baron Pierre de Coubertin, the visionary of the modern Olympic Games, was not in favour of women's participation in the Olympic Games or in sports generally. He believed that a woman's greatest achievement would be to encourage her sons to be distinguished in sports and <b>to</b> <b>applaud</b> a man's effort.|$|E
5|$|After {{winning the}} toss, the Australians made all their {{runs on the}} first day, with centuries for Hassett (103), Harvey (126) and Johnson (113*) and 99 for Hamence. The Australians put on 255 for the second wicket, through Hassett and Barnes, who was {{replaced}} by Harvey after retiring ill. The other Australian batsmen had all made centuries, and were keen to see Hamence do the same. The {{rest of the team}} left their card games in readiness <b>to</b> <b>applaud</b> his impending milestone, only to see him stumped for 99, his highest score for the season. On the Monday, the second day, on a pitch that was taking spin, Somerset collapsed twice inside four hours and less than 82 overs in total. McCool took 4/21 and 4/23, and Johnston also took eight, including 5/34 in the second innings. He took the last two wickets of the Somerset first innings as a spinner, and then had Harold Gimblett lbw with the second ball of the second innings as a fast-medium bowler to take three wickets in four balls.|$|E
5|$|Returning {{once again}} to {{domestic}} cricket, Hamence scored 85 and 66 against Queensland, and this kept him in the running for {{a place in the}} national team, as he toured with The Invincibles in England in 1948. He was not selected to play in any of the Tests, however he reiterated when interviewed in 2008 that he felt no resentment over not having played. Hamence was a popular member of the touring squad and his cheerful nature and splendid tenor voice added to the good spirits of the team. His success in the warm up games was mixed, scores of 92, 46 and 49 not out against Cambridge University, Essex and Lancashire mixed with a duck, seven, one, three, two and five against other counties. Against Somerset, approaching his first century of the tour, the Australian players, keen to see Hamence succeed, left their card games <b>to</b> <b>applaud</b> only to see him dismissed for 99, his highest score for the season. He also faced Scotland for two matches in August 1948, scoring six and 15. Overall on the tour he played 19matches scoring 582runs at an average of 32.33.|$|E

5|$|The violin concerto {{stands out}} from {{previous}} concertos with its connected movements. There is no break {{between the first}} and second movements, with a bassoon note held between the two. The bridging passage between the last two movements begins almost immediately after the slow movement. The melody is similar to that of the opening, which hints at the cyclic form of the piece. The linking was designed to eliminate applause between movements. This would have come as a surprise to Mendelssohn's audience, who, unlike today's, were used <b>to</b> <b>applauding</b> between movements.|$|R

5|$|Throughout {{the early}} part of the century, Wood was {{influential}} in changing the habits of concertgoers. Until then it had been customary for audiences at symphony or choral concerts <b>to</b> <b>applaud</b> after each movement or section. Wood discouraged this, sometime by gesture and sometimes by specific request printed in programmes. For this he was much praised in the musical and national press. In addition to his work at the Queen's Hall, Wood conducted at the Sheffield, Norwich, Birmingham, Wolverhampton, and Westmorland festivals, and at orchestral concerts in Cardiff, Manchester, Liverpool, Leicester and Hull. His programming was summarised in The Manchester Guardian, which listed the number of each composer's works played in the 1911 Proms season; the top ten were: Wagner (121); Beethoven (34); Tchaikovsky (30); Mozart (28); Dvořák (16); Weber (16); J.S. Bach (14); Brahms (14); Elgar (14); and Liszt (13).|$|E
5|$|Two {{music videos}} {{were made for}} the song; the first one for the ballad version, {{and the other for}} the English version. The ballad version was {{directed}} by Felipe Niño. In the video, the group is shown performing the song along with an orchestra behind them. It is filmed on a stage where shows López singing his verses, while the others members of the group, follow up with the chorus. At the end of the video the people of the orchestra starts <b>to</b> <b>applaud</b> when the group ends to sing. In the English version of the video, the plot is completely different. The video starts in a cloudy afternoon after a storm, where the group is situated in a white room. It shows López singing in a ladder when it later starts to fill with water. At {{the last part of the}} video, it shows Son by Four singing out of the house after the storm has ended.|$|E

60|$|It {{seemed as}} if the great Pacific itself were {{pulsating}} with unwonted joy. The billows were bigger grander, almost slower and more sedate than usual. Outside it was dead calm. The fall of each liquid wall was more thunderous, its roar more deep-toned, and the confusion of the surf more riotous than ever. For average rejoicers this exercise might in itself have sufficed for one day, but they were used to it, and wanted variety; so the youths took to racing on the sands, and the maidens <b>to</b> <b>applauding,</b> while the elderly looked on and criticised.

25|$|There are {{two main}} {{varieties}} of fado, namely those of the cities of Lisbon and Coimbra. The Lisbon style is the most popular, while Coimbra's is the more refined style.

25|$|To ready {{his music}} for live performance, he joined smaller pieces of music {{together}} into longer suites. Rather than single pieces, {{which would require}} the audience <b>to</b> <b>applaud</b> every few minutes, Morricone thought the best idea {{was to create a}} series of suites lasting from 15 to 20 minutes, which form a sort of symphony in various movements – alternating successful pieces with personal favorites. In concert, Morricone normally has 180 to 200 musicians and vocalists under his baton, performing multiple genre-crossing collections of music. Rock, symphonic and ethnic instruments share the stage.|$|E

The two note in a talking head that their applause is beginning to have a reverse effect, causing them to genuinely believe simple actions like making copies or drinking water are impressive.|$|R
25|$|It is a {{tradition}} for Blackhawks fans <b>to</b> <b>applaud</b> and cheer loudly during the singing of the national anthem. This tradition originated during a 1985 Campbell Conference playoff game at Chicago Stadium versus the Edmonton Oilers. Wayne Messmer, the Blackhawks home games national anthem singer from 1980 to 1994, was the anthem singer when this tradition began. Jim Cornelison sings the national anthems for all home games and he is accompanied by organist Frank Pellico. Before Game 2 of the 2010 Stanley Cup Finals at the United Center, the cheering during the anthem was registered between 116-122 decibels.|$|E

25|$|At {{the funeral}} for the Italian {{swimming}} team victims, something very unusual happened.

It was also a tangible tribute to the young athletes. This, incidentally, was the very first time that clapping was recorded at a public, media-covered funeral in Italy. On numerous subsequent occasions, crowds would salute the victims of the Red Brigades and other domestic terrorist acts in a similar way. Clapping at funerals slowly became a typical salute for victims of media-covered funerals.|$|E
