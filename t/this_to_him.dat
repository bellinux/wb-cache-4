5|$|Shortly after de Gaulle and Foccart's meeting, French commanders Haulin and Royer were {{released}} {{at the request}} of the French Embassy. Intervention could not commence without a formal petition to the Head of State of Gabon. Since M'ba was held hostage, the French contacted the Vice President of Gabon, Paul-Marie Yembit, who had not been arrested. At the time, Yembit was in a car with U.S. ambassador Charles Darlington travelling to N'Dende. This was to officially open a school built by the Peace Corps nearby, in Yembit's birthplace of Moussambou, and completing his electoral campaign. Therefore, they decided to compose a predated letter that Yembit would later sign, confirming their intervention. They sent <b>this</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> via a small airplane, since there were no road bridges in Gabon at the time and the only way to cross a river was on a ferry. Yembit did not come back to Libreville on the plane as would be expected, but rather at 8:00 WAT on 18 February to read a statement over Radio Libreville that was likely prepared by French officials. Yembit, however, claimed that he called for French intervention while the insurgent troops held M'ba hostage; this version of the story was quickly disputed by several diplomats on the scene, as several French troops had arrived before this alleged incident.|$|E

25|$|Hanging {{from the}} cross, Jesus prays to God asking {{forgiveness}} {{for the people}} who did <b>this</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> and redeems a criminal as a saint who is crucified beside him. Succumbing to impending death, Jesus gives up his spirit and dies. A single droplet of rain falls from the sky to the ground, triggering a sudden earthquake which destroys the temple and rips the cloth covering the Holy of Holies in two, to the horror of Caiaphas and the other priests. Satan is shown screaming in agonized defeat. Jesus' lifeless body is taken down from the cross, and entombed. In the end, the healed body of Jesus rises from the dead and exits the tomb resurrected.|$|E
25|$|The {{relationship}} between Barth, liberalism, and fundamentalism {{goes far beyond}} the issue of inerrancy, however. From Barth's perspective, liberalism, as understood {{in the sense of}} the 19th century with Friedrich Schleiermacher and Hegel as its leading exponents and not necessarily expressed in any particular political ideology, is the divinization of human thinking. <b>This,</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> inevitably leads one or more philosophical concepts to become the false God, thus attempting to block the true voice of the living God. This, in turn, leads to the captivity of theology by human ideology. In Barth's theology, he emphasizes again and again that human concepts of any kind, breadth or narrowness quite beside the point, can never be considered as identical to God's revelation. In this aspect, Scripture is also written human language, which bears witness to the self-revelation of God in Jesus Christ. Scripture cannot be considered as identical to God's self-revelation, which is properly only Jesus Christ. However, in his freedom and love, God truly reveals himself through human language and concepts, with a view toward their necessity in reaching fallen humanity. Thus Barth claims that Christ is truly presented in Scripture and the preaching of the church, echoing a stand expressed in his native Swiss Reformed Church's Helvetic Confession of the 16th century.|$|E
25|$|Richie {{is able to}} {{secretly}} abstract JR's bone marrow, while setting JR up to look {{as though}} he was out all night with a hooker the day he went missing. A drugged-up JR, unaware that his bone marrow has been stolen, insists to his family and Babe that he was drugged and he knows Richie did <b>this</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> Initially Krystal is the only one to believe JR, but Babe later finds out that JR is telling the truth about Richie and apologizes to him. She sees Richie pay the hooker that was with JR the night Richie stole his bone marrow. Babe punches out the hooker. She goes on a mission to find out what other stuff Richie has done to JR or anyone else. During this mission, JR saves Babe from being raped by some guys when she goes undercover as a prostitute to clear JR's name and find out what crimes Richie did. Trina decides to tell the truth about Richie and her part in framing JR when Richie stole his bone marrow. JR promises Trina some money to get out of prostituting and go somewhere Richie is not due to fear that Richie will kill her since she told JR what Richie did. With Richie finally gone, JR and Babe come happily together again.|$|E

500|$|Thomas Anyan became President of Corpus Christi in 1614, and he {{appointed}} Twyne as Greek lecturer. By 1623, Twyne had resigned his fellowship, apparently (according to the 17th-century Oxford historian Antony Wood) {{to avoid having}} to choose which side to support in a dispute between the college president and the fellows. He did not secure any further academic advancement: he hoped to be appointed Camden Professor of Ancient History on the death or resignation of Degory Wheare (the first professor). According to Twyne, Camden promised <b>this</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> in a conversation in 1623, and a patent sealed by Camden in March of that year to this effect was read out to the university's governing body in January 1624. Camden, however, wrote to Wheare shortly after the patent was signed and said that he had been tricked by some [...] "foul play" [...] and did not intend to appoint Twyne. In the end, Twyne died three years before Wheare. In 1624, a House of Commons committee criticised Anyan for, amongst other things, excessive lenience to Twyne for his drunkenness.|$|E
500|$|Takumi only spent {{little time}} on writing a backstory for Phoenix before writing the game's story, and instead made up {{dialogue}} and developed Phoenix's personality {{as he went}} along. Takumi said that Phoenix is Shu Takumi in everything but name, with dialogue similar to what Takumi would have said in each situation in the games; he attributed <b>this</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> being a first-time writer who did not think about developing characterization prior to writing the story. Takumi didn't write a backstory for Dick Gumshoe; instead, Gumshoe's character and personality just [...] "fell into place" [...] after Takumi decided that the character would end his sentences with [...] "pal". Other aspects of the character came about organically as Takumi wrote the story; for instance, at one point Edgeworth says that he will cut Gumshoe's salary, which became part of Gumshoe's backstory. Takumi {{came up with the}} partner character Maya because {{he thought it would be}} more fun for players to have another character with them, giving them advice, than investigating on their own. Originally, she was going to be a lawyer-in-training, preparing to take the bar exam.|$|E

Nessarose has taken away the rights of the Munchkins {{in a desperate attempt to}} keep Boq at her side. Elphaba tries to convince her sister to side with her against the Wizard, but Nessarose is more concerned with her own problems. Elphaba tries to help by giving Nessarose the power to walk by turning the silver slippers into the [...] "Ruby Slippers". Convinced that Boq must love her now, Nessarose calls for him, but he only sees this as proof that she doesn't need him any more. Furious, Nessarose takes Elphaba's spell book and tries to cast a spell to make Boq fall in love with her. However, the spell backfires, making her the [...] "Wicked Witch of the East", shrinking Boq's heart. Elphaba must work another spell to save his life, if in a slightly different condition than he was before. When Boq awakens, he is horrified at his new state as a man made of tin, and Nessarose tells him it was Elphaba who did <b>this</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E

500|$|The conference {{started on}} the morning of 26 August as planned. The six Rhodesian delegates took their places first, then around 40 nationalists entered and crowded around Muzorewa on the {{opposite}} side of the cramped railway carriage. Vorster and Kaunda arrived and sat on the Rhodesian side, where there was more space, and each spoke in turn, giving their blessing to the negotiations. Muzorewa then opened the proceedings at Smith's invitation. Speaking assertively, the bishop gave three concessions which would have to be given by the Rhodesian side for talks to begin: first, one man, one vote was established by Muzorewa to be [...] "a basic necessity"; second, an amnesty would have to be given for all guerrilla fighters, including those convicted of murder by the High Court in Salisbury; and finally, all of the nationalists would have to be given permission to return to Rhodesia as soon as possible to begin political campaigning. Smith replied calmly that Kaunda, Nyerere and Vorster had all assured him that the UANC had agreed not to demand preconditions for talks, and that Kaunda and Vorster had in fact confirmed <b>this</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> that same morning; his delegation was therefore surprised by Muzorewa's confrontational opening speech.|$|E

Despite Dr. Deagan's tampering with the word list to give Guy the most difficult words, he spells long, complicated words with relative ease, impressing and angering both parents and staff at the spelling bee, including the event's founder, Dr. William Bowman. However, the parents petition for his disqualification and the resignation of Deagan. While researching Guy's background, Jenny discovers that Bowman is Guy's father.
