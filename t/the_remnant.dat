5|$|By July 10, Darby {{had lost}} all of its {{tropical}} characteristics. As <b>the</b> <b>remnant</b> low pressure meandered across the southwest United States it moved north, and tracked offshore of California, where it persisted as a remnant low and produced shower activity to parts of California.|$|E

500|$|Since 1850, {{only seven}} [...] {{tropical}} cyclones have brought gale-force winds to the Southwestern United States. They are: The 1858 San Diego hurricane that was reconstructed as just missing landfall in 1858, the 1939 Long Beach tropical storm that made landfall near San Pedro in 1939, <b>the</b> <b>remnants</b> of Tropical Storm Jennifer-Katherine in 1963, <b>the</b> <b>remnants</b> of Hurricane Emily in 1965, <b>the</b> <b>remnants</b> of Hurricane Joanne in 1972, <b>the</b> <b>remnants</b> of Hurricane Kathleen in 1976, and Hurricane Nora after being downgraded to {{a tropical storm}} in 1997.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>remnants</b> of Axel {{interacted with}} a {{low-pressure}} area {{which is also}} <b>the</b> <b>remnants</b> of Bobbie as it created a large extratropical system, affecting Canada and finally dissipating on January 2, 1995.|$|R
5|$|Early on August 11, Hernan was {{downgraded}} to {{a tropical}} storm. Deep convection diminished around {{the center of}} the storm and by August 12, almost all of the deep convection dissipated as Hernan continued to weaken. Over 23°C water, only a swirl of clouds remained and the storm was barely a tropical system. Later that night, Hernan had degenerated into a remnant low, and the final advisory was issued by the National Hurricane Center. <b>The</b> <b>remnant</b> low still retained tropical storm-force winds for a short while before weakening further by the next morning. The low moved towards the west-southwest over the next several days before dissipating 460mi (740km) southeast of the Island of Hawaii on August 16. <b>The</b> <b>remnant</b> low-pressure area of Hernan later brought moisture to the island of Hawaii, causing cloud and shower activity. The associated rainfall was light and insignificant.|$|E
5|$|Galileo, like Tycho before him, {{tried in}} vain to measure the {{parallax}} of this new star, and then argued against the Aristotelian view of an immutable heavens. <b>The</b> <b>remnant</b> of this supernova was identified in 1941 at the Mount Wilson Observatory.|$|E
5|$|Great Culverden Park is a small, 9½ acre {{woodland}} in the Mount Ephraim area {{behind the}} site of the old Kent and Sussex Hospital and is <b>the</b> <b>remnant</b> grounds of the previous Great Culverden House designed by Decimus Burton that used to stand on Mount Ephraim.|$|E
50|$|On 30 June 2009, it was {{reported}} <b>the</b> <b>remnants</b> of IND/DEM were to unite with <b>the</b> <b>remnants</b> of another collapsing group, Union for a Europe of Nations (UEN), {{to create a new}} group whose official name was not yet determined.|$|R
50|$|Besides the manuscripts, the {{excavations}} of {{the castle}} Rustavi prove that Rustavi was a big political and administrative center. During the archaeological excavations <b>the</b> <b>remnants</b> of ancients buildings were found, there are <b>the</b> <b>remnants</b> of <b>the</b> buildings of the 4th and 5th centuries.|$|R
50|$|The frontal trough outran the system, and the {{building}} ridge to Allison's north forced the extratropical depression turned {{to the south and}} southwest. After executing a cyclonic loop over Texas, the ridge to the north began to erode, allowing Allison to track northeast and out of the state. Its circulation dissipated on July 1, but <b>the</b> <b>remnants</b> retained some organization, and continued to the northeast. On July 3 and July 4, the shortwave that influenced <b>the</b> <b>remnants</b> of Allison accelerated ahead of the storm, causing Allison to become stationary over the borders of Kentucky, Illinois, and Indiana. A second shortwave trough brought <b>the</b> <b>remnants</b> of Allison southward into Alabama. It turned to the northwest, and <b>the</b> <b>remnants</b> of Allison became unidentifiable over Arkansas on July 7.|$|R
5|$|However, <b>the</b> <b>remnant</b> low {{associated}} with Josephine {{began to show}} signs of redevelopment during the afternoon on September7. Convection around the system increased significantly and the low was no longer exposed. On September8, wind shear took over the system again. Convection around <b>the</b> <b>remnant</b> low was torn away and the low was exposed once more. The National Hurricane Center did not state the chance of regeneration once the low became exposed. Finally, on September 9, wind shear and dry air led to the remnants of Josephine deteriorating into an open wave. However, on September10, the remnants of Josephine redeveloped and global models picked up on the reformed system. Once more, the chance of regeneration was possible as the remnants of Josephine headed towards the Bahamas. However, on September14, dry air and wind shear caused the remnants to dissipate entirely.|$|E
5|$|In Spain, the new {{government}} of the Second Republic declared the monastery a National Monument in June 1931, but not in time to prevent the mass removal of stones. Today, <b>the</b> <b>remnant</b> buildings and walls stand on private farmland.|$|E
5|$|In about 65 billion years, it {{estimated}} that the Moon may end up colliding with the Earth, assuming they are not destroyed by the red giant Sun, due to the remaining energy of the Earth–Moon system being sapped by <b>the</b> <b>remnant</b> Sun, causing the Moon to slowly move inwards toward the Earth.|$|E
50|$|After the {{destruction}} of <b>the</b> castle, <b>the</b> <b>remnants</b> were covered by a motte, on top of which the Copenhagen Castle and later Christiansborg Palace were constructed. <b>The</b> <b>remnants</b> of <b>the</b> castle were discovered and excavated in 1907 and 1917 during {{the construction of the}} present Christiansborg Palace.|$|R

5|$|Late on December8, Epsilon transitioned into {{a remnant}} low {{pressure}} area. <b>The</b> <b>remnant</b> circulation elongated {{in advance of}} a frontal zone, and it dissipated late on December9. The front absorbed the remnants the next day.|$|E
5|$|Many years later, {{the trunk}} that was damaged as {{reported}} by Verdaguer, was struck by lightning and the top half broke off. <b>The</b> <b>remnant</b> of that trunk is still supported by a small stone wall.|$|E
5|$|On November 15, 2010, astronomers using NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory {{announced}} that, while viewing <b>the</b> <b>remnant</b> of SN 1979C in {{the galaxy}} Messier 100, they have discovered an object which could be a young, 30-year-old black hole. NASA also noted the possibility this object could be a spinning neutron star producing a wind of high energy particles.|$|E
50|$|On September 19 at {{the village}} of Majdan Ostrowski, General Krukowicz-Przedrzymirski reorganized his forces, merging <b>the</b> <b>remnants</b> of <b>the</b> 33rd I.D. with <b>the</b> <b>remnants</b> of <b>the</b> 41st I.D. The new unit, with 6000 {{soldiers}} and 35 cannons, was named the 41st I.D., was commanded by General Wacław Piekarski.|$|R

5|$|On September 13, {{despite being}} in an {{extremely}} hostile environment with very high wind shear, convection redeveloped {{near the center of}} Fred, and regeneration into a tropical cyclone was seen as a possibility. Two days later, the NHC noted that environmental conditions could become marginally favorable for redevelopment of the system. On September16, the circulation of Fred became less defined and only intermittent convection persisted around the system. By September17, <b>the</b> <b>remnant</b> circulation became increasingly disorganized and the system dissipated later that day without regenerating into a tropical cyclone. However, several hours later, a new area of low pressure formed in association with the remnants of Fred roughly 525mi (845km) south of Bermuda. <b>The</b> <b>remnant</b> low finally dissipated on September19, roughly 520mi (835km) southwest of Bermuda.|$|E
5|$|Psamtik I of Egypt (r. 664 – 610 BCE) is {{reported}} to have besieged the great city Azotus for twenty-nine years (Herodotus, ii. 157); the biblical references to <b>the</b> <b>remnant</b> of Ashdod (Jeremiah 25:20; cf Zephaniah 2:4) are interpreted as allusions to this event.|$|E
5|$|Several {{days after}} the low dissipated, <b>the</b> <b>remnant</b> {{moisture}} from Josephine brought showers and thunderstorms to St. Croix where up to 1in (25.4mm) of rain fell. The heavy rains led to minor street flooding and some urban flooding. No known damage {{was caused by the}} flood.|$|E
