5|$|Modelling is {{far from}} the only {{possible}} way to illustrate mathematical concepts. Giotto's Stefaneschi <b>Triptych,</b> 1320, illustrates recursion in the form of mise en abyme; the central panel of the <b>triptych</b> contains, lower left, the kneeling figure of Cardinal Stefaneschi, holding up the <b>triptych</b> as an offering. Giorgio Chirico's metaphysical paintings such as his 1917 Great Metaphysical Interior explore the question of levels of representation in art by depicting paintings within his paintings.|$|E
5|$|<b>Triptych,</b> May–June 1973 is a <b>triptych</b> {{completed}} in 1973 by the Irish-born artist Francis Bacon (1909–1992). The oil-on-canvas was painted {{in memory of}} Bacon's lover George Dyer, who committed suicide {{on the eve of}} the artist's retrospective at Paris's Grand Palais on 24 October 1971. The <b>triptych</b> is a portrait of the moments before Dyer's death from an overdose of pills in their hotel room. Bacon was haunted and preoccupied by Dyer's loss for the remaining years of his life and painted many works based on both the actual suicide and the events of its aftermath. He admitted to friends that he never fully recovered, describing the 1973 <b>triptych</b> as an exorcism of his feelings of loss and guilt.|$|E
5|$|Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion {{is a key}} {{precursor}} to Bacon's later work, and he sustained its formal and thematic preoccupations throughout his career. The <b>triptych</b> format, the placement of figures behind glass in heavily gilded frames, the open mouth, the use of painterly distortion, the Furies, and {{the theme of the}} Crucifixion were all to reappear in later works. Bacon's principal mode of expression is introduced: the subjects are anatomically and physically distorted, and the mood is violent, foreboding, and relentlessly physical. In other respects the <b>triptych</b> stands apart from other paintings in his oeuvre. It refers directly to its inspirations, and interprets the source material in an uncharacteristically literal manner. The <b>triptych</b> is further distinct in that its creatures are located in an outside space; by 1948, Bacon's studies of heads and figures specifically emphasised their confinement in rooms or other closed spaces.|$|E
50|$|The Irish-born artist Francis Bacon (1909-1992) painted 28 known <b>triptychs</b> between 1944 and 1986. He {{began to}} work in the format in the mid-1940s with a number of smaller scale formats before graduating in 1962 to large examples. He {{followed}} the larger style for 30 years, although he painted a number of smaller scale <b>triptychs</b> of friend's heads, and {{after the death of his}} former lover George Dyer in 1971, the three Black <b>Triptychs.</b>|$|R
50|$|Much smaller private altarpieces, often portable, {{were made}} for wealthy {{individuals}} to use at home, often as folding diptychs or <b>triptychs</b> for safe transport. In the Middle Ages very small diptychs or <b>triptychs</b> carved in ivory or other materials were popular.|$|R

5|$|Biko was commemorated {{in several}} artworks after his death. Gerard Sekoto, a South African artist based in France, {{produced}} Homage to Steve Biko in 1978, and another South African artist, Peter Stopforth, included a work entitled The Interrogators in his 1979 exhibition.

5|$|Scholars have {{proposed}} that Bosch used the outer panels to establish a Biblical setting for the inner elements of the work, and the exterior image is generally interpreted as set in an earlier time {{than those in the}} interior. As with Bosch's Haywain <b>triptych,</b> the inner centerpiece is flanked by heavenly and hellish imagery. The scenes depicted in the <b>triptych</b> are thought to follow a chronological order: flowing from left-to-right they represent Eden, the garden of earthly delights, and Hell. God appears as the creator of humanity in the left hand wing, while the consequences of humanity's failure to follow his will are shown in the right.However, in contrast to Bosch's two other complete triptychs, The Last Judgment (around 1482) and The Haywain (after 1510), God is absent from the central panel. Instead, this panel shows humanity acting with apparent free will as naked men and women engage in various pleasure-seeking activities. According to some interpretations, the right hand panel is believed to show God's penalties in a hellscape.|$|E
5|$|Sowing and Harvesting and Market, popularly {{referred}} to as the Vršac <b>triptych,</b> is a three-panel oil painting by the Serbian realist Paja Jovanović. Painted around 1895, it shows the everyday interactions of the inhabitants of Vršac, a multi-ethnic and multi-religious town in the Banat region of Austria-Hungary of which Jovanović was a native. The painting was commissioned by the Vršac city council in 1895 for the following year's Budapest Millennium Exhibition.|$|E
5|$|Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion is a 1944 <b>triptych</b> {{painted by}} the Irish-born British artist Francis Bacon.

5|$|Although he {{had been}} {{painting}} for almost twenty years, Bacon steadfastly insisted that Three Studies was the fons et origo of his career. He destroyed many of his earlier canvasses, and tried to suppress those that had left his studio. Bacon was emphatic that no pre-1944 images be admitted into his canon, {{and most of the}} early art critics agreed with this position. The early publications of John Russell and David Sylvester open with the 1944 <b>triptych,</b> and Bacon insisted to his death that no retrospective should feature paintings pre-dating 1944.|$|E
5|$|Although the Madonna's throne {{is in the}} mid-ground, {{her head}} is level with the {{standing}} figures in the foreground, who are closer in perspective. The apse in which she sits adds to the illusion of depth and is an expanded area for her throne. A similar approach {{can be seen in}} the later Dresden <b>Triptych,</b> but that work contains a better handling of spatial depth; Mary's throne is moved back, and the donors and saints are relegated to wing panels. The figures in Canon van der Paele are within a more confined space, are somewhat cramped, but far more monumental.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the title}} has {{religious}} connotations, Bacon's personal outlook was bleak; as an atheist {{he did not}} believe in either divine intervention nor an afterlife. As such, this work—through the inevitable fate of the prey—seems to represent a nihilistic and hopeless view of the human condition. Bacon later dismissed the painting, considering it too literal and explicit. He abandoned the theme of the crucifixion for the following 12 years, not returning to it until the more loosely based, but equally bleak, <b>triptych</b> Three Studies for a Crucifixion.|$|E

5|$|In the late-13th century, many of {{the newly}} {{emerging}} painter's guilds were nominating Luke as their patron saint. The van der Weyden panel is among the first known depictions of St Luke painting the Virgin in Northern Renaissance art, along with a similar work, a lost <b>triptych</b> panel by Robert Campin. Van der Weyden presents a humanised Virgin and Child, {{as suggested by the}} realistic contemporary surroundings, the lack of halos, and the intimate spatial construction. Yet he infuses the panel with extensive religious iconography.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1895, on the orders of the Patriarch of Karlovci, Georgije I, the Congress Board of Sremski Karlovci {{commissioned}} the young realist Paja Jovanović to paint Migration of the Serbs, intending {{for it to be}} displayed as part of the Serb pavilion. Georgije had originally approached the artist Uroš Predić, but Predić said it would take him two years to complete the painting. Jovanović assured the Patriarch that he could finish the work in eight months. The painting was one of two works that Jovanović was hired to paint for the Exhibition, the other being the Vršac <b>triptych,</b> which was commissioned by the Vršac city council.|$|E

The harbour was designed and constructed by engineer Paskoje Miličević in the late 15th century.

5|$|Puccini {{had long}} {{considered}} writing {{a set of}} one-act operas which would be performed together in a single evening, but faced {{with a lack of}} suitable subjects and opposition from his publisher, he repeatedly put the project aside. However, by 1916 Puccini had completed the one-act tragedy Il tabarro and, after considering various ideas, he began work the following year on the solemn, religious, all-female opera Suor Angelica. Gianni Schicchi, a comedy, completes the <b>triptych</b> with a further contrast of mood. The score combines elements of Puccini's modern style of harmonic dissonance with lyrical passages reminiscent of Rossini, and it has been praised for its inventiveness and imagination.|$|E
5|$|The Anglican parish {{church of}} St Peter was {{originally}} {{built in the}} mid 13th century and had a three-stage tower added in the 15th, however it was extensively restored when the main house {{was built in the}} late 17th century. The church consists of a north and south aisle, chancel and south west porch with the tower to the west. In the south aisle are encaustic tiles dating from the 13th century. The font is Norman while the pulpit is Jacobean. There is also a 16th-century Flemish altar <b>triptych.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} representing Vršac at the Exhibition {{was originally}} meant to depict folk hero Janko Halabura fighting the Turks, {{an idea to}} which Jovanović took a liking. The Vršac council members soon changed their minds, and Jovanović was asked to paint a composition showing the everyday lives of the town's inhabitants. Over {{the course of the}} triptych's creation, Jovanović visited his hometown {{on a number of occasions}} for the purpose of sketching its people and structures. The <b>triptych</b> proved to be a particularly difficult undertaking. Jovanović's firm grasp in Western Medieval panel and mural painting proved of great importance. Earlier, Jovanović had been the recipient of several church commissions that called for multi-sectional painting, though not to the same extent as some of his contemporaries, such as Uroš Predić. Each scene needed to connect seamlessly with the others, and Jovanović was met with the additional challenge of painting a number of figures engaged in actions requiring precise definition. The artist addressed this by carefully drawing each figure, the landscape and the panels themselves so as to ensure compositional unity. To ensure natural light, Jovanović painted the <b>triptych</b> out of studio, en plein air. It took the artist about ten months to complete.|$|E

500|$|When the <b>triptych's</b> {{wings are}} closed, {{the design of}} the outer panels becomes visible. Rendered in a green–gray grisaille, these panels lack colour, {{probably}} because most Netherlandish <b>triptychs</b> were thus painted, but possibly indicating that the painting reflects a time before the creation of the sun and moon, which were formed, according to Christian theology, to [...] "give light to the earth". It was common for the outer panels of Netherlandish altarpieces to be in grisaille, such that their blandness highlighted the splendid colour inside.|$|R
