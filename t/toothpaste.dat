5|$|Historically, {{most cases}} of {{fluoride}} poisoning {{have been caused}} by accidental ingestion of insecticides containing inorganic fluorides. Most current calls to poison control centers for possible fluoride poisoning come from the ingestion of fluoride-containing <b>toothpaste.</b> Malfunctioning water fluoridation equipment is another cause: one incident in Alaska affected almost 300 people and killed one person. Dangers from <b>toothpaste</b> are aggravated for small children, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends supervising children below six brushing their teeth so that they do not swallow <b>toothpaste.</b> One regional study examined a year of pre-teen fluoride poisoning reports totaling 87 cases, including one death from ingesting insecticide. Most had no symptoms, but about 30% had stomach pains. A larger study across the U.S. had similar findings: 80% of cases involved children under six, and there were few serious cases.|$|E
5|$|Sodium lauryl {{sulphate}} (SLS), a detergent {{present in}} some brands of <b>toothpaste</b> and other oral healthcare products, may produce oral ulceration in some individuals. It {{has been shown}} that aphthous stomatitis is more common in people using toothpastes containing SLS, and that some reduction in ulceration occurs when a SLS-free <b>toothpaste</b> is used. Some have argued that since SLS is almost ubiquitously used in oral hygiene products, there is unlikely to be a true predisposition for aphthous stomatitis caused by SLS.|$|E

25|$|Companies such as Tom's of Maine, among others, {{manufacture}} {{natural and}} herbal <b>toothpastes</b> and market them to consumers {{who wish to}} avoid the artificial ingredients commonly found in regular <b>toothpastes.</b> Many herbal <b>toothpastes</b> do not contain fluoride or sodium lauryl sulfate. The ingredients found in natural <b>toothpastes</b> vary widely but often include baking soda, aloe, eucalyptus oil, myrrh, plant extract (strawberry extract), and essential oils.|$|R
40|$|Objective. To {{provide a}} brief {{commentary}} review of fluoride-containing <b>toothpastes</b> and mouthrinses {{with emphasis on}} their use at home. <b>Toothpastes</b> and mouthrinses are just two of many ways of providing fluoride {{for the prevention of}} dental caries. The first investigations into incorporating fluoride into <b>toothpastes</b> and mouthrinses were reported in the middle 1940 s. Unlike water fluoridation (which is ‘automatic fluoridation’), fluoride-containing <b>toothpastes</b> and fluoride-containing mouthrinses are, primarily, for home use and need to be purchased by the individual. By the 1960 s, research indicated that fluoride could be successfully incorporated into <b>toothpastes</b> and clinical trials demonstrated their effectiveness. By the end of the 1970 s, almost all <b>toothpastes</b> contained fluoride. The widespread use of fluoride-containing <b>toothpastes</b> is thought to be the main reason for much improved oral health in many countries. Of the many fluoride compounds investigated, sodium fluoride, with a compatible abrasive, is the most popular, although amine fluorides are used widely in Europe. The situation is similar for mouthrinses. Concentrations of fluoride (F), commonly found, are 1500 ppm (1500 μg F/g) for <b>toothpastes</b> and 225 ppm (225 μg F/ml) for mouthrinse. Several systematic reviews have concluded that fluoride-containing <b>toothpastes</b> and mouthrinses are effective, and that there is added benefit from their use with other fluoride delivery methods such as water fluoridation. Guidelines for the appropriate use of fluoride <b>toothpastes</b> and mouthrinses are available in many countries. Conclusion. Fluoride <b>toothpastes</b> and mouthrinses have been developed and extensive testing has demonstrated that they are effective and their use should be encouraged...|$|R

It was an improvement on the units installed in previous Salyut stations, but proved {{difficult to use}} due to {{the time required to}} set up, use, and stow. The shower, which {{featured a}} plastic curtain and fan to collect water via an airflow, was later converted into a steam room; it eventually had its plumbing removed and the space was reused. When the shower was unavailable, crew members washed using wet wipes, with soap dispensed from a <b>toothpaste</b> tube-like container, or using a washbasin equipped with a plastic hood, located in the core module. Crews were also provided with rinse-less shampoo and edible <b>toothpaste</b> to save water.|$|E
5|$|Several nuns {{were given}} a {{platform}} to air their views including activist nuns such as Marjorie Tuite, Margaret Traxler, and six nuns of the order Sisters of Loretto, an order known for its work on pacifism and social justice. In some cases, signers of the statement grew more radical in their beliefs after being reprimanded by church authority. In the publicity surrounding the dispute with the nuns and the theologians, the statistics showing that most American Catholics disagreed with church teachings about abortion were repeated many times. Traxler appeared in a television spot with a tube of <b>toothpaste,</b> saying that you cannot put the <b>toothpaste</b> back in the tube. The various responses to the 1984 advertisement and its aftermath remained in the news through 1986.|$|E
5|$|Fluoride {{therapy is}} often {{recommended}} {{to protect against}} dental caries. Water fluoridation and fluoride supplements decrease the incidence of dental caries. Fluoride helps prevent dental decay by binding to the hydroxyapatite crystals in enamel. The incorporated fluoride makes enamel more resistant to demineralization and thus more resistant to decay. Topical fluoride, such as a fluoride <b>toothpaste</b> or mouthwash, is also recommended to protect teeth surfaces. Many dentists include application of topical fluoride solutions as part of routine cleanings.|$|E
50|$|Desensitizing <b>toothpastes</b> {{containing}} {{potassium nitrate}} {{have been used}} since the 1980s while <b>toothpastes</b> with potassium chloride or potassium citrate have been available since at least 2000. It is believed that potassium ions diffuse along the dentinal tubules to inactivate intradental nerves. However, , {{this has not been}} confirmed in intact human teeth and the desensitizing mechanism of potassium-containing <b>toothpastes</b> remains uncertain. Since 2000, several trials have shown that potassium-containing <b>toothpastes</b> can be effective in reducing dentin hypersensitivity, although rinsing the mouth after brushing may reduce their efficacy.|$|R

40|$|Introduction: <b>Toothpastes</b> {{are one of}} {{the most}} widely sold and used dental products, with their use as one of the most popular oral hygiene {{behaviors}} in developed countries. A large variety of <b>toothpastes</b> are available on the market for different purpose, making it difficult for patients to select appropriate ones and for clinicians to prescribe the most useful one. This review provides details on the ingredients of <b>toothpastes</b> and their clinical use, trying to assist oral care practitioners in recommending appropriate <b>toothpastes</b> to their patients based on their individual needs. Review Report: This review was carried out by running a search in various databases, including references books, PubMed, ISI Web of Science and Google search engine from 1973 to 2011 using the terms <b>toothpastes,</b> Periodontics and dental plaque. Results: There are large varieties of <b>toothpastes</b> for different purposes: caries prevention, gingivitis prevention, anti-calculus, dentin hypersensitivity prevention and for tooth whitening, with a wide range of active and non-active ingredients, including abrasives, humectants, preservatives, thickening or binding agents, detergents, flavoring agents and therapeutic agents as fluoride, bacteriostatics, pyrophosphates, tooth desensitizing agents etc. Some studies have evaluated the effects, advantages and disadvantages of each ingredient. Conclusion: It is absolutely necessary for dental practitioners to have a sound knowledge of chemical compositions and ingredients of <b>toothpastes</b> to be able to assist their patients in selecting appropriate and efficacious <b>toothpastes...</b>|$|R
40|$|This study {{determines the}} {{antimicrobial}} efficacy of miswak (aqueous and alcoholic) extracts comparing with five different <b>toothpastes,</b> {{which are available}} in Iraqi market, against different kinds of bacteria. The antibacterial efficacy of aqueous and alcoholic extracts of Salvadora persica and different kinds of <b>toothpastes</b> was studied against different cariogenic and pathogenic bacteria including Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa by well diffusion method. Salvodora persica extracts and <b>toothpastes</b> exhibited the greatest antimicrobial activities towards Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus acidophilus, E. coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa respectively. Alcoholic extract was dominant on aqueous extract in inhibiting the tested microorganisms. <b>Toothpastes</b> A were dominant comparing with the other <b>toothpastes</b> in inhibiting the tested microorganisms. The impact of <b>toothpastes</b> was almost more than Salvodora persica extracts on tested microorganisms. According to the good efficacy of Salvodora persica extracts on the tested microorganisms, it has antibacterial effects and {{could be used as}} a therapeutic agent and therefore, it appears to be a potent antimicrobial agents that could be considered as a medicinal plant...|$|R

5|$|Many calcium {{compounds}} {{are used}} in food, as pharmaceuticals, and in medicine, among others. For example, calcium and phosphorus are supplemented in foods through the addition of calcium lactate, calcium diphosphate, and tricalcium phosphate. The last is also used as a polishing agent in <b>toothpaste</b> and in antacids. Calcium lactobionate is a white powder that {{is used as a}} suspending agent for pharmaceuticals. In baking, calcium monophosphate is used as a leavening agent. Calcium sulfite is used as a bleach in papermaking and as a disinfectant, calcium silicate is used as a reinforcing agent in rubber, and calcium acetate is a component of liming rosin and is used to make metallic soaps and synthetic resins.|$|E
5|$|Owing to {{the expense}} of {{refining}} pure fluorine, most commercial applications use fluorine compounds, with about half of mined fluorite used in steelmaking. The rest of the fluorite is converted into corrosive hydrogen fluoride en route to various organic fluorides, or into cryolite which {{plays a key role}} in aluminium refining. Organic fluorides have very high chemical and thermal stability; their major uses are as refrigerants, electrical insulation and cookware, the last as PTFE (Teflon). Pharmaceuticals such as atorvastatin and fluoxetine also contain fluorine, and the fluoride ion inhibits dental cavities, and so finds use in <b>toothpaste</b> and water fluoridation. Global fluorochemical sales amount to more than US$15 billion a year.|$|E
5|$|Reviews {{have shown}} that water {{fluoridation}} reduces cavities in children. A conclusion for the efficacy in adults is less clear with some reviews finding benefit and others not. Studies in the U.S. in the 1950s and 1960s showed that water fluoridation reduced childhood cavities by fifty to sixty percent, while studies in 1989 and 1990 showed lower reductions (40% and 18% respectively), likely due to increasing use of fluoride from other sources, notably <b>toothpaste,</b> and also the 'halo effect' of food and drink that is made in fluoridated areas and consumed in unfluoridated ones.|$|E
40|$|Objectives. The aim of {{the present}} paper was to review the {{published}} literature {{in order to identify}} all relevant studies for inclusion and to determine whether there was any evidence of the efficacy of strontium and potassium <b>toothpastes</b> in the treatment of dentine hypersensitivity (DH). Methods. Following a review of 94 relevant papers both from searching electronic databases (PUBMED) and hand searching of relevant written journals, 13 studies were identified, and 7 papers (1 for strontium-based <b>toothpastes</b> and 6 for potassium-based <b>toothpastes)</b> were finally accepted for inclusion. The main outcome measures were the methodology and assessment used by Investigators in studies designed to evaluate DH. Results. The results of the present paper would indicate that the reported efficacy of both strontium- and potassium-based <b>toothpastes</b> in relieving DH is questionable. Conclusions. The results from the present paper would appear to support the conclusions of previous investigators that there is only minimal evidence for the efficacy of both strontium- and potassium-based <b>toothpastes</b> in relieving symptoms of DH...|$|R

5|$|Since most {{toothache}} is {{the result}} of plaque-related diseases, such as tooth decay and periodontal disease, the majority of cases could be prevented by avoidance of a cariogenic diet and maintenance of good oral hygiene. That is, reduction in the number times that refined sugars are consumed per day and brushing the teeth twice a day with fluoride <b>toothpaste</b> and flossing. Regular visits to a dentist also increases the likelihood that problems are detected early and averted before toothache occurs. Dental trauma could also be significantly reduced by routine use of mouthguards in contact sports.|$|E
5|$|Treatment of meth mouth usually {{attempts}} to increase salivary flow, halt tooth decay, and encourage behavioral changes. <b>Toothpaste</b> with fluoride {{is very important}} to the restoration of dental health. Only prescription fluoride rinses can adequately treat the condition. Sialogogues, drugs that increase the amount of saliva in the mouth, can be used to treat dry mouth and protect against dental health problems. Pilocarpine and cevimeline are sialogogues approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat low salivation caused by Sjogren's syndrome and may have the potential to effectively treat dry mouth caused by methamphetamine use.|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Toothpastes</b> have {{widespread}} {{use in the}} population, and contain flavours to give a pleasant and often minty aroma. Flavours are prevalent allergens in <b>toothpastes,</b> and adverse reactions often present as perioral dermatitis or stomatitis. l-Carvone, a mint flavour found in spearmint oil, {{is one of these}} allergens. There are few studies on contact allergy to l-carvone, and some of them have indicated a positive relationship with oral lichenoid lesions. Objectives: To qualitatively and quantitatively investigate the presence of l-carvone in commercially available <b>toothpastes</b> on the Swedish market. Methods: l-Carvone in 66 <b>toothpastes</b> was analysed with straight-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The product labels were studied with regard to limonene. Results: l-Carvone was found in 64 of 66 <b>toothpastes</b> (concentration: 0. 00005 – 0. 35 %). In 10 of these, the concentration exceeded 0. 1 %. Higher concentrations of l-carvone were found if limonene was listed on the label. Conclusion: The majority of <b>toothpastes</b> on the Swedish market contain l-carvone, but the concentration hardly relates to the advertised flavour or labelled ingredients. It is hitherto unknown whether the found concentrations are sufficient for induction of contact allergy in individuals with healthy oral mucosa or in those with oral lichenoid lesions or other mucosal disease...|$|R

The total fluoride {{concentration of the}} <b>toothpastes</b> was determined by gas liquid chromatography. The amount of soluble fluoride was measured after dilution in artificial saliva and treatment of the supernatants with acidic phosphatase. The free fluoride concentration in this mixture was measured with a fluoride electrode. Twenty-five percent of all <b>toothpastes</b> contained less than 738 ppm total fluoride, and another 25 % contained between 738 and 977 ppm fluoride.

5|$|The {{music video}} begins with Clarkson {{sitting on a}} couch in an apartment's living room, holding a {{heart-shaped}} locket in her hand. The next scene shows Clarkson in the bathroom where she fixes {{her face in the}} mirror, she opens the medicine cabinet and tossing all the pills in the medicine cabinet over her shoulder and messing all the bathroom items on the floor, squirting the <b>toothpaste</b> into the sink. When she gets to a container of birth control pills, she turns on the water in the sink, snaps the pills out, and drops them down the drain. Clarkson then starts to take other items; she throws a container of makeup powder spray in the air and smears a container of facial mud mask on the wall. During the chorus, Clarkson and her band perform the song for a dancing crowd in a club. After the first chorus, Clarkson walks into a room full of closets. She cuts up dresses, rifling through the closets and pulling out clothes, destroying them and singing in a pile of them. After the second chorus, she walks into a bedroom and begins to tear the pillow on the bed, filling the room with feathers. The scenes of Clarkson singing with her band then alternate with a montage of her destroying the apartment, breaks the glass window from the door, breaks the vase, television, clock, fridge, lights, microwave, phone, furniture and the chair. Later, Clarkson takes a framed photo of her ex-boyfriend with another girl in the living room, before pushing a tall CD rack over. She then smashes the framed photo through a glass table, breaking it in half. Having decimated the apartment, Clarkson walks out the door and down the hallway with a hat on her head, just as her ex-boyfriend appears with his girlfriend, walking arm in arm. Clarkson hides her face as she walks away from them. The final scene shows the couple seeing their damaged apartment in shock and the scene of the locket swinging.|$|E
