40|$|Graduation date: 1978 The low {{temperature}} geothermal resource at Klamath Falls, Oregon {{is widely used}} for heating buildings. A common technique for using this resource consists of a heat exchanger down in the well inside a casing which extends {{the full length of}} the well. Slots are cut in the casing to allow circulation of the geothermal water into the casing and past the downhole heat exchanger. This results in <b>thermosyphoning</b> between the inside and outside of the casing. Mathematical models of <b>thermosyphoning</b> through the well casing were developed for both with and without downhole heat exchanger present. Results of the model without heat exchanger present showed that <b>thermosyphoning</b> is sufficient to account for observed flow rates through the casing. Model results with heat exchanger included show the substantial influence of <b>thermosyphoning</b> on heat transfer rates and indicate several promising approaches to maximizing output. Because of the importance of scaling and corrosion on the success of a downhole heat exchanger installation, a study of available literature on scaling and corrosion relevant to downhole heat exchangers in {{low temperature}} geothermal systems was made and recommendations for corrosion control were developed.

The design of <b>thermosyphons</b> for such an application is determined, in part, by the flooding limit.

These buildings are, in general, only occupied significantly during the day; consequently the bulk of heating demand coincides with the period of solar gain. In these circumstances collected solar heat should be delivered with the minimum of delay. The design and operation of units which are capable of supplying solar heated air in this manner is outlined. These are passive, naturalcirculation air-heating collectors, also known as natural-convection air-heaters, or <b>thermosyphoning</b> air panels. Four methods of retrofitting such solar collectors to non-domestic buildings have been identified, one of which, the overcladding collector, has not been proposed previously. Problems associated with the successful installation and operation of these units have also been considered. The relative merits of a number of methods of testing passive solarenergy air-heating collectors have been investigated.

40|$|Graduation date: 1985 The Boleyn home {{located in}} Portland Oregon (latitude 45 Â°) is {{evaluated}} based on monitoring data taken from 1977 to 1982. The Boleyn {{home is a}} two-story (plus basement) frame home. It takes benefit of passive solar gains and is equipped with an active solar system. The active solar system consists of a 429 ftÂ² (39. 9 mÂ²) collector with 3750 gallons (14400 liter) of water for thermal storage. The active solar system and the monitoring equipment were installed by PGE (Portland General Electric Company). The performance {{of the building and}} of the active solar system and the validity of models predicting parameters of the home and of the solar system are evaluated. Performance of the home: The Boleyn home is a very well insulated house with low infiltration rate and benefits from passive solar gains obtained from 96 ft 2 of glass area to the south. The Boleyn home is heated by four sources: passive solar gains, internal gains, active solar system, and backup system. Reduced transmission losses through the floor area to the basement heated by losses from the solar storage tanks contributes a significant amount of the overall gain from the active solar system. Performance of the active system: The design goal of the solar system to meet 50 % of the house heating requirements was exceeded. The performance of the Revere double-glazed collector did not deteriorate over time and matchs the manufacturer's data within 5 %. A significant amount of heat was lost through the storage tanks because insulation was lacking on the tanks around penetrations and around the pipes. Heat loss due to <b>thermosyphoning</b> was present before installation of a backf low check valve in the collector loop. The overall efficiency of the system was improved by reducing the pump power in the solar collection loop and installation of an improved backup system. Installation of a domestic hot water preheat tank reduced the domestic hot water load by 73 %. Validity of predictive tools: The design heat loss calculated by using the ASHRAE method matched the experimentally evaluated design heat loss within 6 %. The annual heating requirements predicted by the degree-day-method by ASHRAE and Calpas 3 were accurate within 12 % and 21 % respectively. A large cooling load caused by passive solar gains predicted by Calpas 3 did not occur at the Boleyn home. The Boleyns open the windows and accept higher indoor temperatures than predicted by Calpas 3. The active solar fraction predicted by F -chart was 66. 3 %.

Experiment has been setup to validate the theoretical model and to evaluate the pumping characteristics of the <b>thermosyphon.</b> The variations of the generator pressure, flow resistance and driving head with heat input are presented graphically. Results indicate that strong solution and vapor flow rates increase with heat input and so dose the pumping ratio. In addition, the suitable heat input range corresponding to a certain <b>thermosyphon</b> tube diameter range was determined. These results {{can be used to}} design <b>thermosyphons</b> using LiBr-H 2 O as working fluid...|$|R
