5|$|Horses are {{odd-toed}} ungulates, {{or members}} of the order Perissodactyla. <b>This</b> <b>order</b> also includes the extant species of rhinos and tapirs, and many extinct families and species. Members of <b>this</b> <b>order</b> walk on either one toe (like horses) or three toes (like rhinos and tapirs). This {{is in contrast to}} even-toed ungulates, members of the order Artiodactyla, which walk on cloven hooves, or two toes. <b>This</b> <b>order</b> includes many species associated with livestock, such as sheep, goats, pigs, cows and camels, as well as species of giraffes, antelopes and deer.|$|E

40|$|A k-ary {{necklace}} of order n is an equivalence class of strings of length n of symbols from { 0, 1, [...] ., k − 1 } under cyclic rotation. In this paper we define an ordering {{on the free}} semigroup on two generators such that the binary strings of length n are in Gray-code order for each n. We take the binary necklace class representatives {{to be the least}} of each class in <b>this</b> <b>ordering.</b> We examine the properties of <b>this</b> <b>ordering</b> and in particular prove that all binary strings factor canonically as products of these representatives. We conjecture that stepping from one representative of length n to the next in <b>this</b> <b>ordering</b> requires only one bit flip, except at easily characterized steps. ...|$|R

40|$|Recursive path {{ordering}} (RPO) is {{a well-known}} reduction ordering introduced by Dershowitz [6], that is useful for proving termination of term rewriting systems (TRSs).

The goal of this application is to use case based reasoning to assist the user in arranging flights. It offers personalised service to its users and automatically learns their travel preferences. It stores these preferences in a user model that {{is directly related to the}} CBR process. It learns the user preferences by exploiting user feedback on sets of presented travel offers. When the user selects a preferred offer, the PTA establishes a preference ordering among the whole set. <b>This</b> <b>ordering</b> is calculated by measuring the similarity between the selected offer and each of the other offers. <b>This</b> <b>ordering</b> is used to rate these offers and store them in the user profile as cases. <b>This</b> <b>ordering</b> is also used to refine the user’s overall travel preferences by altering their personal similarity measure. ...|$|R
