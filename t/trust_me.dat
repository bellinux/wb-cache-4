The series, set around a fictional advertising firm, starred McCormack as Mason McGuire, the firm's newly promoted creative director, and deals with his best friend's (Cavanagh) unpredictable behavior. In an interview with USA Weekend, McCormack revealed he was not afraid of being typecast. McCormack's decision to do the show was due to [...] "great writing". The show debuted on January 26, 2009, and was watched by almost 3.4million viewers. <b>Trust</b> <b>Me</b> debuted to very positive reviews, with Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle writing, [...] "...the series is surprisingly solid." [...] Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times wrote that McCormack and Cavanagh [...] "manage to keep their characters sharply defined but low-key. They are opposites but not in an ash-smudged, Windex-wielding Felix and Oscar way." [...] The series, however, was cancelled after one season, due to poor ratings.|$|E

The film was screened under the name Nothing is Private at the 2007 Toronto International Film Festival. When he was first approached for the role, Eckhart revealed {{that he did not}} want to play a [...] "pedophile". When asked about the sex scenes, Eckhart said: [...] "Those were difficult times.... The way I did it was to really trust Alan. It was in the words. I really trusted Summer , and I tried to get her to <b>trust</b> <b>me,</b> to build a relationship when we were doing physical scenes. We'd really rehearse them mechanically, and I'd say, 'OK, I'm going to put my hand here, I'm going to do this.'... I think I found it more difficult."

500|$|Before {{becoming}} {{a model to}} support her acting career, Guillory waited tables at a club. In an interview in 2000, she said about the experience [...] "Supporting my acting habit with waitressing {{was probably the most}} useful thing I've done." [...] During her time as a model, she studied acting at the New World School of the Arts and the Paris Conservatoire, also taking small television and film roles in The Future Lasts a Long Time (1996), The Rules of Engagement (1999), Star! Star! (1999), Kiss Kiss (Bang Bang) (2000), The 3 Kings (2000), and Two Days, Nine Lives (2000). During this time, Guillory decided to go on with her acting career because [...] "I was so scared of going to university and being with people my own age again, having been with that tiny little sect of girls in Norfolk whose daddies were farmers and politicians, who didn't <b>trust</b> <b>me</b> and didn't know where I was coming from".|$|E
500|$|... "Say Yes" [...] {{received}} generally favorable reviews. Colin Stutz of Billboard described [...] "Say Yes" [...] as a [...] "peppy" [...] number. John Walker of MTV News {{described the}} song's refrain as [...] "infectious". Mike Wass from Idolator praised the song's catchiness, describing {{it as an}} [...] "infectious gospel club-banger" [...] and {{an invitation to the}} dance floor for listeners. Further, he called it [...] "possibly the first twerk-inducing song of praise". He concluded his review, writing, [...] "those harmonies remain unrivaled and the chorus is a monster. <b>Trust</b> <b>me,</b> [...] will be stuck in your head after the first listen." [...] In another review he felt that the song managed {{to bridge the gap between}} gospel and popular music. Describing the song as [...] "kinetic", Marc Hogan of Spin magazine called it [...] "not only star-studded, but damn near impossible to get out of your head, too". Rolling Stone writer Jon Blistein described the horn stabs as [...] "heavenly" [...] and praised the trio's [...] "always potent harmonies".|$|E

He also said he felt [...] "kind of trapped in that material" [...] {{and that there was}} [...] "no way out". He also admitted to a post-ceremony fight on Twitter with longtime Oscars writer Bruce Vilanch. When Vilanch intimated that the busy actor appeared less than fully committed to the job, Franco posted a photo {{of the two of them}} together graffiti-ed saying [...] "James Fucked up the oscars. <b>Trust</b> <b>me,</b> I KNOW comedy. I mean, come on, I write for Bette Midler". Franco explained to Playboy that [...] "I personally do not do my best thinking when I'm angry.

500|$|Titanic {{suffered}} backlash {{in addition}} to its success. In 2003, the film topped a poll of [...] "Best Film Endings", and yet it also topped a poll by Film 2003 as [...] "the worst movie of all time". The British film magazine Empire reduced their rating of the film from the maximum five stars and an enthusiastic review, to four stars with a less positive review in a later edition, to accommodate its readers' tastes, who wanted to disassociate themselves from the hype surrounding the film, and the reported activities of its fans, such as those attending multiple screenings. In addition to this, positive and negative parodies and other such spoofs of the film abounded and were circulated on the internet, often inspiring passionate responses from fans of various opinions of the film. Benjamin Willcock of DVDActive.com did not understand the backlash or the passionate hatred for the film. [...] "What really irks me...," [...] he said, [...] "are those who make nasty stabs at those who do love it." [...] Willcock stated, [...] "I obviously don't have anything against those who dislike Titanic, but those few who make you feel small and pathetic for doing so (and they do exist, <b>trust</b> <b>me)</b> are way beyond my understanding and sympathy." ...|$|E
500|$|Jape's second album, The Monkeys in the Zoo Have More Fun Than Me was {{released}} by <b>Trust</b> <b>Me</b> I'm A Thief Records in 2004. It enjoyed much more success than its predecessor and contains the well-known single [...] "Floating" [...] which was given much airplay on late night alternative radio shows. The lead single [...] "Floating" [...] was famously overheard being played in Whelan's in Dublin by the musician Brendan Benson. Benson immediately requested {{a copy of the}} album and then praised Jape in The Guardian – however, the newspaper spelt it [...] "Jabe". He also rang Egan personally to inform him he would be covering [...] "Floating" [...] with his band The Raconteurs. However, Egan has stated that he did not give Benson personal permission to cover the song. He did witness the cover live at the Olympia Theatre and was later to describe it as [...] "a great moment". The single is also covered by Soulwax during their DJ sets. Jape participated in two nationwide tours with both David Kitt and The Redneck Manifesto to promote the album's release. Kitt was co-producer of [...] "Floating". The band went on to perform at prominent Irish festivals such as Electric Picnic and Hard Working Class Heroes.|$|E
500|$|On January 19, 2012, Stallone {{stated that}} the film was being aimed at a PG-13 audience. Unlike the first film (which was {{restricted}} to viewers over age 17), this {{would have made the}} sequel available to all viewers over 13 years of age (and younger children, with parental consent). The reported change received a negative reception. Speaking to Ain't It Cool News about the change, Stallone said [...] "The PG-13 rumor is true, but before your readers pass judgement, <b>trust</b> <b>me</b> when I say this film is large in every way and delivers on every level." [...] It was reported that the change was requested by Norris before he would take part in the film, because he did not appreciate the swearing in the script. However, these plans for a more family-friendly rating did not succeed and the finished film was rated R. When the adult-oriented rating was confirmed shortly before release, West stated that [...] "the shooting style and the dialogue, from day one, it was R-rated." [...] However, the visual effects supervisor said that The Expendables 2 was shot as a PG-13 film, with all bullet wounds being dust-hits. Once it was decided that the film would be R-rated, blood, decapitations, eviscerations and severed limbs were digitally added in post-production.|$|E
