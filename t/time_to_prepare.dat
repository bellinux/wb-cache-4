5|$|The Syrian Army {{was meant}} to consist of two brigade-sized units, {{but there was no}} <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>prepare</b> them, thus only the 1st Brigade {{was in a state of}} {{readiness}} by May 15. It had about 2,000 soldiers in two infantry battalions, one armored battalion, and 4–6 artillery batteries.|$|E

50|$|Though {{defenses}} {{now understand}} how to stop the wildcat, {{it does not mean}} the formation is no longer useful. A defense's practice time is finite. Opponents who <b>prepare</b> <b>to</b> stop the wildcat have less <b>time</b> available <b>to</b> <b>prepare</b> for other offensive approaches. Many teams admit to spending an inordinate amount of <b>time</b> having <b>to</b> <b>prepare</b> for this scheme.|$|R
50|$|Convinced {{that this}} new {{conception}} was a more reasonable approach to art, I gave much <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>preparing</b> with Professor Fenollosa a progressive series of synthetic exercises. My first experiment in applying these in teaching was made in 1889 in my Boston classes, with Professor Fenollosa as lecturer on the philosophy and history of art.|$|R
5|$|The {{performers}} {{were allowed}} to improvise provided that they maintained factual accuracy. Howick said that improvisation was actually often necessary due to the rapid-fire pace of filming, which left very little <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>prepare</b> for individual roles. On the other hand, both Rickard and Baynton suggest this enforced spontaneity may have ultimately worked to enhance the comedy, not least by preventing the jokes from becoming over-rehearsed.|$|E
5|$|After several {{damaging}} air attacks, {{the naval}} surface combatants from both America and Japan {{withdrew from the}} battle area without either side securing a clear victory. However, the U.S. and its allies gained tactical and strategic advantage. Japan's losses were greater and included dozens of aircraft and their experienced aircrews. Also, Japanese reinforcements intended for Guadalcanal were delayed and eventually delivered by warships rather than transport ships, giving the Allies more <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>prepare</b> for the Japanese counteroffensive and preventing the Japanese from landing heavy artillery, ammunition, and other supplies.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Dean's {{smooth and}} well-predicted track gave unusually advance warning {{to all of}} the nations in its path and allowed them <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>prepare</b> for the storm's impact. Because of the advance warning and Dean's {{extraordinary}} strength, the nations of Central America and the Caribbean set up hundreds of shelters, readied thousands of disaster recovery experts, evacuated hundreds of thousands of vulnerable residents, and prepared millions of dollars of emergency supplies.|$|E

5|$|Initially, {{the living}} {{conditions}} of the Robinsons varied according {{to whether or not}} they had had <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>prepare.</b> There were roughly three days between the signing of the capitulation and the deadline for civilians to leave the city, during which those who made the decision to stay could stockpile food and water, and camouflage their hiding places. As time passed, supplies ran out, and many Robinsons had to change their locations for security reasons. The situation soon became equally desperate for all who remained.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{scheduled}} to be played on November 20, in July 2010 this game was moved to Thursday, November 18 to give the Crimson Tide extra <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>prepare</b> for its game against Auburn. In the first ever meeting against the Georgia State Panthers, the Crimson Tide was victorious 63–7. Alabama scored first on an eight-yard Greg McElroy pass to Julio Jones. After a Mark Barron interception ended the first Georgia State drive, Alabama responded with a 71-yard drive capped by a one-yard Mark Ingram touchdown run to take a 14–0 lead.|$|E

5|$|The {{case was}} {{automatically}} {{appealed to the}} Utah Supreme Court, which upheld Taylor's conviction and sentence in October 1991. Taylor's execution was initially scheduled for January 15, 1992. The date was rescheduled to June 24 when Taylor's attorney Martin Gravis requested {{to withdraw from the}} case. On June 17, Judge Roth granted a stay of execution after Taylor's new defense attorney Ron Yengich requested more <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>prepare</b> an appeal. At issue was a new 1992 law in Utah that established the sentence of life imprisonment without parole.|$|E
5|$|Unbeknownst to the Byzantines, Khalid had {{prepared}} {{for such a}} contingency by placing a strong outpost line in front during the night to counter surprises, which gave the Muslims <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>prepare</b> for battle. At the center, the Byzantines did not press hard, intending to pin down the Muslim centre corps in their position and preventing them from aiding the Muslim army in other areas. Thus the center remained stable.|$|E
5|$|Arnold {{was born}} in Connecticut and was a {{merchant}} operating ships on the Atlantic Ocean when the war broke out in 1775. He joined the growing army outside Boston and distinguished himself through acts of intelligence and bravery. His actions included the Capture of Fort Ticonderoga in 1775, defensive and delaying tactics at the Battle of Valcour Island on Lake Champlain in 1776 (allowing American forces <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>prepare</b> New York's defenses), the Battle of Ridgefield, Connecticut (after which {{he was promoted to}} major general), operations in relief of the Siege of Fort Stanwix, and key actions during the pivotal Battles of Saratoga in 1777, in which he suffered leg injuries that halted his combat career for several years.|$|E

The first major race with the car was the Mille Miglia, alongside Karl Kling and his old teammate Hermann Lang. Kling {{finished second in the}} race, Caracciola fourth. It later emerged that Caracciola had been given a car with an inferior engine to his teammates, perhaps {{because of a lack of}} <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>prepare</b> for the race. Caracciola's career ended with his third major crash; during a support race for the 1952 Swiss Grand Prix, the brakes on his 300SL locked and he skidded into a tree, fracturing his left leg.|$|E
5|$|Forecasters and {{computer}} models at the Miami-based National Hurricane Center predicted that Hurricane Dean would impact the Yucatán Peninsula a full 6days {{before the storm}} actually arrived. The hurricane's stable and well predicted path gave all {{of the countries in}} the region ample <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>prepare</b> for its arrival. On August 17, {{at the request of the}} Quintana Roo state government, which was expecting their state to suffer a direct hit, the Civil Protection Office of Mexico's federal Interior Ministry declared a state of emergency for the entire state. This included the towns and cities of Cancún, Playa del Carmen, and Chetumal as well as the islands of Cozumel, Isla Mujeres and Holbox.|$|E
5|$|However, {{these results}} {{also noted that}} the system might be able to work against longer-ranged missiles. Although these {{traveled}} at very high speeds, their higher altitude trajectories made detection simpler, and the longer flight times provided more <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>prepare.</b> Both projects were allowed to continue as research efforts, and were transferred to the US Air Force when that force separated from the Army in 1947. The Air Force faced significant budget constraints and cancelled Thumper in 1949 in order to use its funds to continue their GAPA surface-to-air missile (SAM) efforts. The next year Wizard's funding was also rolled into GAPA to develop a new long-range SAM design, which would emerge a decade later as the CIM-10 Bomarc. ABM research at the Air Force practically, although not officially, ended.|$|E

5|$|In Tokelau, many of {{the local}} {{officials}} feared about contamination since the cyclone had scattered human waste, trash, and other debris in the ocean and across the island. There was also an increase of mosquitoes and other insects, increasing {{the threat of a}} dengue fever outbreak. In addition, the storm damaged {{many of the}} hospitals, making treatment of the injured or displaced difficult. Criticism of government preparedness followed after Percy as emergency plans were not easily understood by the local population. In Nukunonu, the school, which was destroyed by Percy, was poorly built and vulnerable, and there was no early warning system. Also, many of the population had little <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>prepare</b> for the storm because of a social event held hours earlier.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the ARBiH offensive, the HVO had been assembling three of its four guards brigades under command of General Ante Roso, as well as other supporting units, including the 60th Guards Airborne Battalion. On 29 October, the Ministry of Defence of the Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia and the HVO General Staff met and decided to launch Operation Cincar to capture the town of Kupres. The decision was reportedly motivated by a desire to consolidate territory controlled by the HVO around Kupres and by the strategic importance of the Kupres plateau, which commanded the northern approaches to the HVO-held Livanjsko field. The operation was originally scheduled for 31 October at 4:30am, only to be postponed by 24hours, as the HVO needed more <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>prepare.</b> Delayed arrival of reconnaissance teams further postponed the HVO offensive until 8am on 1 November 1994.|$|E
5|$|The Melbourne Club {{decided that}} the team should wear red, white and blue colours on their {{clothing}} for the game. Although they had a long <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>prepare,</b> the MCC had some difficulty in assembling enough men to represent Port Phillip; many potential players were unable to spare the time to travel to Van Diemen's Land. Even as the team prepared to depart, only ten people had been found, and the eleventh, Duncan Cooper, only joined as they left on the steamer Shamrock. The eleven Victorian players, accompanied by many acquaintances, both men and women, arrived in Launceston on 9 February. On the evening of their arrival, they attended a dinner at the Cornwall Hotel with 100 paying guests. The following day, the team won a match against Bishopthorpe College. There was little time to practise before the intercolonial game.|$|E
