McCain introduced various policy proposals, and sought to improve his fundraising. Cindy McCain, who accounts {{for most of the}} couple's wealth with an estimated net worth of $100million, made part of her tax returns public in May. After facing criticism about lobbyists on staff, <b>the</b> <b>McCain</b> <b>campaign</b> issued new rules in May 2008 to avoid conflicts of interest, causing five top aides to leave.|$|E

25|$|Virginia {{election}} {{authorities were}} ordered {{by a federal}} judge to preserve late-arriving absentee ballots sent by active-duty military personnel following a suit by <b>the</b> <b>McCain</b> <b>campaign.</b> It alleged that the state sent absentee ballots late to service members. According to federal law, absentee ballots must be mailed to troops in foreign countries at least 45 days before an election. The charge against Virginia was that the ballots were not printed until after the deadline and therefore were mailed late to soldiers abroad.|$|E

25|$|In February 2009, a judge {{rejected}} motions made by {{the legal}} team for McCain and the Republican National Committee to dismiss the Browne lawsuit which charged possible copyright infringement, false endorsement and violation of Browne's right of publicity. The case was {{settled out of court}} for an undisclosed sum in July 2009, with <b>the</b> <b>McCain</b> <b>campaign,</b> the Ohio Republican Party, and the Republican National Committee issuing a joint apology for using the song. Their statement declared that McCain himself had been unaware of the use and did not condone it.|$|E
25|$|After announcing Palin as the {{presumptive}} vice-presidential nominee, <b>the</b> <b>McCain</b> <b>campaign</b> received $7million {{in contributions}} {{in a single}} day, and the Obama campaign garnered more than $8million by the next day. During the campaign, Palin evoked a more strongly divided response than Joe Biden among voters and was viewed both more favorably and unfavorably when compared to her opponent. A plurality of the television audience rated Biden's performance higher at the 2008 vice-presidential debate. Following the presidential election, 69% of Republicans felt Palin had helped John McCain's bid, while 20% felt Palin hurt. In the same poll, 71% of Republicans stated Palin had been the right choice.|$|E
25|$|February 9 saw {{voting in}} Louisiana, Kansas and Washington state. Huckabee won an easy victory in Kansas, {{claiming}} all 36 of the state's {{delegates to the}} national convention. Only 14,016 votes were cast, and <b>the</b> <b>McCain</b> <b>campaign</b> expressed no concern over the lightly attended caucus. However, social conservatives had a strong presence in the Kansas Republican party, and the results served to highlight conservative dissatisfaction with the Senator. Louisiana was much closer, but Huckabee won there as well, beating McCain by less than one percentage point. McCain was declared {{the winner of the}} Washington caucuses, where 18 delegates were at stake. The February 19 primary would determine the other 19 delegates from the state. After the caucuses, Huckabee's campaign indicated that they would challenge the results.|$|E

500|$|In early October 2008, the Keating Five scandal, its {{possible}} {{parallel to the}} subprime mortgage crisis and liquidity crisis of September 2008, and specifically the role in the scandal of Republican presidential nominee McCain, were briefly emphasized by the campaign of his Democratic opponent, Barack Obama, through a 13-minute [...] "documentary" [...] entitled Keating Economics. This introduction occurred after <b>the</b> <b>McCain</b> <b>campaign</b> began emphasizing the Obama–Ayers controversy. The Keating Five matter otherwise had little impact on McCain's eventually unsuccessful campaign.|$|E
500|$|When Obama {{became the}} Democrats' {{presumptive}} nominee in early June, McCain proposed joint town hall meetings, but Obama instead requested more traditional debates for the fall. In July, a staff shake-up put Steve Schmidt in full operational control of <b>the</b> <b>McCain</b> <b>campaign.</b> [...] Rick Davis remained as campaign manager {{but with a}} reduced role.

500|$|After McCain and Palin were {{defeated}} in the general election, a Republican campaign advisor told The New York Times that <b>the</b> <b>McCain</b> <b>Campaign</b> was not happy about the prank, which caused friction between McCain and Palin. McCain and his advisors were allegedly upset that Palin did not tell them beforehand that she planned to speak with who she thought was Nicolas Sarkozy. McCain strategist Steve Schmidt called a meeting and demanded to know who let Palin talk to the fake Sarkozy without checking with senior advisors first. Steve Biegun, one of Palin's aides admitting to vetting the call without speaking to campaign advisors or the U.S. State Department, told the Los Angeles Times that [...] "No one's going to beat me up more than I beat myself up for setting up the governor like that." ...|$|E
500|$|She made {{statements}} {{critical of}} the Bush administration for not deploying enough troops during the Iraq War. [...] Her close examination of the financial books of <b>the</b> <b>McCain</b> <b>campaign</b> during {{the first part of}} 2007 convinced the candidate that its profligate spending could not go on and led to the drastic mid-year reduction of the campaign's staff and scope. In February 2008, McCain made news by being critical of Michelle Obama, the wife of Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama, who had said, [...] "And let me tell you something: For {{the first time in my}} adult lifetime I am really proud of my country." [...] McCain, who was genuinely offended by the remark, replied: [...] "I am proud of my country. I don't know about you—if you heard those words earlier—I am very proud of my country." [...] Also in February 2008, she publicly appeared beside her husband during a press conference in response to a newspaper report regarding his connection to a lobbyist.|$|E
500|$|Cindy McCain {{spoke on}} both the opening and final nights of the early September 2008 Republican National Convention. [...] On the first night, {{truncated}} due to national attention regarding Hurricane Gustav, she appeared with First Lady Laura Bush to deliver short remarks encouraging support for hurricane relief efforts along the Gulf Coast, and on the last night, she introduced the seven McCain children and spoke about how her husband's love for his country had been passed on to them. [...] In October 2008, she increased the intensity of her public remarks against Obama's candidacy, speaking with surprising vitriol in accusing the Obama campaign of being the dirtiest in history and saying of his position against a war-funding bill, [...] "The day that Senator Obama cast a vote not to fund my son when he was serving sent a cold chill through my body." [...] The stresses of the campaign caused the [...] McCain's weight to fall under [...] [...] On November 4, 2008, she fought back tears in an appearance as <b>the</b> <b>McCain</b> <b>campaign</b> reached its final day and subsequent loss to Obama.|$|E
