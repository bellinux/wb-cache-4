5000|$|Flat plate {{collectors}} are {{an extension}} of the idea to place a collector in an 'oven'-like box with glass directly facing the Sun. Most flat plate collectors have two horizontal pipes at the top and bottom, called headers, and many smaller vertical pipes connecting them, called risers. The risers are welded (or similarly connected) to thin absorber fins. Heat-transfer fluid (water or water/antifreeze mix) is pumped from the hot water storage tank or heat exchanger into the collectors' bottom header, and it travels up the risers, collecting heat from the absorber fins, and then exits the collector out of the <b>top</b> <b>header.</b> Serpentine flat plate collectors differ slightly from this [...] "harp" [...] design, and instead use a single pipe that travels up and down the collector. However, since they cannot be properly drained of water, serpentine flat plate collectors cannot be used in drainback systems.|$|E
50|$|In September 2008, Fox Sports Net (FSN) {{affiliates}} {{introduced a}} new graphics package. The <b>top</b> <b>header</b> scoreboard was replaced with an updated one and a rectangular box in the top-left for hockey, football and baseball, and a score banner on the bottom for basketball. For the 2009 season, the Fox network's MLB telecasts began using the same graphics package. The network's NFL coverage returned to using a score box during the 2010 NFL season. For MLB and NFL broadcasts, the box has been moved into the far left corner, appearing to be outside of the typical 4:3 safe placement but the picture is letterboxed for 4:3 displays. They later expanded them for college football (similar to the NFL broadcasts but with their team abbreviations above their scores rather than team logos), NBA, NHL, and college basketball broadcasts (using a round score banner {{on the bottom of}} the screen). NASCAR (uses one on the top of the screen) but use the bug version of the previous graphics package.|$|E
50|$|On 20 June 2012, fVaslui {{announced}} that they had reached an agreement to sign Celeban on a free transfer from Śląsk Wrocław. He signed a four-year contract and was handed the number 5 shirt. On 4 July, he made his debut for Vaslui in a 9-1 win in a preseason friendly over Bischoffen. He made his Liga I debut for Vaslui on 22 July in a 2-2 draw with Rapid București. Despite playing as a right back in Vaslui's opening against Rapid, Celeban established himself in the central defence alongside Cape Verde international Fernando Varela. Celeban scored his first goal for Vaslui on 27 August in a 3-1 win against Steaua București. On 1 September, Celeban scored a late header against Viitorul Constanța, assisted by a cross from Dacian Varga. Celeban made it 2-2 which also was the final score. On 3 November, he scored a brace, bringing his tally to 4 goals in 10 league games, as Vaslui defeated Ceahlăul Piatra Neamț 4-3. On 1 April 2013, he scored another brace in a 3-2 win against Viitorul Constanța, which ended Vaslui's run of five games without a win. Celeban continued to impress and scored with a header his seventh league goal of the season against Dinamo București. He managed to finish as Vaslui's top goalscorer with 7 goals, alongside team captain Lucian Sânmărtean. He was also Liga I's top scorer defender and Liga I's <b>top</b> <b>header</b> scorer with 5 goals, alongside Takayuki Seto and Bojan Golubović.

40|$|In summary, a scaling {{analysis}} of a water-cooled Reactor Cavity Cooling System (RCCS) system was performed based on generic information on the RCCS design of PBMR. The analysis demonstrates that the water-cooled RCCS can be simulated at the ANL NSTF facility at a prototypic scale in the lateral direction and about half scale in the vertical direction. Because, by necessity, the scaling {{is based on a}} number of approximations, and because no analytical information is available on the performance of a reference water-cooled RCCS, the scaling analysis presented here needs to be 'validated' by {{analysis of}} the steady state and transient performance of a reference water-cooled RCCS design. The analysis of the RCCS performance by CFD and system codes presents a number of challenges including: strong 3 -D effects in the cavity and the RCCS tubes; simulation of turbulence in flows characterized by natural circulation, high Rayleigh numbers and low Reynolds numbers; validity of heat transfer correlations for system codes for heat transfer in the cavity and the annulus of the RCCS tubes; the potential of nucleate boiling in the tubes; water flashing in the upper section of the RCCS return line (during limiting transient); and two-phase flow phenomena in the water tanks. The limited simulation of heat transfer in cavities presented in Section 4. 0, strongly underscores the need of experimental work to validate CFD codes, and heat transfer correlations for system codes, and to support the analysis and design of the RCCS. Based on the conclusions of the scaling analysis, a schematic that illustrates key attributes of the experiment system is shown in Fig. 4. This system contains the same physical elements as the PBMR RCCS, plus additional equipment to facilitate data gathering to support code validation. In particular, the prototype consists of a series of oval standpipes surrounding the reactor vessel to provide cooling of the reactor cavity during both normal and off-normal operating conditions. The standpipes are headered (in groups of four in the prototype) to water supply (header) tanks that are situated well above the reactor vessel to facilitate natural convection cooling during a loss of forced flow event. During normal operations, the water is pumped from a heat sink located outside the containment to the headered inlets to the standpipes. The water is then delivered to each standpipe through a centrally located downcomer that passes the coolant to the bottom of each pipe. The water then turns 180 {sup o} and rises up through the annular gap while extracting heat from the reactor cavity due to a combination of natural convection and radiation across the gap between the reactor vessel and standpipes. The water exits the standpipes at the top where it is headered (again in groups of four) into a return line that passes the coolant to the <b>top</b> of the <b>header</b> tank. Coolant is drawn from each tank through a fitting located {{near the top of the}} tank where it flows to the heat rejection system located outside the containment. This completes the flow circuit for normal operations. During off-normal conditions, forced convection water cooling in the RCCS is presumed to be lost, as well as the ultimate heat sink outside the containment. In this case, water is passively drawn from an open line located at the bottom of the header tank. This line is orificed so that flow bypass during normal operations is small, yet the line is large enough to provide adequate flow during passive operations to remove decay heat while maintaining acceptable fuel temperatures. In the passive operating mode, water flows by natural convection from the bottom of the supply tank to the standpipes, and returns through the normal pathway to the top of the tanks. After the water reaches saturation and boiling commences, steam will pass through the top of the tanks and be vented to atmosphere. In the experiment system shown in Fig. 4, a steam condensation and collection system is included to quantify the boiling rate, thereby providing additional validation data. This system does not exist in the prototype. The first part of the report presents the non-dimensional conservation equations describing the response of the water-based RCCS during steady-state and transient operations. These equations are used to develop similarity relationships that define a scaling of the NSTF that minimizes distortions between scaled experiments and prototype operation. Then, some limited simulations of heat transfer in cavities are presented that strongly underscore the need of experimental work to validate CFD codes, and heat transfer correlations for system codes, and to support the analysis and design of the RCCS. Finally, a summary is provided of the NSTF modifications needed to conduct scaled simulations of the RCCS...|$|R
