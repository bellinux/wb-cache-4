In series seven, Rimmer departs the crew to take up the role of his alter ego from a parallel universe, Ace Rimmer, whose name has become a long-standing legend and a legacy passed down from dimension to dimension. Shortly afterwards, the crew encounters a parallel version of themselves from a universe in which Kristine Kochanski, Lister's long-term love interest, had been put into stasis {{at the time of the}} leak and so became the last remaining human. A complicated series of events leaves Kochanski stranded in the series' main universe, where she is forced to join the crew. At the end of series seven, we learn that Kryten's service nanobots, which had abandoned him years earlier, were behind the theft of the Red Dwarf at the end of series five.|$|E

40|$|In {{addition}} to the warehouse strategy and availability, the cycle times of the shelf storage and retrieval machines is a factor influencing the throughput of a high-bay warehouse. However, driving storage and retrieval machines can cause substantial mast vibration. This can have an adverse effect on stress, the positioning operation and warehouse cycle times. To increase capacity and reduce dynamic stress, it is therefore important {{to be able to}} drive storage and retrieval machines {{in such a way that}} unwanted vibrations can either be avoided or corrected. The studies relating to the <b>travel</b> <b>drive</b> control are based on the elastokinetic model of the two-mass oscillator. The dual-mass model simulates the vibration behaviour of the shelf storage and retrieval machine very closely and is ideal for examining the coefficient of oscillation which characterizes vibration. In {{addition to}} the initial mast vibration conditions, the given acceleration characteristic and the control unit used are the only other factors which can influence the coefficient of oscillation to be minimized. The results of a parameter study show that the current state-of-the-art cascade control is incapable of damping mast vibration. However, tests have shown that vibration behaviour can be improved considerably by using state control and fuzzy control. These active vibration damping measures make it possible to position the shelf storage and retrieval machine and simultaneously control vibration. Vibrations induced by changing rates of acceleration while the shelf storage and retrieval machine is traveling are correct immediately, thereby reducing dynamic stress. A comparison of the controls discussed shows that the state control best meets the existing requirements by virtue of its closed-loop control dynamics. (orig.)

40|$|Despite the {{significant}} amount of research conducted on the epidemiology of seasonal influenza, the patterns in the annual oscillations of influenza epidemics have not been fully described or understood. Furthermore, the current understanding of the intrinsic properties of influenza epidemics {{is limited by the}} geographic scales used to evaluate the data. Analyses conducted at larger spatial scales may potentially conceal local trends in disease structure which may reveal the effect of population structure or environmental factors on disease spread. By using influenza incidence data from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and United States influenza mortality data, this dissertation characterizes seasonal influenza epidemics, evaluates factors that drive local influenza epidemics, and provides an initial assessment in how administrative borders influence surveillance for local and regional influenza epidemics. Evidence of spatial heterogeneity existed in the distribution of influenza epidemics for Pennsylvania counties resulting in a cluster of elevated incidence in the South Central region of the state that persisted during the entire study period (2003 - 2009). Lower monthly precipitation levels during the influenza season (OR = 0. 52, p = 0. 0319), fewer residents over age 64 (OR = 0. 27, p = 0. 01) and fewer residents with more than a high school education (OR = 0. 76, p = 0. 0148) were significantly associated with membership in this cluster. In addition, significant synchrony in the timing of epidemics existed across the entire state and decayed with distance (regional correlation r = 62 %). Synchrony as a function of population size displayed evidence of hierarchical spread with more synchronized epidemics occurring among the most populated counties. A gravity model describing movement between two populations was the best predictor of influenza spread suggesting that non-routine and leisure <b>travel</b> <b>drive</b> local epidemics. Within the United States, clusters of epidemic synchronization existed, most notably in densely populated regions where connectivity is stronger. Observation of county and state epidemic clusters highlights the importance and necessity of correctly identifying the ontologic unit of epidemicity for influenza and other diseases. Recognition of the appropriate geographic unit to implement effective surveillance and prevention methods can strengthen the public health response and minimize inefficient mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|Laser {{power can}} be {{transformed}} into propulsive power to set into motion various kinds of vehicles and other objects on the surface, {{in the air and}} in space. The transformation process can occur indirectly, for instance by producing electricity via photovoltaic cells or thermal power. Another possibility is the generation of impulses by the ablation of matter from a solid body, or by the initiation of a high-pressure plasma breakdown wave in a fluid medium. Applications range from driving remotely powered roving vehicles to various kinds of thrusters for space propulsion. The direct thrust of the laser photon flux can be used for the propulsion of laser sailcrafts. Applications in space range from micropropulsion for satellite attitude control in the near-term to futuristic interstellar <b>travel</b> <b>driven</b> by photon propulsion.

50|$|With {{the end of}} {{hostilities}} with Japan {{and the increase in}} international air <b>travel</b> <b>driven</b> in part by wartime advances in aeronautics, Wake Island became a critical mid-Pacific base for the servicing and refueling of military and commercial aircraft. The United States Navy resumed control of the island and in October 1945, 400 Seabees from the 85th Naval Construction Battalion arrived at Wake to clear the island {{of the effects of the}} war and to build basic facilities for a Naval Air Base. The air base was completed in March 1946 and on September 24, 1946, regular commercial passenger service was resumed by Pan American Airways (Pan Am). The era of the flying boats was nearly over so Pan Am switched to longer range, faster and more profitable airplanes that could land on Wake's new coral runway. Other airlines that established transpacific routes through Wake included British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC), Philippine Airlines and Transocean Airlines. Due to the substantial increase in the number of commercial flights, on July 1, 1947, the Navy transferred administration, operations, and maintenance of the facilities at Wake to the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA). In 1949, the CAA upgraded the runway by paving over the coral surface and extending its length to 7,000 feet.|$|R

40|$|Previous {{papers in}} this series have {{presented}} a conceptual model of the individual decision to telecommute and explored relationships among constraints, preference, and choice. A related paper has developed a binary model of the preference for home-based telecom- muting. Noting {{that there is a}} wide gap between preferring to telecommute (88 % of the sample) and actually telecommuting (13 %), this paper develops binary logit models of role- commuting adoption. Two approaches to dealing with constraints are compared: incorporating them directly into the utility function, and using them to define the choice set. Models using the first approach appear to be statistically superior in this analysis, explaining 63 - 64 % of the information in the data. Variables significant to choice include those relating to work and <b>travel</b> <b>drives,</b> and awareness, manager support, job suitability, technology, and discipline constraints. The best model was used to analyze the impact of relaxing three key constraints on the 355 people in the sample for whom telecommuting was previously identified to be a Preferred Impossible Alternative. When unawareness, lack of manager support, and job unsuitability constraints are relaxed, 28 % {{of the people in the}} PIA category would be expected to adopt telecommuting. The importance of behavioral models to accurately forecasting telecommuting adoption is emphasized and is suggested to have wider implications for predicting technology-based activity changes...|$|R
