5|$|A 2009 study {{conducted}} by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration found that crashes involving pedestrians and bicyclists have higher incidence rates for hybrid electric vehicles than internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles in low-speed vehicle maneuvers such as reversing or leaving a parking zone. These accidents commonly occurred in zones with low speed limits, during daytime and in clear weather. <b>The</b> <b>study</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> a HEV was two {{times more likely to be}} involved in a pedestrian crash than was a conventional ICE vehicle when a vehicle is slowing or stopping, backing up, or entering or leaving a parking space. Vehicle maneuvers were grouped in one category considering those maneuvers that might have occurred at very low speeds where the difference between the sound levels produced by the hybrid versus ICE vehicle is the greatest. Also <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> the incidence rate of pedestrian crashes in scenarios when vehicles make a turn was significantly higher for HEVs when compared to ICE vehicles. Similarly, The NHTSA study also concluded that the incidence rate of bicyclist crashes involving HEVs for the same kind of maneuvers was significantly higher when compared to conventional vehicles.|$|E

40|$|Decentralization {{is often}} {{a major part of}} health reform policies. However, there have been few {{attempts}} to comparatively <b>study</b> <b>the</b> degree of decentralization and the effects of decentralization on equity of allocations to health, so {{we do not know how}} best to implement this reform. This article uses an innovative comparative analysis of the "decision space" that was allowed to local municipalities in the health reforms of Bolivia and Chile, two countries that have had several years of experience in implementing decentralization. <b>The</b> <b>studies</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> relatively little decision space was allowed to local authorities over key functions of health care systems. <b>The</b> <b>studies</b> also <b>found</b> <b>that</b> central authorities often reduce the decision space in order to direct more resources to health or to restrict local choice over human resources issues. <b>The</b> <b>studies</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> more equitable allocations of health funding were achieved through a common equalization fund for the municipalities in Chile and by forcing the assignment to health of a specific percentage of the central government transfers to municipalities in Bolivia...|$|R

5|$|A 2010 study {{compared}} mDNA {{sequences of}} modern wolves {{with those from}} 24 ancient wolf specimens from western Europe dated between 44,000 and 1,200 years before present (YBP). <b>The</b> <b>study</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> the sequences could be allocated into two haplogroups.

The ancient wolf samples from western Europe differed from modern wolves by 1 to 10 mutations, and all belonged to haplogroup2, indicating its predominance in this region for over 40,000 years, {{both before and after the}} Last Glacial Maximum. A comparison of current and past frequencies indicates that in Europe haplogroup2 became outnumbered by haplogroup1 over the past several thousand years, but in North America haplogroup2including the Beringian wolfbecame extinct and was replaced by haplogroup1 after the Last Glacial Maximum. However, a 2016 study did not support the existence of two wolf haplogroups.|$|E

5|$|In 2011, Ryan Schott {{and colleagues}} made a more {{comprehensive}} analysis of cranial dome ontogeny in S. validum. <b>The</b> <b>study</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> the parietosquamosal shelf conserved the arrangement of ornamentation throughout growth, and that vascularity of the frontoparietal domes decreased with size. It also found that dome shape and size was strongly correlated with growth, and that growth was allometric (in contrast to isometric) from flat to domed, supporting Ornatotholus as a juvenile Stegoceras. They also hypothesized that this model of dome growth, with dramatic changes from juvenile to adult, was the common developmental trajectory of pachycephalosaurs. These researchers noted that though Williamson and Carr's observation that the supratemporal fenestrae closed with age was generally correct, {{there was still a}} high degree of individual variation in the size of these fenestrae, regardless {{of the size of the}} frontoparietal, and this feature may therefore have been independent of ontogeny.|$|E

5|$|Linezolid was {{associated}} with significantly greater mortality than the comparator antibiotics. When data from all participants were pooled, <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> 21.5% of those given linezolid died, compared to 16% of those not receiving it. The difference {{was found to be}} due to the inferiority of linezolid in the treatment of Gram-negative infections alone or mixed Gram-negative/Gram-positive infections. In participants whose infection was due to Gram-positive bacteria alone, linezolid was as safe and effective as vancomycin. In light of these results, the FDA issued an alert reminding healthcare professionals that linezolid is not approved for the treatment of catheter-related infections or infections caused by Gram-negative organisms, and that more appropriate therapy should be instituted whenever a Gram-negative infection is confirmed or suspected.|$|E

The activity of proteases, on the other hand, disrupts platelet and muscle function and damages cell membranes, and thus contributes to a quick death for the prey animal. <b>The</b> <b>study</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> the venoms of Crotalus fell into two categories; those that favored metalloproteinases (Type I) and those that favored proteases (Type II). The study stated that these functions were essentially mutually exclusive; venoms had been selected for based on either their toxicity or their tenderizing potential.

Also, women working full-time were often more engaged with their children {{on a day-to-day basis}} than their male counterparts. His study concluded that in a family with a stay-at-home dad arrangement, the maternal and paternal influences are equally strong.

5|$|Taiwan's rapid {{economic}} growth during {{the latter half of}} the twentieth century led to saturation of highways, conventional rail, and air traffic systems in the western transport corridor, which threatened to impede further growth. The idea of a new high-speed rail line arose in the 1970s, and informal planning began in 1980. In 1987 the executive branch of Taiwan's government, the Executive Yuan, instructed the Ministry of Transportation to launch a feasibility study for a high-speed rail line in the western Taiwan corridor, which was completed in 1990. <b>The</b> <b>study</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> in a comparison of potential solutions to traffic problems in the corridor, a high-speed rail line would offer the highest transit volume, lowest land use, highest energy savings, and least pollution. In July 1990 the Preparation Office of High Speed Rail (POHSR) was established and a route was selected in 1991. Plans for the THSR were subsequently approved by the Executive Yuan in June 1992 and by Taiwan's legislature, the Legislative Yuan, in 1993.|$|E
