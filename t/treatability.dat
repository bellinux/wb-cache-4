From 1988 through 1992, numerous laboratory- and bench-scale indirect-heated thermal desorption (IHTD) <b>treatability</b> studies have been performed on various soil medium groups from the arsenal. RMA has contracted Argonne National Laboratory to conduct a pilot-scale direct-fired thermal desorption (DFTD) <b>treatability</b> study on pesticide-contaminated RMA soil.

The equipment used in the DFTD <b>treatability</b> study is of large enough scale to provide good full-scale design parameters and operating conditions.
