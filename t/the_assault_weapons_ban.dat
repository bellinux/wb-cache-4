The National Rifle Association and other gun groups (see gun politics) have criticized him for allegedly not knowing much about guns, alluding to various errors regarding the subject. Supporters of gun control legislation, however, give him {{much of the credit}} for passage of both <b>the</b> <b>Assault</b> <b>Weapons</b> <b>Ban</b> and the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act. <b>The</b> <b>Assault</b> <b>Weapons</b> <b>Ban,</b> which banned semi-automatic rifles, shotguns, and handguns with certain features, expired in September 2004 despite attempts by Schumer to extend it. He was one of 16 senators to vote against the Vitter Amendment, which prohibited the confiscation of legally owned firearms during a disaster.|$|E

50|$|The Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, {{enacted in}} 1994, {{included}} <b>the</b> Federal <b>Assault</b> <b>Weapons</b> <b>Ban,</b> {{and was a}} response to public concern over mass shootings. This provision prohibited the manufacture and importation of some semiautomatic firearms with certain features relevant to military use such as a folding stock, pistol grip, flash suppressor, and magazines holding more than ten rounds. A grandfather clause was included that allowed firearms manufactured before 1994 to remain legal. A short-term evaluation by University of Pennsylvania criminologists Christopher S. Koper and Jeffrey A. Roth did not find any clear impact of this legislation on gun violence. Given the short study time period of the evaluation, the National Academy of Sciences advised caution in drawing any conclusions.
