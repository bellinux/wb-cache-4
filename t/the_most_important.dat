40|$|The current {{research}} analysed {{the use of}} accentuation, pitch span, pitch minimum and maximum and duration in conveying sarcasm in different sentence types in British English. Sentence types that were included are simple declaratives, wh- exclamations, and sentences with negative question tags. Special {{attention was paid to}} <b>the</b> semantically <b>most</b> <b>important</b> word to <b>the</b> expression of sarcasm within an utterance. The results show that native speakers of British English do not use the absence or presence of accentuation on <b>the</b> semantically <b>most</b> <b>important</b> word to mark sarcasm. Moreover, the pitch span within <b>the</b> semantically <b>most</b> <b>important</b> word did not change if sarcasm was expressed. Interestingly, speakers lengthen <b>the</b> semantically <b>most</b> <b>important</b> word in sentences in order to convey sarcasm, and they employ a lower pitch minimum, and a lower pitch maximum in <b>the</b> semantically <b>most</b> <b>important</b> word. <b>The</b> discussed sentence types influence the placement of accentuation, duration, pitch minimum and pitch maximum of <b>the</b> semantically <b>most</b> <b>important</b> word in sentences, but no interaction effect with the use of sarcasm was found...|$|R
