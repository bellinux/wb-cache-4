5|$|According to Mifune, in 1904 Maeda lost to Yoshitake Yoshio by hane goshi, after {{defeating}} three adversaries in succession, but in {{a following}} tsukinami-shiai defeated eight adversaries {{in a row and}} was awarded the rank of 4th dan (yondan). Mifune also states that Maeda {{was one of the most}} vigorous promoters of judo, although not by teaching the art, instead generating recognition of judo through his many combats with contenders from other disciplines. Maeda treated experienced and inexperienced students alike, throwing <b>them</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> in real combat. He reasoned that this behavior was a measure of respect towards his students, but it was often misunderstood and frightened many youngsters, who would abandon him in favor of other professors.|$|E
5|$|In the Northern Territory, P. fimbriata has {{no special}} tactics against other jumping spiders {{and tries to}} treat <b>them</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they were web spiders, and then either tries to jump on them or gives up. Hence this variant is poor at {{catching}} other jumping spiders. The Northern Territory variant of P. fimbriata {{is not as good}} as the Queensland one as catching web spiders, but better than the Sri Lanka variant and some other species of Portia. It is not enthusiastic about pursuing insects, but very good at catching those it pursues, as the performance table above shows While pursuits by the Queensland variant typically take 26minutes, those of the Northern Territory variant typically take 3 to 5minutes, like some other species of Portia.|$|E

5|$|Thayer's {{original}} argument, restated by Cott, {{was that}} nature did {{the exact opposite}} with countershading that an artist did with paint when creating the illusion of solid three-dimensionality, namely counteracting the effect of shade to flatten out form. Shading is a powerful cue used by animals in different phyla to identify the shapes of objects. Research with chicks showed that they preferred to peck at grains with shadows falling below <b>them</b> (<b>as</b> <b>if</b> illuminated from above), so both humans and birds may make use of shading as a depth cue.|$|E

Furthermore, the Appeals Chamber noted that the relationship between the 3rd Corps and the El Mujahedin detachment was not one of subordination but was instead close to overt hostility since the only way to control the detachment was to attack <b>them</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they were a distinct enemy force.|$|E

25|$|Audubon {{developed}} his own methods for drawing birds. First, he killed them using fine shot. He then used wires to prop {{them into a}} natural position, unlike the common method of many ornithologists, who prepared and stuffed the specimens into a rigid pose. When working on a major specimen like an eagle, he would spend up to four 15-hour days, preparing, studying, and drawing it. His paintings of birds are set true-to-life in their natural habitat. He often portrayed <b>them</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> caught in motion, especially feeding or hunting. This was {{in stark contrast to}} the stiff representations of birds by his contemporaries, such as Alexander Wilson. Audubon based his paintings on his extensive field observations.|$|E

The scene's popularity helped the Popotan franchise and Caramell attain a cult following. The dance is performed by individuals (especially in Japan) at anime conventions, and in advertising, video games and other unrelated anime. The popularity of Popotan in Japan brought Momoi Haruko and her band Under17 to prominence.|$|E

[...] The house was filled with stories of ghosts and premonitions, omens and portents, all of which were studiously ignored by her husband. According to García Márquez she was [...] "the source of the magical, superstitious and supernatural view of reality". He enjoyed his grandmother's unique way of telling stories. No matter how fantastic or improbable her statements, she always delivered <b>them</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they were the irrefutable truth.

It was equipped with a mechanical digger for shared use by both Treblinka I and II. Eupen worked closely with the SS and German police commanders in Warsaw during the deportation of Jews in early 1943 and had prisoners brought to him from the Warsaw Ghetto for the necessary replacements. According to Franciszek Ząbecki, the local station master, Eupen often killed prisoners by [...] "taking shots at <b>them,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they were partridges".

He asserted that Castro [...] "always had a keen sense of humor and could laugh at himself" [...] but could equally be [...] "a bad loser" [...] who would act with [...] "ferocious rage if he thought that he was being humiliated". Castro was well known for throwing tantrums, and could make [...] "snap judgements" [...] which he refused to back down from. Biographer Peter Bourne noted that Castro [...] "suffers fools poorly" [...] and that in his younger years he was intolerant of those who did not share his views. He claimed that Castro liked to meet with ordinary citizens, both in Cuba and abroad, but took a particularly paternal attitude toward Cubans, treating <b>them</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> [...] "they were a part of his own giant family". British historian Alex Von Tunzelmann commented that [...] "though ruthless, [...] was a patriot, a man with a profound sense that it was his mission to save the Cuban people". Balfour described Castro as having a [...] "voracity for knowledge" [...] an [...] "elephantine memory" [...] that allowed him to speak for hours on a variety of different subjects.|$|E
500|$|The {{two main}} writers, Brenton and Wolstencroft, had {{different}} styles and influences in their scripts. Wolstencroft {{was influenced by}} American television to make the episodes pacier. His chosen writing style {{was a mixture of}} the [...] "grittyness" [...] of le Carré's works and James Bond-like fantasies. While writing the series, the writer introduced a set of [...] "MI5 terminology", terms used by the main characters in the series. According to Oyelowo, Wolstencroft's scripts included more spy terms, stating [...] "we curse David Wolstencroft often. His dialogue tends to be the most chewy," [...] and the actors had to learn <b>them</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they spoke as such on a daily basis. Brenton, meanwhile, adopted the same writing style based on early episodes of Taggart, a Scottish-based crime drama; the writer was impressed by the show's ability to add more to the plot halfway through. He also took inspirations from novels including le Carré's Tinker, Tailor, soldier, Spy. Mirren wrote [...] "One Last Dance", which he felt was difficult to write as he had to tie two main storylines together. Brenton and Wolstencroft collaborated to write [...] "Lesser of Two Evils" [...] due to timing constraints. Wolstencroft pitched the story, and then each writer wrote 30 pages of dialogue.|$|E
500|$|After Pitman's capture, he was {{marched to}} Richmond {{in a weak}} {{physical}} state. He was imprisoned in the Confederate Libby Prison and Belle Isle, which were notoriously harsh prisons. Pitman's letters home described his place of incarceration as the [...] "Pen" [...] where [...] "the filthy meat [...] thrown to <b>them</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they were dogs". The condition of his incarceration including the shortage of food, lack of sanitation, overcrowding and his physical weakness made him susceptible to virulent diseases present in the Confederate prisons. Carter described how the prisons [...] "wore out the brave spirit". During a prisoner exchange, Pitman was released by the Confederate Army at City Point, Virginia, on December12, 1862, and then sent to Camp Parole, Annapolis. Suffering from complications due to the conditions of his imprisonment, he contracted [...] "lung fever", which was perhaps pneumonia. Carter wrote later how his friend had [...] "linger feebly a few weeks, like the flickering of an expiring flame, then quietly pass away to an eternal life". Pitman died at Camp Parole on February27, 1863, just weeks short of his eighteenth birthday. According to historians Anita Manning and Justin Vance, Pitman [...] "has the unfortunate {{distinction of being the}} only known Hawaiian or Pacific Islander to die as a prisoner of war in the Civil War".|$|E
