5|$|An early 1970s Spider-Man story {{led to the}} {{revision}} of <b>the</b> <b>Comics</b> Code. Previously, the Code forbade the depiction {{of the use of}} illegal drugs, even negatively. However, in 1970, the Nixon administration's Department of Health, Education, and Welfare asked Stan Lee to publish an anti-drug message in one of Marvel's top-selling titles. Lee chose the top-selling The Amazing Spider-Man; issues #96–98 (May–July 1971) feature a story arc depicting the negative effects of drug use. In the story, Peter Parker's friend Harry Osborn becomes addicted to pills. When Spider-Man fights the Green Goblin (Norman Osborn, Harry's father), Spider-Man defeats the Green Goblin, by revealing Harry's drug addiction. While the story had a clear anti-drug message, <b>the</b> <b>Comics</b> Code Authority refused to issue its seal of approval. Marvel nevertheless published the three issues without <b>the</b> <b>Comics</b> Code Authority's approval or seal. The issues sold so well that the industry's self-censorship was undercut and the Code was subsequently revised.|$|E

5|$|By 1954, <b>the</b> <b>Comics</b> Code Authority {{had been}} {{established}} in response to increasing public disapproval of comic book content. The backlash was inspired by Frederic Wertham, who hypothesized that mass media (especially comic books) {{was responsible for the}} rise in juvenile delinquency, violence and homosexuality, particularly in young males. Parents forbade their children from reading comic books, and there were several mass burnings. <b>The</b> <b>Comics</b> Code banned gore, innuendo and excessive violence, stripping Batman of his menace and transforming the Joker into a goofy, thieving trickster without his original homicidal tendencies.|$|E

5|$|Spanning World War II, when American comics {{provided}} {{cheap and}} disposable escapist entertainment {{that could be}} read and then discarded by the troops, the Golden Age of comic books covered the late 1930s to the late 1940s. A number of major superheroes were created during this period, including Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Captain Marvel, and Captain America. In subsequent years comics were blamed for a rise in juvenile crime statistics, although this rise was shown to be {{in direct proportion to}} population growth. When juvenile offenders admitted to reading comics, it was seized on as a common denominator; one notable critic was Fredric Wertham, author of the book Seduction of the Innocent (1954), who attempted to shift the blame for juvenile delinquency from the parents of the children to the comic books they read. The result was a decline in <b>the</b> <b>comics</b> industry. To address public concerns, in 1954 <b>the</b> <b>Comics</b> Code Authority was created to regulate and curb violence in comics, marking {{the start of a new}} era.|$|E
5|$|Spider-Man {{has had a}} large {{range of}} {{supporting}} characters introduced in <b>the</b> <b>comics</b> that are essential in the issues and storylines that star him.

5|$|The comic book's {{popularity}} with women {{has also been}} attributed to the strong female characters featured in the comic, such as Scarlett and Lady Jaye. Since {{very few of the}} G.I.
