50|$|Microfibers {{are used}} in <b>towels</b> {{especially}} those <b>to</b> be used at swimming pools as even a small towel dries the body quickly.

Some bathhouses permit and others not only permit but encourage total nudity. In some bathhouses nudity is forbidden in the common areas of the establishments. Some men may wear underwear or fetish-wear, but it is unusual for customers to remain fully or even partially dressed in street clothes. Bare feet are customary, though some men prefer to wear flip flops or sandals, sometimes provided by the establishment, for foot protection. The room or locker key is usually suspended from an elastic band which can be worn around the wrist or ankle.|$|E

500|$|Upon its invention, Cope {{commented on}} the multi-functional ability of The Terrible Towel, [...] "I'll tell 'em they can use the <b>towel</b> <b>to</b> wipe their seats clean.

5000|$|A sports towel, or (synthetic) chamois, is a towel {{originally}} developed for swimmers and divers, favored for its super-absorbent qualities. Sports towels can be wrung out when saturated, leaving the <b>towel</b> able <b>to</b> absorb water again, although not dry. Those qualities, {{along with their}} compact nature, have further popularized sports towels amongst general outdoor and athletic enthusiasts. The absorbent material in sports towels may be composed of viscose, PVA or microfiber, with polyester woven in for durability. Some manufacturers incorporate a silver ion or compound treatment into their <b>towels</b> <b>to</b> better inhibit microbial growth and associated odors.|$|R
500|$|In {{the weeks}} leading up to the game, Cope advertised the idea of the <b>towel</b> <b>to</b> fans on the radio and evening {{television}} news, using the phrase [...] "The Terrible Towel is poised to strike!" [...] However, Atkins grew nervous that fans would think the towel was a jinx if the Steelers lost the game. Cope agreed to poll players on their view of the towel. Linebacker Jack Ham told Cope, [...] "I think your idea stinks"; Ernie [...] "Fats" [...] Holmes was also against the idea. Also against the idea of the Towel was Andy Russell, who mirrored Cope's original thoughts, [...] "We're not a gimmick team. We've never been a gimmick team." [...] Cope simply replied, [...] "Russell, you're sick." [...] Growing nervous about the negative feedback, Cope, who had already advertised the towel on the news multiple times, polled the rest of the players with a [...] "banana-republic vote".|$|E
500|$|O'Hara began 1941 by {{appearing}} in They Met in Argentina, RKO's answer to Down Argentine Way (1940). O'Hara later declared that she [...] "knew {{it was going}} to be a stinker; terrible script, bad director, preposterous plot, forgettable music". She grew increasingly frustrated with the direction of her career at this time. Ida Zeitlin wrote that O'Hara had [...] "reached a pitch of despair where she was about ready to throw in the <b>towel,</b> <b>to</b> break her contract, to collapse against the stone wall of indifference and howl like a baby wolf". She pleaded with her agent for a role, however small, in John Ford's upcoming film How Green Was My Valley (1941), at 20th Century Fox, a film about a close, hard-working Welsh mining family living in the heart of the South Wales Valleys in the 19th century. The film, which won the Academy Award for Best Picture, began an artistic collaboration with Ford that would span 20 years and five feature films.|$|E
500|$|The drug {{addiction}} of Towelie, {{a living and}} talking towel, is growing so overwhelming that the South Park boys make attempts to help him. Towelie's history is shown, using head interviews and on-screen captions (in a parody of Intervention), starting with years of {{drug addiction}} to cannabis, crystal meth, heroin and crack. He previously had a girlfriend named Rebecca and conceived a child with her (a washcloth), but he {{was kicked out of}} their home due to his persistently getting high. Having run out of money for hard drugs, Towelie starts getting high off of cans of computer duster. His life continued in a downward spiral, leaving him in heavy debt and offering oral sex to strangers for money in the alleys. The boys help him get a job at Lake Tardicaca, a summer camp for kids with physical and mental disabilities, as a <b>towel</b> <b>to</b> dry off the campers. However, Towelie persists in drug use and fellating strangers in the supply closet, and is fired by the camp. The boys confront Towelie and make emotional speeches to him as a plea to help him from killing himself (except for Cartman, who uses this opportunity to read what appears to be several tens of thousands of pages of anti-Semitic remarks on television, which the psychiatrist allows to continue in respect of the [...] "no interruptions" [...] rule). Towelie refuses their pleas until Butters reveals he has brought Towelie's child, [...] "Washcloth", which finally prompts him to accept the offer to go to a rehabilitation clinic in Southern California. Later, Towelie reveals he has completed rehab and is now living with his girlfriend and son.|$|E

2500|$|In addition, {{the corner}} is {{responsible}} for stopping the fight if they feel their fighter is in grave danger of permanent injury. The corner will occasionally throw in a white <b>towel</b> <b>to</b> signify a boxer's surrender (the idiomatic phrase [...] "to throw in the towel", meaning to give up, derives from this practice). This {{can be seen in}} the fight between Diego Corrales and Floyd Mayweather. In that fight, Corrales' corner surrendered despite Corrales' steadfast refusal.|$|E
2500|$|At the 1997 BRIT Awards the Spice Girls were {{scheduled}} to perform, {{as well as being}} nominated for five awards, two of which they won. The black Gucci mini dress which Halliwell was given to perform in concerned her, as she thought it was too [...] "boring". Then Halliwell decided she wanted to [...] "celebrate being British", so she asked her sister to stitch on a Union Jack tea <b>towel</b> <b>to</b> the front as a patriotic gesture. After Karen, her sister, had sewn on the tea towel, Geri decided to wear it whilst performing [...] "Who Do You Think You Are" [...] (with excerpts of [...] "Wannabe" [...] in) at the BRIT Awards on 24 February 1997.|$|E
2500|$|The fight {{took place}} on July 4, 1910, in front of 20,000 people, at a ring built just for the {{occasion}} in downtown Reno, Nevada. Jeffries proved unable to impose his will on the younger champion and Johnson dominated the fight. By the 15th round, after Jeffries had been knocked down twice {{for the first time}} in his career, Jeffries' corner threw in the <b>towel</b> <b>to</b> end the fight and prevent Jeffries from having a knockout on his record. Johnson later remarked he knew the fight was over in the 4th round when he landed an uppercut and saw the look on Jeffries face, stating, [...] "I knew what that look meant. The old ship was sinking." [...] Afterwards, Jeffries was humbled by the loss and what he'd seen of Johnson in their match. [...] "I could never have whipped Johnson at my best", Jeffries said. [...] "I couldn't have hit him. No, I couldn't have reached him in 1,000 years." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Terrible Towel is {{traditionally}} {{known as the}} first [...] "rally towel"; its popularity has spawned similar traditions for other teams. Fans of the Minnesota Twins cheer {{the team with the}} [...] "Homer Hanky" [...] during the playoffs. The Philadelphia Phillies have distributed white <b>towels</b> <b>to</b> fans during home games. During a 2006 playoff game against the Steelers, the Indianapolis Colts handed out blue <b>towels</b> <b>to</b> rally fans, however, Pittsburgh {{went on to win the}} game. In a 2000 preseason game, played in Mexico City, many fans that filled the 100,000 seat Aztec Stadium waved towels. Cope, glad that the Allegheny Valley School would receive a sizable donation from the proceeds, was later disappointed <b>to</b> learn the <b>towels</b> waved by the fans were [...] "knockoffs" [...] made by local artists, and therefore no proceeds would go to the school. In 2008, the NFL approved a white towel entitled the Trophy Towel, which will be sold to fans and given to the winning team of Super Bowl XLIII. Members of the Steelers criticized the idea, broadcaster Bill Hillgrove—who worked with Cope—called the idea [...] "a cheap imitation." [...] Steelers player Aaron Smith stated, [...] "It started here, so why would anyone else want <b>to</b> have a <b>towel?</b> Why not kazoos?" [...] During the 2010 Memorial Cup the host committee made up 8,000 yellow <b>towels</b> <b>to</b> represent the host team, the Brandon Wheat Kings, who played the Moncton Wildcats. Many fans brought the towels back for games after that.|$|R
5|$|The term {{greenwashing}} {{was first}} used by environmentalist Jay Westerveld when objecting to hotelier's practice of placing notices in hotel rooms which asked their guests <b>to</b> reuse <b>towels</b> <b>to</b> “save the environment”. Westerveld noted {{that there was little}} else to suggest that the hoteliers were interested in reducing their environmental impacts, and that their interest in washing fewer <b>towels</b> seemed <b>to</b> be motivated by a concern to save costs rather than the environment. Since then greenwashing has become a central feature of debates about marketing communications and sustainability, with “awards” for greenwashing established and numerous campaigns, law and advices developed in an attempt to reduce or curb it.|$|R
