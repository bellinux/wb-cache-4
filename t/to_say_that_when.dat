5|$|The Clausius–Clapeyron {{relation}} {{leads to}} another equation also attributed to Kelvin, as the Kelvin equation. It explains why, because of surface tension, the vapor pressure for small droplets of liquid in suspension {{is greater than}} standard vapor pressure of that same liquid when the interface is flat. That is <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> a liquid is forming small droplets, the equilibrium concentration of its vapor in its surroundings is greater. This arises because the pressure inside the droplet is greater than outside.|$|E

[...] Cori Murray, an entertainment director at Essence magazine, described the track as [...] "not bad," [...] and felt that it sounded [...] "like something" [...] Jackson [...] "could have put on an album." [...] Dan Aquilante, of the New York Post, who described the song as [...] "an optimistic, R ballad with an upbeat, percolating rhythm that has all the bombast {{and power of the}} New Jack Swing period of the early '90s." [...] James Montgomery, of MTV News, felt that the song was the [...] "perfect MJ tune" [...] and that Jackson [...] "was a hell of a singer." [...] He also stated that he felt that Jackson had a [...] "wonderous voice," [...] and the song [...] "a prime showcase for Jackson's prodigious pipes."

2500|$|It {{set out the}} {{position}} that while homosexual orientation is not in itself a sin, it is nevertheless a tendency towards the [...] "moral evil" [...] of homosexual sexual activity, and so must be considered [...] "an objective disorder". The letter went on <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> homosexual activity {{is the result of}} deliberate choice, it is not made inculpable by natural sexual orientation, contradicting the idea that natural orientation always rendered it totally inculpable. Dempsey has suggested that the orientation diminishes a person's culpability in proportion to the force of the psychological impulse for the immoral activity. Furthermore, the letter argues that this natural homosexual orientation is [...] "essentially self-indulgent" [...] since homosexual sexual acts are not genuinely loving or selfless.|$|E

60|$|When, given A, it is {{possible}} to infer B, but given B, {{it is not possible to}} infer A, we <b>say</b> <b>that</b> B is dependent upon A in a sense in which A is not dependent upon B. Stated in logical terms, this amounts <b>to</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that,</b> <b>when</b> we know a many-one relation of A to B, B is dependent upon A in respect of this relation. If the relation is a causal law, we <b>say</b> <b>that</b> B is causally dependent upon A. The illustration that chiefly concerns us is the system of appearances of a physical object. We can, broadly speaking, infer distant appearances from near ones, but not vice versa. All men look alike when they are a mile away, hence when we see a man a mile off we cannot tell what he will look like when he is only a yard away. But when we see him a yard away, we can tell what he will look like a mile away. Thus the nearer view gives us more valuable information, and the distant view is causally dependent upon it in a sense in which it is not causally dependent upon the distant view.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the middle}} of the {{controversy}} about Lindner’s remarks his lawyer sent a routine legal request for discovery to Rep. Neva Walker, an African-American DFL member from Minneapolis. The letter was addressed to her as “Walker-Black”. Walker had never been married, didn’t use a hyphenated name, and had never had the last name Black. It appeared as if someone forgot to remove the race notation before signing and sending out that letter. James Anderson, Lindner's lawyer, apologized to Walker saying it was a [...] "simple mistake. [...] I {{can tell you that the}} person typing the letter apparently looked at the file and put the words together wrong [...]” Walker said [...] "I do believe it was an accident and somebody forgot to erase it. ...I am an elected official and I deserve respect, and that misprint is a lack of respect." [...] The lawyer said [...] "Basically, it's a tempest in a teapot," [...] he said, adding that [...] "some people are just hypersensitive if from a simple mistake they can call someone a racist." [...] Walker responded, [...] "It's easy <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> you're not on the receiving of a racist comment, but racist attacks are emotionally and mentally draining. And I am far from sensitive. It takes a lot to offend me. ...Folks who are so focused on this issue don't realize that there is a pattern with this particular representative." ...|$|E
2500|$|Huxley always {{believed}} that on a broad view evolution led to advances in organisation. Progress without a goal {{was one of his}} phrases, to distinguish his point of view from classical Aristotelian teleology. [...] "The ordinary man, or at least the ordinary poet, philosopher and theologian, always was anxious to find purpose in the evolutionary process. I believe this reasoning to be totally false."The idea of evolutionary progress was subjected to some fierce criticism {{in the latter part of}} the twentieth century. Cladists, for example, were (and are) strongly against any suggestion that a group could be scientifically described as 'advanced' and others as 'primitive.' For them, and especially for the radical group of transformed cladists, there is no such thing as an advanced group, they are derived or apomorphic. Primitive groups are plesiomorphic. Ironically, it was Huxley who invented the terms clade and grades. However, to take a rather extreme case, it would seem strange <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> man is compared to bacteria, that mankind is not a vastly more complex and advanced form of life; or that the invasion of the land by plants and animals was not a great advance in the history of life on this planet. On this issue Julian was at the opposite end of the spectrum from his grandfather, who was, at least for the first half of his career, a propagandist for 'persistent types', getting close to denying any advances at all.|$|E
2500|$|Historian Leonard Arrington {{attributes}} {{the stories of}} Danites in Utah to overzealous descriptions of the [...] "Minute Men," [...] a law enforcement organization created by Brigham Young to pursue marauding Indians and white criminals. [...] Arthur Conan Doyle and other authors had also popularized the idea of blood-thirsty Danites riding rough-shod through Utah in various fictional works. [...] At the same time, there is evidence that, purportedly in order to deter and punish crime in Utah Territory, Brigham Young occasionally authorized local church leaders to engage in vigilante actions on an ad hoc basis. For instance, in early 1857, Young ordered local authorities to monitor two recently released convicts {{who were on the}} trail to California. If they were caught stealing livestock along the way, he authorized their summary execution. Historian Ardis Parshall believes that this led to an attack on an unrelated party which wounded several individuals in a case of mistaken identity. Indeed, in the same sermon where he spoke of the Danites and Vigilance Committees in 1857, Young also stated: [...] "There have been men here who have had their plans to arrange for robbing; and I will take the liberty <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that,</b> <b>when</b> we find them, 'judgement will be laid to the line and righteousness to the plummet.' [...] Those are my feelings, and I express them plainly, that the good and honest may be able to pass from the Eastern States to California, and back and forth, in [...] peace...I want the people in the States to know that there are a few poor curses here, and to know that we do not want gangs of highwaymen here.
