5|$|From the first, {{research}} into the Super was directed by Teller, who was its most enthusiastic proponent. Although this work was always considered secondary to the objective of developing a fission bomb, the prospect of creating more powerful bombs was sufficient <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> <b>going.</b> The Berkeley summer conference had convinced Teller that the Super was technologically feasible. An important contribution was made by Emil Konopinski, who suggested that deuterium could more easily be ignited if it was mixed with tritium. Bethe noted that a tritium-deuterium (T-D) reaction releases {{five times as much}} energy as a deuterium-deuterium (D-D) reaction. This was not immediately followed up, because tritium was hard to obtain, and there were hopes that deuterium could be easily ignited by a fission bomb, but the cross sections of T-D and D-D were measured by Manley's group in Chicago and Holloway's at Purdue.|$|E

25|$|However, {{from the}} many {{thousands}} of papyri excavated from Oxyrhynchus, only about 10% were literary. The rest consisted {{of public and private}} documents: codes, edicts, registers, official correspondence, census-returns, tax-assessments, petitions, court-records, sales, leases, wills, bills, accounts, inventories, horoscopes, and private letters. Still, Grenfell and Hunt found enough texts of more general interest to keep them going in the hope of finding more. In their first year of digging alone, they found parts of several lost plays of Sophocles, such as the Ichneutae and many other books and fragments, including parts of what appeared to be an unknown Christian gospel. These discoveries captured the public imagination, and Grenfell and Hunt sent articles and photos to newspapers in Britain, arguing the importance of their work and seeking donations <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> <b>going.</b>|$|E

500|$|PedroII's trips abroad made a deep {{psychological}} impact. While traveling, he {{was largely}} freed {{of the restrictions}} imposed by his office. Under the pseudonym [...] "Pedro de Alcântara", he enjoyed moving about as an ordinary person, even taking a train journey solely with his wife. Only while touring abroad could the Emperor shake off the formal existence and demands of the life he knew in Brazil. It became more difficult to reacclimate to his routine as head of state upon returning. Upon his sons' early deaths, the Emperor's faith in the monarchy's future had evaporated. His trips abroad now made him resentful of the burden destiny had placed upon his shoulders when only a child of five.

500|$|Hutton rarely captained Yorkshire, {{except in}} the absence of the {{official}} captain, through a combination of poor health, frequent absences with England and the presence of the amateur Norman Yardley in the side. Yardley claimed several times that he would have stood down in Hutton's favour, but the committee remained distrustful of professional captaincy and thought Hutton a hypochondriac who used his health as an excuse not to play. Hutton was a reserved man for whom the Yorkshire dressing room clashes of the 1950s held little appeal. As the side's senior professional, he did not always provide the guidance which younger players in the side were seeking. The team was divided and the players frequently clashed with each other; some critics believe this was a factor in the county's failure to win the County Championship in the 1950s. Ray Illingworth, a player at the time, believes that Hutton was the only man who could have changed the negative attitude around the team, but [...] "he didn't do anything about it". Illingworth recalled that he was a [...] "distant hero", saying: [...] "He was a funny man was Len—slightly sarcastic all the time. He'd hear an argument in the dressing room and he'd throw a bit of wood on the fire <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> <b>going.</b> He looked after himself, he was very much of a loner." ...|$|E

2500|$|By {{the late}} 20th century, {{population}} shifts and declining church attendance meant {{the provision of}} Anglican churches in Hastings was excessive.

In effect, the fire is [...] "off the ground", and burns its way down through its course. And secondly, this fire type requires minimal labor, thereby making it ideal as a fire of choice before bedding down for the evening without having to get up periodically to add fuel wood and/or stoke the fire <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> <b>going.</b> Start by adding the largest fuel wood in a parallel [...] "layer", then continue to add increasingly smaller and smaller fuel wood layers perpendicularly to the last layer.

2500|$|In 1974 Charles Clive-Ponsonby-Fane {{reclaimed}} his {{ancestral home}} and moved {{with his new}} wife back into Brympton d'Evercy {{with the intention of}} restoring it and opening it to the public as a stately home. His problem was that, while the empty and neglected house may have been his home, it was far from stately. While the house was structurally in a fair condition, it had not been redecorated since the 18th century and had endured the obvious ravages caused by its use as a boys' school. The redecoration of the state rooms was executed on a very restricted budget. The principal problem facing the owners was furnishing the house. Few of its former contents remained, and while Brympton d'Evercy is not on a par with Blenheim Palace in size, it still required large items and quantities of high quality antique furniture. This was the stumbling block to the stately home scheme. The Clive-Ponsonby-Fanes made great efforts to draw in the crowds, an agricultural museum, a vineyard, a distillery of apple brandy, but none of this was interesting enough to attract visitors from as far afield as London, let alone those from across the Atlantic. Ultimately, as a financial enterprise, opening to the public failed. In 1992 after almost 300 years of ownership the family sold Brympton d'Evercy. The situation was summed up at the time by the satirist Auberon Waugh: [...] "Last week we learnt that the most beautiful house in Somerset has been sold.....it is sad of course for the family who owned it who had made a valiant effort <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> <b>going</b> [...].it did not succeed as a showpiece: they had run out of money, the internal decorations were dreadful, and they lacked the proper kit {{to make it look like}} anything more than a prep school on open day.
