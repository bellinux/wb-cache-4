Each of those has been evaluated according to the degree of accomplishment of the criterion (from 1 to 5), and an overall DQR of the datasets has been calculated by summing up the achieved quality rating for each of the quality criteria indicator, divided {{by the total number of}} considered indicators, as described in Garraín et al.

30|$|In {{order to}} be {{compliant}} with ISO 14044, section 4.2. 3.6 (ISO 2006 a, b), LCI datasets must include a data quality description of its time-related, geographic and <b>technological</b> <b>representativeness</b> {{as well as of the}} precision, completeness, consistency and uncertainty of the information. Under this framework, some guidelines have been developed to address the DQRs. For instance, in the ILCD Handbook (European Commission JRC and Sustainability 2010 c), data quality scores rank the datasets based on six indicators (<b>technological</b> <b>representativeness,</b> geographical representativeness, time-related representativeness, completeness, precision/uncertainty, and methodological appropriateness and consistency) with data quality scores of 1 to 5 (high to low) assigned to each.|$|R
30|$|Although LCA-based methodologies {{and tools}} seem to develop fast, the {{availability}} of quality-assured LCA data still represents a major bottleneck to a broader use of LCA and environmental footprint methods in business and in policy (Fazio et al. 2015). Under the framework of ISO standards (ISO 2006) some guidelines {{have been developed to}} address the Data Quality Requirements: i) ILCD handbook (EC-JRC 2010 a) considers six indicators regarding <b>technological</b> <b>representativeness,</b> geographical representativeness, time-related representativeness, completeness, precision/uncertainty, and methodological appropriateness and consistency, ii) UNEP/SETAC life cycle initiative (UNEP 2011) also include reproducibility, representativeness, and information on data sources, iii) USLCI Database (2012) Project Development Guidelines describes the data quality basing on data age, source and collection method; data representativeness; averaging methods; methods used to estimate or justify data gaps; and information about key assumptions or methodological choices, and iv) Ecoinvent ([URL] proposes a specific Data Quality rating, named pedigree matrix, where include aspects such as geographical, technological and temporal validity, the origin, representativeness and validation of the data, and administrative information (Fazio et al. 2015).|$|R

40|$|The European Reference Life-Cycle Database (ELCD) {{has been}} {{developed}} by the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre (DG JRC) and provides core Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) data from front-running EU-level business associations and, where not available, other sources. Within the ELCD, several energy-related data are provided, being energy a major input for almost all the environmental analyses of products or processes. The present document summarises {{an analysis of the}} quality of energy data for European markets that are available in 3 rd party life cycle databases and from authoritative sources that are, or could be, used {{in the context of the}} ELCD. This work {{has been developed}} by a joint project with the cooperation of the EC JRC and the Energy Systems Analysis (ASE) Unit of CIEMAT (Public Research Centre for Energy, Environment and Technology) (Madrid, Spain). The work consisted of an analysis and a comparison of energy datasets from different databases, considering the ELCD database as the basis for this analysis. The current ELCD energy datasets have been to large extent originated from the GaBi database ([URL] Therefore, in order to analyse background information of the ELCD datasets, GaBi datasets from the last updated version (at the time when the study was initiated, i. e. 2009) have been analysed. The other databases that have been analysed are the following: 	Ecoinvent database([URL] 	E 3 database ([URL] 	GEMIS database ([URL] The main criteria for the database selection were based on the availability of EU-related data, the inclusion of wide datasets on energy products and services (specially focusing on those matching the chosen energy patterns), and the broad approval by the scientific community. Up to 24 energy datasets were selected for the analysis with the criteria of selecting a sufficiently representative sample of energy sources in the European context. The evaluation has been based on the quality indicators developed within the ILCD handbook (EC-JRC-IES 2010 a, 2010 b, 2011) : <b>Technological</b> <b>representativeness,</b> Geographical representativeness, Time-related representativeness, Completeness, Precision / Uncertainty, and Methodological appropriateness and consistency. They have been redefined in order to identify key aspects that are involved in both quality and methodological aspects of energy related LCI datasets. This practice facilitates their use in the analysis of energy systems. The quality of each dataset has been estimated for each indicator and then, compared among the different databases. Even though the final results are discussed based on “qualitative” results for each indicator, the individual indicator component and the total DQR have been calculated as a tool for further dataset improvements. Results have shown that, in general terms the ELCD dataset analysed showed a very good performance in many of the criteria and especially in those criteria related to technology representativeness, methodology and Completeness. Several aspects where improvements are considered necessary are highlighted through the analysis. Sources of data and information coming from Authoritative sources not considered, business associations or other sources are identified and proposed to be used. JRC.
