5|$|The player {{character}} is a prisoner being led to an Imperial execution in Helgen. Alduin unexpectedly interrupts the procession, destroying the town before the player can be executed. The player escapes in the chaos and journeys {{to the city of}} Whiterun to request aid against the dragon threat. After slaying a different dragon that attacks nearby, the player absorbs the dragon's soul which grants them the ability to perform a shout. The city's guards inform the player <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> Dragonborn. The player is summoned to meet with the Greybeards, an order of monks who live in seclusion. The Greybeards train the player in using shouts and inform the player of their role in stopping Alduin. The player learns that Skyrim's civil war is the last in a sequence of prophetic events foretold by the Elder Scrolls, which also predicted the return of Alduin.|$|E
25|$|Simons {{proclaimed the}} Germans {{to be the}} real militarists and {{declared}} <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> stopped before they enslaved the world.|$|E
25|$|In Ethiopic (where {{the term}} abugida originates) the {{diacritics}} have been fused to the consonants {{to the point}} <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> considered modifications of {{the form of the}} letters. Children learn each modification separately, as in a syllabary; nonetheless, the graphic similarities between syllables with the same consonant is readily apparent, unlike the case in a true syllabary.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sounds like grouse," [...] {{answered}} Dave. [...] "They drum like <b>that</b> sometimes. <b>They</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> over in {{the trees}} yonder. Let us dismount and see." ...|$|R
6000|$|Next, [...] "there are {{occasional}} lines, {{and even}} stanzas, which jar in style {{to such a}} degree <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>must</b> have <b>been</b> written by two separate hands." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>That</b> <b>they</b> <b>must</b> not <b>be</b> adopted; {{for when}} adopted persons died without issue, the estates they {{received}} by adoption {{returned to the}} relations {{of the men who}} adopted them.|$|R
25|$|Adventism is a Christian eschatological {{belief that}} {{looks for the}} {{imminent}} Second Coming of Jesus to inaugurate the Kingdom of God. This view involves the belief that Jesus will return to receive those who have died in Christ {{and those who are}} awaiting his return, and <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> ready when he returns. Adventists are considered to be both restorationists and conservative Protestants.|$|E
25|$|Herbst notes {{a modern}} paradox {{regarding}} the colonial borders in Africa: {{while they are}} arbitrary there is a consensus among African leaders <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> maintained. Organization of African Unity in 1963 cemented colonial boundaries permanently by proclaiming that any changes made were illegitimate. This, in effect, avoided readdressing the basic injustice of colonial partition, while also reducing the likelihood of inter-state warfare as territorial boundaries were considered immutable by the international community.|$|E
25|$|One classic way {{of saving}} a draw in a losing {{position}} is by stalemate. Almost every master has {{at some point}} spoiled a won game by falling into a stalemate trap. The defender often achieves the stalemate by sacrificing all {{of his or her}} remaining mobile pieces, with check, in such a way <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> captured, leaving the defender with only a king (and sometimes also pawns and/or pieces) with no legal moves.|$|E
50|$|Vegetation: There {{may often}} be {{particular}} trees or other vegetation that <b>must</b> <b>be</b> protected {{on the job}} site. This may require fences or security tape to warn builders <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>must</b> not <b>be</b> harmed.|$|R
6000|$|... "Didn't know it! They {{have been}} living in that sort of way <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>must</b> have <b>been</b> confidantes in everything. Besides, I always hold that a woman is {{responsible}} for her female friends." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{participants}} in a marriage contract <b>must</b> <b>be</b> free to marry and to marry each other. <b>That</b> <b>is,</b> <b>they</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> an unmarried man and woman with no impediments as set out by canon law.|$|R
25|$|There are no {{qualifications}} for Justices in the Constitution (other than <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> under the compulsory retirement age of 70). The High Court of Australia Act 1979 requires that appointees {{have been a}} judge of a federal, state or territory court, or {{that they have been}} enrolled as a legal practitioner {{for at least five years}} with either the High Court itself or with a state or territory Supreme Court. There are no other formal requirements.|$|E
25|$|ED staff {{must also}} {{interact}} efficiently with pre-hospital care providers such as EMTs, paramedics, {{and others who}} are occasionally based in an ED. The pre-hospital providers may use equipment unfamiliar to the average physician, but ED physicians must be expert in using (and safely removing) specialized equipment, since devices such as military anti-shock trousers ("MAST") and traction splints require special procedures. Among other reasons, given <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> able to handle specialized equipment, physicians can now specialize in emergency medicine, and EDs employ many such specialists.|$|E
25|$|Alain Badiou is a {{founding}} member (along with Natacha Michel and Sylvain Lazarus) of the militant French political organisation L'Organisation Politique, which was active from 1985 until it disbanded in 2007. It called itself a post-party organization concerned with direct popular intervention {{in a wide range}} of issues (including immigration, labor, and housing). In addition to numerous writings and interventions, L'Organisation Politique highlighted the importance of developing political prescriptions concerning undocumented migrants (les sans papiers), stressing <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> conceived primarily as workers and not immigrants.|$|E
60|$|I think <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>must</b> have <b>been</b> commencing to {{have some}} doubts--those wild, naked, red warriors--for when the first man fell in the second boat, the others stopped {{paddling}} and commenced to jabber among themselves.|$|R
6000|$|... "They were magnificent," [...] he said. [...] "Dick and Cotter both agreed <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{had never}} seen their equal, and I fancy <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>must</b> have <b>been</b> worth {{a great deal more}} than your father valued them at." ...|$|R
50|$|Whether McGurrin was {{actually}} {{the first person to}} touch type or simply the first to be popularly noticed, is disputed. Speeds attained by other typists in other typing competitions at the time suggest <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>must</b> have <b>been</b> using similar systems.|$|R
25|$|Fritzsche {{arrived in}} Hamburg {{when a group}} of Prussian Old Lutherans were searching for {{financing}} and a pastor to join their group in emigrating to South Australia. In 1840, at the synodical gathering of the newly constituted Lutheran Church in Australia, a request had been sent to the Old Lutherans in Prussia to send a second pastor to the young German settlement. A requirement had been imposed on them by the Prussian government, <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> accompanied by a pastor before being allowed to emigrate.|$|E
25|$|The central {{stars of}} {{planetary}} nebulae are very hot. Their luminosity, though, is very low, implying <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> very small. Only once a star has exhausted all its nuclear fuel can it collapse {{to such a}} small size, and so planetary nebulae came {{to be understood as}} a final stage of stellar evolution. Spectroscopic observations show that all planetary nebulae are expanding, and so the idea arose that planetary nebulae were caused by a star's outer layers being thrown into space {{at the end of its}} life.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} available sources regarding Rognvald {{are mutually}} contradictory and were complied {{long after he}} died. The best known are the Norse Sagas, although modern scholars highlight many inconsistencies and improbable claims regarding Rognvald in the sagas, and believe <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> treated with caution: The texts of the sagas were compiled three centuries after the events described and their accuracy in regard to Rognvald's life and historical significance is now questioned. Hence some scholars instead emphasise other accounts, closer to the historical period in question, such as Irish and Scottish sources.|$|E
60|$|After {{another hour}} of {{suspense}} Lady Annabel arrived, and her entrance was the signal for a renewed burst of hysterics from Mrs. Cadurcis, so wild and terrible <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>must</b> have <b>been</b> contagious to any female of less disciplined emotions than her guest.|$|R
5000|$|The two manuscripts were copied by the Salzburg copyists Estlinger, {{implying}} <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>must</b> have <b>been</b> {{composed in}} Salzburg before the Mozarts left for Vienna in September 1767. However, the earlier the symphonies are dated, the more understandable Wolfgang's [...] "archaic style" [...] becomes.|$|R
60|$|No {{words can}} be more exquisitely, and in all points, useless; and I merely speak of them that I may, at once and for ever, {{get them out of}} my way and out of my reader's. But to get <b>that</b> done, <b>they</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> explained.|$|R
25|$|Entanglement based {{protocols}} : The quantum {{states of}} two (or more) separate objects can become linked together {{in such a}} way <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> described by a combined quantum state, not as individual objects. This is known as entanglement and means that, for example, performing a measurement on one object affects the other. If an entangled pair of objects is shared between two parties, anyone intercepting either object alters the overall system, revealing the presence of the third party (and the amount of information they have gained).|$|E
25|$|Transferred nationalism: Oceania's enemy changes, and an orator changes mid-sentence. The crowd {{instantly}} transfers its hatred {{to the new}} enemy. Transferred nationalism swiftly redirects emotions {{from one}} power unit to another (for example, Communism, Pacifism, Colour Feeling and Class Feeling). It happens during Hate Week, a Party rally against the original enemy. The crowd goes wild and destroys the posters that are now against their new friend, and many say <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> the act of an agent of their new enemy and former friend. Many of the crowd must have put up the posters before the rally but think {{that the state of}} affairs had always been the case.|$|E
25|$|Designing {{systems in}} churches and similar {{religious}} facilities often poses a challenge, because the speakers {{may have to}} be unobtrusive to blend in with antique woodwork and stonework. In some cases, audio designers have designed custom-painted speaker cabinets so that the speakers will blend in with the church architecture. Some church facilities, such as sanctuaries or chapels are long rooms with low ceilings, which means that additional fill-in speakers are needed throughout the room to give good coverage. An additional challenge with church SR systems is that, once installed, they are often operated by amateur volunteers from the congregation, which means <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> easy to operate and troubleshoot.|$|E
60|$|Pushing on stubbornly, camping {{where they}} could find shelter and wood, for they could hardly have survived a night spent in the open without a fire, they made, by calculation, two hundred miles; and Blake {{believed}} <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>must</b> surely <b>be</b> near the Hudson Bay post.|$|R

25|$|Skyscrapers have {{considerable}} mass, which means <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> {{built on a}} sturdier foundation than would be required for shorter, lighter buildings. Building materials must also be lifted {{to the top of}} a skyscraper during construction, requiring more energy than would be necessary at lower heights. Furthermore, a skyscraper consumes a lot of electricity because potable and non-potable water have to be pumped to the highest occupied floors, skyscrapers are usually designed to be mechanically ventilated, elevators are generally used instead of stairs, and natural lighting cannot be utilized in rooms far from the windows and the windowless spaces such as elevators, bathrooms and stairwells.|$|E
25|$|A pilot cutter {{cruising}} in {{the vicinity}} of Lundy Island had encountered Montagu a short time earlier. The battleship had stopped engines, come abreast, and hailed from the bridge requesting a distance and bearing for Hartland Point on the mainland of England. Though the cutter supplied these accurately, the voice from the battleships bridge replied <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> wrong and that the pilot cutter must have lost her bearings. As Montagu restarted her engines and began to move ahead, the cutter shouted back that on her present course Montagu would be on Shutter Rock within ten minutes, and a short time later the sound of the battleship running aground carried through the fog.|$|E
25|$|The 9th, 11th and 13th chords {{are known}} as {{extended}} tertian chords. As the scale repeats for every seven notes in the scale, these notes are enharmonically equivalent to the 2nd, 4th, and 6th– except they are more than an octave above the root. However, {{this does not mean}} <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> played in the higher octave. Although changing the octave of certain notes in a chord (within reason) does change the way the chord sounds, it does not change the essential characteristics or tendency of it. Accordingly, using 9th, 11th and 13th in chord notation implies that the chord is an extended tertian chord rather than an added chord (see Added Chords below).|$|E
6000|$|... 1. Suffer thyself, by the {{authority}} of the word, to be persuaded that the scripture indeed is the word of God; the scriptures of truth, the words of the holy one; and <b>that</b> <b>they</b> therefore <b>must</b> <b>be</b> every one true, pure, and for ever settled in heaven.|$|R
