25|$|The {{reason why}} the {{citizens}} of New York will pay so large {{a part of the}} tax is New York City is the chief financial and commercial centre of a great country with vast resources and industrial activity. For many years Americans engaged in developing the wealth of all parts of <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> going to New York to secure capital and market their securities and to buy their supplies. Thousands of men who have amassed fortunes in all sorts of enterprises in other states have gone to New York to live because they like the life of the city or because their distant enterprises require representation at the financial centre. The incomes of New York are in a great measure derived from the country at large.

Many years later the building was renamed “Stilwell Hall” in his honor, but because of the erosion of the bluffs over the decades, the building was taken down in 2003. Stilwell's former residence in Chongqing – a city along the Yangtze River to which Chiang's government retreated after being forced from Nanjing by Japanese troops – has now been converted to the General Joseph W. Stilwell Museum in his honor.|$|E
500|$|The tallest dams in China {{are some}} of the tallest dams in the world. Nearly 22,000 dams over [...] in height – about half the world's total – have been {{constructed}} in China since the 1950s.

The Yellow River {{in the western part of}} the country also hosts several among the tallest. Purposes for these high structures include flood control, irrigation and, predominantly, hydroelectric power.

2500|$|American elm {{trees are}} known for their towering canopies, which provide {{abundant}} shade throughout the spring, summer, and fall. [...] It is rare today to find such a collection of American elms, since many of the mature elms planted across <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> killed by Dutch Elm Disease. [...] This incurable disease, a fungus carried by elm bark beetles (Coleoptera scolytidae) that colonize on the branches of the elm tree, swept across the United States in the 1930s and remain a threat to the park's collection of elms. [...] Despite having lost at least 34 of the trees, Tompkins Square Park still hosts a large assemblage of elms, which continue to this day to enchant park patrons. [...] The East Village Parks Conservancy, a volunteer group, raises significant private funds for the ongoing care and maintenance of the American elms and other historic trees in Tompkins Square Park.|$|E
