5|$|Another {{adaptation}} {{of a classic}} European theatrical work followed almost immediately, with production of The Lower Depths, based on a play by Maxim Gorky, taking place in May and June 1957. In contrast to the Shakespearean sweep of <b>Throne</b> <b>of</b> Blood, The Lower Depths was shot on only two confined sets, in order to emphasize the restricted nature of the characters' lives. Though faithful to the play, this {{adaptation of}} Russian material to a completely Japanese setting—in this case, the late Edo period—unlike his earlier The Idiot, was regarded as artistically successful. The film premiered in September 1957, receiving a mixed response {{similar to that of}} <b>Throne</b> <b>of</b> Blood. However, some critics rank it among the director's most underrated works.|$|E
5|$|As Sovereign, Victoria {{used the}} royal {{coat of arms}} of the United Kingdom. Before her accession, she {{received}} no grant of arms.

5|$|Cleomenes III {{ascended the}} <b>throne</b> <b>of</b> Sparta in 236 BC or 235 BC, after deposing his father, Leonidas II. His {{accession}} to power ended a decade-long period of heightened {{conflict between the}} two royal families. Sparta's ancient dual kingship was explained by the founding legend, that the original conquerors of Sparta were twin brothers and their descendants shared Sparta. During the turmoil, Leonidas II had executed his rival king, the reformist Agis IV.|$|E
5|$|Darius {{therefore}} began {{raising a}} huge new army {{with which he}} meant to completely subjugate Greece; however, in 486 BC, his Egyptian subjects revolted, indefinitely postponing any Greek expedition.

Xerxes crushed the Egyptian revolt, and very quickly restarted the preparations for the invasion of Greece.|$|E
