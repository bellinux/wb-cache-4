500|$|At {{the start}} of the 2003–04 season, Iginla was named the 18th captain in Flames {{franchise}} history, and 14th since the team moved to Calgary from Atlanta in 1980. His predecessor as captain, Craig Conroy, cited Iginla's experience and leadership for his decision to relinquish the captaincy. [...] "He was a leader on that team and old enough to where he'd been there a long time. It was time for him. He <b>took</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Stanley Cup Final that year so it worked out pretty well." [...] Iginla was reported to be the first black captain in NHL history, though former Blackhawks captain Dirk Graham, who is of African descent, has also been said to hold that honour.|$|E
2500|$|Among those {{expelled}} was {{the family}} of Sendel and Riva Grynszpan, Polish Jews who had emigrated to Germany in 1911 and settled in Hanover, Germany. At the trial of Adolf Eichmann in 1961, Sendel Grynszpan recounted the events of their deportation from Hanover {{on the night of}} 27 October 1938: [...] "Then they took us in police trucks, in prisoners' lorries, about 20 men in each truck, and they <b>took</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> railway station. The streets were full of people shouting: Juden raus! Auf nach Palästina!" [...] ("Jews out, out to Palestine!"). Their seventeen-year-old son Herschel was living in Paris with an uncle. Herschel received a postcard from his family from the Polish border, describing the family's expulsion: [...] "No one told us what was up, but we realised {{this was going to be}} the end ... We haven't a penny. Could you send us something?" [...] He received the postcard on 3 November 1938.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the failure}} of the referendum, the Colombian {{government}} and the FARC, on November 24, signed a revised agreement. Colombia’s congress approved the revised peace accord. It was then submitted to Congress for approval. On 29 November, the Senate approved the deal 75-0 and the House of Representatives approved it the next day by a vote of 130-0 despite former President Alvaro Uribe's supporters boycotting the session. Santos welcomed the resolution, while Sergio Jaramillo, the government’s peace commissioner, said: [...] "This last part of renegotiation was exhausting. It <b>took</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> limit. But now we pass to something more difficult, which is to change the conditions on the ground and benefit our campesinos. And to assure there is safe transit for the FARC and to worry about the security of communities. [...] no more political deaths in Colombia." [...] Uribe's supporters accused the government of giving away too many rights, including FARC's ability to form a political party. The deal now means FARC members were go to designated transitional zones within five days and hand over its weapons to the United Nations representatives within the next six months. They would also be able to form a political party.|$|E

2500|$|... “The old days. [...] After all {{the fall}} of 1906 is a far piece back, and high school {{football}} then was a mighty casual and simple thing. [...] That was my senior year and I was a ‘new boy’, having just moved to Massillon that summer from the wide open spaces of South Dakota, Wyoming and Nebraska. [...] The first day at school several of my classmates came around to suggest that of course I was coming out for football; and although I protested that I {{had never had a}} ball in my hands, they countered with the argument that I was a good sized lump of a boy and would make a fine prospect. [...] So I promised. [...] Well the only preparation necessary was to take an old pair of shoes down to the town cobbler and have some cleats nailed on them. [...] I think the athletic association must have had some football pants, but I do remember distinctly that you had to furnish your own stockings (any color) and an old sweater. [...] Put these on and you were in business. [...] I can’t believe that there were more than 11 candidates out because I made the team the first afternoon. [...] Nor did we have a regular coach. [...] A boy named Fritz Merwin, who I think had played the year before was our coach. [...] If you ask me, he’s the one whose picture ought to be hanging up around there someplace. [...] He didn’t get paid anything, and if a coach ever had an awkward squad of 11 nit-wits, he did. [...] But he was out there every afternoon, early and late teaching us fundamentals instead of fancy razzle-dazzle plays, and in the end it paid off because we won a few games. [...] I can’t remember who we beat, but I do recall, painfully even after this lapse of time, that our friends over at the county seat (Canton, Ohio) <b>took</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cleaners twice.” ...|$|E

6000|$|... "The skirts all flutter and {{the rocking}} chairs squeak as me and Andy bows {{and then goes}} on in with old Smoke-'em-out to register.

60|$|The Sacristan <b>took</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{top of one}} of the towers, {{and showed}} us the five bells hanging in their loft.

6000|$|The old man <b>took</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> inn {{which he}} recommended, {{and we found}} it was the Angel. It was a nice, old-fashioned, queer English house.

60|$|On the day {{appointed}} the Morris automobile called {{for us and}} <b>took</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> train, and when the children found {{that they were to}} travel in a private pullman and that the stateroom was to be their own little house they were transported with pride.

60|$|And so, singing, dancing, paddling, these joyous Polynesians <b>took</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fishing. The gendarme, {{who is the}} French {{ruler of}} Bora Bora, {{accompanied}} us {{with his family in}} a double canoe of his own, paddled by his prisoners; for not only is he gendarme and ruler, but he is jailer as well, and in this jolly land when anybody goes fishing, all go fishing. A score of single canoes, with outriggers, paddled along with us. Around a point a big sailing-canoe appeared, running beautifully before the wind as it bore down to greet us. Balancing precariously on the outrigger, three young men saluted us with a wild rolling of drums.|$|E
6000|$|Once {{inside the}} gates we let him play the host. He bought candy for the children, paid for our dinners at the {{restaurant}} and <b>took</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> side-shows. It wearied him, however, and about three o'clock he said [...] "Let's go home by way of Onalaska. I want to visit the cemetery and see if Father's lot is properly cared for." [...] It seemed a rather melancholy finish to our day, but I agreed and as we were crossing the sandy stretch of road over which I limped as a child, I remarked [...] "How short the distance seems." [...] He smiled like a conqueror, [...] "This is next thing to flying," [...] he said.|$|E
60|$|Thither {{we drove}} {{accordingly}} through the fine, frosty air, {{for the month}} was December. On reaching the castle, Mr. Scroope was told that Lord Ragnall, whom he knew well, was out shooting somewhere in the park, but that, of course, he could show his friend over the place. So we went in, the three of us, for Miss Manners, to whom Scroope was to be married very shortly, had driven us over in her pony carriage. The porter at the gateway towers <b>took</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> main door of the castle and handed us over to another man, whom he addressed as Mr. Savage, whispering {{to me that he}} was his lordship's personal attendant.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'd give {{a hundred}} dollars if a boat would come along and <b>take</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mainland," [...] {{observed}} the father. [...] "I am {{sick and tired of}} this game all through." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Will {{you please}} <b>take</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{opposite}} hillside? We are afraid <b>to</b> venture into <b>the</b> mist. I am Princess Ozma of Oz, {{and this is}} my friend Dorothy, a Princess of Oz." ...|$|R
50|$|It {{became more}} and more common, as the Roman Empire neared its end, that the Romans paid tribute to Germanic armies who {{threatened}} to invade Rome. This <b>takes</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> plunder aspect.|$|R
60|$|Susquesus {{thought a}} little caution necessary, as we drew {{near to the}} end of our journey. Causing us to remain behind, he {{advanced}} in front, himself, to reconnoitre. A signal, however, soon <b>took</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> place where he stood, when we discovered the hut just as we had left it, but no one near it. This might be the result of mere accident, the surveying party frequently 'camping out,' in preference to making a long march after a fatiguing day's work; and Pete would be very likely to prefer going to join these men, to remaining alone in the hut. We advanced to the building, therefore, with confidence. On reaching it, we found the place empty, as had been anticipated, though with every sign about it of its tenants having left it but a short time previously; that morning, at the furthest.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, sir, I {{can tell}} it in a few words. The current <b>took</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{opposite}} shore. We lay concealed under the bushes overhanging the bank, and could hear the enemy talking behind the screen. On the following day the voices ceased, and {{we made our way}} up to the camp; and found, as we expected, that you had gone and, as we guessed, the Ashantis had set off in pursuit. We went on through the forest and, of course, heard the firing in the distance; and saw the enemy coming along the path, terror stricken. We were waiting for a bit, and felt sure that they had all passed; when a party of four men came from behind upon us. I don't think they belonged to the force you defeated. They were within twenty yards when they saw us.|$|E
6000|$|We {{were glad}} to go away from the dreadful place, though Tangier was so plain across the strait, and we were almost in Africa there, and hard by, in the waters tossing free, the great battle of Trafalgar was fought. From the fountains of my far youth, when I first heard of Guzman's dreadful heroism, I {{endeavored}} to pump up an adequate emotion; I succeeded somewhat better with Nelson and his pathetic prayer of [...] "Kiss me, Hardy," [...] as he lay dying on his bloody deck; but I did not much triumph with either, and I was grateful when our good little policeman comfortably questioned the deed of Guzman which he said some doubted, though he <b>took</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> very spot where the Moors had parleyed with Guzman, and showed us the tablet over the castle gate affirming the fact.|$|E
6000|$|... "You mustn't {{forget that}} you are <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{mountains}} on a hunting expedition," [...] came from Roger. [...] "We {{want to get some}} deer, or an elk, before we go back East." ...|$|R
