However, in relative terms {{there is not much}} of a difference. We also find <b>that</b> <b>the</b> sensitivity of individual job finding rates to the aggregate state of the labor market does not differ between natives and non-western immigrants. In combination our findings suggest <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Great <b>Recession</b> did not have a different impact on the unemployment of non-westerns immigrants and native Dutch. ...|$|R

2500|$|Keating's {{tenure as}} Treasurer was often criticised for high {{interest}} rates and the 1990s recession, which Keating referred to in an interview as [...] "(the) recession Australia had to have". Through the 1980s, both the global and Australian economies grew quickly, and by the late 1980s inflation had grown to around 9%. By 1988, the Reserve Bank of Australia began tightening monetary policy, and household interest rates peaked at 18%. It is often said that the Bank was too slow in easing monetary policy, and that this ultimately led to a recession. In private, Keating had argued for rates to rise earlier than they did, and fall sooner, although his view was {{at odds with the}} Reserve Bank and his Treasury colleagues. Publicly, Hawke and Keating had said there would be no recession– or {{that there would be a}} [...] "soft landing"– but this changed when Keating announced the country was indeed in recession in 1990. Claiming <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>recession</b> was something Australia [...] "had to have" [...] was referred to by Paul Kelly as [...] "perhaps the most stupid remark of Keating's career, and it nearly cost him the Prime Ministership."

2500|$|Despite {{the global}} credit crisis, {{automobile}} sales and the real-estate sector {{continued to grow}} in Bihar. Auto sales grew by 45% to 1,33,000 in the last 11 months of 2008, against 92,147 sold in 2007. Due to the global credit crunch, many Indian states have reported a decline of 20-25 percent in the automobile sales. Deputy Bihar Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi said [...] "The rise in sales figure of vehicles in the state {{at the rate of}} 45 percent shows <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>recession</b> has not affected the sector at all in the state". November 2008 reported 19,729 vehicle sales in different categories, whereas 15,326 vehicles were sold in the same period of the prior year. The revenue collection department in Bihar has registered a growth of 28.02 per cent in revenue collection until November 2008. The department collected Rs 192.01 crore in 2008 against Rs 149.99 crore in 2007. Also the real-estate sector earned Rs 37 crore in revenue from flat registrations in October and November 2008 alone. Altogether 3,139 flats were registered, which indicates there is good cash flow. The real estate sector has been badly hit by the global recession in other parts of India, which have compelled the builders to slash rates and offer attractive packages to push through their sales. The small industrial base, brought on by political mis-management in the 1990s, the small-scale nature of the loans sector, and that employment is generally with public sector, or semi government owned businesses, are all key factors in Bihar avoiding the recession. The service sector, which is the other large employer, is not as mature as other Indian states and caters for a large market. Modi added that the rate of real estate properties had increased tremendously since it was the middle-class population who dominated the state. Another factor was that a huge number of development projects had been launched in Bihar since the NDA government came to power in 2005, which had drawn many construction companies, builders and suppliers. In 2008 alone, the state government was investing Rs 13,500 crore (135 billion Rupees) on development projects.|$|E

40|$|This paper argues <b>that</b> <b>the</b> global <b>recession</b> of 2009 {{marks the}} ending of a global {{development}} cycle {{which began in the}} early 1950 s. The long-wave rhythm of production and prices in the global development cycle is generated by the life cycle of investment and innovation during a technological revolution, related changes in supply and demand for natural resources, and inertia and transformation in the socio-institutional framework within which development takes place. From this perspective, <b>the</b> global <b>recession</b> is interpreted as a blocked structural transition. Whilst failings in the financial system triggered the global financial crisis, <b>that</b> crisis and <b>the</b> <b>recession</b> are more deeply rooted in contradictions in the global development trajectory. A paradigm shift in development theory and practice is a crucial element of the socio-institutional transformation now necessary to re-boot the global development cycle.
