5|$|Beavers, rodents {{weighing}} up to , have sometimes caused problems along Fanno Creek. In 2014 and 2015, a growing population of beavers gnawed down trees and dammed the creek in Greenway Park in Beaverton.

Park officials are considering a variety of options, including re-routing the trails, building a boardwalk over the water, or removing <b>the</b> <b>beaver</b> dams.|$|E

50|$|Baseball teams called <b>the</b> <b>Beavers</b> {{existed in}} Portland from 1903-1917 and again from 1919-1972 and 1978-1993, and finally from 2001-2010. In 1973, after <b>the</b> <b>Beavers</b> moved to Spokane, Washington, the Portland Mavericks {{came to town}} {{in the form of}} an {{independent}} Single-A team within the Northwest League. From 1973 to 1977 they played in what was then known as Civic Stadium. The Mavericks were owned by ex-minor league player and television actor Bing Russell. When Russell sold the team back to <b>the</b> <b>Beavers</b> in 1978 it was for $116,000, at the time a record amount for a minor league franchise. <b>The</b> most recent <b>Beavers</b> franchise also played at Civic Stadium. <b>The</b> original <b>Beavers</b> stadium was Vaughn Street Park located in northwest Portland. <b>The</b> <b>Beavers</b> won <b>the</b> Pacific Coast League Pennant the following years: 1906, 1910, 1911, 1913, 1914, 1932, 1936, 1945 and 1983.

5|$|Omnivorous mammals such as {{the raccoon}} and skunk and {{herbivore}} mammal species {{such as the}} porcupine and pika, are common to the forest. <b>The</b> <b>beaver</b> is considered a species of special interest to Shoshone National Forest since its dam building activities improve habitat for numerous other species such as the moose, breeding waterfowl, various amphibians and other species dependent on a riparian environment.|$|E

5|$|Canada's {{national}} {{symbols are}} influenced by natural, historical, and indigenous sources. The use of the maple leaf as a Canadian symbol dates to the early 18th century. The maple leaf is depicted on Canada's current and previous flags, and on the Arms of Canada. The Arms of Canada is closely modelled after the royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom with French and distinctive Canadian elements replacing or added to those derived from the British version. The Great Seal of Canada is a governmental seal used for purposes of state, being set on letters patent, proclamations and commissions, for representatives of the Queen and for the appointment of cabinet ministers, lieutenant governors, senators, and judges. Other prominent symbols include <b>the</b> <b>beaver,</b> Canada goose, and common loon, the Crown, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and more recently the totem pole and Inuksuk. Canadian coins feature many of these symbols: the loon on the $1 coin, the Arms of Canada on the 50¢ piece, <b>the</b> <b>beaver</b> on the nickel. The penny, removed from circulation in 2013, featured the maple leaf. The Queen' s image appears on $20 bank notes, and on the obverse of all current Canadian coins.|$|E
5|$|For years {{leading up}} to the {{creation}} of the park, the leading citizens and newspapers in Albany had pushed for a grand public park. Frederick Law Olmsted's Olmsted, Vaux and Company was hired in 1869 to plan such a park. In their plan they envisioned Washington Park as the centerpiece of a string of parks and boulevards similar to those they had designed in Buffalo, Boston, and Brooklyn. Though Olmsted and his company was not involved in the actual design of the park, their broad vision was followed for the detailed designs, including the idea of damming <b>the</b> <b>Beaver</b> Kill (Beaver Creek) to form a grand lake.|$|E
5|$|Governor Lane {{kept the}} legal {{code of the}} {{dissolved}} provisional government, only immediately repealing the law authorizing the minting of <b>the</b> <b>Beaver</b> Coins, as this was incompatible with the United States Constitution (Article I, Section 8).
