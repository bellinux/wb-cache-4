5|$|Barbette {{continued}} to perform until the mid-to-late 1930s. Most sources report {{the year as}} 1938, while others as early as 1936 and as late as 1942. The end of Barbette's performing career is attributed {{to a number of}} causes including a fall, pneumonia, polio, or some combination of the three. All generally agree <b>that</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>the</b> cause, Barbette was left in extreme pain and in need of surgery and extensive rehabilitation to allow him to walk again.|$|E

Their league success meant <b>that</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>the</b> result they would be {{competing}} in the European Cup the following season. Borussia Dortmund had finished as runners-up in the 1965–66 Fußball-Bundesliga, three points behind champions 1860 Munich. As Bayern Munich had won the 1965–66 DFB-Pokal, Dortmund's only chance of participating in European football the following season was to win the Cup Winners' Cup.|$|E

Their league success meant <b>that</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>the</b> result they would be {{competing}} in the European Cup the following season. As {{a result of their}} league success, Liverpool were looking to become the first English team to win a European trophy in the same year as winning the league. Borussia Mönchengladbach had finished fifth in the 1972–73 Fußball-Bundesliga, however they won the 1972–73 DFB-Pokal, the German domestic cup competition. This meant they would be participating in the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in the following season.|$|E

5|$|VHEMT {{was founded}} in 1991 by Les U. Knight, an American activist who became {{involved}} in the environmental movement in the 1970s and thereafter concluded that human extinction was the best solution to the problems facing the Earth's biosphere and humanity. Knight publishes the group's newsletter and serves as its spokesman. Although the group is promoted by a website and represented at some environmental events, it relies heavily on coverage from outside media to spread its message. Many commentators view its platform as unacceptably extreme, though other writers have applauded VHEMT's perspective. In response to VHEMT, some journalists and academics have argued that humans can develop sustainable lifestyles or can reduce their population to sustainable levels. Others maintain <b>that,</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>the</b> merits of the idea, the human reproductive drive will prevent humankind from ever voluntarily seeking extinction.|$|E
25|$|He {{also noted}} <b>that</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>the</b> {{details of the}} contested {{initiation}} of the custody {{at the end of}} 1942 might be, Adrianus Hertogh had not been part of it and had not abrogated his parental rights. He therefore awarded the custody of Maria to the Hertoghs and ordered that she should be handed over to her mother with immediate effect.|$|E

25|$|In 1957, when insulin coma {{treatment}} use was declining, the Lancet {{published the}} results of a randomized, controlled trial where patients were either given insulin coma treatment or identical treatment but with unconsciousness produced by barbiturates.

They also deny the existence of any centralized and secretive global Muslim Brotherhood leadership. Some claim that the origins of modern Muslim terrorism are found in Wahhabi ideology, not that of the Muslim Brotherhood.|$|E

25|$|In the 1877 Wi Parata v Bishop of Wellington judgement, Prendergast {{argued that}} the Treaty was a 'simple nullity' in terms of {{transferring}} sovereignty from Māori to the United Kingdom. This remained the legal orthodoxy until at least the 1970s. Since then, legal commentators have argued <b>that</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>the</b> state of Māori government in 1840, the British had acknowledged Māori sovereignty with the Declaration of the Independence of New Zealand in 1835. Therefore, if both parties had agreed on the Treaty, it was valid in a pragmatic if not necessarily a legal sense.|$|E
25|$|Thomson first {{investigated}} the magnetic deflection of cathode rays. Cathode rays were {{produced in the}} side tube on {{the left of the}} apparatus and passed through the anode into the main bell jar, where they were deflected by a magnet. Thomson detected their path by the fluorescence on a squared screen in the jar. He found <b>that</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>the</b> material of the anode and the gas in the jar, the deflection of the rays was the same, suggesting that the rays were of the same form whatever their origin.|$|E
25|$|Stephenson {{designed}} Rocket for the Rainhill trials, and {{the specific}} rules of that contest. As the first railway intended for passengers more than freight, the rules emphasised speed and would require reliability, but {{the weight of the}} locomotive was also tightly restricted. Six-wheeled locomotives were limited to six tons, four-wheeled locomotives to four and a half tons. In particular, the weight of the train expected to be hauled was to be no {{more than three times the}} actual weight of the locomotive. Stephenson realised <b>that</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>the</b> size of previously successful locomotives, this new contest would favour a fast, light locomotive of only moderate hauling power.|$|E

25|$|Hydrogen {{has one of}} {{the widest}} explosive/ignition mix range with air of all the gases with few {{exceptions}} such as acetylene, silane, and ethylene oxide. That means <b>that</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>the</b> mix proportion between air and hydrogen, a hydrogen leak will most likely lead to an explosion, not a mere flame, when a flame or spark ignites the mixture. This makes the use of hydrogen particularly dangerous in enclosed areas such as tunnels or underground parking. Pure hydrogen-oxygen flames burn in the ultraviolet color range and are nearly invisible to the naked eye, so a flame detector is needed to detect if a hydrogen leak is burning. Hydrogen is odorless and leaks cannot be detected by smell.|$|E
25|$|Efforts to {{establish}} the play's date of composition are complicated by its uncertain relationship with another Elizabethan play with an almost identical plot but different wording and character names, A Pleasant Conceited Historie, called the taming of a Shrew. The Shrews exact relationship with A Shrew is unknown. Different theories suggest A Shrew could be a reported text of a performance of The Shrew, a source for The Shrew, an early draft (possibly reported) of The Shrew, or an adaptation of The Shrew. A Shrew was entered in the Stationers' Register on 2 May 1594, suggesting <b>that</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>the</b> {{relationship between the two}} plays, The Shrew was most likely written somewhere between 1590 (roughly when Shakespeare arrived in London) and 1594 (registration of A Shrew).|$|E
25|$|The mystery {{begins to}} unravel. Alex and Chase decide <b>that</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>the</b> Tenandrome found, Lesha Tanner {{had found it}} first, 200 years before. Alex has an {{inspiration}} – {{the location of the}} missing something is obliquely described in a poem by Walford Candles, to whom Tanner must have confided the secret. A collection of Candles' poems, Rumors of Earth, had been in Uncle Gabe’s bedroom when Alex returned, and was open to that poem. Gabriel Benedict must have had the same insight. Alex is able to find the university researcher who helped his uncle work with the clues in Candles’ poem and who identifies a location about 1,300 light years into the Veiled Lady as the primary locus of search.|$|E

25|$|On 17 March 2006, the Met was {{threatened}} with legal action by Deputy Assistant Commissioner, Brian Paddick. In {{evidence to the}} IPCC, Paddick had stated that a member of Sir Ian's private office team believed the wrong man had been targeted just six hours after the shooting, contrary to the official line taken at the time. When this information became public, Scotland Yard issued a statement that the officer making the claim (Paddick) 'has categorically denied this in his interview with, and statement to, the IPCC investigators'. The statement continued that they 'were satisfied <b>that</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>the</b> reasons for this suggestion being made, {{it is simply not}} true.' Paddick's interpretation of this statement was that it accused him of lying.|$|E

Lenny drives by and manages to get Max away from them. However, Lenny takes Max to his companions, who want Max to give them the number. At a nearby synagogue, they reveal their intentions: they believe the 216-digit number was meant for them to bring about the messianic age, as the number represents the unspeakable name of God. Max refuses, insisting <b>that</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>the</b> source of the number is, it has been revealed to him alone.|$|E
25|$|Critics argue <b>that</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>the</b> {{merits of}} the system for electing the National Assembly, that body is itself a facade for the reality of PCC rule in Cuba. The Assembly meets only twice {{a year for a}} few days which is the basis of these beliefs. The 31-member Council of State, in theory elected by the Assembly but hypothetically in {{practice}} appointed by the PCC, wields effective state power, and the PCC Politburo is assumed to be the ultimate political authority. Although the Assembly has eight standing committees, they do not exercise any effective authority over legislation. During its biannual plenums, the Assembly is said to play a passive role as audience for various government speakers. Once the Council of State's legislative proposals have been presented, they are summarily ratified by unanimous or near unanimous vote of the Assembly.|$|E
