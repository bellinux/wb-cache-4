40|$|Various {{approaches}} {{have been used}} to improve smallholder farmers’ livelihood systems. One approach is to build farmer capacity with a view of improving their knowledge and skills.

5|$|In {{the final}} decades of this era many plebeians grew poorer. The long {{military}} campaigns had forced citizens to leave <b>their</b> <b>farms</b> to fight, while <b>their</b> <b>farms</b> fell into disrepair. The landed aristocracy began buying bankrupted farms at discounted prices. As commodity prices fell, many farmers {{could no longer}} operate <b>their</b> <b>farms</b> at a profit. The result was the ultimate bankruptcy of countless farmers. Masses of unemployed plebeians soon began to flood into Rome, and thus {{into the ranks of}} the legislative assemblies. Their poverty usually led them to vote for the candidate who offered them the most. A new culture of dependency was emerging, in which citizens would look to any populist leader for relief.|$|R

5|$|Horse {{ownership}} {{was widespread}} by the 12th century. Both tenant farmers and landlords {{were involved in}} the harrowing of land for arable crops in the relatively new open field system, and employed horses for this work. Horses and carts were increasingly used for transporting farm goods and implements; peasants were obliged to transport such items in their own carts, though the poorest may have had to rely on one horse for all <b>their</b> <b>farm</b> work. The necessity for carting produce revolutionised communication between villages. Horse-breeding as an enterprise continued; in the 14th century, Hexham Priory had 80broodmares, the Prior of Durham owned two stud farms, Rievaulx Abbey owned one, Gilbert d'Umfraville, Earl of Angus, in Scotland, had significant grazing lands for mares, and horse-breeding was being carried out both east and west of the Pennines.|$|E
5|$|Jackson {{signed a}} three-year {{contract}} with the Jersey City Giants of the Class-AA International League after the 1936 season. The team, which the Giants had purchased to become <b>their</b> <b>farm</b> team that offseason, was moved from Albany, New York, with Jackson to serve as player-manager. Jackson's knees prevented him from appearing in many games with Jersey City as a player, but he remained as the team's manager until July 1938, when he was replaced with Hank DeBerry. The Giants brought Jackson back to MLB as a coach for the remaining 18 months on his contract, succeeding Tommy Clarke, who became a scout.|$|E

His family {{consisted}} of seven children—three brothers and four sisters—with Singh being the youngest son. As a young boy, Singh always hated school, as he was unable to cope with the restricted environment. One day, after being scolded by his class teacher for quarreling with one of his classmates, Singh ran away, and never returned to school. After that, Singh continued to help his parents in <b>their</b> <b>farm,</b> and grew up to be well-built and handsome youth. Shikar, a local Indian sport, was his favourite game. Though Singh wanted to join the army from his childhood, he was rejected twice, as he was too young, before he was accepted at the age of eighteen.|$|E

One team of seven cadres contacted the BSAP near the northern town of Sinoia on 28 April 1966 and was wiped out, the police killing all seven without taking casualties. On 16 May another of the ZANLA groups murdered a farmer, Johannes Viljoen, and his wife at <b>their</b> <b>farm</b> just north of Hartley. 1 Commando and the police were deployed on Operation Pagoda, which ended on 18 September 1966, the BSAP having done most of the work; as the local police commanders were reluctant {{at this time to}} sign control over to the army, the RLI had been given little opportunity to act.|$|E

5|$|Late in the season, reports {{began to}} surface that the Canucks would be {{purchasing}} their own AHL team and relocating it. Vancouver {{wanted to have}} more control over personnel decisions for <b>their</b> <b>farm</b> team and bought the Peoria Rivermen. The Canucks had originally hoped to move the franchise to nearby Abbotsford, British Columbia, which was home of the Calgary Flames AHL affiliate the Abbotsford Heat. Calgary indicated {{they would be willing}} to move their franchise, but a deal between the Canucks and the city of Abbotsford was unable to be reached. With the Abbotsford deal not working out, the Canucks set out to find a new home for their affiliate. They considered moving the team to Vancouver and sharing Rogers Arena, but the city was within the 50-mile territorial radius provided by the AHL. They next considered moving the team to Seattle, Washington, but were not allowed by the NHL. Seattle was a candidate to land the Phoenix Coyotes if a lease agreement could not be reached with the city of Glendale. Eventually, the Canucks decided to relocate their franchise to Utica, New York, creating the Comets.|$|E
5|$|Water clocks, or Fenjaan, in Persia {{reached a}} level of {{accuracy}} comparable to today's standards of timekeeping. The fenjaan was the most accurate and commonly used timekeeping device for calculating the amount or the time that a farmer must take water from a qanat or well for irrigation of the farms, until it was replaced by more accurate current clock. Persian water clocks were a practical and useful tool for the qanat's shareholders to calculate {{the length of time}} they could divert water to <b>their</b> <b>farm.</b> The qanat was the only water source for agriculture and irrigation so a just and fair water distribution was very important. Therefore, a very fair and clever old person was elected to be the manager of the water clock, and at least two full-time managers were needed to control and observe the number of fenjaans and announce the exact time during the days and nights.|$|E
