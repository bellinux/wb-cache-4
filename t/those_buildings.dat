One of <b>those</b> <b>buildings,</b> St John's Church, is registered by Heritage New Zealand as a Category II heritage building, and the gatehouse is a museum that is open on request. Today, few buildings exist in the village, but the formal layout of avenues still exists, giving the setting a charming appearance.|$|E
5|$|Despite Stroheim's {{reputation}} as a perfectionist, Greed contains anachronisms. In the scenes on Polk Street, the main characters are clothed in 1890s fashions, but the extras wear 1920s clothing. Stroheim {{did his best to}} avoid such historical mistakes; he shot only <b>those</b> <b>buildings</b> that were from the era Greed was set in, and he kept motor vehicles out of sight while filming. Daniels stated that, despite his desire for authenticity, Stroheim sometimes had walls knocked out of real locations to achieve a desired camera position.|$|E

5|$|In the 6th {{or early}} 7th century a natural {{disaster}} caused a devastating flood of the Motagua Valley and buried {{the surface of the}} site under a deep layer of silt, completely changing the landscape. Only <b>those</b> <b>buildings</b> that stood above the mud continued in use, including group A, saved by its hilltop location. The earthen platform on the valley floor also continued in use, at least those parts of it that stood above the silt, {{and it was one of}} the site's smaller complexes that grew to become the new centre of Quiriguá, as represented by the monuments visible to this day.|$|E
5|$|The second error charged (with some exaggeration) {{was that}} the Petrobrusians said, “Edifices for temples and churches should not be erected...The Petrobrusians are quoted as saying, 'It is {{unnecessary}} to build temples, since the church of God does not consist in a multitude of stones joined together, but in {{the unity of the}} believers assembled.'” On the other hand, the medieval Church taught that cathedrals and churches were created to glorify God, and believed it appropriate that <b>those</b> <b>buildings</b> should be as grand and beautiful as wealth and skill could make them.|$|E
5|$|The {{two major}} {{evacuation}} points chosen for Operation Frequent Wind were the DAO Compound adjacent to Tan Son Nhut Airport for American and Vietnamese civilian evacuees, and the US Embassy, Saigon for Embassy staff.

50|$|The site made it {{necessary}} to modify <b>those</b> <b>building</b> techniques slightly. The arches are not connected to the carrying wall, instead placed on bearing arms. The overall weight of the structure keeps these elements together. Some newer building materials, such as wooden lintels, were used, allowing the building to be more flexible and resist earthquakes.|$|R
5|$|The {{walls of}} the Hall are {{decorated}} with paintings of noted patrons or members of the Inn, including Nicholas Bacon and Elizabeth I. During the Second World War the Hall was one of <b>those</b> <b>buildings</b> badly damaged during the Blitz.

The rebuilt hall was designed by Edward Maufe, and was formally opened in 1951 by the Duke of Gloucester.|$|E
5|$|Thus a {{particular}} brand of Baroque architecture {{had begun to}} evolve in Sicily long before the earthquake of 1693. While the majority of <b>those</b> <b>buildings</b> that can be clearly classified as Baroque in style date from around 1650, the scarcity of these isolated, surviving examples of Sicily's 17th-century architectural history {{makes it hard to}} fully and accurately evaluate the architecture immediately before the natural disaster: the earthquake destroyed not only most of the buildings, but also most of their documentation. Yet more information has been lost in subsequent earthquakes and severe bombing during World War II.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the units}} {{available}} to the player are characters in the game's storyline, while the rest are monsters which can be summoned by the player. Resources, divided into berries and minerals, are gathered from resource nodes by Rabite units. Minerals are used to create buildings, while berries are used to create units from <b>those</b> <b>buildings.</b> Both buildings and units are built inside of the player's airship, and units are then dropped onto the battlefield by the movable ship. The game features some role-playing elements; characters {{during the course of}} the game learn new skills over time, and can be given equipment to increase their attack and defense. New equipment is obtained through completing story and bonus missions and finding hidden treasure. During the course of the game's story the player also acquires new summons and heroes. Missions can have different ending conditions, such as destroying an enemy carrier or defeating all enemies in the area. There are over 20 missions in the game's story, as well as dozens of bonus missions which become available as the player advances through the game which do not advance the plot but can give the player more items and summons.|$|E
