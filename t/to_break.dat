5|$|A {{supporter}} of President Nixon's law-and-order philosophies, Nunn called out the National Guard <b>to</b> <b>break</b> up violent protests in the state. In May 1968, {{he sent the}} Guard to Louisville <b>to</b> <b>break</b> up race-related protests that followed peaceful civil rights marches. This action was criticized by civil rights leaders across the state. In May 1970, Nunn again dispatched the Guard to quell protests against the Vietnam War at the University of Kentucky, and imposed a curfew that interfered with final examinations. The latter protest culminated in the burning {{of one of the}} university's ROTC buildings.|$|E

Dependence of distance <b>to</b> <b>breaking</b> and modulation depth (height ratio of the highest and the lowest waves in a group) on wind forcing was described. It was shown that {{in the presence of a}} certain wind forcing both distance <b>to</b> <b>breaking</b> and modulation depth decrease; the latter signifies slowing down of the instability growth.

There is no evidence to suggest that Generals Heinrici, Busse, or Wenck thought that this was even remotely strategically feasible, but Hitler's agreement to allow the IX Army <b>to</b> <b>break</b> through Soviet lines allowed many German soldiers to escape to the west and surrender to the United States Army.|$|E

40|$|Progression of {{nonlinear}} {{wave group}}s <b>to</b> <b>breaking</b> was studied numerically and experimentally. Evolution of such wave group parameters as distance <b>to</b> <b>breaking</b> and modulation depth was described. The wave modulation depth R is a height {{ratio of the}} highest Hh and the lowest Hl waves in the group: R = Hh=Hl. This parameter, together with distance <b>to</b> <b>breaking,</b> was studied {{by means of the}} fully-nonlinear Chalikov-Sheinin (CS) model. Subsequent experiment demonstrated a good qualitative agreement with the numerical results. In the present study, both in numerical simulations and laboratory experiments, a wave group was initially generated as a superposition of two waves with primary and secondary wave steepnesses and close wave numbers, and allowed to evolve. It was shown that the modulation depth decreases {{as a function of the}} primary wave steepness, that distance <b>to</b> <b>breaking</b> also decreases with primary wave steepness, but grows as a function of the ratio of the primary and secondary wave steepnesses...|$|R

The day before the performance, Marge and Ned are again practising the bottle scene as Homer arrives to drive Marge home. Homer repeatedly interrupts the rehearsal.

In defence cavalry {{were used to}} attack and harass the enemy's infantry flanks as they advanced. Cavalry were frequently used prior to an infantry assault, to force an infantry line <b>to</b> <b>break</b> and reform into formations vulnerable to infantry or artillery.

5|$|During the {{courtroom}} sections, the player defends their client and cross-examines the witnesses. They can {{move back and}} forth between the statements in each testimony; if they find a contradiction between a statement and the evidence, they can point out the contradiction by presenting a relevant piece of evidence or character profile. The player can also choose to question a statement, which sometimes leads to changes in the testimony. A life bar, representing the judge's patience, is shown in the upper right corner of the screen. If the player presents incorrect evidence or profiles, the bar will decrease; if it reaches zero, the player loses and their client is declared guilty. The bar will also decrease if the player makes mistakes while trying <b>to</b> <b>break</b> psyche-locks; however, the player can not lose while trying <b>to</b> <b>break</b> psyche-locks. 50% of the life bar gets restored when the player manages <b>to</b> <b>break</b> a psyche-lock, and it gets fully restored when the player completes an episode.|$|E

There were attempts to direct the firefighters through the radio, and soon after the captain requested permission <b>to</b> <b>break</b> a window for ventilation, which was followed by a message that the captain was down.

He and his 18-year-old assistant, Louis-Alexis Jamar, slept in a small room adjacent to the studio; occasionally there were arguments and on one occasion Jamar walked off; after two days Géricault persuaded him to return.

Numerical model results demonstrated good agreement with experimental results in describing the behavior of the distance <b>to</b> <b>breaking</b> and modulation depth as functions of initial wave steepness. It was shown that energy loss appears to be a function of the modulation depth at the breaking onset. Energy loss grows with modulation depth up to a certain threshold of the latter. It was also shown that breaking probability for wave groups with modulation depth below 2. 2 is very low...|$|R
