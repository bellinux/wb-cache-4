5|$|After the {{plaintiff}} rests, <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>lawyer</b> calls Marcy, Al, and Peggy to the stand. She asks Marcy {{a series of}} embarrassing questions, hoping to prove Marcy knew that the camera was there. Her tactic with the Bundys {{is to try to}} prove sexual intercourse did not occur on the videotape. In the end, the Rhoades are awarded $10,000 but the Bundys receive nothing, because the jury does not believe that sex occurred. After everyone exits the courtroom, Al attempts to prove that he can perform when he wants to and has sex with Peggy for hours on the judge's bench, unwittingly while being recorded by the courtroom camera.|$|E

500|$|Illia {{was invited}} in 1975 to a {{diplomatic}} {{mission to the}} Soviet Union; he declined and proposed [...] instead. Upon his return, Alfonsín {{became one of the}} founding members of the Permanent Assembly for Human Rights. He served as <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>lawyer</b> for Mario Roberto Santucho, leader of the ERP guerrillas, but only to carry out due process of law, and not because of a genuine desire to support him. The 1976 Argentine coup d'état against President Isabel Martínez de Perón started the National Reorganization Process. Alfonsín filed several Habeas corpus motions, requesting the freedom of victims of forced disappearances. He also visited other countries, denouncing those disappearances and violations of human rights. He established the magazine Propuesta y control in 1976, one of the few magazines that criticized the military dictatorship during its early stages. The magazine was published up to 1978. His editorials were collected in 1980 in the book La cuestión argentina. He did not support the 1982 Falklands War, and criticized both the Argentine attack and the British counterattack. The Argentine defeat in the war marked the decline of the military dictatorship. The main political parties united in the Multipartidaria, issuing a joint request to the dictatorship to call for elections. Alfonsín proposed the appointment of Arturo Illia as the head of state of a transition government, similar to the Metapolitefsi in Greece. The Movement for Renewal and Change took control of the UCR; Balbín had died the previous year.|$|E

2500|$|Twelve of the {{defendants}} (who {{became known as the}} 'Arkansas Twelve' or 'Elaine Twelve') were convicted of murder and sentenced to death in the electric chair, most of them as [...] "accomplices" [...] in the murder of Adkins at the church. <b>The</b> <b>defense</b> <b>lawyer</b> of one defendant did not interview any witnesses, ask for a change of venue, nor challenge any jurors. The trials of these twelve lasted less than an hour in many cases; the juries took fewer than ten minutes to deliberate before pronouncing each man guilty and sentencing them to death. [...] The Arkansas Gazette applauded the trials as the triumph of the [...] "rule of law," [...] because none of {{the defendants}} was lynched.

2500|$|After the state's four-hour closing, counsel Sam Amirante {{argued for}} the defense. Amirante argued against the {{testimony}} delivered by the doctors who had testified for the prosecution, repeatedly harking towards {{the testimony of the}} four psychiatrists and psychologists who had testified on behalf of the defense. Amirante also accused Sullivan of scarcely referring to the evidence presented throughout the trial in his own closing argument, and of arousing hatred against his client. <b>The</b> <b>defense</b> <b>lawyer</b> attempted to portray Gacy as a [...] "man driven by compulsions he was unable to control". In support of these arguments, the defense counsel repeatedly referred to the testimony of the doctors who had appeared for the defense, in addition to the testimony of defense witnesses such as Jeffrey Rignall and a former business associate of Gacy's named Mickel Reed—both of whom had testified to their belief that Gacy had been unable to control his actions. Amirante then urged the jury to put aside any prejudice they held against his client, and requested they deliver a verdict of {{not guilty by reason of}} insanity, adding that the psychology of Gacy's behavior would be of benefit to scientific research and that the psychology of his mind should be studied.|$|E
2500|$|In May 1977 George and Kathy Lutz filed {{a lawsuit}} against William Weber (<b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>lawyer</b> for Ronald DeFeo, Jr. at his trial), Paul Hoffman (a writer working on an account of the hauntings), Bernard Burton and Frederick Mars (both alleged clairvoyants who had {{examined}} the house), along with Good Housekeeping magazine, the New York Sunday News and the Hearst Corporation, all of which had published articles related to the hauntings. The Lutzes alleged invasion of privacy, misappropriation of names for trade purposes, and mental distress, and claimed $4.5million in damages. Hoffman, Weber, and Burton immediately filed a countersuit for $2million alleging fraud and breach of contract. The claims against the news corporations were dropped for lack of evidence, and the remainder of the lawsuit was heard by Brooklyn U.S. District Court judge Jack B. Weinstein. In September 1979, Judge Weinstein dismissed the Lutzes' claims and observed in his ruling: [...] "Based on what I have heard, it appears to me that to a large extent the book is a work of fiction, relying in a large part upon the suggestions of Mr. Weber." [...] In the September 17, 1979 issue of People magazine, William Weber wrote: [...] "I know this book is a hoax. We created this horror story over many bottles of wine." [...] This refers to a meeting that Weber is said to have had with George and Kathy Lutz, during which they discussed what would later become the outline of Anson's book. Judge Weinstein also expressed concern about the conduct of William Weber and Bernard Burton relating to the affair, stating: [...] "There is a very serious ethical question when lawyers become literary agents." ...|$|E
