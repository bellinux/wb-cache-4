The model takes into consideration the physical and physiological conditions of the workers, the working environment, the nature of the jobs and the minimum rest duration of the government regulation.

40|$|ABSTRACT – The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to analyze the productivity of a Ponsse Ergo harvester using a H 73 head working in a mixed pine and hardwood forest on steep slopes in north Georgia. Productivity data were collected on the harvester from five one square chain plots. Each plot represented a different stand and slope condition. Slopes ranged from 0 to – 46 percent. The harvester was videotaped performing the operations of felling, limbing, and bucking. Time and tree data were extracted for an elemental time study. Estimated quantities were defined in units of time per tree and included move time, swing time, fell time, process time, and <b>total</b> <b>productive</b> time. The possible predictor variables were identified as DBH, total height, number of bucks, tons per acre, trees per acre, slope, and species. Slope was found to be a significant variable for predicting move time, swing time, and <b>total</b> <b>productive</b> time. The variables of DBH 2, total height, slope, and trees per acre with a square-root inverse transformation were found to be significant for predicting <b>total</b> <b>productive</b> time per tree when total height was known. Number of bucks, tons per acre, and species were found to be non-significant variables for predicting any of the dependent variables. It was not surprising that slope had an effect on the productivity of the harvester. Interestingly though, the analysis found species variation to be non-significant for predicting any of the analyzed dependent variables. That is to say that even on steep slopes, the Ponsse Ergo harvester harvested upland, hard hardwoods equally as well as pine...|$|R

The results of such use are relevant and its use in academic area found. However, regarding to its use in industrial environments, studies can´t not be found. With this scenario, and based on the perception of the ergonomist about the importance of using methods such as mind maps in support of human cognition, it seems pertinent to its use in industry sectors whose cognitive demand requires. Given these assumptions, this study aimed to apply the method of Mind Maps in <b>Productive</b> <b>Maintenance</b> sector of a Brazilian paper. The <b>Productive</b> <b>Maintenance</b> sector in the Paper Industry has an important contribution to operational performance. With practical Predictive Maintenance, Preventive Maintenance and Corrective Maintenance, the industry advocates to make the machines to produce paper is not to stop producing when they are programmed to do so. Among the practices cited, the Preventive Maintenance is one that leads to pre-determined intervals in order to reduce the possibility of placing the equipment in a condition below the required level of acceptance. Therefore, this article aims to propose using the tool "mental maps " in order to collaborate in planning and implementation of preventive maintenance activities in the sector of mechanical maintenance of a pulp and paper industry in southern Brazil.
