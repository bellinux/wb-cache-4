The removal of Pb in consumer paint products and gasoline has already been undertaken.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the thermal fatigue {{reliability}} of fine pitch flip-chip BGA packages employing multi-layer organic built-up substrates with an integral heat spreader. For high density FPGA devices, the die size and package footprint are larger than the prevailing industry standard, this poses a significant challenge for meeting component level temperature cycle condition B (- 55 ˚C to + 125 ˚C) reliability requirements. Finite element modeling (FEM) is a key component for identifying high stress regions and identifying solutions to long term reliability problems. FEM was used to study two different material combinations where the heat spreader/stiffener attach adhesive and thermal interface materials (TIM) were changed. Temperature cycle tests were performed on both material sets. A secondary goal {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effects of the substrate land pad geometry and moisture preconditioning.

Major drawbacks of this process are the poor thickness uniformity across the substrates and the bad reproducibility.

Face-to-face silicon (Si) dies stacking is one of the three dimensional (3 D) packaging technologies to form a high density module. In this work, a chip level stacked module was demonstrated for medical application and assessed its package level reliability. The chip level stack module is achieved by stacking two thin dies of different size and thickness together using flip chip technology with micro bump interconnects. Electrical simulations are carried out to obtain RLC parameters of micro bump interconnect and complete interconnection from daughter die to substrate. Mechanical simulations are also carried out to study the stress analysis on micro bumps and CSP bumps in the package and parametric study of stacked module package to study the effect of substrate material, underfill material die thicknesses on package reliability and warpage. Test chips are designed and fabricated with daisy chain test structures to access the reliability of the stack module.

40|$|Integrated Circuit (IC) sockets provide {{hundreds}} {{to thousands}} of electrical interconnects in enterprise servers, where quality and reliability are critical for customer applications. The evaluation of IC sockets, according to current industry practices, relies on the execution of stress loads and stress levels that are defined by standards, having no consideration to the physics of failure (PoF), target operating environment, or contact resistance behavior over time. In a similar manner, monitoring of contact resistance during system operation has no considerations to the PoF or environmental conditions. In this dissertation a physics of failure approach was developed to model the reliability of elastomer sockets {{that are used in}} an enterprise server application. The temperature and relative humidity environment, at the IC socket contact interface, were characterized as a function of external environmental conditions and microprocessor activity. The study applied state-of-the-art health monitoring techniques to assess thermal gradients on the IC socket assembly and to establish an operating profile {{that could be used for}} the development of a PoF model. A methodology was developed for modeling and monitoring contact resistance of electrical interconnects. The technique combined a PoF model with the Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT). In the methodology the resistance behavior is characterized as a function of temperature. The effective a-spot radius was extracted from the characterization data and modeled with a power-law. A PoF model was developed to estimate the resistance of an elastomer contact, based on the effective a-spot radius and the ambient temperature. The methodology was experimentally demonstrated with a <b>temperature</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>test</b> of the elastomer socket. During the evaluation the difference between estimated and observed resistance values were tested with the SPRT. The technique was shown to be very accurate for modeling contact resistance and to be highly sensitive for the detection of resistance degradation. A qualitative reliability model was developed for the mean contact resistance of an elastomer socket, using fundamental material properties and user defined failure criteria. To derive the model, the resistance behavior of contacts under nominal mechanical load was studied as a function of time and temperature. The elastomer contact was shown to have a very complex resistance behavior, which was modeled by multiple statistical distributions. It was shown that elastomer sockets, in spite of experiencing stress relaxation at the macroscale (elastomer), can exhibit decreases in contact resistance, a result of stress redistribution at the microscale (Ag particles), which increases Ag-Ag particle stress and the effective contact area...|$|E

40|$|Light {{emitting}} diodes (LEDs) {{are today}} a standard and mature method to produce light. Moreover, {{due to the}} advantages of LEDs compared to standard light bulbs, e. g. the high energy efficiency, small weight and size, they will become dominant and replace standard light bulbs in many applications. In addition, the LEDs can have a very long lifetime and therefore they have an advantage for all application where the exchange of the light source is very costly as for outdoor and building lighting. Also for automotive applications an important design advantage is achieved by LED light sources with â€œcar lifetimeâ€ 9 ̆d because they donâ€™t need to be accessible for replacement any more. However, poor LED quality and wrong system design undermines the advantage and has put {{the reliability of the}} LED system on the agenda. Thermo mechanical stress due to temperature cycle causes failure of electronic systems. The electronic component itself or the interconnect device, e. g. printed circuit board (PCB) might fail. However, in many cases the interconnect between package and the board, e. g. solder interconnect, is the weakest link in the system. Cracking of the interconnect causes an open contact and the system fails. In the paper we compare the existing methods to investigate the failure of LED interconnects during temperature cycle tests, e. g. simple â€œlight on testâ€ 9 ̆d, electric resistance measurement and shear test. We introduce the transient thermal analysis as measurement method for solder joint reliability and show that the resolution is significantly higher compared to the existing standard methods. Typically, the transient thermal analysis is used to measure the thermal resistance of a package. It is very often still seen as complicated and time intensive measurement method. However, we show that for package and interconnect integrity analysis during <b>temperature</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>test</b> the measurement effort is small, actually itâ€™s almost as simple as an electric resistance measurement. The voltage to drive a defined current is measured time resolved for a short time interval. A current source with response time down to 1 Âµs and a data acquisition system with sampling time of 1 MHz is required. We explain the data evaluation, i. e. how to process the measurement data at the cycle number n and how to compare them with the zero cycle measurement data to obtain the information of the package integrity. We derive from theory, i. e. from the behavior of the transfer function of the thermal system, that the linear factors like power step and k-factor are not required and do not be measured to obtain accurate data. In the paper we present reliability data, i. e. thermal air to air thermal shock test 40 Â°C/ 125 Â°C, for ceramic high power LED packages on Al-IMS analyzed by electric resistance measurement, thermal analysis and cross-sections. We demonstrate the sensitivity of the thermal analysis to detect solder joint cracking and thermal degradation of the system...|$|E
40|$|Electronics {{packaging}} must {{be designed}} to meet the increasing requirements of the microelectronics industry. Future packages will have an even higher number of I/O's and pitches down to 20 microns resulting in high dissipation losses and extreme current densities. When using conventional materials, design engineers will face physical barriers and limitations in performance and new material solutions have to be found. Reliable interconnects are a major concern of packaging technologies. The steadily increasing mechanical, thermal and electrical loadings open up new areas research. One way to solve the problems of future electronics is the use of nanotechnologies and nanomaterials. Among the world's most researched materials are carbon nanotubes (CNTs) [1 - 5]. CNTs have excellent thermal, electrical and mechanical properties. They can be used in various ways. One researched field of application are CNT-polymer composites which combine common technologies with advanced materials. This paper focuses on the latest results obtained for CNT-filled adhesives for electronics packaging and compares the new materials with conventional, electrical Ag-filled conductive adhesives. Based on previous investigations on CNT-epoxy composites [1 - 4], a comprehensive study of the mechanical, electrical and thermal properties of selected promising candidates was conducted. Additionally, the performance of the novel composites as conductive adhesives in electronics packages was included in the evaluation. In preliminary investigations, the bulk properties were studied for the cured and uncured states of the materials. The rheological properties (viscosity vs. rate, amplitude) were critically compared for the screen printing performance for the electronics manufacturing process. To determine the effect of the differently modified fillers in the adhesive, an amplitude sweep and a frequency sweep were performed using the rheometer "Rheostress 600 " (Haake). From the results it is obvious that- the different filler materials and volume fraction are very influential parameters. The viscosity shown was changed by the filler fraction and the surface modification of the CNTs. Another factor are the thermo-mechanical properties of the bulk materials in the cured state. Polymers are known to exhibit viscoelastic behaviour which is much more complex than that of elastic materials. As for viscoelastic materials, deformation time or frequency influences the reaction of the material. Internal stresses can be reduced by relaxation. The Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA) was applied to determine the temperature and time dependent modulus for the composites. Additional tension and torsion tests were performed to check the consistency of the results. An alternative ultrasonic method was critically benchmarked against mechanical methods. The combination of different test procedures helps gather advanced information on the thermal mechanical behaviour of the adhesive, which is important for future applications in the automotive and aviation industry, for example. Dissipating thermal loss in miniaturized electronic packages is a major challenge for performance issues. The conductivity of the filled adhesives is determined by a laser flash system to get information about their improved thermal properties. It allows measuring the thermal diffusivity of the composite which can be used to calculate the thermal conductivity. Concerning the electrical properties, a test board was used to measure thin film resistance as well as contact resistance of electrical components. The test board structures were manufactured in thick film and printed wiring board (PWB) technologies and cover a wide application range. The PWBs had a chemical tin surface finish on standard FR 4 substrate. The thick film application was done on gold metallization. The components were zero Ohm resistors in the sizes 0805 - 0402 with tin finish. Different environmental conditions are critical for the technical reliability of adhesive conductive elements. For investigating the moisture and thermal cycle stability of the adhesive joints, a relative humidity test (85 % r. h. / 85 °C) and a <b>temperature</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>test</b> (- 40 °C/ 125 °C) were performed.

In this study, the resulting effects of post-mold curing (PMC) on the thermomechanical and chemical properties of different mold compounds were observed. Polymer systems of the investigated mold compounds were based on two orthocresol novolacs (OCN), one biphenyl and one multifunctional resin (MFR). It could be shown, that longer thermal treatment after curing leads in general to further cross-linking of the polymer chains and increases the glass transition temperature Tg. Therefore, the temperature resistance of the mold for following process steps after package assembling, like soldering, can be improved as well as the reliability during <b>temperature</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>tests.</b> However, PMC treatment also increases the moisture absorption.

Cells are {{fabricated}} {{in an industrial}} like environment; the interconnection tabs are applied by bonding a conductive adhesive film; modules are made with an industrial type laminator. To our knowledge these are the first modules made from cells with this architecture. The main benefits of this module structure are that the conductive film used for bonding the tabbing is completely lead free, already fulfilling now future RoHS standards (restriction of hazardous substances). Additionally, the cells are completely boron-free which guarantees stable efficiencies when exposed to light. We evaluate different interconnection schemes focusing on the rear side. For that purpose the already fired Al paste on the rear is locally abrased and an interconnection tab is applied by conductive film bonding. With this simple method shunting of the Al emitter has been avoided and the interconnection of cells to strings can be realised with one less process step as compared to conventional p-type Al BSF cell production. Using the above mentioned cells and methods we produced one-cell-modules to prove stable cell interconnection.

40|$|Cracked die is {{a serious}} failure mode in the Light Emitting Diode (LED) {{industry}} – affecting LED quality and long-term reliability performance. In this paper an investigation {{has been carried out}} to find the correlation between severe cracked germanium (Ge) substrate of an aluminum indium gallium phosphate (AlInGaP) LED and its electro-optical performance after the <b>Temperature</b> <b>Cycle</b> (TC) <b>test.</b> The LED dice were indented at several bond forces using a die bonder. The indented dice were analysed using a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). The result showed that severe cracks were observed at 180 gF onward. As the force of indentation increases, crack formation also becomes more severe thus resulting in the chipping of the substrate. The cracked dies were packaged and the TC test was performed. The results did not show any electro-optical failure or degradation, even after a 1000 <b>cycle</b> TC <b>test.</b> Several mechanically cross-sectioned cracked die LEDs, were analysed using SEM and found that no crack reached the active layer. This shows that severely cracked Ge substrate are able to withstand a − 40 °C/+ 100 °C TC test up to 1000 cycles and LED optical performance is not affected. A small leakage current was observed in all of the cracked die LEDs in comparison to the reference unit. However, this value is smaller than the product specification and is of no concern...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{performance}} {{results of the}} RedFlow zinc-bromide module (ZBM) Gen 2. 0 are reported for Phase 1 of testing, which includes initial characterization of the module. This included physical measurement, efficiency {{as a function of}} charge and discharge rates, efficiency as a function of maximum charge capacity, duration of maximum power supplied, and limited cycling with skipped strip cycles. The goal of this first phase of testing was to verify manufacturer specifications of the zinc-bromide flow battery. Initial characterization tests have shown that the ZBM meets the manufacturer's specifications. Further testing, including testing as a function of <b>temperature</b> and life <b>cycle</b> <b>testing,</b> will be carried out during Phase 2 of the testing, and these results will be issued in the final report, after Phase 2 testing has concluded...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} {{we present a}} new {{experimental}} set-up leading to characterize SAW sensor properties in high temperature up to 900 °C. The characterization method consists in hanging {{a small piece of}} self-warming piezoelectric SAW device in a vacuum chamber. The device is made of the piezoelectric material to be tested equipped with its IDT plus a heating resistance, both in Platinum. The whole system is suspended from a PCB by mean of classical bonding wires. It is therefore thermally isolated {{from the rest of the}} experimental set-up. This allows using standard low-cost circuitry, to connect the SAW device to the measurement apparatus (standard coaxial feed-lines and SMA connectors). The warming being localised on the piezoelectric substrate, it also becomes possible to reach very high temperature, quickly and at low energy cost. This allows easy making of <b>temperature</b> <b>cycles</b> to <b>test</b> the aging of materials. In a first step, TCF values for Quartz ST and LiNbO 3 Y- 128 ° were measured in the range [20 - 500 °C], then compared to calculated ones in order to validate the method. In a second step, one LGS Y-X SAW delay line with Pt/Ta IDT was characterized using this test method in the range [20 - 900 °C]...|$|R
40|$|The {{high cycle}} and very {{high cycle fatigue}} {{properties}} of the titanium alloy Ti 6 Al 4 V with a duplex mi-crostructure were investigated at room <b>temperature.</b> High <b>cycle</b> fatigue <b>tests</b> were performed {{in the range from}} 104 to 107 cycles by rotating bending at the frequency of 30 Hz. The very high <b>cycle</b> fatigue <b>tests</b> were carried out in the range from 107 to 1010 cycles in tension-compression on an ultrasonic fatigue testing machine at the frequency of 20 kHz. The stress amplitude was found to decrease with increasing number of cycles in the whole range from 104 up to 109 cycles and only at the highest number of cycles (NF = 10 9) the alloy exhibits the fatigue limit of 460 MPa. The detail fractographic analysis was performed to characterize the fatigue failure mechanisms. Both subsurface and surface crack initiation were observed in very high cycle fatigue region. No inclusions, but only local chemical inhomogeneity in microstructure was observed at the locations of subsurface fatigue crack initiation in alpha-grains...|$|R
40|$|Reliability is of {{increasing}} importance for electronics systems operating at harsh environments, {{such as the}} electronic telecommunication systems used at subsea level. The aim {{of this research was}} to investigate the reliability of such electronic systems through a simulated accelerated thermal <b>cycle</b> <b>test.</b> The paper presents a step-by-step process of designing accelerated thermal <b>cycle</b> <b>test</b> using field operating conditions. The Coffin-Mansion equation was used to calculate the accelerated factor for the thermal <b>cycle</b> <b>test.</b> In order to simulate the expected life time of 25 years, the solder assembly samples were subjected to 400 <b>temperature</b> <b>cycles,</b> with every cycle lasting for 40 minutes. Reliability was determined by measuring shear strengths of solder joints of different electronic components at set intervals. Although some of the components showed an initial decrease in shear strength, it was generally concluded that the electronic assemblies are able to maintain their shear strength for up to 25 years. The fracture surfaces of the solder joints, after shear testing, were also analyzed for brittle and ductile fractures, with the use of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) ...|$|R
40|$|Objective of {{the project}} was the {{development}} of preparation and assembling techniques for a lead free solder alloy exemplary for flip chip technology. The requirements of electronic applications has been transferred to material requirements, which have been input parameters for a literature survey. A number of about 20 tin based alloys hit coarsely. In a screen process the selected candidates were tested for there interactions with electronic conductor materials as copper and aluminum. Main test criterias have been wetting behavior, dissolving and corrosion. An eutectic silver tin alloy showed the best results with respect to the test criterias. The development of direct galvanic deposition of this alloy was a big challenge because of the big difference in redox potential. A technology demonstrator has been successful realized which demonstrates all the developed processes. After <b>temperature</b> <b>cycles</b> and environment <b>tests</b> the reliability of the developed lead free flip chip process has been demonstrated. (orig.)
