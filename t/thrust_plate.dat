5000|$|To speed {{development}} of Juno V, the engines {{were attached to}} a single <b>thrust</b> <b>plate,</b> and supplied fuel from a cluster of tanks taken from the existing Jupiter and Redstone missile airframes.

5000|$|Koelle's {{solution}} to reducing the development time {{was to use}} a cluster of fuel tanks from Redstone and Jupiter missiles, sit them {{on top of a}} single <b>thrust</b> <b>plate,</b> and then attach the required engines {{to the bottom of the}} plate. Calculations demonstrated that a total thrust of about 1 million pounds would be needed, greatly limiting their engine selection. Looking for suitable designs, Koelle learned of the E-1 from Rocketdyne's George Sutton. Rocketdyne was developing this 400000 lbf kN engine for the Titan missile, and it was the largest engine nearing introduction within the time frame that ARPA gave Wernher von Braun to develop what was then known as the [...] "Juno V". The E-1 had originally been developed as a backup engine for the Titan missile, designed specifically to be as simple to develop as possible, in case the Aerojet General LR-87 did not pan out.|$|E
50|$|Wernher von Braun's {{team at the}} U.S. Army Ballistic Missile Agency (ABMA) started {{studying}} the problem in April 1957. They calculated that a rocket with the required performance would require a lower-stage booster with a thrust of about 1.5 million pound-force (6.7 MN) thrust at takeoff. As it happened, the Air Force had recently started work on just such an engine, eventually emerging as the F-1, but {{this would not be}} available in the time frame that the DoD was demanding and would be limited to about 1 million lbf in the short term anyway. Another possibility was a Rocketdyne engine, then known as the E-1, which provided about 360,000 to 380000 lbf kN, four of which would reach the required thrust levels. This approach became the favorite, and in order to quickly provide fuel tankage to supply the engines, a new stage consisting of the tank from a Jupiter wrapped with eight taken from the Redstone would be used along with a <b>thrust</b> <b>plate</b> on the bottom where the engines would be attached.|$|E
5000|$|There are two {{principal}} facies of lower Paleozoic rocks in Nevada. [...] In {{the eastern part}} of the state, a north-trending fossil-rich carbonate shelf of Ordovician to Devonian age, termed the carbonate or eastern assemblage, gives way westward to a contemporaneous expanse of siliceous sedimentary deposits and minor mafic volcanic rocks termed the siliceous or western assemblage. Crafford assigned these two facies respectively to the shelf domain and the basin domain. [...] The dark color of the western assemblage, the scarcity of carbonate rocks, and a near absence of shelly fossils, are generally interpreted to indicate a relatively deep-water depositional environment. [...] The western assemblage also differs from the eastern assemblage in its components of bedded chert, basalt bodies, barite deposits, and sulfide deposits. The nature of the two assemblages and their relation to one another are critical for an understanding of the Antler orogeny. The western facies assemblage is generally thought to be displaced from the west and to constitute the upper plate of an extensive thrust faultâ€”the Roberts Mountains thrust. The eastern facies assemblage is thought to extend westward under the <b>thrust</b> <b>plate.</b> [...] The basis for this belief is that the western facies domain is dotted with anomalous blocky exposures of contemporaneous eastern facies shelf strata, some of mountain size, surrounded by exposures of western facies rocks. These have been interpreted almost universally as exposures of the carbonate shelf facies in windows of the Roberts Mountains thrust sheet, and to prove the existence of that thrust sheet.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 125 - 129) Eastern Sierran wall {{rocks in}} the central portion of the Slate Range have undergone several phases of Mesozoic deformation resulting in the folding and faulting of Permian (?) - Triassic (?) metasedimentary and metavolcanic rocks. Additionally, five phases of pre-, syn- and(or) post-tectonic intrusion occurred in the study area. Five generations of folding are recognized, several of which are correlative with regionally recognized structures. Early-formed fold generations, F 1, F 2 and F 3, are oriented in a northeasterly direction. Axial plane cleavage is developed only in the F 1 generation. Fold trends changed to a northwesterly direction during the F 4 generation which also has a poorly developed axial plane cleavage. The F 5 generation is pervasive and is represented by kink folds, warps and minor folds. F 1 folds are cut by west-trending strike- and oblique-slip faults, and both folds and faults are truncated by the northwest-striking Ophir thrust fault, which has been refolded about a N. 50 ??W. orientation by the F 4 fold generation. Three other minor thrust faults associated with this compressional phase also developed.

40|$|Previous studies [Refs. 1, 2] {{revealed}} {{the formation of}} a uniform oil wedge at the periphery of the <b>thrust</b> <b>plate,</b> caused by the elastic deformation of the orbiting <b>thrust</b> <b>plate</b> due to the pressure difference across the orbiting <b>thrust</b> <b>plate,</b> is a significant factor in the high lubrication performance in thrust slide-bearings. In addition to the uniform wedge formation, the high oil film pressure also induces a local elastic deformation of the fixed <b>thrust</b> <b>plate</b> normal to its surface. The normal <b>thrust</b> <b>plate</b> deformation and the oil wedge effectively form an elasto-hydrodynamic-lubrication (EHL) pocket, even more effectively increasing the oil film pressure between the sliding surfaces, due to the envelopment of the oil, as confirmed in our companion paper [3], and an earlier, less-detailed contribution [4]. The present study focuses on aspects of EHL that have both positive and negative effects on the lubrication performance of the thrust slide-bearings in scroll compressors. Theoretical calculations using the average Reynolds equation and Patier-Chen solid contact theory, for the boundary of the local elastic deformation of the thrust slide-bearing, were conducted for a small cooling capacity scroll compressor driven at 3600 rpm with 0. 1 kW.

Subjects: Sixty-one patients undergoing total hip replacement with <b>thrust</b> <b>plate</b> prosthesis. Design: Patients were evaluated preoperatively and six months postoperatively by four different hip rating systems (Harris, Iowa, Charnley and Merle d'Aubigne), both on a categorical and on a numerical basis. Setting: Department of orthopaedics and traumatology in a university hospital. Main outcome measures: Patients were evaluated by four rating systems preoperatively and postoperatively either on a categorical or a numerical basis. Results: All patients showed significant improvement after surgery in all rating systems. Although preoperative categorical evaluation revealed that the strongest correlation was between Charnley and Merle d'Aubigne scores (r = 0. 876), numerical comparison of the rating systems showed strong correlation among all systems, both pre- and postoperatively. Responsiveness analysis revealed larger effect size for the Iowa and Harris hip scores.
