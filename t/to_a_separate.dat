5|$|From {{the moment}} of its {{founding}} the school was marred in controversy due to Senator Douglas's support of slavery and his authorship of the Kansas-Nebraska Act. Early fundraising efforts were further hampered as Douglas {{came under heavy fire}} during the run-up to the 1860 presidential election for his ownership of 123 slaves and a 3000-acre cotton plantation in Lawrence County, Mississippi. In response, trustees further encumbered the land to fund the university's operations while funneling cash donations <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>separate</b> account for what is today the University of Chicago Divinity School (which temporarily moved <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>separate</b> campus in Morgan Park before rejoining the larger university in its current location in Hyde Park location in 1891).|$|E
5|$|The {{ground of}} fettering {{discretion}} {{on this basis}} is distinct from {{the right to a}} fair hearing. The latter relates <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>separate</b> ground of judicial review, namely, procedural impropriety, and particularly the audi alteram partem ("hear the other side") principle.|$|E
5|$|Behnke in his {{salmon and}} trout {{handbook}} of 2002 recognized 14 subspecies of cutthroat trout that are each native <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>separate</b> geographic area. Not {{all of them were}} scientifically described, and different views on the taxonomic identities have been presented in some cases. It has been suggested that the cutthroat trout evolved from a common Oncorhynchus ancestor that migrated along the Pacific coast and into the mountain west primarily via the Columbia and Snake river basins 3-5million years ago, in the late Pliocene or early Pleistocene epochs. These epochs had repeated glacial and interglacial periods that would have caused repeated fracturing and isolation of cutthroat trout populations, eventually resulting in the different subspecies found today. The 14 subspecies are found in four evolutionary groups—Coastal, Westslope, Yellowstone and Lahontan.|$|E

5|$|Considering the {{response}} to be unsatisfactory, de Gaulle began constructing an independent defence force for his country. He wanted to give France, {{in the event of}} an East German incursion into West Germany, the option of coming <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>separate</b> peace with the Eastern bloc instead of being drawn into a larger NATO–Warsaw Pact war. In February 1959, France withdrew its Mediterranean Fleet from NATO command, and later banned the stationing of foreign nuclear weapons on French soil. This caused the United States to transfer two hundred military aircraft out of France and return control of the air force bases that it had operated in France since 1950 to the French by 1967.|$|E
5|$|David E. Starkey and {{collaborators}} advanced a {{new view}} of the subspecies in 2003. Based on {{a study of the}} mitochondrial DNA, they rejected the glacial development theory and argued that the southern painted turtle should be elevated <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>separate</b> species, C. dorsalis, while the other subspecies should be collapsed into one and not differentiated. However, this proposition was largely unrecognized because successful breeding between all subspecies was documented wherever they overlapped. Nevertheless, in 2010, the IUCN recognized both C. dorsalis and C.p.dorsalis as valid names for the southern painted turtle.|$|E
5|$|Each 22-minute episode takes {{approximately}} {{a year to}} complete; three to four episodes are produced simultaneously. Storyboard artists depict scenes using SketchBook Pro. Adapting these boards to limited animation, studio DHX Media handles the designs, poses and key frames of movement for each character appearing in a given scene for an episode, as well as background art. DHX hands these assets <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>separate</b> studio, where the remaining animation is finished using Adobe Flash. The speed of production is throttled slightly by Blythe having two unique outfits per episode, according to director Joel Dickie. Supervising director Dallas Parker similarly explained that the variety of assets created for each episode challenged the process of Flash animation in reusing movements.|$|E

5|$|Following the war, Isaac Shelby {{relocated}} to Kentucky, on lands awarded {{to him for}} his military service, and became involved in Kentucky's transition from a county of Virginia, <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>separate</b> state. His heroism made him popular with the state's citizens and the Kentucky electoral college unanimously elected him governor in 1792. He secured Kentucky, from Indian attacks and organized its first government. He used the Citizen Genet affair to convince the Washington administration to make {{an agreement with the}} Spanish for free trade on the Mississippi River.|$|E
5|$|For the {{interior}} scenes used {{to depict the}} first moments of the Impala being hit, the actors were required {{to sit in the}} car in front of a blue screen; this allowed for the truck's headlights to later be added in with visual effects. The car itself was attached <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>separate</b> rig that was built to replicate the impact of the crash. As the scene was shot, the rig flipped the car onto its side. The passenger-side window was then shattered, though the actors were protected by a sheet of Lexan that had been placed very close to the window; at the same time, cannons beneath the frame blew out pieces of rubber glass to give the appearance that the window had exploded onto them.|$|E
5|$|In September 1937 the German {{government}} again {{requested that}} Lody's body be exhumed and moved <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>separate</b> grave. This proved impractical for several reasons; {{he had been}} buried with seven other men, each coffin had been cemented down and the lapse of time would make identification very difficult. Instead, the British Imperial War Graves Commission suggested that a memorial should be constructed {{in another part of}} the cemetery to bear the names of all the German civilians who were buried there. The proposal met with German agreement and the memorial was duly installed. During the Second World War, Lody's original headstone was destroyed by misaimed Luftwaffe bombs. It was replaced in 1974.|$|E

5|$|In the Time Room, Prismo reveals to Jake that Finn {{has been}} transported <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>separate,</b> altered world {{based on his}} wish that The Lich never existed. Together, they watch the events in Finn's world on Prismo's television, and Prismo asks Jake what {{he would like to}} wish for. Jake wishes for a sandwich, but Prismo urges him to {{consider}} using his wish on something important, such as helping Finn. Jake tells Prismo he will use it when he knows Finn will be in real danger, and after a conversation, the two decide to hang out; Prismo mutes the TV and the two begin to ignore the events happening in Finn's timeline.|$|E
5|$|Linnaeus, who {{classified}} most {{kinds of}} sessile animals {{as belonging to}} the order Zoophyta in the class Vermes, mistakenly identified the genus Spongia as plants in the order Algae. For a long time thereafter sponges were assigned <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>separate</b> subkingdom, Parazoa ("beside the animals"), separate from the Eumetazoa which formed {{the rest of the}} kingdom Animalia. They have been regarded as a paraphyletic phylum, from which the higher animals have evolved. Other research indicates Porifera is monophyletic.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the tombs}} are {{not open to}} the public (18 of the tombs can be opened, but they are rarely open at the same time), and {{officials}} occasionally close those that are open for restoration work. The number of visitors to KV62 has led <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>separate</b> charge for entry into the tomb. The West Valley has only one open tomb—that of Ay—and a separate ticket is needed to visit this tomb. The tour guides are no longer allowed to lecture inside the tombs, and visitors are expected to proceed quietly and in single file through the tombs. This is to minimize time in the tombs and prevent the crowds from damaging the surfaces of the decoration. Photography is no longer allowed in the tombs.|$|E

5|$|Nash's {{designs for}} the house {{included}} a three-storey octagonal tower, with two wings coming off it and a second square tower above a porte-cochère. Inside the drawing room occupied {{the ground floor of}} the tower, with a sitting room above. The dining room was designed to hold views across the valley, and the asymmetric rooms allowed for a panorama of views. To allow easy access to the gardens, the servant's quarters were moved <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>separate</b> wing, but made to be less prominent. A chapel was added in approximately 1862, and the house's loggia was converted into a conservatory.|$|E
5|$|Qapital is a {{personal}} finance mobile application (app) for the iOS and Android operating systems, developed by Qapital Inc. The app is designed to motivate users to save money through a gamification of their spending behavior. It moves money from a user's checking account <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>separate</b> Qapital account, when certain rules are triggered. Its database is used by psychology professor Dan Ariely to study consumer behavior. Qapital was released in Sweden in 2013, then in the US in early 2015. The application was later withdrawn from the Swedish market in April 2015, in order {{to focus on the}} US market.|$|E
5|$|The College of Environmental Science and Forestry (ESF) {{has a long}} {{affiliation}} with Syracuse University, shares many campus resources, and operates its main academic campus immediately adjacent to Syracuse University. ESF was founded in 1911 as the New York State College of Forestry at Syracuse University, {{under the leadership of}} Syracuse University Trustee Louis Marshall, with the active support of Syracuse University Chancellor Day. Its founding followed the Governor's veto of annual appropriations <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>separate</b> New York State College of Forestry at Cornell.|$|E

5|$|The Solnhofen Specimen (unnumbered specimen) was {{discovered}} in the 1970s near Eichstätt, Germany, and described in 1988 by Wellnhofer.

It is the largest specimen known and may belong <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>separate</b> genus and species, Wellnhoferia grandis. It is missing only portions of the neck, tail, backbone, and head.|$|E
5|$|They speak a dialect of Sri Lankan Tamil {{that is used}} in the region. During {{religious}} festivals, {{people who}} enter a trance or spirit possession sometimes use a mixed language that contains words from the Vedda language. Most Vedar are Hindu Saivites and worship a plethora of folk deities, as well as the main Hindu deities such as Murugan, Pillaiyar and Amman. They also maintain the ancestor worship tradition of the interior Veddas. Clan divisions, if they still exist, do not {{play an important role in}} choosing of marriage partners or place of domicile. Most identify themselves as a caste among the Tamils as opposed <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>separate</b> ethnic group. Their economic conditions have been impacted by the Sri Lankan civil war.|$|E
5|$|Those {{targets that}} did {{pose a threat}} {{automatically}} triggered the switch to engagement mode. This created a new beam constantly aimed at the target, sweeping its focus point through the threat tube to pick out individual objects within it. Data from these beams extracted velocity data <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>separate</b> computer to attempt {{to pick out the}} warhead as the decoys slowed in the atmosphere. Only one Coherent Signal Processing System (CSPS) was ever built, and for testing it was connected to the Zeus Discrimination Radar on Kwajalein.|$|E
