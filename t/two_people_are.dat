5|$|Traditionally, Hyderabadi haleem {{is cooked}} {{on a low}} flame of {{firewood}} for up to 12 hours in a bhatti (a cauldron covered with a brick and mud kiln). One or <b>two</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> required to stir it continuously with wooden paddles throughout its preparation. For home-made Hyderabadi haleem, a Ghotni (a wooden hand masher) is used to stir it until it reaches a sticky-smooth consistency, similar to minced meat.|$|E
5|$|September 15, 1999– Hurricane Floyd {{parallels}} {{the shore of}} the Delmarva Peninsula as a tropical storm. Chestertown, reports a maximum rainfall total of 14inches (350mm), with other locales reporting similar values. Extreme river flooding causes moderate damage to bridges and roads, resulting in a damage toll of $7.9million (1999USD, $10million 2008USD) throughout the state. In addition, over 250,000 residents are without electricity because of high winds blowing down power lines. More than 28people are forced to be rescued by boat as a result of severe flooding. Nine other people were from an apartment building near Great Mills. <b>Two</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> injured and one person is killed by carbon monoxide after losing power and running a generator inside their home. Also, a 12‑year-old boy is caught in flood waters and is swept a half mile (800m) down a drainage ditch before being rescued and treated for hypothermia.|$|E

25|$|The condition, whether {{resulting}} from cerebellar malformation or injury, results in incomplete cerebral development and no <b>two</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> affected {{in the same}} way. In general, cerebral palsy is a physical impairment that affects posture {{and the development of}} movement. Ataxic cerebral palsy in particular, is manifested in the performance of movements with abnormal force, rhythm, and accuracy. Patients have hypotonia (decreased muscle tone), signs of ataxia (loss of full control of bodily movement), impaired balance and coordination, intention tremors, and a wide-based gait (in walking patients).|$|E
25|$|One {{problem with}} the thinkings of Rawls {{is that it is}} overly {{procedural}} as found in defenders of natural law. Procedurally fair processes of the type used by Rawls may not leave enough room for judgment, and therefore, reduce the totality of goodness. For example, if <b>two</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> found to own an orange, the standard fair procedure is to cut it in two and give half to each. However, if one wants to eat it while the other wants the rind to flavor a cake, cutting it in two is clearly less good than giving the peel to the baker and feeding the core to the eater.|$|E
25|$|After Valentino's {{remains were}} taken by train from New York to California, a second funeral was held on the West Coast, at the Catholic Church of the Good Shepherd in Beverly Hills. Valentino had no final burial {{arrangements}} and his friend June Mathis arranged a temporary solution when she offered a crypt that she had purchased for the husband that she had since divorced. Coincidentally, she died the following year and was interred in the adjoining crypt that she had purchased for herself; Valentino was never {{moved to a new}} location and he remained in the crypt next to Mathis. The <b>two</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> still interred side-by-side at Hollywood Forever Cemetery (originally Hollywood Memorial Park Cemetery) in Hollywood, California.|$|E

25|$|In {{another attempt}} to help their situation, {{a small group of}} volunteers take a trip to the {{neighboring}} pharmacy to gather medical supplies. However, things go horribly wrong and <b>two</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> killed by giant spiders, causing {{most of the people in}} the market to side with Mrs. Carmody. Two soldiers commit suicide, and a third, Private Jessup, reveals that the local military base was filled with rumors about the Arrowhead Project, the government's attempt to look into other dimensions, and that the scientists responsible for the experiment may have inadvertently opened a doorway into a dimension containing the creatures that are now invading the town. Mrs. Carmody convinces her followers to blame Jessup and he is stabbed and ejected from the store, quickly falling prey to a large praying mantis-like creature.|$|E

500|$|We {{wanted to}} make a {{specific}} story about two people—Meg and Dom—not a video that was representative of all couples or all domestic violence situations. I'm not saying that all couples fight this way.

I think we make far too much of it. After all, one's genitals are just one important part of the magnificent human body ... I contend that SEX IS SEX and LOVE IS LOVE. When combined, they work well together, if <b>two</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> of about the same mind. But they are really two discrete needs and should be treated as such. Time and space will not permit me to expound further, especially {{in the area of the}} psyche. I don't believe in overly moralistic philosophies. Have your sex, it can be exciting, if you're lucky. I hope the music that I present here makes you lucky." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{one of his}} concerts, Gautham sees one of {{the three}} men and chases him. Sameera, a {{journalist}} at the concert, films Gautham fighting his imaginary opponent. Gautham surrenders to the police after [...] "killing" [...] the man, confessing that he killed three men: one in Belfast, one in Pune and one just now in Hyderabad. He is released from custody after Sameera broadcasts the video on television. According to his doctor, if Gautham can hallucinate a person other than the three men, he can be treated. Gautham goes to Goa on vacation. Sameera stalks him, convincing him that <b>two</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> stalking him: a journalist who wants to interview him (imaginary), and a person claiming to be his fan (real). Gautham begins {{to fall in love with}} Sameera. He saves her from a group of people trying to murder her; on an isolated island together Gautham learns the truth behind the fourth imaginary person and writes Sameera off as a disturbed journalist. By the time he learns about Sameera's intentions, she has left for Hyderabad; Gautham pursues her.|$|E

500|$|Jack, {{believing that}} Don Geiss {{will give him}} the CEO job, and after {{learning}} about Liz's high school reunion, says [...] "I wish I had a Princeton reunion right now. I'd wipe the smug smile off Michelle Obama's face", a reference to Michelle Obama who graduated from Princeton, and to her husband, Barack Obama, who won the 2008 U.S. Presidential Election. At the reunion, Rob Sussman, a past classmate of Liz's, complains that Liz said he was gayer than the volleyball scene in the 1986 action film Top Gun. During the reunion, Liz's former classmates play Seven minutes in heaven, {{a game in which}} <b>two</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> selected to go into a closet or other dark enclosed space and do whatever they like for seven minutes, often kissing. Later, Liz's classmates plan to [...] "Carrie" [...] her on stage as revenge for her being mean to them, but is stopped by Jack saying [...] "we cannot Carrie Liz Lemon". This is a reference to the 1976 horror film Carrie in which the title character is drenched with pig's blood.|$|E
500|$|Forces {{act in a}} {{particular}} direction and have sizes dependent upon how strong the push or pull is. Because of these characteristics, forces are classified as [...] "vector quantities". This means that forces follow {{a different set of}} mathematical rules than physical quantities that do not have direction (denoted scalar quantities). For example, when determining what happens when two forces act on the same object, it is necessary to know both the magnitude and the direction of both forces to calculate the result. If both of these pieces of information are not known for each force, the situation is ambiguous. For example, if you know that <b>two</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> pulling on the same rope with known magnitudes of force but you do not know which direction either person is pulling, it is impossible to determine what the acceleration of the rope will be. The two people could be pulling against each other as in tug of war or the two people could be pulling in the same direction. In this simple one-dimensional example, without knowing the direction of the forces it is impossible to decide whether the net force is the result of adding the two force magnitudes or subtracting one from the other. Associating forces with vectors avoids such problems.|$|E
500|$|The storm wrought {{destruction}} {{along the}} entire Texas shoreline, with substantial shipping losses. All ships in the harbors at Brazos Santiago and Velasco were sunk or driven aground. Communities along the shores of Matagorda Bay were heavily damaged, as buildings and wharves were swept away. Farther north, a [...] storm surge flooded Galveston Island, where nearly every building was destroyed, along with all supplies and provisions. Of the 30 vessels present in the harbor at Galveston when the storm began, only one remained moored following its passage. Some ships were pushed several miles inland; in one case, a brig was driven against a three-story warehouse, causing it to collapse. Among the ships destroyed at Galveston were two Texas Navy schooners. In a scene of [...] "utter desolation", individuals in Galveston survived the flooding by grasping to floating debris for days. Floodwaters surged inland for many miles over the coastal prairies, drowning livestock. At Houston, the surf action, accompanied by a [...] surge, altered the coastline. Near Sabine Pass, the storm washed a three-masted barque [...] inland, where residents would salvage its timbers for firewood and home building materials for decades to come. Despite the damage throughout coastal Texas, only <b>two</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> known to have died, including one in Galveston.|$|E
