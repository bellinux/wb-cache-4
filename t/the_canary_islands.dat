5|$|Delta drifted {{slowly and}} erratically southwards {{for several days}} before {{accelerating}} north-eastwards then eastwards towards <b>the</b> <b>Canary</b> <b>Islands</b> and north Africa. During this period, it twice approached hurricane strength, although it never achieved hurricane intensity. On November 28 it merged with a frontal system northwest of the Canaries and became a vigorous extratropical storm. It caused severe damage in <b>the</b> <b>Canary</b> <b>Islands</b> and claimed at least seven lives, including six who drowned while attempting to reach <b>the</b> <b>Canary</b> <b>Islands</b> by boat from Africa. El Dedo de Dios, or God's Finger, a geological feature which had been pointing towards the sky for over a millennium and an important landmark for <b>the</b> <b>Canary</b> <b>Islands,</b> was toppled during the storm. Delta also caused power outages, leaving some 200,000people without power and forcing airports to close down.|$|E

5|$|As Delta {{accelerated}} to {{the northeast}} towards <b>the</b> <b>Canary</b> <b>Islands,</b> it intensified again, reaching a second peak of just under hurricane strength on November27. In post-storm analysis, the NHC noted {{that there was a}} possibility that Delta had briefly reached hurricane strength that day; however, the data was not conclusive enough to justify an upgrade to hurricane status. On November28, as it neared <b>the</b> <b>Canary</b> <b>Islands</b> Tropical Storm Delta lost its tropical characteristics. The extratropical storm, which maintained winds of near-hurricane strength, passed about 105mi (165km) north of the islands that night. The storm moved over Morocco early on November29 and rapidly weakened overland, dissipating late that day over northwestern Algeria.|$|E
