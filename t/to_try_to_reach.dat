5|$|Gibraltar's {{relationship}} with Spain {{continued to be}} a sensitive subject. By 2002, Britain and Spain had proposed an agreement to share sovereignty over Gibraltar. However, it was opposed by the government of Gibraltar, which put it to a referendum in November 2002. The agreement was rejected by 17,000 votes to 187– a majority of 98.97%. Although both governments dismissed the outcome as having no legal weight, the outcome of the referendum caused the talks to stall and the British government accepted that it would be unrealistic <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> an agreement without the support of the people of Gibraltar.|$|E
5|$|Resistance {{against the}} Spanish continued, and hostile Ch'ol killed several newly baptised Christian Indians. In early March 1696 {{such was the}} success of the friars that captain Jacobo de Alzayaga and the Mercederians decided <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> Lake Petén Itzá. They headed eastwards towards the Pasión River with 150 heavily armed {{soldiers}} plus native guides, travelling in five large canoes. They got as far as the savannah to the southeast of the lake before turning back for unknown reasons. Antonio Margil remained in Dolores del Lakandon until 1697. The Ch'ol of the Lacandon Jungle were resettled in Huehuetenango in the early 18th century.|$|E

5|$|In 1946, the Labour {{government}} in Britain, exhausted by recent {{events such as}} World War II and numerous riots, realized that it had neither the mandate at home, the support internationally, nor {{the reliability of the}} British Indian Army for continuing to control an increasingly restless British India. The reliability of the native forces for continuing their control over an increasingly rebellious India diminished, and so the government decided to end the British rule of the Indian Subcontinent. In 1946, the Indian National Congress, being a secular party, demanded a single state. The Muslim majorities, who disagreed with the idea of single state, stressed the idea of a separate Pakistan as an alternative. The 1946 Cabinet Mission to India was sent <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> a compromise between Congress and the Muslim League, proposing a decentralized state with much power given to local governments, but it was rejected by both of the parties and resulted in a number of riots in South Asia.|$|E
5|$|Near {{the mouth}} of the Argolic Gulf a Staffel of nine Luftwaffe Junkers Ju 87 Stuka dive-bombers from Jagdgeschwader 77 {{attacked}} the convoy at either 06:45 or 07:15. Slamat was hit, set afire and began to abandon ship. Calcutta ordered Diamond to go alongside Slamat to rescue survivors {{while the rest of the}} convoy continued <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> Souda Bay in Crete. At 08:15 Diamond reported that she was still rescuing survivors and still under air attack. By then three destroyers had reinforced the convoy so Calcutta sent one of them, , to assist Diamond. Slamat was afire from stem to stern when Diamond fired a torpedo that sank her in a coup de grâce. Diamond reported at 09:25 that she had rescued most of the survivors and was proceeding to Souda Bay. An hour later Wryneck signalled a request for aircraft cover.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the operation, {{a raid on}} the French {{coastal town}} of Dieppe had placed the German occupying forces on a high state of alert, and this {{ultimately}} contributed to Aquatint's failure. The commandos were also unable to identify their correct landing place due to the darkness. Within minutes of landing, the raiding party was ambushed by a German patrol and forced <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> their Motor Torpedo Boat (MTB) transport. The MTB was located and engaged by the German shore batteries, which damaged one of its engines. It was forced to withdraw, leaving the commandos behind. At {{the end of the}} raid those commandos who had not been killed all became prisoners of war. Only five of the raiding force would survive the war; one was killed in captivity and the fate of the other two is uncertain.|$|E

5|$|The Bureau of Meteorology {{predicted}} Rosita to hit near Broome {{at around}} midnight WST on 20 April (1600 UTC 19 April). Towns {{around the area}} were warned to prepare {{for one of the}} most powerful cyclones ever to threaten Australia. Very destructive winds with gusts to 260km/h near the cyclone's centre were expected. Residents of coastal towns were warned to expect dangerous storm tides– local emergency officials said an 8metre (26ft) high tide was expected at that night. Tourists in the area were warned not <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> Broome. Chevron Australia said a tanker due to arrive on 18 April was asked to delay its arrival till 22 April because of the cyclone. Iron ore miners in Port Hedland and Dampier monitored Rosita's approach.|$|E
5|$|The beach of Weston Bay lies on {{the western}} edge of the town. The upper part is sandy, but the sea retreats a long way at low tide, exposing large areas of mud flats (hence the colloquial name of Weston-super-Mud). The tidal range in this part of the Bristol Channel is great, and since beach and mud flats are on a gentle slope, it is inadvisable <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> the sea at low tide, as the sand gives way to deep mud which has often {{resulted}} in loss of life over the years. Driving on the beach is permitted in certain areas, but occasionally the drivers are caught unawares as they drive too close to the sea and break through the sand into the underlying mud, and are then stuck.|$|E
5|$|While {{preparing}} for his southern journey, Shackleton gave instructions to Edgeworth David {{to lead a}} Northern party to Victoria Land to carry out magnetic and geological work. The party was <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> the Magnetic Pole, and was {{to carry out a}} full geological survey in the Dry Valley area. David's party consisted of himself, Douglas Mawson and Alistair Mackay. It would be a man-hauling party; the dogs remained at base to be used for depot-laying and other routine work. The party had orders to plant the Union Jack at the Magnetic Pole and to take possession of Victoria Land for the British Empire. After several days' preparatory work, they started out on 5 October 1908, drawn for the first few miles by the motor car.|$|E

5|$|Charles and the Duke of Buckingham, James's {{favourite}} {{and a man}} who {{had great}} influence over the prince, travelled incognito to Spain in February 1623 <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> agreement on the long-pending Spanish match. In the end, however, the trip was an embarrassing failure. The Infanta thought Charles was little more than an infidel, and the Spanish at first demanded that he convert to Roman Catholicism as a condition of the match. The Spanish insisted on toleration of Catholics in England and the repeal of the penal laws, which Charles knew would never be agreed by Parliament, and that the Infanta remain in Spain for a year after any wedding to ensure that England complied with all the terms of the treaty. A personal quarrel erupted between Buckingham and the Count of Olivares, the Spanish chief minister, and so Charles conducted the ultimately futile negotiations personally. When Charles returned to London in October, without a bride and to a rapturous and relieved public welcome, he and Buckingham pushed a reluctant King James to declare war on Spain.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} morning of 13 May General Winkelman advised the Dutch {{government}} that he considered the general situation to be critical. On land the Dutch had been {{cut off from the}} Allied front and it had become clear no major Allied landings were to be expected to reinforce the Fortress Holland by sea; without such support there was no prospect of a prolonged successful resistance. German tanks might quickly pass through Rotterdam; Winkelman had already ordered all available antitank-guns to be placed in a perimeter around The Hague, to protect the seat of government. However, an immediate collapse of the Dutch defences might still be prevented if the planned counterattacks could seal off the southern front near Dordrecht and restore the eastern line at the Grebbeberg. Therefore, the cabinet decided to continue the fight for the time being, giving the general the mandate to surrender the Army when he saw fit and the instruction to avoid unnecessary sacrifices. Nevertheless, it was also deemed essential that Queen Wilhelmina was to be brought to safety; she departed around noon from Hoek van Holland, where a British Irish Guards battalion was present, on HMS Hereward, a British destroyer, and when sea mines made it too dangerous <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> Zealand, she went to England. The previous evening, the Queen's only child and heir presumptive Princess Juliana, together with her husband Prince Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld and their children, had departed from IJmuiden on HMS Codrington for Harwich. Arrangements for the departure had already been made before the invasion. As the Queen constitutionally was part of the government, her departure confronted the cabinet with the choice whether to follow her or remain. After heated discussions it was decided to leave also: the ministers sailed at 19:20 from Hoek van Holland on HMS Windsor to form a government in exile in London, having conferred all governmental authority over the homeland to Winkelman. Three Dutch merchant ships, escorted by British warships, transferred government bullion and diamond stocks to the United Kingdom.|$|E

Other safe houses dotted Indiana, including one in Town Clock Church (pictured).

50|$|The Truce of Nice, {{signed on}} June 18, 1538, ended the war, leaving Turin in French hands but {{affecting}} {{no significant change}} in the map of Italy.

Pope Paul III was forced to carry out negotiations by going from room <b>to</b> room, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> an agreement between the two leaders.

25|$|Hohns and Waugh {{took the}} Australian total past 400 {{for the fourth}} time in the series, with Waugh {{seemingly}} moving confidently towards another century.

25|$|With David II in his custody, Edward III {{had a good}} {{opportunity}} <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> terms, though Edward Balliol's interests were a sticking point. He had evidently prepared to overlook them {{by the time he}} made his first offer, in 1348, which seems to have been that David II would hold Scotland as a fief for England, naming Edward III or one of his sons as his successor, should he die without children. This had altered somewhat by 1350 when Edward III sent Douglas of Liddelsdale, also in custody in the Tower of London, to see if the Scots would be willing to take different terms: to ransom David II for a fee of £40,000, the restoration of the disinherited lords, and the naming of Edward III's young son John of Gaunt as David's successor, should he die without children. David himself is credited with removing Edward III's name from the line of succession in Scotland, and the Scots seem to have been willing to entertain the idea as they sent Douglas of Liddesdale back for further negotiation and David II was himself permitted to briefly return to Scotland in early 1352 to try to seal the deal. Stewart would obviously be disinclined to support terms that removed him from succession, but he seems ultimately not to have been alone. The Parliament convened in March 1352 did not find the prospect of submitting to the English a fair trade for the freedom of their king. David II was sent back.|$|E
