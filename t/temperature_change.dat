While local action such as habitat restoration and herbivore protection can reduce local damage, the longer-term threats of acidification, <b>temperature</b> <b>change</b> and sea-level rise remain a challenge.|$|E
5|$|The main {{failure mode}} for die casting dies is wear or erosion. Other failure modes are heat {{checking}} and thermal fatigue. Heat checking is when surface cracks {{occur on the}} die due to a large <b>temperature</b> <b>change</b> on every cycle. Thermal fatigue is when surface cracks occur on the die due to {{a large number of}} cycles.|$|E
5|$|At night, {{the land}} cools off {{more quickly than}} the ocean because of {{differences}} in their specific heat values. This <b>temperature</b> <b>change</b> causes the daytime sea breeze to dissipate. When the temperature onshore cools below the temperature offshore, the pressure over the water will be {{lower than that of}} the land, establishing a land breeze, as long as an onshore wind is not strong enough to oppose it.|$|E

40|$|A {{technique}} for measuring local stresses in metallic specimens is proposed and tested.

At a free boundary in a body under plane stress, these <b>temperature</b> <b>changes</b> {{are directly related to}} the value of the tangential principal stress. The technique is suited for measurement of stress-concentration effects, since the <b>temperature</b> <b>changes</b> can be measured with thermocouples featuring extremely small junctions...|$|R

5|$|Selenium forms several allotropes that interconvert with {{temperature}} changes, depending somewhat on {{the rate}} of <b>temperature</b> <b>change.</b> When prepared in chemical reactions, selenium is usually an amorphous, brick-red powder. When rapidly melted, it forms the black, vitreous form, usually sold commercially as beads. The structure of black selenium is irregular and complex and consists of polymeric rings with up to 1000 atoms per ring. Black Se is a brittle, lustrous solid that is slightly soluble in CS2. Upon heating, it softens at 50°C and converts to gray selenium at 180°C; the transformation temperature is reduced by presence of halogens and amines.|$|E
5|$|Anisotropy {{of liquid}} {{crystals}} is a property not observed in other fluids. This anisotropy makes flows of liquid crystals behave more differentially {{than those of}} ordinary fluids. For example, injection of a flux of a liquid crystal between two close parallel plates (viscous fingering) causes orientation of the molecules to couple with the flow, with the resulting emergence of dendritic patterns. This anisotropy is also manifested in the interfacial energy (surface tension) between different liquid crystal phases. This anisotropy determines the equilibrium shape at the coexistence temperature, and {{is so strong that}} usually facets appear. When temperature is changed one of the phases grows, forming different morphologies depending on the <b>temperature</b> <b>change.</b> Since growth is controlled by heat diffusion, anisotropy in thermal conductivity favors growth in specific directions, which has also an effect on the final shape.|$|E
5|$|Synchronous {{spawning}} is very typical on {{the coral}} reef, and often, even when multiple species are present, all corals spawn {{on the same}} night. This synchrony is essential so male and female gametes can meet. Corals rely on environmental cues, varying from species to species, to determine the proper time to release gametes into the water. The cues involve <b>temperature</b> <b>change,</b> lunar cycle, day length, and possibly chemical signalling. Synchronous spawning may form hybrids and is perhaps involved in coral speciation. The immediate cue is most often sunset, which cues the release. The spawning event can be visually dramatic, clouding the usually clear water with gametes.|$|E

Seen from Fig.  5 b, the temperature of tubing is increasing {{with the increase of}} fluid producing intensity, and the <b>temperature</b> <b>changes</b> obviously when the fluid producing intensity is 0 – 100  t/d, while the <b>temperature</b> <b>changes</b> slowly and tends to be stable when the liquid production rate is more than 100  t/d.

30|$|Thermal {{gradient}} describes that {{in which}} direction {{and at what}} rate the <b>temperature</b> <b>changes</b> the most rapidly around a particular location.

5|$|For {{at least}} a portion of its life, a star shines due to {{thermonuclear}} fusion of hydrogen into helium in its core, releasing energy that traverses the star's interior and then radiates into outer space. Almost all naturally occurring elements heavier than helium are created by stellar nucleosynthesis during the star's lifetime, and for some stars by supernova nucleosynthesis when it explodes. Near {{the end of its}} life, a star can also contain degenerate matter. Astronomers can determine the mass, age, metallicity (chemical composition), and many other properties of a star by observing its motion through space, its luminosity, and spectrum respectively. The total mass of a star is the main factor that determines its evolution and eventual fate. Other characteristics of a star, including diameter and <b>temperature,</b> <b>change</b> over its life, while the star's environment affects its rotation and movement. A plot of the temperature of many stars against their luminosities produces a plot known as a Hertzsprung–Russell diagram (H–R diagram). Plotting a particular star on that diagram allows the age and evolutionary state of that star to be determined.|$|E
5|$|Samarium is a {{rare earth}} metal having a {{hardness}} and density {{similar to those of}} zinc. With the boiling point of 1794°C, samarium is the third most volatile lanthanide after ytterbium and europium; this property facilitates separation of samarium from the mineral ore. At ambient conditions, samarium normally assumes a rhombohedral structure (α form). Upon heating to 731°C, its crystal symmetry changes into hexagonally close-packed (hcp), however the transition temperature depends on the metal purity. Further heating to 922°C transforms the metal into a body-centered cubic (bcc) phase. Heating to 300°C combined with compression to 40kbar results in a double-hexagonally close-packed structure (dhcp). Applying higher pressure of the order of hundreds or thousands of kilobars induces a series of phase transformations, in particular with a tetragonal phase appearing at about 900kbar. In one study, the dhcp phase could be produced without compression, using a nonequilibrium annealing regime with a rapid <b>temperature</b> <b>change</b> between about 400 and 700°C, confirming the transient character of this samarium phase. Also, thin films of samarium obtained by vapor deposition may contain the hcp or dhcp phases at ambient conditions.|$|E
25|$|The {{historically}} significant Swan-Ganz multi-lumen catheter allows reproducible {{calculation of}} cardiac output from a measured time-temperature curve, {{also known as}} the thermodilution curve. Thermistor technology enabled the observations that low CO registers <b>temperature</b> <b>change</b> slowly and high CO registers <b>temperature</b> <b>change</b> rapidly. The degree of <b>temperature</b> <b>change</b> is directly proportional to the cardiac output. In this unique method, three or four repeated measurements or passes are usually averaged to improve accuracy. Modern catheters are fitted with heating filaments that intermittently heat up and measure the thermodilution curve, providing serial Q measurements. These instruments average measurements over 2–9 minutes depending on the stability of the circulation, and thus do not provide continuous monitoring.|$|E

40|$|The typical {{features}} of eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage is prolonged loss of muscle {{strength and the}} most rapid structural change in the fibers is loss of immunostaining for the intermediate filament protein, desmin. In this study isolated perfused rat muscle {{was used to examine}} the direct effect of <b>temperature</b> <b>changes</b> on the eccentric contraction-induced force and desmin loss. The left medial gastrocnemius muscle was separated and the entire lower limb was transferred into a prewarmed (35 oC) organ bath. Temperature was adjusted to 31 or 39 oC during and after eccentric contractions. Maximal isometric force and desmin loss were measured after 15 isometric or eccentric contractions. According to our data, organ bath <b>temperature</b> <b>changes</b> during or after eccentric contractions had no significant effect on force loss. However, a strong correlation between desmin loss and <b>temperature</b> <b>changes</b> during (r = 0. 886, P< 0. 05) and a weak correlation between desmin loss and <b>temperature</b> <b>changes</b> after (r= 0. 699, P< 0. 05) eccentric contractions was observed.
