Sometimes the rustication would be used for pillars rather than walls, a reversal of expectations and almost an architectural joke (illustration 2).|$|E
5|$|Meat {{was more}} {{expensive}} and therefore more prestigious. Game, a form of meat acquired from hunting, was common only on the nobility's tables. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>prevalent</b> butcher's meats were pork, chicken and other domestic fowl; beef, which required greater investment in land, was less common. Cod and herring were mainstays among the northern populations; dried, smoked or salted {{they made their way}} far inland, but a wide variety of other saltwater and freshwater fish was also eaten.|$|E
5|$|Amatoxins {{consist of}} at least eight {{compounds}} with a similar structure, that of eight amino-acid rings; of those found in A. ocreata, α-amanitin is <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>prevalent</b> and along with β-amanitin {{is likely to be}} responsible for the toxic effects. The major toxic mechanism is the inhibition of RNA polymerase II, a vital enzyme in the synthesis of messenger RNA (mRNA), microRNA, and small nuclear RNA (snRNA). Without mRNA, essential protein synthesis and hence cell metabolism stop and the cell dies. The liver is the principal organ affected, as it is the first organ encountered after absorption by the gastrointestinal tract, though other organs, especially the kidneys, are susceptible to the toxins.|$|E

She also examined factors that contributed to Plasmodium reproduction. This work {{became the basis for}} subsequent ongoing research into a malaria vaccine. Her subsequent work was spurred by the outbreak of the Second World War. During the war, she investigated alternative chemotherapies for malaria. Her research aided the British war effort because <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>prevalent</b> antimalarial, quinine, was difficult to obtain due to the Japanese occupation of the Dutch West Indies.

Although the use of leaded gasoline was largely phased out in North America by 1996, soils next to roads built before this time retain high lead concentrations. Later research demonstrated a statistically significant correlation between the usage rate of leaded gasoline and violent crime in the United States; taking into account a 22-year time lag (for the average age of violent criminals), the violent crime curve virtually tracked the lead exposure curve.|$|E

40|$|Dairy cow {{mastitis}} is {{an important}} disease in the dairy industry. Different microbial species {{have been identified as}} causative agents in mastitis, and are traditionally diagnosed by bacterial culture. The objective {{of this study was to}} use metagenomic pyrosequencing of bacterial 16 S rRNA genes to investigate bacterial DNA diversity in milk samples of mastitic and healthy dairy cows and compare the results with those obtained by classical bacterial culture. One hundred and thirty-six milk samples were collected from cows showing signs of mastitis and used for microbiological culture. Additionally, 20 milk samples were collected from healthy quarters. Bacterial DNA was isolated from the same milk samples and the 16 S rRNA genes were individually amplified and pyrosequenced. Discriminant analysis showed that the groups of samples that were most clearly different from the rest and thus easily discriminated were the normal milk samples from healthy cows and those characterised by culture as Trueperella pyogenes and Streptococcus spp. The mastitis pathogens identified by culture were generally among <b>the</b> <b>most</b> frequent organisms detected by pyrosequencing, and in some cases (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp. and Streptococcus uberis mastitis) <b>the</b> single <b>most</b> <b>prevalent</b> microorganism.

5|$|Partly from Cowper's {{literary}} influence, {{and partly}} because learned vicars were expected to write verses, Newton began to try his hand at hymns, which had become popular through the language, made plain for common people to understand. Several prolific hymn writers were at their most productive in the 18th century, including Isaac Watts whose hymns Newton had grown up hearing and Charles Wesley, with whom Newton was familiar. Wesley's brother John, the eventual founder of the Methodist Church, had encouraged Newton {{to go into the}} clergy. Watts was a pioneer in English hymn writing, basing his work after the Psalms. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>prevalent</b> hymns by Watts and others were written in the common meter in 8.6.8.6: the first line is eight syllables and the second is six.|$|E
5|$|Two of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>prevalent</b> quality {{problems}} in GMAW are dross and porosity. If not controlled, they {{can lead to}} weaker, less ductile welds. Dross is an especially common problem in aluminium GMAW welds, normally coming from particles of aluminium oxide or aluminum nitride present in the electrode or base materials. Electrodes and workpieces must be brushed with a wire brush or chemically treated to remove oxides on the surface. Any oxygen {{in contact with the}} weld pool, whether from the atmosphere or the shielding gas, causes dross as well. As a result, sufficient flow of inert shielding gases is necessary, and welding in volatile air should be avoided.|$|E

40|$|Background In the Netherlands, a {{screening}} programme {{was set up}} in 1994 in order to identify all patients with familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH). After 15 years of screening, we evaluated the geographical distribution, possible founder effects and clinical phenotype of <b>the</b> 12 <b>most</b> <b>prevalent</b> FH gene mutations. Methods Patients who carried one of <b>the</b> 12 <b>most</b> <b>prevalent</b> mutations, index cases and those identified between 1994 and 2009 through the screening programme and whose postal code was known were included in the study. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels at the time of screening were retrieved. The prevalence of identified patients in each postal code area was calculated and visualised in different maps. Results A total of 10, 889 patients were included in the study. Mean untreated LDL-C levels ranged from 4. 4 to 6. 4 mmol/l. For almost all mutations, a region of high prevalence could be observed. In total, 51 homozygous patients were identified in the Netherlands, of which 13 true homozygous for one of <b>the</b> 12 <b>most</b> <b>prevalent</b> mutations. <b>The</b> majority of them were living in high-prevalence areas for that specific mutation. Conclusions Phenotypes with regard to LDL-C levels varied between <b>the</b> 12 <b>most</b> <b>prevalent</b> FH mutations. For most of these mutations, a founder effect was observed. Our observations can have implications with regard to the efficiency of molecular screening and physician's perception of FH and {{to the understanding of the}} prevalence and distribution of homozygous patients in the Netherland...|$|R

5|$|As {{ubiquitous}} insects, dipterans play {{an important}} role at various trophic levels both as consumers and as prey. In some groups the larvae complete their development without feeding, and in others the adults do not feed. The larvae can be herbivores, scavengers, decomposers, predators or parasites, with the consumption of decaying organic matter being one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>prevalent</b> feeding behaviours. The fruit or detritus is consumed along with the associated micro-organisms, a sieve-like filter in the pharynx being used to concentrate the particles, while flesh-eating larvae have mouth-hooks to help shred their food. The larvae of some groups feed on or in the living tissues of plants and fungi, and some of these are serious pests of agricultural crops. Some aquatic larvae consume the films of algae that form underwater on rocks and plants. Many of the parasitoid larvae grow inside and eventually kill other arthropods, while parasitic larvae may attack vertebrate hosts.|$|E
5|$|Conventional fission {{power plants}} {{rely on the}} chain {{reaction}} caused when fission events release thermal neutrons that cause further fission events. Each fission event in U-235 releases two or three neutrons with about 2MeV of kinetic energy. By careful arrangement {{and the use of}} various absorber materials, designers can balance the system so one of those neutrons causes another fission event while the other one or two are lost. This balance is known as criticality. Natural uranium is a mix of three isotopes; mainly U-238, with some U-235, and trace amounts of U-234. The neutrons released in the fission of either of the main isotopes will cause fission in U-235, but not in U-238, which requires higher energies around 5MeV. There is not enough U-235 in natural uranium to reach criticality. Commercial light water nuclear reactors, <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>prevalent</b> power reactors in the world, use nuclear fuel containing uranium enriched to 3 to 5% U-235 while the leftover is U-238.|$|E
5|$|Golondrina points (formerly Plainview Golondrina) are {{lanceolate}} spear or dart projectile points, {{of medium}} size, dated to the transitional Paleo-Indian Period, between 9000–7000 BP. Golondrina points were attached on split-stem hafts {{and may have}} served to bring down medium-sized animals such as deer, as well as functioning as butchering knives. Distribution is widespread throughout most of Texas, and points have also been discovered in Arkansas and Mexico. The concentration of Golondrina specimens is highest across the South Texas Plains, where the point is <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>prevalent</b> of Paleo-Indian types and defines a distinctive cultural pattern for the region. The Golondrina point is so named for its flared basal corners ("ears"), which resemble a swallow's (golondrina in Spanish) split tail. Classification of Golondrina can be difficult because of its similarity to other types, particularly the Plainview point, to which it was originally thought to be related.|$|E

The Universal Wrestling Association created the UWA World Trios Championship in 1984 and the Boxing and Wrestling Commission created the Mexican National Trios Championship in 1985, making it only the second Trios {{championship}} in Mexico. Control of the championship was given to EMLL, the UWA's main rival at the time, with the commission retaining oversight and approval of the championship matches. In 1993 then champions Los Infernales ("The Infernal Ones"; MS-1, Pirata Morgan, and El Satánico) left EMLL to join AAA, taking the trios championship with them after approval by the commission. In the late 1990s the championship was not promoted on a regular basis by AAA and appeared inactive until the champions, Blue Panther, Fuerza Guerrera, and El Signo, joined CMLL in 2001 and lost the championship to a CMLL team. From that point forward the championship has been controlled by CMLL once more.|$|E
5|$|Long-term {{misuse of}} alcohol {{can cause a}} wide range of mental health problems. Severe {{cognitive}} problems are common; approximately 10 percent of all dementia cases are related to alcohol consumption, making it the second leading cause of dementia. Excessive alcohol use causes damage to brain function, and psychological health can be increasingly affected over time. Social skills are significantly impaired in people suffering from alcoholism due to the neurotoxic effects of alcohol on the brain, especially the prefrontal cortex area of the brain. The social skills that are impaired by alcohol abuse include impairments in perceiving facial emotions, prosody perception problems and theory of mind deficits; the ability to understand humour is also impaired in alcohol abusers. Psychiatric disorders are common in alcoholics, with as many as 25 percent suffering severe psychiatric disturbances. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>prevalent</b> psychiatric symptoms are anxiety and depression disorders. Psychiatric symptoms usually initially worsen during alcohol withdrawal, but typically improve or disappear with continued abstinence. Psychosis, confusion, and organic brain syndrome may be caused by alcohol misuse, which can lead to a misdiagnosis such as schizophrenia. Panic disorder can develop or worsen {{as a direct result of}} long-term alcohol misuse.|$|E
5|$|The Knapps {{study in}} Monroe County, Indiana, found {{time-out}} and {{times to be}} by far <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>prevalent</b> terms in the 1970s. Variations included I've got times and time. Very few children reported the more traditional kings, queens or I've got kings X. The authors also reported that these terms were popular over {{many areas of the}} US and in American schools abroad. To be functional a truce term must be understood and honoured by most of the children playing together. Time-out clearly derives from the use of intermissions in timed sports and apparently came into the language with the popularization of organized or timed sports and with the advent of such sports in elementary schools and on television. Historically the earliest reports for the use of time-out or time as a truce term were 1935 and 1936. However, {{only a small number of}} respondents reported anything other than time-out and its derivatives in use during the 1960s.
