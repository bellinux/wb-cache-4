5|$|Two endings {{were created}} for the special. <b>The</b> <b>alternative</b> ending is {{included}} on the DVD release of Green Wing, along with deleted scenes from the episode. <b>The</b> <b>alternative</b> ending was planned to be used if a third series {{was going to be}} commissioned, as this ending was much more ambiguous. It is known that the actors wanted <b>the</b> <b>alternative</b> ending, but after some debate, it was not shown.|$|E

50|$|Because <b>the</b> <b>alternatives</b> {{may differ}} in costs, timeline, etc., a {{selection}} {{must be made}} of <b>the</b> <b>alternatives.</b> These are <b>the</b> <b>alternatives</b> to pursue in figure 3. In this step a lot of trade-offs must be made between different alternatives for different targets: for example, performance over costs and even target over target.|$|R
40|$|Chapter 3 {{describes}} <b>the</b> <b>alternatives</b> {{evaluated in}} this Complex Transformation Supplemental Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (SPEIS). Chapter 3 {{begins with an}} overview of <b>the</b> <b>alternatives</b> and {{a description of the}} process the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) used to develop <b>the</b> reasonable <b>alternatives</b> for this SPEIS. The majority of Chapter 3 describes the programmatic and project-specific alternatives. Chapter 3 also discusses alternatives that were considered and subsequently eliminated from detailed evaluation. The chapter concludes with a summary comparison of the environmental impacts associated with <b>the</b> <b>alternatives</b> and identifies NNSA’s preferred alternative. A more detailed description of <b>the</b> <b>alternatives</b> is contained in Appendix A...|$|R

30|$|Step 4 : Finally, <b>the</b> <b>alternatives</b> {{are ranked}} in {{descending}} order of y_i^* values. For an <b>alternative,</b> <b>the</b> more y_i^* gives the higher rank.

5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>alternative</b> version, {{plot points}} are changed or {{expanded}} upon {{to allow the}} game {{to serve as a}} sequel. It also features an extended ending in which Twinrova kidnaps Zelda, and lights the third Flame of Despair to revive Ganon. The player can then enter Twinrova's lair and battle Twinrova and Ganon. Upon completing <b>the</b> <b>alternative</b> game, another password is shown that gives the player the Victory Ring, which commemorates the defeat of Ganon.|$|E

30|$|A set of fuzzy {{rates is}} {{required}} in order to compare all <b>the</b> <b>alternatives</b> for each criterion. These fuzzy terms are assigned by the decision makers and responsible for intra criterion comparisons of <b>the</b> <b>alternatives.</b>|$|R
5|$|This ending was the {{favourite}} {{amongst the}} actors. Mangan said that <b>the</b> <b>alternative</b> ending {{was the best}} moment {{in the whole of}} Green Wing. However, <b>the</b> <b>alternative</b> ending was rejected and the writers favoured the ending that was eventually broadcast. It is believed that <b>the</b> <b>alternative</b> ending would have been broadcast if a third series was being made, as that ending was much more ambiguous, since Alan and Joanna are still seen alive and Mac tells Caroline that he still has something to say.|$|E
5|$|Wotton {{station on}} <b>the</b> <b>Alternative</b> Route, which had {{passed from the}} {{ownership}} of the Great Central Railway to the London and North Eastern Railway, remained open (albeit little used and served by only two trains per day in each direction) until 7 December 1953, when the line was abandoned. All buildings of the Brill Tramway station at Wotton were subsequently demolished, other than a small building which had once housed the Tramway's forge, which was left derelict. The bridge that had formerly carried <b>the</b> <b>Alternative</b> Route was demolished in 1970, and the former Great Central Railway station on <b>the</b> <b>Alternative</b> Route was converted to a private house.|$|E
5|$|According to a Saint Consulting {{survey in}} April 2007, wind power was <b>the</b> <b>alternative</b> energy source {{most likely to}} gain public support for future {{development}} in Canada, with only 16% opposed {{to this type of}} energy.

40|$|In {{organic farming}} {{there is an}} ongoing {{discussion}} on piglet castration without anaesthesia and possible alternatives to this practice due to animal welfare concerns. Consumer acceptance of alternatives to piglet castration without anaesthesia {{plays an important role}} in this discussion. This contribution examines organic consumers’ attitudes towards piglet castration without anaesthesia and <b>the</b> <b>alternatives</b> castration with anaesthesia and analgesia, immunocastration and fattening of entire males. Additionally, consumers’ willingness-to-pay for <b>the</b> <b>alternatives</b> is determined. <b>The</b> results show that animal welfare, food safety and health concerns influence consumers’ attitudes towards <b>the</b> <b>alternatives.</b> However, <b>the</b> individual perception of those aspects is quite varying. Thus, consumers’ opinions towards <b>the</b> <b>alternatives</b> are also different. Consumers’ perception of <b>the</b> <b>alternatives</b> is reflected in their willingness-to-pay. When implementing alternatives to piglet castration without anaesthesia the organic farming sector should address consumers’ concerns in an appropriate way in order to avoid misinformation and insecurity among consumers...|$|R

5|$|All of the high-penetrating (armor-piercing) and hollow-point {{ammunition}} {{is classified}} as category A (see above). <b>The</b> <b>alternative</b> to a hollow point ammunition was Federal EFMJ, which has been classified into the arms group A in mid 2009, effectively outlawing it. Therefore, only full metal jacket or soft-nosed semi-jacketed rounds and or just unjacketed bullets (lead only) are allowed. Generally, no ammunition with higher wounding potential is allowed.|$|E

5|$|David Lovering (born December 6, 1961) is an American {{musician}} and magician. He {{is best known}} as the drummer for <b>the</b> <b>alternative</b> rock band Pixies, which he joined in 1986. After the band's breakup in 1993, Lovering drummed with several other acts, including The Martinis, Cracker, Nitzer Ebb and Tanya Donelly. He also pursued a magic career as The Scientific Phenomenalist; performing scientific and physics-based experiments on stage. When the Pixies reunited in 2004, Lovering returned as the band's drummer.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the song}} being {{influenced}} from funk and rock, the indie rock music origins allowed it to hit <b>the</b> <b>alternative</b> charts peaking at a moderately successful number 16 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart and due {{to the song}}'s number 1 success on the pop charts, it led to be played often on modern rock radio stations despite only hitting number 16.|$|E

30|$|What hai {{contributes}} here is {{a simple}} inclusion additive sense.

Take 33 a as an example, hai asserts that it is possible that she ate chocolate (i.e., the focused denotation) and it is possible that she ate cookies (i.e., <b>the</b> <b>alternatives).</b> Hai does not indicate that the focused denotation is less likely than <b>the</b> <b>alternatives,</b> or vice versa.|$|R
30|$|The above example {{means that}} Xiaomei {{is less likely}} to eat {{chocolate}} (i.e., the focused denotation) than to eat cookies and drink tea (i.e., <b>the</b> <b>alternatives).</b> That is, there is a scale of likelihood and the focused denotation is located in {{the lower part of the}} scale than <b>the</b> <b>alternatives.</b> I proposed that hai only contributes the additive sense to the sentence.
