The only other pitcher in major league baseball history had gone as many as 25 straight road starts without losing — Allie Reynolds had a 25-game streak in –. [...] "I was terrible," [...] Young said. [...] "I just never found my rhythm and never found my groove. I put the guys in a hole {{early in the game}} and it was just too much to overcome. I can’t imagine, having <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>that,</b> the courage it took, the discipline, and just how successful he was. I mean, he wasn’t just successful integrating the game. He was a great baseball player. He's a Hall of Fame baseball player. He wouldn’t allow himself to fail, and that's tremendous." ...|$|E

Without cave diving training, Sorenson said, {{there was no}} way Ben could have gotten through some of the {{narrower}} passages, called restrictions by divers, in the cave. [...] "I know what I'm doing and I barely made it through," [...] he told the Commercial Appeal. [...] "The last place I searched was pristine, without a mark that a diver had been there.

2500|$|Throughout {{the fifth}} series, several {{people in the}} {{entertainment}} industry, including Ronan Keating, Noel Gallagher and Graham Norton questioned Minogue's judging credentials and mentoring ability. On 22 November 2008, during a live broadcast of the programme, Minogue broke down in tears {{and was unable to}} introduce one of her acts, Rachel Hylton, following an on-air row with Louis Walsh over a choice of song. Despite the controversies, she proved popular in public votes and polls. Minogue later stated that she did not enjoy her experience on the fifth series and [...] "would never want <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>that</b> again". Minogue returned for the sixth series in 2009. She chose Rachel Adedeji, Lucie Jones and Stacey Solomon as her final three acts to compete in the live shows and was assisted at the judges' houses stage by her older sister, Kylie Minogue. Despite losing Adedeji in week 4 and Jones the following week, Solomon went on to advance into the final and ultimately finish in third place. In 2010, Minogue was pregnant. She later stated that, as her baby's expected arrival in July would clash with filming for The X Factor, she would be unable to judge in the audition episodes for the seventh series. Minogue returned during the judges' houses round, selecting Nicolo Festa, Matt Cardle and Aiden Grimshaw as her final three, with Paije Richardson as her wildcard act. Minogue was assisted by fellow Australian and friend Natalie Imbruglia who was a guest judge in Birmingham that year filling in for Minogue. Cardle was her only act to make it into the final and eventually won, with Minogue becoming the winning mentor for the second time.|$|E
