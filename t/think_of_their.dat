5|$|He {{is always}} there, he knows everything. He is infallible but always failing. When the boys rescue him, he is {{typically}} emaciated, dehydrated, semi-conscious, delirious; they must succor him with candy bars and water. He {{can take on}} any shape, but reveals his identity within moments of doing so. He never discusses a case except the one he's working on in a given novel, so that his legendary close-mouthedness turns to garrulousness when a Hardy Boys novel begins, which is of course {{the only time we}} ever get to see him. All the same, he only discusses the case in enough detail to mislead his sons and put them in mortal danger. He has systems of information and data-gathering that put the FBI to shame, yet he is always losing his case notes, his ciphers, his microfilm, or some other valuable clue, usually by leaving it in his extra pair of pants, meaning that the Boys have to drive to Canada or Florida or somewhere to retrieve it. I suppose he isn't mysterious at all; he simply embodies what many <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> own fathers: utterly powerful, contemptibly inept.|$|E

25|$|O’Sullivan and {{her colleagues}} {{assessed}} 180 girls {{between the ages of}} 12 and 14 on their perceptions on what their first sexual encounters would be like; many girls reported feeling negative emotions towards sex before their first time. The researchers think this is because adolescent girls are taught that society views adolescent pre-marital sex in negative terms. When they reported positive feelings, the most commonly listed one was feeling attractive. This shows how many girls objectify their own bodies and often think about this before they <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> own sexual desires and needs.|$|E

25|$|Kristi N. Scott and M. Heather Dragoo {{note that}} another {{recurring}} {{theme in the}} “image-obsessed society,” is beauty, and its recurring relationship with individuality. Gough agreed, commenting that “when everyone is equal, beauty loses its meaning”. Beauty went {{hand in hand with}} identity: Uglies were taught to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> bodies and faces as “temporary”, something that would be replaced later with cosmetic surgery. A strong line is drawn to connect features with personality, and one critic stated that the characters develop “ugly” and “pretty” personalities with each stage of their operations.|$|E
500|$|Matt Johnson of Jesus Freak Hideout commented {{about the}} video on {{his review of}} MercyMe's album 10, noting that [...] "Most people think of serious worshipful songs (such as [...] "I Can Only Imagine" [...] & [...] "Word of God Speak") when they think of MercyMe, but the [...] "So Long Self" [...] video captures a side that most don't <b>think</b> <b>of,</b> <b>their</b> fun side".|$|E
500|$|In 2009, Rolling Stone Indonesia listed {{two songs}} that Goeslaw {{performed}} while with Potret in {{its list of}} the 150 Best Indonesian Songs of All Time, {{both of which were}} from the album Potret II. [...] "Salah" [...] ("Wrong") was ranked 74th, being noted as the best example of Goeslaw's [...] "fresh, direct, and often provocative nuances" [...] when writing songs and writing that her [...] "sweet" [...] vocals challenged the paradigm that a singer singing about an affair should be either a victim or full of revenge. The other song, [...] "Bunda" [...] ("Mother") was ranked at 110; it was noted being capable of making anyone, [...] "even the most cruel man", pause for a moment to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> mother. Rolling Stone Indonesia noted a decrease in the quality of Goeslaw's songs since Ada Apa Dengan Cinta?.|$|E

500|$|John Janick, the {{chairman}} and CEO of Interscope Geffen A Records, told Stefani that he was unsure of her songs [...] "connect with people", encouraging her to create an [...] "artistic record" [...] and to skip radio altogether. Janick later {{changed his mind and}} got in touch with Stefani after listening to [...] "Used to Love You". She called it [...] "the most personal song" [...] she'd ever written and appreciated Janick's decision commenting: [...] "That's never happened in my entire career." [...] After writing [...] "Truth", she was inspired to title the album with something similar. By the time several personal themed tracks were completed, Stefani began creating songs dealing with her newfound relationship with Shelton; [...] "Make Me Like You" [...] details [...] "the early stage of their romance", while the title track suggests what the public might <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> romance, with lyrics such as: [...] "They’re all gonna say I’m rebounding, so rebound all over me".|$|E
500|$|Satin himself became {{increasingly}} {{critical of the}} Greens. [...] He gave a featured speech at the U.S. Green gathering in 1987 urging them to avoid hyper-detailed platform writing and other projects and specialize in one thing– running people for office who endorse the Ten Key Values. [...] But the speech failed to persuade. [...] After the Green gathering in 1989, he urged them to abandon hippie-era fears of money, authority, and leadership. [...] After the 1990 gathering he complained [...] "I've been Pure before," [...] an allusion to {{his time in the}} New World Alliance. [...] According to Greta Gaard, he then bid farewell to the Greens, but recognized it as a loss: [...] "Whatever I may <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> internal battles and political prospects, the Greens are My People. [...] Their life choices are my life choices; their failings mirror my own." [...] Within a year of voicing those words, he stopped New Options Newsletter and applied to law school.|$|E
500|$|They find a small structure, {{and from}} its top the woman spots people. As {{they leave the}} structure, they <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> sand castle, {{wondering}} about its fate. The screen flashes to a scene of a lone bucket floating on a body of water, then flashes back. After a bit more traveling, the characters make contact with three androgynous people wearing headgear. The woman attempts to communicate, but the native language of the people is incomprehensible. She shows them her wound, and they treat it with a paste. The group then beckon {{the man and woman}} to follow them into town. After receiving water, the man and woman sleep. The following morning, the man communicates with one of the locals by drawing pictures in the dirt. The local informs that the sea level is, in fact, rising, and that the two characters should follow and see someone to talk to. They rest while on the way, where the man and woman look over a map from one of the locals. They continue to a city, and a castle behind it. They are led to the natives' leader, who, speaking the language of the protagonists poorly, explains the reason for the sea rising. She reveals that her people had erected a berm to keep what she calls [...] "the planet's mightiest river" [...] at bay, which is presently days away from breaking through and flooding the man and woman's home. She explains that the journey back to reach their home to warn the others living there would take too long and that they {{have no choice but to}} remain with the mountain people. Ignoring her, the man and woman flee and run back home, taking some of the mountain people's provisions on the way out and guiding themselves with maps that the woman had stolen.|$|E

2500|$|Mbenga–Mbuti Pygmy music {{consists}} {{of up to}} four parts and {{can be described as}} an [...] "ostinato with variations" [...] similar to a passacaglia in that it is cyclical. It is based on repetition of periods of equal length that each singer divides using different rhythmic figures specific to different repertoires and songs. This creates a detailed surface and endless variations not only of the same period repeated but of various performances of the same piece of music. As in some Balinese gamelan music these patterns are based on a super-pattern which is never heard. The Pygmies themselves do not learn or <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> music in this theoretical framework, but learn the music growing up.|$|E
2500|$|In 1978, Maxime Rodinson, a {{distinguished}} Marxist scholar of Islam, responded to French avant-garde enthusiasm for Khomeini's revolution in a three part article in Le Monde, by arguing that, {{in response to}} successive assaults by Crusaders, Mongols, Turks and Western imperialism, [...] Islamic countries had come to feel embattled, and the impoverished masses had come to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> elites, linked to foreigners, as devoid of traditional piety. Both nationalism and socialism imported from the West were recast in religious terms, {{in a process of}} political Islamicization which would be devoid of the progressive side of nationalism and revert to what he called [...] "a type of archaic fascism" [...] characterized by policing the state to enforce a totalitarian moral and social order.|$|E

2500|$|By 409, Emperor Daowu, who {{was said}} to be under the effect of {{poisonous}} substances given him by alchemists, was described to be so harsh and paranoid in his personality that he constantly feared rebellion, particularly because fortunetellers had been telling him that a rebellion would happen near him. [...] He occasionally would not eat for days, or would not sleep overnight. [...] He often mumbled about his past accomplishments or defeats, and he suspected all of his officials. [...] Sometimes when officials made reports to him, he would suddenly <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> past faults and punish or even kill them. [...] Occasionally, when others would behave even slightly inappropriately, he would be so angry that he would kill them personally and display their bodies outside the palace. [...] The entire government came under a spell of terror. [...] The only persons immune from this treatment were said to be the minister Cui Hong and his son Cui Hao, who were said to avoid the disaster by never offending or flattering the emperor—both of which could have brought disaster.|$|E

5000|$|In addition, {{the summary}} jury trial is a {{mechanism}} for forcing parties to hear what an unbiased jury really <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> case. All too often, parties in litigation have occasional communications via attorneys, {{with little or no}} outside correction or feedback given on the course <b>of</b> <b>their</b> litigation. In the summary jury trial, either the verdict returned will be a [...] "split the difference" [...] type decision, in which the parties will have been given an outline of a settlement, or the verdict will cause one party to worry about its chances at trial. In that event, that party is likely to be much more receptive to settlement offers from the other side.|$|R
