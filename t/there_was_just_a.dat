25|$|For {{elections}} to Dáil Éireann, Kilkenny {{is part of}} the Carlow–Kilkenny constituency which returns 5 TDs. The present form of the constituency was created for the 1948 general election. Kilkenny has been represented through several parliamentary constituencies in the past. From 1918–1921 Kilkenny was part of the North Kilkenny United Kingdom Parliamentary constituency. In 1921 the Carlow–Kilkenny Dáil Éireann constituency was created and has stayed apart from between 1937 and 1948 when <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> Kilkenny constituency. The TDs serving the area are currently John J. McGuinness, Phil Hogan, John Paul Phelan, Pat Deering and Ann Phelan.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} half Cork were the {{dominant}} team. This was helped {{by the addition of}} two of Cork's more experienced players to the game: Nicholas Murphy was brought on as a substitute at half-time by Cork manager Conor Counihan, while Graham Canty was brought on as a substitute soon afterwards. In the 56th minute Paul Kerrigan gave Cork back the lead which they relinquished after five minutes, with Goulding boosting this lead by scoring three '45s. Down's Benny Coulter and Daniel Hughes scored in the dying minutes but it was too late, even though <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> single point between the sides. Cork were victorious.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} duty of RAT Parents was to haze freshman {{members of}} the band and enforce RAT Rules. The modern role of RAT Parents is to welcome freshman band members, teach them Georgia Tech and band traditions, help them adjust to life at Tech and in the band and {{to act as a}} friend and advisor to them. In {{the early days of the}} tradition, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> Rat Mom, who was always a male band member. Since the mid-1980s, there has been both a RAT Mom and a RAT Dad, the latter of which is always a female band member. Until 1990, the selection of Rat Parents was fairly informal. From 1990 to 1993, RAT Parents were selected by the band's executive board, partly to keep the decision in the hands of the students. When the executive board was dissolved in 1993, the selection was made by the director of bands following an interview process. New RAT Parents are announced along with the new drum majors for the upcoming year.|$|E

25|$|The 1st Dalai Lama {{was based}} at Tashi Lhunpo Monastery, which he founded, the Second to the Fifth Dalai Lamas were mainly based at Drepung Monastery outside Lhasa. In 1645, after the {{unification}} of Tibet, the Fifth moved to {{the ruins of a}} royal fortress or residence on top of Marpori ('Red Mountain') in Lhasa and decided to build a palace on the same site. This ruined palace, called Tritse Marpo, was originally built around 636 AD by the founder of the Tibetan Empire, Songtsen Gampo for his Nepalese wife. Amongst the ruins <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> small temple left where Tsongkhapa had given a teaching when he arrived in Lhasa in the 1380s. The Fifth Dalai Lama began construction of the Potala Palace on this site in 1645, carefully incorporating what was left of his predecessor's palace into its structure. From then on and until today, unless on tour or in exile the Dalai Lamas have always spent their winters at the Potala Palace and their summers at the Norbulingka palace and park. Both palaces are in Lhasa and approximately 3km apart.|$|E
