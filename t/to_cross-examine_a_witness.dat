2500|$|Senior {{counsel for}} the {{applicant}} attacked the validity of par 12 of the Practice Note on two grounds. First it was put that at common law Royal Commissions have no coercive powers: McGuinness v Attorney-General for Victoria (1940) 63 CLR 73 at 98-99, Herald & Weekly Times Limited v Woodward [...] 1 VR 156 at 159. Any coercive powers must {{be found in the}} relevant statute under which the Royal Commission is established. Nothing in the Act compels the provision of a witness statement or its adoption in the witness box as prescribed in the Practice Note. It is impermissible to require, as a condition precedent to the exercise of the right to cross-examine, the performance of an obligation which is beyond the power of the Commissioner to impose. Paragraph 12 of the Practice Note is an attempt by the Commissioner to do indirectly what he cannot do directly: Wragg v New South Wales (1953) 88 CLR 353 at 387-8, Caltex Oil (Australia) Pty Ltd v Best (1990) 170 CLR 516 at 522. Further, it was said that the Commissioner did not have an unfettered discretion to grant or refuse leave to cross-examine. Secondly, it was put that the rules of natural justice may in some circumstances include the right <b>to</b> <b>cross-examine</b> <b>a</b> <b>witness</b> giving evidence adverse to a person affected. Paragraph 12 of the Practice Note was in absolute terms and applicable to all cross-examination, including cross-examination which was an exercise of rights conferred by the rules of natural justice.|$|E
50|$|In the United States federal Courts, a cross-examining {{attorney}} is typically {{not permitted to}} ask questions that do not pertain to the testimony offered during direct examination, but most state courts do permit a lawyer <b>to</b> <b>cross-examine</b> <b>a</b> <b>witness</b> on matters not raised during direct examination. Similarly, courts in England, South Africa, Australia, and Canada allow a cross-examiner to exceed the scope of direct examination.|$|E
5000|$|A {{significant}} {{issue at}} trial {{was the use}} of protective measures for several witnesses, such as anonymity (including keeping their names from the defence), submission of evidence from a room separate from the courtroom, and the distortion of the voices and images. The majority of the Trial Chamber allowed this motion on the basis that the Tribunal had a duty 'to protect witnesses who are genuinely frightened'. However, Judge Stephen dissented, arguing that it was unreasonable to ask the defence <b>to</b> <b>cross-examine</b> <b>a</b> <b>witness</b> who amounted to a 'disembodied and distorted voice transmitted by electronic means.' ...|$|E

Her case was remanded for a new trial. On October 6, 2006, she was convicted of voluntary manslaughter and sentenced to 13 to 45 years in prison.|$|R
500|$|The next week, Kinne's lawyers {{requested}} {{that she be}} released on bond, supported by a community petition signed by 132 supporters of her innocence. The motion was denied {{on the basis of}} first-degree murder not being a bailable offense; presiding judge Tom J. Stubbs also counseled Kinne's lawyers that he felt their involvement in such a petition at a time when a motion for bond was being considered was [...] "highly improper". A subsequent defense motion {{requested that}} Kinne's conviction be vacated because the jury had delivered its verdict based on [...] "surmise and speculation" [...] rather than [...] "substantial evidence". The motion also listed a series of procedural errors that Kinne's counsel alleged had taken place before and during the trial, including a juror taking [...] "incomplete" [...] notes, attorneys for both sides of the case having disputed John Boldizs's testimony, and an incorrect number of potential jurors being provided for selection. The motion was denied by Judge Stubbs in April 1962, but appealed to the Missouri Supreme Court, which in March 1963 reversed Kinne's conviction and ordered a new trial on the basis of Kinne's defense having been denied adequate peremptory challenges during jury selection in her trial. Kinne was denied an opportunity for bail in May 1963, but that ruling was overturned in July and Kinne was released on $25,000 bond, posted by her brother. The state's request that the Missouri Supreme Court re-consider its position on Kinne's conviction was granted, but in October 1963 that hearing resulted in further grounds being found for a new trial, this time {{on the basis of the}} prosecutor having been allowed <b>to</b> <b>cross-examine</b> <b>a</b> prosecution <b>witness.</b> <b>A</b> second request for a re-hearing on the validity of Kinne's conviction was denied by the Missouri Supreme Court. Kinne and her children moved in with her mother and awaited the start of her new trial.|$|R
5000|$|Pointer v. Texas, [...] was a {{decision}} by the United States Supreme Court involving the application of the right of to confront accusers in state court proceedings. The Sixth Amendment in the Bill of Rights states that, in criminal prosecutions, the defendant has a right [...] "...to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor..." [...] In this case, a person arrested in Texas for robbery was deprived of the ability <b>to</b> <b>cross-examine</b> <b>a</b> <b>witness</b> when the lower court allowed the introduction of a transcript of that witness's earlier testimony at a preliminary proceeding instead of compelling attendance by the witness at trial.|$|E
5000|$|Courts permit parties <b>to</b> <b>cross-examine</b> <b>a</b> <b>witness</b> {{in order}} to impeach that witness based on {{demonstration}} of bias. Witness bias may be catalyzed by any number of circumstances, ranging from the witness's blood relationship to a party to his financial stake {{in the outcome of}} the litigation. Most US jurisdictions require a cross-examiner to lay a foundation before extrinsic evidence can be used to demonstrate bias for impeachment purposes. Although Rule 610 provides that evidence of a witness's [...] "religious beliefs or opinions is not admissible to attack or support the witness's credibility," [...] an inquiry into the witness's religious beliefs or opinions for the purpose of showing interest or bias because of them is not within the rule's prohibition.|$|E
5000|$|Generally, {{having the}} {{opportunity}} <b>to</b> <b>cross-examine</b> <b>a</b> <b>witness</b> at trial will satisfy the Confrontation Clause's guarantee. And trial courts are given [...] "broad discretion [...] [...] [...] to preclude repetitive and unduly harassing interrogation." [...] The Supreme Court has {{emphasized that the}} [...] "Confrontation Clause guarantees an opportunity for effective cross-examination, not cross-examination that is in whatever way, and to whatever extent, the defendant might wish. [...] Nonetheless, a trial court cannot preclude cross-examination on some subjects. Besides {{the subject matter of}} the case, the crime for which a defendant is charged, a defendant has the right to attack the credibility or impeach the testimony of the witness. Despite trial courts' [...] "broad discretion", it is an error to limit defendants from cross-examining witnesses on an area that would expose a [...] "prototypical form of bias" [...] that would be relevant to the jury's assessment of that witness's credibility. [...] Examples of such biases include being on probation as a juvenile delinquent, even where the state normally considers such a status to be protected confidential information; having charges dropped in exchange for testimony, despite a specific denial that dropping the charges had any effect on the testimony; and shared allegiances of the victim and witness, including gang membership.|$|E

Id. at 138 - 39, 118 A. 3 d at 944.

25|$|Under the Court's analysis, the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment {{provides}} for defendants to confront witnesses that testify against them.

40|$|The {{common law}} rule in Browne v Dunn {{essentially}} is {{a rule of}} fairness. It ensures that witnesses {{have the opportunity to}} explain if the opposing party intends to later contradict or discredit them. Recently in Australia, doubt has been cast as to whether the rule applies in criminal proceedings. However, in MWJ v R, the High Court confirmed that the rule, with significant qualifications, applied to criminal cases. Possibly the most important qualifications are that the court must consider the nature and course of proceedings in evaluating the consequences of <b>a</b> failure <b>to</b> <b>cross-examine</b> on <b>a</b> point on which the party relies and that application of the rule must not displace the prosecution’s burden of proof.

The court found that the trial judge had committed constitutional error in limiting the cross-examination, but held the error to be harmless and affirmed the conviction. The Supreme Court of California denied review. The federal district court denied Tuite’s petition for habeas corpus.
