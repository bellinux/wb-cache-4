Alice wanted to <b>tighten</b> <b>the</b> {{relationship}} of the principality and the Byzantine Empire; therefore, she offered Constance's hand to Manuel, a son of the Byzantine Emperor, John II Komnenos. To prevent the Byzantine marriage, Fulk sent his envoy France to Raymond of Poitiers to urge {{him to come to}} Antioch, which he did, traveling in disguise, because RogerII of Sicily wanted to capture him in southern Italy.|$|E
5|$|On 23 April 1945, the Soviet 1st Belorussian Front and 1st Ukrainian Front {{continued}} to <b>tighten</b> <b>the</b> encirclement, severing the last {{link between the}} German IX Army and the city. Elements of the 1st Ukrainian Front {{continued to}} move westward and started to engage the German XII Army moving towards Berlin. On this same day, Hitler appointed General Helmuth Weidling as {{the commander of the}} Berlin Defence Area, replacing Lieutenant General Reymann. Meanwhile, by 24 April 1945 elements of 1st Belorussian Front and 1st Ukrainian Front had completed the encirclement of the city. Within the next day, 25 April 1945, the Soviet investment of Berlin was consolidated, with leading Soviet units probing and penetrating the S-Bahn defensive ring. By the end of the day, {{it was clear that the}} German defence of the city could not do anything but temporarily delay the capture of the city by the Soviets, since the decisive stages of the battle had already been fought and lost by the Germans outside the city. By that time, Schörner's offensive, initially successful, had mostly been thwarted, although he did manage to inflict significant casualties on the opposing Polish and Soviet units, slowing down their progress.|$|E

Iohannis is also widely credited with turning the city into one of Romania's most popular tourist destinations thanks to the extensive renovation of the old downtown.

Since 2008, FDGR has 14 out of 23 councilors, PDL has 4, PSD has 3, and PNL has 2.|$|E
25|$|In 1986, Bartlett and Van Buren {{noted that}} lunar laser ranging had {{detected}} a 2-km offset between the moon’s center of figure and its center of mass. This indicates an asymmetry {{in the distribution}} of Fe (abundant in the Moon's core) and Al (abundant in its crust and mantle). If pressure did not contribute equally to spacetime curvature as does mass-energy, the moon would not be in the orbit predicted by classical mechanics.

25|$|Cunninghams, which <b>tighten</b> <b>the</b> luff of a boom-footed sail {{by pulling}} {{downward}} on a cringle in the luff of a mainsail above the tack. The {{idea is to}} flatten the main sail in heavier weather or when sailing to windward. In its simplest form a stainless steel hook that goes through the cringle. From the hook a cordage tail passes through a turnblock on the deck {{at the base of}} the mast and back to a cleat on the deck. Often the tail is split so the cunningham can be operated from either sidedeck in a racing dinghy.|$|E
25|$|Hanging is {{a common}} method for suicide. The {{materials}} necessary for suicide by hanging are readily available to the average person, compared with firearms or poisons. Full suspension is not required, and for this reason, hanging is especially commonplace among suicidal prisoners (see suicide watch). A type of hanging comparable to full suspension hanging may be obtained by self-strangulation using a ligature around the neck and the partial weight of the body (partial suspension) to <b>tighten</b> <b>the</b> ligature. When a suicidal hanging involves partial suspension the deceased is found to have both feet touching the ground, e.g., they are kneeling, crouching or standing.|$|E

Other setbacks follow; with the arrival of a seasoned Ottoman general from the Gallipoli front, as well as reinforcements from the regular army. The Ottomans begin to <b>tighten</b> <b>the</b> noose around Musa Dagh. Bagradian recovers from his grief, to form guerrilla bands to disrupt the Ottoman advance and buy more time.
