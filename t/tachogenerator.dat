50|$|The {{latter half}} of the 1960s had seen the {{widespread}} introduction of solid state electronics and these locomotives incorporated a control system where speed was detected electronically rather than mechanically. A signal from a <b>tachogenerator</b> was used to close contactors in sequence at given speeds to activate the motor's field weakening process, rather than through contacts and relays as in earlier types. The control system ensured the traction motors and main generator were all operated within the continuous rating of the machines except in full field conditions when the driver was able to judge how long to remain in the short-term rating condition.There were two variants of the Class 25/3 sub-class. Early 25/3 AV locomotives were fitted with vacuum brakes and in due course many of these were dual braked and redesignated 25/3 BX. By the time the last few locomotives were under construction dual braking had become the norm and ten of the last batch from Derby were built new as 25/3 BX locomotives for work out of Willesden on the recently upgraded West Coast Main Line.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} {{implement}} the vector control technique, the motor speed information is required. <b>Tachogenerators,</b> resolvers or incremental encoders are used to detect the speed. These sensors require careful mounting and alignment and special attention is required with electrical noises. Speed sensor needs additional space for mounting and maintenance and hence increases the cost {{and the size of}} the drive system. These problems are eliminated by speed sensorless vector control by using model reference adaptive system. Model reference adaptive system is a speed estimation method having two models namely reference and adaptive model. The error between two models estimates induction motor speed. This project proposes a Model Reference Adaptive System (MRAS) for estimation of speed of induction motor.

40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} of the present paper is designing 8051 Microcontroller based Embedded Closed Loop Speed Control System of DC Motor to study the reaction of controlled variable to set-point changes. In this present scheme a <b>tachogenerator</b> {{has been used as}} a speed sensor which generates a back emf corresponding to the speed attained by the DC Motor. This instantaneous value of output voltage provided by the <b>tachogenerator</b> is then compared with the desired voltage corresponding to the desired speed. The resulting error is used by the microcontroller to control the firing angle of the SCR for controlling the voltage applied to the DC Motor which in turn adjusts directly the motor speed to attain the desired value.

40|$|AC drives {{based on}} fully digital control {{have reached the}} status of a {{maturing}} technology in a broad range of applications ranging from the low cost to high performance systems. Continuing research has concentrated on the removal of the sensors measuring the mechanical coordinates (e. g. <b>tachogenerators,</b> encoders) while maintaining the cost and performance of the control system. Speed estimation is an issue of particular interest with induction motor electrical drives as the rotor speed is generally different from the speed of the revolving magnetic field. The advantages of sensorless drives are lower cost, reduced size of the machine set, elimination of the sensor cable and reliability. However, due to the high order and nonlinearity of the IM dynamics, estimation of the angle speed without the measurement of mechanical variables becomes a challenging problem. Variety of solutions has been proposed to solve this problem in the literature. In this thesis work, by combining the variable structure systems and Lyapunov designs a new sensorless sliding mode observer algorithm for induction motor is developed. A Lyapunov function is chosen to estimate the rotor flux of an induction motor under any initial condition based on the principle that the aim of the vector control of IM is to keep the rotor flux magnitude constant from zero to nominal speed. Additionally, an observer estimating the rotor speed and the rotor time constant of the machine simultaneously has been proposed that stems from the flux estimation. The proposed method is very suitable for closed loop high-performance sensorless drives and it is believed that with its new approach it will help many researchers in their further work in the field of sensorless vector control of IM...|$|R

40|$|The {{object of}} this thesis {{is to build}} an {{interface}} between a computor and a three phase thyristor bridge rectifier, enabling the computor to control its D. C. output voltage. By writing a suitable computor program, this system was extended to provide closed loop computor control {{of the speed of}} a D. C. machine. The first interface and computor program were so designed that the computer provided the required analogue triggering delay for voltage control of the D. C. output. This setup did not allow for infinite variation of the voltage and occupied {{a large portion of the}} computor time. Thus it was decided to modify the interface, letting it provide its own delay, thus freeing the computor of the delay routine and giving it more time to do other tasks. Control of the bridge rectifier was also improved. When closed loop control was implemented, the system was found to be unstable. It was thus simulated and stabilized on the analogue computor. A new digital computor program was written incorporating those characteristics which were found necessary in the simulation to make the system stable. The modified form of compensation was found to give a satisfactory performance for both step and ramp inputs to the system as well as load transients on the D. C. motor. Various types of <b>tachogenerator</b> were tested to find which was the most suitable for operation with the computer. All the types tested gave satisfactory performances. The major factor affecting performance was the quality of the <b>tachogenerator...</b>|$|E

However, the speed control application on universal motor by peripheral interface controller (PIC) may be done with more simple hardware and software program. Generally, the microcontrollers are preferred because of their capability to find solutions {{for all kinds of}} control problems that couldn’t be solved by the microprocessors. Hence, they have been developed rapidly and used in various fields recently. Also due to superior capabilities of the PIC, they are preferred on the universal motor speed control. Usually, two different methods have been used on the universal motor speed controls; one is period measuring and the other is frequency measuring. In this study, both methods were applied on the universal motor speed control.

40|$|The paper {{describes}} the designing of a closed loop {{model of the}} dc motor drive for controlling speed. Accuracy and the dynamic responses are better in a closed loop system. In the closed loop system, acceleration and the deceleration of the motor can be controlled according to the requirement. In order to regulate drives automatically, the controlled variables are measured. A <b>tachogenerator</b> is used for this purpose. The output of the tachogenerators is compared with a preset reference voltage. The differences between these two signals are fed as an actuating signal to control {{the elements of the}} system. Control amplifiers are used as both comparators and amplifiers. As a small change in the voltage can cause a large change in the motor current and lead to a particular drive control feature. There are two closed paths in the dc control scheme. One is the outer speed control loop and the other is the inner current control loop. Both the loops are controlled with the help of P-I controllers having their own gains and the time constants according to the requirement of the system. The output of the speed P-I controller which is the function of the speed error is used to command for current P-I controller and compared with armature current. The current P-I controller output control the triggering circuit of the converter. The armature current tends to increase to a large value when the motor is accelerating. A current limit can be obtained in this system by limiting the maximum current command voltage. If the motor speed drops below the set point, the resulting error signal causes the gate pulse generator to advance the firing pulses, and increase the rectifier output voltage. Consequently the speed rises to the desired leve...|$|E
