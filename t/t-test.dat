25|$|The {{independent}} samples <b>t-test</b> is used when two separate sets of independent and identically distributed samples are obtained, one {{from each of}} the two populations being compared. For example, suppose we are evaluating the effect of a medical treatment, and we enroll 100subjects into our study, then randomly assign 50subjects to the treatment group and 50subjects to the control group. In this case, we have two {{independent samples}} and would use the unpaired form of the <b>t-test.</b> The randomization is not essential here – if we contacted 100people by phone and obtained each person's age and gender, and then used a two-sample <b>t-test</b> to see whether the mean ages differ by gender, this would also be an independent samples <b>t-test,</b> even though the data are observational.|$|E

40|$|Recently, a novel CD 4 + T-cell {{developmental}} pathway {{was reported}} that generates thymocyte–thymocyte (<b>T–T)</b> CD 4 + T cells. We established a mouse system (CIITAtgCIITApIV−/−) where thymic positive selection occurred only by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II+ thymocytes. <b>T–T</b> CD 4 + T cells selected via MHC class II-dependent <b>T–T</b> interaction are comprised of PLZF-negative and innate PLZF-positive populations. Until recently, the functional role of the PLZF-negative population was unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that naïve <b>T–T</b> CD 4 + T cells provide B-cell help to a level comparable with that of naïve conventional CD 4 + T cells.

25|$|The {{t-distribution}} {{plays a role}} in {{a number}} of widely used statistical analyses, including Student's <b>t-test</b> for assessing the statistical significance of the difference between two sample means, the construction of confidence intervals for the difference between two population means, and in linear regression analysis.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the relative roles in vivo of Saccharomyces cerevisiae DNA polymerase η, DNA polymerase ζ, Rev 1 protein, and the DNA polymerase δ subunit, Pol 32, in the bypass of an abasic site, <b>T-T</b> (6 - 4) photoadduct and <b>T-T</b> cis-syn cyclobutane dimer, by transforming strains deleted for RAD 30, REV 3, REV 1, or POL 32 with duplex plasmids carrying one of these DNA lesions located within a 28 -nucleotide single-stranded region. DNA polymerase η {{was found to be}} involved only rarely in the bypass of the <b>T-T</b> (6 - 4) photoadduct or the abasic sites in the sequence context used, although, as expected, it was solely responsible for the bypass of the <b>T-T</b> dimer. We argue that DNA polymerase ζ, rather than DNA polymerase δ as previously suggested, is responsible for insertion in bypass events other than those in which polymerase η performs this function. However, DNA polymerase δ is involved indirectly in mutagenesis, since the strain lacking its Pol 32 subunit, known to be deficient in mutagenesis, shows as little bypass of the <b>T-T</b> (6 - 4) photoadduct or the abasic sites as those deficient in Pol ζ or Rev 1. In contrast, bypass of the <b>T-T</b> dimer in the pol 32 Δ strain occurs at the wild-type frequency...|$|R
25|$|Hypothesis-driven {{statistical}} analysis: Identification of {{statistically significant}} changes in gene expression are commonly identified using the <b>t-test,</b> ANOVA, Bayesian method Mann–Whitney test methods tailored to microarray data sets, which take into account multiple comparisons or cluster analysis. These methods assess statistical power based on the variation present in the data {{and the number of}} experimental replicates, and can help minimize Type I and type II errors in the analyses.|$|E
25|$|If {{the test}} {{statistic}} follows a Student's t-distribution in {{the null hypothesis}} – which is common where the underlying variable follows a normal distribution with unknown scaling factor, then the test {{is referred to as}} a one-tailed or two-tailed <b>t-test.</b> If the test is performed using the actual population mean and variance, rather than an estimate from a sample, it would be called a one-tailed or two-tailed Z-test.|$|E
25|$|For the {{important}} {{case in which}} the data are hypothesized to follow the normal distribution, depending {{on the nature of the}} test statistic and thus the underlying hypothesis of the test statistic, different null hypothesis tests have been developed. Some such tests are z-test for normal distribution, <b>t-test</b> for Student's t-distribution, f-test for f-distribution. When the data do not follow a normal distribution, it can still be possible to approximate the distribution of these test statistics by a normal distribution by invoking the central limit theorem for large samples, as in the case of Pearson's chi-squared test.|$|E

25|$|Bayesian {{inference}} is one proposed {{alternative to}} significance testing. (Nickerson cited 10 sources suggesting it, including Rozeboom (1960)). For example, Bayesian parameter estimation can provide rich {{information about the}} data from which researchers can draw inferences, while using uncertain priors that exert only minimal influence on the results when enough data is available. Psychologist John K. Kruschke has suggested Bayesian estimation as an alternative for the <b>t-test.</b> Alternatively two competing models/hypothesis can be compared using Bayes factors. Bayesian methods could be criticized for requiring information that is seldom available in the cases where significance testing is most heavily used. Neither the prior probabilities nor the probability distribution of the test statistic under the alternative hypothesis are often available in the social sciences.|$|E
2500|$|When the {{normality}} assumption {{does not}} hold, a non-parametric {{alternative to the}} <b>t-test</b> can often have better statistical power. Similarly, {{in the presence of}} an outlier, the <b>t-test</b> is not robust. For example, for two independent samples when the data distributions are asymmetric [...] (that is, the distributions are skewed) or the distributions have large tails, then the Wilcoxon rank-sum test (also known as the Mann–Whitney U test) can have three to four times higher power than the <b>t-test.</b> The nonparametric counterpart to the paired samples <b>t-test</b> is the Wilcoxon signed-rank test for paired samples. For a discussion on choosing between the <b>t-test</b> and nonparametric alternatives, see Sawilowsky (2005).|$|E
2500|$|If using Student's {{original}} {{definition of}} the <b>t-test,</b> the two populations being compared {{should have the same}} variance (testable using F-test, Levene's test, Bartlett's test, or the Brown–Forsythe test; or assessable graphically using a Q–Q plot). [...] If the sample sizes in the two groups being compared are equal, Student's original <b>t-test</b> is highly robust to the presence of unequal variances. Welch's <b>t-test</b> is insensitive to equality of the variances regardless of whether the sample sizes are similar.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{identify}} human spermatozoal surface autoantigens, suspensions of previously frozen washed sperm were ground and ultracentrifuged (170, 000 g for 60 min). The antigenicity of the fast supernatant (FS) and the fast pellet (FP) were defined by specific inhibition of spermotoxic and various sperm-agglutinating activities of autoimmune human sera (WHO Reference Bank). The FS and the urea-soluble extract of FP were fractionated on Sephadex G- 200 columns, and the antigenicity of these fractions was similarly defined. Both FS and FP inhibited, to variable extents, the anti-sperm activities. Inhibition of head-to-head (H-H) agglutination by FS was twice as strong as by FP. The reverse was observed with tail-to-tail (<b>T-T)</b> agglutination. Ten times more FS than FP was necessary to inhibit the spermotoxicity of all tested sera. Four fractions were collected after FS filtration on Sephadex G- 200. F 1, a homogeneous protein, inhibited spermotoxicity and H-H agglutination F 2 inhibited all activities (including <b>T-T</b> agglutination). F 3, a low molecular weight fraction, selectively inhibited H-H agglutination. F 4 was inactive. Treatment by 8 M urea allowed a partial solubilization of FP antigenicity. Urea-soluble fractions inhibited spermotoxicity and H-H but not <b>T-T</b> agglutination. The antigen(s) involved in <b>T-T</b> agglutination is (are) destroyed by urea since the urea-treated FP was no longer able significantly to decrease <b>T-T</b> agglutination. These results suggest that at least three different autoantigens are responsible for H-H sperm agglutination, <b>T-T</b> sperm agglutination and spermotoxicity respectively...|$|R

2500|$|A <b>t-test</b> is most {{commonly}} applied when the test statistic would follow a normal distribution if {{the value of}} a scaling term in the test statistic were known. [...] When the scaling term is unknown and is replaced by an estimate based on the data, the test statistics (under certain conditions) follow a Student's t distribution. The <b>t-test</b> can be used, for example, to determine if two sets of data are significantly different from each other.|$|E
2500|$|For exactness, the <b>t-test</b> and Z-test require {{normality}} of {{the sample}} means, and the <b>t-test</b> additionally requires that the sample variance follows a scaled χ2 distribution, and that the sample mean and sample variance be statistically independent. [...] Normality of the individual data values is not required if these conditions are met. [...] By the central limit theorem, sample means of moderately large samples are often well-approximated by a normal distribution even if the data are not normally distributed. [...] For non-normal data, the distribution {{of the sample}} variance may deviate substantially from a χ2 distribution. [...] However, if the sample size is large, Slutsky's theorem implies that {{the distribution of the}} sample variance has little effect on the distribution of the test statistic. If the data are substantially non-normal and the sample size is small, the <b>t-test</b> can give misleading results.

40|$|We {{present the}} results of {{anelastic}} and dielectric spectroscopy measurements performed on large-grain, ceramic PbZr 1 -xTixO 3 (PZT) compositions located near the two morphotropic phase boundaries (MPBs) that separate the ferroelectric (FE) rhombohedral (R) phase from the Zr-rich antiferroelectric and Ti-rich FE tetragonal phases. Additional evidence is provided {{of the existence of}} a temperature T-IT, which we interpret as the onset of the tilt instability in the R phase, where tilting is initially frustrated by lattice disorder but achieves long-range order at the lower temperature <b>T-T.</b> The T-IT (x) line is observed for x < 0. 17, beginning at the <b>T-T</b> (x) line at the point where <b>T-T</b> (x) drops abruptly and then continuing up to the T-C (x) line. If T-IT (x) indeed signals the onset of short-range ordered tilting, then it follows that the tilt instability lines should tend to be attracted and merge with those of the polar instabilities. Not only does the T-IT (x) line bend toward and then merge with the T-C (x) line but, in our series of samples, the temperature T-MPB defined by the dielectric and anelastic maxima at the rhombohedral/tetragonal MPB does not cross the <b>T-T</b> (x) line. Instead it gradually bends downward to become parallel to, and possibly merges with, the <b>T-T</b> (x) line. An abrupt change is found {{in the shape of the}} anelastic anomaly at <b>T-T</b> when x passes from 0. 465 to 0. 48, possibly indicative of a rhombohedral/monoclinic boundary.
