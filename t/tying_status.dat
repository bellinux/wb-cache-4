[...] Although exact multilateral aid figures (to the African Development Bank, International Development Association, various UN agencies, etc.) from donor to recipient countries are not reported, the OECD has imputed these values, and they suggest that {{a higher proportion of}} Canadian aid to the DRC has gone through the latter channels than for most donor countries (29% vs. 26%). Total OECD Development Assistance Committee disbursements exceeded commitments by 13% over these five decades mainly because commitment figures were not reported until the year 1966 (and imputed multilateral data began in 1975). Canada reportedly provided US$10,000 in grants to Congo (Kinshasa) in each of the years 1960 and 1964 (approximately 0.1% of the total aid), in addition to financing faculty posts and university bursaries, and providing twelve Canadian technical assistance staff in the field of education.

30|$|In parallel, {{the pattern}} of {{generating}} issue lists to facilitate negotiation among coalitions aligns with Wood and McKinley’s (2010 : 73) argument {{that the level of}} consensus among knowledgeable peers determines whether an entrepreneurial opportunity is objectified or abandoned. Objectified opportunities become enacted “through entrainment of stakeholders into a consensus to support the opportunity.” Social ties and reputation are important factors in the entrainment process. Christensen et al. (2011) emphasize that stakeholder expectations shape which targets a firm selects and how much disruption the firm is willing to incur in its M&A strategies. This argument corresponds to our finding that the issue list method to building consensus determines the perceived value of a merger deal.

40|$|Abstract Background This article {{provides}} {{new insights into}} the impact of social engagement on CVD risk factors in older adults. We hypothesized that objective (social participation, social <b>ties</b> and marital <b>status)</b> and subjective (emotional support) aspects of social engagement are independently associated with objective measures of cardiovascular risk. Methods Data from the English Longitudinal Study on Ageing (ELSA) were analyzed. The effects of social participation, social <b>ties,</b> marital <b>status,</b> and emotional support on hypertension, obesity, high sensitivity C-reactive protein, and fibrinogen were estimated by logistic regression controlling for age, sex, education, physical function, depression, cardiovascular disease, other chronic diseases, physical activity, and smoking. Results Social participation is a consistent predictor of low risk for four risk factors, even after controlling {{for a wide range of}} covariates. Being married is associated with lower risk for hypertension. Social ties and emotional support are not significantly associated with any of the cardiovascular risk factors. Conclusion Our analysis suggests that participation in social activities has a stronger association with CV risk factors than marital <b>status,</b> social <b>ties</b> or emotional support. Different forms of social engagement may therefore have different implications for the biological risk factors involved. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to gain insight into the {{relations}} between gender, networking behavior and network structure, in order to investigate the relevance of gender for organizational networks. Semi-structured interviews with 39 white, Dutch, women and men account managers were analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively. Our study's results show that the men account managers employ exchange and affect-based trust networking and, to a lesser extent, authoritative networking, whereas the women account managers employ affect-based trust and also use exchange. Authoritative networking appears to foster higher <b>status</b> <b>ties,</b> exchange networking behavior fosters lower <b>status</b> <b>ties</b> and affect-based trust networking fosters equal <b>status</b> <b>ties.</b> Gender differences in network structure may be explained by networking behavior rather than by gender. Our study is limited by the size of our group of respondents (n = 39). A larger sample is needed to test hypotheses concerning the relations between networking behavior, network structure and gender in a more rigorous manner than our study allowed. However, our research material enabled us to test these relations in a sound, be it preliminary way. Our study suggests to focus less on gender as a demographic bivariate category to explain gender differences in network structures and outcomes. In so doing, organizational network research will gain more insight into how gender expectations are negotiated in networking. In organizational practice, this will support organization members to employ the diversity of networking behaviors necessary to generate optimal network structures and outcomes. While most organizational network research focuses on network structures, we introduce the relational process of fostering network relations as central to women's and men's networking behavior. Networking behavior may have greater explanatory power for differences in network structure, than gender as a demographic, bivariate variable.

30|$|This {{study does}} lend credence, however, {{to the idea}} that the {{homeland}} and its values remain important arbiters social status for Senegalese migrants (Kaag, 2008; Kane, 2011; Riccio, 2008). There are strong effects of short visits, social ties, repeat migration, plans to return, and work-related motivation on non-mobile transnational activities. This shows that Senegalese migrants’ cross-border engagement is largely motivated by a desire to return to Senegal eventually. A logic of accumulation at origin may thus dominate a logic of integration at destination (Van Nieuwenhuyze, 2008); both of these logics, however, are potentially blocked by lack of secure legal status: migrants without “papers” are both directly blocked from transnational participation via legal exclusion from border crossing, and indirectly blocked by physical caging in the destination and the concomitant withering of social <b>ties.</b> Legal <b>status</b> is thus of key importance in keeping open the door to returns to the homeland.|$|R

40|$|Drawing {{from social}} network theory, {{scholars}} have identified two {{ways in which}} social ties influence venture capital investment decisions: directly through personal ties and indirectly through status hierarchies. Previous research has examined these effects independently. Our study {{is the first to}} perform a joint examination of the role of social <b>ties</b> and <b>status</b> hierarchies in venture capital decision making. We examine the relative importance of these two mechanisms through an adaptive choice-based conjoint experiment comprising of 3, 132 investment decisions made by 86 venture capitalists from the United States and Europe. Our experimental context allows us to explore whether, under high levels of market uncertainty, strong personal ties exert more influence over investment decisions than the presence of a high-status investor in the deal. We also explore the moderating effects that market structure and experience play in shaping these decision processes. Our findings reveal that personal ties are more important in venture capital decision making when compared to the relative status of other venture capital firms participating in the investment syndicate. Building on our main findings, we show that the influence of personal ties is less pronounced in the European investment community, as compared to more densely networked U. S. investors. We also find a U-shaped relationship between venture capitalist experience and the influence of personal networks on investment decisions. (authors' abstract...|$|R

We extend previous research by systematically testing a variety of factors, including health behaviors, social <b>ties,</b> socioeconomic <b>status,</b> and biological indicators of health. We employ the National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey III Linked Mortality File and use Cox proportional hazards models to examine sex differences in adult mortality in the United States. Our findings document that social and behavioral characteristics are key factors related to the sex gap in mortality. Once we control for women’s lower levels of marriage, poverty, and exercise, the sex gap in mortality widens; and once we control for women’s greater propensity to visit with friends and relatives, attend religious services, and abstain from smoking, the sex gap in mortality narrows. Biological factors— including indicators of inflammation and cardiovascular risk—also inform sex differences in mortality. Nevertheless, persistent sex differences in mortality remain: compared with women, men have 30 % to 83 % higher risks of death over the follow-up period, depending on the covariates included in the model. Although the prevalence of risk factors differs by sex, the impact of those risk factors on mortality is similar for men and women...|$|R
