50|$|The car {{launched}} in 1929 had a 4-cylinder V4 engine of 980cc mounted {{at the front}} and fed by two fuel pumps. Power, maximum output of which was claimed at 25PS, was transmitted to the rear wheels via a 3-speed manual <b>transmission</b> <b>controlled</b> from a <b>lever</b> {{in the middle of}} the floor. The wheels were attached to rigid axles each suspended on a traditional transverse leaf spring.|$|R
50|$|The Dogcart was a wood-bodied vehicle {{powered by}} a 10 hp {{flat-twin}} horizontally opposed engine with four pistons mounted beneath the floor, which was started by pulling on a rope. The vehicle boasted chain final drive and its high-wheeled, solid-tyred, horse-carriage type of body was retained well into the 1900s. The brakes were arranged {{in the form of}} shoes which could be pressed {{on the back of the}} solid rear tyres, and the suspension comprised full elliptic leaf springs at the front, and half-elliptics at the rear. <b>Transmission</b> and brake <b>control</b> <b>levers</b> were mounted close to the driver's right hand.|$|R
50|$|As built, {{they were}} fitted with petrol engines, {{the first four}} (CPH 3-6) {{receiving}} a 6-cylinder 75 hp Thornycroft Z6 and the others a 6-cylinder 95 hp Leyland type and a four-speed mechanical <b>transmission</b> <b>controlled</b> by a <b>lever</b> in the cab. Some units were later fitted with a 6-cylinder 150 hp Leyland petrol engine and a Lysholm-Smith hydraulic transmission. Experiments were also made with AEC and Winton engines in some vehicles. A 6-cylinder 120hp Leyland diesel engine was also trialled in one unit. During World War 2, to conserve fuel, gas producer units were fitted to six vehicles. Five of these six were destroyed when fire spread to the vehicle. Beginning in 1945, a programme began to replace the petrol engines with 6-cylinder GM Detroit Diesel 71 Series engines and Twin Disc 3-position hydraulic transmissions. It was also {{at this time that}} multiple unit controls were fitted. A single driver's cab and multiple unit controls were fitted to the No.2 End of the five trailer cars at this time.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Transmission control {{protocol}} veno is a wireless <b>transmission</b> congestion <b>control</b> algorithm which can better distinguish different loss. It determines whether the packets random loss or congestion loss through calculate to the packets number of backlog in the network. However, <b>transmission</b> <b>control</b> protocol veno {{does not change}} the congestion window in the slow start, and it is same to the traditional <b>transmission</b> <b>control</b> protocol. <b>Transmission</b> <b>control</b> protocol adaptive delay and loss response controls the congestion window base on the sender judgments changes in the relevant window and measures round-trip time. It improves the performance of <b>transmission</b> <b>control</b> protocol than the conventional <b>transmission</b> <b>control</b> protocol on the satellite network <b>transmission</b> <b>control</b> protocol. Taking into account the characteristic of both congestion control algorithms respectively, we propose an enhanced <b>transmission</b> <b>control</b> protocol that introduces ideas of <b>transmission</b> <b>control</b> protocol veno distinguish between random packet loss and congestion loss. Our scheme can distinguish the different loss and increase the number of congestion window distinctively in the slow start.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{algorithm}} for multiarmed bandits that achieves almost optimal performance in both stochastic and adversarial regimes without prior {{knowledge about the}} nature of the environment. Our algorithm is based on augmentation of the EXP 3 algorithm with a new <b>control</b> <b>lever</b> in the form of exploration parameters that are tailored individually for each arm. The algorithm si-multaneously applies the “old ” <b>control</b> <b>lever,</b> the learning rate, to control the regret in the adver-sarial regime and the new <b>control</b> <b>lever</b> to detect and exploit gaps between the arm losses. This secures problem-dependent “logarithmic ” regret when gaps are present without compromising on the worst-case performance guarantee in the ad-versarial regime. We show that the algorithm can exploit both the usual expected gaps between the arm losses in the stochastic regime and determin-istic gaps between the arm losses in the adver-sarial regime. The algorithm retains “logarith-mic ” regret guarantee in the stochastic regime even when some observations are contaminated by an adversary, as long as on average the con-tamination does not reduce the gap by more than a half. Our results for the stochastic regime are supported by experimental validation...|$|R

"The {{finger and}} thumb <b>control</b> <b>lever</b> {{works in a}} small {{quadrant}} which is marked at the top [...] "Traffic" [...] then [...] "High" [...] and at the bottom [...] "Low" [...] and finally [...] "Cold" [...] with spaces in between. Variations of this lever govern engine speeds. The forward, neutral and reverse positions for the central hand lever are stepped. To start the car from rest a driver presses out his clutch, moves his hand lever forward, and lets in the clutch in the ordinary way with slight acceleration. Thereafter {{the whole of the}} drive is done with the accelerator pedal, the accelerator allowing the engine to run up and keep constant maximum speed governed by the <b>control</b> <b>lever</b> {{on the top of the}} steering wheel by which engine braking power can also be regulated. When the accelerator is pressed after being released the effect is rather similar to that with a free wheel in use, in that the engine picks up to the speed that is suitable to the drive.
