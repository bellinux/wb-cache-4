50|$|Like his stablemate Chiyotaikai, Chiyohakuhō favoured {{pushing and}} {{thrusting}} techniques, as opposed <b>to</b> <b>grabbing</b> the opponent's mawashi. His most common winning kimarite were oshi-dashi, the push-out, hataki-komi, the slap down, and tsuki-otoshi, the thrust over.|$|R
50|$|The {{requests}} for grabbing include a field for specifying {{what happens to}} events that would be sent <b>to</b> the <b>grabbing</b> client {{even if it had}} not established the grab. In particular, the client can request them to be sent as usual or according <b>to</b> the <b>grab.</b> These two conditions {{are not the same as}} they may appear. For example, a client that would normally receive the keyboard events on a first window may request the keyboard <b>to</b> be <b>grabbed</b> by a second window. Events that would normally be sent to the first window may or may not be redirected <b>to</b> the <b>grab</b> window depending on the parameter in the grab request.|$|R

5|$|Exact {{details of}} her death {{eventually}} came to light; she boarded a packed boat with 70 other people {{in an attempt to}} cross the Mediterranean Sea and reach Italy. The boat soon ran out of petrol and was adrift off the coast of Libya. When an Italian Navy vessel arrived to offer assistance, it threw ropes over the side to the refugees.

5|$|Homer and Bart are {{watching}} television {{when they are}} interrupted by Lisa playing her saxophone in her bedroom. Bart enters Lisa's bedroom and tries <b>to</b> <b>grab</b> the saxophone from her, but he inadvertently tosses it out the window.

D. and Laura were both charged with murder, in Laura's case {{because she had been}} the first <b>to</b> <b>grab</b> the gun. Her husband, Austin, pleaded guilty to larceny and was sent to the {{relative}} safety of the state prison in McAlester. Laura and L.D. were held in the Okemah county jail, possibly along with Laura's baby, to await trial.|$|E
5|$|One male, or {{sometimes}} several, will pursue a female. When {{one of the}} males approaches the female, he uses his upper jaw <b>to</b> <b>grab</b> her dorsum. The male will then roll the female over by grabbing one of her pectoral fins, which are located {{on either side of}} her body. Once he is on her ventral side, the male puts a clasper into the female, connecting them venter to venter, with both undersides together. The mating process lasts for 30–90 seconds.|$|E
5|$|The Bulls {{began their}} next drive {{at their own}} 26-yard line, but went three-and-out. Buffalo punter Peter Fardon kicked the ball {{over the head of}} UConn {{returner}} Jasper Howard; rather than let the ball go, he ran backwards chasing after it. Trying <b>to</b> <b>grab</b> the ball over his shoulder, he muffed the catch, and the ball bounced into the end zone, where it was recovered by Buffalo's Ray Anthony Long for a Bull touchdown. The special-teams miscue by Howard allowed Buffalo to tie the game at 10–10 with 11:36 remaining in the second quarter.|$|E
50|$|Band brakes can be simple, compact, rugged, and can {{generate}} high force {{with a light}} input force. However, band brakes are prone <b>to</b> <b>grabbing</b> or chatter and loss of brake force when hot. These problems are inherent with the design and thus limit where band brakes are a good solution.|$|R
5000|$|When {{requesting}} a grab, a client specifies a grab window: all events are sent <b>to</b> the <b>grabbing</b> client {{as if they}} were relative <b>to</b> the <b>grab</b> window.

At a nightclub the protagonist dances and flirts with another club-goer, who then attacks her when she leaves the club.

5|$|Against Arkansas, Cody {{dominated}} Razorbacks center Jonathan Luigs—the 2007 Rimington Trophy winner—and {{helped the}} Crimson Tide to a 49–14 win. In a memorable {{play on a}} fourth-and-goal from the 1-yard line {{late in the first}} half, Cody blasted past Luigs and left guard Wade Grayson <b>to</b> <b>grab</b> running back Michael Smith before he could reach the end zone. In Alabama's rout over Georgia at Sanford Stadium, Cody was instrumental in holding Doak Walker award candidate Knowshon Moreno to just 34 yards rushing. In the seventh game of the season against Ole Miss, he received a knee injury during the third quarter which sidelined him for two weeks.|$|E
5|$|America's Most Wanted (Chris Harris and James Storm) {{challenged}} Team Canada (Bobby Roode and Eric Young), {{who were}} accompanied by Coach D'Amore, for the NWA World Tag Team Championship in the seventh match.

Later, Young went <b>to</b> <b>grab</b> a chair from Devine who had his back turned to the ring. This caused Devine to panic and hit Young in the head with the chair. Storm immediately followed by grabbing Young and pinning his shoulders to the mat with a school boy type pin attempt for the victory.|$|E

50|$|But {{his lack}} of {{consistency}} cost the team triumph. Once upon a time Felda almost created history to win their first ever FA cup but last minute Pahang managed <b>to</b> <b>grabbed</b> 2 cushioned goals.

Upon opening the time capsule, it is revealed that it is full of Willard's porn magazines that Ennis hid. Sue pitifully looks at Willard and tells him he is fired.|$|E
5|$|Because males emerge {{earlier than}} females, the males compete for mating territories {{surrounding}} the nests {{in which the}} females are located. During a fight, the males risk damaging their wings or appendages by butting and grappling. Another defense technique is <b>to</b> <b>grab</b> another male and carry it high into the air, which {{is thought to be}} a demonstration of strength. As a general rule, the larger the male the more predominant he is in battles. Age influences the success in the defense and security of territory; the younger the wasp the greater the chance of a successful takeover of territory. Some small males even engage in non-territorial mating tactics, and delay their emergence so as to have a fairer chance of survival.|$|E
5|$|Beside the weapons, each zduhać {{carried a}} milk bucket and a peck measure; an {{alternative}} {{for the latter}} could be a shovel or broom from a threshing floor. If a band of zduhaći succeeded to seize the peck measures from the enemy band, they would thereby transfer the crop yield from the area of their enemies to their own area. Seizing the milk buckets meant that the milk yield would be transferred. According to the clan of Kuči, zduhaći used their peck measures, milk buckets, and other containers <b>to</b> <b>grab</b> off the overall yield of the enemy territory.|$|E
5000|$|Chute dogging is a rodeo event {{related to}} steer wrestling, {{in which the}} steer used weighs between 400 and 500 lb. However, the {{competitor}} starts the event in a roping chute with the steer as opposed <b>to</b> <b>grabbing</b> onto the steer from horseback. The event is designed to give novices a chance to prepare for steer wrestling.|$|R

5|$|Clara {{volunteers to}} speak to Skaldak to try and calm him, {{relaying}} the Doctor's words to Skaldak, though {{he knows that the}} Doctor is listening. The Doctor informs Skaldak he was encased in the ice for 5000 years. Skaldak laments the loss of his daughter and his people; however, the Doctor tries to comfort him with the knowledge that the Ice Warriors still live, just not on Earth or Mars. Skaldak escapes from his armour - an act of great dishonour - and stops broadcasting the signal to the other Ice Warriors because he believes himself to be the only one of his kind left.
