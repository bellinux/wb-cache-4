40|$|O {{principal}} objetivo desta Dissertação de Mestrado é saber em trabalho inédito - em que medida o místico da Natureza, orador, poeta, ensaísta, e filósofo transcendentalista norteamericano Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803 - 82) pode ter influenciado o pragmaticista e semioticista norte-americano Charles Sanders Peirce (1839 - 1914) através de seu poema The Sphynx (1841; A Esfinge; com tradução inédita no Anexo 1), que teria motivado este a oferecer uma resposta ao enigma emersoniano no ensaio A Guess at the Riddle (1887 - 88; Uma Conjectura ao Enigma; tradução inédita no Anexo 2), algo que levou Peirce, mais tarde, nas palavras de Nathan Houser & Christian Kloesel, à construção de sua admirável arquitetônica (The Essential Peirce - Volume 1, 245) e sobre o qual o próprio Peirce escreveu: este livro, se alguma vez for escrito, como será se eu estiver na condição de fazê-lo, será um dos acontecimentos da época (The Essential Peirce - Volume 1, p. 245). Assim, na Parte I faremos uma análise do poema emersoniano em que exporemos suas Principais Idéias, aquelas presentes em seus próprios livros, ensaios e poemas - antes e depois da feitura do poema (1841) -, para que possamos conhecer seu desenvolvimento intelectual, no rico diálogo com as tradições filosóficas Ocidental. Médio-Oriental e Oriental (que muito o influenciaram) -, uma vez que a idéia-chave por detrás desta Dissertação está fundada no outro comentário de Peirce ao enigma d A Esfinge - os símbolos crescem no ensaio What Is A Sign? (1894; O Que É Um Signo?) até chegar à sua Epistemologia de Estados de Espírito, sua Ética Existencial de Auto- Melhoramento e sua Metafísica do Processo, de acordo com Stanley Cavell, que é responsável pelo renascimento dos estudos filosóficos emersonianos nos EUA nas últimas três décadas. Na Parte II faremos uma análise estrutural (Martial Guéroult) da resposta que Peirce forneceu ao enigma emersoniano com seu ensaio, Uma Conjectura ao Enigma (1887 - 88) The {{main objective}} of this <b>Master</b> <b>s</b> <b>Dissertation</b> is to know in an unprecedented work {{to what extent the}} mystic of Nature, orador, poet, essayist and Transcendentalist philosopher Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803 - 82) may have influenced Pragmaticist and Semiotician Charles Sanders Peirce (1839 - 1914) through his poem, The Sphynx (1841; translated for the first time into Portuguese in Annex 1), which stimulated the latter to offer an answer to the Emersonian enigma in the essay, A Guess at the Riddle (1887 - 88; translated for the first time into Portuguese in Annex 2), something that, later, according to Nathan Houser & Christian Kloesel, led to the construction of his admirable Architectonic (The Essential Peirce - Volume 1, 245), about which Peirce himself wrote: this book, if ever written, as it soon will be if I am in a situation to do it, {{will be one of the}} births of time (Ibid, ibidem). Therefore, in Part I we will analyze Emerson s poem and will highlight his Main Ideas, those present in his own books, essays and poems - before and after the making of the poem (1841) -, so we can know his intellectual development, in his rich dialog with the Western, Middle-Eastern and Eastern philosophies (that influenced him tremendously) -, once the key-idea behind this <b>Master</b> <b>s</b> <b>Dissertation</b> is grounded on Peirce s other comment on The Sphynx - symbols grow in the essay What Is A Sign?

There are differences in organizational contexts, such as multinationals, small and medium sized enterprises, start-ups and design agencies. Furthermore, different product categories and/or industries are suited to different approaches. What leads to a successful and sustainable innovation in one particular context need not necessarily work in the next.

Mediante pesquisa documental e bibliográfica, desenvolvida com base numa abordagem historiográfica decorrente das contribuições advindas da história {{cultural}} e por meio da análise da configuração textual, elaborou-se esta dissertação de mestrado que teve como corpus documental o manual Pedagogia: teoria e prática. Esse manual de ensino foi escrito por Antônio d Ávila e publicado em 1954 pela Companhia Editora Nacional, sua análise permitiu conhecer e compreender os saberes e práticas divulgados pelos professores na formação de novos quadros do magistério e compreender a concepção de Pedagogia nele presente e expressa por Antônio dþÁvila. Esse educador foi professor de várias disciplinas, inclusive de Pedagogia; autor de manuais de ensino; livros de leitura; tradutor; crítico pedagógico; escritor de colunas para jornais e revistas; conferencista; e membro de várias entidades profissionais e culturais. Os resultados da pesquisa permitem constatar que no manual analisado, encontra-se uma síntese dos saberes e práticas considerados essenciais para a formação do professor, especialmente o primário e julgados como necessários ao exercício eficiente e eficaz do magistério.

The research presents a study of Europeanisation of the Republic of Karelia through the programme of cross-border cooperation. External dimension of Europeanisation is studied {{in the context of}} a Russian region, the Republic of Karelia. Thus, Europeanisation is approached here as transfer of EU norms, values and practices to non-member countries. These principles of the EU are determined by analysis of documents on its policy towards neighbouring countries and present EU external governance. Activities of civil society organisations, mainly NGOs, within the programme contribute to cross-border cooperation. Cross-border cooperation and its programmes trigger activities and offer new opportunities for border regions, which to some extent contribute to Europeanisation through transfer of policy styles, norms and identities. It can partly be explained by the non-obligatory nature of policies within CBC in relation to civil society organisations in the border regions. Members of Russian NGOs involved into implementation of tourism projects were interviewed. Analysis of interviews contributed to gaining better understanding of potential adopting of European norms and practices through interaction and exchange of experience. In the research the necessity of the EU to europeanise neighbouring countries is explained as strengthening the EU position as a regional power and providing safety and stability near its border. In <b>the</b> <b>Master</b> <b>s</b> thesis I conclude that cross-border cooperation can be viewed as an instrument of Europeanisation but with the limitation of transfer of technological aspects of tourism development: logistics, managements rules, infrastructure, etc...|$|R
40|$|Dynamic {{calibration}} {{of pressure}} sensors is challenging. Often, steady-state calibration is applied on pressure sensors {{used to measure}} dynamical measurements. Steady-state calibration does not represent the dynamic behavior of a sensor. With dynamical calibration {{the quality of a}} dynamical measurement increases. This is the motivation for my <b>master</b> <b>s</b> thesis, written at the Waterpower Laboratory at NTNU in spring 2017. <b>The</b> <b>master</b> <b>s</b> thesis investigates methods for performing dynamic calibration. The best method {{is believed to be the}} use of an aperiodic pressure generator, because of its large range of frequencies and pressures, and in addition, the low cost and simple construction. The dynamic calibration method developed in this <b>master</b> <b>s</b> thesis is based on a step-response method with use of ultra-fast diaphragm valves with response time less than 5 ms. The target was to build a functional dynamic calibration system, and by use of the system, find the natural frequency of the calibrated sensor. By finding the natural frequency of the calibrated sensor, it is possible to find the uncertainty in dynamic measurements, and therefore increase the quality of the measurements. To generate a perfect working dynamic calibration system was proven to be difficult. The first problem arose when it was realized that the machining of the calibration system was not done according to the drawings. These inaccuracies resulted in air pockets in the system that was impossible to deflate, and as a consequence, signal noise was observed in the pressure step. The second problem was the behavior of the diaphragm valves. When the valve opened, the open-valve position was not fixed, and the diaphragm piston started to oscillate. This led to slow fluctuations prior to the final state after the step. The slow fluctuations worked as a low pass filter and delayed the entire system. This caused a slow rise time of the step generated. The closing position of the valves was fixed, and here the slow fluctuations did not occur, and the rise time improved. The calibration system does still not work in a perfect manner, but has a range of application. An almost suitable step was generated, and with use of Fast Fourier Transform it could be indicated that the highest natural frequency achieved by the system was 2246 Hz. By knowing this frequency and with use of a reference sensor it can be determined if a calibrated sensor does not need an extra uncertainty term. The dynamic calibration system developed could also be used to verify if a dynamic pressure sensor and amplifier behave in a correct manner. However, these methods need further investigation by experiments. Further work has also been an important part of this <b>master</b> <b>s</b> thesis...|$|R

40|$|The {{main subject}} of this <b>master</b> <b>s</b> thesis is ground {{resistance}} measurements on interconnected transmission towers. Statnett, which is the Norwegian transmission system operator, initiated the assignment {{as a result of}} experienced problems with the currently used method. The purpose of <b>the</b> <b>master</b> <b>s</b> thesis is to select an adequate method for measurement of ground resistance at interconnected transmission towers, by evaluation of different methods. In this thesis six methods are explained, and their qualities are investigated by simulations in CDEGS as well as practical research measurements. Based on this investigation it was possible to identify a method that met the complex requirements for ground resistance measurements on interconnected transmission towers, as well as Statnett s preferences regarding time-consumption. The most adequate method for Statnett to use is one particular variation of the Fall of Potential method. This method involves a correction factor to find the real resistance of the ground electrode. When performing measurements on counterpoise electrodes, the current electrode is located perpendicular to the transmission line, at a distance equal to the ground electrode s extension in the measuring direction. Similarly, for ring electrodes it is located at a distance of four times the ground electrode s extension. The potential electrode is located {{in the middle of the}} ground electrode and the current electrode for both counterpoise and ring electrodes. Simulations performed using this measuring method, with soil conditions representative for Norwegian tower sites, show that it has an accuracy of ± 22 %, which is acceptable. The method requires short test electrode distances. As a result of this it is less time-consuming and less sensitive to local variations in soil resistivity nearby the ground electrode, compared to the other methods. Other investigated methods also resulted in good accuracy when simulating the measurement methods. However, these methods are more time-consuming and more sensitive to soil conditions or the potential electrode s location. Some of the methods resulted in resistances that were substantially lower than the actual resistance of the ground electrode under test. An instruction for ground resistance measurements on interconnected transmission towers has been made. With the help of this, a work instruction will be written and the method will be implemented at Statnett during summer 2007. </p...|$|R

Quantization of a Lagrangian {{field system}} {{essentially}} {{depends on its}} degeneracy and implies its BRST extension defined by sets of non-trivial Noether and higher-stage Noether identities. However, one meets a problem how to select trivial and non-trivial higherstage Noether identities. We show that, under certain conditions, one can associate to a degenerate Lagrangian L the KT-BRST complex of fields, antifields and ghosts whose boundary and coboundary operators provide all non-trivial Noether identities and gauge symmetries of L. In this case, L can be extended to a proper solution of <b>the</b> <b>master</b> equation. 70 <b>S</b> 05, 70 S 20...|$|R

Sixty-eight level I and II participants from the Department of English Language and Literature at King Saud University in Riyadh take part in this study. They are divided into two major groups; reading and writing. Each group {{is divided into two}} groups; those who use computerized dictionary and those who use printed dictionary. Consequently, there are computerized dictionary reading group, printed dictionary reading group, computerized dictionary writing group and printed dictionary writing group. Participants attend six treatment sessions in which they are asked to either read or write about certain topics. Participants have the freedom to use the dictionary or not to guarantee the incidental design of the study. Two weeks later, a sudden post- test is given to all participants. The post tests are uniquely designed according to each participant s looked up words. Two-way ANOVA test is used to analyze the data collected. The findings of the study indicate that there is no significant effect of the type of the dictionary on the incidental vocabulary acquired [p=. 13 >. 005]. On the other hand, there is a significance effect of the skill (i. e. reading and writing) on the incidental vocabulary acquired [p=. 00 <. 005]. The participants in the writing groups benefited the most and acquired significant vocabulary. The results also reveal that those who use computerized dictionary during writing gain more vocabulary than the other groups...|$|R
40|$|To adapt home {{intervention}} {{processes to}} the needs of a child, a correct overview of skills that <b>the</b> child <b>masters</b> is necessary. <b>The</b> Portage Program, a home intervention program for families with children from 0 to 6 years of age with special educational needs, uses a checklist to assess the developmental skills that <b>the</b> child <b>masters</b> (<b>S.</b> M. Bluma, M. S. Shearer, A. H. Frohman, & J. M. Hilliard, 1976). Although a correct order of the items of the checklist is important for the planning of the home intervention process, the order of the items has never been empirically validated (B. F. Van der Meulen, W. G. Sipma, & C. E. J. Feenstra, 1993). This article describes a study on the scalability and item order of the revised checklist of the Dutch version of the Portage Program using Item Response Theory Modeling. The items of the checklist were administered to a sample of 736 families by using an incomplete data collection design. Results showed {{that it was possible to}} find a marginally or reasonably fitting scale for all areas of the checklist.

40|$|There is a {{consensus}} in the civil construction industry that the dispute level is very high, and have increased significantly over the past years. Claims are totaling {{hundreds of millions of}} kroner. This study looks at disputes in the Norwegian underground construction industry ending in the court system, and comprises disputes between public owners and the largest contractors in the country over the past ten years. The main objectives of <b>the</b> <b>master</b> <b>s</b> thesis are to collect information on disputes ending in the court system. Court documents are studied to identify the types of disputes most likely to end in court, and identify underlying factors for why these disputes remain unresolved through the projects. Additionally, the goal of the study s to propose mitigation measures {{to reduce the number of}} court cases. A literature review was performed to find former studies on the subject, and determining the industries standing and views on the problem. The main body of the study encompasses document studies and interviews. The aim from the document study is to collect information on court rulings, in order to determine litigation cause, duration and to perform a financial assessment. The interviews focus on identifying the underlying factors for these disputes. The results show that disputes ending in the court system originates from ambiguities and mistakes in tender and contract documents, and from disagreement over progress disturbances not solved during construction, ending in large and complicated claims in the final account. On average, these cases take between 1 to 2, 5 years to conclude. The thesis concludes that the underlying factors for these disputes are; the procurement strategy, optimistic bidding, inadequate scheduling work, communication problems, and personal issues. The recommended measures to reduce the number of litigation in the industry is to facilitate for earlier involvement of the contractors in large and complicated projects. Furthermore, it is recommended using conflict resolution concepts during construction, to solve disputes early...|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>Master</b> <b>s</b> thesis {{discusses}} {{verification of}} equipment transport on offshore platforms. The {{goal of the}} thesis {{is to use the}} form finding method dynamic relaxation to create a software application, which helps the layout engineers to automatically check whether an equipment transport route on offshore platforms is feasible using dynamic relaxation. This could potentially save {{a lot of time and}} add value by enabling the ability to run several iterations of the transport route with little effort. The thesis presents a new workflow, based on using the new application, and discusses advantages and disadvantages between the new and current workflow for transport route verification. By using Autodesk Navisworks and its. NET and COM API, a plug-in application was created for Navisworks, to automatically verify movement of an object through a given access way. This was done using Navisworks clash detective feature through the. NET API. The plug-in application required input parameter such as a validation object, a boundary geometry and a path. The plug-in application is divided into two phases; one path optimizing phase, and one verification phase. The optimizing phase is a pre-phase for the verification phase, to optimize run-time speed. The verification phase uses dynamic relaxation to try to move the validation object through the given path. If the validation object clashes with the boundary geometry, the dynamic relaxation will try to find a point of equilibrium where there is no clash. The plug-in application uses WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) as a presentation system in. NET, with the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture. The visualization of the validation object s movement, and the verification result, is done via Navisworks. NET API, where the movement is presented in Navisworks own UI. The plug-in application s UI will present information about the status of a verification. The UI gives the opportunity for the user to monitor the velocity, acceleration and applied force in the dynamic relaxation method during verification using chart controls...|$|R
