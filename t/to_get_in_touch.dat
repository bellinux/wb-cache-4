5|$|Lody's {{controllers}} realised {{that his}} mission {{was not going}} according to plan and attempted <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> with him to provide assistance. A letter dated 8 September was sent to Charles A. Inglis c/o Thomas Cook, Edinburgh, but he never collected it, and may never {{have been aware of}} it. Another German agent, Paul Daelen, was ordered to go to Britain and provide Lody with a new cover address. Daelen reached England too late. Lody had already travelled to Ireland without giving his controllers a means of contacting him.|$|E

5|$|According to Savenko, the Serbsky Center {{has long}} labored to legalize its monopolistic {{position}} of the Main expert institution of the country. The ambition and permissiveness—which, due to proximity to power, allow the Serbsky Center <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> over the telephone with the judges and explain to them who is who {{and what is the}} guideline, although the judges themselves have already learned it—have {{turned out to be a}} considerable drop in the level of the expert reports on many positions. Such a drop was inevitable and foreseeable in the context of the Serbsky Center efforts to eliminate adversary character of the expert reports of the parties, then to maximally degrade the role of the specialist as a reviewer and critic of the presented expert report, and to legalize the state of affairs. Lyubov Vinogradova believes there has been a continuous diminution in patients' rights as independent experts are now excluded from processes, cannot speak in court and can do nothing against the State experts.|$|E

5|$|C.J., however, {{seems more}} than {{reasonably}} distressed {{by the whole}} incident. She pays Hoynes a visit {{to give him a}} warning, and it becomes clear that {{she was one of the}} women with whom the Vice President had an affair. She makes it clear to him that, should he attempt smear tactics against any of these women, she will fight him on it, and he says he had no plans to include information about her in his book (when Hoynes' book is published in Season 6, a scene with C.J. confirms that he did not mention her in the book outside of her work as Press Secretary). C.J. later sadly relates to Toby how deeply she regretted sleeping with Hoynes. Distressed and in need of comfort, she decides to finally call her college boyfriend Ben, who has been trying <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> with her (and been ignored or shunted aside) for quite a while.|$|E
5|$|Oliphant {{took the}} {{initiative}} himself to enlighten the scientific community in the U.S. of the recent ground breaking discoveries the MAUD Committee had just exposed. Oliphant also travelled to Berkley to with meet with Ernest Lawrence, inventor of the cyclotron. After Oliphant informed Lawrence of his report on uranium, Lawrence met with NDRC chairman James Bryant Conant, George B. Pegram, and Arthur Compton to relay the details which Oliphant had directed to Lawrence. Oliphant was not only able <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> with Lawrence, but he met with Conant and Bush to inform them of the significant data the MAUD had discovered. Oliphant’s ability to inform the Americans led to Oliphant convincing Lawrence, Lawrence convincing Compton, and then Kistiakowsky convincing Conant {{to move forward with}} nuclear weapons. These actions from Oliphant resulted in Bush taking this report directly to the president.|$|E
25|$|After the {{outbreak}} of the Peninsular War, the British government desired <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> with the Division of the North to see whether its soldiers wished to fight against Napoleon. An authority consulted Francisco Javier Castaños, who assured him that the troops would do so. Since the British navy totally dominated the Baltic Sea it was feasible to pick up the Spaniards if only they could reach the coast. First, an agent had to brave Napoleon's secret police in order <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> with La Romana. Luckily, Sir Arthur Wellesley had suggested such a person to British Foreign Secretary George Canning before departing to command the army in Portugal that {{went on to win the}} Battle of Vimeiro in August 1808.|$|E
