The purpose of <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> the prevalence of a rotator cuff tear among a population. Yamamoto found that among the mountain village population, rotator cuff tears were present in 20.7% of the village population. In both of these studies we see that the percentages of the prevalence of a rotator cuff tear are very close in number so these numbers show us the prevalence of rotator cuff tears in the general population.|$|E

The goal of <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> whether particular cell activity in the putamen of primates was related to the direction of limb movement or to the underlying pattern of muscular activity. Two monkeys were trained to perform tasks that involved the movement of loads. The tasks were created so that movement could be distinguished from muscle activity. Neurons in the putamen were selected for monitoring only if they were related both to the task and to arm movements outside the task. It was shown that 50% of the neurons that were monitored were related to the direction of movement, independent of the load.|$|E

The purpose of <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> {{the safety and}} effectiveness of injecting bone marrow stem cells into heart muscle {{in an attempt to}} promote blood vessel growth that could potentially improve the blood supply in hearts that are failing. This study recruited patients who had heart failure, but would no longer benefit from other forms of standard treatment such as surgery or coronary artery repair procedures such as balloon angioplasty or stent placement. The results of this study were presented at the American College of Cardiology (ACC) Annual Meeting in 2012 and simultaneously published in JAMA.|$|E
50|$|One {{particular}} {{study used}} patients with focal lesions on the basal ganglia (specifically the putamen) due to stroke {{in order to}} study category learning. The advantage to using these types of patients is that dopaminergic projections to the prefrontal cortex {{are more likely to}} be intact. Also, in these patients, it is easier to relate specific brain structures to function because the lesion only occurs in a specific place. The goal of <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> whether or not these lesions affect rule-based and information-integration task learning. Rule-based tasks are learned via hypothesis-testing dependent on working memory. Information-integration tasks are ones wherein the accuracy is maximized when information from two sources are integrated at a pre-decisional stage, which follows a procedural-based system.|$|E

[...] One of the principal aims of <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> the optimal command arrangements for ADF air power. The final report, commonly referred to as the Baker Report, was published in March 1988. Despite extensive reference being made to the command and control challenges posed by air power, Baker did not provide definitive guidance on how the ADF should structure its command arrangements to optimise the development and employment of air power. However, Chapter 7 of the report strongly advocated the creation of NORCOM, a recommendation that was soon adopted by the ADF.|$|E
