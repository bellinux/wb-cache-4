25|$|The {{gestation}} {{period of the}} Malayan tapir is about 390–395 days, after which a single offspring, weighing around 15 pounds (6.8kg), is born. Malayan tapirs are {{the largest of the}} five tapir species at birth and grow more quickly than their congeners. Young tapirs of all species have brown hair with white stripes and spots, a pattern that enables them to hide effectively in the dappled light of the forest. <b>This</b> <b>baby</b> coat fades into adult coloration between four and seven months after birth. Weaning occurs between six and eight months of age, at which time the babies are nearly full-grown, and the animals reach sexual maturity around age three. Breeding typically occurs in April, May or June, and females generally produce one calf every two years. Malayan tapirs can live up to 30 years, both in the wild and in captivity.|$|E
