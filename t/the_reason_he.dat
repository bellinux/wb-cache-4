5|$|After Brian reveals Meg's {{secret to}} Peter and Lois, who don't want her seeing Luke again, he soon breaks {{out of jail}} during a prison riot and tries {{to hide in the}} Griffins' house. When Brian comes to Meg's room to {{apologize}} for what he did to her, he finds him just as Peter enters. Peter only knows what is happening when reading the episode's plot synopsis in TV Guide (<b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>he</b> entered the rodeo), and finds out who Luke is. As Luke escapes out the window, Peter alerts Joe, who apprehends Luke. Joe also arrests Meg for harboring a fugitive, and she is sent to prison. Luke is never heard from again in the episode.|$|E
5|$|Arrested and exposed, Sideshow Bob confesses that {{he hated}} Krusty and <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>he</b> framed Krusty {{was because he}} spent years {{constantly}} being {{on the receiving end}} of the clown's humiliating gags.

Homer then apologizes to Krusty for fingering him in court, and Krusty thanks Bart for standing up for the truth and sticking to his convictions, and a picture is taken of the two shaking hands (which Bart later hangs in his bedroom, refilled with Krusty decor).|$|E

Rahim Khan further reveals that Ali, being sterile, was not Hassan's biological father. Hassan was actually Baba's son and Amir's half-brother. Finally, he tells Amir that <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>he</b> called Amir to Pakistan was to rescue Sohrab, Hassan's son, from an orphanage in Kabul.|$|E
5|$|Once half-time was reached, it {{was clear}} that Scotland, and Jim Leighton in particular, were in difficulty. In the {{dressing}} room, Leighton admitted that <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>he</b> had missed the cross {{at the end of the}} first half, which led to the last-ditch save at the feet of Mark Hughes, was that he was shortsighted and had lost one of his contact lenses. Not only that, but he did not have a spare pair with him. Leighton had not been forthcoming about his eyesight because of fears that it might harm his career. As a consequence, that the goalkeeper even needed lenses was something that his team mates, Alex Ferguson (who was also Leighton's club manager at Aberdeen) or, most importantly, Jock Stein did not know.|$|E
5|$|After Floyd Mayweather, Jr. {{defeated}} Zab Judah on April 8, 2006, {{he rejected}} an $8million offer from promoter Bob Arum to fight Margarito on August 12, 2006, citing a hand injury as <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>he</b> {{did not take}} the bout. On December 2, 2006, Margarito successfully defended the WBO welterweight title for the seventh time with a unanimous decision victory over Joshua Clottey. On July 14, 2007, Margarito fought Paul Williams in his eighth title defense at the Home Depot Center in Carson, California. With a victory, Margarito would set up himself up for a welterweight title unification match against Miguel Cotto in the autumn, but Margarito lost to Williams by unanimous decision. Four months later, Margarito knocked out Golden Johnson in the first round at Madison Square Garden in New York City. On April 12, 2008, Margarito had a rematch with Kermit Cintron, who held the IBF welterweight title. The match took place on the undercard of Cotto's fight with Alfonso Gomez and Margarito knocked out Cintron in the sixth round to win the title.|$|E

5|$|As a {{response}} to the cancellation, fans created online petitions, called Netflix, and tweeted #RenewSense8 and other hashtags, in an attempt to bring back the show. On June 8, 2017, the show's social media accounts acknowledged the fans' efforts, and wrote that Netflix looked into the renewal of Sense8 a second time, however they concluded it wasn't possible. Smith released a letter to the fans reiterating the reason for the cancellation was low viewership, and explaining that <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>he</b> rallied them to voice their support before the show was officially cancelled, was that once that happens, there is no going back. He praised Netflix for their support while making the show, and thanked the fans for putting up a great fight to keep it alive. On June 10, 2017, Chief Content Officer of Netflix Ted Sarandos during his talk on Produced By Conference, explicitly commented the show was cancelled because its audience, despite being very passionate, wasn't large enough to support the high production costs to travel and film around the globe.|$|E
5|$|By then, {{there was}} already a {{movement}} within the Army General Staff to have Matsui removed from his post. Reports of the atrocities in Nanking had reached the Japanese government and some within the Army General Staff blamed Matsui for mishandling the crisis and causing Japan international embarrassment. Some even wanted him court-martialed for negligence. Even so, the Japanese government was not planning on dismissing Matsui solely because of the Nanking Massacre. The Foreign Ministry was displeased by anti-Western statements Matsui had made after becoming CCAA commander, including his comment {{that he did not}} recognize the neutrality of foreign concessions in Shanghai, and the Army General Staff was concerned about Matsui's severe personality conflicts with his subordinate commanders, which were interfering with the chain of command. The Army Minister Hajime Sugiyama told General Shunroku Hata that the inability of Matsui and his subordinates to coordinate and cooperate with one another was <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>he</b> was being removed.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, he {{returned}} to his alma mater, and became the head coach in 1984 after the retirement of Henry Ciccarone. That year, he led the Blue Jays to a perfect 14–0 season and became the first head coach to win an NCAA championship in his first season. In 1985, Hopkins again won the national title while suffering one loss. The following year, the Blue Jays compiled a 10–2 record, and were eliminated in the semifinals in overtime by the eventual national champions, North Carolina. In 1987, Zimmerman led the team to a 10–3 record and a third title. Upon expiration of his contract, he left Hopkins after compiling a 6–5 record in 1990. <b>The</b> <b>reason</b> <b>he</b> cited was the pressure associated with the high-profile position. In total, Zimmerman's teams at Johns Hopkins posted a 73–15 record.|$|E

5|$|In Røyken {{municipal}} council, {{three of}} five representatives left the party, and a fourth, former MP Steinar Maribo, considered doing the same. As did Odd Magnar Brubæk, and former deputy MP Paal Bjørnestad. Terje Nyberget {{withdrew from the}} central committee in early May. The leader in the chapters in Finnmark and Nordkapp, Bjørn Magne Solvik, withdrew on 13 May. He cited a lack of liberalism, especially with regards to gay rights and immigration, as <b>the</b> <b>reason.</b> <b>He</b> was the only Progress Party member of a municipal council in Finnmark. Maribo withdrew some time in May. In late May, party secretary Hans Andreas Limi had counted 270 withdrawals, but also 76 new members. Municipal and county council member Liv Skrede left after the youth wing's national convention in July, so did Tor Mikkel Wara, Ellen Wibe, Jan Erik Fåne and Petter Bjørheim. Hordaland county council member Lene C. Møgster Løtvedt left and joined the Conservative Party in October.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Grace and Jack are {{discussing}} their own problems. Grace uses Jack's promiscuous history with married men {{as a legitimate}} reason to have {{an affair with a}} married man, but Jack tells her to forget about it as both of them are the moral role models to their friends. After being honest with her, Jack confesses that <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>he</b> is wearing an eye patch is not because he got glitter in his eye, as he told his friends. When he refused to stop his singing performance during the debut of his new talk show, Jack Talk, even though the entire set had accidentally been set on fire, his eyebrow was burnt off. Later, Will, Grace, and Jack all decide that it would be for the best to let Karen know the truth about Stan. Will breaks the news to her, but Karen believes he is joking. Rosario tells Karen that Stan is not dead, as she has been giving him reports on Karen. At the admission, Karen fires Rosario and leaves Will's apartment with Malcolm, explaining that Stan may be alive, but that he is still dead to her.|$|E
5|$|Nonant was a great-nephew of John, Bishop of Lisieux, who {{had been}} the chief deputy in Normandy of King Henry I of England, and he was also a nephew of Arnulf of Lisieux, another bishop of Lisieux. Nonant had a brother Sylvester, who was {{treasurer}} of Lisieux. Hugh Nonant was a canon in his uncle Arnulf's cathedral chapter before serving as an archdeacon of the diocese of Lisieux from 1167 until 1184. Nonant served in the household of Thomas Becket while Becket was Archbishop of Canterbury, and went into exile with Becket, although he left Becket's service while the archbishop was in exile. While in Becket's service, Nonant may have authored a letter dated to 1165 that is attributed to Becket. Nonant had been reconciled to King Henry II of England by 1170. Along with Richard Barre, Nonant was named in January 1184 as a papal judge-delegate in a case between two Norman monasteries. In 1184, Nonant was sent by the king to the papal curia to petition Pope Lucius III on behalf of Henry the Lion, Duke of Saxony and Henry II's son-in-law. Nonant's success on this mission probably was <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>he</b> was elevated to the episcopate in 1185.|$|E

5|$|Several {{days later}} Herb Caen, a {{columnist}} at The San Francisco Chronicle, exposed Sipple as gay {{and a friend}} of Milk's. The announcement was picked up by national newspapers, and Milk's name was included in many of the stories. Time magazine named Milk as a leader in San Francisco's gay community. Sipple, however, was besieged by reporters, as was his family. His mother, a staunch Baptist in Detroit, now refused to speak to him. Although he had been involved with the gay community for years, even participating in Gay Pride events, Sipple sued the Chronicle for invasion of privacy. President Ford sent Sipple a note of thanks for saving his life. Milk said that Sipple's sexual orientation was <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>he</b> received only a note, rather than an invitation to the White House.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{before a}} TNA show on February 25, 2004, Punk had a {{physical}} scuffle with Teddy Hart {{outside of a}} restaurant that was broken up by Sabu. The scuffle reportedly stemmed from an ROH show in which Hart performed three unplanned spots putting several other wrestlers in danger of injury. Around {{the time of the}} scuffle, Punk and Dinero stopped appearing on TNA shows, leading to speculation he was fired for the incident. Punk, however, said the scuffle had no bearing on his TNA career. He said <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>he</b> and Dinero stopped appearing on TNA pay-per-views was that TNA officials believed that he and Dinero had not connected with the fans as villains, having turned against the popular Raven and instead formed a villainous tag team managed by James Mitchell. The officials decided that since the team was not working as villains, the storyline would be put on hold indefinitely, and thus had no work for Punk or Dinero. Punk officially quit TNA in March 2004 during the Rob Feinstein controversy, after having a dispute with the TNA offices over his ability to compete in ROH following a TNA order that their contracted wrestlers were to no longer wrestle in ROH.|$|E
5|$|The Ways of Fate is a 1913 American silent short romance film {{produced}} by the American Film Manufacturing Company. The film's directorial and producer roles have been both attributed to Allan Dwan, but other sources point to Wallace Reid as director. The film's fictional plot is centered on Jim Conway, who grew up wanting to avenge his father's death and headed West to seek his father's killer. Lost in the mountains, he is saved by a young woman and the two fall in love. After a few weeks with her, Conway reveals <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>he</b> came west and the young woman's father overhears it. The old man confesses to killing Conway's father, over a game of cards, and bares his chest. Conway refuses to take revenge, because love had diminished such feelings. The film was released on April 19, 1913 {{and it had a}} widespread national release. It is not known whether the film currently survives, but it is presumed lost.|$|E
