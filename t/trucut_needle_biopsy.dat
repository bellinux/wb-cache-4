40|$|In a {{prospective}} evaluation of percutaneous <b>Trucut</b> <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> for localised intrathoracic lesions in 89 patients histological specimens were obtained in 81. Malignancy was diagnosed in 66 cases. Subsequently definitive histological reports {{were available in}} 18 of these patients with complete concordance of malignant cell type. Sixteen patients had non-malignant histological appearances, which were later confirmed objectively in six. In three patients there was no follow up information, but in the remainder the clinical course was entirely consistent with the histological appearances of the biopsy specimens. Adequate specimens were obtained from {{only two of the}} five lesions less than 2 cm in diameter. Lesions deeper than 8 cm from the site of biopsy were associated with significantly more haemorrhagic complications than more superficial lesions. Comparison with other series indicates that <b>Trucut</b> <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> which produces histological specimens has greater diagnostic accuracy than cytological techniques for both malignant and non-malignant localised lesions. It is concluded that this technique has a definite place in the investigation of this common problem in carefully selected patients provided that strict attention is paid to the details of the technique...|$|E
40|$|Context Malignant mixed Mullerian {{tumors are}} rare ovarian {{neoplasms}} {{that account for}} less than 2 % of ovarian malignancies. They have a generally poor prognosis and often develop recurrent disease. To our knowledge, {{this is the first}} report of a malignant mixed Mullerian tumor with metastasis to the pancreas. The metastatic tumor was identified by endoscopic ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) and <b>Trucut</b> <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> of the pancreas. Case report We describe a 69 -year-old female with concomitant Duke’s C adenocarcinoma of the colon and stage III-C malignant mixed Mullerian tumor that presented with malignant ascites, increasing abdominal girth and a pancreatic head mass. EUS revealed an 11 cm cystic mass in the head of the pancreas that was characterized as a carcinosarcoma/malignant mesodermal mixed tumor by EUS-FNA and <b>Trucut</b> <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy.</b> The tumor was morphologically identical to the surgical specimen of her ovarian mass. The patient was treated with palliative chemotherapy and a three-month follow up CT scan did not reveal any new metastatic lesions. Conclusion The pancreas is a rare site of metastasis and more commonly seen in renal cell carcinoma, melanoma or lung tumors; amongst others. Although ovarian adenocarcinoma has been reported as a primary site of pancreatic metastasis, it has not been previously described originating from a mixed Mullerian tumor of the ovary presenting as a cystic pancreatic head mass...|$|E
40|$|THE {{clinical}} {{differentiation between}} benign and malignant breast lumps {{is fraught with}} danger. A small proportion of cases present with classical clinical findings but {{in the majority of}} cases it is essential to have a cytological or histological diagnosis before surgery is undertaken. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) of solid tumours has been practised since 1930, 1 and has been used throughout the world. Its usefullness remains controversial, opinions ranging from total rejection to enthusiastic acceptance. In order to evaluate the technique we carried out 135 consecutive FNA and the results of this series are now presented. MATERIALS AND METHODS One hundred and thirty two women attending with breast lumps were subjected to FNA. Some had simultaneous <b>Trucut</b> <b>needle</b> <b>biopsies</b> (TCN) carried out and some went on to have excision biopsy or mastectomy. It was found that lumps smaller than 0. 5 cm in diameter were unsuitable for aspiration due to difficulty in accurately locating the lump with the aspirating needle...|$|R
40|$|Background: In {{recent years}} {{attention}} {{has focused on}} malignant prostatic lesions due to the perceived high incidence of prostatic carcinoma in different geographical areas worldwide. Unfortunately, African American race/ethnicity {{is one of the}} three primary non-modifiable risk factors confirmed for prostate cancer. Objective: To analyze the pattern of distribution of prostate cancer among men in Zaria, Northern Nigeria. Patients and methods: This is a 10 -year retrospective histopathological analysis of all prostate cancer cases diagnosed between January 1991 and December 2000 in the Department of Pathology, Ahmadu Bello University Teaching Hospital (A. B. U. T. H), Zaria, Nigeria. Haematoxylin & Eosin (H&E) stained histology slides were retrieved and studied. The patients’ bio-data were retrieved from the patient case files and departmental records. After histological assessment, the tumours were classified according to WHO recommendation. Histological grading and staging of adenocarcinoma was done using the Gleason Score. Results: Between January 1991 and December 2000, a total of 151 cases of prostate cancer were seen, constituting 4. 1 % of all malignancies and 10. 1 % of male malignancies seen during this period. The diagnosis was based on histopathological analysis of specimens obtained from <b>Trucut</b> <b>needle</b> <b>biopsies</b> and open prostatectomies.

40|$|Percutaneous {{lung biopsy}} had been {{described}} {{in the nineteenth century}} by Leyden, but image- guided <b>needle</b> chest <b>biopsy</b> only gained widespread acceptance in the 1970 s. Currently, tissue sampling of a thoracic lesion is indicated when the diagnosis cannot be obtained by the non-invasive techniques and cytological diagnosis will modify the stage of the disease or influence the therapeutic strategy. Cytology obtained by small-gauge <b>needle</b> aspiration <b>biopsy</b> confirms the nature of the lesion in 80 – 95 % of cases and carry a low incidence of major complications. The purpose of this report was to provide information on our first experience with CT-guided biopsy and show that with some innovativeness much can be achieve with limited resources and good team work. We performed a CT of the thorax using appropriately placed improvised metal markers, which determined the optimal cutaneous entry point. We then re-checked the location of the lesion scanning intermittently at 5 mm slice thickness; we marked the entry point with a pen and cleaned the surface with methylated spirit. A local anaesthetic was subcutaneously injected around marked area. We used a 21 G aspiration needle to obtain cytology sample then 18 G <b>Trucut</b> <b>biopsy</b> <b>needle</b> to obtain histology specimen. The length of the needle was chosen based on predetermined distance of the target lesion from the skin estimated from the CT images. Our patient was a 51 -year-old Nigerian female with a peripherally located nodule in the posterior aspect of the right lung. She had CT-guided biopsy of the nodule. The procedure was well tolerated with no complication of pneumothorax. The histology report provided the basis for treatment regimen.

40|$|A {{percutaneous}} <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> {{was performed}} with a <b>TruCut</b> <b>needle</b> on 41 patients with suspected pneumoconiosis. Patients selected for biopsy {{tended to have}} brief or unusual dust exposure, as well as questionable radiographic opacities. Sixteen {{had been exposed to}} asbestos, 13 to silica and 12 to mixed dust containing quartz, coal, iron, asbestos and talc. All patients in the asbestos group and most in the other two groups had a reduced transfer factor. Most patients in the asbestos group and about 25 % of the other patients had restrictive ventilatory impairment. Chest radiographs were assessed according to standard films of the ILO U/C International Classification (International Labour Office, 1972). In 25 patients radiographic opacities were absent or acanty (categories 0 [...] 1 / 1). The dominant radiographic feature of many patients exposed to asbestos was a ground-glass appearance or a bilateral elevation of the diaphragm, or both, features difficult to assess according to the ILO U/C scheme. Most histological changes were those usually seen in pneumoconiosis. However, in only two patients with silicosis were silicotic nodules detected. The specimens of seven patients showed a granulomatous inflammation. The severity of alveolar wall involvement correlated well with the transfer factor value but poorly with radiographic changes. The profusion of radiographic opacities also correlated poorly with functional impairment. As a diagnostic tool the <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> was valuable in asbestosis and slightly less so in mixed-dust fibrosis. The biopsy specimens showed changes compatible with asbestosis in 75 % of the suspected cases and in 86 % of those in which asbestosis was the final diagnosis. In the mixed-dust group pneumoconiosis was confirmed in 67 % and 80 %, respectively. In the diagnosis of silicosis an open biopsy is probably more reliable than a percutaneous one, particularly if radiographic changes are minimal. Histological changes in the <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> specimen were compatible with silicosis in only 36 % of the suspected cases and in 63 % of those in which the final diagnosis was silicosis...|$|R

We sought to study the use of <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> and open surgical biopsy in women with breast cancer, predictors of <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> use, and the effect of biopsy choice on overall number of surgical procedures needed to treat breast cancer. METHODS: We analyzed Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) -Medicare data for 45, 542 women diagnosed between 1991 and 1999 with ductal carcinoma in situ and stage I-II breast cancer. By using diagnosis and procedure codes from 3 months before to 6 months after the SEER diagnosis, we classified the initial <b>biopsy</b> as <b>needle</b> or surgical. By using multivariate logistic regression, we identified patient and tumor characteristics associ-ated with <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> use, and estimated the association between initial biopsy type and likelihood for multiple breast surgeries. RESULTS: <b>Needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> was the initial procedure for 11, 073 (24. 3 %) women.

In this prospective study, {{the impact of the}} introduction of this technique on diagnosis and surgical treatment of nonpalpable breast cancer was assessed in two hospitals in The Netherlands. A total of 84 patients with nonpalpable breast cancer, diagnosed by means of stereotactic large-core <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> (<b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> group) were compared with 80 patients diagnosed with nonpalpable breast cancer before the introduction of large-core <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy.</b> These patients were diagnosed by means of needle-localized open breast biopsy (control group). Clinical outcome measures evaluated included: duration of diagnostic and therapeutic intervals and number of surgical procedures required for complete surgical treatment. Subgroup analysis was performed for the category of microcalcifications without tissue distortion. For the <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> group, the median interval between initial referral to the surgeon and the availability of histological diagnosis was 9 days and the interval between initial referral and complete surgical treatment was 31 days. These intervals were significantly longer for the control group (19 days and 44 days respectively); 75 % of patients in the <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> group were treated in a single step surgical procedure compared to 16 % of the patients in the control group (67 vs 25 % respectively for the subgroup). The mean number of surgical procedures required to complete surgical treatment was 1. 31 for <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> group vs 1. 91 for the open biopsy group (1. 46 vs 1. 84 for the subgroup). Introduction of stereotactic large-core <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> leads to a reduction of the time to diagnosis and the time to complete surgical treatment of nonpalpable breast cancer.

40|$|Background: One of {{the alleged}} {{advantages}} of stereotactic large-core <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> of non-palpable breast lesions is that it entails less inconvenience for the patient. In this prospective study, {{the quality of life}} of patients undergoing large-core <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> was compared with that of patients undergoing open breast biopsy prior to learning the definitive diagnosis. Methods: Thirty patients with non-palpable breast lesions underwent stereotactic large-core <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> as initial diagnostic procedure (<b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> group). Quality of life as perceived by these patients was compared with that of 27 patients who underwent open breast biopsy as initial diagnostic procedure (control group), Both groups completed quality of life questionnaires (EuroQol and SF- 36) 1 day before and 4 days after the diagnostic intervention. Results: One day before the diagnostic procedure, the overall estimate for quality of life (measured with the EuroQol) was slightly higher in the <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> group than in the control group (73 versus 69 resp.). Four days after the diagnostic procedure, the quality of life score remained approximately unchanged in the <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> group, but was reduced in the control group (71 versus 61 resp.). Results of the SF- 36 questionnaire demonstrated that patients in the <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> group had higher quality of life scores on physical functioning, physical performance, pain and social performance after the diagnostic intervention. Conclusion: Stereotactic large-core <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> seems to affect quality of life to a lesser extent than open breast biopsy. This difference is mainly attributable to a reduction of physical discomfort and pain. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Objective: Gleason scores, as {{determined}} by 18 -gauge core <b>needle</b> <b>biopsies</b> (NB), were compared with both Gleason scores and the pathological staging of corresponding radical prostatectomy (RP) specimens. The goal was to evaluate the clinical implication and the prognostic impact of these discrepancies. Methods: Records of 234 consecutive patients undergoing a radical retro pubic prostatectomy between 2001 and 2012 were reviewed. In total, all our patients were enrolled, al 1 {{of whom had been}} diagnosed with adenocarcinoma by transrectal <b>needle</b> <b>biopsies</b> using an 18 -gauge automated spring-loaded biopsy gun. Results: Grading errors were greatest with wel 1 -differentiated tumors. The accuracy was 18 (23 %) for Gleason scores of 2 - 4 on <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy.</b> Of the 108 evaluable patients with Gleason scores of 5 - 7 on <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy,</b> 84 (78 %) were graded correctly. All of the Gleason scores of 8 - 10 on <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> were graded correctly. 54 of 162 patients (33 %), with a biopsy Gleason score of < 7 had their cancer upgraded to above 7. Tumors in 18 patients (60 %) with both a Gleason score < 7 on the <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> and a Gleason score of 7 for the prostatectomy specimen were confined to the prostate. Conclusion: The potential for grading errors is greatest with well-differentiated tumors and in patients with a Gleason score of < 7 on the <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy.</b> Predictions using Gleason scores are sufficiently accurate to warrant its use with all <b>needle</b> <b>biopsies,</b> recognizing that the potential for grading errors is greatest with well-differentiated tumors...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare {{accuracy}} of an image guided percutaneous core <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> (PCNB), using ultrasound or computed tomography, to PCNB without image guidance in the diagnosis of palpable soft tissue tumours.

40|$|AbstractAim: To {{determine}} {{the contribution of}} percutaneous biopsy with core cutting <b>needle</b> (<b>Trucut)</b> in the diagnosis of mediastinal tumours. Method: Retrospective review of 56 patients with mediastinal lesions who underwent percutaneous core cutting <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy,</b> oriented but not guided by computer assisted tomography of the thorax, 1999 – 2008. Results: Percutaneous biopsy with core cutting needle provided adequate material in 49 / 56, with a total positive sample rate of 88 %. In 7 / 56 (12 %) cases the material was insufficient to define the diagnosis. Percutaneous core cutting <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> established a specific histological diagnosis in 88 % of the patients: 23 / 56 (41 %) lymphomas; 12 / 56 (21 %) thymomas; 5 / 56 (3 %) thymic carcinomas; 3 / 56 (2 %) small cell carcinoma and 1 / 56 (0. 6 %) metastatic adenocarcinoma, metastatic squamous cell carcinoma, neuroendocrine primitive carcinoma, plasmocytoma, teratoma and goiter. All patients underwent thoracic X-ray after the procedure. No complications were found in these patients. Conclusion: Percutaneous core cutting <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> (<b>Trucut)</b> oriented but not guided by computer assisted tomography of the thorax is an easy and safe procedure which can provide a precise diagnosis {{in the majority of}} mediastinal tumours and can prevent the need for exploratory thoracic surgery in cases which are medically treatable or non-resectable.

The sample was considered adequate when a diagnosis can be made, and diagnostic when the diagnosis {{is similar to the}} final report based on the excised tumour. RESULTS: Adequacy of the biopsy samples was 84...|$|R
40|$|For the {{evaluation}} of non-palpable lesions of the breast, image-guided large-core <b>needle</b> <b>biopsies</b> are increasingly replacing needle-localized open breast biopsies. In this study, the diagnostic accuracy of this minimally invasive technique was evaluated by reviewing the available literature. Five cohort studies were included in a meta-analysis. Sensitivity rate, histological agreement between <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> and subsequent surgery or long-term mammographic follow-up and clinical consequences for different disease prevalences were assessed. The sensitivity rate of large-core <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> for the diagnosis of breast cancer was high (97 %). The reclassified agreement rate between core biopsy and subsequent surgical biopsy or long-term mammographic follow-up was also high (94 %). In case of 20 % breast cancer prevalence among women referred after screening (as in the US), {{the risk of breast}} cancer despite benign large-core <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> result is less than 1 %. In European countries, however, prevalence of breast cancer among referred women is 60 – 70 %. This would result in a risk of breast cancer despite benign large-core <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> result of 4 – 6 %. The results of this meta-analysis indicate that the image guided large-core <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> is a promising alternative for the <b>needle</b> localized breast <b>biopsy.</b> However, additional research is needed to explore the limiting factors of the technique. Without such detailed knowledge, a benign histological diagnosis on large-core <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> in countries with high prevalence of malignancy among referred women should be interpreted with caution. © 2000 Cancer Research Campaig...|$|R

Each specimen was immediately snap frozen (less than 5  s) in liquid nitrogen and stored at - 80 °C until processing for amino acid extraction and quantification.|$|R
40|$|Background: Breast {{cancer is}} the most common {{malignant}} neoplasm and {{the most common cause of}} death among women. The core <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> is becoming a universal practice in diagnosing breast lesions suspected of malignancy. Unfortunately, breast core <b>needle</b> <b>biopsies</b> also bear the risk of having false-negative results.

40|$|A {{percutaneous}} transthoracic <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> is {{a common}} procedure {{in the practice of}} pulmonology. An air embolism is a rare but potentially fatal complication of a percutaneous transthoracic <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy.</b> We report four cases of a cerebral air embolism that developed after a percutaneous transthoracic <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy.</b> Early diagnosis and the rapid application of hyperbaric oxygen therapy is the mainstay of therapy for an embolism. Prevention is the best course and it is essential that possible risk factors be avoided...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Prostate <b>Needle</b> <b>biopsies</b> are {{stained with}} the PIN- 4 marker {{cocktail}} {{to help the}} pathologist distinguish between HGPIN and adeno-carcinoma. The correct interpretation of multiple IHC markers can be challenging. Therefore we propose the use of computer aided diagnosis algorithms for the identification and classification of glands in a whole slide image of prostate <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy.</b> The paper presents the different {{issues related to the}} automated analysis of prostate <b>needle</b> <b>biopsies</b> and the approach taken by BioImagene in its first generation algorithms...|$|R
40|$|Core <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> {{represents}} {{a safe and}} cheap alternative diagnostic method to open biopsy and fine-needle aspiration cytology in head and neck tumors. There is little evidence in the literature {{about the use of}} core <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> in minor salivary gland lesions. This single case report presents a 60 -year-old woman with a painless swelling in the soft palate, breathing and swallowing difficulties, and a feeling of suffocation. Two open biopsies had inconclusive diagnosis and the lesion could only be assessed and diagnosed as pleomorphic adenoma through core <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy.</b> Recognizing the correct indication of core <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> can benefit both health professionals and patients; thus, {{it is important to consider}} the possibility of performing this method to diagnose minor salivary gland tumors...|$|R
30|$|We {{conducted}} a retrospective cross-sectional study of cases with an isolated RS diagnosis based on <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> and subsequent surgical pathology among all patients between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2013. Patients with concomitant atypia, lobular {{carcinoma in situ}} on core biopsy, complete excision of very small RS with <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy,</b> and radiology-pathology discordance were excluded. An upgrade from the <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> of RS was defined as surgical excision pathology that revealed ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), and/or invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC).|$|R

40|$|Background: Discordance {{between the}} Gleason scores of {{prostate}} <b>needle</b> <b>biopsies</b> and radical prostatectomy specimens {{has been reported}} by several investigators. We conducted this study to determine if {{increasing the number of}} prostate <b>needle</b> <b>biopsies</b> in patients with prostate cancer improves the accuracy of Gleason scores in the Taiwanese population. Methods: Between March 2000 and September 2009, 281 patients underwent radical prostatectomy at Taipei Veterans General Hospital. All of these patients had prostate cancer that was diagnosed and graded either by extended <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> (121 patients, ≥ 10 cores/patient, range: 10 – 13, median: 12) or by traditional sextant transrectal biopsy (160 patients, 7 after radical prostatectomy. Conclusion: The addition of an extended transrectal <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> increases the accuracy of the Gleason score for predicting the final prostate cancer grade in the Taiwanese population...|$|R
