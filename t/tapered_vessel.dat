40|$|Abstract. In-stent {{restenosis}} {{still remains}} an obsession to cardiologist, especially in tapered vessels. In this paper, we designed a novel balloon-expandable stent for <b>tapered</b> <b>vessel</b> and proposed a {{finite element method}} (FEM) to study {{the expansion of the}} novel stent. The effect of stent design parameters on stent tapering and foreshortening were also researched. Results show that the radial displacement of stent proximal end was always larger than that of stent distal end during stent expansion, and the stent had a tapered shape as a whole after expansion. The degree of stent tapering observed increased with the expansion pressure increase. Besides, increasing the gradient of ring amplitude not only could increase the tapering degree of stent after expansion, but also could decrease stent foreshortening, improving the positioning accuracy after stent implantation. In conclusion, FEM can quantify expansion performance of novel balloon-expandable stents and help designers to devise and assess new stent designs for <b>tapered</b> <b>vessel...</b>|$|E
3000|$|An {{investigation}} of thixotropic parameter influence on blood flow in a stenosed <b>tapered</b> <b>vessel</b> {{has been carried}} out by means of analytical and numerical methods. We have studied how variation of a parameter in a range [0, 1], chosen following the evolution of transient shear, flows with time in this particular range and impacts the dynamics of an unsteady, non-Newtonian fluid flow. An approximation of a simpler dynamical system was approached {{with the help of a}} particular set of non-dimensional variables. Unique representations of axial velocity, shear stress and flow rate have been made such that their dependence on pressure gradient can be further analysed. Some factors that either impede the flow or help to accelerate it in a narrow channel in addition to varying yield stress and thixotropic parameter have been numerically investigated. The purpose of the current investigation is also to decide whether the particular model parameter regulates the dynamics of flow in a vessel differently from other known non-Newtonian models and what specific range or values of this parameter bring this model’s results to coincide with other models’ results [...]...|$|E
40|$|There is {{inadequate}} work done on tapered and stenois blood vessel under thermotheraphy, experimental studies being {{impossible to be}} conducted since the system is unlike mechanical system which could be modeled in the lab. In this study, the blood flow and heat transfer in an artery under various heating conditions have been numerically simulated. Three different cases of blood vessels are considered: straight vessel, converging <b>tapered</b> <b>vessel</b> and stenois vessel. Constant heat flux was applied at several intensities in each case. It was shown that the flow simulated at the vena contracta {{is analogous to the}} flow in a converging-diverging nozzle. However, the dimensionless center velocity at outlet region was found to be higher than that at the inlet region which could be due to the slow recovery of pressure after the stenois region. The local Nusselt number fluctuated at both the downstream and upstream which could have been caused by recirculation as the flow entered and exit the stenois region. Results in general have shown that blood flow in biological systems may well behave like the mechanical systems...|$|E
40|$|Pulp {{from the}} {{alkaline}} peroxide mechanical pulping (APMP) of oil palm empty fruit bunch, EFB, was fractionated with varying mesh-size screens {{to examine the}} effects imposed by size-specific fines on the produced pulp network. Occurring mainly as a result of refining, fines elements with dimensions almost resembling EFB fibres were the long tube-like <b>tapered</b> <b>vessels</b> from the arrays of adjoined cell walls detached along the perforation lines. These fibrillated vessel elements constituting the P 250 /R 300 fines fraction improved pulp network strength by gluing onto multiple fibres. More profound strength enhancement was promoted by the segments of the fibrillated vessel elements constituted in the P 300 /R 400 fines fraction. With reduced dimensions, these elements enhanced pulp network strength by filling the micro-voids in the pulp network. By eliminating gaps that would otherwise interrupt inter-fiber bonding, 12 % P 300 /R 400 fines fraction enhanced the EFB APMP pulp network tensile strength by 100 %...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A prototype, multi-scale, {{computational}} hemodynamic {{model is}} presented. Applications to aortic arch, carotid artery, renal artery and so forth, has demonstrated its feasibility in medical {{applications of the}} computation-based diagnosis and surgery; and with this novel multi-scale computational method in hemodynamics the noninvasive simulation of cardiovascular blood flow would become possible. We have recently developed a multi-scale, computational method that is able to predict blood flow and pressure in the systematic arteries at any position along the vessels, to compute local flow patterns as well as wall shear stresses {{at any point in}} any vessel or organ, and further to predict the behavior of the endothelial cells subjected to the local wall shear stress.

40|$|Study of intrarenal {{vasculature}} {{was carried}} out by using the metallic impregnation technique on whole kidney sections in 31 [corrected] cases of (primary and secondary) hypertension and 10 normal controls. Distinct patterns of intrarenal vasculature were noted in controls and in cases of hypertension. Gradual <b>tapering</b> of <b>vessels,</b> absence of tortuosity and good peripheral vascularisation were noted in controls. Abrupt <b>tapering,</b> tortuosity of <b>vessels</b> and poor peripheral vascularisation were noted in hypertensive cases. In essential hypertension moderate to severe changes of dilatation of the segmental and/or arcuate arteries was noted. The degree of dilatation was related to the level of systolic BP rather than diastolic in cases of essential hypertension. Secondary hypertension even if severe, rarely showed significant dilatation lesions. Avascular zones and conglomeration of vessels at poles was seen only in cases of pyelonephritis. This helped in distinguishing these, from cases of glomerulonephritis...|$|R
40|$|Time-domain-based {{one-dimensional}} {{wave propagation}} {{models of the}} arterial system are preferable over one-dimensional wave propagation models in the frequency domain since the latter neglect the non-linear convection forces present in the physiological situation, especially when the vessel is tapered. Moreover, one-dimensional wave propagation models of the arterial system {{can be used to}} provide boundary conditions for fully three-dimensional fluid–structure interaction computations that are usually defined in the time domain. In this study, a time-domain-based one-dimensional wave propagation model in a cross-sectional area, flow and pressure (A,q,p) -formulation is developed. Using this formulation, a constitutive law that includes viscoelasticity based on the mechanical behaviour of a Kelvin body, is introduced. The resulting pressure and flow waves travelling through a straight and <b>tapered</b> <b>vessel</b> are compared to experimental data obtained from measurements in an in vitro setup. The model presented shows to be well suited to predict wave propagation through these straight and tapered vessels with viscoelastic wall properties and hereto can serve as a time-domain-based method to model wave propagation in the human arterial system...|$|E
40|$|An {{occlusion}} {{device is}} placed in an abnormal opening of the heart or its surrounding vessels to regain normal blood flow. There are various occlusion devices available for treatment of various congenital heart defects like PDA, ASD, etc. However, they have limitations like residual shunting, erosion of tissue, displacement and breakage of device, thrombus formation and sudden death. To improve efficiency and to reduce failure of occlusion devices, {{it is important to}} simulate blood flow through defect before and after placement of device. It is also important to evaluate stresses and forces exerted by blood flow on device and by the device on the vessel wall. Contact friction between device and vessel wall plays a crucial role in anchoring the device. The objective is to develop a framework to determine conditions to restrict dislocation of device in terms of contact friction. Typical occlusion devices are porous initially and later due to thrombogenesis, their porosity reduces until eventually it acts as a natural permanent plug. Thus, a porous sponge is a good model for an occlusion device. The mathematical model developed here is for differential pressure causing incipient movement of device, and minimum value of contact friction for restricting movement of the device for two shapes, cylindrical and conical, in uncompressed as well as pre compressed forms. The model for differential pressure is fitted by conducting physical experiment with sponge. Mathematically, porosity is modeled using viscous resistance and inertial resistance which are calculated by experiment and simulation with ANSYS. We perform computer experiments (simulations) on a cylindrical device in a cylindrical vessel and on a conical device in a <b>tapered</b> <b>vessel</b> to determine the differential pressure across the device and hence contact friction with varied porosity under boundary conditions as in body. The contact friction required to retain device is lesser in case of conical device compared to cylindrical device. As compression of device increases, friction require to retain it decreases. Hence, lesser porosity results in larger differential pressure and lesser compression which will eventually need higher friction values to retain the device...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Blood {{dynamics}} in cardiovascular system involve length scales in vastly different ranges, entailing dimensions from cell surface receptors on the nm order up to large arteries with cm length. Hemodynamics is of multi-scale physical phenomena but conventional theories are mostly {{established at the}} individual levels of scale. Multi-scale method can break the whole work into individual but interactive domains, making the approach practical and promising for tackling the vast scale present in hemodynamics. We have developed a multi-scale, computational method that is able to predict blood flow and pressure in the systematic arteries at any position along the vessels and to compute local flow patterns as well as wall shear stresses {{at any point in}} any vessel or organ.

40|$|Incomplete stent {{apposition}} (ISA) {{is characterized}} by the lack of contact of at least 1 stent strut with the vessel wall in a segment not overlying a side branch; it is more commonly found in drug-eluting stents than bare-metal stents. The accurate diagnosis of ISA, initially only possible with intravascular ultrasound, can currently be performed with higher accuracy by optical coherence tomography, which also enables strut-level assessment due to its higher axial resolution. Different circumstances related both to the index procedure and to vascular healing might influence ISA occurrence. Although several histopathology and clinical studies linked ISA to stent thrombosis, potential selection bias precluded definitive conclusions. Initial studies usually performed single time point assessments comparing overall ISA percentage and magnitude in different groups (i. e., stent type), thus hampering a comprehensive understanding of its relationship with vascular healing. Serial intravascular imaging studies that evaluated vascular response heterogeneity recently helped fill this gap. Some particular clinical scenarios such as acute coronary syndromes, bifurcations, <b>tapered</b> <b>vessels,</b> overlapping stents, and chronic total occlusions might predispose to ISA. Interventional cardiologists should be committed to optimal stent choices and techniques of implantation and use intravascular imaging guidance when appropriate to aim at minimizing acute ISA. In addition, the active search for new stent platforms that could accommodate vessel remodeling over time (i. e., self-expandable stents) and for new polymers and/or eluting drugs that could induce less inflammation (hence, less positive remodeling) could ultimately reduce the occurrence of ISA and its potentially harmful consequences...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background There {{are some}} early {{clinical}} indicators of cardiac ischemia, most notably {{a change in}} a person's electrocardiogram. Less well understood, but potentially just as dangerous, is ischemia that develops in the gastrointestinal system. Such ischemia is difficult to diagnose without angiography (an invasive and time-consuming procedure) mainly due to the highly unspecific nature of the disease. Understanding how perfusion is affected during ischemic conditions can be a useful clinical tool which can help clinicians during the diagnosis process. As a first step towards this final goal, a computational model of the gastrointestinal system has been developed and used to simulate realistic blood flow during normal conditions. Methods An anatomically and biophysically based model of the major mesenteric arteries has been developed {{to be used to}} simulate normal blood flows. The computational mesh used for the simulations has been generated using data from the Visible Human project. The 3 D Navier-Stokes equations that govern flow within this mesh have been simplified to an efficient 1 D scheme. This scheme, together with a constitutive pressure-radius relationship, has been solved numerically for pressure, vessel radius and velocity for the entire mesenteric arterial network. Results The computational model developed shows close agreement with physiologically realistic geometries other researchers have recorded in vivo. Using this model as a framework, results were analyzed for the four distinct phases of the cardiac cycle – diastole, isovolumic contraction, ejection and isovolumic relaxation. Profiles showing the temporally varying pressure and velocity for a periodic input varying between 10. 2 kPa (77 mmHg) and 14. 6 kPa (110 mmHg) at the abdominal aorta are presented. An analytical solution has been developed to model blood flow in <b>tapering</b> <b>vessels</b> and when compared with the numerical solution, showed excellent agreement. Conclusion An anatomically and physiologically realistic computational model of the major mesenteric arteries has been developed for the gastrointestinal system. Using this model, blood flow has been simulated which show physiologically realistic flow profiles. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{vascular}} rarefaction (the loss of small arteries) on {{the circulation of}} blood are studied using a multiscale mathematical model that can predict blood flow and pressure in the systemic and pulmonary arteries. We augmented a model originally developed for the systemic arteries (Olufsen et al. 1998, 1999, 2000, 2004) to (a) predict flow and pressure in the pulmonary arteries, and (b) predict pressure propagation along the small arteries in the vascular beds. The systemic and pulmonary arteries are modelled as separate, bifurcating trees of compliant and <b>tapering</b> <b>vessels.</b> Each tree {{is divided into two}} parts representing the ‘large’ and ‘small’ arteries. Blood flow and pressure in the large arteries are predicted using a nonlinear cross-sectional area-averaged model for a Newtonian fluid in an elastic tube with inflow obtained from magnetic resonance measurements. Each terminal vessel within the network of the large arteries is coupled to a vascular bed of small ‘resistance’ arteries, which are modelled as asymmetric structured trees with specified area and asymmetry ratios between the parent and daughter arteries. For the systemic circulation, each structured tree represents a specific vascular bed corresponding to major organs and limbs. For the pulmonary circulation, there are four vascular beds supplied by the interlobar arteries. This manuscript presents the first theoretical calculations of the propagation of the pressure and flow waves along systemic and pulmonary large and small arteries. Results for all networks were in agreement with published observations. Two studies were done with this model. First, we showed how rarefaction can be modelled by pruning the tree of arteries in the microvascular system. This was done by modulating parameters used for designing the structured trees. Results showed that rarefaction leads to increased mean and decreased pulse pressure in the large arteries. Second, we investigated the impact of decreasing vessel compliance in both large and small arteries. Results showed, that the effects of decreased compliance in the large arteries far outweigh the effects observed when decreasing the compliance of the small arteries. We further showed that a decrease of compliance in the large arteries results in pressure increases consistent with observations of isolated systolic hypertension, as occurs in ageing...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{considerably}} expands {{our understanding}} of hydraulic architecture in the genus Eucalyptus. The major finding is that xylem <b>vessels</b> in eucalypts <b>taper</b> at variable rates {{from the base of}} the stem to the top of the tree, depending on species and environment. The systematic assessment of changes in the structure of <b>vessel</b> <b>tapering</b> (reduction in xylem vessel diameter per unit length of stem, from the base to the apex) across a gradient of increasing aridity uncovers that the degree of taper is not a function of plant height but for coping with prevalent limitations like water or light. In some tall species from mesic climates (e. g. Eucalyptus regnans F. Muell.) <b>vessel</b> <b>taper</b> may be close to zero for the great majority of the stem, before increasing rapidly within the apical region of the canopy. For other species, such as those from semi-arid environments (e. g. Eucalyptus gracilis F. Muell.), tapering begins much further towards the base of the stem. These findings are highly novel and contradict some major theories (e. g. Metabolic Scaling Theory, MST). Yet, they are entirely in keeping with the general thrust of the ‘cohesion-tension’ theory of water movement in trees. This thesis includes several supporting studies for the above. A glasshouse study suggested thateven at seedling stage, environmental conditions such as temperature and moisture and nutrient availability, play roles in xylem formation (xylogenesis). Despite these suggestions, research in the glasshouse was inconclusive. This was most likely due to the relatively slow response of major biophysical processes, such as the development of structural entities like xylem vessels, when compared to faster responses to environmental conditions of biochemical processes such as those involved in photosynthesis and respiration. A field study of the potential role of water storage in heartwood (i. e. capacitance) in water transport, was hampered by prevailing environmental conditions and uncertainty around the sources of water being used by the study tree. Nonetheless, the data and the knowledge gained by both experiments add to current understanding how functionality of xylem tissues can be maintained under different environmental conditions, including elevated temperatures and water shortage. However, the major body of work in this thesis rests with analysis of xylem vessels at a microscopic scale. This work required significant development of techniques suitable for use with eucalypts that contain some of the hardest wood of all trees. The research also required development of software scripts capable of quantification of properties in large numbers (> 150, 000) of vessels across a dozen or so species, and multiple field sites. Additionally, the work reported here includes a rigorous assessment of climate across field sites and then use of that to interpret xylem structure. The resultant phase analysis of rates of tapering within trees, is both an Australian and world first. Adopting methodology widely used in other fields of biology, this thesis employs a phase analysis of <b>tapering</b> of xylem <b>vessels</b> to highlight: 1. 	That the insertion point of <b>vessel</b> <b>taper</b> towards the top of trees differs largely among eucalypt species. 2. 	That regardless of species and location, vessel diameter at the apex does not differ widely among species – this, at least, accords with MST. 3. 	That rates of taper within the apical region of canopies where the risk of cavitation is greatest are closely related to environmental conditions, particularly the availability of water and competition for light...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this investigation}} are to evaluate the rheologic properties in atherosclerotic disease treated with the various {{coronary artery bypass graft}} (CABG) models by numerical analysis, we used four different CABG models for the assessment of spatial fluctuation in wall shear stress, pressure variation and mass flow rate with Carreau model and Navier-Stokes equation. Wall shear stress was higher in a naturally tapered model (model 1) and a constant (non-tapered) diameter of the graft vessel the same as the distal LAD (model 4) than in others. Pressure variation along the native coronary artery and graft vessels was higher in a model 4, model 1 than in a reverse tapering model (model 2) and a constant diameter of the graft vessel the same as the proximal LAD (model 3). The mass flow rate of the distal part (kg/sec,. m(o)) was the highest in model 3. This study suggests that in vitro spatial simulation following CABG revealed that small caliber or <b>tapered</b> graft <b>vessels</b> have adverse hemodynamic effects on the native and graft vessels.

40|$|Despite the {{clinical}} effectiveness of coronary artery stenting, percutaneous coronary intervention or “stenting” {{is not free}} of complications.

40|$|Variation in {{angiosperm}} vessel diameter is {{of major}} functional significance. In {{the light of}} recent models predicting optimal <b>vessel</b> <b>taper</b> given resistance imposed by conductive path length, we tested the prediction that plant size should predict vessel diameter, with dryland plants having narrower vessels for their stem sizes. We assembled a comparative dataset including vessel and stem diameter measurements from 237 species from over 40 angiosperm orders across {{a wide range of}} habits and habitats. Stem diameter predicted vessel diameter across self-supporting plants (slope 0. 36, 95 % CI 0. 32 - 0. 39). Samples from 142 species from five communities of differing water availability showed no tendency for dryland plants to have narrower vessels. Predictable relationships between vessel diameter and stem diameter mirrored predictable relationships between stem length and diameter across self-supporting species. That vessels are proportional to stem diameter and stem diameter is proportional to stem length suggests that taper in relation to conductive path length gives rise to the vessel diameter-stem diameter relationship. In turn, plant size is related to climate, leading indirectly to the vessel-climate relationship: vessels are likely narrower in drier communities because dryland plants are on average smaller, not because they have narrow vessels for their stem sizes. 10 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Premise of research. Variation {{in average}} xylem vessel {{diameter}} across species has important functional consequences, but {{the causes of}} this variation remain unclear. Average vessel diameter is known to scale with stem size within and across species. Vessel diameter also seems to differ between clades and across environments, with dryland plants having narrower, more cavitation-resistant vessels. As a result, {{it is not clear}} to what extent phylogenetic affinity and environment are associated with differences in the vessel diameter–stem size relationship. Methodology. With linear models and correlations, we explored the influence of environment and phy- logeny on the vessel diameter–stem diameter relationship in a molecular phylogenetic context across 83 species in four families spanning desert to rain forest in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Madagascar. Pivotal results. Mean species vessel diameter was strongly predicted by trunk diameter (slope ∼ 0. 33), and this slope was not affected by either phylogenetic affinity or environment. Clades differed only slightly in mean vessel diameter when controlling for stem size, and there was no tendency for plants of moist environments to have wider vessels. Of four climate indexes, only the temperature index contributed to explaining vessel diameter, although very weakly. Conclusions. Our results are congruent with models suggesting that natural selection should maximize vessel conductivity while minimizing cavitation risk via <b>vessel</b> <b>taper</b> in the context of conductive path length. Because neither environment nor phylogeny contributed to explaining vessel diameter–stem diameter scaling across species, our results appear congruent with the notion that selection favoring cavitation resistance via narrow vessels should lead to shorter statures independently of ancestry or habitat. The repeated finding of narrow vessels in dryland plants might therefore reflect the smaller average stem size of plants in drylands rather than the plants having vessels that are narrow for their stem diameters...|$|R

Methods 100 consecutive patients aged ≥ 40 years (50 men and 50 women) who had undergone CT angiography (CTA) but had no vascular abnormality were analyzed. Specific software was used to make vessel measurements along the center line. The length of the intracranial vertebral artery (VA), the basilar artery (BA) and {{the distance from the}} mid-basilar artery to the posterior cerebral artery (mBA-PCA) was recorded. Vessel diameter was measured at the proximal and distal ends of these <b>vessel</b> lengths. <b>Vessel</b> <b>taper</b> was calculated as the change in diameter in millimeters per centimeter of length. Results The mean lengths of the intracranial VA, the BA and the mBA-PCA were 40 ± 10. 6 mm, 27. 3 ± 5. 7 mm and 25. 6 ± 4. 3 mm, respectively. The proximal and distal diameters were 3. 9 ± 0. 8 mm and 2. 8 ± 0. 6 mm for the VA and 3. 6 ± 0. 6 mm and 3. 1 ± 0. 5 mm for the BA, respectively. The mean mid-BA diameter and the proximal PCA diameter were 3. 2 ± 0. 5 mm and 2. 2 ± 0. 4 mm, respectively. There was a significant increase in arterial caliber in patients aged ≥ 60 years compared with those aged 40 – 59 years. Men also tended to have longer vessels with a larger diameter than women.

Flexible stent designs that accommodate well to <b>vessel</b> <b>tapering</b> may be of benefit in challenging anatomies such as bifurcated target lesions, but so far data are scarce. Methods We analyzed the 2 -year follow-up data of the DUTCH PEERS (TWENTE II) trial, which randomized 1811 all-comer patients to PCI with newer generation resolute integrity zotarolimus-eluting (Medtronic) or promus element everolimus-eluting stents (Boston Scientific). In bifurcated lesions, provisional stenting was generally performed. Target vessel failure is a composite endpoint, consisting of cardiac death, target vessel MI, or target vessel revascularization. Results Patients {{with at least one}} bifurcated lesion (n = 465, 25. 7 %) versus patients with non-bifurcated target lesions only (n = 1346, 74. 3 %) showed similar rates of clinical endpoints including target vessel failure (9. 2 versus 7. 9 %, p = 0. 36) and definite stent thrombosis (0. 4 versus 1. 0 %, p = 0. 38). Target vessel MI was more common in patients with bifurcated lesions (3. 4 versus 1. 6 %, p = 0. 02); but after multivariate analysis with propensity score adjustment, bifurcation treatment was found not to be an independent predictor of target vessel MI (HR 1. 40, 95 % CI 0. 71 – 2. 76; p = 0. 34). Among patients with bifurcated lesions, DES type and side-branch size did not affect outcome, but periprocedural MI occurred more often after two-stent approaches (9. 0 versus 2. 1 %; p = 0. 002).

In this study, we assessed the suitability of the STENTYS DES(P), a self-apposing nitinol paclitaxel-eluting stent, for use in the treat-ment of distal ULMCA lesions. Methods and Results: From February 2012 to Septem-ber 2013, 75 consecutive patients with tapered (that is a> 1 mm difference in the diameter from the proximal to the distal main vessel) distal ULMCA lesions were treated with the STENTYS DES(P) (STENTYS-DES group) at the Clinica Mediterranea (Naples, Italy). A matched-group of 75 patients treated with second-generation DES in the same period (Control group) was selected from the database of New Tokyo Hospi-tal (Chiba, Japan). The result was assessed by both quantitative coronary angiography and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). Although the final balloon diameter was larger in the Control group (4. 516 0. 51 vs. 3. 626 0. 49 mm; P< 0. 001), the IVUS analysis showed a larger final minimal lumen area in the STENTYS-DES group than in the Control group (left main: 17. 456 3. 45 vs. 14. 846 3. 45 mm 2; P< 0. 001; polygon of confluence: 15. 746 3. 28 vs. 12. 556 5. 45 mm 2; P< 0. 002; ostial left anterior descending artery: 11. 736 1. 97 vs. 8. 566 1. 80 mm 2; P< 0. 001). At 126 5 months, major adverse cardiac events (including death, myocardial infarction, and repeat revascularization) occurred in seven patients in both groups. Conclusions: This pilot study suggests that the self-apposing properties of the STENTYS DES(P) offer a valid alternative for the treatment of the distal ULMCA lesions. VC 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

A seepage term is included in the continuity equation to allow for flow through small branches. Large branches are modeled as arterial segments terminating as modified Windkessel lumped impedances. Arterial stenoses are modeled with a nonlinear equation relating flow and pressure drop. The method of finite-elements with semi-discrete shape functions is used to solve for pressure and flow variations along the arterial segment. The sensitivity of the model is specific values of lumped impedance parameters has been investigated in detail. Some validation studies were carried out based on pressure and flow measurements obtained from the hindlimbs of dogs. Reasonable agreement between observed and predicted flow waveforms were obtained;The suitability of the finite-element method for the study of arterial flow dynamics, and the importance of using the correct form of lumped impedance, has been demonstrated by simulating flow in two different arterial segments: (1) the human leg arteries containing stenoses, and (2) the bovine uterine artery;The predicted waveforms for the human femoral artery compared well with those published in past studies. In this study the effects of (1) multiple stenoses, and (2) compensation of peripheral beds to accommodate for stenosis induced loss of pressure were considered. The human leg artery model was also used to study the effects of approximating wall shear in the momentum equation;The bovine uterine artery is unique since flow and mechanical properties associated with the artery undergo marked changes during the estrous cycle. With proper selection of the lumped impedances and main arterial parameters, good agreement between predicted and measured flow waveforms was achieved...|$|R
