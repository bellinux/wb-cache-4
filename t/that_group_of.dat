5|$|One of {{the most}} notable Crabbet-bred stallions Brown {{eventually}} kept at Maynesboro was *Astraled, {{who had come to}} America in 1909. This horse had been sold by Wilfrid Blunt to an American buyer from Massachusetts, but after siring only two purebred foals in New England, was sold to the remount, shipped west, and lived in obscurity in Oregon, where he sired no purebred Arabian offspring. *Astraled was ultimately obtained by Brown in 1923, who shipped the aged horse by rail from Idaho to New Hampshire. *Astraled only sired one foal crop at Maynesboro, but <b>that</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> foals included his most notable American-bred son, Gulastra.|$|E

25|$|Organizational ecology also {{predicts that}} the rates of {{founding}} and mortality are dependent {{on the number of}} organizations (density) in the market. The two central mechanisms here are legitimization (the recognition or taken-for-grantedness of <b>that</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> organizations) and competition. Legitimization generally increases (at a decreasing rate) with the number of organizations, but so does competition (at an increasing rate). The result is that legitimization processes will prevail at low numbers of organizations, while competition will at high numbers.|$|E
25|$|Mesoamerica is {{the region}} {{extending}} from central Mexico {{south to the}} northwestern border of Costa Rica {{that gave rise to}} a group of stratified, culturally related agrarian civilizations spanning an approximately 3,000-year period before the visits to the New World by Christopher Columbus. Mesoamerican is the adjective generally used to refer to <b>that</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> pre-Columbian cultures.

25|$|According to Andrew Beveridge, a Professor of Sociology at Queens College, between 2000 and 2005, {{young women}} in their twenties earned more than their male {{counterparts}} in some large urban centers, including Dallas (120%), New York (117%), Chicago, Boston, and Minneapolis. A major {{reason for this is that}} women have been graduating from college in larger numbers than men, and that many of those women seem to be gravitating toward major urban areas. In 2005, 53% of women in their 20s working in New York were college graduates, compared with only 38% of men of that age. Nationwide, the wages of <b>that</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> women averaged 89% of the average full-time pay for men between 2000 and 2005.|$|E

Referring to the suspects {{who might have been}} involved in burglaries in the area, he said that police had [...] "pretty much closed off <b>that</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> people". The remaining detectives were focusing on a small number of remaining inquiries that they believe are significant: [...] "If we didn't think they were significant, we wouldn't be carrying on."

500|$|The infighting exasperated Taylor, the US Ambassador to South Vietnam {{and former}} Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, who felt the {{disputes}} between the junta's senior officers were derailing the war effort. Only {{a few days}} earlier, General William Westmoreland—the commander of US forces in Vietnam—had invited him and the Vietnamese generals home to a dinner. There Taylor asked {{for an end to}} the persistent changes in leadership, and Khánh and his men assured him of stability. Westmoreland warned that persistent instability would turn the American political class and public against Saigon, as they would deem it useless to support such a regime. Taylor initially cabled the State Department back in the US to state a [...] "naked military fist" [...] had [...] "crumpled [...] carefully woven fabric of civilian government", and that the arrest of the civilians would be [...] "immediately and understandably interpreted by all the world as another military coup, setting back all that had been accomplished" [...] since the formation of the HNC and the creation of a veneer of civilian rule. He went on to say that an [...] "inescapable conclusion that if a group of military officers could issue decisions abolishing one of the three fundamental organs of the governmental structure...and carry out military arrests of civilians, <b>that</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> military officers has clearly set themselves above and beyond the structure of government in Vietnam." [...] Taylor bemoaned the fact that the generals had shown no second thoughts about ignoring US policy recommendations, particularly in disregarding his explicit advice to maintain stable civilian rule, at least at a nominal level. Taylor issued a thinly disguised threat to cut aid, releasing a public statement saying Washington might reconsider its military funding if [...] "the fabric of legal government" [...] was not reinstated.|$|E
500|$|On September 11, Matthew Woll, an AFL vice-president, {{said his}} {{organization}} discouraged strikes by government employees but defended {{their right to}} organize: [...] "all wage earners {{have the right to}} associate with one another and collectively to improve their condition". He blamed the strike on government managers who failed to recognize that right and put the Boston situation {{in the context of the}} broader union movement: [...] "On the question of industrial democracy , we find still <b>that</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> employers, Bourbonic in character, who believe democracy means for them to ruin or rule industrially. They cannot conceive that the workers have any right in the management of industry. ... The time has passed when any man can say he is the ruler of the people in his employment." [...] AFL President Samuel Gompers, just returned from Europe, quickly assessed the situation and the strength of public sentiment. On September 12, he urged the strikers to return to work, asking the city to agree to suspend judgment on whether to recognize the police union. In a telegram to Mayor Peters he cited the model of Washington, D.C., which had, at the suggestion of President Wilson, suspended its regulation forbidding police officers to join a union affiliated with the AFL until a conference scheduled for October 6. The police accepted Gompers' recommendation immediately. Coolidge replied with a statement of support for Curtis' hard line. Gompers telegraphed Coolidge again, this time blaming Curtis for the crisis. Coolidge dismissed the Commissioner's behavior as irrelevant, because no provocation could justify the police walkout. His terse summation created his reputation on the national scene: [...] "There is no right to strike against the public safety, anywhere, anytime." [...] Coolidge said he would continue to [...] "defend the sovereignty of Massachusetts." ...|$|E
