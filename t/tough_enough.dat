5|$|Distinguished Maya warriors entered battle wearing armour. The {{upper body}} {{was covered by}} a short jacket that was filled with rock salt, and the forearms and legs were {{protected}} with tight bindings of cloth or leather. The salt-packed cotton armour was <b>tough</b> <b>enough</b> that even arrows could not penetrate it. Armour could be decorated and was often adorned with feathers. Commoners did not wear armour in battle, usually only wearing a loincloth and warpaint. Warriors carried shields made from two right-angled wooden bars with deerskin stretched across them.|$|E
5|$|For a phylum with {{relatively}} few species, ctenophores {{have a wide}} range of body plans. Coastal species need to be <b>tough</b> <b>enough</b> to withstand waves and swirling sediment particles, while some oceanic species are so fragile that {{it is very difficult to}} capture them intact for study. In addition oceanic species do not preserve well, and are known mainly from photographs and from observers' notes. Hence most attention has until recently concentrated on three coastal genera – Pleurobrachia, Beroe and Mnemiopsis. At least two textbooks base their descriptions of ctenophores on the cydippid Pleurobrachia.|$|E

5|$|Banksia ericifolia inflorescences {{attract a}} variety of birds to the garden. <b>Tough</b> <b>enough</b> {{to be used as}} a street plant in parts of Sydney, B.ericifolia is a fairly easy plant to grow in the {{conditions}} it likes, namely a sandy, well drained soil and a sunny aspect. It requires extra water over dryer periods until established, which may take up to two years, as it comes from an area with rainfall in predominantly warmer months. It is resistant to Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback, like most eastern banksias As it grows naturally on acid soils, Banksia ericifolia is particularly sensitive to iron deficiency. Known as chlorosis, this problem manifests as yellowing of new leaves with preservation of green veins; it can occur on plants grown in soils of high pH. This can happen especially where soil contains quantities of cement, either as landfill or building foundations, and can be treated with iron chelate or sulfate.|$|E
