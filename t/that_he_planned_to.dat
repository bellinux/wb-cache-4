5|$|During the half-time interval, Stein gave also Gordon Strachan notice <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>planned</b> <b>to</b> {{bring him}} {{off during the}} second half and replace him with winger Davie Cooper. Stein's five-man {{defensive}} set-up meant that his midfielders were outnumbered by the Welsh, and consequently Strachan had failed to make an impact on the game up to then. Despite this, Strachan was prepared to argue with Stein that he should remain on, until Alex Ferguson cautioned him to be aware that the manager was clearly not well, and should not cause too much stress with a confrontation.|$|E
5|$|During the {{interviews}} and in later correspondence, Josephine and Wyatt {{went to great}} lengths to keep her name out of Lake's book. Lake wrote Earp <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>planned</b> <b>to</b> send portions of the book to his New York agent, but Earp objected because he wanted to read it first. After Earp's death on January 13, 1929, Josephine continued to try to persuade Lake to leave her and Earp's former wife, Mattie Blaylock, out of the book, even threatening legal action. Lake finally published Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshal in 1931, two years after Earp's death.|$|E

With this in mind Chaerea convinced his fellow conspirators to put their plot into action quickly.|$|E
