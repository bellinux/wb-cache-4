Semi-permanent coating of dioctadecyl dimethyl ammonium chloride (DDAC) was applied and investigated to enhance separation efficiency of trimethyltin (TMT) <b>chloride,</b> <b>tributyltin</b> (TBT) <b>chloride,</b> dibutyltin (DBT) dichloride and monobutyltin (MBT) trichloride. The electrolyte composition and ionic strength were optimized. Running buffer containing 0. 608 mol L(- 1) HAc and 7 mmol L(- 1) NaAc was selected for the separation. The detection limits of the four organotin compounds ranged from 0. 037 to 0. 112 mg L(- 1) (as Sn) and {{the values of the}} relative standard deviation (RSD) were below 3. 1 % for migration time, less than 7. 8 % for peak height and not more than 8. 4 % for peak area.

40|$|AbstractOrganotin {{compounds}} {{are widely}} distributed toxicants. They are membrane-active molecules with broad biological toxicity. In this contribution, we study {{the effect of}} triorganotin compounds on membrane permeability using phospholipid model membranes and human erythrocytes. Tribultyltin and triphenyltin are able to induce the release of entrapped carboxyfluorescein from large unilamellar vesicles. The rate of release is similar for phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylserine systems {{and the presence of}} equimolar cholesterol decreases the rate of the process. Release of carboxyfluorescein is almost abolished when a non-diffusible anion like gluconate is present in the external medium, and it is restored by addition of <b>chloride.</b> <b>Tributyltin</b> is able to cause hemolysis of human erythrocytes in a dose-dependent manner. Relative kinetics determination shows that potassium leakage occurs simultaneously with hemoglobin release. Hemolysis is reduced when erythrocytes are suspended in a gluconate medium. These results indicate that triorganotin compounds are able to transport organic anions like carboxyfluorescein across phospholipids bilayers by exchange diffusion with chloride and suggest that anion exchange through erythrocyte membrane could be related to the process of hemolysis...|$|R

40|$|Organotins are a {{group of}} {{chemical}} compounds that have a tin atom covalently bound {{to one or more}} organic groups. The best-studied organotin is <b>tributyltin</b> <b>chloride,</b> which is an environmental pollutant and an endocrine disruptor. <b>Tributyltin</b> <b>chloride</b> has been shown to bind to PPARγ/RXRα and induces adipogenesis in different mammalian cells. However, there are few studies with other organotin compounds, such as dibutyltins. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the effect of dibutyltins diacetate, dichloride, dilaurate, and maleate on the transcriptional activity of the nuclear PPARγ and RXRα receptors, and on adipogenesis and inflammation. Analogous to <b>tributyltin</b> <b>chloride,</b> in reporter gene assay using HeLa cells, we observed that dibutyltins diacetate, dichloride, dilaurate, and maleate are partial agonists of PPARγ. Unlike <b>tributyltin</b> <b>chloride,</b> which is a full agonist of RXRα, dibutyltins dichloride and dilaurate are partial RXRα agonists. Additionally, the introduction of the C 285 S mutation, which disrupts <b>tributyltin</b> <b>chloride</b> binding to PPARγ, abrogated the dibutyltin agonistic activity. In 3 T 3 -L 1 preadipocytes, all dibutyltin induced adipogenesis, although the effect was less pronounced than that of rosiglitazone and <b>tributyltin</b> <b>chloride.</b> This adipogenic effect was confirmed by the expression of adipogenic markers Fabp 4, Adipoq, and Glut 4. Exposure of 3 T 3 -L 1 cells with dibutyltin in the presence of T 0070907, a specific PPARγ antagonist, reduced fat accumulation, suggesting that adipogenic effect occurs through PPARγ. Furthermore, dibutyltins dichloride, dilaurate, and maleate inhibited the expression of proinflammatory genes in 3 T 3 -L 1 cells, such as Vcam 1, Dcn, Fn 1, S 100 a 8, and Lgals 9. Additionally, in RAW 264. 7 macrophages, <b>tributyltin</b> <b>chloride</b> and dibutyltin dilaurate reduced LPS-stimulated TNFα expression. Our findings indicate that dibutyltins diacetate, dichloride, dilaurate, and maleate are PPARγ partial agonists and that dibutyltins dichloride and dilaurate are also partial RXRα agonists. Furthermore, dibutyltins induce adipogenesis in a PPARγ-dependent manner and repress inflammatory genes in 3 T 3 -L 1 and RAW 264. 7 cells. Although dibutyltins display some partial PPARγ/RXRα agonistic effects, the translation of cell-based results assays into in vivo effects on inflammation and insulin resistance is not entirely known. Nevertheless, further studies are necessary to address their effects in different periods of life and to elucidate the actions of organostanic compounds in whole-body context...|$|E
40|$|Keratinocytes play an {{important}} role in skin irritation. In an attempt to investigate mechanistic bases of human skin irritation response, we recently identified the upregulation by skin irritants of adipose differentiation related protein (ADRP) in reconstituted human epidermis. ADRP is a lipid-storage-droplet-associated protein, governing deposition and release of lipids from droplets. The purpose of this study was to characterize, in a human keratinocyte cell line (NCTC 2544), sodium-dodecyl-sulfate-induced ADRP expression, to identify the biochemical events that lead to ADRP expression, and to understand its function in sodium dodecyl sulfate cytotoxicity. Sodium dodecyl sulfate induced a concentration- and time-related production of ADRP that was associated with lipid droplet accumulation. Lipid accumulation following sodium dodecyl sulfate treatment was due to intracellular redistribution rather than lipid neosynthesis, as indicated by equivalent (14) C-oleate and (14) C-acetate incorporations. Other skin irritants, namely benzalkonium <b>chloride,</b> <b>tributyltin,</b> and 12 -O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13 -acetate, also induce lipid droplet accumulation. Sodium-dodecyl-sulfate-induced ADRP expression and lipid droplet accumulation were modulated by the calcium chelator BAPTA, indicating a role of calcium in ADRP induction. Decrease of sodium-dodecyl-sulfate-induced ADRP expression by specific ADRP antisense oligonucleotide resulted in increased cytotoxicity, indicating a protective role of ADRP and lipid accumulation in the process of cell damage induced by skin irritants. ADRP expression was also induced in vivo following treatment with sodium dodecyl sulfate in an experimental model of skin irritation, indicating that the in vitro model represents irritation...|$|R
40|$|Among {{the class}} of organotin compounds, the most well known is {{tributyltin}} (TBT). Organotin have many applications, which include use in PVC, as catalyst in chemical reactions, agricultural pesticides and antifungal treatments for textile polymers. In particular TBT is used in marine antifoulant paints to prevent the growth of organisms such as barnacles on the hull of ships. Extensive use in antifouling paints led to the widespread distribution of TBT and its breakdown products in the global marine, sediment and biota. High levels of TBT in the waters {{were found to have}} impaired reproduction, by inhibiting embryogenesis and larval development in a variety of marine organisms. Symptoms of the exposure to high levels of TBT in some invertebrates includes the development of male sexual characteristics as a penis and vas deferens by females (imposex). Ascidians are a good model for the study of embryonal development. They are also sensitive bioindicators of habitat degradation. The effects of <b>tributyltin</b> (IV) <b>chloride</b> (TBT chloride) solutions on ascidian embryos of Ciona intestinalis at different stages of development have been described. Previously, we carried out observations with both the light and the electron microscope on Ciona intestinalis embryos and larvae incubated in TBT solutions. This studies showed morphological and ultrastructural modifications of the embryos and larvae after incubation in TBT chloride at different concentrations. To understand molecular effects of TBT-induced on ascidians embryogenesis we have set out to study the effects of TBT at different concentrations, testing the activity of some protein with a basic role in embryonic development. In ascidian embryos, a fibroblast growth factor (FGF) -like signal has been proposed to be involved in induction of notochord and mesoderm formation. A main pathway is a protein kinase transduction pathway, which includes Ras, Raf, mitogenactivated protein (MAP) kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase/MAP kinase (ERK). The aim of this work in progress is to understand whether the TBT exposure on ascidian embryos at different stage of development cause alterations in tyrosine phosphorylation pattern and in MAPK activity. Tyrosine phosphorylation promotes cell growth, differentiation and apoptosis, due to activity of receptor tyrosine kinases and furthermore different stressors are known to stimulate tyrosine kinase activity. At first we focused our attention on tyrosine phosphorylation pattern after ascidian embryos to different stage of development TBT treatment. Phosphorylated proteins pattern is evaluated by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and Western blotting on protein extract of ascidianembryos incubated with TBT, using anti-phosphotyrosine-antibody directed against mammalian phosphotyrosine. Preliminary results showed a different pattern on protein phosphorylation in response to the incubation with TBT in μM range. Since MAPKs {{play a key role in}} animal responses to a wide variety of environmental stresses, we have thought to test the role of MAPK pathway proteins such as MAPK p 38 (Thr 180 and Tyr 182), p 44 / 42 (Thr 202 /Tyr 204) and c-Jun Nterminal kinases (JNK) after TBT treatment...|$|R

Rotation was probed with an 80 -nm bead attached to the ring of c subunits in the immobilized FoF 1 and recorded with a submillisecond fast camera. The rotation rates at various ATP concentrations obeyed the curve defined by a Km of ≈ 30 μM and a Vmax of ≈ 350 revolutions per second (at 37 °C). At low ATP, ATP-waiting dwell was seen and the kon-ATP {{was estimated to be}} 3. 6 × 107 M- 1 ·s- 1.

40|$|Previously {{we showed}} a battery {{consisting}} of CALUX transcriptional activation assays, the ReProGlo assay, and the {{embryonic stem cell}} test, and zebrafish embryotoxicity assay as 'apical' tests to correctly predict developmental toxicity for 11 out of 12 compounds, and to explain the one false negative (Piersma et al., 2013 [7]). Here we report on applying this battery {{within the context of}} grouping and read across, put forward as a potential tool to fill data gaps and avoid animal testing, to distinguish in vivo non- or weak developmental toxicants from potent developmental toxicants within groups of structural analogs. The battery correctly distinguished 2 -methylhexanoic acid, monomethyl phthalate, and monobutyltin trichloride as non- or weak developmental toxicants from structurally related developmental toxicants valproic acid, mono-ethylhexyl phthalate, and <b>tributyltin</b> <b>chloride,</b> respectively, and, therefore, holds promise as a biological verification model in grouping and read across approaches. The relevance of toxicokinetic information is indicated...|$|E
40|$|<b>Tributyltin</b> <b>chloride</b> (TBTC) is {{well known}} for its immunotoxic effect, in {{particular}} towards immature thymocytes. TBTC is also known to induce adipocyte differentiation in primary human bone marrow cultures, which is reflected in the decrease in a number of adipocyte-derived cytokines, chemokines and the adipocyte-linked hormone leptin. Since adipocytes influence haematopoiesis and lymphopoiesis for instance by these cytokines and hormones, we here investigated whether TBTC has an effect on specific lymphocyte subsets in human bone marrow primary cultures. FACS analysis showed a reduction of CD 19 /CD 22 -positive B cells by TBTC, both in {{the presence or absence of}} cytokines. The treatment did not cause a toxic effect on mature CD 3 +CD 4 + and CD 3 +CD 8 + T cells, suggesting selective TBTC toxicity on B lymphocytes in the presently used in vitro system. JRC.
