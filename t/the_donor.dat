25|$|The {{conventional}} technique, {{known as}} octopus donation, is to donate a secondary demand valve supplied from <b>the</b> <b>donor's</b> primary gas supply, {{known as an}} octopus DV, which is mounted ready for use in an easily accessible position in <b>the</b> <b>donor's</b> chest area, and is often yellow for easy recognition.|$|R

5|$|Following a {{supernova}} explosion, the remnant of <b>the</b> <b>donor</b> star (IK Pegasus A) would {{continue with the}} final velocity it possessed {{when it was a}} member of a close orbiting binary system. The resulting relative velocity could be as high as 100–200km/s, which would place it among the high-velocity members of the galaxy. The companion will also have lost some mass during the explosion, and its presence may create a gap in the expanding debris. From that point forward it will evolve into a single white dwarf star. The supernova explosion will create a remnant of expanding material that will eventually merge with the surrounding interstellar medium.|$|E
5|$|Fund {{accounting}} {{distinguishes between}} two primary classes of fund. Those funds {{that have an}} unrestricted use, that can be spent for any purposes by the organisation and those that have a restricted use. The reason for the restriction can be {{for a number of}} different reasons. Examples include legal requirements, where the moneys can only be lawfully used for a specific purpose, or a restriction imposed by <b>the</b> <b>donor</b> or provider. These donor/provider restrictions are usually communicated in writing and may be found in the terms of an agreement, government grant, will or gift.|$|E
5|$|Fund {{accounting}} is {{an accounting}} system for recording resources whose use {{has been limited}} by <b>the</b> <b>donor,</b> grant authority, governing agency, or other individuals or organisations or by law. It emphasizes accountability rather than profitability, and is used by Nonprofit organizations and by governments. In this method, a fund consists of a self-balancing set of accounts and each are reported as either unrestricted, temporarily restricted or permanently restricted based on the provider-imposed restrictions.|$|E
5000|$|In Providence, {{a husband}} and his wife die in a botched robbery; we see {{flickers}} of his last memories. His heart goes to Terry Bernard, a single father raising a girl with a rare degenerative disease. After the operation, Terry has flashes of memory from the last moments of <b>the</b> dead <b>donor's</b> life. Then, he recognizes one of <b>the</b> <b>donor's</b> killers and follows him into an alley. Within days, Terry becomes an unwilling avenger, with a police detective on his trail. Meanwhile, he begins a romance with his daughter's doctor, his moods complicated by memory flashes, <b>the</b> <b>donor's</b> deepening presence in both Terry's mind and body, and the unexplained bond among <b>the</b> <b>donor's</b> killers.

5|$|In 1902, Vassar College in {{the town}} of Poughkeepsie, New York, {{completed}} Davison House, the fourth dorm in the college's residential quadrangle (quad).

Totaling $212,500, construction was paid for using college funds (versus <b>the</b> <b>donor</b> funds that paid for Strong and Davison Houses).|$|E
5|$|Late 20th-century {{technical}} examination has shown {{significant differences in}} technique and style between the panels of individual diptychs. The technical inconsistencies {{may be the result}} of the workshop system, in which the more prosaic passages were often completed by assistants. A change in style between panels can be seen, according to historian John Hand, because the divine panel was usually based on general designs sold on the open market, with <b>the</b> <b>donor</b> panel added after a patron was found.|$|E

5|$|The Tagora Présidence was {{a concept}} car {{designed}} by stylist Sunny Atri at the Talbot design studio in Whitley, Coventry. The concept {{was created to}} generate interest in employing high-end Tagoras as chauffeur-driven limousines by users such as business executives and government officials. <b>The</b> <b>donor</b> model for the Présidence was the 2.6 SX, which had an interior appointed with Connolly Leather upholstery and brass highlights, plus a host of electronics including a telephone, dictaphone, text-message receiver, and television with VCR. Originally valued at £25,000, the Présidence now resides at a car museum in Poissy.|$|E
5|$|The headdress is {{a variant}} of the {{truncated}} or bee-hive hennin, then fashionable at the Burgundian court. A very similar style, with no tail, is seen on the older of two girls in <b>the</b> <b>donor</b> panels of Presentation of Christ by the Master of the Prado Adoration of the Magi, a pupil of Rogier van der Weyden. The black band under the chin is rarely found in other images from the period, and has been interpreted as a style borrowed from the male chaperon hat, which always has a long tailing tail or cornette, sometimes worn wrapped under the chin in this way.|$|E
5|$|The {{work may}} have been {{intended}} for private devotion, perhaps as a portable altarpiece for a migrant cleric. That the frames are so richly decorated with Latin inscriptions indicates that <b>the</b> <b>donor,</b> whose identity is lost, was highly educated and cultured. Because {{of a lack of}} surviving documentary evidence on commissions of 15thcentury-Northern painting, the identities of donors are often established through evidence gathered by modern art historians. In this work, damaged coats of arms on the borders of the interior wings have been identified with the Giustiniani of Genoa– an influential albergo active from 1362– who established trade links with Bruges as early as the mid-14th century.|$|E

5|$|An {{entry level}} diver must learn the {{techniques}} of breathing underwater through a demand regulator, including clearing it of water and recovering it if dislodged from the mouth, and clearing the mask if it is flooded. These are critical survival skills, and if not competent the diver is at {{a high risk of}} drowning. A related skill is sharing breathing gas with another diver, both as <b>the</b> <b>donor</b> and the recipient. This is usually done with a secondary demand valve carried for this purpose. Technical and professional divers will also learn how to use a backup gas supply carried in an independent scuba set, known as the emergency gas supply or bailout cylinder.|$|E
5|$|Burnet was, however, {{unable to}} prove this experimentally. Peter Medawar, Rupert E. Billingham and Leslie Brent did find support for Burnet's {{hypothesis}} in 1953 when they showed that splenocytes could be engrafted by intravenous infusion into mice in utero or just after birth and that when these mice matured, they could accept skin and other tissues from <b>the</b> <b>donor</b> but not from any other mouse strain. Burnet and Medawar were co-recipients of the 1960 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for this work, as it provided the experimental basis for inducing immune tolerance, thereby allowing the transplantation of solid organs. Burnet and Medawar were able to coordinate their work effectively despite the rather different personalities and physical separation; Burnet was taciturn whereas Medawar was a young and urbane Englishman, but they greatly respected one another.|$|E
5|$|In this work, the {{inscriptions}} are in Roman capitals or Gothic miniature, and in {{some places}} seem to contain misspellings, making interpretation difficult. Its gold-lined frame and Latin inscriptions, with their subtle references to various passages in the two panels, indicate that <b>the</b> <b>donor</b> was wealthy and educated. The sides of each frame are lined with inscriptions from the Book of Isaiah (53:6–9, 12), Revelations (20:13, 21:3–4) or the Book of Deuteronomy (32:23–24). In the right hand panel, {{the wings of the}} figure of death contain Latin inscriptions on either side; on the left are the words CHAOS MAGNVM ("great chaos"), with UMBRA MORTIS ("shadow of death") inscribed to the right. A warning from Matthew 25:41 is written on both sides of death's head and wings, and extends from earth down into the hell section. It reads, Ite vos maledicti in ignem eternam ("Go, ye cursed, into everlasting fire"). In this way, van Eyck dramatically aligns the biblical extract in diagonal dual beams of light seemingly hurled from the heavens. Also in the section are letters reading ME OBVLIVI.|$|E
