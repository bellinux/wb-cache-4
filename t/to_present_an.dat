5|$|Gautier thought Heine's Wilis and Hugo's fifteen-year-old Spanish {{girl would}} make a good ballet story. His first idea was <b>to</b> <b>present</b> <b>an</b> empty ballroom {{glittering}} with crystal and candlelight. The Wilis would cast a spell over the floor. Giselle and other dancers would enter and whirl through the room, unable to resist the spell to keep them dancing. Giselle would try to keep her lover from partnering other girls. The Queen of the Wilis would enter, lay her cold hand on Giselle's heart and the girl would drop dead.|$|E
5|$|After {{the deal}} in Marysville fell through, ISC courted another site, this time south of Bremerton National Airport in Bremerton, WA just across Puget Sound from Seattle. Although like the Marysville {{proposal}} the proposal in Bremerton {{was to be}} partially funded with public money, the money will not come directly from taxes but instead from bonds funded by taxes, in a scheme {{similar to the one}} used to fund Kansas Speedway. Also like the Marysville proposal, the Bremerton track would be publicly owned and leased to ISC for three races per year. ISC's current proposal was met with a lukewarm response from area lawmakers and citizens, but the company has promised <b>to</b> <b>present</b> <b>an</b> improved offer for early 2007.|$|E

5|$|Henry was an intellectual. The first English king with {{a modern}} humanist education, he read and wrote English, French and Latin, and was {{thoroughly}} {{at home in}} his well-stocked library. He personally annotated many books and wrote and published one of his own. To promote the {{public support for the}} reformation of the church, Henry had numerous pamphlets and lectures prepared. For example, Richard Sampson's Oratio (1534) was an argument for absolute obedience to the monarchy and claimed that the English church had always been independent from Rome. At the popular level, theatre and minstrel troupes funded by the crown travelled around the land to promote the new religious practices: the pope and Catholic priests and monks were mocked as foreign devils, while the glorious king was hailed as a brave and heroic defender of the true faith. Henry worked hard <b>to</b> <b>present</b> <b>an</b> image of unchallengeable authority and irresistible power.|$|E
5|$|Impression Management {{is defined}} as when an {{individual}} attempts <b>to</b> <b>present</b> <b>an</b> acceptable image to those around him or her verbally or nonverbally (480). This definition is based on Goffman’s idea that individuals see themselves as others view them, so in essence they attempt {{to see themselves as}} if they are outside looking in (480). Goffman also dedicating this work to discover the subtle ways humans present acceptable images by concealing information that may conflict with the images for a particular situation. For instance, concealing tattoos when applying for a job in which tattoos would be inappropriate, or hiding a bizarre obsession such as collecting/interacting with dolls which society as a whole may see as abnormal.|$|E
5|$|It {{is likely}} that the castle evolved from the {{practice}} of fortifying a lordly home. The greatest threat to a lord's home or hall was fire as it was usually a wooden structure. To protect against this, and keep other threats at bay, there were several courses of action available: create encircling earthworks to keep an enemy at a distance; build the hall in stone; or raise it up on an artificial mound, known as a motte, <b>to</b> <b>present</b> <b>an</b> obstacle to attackers. While the concept of ditches, ramparts, and stone walls as defensive measures is ancient, raising a motte is a medieval innovation.|$|E

5|$|The Almost Nearly Perfect People: The Truth About the Nordic Miracle is a 2014 nonfiction book by the British {{journalist}} Michael Booth. In the book, Booth {{focuses on}} the five Nordic countries—Denmark, Iceland, Norway, Finland and Sweden—dedicating {{a section of the}} book to each one. He began writing the book after migrating from England to Denmark, based on his perceptions of the Nordic region before and after moving. He wanted <b>to</b> <b>present</b> <b>an</b> alternative perspective to the extremely positive depiction of the region in British media. The book received mixed reviews: some critics found it to be overly critical with poor humour, others praised its tone and informativeness.|$|E
5|$|The Danish foreign {{ministry}} reviewed the 348documents that the BBC obtained in 2001 under the Freedom of Information Act. In January 2009, foreign minister Per Stig Møller commissioned {{a study by}} the Danish Institute for International Studies (DIIS) to compare the 348 documents with 317 documents released by the Department of Energy in 1994 in order to determine if the 348 documents contained any new information about an intact nuclear weapon at Thule. In August 2009, DIIS published its report, which contradicted the assertions of the BBC. The report concluded that there was no missing bomb, and that the American underwater operation was a search for the uranium-235 of the fissile core of a secondary. For the first time, the report was able <b>to</b> <b>present</b> <b>an</b> estimate of the amount of plutonium contained in the pits of the primaries.|$|E

5|$|Shaw's major {{plays of}} {{the first decade of}} the twentieth century address {{individual}} social, political or ethical issues. Man and Superman (1902) stands apart from the others in both its subject and its treatment, giving Shaw's interpretation of creative evolution in a combination of drama and associated printed text. The Admirable Bashville (1901), a blank verse dramatisation of Shaw's novel Cashel Byron's Profession, focuses on the imperial relationship between Britain and Africa. John Bull's Other Island (1904), comically depicting the prevailing relationship between Britain and Ireland, was popular at the time but fell out of the general repertoire in later years. Major Barbara (1905) presents ethical questions in an unconventional way, confounding expectations that in the depiction of an armaments manufacturer on the one hand and the Salvation Army on the other the moral high ground must invariably be held by the latter. The Doctor's Dilemma (1906), a play about medical ethics and moral choices in allocating scarce treatment, was described by Shaw as a tragedy. With a reputation for presenting characters who did not resemble real flesh and blood, he was challenged by Archer <b>to</b> <b>present</b> <b>an</b> on-stage death, and here did so, with a deathbed scene for the anti-hero.|$|E
