40|$|In this work, {{the metal}} and slag phase mixing in {{three steps of}} a ladle {{refining}} operation of steel melts and for an oxygen balance during cooling of cast iron melts have been studied at two Swedish steel plants and at two Swedish cast iron foundries, respectively. In order to predict the oxygen activity in the steel bulk in equilibrium with the <b>top</b> <b>slag</b> {{as well as in}} metal droplets in the <b>top</b> <b>slag</b> in equilibrium with the <b>top</b> <b>slag,</b> three slag models were used. In addition, the assumptions of a sulphur-oxygen equilibrium between steel and slag and the dilute solution model for the liquid steel phase were utilized in the calculations. Measured oxygen activities in steel bulk, which varied between 3. 5 - 6 ppm, were compared to predicted oxygen activities. The differences between the predicted and measured oxygen activities were found to be significant (0 - 500 %) and the reasons for the differences are discussed in the thesis. Slag samples have been evaluated to determine the distribution of the metal droplets. The results show that the relatively largest numbers of metal droplets are present in the slag samples taken before vacuum degassing. Also, the projected interfacial area between steel bulk and <b>top</b> <b>slag</b> has been compared to the interfacial area between the metal droplets and slag. The results show that the droplet-slag interfacial area is 3 to 14 times larger than the flat projected interfacial area between the steel and <b>top</b> <b>slag.</b> Furthermore, the effect of the reactions between <b>top</b> <b>slag</b> and steel and the slag viscosity on the metal droplet formation is discussed. The results show significant differences between the steel bulk and steel droplet compositions and the reasons for the differences are discussed in the thesis. The oxygen activity in different cast irons was studied. Plant trials were performed at three occasions for lamellar, compacted and nodular iron melts. The results show that at temperatures close to the liquidus temperature the oxygen activities were 0. 03 - 0. 1 ppm for LGI, around 0. 02 ppm for CGI, and 0. 001 ppm for SGI. In addition, it was found that as the oxygen activities increased with time after an Mg treatment, the ability to form a compact graphite or a nodular graphite in Mg-treated iron melts was decreased. Also, extrapolated oxygen activity differences up to 0. 07 ppm were found for different hypoeutectic iron compositions for lamellar graphite iron at the liquidus temperature. Overall, the observed differences in the dissolved oxygen levels were believed to influence how graphite particles are incorporated into the austenite matrix and how the graphite morphology will be in the cast product.

40|$|The {{thesis is}} based on two {{supplements}} with two major objectives. In the first supplement equilibrium top slag-steel bulk and inclusions-steel bulk were investigated by comparison between calculated and measured oxygen activity values. This was done by applying different oxide activity models for slags combined with thermodynamic calculations. In the second supplement the inclusion composition is studied during the ladle refining process. The inclusion composition is related to <b>top</b> <b>slag</b> composition and other parameters during ladle treatment. The work {{was carried out by}} collecting data during well controlled sampling procedures at two different steel plants. Extensive inclusion analyses in Scanning Electron Microscope, SEM, were done. The data was used together with thermodynamics for a description of the interaction between slag-steel-inclusion interaction during ladle treatment. Evaluation of inclusion composition during the ladle refining have revealed {{that the majority of the}} inclusions belonged to the system Al 2 O 3 -CaO-MgO-SiO 2 and showed a continuous composition change throughout the ladle refining process, from high Al 2 O 3, via MgO-spinel to finally complex types rich in CaO and Al 2 O 3. The final composition after vacuum treatment was found to be close to the <b>top</b> <b>slag</b> composition. Small process parameter changes and practical variations during ladle refining were proven to give large differences of the inclusion composition. Finally, it was concluded that equilibrium does not exist between <b>top</b> <b>slag</b> and steel bulk, with respect to oxygen, for the studied conditions.

40|$|Today, {{there is}} a high demand on clean steel for high {{performance}} materialproperties. Thus, steel producers try to deliver a steel product with the highestquality and cleanliness to the market. The number of parameters that affect thesteel cleanliness may vary depending on the required material properties of thefinal product. However, the non-metallic inclusion characteristics represent one ofthe most important parameters. More specifically, the composition, size, numberand morphology affect steel cleanliness. In this work, selected parameters affectingthe inclusion characteristics were studied using the following methods: i) thermodynamic calculations (including computational thermodynamiccalculations), ii) inclusion determinations using a cross sectional (CS) method (2 Dinvestigations) and iii) inclusion determinations using an electrolytic extraction(EE) method (3 D investigations). The computational thermodynamic calculations of the slag-steel and inclusion-steelequilibriums were carried out using the Thermo-Calc software. With the help ofthese calculations, the influence of the slag carryover on the <b>top</b> <b>slag,</b> aluminumcontent in steel and sulfur distribution ratio as well as predictions of stable phasesof inclusions were studied. In addition, inclusion determinations of tool steel gradesamples collected during various stages of the ladle treatment in a scrap-based steelplant were carried out using both 2 D and 3 D methods. Furthermore, inclusiondeterminations of bearing steel grade samples from a runner system after ingotcasting were performed using a 2 D metallographic method (CS-method). Also, theINCAFeature software was used, when using cross sectional method, in order tocollect more statistics of the inclusion characteristics. It was found that slag carryover has a large influence on the composition of theactual <b>top</b> <b>slag</b> as well as the aluminum content in the steel as well as the sulfurdistribution ratio. In addition, steel and slag were found to be in “near”-equilibriumconditions, after the completion of the vacuum degassing operation.

Moreover, the composition of the large-size inclusions wasfound to be less scattered. Furthermore, closer to the <b>top</b> <b>slag</b> composition insamples collected after vacuum degassing. Finally, the accuracy of the inclusioncomposition determinations of tool steel samples using the electrolytic extractionmethod was found to be better than for the cross sectional method.

40|$|The {{cleanliness}} {{of steel}} {{with respect to}} non-metallic inclusions and the precise alloy compositions in the steel products have always been of great concern in steel making technology. The development of steel making process to meet the compositional requirements for specific mechanical properties such as ductility, toughness, fatigue and machinability requires dynamic and continuous investigations. The refining of molten steel in the ladle furnace to meet the required compositional range requires the optimisation of the process parameters. For sulphur removal control, parameters such as argon gas flow rate through the porous plugs, inductive stirring effect, vacuum pressure of the tank degasser, amount & composition of the <b>top</b> <b>slag</b> should be optimised. In this thesis project an investigation was carried out on {{the factors that influence}} the <b>top</b> <b>slag</b> composition before vacuum treatment and also to optimise the <b>top</b> <b>slag</b> composition for precise sulphur removal. 12 heats were followed during the project: slag samples, steel samples, temperature and oxygen activities were taken at eight different process stages at Ovako steel mill. A relatively large variation was observed for all the oxide components of the slag phase before vacuum treatment in all the heats followed. A PLS analysis made shows that topslag composition before degassing is influenced by the amount of slag former added, oxygen potential at tapping, the yield of Al and Si deoxidants into the steel at tapping. The model has a poor predictability because some important parameters such as ladle glaze condition, amount of EAF slag tapped and refractory wear could not be measured. An alternative solution of extra slag practice was suggested instead of modelling the composition and mass of carry over slag left after slag removal. The extra slag practice involves the addition of lime during tapping so as to aid the removal of all the slag before ladle refining and thus optimisation of the new synthetic slag for precise sulphur removal could be easily achieved. Finally the investigation of the desulphurisation process shows that degassing time, argon gas flow rate through the porous plugs are as well important as the slag mass and composition in order to achieve a precise sulphur removal.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} an {{increasing}} demand to reduce and control the amount of dissolved gases in steel. Hydrogen and nitrogen are two of the most important gases which when dissolved in liquid steel affect its properties significantly. Several steelmaking additions have been investigated in this research for their effect on the hydrogen and nitrogen content of steels. It has been established that calcium hydroxide (hydrated lime) acts as a source of hydrogen. Carburizers, such as metallurgical coke, were found to result in no hydrogen pickup when added to liquid steel. Addition of petroleum coke, on the other hand, increased the hydrogen content of liquid steel. Ferroalloy such as medium carbon ferromanganese when added to the liquid iron was found to increase its nitrogen content, the increase being proportional to the amount of ferroalloy added. Similarly, addition of pitch coke, which had a significant nitrogen impurity, increased the nitrogen content of liquid iron. A mathematical model was developed to quantify the absorption of nitrogen and hydrogen from the air bubbles entrained during tapping of liquid steel. During the bottom stirring of liquid metal in a ladle, the inert gas escaping from the <b>top</b> displaces the <b>slag</b> layer and often forms an open eye. The absorption of atmospheric nitrogen through the spout eye was estimated for different slag thickness and gas flow rate. The ultimate goal of this research was to develop a comprehensive set of equations which could predict the nitrogen and hydrogen pickup from their various sources. Estimates of hydrogen and nitrogen pickup during the steel transfer operations such as tapping and ladle stirring and the predicted pickup from steelmaking additions were integrated into empirical equations. The comprehensive model is designed to predict the gas pickup under varying operating conditions such as the metal oxygen and sulfur content, the total tapping or stirring time, the stirring gas flow rate and the slag thickness. The model predictions are based on mathematical and empirical evidence which are derived from thermodynamic and kinetic fundamental principles...|$|R
40|$|This {{study focused}} on the dynamic {{behaviour}} of the freeze lining and slag bath, and the interactions between these components in an ilmenite-smelting furnace process. The purpose of the work was {{to gain a better}} understanding of these issues and to ultimately contribute to an improved understanding of the ilmenite-smelting process in its entirety, and to future improvements in the design, operation and control of these processes. A mathematical model of the freeze lining and furnace sidewall was developed. This model was used in isolation for focused characterisation of the dynamic behaviour and interactions of the freeze lining and slag bath. The influences of net power input and slag composition were studied and various aspects of the freeze lining and slag bath were considered. These aspects included freeze lining thickness, temperature distribution through the freeze lining and furnace sidewall, composition distribution through the freeze lining, slag bath temperature and slag bath composition. The thermal response of thermocouples installed in the furnace sidewall to changing conditions on the inside of the furnace was also investigated. A mathematical model of the crust that forms on the slag bath surface was developed. This model was not used in isolation, and was only incorporated into a complete model of the process. A mathematical model of the entire ilmenite-smelting furnace process was constructed. This model incorporated the two models mentioned above and was able to describe the metal bath, slag bath, furnace atmosphere, freeze lining, furnace sidewall and the crust that is sometimes present on <b>top</b> of the <b>slag</b> bath. The model was used to study the influence of changes in operational parameters on the slag bath and freeze lining. The operational parameters that were studied included electrical power and reductant feed rate, both relative to ilmenite feed rate. The influence of severe operational errors and furnace down time were also investigated. Operational errors included loss of all feed while maintain electrical power input, and loss of reductant feed while maintaining power input and ilmenite feed. The above-mentioned studies were conducted by executing numerous experiments with two of the mathematical models. The experimental results were processed into sets of graphs displaying variations in the aspects that were considered. Many valuable insights resulted from the interpretation of these results. One specific aspect that formed part of the scope of this work was the origin of the compositional invariance of the slag close to the stoichiometric M 3 O 5 composition. This invariance was studied and a mechanism was proposed that explains the observed behaviour. The proposed mechanism created some questions about other mechanisms in the process. These mechanisms were also considered and elaborated on. The models and results produced in this study provide valuable insights into the behaviour of the ilmenite-smelting process. It also represents a useful foundation for future modelling work, and finally, it presents numerous opportunities for organisations operating ilmenite-smelting furnaces to improve their understanding and even the performance of their processes.

40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{possibility}} of prediction and modification {{of some of the}} physicochemical properties of non-metallic inclusions by considering top slag-steel-ladle equilibria in an ASEA-SKF ladle furnace. To test the reliability of an available computational thermodynamic computer program, the first sub project was done. It was concluded that LiMeS, an interface for Thermo-Calc, is a useful tool for slag-steel equilibrium calculations. The second sub project was set out to find some model/s that could calculate the most accurate oxygen activity of molten steel compared to the measured one. This study concluded that both Wagner’s and Turkdogan's equations are useful. It was further seen that increasing the Al contents in the molten steel, increasing the CaO/Al 2 O 3 ratio in the <b>top</b> <b>slag,</b> and reducing the temperature, resulted in reduction of the oxygen activity of the molten steel. In the third sub project a comparison was made between measured CaO and Al 2 O 3 (normalised to CaO-Al 2 O 3) in <b>top</b> <b>slag,</b> calcium aluminate inclusions, and the results of theoretical calculations. The average contents of CaO and Al 2 O 3 in all inclusions were close to the composition of the phase Ca 12 Al 14 O 33 and the contents of CaO and Al 2 O 3 in the slags were close to the composition of the phase Ca 3 Al 2 O 6 in the binary phase diagram of CaO-Al 2 O 3. The forth sub project set out to study the effect of vacuum degassing time on non-metallic inclusions. It was concluded that during the vacuum degassing process the share of calcium aluminates compared to spinels, Ca content of the oxides, and the average equivalent circle diameters of the oxides were increasing, and oxides tended to form spherical shapes.

However, there are numerous types of disposable samplers and no united standard for sampling. The goal in this study is to investigate the effect of slag protection type and sample geometry on sampling parameters and sample homogeneity. Three sample geometries were selected: i) Björneborg ii) Lollipop with a 6 mm thickness and iii) Lollipop with a 12 mm thickness. These sample geometries have been tested with two types of slag protection: metal-cap-protection and argon-protection. The filling velocity and solidification rate of steel samples have been experimentally measured during plant trials. The sample homogeneity with respect to total oxygen content and inclusion size distribution has been determined {{in different parts of the}} samples. The study shows that argon-protected samplers have lower, more even, filling velocities (0. 19 ± 0. 09 m/s) compared to metal-cap-protected samplers (1. 28 ± 2. 23 m/s). The solidification rate measurements of the different samplers show that the 6 mm thick Lollipop has the highest solidification rate (99 ~ 105 °C/s).  Measurements of total oxygen content in argon-protected samples showed little variation between different zones of the samples. However, metal-cap-protected samples contained much higher total oxygen contents. Light optical microscope studies showed that the increase in total oxygen content was probably caused by entrapment of <b>top</b> <b>slag</b> during sampling. Furthermore, it was found that the contamination of <b>top</b> <b>slag</b> in the metal samples increased with a decreased sample weight.

40|$|Slag fuming is a reductive {{treatment}} {{process for}} molten zinciferous slags for extracting zinc {{in the form}} of metal vapour by injecting or adding a reductant source such as pulverized coal or lump coal and natural gas. The process has been operative since 1930 ’s for recovering zinc from lead blast furnace slag. Though slag fuming is a well-established process and has been industrially operative for over eighty years, there is only limited understanding of the process kinetics and fluid flow behaviour inside the slag fuming furnace. The {{purpose of this study is}} detailed fluid dynamic analysis including combustion behaviour, gas-liquid momentum interaction, generation of splashing due to gas injection process in slag fuming furnace, analysis of fuming behaviour at different locations of the furnace by using computational fluid dynamic (CFD) modelling technique. This PhD thesis focuses on the Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) modelling study of the zinc slag fuming process. In the first stage of the present research, a Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) modelling study of the Top Submerged Lance (TSL) gas injection process was carried out in a laboratory scale isothermal air-water model. The multiphase flow simulation, based on Euler-Euler approach, elucidated the effect of swirl and non-swirl flow inside the bath. The effects of lance submergence level and air flow rate were also investigated in that phase. The simulation results for velocity fields and generation of turbulence in the bath were validated against existing experimental data from the previous water model experimental study of Morsi et al. [1]. In the next stage of the research, a Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) model of the pilot plant scale <b>top</b> submerged lance <b>slag</b> fuming furnace was developed to investigate details of fluid flow, combustion behaviour, reaction kinetics and heat transfer in the furnace. The model integrates submerged CH 4 combustion at the lance tip and chemical reactions with the heat, mass and momentum interfacial interaction between the phases present in the system. Commercial CFD package AVL Fire 2009. 2 (AVL, Graz, Austria) coupled with a number of user defined subroutines in FORTRAN programming language were used to develop the model. The model is based on 3 -D Eulerian multiphase flow approach and it predicted the velocity and temperature field of the molten slag bath, generated turbulence, vortex and plume shape at the lance tip. The model also predicted the mass fractions of slag and gaseous components inside the furnace. The model was validated by adopting the macro – step validation approach by using the zinc fuming rate against the pilot plant scale experimental study on top submerged lance zinc fuming process carried out by Waladan et al. [2]. Finally, the developed CFD model for TSL furnace was extended for submerged coal combustion instead of CH 4 combustion and applied to a conventional tuyere blown slag fuming furnace. The model considered a thin slice of a conventional tuyere blown slag fuming furnace consisting two opposing set of tuyere. The model was developed in Eulerian multiphase flow approach by employing 3 D hybrid unstructured orthographic grid system. The aim was to investigate details of fluid flow, submerged coal combustion dynamics, coal utilization behaviour, jet penetration behaviour, bath interaction conditions and generation of turbulence in the bath. The model was developed by coupling the CFD with the kinetics equations developed by Richards et al. for a zinc slag fuming furnace. The model predicted the velocity, temperature field of the molten slag bath, generated turbulence and vortex, coal utilization behaviour from the slag bath.

40|$|A {{fundamental}} {{study of}} the Direct Current Electric Arc Furnace (DC-EAF) for steel-making {{has been carried out}} through the development of a rigorous mathematical model. The mathematical representation involves the simultaneous solution of Maxwell's equations for the electromagnetic fields, and the turbulent fluid flow and heat transfer equations. In solving the arc and bath regions it was assumed (and justified) that the arc-bath interactions are dominated by the behavior of the arc. In contrast to previous modeling investigations, this work relaxes some critical assumptions and provides a more realistic and comprehensive representation of the system. This work also examines and compares the relative merits of alternative electromagnetic and turbulence formulations, and addresses the role of induced currents and compressibility effects in the representation of the arc. Furthermore, due allowance was made to represent and analyze the effect of gas injection, the presence of a slag layer in the bath and changes in anode configuration {{at the bottom of the}} reactor. Because of a lack of experimental information on actual or pilot plant DC-EAF systems, different aspects of the model were validated using several sources of experimental data reported in the literature for related systems. These included measurements on welding arcs, laboratory scale high-intensity carbon arcs, electromagnetically driven metallic systems, and ladle metallurgy physical models. It was found that, in general, the agreement between measurements and predictions was good. A detailed analysis was carried out to examine the effect of process parameters (e. g., arc current, arc length, bath dimensions, anode arrangements, etc) on the behavior of the furnace (e. g., heat transfer to the bath, heating efficiency, mixing times in the bath, etc). Predictions from the arc model show that all the arc characteristics are strongly coupled and that the arc physics is governed by the expansion of the arc. From a parametric study it was found that when the arc region (defined by the 10, 000 K isotherm) is plotted in dimensionless form, a universal shape for the arc can be defined, regardless of the values of arc current or arc length. This universality was restricted to the range of conditions analyzed in this thesis, to arcs struck between graphite cathodes in air, and does not include the jet impingement region on the bath surface. This common arc expansion behavior suggested the universal nature of other arc characteristics. Universal maps of temperature, magnetic: flux density, and axial velocity are also reported in terms of simple analytical expressions. The practical effects of the two main process parameters of the arc region,. i. e. the arc current and the arc length, were analyzed. It was found that increasing the arc length significantly increases the arc resistance and, consequently, the arc power, although this behavior reached asymptotic values at larger arc lengths. Increasing the arc current, however, does not affect the arc voltage. Thus, it is found that increasing the arc power increases the amount of energy transferred into the bath, but the heat transfer efficiency decreases. Therefore, the shorter the arc the more efficient is the heat transfer to the bath. It is also recognized that heat transfer from the arc to the bath is controlled by convection, although radiation can become an important mechanism, especially for large arc lengths. Results of the bath model indicate that, in the absence of inert gas stirring and with no slag present in the system, electromagnetic body forces dominate and are responsible for the fluid flow patterns in the system. The effects of the arc determine the distributions of temperature and other mixing characteristics in the bath. The bath model was used to evaluate the effect of the main process parameters and design variables on mixing, refractory wear, temperature stratification, and heat transfer efficiency. An increase in the arc length is detrimental to mixing but increases the rate of heating in the melt as a result of the increased arc power. Increasing arc current improves mixing and the heat transferred to the bath, but is likely to be detrimental to the life of the bottom refractory. The results also suggest that high furnace aspect ratios (taller and thinner arc furnaces) are highly recommended because an increase in the aspect ratio increases mixing, prevents refractory wear, and promotes arc heating efficiency. The arc configuration in the furnace can be changed to control fluid flow patterns in the bath to meet specific needs, such as better mixing, or to prevent refractory wear. The presence of a <b>top</b> layer of <b>slag</b> reduces mixing and increases overall liquid temperatures. Injection of gases through the bottom in eccentric operations generates complex flow patterns that improve mixing in regions away from the symmetry axis. It is the author's belief that this model is a useful tool for process analysis in the DC-EAF. It has the capability to address many issues of current and future concern and represents one component of a fundamental approach to the optimization of DC-EAF operations. by Marco Aurelio Ramírez.

40|$|The ladle {{treatment}} of a 18 pct Cr- 9 pct Ni stainless steel, with desulfurization as its main purpose, was simulated on a laboratory scale. The influence of the <b>top</b> <b>slag</b> chemistry on the steel cleanliness was evaluated. A higher steel cleanliness was obtained with an optimized lime-alumina-based slag than with a lime-fluorspar-based slag. The inclusions {{were found to be}} mainly in the form of oxysulfide; the alumina content in the inclusions first increased and subsequently showed a slow drop, while the sulfide content decreased during the treatment. The equilibrium between steel and inclusions was found to be more easily reached than that between slag and steel. A slag–steel kinetic model was used to predict the steel chemistry evolution during the treatment. Furthermore, a slag–steel–inclusions interaction kinetic model was developed to calculate the change of alumina content in the inclusions during the {{ladle treatment}}. The sulfide content of inclusions was also calculated and compared with the measured values. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The high {{temperature}} microstructure {{of the solid}} phases within the electric arc furnace (EAF) slag has a large effect on the process features such as foamability of the slag, chromium recovery, consumption of the ferroalloys and the wear rate of the refractory. The knowledge of the microstructural and compositional evolution of the slag phases during the EAF process stages is necessary for a good slag praxis. In supplement 1, {{an investigation of the}} typical characteristics of EAF slags in the production of the AISI 304 L stainless steel was carried out. In addition, compositional and microstructural evolution of the slag during the different EAF process stages was also investigated. Computational thermodynamics was also used as a tool to predict the equilibrium phases in the <b>top</b> <b>slag</b> as well as the amount of these phases at the process temperatures. Furthermore, the influence of different parameters (MgO wt%, Cr 2 O 3 wt%, temperature and the <b>top</b> <b>slag</b> basicity) on the amount of the spinel phase in the slag was studied. In supplement 2, a novel study to characterize the electric arc furnace (EAF) slags in the production of duplex stainless steel at the process temperatures was performed. The investigation was focused on determining the microstructural and compositional evolution of the EAF slag during {{and at the end of}} the refining period. Slag samples were collected from 14 heats of AISI 304 L steel (2 slag samples per heat) and 7 heats of duplex steel (3 slags sample per heat). Simultaneously with each slag sampling, the temperature of the slag was measured. The selected slag samples were studied both using SEM-EDS and LOM. In some cases (supplement 2), X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses were also performed on fine-powdered samples to confirm the existence of the observed phases. It was observed that at the process temperature and at all process stages, the stainless steel EAF slag consists mainly of liquid oxides, magnesiochromite spinel particles and metallic droplets. Under normal operation and at the final stages of the EAF, 304 L steelmaking slag contains 2 - 6 wt% magnesiochromite spinel crystals. It was also found that, within the compositional range of the slag samples, the only critical parameter affecting the amount of solid spinel particles in the slag is the chromium oxide content. Petrographical investigation of the EAF duplex stainless steelmaking showed that, before FeSi-addition, the slag samples contain large amounts of undissolved particles and the apparent viscosity of the slag is higher, relative to the subsequent stages. In this stage, the slag also includes solid stoichiometric calcium chromite. It was also found that, after FeSi-injection into the EAF and during the refining period, the composition and the basicity of the slag in the EAF duplex steelmaking and EAF stainless steelmaking are fairly similar. This indicates that, during the refining period, the basic condition for the utilization of an EAF foaming-slag praxis, in both austenitic and duplex stainless steel cases, is the same. Depending on the slag basicity, the slag may contain perovskite and/or dicalcium silicate too. More specifically, the duplex stainless steel slag samples with a higher basicity than 1. 55 found to contain perovskite crystals. QC 2011041...|$|E

The results for each heat have been evaluated {{in relation to the}} theory from the literaturesurvey and suggestions for changes in the process {{to reduce the amount of}} inclusions whichhave a negative effect on the steel quality have been given. The project extends over a large process where many parameters affect the formation ofinclusions. However, a tendency that a higher addition of alloys seems to increase the totalamount of inclusions before and after the vacuum degassing is seen. The majority of the studied inclusions seem to approach the composition of the <b>top</b> <b>slag</b> aftervacuum degassing. Ladle glaze may cause the inclusions which had a different compositioncompared to that of the slag. A high or low ladleage together with a high argon flow during vacuum degassing seems todissolve particles from the refractory which later on get trapped inside the inclusions. The floatation for two heats has been studied where a short floatation seems to give a higheramount of inclusions in casted material. In machined material so called stringers were found. The main composition of those stringerswas pure alumina. Inclusions with a composition of pure alumina were not found in the liquidsteel, thus the pure alumina inclusions must be formed during the casting.

40|$|The {{interaction}} mechanisms {{between a}} pitch-bonded MgO-C refractory and an Al 2 O 3 rich (similar to 15 wt%) stainless steelmaking slag were investigated by rotating finger tests {{in a vacuum}} induction furnace. A porous MgO layer (instead of a dense MgO layer) was observed at the hot face of the MgO-C bricks. This implies that under the present low oxygen pressure conditions, the oxygen supply from the slag is insufficient {{to meet the demand}} of reoxidising the entire amount of Mg vapor generated from the MgO-C reaction to form a fully dense MgO layer. A Mg(Al,Cr) (2) O- 4 spinel layer with zoning was found at the slag/brick interface in the <b>top</b> <b>slag</b> zone specimen of Test 3 (CHS 3). Based on the thermodynamic analyses with and experimental data, a mechanism of Mg(Al,Cr) (2) O- 4 spinel formation is proposed. Initially, hot face periclase grains take up Cr 2 O 3, and to a much lesser extent, Al 2 O 3 from the slag. The further diffusion of Cr 2 O 3 and Al 2 O 3 from the slag establishes a spinel layer of three distinct compositions of the type MgAl 2 (1 -x) Cr 2 xO 4, With x decreasing when moving from the interior to the exterior spinel layer. Due to the low oxygen pressures, the thermodynamically less stable, dissolved Cr 2 O 3 in the hot face periclase decomposes and forms chromium-rich metal droplets. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The overall {{purpose of}} this thesis work has been to further our {{understanding}} of the growth and removal of inclusions in gas- and induction-stirred ladles. The primary focus has been on alumina inclusions. Growth mechanisms were studied using data from fundamental mathematical models of gas- and induction-stirred ladles. The results showed the turbulence mechanism to be the most dominant in alumina inclusion growth. The dynamic growth and removal of inclusions in a gas-stirred ladle was studied using mathematical modelling. The model results showed concentration gradients of inclusions. The effect was most obvious in the steel flow past the removal sites: <b>top</b> <b>slag,</b> ladle refractory, and gas plume (bubble flotation). A new removal model was developed for large spherical caps bubbles. In order to verify the predicted concentration gradients for the size population of inclusions, three experiments were carried out in production. The sampling equipment enabled sampling at five different positions and different locations at the same time. The results showed that concentration gradients of inclusions do exist both in induction-stirred and gas-stirred ladles. A theoretical analysis showed that the drag force on the inclusions to be the dominating force and that therefore inclusions follow the fluid flow. The cluster behaviour of alumina inclusions were examined on steel samples taken in an industrial-scale deoxidation experiment in a ladle. The samples were examined by microscope and the results used to study cluster growth. It was found that there was rapid cluster growth due to collision during stirring and {{that at the end of}} the deoxidation experiment a majority of the small inclusions were bound in clusters. The cluster growth data determined using the microscopic results were compared with predicted cluster-growth data. A method was developed for converting the experimental data observed per unit area into data given per unit volume and vice versa. An expression for the collision diameter of the cluster was also developed. The results showed that the predicted cluster growth agreed well with the microscopic observations for the assumptions made in the growth model...|$|E
40|$|The {{growth and}} removal of {{inclusions}} in stirred ladles hasbeen studied. First, {{the importance of}} different growthmechanisms suggested in the literature were studied. Simulationresults from a fundamental model of an induction-stirred ladlehave been used as input in the calculations. Based on thegrowth calculations {{it was concluded that}} four of the growthmechanisms need not to be considered since they contribute solittle: i) diffusion of oxygen and aluminum to the inclusionsurface, ii) diffusion coalescence, iii) Brown motioncollision, and iv) laminar shear collision. The majorcontributor to inclusion growth is turbulent collision. Growthdue to Stoke's collisions is also somewhat important if largedifferences among inclusion sizes exist. Growth of inclusions in gas stirred ladles was studied usinga similar approach as the one for induction stirred ladles, butwith use of simulation results from a fundamental mathematicalmodel of a gas-stirred ladle. Similarly to what was found inthe case of induction stirring, it was found that turbulentcollisions and Stokes collisions appeared to be the majormechanisms for inclusion growth. The contribution of laminarshear collisions to growth was deemed negligible compared tothat of turbulent collisions. For the gas stirred ladle different removal mechanisms werealso studied, based on input data from a mathematical model ofa gas-stirred ladle. It was found that different modelssuggested to predict the inclusion removal due to bubbleflotation gave very different results. Also, all models assumeda spherical shape of the gas bubbles, which was found to beless realistic. Therefore, a new model for inclusion removal byspherical cap bubble flotation was developed. In the newcalculations, the most important mechanisms of inclusionremoval were found to be removal to the <b>top</b> <b>slag</b> and removal bybubble flotation, assuming spherical-cap bubbles and planecontact. When the bubbles were assumed to be spherical,resulting removal rates were lower than when they were assumedto be spherical caps. Based on these results it is concludedthat {{more research is needed to}} obtain a better understandingof the importance of bubble flotation on inclusion removal. Experiments are clearly needed to determine which modelconcepts produce predictions in best agreement withcorresponding data from actual steelmaking processes. NR 2014080...|$|E
40|$|A {{theoretical}} and experimental analysis {{is carried out}} to estimate the rate of MnO reduction when manganese ore is injected into liquid steel with three carbon contents, 0. 5, 1. 0 and 2. 0 mass % at 1600 °C. It is assumed {{that there are two}} reaction zones along the flux injection operation: a transitory reaction between the rising particles and the bulk metal, and the permanent reaction between the metal and the <b>top</b> <b>slag.</b> The experiments were carried out in an open 10 kg induction furnace using A 1203 refractory. The results show that the transitory reaction plays a more important role in the powder injection process than the permanent reaction. The reduction of MnO with silicon is more important when the basicity of the slag is high; this is because the aSi 02 decreases as the slag basicity is increased. However, when the slag basicity is low and the initial carbon content in steel is high the reduction of MnO with silicon becomes less efficient, although silicon still remains better reducing agent than carbon. En este trabajo se realiza un estudio, teórico y experimental, para determinar la velocidad de reducción de MnO inyectado dentro de acero líquido con contenidos de carbono de 0, 5, 1, 0 y 2, 0 % masa, a 1. 600 °C. El modelo considera que se establecen dos zonas de reacción: la transitoria, que se produce entre las partículas inyectadas y el metal líquido, y la permanente, que tiene lugar en la interfase entre el metal y la escoria. Los experimentos se llevaron a cabo en un horno de inducción de 10 kg de capacidad con refractario de alta alúmina. Los resultados muestran que la reacción transitoria produce una mayor reducción de MnO que la reacción permanente. La reducción de MnO con silicio es más importante cuando la basicidad de la escoria es elevada debido a que se disminuye la aSi 02. Para una basicidad baja y un alto contenido de carbono en el baño, la eficiencia de la reducción de MnO con silicio disminuye, aunque el silicio sigue siendo mejor reductor que el carbono...|$|E
40|$|The present thesis {{focuses on}} the {{interaction}} between refractory and liquid steel. The aim of this work is to understand the interaction behavior between refractory and liquid steel regarding steel cleanliness. The effect of different refractories on different inclusions in Al-killed steel was studied in a furnace. The sintering mechanism of filler sand were also investigated in laboratory. In the industrial trials, the attachments of different oxides {{on the walls of}} submerged entry nozzle (SEN) were discussed in the cases of high strength low alloy steel (HSLA) and ultra-low carbon steel (ULC). It is found that the effect of alumina and spinel refractory on all the three types of inclusions is very little, while MgO refractory influences the inclusions depending on the activity of dissolved oxygen in liquid steel. At low oxygen level, alumina inclusions could transform into spinel inclusions with the help of MgO refractory, while the effect on spinel and calcium aluminate inclusions is not evident. On the other hand, when the activity of dissolved oxygen is high enough, the evolution of spinel inclusions from alumina inclusions could not be seen. The reaction between chromite and silica grains leading to liquid formation is the main mechanism for the sintering of filler sand. The factors viz. steel composition, silica size and content, operation temperature and process holding time have a strong influence on the sintering of the filler sand. Smaller size and higher content of silica in sand, steel grades containing higher Mn and Al contents, higher temperature and longer holding time would result in serious sintering. The choice of the sand needs to take those factors into account. The results show that solid alumina particles are always agglomerated on the inner wall of SEN in the case of ULC steel. The <b>top</b> <b>slag</b> with high FeO and MnO contents is considered as the main reason of this kind of attachments. The removal of slag might be a good method to avoid the attachments. In the case of HSLA steel, liquid calcium aluminate inclusions could attach on the inner wall of SEN as well. The smoothness of the inner wall of the SEN holds the key of liquid attachments. In addition, the attachment situation on the outer wall of SEN depends on the operations. The oxygen entrainment through the mold powder would result in the formation of plate-like alumina attachments. The control of reoxidation due to oxygen entrainment would help to avoid this situation. QC 20160816 </p...|$|E
40|$|During the {{steelmaking}} process samples {{are taken from}} the liquid steel, mainly to assess the chemical composition of the steel. Recently, methods for rapid determination of inclusion characteristics (size and composition) have progressed to the level {{where they can be}} implemented in process control. Inclusions in steel can have either good or detrimental effects depending on their characteristics (size, number, composition and morphology). Thereby, by determination of the inclusion characteristics during the {{steelmaking process}} it is possible to steer the inclusion characteristics in order to increase the quality of the steel. However, in order to successfully implement these methods it is critical that the samples taken from the liquid steel represent the inclusion characteristics in the liquid steel at the sampling moment.   The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate the changes in inclusion characteristics during the liquid steel sampling process. Experimental studies were carried out at steel plants to measure filling velocity and solidification rate in real industrial samples. The sampling conditions for three sample geometries and two slag protection types were determined. Furthermore, the dispersion of the total oxygen content in the samples was evaluated as a function of sample geometry and type of slag protection. In addition, the effects of cooling rate as well as oxygen and sulfur content on the inclusion characteristics were investigated in laboratory and industrial samples. Possibilities to separate primary (existing in the liquid steel at sampling moment) and secondary (formed during cooling and solidification) inclusions depending on size and composition were investigated. Finally, in order to evaluate the homogeneity and representative of the industrial samples the dispersion of inclusion characteristics in different zones and layers of the samples were investigated.   It was concluded that the type of slag protection has a significant effect on the filling velocity and the sampling repeatability. Furthermore, that the thickness of the samples is the main controlling factor for the solidification rate. It was shown that <b>top</b> <b>slag</b> can contaminate the samples. Therefore, the choice of slag protection type is critical to obtain representative samples. It was shown that the cooling rate has a significant effect on the number of secondary precipitated inclusions. However, the number of primary inclusions was almost constant and independent on the cooling rate. In most cases it is possible to roughly separate the secondary and primary oxide inclusions based on the particle size distributions. However, in high-sulfur steels a significant amount of sulfides precipitate heterogeneously during cooling and solidification. This makes separation of secondary and primary inclusions very difficult. Moreover, the secondary sulfides which precipitate heterogeneously significantly change the characteristics (size, composition and morphology) of primary inclusions. The study revealed that both secondary and primary inclusions are heterogeneously dispersed in the industrial samples. In general, the middle zone of the surface layer is recommended for investigation of primary inclusions.  QC 2010111...|$|E
40|$|To keep up {{with the}} tough {{competition}} today {{and to be able to}} offer the customers competitive prices, it is desirable to shorten the ladle treatment and still keep a high quality of the product. To be able to shorten the ladle treatment under these restrictions, faster deoxidation process is demanded. This master’s thesis investigates what influences the reaction coefficient, which describes the separation rate of oxygen. A higher reaction coefficient indicates a fast separation rate. Special attention has been taken to the factor reoxidation, with regard to the nitrogen pick up after tapping and an increase of the oxygen content after degassing. The reaction coefficient has been calculated for four steel groups, two silicon deoxidised groups, one silicon and aluminium deoxidised group and one aluminium deoxidised steel group. The apparent deoxidation is in the reality the sum of two phenomena: deoxidation and reoxidation. An increase of the deoxidation rate or a decrease of the reoxidation rate would result in a higher k-value. A small increase of the reaction coefficient could gain minutes in the process of oxygen removal, which would result in economical benefits. The deoxidisers have naturally a strong effect on the oxygen content and thus on the reaction coefficient. The fastest separation – highest reaction coefficient – after tapping is found for steel groups deoxidised with the strongest deoxidiser: aluminium. Reoxidation occurs after tapping/before degassing due to the breakthrough eye caused by the strong gas injection. By using nitrogen as a tracer for reoxdiation from the atmosphere it was possible to determine if reoxidation had an effect on the deoxidation rate, which it had since the reaction coefficient decreases as the nitrogen content increases. Stirring makes deoxidation quicker, but on the other hand, too intensive stirring retards the deoxidation rate somewhat due to reoxidation. An optimisation of the gas flow rate might be useful to get an optimum relation between deoxidation and reoxdiation, where the fastest separation of oxides is achieved. The deoxidisers have an effect on the oxygen content after degassing and in the tundish. Reoxidation can occur during these time steps too, but most probably not due to reactions with the atmosphere, since the nitrogen content is stable. The oxygen content increases for the silicon deoxidised heats after degassing due to a higher iron oxide content in the <b>top</b> <b>slag.</b> Thus, the FeO content in the slag is too high to keep the low oxygen content in the steel stable. The heats with higher amount of deoxidisers in the steel tend to be able to stay at a lower oxygen concentration too. Though, in the later parts of the process additional alumina formation should be avoided for the best separation. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|E
40|$|Manganese-containing oxysulphides {{can be used}} to {{minimise}} the {{detrimental effects}} of oxide inclusions and to improve mechanical properties of steel products, like ductility, fatigue strength and machinability. The effective utilization of Mn-containing oxysulphide inclusions requires an accurate control on their characteristics, e. g. chemistry, microstructure, size distribution and morphology. Therefore a deep understanding of their formation and behaviour during desulphurisation, deoxidation and alloying is necessary for a complete manipulation of Mn-containing oxysulphide inclusions. In {{the first part of the}} research, the desulphurisation and inclusion behaviour of stainless steel refining were investigated by using CaO-Al 2 O 3 based top slags. Although a relatively lower sulphide capacity was obtained for an optimised CaO-Al 2 O 3 slag (50 % CaO, 40. 4 % Al 2 O 3, 4. 3 % SiO 2, 2. 1 % Fe 2 O 3, 1. 7 % TiO 2 and 0. 6 % MgO) compared to current CaO-SiO 2 -CaF 2 slag, an equivalent desulphurisation efficiency and an improved steel cleanliness were obtained with this optimised CaO-Al 2 O 3 slag. Based on these results, the substitution of current CaO-CaF 2 based slag with CaO-Al 2 O 3 based slag for stainless steel refining was discussed and evaluated. In the second part of the work, the interfacial reaction between molten steel and Mn/FeMnSi alloys at the early stages of deoxidation/alloying were studied with a metal suction method. A layer of Fe solidified around the cold alloy immediately after alloy addition. While enclosed by this Fe shell, the alloy was partially molten due to its low melting temperature. The oxysulphide inclusions were formed at the Mn-rich side of the interface, while an inclusion free zone was detected in the Fe-rich side close to the interface. Based on experimental findings and theoretical calculations, the mechanisms governing the Fe/Mn (or Fe/FeMnSi) interdiffusion and the inclusion free zone formation were proposed. Steel alloying, such as Mn, Al, FeSi and FeMn additions to the liquid steel with different oxygen and sulphur content was also simulated with a confocal scanning laser microscope combined with a special addition device. The effects of the sulphur and oxygen content in liquid iron, as well as that of the deoxidant type on the formation of oxides/oxysulphides were investigated. The inclusion behaviour on the liquid iron surface, i. e. the interaction after inclusion formation, the dissolution during the high temperature iso-thermal holding and growth during the cooling were observed. This part of the work contributes to the optimisation (or manipulation) of deoxidation/alloying operations to control the formation and characteristics of Mn-containing inclusions.
