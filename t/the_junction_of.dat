5|$|All of Midler Avenue, {{including}} {{the portion of}} the street not currently part of NY598 in DeWitt, was originally designated as NY433 in the early 1950s. At the time, NY433 ended at <b>the</b> <b>junction</b> <b>of</b> Midler Avenue and Court Street Road (then NY298). By 1954, New Court Avenue, an east–west connector between NY298 and NY433 in DeWitt, was designated as NY436. In the late 1950s, construction began on a bypass of Court Street that extended from the western terminus of NY436 in Salina to <b>the</b> <b>junction</b> <b>of</b> NY298 and Thompson Road (modern NY635) in DeWitt. The bypass was opened to traffic as a realignment of NY298 by 1961. NY433 was then extended northeastward along NY298's former routing on Court Street to Carrier Circle, where it met the realigned NY298.|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{we attempt}} to {{experimentally}} {{address the question of}} whether p,p′-dimercaptoazobisbenzene (DMAB) can be produced from p-aminothiophenol (PATP) by surface photochemistry reaction in <b>the</b> <b>junctions</b> <b>of</b> a Ag nanoparticle-molecule-Ag (or Au) film. First, utilizing surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectra, we provide experimental and theoretical evidence that DMAB can be produced from PATP by surface photochemistry reaction in <b>the</b> <b>junctions</b> <b>of</b> a Ag nanoparticle-molecule-Ag film. Second, we investigate the SERS spectra utilizing both experimental and theoretical approaches, ultimately revealing that DMAB cannot be produced from PATP in <b>the</b> <b>junctions</b> <b>of</b> a Ag nanoparticle-molecule-Au film. The electromagnetic enhancements are estimated with three-dimensional finite-difference time domain methods, which are about 9 × 105 times in <b>the</b> <b>junctions</b> <b>of</b> Ag nanoparticle-PATP-Ag/Au films. 1...|$|R

5|$|As well as {{the above}} sites, several {{domestic}} sites existed within Cheadle Hulme. These provided sleeping, eating and washing facilities for the Airmen and women stationed at RAF Handforth. Grove Lane park {{was the site of}} an Officers' mess, Cinema, NAAFI, Post Office, chapel and bath house among other buildings. The Grove, near <b>the</b> <b>junction</b> <b>of</b> Grove Lane and Pingate Lane, was Nissen hut accommodation, as were the flats on Gillbent Road opposite the shops and the large field at <b>the</b> <b>junction</b> <b>of</b> Longsight Lane and Stanley Road.

5|$|In 1908, the New York State Legislature created Route20, an {{unsigned}} legislative route {{extending from}} Elbridge to Rochester via Fairport. Initially, Route20 entered the village on High Street and followed Main Street south across the Erie Canal to Church Street, where it turned west toward Rochester. On March1, 1921, Route20 was realigned to enter Monroe County on modern NY31. At <b>the</b> <b>junction</b> <b>of</b> Palmyra and Moseley Roads, Route20 turned north, following SH1290 into Fairport. It rejoined its original alignment at <b>the</b> <b>junction</b> <b>of</b> Church and Main Streets. None of SH1290 received a signed designation {{when the first}} set of posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924.|$|E

5|$|The {{decline of}} heavy {{industry}} in the 20th century left Windy Nook with no major employer and there was little {{in terms of economic}} activity. There is no major commercial area and residents usually travel to neighbouring Felling town centre to shop or use the small shopping area at <b>the</b> <b>junction</b> <b>of</b> Windy Nook Road and Carr Hill Road/Albion Street. However, in November 2011, planning permission was approved for conversion of the Black House Inn at <b>the</b> <b>junction</b> <b>of</b> Carr Hill Road and Coldwell lane into a 'Tesco Extra' store. The approval was granted in spite of complaints and concerns as to noise and traffic being raised by local residents.

40|$|Segmental duplications of the basilar artery, {{previously}} reported exclusively as anatomical variations, owe their clinical {{interest to the}} possible association with aneurysms localized at <b>the</b> <b>junctions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fenestrated segments. The morphological characteristics of 5 cases of basilar artery segmental duplication without aneurysms, found at autopsy, are reported. In 3 <b>of</b> these <b>the</b> proximal <b>junction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fenestrated segment was studied with scanning electron microscopy and morphometry. In all cases the tunica media of the medial wall of the 2 branches showed a progressive thinning towards <b>the</b> <b>junctions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fenestrated segments and a small muscular gap at their apex. The limited medial defect might be embryologically ascribed to {{the persistence of the}} morphological individuality of the tunica media of the 2 branches {{at the point where the}} fusion of the primitive longitudinal neural arteries stopped. The review of the literature shows that <b>the</b> morphology <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>junctions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fenestrated segments is in conformity with that of the intracranial arterial bifurcations. For this reason the basilar artery fenestration exposes to the blood flow a new distal bifurcation where the same etiologic factors that are still under discussion in the origin of saccular intracranial aneurysms may be active...|$|R
