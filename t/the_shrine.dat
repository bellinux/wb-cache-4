5|$|<b>The</b> <b>shrine</b> was {{adorned with}} gold, silver and {{precious}} stones. In 1339, three London goldsmiths were employed {{for a whole}} year to rebuild <b>the</b> <b>shrine</b> to a higher standard. William Dugdale records that <b>the</b> <b>shrine</b> was pyramidal in shape with an altar table placed in front for offerings.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, {{security}} for <b>the</b> <b>Shrine</b> {{has been provided}} by <b>the</b> <b>Shrine</b> Guard, whose members were men with a military background. All of the original twelve members of <b>the</b> <b>Shrine</b> Guard had won bravery medals during World War I. When <b>the</b> <b>Shrine</b> Guard merged with the Victoria Police Protective Service, some civilians began to serve. During the hours <b>the</b> <b>Shrine</b> {{is open to the}} public or in use for any ceremony, they wear a uniform representing an Australian Light Horseman of World War I, with Victoria Police Force insignia.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>shrines</b> {{are opened}} {{again for the}} second arti (Shangar Arti). <b>The</b> <b>shrines</b> remain open from 9:00am to {{approximately}} 11:00am, when <b>the</b> <b>shrines</b> are closed and offered thal (food for lunch).At 11.45am, <b>the</b> <b>shrines</b> are opened for the midday arti (Rajbhog Arti), and the thal (offering hymn) is recited before <b>the</b> Deities. <b>The</b> <b>shrines</b> are closed after this to allow the Deities to rest during the afternoon.|$|R
5000|$|The rite {{is held in}} two <b>shrine</b> {{buildings}} simultaneously: <b>the</b> public <b>shrine</b> and <b>the</b> main <b>shrine.</b> <b>The</b> main <b>shrine</b> {{is immediately}} behind <b>the</b> public <b>shrine</b> and is located on a small hill. Anyone who wishes to witness the memorial is able to visit and pray in <b>the</b> public <b>shrine</b> but {{is not able to}} go into <b>the</b> main <b>shrine</b> where <b>the</b> ritual takes place.|$|R
25|$|Reports {{indicated}} that no neighborhood was left intact after the uprising. In {{the vicinity of}} <b>the</b> <b>shrines</b> of Husayn ibn Ali and Abbas ibn Ali, most of the buildings surrounding <b>the</b> <b>shrines</b> were completely reduced to rubble. <b>The</b> <b>shrines</b> themselves were scarred from bullet marks and tank fire. They were, however, quickly restored by the Shiite donations.|$|R
5|$|During the Vietnam War <b>the</b> <b>Shrine</b> {{became a}} centre of {{conflict}} when anti-war demonstrators protested during ANZAC Day services against Australia's {{involvement in the}} war. In 1971 <b>the</b> <b>Shrine</b> was defaced when the word PEACE! was painted in large white letters on the pillars of the north portico.|$|E
5|$|In 1951 {{the body}} of Field Marshal Sir Thomas Blamey, Australia's {{military}} commander during World War II, was held at <b>the</b> <b>Shrine</b> for three days for public viewing followed by a State funeral on site. 20,000 people visited <b>the</b> <b>Shrine</b> as he lay in state.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> Wu Family <b>Shrines</b> (...) , {{of which}} <b>the</b> Wu Liang <b>Shrine</b> is <b>the</b> best known, was <b>the</b> family <b>shrine</b> of <b>the</b> Wu clan of the Eastern Han dynasty. <b>The</b> <b>shrines</b> contain {{a vast amount}} of relief carvings.|$|R
5000|$|Not {{only the}} Nawabs but the Noble {{men and the}} Locals also built <b>the</b> <b>Shrines</b> (Shabi-e-Rauza) of [...] "Ahlebait" [...] in Lucknow. The idea of {{building}} <b>the</b> <b>Shrines</b> was to give an easy access {{to those people who}} are unable to visit <b>the</b> original <b>Shrines</b> in <b>the</b> Mid-East region.|$|R
2500|$|Such traditions {{included}} the tying of a turban (dastar bandi) to signify inheritance of Baba Farid's spiritual authority, the regularization of qawwali music, establishment of <b>the</b> <b>shrine's</b> free kitchen, and {{opening of the}} tomb's southern door to allow visitors to the urs festival to directly pass <b>the</b> <b>shrine's</b> most sacred area. Devotees would also pass through <b>the</b> <b>shrine's</b> Beheshti Darwaza in order to symbolically enter paradise.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>shrine</b> at Bury St Edmunds {{soon became}} one of the most famous and wealthy pilgrimage {{locations}} in England. In 1010, Edmund's remains were translated to London to protect them from the Vikings, where they were kept for three years before being returned to Bury. For centuries <b>the</b> <b>shrine</b> was visited by various kings of England, many of whom gave generously to the abbey: Sweyn's son, King Canute, converted to Christianity and rebuilt the abbey at Bury St Edmunds. In 1020, he made a pilgrimage and offered his own crown upon <b>the</b> <b>shrine</b> as atonement for the sins of his forefathers.|$|E
5|$|In 1909, Haifa became {{important}} to the Bahá'í Faith when {{the remains of the}} Báb, founder of the Bábí Faith and forerunner of Bahá'u'lláh in the Bahá'í Faith, were moved from Acre to Haifa and interred in <b>the</b> <b>shrine</b> built on Mount Carmel. Bahá'ís consider <b>the</b> <b>shrine</b> to be their second holiest place on Earth after <b>the</b> <b>Shrine</b> of Bahá'u'lláh in Acre. Its precise location on Mount Carmel was shown by Bahá'u'lláh himself to his eldest son, `Abdu'l-Bahá, in 1891. `Abdu'l-Bahá planned the structure, which was designed and completed several years later by his grandson, Shoghi Effendi. In a separate room, the remains of `Abdu'l-Bahá were buried in November 1921.|$|E
5|$|In 1985 the Remembrance Garden {{was added}} beneath the western face of <b>the</b> <b>Shrine</b> to honour those who served during post-World War II conflicts.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> only grand <b>shrine</b> was Ōtori Shrine in Ōtori District (Ōtorikita, Sakai), ranking {{among the}} Myōjin Taisha; it also became Izumi Province’s primary <b>shrine.</b> <b>The</b> {{secondary}} <b>shrine</b> was Izumi-Anashi <b>Shrine</b> (Toyonaka, Izumiōtsu); <b>the</b> tertiary <b>shrine</b> was Hijiri <b>Shrine</b> (Ōji, Izumi), <b>the</b> quaternary Tsugawa <b>Shrine</b> (Tsugawa, Kishiwada), and <b>the</b> quinary Hine <b>Shrine</b> (Hineno, Izumisano). However, Hine Shrine {{was listed as}} <b>the</b> quaternary <b>shrine</b> in a 1501 document. The sōja was <b>the</b> Five <b>Shrine</b> Sōja complex at Izumi-Inoue <b>Shrine</b> in <b>the</b> capital, where the kami of <b>the</b> above five <b>shrines</b> were also enshrined.|$|R
50|$|The Supreme Genius of King Khan and <b>the</b> <b>Shrines</b> is <b>the</b> seventh studio album by {{the nine}} member {{psychedelic}} soul band King Khan and <b>the</b> <b>Shrines.</b> It was released June 17, 2008 by Vice Records.|$|R
25|$|A {{system of}} social {{hierarchy}} {{developed as a}} result of <b>the</b> <b>shrine's</b> Adab. <b>The</b> diwan and his family were considered the most important, followed by <b>the</b> <b>shrine's</b> khalifas, members of the Chisti class, chiefs of local agricultural clans.|$|R
5|$|Materials for {{building}} <b>the</b> <b>Shrine</b> were sourced from within Australia: the chosen building stone was granodiorite quarried from Tynong; the internal walls use sandstone from Redesdale; {{and the black}} marble columns used stone from Buchan. This raised some concerns when redeveloping <b>the</b> <b>Shrine,</b> as the Tynong quarry {{was no longer in}} use, and it proved to be prohibitively expensive to reopen the site. Fortunately another quarry in the area was available and was able to provide the necessary stone.|$|E
5|$|More {{than half}} a century after the capture of Jerusalem, in 691, the Umayyad caliph Abd al-Malik {{commissioned}} the construction of the Dome of the Rock over a large outcropping of bedrock on the Temple Mount. The 10th-century historian al-Muqaddasi wrote that Abd al-Malik built <b>the</b> <b>shrine</b> in order to compete in grandeur with the city's Christian churches. Whatever the intention, the impressive splendor and scale of <b>the</b> <b>shrine</b> is seen as having helped significantly in solidifying the attachment of Jerusalem to the early Muslim faith.|$|E
5|$|Ramza is chased {{throughout}} the story by <b>the</b> <b>Shrine</b> Knights, {{the soldiers of}} the Church who are hunting the Zodiac Stones, although he gains allies, either by saving their lives, or by showing them the truth. Some individuals {{with knowledge of the}} Zodiac Stones attempt to conspire with <b>the</b> <b>Shrine</b> Knights for its power, though most fail. Ramza also acquires proof of the Church's lies about Saint Ajora, a central figure in the religion, and attempts to use it along with the Zodiac Stone to reveal the organization's plot.|$|E
50|$|The temple {{is said to}} {{have been}} built in the 5th century AD, during the reign of Emperor Hanzei. In the past it was also known as Himeyama Shrine, but has become more {{commonly}} known as <b>the</b> Sanko <b>Shrine</b> of Mt. Sanada. According to <b>the</b> <b>shrine's</b> history, <b>the</b> current head priest is the 86th head in <b>the</b> <b>shrine's</b> lineage.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Aso <b>Shrine</b> {{was heavily}} damaged in the 2016 Kumamoto earthquakes. <b>The</b> <b>shrine's</b> rōmon (tower gate) {{completely}} collapsed. The haiden (worshiping hall) also collapsed.|$|R
50|$|Shimosuwa is the {{location}} of two of <b>the</b> <b>shrines</b> {{that make up the}} famous Suwa Taisha or Suwa Grand <b>Shrine.</b> <b>The</b> Harumiya (春宮) and Akimiya (秋宮) shrines are symbolically renewed every six years during the Onbashira festival. Huge trees are cut in a Shinto ceremony, then the logs are dragged from the mountains down to <b>the</b> <b>shrines.</b>|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Shrine</b> {{went through}} a {{prolonged}} process of development which began in 1918 with the initial proposal to build a Victorian memorial. Two committees were formed, the second of which ran a competition for the memorial's design. The winner was announced in 1922. However, opposition to the proposal (led by Keith Murdoch and The Herald) forced {{the governments of the}} day to rethink the design, and a number of alternatives were proposed, the most significant of which was the ANZAC Square and cenotaph proposal of 1926. In response, General Sir John Monash used the 1927 ANZAC Day march to garner support for <b>the</b> <b>Shrine,</b> and finally won the support of the Victorian government later that year. The foundation stone was laid on 11 November 1927, and <b>the</b> <b>Shrine</b> was officially dedicated on 11 November 1934.|$|E
5|$|The medieval {{phase of}} the history of <b>the</b> <b>shrine</b> began with the arrival of Kalyanagiri Swamy from North India {{sometimes}} during the 16th or 17th century. He identified the very spot of the shrines and their mythic associations with characters and events as expounded in Kanda Puranam. Following his re-establishment of the forest shrine, it again became a place of pilgrimage for Indian and Sri Lankan Hindus. <b>The</b> <b>shrine</b> also attracted local Sinhala Buddhist devotees. The caretakers of the shrines were people of the forest who were of indigenous Vedda or mixed Vedda and Sinhalese lineages. The shrines popularity increased with the veneration of the place by the kings of the Kingdom of Kandy, the last indigenous kingdom before colonial occupation of the island. When Indian indentured workers were brought in after the British occupation in 1815, they too began to participate in the pilgrimage in droves, thus the popularity of <b>the</b> <b>shrine</b> increased amongst all sections of the people.|$|E

5|$|Bonsecours is a commune on {{a plateau}} to the {{southwest}} of Rouen. Until 1890 only an infrequent bus service linked it to Rouen. However, it attracted many hikers, with its splendid panoramas over the meandering Seine, and pilgrims visiting <b>the</b> <b>shrine</b> to the Virgin Mary.|$|E
5|$|Designed by architects Phillip Hudson and James Wardrop {{who were}} both World War I veterans, <b>the</b> <b>Shrine</b> is in a {{classical}} style, being {{based on the}} Tomb of Mausolus at Halicarnassus and the Parthenon in Athens.

5|$|Edmund's shrine was {{destroyed}} in 1539, during the English Reformation.
