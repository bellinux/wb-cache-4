Armed with his key instrument, the piano, he sought incessantly to transcend its inherent technical limits, remaining apparently insensible to the restrictions which had withheld more restrained composers.|$|E

25|$|Between the seventeenth-century and {{the early}} {{eighteenth-century}} the lightning system of the streets of London was radically transformed with the adoption of lamps with convex lens: a bull's eye glass that {{had the effect of}} concentrating the light. This new type of lamp lit up much more of the street than it was usual with candles and lanterns with horn sides; though they produced such a concentrated beam of light <b>to</b> <b>dazzle</b> the passers-by, and preventing them from seeing possible near dangers. According to Moreton, {{this is not just a}} minor annoyance but a real peril for the common citizen's life and conversely an unexpected facilitator for criminals.|$|E

25|$|The Welkin {{required}} a sophisticated electrical system. This was to minimise {{the number of}} seals and points of entry in the cockpit for the controls and instrumentation. It took an electrician experienced in {{the features of the}} Welkin four hours to undertake a pre-flight check of this system. The wings were so large that the high lift Fowler flaps of the Whirlwind were not needed, and were replaced by a simple split flap. The extra wing area also required more stability, so the tail was lengthened to provide a longer moment arm. The armament − four Hispano 20 mm cannon − was the same as the Whirlwind's, but the Welkin carried the guns in a tray in its belly, which facilitated loading. In that position, muzzle flash was also less likely <b>to</b> <b>dazzle</b> the pilot.|$|E

[...] Many are very heavily decorated in virtuoso displays of goldsmiths' technique; rather too heavily for conventional modern taste.

500|$|In {{breeding}} years, {{the loud}} booming calls {{of the males}} at their mating arenas {{made it easy for}} Māori hunting parties to track the kakapo down, and it was also hunted while feeding or when dust-bathing in dry weather. The bird was caught, generally at night, using snares, pitfall traps, or by groups of domesticated Polynesian dogs which accompanied hunting parties – sometimes they would use fire sticks of various sorts <b>to</b> <b>dazzle</b> a bird in the darkness, stopping it in their tracks and making the capture easier. Cooking was done in a hāngi or in gourds of boiling oil. The flesh of the bird could be preserved in its own fat and stored in containers for later consumption – hunters of the Ngāi Tahu tribe would pack the flesh in baskets made from the inner bark of totara tree or in containers constructed from kelp. Bundles of kakapo tail feathers were attached to the sides of these containers to provide decoration and a way to identify their contents. Also taken by the Māori were the bird's eggs, which are described as whitish [...] "but not pure white", and about the same size as a kererū egg.|$|E

While Christgau felt some material was [...] "offensive", he described the album's first three tracks as being the [...] "Rodney Jerkins of the year" [...] adding {{that he did not}} [...] "believe the [...] hype matters". Nikki Tranter of PopMatters said that it is both innovative and meaningful because exceptional songs such as [...] "The Lost Children" [...] and [...] "Whatever Happens" [...] more than make up for overly sentimental songs like [...] "Heaven Can Wait" [...] and [...] "You Are My Life". Q magazine said that it is an aurally interesting, albeit inconsistent, album. In a negative review for The New York Times, Jon Pareles suggested that the album is somewhat impersonal and humorless, as Jackson rehashes ideas from his past songs and is [...] "so busy trying <b>to</b> <b>dazzle</b> listeners that he forgets to have any fun." [...] In a retrospective review for The Rolling Stone Album Guide, Pareles said that Invincible showed Jackson had lost his suave quality to [...] "grim calculation".|$|E

[...] David Sims at The Atlantic called Legion [...] "the latest, and most indulgent, entrant" [...] in a trend of [...] "shows that rely far less on plot than on mood, that are crammed with stunning visuals and frustrating, circular dialogue." [...] Sims praised the series' style and Stevens' performance, but felt that [...] "it tries so hard <b>to</b> <b>dazzle</b> that it forgets to tell a meaningful story." [...] The Washington Posts Hank Stuever also questioned the need for another series where [...] "viewers find themselves trapped {{in the center of a}} tortured mind".

[...] Kristal Hawkins of The Village Voice said that he [...] "hit his artistic maturity" [...] with the album. Robert Christgau remarked on its place in his solo career, [...] "In 1996, Saadiq turned the climactic Tony! Toni! Toné! album into a virtuoso history lesson. Six years later, he tried <b>to</b> <b>dazzle</b> Maxwell in his own reflected glory. Six years later yet again, he outd himself with a fearless return to retro." [...] Elton John, a fan of Saadiq's music since his beginnings with Tony! Toni!

[...] He subsequently called Saadiq to congratulate him for the album and ask him to play at his AIDS Foundation Academy Award Party in 2009. In an interview for Blues & Soul, Saadiq elaborated on the album's impact on his career: [...] "before that record – after I'd been in Tony Toni Tone! and Lucy Pearl – most people had thought 'Oh well, he's a producer now. He’s never gonna be an artist, he's not gonna put the time in' ... The Way I See It showed them that yes, I could put the time in still and be an artist!" ...|$|E
500|$|... "At Long Last Leave" [...] has {{received}} generally positive reviews from television critics, [...] particularly for its couch gag in the Simpsons opening sequence. This couch gag features a frame-by-frame montage of previous couch gags that pulls {{back into a}} photomosaic of the number [...] "500". The A.V. Club critic Hayden Childs wrote that the [...] "best thing about the 500th Simpsons episode is the opening couch montage, which hits the nostalgia bullseye almost perfectly." [...] HitFix's Alan Sepinwall praised the couch gag as being [...] "marvelous", noting that it [...] "actually made me choke up a bit." [...] Sepinwall commended [...] "At Long Last Leave", commenting that [...] "like many latter-day Simpsons outings, [...] features a story we've seen variations on several times before (including in The Simpsons Movie), but also features many funny jokes that affirm my belief that I'm happier {{to live in a}} world that keeps giving us new Simpsons episodes [...] than I will be in the one where that inevitably stops." [...] Similarly to Sepinwall, Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter wrote: [...] "I got a few laughs and that's all I ever look for in The Simpsons these days. I just like knowing it's still there. [...] It doesn't have the spring in the legs quite like it used to. It's not going <b>to</b> <b>dazzle</b> at the same spectacular rate.

500|$|Brian Lowry of Variety {{said that}} [...] "Losts return goes {{down like a}} welcome tonic as scripted TV fades to black... {{providing}} an unusually generous array of juicy moments for the large (and, at times, neglected) cast."

[...] Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly felt that the premiere was mind-blowing and featured good acting by Garcia. [...] Frazier Moore of the Associated Press wrote that [...] "Lost is further upping the ante, and heightening the pressure on us as the show's vast mythology continues to metastasize." [...] Kristin Dos Santos of E! called it [...] "so well written, produced, acted and directed {{it felt like a}} movie". [...] Michael Ausiello of TV Guide described it as [...] "easily one of the best hours of TV so far this season." [...] Bruce Fretts of TV Guide responded well to Reddick's performance. [...] Chris Carabott of IGN gave the episode 9.1/10, stating that it was [...] "a great start to what promises to be an exciting... season 4. [...] The momentum and pacing is on par with last season's finale". [...] LTG of Television Without Pity graded it as an [...] "A–". [...] Jon Lachonis of UGO gave the episode an [...] "A+", calling it [...] "a crushingly emotional, action packed introduction... that... Losts groundbreaking protean form still has plenty of blinding ways <b>to</b> <b>dazzle</b> and entertain {{in a way that is}} nonetheless unique unto itself." [...] Oscar Dahl of BuddyTV wrote that [...] "the episode was pretty much a masterpiece".

2500|$|Sebastiano, who {{had arrived}} in Rome from Venice in 1511, may have {{intended}} <b>to</b> <b>dazzle</b> the Roman critics with the colouring for which the Venetian School was famous, giving [...] "the greatest and most subtly varied range of colours ever seen in a single painting".

2500|$|The {{combination}} of visuals and music with {{the setting of}} the criminal underworld has drawn comparisons to Pulp Fiction and the films of Quentin Tarantino, that had spawned a certain type of [...] "90s indie cinema" [...] which [...] "strove <b>to</b> <b>dazzle</b> the viewer with self-conscious cleverness and empty shock tactics". This impacted the shooting style of the film, which features [...] "wildly imaginative" [...] and [...] "downright hallucinatory" [...] visual imagery, achieved through a mix of [...] "a handheld, hurtling camera", jump cuts, zoom shots, freeze frames and wide angles.

2500|$|Metropolis {{features}} {{a range of}} elaborate special effects and set designs, ranging from a huge gothic cathedral to a futuristic cityscape. In an interview, Fritz Lang reported that [...] "the film was born from my first sight of the skyscrapers in New York in October 1924". He had visited New York {{for the first time}} and remarked [...] "I looked into the streets – the glaring lights and the tall buildings – and there I conceived Metropolis." [...] Describing his first impressions of the city, Lang said that [...] "the buildings seemed to be a vertical sail, scintillating and very light, a luxurious backdrop, suspended in the dark sky <b>to</b> <b>dazzle,</b> distract and hypnotize". He added [...] "The sight of Neuyork [...] alone should be enough to turn this beacon of beauty into the center of a film..." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{film was}} well {{received}} by critics. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film {{four out of}} four stars and described the film as [...] "a dazzling movie from Walt Disney in which computers {{have been used to}} make themselves romantic and glamorous. Here's a technological sound-and-light show that is sensational and brainy, stylish, and fun". However, {{near the end of his}} review, he noted (in a positive tone), [...] "This is an almost wholly technological movie. Although it's populated by actors who are engaging (Bridges, Cindy Morgan) or sinister (Warner), it is not really a movie about human nature. Like Star Wars or The Empire Strikes Back, but much more so, this movie is a machine <b>to</b> <b>dazzle</b> and delight us". Ebert closed his first annual Overlooked Film Festival with a showing of Tron. Tron was also featured in Siskel and Ebert's video pick of the week in 1993.|$|E
2500|$|The Fancy sailed for Bourbon, {{arriving}} in November 1695.

The remaining men set course, after some dissension, for Nassau in the Bahamas, Every purchasing some ninety slaves shortly before sailing. Along the way, the slaves would be used for the ship's most difficult labor and, being [...] "the most consistent item of trade," [...] could later be traded for whatever the pirates wanted. In this way, Every's men avoided using their foreign currency, which might reveal their identities.|$|E
