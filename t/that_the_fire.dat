5|$|The Great Plague {{epidemic}} of 1665 {{is believed to}} have killed a sixth of London's inhabitants, or 80,000 people, and it is sometimes suggested <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> saved lives in the long run by burning down so much unsanitary housing with their rats and their fleas which transmitted the plague, as plague epidemics did not recur in London after the fire. Historians disagree as to whether the fire played a part in preventing subsequent major outbreaks. The Museum of London website claims that there was a connection, while historian Roy Porter points out <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> left the most insalubrious parts of London, the slum suburbs, untouched.|$|E
5|$|A pretrial show cause {{hearing in}} the Green case began in January 1996, with Green {{represented}} by Dennis Moore and Kevin Moriarty. Green's defense claimed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> in the family home had been set not by Debora Green, but by her son, Tim Farrar, {{who had once been}} caught by local police setting off Molotov cocktails. The defense also attempted to attribute Farrar's poisoning to Tim, who did much of the cooking in the household.|$|E
5|$|Another {{monument}} {{marks the}} spot where the fire stopped: the Golden Boy of Pye Corner in Smithfield. According to the inscription, it was evidence of God's wrath on the City of London for the sin of gluttony <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> started at Pudding Lane and stopped at Pye Corner.|$|E

50|$|Speculation {{ascribed}} <b>the</b> <b>fires</b> {{to various}} natural and supernatural causes. <b>The</b> <b>fires</b> stopped in August. In 2008 investigators concluded <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>fires</b> were arson cases.|$|R
5|$|In January 1950, a fire {{broke out}} that {{destroyed}} over 2,500 huts, home to nearly 3,500 families and 17,000 total people. The disaster highlighted the need for proper fire prevention in the largely wooden-built squatter areas, complicated {{by the lack of}} political ties with the colonial and Chinese governments. The ruins gave new arrivals to the Walled City the opportunity to build anew, causing speculation <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> may have been intentionally set.|$|E
5|$|On 23 November 1984, during {{renovation}} works, {{the station}} suffered a severe fire which burned out the northbound Victoria line platform. It is believed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> {{was caused by}} smoking materials being pushed through a ventilation grille into a storeroom where they set several materials on fire. This caused the Victoria line between Warren Street and Victoria to be suspended until 18 December the same year. This incident also led to a smoking ban being introduced on trains in July 1984.|$|E
5|$|On 27 February 1939 the {{new owner}} of the rectory, Captain W. H. Gregson, was {{unpacking}} boxes and accidentally knocked over an oil lamp in the hallway. The fire quickly spread {{and the house was}} severely damaged. After investigating the cause of the blaze the insurance company concluded <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> had been started deliberately.|$|E
50|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>fires</b> are <b>the</b> inspiration for the fire-breathing Chimera in Homer's Illiad.|$|R
25|$|In particular, <b>the</b> video alleges <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>fires</b> inside <b>the</b> {{twin towers}} were not {{hot enough to}} bring the {{buildings}} down. An audio tape is presented in which the Captain of Ladder 7 claims <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>fires</b> can be brought under control by two lines and it is mentioned that building 7 had taken only minor damage before its own collapse. These allegations follow a listing of buildings that burned longer than the Twin Towers and did not fall.|$|R
25|$|Near the {{completion}} of the £5 million conversion, <b>the</b> vessel caught <b>fire</b> on 9 January 1972. There is some suspicion <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>fires</b> were set deliberately, as several blazes broke out simultaneously throughout the ship. <b>The</b> fact <b>that</b> C.Y. Tung had acquired the vessel for $3.5 million, and had insured it for $8 million, led some to speculate <b>that</b> <b>the</b> inferno was part of a fraud to collect on the insurance claim. Others speculated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>fires</b> were <b>the</b> result of a conflict between Tung, a Chinese Nationalist, and Communist-dominated ship construction unions.|$|R
5|$|The August 26, 1977 ABC Evening News {{covered the}} story of a major fire at the embassy. Despite the {{severity}} of the fire, all personnel were evacuated safely, and the efforts of the embassy staff elicited a commendation from President Jimmy Carter. Former KGB agent Victor Sheymov testified before Congress in 1998 <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> was deliberately induced by the Soviets in an effort to gain access to sensitive areas by agents posing as firemen.|$|E
5|$|The {{accident}} was {{investigated by the}} authorities at Bombay. The report was released on 11 September 1944 and concluded <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> and subsequent explosion on Fort Stikine was an accident. Sabotage was ruled out. The death toll was given as 231 service and port personnel killed, with 476 injured. Civilian casualties were in excess of 500 killed, with 2,408 treated in hospital.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause of}} the fire could not be {{determined}} with certainty. One possibility is that a fire smouldered in the furniture store Inden under the hotel, {{and the opening of}} the elevator shaft in the morning provided an inflow of oxygen, causing the fire to spread. There is also a theory <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> was set by burglars who tried to cover their tracks; however, {{there was no evidence of}} a burglary.|$|E

5|$|The fire {{consumed}} up to 1000cords {{of firewood}} every {{year during the}} 180-day navigation period, a quantity so great that it led to deforestation {{of most of the}} Kõpu peninsula. A team of six was on guard every night, but storms extinguished the fire often. A rule passed in 1652 decreed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> must be strong and a fathom (~) high.|$|E
5|$|The {{review board}} {{determined}} that the electrical power momentarily failed at 23:30:55 GMT, and found evidence of several electric arcs in the interior equipment. They were unable to identify conclusively a single ignition source. They determined <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> most likely started near {{the floor in the}} lower left section of the cabin, close to the Environmental Control Unit. It spread from the left wall of the cabin to the right, with the floor being affected only briefly.|$|E
5|$|Anderson {{left the}} Centralia area on September 27, pursued {{for the first}} time by Union forces {{equipped}} with artillery. Anderson evaded the pursuit, leading his men into ravines that the Union troops would not enter for fear of ambush. In the aftermath of the attacks, Union soldiers committed several revenge killings of Confederate-sympathizing civilians. They burned Rocheport to the ground on October 2; the town was under close scrutiny by Union forces, owing to the number of Confederate sympathizers there, but General Fisk maintained <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> was accidental. Anderson watched the fire from nearby bluffs.|$|E

30|$|Field {{verification}} that {{populations of}} fire sensitive taxa {{are able to}} persist under a regime of frequent <b>fire</b> provided <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>fires</b> are patchy {{is also consistent with}} modeling by Enright et al. (1996) who reported that Banksia hookeriana Meisn. was able to persist even if fires occurred at two- to three-year intervals, provided <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>fires</b> only burnt {{a small fraction of the}} population (i.e., <b>the</b> <b>fires</b> were patchy). <b>That</b> extirpation occurred in two of the fifteen plots studied here also supports the conclusions of Groeneveld et al. (2008) <b>that</b> <b>the</b> frequency of lethal <b>fires</b> at <b>the</b> patch level needs to exceed the juvenile period of (serotinous) species if the species is to persist.|$|R
5|$|Hardy met {{his girlfriend}} Beth Britt in 1999, {{shortly after the}} Hardy Boyz had won the WWF Tag Team Championship for the first time. Hardy and his brother Matt went to a club in Southern Pines, North Carolina, where Hardy met her. On March 15, 2008, it was {{reported}} that Hardy's house had burned to the ground in a fire. Hardy and his girlfriend were not home at the time, but his dog, Jack, was killed in the fire. It is believed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> was started by faulty electrical wiring. In October 2008, Hardy was building a new home in the same area, which was expected to be completed by early 2009. In August 2010, Hardy announced that Britt was pregnant with the couple's first child, a daughter named Ruby Claire Hardy, who was born on October 19, 2010. The pair's second child, a daughter, Nera Quinn Hardy, was born on December 31, 2015. Hardy married Britt on March 9, 2011.|$|E
5|$|In Japan {{during its}} opening week, Path of Radiance sold over 100,357 copies, selling through 64.16% of its initial shipment. By {{the end of}} 2005, the game had sold 156,413 copies. In its UK debut, it {{reached the top of}} the GameCube charts. Although no exact sales figures have been published, Nintendo cited the game as being among its {{successful}} GameCube titles for 2005. According to the developers, the fact that it was released near the end of the GameCube's lifespan affected sales, but it still managed to help sell the hardware and convinced Nintendo <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fire</b> Emblem had selling power on home consoles.|$|E
5|$|On {{the front}} side, on the Rokin, the rescue {{operations}} of the fire department were also hampered. There were so many people standing on the window ledges screaming <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> fighters did not know who to save first. Time was also lost because some people threw their luggage in the life net and then jumped into it themselves, causing injuries. Some people fell {{to the side of}} the net and were severely injured. Just before 7:00am the part of the hotel which faced the Kalverstraat collapsed. The burning debris landed on the fire engine in the Kalverstraat, and the fire fighters barely escaped to safety. The nearby book store was also burned out and fires broke out in several buildings on the other side of the Kalverstraat, which were quickly brought under control.|$|E
25|$|The FBI is {{investigating}} possible church arson after several black churches burned {{down in one}} week's time following the shooting. On July 3, Time reported <b>that</b> <b>the</b> investigation concluded <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>fires</b> were unrelated.|$|R
50|$|The large clay sarcophagi were {{manufactured}} {{and fired}} {{as a single}} piece. The workshops were probably near the cemeteries. It is assumed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>firing</b> kilns were built over the unfired sarcophagi.|$|R

5|$|Plague cases {{continued}} to occur sporadically at a modest rate until {{the summer of}} 1666. On {{the second and third}} of September that year, the Great Fire of London destroyed much of the City of London, and some people believed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> {{put an end to the}} epidemic. However, it is now thought that the plague had largely subsided before the fire took place. In fact, most of the later cases of plague were found in the suburbs, and it was the City of London itself that was destroyed by the Fire.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} Prairie Village home {{purchase}} fell through, however, the couple's Missouri home caught fire while {{the family was}} out. Insurance investigators later determined <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> was caused by an electrical short in a power cord. Though the house was reparable and the couple's home insurance paid out on the damage and lost property, the couple decided to move on, and Green and the children moved into the apartment in which Farrar had been living during the separation while {{the purchase of the}} Prairie Village home was re-negotiated.|$|E
5|$|The battle {{began as}} a {{long-range}} gunnery duel, during which the Russian ships hit the Japanese ships numerous times and forced Tōgō to temporarily disengage. Over two hours {{after the start of}} the battle, the Japanese fleet closed the range and started shooting again at 17:35. Forty minutes later a shell struck Retzivans forward turret near the gun ports, killing one turret crewman and wounding six others from the blast pressure. The impact knocked one 12-inch shell off its loading tray, crushing two other sailors and also setting fire to the canvas covering the gun ports. Fearing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> might spread, the surviving crewmen flooded the turret, knocking out its electrical system. The crew was able to get the turret partially functional within an hour.|$|E
