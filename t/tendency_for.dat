The consistency of the prototypes across ages, judges, and methods was quantitatively measured. The results confirmed the hypothesis in all studies. Personality, social relationship, and social interaction correlates of the prototypes indicated externalizing <b>tendencies</b> <b>for</b> undercontrollers and internalizing <b>tendencies</b> <b>for</b> overcontrollers for both children and adults.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the relationships between}} motivational urges and action <b>tendencies</b> <b>for</b> guilt and shame, looking for moderation effects of individualism and collectivism. This paper was for Psychology 2990, Psychology Honors Research, {{under the direction of}} Professor Craig A. Smith. The director of the Honors Program was Professor Megan Saylor. Includes a powerpoint presentation dated April 13, 2012. There has been limited research regarding the differences in motivational urges, action tendencies and enacted behaviors on a cross-cultural basis. To study this, we administered an online questionnaire, composed of two parts. The first part of this study aimed to validate the EMGEBS scale (Smith & Kirby 2010) for a variety of negative emotions. The second part of this study looked at the relation between emotional correlations and action <b>tendencies</b> <b>for</b> guilt and shame. Further analysis was done to understand the unique action <b>tendencies</b> <b>for</b> each emotion, and whether or not individualism or collectivism (our proxy for cross-cultural differences) was a moderating factor. The statistical validation of the negative EMGEBS scale was successful. While {{the second part of the}} study yielded a number of unique action <b>tendencies</b> <b>for</b> guilt and shame, only two moderating effects were found for individualism and collectivism’s effect on the enacted behaviors.

5|$|Because their {{elliptical}} orbits frequently {{take them}} {{close to the}} giant planets, comets are subject to further gravitational perturbations. Short-period comets have a <b>tendency</b> <b>for</b> their aphelia to coincide with a giant planet's semi-major axis, with the JFCs being the largest group. It is clear that comets {{coming in from the}} Oort cloud often have their orbits strongly influenced by the gravity of giant planets {{as a result of a}} close encounter. Jupiter is the source of the greatest perturbations, being more than twice as massive as all the other planets combined. These perturbations can deflect long-period comets into shorter orbital periods.|$|E

40|$|Three studies {{investigated}} {{the impact of}} self-construal on impulsive consumption. Independents exhibited more impulsive consumption tendencies than did interdependents. A chronically accessible independent self-construal was positively associated with country-level beer consumption (study 1 a) and state-level problem alcohol consumption (study 1 b). Experimentally primed independents reported {{more positive attitudes toward}} immediate beer consumption than did interdependents, and this effect was mediated by state impulsivity. Peer presence increased impulsive consumption <b>tendencies</b> <b>for</b> independents but decreased them for interdependents (studies 2 and 3).

40|$|Empathy is {{a complex}} construct, thought to contain {{multiple}} components. One popular measurement paradigm, the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI), has been used extensively to measure empathic tendencies in schizophrenia research across four domains: empathic concern, perspective-taking, personal distress, and fantasy. However, no recent meta-analysis has been conducted for all four factors of this scale. The goal of this meta-analysis was to examine self-reported empathic <b>tendencies</b> <b>for</b> each factor of the IRI in people with schizophrenia as compared to healthy controls. A literature search revealed 32 eligible schizophrenia studies. The Hedges’ g standardized difference effect size was calculated for each component using a random effects meta-analytic model. Compared to healthy controls, schizophrenia samples reported significantly reduced <b>tendencies</b> <b>for</b> empathic concern, perspective-taking, and fantasy, but significantly greater <b>tendencies</b> <b>for</b> personal distress. Duration of illness significantly moderated the results for perspective-taking such that those with a longer duration exhibited greater deficits; percent female significantly moderated the results for personal distress such that samples with more females exhibited reduced effect sizes. Future work is needed to {{examine the impact of}} heightened personal distress on the empathic tendencies and abilities of those with schizophrenia, including the possible role of emotion regulation...|$|R

5|$|Some {{adjectives}} are inflected for {{degree of}} comparison, with the positive degree unmarked, the suffix -er marking the comparative, and -est marking the superlative: a small boy, {{the boy is}} smaller than the girl, that boy is the smallest.

Other adjectives have comparatives formed by periphrastic constructions, with the adverb more marking the comparative, and most marking the superlative: happier or more happy, the happiest or most happy. There is some variation among speakers regarding which adjectives use inflected or periphrastic comparison, and some studies have shown a <b>tendency</b> <b>for</b> the periphrastic forms to become more common {{at the expense of}} the inflected form.|$|E

5|$|Apart from {{originating}} {{theories on}} the entrepreneur and spatial economics, Cantillon {{also provided a}} dedicated theory on population growth.

Specifically, Cantillon cited three determining variables for population size: natural resources, technology, and culture. Therefore, populations grow only as far as the three aforementioned variables allowed. Furthermore, Cantillon's population theory was more modern than that of Malthus in the sense that Cantillon recognised a much broader category of factors which affect population growth, including the <b>tendency</b> <b>for</b> population growth to fall to zero as a society becomes more industrialised.|$|E
5|$|Culture {{and context}} in infants’ {{linguistic}} environment shape their vocabulary development. English learners {{have been found}} to map novel labels to objects more reliably than to actions compared to Mandarin learners. This early noun bias in English learners is caused by the culturally reinforced <b>tendency</b> <b>for</b> English speaking caregivers to engage in a significant amount of ostensive labelling as well as noun-friendly activities such as picture book reading. Adult speech provides children with grammatical input. Both Mandarin and Cantonese languages have a category of grammatical function word called a noun classifier, which is also common across many genetically unrelated East Asian languages. In Cantonese, classifiers are obligatory and specific in more situations than in Mandarin. This accounts for the research found on Mandarin-speaking children outperforming Cantonese-speaking children in relation to the size of their vocabulary.|$|E
