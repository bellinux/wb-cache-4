5|$|Isabella {{is accused}} of driving a stolen van and taken into custody, while the other {{survivors}} reunite for safety. After Nora is decapitated by malfunctioning elevator doors, the group leaves to track down Isabella, who has gone into labor at the police station, while the policeman on duty rushes Isabella {{to the hospital in}} her van. Along the way they discover they have all cheated death twice; {{had it not been for}} the survivors of Flight 180 <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>all</b> be dead, which explains why the survivors are dying in reverse. Since Thomas saved Kimberly from being hit by the truck, she is last on Death's list.|$|E
5|$|Philip, {{disappointed}} by the spoils in Mysia, proceeded south and plundered the towns and cities of Caria. He invested Prinassus, which held out bravely at first, but when Philip set up his artillery, he sent an envoy into the city offering to let them leave the city unharmed or <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>all</b> be killed. The citizens decided to abandon the city. At this stage in the campaign, Philip's army {{was running out of}} food, so he seized the city of Myus and gave it to the Magnesians in return for food supplies. Since the Magnesians had no grain, Philip settled for enough figs to feed his whole army. Subsequently, Philip turned north in order to seize and garrison the cities of Iasos, Bargylia, Euromus and Pedasa in quick succession.|$|E
5|$|DNA can {{be damaged}} by many sorts of mutagens, which change the DNA sequence. Mutagens include {{oxidizing}} agents, alkylating agents and also high-energy electromagnetic radiation such as ultraviolet light and X-rays. The type of DNA damage produced {{depends on the}} type of mutagen. For example, UV light can damage DNA by producing thymine dimers, which are cross-links between pyrimidine bases. On the other hand, oxidants such as free radicals or hydrogen peroxide produce multiple forms of damage, including base modifications, particularly of guanosine, and double-strand breaks. A typical human cell contains about 150,000 bases that have suffered oxidative damage. Of these oxidative lesions, the most dangerous are double-strand breaks, as these are difficult to repair and can produce point mutations, insertions, deletions from the DNA sequence, and chromosomal translocations. These mutations can cause cancer. Because of inherent limits in the DNA repair mechanisms, if humans lived long enough, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>all</b> eventually develop cancer. DNA damages that are naturally occurring, due to normal cellular processes that produce reactive oxygen species, the hydrolytic activities of cellular water, etc., also occur frequently. Although most of these damages are repaired, in any cell some DNA damage may remain despite the action of repair processes. These remaining DNA damages accumulate with age in mammalian postmitotic tissues. This accumulation appears to be an important underlying cause of aging.|$|E

5|$|In Puerto Rico {{there were}} many minor slave revolts in which the slaves clashed with the {{military}} establishment. In July 1821, Marcos Xiorro, a bozal slave, planned and organized a conspiracy against the slave masters and the colonial government of Puerto Rico. According to his plot, {{which was to be}} carried out on July 27, during the festival celebrations for Santiago (St. James), several slaves were to escape from various plantations in Bayamón, which included the haciendas of Angus McBean, C. Kortnight, Miguel Andino and Fernando Fernández. They were then to proceed to the sugarcane fields of Miguel Figueres, and retrieve cutlasses and swords which were hidden in those fields. Xiorro, together with a slave from the McBean plantation named Mario and another slave named Narciso, would lead the slaves of Bayamón and Toa Baja and capture the city of Bayamón. They would then burn the city and kill those who were not black. After this, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>all</b> unite with slaves from the adjoining towns of Río Piedras, Guaynabo and Palo Seco. With this critical mass of slaves, all armed and emboldened from a series of quick victories, they would then invade the capital city of San Juan, where they would declare Xiorro as their king. Unfortunately for the slave conspirators, the plot was divulged by a fellow slave to the authorities.|$|E
5|$|The Headquarters {{staff of}} Combined Operations at the War Office was tasked with devising {{a plan for}} the glider-borne assault on the plant, as it had been with {{previous}} airborne and commando operations, such as Operation Biting. This was the first British airborne operation ever to use gliders; all previous operations had been conducted solely with parachutists. The staff decided that although gliders would be the most suitable for the operation due to the heavy loads to be carried by the airborne troops, and the possibility that they could be widely dispersed if they were dropped by parachute, the airborne troops would still be trained for a possible parachute insertion if the landing zone for the gliders was found to be unsuitable. Because of the complicated and technical nature of the operation, which would see the plant rigged with explosives and then detonated, it was believed that a minimum of twelve to sixteen men was required, and that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>all</b> have to be skilled engineers. The important nature of the operation also led to the force being doubled in order to duplicate it, to ensure that even if half of the force were killed, the survivors would have the necessary skills to complete the operation. The selected troops were volunteer parachutists chosen from the sappers of 9th Field Company (Airborne) Royal Engineers and 261st Field Park Company (Airborne) Royal Engineers attached to 1st Airborne Division, because the only parachute-trained Royal Engineers unit in existence at the time, 1st Parachute Squadron Royal Engineers, was already deployed in North Africa with 1st Parachute Brigade. Both of the duplicated units that were to participate in the operation were to be commanded by officers from the Royal Engineers; the first by Lieutenant A.C. Allen and the second by Second-Lieutenant M.D. Green, who was later replaced by Lieutenant D.A. Methven when he was injured during a training accident three days before the operation was to begin.|$|E

After that, Lujan went to Kirchner and told him that they had unknowingly crossed into Mexico and that they had better leave now because the villagers had sent word to the Mexican Army. Unwilling to leave his captain behind, Kirchner and his men fought it out for the next forty-five minutes before they realized that if the Mexicans were able to flank and surround them then <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>all</b> be killed. Accordingly, the Americans fought their way back across the Rio Grande and made it to the small town of Clint, where news of the engagement was relayed to Sheriff Frank B. Simmons in El Paso.|$|E

25|$|The Sulpicians {{served as}} missionaries, judges, explorers, schoolteachers, social workers, {{supervisors}} of convents, almsmen, canal builders, urban planners, colonization agents, and entrepreneurs. Despite their {{large role in}} society and their influencing in shaping early Montreal, each night <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>all</b> return to the Saint-Sulpice Seminary. The administration of the seminary in Montreal was modeled on that of Paris, in which the company was run by the superior, the four-man Consulting Council, and the Assembly of Twelve Assistants. According {{to the rules of}} the seminary in 1764, the superior, during his five-year renewable term, was to act like a father and was to be respected. The seminary kept careful records of all employees including birthday, place of birth, marital status, and salary. Female employees posed a particular problem since although a cheap source of labour, their presence in a male religious community was problematic. As land proprietors and Indian advisers, the Sulpicians were actively interested in military affairs. The first significant fortifications in Montreal, at the Mountain mission, were built at their expense.|$|E

In the south, the 1st Army's III Corps {{launched}} its strike on the 5th, and the XVIII Airborne Corps joined in on the 6th, both pushing generally northward. German resistance, initially rather determined, dwindled rapidly. By 13 April, the 9th Army had cleared {{the northern part of the}} pocket, while elements of the XVIII Airborne Corps′ 8th Infantry Division reached the southern bank of the Ruhr, splitting the southern section of the pocket in two. Thousands of prisoners were being taken every day; from 16–18 April, when all opposition ended and the remnants of German Army Group B formally surrendered, German troops had been surrendering in droves throughout the region. Army Group B commander Walther Model committed suicide on 21 April.|$|E
25|$|Other properties, however, {{although}} usually {{described in}} terms of origin, may be generalized to all waves. For such reasons, wave theory represents a particular branch of physics that is concerned with the properties of wave processes independently of their physical origin. For example, based on the mechanical origin of acoustic waves, a moving disturbance in space–time can exist if and only if the medium involved is neither infinitely stiff nor infinitely pliable. If all the parts making up a medium were rigidly bound, then <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>all</b> vibrate as one, with no delay in the transmission of the vibration and therefore no wave motion. On the other hand, if all the parts were independent, then there would not be any transmission of the vibration and again, no wave motion. Although the above statements are meaningless in the case of waves that do not require a medium, they reveal a characteristic that is relevant to all waves regardless of origin: within a wave, the phase of a vibration (that is, its position within the vibration cycle) is different for adjacent points in space because the vibration reaches these points at different times.|$|E

25|$|The strangeness flavour {{quantum number}} S (not to be {{confused}} with spin) was noticed to go up and down along with particle mass. The higher the mass, the lower the strangeness (the more s quarks). Particles could be described with isospin projections (related to charge) and strangeness (mass) (see the uds octet and decuplet figures on the right). As other quarks were discovered, new quantum numbers were made to have similar description of udc and udb octets and decuplets. Since only the u and d mass are similar, this description of particle mass and charge in terms of isospin and flavour quantum numbers works well only for octet and decuplet made of one u, one d, and one other quark, and breaks down for the other octets and decuplets (for example, ucb octet and decuplet). If the quarks all had the same mass, their behaviour would be called symmetric, as <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>all</b> behave {{in exactly the same way}} with respect to the strong interaction. Since quarks do not have the same mass, they do not interact in the same way (exactly like an electron placed in an electric field will accelerate more than a proton placed in the same field because of its lighter mass), and the symmetry is said to be broken.|$|E

25|$|The {{majority}} of McCairns missions were successful. Perhaps his most dangerous mission {{was on the}} night of 14/15 April 1943 when an operator choose a field near Amboise that did not have a clear flare path. As he came in for his landing approach he struck a twelve-foot-tall poplar tree. McCairns asked the operator what the damage was and he was told none, only the radio aerial had been torn away. Without climbing down to inspect the damage for himself, McCairns took aboard his passengers and took off. He soon realised he had a more serious problem. The stick was shaking in his hand and his oil temperature was rising. Eventually the engine froze up. He began gliding down and decided <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>all</b> have to bail out. However, checking in with his passengers he was informed he was carrying four. Only having two parachutes in the back, he realized he would have to try a forced landing on the unknown ground below. With 3,000 feet to go he discovered the reason for the engine failure. The hot carburetor warmer had been knocked out of position. Once he corrected this he was able to restart the engine, and they resumed their rough flight back to RAF Tangmere. After landing it was discovered the spinner was stove in, and the tailplane had been nearly torn loose, held in place by the single remaining screw of a single bracket.|$|E
