25|$|The {{parallels}} between the stories of Enkidu/Shamhat and Adam/Eve have been long recognized by scholars. In both, a man is created from the soil by a god, and lives in a natural setting amongst the animals. He is introduced <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> tempts him. In both stories the man accepts food from the woman, covers his nakedness, and must leave his former realm, unable to return. The presence of a snake that steals a plant of immortality from the hero later in the epic is another point of similarity.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by series co-creators Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld and {{directed}} by Tom Cherones.

He would frequently {{come up with the}} idea for an episode and make it into a teleplay with Seinfeld's help; in a 1991 interview with the Los Angeles Times, Seinfeld stated: [...] "Most of the stories are from [...] life. He just has a tremendous wellspring of ideas. I mean, he just fills notebooks with ideas and I try to help him, but Larry is really the designer of the show." [...] David Sims of The A.V.

500|$|According to Josh Tyrangiel of Time magazine, Late Registration {{serves as}} an {{exhibition}} of [...] "the stealthy power of West's storytelling." [...] West stated that his goal for the album was to touch on topics that {{people from all walks}} of life could find relatable, while remaining true to himself: [...] " [...] raps that were just as ill as Jadakiss and just as understandable as Will Smith." [...] The opening track [...] "Heard 'Em Say" [...] is a [...] "mournfully contemplative" [...] song that [...] "talks about being honest with yourself in a world that is not." [...] The song is written from the perspective of an afflicted, impoverished American quietly lamenting the fallacies of society and questioning the ways of the world around him. West delivers a tongue-in-cheek lyrical narrative within [...] "Gold Digger" [...] in which he critically depicts the disastrous life of a man married <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> manipulates him for financial gain. However, another story arises within the third verse, which illustrates a once destitute black male who earns a fortune and decides to leave a loyal, unselfish girlfriend for a white woman.|$|E

500|$|The House of Lords {{modified}} its {{holding in}} Zamir {{in the later}} decision Khera v. Secretary of State for Home Department; Khawaja v. Secretary of State for the Home Department ("Khawaja", 1983). The facts of this case, which involved two separate appellants, {{were similar to those}} of Zamir. Khera had entered the country by allegedly deceiving a medical officer into thinking he was not married. An answer to the contrary would have precluded him from being given leave to enter the UK. The other appellant, Khawaja, having unsuccessfully applied for a UK visa in Brussels, entered the UK by flying into Manchester, saying he would stay for one week and then return to Brussels to continue his studies. Facts later surfaced proving that, {{at the time of his}} entry, contrary to his declaration that he was single, he had been married <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> had entered the UK on the same flight but had been attended to by a different immigration officer and was granted indefinite leave to remain in the UK as a returning resident.
