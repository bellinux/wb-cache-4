5|$|Cultivation {{from seed}} may be {{difficult}} or easy, depending on the species. The more difficult species to grow include the ones that require a period of dormancy or smoke treatment to simulate a bushfire. Stylidium specimens should be grown in a medium that is kept moist and has a relatively low concentration of nutrients. It {{should also be noted}} that they appear <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> disturbance of their root systems. Minimization of such disturbance will likely result in healthier plants.|$|E
5|$|Penicillin {{has been}} {{suggested}} as the drug of choice {{for the treatment of}} S.iniae infection in mammals, including humans. In the 1995–1996 cluster of human cases, all clinical s were susceptible to penicillin, several cephalosporins, clindamycin, erythromycin, and co-trimoxazole (MICs 0.25µg/ml); all nine patients were treated with parenteral beta-lactam antibiotics and recovered uneventfully. A study of isolates submitted to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention between 2000 and 2004 found all <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> beta-lactams, macrolides, quinolones, and vancomycin.|$|E
5|$|Tooth decay {{is caused}} by certain types of acid-producing {{bacteria}} which cause the most damage {{in the presence of}} fermentable carbohydrates such as sucrose, fructose, and glucose. The resulting acidic levels in the mouth affect teeth because a tooth's special mineral content causes it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> low pH. Depending on the extent of tooth destruction, various treatments can be used to restore teeth to proper form, function, and aesthetics, but there is no known method to regenerate large amounts of tooth structure. Instead, dental health organizations advocate preventative and prophylactic measures, such as regular oral hygiene and dietary modifications, to avoid dental caries.|$|E

30|$|Although {{physical}} {{interpretation of}} the above is obvious, Peter and Flock could not draw definite conclusion between the instability scaling index (ISI) and oil recovery. At low range of ISI, the recovery sounds <b>to</b> <b>be</b> less <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> λ c/D values, whereas within the boundary values, the recovery <b>is</b> found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> highly <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> the scaling index (Peter and Flock 1981).|$|R

25|$|A {{variety of}} {{solid-state}} and vacuum devices have been explored {{for use in}} different parts of the UV spectrum. Many approaches seek to adapt visible light-sensing devices, but these can suffer from unwanted response to visible light and various instabilities. Ultraviolet can be detected by suitable photodiodes and photocathodes, which can be tailored <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> different parts of the UV spectrum. Sensitive ultraviolet photomultipliers are available. Spectrometers and radiometers are made for measurement of UV radiation. Silicon detectors are used across the spectrum.|$|E
25|$|The {{reason for}} using the order for testing drugs is because the two most {{important}} drugs for treating TB are INH and RMP, so these are tested first: PZA is the most likely drug to cause hepatitis and is also the drug that can be most easily omitted. EMB is useful when the sensitivity pattern of the TB organism are not known and can be omitted if the organism is known <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> INH. Regimens omitting each of the standard drugs are listed below.|$|E

25|$|For small {{backyard}} infestations, simply spraying {{the plants}} thoroughly {{with a strong}} water jet every few days may be sufficient protection for roses and other plants. An insecticidal soap solution {{can be an effective}} household remedy to control aphids and other soft-bodied arthropods. It will only kill aphids on contact and has no residual action against aphids that arrive after application. Soap spray may damage plants, especially at higher concentrations or at temperatures above 32°C (90°F). Some plant species are known <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> soap sprays.|$|E
25|$|The {{receptor}} on the vertebrate {{host cell}} is sialic acid, which is {{bound by the}} viral glycoprotein. Entry is by endocytosis, with fusion of the viral and cell membranes occurring once the vesicle is acidified. In common with other orthomyxoviruses, viral transcription and replication both occur in the cell nucleus. In {{some members of the}} genus, replication has been shown <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> the Mx1/MxA protein, which is induced in mice and humans in response to interferon. In one study, this inhibitory effect was shown to be caused by MxA preventing the transport of the THOV genome into the nucleus.|$|E
25|$|Not to be {{confused}} with spin which refers to the magnetic dipole moments of particles, much experimental work is continuing on measuring the electric dipole moments (EDM) of fundamental and composite particles, namely those of the electron and neutron, respectively. As EDMs violate both the parity (P) and time-reversal (T) symmetries, their values yield a mostly model-independent measure of CP-violation in nature (assuming CPT symmetry is valid). Therefore, values for these EDMs place strong constraints upon the scale of CP-violation that extensions to the standard model of particle physics may allow. Current generations of experiments are designed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> the supersymmetry range of EDMs, providing complementary experiments to those done at the LHC.|$|E

40|$|Shape memory alloys (SMAs) are metals that exhibit large {{recoverable}} strains and exert large {{forces with}} tremendous energy densities. The behavior of SMAs is thermomechanically coupled. Their response <b>to</b> temperature <b>is</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> their loading condition and their response <b>to</b> loading <b>is</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> their thermal condition. This coupled behavior <b>is</b> not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> circumvented, but <b>to</b> <b>be</b> confronted and understood, {{since it is}} what manifests SMA's superior clamping performance. To reasonably characterize the coupled behavior of SMA clamping rings used in safety mechanisms, we conduct a series of experiments on SMA samples. The results of the tests will allow increased fidelity in modeling and failure analysis of parts...|$|R

25|$|Oxford Nanopore Technologies’ MinION {{has been}} used to detect DNAm. As each DNA strand passes through a pore, it {{produces}} electrical signals which have been found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> epigenetic changes in the nucleotides, and a hidden Markov model (HMM) was used to analyze MinION data to detect 5-methylcytosine (5mC) DNA modification. The model was trained using synthetically methylated E. coli DNA and the resulting signals measured by the nanopore technology. Then the trained model was used to detect 5mC in MinION genomic reads from a human cell line which already had a reference methylome. The classifier has 82% accuracy in randomly sampled singleton sites, which increases to 95% when more stringent thresholds are applied.|$|E
25|$|Leaders of both fraternities {{made great}} {{attempts}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> {{the pain of}} change and emotions of loss that any such merger would naturally entail. There were pockets of dissent, and not all chapters nor all alumni of Phi Sigma Epsilon participated. Soon after the merger, {{unable or unwilling to}} commit to another national, the former PSE chapter at Cornell was released, and its building was sold to Alpha Chi Omega sorority. Other PSE chapters were found to be non-viable or had simply vanished in the time since a PSE officer had last visited or corresponded, and these were formally closed. Eventually, following several disaffected alumni leaders of Phi Sigma Epsilon, seven PSE groups would go on to form Phi Sigma Phi in 1988.|$|E
25|$|Storm {{has been}} shown <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> the {{dynamics}} of the natural world, and her psionic powers over weather are affected by her emotions. One consequence of this connection to nature is that she often suppresses extreme feelings to prevent her emotional state from resulting in violent weather. She has once sensed a diseased and dying tree on the X-Mansion grounds, detected objects within various atmospheric mediums—including water, and sensed the incorrect motion of a hurricane in the Northern Hemisphere and the gravitational stress on the tides by the Moon and Sun as well as the distortion of a planet's magnetosphere. Storm can view the Earth as weather patterns, and is able to precisely recognize her geographic position through interpretations of these patterns. Storm's mutant abilities are limited by her willpower and the strength of her body. Sentinels have considered Storm an Omega-level mutant on one occasion.|$|E
