5|$|The {{black-throated blue warbler}} mostly forages in the {{understory}} {{instead of}} the canopy. The large leaves and long branches in the understory affect its foraging behaviors. The black-throated blue warbler more often hovers rather than gleans its prey {{because it is more}} difficult <b>to</b> <b>glean</b> among thick understory foliage.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the crucial}} points {{is that there are}} several {{different}} sources for the Battle itself, including poems and songs in Old English, Old Norse, Old Welsh, Middle English, Latin, and Anglo-Norman, highlighting a wide potential of sources in order <b>to</b> <b>glean</b> information about the battle from all sides of the campaign. Furthermore, while these sources might be seen as biased due to national origin and underlying romantic and heroic narrative constructions of the battle for each side, some of the sources, such as the Chronicle work as points of reference to the more lyrical constructions presented in other popular narrative formats. Although there is a relative lack of iron-clad primary sources that are completely unbiased, by taking into account all of these sources, historians and literary scholars can gain a fuller image of the military maneuvers and actions taken by the respective leaders of armies involved in this battle.|$|E
5|$|There are no {{definitive}} orders of battle for Newbury, as official contemporary evidence is thin; {{it is possible}} <b>to</b> <b>glean</b> some information from both later official reports and contemporary accounts, which allow for a reconstruction of the likely disposition of each force. The Royalists were led by Charles I personally, with William Vavasour commanding the right wing, Prince Rupert the left, and Sir John Byron the centre. Artillery support consisted of 20 cannons in total: 6 heavy, 6 medium and 8 light. Initial Royalist and Parliamentarian estimates were of a force of around 17,000 men; modern estimates are of around 7,500 infantry, and 7,000 cavalry. Essex led the Parliamentarians, commanding both the entire force and, separately, the right wing; the left wing was commanded by Philip Stapleton. Artillery support was provided by two heavy cannons and around 20 light cannons; most of the heavy artillery was left at Gloucester to help defend the city. Estimates as to {{the total number of}} men vary between 7,000 and 15,000; John Barratt, noting the losses at Gloucester, estimates that Essex's force totalled around 14,000 men, with 6,000 cavalry and dragoons and 8,000 infantry.|$|E

5|$|Required {{to tender}} {{by the end}} of April 1947, work began on receipt of Specification B.35/46 at Avro, led by {{technical}} director Roy Chadwick and chief designer Stuart Davies; the type designation was Avro 698. It was obvious to the design team that conventional aircraft could not satisfy the specification; knowing little about high-speed flight and unable <b>to</b> <b>glean</b> much from the Royal Aircraft Establishment or the US, they investigated German Second World War swept wing research. The team estimated that an otherwise conventional aircraft, with a swept wing of 45°, would have doubled the weight requirement. Realising that swept wings increase longitudinal stability, the team deleted the tail (empennage) and the supporting fuselage, it thus became a swept-back flying wing with only a rudimentary forward fuselage and a fin (vertical stabilizer) at each wingtip. The estimated weight was now only 50% over the requirement; a delta shape resulted from reducing the wingspan and maintaining the wing area by filling in the space between the wingtips, which enabled the specification to be met. Though Alexander Lippisch is generally credited as the pioneer of the delta wing, Chadwick's team had followed its own logical design process. The initial design submission had four large turbojets stacked in pairs buried in the wing either side of the centreline. Outboard of the engines were two bomb-bays.|$|E

25|$|Since {{tamarins}} can {{discriminate between}} predatory threats using varying vocalizations, recipients of an AC {{are thought to}} extract various complex signals from this form of communication. Primarily, cotton-tops are able <b>to</b> <b>glean</b> {{the identity of the}} cooperating tamarin through differences in individuals' alarm calls. Further, adults are able to discriminate the gender of callers from their ACs and determine the range of calls within a related tamarin's alarm calling repertoire. Alarm call-based identification is postulated to play a number of functional roles in the cotton-top tamarin. Firstly, an AC recipient is able to identify a cooperating tamarin, and by recognizing which in their group it is, be able to judge the reliability of the AC from past experience. This may arise from a selective pressure for being able to statistically determine the amount of risk present, and how endangered an individual and its group are.|$|E
25|$|Edmonds felt {{qualified}} {{to write the}} volume, having visited the Rhineland during the occupation, having gained specialist knowledge {{of the law of}} military government working with Professor L. F. L. Oppenheim (30 March 1858 – 7 October 1919) in 1912 on The Laws and Usages of War and being on good terms with many of the senior officers involved. Edmonds was hampered by a 1942 air raid, that burnt many of the records stored at Walworth in London. At Aberystwyth, Edmonds was isolated from metropolitan libraries and short of researchers. Requests for help from the Director of the Imperial War Museum had little effect, since his books had been moved to Barnstaple in Devon and because coverage of the occupation and inter-war period was sparse, owing to the usual lack of money. Edmonds was still able <b>to</b> <b>glean</b> plenty of details and gossip from senior officers in the occupation. General Charles Fergusson (17 January 1865 – 20 February 1951), a former military governor of Cologne, said that he disliked Field Marshal William Robertson (29 January 1860 – 12 February 1933) and that the enmity had led him to resign, despite being on good terms with General Herbert Plumer (13 March 1857 – 16 July 1932).|$|E

40|$|Many domains in {{the field}} of Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) involve highly {{unbalanced}} data, such as biomedical information extraction, citation matching, and learning relationships in social networks. A common way to measure performance in these domains is to use precision and recall instead of simply using accuracy, and to examine their trade-offs by plotting a precision-recall curve. The goal of this thesis is to find new approaches within ILP particularly suited for large, highly skewed domains. I propose and investigate Gleaner, a randomized search method that collects good clauses from a broad spectrum of points along the recall dimension in recall-precision curves and employs thresholding methods to combine sets of selected clauses. I compare <b>Gleaner</b> <b>to</b> ensembles of standard theories learned by Aleph, a standard ILP algorithm, using a number of large relational domains. I find that Gleaner produces comparable testset results in a fraction of the training time and outperforms Aleph ensembles when given the same amount of training time. I explore extensions <b>to</b> <b>Gleaner</b> with respect <b>to</b> searching and combining clauses, namely finding ways to fully explore the hypothesis space as well as to make better use of those found clauses. I also use <b>Gleaner</b> <b>to</b> estimate the probability that a query is true, further investigate the properties underlying precision-recall curves, and then conclude with a discussion of future work in this area...|$|R
