5|$|An {{example of}} an enzyme that {{contains}} a cofactor is carbonic anhydrase, which is shown in <b>the</b> <b>ribbon</b> diagram above with a zinc cofactor bound {{as part of its}} active site. These tightly bound ions or molecules are usually found in the active site and are involved in catalysis. For example, flavin and heme cofactors are often involved in redox reactions.|$|E
5|$|As {{the apex}} of the Canadian system of honours, the Victoria Cross is to be worn before all other Canadian decorations and {{insignia}} of orders, including the Order of Merit and the Order of Canada. It is worn as a medal, suspended from a medal bar on the left chest, unless protocol calls for a ribbon bar, which consists of a crimson ribbon with a miniature bronze Victoria Cross at its centre. Should an individual receive multiple awards of the Victoria Cross, additional bronze medal bars are added to <b>the</b> <b>ribbon</b> and further miniatures are placed evenly on <b>the</b> <b>ribbon</b> bar, reflecting the number of crosses the wearer has earned.|$|E
50|$|Personnel may wear up {{to three}} badges above <b>the</b> <b>ribbons</b> or pocket flap, or in a similar {{location}} for uniforms without pockets. Personnel may only wear one combat or special skill badges from either group 1 or group 2 above <b>the</b> <b>ribbons.</b> Soldiers may wear {{up to three}} badges from groups 3 and 4 above <b>the</b> <b>ribbons.</b> One badge from either group 1 or group 2 may be worn with badges from groups 3 and 4 above <b>the</b> <b>ribbons</b> {{so long as the}} total number of badges above <b>the</b> <b>ribbons</b> does not exceed three.|$|R
50|$|The {{crest of}} the Sorority {{consists}} of three ribbons overlapping to create a circle. <b>The</b> three <b>ribbons</b> are burgundy, white and old gold respectively. The edges of <b>the</b> <b>ribbons</b> overlap <b>the</b> following way: the burgundy overlaps the white, {{the other end of}} <b>the</b> white <b>ribbon</b> overlaps one end of <b>the</b> old gold <b>ribbon,</b> and <b>the</b> other end of <b>the</b> old gold <b>ribbon</b> overlaps <b>the</b> lower end of <b>the</b> burgundy <b>ribbon.</b> When depicted, <b>the</b> old gold <b>ribbon</b> is always on the bottom, with <b>the</b> burgundy <b>ribbon</b> on <b>the</b> left side of the crest and <b>the</b> white <b>ribbon</b> on <b>the</b> right side (when viewing the crest). The outer edges of each of <b>the</b> <b>ribbons</b> curl back in to form much smaller circular shape.|$|R
40|$|Here {{we report}} on the {{structural}} and magnetic properties of Ni 0. 2 Mn 3. 2 Ga 0. 6 melt-spun <b>ribbons.</b> <b>The</b> as-spun <b>ribbons</b> were found to exhibit mixed cubic phases that transform to non-cubic structure upon annealing. Additionally, an amorphous phase was found to co-exist in all <b>ribbons.</b> <b>The</b> SEM images show that minor grain formation occurs on <b>the</b> as-spun <b>ribbons.</b> However, <b>the</b> formation of extensive nano-grains was observed on the surfaces of <b>the</b> annealed <b>ribbons.</b> While <b>the</b> as-spun <b>ribbons</b> exhibit predominantly paramagnetic behavior, <b>the</b> <b>ribbons</b> annealed under various thermal conditions were found to be ferromagnetic with a Curie temperature of about 380 K. <b>The</b> <b>ribbons</b> annealed at 450 °C for 30 minutes exhibit a large coercive field of about 2500 Oe. The experimental results show that the microstructure and associated magnetic properties of <b>the</b> <b>ribbons</b> can be controlled by annealing techniques. The coercive fields and the shape of the magnetic hysteresis loops vary significantly with annealing conditions. Exchange bias effects have also been observed in <b>the</b> annealed <b>ribbons...</b>|$|R
5|$|For {{mourning}} activities, {{the flag}} can be flown {{in either of}} the following ways. The first method, commonly known as half-staffing, is performed when the flag is hoisted {{to the top of}} the flagpole, then lowered to the pole's one-third position. The other method is to attach a black ribbon to a flag that is permanently affixed to a staff. <b>The</b> <b>ribbon</b> itself is ten centimetres wide and it is attached to the mast so that the ends of <b>the</b> <b>ribbon</b> reach the bottom of the flag. During a funeral ceremony, the flag may be used to cover the coffins of government officials, soldiers, signatories of the Act of the Re-Establishment of the State of Lithuania, and persons designated by an act of the President; these flags are later folded and presented to the next of kin before interment.|$|E
5|$|In Canada, {{every citizen}} {{has the right}} to {{petition}} the Crown for a grant of arms. Canadians who have been appointed to the Order of Canada are automatically entitled to receive an award of arms including <b>the</b> <b>ribbon</b> of the Order, or should they already be armigerous, to encircle their extant arms with <b>the</b> <b>ribbon.</b> Amongst others, all members of the Privy Council are entitled to supporters in their arms, as are the Speakers of the House of Commons and the Senate, Companions of the Order of Canada, Commanders of the Orders of Military Merit, Merit of the Police Forces, and of the Royal Victorian Order.|$|E
5|$|The {{ceremonial}} opening by David Davies with 2,000 guests {{took place}} on 18 July 1889. The first vessel, S.S. Arno sailed into the dock shortly after <b>the</b> <b>ribbon</b> was cut. Six tips were ready for the opening, and loaded coal into six ships.|$|E
50|$|The RSCM {{provides}} {{a series of}} grades and awards to signify varying levels of musical achievement. There are four basic merit awards - <b>the</b> light blue <b>ribbon,</b> <b>the</b> dark blue <b>ribbon,</b> <b>the</b> red <b>ribbon</b> and <b>the</b> yellow <b>ribbon.</b> These awards share the same medal.|$|R
2500|$|Shortly {{after the}} machine was introduced, a [...] "Tech-3" [...] ribbon appeared. It {{essentially}} replaced <b>the</b> cloth <b>ribbon,</b> as it offered typing quality close to <b>the</b> film <b>ribbon</b> but at a use cost comparable to the reusable cloth. Like <b>the</b> cloth <b>ribbon,</b> Tech-3 ribbons incremented {{only a fraction of}} the character width after being struck. Unlike <b>the</b> cloth <b>ribbon,</b> <b>the</b> Tech-3 <b>ribbon</b> provided high quality impressions for several characters from each spot on <b>the</b> one-time-use <b>ribbon.</b> [...] Because characters overstrike each other on a Tech-3 ribbon several times it could not be easily read to discover what had been typed. <b>The</b> Tech-3 <b>ribbon</b> offered equivalent security to <b>the</b> carbon film <b>ribbon,</b> as its impressions were permanent as soon as they were struck. <b>The</b> Tech-3 <b>ribbon</b> was used with the same cover-up tape that worked with <b>the</b> other non-correctable <b>ribbons.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>ribbons</b> for <b>the</b> Faithful Service medals {{stem from}} the basic design used for the Bronze medal. <b>The</b> basic <b>ribbon</b> has a wide light green center stripe flanked by three equal width stripes of yellow, red and black, with black being the edge color. The Silver medal has a narrow silver center stripe added, and the 15- and 20-year ribbons have a narrow yellow center stripe. To {{differentiate}} <b>the</b> 20-year <b>ribbon</b> from <b>the</b> 15-year <b>ribbon,</b> a gold-plated [...] "XX" [...] device is attached, by means of two straight pins soldered {{to the back of}} the device, to both <b>the</b> suspension <b>ribbon</b> and <b>the</b> service <b>ribbon.</b> <b>The</b> Roman numerals are without serifs.|$|R
5|$|The {{design of}} the medal is modeled after one used for the Hero of the Soviet Union. Unlike the Hero of the Soviet Union, Hero of Socialist Labor and the Hero of the Russian Federation titles, there is no {{engraving}} on the reverse of the star. <b>The</b> <b>ribbon</b> also copies the Soviet Hero medal's ribbon, since a flag design was also used to make <b>the</b> <b>ribbon</b> of that medal. The medal is always worn in full {{on the left side}} of the breast above all other medals and orders. Chapter 4, Article 69 of Law N 288-З states that any awards and titles presented by the Soviet Union and the Byelorussian SSR must be placed after awards from the Republic of Belarus.|$|E
5|$|The other {{national}} symbol that was chosen in the 1995 referendum {{was the national}} emblem. The elements of the emblem include a ribbon in {{the colors of the}} national flag, a map of Belarus, wheat ears and a red star. At the base of <b>the</b> <b>ribbon,</b> it says the country's official name in the Belarusian language. The emblem is an allusion to the one used by the Byelorussian SSR, designed by Ivan Dubasov in 1950. In the Soviet version, a hammer and sickle replaced the map of Belarus and <b>the</b> <b>ribbon</b> was all red. On the left and right ribbons, the Soviet motto Workers of the world, unite! appeared in the Belarusian and Russian languages.|$|E
5|$|Shoup began a brief {{assignment}} as Inspector General for Recruit Training in May 1956 {{after being}} ordered {{to do so}} by Commandant Randolph M. Pate following <b>the</b> <b>Ribbon</b> Creek incident, which involved the accidental drowning of six recruits during a training march. As Marine leaders were investigating, they favored Shoup's recommendation of not covering up the incident. He supported an overhaul of recruit training for the Marine Corps in response.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Fe- 6. 5 wt. %Si alloy is one {{excellent}} soft magnetic material. In {{the present}} study, rapid quenching {{was applied to}} fabricate ultra-thin ribbons of Fe- 6. 5 wt. %Si alloy by melt spinning. Continuous ribbons of 20 mm wide, 35 - 45 µm thick were fabricated with optimized experimental parameters. <b>The</b> <b>ribbons</b> exhibited metallic luster appearance, and can be wound without cracks. Microstructure, texture and mechanical properties of <b>the</b> <b>ribbons</b> were investigated. It was found that <b>the</b> rapidly quenched <b>ribbons</b> had intense { 100 } plane texture, and exhibited some extent of bending capability. Finally <b>the</b> <b>ribbons</b> were cold rolled and the surface smoothness was improved for stacking purpose...|$|R

5|$|The Cycle Center was {{completed}} in June 2004 and the official opening occurred on July 19, 2004, the Monday following the Millennium Park's grand opening gala. Attendees for <b>the</b> <b>ribbon</b> cutting included Mayor Daley, CDOT Commissioner Miguel d'Escoto, Chicago Park District General Superintendent Timothy Mitchell, and representatives from the Chicago Bike Federation, Public Building Commission, Chicago Police Department, and Chicago City Council. Managed by the Chicago Department of Transportation (CDOT), the Cycle Center is on the fifth and sixth floors of the Millennium Park parking garage.|$|E
5|$|The OA Universal Ribbon is worn {{suspended}} from the right uniform shirt pocket button. Vigil Honor recipients may add the Vigil Honor pin to <b>the</b> <b>ribbon.</b> Lodge affiliation is indicated by the wearing of the lodge emblem (commonly known as a lodge flap), an embroidered patch is worn on the right pocket flap of the uniform shirt. Each lodge flap has a unique design, generally reflecting the name, geography or history of the lodge. Special issues of flaps may be created to commemorate anniversaries and other events and are a popular item for those who engage in Scouting memorabilia collecting.|$|E
5|$|The {{bridge was}} still under {{construction}} in January 1928, {{and at that time}} the estimated date of completion was only a month away. The bridge finally opened to traffic on 14 April. The official opening of the bridge by the NSW Governor Dudley de Chair occurred on 10 July, and was celebrated by the cutting of <b>the</b> <b>ribbon</b> and an opening of the gates {{at each end of the}} lift span. In return he was presented with a silver cigarette case.|$|E

5|$|The extension's {{completion}} {{was delayed}} by weather and a cement workers' strike; {{it was to}} have been finished by October 1, 1950the tenth anniversary of the opening of the first section. On October 23, 1950, the Philadelphia extension was previewed in a ceremony led by Governor Duff. The extension opened to traffic on November 20, 1950; the governor and chairman Evans cut <b>the</b> <b>ribbon</b> at the Valley Forge mainline toll plaza to the west of King of Prussia.|$|E
5|$|The law {{requires}} the lowering {{of the flag}} to {{the midpoint of the}} flagpole on the days of mourning or during mourning ceremonies. A black ribbon needs to be placed {{at the top of the}} flag; the length of <b>the</b> <b>ribbon</b> should be equal to the length of the flag. The flying flag has to be raised in its entirety, clean, and unfaded; moreover, the lower part of the flag should be at least 2.5 m off the ground.|$|E

5|$|A first {{opening of}} the bridge {{took place in the}} same day with the ceremonies for the {{national}} day on July 14, 1897, in the presence of governor Chabié. <b>The</b> <b>ribbon</b> for the access zone was cut by the governor's wife, then the officials walked a short distance to the mobile deck, which was opened to allow the passage of the military ship L'Ardent. 21 cannon shots were fired at dusk and dawn to commemorate the construction of the bridge and on that day there were organised ceremonies including horse races and donkey races. The second opening was on October 19, 1897, in the presence of André Lebon, the prime minister of the French colonies.|$|E
5|$|Another {{segment of}} freeway opened in 1987 in Clinton County between US127 near DeWitt and Temp. I-69 near Bath. This section was {{connected}} to the existing freeway at Perry in 1991. The final segment of I-69 to be completed was located southwest of Lansing. It opened on October 17, 1992, when <b>the</b> <b>ribbon</b> was cut by Governor John Engler. This segment marked the last in the state to complete Michigan's portion of the Interstate Highway System. At the time it was completed, I-69 was concurrent with US27 from the state line north to the DeWitt area (exit87) and then concurrent with US127 to exit89 before running alone to Port Huron.|$|E
