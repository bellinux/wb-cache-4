50|$|Image {{registration}} {{is a process}} that searches for the correct alignment of images. In the simplest case, two images are aligned. Typically, one image is treated as the <b>target</b> <b>image</b> and the other is treated as a source image; the source image is transformed to match the <b>target</b> <b>image.</b> The optimization procedure updates the transformation of the source image based on a similarity value that evaluates the current quality of the alignment. This iterative procedure is repeated until a (local) optimum is found. An example is the registration of CT and PET images to combine structural and metabolic information (see figure).|$|E
5000|$|Image {{registration}} or image alignment algorithms can {{be classified}} into intensity-based and feature-based. One of the images {{is referred to as}} the reference or source and the others are referred to as the target, sensed or subject images. Image registration involves spatially transforming the source/reference image(s) to align with the <b>target</b> <b>image.</b> The reference frame in the <b>target</b> <b>image</b> is stationary, while the other datasets are transformed to match to the target. [...] Intensity-based methods compare intensity patterns in images via correlation metrics, while feature-based methods find correspondence between image features such as points, lines, and contours. Intensity-based methods register entire images or sub-images. If sub-images are registered, centers of corresponding sub images are treated as corresponding feature points. Feature-based methods establish a correspondence between a number of especially distinct points in images. Knowing the correspondence between a number of points in images, a geometrical transformation is then determined to map the <b>target</b> <b>image</b> to the reference images, thereby establishing point-by-point correspondence between the reference and target images.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel image sequence color transfer algorithm (ISCT). It {{is able to}} render an image sequence with color characteristics borrowed from three user-given <b>target</b> <b>images.</b> The input of this algorithm consists of a single input image (I 1) and three <b>target</b> <b>images</b> (T 1, T 2, T 3). The output of the algorithm is an image sequence {Si} with N images that embeds itself with color mood variations. A user selects necessary parameters, such as N and a color variation curve (CVC), through a user friendly interface we have developed. The algorithm completes the task in three steps. First, it executes a color transfer algorithm using the input <b>image</b> and three <b>target</b> <b>images,</b> producing three basis images (B 1, B 2, B 3). Their color features are thus borrowed from the three <b>target</b> <b>images</b> (T 1, T 2, T 3). Given the user-defined CVCs and three basis images generated in the first step, the ISCT algorithm then interpolates the mean and variance values for N images. Finally, referring to the input image and values interpolated in the second step, the algorithm automatically generates an image sequence. This is achieved in several seconds by applying the color transfer algorithm individually for every interpolated value. In addition, we have developed a user interface which {{makes it possible to}} view the rendered image sequence. Experimental results show that our algorithm swiftly produces an image sequence containing color variation with little user intervention. Given only three <b>target</b> <b>images,</b> the novel ISCT algorithm can demonstrate its ability to produce an image sequence with color mood variation as well as visually plausible effects. This algorithm is automatic, effective, and expeditious, and is appropriate for many applications...|$|R

In the final step, we present an efficient method of color consistency to optimize the color of a collection of images showing the common scene.
