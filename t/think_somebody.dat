500|$|Reacting to The Killing Joke and Barbara Gordon's later {{character}} development as Oracle in Batman: Gotham Knights, Ray Tate, a reviewer at Comics Bulletin, wrote [...] "here {{is absolutely no}} reason why Barbara Gordon {{should be in a}} wheelchair. Alan Moore and Brian Bolland meant The Killing Joke as an imaginary tale dealing with the iconography of Batman and the Joker... himself is a certifiable genius in biochemistry. There are countless examples of Batman employing that which is only theoretical in his fight against crime. His knowledge of stem cell technology should surpass that of the real world. There is simply no reason for Barbara Gordon to be confined to that wheelchair." [...] Regarding her representation as a character living with a disability, and her effectiveness as a hero compared to her incarnation as Batgirl, Tate asserts [...] "t's ridiculous to <b>think</b> <b>somebody</b> wakes up thinking how lucky they are to be confined to a wheelchair, and yet the attitude around DC and among the fans is that Oracle is the better character over Batgirl because of her handicap. Rubbish. Batgirl has fought more crime and done more to aid Batman as Batgirl than she has as Oracle. Batgirl has saved Batman's life on numerous occasions. Oracle has not. Barbara in this incarnation is not a bad character, but she is not better because she no longer hunts the night in cape and cowl." [...] In an article for Bitch magazine entitled [...] "The Cold Shoulder: Saving Superheroines from Comic-book Violence", Shannon Cochran noted a long history of inequality regarding the treatment of female heroes. She quotes Gail Simone, who discussed the gender difference regarding the treatment of Batman and Batgirl regarding paralysis: [...] "Both had their backs broken [...] Less than a year later, Batman was fine. Batgirl—now named Oracle—was in a wheelchair and remained so for many years.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Cornell {{stated in}} a 1996 interview: [...] "I {{know what it}} feels like to be suicidal, and I {{know what it feels}} like to be hopeless. There is some point where I learnt enough about myself to know that I don't have the {{tolerance}} to create other hurdles as well." [...] In 1999, Cornell said about depression, [...] "No one really knows what run-of-the-mill depression is. You'll <b>think</b> <b>somebody</b> has run-of-the-mill depression, and then the next thing you know, they're hanging from a rope. It's hard to tell the difference. But I do feel that depression can be useful. Sometimes it's just chemical. It doesn't seem to come from anywhere. And whenever I've been in any kind of depression, I've over the years tried to not only imagine what it feels like to not be there, but try to remind myself that I could just wake up the next day and it could be gone because that happens, and not to worry about it. And at the same time, when I'm feeling great, I remember the depression and think about the differences in what I'm feeling and why I would feel that way, and not be reactionary one way or the other. You just have to realize that these are patterns of life and you just go through them." ...|$|E
2500|$|Larry David (Larry David) – Candid, neurotic, but {{generally}} disposed to pursue what he perceives {{to be the}} right course, Larry often finds himself in awkward situations that arise {{as a result of his}} obstinate belief in his own ethical principles and codes of conduct, which he is nevertheless prepared to bend when it suits him. He usually has good intentions but often finds himself a victim of circumstance and social convention, as many of the people around him are also self-centered and stubborn. He often focuses on petty details and stubbornly holds to his opinion to the extent of aggravating everyone around him just to prove an insignificant point. The real-life Larry David has commented that although he secretly wishes to be more like his fictionalized version on the series, he could never be that way because he is a lot more cautious when it comes to social tension. Larry's trademark behaviors are his probing stare when he doesn't <b>think</b> <b>somebody</b> is telling the truth, fondly saying something is [...] "prett-ay, prett-ay, prett-ay, pretty good" [...] and, when caught up short in a moment of poor or contrary behavior, quizzically and mock-innocently inquiring, often of his wife, Cheryl, or of a close friend, [...] "No good?" [...] Among Larry's characteristics are his love of playing golf and his annoyance at having to engage in small talk, especially with people he deals with in commercial situations, such as waiters and tradesmen. Larry also humorously explores various aspects of Jewish life, history, and culture.|$|E

Putting the scraps back in the vase, he and Hastings pretend that they have not guessed the truth. Now only Raynor is home, while Poirot sends Hastings and Japp on some errands. Poirot complains that he feels famished due to heat. Raynor brings two glasses of whiskey, one for himself, one for Poirot. Poirot starts explaining the case to him. He suddenly stops as he <b>thinks</b> <b>somebody</b> is overhearing the conversation.|$|R

In other words, white people, this government, and that mayor {{were well aware of}} the fact that black people were dying every day in Los Angeles under gang violence.

6000|$|This {{certainly}} was very uncivil, {{and it almost}} made Lopez angry. But he had {{made up his mind}} that his friend was a little the worse for the wine he had drunk, and therefore he did not resent even this. [...] "Never mind politics and Parliament now," [...] he said, [...] "but let us get home. I am beginning to be sick of this.

So the boys ran off to the barn in high glee, and were so eager to get upon the hay, that they forgot {{altogether}} to shut the door. When they came down they found the door open, and to their great alarm, the colt was nowhere to be seen. Josy, one of the boys, said, 'Let us shut the door now, and not tell father that we let the colt out, and he will <b>think</b> <b>somebody</b> else did it.' ...|$|E
