5|$|The dusky woodswallow is {{medium-sized}} and swallow-like, with a {{dark brown}} hue, {{but there have been}} instances where the bird has appeared grey. <b>The</b> <b>birds</b> <b>have</b> a black patch in front of the eyes, and grey (sometimes also black) wings with white streaks on them. The dusky woodswallow has a black, white-tipped tail with a silver underwing. <b>The</b> <b>birds</b> <b>have</b> a blue-grey bill capped with black.|$|E
5|$|Females are {{attracted}} by the booms of the competing males; they too may need to walk several kilometres from their territories to the arena. Once a female enters the court {{of one of the}} males, the male performs a display in which he rocks from side to side and makes clicking noises with his beak. He turns his back to the female, spreads his wings in display and walks backwards towards her. He will then attempt copulation for 2 to 14minutes. Once <b>the</b> <b>birds</b> <b>have</b> mated, the female returns to her home territory to lay eggs and raise the chicks. The male continues booming in the hope of attracting another female.|$|E
5|$|In {{his book}} King Solomon's Ring, Konrad Lorenz {{described}} and analysed the complex social interactions {{in a western}} jackdaw flock that lived around his house in Altenberg, Austria. He ringed them for identification and caged them in the winter to prevent their annual migration. He found that <b>the</b> <b>birds</b> <b>have</b> a linear hierarchical group structure, with higher-ranked individuals dominating lower-ranked birds, and pair-bonded birds sharing the same rank. Young males establish their individual status before pairing with females. Upon pairing, the female assumes the same social position as her partner. Unmated females are the lowest members in the pecking order, and are the last {{to have access to}} food and shelter. Lorenz noted one case in which a male, absent during the dominance struggles and pair bondings, returned to the flock, became the dominant male, and chose one of two unpaired females for a mate. This female immediately assumed a dominant position in the social hierarchy and demonstrated this by pecking others. According to Lorenz, the most significant factor in social behaviour was the immediate and intuitive grasp of the new hierarchy by each of the western jackdaws in the flock.|$|E

5|$|While some {{cockatoos}} are generalists {{taking a}} wide range of foods, others are specialists. The glossy black cockatoo specialises in the cones of trees of the genus Allocasuarina, preferring a single species, A. verticillata. It holds the cones in its foot and shreds them with its powerful bill before removing the seeds with its tongue. Some species take large numbers of insects, particularly when breeding; in fact the bulk of the yellow-tailed black cockatoo's diet is made up of insects. The large bill is used in order to extract grubs and larvae from rotting wood. The amount of time cockatoos have to spend foraging varies with the season. During times of plenty they may need to feed for only a few hours in the day, in the morning and evening, then {{spend the rest of the}} day roosting or preening in trees, but during the winter most of the day may be spent foraging. <b>The</b> <b>birds</b> <b>have</b> increased nutritional requirements during the breeding season, so they spend more time foraging for food during this time. Cockatoos have large crops, which allow them to store and digest food for some time after retiring to a tree. During hard times, the cockatoos also display versatility in their diet, travelling widely in order to find food, feeding on more green plant material and in some species using their large bills to dig up corms.|$|E
25|$|Spring {{migration}} broadens once <b>the</b> <b>birds</b> <b>have</b> {{passed through}} Mexico as they disperse through the breeding range.

25|$|In particular, Papakanui Spit on {{the south}} head of the harbour entrance, a mobile sandspit, is {{important}} as a breeding and roosting area for the New Zealand dotterel and the fairy tern. It also has areas of pingao. The spit was an important habitat for the Caspian tern. <b>The</b> <b>birds</b> <b>have</b> moved {{to other parts of}} Kaipara Harbour, possibly due to human disturbance.

25|$|As a {{relatively}} small and isolated oceanic island, Norfolk has few land birds but {{a high degree of}} endemicity among them. Many of the endemic species and subspecies have become extinct as a result of massive clearance of the island's native vegetation of subtropical rainforest for agriculture, hunting and persecution as agricultural pests. <b>The</b> <b>birds</b> <b>have</b> also suffered from the introduction of mammals such as rats, cats, pigs and goats, as well as from introduced competitors such as common blackbirds and crimson rosellas.|$|E
25|$|Stanley Park {{is home to}} one of {{the largest}} urban great blue heron colonies in North America, and <b>the</b> <b>birds</b> <b>have</b> been {{documented}} nesting in various locations in Stanley Park as far back as 1921. Great blue herons are classified as a species at risk in BC, and the Stanley Park Ecology Society has been monitoring the heronry in Stanley Park since 2004. An estimated 156 young Pacific great blue herons fledged from the colony in 2013. Since monitoring started in 2007, the highest number of great blue herons fledged in a year were 258, in 2007. The lowest number of fledges was in 2011 with just 99 of the birds fledged.|$|E

50|$|Often, a {{cockatiel}} {{sold through}} a pet store {{will have a}} toy in its cage when on display. Purchasing the toy to which <b>the</b> <b>bird</b> <b>has</b> become familiar helps comfort <b>the</b> <b>bird</b> as it adapts to its new surroundings. During times when the owner is {{in the room with}} <b>the</b> <b>bird,</b> <b>the</b> cage door can be left open and, once <b>the</b> <b>bird</b> <b>has</b> become comfortable with the owner's presence, <b>the</b> <b>bird</b> may exit <b>the</b> cage to investigate the owner. Forcing a bird to leave a cage if it's not ready may cause the cockatiel to be less trusting of the owner.|$|R
25|$|Because of {{the long}} human {{experience}} with these conspicuous species, many myths and legends have arisen as a consequence, particularly relating to the barn swallow. The Roman historian Pliny the Elder described a use of painted swallows to deliver {{a report of the}} winning horses at a race. During the nineteenth century, Jean Desbouvrie attempted to tame swallows and train them for use as messenger birds, as an alternative to war pigeons. He succeeded in curbing the migratory instinct in young birds and persuaded the government of France to conduct initial testing, but further experimentation stalled. Subsequent attempts to train homing behaviour into swallows and other passerines had difficulty establishing a statistically significant success rate, although <b>the</b> <b>birds</b> <b>have</b> been known to trap themselves repeatedly in order to obtain bait from traps.|$|E
25|$|On Oahu, a white morph of {{the monarch}} has emerged. This {{is because of}} the introduction, in 1965 and 1966, of two bulbul species, Pycnonotus cafer and Pycnonotus jocosus. They are now the most common {{insectivore}} birds, and probably the only ones preying on insects as large as the monarch. Monarchs in Hawaii are known to have low cardiac glycoside levels, but the birds may also be tolerant of the chemical. The two species hunt the larvae and some pupae from the branches and undersides of leaves in milkweed bushes. The bulbuls also eat resting and ovipositing adults, but rarely flying ones. Because of its color, the white morph has a higher survival rate than the orange one. This is either because of apostatic selection (i.e. <b>the</b> <b>birds</b> <b>have</b> learned the orange monarchs can be eaten), because of camouflage (the white morph matches the white pubescence of milkweed or the patches of light shining through foliage), or because the white morph does not fit the bird's search image of a typical monarch, so is thus avoided.|$|E
25|$|Prey {{is killed}} by hitting {{it with the}} hooked beak, aiming for the skull in vertebrates. If too large to swallow in {{one or a few}} chunks, it is transported to a feeding site by {{carrying}} it in the beak or (if too large) in the feet. The feet are not suited for tearing up prey, however. It is rather impaled upon a sharp point – thorns or the barbs of barbed wire – or wedged firmly between forking branches. Thus secured, the food can be ripped into bite-sized pieces with the beak. Orthoptera that <b>the</b> <b>birds</b> <b>have</b> recognized as containing noxious chemicals are left impaled in the larder for several days, until the chemicals that usually deter predators have been degraded. Great grey shrikes have also been observed to impale common toads (Bufo bufo) and skin them – by ripping open the back skin and pulling it over the head – to avoid contamination of the meat by the toxic skin secretions. Large bones and similar inedible parts of prey animals are usually not ingested, but smaller ones such as tiny bones or the elytra of beetles are eaten and later regurgitated as pellets.|$|E

500|$|In free-range husbandry, {{the birds}} can roam freely {{outdoors}} {{for at least}} part of the day. Often, this is in large enclosures, but <b>the</b> <b>birds</b> <b>have</b> access to natural conditions and can exhibit their normal behaviours. A more intensive system is yarding, in which <b>the</b> <b>birds</b> <b>have</b> access to a fenced yard and poultry house at a higher stocking rate. Poultry can also be kept in a barn system, with no access to the open air, [...] but with the ability to move around freely inside the building. The most intensive system for egg-laying chickens is battery cages, often set in multiple tiers. In these, several birds share a small cage which restricts their ability to move around and behave in a normal manner. The eggs are laid on the floor of the cage and roll into troughs outside for ease of collection. Battery cages for hens have been illegal in the EU since January 1, 2012.|$|E
500|$|The {{fieldfare}} is [...] long, with a grey crown, {{neck and}} rump, a plain brown back, dark wings and tail and white underwings. The breast and flanks are heavily spotted.

The male has a simple chattering song and <b>the</b> <b>birds</b> <b>have</b> various guttural flight and alarm calls.|$|E
500|$|Breeding usually {{involves}} {{some form of}} courtship display, typically performed by the male. Most displays are rather simple and involve some type of song. Some displays, however, are quite elaborate. Depending on the species, these may include wing or tail drumming, dancing, aerial flights, or communal lekking. Females are generally the ones that drive partner selection, although in the polyandrous phalaropes, this is reversed: plainer males choose brightly coloured females. Courtship feeding, billing and [...] are commonly performed between partners, generally after <b>the</b> <b>birds</b> <b>have</b> paired and mated.|$|E

500|$|Pelicans {{frequent}} inland {{and coastal}} waters where they feed principally on fish, catching them {{at or near}} the water surface. They are [...] birds, travelling in flocks, hunting cooperatively and breeding colonially. Four white-plumaged species tend to nest on the ground, and four brown or grey-plumaged species nest mainly in trees. The relationship between pelicans and people has often been contentious. <b>The</b> <b>birds</b> <b>have</b> been persecuted because of their perceived competition with commercial and recreational fishing.

500|$|Desbouvrie {{kept his}} {{swallows}} {{in a cage}} and trained them to fly {{in and out of}} the cage. [...] Another challenge he overcame was the birds' natural migratory behavior.

[...] Desbouvrie refused to make public disclosure of what he fed the birds in wintertime and regarded that as a trade secret. [...] Later attempts to train homing behavior into migratory birds determined that <b>the</b> <b>birds</b> <b>have</b> no instinctive knowledge of where to fly when the season changes, so if the normal migratory pattern is disrupted during the first year of life the individual does not migrate afterward.|$|E
500|$|Some environmentalists were {{concerned}} with the large population of eagles drawn to Homer by Keene. [...] They believed some eagles have been harmed due to their familiarity with people.
