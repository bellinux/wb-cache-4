500|$|As well as Jeff Tracy, English-Canadian actor Peter Dyneley voiced the {{recurring}} character of Commander Norman, chief of {{air traffic control}} at London International Airport. His supporting character voices were typically those of upper-class Englishmen. Shane Rimmer, the voice of Scott, was cast {{on the strength of}} his performance on the BBC soap opera Compact. Meanwhile, fellow Canadian Matt Zimmerman was selected at a late stage in the process. The expatriate West End actor was given the role of Alan on the recommendation of his friend, Holliday: [...] "They were having great difficulty casting the part of Alan as they wanted a certain sound for him, being the youngest brother.

He then moved {{from his home in}} Fairfax Station, Virginia and purchased a second residence, a condominium in Hamilton County's Anderson Township, east of Cincinnati. McEwen drew upon his connections and quickly had high-profile endorsements from Focus on the Family leader James Dobson, former United States Attorney General Edwin Meese, Cincinnati Bengals player Anthony Muñoz, American Family Association president Donald Wildmon, Citizens for Community Values anti-pornography crusader Phil Burress, and former New York congressman Jack Kemp, who came to the district to campaign for him. Kemp said in a rally in Clermont County on May 20 that [...] "Bob and his wife Liz are like part of our family." [...] Dobson wrote in his endorsement letter, [...] "I have rarely been more excited about a candidate running in a highly significant race <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> about Bob McEwen for Congress...

500|$|In 1936 London Films {{released}} Things to Come, {{in which}} Richardson played the swaggering warlord [...] "The Boss". His performance parodied the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini so effectively {{that the film}} was immediately banned in Italy. The producer was Alexander Korda; the two men formed a long and mutually beneficial friendship. Richardson later said of Korda, [...] "Though not so very much older <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> I regarded {{him in a way}} as a father, and to me he was as generous as a prince." [...] In May 1936 Richardson and Olivier jointly directed and starred in a new piece by Priestley, Bees on the Boatdeck. Both actors won excellent notices, but the play, an allegory of Britain's decline, did not attract the public. It closed after four weeks, the last in a succession of West End productions in which Richardson appeared to much acclaim but which were box-office failures. In August of the same year he finally had a long-running star part, the title role in Barré Lyndon's comedy thriller, The Amazing Dr Clitterhouse, which played for 492 performances, closing in October 1937.|$|E

500|$|On September 9, Feldman threw {{seven innings}} of shutout ball against the Cleveland Indians, leading Texas to a 10–0 win. [...] He struck out five, while giving up five singles, raising his record to 16–4, and tying Sabathia and Verlander for the AL lead in victories. [...] He {{became the first}} Rangers pitcher to win 16 games since Kevin Millwood in 2006. [...] It was his seventh win in a row, eighth {{straight}} road victory (a new Texas record), and 12th road win overall in 2009 (another new club record, and tops in the AL). [...] "I'm not doing anything different on the road <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> at home", said Feldman, who had allowed only one run in the last 26.1 innings. [...] "The preparation is the same. [...] I think it's a pretty humbling game, so you can't get too high or too low." [...] He became the first Rangers right-hander to allow just one run over four consecutive starts. [...] Outfielder Marlon Byrd said: [...] "When you have your ace on the mound, you expect to win. You {{get a couple of}} runs early, and you feel you have a 'W' in hand.

500|$|Throughout his term, Scott was {{dogged by}} rumors of heavy {{drinking}} and {{frequent use of}} profanity. On one occasion, an unnamed individual believed his reputation had been injured by something Scott had said and challenged him to a duel. He ignored the challenge, after which the challenger threatened to expose him as a coward. Scott {{was supposed to have}} replied, [...] "Post and be damned; but if you do, you will only post yourself a damned liar, and everybody else will say so." [...] On another occasion, after reviewing a speech written for him by Bledsoe, the governor was said to have remarked, [...] "Well, Mr. Bledsoe, I know you think you are a damned sight smarter <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> and so you are in many respects; but this message as it is now, won't do at all; I'll be damned if it will." [...] When Bledsoe asked what was wrong with the speech, he reportedly replied, [...] "Why, damn it to hell, why don't you put a good solemn prayer at the end of it, and talk about Providence, and the protection of Heaven, and all that?" [...] After the governor campaigned for Humphrey Marshall's opponent in the 1809 legislative elections, Marshall published an article in the Western World newspaper that accused him of appearing in front of the court house drunk on election day.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to the regular cast members, episodes feature guest voices from many ranges of professions, including actors, musicians, and artists. Former McHale's Navy actors Ernest Borgnine and Tim Conway reunited for their first joint TV project in 33 years as guest actors portraying SpongeBob's favorite superheroes, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, respectively. Borgnine said [...] "We [...] played off each other. Tim's such a performer - a little more caustic <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>am.</b> We were making all sorts of noise.

500|$|The new Constitution {{empowered}} {{the president}} to appoint executive department heads {{with the consent of}} the Senate. Three departments had existed under the Articles of Confederation: the Department of War, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Finance Office. The Department of War was retained, while the latter two departments became the Department of State and the Department of the Treasury, respectively. The leaders of these three departments constituted the initial positions in Washington's cabinet. In September 1789, Congress established the position of Attorney General to serve as the chief legal adviser to the president. Though the Attorney General did not oversee a department (the United States Department of Justice would be established in 1870), the position nonetheless became a part of the cabinet. Edmund Randolph became the first Attorney General, while Henry Knox retained his position as head of the Department of War and Thomas Jefferson served as the first Secretary of State. For the key post of Secretary of the Treasury, which would oversee economic policy, Washington chose Alexander Hamilton, after his first choice, Robert Morris, declined. Morris had recommended Hamilton instead, writing [...] "But, my dear general, you will be no loser by my declining the secrataryship of the Treasury, for I can recommend a far cleverer fellow <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> for your minister of finance in the person of your aide-de-camp, Colonel Hamilton." [...] Washington's initial cabinet consisted of one individual from New England (Knox), one individual from the mid-Atlantic (Hamilton), and two Southerners (Jefferson and Randolph).|$|E

[...] When he was asked whether [...] is an intolerant position, he said that [...] "through the merits of Jesus' sacrifice... even people who don't know Jesus are able to be saved, but through him."
