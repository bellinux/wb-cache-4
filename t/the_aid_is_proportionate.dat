50|$|In February 2012, the European Commission {{announced}} that it had launched an investigation to examine if public subsidies given to La Rochelle Airport, as well as marketing deals between La Rochelle Airport and various airlines, breached EU rules on state <b>aid.</b> In particular, <b>the</b> Commission would examine if public subsidies worth €3 million received between 2002 and 2005 by the airport operator to finance infrastructure projects at La Rochelle airport were necessary {{to carry out the}} investment, whether <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> <b>was</b> <b>proportionate</b> to <b>the</b> objectives pursued and whether the infrastructure had satisfactory medium-term prospects for use. The Commission would also look into cash advances worth €8 million granted to the airport operator since 2002 and marketing support contracts and discounts on airport charges for new routes given to various airlines.|$|R

50|$|Some {{think tanks}} and NGOs {{have argued that}} Western {{monetary}} aid often only serves to increase poverty and social inequality, either because it is conditioned {{with the implementation of}} harmful economic policies in the recipient countries, or because it's tied with the importing of products from the donor country over cheaper alternatives. Sometimes foreign <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> seen to be serving the interests of the donor more than the recipient, and critics also argue that some of <b>the</b> foreign <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> stolen by corrupt governments and officials, and that higher <b>aid</b> levels erode <b>the</b> quality of governance. Policy becomes much more oriented toward what will get more aid money than it does towards meeting the needs of the people. Problems with <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> system and not <b>aid</b> itself <b>are</b> that <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> excessively directed towards the salaries of consultants from donor countries, <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> not spread properly, neglecting vital, less publicized area such as agriculture, and <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> not properly coordinated among donors, leading to a plethora of disconnected projects rather than unified strategies.|$|R
50|$|Closer {{investigation}} {{of many of}} the promises made at Gleneagles reveals that some of <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> funds <b>were</b> rehashed versions of aid already pledged and <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> <b>was</b> often used to privatise public services to businesses based in the donor country.

40|$|It {{is often}} assumed that two heads {{are better than}} one, but {{reliance}} on decision <b>aids</b> <b>is</b> often inappropriate. Decisions to rely on an <b>aid</b> <b>are</b> thought {{to be based on}} a comparison between the perceived reliability of own performance and that of <b>the</b> decision <b>aid.</b> Unfortunately, perceived reliabilities are unlikely to be perfectly calibrated. This may result in inappropriate decisions to rely on advice. In a laboratory experiment with 40 participants, we studied whether calibration improves after practice, whether calibration of own reliability differs from calibration of <b>the</b> <b>aid’s</b> reliability and whether unreliability of <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> attributed differently. Under-trust in own reliability disappears after practice but under-trust in <b>the</b> <b>aid’s</b> reliability persists. Unreliability of <b>the</b> decision <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> less likely to be attributed to temporary, external and uncontrollable factors. This asymmetry in attribution and calibration may explain under-reliance on decision aids...|$|R

40|$|Public aids towards {{renewable}} energy sources in Spain have had the consequence of a great increase in their use. This is particularly true for the case of wind generation.
