5|$|At this time, the {{efficacy}} of the Chapman–Jouguet model was still in doubt, and it was the subject of studies by John von Neumann at the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study. Kistiakowsky realized that the deviations from hydrodynamic theory were the result of the speed of the chemical reactions themselves. To control the reaction, calculations down to the microsecond level were needed. Section 8 was drawn into the investigation of shaped charges, whose mechanism was explained by Taylor and James <b>Tuck</b> <b>in</b> 1943.|$|E

25|$|In 1893, Edward Newall Tuck was {{appointed}} by the Education Committee of the Borough of Chippenham to organise technical classes in Chippenham and district. Classes were held in rented premises at No. 21 London Road and at the Jubilee Institute, {{as well as in}} villages including Grittleton and Yatton Keynell. Teachers from elementary schools attended classes in a School of Art on Saturdays at the Jubilee Institute. Mr <b>Tuck,</b> <b>in</b> addition, gave talks on Wiltshire history and nature study; he also served as town councillor and was Mayor of Chippenham from 1931 to 1932. In 1894, pupils were not admitted to classes until they reached the age of 11. Pupils from day schools were admitted free from age 11 to 16. The fees at this time were fixed at 6d per month, the whole expenses of the school being met by fees and grants from the Science and Art Department and the County Council. Higher grade classes for boys, including Woodwork and Chemistry, were held at No. 21 London Road.|$|E

500|$|Drake's {{shirt is}} always tucked {{into his pants}} on only one side, an {{attribute}} which commentators have labeled the [...] "half-tuck". The term, first coined by video game designer Tim Schafer, led to Naughty Dog altering Drake's appearance to have his shirt almost <b>tucked</b> <b>in</b> from the front, and half <b>tucked</b> <b>in</b> at the back, an inside joke Naughty Dog co-president Evan Wells labeled a [...] "three-quarters-tuck." [...] The half-tuck {{was part of a}} larger effort to ensure Drake's design was asymmetrical. Tim Schafer commented [...] "It was all super next-gen, but the most next-gen thing about it to me was Drake's shirt. Check it out: Somehow it's <b>tucked</b> <b>in,</b> and yet not <b>tucked</b> <b>in,</b> at the very same time. Of all the technical marvels contained in Uncharted, this was the one that really mystified me." ...|$|R

25|$|On {{the ensuing}} kickoff, after both teams {{lined up in}} regular kickoff formations, Akers placed an onside kick {{on the left side}} of the field, which was caught by WR Riley Cooper and {{advanced}} to the Eagles' 43-yard line. Particularly noteworthy about the play was the fact that the Eagles only had 10 men on the field – four to Akers' right and five to his left — and that the Giants' front line of blockers on the return was lined up 15 yards away from the tee, rather than the usual 10. It was unclear whether the Eagles intentionally had only 10 men on the field, as Giants special teams captain Chase Blackburn stated after the game that he believed it was on purpose. On the second play of the ensuing drive, Vick escaped a New York blitz and rushed all the way down to the Giants' six-yard line. After two incomplete passes, with an offsides on <b>Tuck</b> <b>in</b> between, Vick ran the ball into the end zone on third and goal from the four-yard line, making the score 31–24 with 5:28 left in the game.|$|E

500|$|Imagination is {{generally}} thought of by historians {{of science fiction}} {{as one of the}} weaker magazines of the 1950s, despite its relative longevity. Donald <b>Tuck,</b> <b>in</b> his Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy, dismissed the novels it published, saying, [...] "not many were noteworthy, most being in the interplanetary/space opera/adventure field", and Brian Stableford, a science fiction writer and critic, described it as dealing [...] "primarily in routine space opera." [...] James Blish, writing under the pseudonym [...] "William Atheling, Jr.", which he used for some of his critical writing, remarked that it was a [...] "widely unread" [...] magazine. Hamling's editorial policy was consciously slanted against intellectualism. In the November 1951 issue he commented that [...] "science fiction was never meant to be an educational tour de force. The so-called adult story is nothing more than an attempt to show the reader how dumb he is and how smart the editor is." [...] Imaginations approach, he said, was to publish entertainment: [...] "What we need is a little relaxation. And entertaining reading is one way to get it." [...] Some readers agreed with Hamling; a 1952 issue of Rhodomagnetic Digest, a fanzine, contains approving commentary on Hamling's editorial by Gregg Calkins, a fan of the period.|$|E
500|$|On August 3, 2015, the Toronto Raptors {{unveiled}} {{four new}} uniforms. The uniforms were released {{in partnership with}} 2K Sports' NBA 2K16 video game. The team said in a press release the new uniform designs were intended {{to pay tribute to}} the city of Toronto and to Canada as a whole, noting that the Raptors were the sole Canadian club in the NBA since the Grizzlies' move to Memphis. The main colours would remain centred on Canada's national colours of red and white, whereas black and silver will continue to be used for trim on the white home and red road uniforms. The uniforms themselves underwent changes. Most notably, the chevrons on the side panels now point up, which the team said aligns with its current slogan of [...] "We The North". Since being introduced as a uniform accent in 1999, the chevrons had pointed downward, the team said. In addition, at the waist-level hem of the jersey is an upside-down tag with the team's [...] "We The North" [...] slogan. The team said the slogan on the tag will be visible to players when they <b>tuck</b> <b>in</b> their jersey. Additionally, the shorts now feature a maple leaf logo {{on the front of the}} waistband, and the letter [...] "T" [...] is now on the sides of the shorts, with the Raptors' basketball claw logo below it. This is a reference to the city of Toronto's [...] "T-Dot" [...] nickname.|$|E
500|$|In 1976, Barker played Friar <b>Tuck</b> <b>in</b> {{the film}} Robin and Marian, {{directed}} by Richard Lester. The same year, {{determined not to}} be remembered only as Fletcher, Barker opted to end Porridge after two series and instead focused on the second pilot Open All Hours, alongside David Jason. Barker starred as Arkwright, a money-grabbing, stuttering shopkeeper. Arkwright's stutter {{was not in the}} script; Barker was inspired to use it by Melvyn's performance and use of a stutter in a 1955 play the two performed at the Palace Theatre called Hot Water. Open All Hours aired one series in 1976 on BBC Two but was not renewed due to low ratings. As a result, Barker backtracked on his earlier decision and produced a third series of Porridge, as well as a film adaptation. It was followed by the spin-off sitcom Going Straight which focused on Fletcher after his release from prison. While not as popular as Porridge, Barker again won the BAFTA for Best Light Entertainment Performance. Plans to further the show were ended when Barker's co-star Richard Beckinsale {{died of a heart attack}} in 1979 aged 31. [...] With repeats of Open All Hours earning high ratings on BBC One, the BBC commissioned a further series of the show in 1981, with another two made as well as the show continued its ratings success. [...] Both shows placed in the top ten of the 2004 poll to determine Britain's Best Sitcom; Porridge finished seventh and Open All Hours eighth.|$|E

500|$|Jeff Killed John was the forerunner band to Bullet for My Valentine and {{was formed}} in 1998 by Matthew Tuck, Michael [...] "Padge" [...] Paget, Nick Crandle, and Michael [...] "Moose" [...] Thomas while {{studying}} music at Bridgend College. They started playing Nirvana and Metallica cover songs. In 1999, the band released their first ever EP, Better Off Alone. They released another two-track EP in 2002, You/Play with Me, which was produced by Greg Haver. The EP was financed through the Pynci scheme for new Welsh musicians and the release garnered radio airplay on BBC Radio 1's broadcast at Newport's T.J.'s. Jeff Killed John's music followed the nu metal trend set by bands such as Korn and Limp Bizkit. Shortly after, the band released another two-track EP titled Eye Spy. In 2003, their second EP was released titled Don't Walk Away. This was a promotional CD and was shipped to different record companies, {{as well as being}} given out locally in Bridgend. Bassist Crandle left the band on the eve of entering the recording sessions for the band's self-titled EP and was replaced by Jason James. The band then changed their name to Bullet for My Valentine and reworked their musical strategy; they decided to play heavy metal songs with [...] "harmony guitars and big angelic choruses," [...] according to frontman <b>Tuck.</b> <b>In</b> late 2003, they released their final EP before record labels actually began to notice their potential. This happened due to the sudden change in their strategy and sound, which the band claims came [...] "directly out of their heads." [...] Their self-titled EP consisted of five songs; most of the songs became precursors of tracks from The Poison.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the run-up}} to the 2005 NFL Draft, Tuck also {{recorded}} a wind-aided 4.56 in the 40-yard dash as well as a 380-pound bench press, 560-pound squat, and a 336-pound power clean. Pre-draft reports contended that the knee injury would keep teams from taking <b>Tuck</b> <b>in</b> the first round. He was known as [...] "terrific athlete who is a disruptive force up the field. Breaks down well playing with leverage, rarely off his feet and tough to move from his angle of attack," [...] and [...] "an extremely quick and agile player who possesses very good strength for a player of his size." ...|$|E

2500|$|Separate (non integral) hoods are of two types: {{one which}} extends {{only to the}} base of the neck, and the other a {{standard}} wetsuit hood with a large flange. Hoods are never tucked into the neck seal as they would be tucked into a wetsuit, as this would compromise the watertight integrity of the seal. Some suits are designed with a second (non-watertight) [...] "warm neck collar" [...] around the neck seal, which allows the flange of a standard wetsuit hood to <b>tuck</b> <b>in</b> around the outside of the seal. This can keep the neck significantly warmer, since the seal itself provides little insulation.|$|E

Safeway is an early example, and the victory of eight children in a suit against their Lafayette, Louisiana school was a landmark decision in favor of Rastafari rights.

Yanez said, “Okay, don't reach for it, then ... don't pull it out.” Castile responded, “I'm not pulling it out,” and Reynolds also said, “He's not pulling it out.” Yanez repeated, raising his voice, “Don't pull it out!"
