40|$|This article investigates how slums {{are made}} into a tourism attraction. We focus in {{particular}} {{on the role of}} <b>tour</b> <b>guides</b> and <b>tour</b> <b>guiding</b> operations in this process. In the tourism literature in general <b>tour</b> <b>guiding</b> has been subject to much reflection and debate. However, tour guides' role in enabling tourism in new places, in the making of attractions, has not been discussed much. Also, in the emerging research on slum tourism little attention has been given to <b>tour</b> <b>guides</b> and their roles. This article addresses both research gaps in providing insights into <b>tour</b> <b>guiding</b> in slum tourism, and by addressing the roles of <b>tour</b> <b>guides</b> in attraction making through a comparative analysis of tourism in two slums: Dharavi, in Mumbai, India, and Kibera, in Nairobi, Kenya. Based on empirical research of <b>tour</b> <b>guiding</b> operations we found that different levels of formality in <b>tour</b> <b>guiding</b> coexist across destinations. Formal <b>tour</b> <b>guiding</b> operations are more successful in establishing a slum as an attraction as they enable significant growth in tourist numbers. However, formal <b>tour</b> <b>guiding</b> operations and strong international participation in their foundation are factors that seem to undermine to some extent the creation of intimate and authentic encounters in <b>tour</b> <b>guiding,</b> preferred by some tourists. This leaves space for more informal <b>tour</b> <b>guiding,</b> with strong local ties, which are better placed to produce intimate experiences. Peer-reviewedPost-prin...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} improve service quality, many service centers (SCs) in tourism and leisure {{industry}} arrange a lot of activities and provide some <b>tour</b> <b>guides</b> to lead tourists through the tour process. An {{increase in the number}} of <b>tour</b> <b>guides</b> generally leads to better service quality. However, more <b>tour</b> <b>guides</b> also result in more cost for SCc. To cut cost, a time-based system which pays wages to employees according to their service hours is commonly adopted in recent years. Consequently, a schedule of <b>tour</b> <b>guides</b> with an objective of minimizing service hours is greatly needed. In this paper, we apply the genetic algorithm (GA) to schedule <b>tour</b> <b>guides</b> of SCc for tourism and leisure industry. Optimal parameters including crossover rates and mutation rates that generate the best performance experimentally are obtained. Experimental results show that GA is effective to schedule the <b>tour</b> <b>guides</b> of SCs. In addition, a penalty function is useful to increase the on-time service rates of visitor orders. 1...|$|R

40|$|The study dealt on the {{perceptions}} of three stakeholder groups {{on the status of}} <b>tour</b> <b>guiding</b> in Baguio City. The three groups are the government sector represented by the Department of Tourism in Baguio City; the private sector represented by three travel agencies in the city and representatives from the tourist guide association.

The situation of <b>tour</b> <b>guiding</b> in the city is, however, grim as there is very little work for <b>tour</b> <b>guides.</b> The factors that have led to this grim state are: the seasonal nature of the tourism industry when very few visitors come, stiff competition from unlicensed <b>tour</b> <b>guides,</b> lack of coordination between industry stakeholders; and lack of government support in terms of implementation of regulations and legislation that will protect the rights of Baguio <b>tour</b> <b>guides.</b> As recommendations, the city council must study the merits of Resolution No. 001 submitted by the Association of <b>Tour</b> <b>Guides</b> of Baguio and Benguet, Inc. and make revisions where necessary so that corresponding legislation can be passed.

5|$|In 1920, {{while still}} {{attending}} high school, Cooper took three art courses at Montana Agricultural College in Bozeman. His interest in art was inspired years earlier by the Western paintings of Charles Marion Russell and Frederic Remington. Cooper especially admired and studied Russell's Lewis and Clark Meeting Indians at Ross' Hole (1910), which still {{hangs in the}} state capitol building in Helena. In 1922, Cooper enrolled in Grinnell College in Iowa to continue his art education. Cooper did well academically in most of his courses, but was not accepted to the school's drama club. His drawings and watercolors were exhibited throughout the dormitory, and he was named art editor for the college yearbook. During the summers of 1922 and 1923, Cooper worked at Yellowstone National Park as a <b>tour</b> <b>guide</b> driving the yellow open-top buses.

40|$|<b>Tour</b> <b>guides</b> {{are one of}} {{the most}} visible players in tourism but little {{scholarly}} attention has been given to the links that <b>tour</b> <b>guides</b> may have with sustainable development. This study addresses the gap by promoting an understanding of how <b>tour</b> <b>guides</b> can assist in moving tourism in a sustainable direction. Sustainable development is expected to improve the quality of life for all people without causing undesirable ecological and socio-cultural outcomes. As a central agent in the entire tourism system, <b>tour</b> <b>guides</b> have a variety of roles to play in response to the expectations of the various tourism stakeholders. A literature review suggests that <b>tour</b> <b>guides</b> can contribute to destinations'sustainable development by exerting their functions on experience management, resources management and local economic promotion. Interpretative guiding is the means by which <b>tour</b> <b>guides</b> can realize these above potentials. A case study was conducted in Hainan, China. The guiding performance there was examined to see whether and to what extent <b>tour</b> <b>guides</b> are contributing to the achievement of local sustainability. It was discovered that the <b>tour</b> <b>guides</b> in Hainan do not exert (well) their expected functions either in enhancing enjoyable experiences for tourists, in supporting local resource conservation, or in promoting the healthy development of the local economy. Their potentials are blocked by the issues and problems of instant money-making-centered guiding conduct, below-cost group receiving industry practices and unfair remuneration system for the guides, absence of protection measures to ensure the guides’ interests, opportunism in guiding and lenient certificating requirements, lack of professionalism and effective training, ineffective monitoring measures, and limited awareness of sustainable development. In order to better the situation, unhealthy travel and trade industry practice should be banned; effective certificating, training and monitoring measures should be developed and implemented; tour guides’ personal interests should be protected and local awareness of sustainability, in particular that of the industry members, should be fostered. Serious efforts of the government administration as well as industry members and <b>tour</b> <b>guides</b> are required if <b>tour</b> <b>guides</b> are to fulfill their potential as agents of sustainable development...|$|R

5|$|Many {{politicians}} {{with strong}} personalities {{and a powerful}} attachment to the institution of Congress are reputed still to roam the halls of Congress long after their deaths. The shades of Representative Joseph Cannon (R-Ill. and Speaker from 1903 to 1911) and Rep. Champ Clark (D-Mo. and Speaker from 1911 to 1919) are claimed to occasionally return to the dark chamber of the House of Representatives after midnight and, after a loud rap from a gavel, resume the strong, angry debates they once had in life. Members of the United States Capitol Police have claimed to have seen Senator (and from 1852 to 1854, Representative) Thomas Hart Benton sitting at a desk in National Statuary Hall, although {{it has not been}} used as a legislative chamber since 1857. Steve Livengood, chief <b>tour</b> <b>guide</b> for the United States Capitol Historical Society, says he has seen the ghost of former Representative Wilbur Mills (D-Ark.) near Mills' former office late at night. Pierre Charles L'Enfant, although not a politician, was a brevet Major during the American Revolutionary War who served with George Washington at Valley Forge. In 1791, L'Enfant was appointed architect and planner of the new city of Washington in the District of Columbia. Although L'Enfant submitted grandiose plans for the new capital city, his plans were never fully adopted and President Washington dismissed him. L'Enfant spent {{much of the rest of}} his life attempting to wrest a monetary payment from Congress, and he died in poverty in 1825. Eyewitnesses, however, claim to have seen his spirit walking through the Capitol, head down, murmuring to himself, with the plans for the capital city tucked under his arm.|$|E
