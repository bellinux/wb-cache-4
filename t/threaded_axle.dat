40|$|International audienceA two-station [2]rotaxane, {{consisting}} of a dibenzo- 24 -crown- 8 macrocycle which surrounds a molecular axle containing an anilinium and a mono-substituted pyridinium amide molecular stations, has been synthesized via the alkyne-azide "click chemistry". The subsequent N-benzylation of the triazole moiety, which {{is located in the}} middle of the <b>threaded</b> <b>axle,</b> was then envisaged. In addition to affording a third molecular station (i. e. a triazolium station) for the macrocycle dibenzo- 24 -crown- 8 (DB 24 C 8), it was found that the benzyl moiety behaves as a kinetic molecular barrier which prevents the DB 24 C 8 from shuttling along the molecular encircled axle from one extremity to the other. Depending on where the DB 24 C 8 is initially located, the N-benzylation of the triazole allows to trap the DB 24 C 8 either on the "left" or the "right" side of the thread with respect to the triazolium station. The presence of the benzyl barrier thus affords two different three-station [2]rotaxane molecular machines, in which some of co conformational states remain unbalanced and not at the equilibrium...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{reports on}} the {{synthesis}} of a tri-stable [2]rotaxane molecular shuttle, in which {{the motion of the}} macrocycle is triggered by either selective protonation/deprotonation or specific carbamoylation/decarbamoylation of an alkylbenzylamine. The <b>threaded</b> <b>axle</b> is surrounded by a dibenzo[24]crown[8] (DB 24 C 8) macrocycle and contains three sites of different binding affinities towards the macrocycle. An N-methyltriazolium moiety acts as a molecular station that has weak affinity for the DB 24 C 8 macrocycle and is located in the centre of the molecular axle. Two other molecular stations, arylammonium and alkylbenzylammonium moieties, sit {{on either side of the}} triazolium moiety along the molecular axle and have stronger affinities for the DB 24 C 8 macrocycle. These two ammonium moieties are covalently linked to two different stopper groups at each extremity of the thread: a tert-butylphenyl group and a substituted DB 24 C 8 unit. Owing to steric hindrance, the former does not allow any π–π stacking interactions with the encircling DB 24 C 8 macrocycle, whereas the latter residue does; therefore, this allows the discrimination of the two ammonium stations by the surrounding DB 24 C 8 macrocycle in the fully protonated state. In the deprotonated state, the contrasting reactivity of the amine functional groups, as either a base or a nucleophile, allows for selective reactions that trigger the controlled shuttling of the macrocycle around the three molecular stations...|$|E

40|$|A {{series of}} [4]pseudorotaxanes {{composed}} of three-way <b>axle</b> <b>threads</b> {{based on the}} cyclotriguaiacylene family of crown-shaped cavitands and three threaded macrocyclic components has been achieved. These exploit the strong affinity for electron-poor alkyl-pyridinium units to reside within the electron-rich cavity of macrocycles, in this case dimethoxypillar[5]arene (DMP). The branched [4]pseudorotaxane= assemblies {(DMP) 3 ∙L} 3 +,where L = N-alkylated derivatives of the host molecule (±) -tris-(isonicotinoyl) cyclotriguaiacylene, were characterised by NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry, and an energy-minimised structure of {(DMP) 3 ∙(tris-(N-propyl-isonicotinoyl) cyclotriguaiacylene) } 3 + was calculated.

5000|$|Freewheels are <b>threaded</b> onto an <b>axle</b> hub, using {{conventional}} right-hand threads. As {{the bicycle}} rider pedals, the freewheel is continuously kept tight, as chain torque {{is in the}} right-hand direction. This becomes a problem when the freewheel needs to be removed. Having undergone high torque from leg muscles, {{it is difficult to}} loosen and remove the freewheels. A freehub, on the other hand, has cogs that slide onto an axially-splined cylindrical outer shell. A lockring or the last cog(s) are threaded onto the freehub. It is fastened to the wheel hub itself with a hollow retaining screw (for example, using a hex key on some models) through which the axle is inserted during operation.|$|R
40|$|Template {{approaches}} to rotaxanes normally require at least n - 1 template sites to interlock n components. Here {{we describe the}} one-pot synthesis of [3]rotaxanes in which a single metal template site induces formation of axles through each cavity of a bicyclic macrocycle. Central to the approach is that {{a portion of the}} bicyclic molecule acts as a ligand for a transition metal ion that mediates covalent bond formation through one or other macrocyclic cavity, depending on the ligand's orientation, making a mechanical bond. The ligand can then rotate so that the transition metal can catalyze the formation of a second axle through the other macrocycle. Using this strategy with the Cu(I) -catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (the CuAAC reaction) generates a [3]rotaxane with two identical axles in up to 86 % yield. [3]Rotaxanes with two different <b>axles</b> <b>threaded</b> through the macrobicyclic rings can also be created using a single template site, either by having copper(I) sequentially form both mechanical bonds (via the CuAAC reaction) using different sets of building blocks for each axle or by using two different reactions catalyzed by two different metal ions: a palladium(II) -mediated alkyne homocoupling to assemble the first thread through one cavity, followed by a copper(I) -mediated CuAAC reaction to form the second axle through the other ring...|$|R
40|$|The {{widespread}} {{utilization of}} sub-molecular motion in key biological processes is inspiring chemists who synthesize molecular machines able {{to imitate the}} machinery of biological world. It has been proved possible to design synthetic molecular systems in which positional displacements of sub-molecular components occur upon the application of external stimuli. 1 - 3 The architecture of synthetic systems is crucial to translate molecular level effects into a useful response exploitable in the macroscopic world. Pioneering works 1 - 2 have shown that rotaxanes (molecules consisting of a ring <b>threaded</b> onto an <b>axle</b> capped with bulky end-stoppers) are a particularly promising kind of synthetic 'molecular shuttles'. Although nanodevices based on molecular machines have been conceived, {{there is a huge}} gap between those exploratory studies and truly functional systems, able to use an external source of energy to induce a directional motion and perform useful tasks. 4 One of the major challenges is the interfacing between the molecular machines and the outside world. Here we to demonstrate the feasibility of transducing sub-molecular movements into mechanical work by combining the controlled translational motion of the ring in a rotaxane coupled to a polymer chain, and the ability of AFM-based single molecule force spectroscopy {{to be used as a}} mechanical device. 5 For that purpose, a rotaxane with a long thread and two stations onto which the ring can bind through H-bonds was synthesized. We have attached a polymer chain to the ring and the resulting system was grafted onto substrates. We then fished the polymer chain with an AFM tip and realized single molecule pulling-relaxing cycles. The ring was moved away from the most stable station along the thread and was found to shuttle back to this station against the external force, thus delivering mechanical work against the AFM cantilever. We have estimated the work done by the ring and show that the value is in good agreement with predicted theoretical values. 2 1 	J. F. Stoddart et al., Special Issue on Molecular Machines, Acc. Chem.
