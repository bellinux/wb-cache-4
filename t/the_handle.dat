40|$|AbstractIndustrial {{grippers}} play {{an important}} role within automated production and assembly processes. In most cases their selection and dimensioning is done experience-based. This article presents an approach to dimension grippers automatically based on the properties of <b>the</b> <b>handling</b> object, <b>the</b> <b>handling</b> environment, <b>the</b> <b>handling</b> device and <b>the</b> <b>handling</b> process. Special attention is paid to the adaption of the operational elements, which interact with <b>the</b> <b>handling</b> object, like suction cups or jaws...|$|R
50|$|The user {{holds the}} gripper {{in one hand}} and squeezes <b>the</b> two <b>handles</b> {{together}} until they touch. Once touched, <b>the</b> <b>handles</b> are released and the movement is repeated. Variations of this basic movement include negatives below, and a variety of partial movements. For example, if the strength of the gripper is beyond that of the user, the user might apply maximum force, moving <b>the</b> <b>handles</b> as far as possible, even if <b>the</b> <b>handles</b> cannot be made to touch. Another partial movement involves using two hands to squeeze <b>the</b> <b>handles</b> within approximately 19 mm (3/4 inch) of each other, releasing one hand and then using the other hand to make <b>the</b> <b>handles</b> of <b>the</b> gripper touch each other. Negatives involve starting <b>the</b> gripper <b>handles</b> touching and then resisting as the gripper opens up, in an eccentric contraction.|$|R

5|$|The new {{grandstand}} {{was completed}} for $3.6 million in 1993. Since Rosecroft had expanded its simulcasting rights, the new grandstand incorporated large-screen televisions and betting windows. For the 1993 season, Rosecroft's officials {{decided to stop}} hosting the five stake races—The Potomac, the Lady Baltimore, The Terrapan, The Turtle Dove, and The North American—inherited when Freestate Raceway closed. <b>The</b> <b>handle</b> was decreasing, and the officials could not afford the purses for the races. To help increase <b>the</b> <b>handle,</b> Maryland racetrack officials voted to allow inter-track simulcasting between all Maryland tracks and authorized off-track betting parlors throughout the state.|$|E
5|$|The {{vertical}} {{line on the}} sight was relatively short, {{and could not be}} used directly to measure drift – unlike the long drift wires of the CSBS it replaced. To address this, the collimator handle could be used to manually rotate the sighting assembly forward, allowing the bomb aimer to point the sight further in front of the aircraft's location. This allowed the bomb aimer to select any convenient object on the ground for drift measurements, including the target itself, long before the aircraft reached it. Through periodic movements of <b>the</b> <b>handle,</b> the bomb aimer could ensure the drift line continued to pass through the target. When <b>the</b> <b>handle</b> was returned to the resting position and released, the shaft to the computor automatically re-engaged and started tracking the proper range angle again. <b>The</b> <b>handle</b> was also used to rotate the collimator forward for storage.|$|E

Six {{years later in}} 1837, the Emanuel Brothers sold the Nassak Diamond at a public sale to Robert Grosvenor, the 1st Marquess of Westminster. At one point, the Marquess mounted the diamond in <b>the</b> <b>handle</b> of his dress sword. In 1886, the diamond was valued at between 30,000 and 40,000 pounds (today between £ and £), {{due in part to}} its vast gain in brilliancy from the re-cut by Rundell and Bridge.|$|E

5|$|The Grenade, Hand, Anti-Tank No. 74, {{commonly}} known as the S.T. Grenade or sticky bomb, was a British hand grenade designed and produced during the Second World War. The grenade was {{one of a number of}} anti-tank weapons developed for use by the British Army and Home Guard as an ad hoc solution to a lack of sufficient anti-tank guns in the aftermath of the Dunkirk evacuation. Designed by a team from MIR(c) including Major Millis Jefferis and Stuart Macrae, the grenade consisted of a glass sphere containing an explosive made of nitroglycerin and additives (this added stability to the mix, as well as giving it its squash-head-like effect) covered in a strong adhesive and surrounded by a sheet-metal casing. When the user pulled a pin on <b>the</b> <b>handle</b> of the grenade, the casing would fall away and expose the sticky sphere. Pulling another pin would arm the firing mechanism and the user would then attempt to attach the grenade to an enemy tank or other vehicle. Letting go of <b>the</b> <b>handle</b> would release a lever that would activate a five-second fuse, which would then detonate the nitroglycerin.|$|E

40|$|The {{reasons for}} {{necessity}} of automation in industrial production are well known. Approximately 80 % {{of the total}} production time of nearly every production process is used for material handling, so {{it seems reasonable to}} use automated systems, e. g., industrial robots, for <b>the</b> <b>handling</b> tasks. <b>The</b> <b>handling</b> of workpieces depends mainly on the behavior of the material. Generally materials are charcterized as one of two different kinds: limp and rigid. The requirements of robot systems are completely different for these two kinds of materials. To explain <b>the</b> <b>handling</b> of limp materials we look at the apparel industry and the wire industry. To explain <b>the</b> <b>handling</b> of rigid but soft materials we look at the woodworking industry...|$|R

Cayce, along with an American computer security specialist, Boone Chu, hired to assist her, travels to Tokyo to meet the man and retrieve the watermark code. Two men attempt to steal the code but Cayce escapes and travels back to London. Boone travels to Columbus, Ohio to investigate the company that he believes created the watermark. Meanwhile, Blue Ant hires Dorotea who reveals that she was previously employed by a Russian lawyer whose clients have been investigating Cayce. The clients wanted Cayce to refuse the job of tracking the film clips and it was Dorotea's responsibility to ensure this.|$|E
5|$|A new bow type, {{in which}} bone {{reinforcements}} cover <b>the</b> <b>handle</b> {{of the bow}} {{as well as the}} tips, may have developed in Central Asia during the 3rd to 2nd century BCE, with earliest finds from the area of Lake Baikal. Fittings from this type of bow appear right across Asia from Korea to the Crimea. Such bows with reinforcement of both grip and siyahs have been called “Hun,” “Hunnic” or “Hsiung-nu” composite bows. Huns did use such bows, but so did many other peoples; Rausing termed this type the 'Qum-Darya Bow' from the Han Chinese type-site at the frontier post of Loulan, {{at the mouth of the}} Qum Darya river, dated by analogy between c. 1st century BCE and the 3rd century CE.|$|E

5|$|Another {{historically}} notable {{replica of}} Szczerbiec was produced probably in Dresden, Saxony, {{at the time}} when the original was in Prussian hands. It is modest and inexact; <b>the</b> <b>handle</b> is carved in bovine bone and the niello is imitated with black paint. Designs on <b>the</b> <b>handle</b> are patterned on those of the genuine Szczerbiec, except that the crosses and letters on the pommel were replaced with the coat of arms of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. The blade was initially shorter than that of the original, actually typical for a stiletto. It was purchased in Dresden by art historian Edward Rastawiecki, who in 1869 donated it to the archeological collection of the Jagiellonian University of Kraków. The university lost it during the German occupation in World War II. After the war, the replica found itself in the hands of Tadeusz Janowski who smuggled it to the United States in 1947. At around that time, the short stiletto blade was replaced with a long blade of a 16th-century German sword. To imitate Szczerbiec, a slit was cut in the blade and small heraldic shields were attached to it on both sides. During the communist rule in Poland, the Polish American community of Chicago treated the replica as a symbol of Poland's independence. In 1968, it was demonstrated to U.S. Senator Robert F. Kennedy while he was meeting with Polish Americans during his presidential campaign. Janowski returned the sword to the Jagiellonian University in 2003.|$|E

He stood with his heels almost together and the toes of his left foot pointing toward extra cover, which left him open-chested when facing the bowler. A noticeable flourish in his backlift enabled him to follow the swinging delivery and play it late if necessary. His first movement was back and across the crease to cover the stumps from the view of the bowler, putting him in position to play the hook, leg glance, sweep and his favourite square cut shot.|$|E
