5|$|Sugar was {{a luxury}} in Europe until the 18th century, {{when it became}} more widely available. It then became popular and by the 19th century, sugar came to be {{considered}} a necessity. This evolution of taste and demand for sugar as an essential food ingredient unleashed major economic and social changes. It drove, in part, colonization of tropical islands and nations where labor-intensive sugarcane plantations and sugar manufacturing could thrive. <b>The</b> <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> cheap labor to perform the hard work involved in its cultivation and processing increased <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> the slave trade from Africa (in particular West Africa). After slavery was abolished, there was high demand for indentured laborers from South Asia (in particular India). Millions of slave and indentured laborers were brought into the Caribbean and the Americas, Indian Ocean colonies, southeast Asia, Pacific Islands, and East Africa and Natal. The modern ethnic mix of many nations that have been settled in the last two centuries has been influenced by <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> sugar.|$|E

The introduction of the three-way catalytic converter by Volvo in 1976 increased <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> rhodium. The previous catalytic converters used platinum or palladium, while the three-way catalytic converter used rhodium to reduce the amount of NOx in the exhaust.|$|E

5|$|Between 1986 and 1988, <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> a {{separate}} state of Gorkhaland and Kamtapur based on ethnic lines grew strong. Riots between the Gorkha National Liberation Front (GNLF) and the West Bengal government reached a stand-off after a forty-day strike. The town was virtually under siege, {{and the state}} government called in the Indian army to maintain law and order.

Since 2007, <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> {{a separate}} Gorkhaland state has been revived by the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha and its supporters in the Darjeeling hills.

5|$|Coarse or {{carpet wool}} sheep are {{those with a}} medium to long length wool of {{characteristic}} coarseness. Breeds traditionally used for carpet wool show great variability, but the chief requirement is a wool that will not break down under heavy use (as would that of the finer breeds). As <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> carpet-quality wool declines, some breeders {{of this type of}} sheep are attempting to use a few of these traditional breeds for alternative purposes.

5|$|During World War II <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> metal for the {{war effort}} {{resulted}} in many bells being melted down for scrap. As a result, those that survived are generally regarded as important historic artifacts. More than 70,000 bells (approximately 90 per cent of the bonshō then in existence) were destroyed in this way. However, rapid production of bells during the post-war period meant that by 1995 the number of temple bells in Japan had returned to pre-war levels.|$|E
5|$|Economists have {{observed}} that consumers tend to travel more when their cars are more fuel efficient, causing a 'rebound' in <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> fuel. An increase in the efficiency with which a resource (e.g. fuel) is used, causes {{a decrease in the}} cost of using that resource when measured in terms of what it can achieve (e.g. travel). Generally speaking, a decrease in the cost (or price) of a good or service will increase the quantity demanded (the law of demand). With a lower cost for travel, consumers will travel more, increasing <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> fuel. This increase in demand is known as the rebound effect, and {{it may or may not}} be large enough to offset the original drop in demand from the increased efficiency. The Jevons paradox occurs when the rebound effect is greater than 100%, exceeding the original efficiency gains.|$|E
5|$|Following the Second World War <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> {{electricity}} {{increased in}} the United Kingdom. In North East England, {{this led to the}} construction of two new power stations at Stella, along with the expansion of stations at Dunston and Billingham, to meet <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> power quickly. At Blyth, a larger and more efficient plant was planned, consisting of six 100megawatts (MW) generating units. This increased to six 120MW units, before increasing again in the final proposal for an A station consisting of four 120MW units and a B station consisting of two 275MW units and two 350MW units. This gave the A and B stations generating capacities of 480MW and 1,250MW respectively. The Blyth Power Stations were to be an experiment, using a variety of generating set sizes at a time when engineers were trying to standardise power station plant and layout. Blyth was the first in the UK to use generating sets larger than the then standard 30MW and 60MW. The station's location was chosen because of its position within the super grid, rather than to be near a load centre.|$|E
