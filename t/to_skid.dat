5|$|Slippery {{surfaces}} or bumpy surfaces. Under {{front wheel}} braking, the lower {{coefficient of friction}} may cause the front wheel <b>to</b> <b>skid</b> which often results {{in a loss of}} balance.|$|E
25|$|Diesel is less {{flammable}} than gasoline/petroleum spirit. However, {{because it}} evaporates slowly, spills on a roadway can pose slip hazard to vehicles. After the light fractions have evaporated, a greasy slick is {{left on the}} road which reduces tire grip and traction, and can cause vehicles <b>to</b> <b>skid.</b> The loss of traction {{is similar to that}} encountered on black ice, resulting in especially dangerous situations for two-wheeled vehicles, such as motorcycles and bicycles, in roundabouts.|$|E
25|$|Very loose {{surfaces}} (such as {{gravel and}} loose dirt): In some loose-surface situations, {{it may be}} beneficial to completely lock up the rear wheel in order to slow down or maintain control. On very steep slopes with loose surfaces where any braking will cause the wheel <b>to</b> <b>skid,</b> it can be better to maintain control of the bicycle by the rear-brake more than one would normally. However neither wheel should stop rotating completely, as this will result in very little control.|$|E
5000|$|Smoothness - A brake that is grabby, pulses, has chatter, or {{otherwise}} exerts varying brake force may lead <b>to</b> <b>skids.</b> For example, railroad wheels have little traction, and friction brakes without an anti-skid mechanism often lead <b>to</b> <b>skids,</b> which increases maintenance costs {{and leads to}} a [...] "thump thump" [...] feeling for riders inside.|$|R
50|$|A stiff frost, {{temperatures}} of −2 °C to −3 °C {{and a light}} mist occurred in Oxfordshire and western Northamptonshire, during the night as a cold front crossed the UK. Several cars crashed due <b>to</b> <b>skidding</b> on black ice.|$|R
50|$|Gritting {{vehicles}} are also dangerous to overtake; as grit is {{scattered across the}} entire roadway, loose pieces can damage the paintwork and windows of passing cars. Loose salt does not provide sufficient traction for motorcycles, which can lead <b>to</b> <b>skidding,</b> especially around corners.|$|R
25|$|On tilled soil a {{one-piece}} roller has {{the disadvantage}} that when turning corners the outer {{end of the}} roller has to rotate much faster than the inner end, forcing one or both ends <b>to</b> <b>skid.</b> A one-piece roller turned on soft ground will skid up a heap of soil at the outer radius, leaving heaps, which is counter-productive. Rollers are often made {{in two or three}} sections to reduce this problem, and the Cambridge roller overcomes it altogether by mounting many small segments onto one axle so that they can each rotate at local ground-speed.|$|E
25|$|The USAir plane {{touched down}} near the runway threshold. Just as the nose was being lowered, the first officer noticed SkyWest 5569 on the runway and applied maximum braking, {{but it was too}} late. The USAir plane slammed into the Metroliner, {{crushing}} it beneath its fuselage. The 737 proceeded <b>to</b> <b>skid</b> down the runway, then veered off the left side and came to rest {{on the far side of}} the taxiway against a closed fire station building where it eventually caught fire. Large debris from the Metroliner – including its tail, wings, and right engine – were found on the runway and between the runway and the abandoned fire station.|$|E
25|$|Graf {{also had}} a {{powerful}} backhand drive but {{over the course of}} her career tended to use this less frequently, opting more often for an effective backhand slice. Starting in the early 1990s, she used the slice almost exclusively in baseline rallies and mostly limited the topspin backhand to passing shots. Her accuracy with the slice, both cross-court and down the line and her ability <b>to</b> <b>skid</b> the ball and keep it low, enabled her to use it as an offensive weapon to set the ball up for her forehand put-aways. However, Graf admitted in 1995 that she would have preferred having a two-handed backhand in retrospect.|$|E
50|$|In 2005, 10.1 km were resurfaced. Construction {{work began}} at on highway 32 at the {{entrance}} to Success and continued west for 10.1 km. Wheel ruts and surface detoriation were levelled and filled and a microsurface treatment was put into place to restore resistance <b>to</b> <b>skidding.</b>|$|R
50|$|Pavement {{technology}} is still evolving, albeit in not easily noticed increments. For instance, chemical additives in the pavement mix make the pavement more weather resistant, grooving and other surface treatments improve resistance <b>to</b> <b>skidding</b> and hydroplaning, and joint seals which were once tar are now made of low maintenance neoprene.|$|R
5000|$|Drifting (motorsport): Cars {{engineered}} <b>to</b> drift (<b>skid</b> in controlled manner).|$|R
25|$|In {{slippery}} conditions some riders {{prefer to}} ride fixed {{because they believe}} the transmission provides increased feedback on back tire grip. However, {{there is also an}} increased risk of loss of control in such conditions. This is especially so when taking into account the large number of riders who ride brakeless. These riders must brake entirely through the drivetrain. Ideally this is done by resisting the forward motion of the pedals, shedding speed while the bike is still moving. Alternatively, though far less efficiently, one can brake by stopping the motion of the pedals in mid-rotation, causing the rear wheel to lock in place, allowing the bicycle <b>to</b> <b>skid</b> and slow down from kinetic friction (see below).|$|E
25|$|Oxen (singular ox) are cattle {{trained as}} draft animals. Often they are adult, {{castrated}} males of larger breeds, although females and bulls {{are also used}} in some areas. Usually, an ox is over four years old due {{to the need for}} training and to allow it to grow to full size. Oxen are used for plowing, transport, hauling cargo, grain-grinding by trampling or by powering machines, irrigation by powering pumps, and wagon drawing. Oxen were commonly used <b>to</b> <b>skid</b> logs in forests, and sometimes still are, in low-impact, select-cut logging. Oxen are most often used in teams of two, paired, for light work such as carting, with additional pairs added when more power is required, sometimes up to a total of 20 or more.|$|E
25|$|The PIT {{begins when}} the {{pursuing}} vehicle pulls alongside the fleeing vehicle {{so that the}} portion of the pursuer's vehicle forward of the front wheels is aligned with {{the portion of the}} target vehicle behind the back wheels. The pursuer gently makes contact with the target's side, then steers sharply into the target. The pursuer must also accelerate or its bumper will slide off of the target vehicle. As soon as the fleeing vehicle's rear tires lose traction and start <b>to</b> <b>skid,</b> the pursuer continues to turn in the same direction until clear of the target. This is more of a committed lane change than an actual turn. The target will turn in the opposite direction, in front of the pursuer, and will spin out. The PIT may be done from either side, but consideration must be given to where both cars will end up.|$|E

50|$|In 1963, Oxford City Police experimented using a Brantley {{helicopter}} {{with a dog}} basket attached <b>to</b> the <b>skids.</b>|$|R
25|$|The Brikken had a Farman style fixed undercarriage, {{with two}} wheels {{on each side}} on short axles {{attached}} at right angles <b>to</b> <b>skids,</b> upturned at the front. The front end of each skid was mounted on a single raked strut to the wing and the rear by a transverse V-pair with its upper ends below the aft inner and second interplane struts, further braced with wires, resulting in a wide track.|$|R
25|$|Sebastian Bach was {{introduced}} <b>to</b> <b>Skid</b> Row by Dave Feld, {{a friend of}} the band, who saw Bach singing Led Zeppelin covers at rock photographer Mark Weiss wedding. After completing the lineup, the group signed with Richie Sambora's and Bon Jovi's publishing company Underground, unknowingly giving them the lion’s share of the group’s royalties. Skid Row later restored Sambora's share of the royalties, but Bon Jovi kept his, which caused a rift between Bon Jovi and Bach. After negotiating with a number of labels such Geffen, Atlantic, and A, Skid Row settled on Atlantic in 1988. The band entered the Royal Recorders in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin with producer Michael Wagener to record its debut. The studio was in the back end of the hotel the band stayed in. Skid Row worked according to a schedule made by Wagener and stayed dry during recording. The recording went smoothly because the band had been performing the songs for a year. The label initially pressed 150,000 copies of the album and booked the band an opening slot on Bon Jovi's 1988–1989 New Jersey Syndicate Tour.|$|E
500|$|Most of the {{braking force}} of {{standard}} upright bikes {{comes from the}} front wheel. As the analysis above shows, if the brakes themselves are strong enough, the rear wheel is easy <b>to</b> <b>skid,</b> while the front wheel often can generate enough stopping force to flip the rider and bike over the front wheel. This is called a stoppie if the rear wheel is lifted but the bike does not flip, or an endo (abbreviated form of end-over-end) if the bike flips. On long or low bikes, however, such as cruiser motorcycles and recumbent bicycles, the front tire will skid instead, possibly causing a loss of balance. [...] Assuming no loss of balance, {{it is possible to}} calculate optimum braking performance depending on the bike's geometry, the location of center of gravity of bike and rider, and the maximum coefficient of friction.|$|E
500|$|Gran Trak 10 is a single-player racing {{video game}} in which the player drives a race car along a race track, shown from above. The player {{controls}} the car with a steering wheel, accelerator and brake pedals, and gear stick, as in a real car. The gear shifting requires the player to shift between reverse, first, second, and third gears as needed, but the pedals are digital controls rather than analog, so the player cannot control his speed by applying differing levels of pressure. The steering wheel turns the car only while it is being turned, rather than having a neutral [...] "straight" [...] position. Braking does not stop the car instantly and turning while braking will cause the car <b>to</b> <b>skid.</b> The course is defined on the screen by walls of white dots representing pylons, which if hit stop the car and spin it. There is only a single track layout. The track contains one black path representing an oil slick, which prevents the player's car from turning. At {{the top of the}} screen are two numbers; the number on the right is the remaining time in the game, starting at 78 and counting down by 2s, while the number on the left is the number of checkpoints the player has passed, and counts up by 2s.|$|E
50|$|Dunlop's Maxaret was {{the first}} {{anti-lock}} braking system (ABS) to be widely used. Introduced in the early 1950s, Maxaret was rapidly taken up in the aviation world, after testing found a 30% reduction in stopping distances, {{and the elimination of}} tyre bursts or flat spots due <b>to</b> <b>skids.</b> Experimental fittings on cars and motorcycles demonstrated mixed performance, and ABS systems would not appear on mainstream, non sporting cars until the 1970s when electronic controls matured.|$|R

2500|$|Bumpy surfaces: If {{the front}} wheel comes off the ground during braking, it will stop completely. [...] Landing on a stopped front wheel with the brakes still applied is likely to cause {{the front wheel}} <b>to</b> <b>skid</b> and may flip the rider over the handlebar.|$|E
2500|$|A roller brake is a modular {{cable-operated}} {{drum brake}} manufactured by Shimano {{for use on}} specially splined front and rear hubs. [...] Unlike a traditional drum brake, the Roller Brake can be easily removed from the hub. [...] Some models contain a torque-limiting device called a power modulator designed to make it difficult <b>to</b> <b>skid</b> the wheel. [...] In practice this can reduce its effectiveness on bicycles with adult-sized wheels.|$|E
2500|$|The Norcross Brothers of Worcester, Massachusetts {{built the}} monument, {{employing}} some 85 workers {{who lived on}} site, [...] "where reportedly no liquor or gambling was allowed." [...] Workers cut the stone for the pyramid from a granite outcropping common in the area. They then used oxen teams <b>to</b> <b>skid</b> the stone a half-mile to the work site. The rough-faced granite blocks used to construct the monument in many cases weigh several tons.|$|E
5000|$|... "Budget" [...] child trikes have pedals {{directly}} {{driving the}} front wheels, for better {{control of the}} bike and braking issues but better models (such as the Pashley Pickle) have chain drive to a single rear wheel. Children's rear-drive trikes lack a differential, so one rear wheel spins free. Rear-drive is preferable to front-drive {{as most of the}} rider's weight is on the rear wheels; indeed most front drive trikes are prone <b>to</b> <b>skidding</b> when force is applied to the pedals.|$|R

2500|$|It is {{possible}} to slow down or stop a fixed-gear bike in two ways. The first, most efficient, and least stressful on the rider's body is by resisting the turning cranks as they come up and around, shedding speed with each pedal rotation. The second way, less efficient but more showy, is to bump or skid the rear wheel along the pavement. Such a move is initiated by shifting the rider's weight slightly forward and pulling up on the pedals using clipless pedals or toe clips and straps. [...] The rider then stops turning the cranks, thus stopping the drivetrain and rear wheel, while applying body weight {{in opposition to the}} rotation of the cranks. This causes the rear wheel <b>to</b> <b>skid,</b> and slow the bike. The skid can be held until the bicycle stops or until the rider desires to continue pedaling again at a slower speed. The technique requires practice and is generally considered dangerous when used during cornering [...]|$|E
2500|$|Shortly before West Indies {{embarked}} {{on a tour of}} Australia in November to December 2009; senior players such as Chris Gayle and Shivnarine Chanderpaul returned to the squad, but Roach had sufficiently impressed selectors during the dispute that he retained his place. The West Indies lost the first Test in three days; Adrian Barath's century on debut and Roach's bowling performance were the main positives for the West Indies; in the opinion of former Australia captain Ian Chappell, Roach's bowling was [...] "exceptionally good" [...] but he lacked support from more senior bowlers. Although the West Indies drew the second Test, Roach (who was regularly bowling over [...] ) and Dwayne Bravo took the West Indies close to levelling the series {{on the final day of}} the match. Australia's captain, Ricky Ponting, commended Roach for his control and accuracy and said [...] "Someone who is pretty short at that pace can get the ball <b>to</b> <b>skid</b> onto you pretty quickly off the wicket with not much bounce. We've played him pretty well here [...] The ball reverse-swung for them in both innings. He's a handful, there's no doubt about that. He's someone who could play a fair bit of Test cricket for them in the future." [...] It was the opinion of Tony Cozier that in the absence of experienced fast bowlers Jerome Taylor and Fidel Edwards, Roach was the leader of the bowling attack in Australia. Roach, who was fastest of the West Indies' bowling line-up, troubled the Australian batsmen with his pace through the series, and a rivalry emerged between Roach and Ponting. In the first innings of the third and final Test, Roach struck Ponting on the elbow, who was forced to retire hurt. However, he was forced to bowl into the wind, which surprised Australian batsmen Shane Watson as it reduced Roach's pace.|$|E
2500|$|To {{perform the}} [...] "dismount to mount" [...] exchange, the first rider must exit {{the pack and}} coast for about 15 meters in order to slow down. Then the rider on the bike will soft pedal until the right foot is back and level with the left foot in the front. Once the feet are set, the rider will then forcefully pedal backwards. Because the Little 500 Bikes are coaster brakes, this action causes the bike's wheels to stop dead and forces the bike <b>to</b> <b>skid</b> along the cinder track. During this skid, the rider on the bike will take her left foot off the pedal and swing {{it over to the}} right side. Then the left foot will come behind the right and hit the ground, soon {{followed}} by the right foot. This rider will still be running once off the bike and hand it off to the next rider. This is where many riders differ. Some mount the bike by crossing their left foot over and stepping on the left petal and then swinging their right foot over the bike. But more commonly, riders will run and then literally jump onto the bike seat. Both types have their advantages. The step on style can be very slow (if performed incorrectly) and impossible to perform if the pedals are not set properly by the first rider. But it is far less painful for the rider and much more reliable. On the other hand, jumping on the bike guarantees that the rider will get on the bike, and, when performed correctly, is faster than stepping on, but it can be very painful for most riders and often the initial shock of landing causes a momentary delay before the rider starts to get up to speed. This delay can cost crucial seconds when it comes to catching the pack. Also, for men there is the possibility of permanent damage to their reproductive organs. And many women suffer from vaginal bruising. Jumping on is also more dangerous because if performed improperly, riders are likely to take very hard falls.|$|E
