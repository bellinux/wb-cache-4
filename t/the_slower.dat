40|$|We {{study the}} effect of {{resonant}} absorption of surface sausage and surface kink modes under photospheric conditions where <b>the</b> <b>slow</b> surface sausage modes undergo resonant damping in <b>the</b> <b>slow</b> continuum and <b>the</b> surface kink modes in <b>the</b> <b>slow</b> and Alfvén continua at the transitional layers. We use recently derived analytical formulas to obtain the damping rate (time). By considering linear density and linear pressure profiles for the transitional layers, we show that resonant absorption in <b>the</b> <b>slow</b> continuum could be an efficient mechanism for the wave damping of <b>the</b> <b>slow</b> surface sausage and slow surface kink modes whilst the damping rate of <b>the</b> <b>slow</b> surface kink mode in the Alfvén continuum is weak.

40|$|This work is {{concerned}} with the dynamics of a slow-fast stochastic evolutionary system quantified with a scale parameter.

By us-ing three different methods, associated with <b>the</b> <b>slow</b> manifold equations of the L-H system are obtained. Firstly, <b>the</b> <b>slow</b> manifold equation of the nonlinear chaotic dynamic system is obtained by considering that <b>the</b> <b>slow</b> manifold is locally {{defined by a}} plane orthogonal to the tangent system’s left fast eigenvector. On the condition that zTλ 1 (X) · X ̇ = 0, <b>the</b> <b>slow</b> man-ifold equation of the L-H system is built. And secondly, another method consists of defining <b>the</b> <b>slow</b> manifold as <b>the</b> surface generated by <b>the</b> two <b>slow</b> eigenvectors associated with the two eigenvalues λ 2 (X) and λ 3 (X) of J(X). Another slow manifold equation of the L-H system is obtained. Thirdly, by geometric singular perturbation theory, we give <b>the</b> new <b>slow</b> manifold equation that is concrete and terse of the L-H system. Finally, we apply our results to derive <b>the</b> <b>slow</b> manifold equations of some known classical chaotic systems, such as the chua’s system, the Lorenz system, the Chen’s system and Lü’s system, and analyze the dynamical behavior of the S-FADS...|$|R
