5|$|The Palmyrene monarchy was new; {{allegiance}} {{was based}} on loyalty to Odaenathus, making the transfer of power to a successor more difficult <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> in an established monarchy. Odaenathus tried to ensure the dynasty's future by crowning his eldest son co-king, but both were assassinated. Zenobia, left to secure the Palmyrene succession and retain the loyalty of its subjects, emphasized the continuity between her late husband and his successor (her son). Vaballathus (with Zenobia orchestrating the process) assumed his father's royal titles immediately, and his earliest known inscription records him as King of Kings.|$|E
5|$|In a {{retrospective}} interview, Rare designers Jens Restemeier and Nick Burton took interest in the-then upcoming Xbox Live Arcade {{and offered to}} develop a new game for the service after the release of Rare's Xbox 360 launch titles Perfect Dark Zero and Kameo. Rather than simply porting the original ZX Spectrum title to the Xbox 360, the development team decided to expand Jetpac and experiment with new elements. The team ensured to keep the original core mechanics of the Jetpac whilst designing new features for the game. Restemeier also stated that the development process for an Xbox Live Arcade game differed from a retail title, owing to processing power limitations that had to be constantly synced over Xbox Live. Burton asserted that one of the differences with development on the Xbox Live Service was the way optimisations shifted from graphics and game logic, stating that this was more difficult <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> for an Xbox 360 title such as Kameo.|$|E

5|$|Steiner {{differentiated}} offers, {{threats and}} throffers {{based on the}} preferability of compliance and noncompliance for the subject {{when compared to the}} normal course of events that would have come about were no intervention made. Steiner's account was criticised by philosopher Robert Stevens, who instead suggested that what was important in differentiating the kinds of intervention was whether performing or not performing the requested action was more or less preferable <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> were no intervention made. Throffers form part of the wider moral and political considerations of coercion, and form part of the question of the possibility of coercive offers. Contrary to received wisdom that only threats can be coercive, throffers lacking explicit threats have been cited as an example of coercive offers, while some writers argue that offers, threats and throffers may all be coercive if certain conditions are met. For others, by contrast, if a throffer is coercive, it is explicitly the threat aspect that makes it so, and not all throffers can be considered coercive.|$|E

25|$|In 1976, SF Line {{asked for}} tenders from various shipyards {{around the world}} for {{construction}} of a 1,700-passenger, 540-car ferry. The cheapest bid, 80 million Finnish markka (20 million United States dollar by exchange rates of the time), was made by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries of Japan who outbid the Finnish Wärtsilä shipyard by 36 million markka. On 13 September 1977, SF Line signed a contract with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries for construction of a ferry. However, the funding of the project was subject to approval by the Bank of Finland and as at the time the employment level in Finland's shipyards was low, the Bank of Finland decided not to grant its approval to the project's funding with hopes of forcing the company to order a ship from a Finnish shipyard. After prolonged negotiations between both SF Line and the Bank of Finland as well as SF Line and Wärtsilä, SF Line placed an order with Wärtsilä on 17 March 1978. In the end the cost of the ship from Wärtsilä was approximately 15% more expensive <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> if built by Mitsubishi, despite a subvention of 17 million markka from the Bank of Finland.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, the Institute for Energy Research {{commissioned}} the Danish think-tank CEPOS (Centre for Political Studies) {{to report on}} electricity exports from Denmark and {{the economic impact of}} the Danish wind industry. This heavily criticized report states that Danes pay the highest residential electricity rates in the European Union (mostly for government revenue, but partly to subsidize wind power), and that the cost of saving a ton of carbon dioxide between 2001 and 2008 has averaged 647 DKK (€87, US$124). It also estimated that 90% of wind industry jobs were transferred from other technology industries, and states that as a result Danish GDP is 1.8billion DKK (US$270million) lower <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> without wind industry subsidies of 1.7-2.6 billion DKK (roughly $320M - $480M) yearly in 2001-2005. The report was later heavily criticised. Firstly Danish engineering magazine Ingeniøren claimed that the report was ordered and paid for by the American oil and coal lobby through IER. Later, several Danish researchers and professors from all technical universities in Denmark, wrote a joint response to the report, refuting it. The report from CEPOS was even brought to Government level, where minister of Climate and Energy Lykke Friis discredited the work done by CEPOS and the report. The World Nuclear Association estimates that the report was IER's response to US president Obama's 2009 Earth Day speech in Newton, Iowa claiming that USA could generate 20% of its electricity from wind by 2030, as Denmark already was.|$|E
500|$|The {{murder of}} Leigh's {{character}} in the shower is the film's pivotal scene {{and one of the}} best-known in all of cinema. As such, it spawned numerous myths and legends. It was shot from December 17–23, 1959, with 77 different camera angles. The finished scene runs three minutes and includes 50 cuts. Most of the shots are extreme close-ups, except for medium shots in the shower directly before and directly after the murder. The combination of the close shots with their short duration makes the sequence feel more subjective <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> if the images were presented alone or in a wider angle, an example of the technique Hitchcock described as [...] "transferring the menace from the screen into the mind of the audience".|$|E

500|$|To {{prepare to}} write the script, Walker watched various movies {{featuring}} gangsters.

Walker watched movies created and set in the 1930s, including {{but not limited to}} The Public Enemy, [...] Little Caesar, Once Upon a Time in America, [...] Miller's Crossing and various movies starring James Cagney, because he believed they would give him a truer feel on how people of the era sounded and talked.

500|$|Because {{their energy}} is {{strongly}} focused, the gamma rays emitted by most bursts {{are expected to}} miss the Earth and never be detected. When a gamma-ray burst is pointed towards Earth, the focusing of its energy along a relatively narrow beam causes the burst to appear much brighter <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> were its energy emitted spherically. When this effect is taken into account, typical gamma-ray bursts are observed to have a true energy release of about 1044J, or about 1/2000 of a Solar mass (...) energy equivalent—which is still many times the mass-energy equivalent of the Earth (about 5.5×1041J). This {{is comparable to the}} energy released in a bright type Ib/c supernova and within the range of theoretical models. Very bright supernovae have been observed to accompany several of the nearest GRBs. Additional support for focusing of the output of GRBs has come from observations of strong asymmetries in the spectra of nearby type Ic supernova and from radio observations taken long after bursts when their jets are no longer relativistic.|$|E

500|$|To Playford's {{advantage}} {{there was}} usually {{a disproportionate number}} of South Australians in federal cabinets, both Liberal and Labor. This clout, combined with his own intensive and unconventional negotiating tactics, made sure that South Australia regularly received more federal funds <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> allocated otherwise. This was to Robert Menzies' chagrin, who said: [...] "Tom [...] wouldn't know intellectual honesty if he met it {{on the end of a}} pitch fork but he does it all for South Australia, not for himself, so I forgive him." [...] By the time of his departure from power, Playford gained the reputation of being [...] "a good South Australian but a very bad Australian", and for using [...] "threats to bully recalcitrant Prime Ministers". For his part, Playford remained unrepentant, claiming that federal authorities had infringed the constitution of Australia and had consistent exercised powers over the states that were not rightfully theirs. Playford accused the High Court of Australia of helping the federal parliament under Curtin to legislate to give itself a monopoly on the acquisition of income tax, which he claimed was contrary to the intention of the constitution to prevent excessive centralisation of power in the federal government. In 1958, he threatened to take the federal government to the High Court, which led to South Australia being given more compensation under the River Murray Waters Agreement for the loss of water from the Snowy River. Three years later he went to the High Court in an attempt to have Canberra pay for the standardisation of the gauge on the Broken Hill-Port Pirie railway.|$|E
2500|$|Since its inception, {{the impact}} of the {{stimulus}} has been a subject of disagreement. Studies on its effects have produced a range of conclusions, from strongly positive to strongly negative and all reactions in between.
