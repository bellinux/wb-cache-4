The Search part aims at returning a ranked list of video segments {{that are relevant to}} a textual user query. <b>The</b> <b>Anchoring</b> <b>part</b> focuses on identifying video segments that would encourage further exploration within the archive. A two step approach is implemented for both sub-tasks. The first step is common to both. This step consists in generating a list of potential anchor segments and response-query segments relying on a hierarchical topical structuring technique; In the second step, for each query, the best 20 segments are selected according to content based comparisons, while for the anchor detection sub-task, the segments are ranked based on a cohesion measure. The use of the hierarchical topical structure helps to propose segments of variable length at different levels of details with precise jump-in points for them. More, the algorithm deriving the structure relies on the burstiness phenomenon in word occurrences which gives an advantage over the classical bag-of-words model...|$|E
30|$|Most of the sensitizers in DSSCs have {{carboxylic}} acid groups as an anchor {{on the surface}} of TiO 2. But, the dye molecules get desorbed at the semiconductor surface at a pH >[*] 9, due to the shifting of the equilibrium towards the reactant side. Thus, dyes with different anchoring groups are much needed. Again, most of the research focuses on phosphonic acid and the credit goes to its binding strength to a metal oxide surface, as the binding strength to a metal oxide surface decreases in the order, phosphonic acid > {{carboxylic acid}} > ester > acid chloride > carboxylate salts > amides [174]. Z 955 is a Ru-complex containing phosphonic acid as an anchoring group and demonstrated a η[*]=[*] 8 % accompanied by good stability under prolonged light soaking for about 1000  h at AM 1.5 and 55  °C [175]. Triethoxysilane [176] and boronic acid are some other anchoring groups. π-Extended ferrocene with varied anchoring groups (–COOH, –OH, and –CHO) has been applied as photosensitizers in DSSCs [177]. Chauhan and co-workers has synthesized and characterized two new compounds as FcCH=NC 6 H 4 COOH (1) and FcCH=NCH 2 CH 2 OH (2), where Fc[*]=[*]C 5 H 4 FeC 5 H 5 and FcCHO are used as the starting material [177]. By cyclic voltammetry (CV) in dichloromethane solution and using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, they have explained the quasi-reversible redox behavior of the dyes. The redox-active ferrocenyl group exhibited a single quasi-reversible oxidation wave with E′[*]=[*] 0.34, 0.44, and 0.44  V for 1, 2, and 3, respectively. In 2017, a study was carried out to inspect the influence of a cyano group in <b>the</b> <b>anchoring</b> <b>part</b> of the dye on its adsorption stability and the overall PV properties like electron injection ability to the surface and VOC [178]. The results indicated that the addition of the cyano group increased the stability of adsorption only when it adsorbs via CN with the surface and it decreased the photovoltaic properties when it was not involved in binding.|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} thesis, {{entitled}} “Strategies for the modulation of catalytic activity of Zn(II) -based of artificial nucleases”, {{the results obtained}} in an extensive investigation on the reactivity of different catalytic systems for hydrolytic cleavage of phosphate diesters are reported. Phosphate diesters have a remarkable importance since they constituted the backbone of essential biomolecules as DNA and RNA. Indeed, the high stability of those polianions towards the hydrolytic attack {{is due to the}} presence of the phosphodiester group. On the other hand, the hydrolytic cleavage of nucleic acids occurs in living organism is few milliseconds, thanks to nucleases which are the enzyme devoted to this task. In the attempt to reproduce the activity of such enzymes, which are among the most efficient present in nature, I focused my attention on the design and synthesis of catalytic agents based on metal ions, namely Zn(II) ions, and studying their reactivity towards a RNA model, the 2 -hydroxypropyl-para-nitrophenyl phosphate (HPNP). In {{the first part of the}} thesis, the interesting results I obtained in the study of the reactivity of monometallic Zn(II) -based complexes towards HPNP are reported. The Zn(II) complexes used in this studied were 1 (mononuclear complex of 1, 4, 7 -triazacyclononane, TACN) and 2, (mononuclear complex of 1, 4, 7 -trimethyl- 1, 4, 7 -triazacyclononane, TMTACN) which is the corresponding permethylated derivative. I will show how the small differences in the structure of the two ligands affect the HPNP cleavage reaction with effects never reported before. The hypothesis that such differences may arise from different coordination geometries of the metal will be discussed. The second part of the thesis is focused on the investigation of the effects that the local environment surrounding the metal complexes produces on their reactivity towards phosphodiester cleavage. In this view, I designed supramolecular systems based on functionalized gold nanoparticles. Such catalytic gold nanoparticles, known as nanozymes, were obtained by coating them with thiols bearing the a catalytic unit, namely the Zn(II) complex of the ligand TACN. Microenvironment modulation was obtained by changing the spacer between the catalytic unit and <b>the</b> <b>anchoring</b> <b>part</b> (thiol moiety). I will show that the increase the length of the alky spacer from four carbon atoms (thiol 1) to twelve atoms (thiol 4) strongly increases the nanozyme reactivity towards the hydrolytic cleavage of HPNP. On the other hand, longer but more polar oligo(ethyleneoxide) spacer in 3 does not have any effect on the nanozyme reactivity. The experiments reported will demonstrate that such a reactivity modulation depends on an enthalpy-driven stabilization of the transition state of the reaction and is strongly correlated to the polarity of the microenvironment, presumably the interface between the particle coating monolayer and the bulk water solution, where the reaction occurs. Finally, in the last part of the present thesis, I shall report the results obtained by studying how the morphology of the gold nanoparticles-coating monolayer affects the reactivity of the nanozymes. Therefore, I prepared mixed-monolayer nanoparticles where the coating contains simultaneously thiol 1 and the zwitterionic thiol (ZW), which bears a phosphorylcholine moiety, or the triethilenglycol-thiol (TEG, in different ratios). The main function of the latter is to improve water solubility to the nanozymes, but I reasoned that they could have an effect on the reciprocal organization and sorting of the molecules in the monolayer. Indeed, preliminary experiments performed demonstrated that different distributions of the catalytic units in the nanoparticles surface, either in patches or random, were obtained when the two different inert thiols were used. Interestingly, such different distributions affect the substrate affinity of the catalytic system but not its activity. In conclusion, we have performed a systematic approach to study of how the reactivity of Zn(II) ions in hydrolytic phosphate-cleaving catalysts can be modulated using different strategies, ranging to the modification of the ligand structure to the control of the local microenvironment or of the catalyst reciprocal proximity using monolayer protected nanoparticles...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{investigates the}} {{effectiveness}} of carbon fiber spike anchors {{as a means of}} anchoring externally bonded (EB) fiber-reinforced polymers (FRP) and textile reinforced mortar (TRM) sheets into concrete. The investigation employs experimental work, which includes reinforced concrete (RC) columns strengthened with various configurations of EB FRP and TRM sheets connected to RC footings via carbon fiber spike <b>anchors.</b> <b>The</b> fiber spikes have two parts: <b>the</b> <b>anchor</b> <b>part</b> and <b>the</b> fan <b>part.</b> <b>The</b> <b>anchor</b> <b>part</b> is a bar-type dowel component that is epoxy pre-impregnated and inserted into epoxy filled holes within the footing. The fan part was impregnated in-situ and fanned out over and bonded to the EB reinforcement of the column. The connections were tested by pulling the columns upwards, thus applying tensile forces to the connection system. The direct tensile capacity of <b>the</b> <b>anchors</b> was determined for a number of variables including the size and number of <b>anchors,</b> <b>the</b> bonding agent and the type and amount of EB reinforcement. It is concluded that, with appropriate anchorage into concrete, the carbon fiber spike anchor is an effective anchorage system, and therefore, could be used in a range of strengthening applications to prevent premature delamination of FRP and TRM sheets from concrete surfaces...|$|R

30|$|The {{bactericidal}} {{effect of}} metal ions, especially copper and silver ions, {{is a well}} known phenomenon which has been recognized for centuries (Dollwet and Sorenson 1985). Pure copper and silver films have to be discussed critically in orthopedic and trauma surgery where tissue integration is essential for permanent implants, because the permanent long-term release of ions may result in reduced tissue integration of the implant and a pronounced “immuno-incompetent fibro-inflammatory zone” (Gristina 1994). Modification of the biocompatible TiO 2 -coating by copper incorporation is hence only one possibility to create antibacterial properties. In this respect, amongst others silver-coated orthopaedic implants have been studied. In animal experiments {{as well as in}} a prospective clinical trial a reduced infection rate was thereby observed (Hardes et al. 2010; Gosheger et al. 2004). However, this very silver coating may not be applied to the prosthetic stem, i.e. <b>the</b> <b>anchoring</b> <b>parts</b> of <b>the</b> prosthesis (Hardes et al. 2010). On the other hand, with the presented copper-loaded TiO 2 surface coating, infection prevention could be achieved in the perioperative period, combined with excellent biocompatibility that allows coating of implant parts made for implant fixation in bone and other tissues. Furthermore, the remaining biocompatible surface coating could improve immuno-competence at the interface between implant and host tissue reducing both the risk for infection and aseptic loosening (Gristina 1994).|$|R

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{explore the}} {{significance}} and potential influencing factors for the clock drawing test (CDT) in cognitive assessment {{for patients with}} hepatitis B cirrhosis. MethodsNinety-five Child-Turcotte-Pugh class A patients with hepatitis B cirrhosis, who were admitted to our hospital from June to December, 2012, were enrolled as subjects. Ninety-five healthy volunteers were used as controls. CDT was conducted {{in the two groups}} to measure cognitive functions and investigate potential influencing factors. ResultsThe medians of total scores of CDT 1 and CDT 2 were 17 and 26, respectively, in patients with hepatitis B cirrhosis, and 20 and 27, respectively, in the control group. The rank-sum test showed that the total score of CDT 1 and the scores of the digital and pointer parts in CDT 1 and CDT 2 were all significantly lower in the cirrhosis group than in the control group (P＜ 0. 05). There {{were no significant differences in}} the total score of CDT 2 and the scores of <b>the</b> <b>anchor</b> <b>parts</b> in CDT 1 and CDT 2 between the two groups. The Spearman correlation analysis indicated that the total score of CDT 2 was negatively correlated with age (r=- 0. 262, P＜ 0. 05) and positively correlated with driving history (r= 0. 238, P＜ 0. 05) in the control group; in the cirrhosis group, the total score of CDT 1 was negatively correlated with abnormal direct bilirubin level (r=- 0. 203, P＜ 0. 05), and the total score of CDT 2 was positively correlated with education, driving history, and antiviral therapy (r= 0  291, P＜ 0. 05; r= 0. 222, P＜ 0. 05; r= 0. 223, P＜ 0. 05).

The systematic incorporation of a cyano group on <b>the</b> benzoic acid <b>anchoring</b> <b>part</b> and an additional acetylene bond at the para-position to −COOH lead to {{a variation of the}} photoelectrochemical properties, electronic transitions, and device performances. Characterization of the molecular structure, the electronic/optical properties of the dyes, as well as their photovoltaic performance in DSCs was accomplished by means of electrochemistry, quantum chemical methods, and various spectroscopic techniques such as photoinduced absorption, steady-state spectroscopy, and time-resolved transient absorption studies on femto- and nanosecond time scales. Thereby, significant dependence of DSCs performances on <b>the</b> substituents and <b>anchoring</b> groups was observed. In general, cyano substituents lead to improved DSCs performances.

40|$|Loops are {{irregular}} structures which connect two {{secondary structure}} elements in proteins. They often play {{important roles in}} function, including enzyme reactions and ligand binding. Despite their importance, their structure remains difficult to predict. Most protein loop structure prediction methods sample local loop segments and score them. In particular protein loop classifications and database search methods depend heavily on local properties of loops. Here we examine the distance between a loop’s end points (span). We find that the distribution of loop span appears to be independent {{of the number of}} residues in the loop, in other words the separation between <b>the</b> <b>anchors</b> of a loop does not increase with {{an increase in the number}} of loop residues. Loop span is also unaffected by the secondary structures at the end points, unless <b>the</b> two <b>anchors</b> are <b>part</b> of an anti-parallel beta sheet. As loop span appears to be independent of global properties of the protein we suggest that its distribution can be described by a random fluctuation model based on the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution. It is believed that the primary difficulty in protein loop structure prediction comes from the number of residues in the loop. Following the idea that loop span is an independent local property, we investigate its effect on protein loop structure prediction and show how normalised span (loop stretch) is related to the structural complexity of loops. Highly contracted loops are more difficult to predict than stretched loops...|$|R

After two nights the bell was big enough for the spider to rest in (Figure  1 B). Further spinning activities at its inner side reinforced <b>the</b> wall. <b>Anchor</b> threads and <b>part</b> of the remaining sheet-web (see Figure  1 B) stabilized the growing bell.|$|R
