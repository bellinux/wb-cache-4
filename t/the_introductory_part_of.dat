He praised the way Knowles [...] " [...] her pelvis in ways never imagined", and the {{wardrobe}} changes in the clip, before concluding: [...] "She expands on her burgeoning robot fetish, flashes the crazy eyes and contorts her body in downright unsettling ways. All {{of which is to}} say that 'Sweet Dreams' is just like every amazingly crazy Beyoncé video from the past three years, which — to extend the point — also means that it's pretty great." [...] Olivia Smith of Daily News noted that in the video, Knowles references Jane Fonda in the movie Barbarella (1968), Tin Woodman and Pamela Anderson through the different costumes she wears. Smith further compared the video with the one for [...] "Single Ladies", writing that Knowles reprises some of the moves as she [...] "can only swivel those hips in so many ways". Brandon Soderberg of Slant Magazine described <b>the</b> <b>introductory</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the video as a David Lynch-like mixture of eroticism and symbolism. He {{wrote that the}} video was [...] "one part Victoria's Secret commercial, another part dream logic anti-narrative, and a CGI-assisted freakout all around". Soderberg commended the video for being [...] "an excess of body and action, not filmic techniques", adding that the dancing in the video [...] "blow our minds anew".|$|E
