She was last seen by her classmates outside of Carlos'n Charlie's, a restaurant and nightclub in Oranjestad. She {{was in a car}} with local residents Joran van der Sloot and the Kalpoe brothers, Deepak and Satish.

Upon further investigation by authorities, Van der Sloot was arrested twice on suspicion of involvement in her disappearance and the Kalpoes were each arrested three times.

5|$|The few {{men who had}} {{not been}} wounded because they were manning the ships during the battle were {{reinforced}} with <b>three</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> had suffered relatively minor wounds; they put ashore at a remote beach to dig for water.

The two ships sailed through a storm for two days and nights; Alaminos, the pilot, then steered a course for Florida, where they found good drinking water, although they lost one man to the local Indians and another drank so much water that he died. The ships finally made port in Cuba, where Hernández de Cordóba wrote a report to Governor Velázquez describing the voyage, the cities, the plantations, and, most importantly, the discovery of gold. Hernández died soon after from his wounds. The two captured Maya survived the voyage to Cuba and were interrogated; they swore that there was abundant gold in Yucatán.|$|E
