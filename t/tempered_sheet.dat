5000|$|The hogscraper {{candlestick}} is {{an early}} (circa 1780 - 1860) form of lighting device commonly used in 19th-century North America and Britain, and mainly manufactured in England. The device is manufactured of <b>tempered</b> <b>sheet</b> iron, wrought in several pieces and joined together by metal joinery and silver soldering. The name {{is derived from the}} candlestick's resemblance to an antique device used to scrape bristles from hog hide after slaughter. The antique lighting device commonly consists of a shaft, attached to a round base with a thumb tab ejector mechanism to remove the residual candle stub, and a round lip or [...] "bobeche" [...] to collect candle drippings. The [...] "bobeche" [...] often has a hook extension used for hanging the device. Some hogscraper candlesticks were manufactured with decorative brass or iron bands at the midsection of the shaft and are commonly referred to as [...] "wedding band" [...] hogscrapers. Often the devices are [...] "signed" [...] on the thumb ejector tab by the manufacturer. Historical trade directories have identified most of these manufacturers and the dates of their business existence. While most manufacturers have been identified to Birmingham there is evidence of manufacturing in Sheffield, England. There is no substantive evidence of American manufacturers before 1850.|$|E
5000|$|After {{finishing}} {{a series of}} concerts of New York State colleges sponsored by ESP, Sun Ra decided to assemble a number of stringed instruments bought from curio shops and music stores.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{process to}} improve {{formability}} and spring-back {{was developed for}} AA 5 xxx-H <b>temper</b> <b>sheets</b> based on the surface friction stir (SFS) method. When the sheet surface is stirred by the rotating probe which advances on the surface, plastic deformation and heat resulted by friction and deformation incur changes in the microstructure and macroscopic mechanical properties of the stirred zone and, therefore, ultimately the formability and spring-back performance of the overall sheet. When applied to AA 5052 -H 32 automotive sheets, the process improved formability and spring-back, as experimentally and numerically confirmed in uni-axial tensile, limit dome height (LDH) and unconstrained bending tests. For numerical simulations, the non-quadratic anisotropic yield function, Yld 2000 - 2 d, was employed along with isotropic hardening, while formability was evaluated using theoretical forming limit diagram (FLD) based on Hill’s bifurcation and M-K theories.

40|$|This thesis {{performed}} on master level covers an assignment {{given by the}} cab division at Volvo Construction Equipment (Eskilstuna, Sweden). The thesis {{has been carried out}} by Josefin Hult during the period 2014 - 01 - 23 to 2014 - 05 - 30 at Mälardalen University. Volvo Construction Equipment manufactures products including wheel loaders, backhoe loaders and articulated haulers. The assignment involves developing the standard door for larger wheel loaders. The current door has a welded frame surrounding the glass that is considered outdated and not cost effective. Volvo Construction Equipment wishes that the door was made in glass in a greater extent. The aim of the assignment has been to generate concepts regarding a glass door that fulfills given requirements. Three research questions have been stated and answered during the process. The product development process has consisted of three phases: information gathering, concept development process and development of detailed concept. For example, field studies and benchmarking have been performed to gather information about competitors’ products and the manufacturing and assembling of the current door. Concepts for handrails, sealant and overall door design have been generated in an iterative process. All components of the door have been developed into a detailed concept during the last phase of the process. The process has resulted in a frameless glass door. The concept suggestion consists of; a <b>tempered</b> <b>sheet</b> of glass, a clip list (sealant) that covers the edges of the glass, two different handrails, inner and outer handles, a gas spring, components to attach handrails against the glass, a cover and a lock mechanism. The major conclusion that is drawn is that it is fully possible to develop a door made in glass in a greater extent than the current door. Many competitors have machines where the door is made in glass in a large extent. This makes it believable that the glass door also will be perceived as timely and more modern and clear. Recommendations have been developed if there is interest in further development. The recommendations include, among others, development of handrail and test of prototype to ensure that all requirements are fulfilled.

40|$|Laminated <b>tempered</b> glass <b>sheets</b> {{were tested}} under impact loading to {{simulate}} conditions in ice hockey arenas, where pucks hit the glass shields at high velocities. Thirty-six tests {{have been conducted}} on 1220 x 460 mm sheets of glass, 9. 5, 12. 7 and 15. 9 mm thick, using falling weights attached to an actual puck. Twenty-four of the specimens were laminated on one side using 0. 36 mm thick polyester transparent laminates. The weights and drop heights were increased gradually until failure occurred. The kinetic energy, equivalent puck field velocities, equivalent static failure loads and stresses have been estimated. The estimated field velocities of the pucks at failure were all higher than the maximum recorded in the game. The study showed that lamination has significantly changed failure mode of glass from a catastrophic failure, where fragments shatter, potentially causing serious injuries, to one which is still brittle yet substantially safer as fractured glass remains fully intact. No rupture or delamination of the laminates was observed...|$|R

40|$|The present work {{investigates the}} effect of forming {{temperature}} and forming speed on the formability of AA 3003 aluminum alloy brazing <b>sheet</b> in three <b>temper</b> conditions (O, H 22 and H 24) and two different thicknesses (0. 2 and 0. 5 mm). Limiting Dome Height (LDH) experiments were conducted from which Forming Limit Curves (FLCs) were developed using the “linear best fit time-dependent method” (due to Volk and Hora, 2010) at room temperature (RT), 150 °C, 200 °C and 250 °C and forming speeds of 0. 4 and 1. 6 mm/s. Limiting dome height (LDH) experiments performed on 0. 5 mm O temper AA 3003 brazing sheet showed {{an increase in the}} biaxial dome height (from 29. 3 mm to 38 mm) for an increase in temperature from RT to 250 °C, a 28 % increase. For the thinner 0. 2 mm material, the corresponding improvement in LDH for the same temperature increase was 30 %, 29 % and 26 % for the O, H 22 and H 24 tempers, respectively. The measured FLCs were found to decrease with a decrease in sheet thickness and with increases in the initial hardness (temper). The plane strain limit strain (FLC- 0 strain) of the O temper materials decreased by 24 % at RT and 35 % at 250 °C, when the thickness is reduced from 0. 5 mm to 0. 2 mm. For the 0. 2 mm H 22 and H 24 materials, the RT FLC- 0 strains are observed to be 31 % and 39 % lower than that of 0. 2 mm O <b>temper</b> <b>sheet.</b> At 250 °C the respective drop in FLC- 0 for the two tempers are 39 % and 48 %, respectively. The increase in forming speed from 0. 4 mm/s to 1. 6 mm/s had very little effect on forming limits at RT, but resulted in a 6 - 9 % drop in the FLCs at 250 °C. M-K analyses were used to predict the FLCs. It was found that the M-K model is able to capture the temperature dependent formability behavior for the considered brazing sheets when the forming temperature increased from RT to 250 °C. However, {{the effect of}} punch speed is not captured as well and this is thought to be a function of the adopted Voce-based material model...|$|R
40|$|The rapid {{solidification}} {{of aluminum}} alloys as powder {{and the subsequent}} fabrication processes {{can be used to}} develop and tailor alloys to satisfy specific aerospace design requirements, including high strength and toughness. Laboratory procedures to produce aluminum powder-metallurgy (PM) materials are efficient but require evidence that the laboratory methods used can produce a product with superior properties. This paper describes laboratory equipment and procedures which can be used to produce tough aluminum PM sheet. The processing of a 2124 + 0. 9 percent Zr aluminum alloy powder is used as an example. The fully hardened sheet product is evaluated in terms of properties and microstructure. The key features of the vacuum hot press pressing operation used to consolidate the powder are described. The 2124 + 0. 9 percent Zr - T 8 <b>temper</b> aluminum <b>sheet</b> produced was both strong (460 - 490 MPa yield strength) and tough (Kahn Tear unit-propagation- energy values over three times those typical for ingot metallurgy 2024 -T 81).

Fine dispersoids of Al 3 Zr in the precipitate free regions adjacent to boundaries are believed to contribute to the improved toughness...|$|R
40|$|The current {{research}} addresses the formability of two magnesium sheet alloys, a conventional AZ 31 B and a rare earth alloyed ZEK 100. Both alloys had a nominal thickness of 1. 6 mm. Both Limiting Dome Height (LDH) and Cylindrical Cup Draw experiments were performed between room temperature and 350 °C. To examine {{the effect of}} sheet directionality and anisotropy, LDH experiments were performed in both the sheet rolling and transverse directions. In addition, strain measurements were performed along both sheet orientations of the cylindrical cup and LDH specimens for which the geometry is symmetric. The LDH tests were used to study the formability of ZEK 100 and AZ 31 B (O and H 24 <b>tempers)</b> magnesium alloy <b>sheet</b> between room temperature and 350 °C. At room temperature, AZ 31 B-O and AZ 31 B-H 24 exhibit limited formability, with dome heights of only 11 - 12 mm prior to the onset of necking. In contrast, the dome heights of ZEK 100 at room temperature reached 29 mm (a 140 % improvement over AZ 31 B). Increasing the temperature above 200 °C did not affect the relative ranking of the three sheet samples, however it did reduce the magnitude of the difference in dome heights. The rare earth alloyed ZEK 100 had pronounced benefits at intermediate temperatures, achieving an LDH of 37 mm at 150 °C; this dome height was only reached by AZ 31 B at a much higher temperature of 250 °C. To further characterize the formability of ZEK 100, forming limit curves (FLCs) were developed from the LDH tests in both the rolling and transverse directions. Comparisons to AZ 31 B were made at selected temperatures. Surface strain data was collected with an in situ digital image correlation (DIC) system incorporating two cameras for stereo observation. Results from these experiments further highlighted the enhanced formability relative to AZ 31 B over the entire temperature range between room temperature and 350 °C, with the most dramatic improvements between room temperature and 150 °C. The plane strain forming limit (FLC 0) for ZEK 100 at 150 °C was 0. 4 which equals that of AZ 31 B at 250 °C. At higher temperatures (300 °C), the two alloys exhibited similar performance with both achieving similar dome heights at necking of 37 mm (AZ 31 B) and 41 mm (ZEK 100). To round out the investigation of ZEK 100 for industrial applications, cylindrical cup deep drawing experiments were performed on ZEK 100 sheet between 25 °C and 250 °C under isothermal and non-isothermal conditions. Draw ratios of 1. 75, 2. 00 and 2. 25 were considered {{to examine the effects of}} draw ratio on draw depth. The effect of sheet anisotropy during deep drawing was investigated by measuring the earring profiles, sheet thickness and strain distribution along both the rolling and transverse directions. Isothermal test results showed enhanced warm temperature drawing performance of ZEK 100 over AZ 31 B sheet; for example, a full draw of 203. 2 mm (8 ”) blanks of ZEK 100 was achieved with a tool temperature of 150 °C, whereas a tool temperature of 225 °C was needed to fully draw AZ 31 B-O blanks of this diameter. Non-isothermal deep draw experiments showed further improvement in drawability with significantly lower tooling temperatures required for a full cup draw using ZEK 100. ZEK 100 achieved a full draw of 228. 6 mm (9 ") blanks with a die and blank holder temperature of 150 °C and a cooled punch (25 °C) while the same size blank of AZ 31 B required a die and blank holder temperature 225 °C and a cooled punch (150 °C). Temperature process windows were developed from the isothermal and non-isothermal results to show a direct comparison of drawing behaviour between ZEK 100 and AZ 31 B. Overall, ZEK 100 offers significantly improved forming performance compared to AZ 31 B, particularly at temperatures below 200 °C. This lower temperature enhanced formability is attractive since it is less demanding in terms of lubricant requirements and reduces the need for higher temperature tooling...|$|R
