5|$|Means (Kristen Cloke) is a {{forensic}} psychologist and {{a candidate to}} join the Millennium Group.

Means gives Catherine Black her vaccine dose, which she uses to inoculate her daughter Jordan.|$|E
5|$|The Act {{succeeded in}} its initial aim of {{establishing}} a mental health care system for Alaska, funded by income from lands allocated <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> health trust. However, during the 1970s and early 1980s, Alaskan politicians systematically stripped the trust of its lands, transferring the most valuable land to private individuals and state agencies. The asset stripping was eventually ruled to be illegal following several years of litigation, and a reconstituted mental health trust {{was established in the}} mid-1980s.|$|E

5|$|At Arsenal, Fàbregas {{also often}} assumed {{responsibility}} for set pieces, taking corners, free kicks and penalties. By his own admission, scoring was a weaker {{part of his}} game in his first few seasons at Arsenal; wasteful finishing also being symptomatic of the larger problem surrounding Arsenal in the 2005–06 and 2006–07 seasons. This changed initially in the 2007–08 season when he scored 11 goals in his first 16 games, and Arsenal manager Wenger claimed that the Spaniard's previous inability to score was down <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> state, and even compared the Spaniard to Michel Platini, a French midfielder renowned for scoring. There were also concerns raised over {{the large number of}} games Fàbregas was playing for club and country at such a young age, but while he initially avoided long spells on the sidelines, he played significantly fewer games due to injury in his last three seasons with Arsenal.|$|E
5|$|Chaplin's {{childhood}} in London {{was one of}} poverty and hardship. As his father was absent and his mother struggled financially, {{he was sent to}} a workhouse twice before the age of nine. When he was 14, his mother was committed <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> asylum. Chaplin began performing at an early age, touring music halls and later working as a stage actor and comedian. At 19, he was signed to the prestigious Fred Karno company, which took him to America. Chaplin was scouted for the film industry and began appearing in 1914 for Keystone Studios. He soon developed the Tramp persona and formed a large fan base. Chaplin directed his own films from an early stage and continued to hone his craft as he moved to the Essanay, Mutual, and First National corporations. By 1918, {{he was one of the}} best-known figures in the world.|$|E
5|$|Hayes {{had begun}} his law {{practice}} dealing primarily with commercial issues but won greater prominence in Cincinnati {{as a criminal}} defense attorney, defending several people accused of murder. In one case, he used a form of the insanity defense that saved the accused from the gallows; the woman was instead confined <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> institution. Hayes also defended slaves who had escaped and were accused under the recently enacted Fugitive Slave Act of 1850. As Cincinnati was just across the Ohio River from Kentucky, a slave state, it was a destination for escaping slaves and many such cases were tried in its courts. A staunch abolitionist, Hayes found his {{work on behalf of}} fugitive slaves personally gratifying as well as politically useful, as it raised his profile in the newly formed Republican Party.|$|E

After being admitted <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> hospital, it is revealed that Helen actually sexually abused {{him when he was}} young, and his love for her (and empathy for her troubled youth) caused him to repress his traumatic memories. This psychological damage explains his flashbacks and derealization phases throughout the book. In two months Charlie is released, and Sam and Patrick visit him. In the epilogue, Sam, Patrick and Charlie go through the tunnel again and Charlie stands up and exclaims that he felt infinite.|$|E
5|$|On 13 September 1944, Göth was {{relieved}} {{of his position}} and charged by the SS with theft of Jewish property (which belonged to the state, according to Nazi legislation), failure to provide adequate food to the prisoners under his charge, violation of concentration camp regulations regarding the treatment and punishment of prisoners, and allowing unauthorised access to camp personnel records by prisoners and non-commissioned officers. Administration of the camp at Płaszów {{was turned over to}} SS-Obersturmführer Arnold Büscher. Göth was scheduled for an appearance before SS judge Georg Konrad Morgen, but due to the progress of World War II and Germany's looming defeat, the charges against him were dropped in early 1945. SS doctors diagnosed Göth as suffering from mental illness, and he was committed <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> institution in Bad Tölz, where he was arrested by the United States military in May 1945.|$|E

5|$|Visits to Spandau of {{half an hour}} {{per month}} were allowed, but Hess forbade his family to visit until December 1969, {{when he was a}} patient at the British Military Hospital in West Berlin for a {{perforated}} ulcer. By this time Wolf Rüdiger Hess was 32 years old and Ilse 69; they had not seen Hess since his departure from Germany in 1941. After this illness, he allowed his family to visit regularly. His daughter-in-law Andrea, who often brought photos and films of his grandchildren, became a particularly welcome visitor. Hess's health problems, both mental and physical, were ongoing during his captivity. He cried out in the night, claiming he had stomach pains. He continued to suspect that his food was being poisoned and complained of amnesia. A psychiatrist who examined him in 1957 deemed he was not ill enough to be transferred <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> hospital. Another unsuccessful suicide attempt took place in 1977.|$|E
5|$|From early 1929 Anderson {{lived with}} Annie Burr Jennings, a wealthy Park Avenue {{spinster}} happy to host someone {{she supposed to}} be a daughter of the Tsar. For eighteen months, Anderson was the toast of New York City society. Then a pattern of self-destructive behavior began that culminated in her throwing tantrums, killing her pet parakeet, and on one occasion running around naked on the roof. On 24 July 1930, Judge Peter Schmuck of the New York Supreme Court signed an order committing her <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> hospital. Before she could be taken away, Anderson locked herself in her room, and the door was broken in with an axe. She was forcibly taken to the Four Winds Sanatorium in Westchester County, New York, where she remained for slightly over a year. In August 1932, Anderson returned to Germany accompanied by a private nurse in a locked cabin on the liner Deutschland. Jennings paid for the voyage, the stay at the Westchester sanatorium, and an additional six months' care in the psychiatric wing of a nursing home at Ilten near Hanover. On arrival at Ilten, Anderson was assessed as sane, but as the room was prepaid, and she had nowhere else to go, she stayed on in a suite in the sanatorium grounds.|$|E

5|$|The agents find Banton at {{the train}} station, but he runs to a poorly lit area. He {{declares}} that walking into his shadow will kill the agents, so Mulder shoots out the overhead lights. Banton allows himself to be taken <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> hospital, where he is put {{in a room with}} soft light per his own request.
