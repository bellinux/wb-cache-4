40|$|Effect of <b>the</b> <b>polishing</b> plane {{vibration}} on large-size optical workpieces {{in continuous}} <b>polishing</b> is studied. <b>The</b> vibration equation was deduced {{based on the}} existence of inclination between <b>the</b> <b>polishing</b> plane and z-axis direction.

40|$|Abstract. To {{help reduce}} the {{environmental}} impact of abrasive polishing, we have investigated the use of a compact robot and fixed-abrasive polishing. We used a five-joint closed-link compact robot with a fine diamond stone on its main axis to <b>polish</b> <b>the</b> glass plate and measured <b>the</b> <b>polishing</b> pressure(=pressing force/stone constant area), <b>the</b> <b>polishing</b> force, and <b>the</b> material removal rate. From these results, we investigated the relationship between <b>the</b> <b>polishing</b> pressure and <b>the</b> <b>polishing</b> force and between <b>the</b> <b>polishing</b> pressure and <b>the</b> material removal rate. We found that there is an interesting relationship between <b>the</b> <b>polishing</b> pressure and polishing force, which is not simply proportional but exponential, that the friction coefficient(=polishing force/pressing force) increases as <b>the</b> <b>polishing</b> pressure increases, and that by focusing on the friction coefficient, we can estimate the material removal rate...|$|R
30|$|In {{terms of}} {{mechanical}} <b>polishing,</b> <b>the</b> <b>polishing</b> velocity and polishing pressure {{can be controlled}} by computer numerical control (CNC) machine precisely.

30|$|As <b>the</b> <b>polishing</b> {{surface is}} highly nondeterministic, {{one of the}} reasons is that <b>the</b> <b>polishing</b> path of <b>the</b> tool affects the removal considerably.

A lots of polishing paths in mechanical polishing process can be found in literatures [13]-[18]. The ultimate goal of the research about different polishing removal function is to select an optimal polishing path so as to avoid any under-polishing and over-polishing phenomenon and ensure the uniformity of <b>the</b> <b>polishing</b> process.

40|$|Purpose: As a {{continuation}} of a previous paper [1], the report demonstrates the various possibilities of float <b>polishing</b> utilizing <b>the</b> present improved magnetic compound fluid (MCF). The MCF developed by one of authors, Shimada, in 2001, was improved {{by the addition of}} α-cellulose, thereby achieving a clearance as great as 8 mm as shown in another paper [1]. The present paper describes the possibility of the application of <b>the</b> MCF float <b>polishing</b> technique with α-cellulose. Design/methodology/approach: First, the results obtained under various <b>polishing</b> conditions of <b>the</b> MCF float <b>polishing</b> technique are described. These conditions include the various shapes of the magnet employed in <b>the</b> <b>polishing</b> tool, magnetic field strength, the concentration of α-cellulose, the motion of the specimen, the existence of a magnet fixed underneath <b>the</b> <b>polished</b> specimen, and initial surface roughness. Secondly, the present MCF float polishing technique can be used in many types of <b>polishing,</b> including <b>polishing</b> <b>the</b> inner surface of an acrylic resin tube, a wide flat surface {{through the use of a}} orbital polishing tool, and simultaneous float polishing of all surfaces of a three-dimensional complex shape. In addition, as other examples, <b>the</b> <b>polishing</b> on <b>the</b> integrated circuit (IC) substrate is shown. Findings: By <b>the</b> various <b>polishing</b> conditions of <b>the</b> MCF float <b>polishing</b> technique, <b>the</b> <b>polishing</b> effect is changed. On the other hand, as for the many applications of <b>the</b> MCF float <b>polishing,</b> inner surface, wide flat surface, rough initial surface, three-dimensional complex shape and IC substrate can be <b>polished.</b> Research limitations/implications: <b>The</b> data under various <b>polishing</b> conditions of <b>the</b> MCF float <b>polishing</b> technique helps to clarify <b>the</b> present <b>polishing</b> technique’s possible practical applications. As shown in a previous paper [1], since MCF contains long magnetic clusters, <b>the</b> present <b>polishing</b> technique allows float polishing with large clearance. Therefore, many applications of <b>the</b> MCF float <b>polishing</b> are useful in <b>the</b> <b>polishing</b> fields. Practical implications: The present study indicates the practical application in <b>the</b> <b>polishing.</b> Originality/value: <b>The</b> present technique of MCF float polishing is new in the field of float <b>polishing.</b> In addition, <b>the</b> ordinary float <b>polishing</b> technique having large clearance has not been proposed.

30|$|The G is just adopted for {{approximately}} evaluating the graphitization, {{but not the}} exact graphite content in the diamond film, due {{to the neglect of}} different sensitivities of the Raman signal to the different carbon phases [44].
