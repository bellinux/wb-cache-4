50|$|No-till farming (also called {{zero tillage}} or direct drilling) {{is a way}} of growing crops or pasture from year to year without {{disturbing}} the soil through tillage. No-till is an agricultural technique which increases the amount of water that infiltrates into the soil and increases organic matter retention and cycling of nutrients in the soil. In many agricultural regions it can reduce or eliminate soil erosion. It increases the amount and variety of life in and on the soil, including disease-causing organisms and disease suppression organisms. The most powerful benefit of no-tillage is improvement in soil biological fertility, making soils more resilient. Farm operations are made much more efficient, particularly improved time of sowing and better <b>trafficability</b> of farm operations.|$|E

50|$|Soils are {{the product}} of climate, organisms and topography, acting on parent (geologic) {{material}} over time. Thus the great diversity of geologic materials, geomorphic processes, climatic conditions, biotic assemblages and land surface ages in the United States is responsible for the presence of an enormous variety of mineral and organic soils. (Most of the mineral soils contain significant quantities of organic matter, but not enough to qualify for classification as organic soils.) The inorganic particles of different mineral soils vary greatly in size distribution, often as a result of transport and deposition of the parent material from which the soil is formed. Examples include loess (wind-deposited silt), dune sands, alluvial (river-deposited) sands and silts, and glacial till (which may include substantial amounts of clay, silt, sand, gravel and larger particles). Compared with sands (0.05 to 2 mm in diameter), silts (0.002 to 0.05 mm in diameter) have a very much larger specific surface (i.e. particle surface area per unit mass). At the surface of a particle, weathering processes occur. If the particle contains potential plant nutrients in mineral form, such processes result in release of the nutrients in readily available, ionic form. Thus, high specific surface is a major reason why silty soils tend to be relatively fertile. Clay particles are finer than silt, being less than 0.002 mm in diameter. Water retention tends to be greater in the finer-textured soils. If a fine-textured soil is well aggregated (with aggregates consisting of numerous organic and inorganic particles bonded together), the large pores between aggregates will facilitate drainage and aeration. (In contrast, drainage and aeration can be poor in poorly aggregated fine-textured soils in which nearly all of the pore space consists of fine pores.) Drainage is usually good and <b>trafficability</b> is usually superior in the coarser-textured soils. While some of the clay in a soil may have been inherited in the parent material, older soils might contain a significant amount of clay formed by weathering processes during soil formation. Soils with a high concentration of clay and organic matter tend to have considerable net negative electrical charge, conferring ability to retain many plant nutrient cations (e.g. Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, NH4+), readily available to plants by ion exchange. Plant nutrients are also released from soil organic matter by decomposition, and organic matter is particularly significant as the major form in which soil nitrogen is stored. Organic matter contributes to aggregation and water-retention properties of soil. Soil chemical composition reflects not only the original geologic materials (e.g. limestone, granite, basalt), but also soil-forming processes since deposition. In much of the northern US, soil formation commenced either shortly after glacial retreat {{at the end of the}} last Ice Age, or even more recently. Elsewhere in the US, one may find some older land surfaces where soil formation has occurred over a much longer period, in addition to some young soils.|$|E

Military terrain analysts have a requirement for an automated tool to conduct <b>trafficability</b> analysis {{as part of a larger}} decision-support framework. The proof-of-concept system described in this article uses an expert system to combine the outputs of various geography modules into an estimate of <b>trafficability.</b> The unique aspects of this system are its rating of <b>trafficability</b> as a floatingpoint number between zero and one; the use of a confidence measure to assess the accuracy of the <b>trafficability</b> prediction; and its consideration of the capabilities of individual vehicles with respect to slope, vegetation, and soil conditions.

40|$|Soil {{moisture}} is {{an important}} environmental variable that impacts military operations and weapons systems. Accurate and timely forecasts of soil moisture at appropriate spatial scales, therefore, are important for mission planning. We present an application of a soil moisture data assimilation system to military <b>trafficability</b> assessment. The data assimilation system combines hillslope-scale (e. g., 10 s to 100 s of m) estimates of soil moisture from a hydrologic model with synthetic L-band microwave radar observations broadly consistent with the planned NASA Soil Moisture Active–Passive (SMAP) mission. Soil moisture outputs from the data assimilation system are input to a simple index-based model for vehicle <b>trafficability.</b> Since the data assimilation system uses the ensemble Kalman Filter, the risks of impaired <b>trafficability</b> due to uncertainties in the observations and model inputs can be quantified. Assimilating the remote sensing observations leads to significantly different predictions of <b>trafficability</b> conditions and associated risk of impaired <b>trafficability,</b> compared to an approach that propagates forward uncertainties in model inputs without assimilation. Specifically, assimilating the observations is associated {{with an increase in}} the risk of “slow go” conditions in approximately two-thirds of the watershed, and an increase in the risk of “no go” conditions in approximately 40 % of the watershed. Despite the simplicity of the <b>trafficability</b> assessment tool, results suggest that ensemble-based data assimilation can potentially improve <b>trafficability</b> assessment by constraining predictions to observations and facilitating quantitative assessment of the risk of impaired <b>trafficability...</b>|$|E
40|$|On a {{regional}} scale, many management concerns, such as agricultural planning and water contamination management, require {{information regarding the}} diversity and location of agricultural practices. One means of obtaining this information is to search for spatially explicit indicators that correspond to factors that drive agricultural practices. The objective of our study {{was to assess the}} role of soil <b>trafficability</b> on the distribution of soil surface management practices in a Mediterranean vine-growing region characterised by water contamination by herbicides. Soil surface management relies on different combinations of technologies such as shallow tillage, chemical weeding, and grass cover. We hypothesised that soils characterised by low <b>trafficability</b> were {{associated with the use of}} chemical weeding or grass cover in alleys that tractors use while spraying pesticides. Here, data on practices were collected by survey at the plot resolution. Soil <b>trafficability</b> was evaluated based on an expert classification of the soil units of a 1 : 25, 000 soil map. Using classification trees, we tested the ability of the following three explanatory variables to determine the choice of practice: (1) the <b>trafficability</b> of the plot, (2) the percentage of plots with low <b>trafficability</b> within the vineyard of the farm holding, and (3) the wine grower residence place. Our results show that the <b>trafficability</b> classifies 59 % of plots. The percentage of plots with low <b>trafficability</b> classifies 76 % of plots. The wine grower residence place classifies 84 % of the plots. Although the choice of practice correlated with soil <b>trafficability,</b> the residence place of the wine grower unexpectedly over-determined the practice choice. As a consequence, our findings evidence a spatial variability of the role of soil in the distribution of soil surface management practices. In addition, soil <b>trafficability</b> cannot be used as major indicator of the practice spatial distribution...|$|E

30|$|For track-based robots, an {{important}} aspect is the suppression design, which determines the <b>trafficability</b> and comfort of the whole system. The <b>trafficability</b> limits the robot’s working capability, and the riding comfort limits the robot’s working effectiveness, especially with some sensitive instruments mounted on or operated. To these aims, a track-based robot equipped with a novel passive bio-inspired suspension is designed and studied systematically in this paper. Animal or insects have very special leg or limb structures which are good for motion control and adaptable to different environments. Inspired by this, a new track-based robot is designed with novel “legs” for connecting the loading wheels to the robot body. Each leg is designed with passive structures and can achieve very high loading capacity but low dynamic stiffness such that the robot can move on rough ground similar to a multi-leg animal or insect. Therefore, the <b>trafficability</b> and riding comfort can be significantly improved without losing loading capacity. The new track-based robot can be well applied to various engineering tasks for providing a stable moving platform of high mobility, better <b>trafficability</b> and excellent loading capacity.|$|E

In February and March 2010, the Naval Research Laboratory sponsored a multi-sensor remote sensing and field calibration and field validation campaign (CNMI' 10). The team traveled to the islands of Pagan, Tinian, and Guam located in the Marianas archipelago. Airborne hyperspectral imagery along with ground truth data was collected from shallow water lagoons, beachfronts, vegetation, and anomalies such as World War II relics. In this thesis, beachfront hyperspectral data obtained on site {{was used as a}} reference library for evaluation against airborne hyperspectral data and ground truth data in order to determine soil strength for creating <b>trafficability</b> maps.

40|$|Soil {{moisture}} is {{a critical}} environmental variable that impacts military <b>trafficability</b> through its impact on soil load bearing capacity. Adequate knowledge of soil moisture at scales of individual hillslopes (10 s to 100 s of m) would substantially improve efforts to assess <b>trafficability</b> and assist in erosion mitigation strategies on military lands. Field-based observations of soil moisture at the necessary high resolution over large areas is impractical, particularly for many Army operations. On the other hand, hydrologic models can simulate spatial patterns in moisture at the required scales, but are subject to errors in the model inputs and formulation. Anticipated L-band microwave remote sensing platforms offer accurate global observation of geo-physically obervable quantities {{that are related to}} soil moisture at revisit intervals of 2 - 3 days, but are too coarse in spatial scale for <b>trafficability</b> assessment. Numerical data assimilation provides a mathematical framework to leverage the benefits of models and remotely sensed observations, while potentially compensating for their respective weaknesses. This work provides a proof-of-concept illustration of how data assimilation with the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) can be used to improve hillslope-scale estimates of soil moisture. In a synthetic experiment in the Walnut Gulch experimental watershed in Arizona, USA, we show that immediately after a rainfall event, ingesting L-band microwave radar data into a watershed ecohydrology model using the EnKF increases the accuracy in a watershed-scale mapping of <b>trafficability.</b> Moreover, we demonstrate how the estimate of uncertainty in soil moisture provided by the EnKF can be used to convey risk in <b>trafficability</b> assessment...|$|E

Reliable information on terrain <b>trafficability,</b> that is, the ability of terrain to support the passage of vehicles, would enable significant enhancement of wood procurement planning and reduction of soil damage. The objective here {{was to determine the}} feasibility of airborne scanning light detection and ranging (LiDAR) -derived digital terrain models (DTM) in terrain <b>trafficability</b> mapping. Soil damage was inventoried from a total of 13 km of forwarding trails, and a logistic regression model was fitted for predicting the event of soil damage. DTM-derived soil wetness indices performed well as predictor variables, and DTM-derived local binary patterns also proved useful in terrain <b>trafficability</b> mapping. A prediction accuracy of 83. 6 % (Cohen’s kappa of 0. 38) was observed for soil damage probability modelling, using only DTM-derived predictors, and a corresponding accuracy of 85. 0 % (kappa of 0. 45) was achieved when an existing soil map was used as well. In addition to the topography-related features, soil stoniness proved to be a critical factor affecting soil resistance to rutting.
