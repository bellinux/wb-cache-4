In exchange for clearing his record, he's asked to recover a [...] "black box" [...] from mathematician Dr. Gunter Janek, who has developed the box under the project name [...] "Setec Astronomy" [...] supposedly for the Russian government. Martin is hesitant but agrees to help. With help from his former girlfriend, Liz, Martin and his team secure the box, which is disguised as a <b>telephone</b> <b>answering</b> <b>machine.</b> During their subsequent celebration party, Whistler, Mother, and Carl investigate the box, finding it capable of breaking the encryption of nearly every computer system. Martin works out that [...] "Setec Astronomy" [...] is an anagram of [...] "too many secrets", and issues a lockdown until they can deliver the box the next day.|$|E

50|$|Portable audio formats: 8-track and four-track {{cartridges}} vs. Compact Cassette, and {{the lesser}} known and largely forgotten Deutsche Cassette (introduced by Grundig). While rather successful into the mid-to-late 1970s, the 8-track eventually lost out due to technical limitations, including variable audio quality and inability to be rewound. Similarly the smaller formats of microcassette, developed by Olympus, and minicassette, developed by Sony, were manufactured for applications requiring lower audio fidelity such as dictation and <b>telephone</b> <b>answering</b> <b>machines.</b>|$|R
50|$|Tape-based <b>telephone</b> <b>answering</b> <b>machines</b> {{had come}} into the {{residential}} telephone market, but they weren't used much in the corporate environment due to physical limitations of the technology. One <b>answering</b> <b>machine</b> was needed for each telephone; messages couldn't be recorded if the user was using the phone; messages had to be retrieved in sequential order; and messages couldn't be retrieved remotely, selectively discarded, saved, or forwarded to others. Further, the manufacturers of PBXs (private branch exchanges—the name for corporate phone systems) used proprietary digital phone sets in order to increase the functionality and value of the PBX. These phone sets were, by design, incompatible with <b>answering</b> <b>machines.</b>|$|R
50|$|To {{prevent the}} DSL signal from {{entering}} the phone lines into <b>telephones,</b> <b>answering</b> <b>machines,</b> faxes and other devices where it could cause interference, DSL modems come with low pass filters which must be plugged into the phone lines going to all voiceband devices on the same line. The filter blocks all frequencies above 4 kHz, so it blocks the DSL signal while allowing voice frequency signals through. A filter must not be inserted in the phone line going to the DSL modem, because it would block the communication between the modem and switching center.|$|R

50|$|The term {{is often}} used more loosely for any device that {{continuously}} must use {{a small amount of}} power even when not active; for example a <b>telephone</b> <b>answering</b> <b>machine</b> must be available at all times to receive calls, switching off to save power is not an option. Timers, powered thermostats, and the like are other examples. An uninterruptible power supply could be considered to be wasting standby power only when the computer it protects is off. Disconnecting standby power proper is at worst inconvenient; powering down completely, for example an answering machine not dealing with a call, renders it useless.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Increased {{incidence}} of <b>telephone</b> <b>answering</b> <b>machines</b> {{and the use}} of such devices to screen calls pose a potential threat to the representativeness of samples in telephone surveys.

Results show that at most two to three percent of households use <b>answering</b> <b>machines</b> to screen calls, and that such screening is more likely to take place in households with higher family incomes, outside rural areas, and which include individuals who are younger and have higher levels of education.

50|$|Their early {{product was}} AudioFile Business Audio, {{a suite of}} {{applications}} that included AudioRecorder, a program to embed audio into email and documents, and AudioEditor, a program to edit audio and apply various effects to the audio. The software included Audio timescale-pitch modification, the ability to change the speed of audio without changing the pitch, and a codec to compress audio to approximately 36 {{times the size of}} uncompressed audio to save disk space and reduce bandwidth when sending via email. AudioFile Business Audio evolved into TalkWorks, a program designed to allow computers equipped with an appropriate fax-modem to act as a software-based <b>telephone</b> <b>answering</b> <b>machine,</b> for receiving voice mail as well as faxes, and a virtual telephone/speaker phone with speed dial and other buttons.|$|E
5000|$|Philips {{introduced}} the first combination portable radio and cassette recorder, which was marketed as the [...] "radiorecorder", {{and is now}} {{better known as the}} boom box. Later, the cassette was used in <b>telephone</b> <b>answering</b> <b>machines,</b> including a special form of cassette where the tape was wound on an endless loop. The C-cassette was used as the first mass storage device for early personal computers in the 1970s and 1980s. Philips reduced the cassette size for the professional needs with the Mini-Cassette, although it would not be as successful as the Olympus Microcassette. This became the predominant dictation medium up to the advent of fully digital dictation machines.|$|R
2500|$|Cassettes {{remained}} {{popular for}} specific applications, such as car audio and <b>telephone</b> <b>answering</b> <b>machines,</b> {{well into the}} 1990s. Cassettes and their players were typically more rugged and resistant to dust, heat, and shocks than the main digital competitor, the CD. Their lower fidelity was not considered a serious drawback. However, the advent of [...] "shock proof" [...] buffering technology in CD players, the general heightening of consumer expectations, {{and the introduction of}} CD auto-changers meant that, by the early 2000s, the CD player rapidly replaced the cassette player as the default audio component in the majority of new vehicles in Europe and America. The last new car with an available cassette player was a 2010 Lexus SC 430.|$|R
