50|$|England {{made more}} {{changes to the}} {{starting}} XV, {{some of the changes}} forced due to injury. Most of the changes occurred in the backline; Ben Foden replaced the injured Mike Brown at fullback, and Jonathan Joseph was given his first <b>Test</b> <b>start</b> after Brad Barritt was sidelined with a lacerated eyeball. This also meant that Manu Tuilagi was shifted from outside centre to inside centre to accommodate Joseph at number 13. Foden's shift to fullback meant David Strettle was handed a starting berth on the wing. Toby Flood replaced Owen Farrell at fly-half. Up front the only change was the inclusion of Thomas Waldrom after Phil Dowson was sent home with a hamstring injury.|$|E

In 2006 WiMAX was used in China, India, Indonesia, Taiwan and the United States. In autumn 2008 Skartel was the first company in Russia to deploy WiMAX standard network in Moscow and St. Petersburg {{in a range of}} 2.5-2.7 GHz. In 2010 Yota announced its plans to launch LTE on its network. The first <b>test</b> <b>start</b> of the new standard network took place in Kazan on 30 August 2010. The subscribers gained access to the Internet at a rate of 20-30 Mbit/s. About 150 base stations have been installed in Kazan. The investments into the LTE network deployment constituted $20 million. The fourth generation LTE network, which was tested by the Yota provider in Kazan, was switched off the next day. At that point, Yota had no interest to use a 4G standard network in a commercial or test mode. Today the users of Yota have access to LTE standard Internet services in nine cities of Russia. By 2014 Yota plans to launch 4G in 180 Russian cities.|$|E

On 10 June 2017, Murray made his first appearance and start for the Lions on the tour, doing so in the match against the Crusaders in AMI Stadium. On 17 June, Murray made his second appearance of the tour, starting in the Lions record 10-32 victory against the Māori All Blacks in Rotorua International Stadium. On 24 June, Murray started for the Lions in their 30-15 first test defeat against New Zealand in Eden Park, making his first <b>test</b> <b>start</b> for the side. On 1 July, Murray started the second test against the All Blacks, scoring a try in the Lions 21-24 victory in Westpac Stadium. It was the Lions' first test win against New Zealand since 1993 {{and the first time}} New Zealand had lost a test at home since losing to South Africa in 2009. Murray's try made him the first northern hemisphere player to score four tries against New Zealand. On 8 July, Murray started in the third and final test, a 15-15 draw which meant the series against the All Blacks ended in a draw as well.|$|E
30|$|Observations of {{microbial}} biomass {{over time}} in manually spiked sludge match those of the pristine material. The pristine material leads to inhibition of microbial biomass {{at the beginning of}} the test, which declined until no effect was observed at test end (28 days). Through STP, no inhibition was observed at <b>test</b> <b>start</b> due to the masking of NM- 300 K and silver nitrate by sludge. After 60 days, the easily degradable portion of the sludge was degraded and the NM- 300 K and silver nitrate inhibited microbial biomass. The observed effects decreased (100 days) until no effect was observed at test end (140 days). Effects of STP-spiked sludge occurred later in the test, and lack of full recovery of microbial biomass was most likely because of the limited duration of the experiment (max. 180 days). Different seasonal <b>test</b> <b>start</b> dates (manual spiking: July 2011, STP simulation: March 2012) and subsequent field sampling times and vegetation differences may have affected the composition of the soil microflora that resulted in the different time course.|$|E

Methods: Using data from a large ethnographic qualitative study in a resource poor rural setting in Zambia, this paper examines and documents the critical role of food supplements in influencing people to go for HIV testing, initiate treatment and stick to it. Results: Findings show that people who felt food insecure were reluctant {{to go for a}} test, thereby not accessing treatment and care services. The narratives revealed numerous aspects of food supplements, HIV testing, ART uptake and adherence, including desire to have access to food due to food insecurity, hoping and wishing to be found positive to access food, envying the HIV positive accessing food, desiring to have physical transformation and healthy-looking bodies enabled by increased access to food, reluctance and avoidance of taking the drugs without food, and worries about food once on medication. Conclusion: The study has shown a close link between food supplements, willingness to <b>test,</b> <b>start</b> taking medication and adherence. Therefore, food supplement...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} aerodynamic tests (wind tunnel test) for a {{model of}} secondary cabin roof (SCR) applied in BMW M 3 E 92 Coupe. SCR is a vehicle accessory installed on vehicle roof useful to block heats from sun while the car parking. The test were conducted at UPT-Laboratorium Aero Gas Dinamika dan Getaran (LAGG) -BPPT, PUSPITEK, Serpong, to determine lift and drag coefficient (cl and cd) of vehicle. This model with scale of 1 : 4. 5 was tested with rigid body made by wood. The SCR model has been made from aluminium and has two kinds of type, which are A and B. The model test was carried out with the following parameters: wind speed of 15, 20 m/s, then 1, 5 cm and 2, 5 cm for height of SCR from roof. Before the <b>test</b> <b>start,</b> {{the first things that}} must be done is preparation the tools for test, next step is calibration of external balance in wind tunnel to obtain matrix of calibration. The inverse of this matrix named matrix of test will be used as a multiply factor to voltage measurement from result test of external balance while <b>test</b> <b>start.</b> Output from this multiply is aerodynamic forces experienced by model test. Installing SCR made some change to aerodynamic experienced by vehicle. From data of test, installing SCR type B with height 1, 5 cm rom roof, the smallest cl can be obtained for each variation of velocity are 0, 3 for 15 m/s and 0, 29 for 20 m/s. Meanwhile, installing SCR type A with height 2, 5 cm from roof, the smallest cd be obtained for each variation of velocity are 0, 368 for 15 m/s and 0, 355 for 20 m/s. This results are valid if only the flow regime of two corresponding fluid are same and with the same model too...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} an {{experimental}} study aimed {{to assess the}} effect of mixing different organic wastes on the anaerobic digestion process. In particular, livestock manure and organic solid wastes have been taken into account as substrates, to verify if their mixing gives rise to higher methane production rates and lower risk of process failure. Bio-Methane Potential (BMP) tests have been conducted using the following substrates: buffalo manure (BM), poultry manure (PM), organic fraction of the municipal solid waste (OFMSW), greengrocery waste (GW) and two different mixtures composed of BM and OFMSW. Mixing BM with OFMSW resulted in 12 and 30 % higher methane volumes after 30 and 15 days from the <b>test</b> <b>start,</b> respectively.

40|$|In general, {{the goal}} of test {{automation}} is to reduce test time, to decrease the amount of manual labor and to increase the test coverage. In a time-to-market environment, like ASML, {{the primary goal of}} test automation is to minimize the total test duration. The total test duration is the time between <b>test</b> <b>start</b> and the moment that the system is fault free, so including diagnosing and fixing faults. Therefore, the total test duration is not only depending on the test case duration, also the diagnosis and fix duration (the fix-loop) influences the total test duration. Time to market can also be reduced by using a parallel test and fix strategy. In this strategy, available fixes are integrated on the system under test as soon as possible. Applying fixes as soon as possible results in fewer test cases failed in the remainder of the test phase, however the fixes may introduce new faults as well. The influence on total test duration of both applying test automation and aplying a parallel test and fix strategy has been investigated...|$|E
30|$|In the bioassays, varying {{concentrations}} of Fe and Al {{may influence the}} toxicity of Cu, while BLM-calculated toxicity will not be affected, as these metals are not among the model input parameters. For this reason, {{it is not surprising}} that the BLM estimates were best correlated with DOC, as DOC supposedly is one of the most important input variables in current BLM versions. However, bioassay results suggested that Fe, especially in combination with Al, is as important as DOC for the Cu toxicity to the tested organisms (Fig.  2). An additional explanation for the overestimation of toxicity in Älgsjön could be connected to the high Fe and DOC content in the lake, creating humus-iron aggregates as well as inorganic colloidal and particulate Fe-forms, such as ferrihydrite, which are fairly adsorptive for other trace metals, including Cu [31]. Even though the water was filtrated, aggregates could have been formed during the time between the filtration and the <b>test</b> <b>start.</b> These strong adsorbents may influence the Cu-speciation and could contribute to a decreased concentration of free Cu-ions in the dissolved bioavailable phase, which then would decrease the toxicity.|$|E
