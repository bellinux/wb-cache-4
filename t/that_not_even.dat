5|$|General {{relativity}} (GR) is {{a theory}} of gravitation that was developed by Einstein between 1907 and 1915. According to general relativity, the observed gravitational attraction between masses results from the warping {{of space and time}} by those masses. General relativity has developed into an essential tool in modern astrophysics. It provides the foundation for the current understanding of black holes, regions of space where gravitational attraction is so strong <b>that</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> light can escape.|$|E
5|$|When mass is {{concentrated}} into a sufficiently compact region of space, general relativity predicts {{the formation of}} a black hole– a region of space with a gravitational effect so strong <b>that</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> light can escape. Certain types of black holes are thought to be the final state in the evolution of massive stars. On the other hand, supermassive black holes with the mass of millions or billions of Suns are assumed to reside in the cores of most galaxies, and they {{play a key role in}} current models of how galaxies have formed over the past billions of years.|$|E
5|$|Geoffrey Rush as Captain Hector Barbossa: The former {{captain of}} the Black Pearl is resurrected during this film; however, he does not appear until the final shot before the credits. Having met his demise in the {{previous}} installment, Barbossa is resurrected by Tia Dalma and agrees to rescue Jack Sparrow {{in order to save}} the Black Pearl. For this role, Rush was uncredited to keep his return a surprise. The DVD commentary said <b>that</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> the cast of the movie knew that Rush would return his character, and that the expressions on the characters' faces when seeing {{him for the first time}} in three years were real.|$|E

5|$|Opposition {{initially}} {{came from}} Pennsylvania's House of Representatives protesting the tax. William Maclay had noted <b>that</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> the Pennsylvanian legislators {{had been able}} to enforce excise taxes in the western regions of the state. Hamilton was aware of the potential difficulties and proposed inspectors the ability to search buildings that distillers were designated to store their spirits, and would be able to search suspected illegal storage facilities to confiscate contraband with a warrant. Although the inspectors were not allowed to search houses and warehouses, they were to visit twice a day and file weekly reports in extensive detail. Hamilton cautioned against expedited judicial means, and favored a jury trial with potential offenders. As soon as 1791 locals began to shun or threaten inspectors, as they felt the inspection methods were intrusive. Inspectors were also tarred and feathered, blindfolded, and whipped. Hamilton had attempted to appease the opposition with lowered tax rates, but it did not suffice.|$|E
5|$|Rojhaz {{is in fact}} Steve Rogers, {{the future}} costumed superhero known as Captain America. After {{fighting}} against a future fascist government dictatorship of the 21st century run by the President-For-Life, Rogers was captured. Wanting to dispose of Rogers so completely <b>that</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> his ashes would remain to inspire future rebellion, the President-for-Life had Rogers placed into a machine which should have killed him but instead sent him into the 1602 timeline. His presence not only brought about a rift that will destroy the universe, but it also caused the heroes {{of the twentieth century}} to appear centuries earlier to counter the Forerunner's negative effects.|$|E
5|$|What then is {{the spirit}} of liberty? I cannot define it; I {{can only tell you}} my own faith. The spirit of liberty is the spirit which is not too sure that it is right; the spirit of liberty is the spirit which seeks to {{understand}} the minds of other men and women; the spirit of liberty is the spirit which weighs their interests alongside its own without bias; the spirit of liberty remembers <b>that</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> a sparrow falls to earth unheeded; the spirit of liberty is the spirit of Him who, near two thousand years ago, taught mankind that lesson it has never learned, but has never quite forgotten; {{that there may be a}} kingdom where the least shall be heard and considered side by side with the greatest.|$|E

The wrathful Yama assumed a fearsome form and threw his noose to capture Markandeya, who hugged the linga tightly.
