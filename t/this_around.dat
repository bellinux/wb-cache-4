This 4000 soldiers from Csallóköz assured the contact between the troops to North and to South from the Danube.

25|$|Throughout the Plantagenet era an English Gothic {{architecture}} flourished—the medieval cathedrals such as Canterbury Cathedral, Westminster Abbey and York Minster {{are prime}} examples. Expanding on the Norman base {{there was also}} castles, palaces, great houses, universities and parish churches. Medieval architecture was completed with the 16th century Tudor style; the four-centred arch, {{now known as the}} Tudor arch, was a defining feature as were wattle and daub houses domestically. In the aftermath of the Renaissance, the English Baroque style appeared, which architect Christopher Wren particularly championed. English Baroque is a casual term, sometimes used to refer to the developments in English architecture that were parallel to the evolution of Baroque architecture in continental Europe between the Great Fire of London (1666) and the Treaty of Utrecht (1713). Queen Anne Style architecture flourished in England from about 1660 to about 1720, even though the Queen's reign covered only the period 1702-1714. Buildings in the Queen Anne style are strongly influenced by Dutch domestic architecture: typically, they are simple rectilinear designs in red brick, with an undemonstrative charm. Georgian architecture followed in a more refined style, evoking a simple Palladian form; the Royal Crescent at Bath {{is one of the best}} examples of this. With the emergence of romanticism during Victorian period, a Gothic Revival was launched—in addition to <b>this</b> <b>around</b> the same time the Industrial Revolution paved the way for buildings such as The Crystal Palace.

2500|$|In {{the very}} late 19th century and early 20th century, the {{historic}} center of Mexico City was deteriorating as its colonial and Baroque buildings {{came to be}} seen as antiquidated. Many of the city’s elite moved to new neighborhoods being constructed in the western suburbs along Paseo de la Reforma. Around the 1880s, the city had west past Colonia Santa Maria de la Ribera, enveloping the areas where now are found the streets named Donato Guerra, Antonio Caso, Balderas, Chapultepec and Bucareli. Just beyond <b>this</b> <b>around</b> 1887, there were still groves and cornfields; however, soon to be built were the streets named Roma, Milán, Lucerna, Dinamarca, Hamburgo, Londres, Berlín, Río Neva, Río Amazonas and Avenida de los Insurgentes, which form the heart of Colonia Juarez. [...] Many of the new streets were named after European capital due to early resident and ex-consulate of Mexico Ricardo García Granado, as his children had been born in some of these cities as he performed his diplomatic duties.|$|E
2500|$|In 1939, {{diplomatic}} relations between Egypt and Iran were upgraded to ambassadorial level, and Youssef Zulficar Pasha was appointed as Egypt's first ambassador in Tehran. In the same year, Princess Fawzia of Egypt, {{the sister of}} King Farouk I, married Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the then crown prince (later shah) of Iran. The relationship between Iran and Egypt had fallen into open hostility under Gamal Abdul Nasser presidency. Following his death in 1970, President Sadat turned <b>this</b> <b>around</b> quickly into an open and cordial friendship. [...] In 1971, Sadat addressed the Iranian parliament in Tehran in fluent Persian, describing the 2500-year-old historic connectivity between the two nations. Overnight, Egypt and Iran were turned from bitter enemies into fast friends. The relationship between Cairo and Tehran became so friendly that the Shah of Iran (Persia), Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, called Sadat his [...] "dear brother." [...] After the 1973 war with Israel, Iran assumed {{a leading role in}} cleaning up and reactivating the blocked Suez Canal with heavy investment. Iran also facilitated the withdrawal of Israel from the occupied Sinai Peninsula by promising to substitute with free Iranian oil the loss of the oil to the Israelis if they withdrew from the Egyptian oil wells in Western Sinai. All these added more to the personal friendship between Sadat and the Shah of Iran.|$|E
2500|$|Purportedly {{the largest}} single {{massacre}} of Jews in the war's history, it involved mass shootings, hangings, acts of immolation and a mass detonation. Antonescu is quoted saying that the Romanian Army's criminal acts were [...] "reprisals, not massacres". Survivors were deported to the nearby settlement of Slobidka, and kept in inhumane conditions. Alexianu himself intervened with Antonescu for a solution to their problems, but the Romanian leader decided he wanted {{them out of the}} Odessa area, citing the nearby resistance of Soviet troops in the Siege of Sevastopol as a ferment for similar Jewish activities. His order to Alexianu specified: [...] "Pack them into the catacombs, throw them into the Black Sea, but get them out of Odessa. I don't want to know. A hundred can die, a thousand can die, all of them can die, but I don't want a single Romanian official or officer to die." [...] Defining the presence of Jews in occupied Odessa as [...] "a crime", Antonescu added: [...] "I don't want to stain my activity with such lack of foresight." [...] As a result of <b>this,</b> <b>around</b> 35,000–40,000 Jewish people were deported out of Odessa area and into other sectors of Transnistria. Several thousands were purposefully driven into Berezivka and other areas inhabited by the Black Sea Germans, where Selbstschutz organizations massacred them.|$|E
