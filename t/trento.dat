5|$|On 67 July 1933, <b>Trento</b> {{took part}} in a major fleet review held in the Gulf of Naples for Italian {{dictator}} Benito Mussolini. <b>Trento</b> became the flagship of the 2nd Division, 1st Squadron on 2 December. The ship visited Durazzo on 2326 June 1934, and on 1 July, became the flagship of the 3rd Division. She made another cruise in the eastern Mediterranean from 8 to 20 March 1935, during which she made calls in Rhodes and Leros. On 18 June, Trieste temporarily relieved <b>Trento</b> as the divisional flagship. Another naval review was held in the Gulf of Naples on 27 November 1936, to honor the Regent of Hungary, Miklós Horthy, who was visiting Italy at the time. Trieste again replaced <b>Trento</b> as the flagship on 27 January 1937. From 10 to 12 March 1937, Mussolini took a short tour of Italian Libya aboard the heavy cruiser , escorted by <b>Trento.</b> The two cruisers stopped in Benghazi, Tripoli, and Ra's Lanuf during the trip.|$|E
5|$|Later in the day, Vittorio Veneto and Pola were torpedoed by British aircraft, {{the latter}} left immobilized. <b>Trento,</b> Trieste, and Bolzano were also {{attacked}} by aircraft, but they escaped without damage. <b>Trento</b> reached Taranto in {{company with the}} damaged Vittorio Veneto at 15:30 the following day. In the meantime, Pola and two other Zara-class cruisers were destroyed in the night action with British battleships late on the 28th.|$|E
5|$|On 10 June 1940, Italy {{declared}} war on France and Britain, joining its ally Germany in World War II. At that time, <b>Trento</b> was stationed in Messina, once again the flagship of the 3rd Division. The following day, <b>Trento</b> {{and the rest of}} the 3rd Division joined the 6th Division for a patrol in the Strait of Sicily, where they laid a minefield. On 8 July, the 3rd Division escorted a convoy to Libya, along with the battleships of the 1st Division; the next day, the returning warships collided with a heavily protected British convoy. In the ensuing Battle of Calabria, <b>Trento</b> engaged British cruisers and was heavily attacked by British aircraft, though she emerged undamaged. A force of 120 Italian aircraft arrived after both fleets had disengaged, and some Italian pilots accidentally attacked Italian vessels, prompting the fleet to paint red stripes on the forecastles of each ship. Another convoy to Libya, which passed without incident, followed on 30 July, with <b>Trento</b> returning to Messina on 1 August. On 31 August, the 3rd Division sortied to intercept the British convoys in Operation Hats, though the Italian fleet broke off the operation without encountering the merchant ships. <b>Trento</b> arrived back in Taranto on 2 September.|$|E

5|$|In the interwar period, the two cruisers {{served in}} the Cruiser Division, {{frequently}} alternating as the divisional flagship. <b>Trento</b> made two extensive trips abroad, {{the first was a}} tour of South American countries in mid to late-1929 and the second was a deployment to China to protect Italian nationals during the Chinese Civil War. In 1938, Trieste assisted in the repatriation of Italian volunteer soldiers who had fought in Spain during the Spanish Civil War. Both ships saw extensive action in World War II, including the battles of Calabria, Cape Spartivento, and Cape Matapan. Trieste was damaged by a British submarine in November 1941 and therefore missed the First and Second Battles of Sirte, where at the latter action <b>Trento</b> damaged a British destroyer.|$|E
5|$|The 3rd Division escorted another convoy to North Africa on 1213 March 1941. Two weeks later, on 27 March, the divisionat {{this time}} {{commanded}} by Rear Admiral Luigi Sansonettisortied {{with the rest}} of the fleet for a major sweep toward the island of Crete. At 06:55 on the 28th, an IMAM Ro.43 floatplane launched by Vittorio Veneto located a British cruiser squadron, and by 07:55, <b>Trento</b> and the 3rd Division had come within visual range. Seventeen minutes later, the Italian cruisers opened fire from a range of , initiating the first phase of the Battle of Cape Matapan; in the span of the next forty minutes, <b>Trento</b> fired a total of 204armor-piercing shells, though trouble with her rangefinders and the extreme range of the action prevented her from scoring any significant hits.|$|E
5|$|The ship {{participated in}} another fleet review on 5 May 1938, this one held {{in honor of}} German {{dictator}} Adolf Hitler's state visit to Italy.

From 5 to 19 June, <b>Trento</b> joined {{the rest of the}} fleet in Livorno for the first celebration of Navy Day on 10 June. Another cruise in the eastern Mediterranean followed on 9 July, during which <b>Trento</b> stopped in Tripoli, Tobruk, Rhodes, and Leros, before returning to Taranto on the 29th of the month. From October to December, the ship underwent a major refit, which included modifications to her armament and the installation of funnel caps.|$|E

5|$|<b>Trento</b> and Trieste {{were named}} for the two largest unredeemed cities taken from Austria-Hungary in the {{aftermath}} of World War I. They frequently served as the flagship of the Cruiser Division throughout the 1930s. During the pre-war period, <b>Trento</b> made lengthy trips abroad, including a tour of South America from May to October 1929 and a deployment to China from January to June 1932 to protect Italian nationals during the Chinese Civil War. Both vessels took part in numerous naval reviews held for visiting foreign leaders in the 1930s, including Adolf Hitler of Nazi Germany and Miklós Horthy, the Regent of Hungary.

After Bonaparte won the Battle of Arcole, the French army commander drove the Tyrol Corps back to <b>Trento.</b> During the fourth attempt to relieve Mantua, Jozsef Alvinczi directed Vukassovich to lead his 6th Column down the east bank of the Adige River. His artillery supported the attack of Prince Heinrich XV of Reuss-Plauen on the west bank of the river, but he exerted little other influence on the disastrous result of the Battle of Rivoli because his troops were on the wrong side of the river.|$|E

25|$|The {{consequences}} of the Council were also significant as regards the Church's liturgy and practices. During its deliberations, the Council made the Vulgate the official example of the Biblical canon and commissioned {{the creation of a}} standard version, although this was not achieved until the 1590s. In 1565, a year after the Council finished its work, Pius IV issued the Tridentine Creed (after Tridentum, <b>Trento's</b> Latin name) and his successor Pius V then issued the Roman Catechism and revisions of the Breviary and Missal in, respectively, 1566, 1568 and 1570. These, in turn, led to the codification of the Tridentine Mass, which remained the Church's primary form of the Mass for the next four hundred years.|$|R
