40|$|Phase {{scintillation}} {{caused by}} propagation through irregularities {{in the solar}} wind, ionosphere, and troposphere, introduces noise in spacecraft radio science experiments. In precision Doppler tracking observations, scintillation can be the dominant noise source; statistics of this propagation noise are necessary for experiment planning and in design of optimum signal processing procedures. Here tracking data taken with operational spacecraft (Mars Observer, Galileo, Mars Global Surveyor) and ground systems are used to produce temporal statistics of tropospheric and charged particle phase scintillation. Using the differing transfer functions to the Doppler observable, the variance of Doppler frequency fluctuations is approximately decomposed into two propagation processes. The first, associated with distributed scattering along the sight-line in the solar wind, has a smooth spectrum.

40|$|With {{potential}} future {{deployment of}} high-density terrestrial communication sys-tems in metropolitan areas, it becomes necessary to estimate potential interference received at the Deep Space Network (DSN) Earth station from interfering sources {{distributed in the}} region. A fundamental parameter required for any realistic inter-ference analysis is the propagation loss from the transmitter to the receiver, which depends in a statistical way on the atmospheric conditions. This article introduces a method of constructing a map of propagation losses covering almost every possible location in the region, taking the terrain into account. The losses were computed with a high-resolution terrain map of the region as input, together with the heights of the transmitting and receiving antennas. The calculation includes three clear-air propagation mechanisms: diffraction, <b>tropospheric</b> <b>scattering,</b> and atmospheric ducting, {{in accordance with the}} algorithms given in the International Telecommu-nication Union Recommendation ITU-R P. 452. The resulting numerical database provides propagation-loss data necessary for interference calculations. To enhance visualization, these propagation-loss data are mapped in color. The color-coded propagation loss map provides a visible overview of the entire region of interest, indicating areas where emissions from the terrestrial sources would be effectively shielded by the terrain from reaching the DSN Earth stations, and where such emissions should be restricted for lack of terrain shielding.

40|$|In {{land mobile radio}} communications, it is {{well known}} that almost 95 % of the radio links between {{transmitter}} and receiver are non-line-of-sight. The propagation loss between transmitter and receiver is heavily dependent on the terrain features. Hence, this thesis examines and improves the CRC propagation loss prediction in two main aspects. [...] One is to create a higher resolution and more accurate digital terrain data base based on the CRC data base. The developed procedure is as follows. For a given area of interest first the complete quadratic two-dimensional interpolation for elevations and the weighted vote method for surface codes are applied to augment the CRC data base from 500 meters spacing to 100 meters spacing. If the contour from the augmented data base is not checked with the topographic map, then the data of missed critical terrain features are taken directly from the topographic map and are used to correct the augmented data base. In this step, the triangular interpolation scheme is introduced to modify the elevations, and the weighted vote method is used to modify the surface codes. There are eight surface codes which indicate tree, bare ground, fresh water, suburban, marsh, seawater, urban core and unknown type. As the result of the modified data base, the evaluations of diffraction, reflection, <b>tropospheric</b> <b>scattering,</b> urban, and season losses are more accurate. Thus, the total propagation loss prediction is greatly improved. [...] As another major work in this thesis, the modified diffraction loss prediction model is proposed. It involves: (a) for the implementation of the de Assis method, the radius of curvature of rounded obstacles' crest is determined by least-squares parabolic fitting; (b) the Deygout correction factor is first applied to deal with multiple rounded obstacles which are close to each other; (c) based on the availability of much more detailed information from the modified data base, all the defineable obstacles in a path profile are taken into account in the diffration loss prediction. [...] It is shown that our propagation loss prediction results are close to CRC results when the terrain is smooth; but in the irregular terrain, our results provide a substantial improvement...|$|E
