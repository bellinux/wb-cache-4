40|$|The {{daily work}} of an internist varies: Diseases take dif-ferent forms, and every patient is a {{distinct}} individual. The work of the medical journal editor—at least <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> it full time—is much more stereotyped.

30|$|There {{are many}} routes to {{discovering}} interesting and important questions in basic vision science. <b>Those</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> basic research in vision and attention typically expect the next important question {{to emerge from}} our thoughts about the last important results, building a cumulative edifice of science. The examples briefly discussed here illustrate another path; not better or worse, just different. This is the path of “use-inspired, basic research” where changes in the world outside of the science raise a set of worthwhile questions {{that might not have}} otherwise occurred to us. Often this is because the outside world delivers new stimuli for our consideration. Thus, the effect of prevalence in search becomes an interesting basic research question because modern society has invented low prevalence screening tasks that are important to our health and security. Studying the basic science of prevalence effects ultimately gives us fundamental facts about search behavior in general, as well as a way to help identify and, perhaps, ameliorate a source of errors in these socially important, real-world tasks.|$|E

40|$|English {{dominates the}} {{academic}} publishing world, and this dominance can, and often does, {{lead to the}} marginalisation of researchers who are not first-language speakers of English. There are different schools of thought regarding this linguistic domination; one approach is pragmatic. Proponents believe {{that the best way}} to empower these researchers in their bid to publish is to assist them to gain mastery of the variety of English most acceptable to prestigious journals. Another perspective, however, is that traditional academic English is not necessarily the best medium for the dissemination of research, and that linguistic compromises need to be made. They contend that the stranglehold that English holds in the publishing world should be resisted. This article explores these different perspectives, and suggests ways in which <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> not wield a great deal of influence may yet make a small contribution to the levelling of the linguistic playing field, and pave the way for an English lingua franca that better serves the needs of twenty-first century academics...|$|E
30|$|Further, {{most people}} who are being exposed to aspects of longstanding and complex contemplative traditions are not {{interested}} in and would not consider studying or practicing Asian religions in their ancient forms. But <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> such study (and possibly practice) face the question of how we should understand and address the high degree of appropriation, decontextualization, and commodification of most contemplative traditions today. An extended discussion of this topic {{is beyond the scope of}} this paper, but to mention some examples now under investigation: what, in the contemporary context, is “mindfulness,” “yoga,” or “Tantra,” and how do these relate to earlier historical manifestations? 36 Few practitioners today understand the originating traditions, have a holistic or prolonged practice, and submit to spiritual direction. Many in our therapeutically inclined culture are far more interested in the development, not cessation, of the ego self. While such studies are unlikely to be read by non-academics, Religious Studies scholars are uniquely positioned to note and describe an array of issues here. 37 Some scholars are in fact making attempts to address these issues in popular journals such as Tricycle: The Buddhist Review.|$|E
40|$|This book {{is about}} heroin addicts. The lives of these {{individuals}} are in most ways no {{different from those of}} their friends and neighbors who do not use heroin. Many heroin addicts work at legitimate jobs. They have families. They enjoy many of the same types of recreational activities as <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> not use her oin. Yet the world of heroin use is quite segregated from the day-to-day lives of most Americans. Consequently, numerous stereotypes of heroin addiction have been cultivated, many of which bear little resemblance to the experience of most addicts. In this book, I seek to portray heroin use and addiction from the perspective of those who participate in the heroin-using subculture. Heroin is part of a rather large family of drugs known as opiates or, more commonly, narcotics. Natural opiates are those drugs that derive from the poppy plant, and they include opium, morphine, and codeine. Synthetic opiates are pharmacologically similar to natural opiates but are artificially manufactured in a laboratory. The most common of these are Demerol, Darvon, and Methadone. Heroin is a partially synthetic drug, the product of treating morphine with acetic anhydride. Heroin was originally introduced into medicine as a cough suppressant by the Bayer Company in 1898. It was banned from medical use in 1924, although virtually all of the other opiates have legal medical uses in the United States today...|$|E

40|$|This study {{sought to}} examine the content of Australian-based tourism and {{hospitality}} Web sites reflecting the predominant features that organizations believe are essential on sites. The research {{was based on a}} previous study that examined hotel Web sites in North America. Using the Inference Find search engine, 20 sites in six tourism and hospitality sectors were chosen as the sample base. A checklist was devised to isolate features within each of the chosen sites. Totals for elements appearing on sites within each industry sector were calculated. Each sector was then analyzed to find differences and similarities of items included in these sites. Few sites included audio and video on their pages, a growing trend that suggests Web designers are more mindful of <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> not yet have state-of-the-art computers! On average, 48 % of sites provided maps of locations, and 80 % of all sites had updated their sites within the last 3 months, with travel agents and tour organizers updating more regularly. While more and more customers are turning to e-commerce, only 34 % of sites offered their visitors provision for purchase on-line. E-mail addresses were the second most common feature found in the surveyed sites. The Accommodation sector appeared to be less keen than other sectors to tell its visitors about other accommodation or tourism sites. Functional groups within the surveyed sample varied considerably. The management functionality of the sites was extremely low across all sectors while the use of sites for promotion and advertising was consistently high...|$|E
40|$|For a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) {{increasingly}} {{mired in}} controversies over {{the politicization of}} scientific and regulatory decisions, the agency's April 20, 2006 statement regarding medical use of marijuana may represent an all-time low point. [1] Politics, it appears, has now completely trumped science at this once proudly independent agency. The FDA has announced that "no sound scientific studies " support the medical use of marijuana, contradicting an increasingly large body of scientific literature. To <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> research in this area, this is a personal affront. Even the federal Drug Enforcement Agency's (DEA) own Administrative Law Judge, the Honorable Francis Young, stated in 1988, "Marijuana is the safest therapeutically active substance known to man [...] . " He went on to say, "The evidence clearly shows that marijuana is capable of relieving the distress of great numbers of very ill people, and doing so with safety under medical supervision [...] . it would be unreasonable, arbitrary and capricious for the DEA to continue to stand between those sufferers {{and the benefits of}} this substance. "[2] Perhaps more remarkable were the conclusions of President Nixon's Shafer Commission, who were appointed to investigate marijuana's available scientific and medical evidence. To the shock and dismay of President Nixon, the Commission found enough evidence to recommend that marijuana be decriminalized. [3] The FDA's announcement is puzzling at many levels. It makes no mention of any recent FDA analysis or investigation, regulatory filing, or any other activity within the normal scope of the agency's work that led to this policy change. Thus, there is no indication as to why the agency chose to issue this opinion at this particular moment. Rather than being base...|$|E
40|$|In {{line with}} the journal policy, the present issue of ALA, the last this year, also {{includes}} also a paper in Slovene. While striving for an active, open and engaged dialogue with the scientific trends in the research of Asian languages around the world, ALA, as the sole scientific journal devoted to Asian linguistics in Slovenia, also has set before itself the goal to cultivate critical scientific thought and terminology in this field among Slovenian speakers by providing {{in one of the}} issues every year also research and technical articles in Slovenian, for the Slovenian reading public, above all for undergraduate students and the interested public at large. This has been a tradition and, I would say, also a duty, respected and eagerly put in practice by <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> science, including linguistics, {{in the context of a}} relatively small language community, that of Slovenian speakers. The present issue begins with two papers concerned with the perception of phonological and phonetic differences between languages. The first paper, by Ashima AGGARWAL, deals with the acquisition of Hindi voicing and aspiration contrasts by monolingual English speakers in the framework of Optimality theory. The main result, that English learners do perceive aspiration distinction but not voicing contrast, also bears on adult learning of second languages in general. In the second paper, Nina GOLOB examines differences in Japanese and Slovene prosody i. e., accent and intonation, from a phonological point of view. The study shows that there are phonological differences behind some superficial phonetic similarities in the examined phenomena, which represent a difficulty in the acquisition of L 2 prosody. In the next paper, Abolfazl MOSAFFA JAHROMI examines the syntactic behaviour of in, an expletive-like morpheme in Persian, and argues in favour of the existence of expletives in Persian, a language which has hitherto generally been considered to have no expletives. The fourth and fifth paper deal with categorisations. The fourth paper deals with typological categorisation based on event framing strategies in Old Chinese and Old Japanese. On the basis of an analysis of available data, Wenchao LI concludes that while Old Chinese employed verb framing, satellite framing and equipollent framing, verb framing was its main pattern, while in Old Japanese all three patterns were employed comparably. The fifth paper, by Sumi YOON, deals with discourse categorisation of Japanese and Korean, both generally considered as “listener-responsible” languages. By analysing apologies in conversations by Japanese and Korean students, both those in their home country and those studying in the US, the author argues for a recategorization of Korean as a “speaker-responsible language”. In the technical article, in Slovene, at the end of this issue, Andrej BEKEŠ investigates the classification of genres in Japanese corpora, based on recent research he has also been involved in. He argues that various modal expressions, such as suppositional adverbs, may provide an interesting base for such classification. </p...|$|E
