5|$|According to medieval scholar Richard Zeikowitz, <b>the</b> <b>Green</b> Knight {{represents}} {{a threat to}} homosocial friendship in his medieval world. Zeikowitz argues that the narrator of the poem seems entranced by the Knight's beauty, homoeroticising him in poetic form. <b>The</b> <b>Green</b> Knight's attractiveness challenges the homosocial rules of King Arthur's court and {{poses a threat to}} their way of life. Zeikowitz also states that Gawain seems to find Bertilak as attractive as the narrator finds <b>the</b> <b>Green</b> Knight. Bertilak, however, follows the homosocial code and develops a friendship with Gawain. Gawain's embracing and kissing Bertilak in several scenes thus represents not a homosexual but a homosocial expression. Men of the time often embraced and kissed and this was acceptable under the chivalric code. Nonetheless, <b>the</b> <b>Green</b> Knight blurs the lines between homosociality and homosexuality, representing the difficulty medieval writers sometimes had in separating the two.|$|E

5|$|After {{the branch}} north of Fort Totten opened, <b>the</b> <b>Green</b> Line Commuter Shortcut {{began as a}} six-month {{experiment}} on January 27, 1997, allowing passengers {{to get on a}} train on <b>the</b> <b>Green</b> Line segment during rush hours and travel as far as Farragut North on the Red Line without having to switch trains at Fort Totten; a transfer was needed during off-peak hours. This was accomplished by utilizing a single-track spur (B & E connection) between <b>the</b> <b>Green</b> and Red Lines near (and bypassing) Fort Totten station. This shortcut was so well-received that it was continued until September 17, 1999, when the mid-city portion of <b>the</b> <b>Green</b> Line was completed.|$|E

50|$|Primary votes saw the Liberals and Labor both win {{two seats}} and <b>the</b> <b>Greens</b> win one, which left Labor ahead of <b>the</b> <b>Greens</b> and <b>the</b> Liberals.

Preferences from the What Women Want (Australia) Party and the Climate Change Coalition allowed <b>the</b> <b>Greens</b> to go ahead of all parties. This was followed by preferences from the Democratic Labor Party and Family First going to the Liberals, which allowed the Coalition to go ahead of <b>the</b> <b>Greens.</b> However, <b>the</b> <b>Greens</b> managed to crucially stay ahead of Labor, which led to preferences from Labor going to <b>the</b> <b>Greens.</b> This was enough for Greens candidate Sarah Hanson-Young winning the remaining seat.

5|$|Originally, {{the grass}} on <b>the</b> putting <b>greens</b> was <b>the</b> wide-bladed Bermuda. <b>The</b> <b>greens</b> lost speed, {{especially}} during the late 1970s, after {{the introduction of a}} healthier strain of narrow-bladed Bermuda, which thrived and grew thicker. In 1978, <b>the</b> <b>greens</b> on <b>the</b> par 3 course were reconstructed with bentgrass, a narrow-bladed species that could be mowed shorter, eliminating grain. After this test run, <b>the</b> <b>greens</b> on <b>the</b> main course were replaced with bentgrass in time for the 1981 Masters.
