Co-expression of these genes in the Nicotiana benthamiana transient leaf expression system resulted in TAG levels exceeding those expected from an additive effect and biochemical tracer studies confirmed increased flux of carbon through fatty acid and TAG synthesis pathways.

40|$|Lesquerella is a {{potential}} industrial oilseed crop that makes hydroxy fatty acid (HFA). Unlike castor its seeds are not poisonous but accumulate lesquerolic acid mostly at the sn- 1 and sn- 3 positions of triacylglycerol (TAG), whereas castor contains ricinoleic acid (18 : 1 OH) at all three positions. To investigate whether lesquerella can be engineered to accumulate HFAs in the sn- 2 position, multiple transgenic lines were made that express castor lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase 2 (RcLPAT 2) in the seed. RcLPAT 2 increased 18 : 1 OH at the sn- 2 position of TAGs from 2 % to 14 %– 17 %, which resulted in an increase of tri-HFA-TAGs from 5 % to 13 %– 14 %.

Here, a putative lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase gene, designated PrLPAAT 4, was isolated from seed unsaturated fatty acid (UFA) -rich P. rockii. The complete PrLPAAT 4 cDNA contained a 1116 -bp open reading frame (ORF), encoding a 42. 9 kDa protein with 371 amino acid residues. Bioinformatic analysis indicates that PrLPAAT 4 is a plasma membrane protein belonging to acyl-CoA: 1 -acylglycerol-sn- 3 -phosphate acyltranferases (AGPAT) family. PrLPAAT 4 shared high sequence similarity with its homologs from Citrus clementina, Populus trichocarpa, Manihot esculenta, and Ricinus communis.

The sequences for EST assembly are the transcribed mRNA {{of a cell}} and represent only {{a subset of the}} whole genome. At a first glance, underlying algorithmical problems differ between genome and EST assembly. For instance, genomes often have large amounts of repetitive sequences, mainly in the inter-genic parts. Since ESTs represent gene transcripts, they will not contain these repeats. On the other hand, cells tend to have a certain number of genes that are constantly expressed in very high numbers (housekeeping genes), which again leads to the problem of similar sequences present in high numbers in the data set to be assembled.|$|R

Affinity Grids employ a lipid monolayer containing functionalized nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) lipids to purify polyhistidine-tagged complexes. The method was applied and adapted to virus-like particles, specifically T 7 phage. A histidine tag was introduced at the C-terminus of the T 7 phage capsid protein gene product (gp) 10, which yielded a phage particle with 415 {{copies of the}} histidine <b>tag</b> after <b>assembly.</b> The Affinity Grid was used to isolate T 7 phage from Escherichia coli (E. coli) cell extracts.

Our approach employs the tag’s antenna as a dual function element in which the antenna simultaneously harvests RF energy, communicates with the RFID reader, and harvests solar energy for auxiliary power. This is accomplished by using low cost, printable photovoltaics deposited on flexible substrate to form part of the antenna’s radiating structure. Several prototype UHF RFID antennas are demonstrated using commercially available thin film, amorphous solar cells. To quantify the improvement in tag performance, Intel’s WISP was used as an initial test vehicle.

We recently reported the cloning and temporal-spatial expression of a peanut (Arachis hypogaea) AhLPAT 2 gene, showing that an increase in AhLPAT 2 transcript levels was closely correlated {{with an increase in}} seed oil levels. However, the function of the enzyme encoded by the AhLPAT 2 gene remains unclear. Here, we report that AhLPAT 2 transcript levels were consistently higher in the seeds of a high-oil cultivar than in those of a low-oil cultivar across different seed developmental stages. Seed-specific overexpression of AhLPAT 2 in Arabidopsis results in a higher percentage of oil in the seeds and greater-than-average seed weight in the transgenic plants compared with the wild-type plants, leading to a significant increase in total oil yield per plant. The total fatty acid (FA) content and the proportion of unsaturated FAs also increased. In the developing siliques of AhLPAT 2 -overexpressing plants, the expression levels of genes encoding crucial enzymes involved in de novo FA synthesis, acetyl-CoA subunit (AtBCCP 2) and acyl carrier protein 1 (AtACP 1) were elevated.

40|$|The {{amount of}} oil in seeds of {{different}} species varies from 1 % {{to as much as}} 60 % of seed dry weight. The oilseed storage reserve provides the necessary energy for the germination and establishment of the subsequent seedling. In sunflower, triacylglycerols (TAGs) represent the main component of seed oil. Sunflower storage lipid synthesis occurs in developing seeds over a period of about two weeks. The biosynthesis of triacylglycerols (TAGs) is a complex process consisting of three well-differentiated phases: (1) de novo synthesis of fatty acids in the plastid, (2) formation of the acyl-CoA pool in the cytosol, and (3) TAG assembling in the endoplasmic reticulum of developing seed tissues. Synthesized TAGs are then stored into densely packed oil bodies (oleosomes) until their utilization. <b>TAG</b> <b>assembly</b> in the ER is closely associated with membrane metabolism and involves the action of several membrane-bound acyltransferase enzymes. Until recently TAG biosynthesis was viewed as a sequential linear process where acyl-CoAs were sequentially assembled onto the sn- 1, sn- 2, and sn- 3 positions of the glycerol backbone, through the so-called Kennedy or glycerol phosphate pathway. However, in the last decade, new activities involved in alternative pathways also operating in the TAG biosynthesis have been discovered and characterized. Therefore, multiple interconnected pathways for TAG synthesis have actually been elucidated in plants. Overall, the sunflower TAG synthesis model highlights a complex network of enzymatic reactions mediating the movement of acyl groups between PC, acyl-CoA, DAG, PA, and TAG and contributes to the final stereospecific composition of storage TAG.

Gene cluster analyses and functional assignments of differentially expressed genes indicated a significant transcriptional complexity. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) was performed on selected genes with different expression levels and functional assignments {{to demonstrate the utility}} of RNA-Seq for gene expression profiles during the cotton defence response. Detailed elucidation of responses of leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases (LRR-RLKs), phytohormone signalling-related genes, and transcription factors described the interplay of signals that allowed the plant to fine-tune defence responses. On the basis of global gene regulation of phenylpropanoid metabolism-related genes, phenylpropanoid metabolism was deduced {{to be involved in the}} cotton defence response. A closer look at the expression of these genes, enzyme activity, and lignin levels revealed differences between resistant and susceptible cotton plants. Both types of plants showed an increased level of expression of lignin synthesis-related genes and increased phenylalanine-ammonia lyase (PAL) and peroxidase (POD) enzyme activity after inoculation with V. dahliae, but the increase was greater and faster in the resistant line. Histochemical analysis of lignin revealed that the resistant cotton not only retains its vascular structure, but also accumulates high levels of lignin.

Recently, a high-resolution X-ray {{structure of the}} mature PSII complex has become available. Two PSII polypeptides, D 1 and CP 43, provide many of the ligands to an inorganic Mn 4 Ca center that is essential for water oxidation. Because of its unusual redox chemistry, PSII often undergoes degradation followed by stepwise assembly. Psb 27, a small luminal polypeptide, functions as an important accessory factor in this elaborate assembly pathway. However, the structural location of Psb 27 within PSII assembly intermediates has remained elusive. Here we report that Psb 27 binds to CP 43 in such assembly intermediates. We treated purified genetically <b>tagged</b> PSII <b>assembly</b> intermediate complexes from the cyanobacterium Synechocystis 6803 with chemical cross-linkers to examine intermolecular interactions between Psb 27 and various PSII proteins. First, the water-soluble 1 -ethyl- 3 -(3 -dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC) was used to cross-link proteins with complementary charged groups in close association to one another. In the His 27 △ctpAPSII preparation, a 58 -kDa cross-linked species containing Psb 27 and CP 43 was identified. This species was not formed in the HT 3 △ctpA△psb 27 PSII complex in which Psb 27 was absent. Second, the homobifunctional thiol-cleavable cross-linker 3, 3 ′-dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidylpropionate) (DTSSP) was used to reversibly cross-link Psb 27 to CP 43 in His 27 △ctpAPSII preparations, which allowed the use of liquid chromatography/tandem MS to map the cross-linking sites as Psb 27 K 63 ↔CP 43 D 321 (trypsin) and CP 43 K 215 ↔Psb 27 D 58 AGGLK 63 ↔CP 43 D 321 (chymotrypsin), respectively.

Fatty acids esterified in the position sn- 2 of PC can suffer different modifications like desaturation, hydroxylation or epoxidation. In this regard, phosphatidylcholine:diacylglycerol cholinephosphotransferase (PDCT) catalyzes the reversible transfer of the phosphocholine headgroup from PC to diacylglycerol (DAG). Thus, through PDCT reactions, the acyl groups on DAG enter on PC and then return to DAG after their modifications on PC. Because <b>TAG</b> can be <b>assembly</b> with PC-derived DAG, PDCT could play an important role in the synthesis of TAG with modified fatty acids in its sn- 2 position.

Sequence diversity profiles were evaluated within C. arabica (Ca) and C. canephora (Cc) and used to deduce the transcript contribution of the Coffea eugenioides (Ce) ancestor. The assignment of the C. arabica haplotypes to the C. canephora (CaCc) or C. eugenioides (CaCe) ancestral genomes allowed us to analyze gene expression contributions of each subgenome in C. arabica. In silico data were validated by the quantitative polymerase chain reaction and allele-specific combination TaqMAMA-based method. The presence of differential expression of C. arabica homeologous genes and its implications in coffee gene expression, ontology, and physiology are discussed. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E
40|$|Perilla frutescen {{is used as}} {{traditional}} food and medicine in East Asia. Its seeds contain high levels of α-linolenic acid (ALA), which is important for health, but is scarce in our daily meals. Previous reports on RNA-seq of perilla seed had identified fatty acid (FA) and triacylglycerol (TAG) synthesis genes, but the underlying mechanism of ALA biosynthesis and its regulation {{still need to be}} further explored. So we conducted Illumina RNA-sequencing in seven temporal developmental stages of perilla seeds. Sequencing generated a total of 127 million clean reads, containing 15. 88 Gb of valid data. The de novo assembly of sequence reads yielded 64, 156 unigenes with an average length of 777 bp. A total of 39, 760 unigenes were annotated and 11, 693 unigenes were found to be differentially expressed in all samples. According to Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis, 486 unigenes were annotated in the “lipid metabolism” pathway. Of these, 150 unigenes were found to be involved in fatty acid (FA) biosynthesis and triacylglycerol (<b>TAG)</b> <b>assembly</b> in perilla seeds. A coexpression analysis showed that a total of 104 genes were highly coexpressed (r > 0. 95). The coexpression network could be divided into two main subnetworks showing over expression in the medium or earlier and late phases, respectively. In order to identify the putative regulatory genes, a transcription factor (TF) analysis was performed. This led to the identification of 45 gene families, mainly including the AP 2 -EREBP, bHLH, MYB, and NAC families, etc. After coexpression analysis of TFs with highly expression of FAD 2 and FAD 3 genes, 162 TFs were found to be significantly associated with two FAD genes (r > 0. 95). Those TFs were predicted to be the key regulatory factors in ALA biosynthesis in perilla seed. The qRT-PCR analysis also verified the relevance of expression pattern between two FAD genes and partial candidate TFs. Although {{it has been reported that}} some TFs are involved in seed development, more direct evidence is still needed to verify their function. However, these findings can provide clues to reveal the possible molecular mechanisms of ALA biosynthesis and its regulation in perilla seed...|$|E
40|$|Detection of trace {{amounts of}} {{explosive}} materials is significantly important for security concerns and pollution control. Four multicomponent metal organic frameworks (MOFs- 12, 13, 23, and 123) have been synthesized by employing ligands embedded with fluorescent <b>tags.</b> The multicomponent <b>assembly</b> of the ligands was utilized {{to acquire a}} diverse electronic behavior of the MOFs and the fluorescent tags were strategically chosen to enhance the electron density in the MOFs. The phase purity of the MOFs was established by PXRD, NMR spectroscopy, and finally by singlecrystal XRD. Single-crystal structures of the MOFs- 12 and 13 showed the formation of three-dimensional porous networks with the aromatic tags projecting inwardly into the pores. These electron-rich MOFs were utilized for detection of ex- plosive nitroaromatic compounds (NACs) through fluorescence quenching with high selectivity and sensitivity. The rate of fluorescence quenching for all the MOFs follows the order of electron deficiency of the NACs. We also showed the detection of picric acid (PA) by luminescent MOFs is not always reliable and can be misleading. This attracts our attention to explore these MOFs for sensing picryl chloride (PC), which is as explosive as picric acid and used widely to prepare more stable explosives like 2, 4, 6 -trinitroaniline from PA. Moreover, the recyclability and sensitivity studies indicated that these MOFs can be reused several times with parts per billion (ppb) levels of sensitivity towards PC and 2, 4, 6 -trinitrotoluene (TNT) ...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} deliver {{low-cost}} viral capsomeres {{from a large}} amount of soluble viral VP 6 protein from human rotavirus, we developed and optimized a biotechnological platform in Escherichia coli. Specifically, three different expression protocols were compared, differing in their genetic constructs, ie, a simple native histidine-tagged VP 6 sequence, VP 6 fused to thioredoxin, and VP 6 obtained with the newly described small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) fusion system. Our results demonstrate that the histidine-tagged protein does not escape the accumulation in the inclusion bodies, and that SUMO is largely superior to the thioredoxin-fusion tag in enhancing the expression and solubility of VP 6 protein. Moreover, the VP 6 protein produced according to the SUMO fusion <b>tag</b> displays well-known <b>assembly</b> properties, as observed in both transmission electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy images, giving rise to either VP 6 trimers, 60 nm spherical virus-like particles, or nanotubes a few microns long. This different quaternary organization of VP 6 shows a higher level of immunogenicity for the elongated structures with respect to the spheres or the protein trimers. Therefore, the expression and purification strategy presented here - providing {{a large amount of}} the viral capsid protein in the native form with relatively simple, rapid, and economical procedures - opens a new route toward large-scale production of a more efficient antigenic compound {{to be used as a}} vaccination tool or as an adjuvant, and also represents a top-quality biomaterial to be further modified for biotechnological purposes...|$|R
40|$|My {{internship}} {{was in the}} IDC which {{consist of}} a machine shop {{and an array of}} design space. During my tour I worked {{on a wide variety of}} projects some of which included design, research, machining and fabrication. I gained further knowledge on some machines that I have had prior experience on such as the lathe and Hurco CNC machines. The first thing we did was complete our checkout in the machine shop which went pretty well, since I was already familiar with most of the machines. I also did a couple of practice parts on some of the machines, I made a name block on the CNC machine and I also used the vertical milling machine to complete this project. One of the other projects that I did was machine a hammer with my initials with the use of the lathe and CNC machine, this project took much longer since I had to set up a cylindrical piece on the CNC machine. The first project that I began work on was the Systems Engineering & Management Advancement Program (SEPMAP) Hexacopter project and helped them to assemble and modify one of their particle capture doors on their boxes. After a while we ended up helping them make a hinge and holes to reduce the weight of their design. We helped the NASA Extreme Environment Mission Operations (NEEMO) team a bit with some of their name <b>tags</b> and <b>assembly</b> of some of their underwater parts. One of the more challenging projects was a rail that came in with a rather weirdly drawn part. The biggest project that I worked on was the solar array project. Which consisted of a variety of machining and 3 D printing and it took me about 3 different times of re-designing to come up with a final prototype. Along with this project I also had to complete a project in which I had to modify a thermos. This was rather simple since I just had to draw up a part and print it out on the 3 D printer. I also learned how to use Pro E/Creo parametric to design a square block and print it on the 3 D Printer. All of these projects increased my experience on all of the machines and equipment that I used. I also got to tweak my design skills and better understand how to modify my designs and how to improve those specific designs...|$|R
