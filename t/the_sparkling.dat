5|$|The war {{of words}} would {{continue}} for another 130 years with endless commentary from doctors, poets, playwrights and authors all arguing for their favorite region and their polemics being reproduced in advertisements for Burgundy and Champagne. On a few occasions, the two regions were {{on the brink of}} civil war. A turning point occurred when several Champagne wine makers abandoned efforts to produce red wine in favor of focusing on harnessing the effervescent nature of sparkling Champagne. As the bubbles became more popular, doctors throughout France and Europe commented on the health benefits of <b>the</b> <b>sparkling</b> bubbles which were said to cure malaria. As more Champenois winemakers embarked on this new and completely different wine style, the rivalry with Burgundy mellowed and eventually waned.|$|E
5|$|Using {{his various}} natural {{abilities}} and occasionally items or power-ups, Kirby must overcome obstacles while heading towards a goal door {{at end of}} the level, where he must fight a boss to obtain one of <b>the</b> <b>Sparkling</b> Stars. Most bosses are fought by sucking up the projectiles they create and spitting them back at the boss, however, the boss of the third level briefly turns the game into a Shoot 'em up. The last level before the final boss consists of a boss rush, where the player must fight all of the game's bosses again going through a short area based on the boss's home level.|$|E

25|$|While the Champenois {{and their}} French clients {{preferred}} their Champagne to be pale and still, the British were developing {{a taste for}} the unique bubbly wine. <b>The</b> <b>sparkling</b> version of Champagne continued to grow in popularity, especially among the wealthy and royal. Following the death of Louis XIV of France in 1715, the court of Philippe II, Duke of Orléans made <b>the</b> <b>sparkling</b> version of Champagne a favorite among the French nobility. More Champenois wine makers attempted to make their wines sparkle deliberately, but didn't know enough about how to control the process or how to make wine bottles strong enough to withstand the pressure.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>sparkling</b> {{quality of}} these wines comes from its carbon dioxide content {{and may be}} the result of natural fermentation, either in a bottle, as with the {{traditional}} method, in a large tank designed to withstand the pressures involved (as in the Charmat process), or as a result of simple carbon dioxide injection in some cheaper sparkling wines.|$|E
25|$|Historically {{the various}} stages were {{performed}} manually {{but the whole}} process is now automated for most wines. In connection with the filling of the missing volume, {{it is common to}} add a certain amount of sugar dissolved in wine to give <b>the</b> <b>sparkling</b> wine a smoother taste. Sugar addition is called dosage and the added liquid liqueur d'expedition.|$|E
25|$|The {{amount of}} sugar (dosage) added {{after the second}} {{fermentation}} and aging varies and will dictate the sweetness level of <b>the</b> <b>sparkling</b> wine.

25|$|In 1872, <b>the</b> <b>sparkling</b> wine Cava {{was invented}} in the Penedès region and {{eventually}} became an internationally recognized wine style. When phylloxera hit the region {{towards the end of}} the 19th century, Catalonia's vineyards comprised over 80% red wine grapes. The growing Cava industry encouraged planting of more white wine grapes, in place of the diseased red rootstock, where they now make up nearly 70% of the region's vineyards.|$|E
25|$|Fermentation {{of sugar}} into alcohol during {{winemaking}} always means that {{carbon dioxide is}} released. Carbon dioxide has the property of being very soluble in water (the main constituent of wine), a property that is utilized in sparkling wines. Production always starts from a base wine (where the carbon dioxide from the first fermentation has been gasified). In i.a. Champagne production the base wine is usually a blend of wines from different grape varieties and different wineries, where the distribution gives the final wine its special character, called cuvée. In some commonly used methods the base wine undergoes a secondary fermentation, which encloses the resulting carbon dioxide under excess pressure and binds it to the liquid in <b>the</b> <b>sparkling</b> wine. In this way the carbon dioxide content is created which, after opening the bottle, produces the bubbles. The dead yeast cells form a precipitate called lees, that often helps with appealing aromas to <b>the</b> <b>sparkling</b> wine but looks unappetizing. The lees is therefore normally removed before the wine is distributed.|$|E
25|$|The first Austrian {{producer}} of sparkling wine was Robert Alwin Schlumberger, who presented his first sparkling wine in 1846 {{under the name}} Vöslauer weißer Schaumwein (White sparkling wine of Vöslau). It was produced from Blauer Portugieser grapes growing in vineyards in Bad Vöslau which Schlumberger bought in 1843, and <b>the</b> <b>sparkling</b> wine was an immediate success. Stuttgart-born Schlumberger {{had worked in the}} Champagne house Ruinart before he moved to Vienna in 1842.|$|E

25|$|In counter-illumination {{camouflage}} {{an animal}} produces light that causes it {{to blend in}} against a lit background. In water, light comes down from the surface, so when animals are seen from below, they appear darker than the background. Some species of cephalopod, such as the midwater squid and <b>the</b> <b>sparkling</b> enope squid, produce light in photophores on their undersides to match the background. Bioluminescence is common among marine animals, so counter-illumination camouflage may be a widespread mode of deception.|$|E

The area is also an important cork production region, with output aimed primarily at the region's Cava houses.|$|E
