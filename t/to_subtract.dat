5|$|Blaise Pascal {{invented the}} {{mechanical}} calculator in 1642; {{it was the}} first operational adding machine. It made use of a gravity-assisted carry mechanism. It was the only operational mechanical calculator in the 17thcentury and the earliest automatic, digital computer. Pascal's calculator was limited by its carry mechanism, which forced its wheels to only turn one way so it could add. <b>To</b> <b>subtract,</b> the operator had to use the Pascal's calculator's complement, which required as many steps as an addition. Giovanni Poleni followed Pascal, building the second functional mechanical calculator in 1709, a calculating clock made of wood that, once setup, could multiply two numbers automatically.|$|E

25|$|Performing {{subtraction}} {{is one of}} {{the simplest}} numerical tasks. Subtraction of very small numbers is accessible to young children. In primary education, students are taught <b>to</b> <b>subtract</b> numbers in the decimal system, starting with single digits and progressively tackling more difficult problems.|$|E

50|$|The early formulators of QED {{and other}} quantum field {{theories}} were, as a rule, dissatisfied with {{this state of}} affairs. It seemed illegitimate to do something tantamount <b>to</b> <b>subtracting</b> infinities from infinities to get finite answers.|$|R
25|$|The theorem {{can be used}} to {{establish}} a number of theoretical results. For example, having a regression with a constant and another regressor is equivalent <b>to</b> <b>subtracting</b> the means from the dependent variable and the regressor and then running the regression for the demeaned variables but without the constant term.|$|R
25|$|The all-zeros {{value and}} all-ones values are {{reserved}} for the network address and broadcast address respectively. In systems that can handle CIDR a count of two is therefore subtracted from the host availability, rather than the subnet availability, making all 2n subnets available and removing a need <b>to</b> <b>subtract</b> two subnets.|$|E
25|$|A {{tax credit}} {{is a tax}} {{incentive}} which allows certain taxpayers <b>to</b> <b>subtract</b> {{the amount of the}} credit they have accrued from the total they owe the state.

25|$|The {{raw data}} is normalized; the {{simplest}} normalization method is <b>to</b> <b>subtract</b> background intensity and scale {{so that the}} total intensities {{of the features of}} the two channels are equal, or to use the intensity of a reference gene to calculate the t-value for all of the intensities. More sophisticated methods include z-ratio, loess and lowess regression and RMA (robust multichip analysis) for Affymetrix chips (single-channel, silicon chip, in situ synthesised short oligonucleotides).|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} methods to {{accomplish}} subtraction. The method {{which is in}} the United States of America referred to as traditional mathematics taught elementary school students <b>to</b> <b>subtract</b> using methods suitable for hand calculation. The particular method used varies from country to country, and within a country, different methods are in fashion at different times. Reform mathematics is distinguished generally by the lack of preference for any specific technique, replaced by guiding 2nd-grade students to invent their own methods of computation, such as using properties of negative numbers in the case of TERC.|$|E
25|$|The {{additions}} method seem to {{be taught}} in two variations, which differ only in psychology. Continuing the example of , the first variation attempts <b>to</b> <b>subtract</b> 9 from 6, and then 9 from 16, borrowing a 10 by marking near the digit of the subtrahend in the next column. The second variation attempts to find a digit which, when added to 9, gives 6, and recognizing that is not possible, gives 16, and carrying the 10 of the 16 as a one marking near the same digit as in the first method. The markings are the same; {{it is just a}} matter of preference as to how one explains its appearance.|$|E
3000|$|Note {{that the}} {{linearity}} of DCT and the wavelet transforms guarantee that D(SI)(X,Y)[*]≥[*] 0. This is because rounding a DCT coefficient (to obtain X) corresponds to adding a certain pattern (that {{depends on the}} modified DCT mode) in the wavelet domain.

30|$|Therefore, we find {{evidence}} of a diverging negative trend for the eligible group. In order to correct it, the third panel runs a triple difference regression, which is simply equivalent <b>to</b> <b>subtracting</b> panel 2 from panel 1. The effect of the policy is now captured by the coefficient on the triple difference Period III[*]×[*]Eligible[*]×[*]Year 2012. The point estimates for employment are now quite stable over time and comparable with the conversion rate, although slightly larger.|$|R

However, since both processes perform their withdrawals, the total amount withdrawn will end up being more than the original balance.

500|$|To {{determine}} the deflection {{due to the}} mountain, {{it was necessary to}} account for the curvature of the Earth: an observer moving north or south will see the local zenith shift by the same angle as any change in latitude. After accounting for observational effects such as precession, aberration of light and [...] nutation, Maskelyne showed that the difference between the locally determined zenith for observers north and south of Schiehallion was 54.6arc seconds. Once the surveying team had provided a difference of 42.94″ latitude between the two stations, he was able <b>to</b> <b>subtract</b> this, and after rounding to the accuracy of his observations, announce that the sum of the north and south deflections was 11.6″.|$|E

500|$|Thompson and Doran {{discussed}} {{how much of}} the love stories to depict, as the male characters spend much of the novel away from the Dashwood sisters. The screenwriter had to carefully balance the amount of screentime she gave to the male leads, noting in her film production diary that such a decision would [...] "very much lie in the editing." [...] Thompson wrote [...] "hundreds of different versions" [...] of romantic storylines. She considered having Edward re-appear midway through the film before deciding that it would not work as [...] "there was nothing for him to do." [...] Thompson also opted to exclude the duel scene between Brandon and Willoughby, which is described in the novel, because it [...] "only seemed <b>to</b> <b>subtract</b> from the mystery." [...] She and Doran agonised about when and how to reveal Brandon's backstory, as they wanted to prevent viewers from becoming bored. Thompson described the process of reminding audiences of Edward and Brandon as [...] "keeping plates spinning".|$|E
