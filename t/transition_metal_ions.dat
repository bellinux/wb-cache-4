25|$|Thermographic {{phosphors}} {{consist of}} ceramic host materials doped with rare-earth or <b>transition</b> <b>metal</b> <b>ions,</b> which exhibit phosphorescence {{when they are}} illuminated with UV-light. The decay time and the spectra of this phosphorescence are temperature sensitive and offer two different methods to measure temperature. The decay time method consists on the fitting of the phosphorescence decay to an exponential function and is normally used in point measurements, {{although it has been}} demonstrated in surface measurements. The intensity ratio between two different spectral lines of the phosphorescence emission, tracked using spectral filters, is also temperature-dependent and can be employed for surface measurements.|$|E
25|$|Pyridine {{itself is}} a {{relatively}} weak ligand in forming complexes with <b>transition</b> <b>metal</b> <b>ions.</b> For example, it forms a 1:1 complexes with nickel(II), Ni2+, and copper(II), Cu2+, with logK1 values of around 1.9 and 2.6, respectively. The infrared spectra of pyridine complexes have been discussed in detail. Picolinic acid, which is a substituted derivative of pyridine, forms strong complexes due to the chelate effect; 2,2′-bipyridine and 1,10-phenanthroline, which can also be viewed as substituted derivatives of pyridine, also form strong complexes, such as in ferroin, {{which can be used}} as a redox indicator in the quantitative analysis of iron.|$|E
25|$|The {{range of}} {{thermodynamic}} stability of liquid ammonia solutions is very narrow, {{as the potential}} for oxidation to dinitrogen, E° (N2 + 6NH4+ + 6e− ⇌ 8NH3), is only +0.04nbsp&V. In practice, both oxidation to dinitrogen and reduction to dihydrogen are slow. This is particularly true of reducing solutions: the solutions of the alkali metals mentioned above are stable for several days, slowly decomposing to the metal amide and dihydrogen. Most studies involving liquid ammonia solutions are done in reducing conditions; although oxidation of liquid ammonia is usually slow, {{there is still a}} risk of explosion, particularly if <b>transition</b> <b>metal</b> <b>ions</b> are present as possible catalysts.|$|E

The NMR shifts are interpreted in terms of the Fermi contact interaction and the dipolar term from the multipole expansion of the interaction of the electron orbital angular momentum and the electron spin dipolar-nuclear spin angular momentum. This analysis yields a direct measure of the effect of the solvent system on the environment of the <b>transition</b> <b>metal</b> <b>ion.</b> The results are analysed in terms of the crystal field environment of the <b>transition</b> <b>metal</b> <b>ion</b> with contributions from (a) the dithiocarbamate ligand (b) the solvent molecules and (c) the interaction of the effective dipole moment of the polar solvent molecule with the <b>transition</b> <b>metal</b> <b>ion</b> complex.

25|$|The {{antifouling}} {{characteristics of}} PEG are well documented, but the service life of PEG antifouling coatings is debated {{due to the}} hydrolysis of PEG chains in air, {{as well as by}} the low concentrations of <b>transition</b> <b>metal</b> <b>ions</b> present in seawater. Using DOPA residues as attachment points, new polymers similar in structure to the polypeptide backbone of proteins are being investigated, such as peptidomimetic polymer (PMP1). PMP1 uses a repeat unit of N-substituted glycine instead of ethylene glycol to impart antifouling properties. The N-substituted glycine is structurally similar to ethylene glycol and is hydrophilic, so easily dissolves in water. In controlled studies, PMP1-coated titanium surfaces were seen to be resistant to biofouling over a period of 180 days, even with continued addition and exposure to microfouling organisms.|$|E
25|$|Two {{important}} biological reaction {{mechanisms of}} nitric oxide are S-nitrosation of thiols, and nitrosylation of <b>transition</b> <b>metal</b> <b>ions.</b> S-nitrosation involves the (reversible) conversion of thiol groups, including cysteine residues in proteins, to form S-nitrosothiols (RSNOs). S-Nitrosation is {{a mechanism for}} dynamic, post-translational regulation of most or all major classes of protein. The second mechanism, nitrosylation, involves the binding of NO to a transition metal ion like iron or copper. In this function, NO {{is referred to as}} a nitrosyl ligand. Typical cases involve the nitrosylation of heme proteins like cytochromes, thereby disabling the normal enzymatic activity of the enzyme. Nitrosylated ferrous iron is particularly stable, as the binding of the nitrosyl ligand to ferrous iron (Fe(II)) is very strong. Hemoglobin is a prominent example of a heme protein that may be modified by NO by both pathways: NO may attach directly to the heme in the nitrosylation reaction, and independently form S-nitrosothiols by S-nitrosation of the thiol moieties.|$|E

40|$|The NMR and {{magnetic}} susceptibility {{results of a}} series of manganese (III) dithiocarbamates have been determined and interpreted using a model where the d 4 ion is in a crystal field of octahedral symmetry: the ground electronic state is the 5 E state. The true symmetry about the <b>metal</b> <b>ions</b> in dithiocarbamates differs somewhat from octahedral, and the implications of this are discussed. By comparing the NMR results for the iron (III) dithiocarbamate analogs we have shown that the extent of d-electron delocalization depends markedly on the <b>transition</b> <b>metal</b> <b>ion.</b> The variation of the isotropic proton hyperfine interaction constants along the alkyl chain, which reflects the electronic configuration of these complexes, also depends markedly on the <b>transition</b> <b>metal</b> <b>ion.</b> 鱹 70 American Institute of PhysicsNo Full Tex...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} an {{investigation}} into the effect of <b>transition</b> <b>metal</b> <b>ion</b> and selenate/fluorophosphate doping on the structures of Na 2 M(SO 4) 2 · 2 H 2 O (M=transition metal) materials is reported. In agreement with previous reports, the monoclinic (Kröhnkite) structure is adopted for M=Mn, Fe, Co, Cu, while for the smallest first row divalent <b>transition</b> <b>metal</b> <b>ion,</b> M=Ni, the triclinic (Fairfieldite structure) is adopted. On selenate doping there is a changeover in structure from monoclinic to triclinic for M=Fe, Co, Cu, with the larger Fe 2 + system requiring the highest level of selenate to complete the changeover. Thus the results suggest that the relative stability of the two structure types is influenced by the relative size of the transition metal: oxoanion group, with the triclinic structure favoured for small transition metals/large oxoanions. ...|$|R

40|$|H-N-H is a motif {{found in}} the {{nuclease}} domain of a subfamily of bacteria toxins, including colicin E 7, {{that are capable of}} cleaving DNA nonspecifically. This H-N-H motif has also been identified in a subfamily of homing endonucleases, which cleave DNA site specifically. To better understand the role of <b>metal</b> <b>ions</b> in the H-N-H motif during DNA hydrolysis, we crystallized the nuclease domain of colicin E 7 (nuclease-ColE 7) in complex with its inhibitor Im 7 in two different crystal forms, and we resolved the structures of EDTA-treated, Zn 2 +-bound and Mn 2 +-bound complexes in the presence of phosphate ions at resolutions of 2. 6 Å to 2. 0 Å. This study offers the first determination of the structure of a metal-free and substrate-free enzyme in the H-N-H family. The H-N-H motif contains two antiparallel β-strands linked to a C-terminal α-helix, with a divalent <b>metal</b> <b>ion</b> located in the center. Here we show that the metal-binding sites {{in the center of the}} H-N-H motif, for the EDTA-treated and Mg 2 +-soaked complex crystals, were occupied by water molecules, indicating that an alkaline earth <b>metal</b> <b>ion</b> does not reside in the same position as a <b>transition</b> <b>metal</b> <b>ion</b> in the H-N-H motif.
