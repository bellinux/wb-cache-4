5|$|As the goalkeeper has {{the choice}} of how many hands <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>use,</b> the {{decision}} should be made {{of what they want}} to do. A shot should be stopped with two hands either if it is weak or close to the goalkeeper's body, and normally stopped with one in other circumstances. This is because one-handed saves can go to the ball faster.|$|E
5|$|LocoRoco {{is divided}} into 5 worlds each {{consisting}} of 8 levels. In each level, {{the goal is to}} reach the end point of the level, with the player scored on the number of LocoRoco found, the time to complete the level, and other factors. There are six varieties of LocoRoco in the game, identified by their color, appearance, and musical voice, but outside of the first yellow one (Kulche), the rest are unlocked as the player completes the levels. The player can then opt which LocoRoco <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> for a level, however, this selection has no fundamental gameplay effects and only changes the songs used. LocoRoco act as blobs of gelatin, deforming from their normally round shape when demanded by the environment. Certain beings in the world can change the default shape of the LocoRoco into other forms, such as squares or triangles, which lasts until they wash off in water or they encounter another similar being.|$|E

25|$|In most of Canada, either partner may informally {{assume the}} spouse's surname after marriage, {{so long as}} it is not for the {{purposes}} of fraud. The same is true for people in common-law relationships, in some provinces. This is not considered a legal name change in most provinces, excluding British Columbia. For federal purposes, such as a Canadian passport, Canadians may also assume their partner's surname if they are in a common-law relationship. In the province of British Columbia, people have to undergo a legal name change if <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> a combined surname after marriage.

25|$|Battle Magnus {{make up the}} characters' decks. Outside of battle, {{the player}} assembles a deck of Magnus for each party member, from {{which he or she}} draws random hands during {{subsequent}} combats. Hand size, deck size and maximum combo size increase as the player upgrades the party members' class by finding character-specific Magnus and having them applied at the church. Weapon cards are used to fight with, Armor cards to block with, and Effect cards cause different effects, such as healing. Each Magnus has a Spirit Number in the corner ranging from 1-9. The Spirit Numbers are utilized during battle in order to create straights and same-number groupings (pairs, three-of-a-kinds, etc.), resulting in an increased damage effect. On cards with multiple spirit numbers, the player can select which number <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> by rolling the C-stick.|$|E

There are eight teams in Wipeout Fusion, each having a lead pilot and second pilot – players can choose which pilot and team <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> before a race.

The three devise plans to scam the cul-de-sac kids out of their money, which <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> to buy jawbreakers.

500|$|Players {{can choose}} to talk to monsters instead of {{fighting}} them, in order to attempt to recruit them to their party. They can choose which of their characters <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> to recruit monsters; the different characters vary in how easily they can recruit monsters. Players can also choose from their allied monsters when deciding which character they should use to recruit monsters. Players can use a type of magic called [...] "Combine" [...] to fuse two allied monsters into a single new monster; by doing this, players can get access to stronger monsters. In Last Bible II, players can increase {{the strength of their}} allied monsters by giving them accessories. In Last Bible III, players have access to a gauge that shows how the answers they give during conversations affect the monsters. The Demon Slayer includes an unlockable multiplayer mode in which two players can let their respective parties fight each other.|$|E

500|$|While {{investigating}} the VIN from an axle {{of the truck}} used in the explosion and {{the remnants of the}} license plate, federal agents were able to link the truck to a specific Ryder rental agency in Junction City, Kansas. Using a sketch created with the assistance of Eldon Elliot, owner of the agency, the agents were able to implicate McVeigh in the bombing. McVeigh was also identified by Lea McGown of the Dreamland Motel, who remembered him parking a large yellow Ryder truck in the lot; McVeigh had signed in under his real name at the motel, using an address that matched the one on his forged license and the charge sheet at the Perry Police Station. Before signing his real name at the motel, McVeigh had used false names for his transactions. However, McGown noted, [...] "People are so used to signing their own name that when they go to sign a phony name, they almost always go to write, and then look up for a moment as if to remember the new name <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>use.</b> That's what [...] did, and when he looked up I started talking to him, and it threw him." ...|$|E

2500|$|If an {{individual}} experiences impaired or damaged cognitive inhibition abilities, the psychological {{results can be}} extremely debilitating. Patients with obsessive compulsive disorder can experience the effects of reduced cognitive inhibition. [...] "Failures of inhibition were identified in treatment of adults with OCD. In Go/No-Go tasks, subjects {{have to make a}} simple motor response (such as pressing a button) as quickly as possible when target stimuli are presented, and withhold the motor response when non-target stimuli are presented. Bannon et al. (2002) found that OCD patients made signiﬁcantly more commission errors than matched panic disorder control subjects in a computerized task necessitating the inhibition of responses on a proportion of trials— OCD patients tended to make inappropriate motor responses to non-target stimuli". Evidently, the cognitive inhibition that OCD patients experience can have such effects as impairing response time to significant stimuli and decreasing the ability to shut out irrelevant stimuli. This may be why OCD responses to certain stimuli can be difficult to control. Suicidal behavior may also be related to cognitive inhibition impairment. In one meta-analysis involving 164 studies, it was discovered that executive dysfunction and higher cognitive inhibition deficit is positively correlated and more frequently found among patients with suicidal behaviors. In attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), studies of cognitive control have not emphasized the ability to actively suppress pre-potent mental representations. This indicates that people diagnosed with ADHD experience an impaired cognitive inhibition ability and find it difficult to suppress irrelevant stimuli. The result is decreased mental representation control and perhaps a degree of working memory deficit. Finally, there are age-related effects on {{an individual}}'s ability to execute cognitive inhibition, which mostly include language impairment. [...] "In language production, older adults' increased word-finding deficits have been explained under inhibitory deficit theory as a consequence of their reduced ability to inhibit irrelevant words (competitors) that impair retrieval of the target". When speaking, many older adults experience difficulty [...] "finding" [...] the words <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>use,</b> which is evidence of cognitive inhibition skills not functioning properly. Because they are not omitting synonyms or replacements entirely from their working memory (which can be considered irrelevant stimuli), they exhibit similar types of mental representation degradation that patients with depression, ADHD, or OCD indicate.|$|E
