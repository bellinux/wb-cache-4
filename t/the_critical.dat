40|$|Recent {{research}} {{in the domain of}} real-time scheduling theory has tackled the problem of scheduling mixed-criticality systems upon uniprocessor or multiprocessor platforms, with the main objective being to respect the timeliness of <b>the</b> most <b>critical</b> tasks, at <b>the</b> expense of the requirements of <b>the</b> less <b>critical</b> ones. In particular, <b>the</b> less <b>critical</b> tasks are carelessly discarded when the computation demand of (some of) <b>the</b> high <b>critical</b> tasks increases. This might nevertheless result in system failure, as these less critical tasks could be accessing data, the consistency of which should be preserved. In this paper, we address this problem and propose a method to cautiously handle task suspension. Furthermore, it is usually assumed that <b>the</b> less <b>critical</b> tasks will never be re-enabled once discarded. In this paper, we also address this concern by proposing an approach to re-enable <b>the</b> less <b>critical</b> tasks, without jeopardizing the timeliness of <b>the</b> high <b>critical</b> ones. <b>The</b> suggested approaches apply to systems having two or more criticality levels...|$|R
40|$|We {{argue that}} a quantum {{critical}} point associated with the putative metal–insulator transition phenomenon in 2 D controls not only <b>the</b> usual quantum <b>critical</b> sector but also a range of the low temperature insulator sector.

40|$|Abstract. The main {{objective}} {{of this article is}} to study the nature of <b>the</b> Andrews <b>critical</b> point in <b>the</b> gas-liquid transition in a physical-vapor trans-port (PVT) system. A dynamical model, consistent with the van der Waals equation near <b>the</b> Andrews <b>critical</b> point, is derived. With this model, we de-duce two physical parameters, which interact exactly at <b>the</b> Andrews <b>critical</b> point, and which dictate the dynamic transition behavior near <b>the</b> Andrews <b>critical</b> point. In particular, it is shown that 1) <b>the</b> Andrews <b>critical</b> point is a switching point where the phase transition changes from the first order to the third order, 2) the gas-liquid co-existence curve can be extended be-yond <b>the</b> Andrews <b>critical</b> point, and 3) the liquid-gas phase transition going beyond Andrews point is of the third order. This clearly explains why it is hard to observe the gas-liquid phase transition beyond <b>the</b> Andrews <b>critical</b> point. Furthermore, <b>the</b> analysis leads naturally the introduction of a general asymmetry principle of fluctuations and the preferred transition mechanism for a thermodynamic system. 1...|$|R

5|$|In {{the initial}} phase of decompression, <b>the</b> <b>critical</b> event {{is assumed to}} be the arrival of an {{arterial}} bubble in a de-saturating neurological tissue.
