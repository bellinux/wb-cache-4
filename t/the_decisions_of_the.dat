5|$|World War II {{broke out}} shortly after Minton joined the court, {{creating}} {{a flood of}} cases in which legal precedent provided little guidance, including challenges to wartime measures, selective service laws, price controls, rationing and civil liberties. In {{the majority of these}} cases, the court affirmed <b>the</b> <b>decisions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> district courts, but in several the court was required to establish a precedent. Minton stated on several occasions his personal preference to affirm <b>the</b> <b>decisions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lower courts. He believed that the court that heard the case and pronounced judgment was generally able to make a decision that was superior to appellate courts' decisions. He believed the appellate process should be reserved for the more serious cases and cases where the lower court had clearly made a mistake.|$|E
5|$|Castro was {{initially}} {{disappointed with the}} project as {{he did not want}} to solely imitate José's vocals, Ferrer's absence and his desire to record Jose's lesser known songs. According to Castro, it was <b>the</b> <b>decisions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> executive producers of his record label, Universal Music Latino, to only have Botija produce the album and to record José José's more recognized songs. He later retracted his statement, commending Botija and referred to the disc as his best, only lamenting he could not record José's lesser known songs. José expressed satisfaction with the result.|$|E

5|$|Cuthbert {{presided over}} the Council of Clovesho in 747 along with Æthelbald of Mercia. This {{gathering}} mandated that all clergy should explain the basic tenets of Christianity to the laity, as well as legislating on clerical dress, control of monasteries, and {{the behavior of the}} clergy. It also mandated that each diocese hold a synod to proclaim <b>the</b> <b>decisions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> council. Cuthbert sent his deacon Cynebert to Pope Gregory III after the council with a report on the council and its resolutions. This action may have been taken in response to Boniface's complaints about Cuthbert and Æthelbald to the papacy. The actions of the council were also gathered into a collection at Cuthbert's command.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the increasing international pressure, Goukouni stated that Libyan forces were in Chad by government request, and that international mediators should accept the decision of Chad's legitimate government. In a meeting held in May, Goukouni became more accommodating, declaring that while Libyan withdrawal was not a priority, he would accept <b>the</b> <b>decisions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> OAU. Goukouni could not at the time renounce Libyan military support, necessary for dealing with Habré's FAN, which was supported by Egypt and Sudan and funded through Egypt by the US Central Intelligence Agency.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Rowan, who espoused the Relief position, {{was elected}} to the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1822 {{representing}} Jefferson and Oldham counties. He immediately became the leader of the Relief faction in the House. When Relief partisans decided to appeal Williams and Lapsley to the Kentucky Court of Appeals, which was at the time the court of last resort in the state, Rowan was chosen to argue the appeal before the court alongside George M. Bibb and Lieutenant Governor William T. Barry. Their efforts failed, however, as the Court found the measure unconstitutional, upholding <b>the</b> <b>decisions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lower courts.|$|E

Rowan offered another amendment providing that ministers of the federal courts would be subject to state laws when carrying out <b>the</b> <b>decisions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> federal courts. After a month of debate, the entire bill was tabled.|$|E
5|$|The Metropolitan Council is the {{permanent}} executive {{body of the}} Church's administration.

The Council is headed by a chairman (the current Metropolitan), and is composed of the OCA's chancellor, secretary, treasurer, and selected clergy and lay delegates. It usually meets twice per year, but in December 2006 a rare joint meeting between the Metropolitan Council and the Holy Synod of Bishops was held.|$|E

5|$|Although {{only the}} United States Supreme Court can {{overturn}} <b>the</b> <b>decisions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Oregon Supreme Court, they cannot overturn decisions exclusively {{based on the}} Oregon law, though other mechanisms exist that effectively overturn decisions of the Oregon Supreme Court. The U.S. Supreme Court can only accept cases from the Oregon Supreme Court if the decision involves issues of federal law and interpretation of federal law might change {{the outcome of the}} case. The Oregon Supreme Court is the final authority on Oregon law, and absent extraordinary circumstances the U.S. Supreme Court cannot overrule its interpretation of Oregon law (see adequate and independent state ground). Although only the U.S. Supreme Court can reverse or overturn decisions of the Oregon Supreme Court, decisions of the court can be effectively overturned by changing the law. Thus later outcomes of the court can be affected by legislation passed by the Oregon Legislative Assembly or through the initiative and referendum process. Also, in most criminal decisions Oregon’s Governor or the President of the United States may issue a pardon (some crimes require the Oregon Legislature to concur).|$|E
5|$|In late May and June 1941, {{members of}} the Provincial Committee for Bosnia-Herzegovina {{travelled}} to the oblast (regional) centres of Banja Luka in the Bosanska Krajina region, Mostar in Herzegovina, and Tuzla in the Birač region of eastern Bosnia to advise the oblast KPJ committees of <b>the</b> <b>decisions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Central Committee, and to form oblast military committees. This also occurred in Sarajevo, for an oblast military committee responsible for the Romanija region of eastern Bosnia located north of that city. Each oblast military committee formed district military committees, who in turn contacted KPJ members in towns and villages of their district to organise resistance. This pyramid-like structure mirrored the KPJ structure, and following the German invasion of the Soviet Union on 22 June, the Central Committee met on 4 July and decided to initiate an armed uprising against the occupiers. This included {{the creation of a}} formal military structure, headed by the General Staff for the People's Liberation Partisan Detachments of Yugoslavia under the leadership of Josip Broz Tito, who was also the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the KPJ.|$|E
5|$|Oregon’s {{state courts}} are courts of general jurisdiction, unlike federal courts. That is, the state courts can hear all cases {{regardless}} of whether the dispute is based on state law, federal law, or a combination of both, with a few exceptions. Thus the Oregon Supreme Court can hear appeals for cases based on both federal and state law. Although the U.S. Supreme Court is the only court that can overturn decisions of the Oregon court, Oregon Supreme Court decisions as to federal law are only binding on other Oregon state level courts. Federal courts are not required to follow <b>the</b> <b>decisions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Oregon Supreme Court for decisions based on federal law, regardless as to if the federal court is located within the state. However, federal courts are bound to follow Oregon law and decisions of the Oregon Supreme Court for cases that involve disputes based on Oregon law, even when those federal courts are not based in Oregon, per the Erie Doctrine developed by the U.S. Supreme Court. For this reason federal courts, and courts from other states, can certify questions about Oregon law to the Oregon Supreme Court in order to clarify what the law in Oregon is in regards to the specific fact pattern that the federal court has before it in their case (see ORS 28.200 to 28.255 and ORAP 12.20).|$|E

5|$|The size {{of these}} castles varied {{depending}} on the geography of the site, <b>the</b> <b>decisions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> builder and the available resources. Analysis {{of the size of}} mottes has shown some distinctive regional variation; East Anglia, for example, saw much larger mottes being built than the Midlands or London. While motte-and-bailey and ringwork castles took great effort to build, they required relatively few skilled craftsmen allowing them to be raised using forced labour from the local estates; this, in addition to the speed with which they could be built – a single season, made them particularly attractive immediately after the conquest. The larger earthworks, particularly mottes, required an exponentially greater quantity of manpower than their smaller equivalents and consequently tended to be either royal, or belong to the most powerful barons who could muster the required construction effort. Despite motte-and-bailey and ringworks being common designs amongst Norman castles, each fortification was slightly different – some castles were designed with two baileys attached to a single motte, and some ringworks were built with additional towers added on; yet other castles were built as ringworks and later converted to motte-and-bailey structures.|$|E
5|$|Up {{until the}} 1890s, the {{government}} had no presence in the far north-west of Canada. In 1894, the rise of gold mining and a growing population led to calls for Ottawa to intervene, both to control whiskey trading {{and to protect the}} local First Nations. In response, the mounted police carried out a survey along the Yukon River and gathered customs duties. Fears grew that the United States might try to seize the mineral-rich region, and a twenty-man police team was established at Forty Mile in 1895. Although there was very little actual crime, frictions soon rose between the police and the Miners' Committees, which had been created to provide informal justice during the previous few years. The police brought the issue to a head in June 1896, sending a team into one of the mining camps to overturn <b>the</b> <b>decisions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> local committee.|$|E
