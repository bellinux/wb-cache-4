25|$|While most NBA teams hold {{contracts}} {{valued in}} excess of the salary cap, few teams have payrolls at luxury tax levels. The <b>tax</b> <b>threshold</b> in 2005–06 was $61.7million. In 2005–06, the New York Knicks' payroll was $124million, putting them $74.5million above the salary cap, and $62.3million above the tax line, which Knicks owner James Dolan paid to the league. Tax revenues are normally redistributed evenly among non-tax-paying teams, so there is often a several-million-dollar incentive to owners not to pay the luxury tax.|$|E

Under the 2011 CBA, teams that remain below the luxury <b>tax</b> <b>threshold</b> even after the trade can acquire the lesser of 150% plus $100,000, or 100% plus $5 million, of the salary they trade away. There is no lower limit—teams may divest themselves of as much salary as they wish (or can convince another team to take on) in a trade.|$|E

The aim of the tax reform has been to increase labour output to fend off a projected shortage within the next decades. The stated goal is to entice Danes to work more in order to compensate for the decreasing workforce, by lowering tax on wages and gradually lowering welfare payments to those outside of the labour market to increase the economic benefit of working relative to receiving welfare.|$|E

We compare three {{different}} {{views on the}} long run efficiencies of emission <b>taxes</b> which include <b>thresholds</b> (inframarginal exemptions), and of tradeable emission permits where some permits are initially free. The differences are caused by different assumptions about whether thresholds and free permits should be subsidies given only to firms that produce, or full property rights.

500|$|On October 4, the NBA {{canceled}} {{the remainder of}} the preseason. Stern said the league would lose $200 million by canceling the preseason, and warned that {{the first two weeks of}} the season would be in jeopardy if no deal is reached by October 10. The players proposed that they receive 53% of BRI, while the owners countered with 47%. The two sides then discussed a 50–50 split of BRI, with the owners offering the players 49% of BRI with incentives that would raise the value to 51%. The players countered by asking for 51%, which would increase to 53 percent using those same incentives. It was rejected by the owners. Attempts for the sides to meet on October 7 failed. The union said the NBA demanded a 50–50 revenue split prior to the meeting, while the league refuted making any such demands. After talks on October 9 and 10, the two sides were unable to reach a deal and Stern subsequently {{canceled the}} first two weeks of regular-season games, which were originally scheduled to begin on November 1. [...] BRI remained the main issue, but other differences included luxury tax, player contract length, and the mid-level exception. The owners proposed a $2 tax for every $1 that a team spends above the <b>tax</b> <b>threshold</b> for player salaries. The tax would rise to as high as $4 for every $1 above the limit for teams that are repeat offenders. The previous CBA in comparison called for a $1 tax for every $1 over the limit. The players refused to accept a hard salary cap, which they felt the more punitive luxury taxes would effectively create. Stern said the owners felt a harsher luxury tax would make the league more competitive. Wade countered that a small-market team like the San Antonio Spurs had won multiple championships. Andrew Zimbalist, an economist at Smith College, said that [...] "the statistical correlation between payroll and win percentage is practically nonexistent" [...] in the NBA. ESPN concluded that a team's draft efficiency accounted for 34% of its winning percentage in the past decade, while payroll showed only a 7% correlation. The New York Times noted that a fairer system was needed for the small-market teams, but the league's popularity historically relied on predictably successful teams with multiple superstars.|$|E

2500|$|The 2011 CBA instituted {{major changes}} to the luxury tax regime. The {{previous}} CBA had a dollar-for-dollar tax provision system, which remained in effect through the 2012–13 season. Teams exceeding the tax level were punished by being forced to pay one dollar to the league for each dollar by which their payroll exceeded the tax level. Starting in 2013–14, the tax changed to an incremental system. Under the current system, tax is assessed at different levels based on the amount that a team is over the luxury <b>tax</b> <b>threshold.</b> The scheme is not cumulative—each level of tax applies only to amounts over that level's threshold. For example, {{a team that is}} $8 million over the <b>tax</b> <b>threshold</b> will pay $1.50 for each of its first $5 million over the <b>tax</b> <b>threshold,</b> and $1.75 per dollar for the remaining $3 million. Starting in 2014–15, [...] "repeat offenders", subject to additional penalties, are defined as teams that paid tax in previous seasons. In the first season, repeat offenders from in all previous three seasons will pay a stiffer tax rate; from 2015–16 thereafter, teams paying taxes in three out of four years will be subject to the higher repeater rate. As in the previous CBA, the tax revenue is divided among teams with lower payrolls. However, under the new scheme, no more than 50% of the total tax revenue can go exclusively to teams that did not go over the cap. Initial reports did not specify the use of the remaining 50% under the 2011 CBA, but it was later confirmed that this amount would be used to fund revenue sharing for the season during which tax was paid.|$|E

50|$|Brown {{increased}} the <b>tax</b> <b>thresholds</b> {{in line with}} inflation, rather than earnings, which rise more quickly during periods of economic growth. This results in fiscal drag in which more taxpayers are drawn into the upper rates (e.g. in 2000-01 there were 2,880,000 higher-rate taxpayers, whereas in 2005-06 there were 3,160,000).|$|R

2500|$|In 2005, the NBA {{agreed on}} a new {{collective}} bargaining agreement (CBA). The most striking innovation granted NBA teams a one-time option to release a player without his contract counting against the luxury <b>tax</b> <b>threshold</b> regardless of how long or how rich the contract was. The provision did not negate the player's contract, a team's obligation to pay the player, or {{the impact on the}} salary cap; it merely removed the player's salary when computing the luxury tax. This rule benefited teams that were in danger of facing the [...] "luxury tax" [...] penalty, a [...] tax paid on salaries spent above a certain threshold of total team salary. [...] The correct term is [...] "amnesty clause," [...] but because the team with the worst problems was the Knicks, and their worst financial liability was Houston, it was quickly dubbed the [...] "Allan Houston Rule." [...] Ironically, the Knicks chose not to use the exception for Houston, but for forward Jerome Williams instead, since the Knicks correctly predicted Houston would retire due to lingering injuries over his last two seasons. As a result, Houston's contract counted a total of $40 million against the salary cap, but did not count towards the luxury tax due to his medical retirement, and insurance covered most of the team's payments to him.|$|E

40|$|We give {{empirical}} welfare {{results for}} global {{greenhouse gas emission}} control, using the first multiparty model to combine tax-versus-trading under uncertainties with revenue recycling. Including multiple parties greatly reduces the welfare advantage of an emissions tax over emissions (permit) trading in handling abatement-cost uncertainties, from that shown by existing, single-party literature.

Either mechanism's free emissions share, from <b>tax</b> <b>thresholds</b> or free permits, which lowers its possible welfare gain from revenue recycling, may however dominate any tax-versus-trading advantage.
