40|$|Multicasting is an {{efficient}} means {{of one to}} many communication and is typically implemented by creating a multicasting tree. Because of the severe battery power and transmission bandwidth limitations in ad hoc networks, multicast routing can significantly improve the performance {{of this type of}} network. However, due to the frequent and hard-to-predict topological changes of ad hoc networks, maintenance of a multicasting tree to ensure its availability could be a difficult task. We borrow from the concept of Alternate Path routing, which has been studied for providing QOS routing, effective congestion control, security, and route failure protection, to propose a scheme in which a set of multicasting trees is continuously maintained. In our scheme, a tree is used until it fails, at which time it is replaced by an alternative tree in the set, so that the time between failure of a tree and resumption of multicast routing is minimal. In this paper, we introduce the basic scheme, termed ITAMAR, which is a framework for efficient multicasting in ad hoc networks. We present a number of heuristics {{that could be used in}} ITAMAR to compute a set of alternate trees. The heuristics are then compared in terms of transmission cost, improvement in the average time between multicast failures and the probability of usefulness. Simulations show significant gains over a wide range of network operational conditions. In particular, we show that using alternate trees has the potential of improving mean time between interruption by 100 – 600 % in a 50 node network (for most multicast group sizes) with small increase in the tree cost and the route discovery overhead. We show that by renewing the backup tree set, probability of interruptions can be kept at a minimum at all times and that allowing some overlap among trees in the backup set increases the mean <b>time</b> <b>between</b> <b>interruptions...</b>|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{reasons that}} {{patients}} with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB) miss treatment are multi-factorial and complex. Identifying patterns of treatment interruption that predict poor outcomes {{can be used to}} target program activities aiming to improve treatment adherence. OBJECTIVE: To characterize patterns of treatment interruption among MDR TB patients and determine the association between patterns and treatment outcomes. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of MDR TB patients. A treatment interruption was defined as any time that a patient missed a prescribed dose of treatment for at least 1 day but for a period of less than 2 consecutive months. Patients were characterized by the number, length and variability of interruptions, variability of <b>time</b> <b>between</b> <b>interruptions,</b> and percent of missed doses. Final treatment outcome was dichotomized as a successful (cured or completed) or poor outcome (defaulted, failed, or died). Risk ratios were calculated to determine the association between characteristics of treatment interruption and treatment outcomes. All analyses were conducted in 6 month treatment intervals. RESULTS: Only 7. 0 % of 583 patients completed treatment without interruption. Of the remaining 542 patients, the median time to the first interruption was 2 ½ months (70 days). In multivariate analysis, patients who had longer interruptions with sporadic variability during the 6 - 12 month or the 12 - 18 month treatment period had a significantly increased risk for poor outcomes compared to patients who had short, regular interruptions (RR(adj) 4. 37, 95 % CI 1. 2 - 15. 8;  =  0. 03 and RR(adj) 3. 38, 95 % CI 1. 6 - 7. 1; p =  0. 001, respectively). In addition, missing 10 % or more of the prescribed doses during any 6 month period in the initial 18 months of therapy significantly increased the risk for poor outcomes (RR(adj) range 1. 55 - 2. 35; p-value range 0. 01 - 0. 005). CONCLUSION: Patients that miss more consecutive days of treatment with sporadic interruption patterns or a greater proportion of treatment are at an increased risk for poor treatment outcomes...|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} {{recently}} discovered that heavy-tailed completion times {{can result from}} protocol interaction even when file sizes are light-tailed. A key to this phenomenon {{is the use of}} a restart policy where if the file is interrupted before it is completed, it needs to restart from the beginning. In this paper, we show that fragmenting a file into pieces whose sizes are either bounded or independently chosen after each interruption guarantees light-tailed completion time as long as the file size is light-tailed; i. e., in this case, heavy-tailed completion time can only originate from heavy-tailed file sizes. If the file size is heavy-tailed, then the completion time is necessarily heavy-tailed. For this case, we show that when the file size distribution is regularly varying, then under independent or bounded fragmentation, the completion time tail distribution function is asymptotically bounded above by that of the original file size stretched by a constant factor. We then prove that if the distribution of <b>times</b> <b>between</b> <b>interruptions</b> has nondecreasing failure rate, the expected completion time is minimized by dividing the file into equal-sized fragments; this optimal fragment size is unique but depends on the file size. We also present a simple blind fragmentation policy where the fragment sizes are constant and independent of the file size and prove that it is asymptotically optimal. Both these policies are also shown to have desirable completion time tail behavior. Finally, we bound the error in expected completion time due to error in modeling of the failure process.   QC 20150420 </p...|$|R

40|$|SummaryBackground and objectivesSevoflurane is {{presented}} in three types of vials. The differences in physical-chemical properties of those products are due to different manufacturing processes, although they are essentially identical regarding chemical comparison tests. It has been hypothesized that the Sevoflurane molecule could present chemical instability due {{to the formation of}} Lewis acids {{as a consequence of the}} materials used in the fabrication of the vials and the water content. The objective of this study was to analyze the clinical efficacy of Sevoflurane conditioned in different vials. MethodsSixty-four adult patients were randomly divided into two groups. Two Datex-Ohmeda vaporizers, one with only Generic Sevoflurane and the other with Sevorane™, were used. The study coordinator was responsible for supplying the vaporizers and he did not participated in none anesthetic procedures. The same anesthetic technique and monitoring (ECG, HR, SpO 2, PETCO 2, BIS, SEF, TOF, % INSP, % EXP, SBP, and DBP) were used in both groups. ResultsDuring anesthesia, differences were not observed between both groups. A statistically significant difference was observed in the <b>time</b> <b>between</b> the <b>interruption</b> of Sevoflurane and spontaneous eye opening (13, 91 ± 6. 39 min in Group II, and 10. 34 ± 6. 05 min in Group I) and the interruption of Sevoflurane and handgrip on verbal command (15. 38 ± 6. 47 min in Group II, and 11. 88 ± 6. 60 in Group I).

40|$|Although {{antiviral}} agents which block {{human immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) replication can result in long-term suppression of viral loads to undetectable levels in plasma, long-term therapy fails to eradicate virus, which generally rebounds after a single treatment interruption. Multiple structured treatment interruptions (STIs) have been suggested as a possible strategy that may boost HIV-specific immune responses and control viral replication. We analyze viral dynamics during four consecutive STI cycles in 12 chronically infected patients with a history (> 2 years) of viral suppression under highly active antiretroviral therapy. We fitted a simple model of viral rebound to the viral load data from each patient by using a novel statistical approach {{that allows us to}} overcome problems of estimating viral dynamics parameters when there are many viral load measurements below the limit of detection. There is an approximate halving of the average viral growth rate between the first and fourth STI cycles, yet the average <b>time</b> <b>between</b> treatment <b>interruption</b> and detection of viral loads in the plasma is approximately the same in the first and fourth interruptions. We hypothesize that reseeding of viral reservoirs during treatment interruptions can account for this discrepancy, although factors such as stochastic effects and the strength of HIV-specific immune responses may also affect the time to viral rebound. We also demonstrate spontaneous drops in viral load in later STIs, which reflect fluctuations in the rates of viral production and/or clearance that may be caused by a complex interaction between virus and target cells and/or immune responses...|$|R

For example, if one group of participants was interrupted during Scan X at 40 s and the other group was not interrupted during Scan X, the refixation rate for Scan X would be calculated relative to the 40 -s time point for each group. The critical comparisons were between the refixation rates for the interruption trials and the control trials during the same time periods for a given scan. During the 30 s prior to the interruption time for each CT scan, {{there were no significant differences}} in refixation rate <b>between</b> <b>interruption</b> (M[*]=[*] 0.41, SD[*]=[*] 0.08) and control (M[*]=[*] 0.41, SD[*]=[*] 0.08) trials, t(24)[*]=[*] 0.52, p[*]=[*] 0.61.

Compared to doctors from other specialties, radiologists are disproportionately named as defendants in these claims (Physician Insurers Association of America, 2004; Whang et al., 2013).|$|R
40|$|In my thesis, I {{would like}} to prove that women are linguistically more polite than men. I will try to justify this claim by finding {{evidence}} in the usage of such discourse strategies as interruptions, overlaps and minimal responses. In {{order to have a}} clear-cut analysis of these linguistic devices, I will examine conversations not only in mixed-sex pairs or groups but also between the same sexes. Moreover, I will make a distinction <b>between</b> <b>interruptions</b> and overlaps and try to compare them with minimal responses which also occur during someone’s speaking turn. It will also turn out whether using minimal responses during others’ turn space or not intruding into the current speaker’s turn are viewed as clear signs of weakness or not. Additionally, we will see whether the timing of these strategies takes an important role in controlling a conversation. egyetemiangol nyelv és irodalo...|$|R
