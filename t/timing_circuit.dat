The water supply for the evaporator is contained in a rubber bladder supported by a ring in the canister immediately above the lower dome. When water temperature exceeds the nominal 60 °F, a ground command actuates a <b>timing</b> <b>circuit</b> operating a valve.

50|$|An older {{method of}} {{measuring}} {{the frequency of}} rotating or vibrating objects {{is to use a}} stroboscope. This is an intense repetitively flashing light (strobe light) whose frequency can be adjusted with a calibrated <b>timing</b> <b>circuit.</b> The strobe light is pointed at the rotating object and the frequency adjusted up and down. When the frequency of the strobe equals the frequency of the rotating or vibrating object, the object completes one cycle of oscillation and returns to its original position between the flashes of light, so when illuminated by the strobe the object appears stationary. Then the frequency can be read from the calibrated readout on the stroboscope. A downside of this method is that an object rotating at an integral multiple of the strobing frequency will also appear stationary.|$|E

A unique feature of the design was the [...] "demountable" [...] tubes, which could be opened for service, {{and had to be}} connected to a oil diffusion vacuum pump for continual evacuation while in use. The tubes were able to operate at one of four selected frequencies between 20 and 55 MHz, and switched from one to another in 15 seconds. To produce the short pulses of signal, the transmitter consisted of Hartley oscillators feeding a pair of tetrode amplifier tubes.

40|$|Abstract—Negative-bias {{temperature}} instability (NBTI) and positive-bias {{temperature instability}} (PBTI) weaken PFET and NFET over {{the lifetime of}} usage, leading to performance and reliability degradation of nanoscale CMOS SRAM. In addition, most of the state-of-the-art SRAM designs employ replica <b>timing</b> control <b>circuit</b> to mitigate the effects of leakage and process vari-ation, optimize the performance, and reduce power consumption. NBTI and PBTI also degrade the <b>timing</b> control <b>circuits</b> and may render them ineffective. In this paper, we provide comprehensive analyses on the impacts of NBTI and PBTI on a two-port 8 T SRAM design, including the stability and Write margin of the cell, Read/Write access paths, and replica <b>timing</b> control <b>circuits.</b> We show, for the first time, that because the Read/Write replica <b>timing</b> control <b>circuits</b> are activated in every Read/Write cycle, they exhibit distinctively different degradation behavior from the normal array access paths, resulting in degradation of timing control and performance.

50|$|Since a {{disk drive}} is a {{physical}} piece of hardware, the rotational speed of the drive can change slightly, due {{to a change in}} the motor speed or thermal expansion of the disk platter. The physical media on a floppy disk can also become deformed, causing larger timing errors, and the <b>timing</b> <b>circuit</b> on the controller itself may have small variations in speed. The problem is that, with a long string of zeros, there's no way for the disk drive's controller to know the exact position of the read head, and thus no way to know exactly how many zeros there are. A speed variation of even 0.1% - which is more precise than any practical floppy drive - could result in four bits being added to or removed from the 4,096 bit data stream. Without some form of synchronization and error correction, the data would become completely unusable.|$|E

The net cord ‘Let’ sensor was a simple piezoelectric device, initially a guitar pickup, to detect if the tennis ball touched the net during the service delivery.

50|$|In {{order to}} {{overcome}} the bottlenecks of the Critical path approach implementation of AVS system, the Razor approach is used. Unlike the critical path approach where a single path is identified as critical path, Razor approach has a set of potential critical paths {{that are to be}} monitored. In this approach an on-chip timing checker is employed to check the timing margin of the set of critical path. A delayed version of the system clock is used by the <b>timing</b> <b>circuit</b> to capture the data in shadow latch which is same as the data captured by the master(main) flipflop. Wherever the sub paths become critical, additional shadow latches are introduced. When the supply voltage is scaled the value latched in the main flipflop might be different from that of those latched by the shadow latches, which results in an error signals. The error signals from all the shadow latches are gathered to generate a single error indicator. This error is corrected by flushing the pipeline and reloading the state that was existing before the error occurred. When the error rates decrease beyond certain limits the supply voltage is reduced till the point where the error tends to become unacceptable.|$|E

50|$|Under the tablet's surface (or LCD in {{the case}} of the Cintiq) is a printed circuit board with a grid of {{multiple}} send/receive coils and a magnetic reflector attached behind the grid. In send mode, the tablet generates a close-coupled electromagnetic field (also known as a B-field) at a frequency of 531 kHz. This close-coupled field stimulates oscillation in the pen's coil/capacitor (LC) circuit when brought into range of the B-field. Any excess resonant electromagnetic energy is reflected back to the tablet. In receive mode, the energy of the resonant circuit’s oscillations in the pen is detected by the tablet's grid. This information is analyzed by the computer to determine the pen's position, by interpolation and Fourier analysis of the signal intensity. In addition, the pen communicates information such as pen tip pressure, side-switch status, tip vs. eraser orientation and ID number (to differentiate between different pens, mice, etc.). For example, applying more or less pressure to the tip of the pen changes the value of the pen's <b>timing</b> <b>circuit</b> capacitor. This signal change can be communicated in an analog or digital method. An analog implementation modulates the phase angle of the resonant frequency, while a digital method is communicated to a modulator that distributes the information digitally. The tablet forwards this and other relevant tool information in packets, up to 200 times per second, to the computer.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{describes}} a timing-skew calibration technique which equalizes the phase spacings among multiphase clocks. The scheme uses simple sample-and-hold circuits con-trolled by the multiphase clocks to sample a common reference input. Phase spacing {{is measured by}} {{counting the number of}} zero crossings between two adjacent sampling sequences. A zero-crossing detection scheme is proposed. It has better immu-nity against the offsets of the comparators used in the detector. A digital calibration processor is also proposed. It examines the outputs from the zero-crossing detectors, and then adjusts the delays of clock buffers in order to minimize timing skews. The proposed calibration scheme does not demand stringent require-ment for the reference input. Its application to a eight-channel 6 -b time-interleaved analog-to-digital converter is demonstrated.
