After being informed, George informs Jerry he has no problem with him dating Marlene. The following night, Jerry asks Marlene to come to his apartment, but she tells him that it might be better not to date him anymore. Jerry asks her why, to which she replies that she did not <b>think</b> <b>his</b> stand-up comedy act was funny, and that she could not date someone if she did not respect what they did.|$|E
5|$|When Dean {{returned}} to the United States, he received a hero's welcome and was presented {{with a number of}} decorations, including the Medal of Honor, which he was unaware he had been awarded. Dean maintained he did not <b>think</b> <b>his</b> own experience was particularly heroic and asserted he did not feel he deserved an award for his actions in Korea. He was given a ticker-tape parade in New York City on his return to the US on October 26, 1953, and he was made the Grand Marshal of the Tournament of Roses Parade on January 1, 1954.|$|E

25|$|It was Hofmann. It was, I <b>think,</b> <b>his</b> last {{performance}} in Toronto, {{and it was}} a staggering impression. The only thing I can really remember is that, when I was being brought home in a car, I was in that wonderful state of half-awakeness in which you hear all sorts of incredible sounds going through your mind. They were all orchestral sounds, but I was playing them all, and suddenly I was Hofmann. I was enchanted.|$|E
25|$|The {{fortunes}} {{of many of}} Seattle's leading families were founded on loans from Graham. When banker Jacob Furth was approached with a loan request for a business idea that he thought was good, but {{which he did not}} <b>think</b> <b>his</b> board of directors at Puget Sound National Bank would approve, he would send them on to Graham, who would make a loan at higher interest, but with less formality. Graham may have been instrumental in saving Furth's bank from a bank run during the Panic of 1893 by ostentatiously making a large deposit. After she died a Puget Sound National Bank employee became administrator of her estate.|$|E
25|$|Dublin was an {{important}} figure in Norwich securing safety from relegation to League One and the supporters recognised his contribution by voting him in {{second place in the}} Norwich City player of the year award, and on 23 May 2007 he ended speculation about his future by signing a new one-year contract at Norwich, keeping him at the club {{until the end of the}} 2007–08 season. On 2 September 2007, Dublin, whilst a pundit on the Aston Villa v Chelsea game, said that this season would be his last as a footballer, citing the fact that his 'bones have started to talk to him' as the reason, meaning that he did not <b>think</b> <b>his</b> body can handle another season.|$|E

25|$|An Anglican {{priest of}} Irish extraction, {{he was born}} on St Patrick's Day, 17 March 1777. He was a bright young man and after being taught by the Rev. Thomas Tighe, he won a {{scholarship}} to St John's College, Cambridge, where he studied divinity and ancient and modern history. Attending Cambridge may have made him <b>think</b> <b>his</b> name was too Irish, and he changed its spelling to Brontë, perhaps in honour of Horatio Nelson who held the title of Duke of Bronte, whom Patrick admired. However, a more likely reason may have been that his brother, William, was 'on the run' from the British for his involvement with the United Irishmen {{and he wanted to}} distance himself from the name Prunty. Having obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree, he was ordained on 10 August 1806. He is the author of Cottage Poems (1811), The Rural Minstrel (1814), numerous pamphlets and newspaper articles, and various rural poems.|$|E
25|$|In the Dunphy family, while Phil (Ty Burrell) is at work, {{his father}} Frank (Fred Willard) {{comes to his}} house to visit with his RV and a dog named Scout without telling Claire (Julie Bowen) that the dog is for them. Claire as {{expected}} is angry at this as she expects the family not {{to help with the}} dog and she will do all the work. While taking the trash out Claire overhears Frank crying in his RV. Claire tells Phil, but Phil does not believe this. Claire finally convinces Phil to ask his father what is wrong, though when he gets ready to ask, Phil instead avoids it with another question. Claire continues to be bothered by the dog, though it becomes clear she begins bonding with it. Finally, Phil asks Frank what is wrong and Frank tells Phil he fell in love, making Phil <b>think</b> <b>his</b> parents are divorcing. Then he says {{he fell in love with}} a he...Scout. Phil tells him he can take Scout home and Claire, who ends up being the most upset that Scout is leaving, gives Scout her bra. Frank then leaves with Luke (Nolan Gould) chasing the RV like a dog.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the loss}} of the Sydney Test the Australians were still confident, they had won by an innings, England had won {{narrowly}} {{in the absence of the}} Australian captain Ian Johnson and the great all-rounder Keith Miller, who now returned to the team. Miller was playing despite the advice of his doctor who warned him not to bowl on his injured knee and said himself that he didn't <b>think</b> <b>his</b> back could take the strain of bowling. Len Maddocks replaced Gil Langley as wicket-keeper as the latter had been hit in the eye by a bail in a Sheffield Shield match. England received Denis Compton at the expense of Tom Graveney, but faced a crisis on the first day of the Test when Len Hutton refused to leave his bed because of his fibrositis and a heavy cold. The manager Geoffrey Howard, George Duckworth, Bill Edrich and Godfrey Evans had to persuade him to play so as to not damage the morale of the team, especially as the series was locked at 1–1. Finally Hutton agreed to play and went to the ground. The wicket was worse than Sydney. After the MCC's match against Victoria it had broken up completely had had to be repaired and was covered with cracks even before the Test began.|$|E

500|$|At Suffolk, Longstreet grew {{impatient}} with Pickett's frequent trips {{away from his}} division to see Sallie {{at her home in}} nearby Chuckatuck. Pickett then decided to ask for permission for the visits from Longstreet's chief of staff, Moxley Sorrel, who referred him to Longstreet. Instead of asking again, Pickett went without permission. After the war, Sorrel commented, [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>his</b> division benefitted by such carpet-knight doings in the field." ...|$|E
500|$|Jackie Long as Benjamin [...] "Esquire" [...] Gordon, a {{close friend}} of Rashad's. The {{character}} of Esquire was inspired by a friend of producer Austin's, who worked at a country club but would tell his friends he worked at a hot dog joint. [...] "And you’d <b>think</b> <b>his</b> family had money, but he lived in the projects." [...] Long auditioned a year prior to shooting the film at the director's home in California. [...] "And he was a long shot but he came in and he became that character," [...] said Robinson.|$|E

500|$|The filmmaker {{has often}} cited Dutch graphic artist M. C. Escher {{as a major}} {{influence}} on his own work. [...] "I'm very inspired by the prints of M. C. Escher and the interesting connection-point or blurring of boundaries between art and science, and art and mathematics." [...] Another source of inspiration is Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges. The director has called Memento a [...] "strange cousin" [...] to Funes the Memorious, and has said, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>his</b> writing naturally lends itself to a cinematic interpretation because it is all about efficiency and precision, the bare bones of an idea." ...|$|E
500|$|Kruger was by {{this time}} widely {{perceived}} as a personification of Afrikanerdom {{both at home and}} abroad. When he stopped going to the government offices at the Raadsaal by foot and began to be conveyed there by a presidential carriage, his coming and going became a public spectacle not unlike the Changing of the Guard in Britain. [...] "Once seen, he is not easily forgotten", wrote Lady Phillips.

500|$|Corporal Sam Jenkins and PFC Preston were {{captured}} {{before they reached}} Allied lines, and they later joined Bouck {{and the rest of}} the platoon in prison. The men barely survived, most suffering from the advanced effects of malnutrition. When Task Force Baum from Patton's 4th Armored Division attempted to liberate the camp, Captain Abe Baum was surprised at the large number of prisoners and was unable to rescue them all. Almost all of Baum's unit was captured; Bouck was recaptured and was finally released one week before the war ended. He was too weak to file a combat report, and hospitalized for several months after the war ended. He did not <b>think</b> <b>his</b> men had accomplished that much. [...] "We were in those foxholes and ... what we did was to defend ourselves and try to live through it." ...|$|E

[...] Brian [...] "DJ Z" [...] Zisook of hip-hop website DJBooth, who is Jewish, wrote an editorial denouncing that line for its alleged anti-Semitism.

500|$|Waxy first {{stood at}} Lewes {{for a fee}} of 10 guineas per mare and a groom fee of 10 shillings. In September 1803, Sir Ferdinando Poole offered to sell Waxy for 700 guineas to William Lightfoot, an agent sent to buy horses for Virginian turfman John Tayloe. Lightfoot refused to buy Waxy, writing to Tayloe, [...] "he has lost an eye, and is {{thirteen}} years old, and I <b>think</b> <b>his</b> health bad." [...] Instead Lightfoot purchased Waxy's half-sister Keren Happuch who was covered by Waxy that year. It is unclear how Waxy lost his eye, its loss occurring sometime between 1797 and 1803. Sir Ferdinando Poole died on 8 June 1804, and Waxy was then acquired by the Duke of Grafton and relocated to the Euston Hall stud near Newmarket. Under the Duke's ownership, his fee increased to 25 guineas per mare and he covered 40 mares per season.|$|E
