MethodsThe convenience sampling method {{was used to}} select the Subject of the study. In total, 180 third-year, fourth-year, and fifth-year nursing undergraduate students were enrolled in this study. A self-designed scale <b>of</b> clinical <b>thinking</b> <b>ability</b> was used to collect the data. SPSS 17. 0 was {{used to analyze the}} data. ResultsThe average scores <b>of</b> clinical <b>thinking</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> undergraduate nursing students were 68. 14  ±  9. 13. in addition, 71. 1 % of the students have a higher level <b>of</b> clinical <b>thinking</b> <b>ability,</b> and only 7. 2 % of the students have the best level. The ANOVA test showed that the fourth-year students had the highest scores (72. 96  ±  8. 64), and the third-year students had the lowest scores (62. 35  ±  8. 09), which indicated {{a significant difference in the}} scores of the three groups (F =  26. 79, P <  0. 05).

The research method used in this research is a quasi-experiment with Non-Equivalent Control Group Design research design. Sampling was used by using purposive sampling technique. The sample of this study class X. 2 as the experiment amounted to 20 and class X. 3 as the control class amounted to 21 students. The results {{of this study indicate that}} the average N-gain of the experimental class is 0. 61 which is in the medium category and the average N-gain for the control class is 0. 24 which belongs to the low category. Data analysis using t-test with significant level 0, 05 obtained tcount = 5, 674 while ttable = 1, 685 seen that tcount> ttabel. Therefore (Ha) accepted and (H 0) rejected thus can be concluded that the learning model of Challenge Based Learning has an effect on critical <b>thinking</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> class X SMA 4 Prabumulih. ...|$|R
