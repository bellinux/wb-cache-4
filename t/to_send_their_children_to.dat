5|$|Educators face {{considerable}} challenges {{due to the}} nation's {{dispersed population}} and {{a certain degree of}} reluctance on the part of parents <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>to</b> school. Although attendance is compulsory, only 68 percent of boys attend primary school, {{and more than half of}} the population is illiterate. Higher education is provided at the University of N'Djamena. At 33 percent, Chad has one of the lowest literacy rates of Sub-Saharan Africa.|$|E
5|$|In 1974 most of River Oaks was {{assigned}} to River Oaks Elementary School. Prior to desegregation, it had around 800 children. After desegregation, many parents removed their children from River Oaks Elementary, and the school was far below capacity. In 1986 the neighborhood component of the school closed. At the time River Oaks had mainly older families. At the time the remaining families who did have children had the money <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>to</b> private school and preferred to do so.|$|E
5|$|When Ross {{arrived at}} the school, he found no running water, a housing shortage, a disgruntled faculty, and many {{students}} running wild. As Ross began to make improvements, parents began <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>to</b> the school {{in the hopes that}} they would learn from Ross's example. Although enrollment had always been limited to men, in 1893, Ethel Hudson, the daughter of an A professor, became the first woman to attend classes at the school and helped edit the annual yearbook. She was made an honorary member of the class of 1895. Several years later her twin sisters became honorary members of the class of 1903, and slowly other daughters of Aggie professors were allowed to attend classes.|$|E
25|$|Some {{parents also}} opt <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> for {{religious}} classes after secular classes. Sunday schools and after school {{classes at the}} mosque are various options available.|$|R
50|$|Other {{reasons are}} that the parents of fushugaku <b>children</b> want <b>their</b> <b>children</b> {{to go to a}} school where they would use their native language. However, such schools cost between 30,000 and 50,000 yen per month, so parents cannot afford <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>their</b> <b>children.</b>|$|R
25|$|Due to its location, {{the school}} is popular with Cambridge {{academics}} as a place <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>their</b> <b>children,</b> {{as well as a}} place to teach. Stephen Hawking sent his son to the school and has given a number of talks to its pupils since then.|$|R

5000|$|A unique {{aspect to}} the small village, State Route 130 is the {{division}} between Mount Pleasant Area School District and Ligonier Valley School District.

5000|$|In 1970 in {{the wake}} of school desegregation, Branton and {{colleague}} Ford E. Stinson of Bossier Parish urged the repeal of the Louisiana compulsory attendance law.

25|$|The {{city has}} a {{literacy}} rate of 95.5%, with most children attending public or private schools. Public education has been a priority of the municipality {{of the city and}} the government of the state of Paraná; however, most middle and upper-class families continue <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>to</b> elite private schools.|$|E
30|$|Parents’ {{pressure}} {{is easy to}} explain. Whenever you change something new, they [parents] panic. Parents are so used <b>to</b> <b>sending</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>to</b> cram schools [to prepare for exams]. But now, even cram schools {{do not know how}} to teach [using inquiry]. Of course, parents panicked, so they rejected this policy.|$|R
50|$|From 1968, Taiwan {{started the}} 9-year {{compulsory}} education system, revitalising Yan Ping. The differences {{between public and}} private junior high school were eliminated, so more parents were willing <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>their</b> <b>child</b> <b>to</b> the school. The new students in the junior high school excelled in the high school entry examination.|$|R

All three children were sent to St Andrew's School, Pangbourne and both daughters were sent to Downe House, a girls' boarding school in Cold Ash and Marlborough College, Wiltshire. James also attended Marlborough.|$|E
25|$|Boston Public Schools {{operates}} numerous {{schools in}} East Boston. BPS assigns students based on student preference and priorities {{of students in}} various zones. Due to the geography of East Boston, every child in the neighborhood is guaranteed a seat at a school in East Boston. The district instructs parents wanting <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>to</b> East Boston schools to place East Boston campuses on their school assignment priority lists higher than non-neighborhood campus.|$|E
25|$|Their militant {{stance is}} {{increasingly}} coming under criticism from pupils, {{parents and the}} public alike. The number of pupils receiving ethnic education from Chongryon-affiliated schools has declined sharply in recent years, down to about 10,000 in 2009 {{from a high of}} 46,000 in the early 1970s, with many, if not most, Zainichi now opting <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>to</b> mainstream Japanese schools. As of March 2010, there were 12 Chosen high schools with an enrollment of about 2,000 students.|$|E
50|$|Families {{arriving}} in Canberra {{soon after the}} war were often accommodated in hostels such as Reid House or the Acton Hotel, sometimes initially they were offered {{a room in the}} house of a colleague.

40|$|This {{research}} {{looks at}} the factors motivating Gambian-British and Nigerian-British parents <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> ‘back’ <b>to</b> West Africa and what this means for parents, children and families on both continents. IOE Research Briefings are short descriptions of significant research findings, based on {{the wide range of}} projects carried out by IOE researchers...|$|R
5000|$|McAdams {{wrote that}} in 1995 White parents liked the {{demographics}} {{because there was}} a [...] "high-cost, first class education in an almost perfect ethnic mix, and all this with ethnic harmony." [...] McAdams wrote that the demographics made the school attractive to River Oaks parents who wanted <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> there.|$|R
25|$|Although Canada {{at first}} {{provided}} a more tolerant religious environment than the Russian Empire, conflict soon developed, most importantly over the schooling {{of children and}} land registration. These Svobodniki (Russian: free people) generally refused <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>to</b> government-run schools. The governments of Saskatchewan and later British Columbia did not heed reports by sociologists to appease the concerns of parents, and chose to legally charge many of the parents for not sending the children to school.|$|E
25|$|Quebec has {{the highest}} {{proportion}} of children going to private schools in North America. The phenomenon is not restricted to the well-to-do. Many middle class, lower middle class and even working class families scrimp and save <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>to</b> private schools. The government of Quebec gives a Pro rata subsidy for each child to any private school which meets its standards and follows its prescriptions, reducing tuition costs to approximately 30% of non-subsidized private schools.|$|E
25|$|With the {{disappearance}} of Edvard Beneš from the political scene, the Czechoslovak government issued decree No. 76/1948 on April 13, 1948, allowing those Hungarians still living in Czechoslovakia, to reinstate Czechoslovak citizenship. A year later, Hungarians were allowed <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>to</b> Hungarian schools, which had been reopened {{for the first time}} since 1945, although Hungarians remaining in Slovakia were subjected to extremely heavy pressure to assimilate, and complaints reached Moscow about forced enrollment of Hungarian children in Slovak schools.|$|E

50|$|Parents {{can choose}} the school to which they wish <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>their</b> <b>child.</b> It is not {{uncommon}} that there be insufficient places in a popular school for all the children for whom places are requested. In such cases places are allocated according to rather strictly defined admissions criteria as defined in Annex IX to the order establishing the process.|$|R
50|$|Similarities {{include the}} {{normalization}} of propaganda and surveillance with the telescreens in 1984 and the TVs on school buses spouting so called educational content {{that turns out}} to be blatantly false. These novels also touch on brainwashing, with the nightly emails sent to parents that convince them <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> away <b>to</b> reform camps from which they never return.|$|R
25|$|Bernard Landry shuffled {{his cabinet}} on January 30, 2002, and reassigned Simard as {{minister}} of state for education and employment, minister of education, minister responsible for employment, and minister responsible for the Outaouais. Simard delivered an education policy statement in March 2002, in which he promised to maintain Quebec's longstanding freeze on university tuition rates and remove a legislative loophole that allowed non-anglophone parents <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>to</b> English public schools after one year at an English private school.|$|E
25|$|Two {{sorts of}} {{opposition}} to the law emerged. One was from nonsectarian private schools, such as the Hill Military Academy, which were primarily concerned {{with the loss of}} their revenue. This loss was felt almost immediately, as parents began withdrawing their children from private schools in the belief that these would soon cease to exist. The other was from religious private schools, such as those run by the Society of Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary, which were concerned about the right of parents <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>to</b> parochial schools.|$|E
25|$|Under German rule, {{parents were}} obliged <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>to</b> school, and {{cleanliness}} {{as well as}} hygiene were strictly enforced. Clerk taught his converts to plant cocoa using more mechanized methods and his pioneering work in agriculture bore fruit years later. The German administration insisted that Ewe should be taught in the mission's schools instead of the Basel-preferred language of Twi. As a result, Clerk could not continue his work in Buem. In the 1904 (the year he left), the Basel Mission station {{was transferred to the}} jurisdiction of the Bremen Mission.|$|E
50|$|The main {{attraction}} for the South Indian students, especially from Kerala, {{is due to}} the teaching of Kerala Syllabus and Malayalam. There were not many options for the Keralite families <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> elsewhere. The teaching of all the languages extends up to the tenth standard, after which the students would have various language and syllabuses to choose from.|$|R
