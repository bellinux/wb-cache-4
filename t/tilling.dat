5|$|Maharashtraian Brahmins were {{absentee}} landlords {{and lived}} off the surplus without <b>tilling</b> the land themselves per ritual restrictions. They were {{often seen as}} the exploiter of the tiller. This situation started to change when the newly independent India enshrined in its constitution, agrarian or land reform. Between 1949–1959, the state governments started enacting legislation {{in accordance with the}} constitution implementing this agrarian reform or Kula Kayada in Marathi. The legislation led to the abolition of various absentee tenures like inams and jagirs. This implementation of land reform had mixed results in different States. On official inquiry, it was revealed that not all absentee tenures were abolished in the State of Maharashtra as of 1985. Other social and political issues include anti-Brahminism and the treatment of Dalits.|$|E

5|$|There were varying {{types of}} land {{ownership}} and tenure {{depending on the}} topography and climate of one's locality. In hilly, peripheral areas far from trade routes, most peasant farmers owned and cultivated their own fields. In frontier regions such as Hunan and Sichuan, owners of wealthy estates gathered serfs to till their lands. The most advanced areas had few estates with serfs <b>tilling</b> the fields; these regions had long fostered wet-rice cultivation, which did not require centralized management of farming. Landlords set fixed rents for tenant farmers in these regions, while independent small farming families also owned their own lots.|$|E

5|$|It is a hairy {{biennial}} {{plant that}} can grow to 2 m tall or more. Its small, yellow flowers are densely grouped on a tall stem, which grows {{from a large}} rosette of leaves. It grows {{in a wide variety}} of habitats, but prefers well-lit, disturbed soils, where it can appear soon after the ground receives light, from long-lived seeds that persist in the soil seed bank. It is a common weedy plant that spreads by prolifically producing seeds, but it rarely becomes aggressively invasive, since its seeds require open ground to germinate. It is a very minor problem for most agricultural crops, since it is not a very competitive species, being intolerant of shade from other plants and unable to survive <b>tilling.</b> It also hosts many insects, some of which can be harmful to other plants. Although individuals are easy to remove by hand, populations are difficult to eliminate permanently.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT We present sedimentological {{observations}} from the Tiskilwa <b>Till</b> in northern Illinois, and the Sky Pilot <b>Till</b> in northern Manitoba, that indicate deposition of these <b>tills</b> by subglacial defor-mation. These generally homogenous <b>tills</b> grade downward into more heterogeneous <b>tills</b> that incorporate underlying sediment into their matrix, indicating entrainment of older sediments by sediment defor-mation. Deformed sand inclusions within these <b>tills</b> imply deformation of the <b>tills</b> and inclusions prior to deposition. The Tiskilwa <b>Till</b> has rela-tively high fabric strength throughout its thickness, whereas fabric {{strength in the}} Sky Pilot <b>Till</b> generally increases up-section in 2 to 3 m thick increments. Fabric orientations in both <b>tills</b> rotate up-section, possibly due to changes in ice-flow direction associated with the thic-kening and thinning of ice, and changes in ice-flow divide location. In both the Tiskilwa and Sky Pilot <b>Tills,</b> the change in fabric orientation occurs over intervals of ~ 1 m, suggesting that the maximum depth of deformation was ≤ 1 m insofar as any greater depth of deformation would have reoriented <b>till</b> fabric during maximum ice extent and retreat. In {{the case of the}} Sky Pilot <b>Till,</b> the up-section increase in macrofabric strength indicates that strain increased up-section. These data suggest that these <b>tills</b> were deposited in a time transgressive manner as strain migrated upwards with the delivery of new <b>till</b> either released from the ice base or advected from up-ice.

5|$|The {{indigenous}} {{peoples of the}} Americas living near the east coast used pieces of shell as wampum. The channeled whelk (Busycotypus canaliculatus) and the quahog (Mercenaria mercenaria) were used to make white and purple traditional patterns. The shells were cut, rolled, polished and drilled before being strung together and woven into belts. These were used for personal, social and ceremonial purposes and also, at a later date, for currency. The Winnebago Tribe from Wisconsin had numerous uses for freshwater mussels including using them as spoons, cups, ladles and utensils. They notched them to provide knives, graters and saws. They carved them into fish hooks and lures. They incorporated powdered shell into clay to temper their pottery vessels. They used them as scrapers for removing flesh from hides and for separating the scalps of their victims. They used shells as scoops for gouging out fired logs when building canoes and they drilled holes in them and fitted wooden handles for <b>tilling</b> the ground.|$|E
5|$|The {{landscape}} of Texas was changed {{as a result}} of some Spanish policies. As early as the 1690s, Spaniards brought European livestock, including cattle, horses, and mules, with them on their expeditions throughout the province. Some of the livestock strayed or stayed behind when the Spanish retreated from the territory in 1693, allowing the Indian tribes to begin loosely managing herds of the animals. These herds grazed heavily on the native grasses, allowing mesquite, which was native to the lower Texas coast, to spread inland. Although the introduced livestock were able to adapt to the changing conditions, the buffalo had a more difficult time grazing among the new vegetation, beginning the decline in their numbers. Spanish farmers also introduced <b>tilling</b> and irrigation to the land, further changing the landscape. Spanish architectural concepts were also adopted by those in Texas, including the addition of patios, tile floors and roofs, arched windows and doorways, carved wooden doors, and wrought iron grillwork.|$|E

50|$|As {{developed}} between 1894 and 1909, the Kansan Stage {{was based on}} a model that assumed that the Pleistocene deposits contained only two glacial <b>tills</b> and one volcanic ash bed within Nebraska and Kansas.

40|$|Glacial {{stratigraphy}} of the West Estonian Islands comprises {{three different}} diamicton units which are correlated event-stratigraphically to the Pandivere and Palivere ice advances {{of the most}} recent (Late Weichselian) glaciation and included into the Vörtsjärve Subformation according to Estonian stratigraphic nomenclature.

40|$|The {{qualitative}} and quantitative characteristics of microstructures in a <b>till</b> were analysed with SEM; it was also investigated whether the results depend on the <b>till’s</b> mesostructural characteristics. The <b>till,</b> exposed in a few open-cast browncoal mines near Konin in central Poland, is cut by numerous fractures which correspond to Riedel shear patterns, P-type structures and C-S type foliations. The fractures developed {{as a result of}} simple shearing induced by movement of the base of the Odranian ice sheet. On the basis of fracture density, two <b>till</b> types are distinguished: coarsely-brecciated <b>till</b> (wide spacing of fractures) and finely-brecciated <b>till</b> (closely spaced fractures). It is found that the fracture density is reflected in the microstructure of the <b>till.</b> The finely-brecciated <b>till</b> is characterised by a high porosity and has predominantly anisometric and fissure-like pores that also show a more clearly preferred orientation than the pores in the coarsely-brecciated <b>till.</b> In contrast, the coarsely-brecciated <b>till</b> has anisometric pores that show a less preferential orientation. The porosity of the coarsely-brecciated <b>till</b> is lower than in the finely-brecciated <b>till.</b> The finely-brecciated <b>till</b> probably represents a strongly deformed deposit, related in some cases to zones developed along thrusts that cut the <b>till.</b> Positive correlation between the porosity, the spatial arrangement of pores, and the density of fractures suggests a synsedimentary origin of the shear strain. This strain was accommodated by a particulate flow developed within both wide, pervasive zones and narrow, localised zones. The hydraulic conditions within the subglacial shear zone controlled rheological differences within the <b>till</b> during deformation and thus influenced the degree of the microstructure alteration...|$|R

40|$|The {{rheology}} and hydro-mechanical interactions at the ice–bed interface form {{an important}} component of the glacier system, influencing glacier dynamics and the formation of <b>till.</b> We demonstrate that the sand-rich <b>till</b> at Briksdalsbreen in Norway, undergoes deformation throughout the year. On the bulk rheology scale, <b>till</b> deformation exhibits elastic behaviour during the winter, when water pressures are low; and linear viscous behaviour after a critical yield stress of 35 kPa, when water pressures are high during the spring and summer. On the clast and matrix scale, low water pressures, correspond with high case stress variability and <b>till</b> temperatures. Meltwater driven, stick-slip, glacier velocity increases were transmitted through a relatively strong <b>till</b> grain network, causing brittle deformation. Intermediate water pressures, during late summer were linked to intermediate case stress variability and high <b>till</b> temperatures associated with the heat generated from stick-slip motion. High water pressures in the <b>till</b> were associated with low case stress variability and low, meltwater controlled, <b>till</b> temperatures, and occurred in the spring and autumn. Once the <b>till</b> was saturated, the ductile <b>till</b> absorbed any stick-slip velocity increases. We discuss, with examples, the different <b>till</b> forming processes associated with these changing conditions, demonstrating that the resultant <b>till</b> will represent a complex amalgamation of all of these processes. <br/...|$|R
