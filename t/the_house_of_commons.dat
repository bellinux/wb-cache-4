5|$|On 19 January 1999, the Leader of <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> <b>Commons,</b> Margaret Beckett, {{introduced}} the House of Lords Bill into <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> <b>Commons.</b> <b>The</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> <b>Commons</b> passed the bill {{by a vote}} of 340 to 132 on 16 March. The next day it was presented to the House of Lords, where debate on the bill was far longer. One significant amendment made to the Bill was the so-called Weatherill Amendment, named for the Lord Weatherill, the former Speaker of <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> <b>Commons.</b> The Weatherill Amendment put into place the deal agreed to by the Prime Minister and Viscount Cranborne, and allowed 92 hereditary peers to remain members of the House of Lords.|$|E
5|$|After the Reform Bill was {{rejected}} in the Lords, <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> <b>Commons</b> immediately passed a {{motion of confidence}} affirming their support for Lord Grey's administration. Because parliamentary rules prohibited {{the introduction of the}} same bill twice during the same session, the ministry advised the new king, William IV, to prorogue Parliament. As soon as the new session began in December 1831, the Third Reform Bill was brought forward. The bill was in a few respects different from its predecessors; it no longer proposed a reduction in the total membership of <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> <b>Commons,</b> and it reflected data collected during the census that had just been completed. The new version passed in <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> <b>Commons</b> by even larger majorities in March 1832; it was once again sent up to the House of Lords.|$|E

5|$|After the Union of England and Scotland in 1707, Scottish peers, {{including}} {{those who did not}} sit as representative peers, were excluded from <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> <b>Commons.</b> Irish peers were more favoured and not subjected to the same restrictions. Irish members not nominated as representative peers were allowed to serve in Parliament as representatives of a constituencies in Great Britain, although not in Ireland, provided they gave up their privileges as a peer. Lord Curzon, for example, specifically requested an Irish peerage so he would not be debarred from sitting in <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> <b>Commons.</b>|$|E
