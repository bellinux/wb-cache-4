5|$|Across {{the county}} line, US31 {{continues}} eastward, passing {{north of the}} community of Interlochen. At Interlochen Corners, it intersects M-137. The highway then angles northeasterly north of Duck Lake and south of Silver Lake. A few miles farther east, US31 meets M-37 at a location known as Chums Corners. The two highways join and run northward through the unincorporated community. It passes Wuerfel Park, the home stadium for the <b>Traverse</b> City Beach Bums, a minor-league baseball team. From there, US31/M-37 runs downhill into Garfield Township. In this area, the highway passes through a cluster of retail stores and car dealerships near the Grand <b>Traverse</b> Mall. North of the intersection with 14th Street, the trunkline follows Division Street into <b>Traverse</b> City. From there it runs to the east of Grand <b>Traverse</b> Commons, the former <b>Traverse</b> City State Hospital, before US31/M-37 meets Grandview Parkway next to the West Arm of the Grand <b>Traverse</b> Bay.|$|E
5|$|M-72 starts its trans-peninsular journey at M-22 in the {{community}} of Empire on the shores of Lake Michigan in the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore. From there it runs easterly uphill through mixed farmland and forest to cross the base of the Leelanau Peninsula. As the highway approaches the city of <b>Traverse</b> City, the roadway runs downhill and weaves {{back and forth across the}} Leelanau– Grand <b>Traverse</b> county line. M-72 merges with M-22 to run concurrently in the section of <b>Traverse</b> City in Leelanau County and immediately cross the county line into Grand <b>Traverse</b> County. The two highways run along Grandview Parkway, a four-lane boulevard on the shore of the West Arm of Grand <b>Traverse</b> Bay. At the intersection of Grandview Parkway and Division Street, M-22 ends. US31/M-37 run north along Division Street and turn east onto Grandview Parkway to join M-72. These three highways stay merged in a triple concurrency along the length of Grandview Parkway and across the Boardman River along the bay, bypassing downtown. They then follow Front Street until reaching Garfield Avenue east of downtown. At Garfield, M-37 turns north to run up the Old Mission Peninsula which separates the west and east arms of Grand <b>Traverse</b> Bay. US31/M-72 continues east along the shores of the East Arm of Grand <b>Traverse</b> Bay and northward to a junction in Acme. M-72 turns east to cross rural eastern Grand <b>Traverse</b> County along rolling hills through the communities of Williamsburg and Barker Creek.|$|E

5|$|At that intersection, the {{trunkline}} {{meets the}} northern end of M-22, which is running concurrently with M-72 along the parkway. As US31/M-37 turns east to run along the bay north of downtown, the highway merges with M-72 and picks up the LMCT again. Grandview Parkway runs between the Boardman River and the bay. Near the mouth of the river, US31/M-37/M-72 turns to follow Front Street along the remainder of the bay's shoreline. At Garfield Avenue, M-37 turns northward to run up the Old Mission Peninsula, and US31/M-72 continues across the base of the peninsula to the East Arm of the Grand <b>Traverse</b> Bay. The highway runs north of the Cherry Capital Airport near the east arm as it angles southeasterly to <b>Traverse</b> City State Park. East of the park, the trunkline exits suburban <b>Traverse</b> City and rounds the bay to run northward along its eastern shore. In the community of Acme, M-72 turns eastward while US31 continues north past the Grand <b>Traverse</b> Resort.|$|E

5|$|M-42 is an {{original}} state trunkline {{dating back to}} the 1919 signage of the highway system in Michigan. The original highway routing started at M-13 in Manton and ran due west to Mesick. From there the highway turned north and met M-11 at Chums Corners. M-11/M-42 ran concurrently northward into the City of <b>Traverse</b> City where M-42 ended. By May 1929, M-42 was extended east to connect to Lake City. The highway was further extended before 1936 up the Old Mission Peninsula north of <b>Traverse</b> City. In the latter half of 1940, the M-37 designation replaced M-42 north of Mesick through <b>Traverse</b> City to Old Mission. The last sections of highway were paved in late 1951 and early 1952.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{improvement}} of central <b>traversing</b> system on rotor spinning machines, where rectilinear motion with variable stroke is used. A new system of <b>traversing</b> rod with implemented set of magnetic-mechanical energy accumulators is described. Mathematical model of this system is analysed in the MSC.

Analysis results prove the enhancement of devised <b>traversing</b> system, where the overall dynamic force is reduced considerably. At the same time, the precision of the <b>traversing</b> movement over the machine length is increased. This enables to increase machine operating speed while satisfying both the maximal tensile strength of the <b>traversing</b> rod and also output bobbin size standards. The usage of the developed mathematical model for determination of the optimal number and distribution of accumulators over the <b>traversing</b> rod of optional parameters is proved. The potential of the devised system for high-performance rotor spinning machines with longer <b>traversing</b> rod is also discussed...|$|R

5|$|US31/M-37 {{enters the}} south side of <b>Traverse</b> City near the {{intersection}} with South Airport Road and the Grand <b>Traverse</b> Mall. As the highway heads towards Grand <b>Traverse</b> Bay and downtown, it passes several car dealerships, an outlet mall and other retailers. After the city limits, the roadway is also given the name Division Street. North of 14th Street, US31/M-37 passes the former <b>Traverse</b> City State Hospital, a Kirkbride Plan former mental asylum. This section of town is mostly residential except for the old state hospital and Munson Medical Center. North of Front Street, Division Street meets Grandview Parkway. This roadway runs along the bay from the northwest carrying M-22/M-72. When the two streets meet, M-22 ends, and US31/M-37 and M-72 merge into a triple concurrency along the bay north of downtown <b>Traverse</b> City. Grandview Parkway passes the Open Space park, the marina, the former Clinch Park Zoo and runs along a narrow piece of land between the Boardman River and the bay. Grandview Parkway ends east of the mouth of the river, and the highway continues along Front Street past the Great Lakes Maritime Academy and the home berth of the TS State of Michigan to Garfield Avenue near the campus of Northwestern Michigan College. M-37 turns north along Garfield Avenue to Peninsula Drive, leaving US31/M-72.|$|E
