5|$|A primary {{theme of}} <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> {{was that the}} CPUSA sought to convert the US to {{socialism}} by education, not by force. <b>The</b> <b>defense</b> claimed {{that most of the}} prosecution's documentary evidence came from older texts that pre-dated the 1935 Seventh World Congress of the Comintern, after which the CPUSA rejected violence as a means of change. Starobin, p 207. <b>The</b> <b>defense</b> attempted to introduce documents into evidence which represented the CPUSA's advocacy of peace, claiming that these policies superseded the older texts that the prosecution had introduced which emphasized violence. Medina excluded most of the material proposed by <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> because it did not directly pertain to the specific documents the prosecution had produced. As a result, <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> complained that they were unable to portray the totality of their belief system to the jury.|$|E
5|$|Conley was cross-examined by <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> for 16 {{hours over}} three days, but <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> failed {{to break his}} story. <b>The</b> <b>defense</b> then moved to have Conley's entire {{testimony}} concerning the alleged rendezvous stricken from the record. Judge Roan noted that an early objection might have been upheld, but since the jury could not forget what it had heard, he allowed the evidence to stand. The prosecution, to support Frank's alleged expectation of a visit from Phagan, produced Helen Ferguson, a factory worker who first informed Phagan's parents of her death. Ferguson testified that {{she had tried to}} get Phagan's pay on Friday from Frank, but was told that Phagan would have to come in person. Both the person behind the pay window and the woman behind Ferguson in the pay line disputed this version of events, testifying that in accordance with his normal practice, Frank did not disburse pay that day.|$|E

By his second year, in 2000, the Ravens' defense set NFL records for fewest points allowed and fewest rushing yards allowed. <b>The</b> <b>defense</b> allowed a {{combined}} 23 points in four playoff games {{en route to a}} Super Bowl XXXV victory, Ryan's only Super Bowl ring, over the New York Giants. <b>The</b> <b>defense</b> consistently performed well in the following years. As a result, Ryan was promoted to defensive coordinator in 2005 following the departure of Mike Nolan, who became the head coach of the San Francisco 49ers. In 2006, Ryan received Assistant Coach of the Year awards from Pro Football Weekly and the Pro Football Writers Association.|$|E

5|$|On April 1, <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> {{asked for}} the new trial to be moved outside Brownsville, {{claiming}} their client had received unfair treatment {{in the media and}} there was no chance for her to have a fair trial and an unbiased jury. The request included large numbers of magazines and newspaper articles published since 1993. It did not cite any specific passages where the alleged media bias was demonstrated. <b>The</b> <b>defense</b> also filed a motion to throw out the new indictment {{on the grounds that it}} was double jeopardy. On April 27, the judge decided to postpone his decision about where to hold the trial. He also rejected <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> motion stating that the new indictment was a case of double jeopardy. <b>The</b> <b>defense</b> argued that the prosecution had illegally used Brownsville and Houston grand juries to work on the case, but the judge countered that claim saying only the Houston grand jury had handled the case. On May 4, the trial was moved from Brownsville to Houston, Texas, because of the earlier extensive media coverage.|$|E
5|$|On August 6, 1981, Ray Taylor {{was arrested}} {{for the murder of}} Jack Bridges in a fight in Chicago. In advance of the trial, the {{prosecutor}} submitted a request for all <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> witnesses in the case. <b>The</b> <b>defense</b> attorney for Taylor provided a list of four individuals, which did not include witnesses Alfred Wormley and Pam Berkhalter. When the defendant tried to introduce these witnesses {{on the second day of}} the trial, the trial judge sanctioned <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> for failing to put the witness names on the original list provided to the prosecution. Therefore, it ruled the two unlisted witnesses would not be allowed to testify. The trial judge was specifically frustrated that the witness, Wormley, was known to <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> prior to trial, but was hidden away from the prosecution.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>defense</b> of Machias {{consisted}} of local militia {{under the command}} of Colonel Jonathan Eddy, the leader of the 1776 attack on Fort Cumberland. He had been warned that the British were organizing an attack. The militia laid a log boom across the Machias River, and constructed several earthen redoubts further upriver, armed with cannons taken from local privateers. <b>The</b> <b>defense</b> was coincidentally reinforced by forty to fifty Maliseet, Passamaquoddy, and Penobscots that Colonel Allan had called to Machias to explain what had gone wrong with his expedition.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>defense</b> {{relied on}} the {{provision}} of the Tenure of Office Act that made it applicable only to appointees of the current administration. Since Lincoln had appointed Stanton, <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> maintained Johnson had not violated the act, and also argued that the President {{had the right to}} test the constitutionality of an act of Congress. Johnson's counsel insisted that he make no appearance at the trial, nor publicly comment about the proceedings, and except for a pair of interviews in April, he complied.|$|E

50|$|By {{the late}} 1930s, <b>the</b> two {{standard}} <b>defenses</b> {{in college and}} the NFL were the 6-2 and the 5-3.

5|$|The {{prosecution}} {{brought forward}} bank statements {{that showed that}} Cisneros withdrew US$5,000 from a US$100,000 family safety deposit box on July 7, 1992 and March 3, 1993, the morning Fischer was killed. <b>The</b> <b>defense</b> stated {{that there was nothing}} illegal about visiting the safety deposit box or making the withdrawal. They stated that the US$5,000 was for a family trip to Mexico. The prosecution suggested that the money was to pay off the murderers, but they were unable to provide evidence linking the two actions. On May 11, <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> introduced two witnesses to rest their case after six days of prosecution arguments. Most of the testimonies from the prosecution that day were done by Garza, who stated that Mart√≠nez never mentioned Cisneros's name as the person of who she was working with to have Fischer killed. Garza stated that he consulted Mart√≠nez on his marriage, but that she would interrupt to ask him if he had found anyone who was willing to carry out her client's request and hurt Fischer. Garza claimed that he had at least four calls from phone booths in San Fernando and Matamoros, two Mexican cities. <b>The</b> <b>defense</b> stated that Garza told the FBI that he made collect calls, but Garza said they were mistaken. He said that making collect calls from Mexico was difficult, though he did not discard the possibility of having made one to Mart√≠nez. The prosecution did not enter evidence showing that Garza made calls from Mexico to the U.S., and one of <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> witness showed that Mart√≠nez's phone bill did not have any collect calls from Matamoros. <b>The</b> <b>defense</b> stated that Garza made the claim of the phone calls from Mexico to get a reduced sentence, while Garza responded that he was testifying to make sure everyone involved in the murder gets punished. <b>The</b> <b>defense</b> responded by showing the jury letters from Garza's jail stating {{that he was willing to}} cooperate with the FBI in the trial for a reduced sentence. Garza responded by saying that those letters were written by one of his English-literate inmates on his behalf. The other defense witness was a restaurateur who saw Cisneros a few hours after the murder and recalled seeing her behaving normally.|$|E
5|$|The {{prosecution}} presented {{witnesses who}} testified to bloodstains and {{strands of hair}} found on the lathe, to support their theory that the murder occurred on the factory's second floor in the machine room near Frank's office. <b>The</b> <b>defense</b> denied that the murder occurred on the second floor. Both sides contested the significance of physical evidence that suggested {{the place of the}} murder. Material found around Phagan's neck was shown to be present throughout the factory. The prosecution interpreted the scene in the basement to support Conley's storythat the body was carried there by elevatorwhile <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> suggested that the drag marks on the floor indicated that Conley carried the body down a ladder and then dragged it across the floor. <b>The</b> <b>defense</b> argued that Conley was the murderer and that Newt Lee helped Conley write the two murder notes. <b>The</b> <b>defense</b> brought many witnesses to support Frank's account of his movements, which indicated he did not have enough time to commit the crime.|$|E
