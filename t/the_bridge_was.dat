5|$|Construction {{began on}} 3 July 1979, and <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>was</b> {{commissioned}} on 10 October 1992 by the Hooghly River Bridge Commission.|$|E
5|$|It was {{designed}} by the Seattle architectural firm Jacobs & Ober, with Ralph Ober as the lead engineer on the project. Ober died in August 1931, of a brain hemorrhage while <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>was</b> still under construction. Federal funding programs were not yet available, so <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>was</b> funded by Seattle, King County, {{and the state of}} Washington.|$|E
5|$|On 1 December 2010, <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>was</b> {{closed for}} the first time due to heavy snow. After several {{accidents}} meant snowploughs were unable to clear the carriageways, <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>was</b> closed in both directions at 6.40a.m. and remained closed for several hours. As part of celebrations of the fiftieth anniversary of the bridge's operation, artist Kate Downie was commissioned to create a print of the bridge and hold an exhibition of works portraying it.|$|E

5|$|On 12 February 2014 <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>was</b> {{closed to}} traffic due to wind {{for the first}} time in living memory.|$|E
5|$|Serving as a {{link between}} Steubenville, Ohio and Weirton, West Virginia, the Fort Steuben Bridge opened as a toll bridge in November 1928. <b>The</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>was</b> the main carrier of U.S. Route 22 over the Ohio River, its traffic {{included}} trucks and heavy duty vehicles associated with the industrial facilities in Weirton-Steubenville area and along the Ohio River. The Fort Steuben Bridge provided a more direct route for the flow of traffic which previously {{had to use the}} Market Street Bridge. As of 1940 the toll for <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>was</b> 5 cents (US$ with inflation) for pedestrians and 25 cents (US$ with inflation) for automobiles. The toll was removed in 1947, when ownership of <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>was</b> transferred to the State of Ohio. Improvements to the bridge were made in 1956.|$|E
5|$|Since <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>was</b> {{opened in}} 1756, {{it has been}} the subject for many {{landscape}} artists, including Richard Wilson and Turner.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>is</b> an {{asymmetric}} {{cable-stayed bridge}} with two openings. Its total length is 173.5 metres, the main stay is 92 metres, the Jätkäsaari-side stay is 51.5 metres and {{the width of}} <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>is</b> 24.8 metres. <b>The</b> <b>bridge</b> has light traffic ways on both sides, two lanes for automobile traffic and tram tracks in both directions in the middle. The pylon is made of steel and inclined, and its top is at a height of 49 metres from the sea surface. The supporting structure of <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>is</b> a tensioned concrete slab, on <b>the</b> side <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>is</b> a joined construction. <b>The</b> <b>bridge</b> has special lighting. The appearance of <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>is</b> meant for airiness and lightness.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>is</b> {{still in}} use at Rainhill station, and carries traffic on the A57 (Warrington Road). <b>The</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>is</b> a listed structure.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>bridges</b> <b>were</b> {{designed}} {{primarily by}} Eli Cox. Eli {{and his sons}} built several of <b>the</b> <b>bridges</b> including Imes and Cutler-Donahoe. Some of <b>the</b> <b>bridges</b> <b>were</b> built by Benton Jones.|$|R
5|$|The State started {{saving for}} the new bridge in September 1954, and the {{construction}} of <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>was</b> approved by the Hawke state Labor government in November 1954, before the Hepburn-Stephenson metropolitan roads plan had been finalised, such was the urgency of a new traffic link. The construction of <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>was</b> subsequently endorsed in the 1955 Hepburn–Stephenson plan, which later developed into the Metropolitan Region Scheme.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>was</b> {{completed}} in 1928 by the NSW Department of Public Works and, although opened as a traffic bridge, {{it was designed}} to carry the loads required for a railway, once the Mildura railway line had been extended over the bridge. The line was never extended beyond Yelta, where the terminus remains to this day. The location of <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>was</b> thought to be convenient, as it provided a link to the Sturt Highway without travelling farther upstream to Mildura. It is the only remaining steel truss bridge with a lift span on the Murray, although other lifting bridges still exist along the river. <b>The</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>was</b> built after the decline in commercial river traffic on the Murray. Due to its significance to the local area, it has been listed on the NSW State Heritage Register.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>was</b> {{declared}} a Grade II* listed structure in 2008, providing protection {{to preserve its}} character from alteration.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>is</b> {{referred}} to in signage as Pony Express <b>Bridges</b> because there <b>are</b> separate <b>bridges</b> for east and west bound traffic. <b>The</b> <b>bridges</b> <b>were</b> built in 1983 to replace a truss bridge built in 1929. <b>The</b> truss <b>bridge</b> <b>was</b> demolished in March 1984.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>is</b> {{named after}} <b>the</b> {{nationality}} of the engineers who devised the project, who were of French origin. <b>The</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>is</b> {{also known as}} <b>the</b> French <b>Bridge.</b>|$|R

50|$|There <b>are</b> four covered <b>bridges</b> located around Vinton County. <b>The</b> {{most famous}} <b>bridge</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> Ponn <b>Bridge,</b> {{also known as}} <b>the</b> Humpback <b>Bridge.</b> It <b>was</b> built in 1874 and was the longest one in <b>the</b> county. <b>The</b> <b>bridge's</b> name came from the shape of <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> and there <b>are</b> only a few 'humpback' <b>bridges</b> left around <b>the</b> world. This <b>bridge</b> <b>was</b> burned down in June, 2013 by arsonists. In 1875, <b>the</b> Mt. Olive <b>Bridge</b> <b>was</b> built by a Civil War veteran named George Washington Pilcher. This <b>bridge</b> <b>is</b> open to foot traffic and goes over the Middle Fork Salt Creek. <b>The</b> Bay <b>Bridge</b> <b>is</b> located on <b>the</b> Vinton County Fairgrounds. It {{was moved to the}} fairgrounds in 1967 and is still open to pedestrians. <b>The</b> Cox <b>Bridge</b> <b>was</b> built in 1884. <b>The</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>is</b> open to foot traffic and has a picnic area near it. <b>The</b> Arbaugh <b>Bridge</b> <b>was</b> built in 1871, making it <b>the</b> oldest covered <b>bridge</b> in <b>the</b> county. <b>The</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> only one open to {{vehicles}} thanks to a grant that allowed for renovations.|$|R
5000|$|Because {{the valley}} under <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>is</b> inhabited, <b>the</b> design {{was limited to}} a single support pillar, located exactly {{in the middle of}} <b>the</b> <b>bridge.</b> [...] <b>The</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>is</b> stayed by a single {{suspension}} mast, located above the support pillar and from which radial cables fan out along the length of <b>the</b> <b>bridge.</b> Despite its reliance on a single mast for suspension, <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>is</b> notable for being curved along its entire length.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> two <b>bridges</b> <b>are</b> called <b>the</b> Engøysundet <b>Bridge</b> and Henningsvær <b>Bridge.</b> <b>The</b> Engøysundet <b>Bridge</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{northern}} <b>bridge</b> and it <b>is</b> 194 m {{long with}} a main span of 122 m. <b>The</b> Henningsvær <b>Bridge</b> <b>is</b> further south {{and it is}} 257 m long with a main span of 150 m. <b>The</b> <b>bridges</b> <b>were</b> opened in 1983.
