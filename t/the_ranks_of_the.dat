30|$|For {{the first}} problem, we can regard <b>the</b> <b>rank</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> moment matrix <b>of</b> <b>the</b> input {{trajectory}} vectors. <b>The</b> <b>rank</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> moment matrix {{can be obtained}} as <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> positive eigenvalues <b>of</b> <b>the</b> matrix. However, in <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> noise, all eigenvalues are non-zero in general. Hence, we need to truncate small eigenvalues, {{but it is difficult}} to determine a proper threshold.

50|$|In linear systems, {{indeterminacy}} occurs if {{and only}} if <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> independent equations (<b>the</b> <b>rank</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> augmented matrix <b>of</b> <b>the</b> system) is less than <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> unknowns and is <b>the</b> same as <b>the</b> <b>rank</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coefficient matrix. For if there are at least as many independent equations as unknowns that will eliminate any stretches <b>of</b> overlap <b>of</b> <b>the</b> equations' surfaces in <b>the</b> geometric space <b>of</b> <b>the</b> unknowns (aside from possibly a single point), so there cannot be more than one solution; and if <b>the</b> <b>rank</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> augmented matrix exceeds (necessarily by one if at all) <b>the</b> <b>rank</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coefficient matrix then the equations jointly contradict each other, so there are no solutions.|$|R
50|$|For a given number <b>of</b> unknowns, <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> {{solutions}} {{to a system}} of linear equations depends only on <b>the</b> <b>rank</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> matrix representing <b>the</b> system and <b>the</b> <b>rank</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> corresponding augmented matrix. Specifically, according to the Rouché-Capelli theorem, any system of linear equations is inconsistent (has no solutions) if <b>the</b> <b>rank</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> augmented matrix is greater than <b>the</b> <b>rank</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coefficient matrix; if, on <b>the</b> other hand, <b>the</b> <b>ranks</b> <b>of</b> these two matrices are equal, the system must have at least one solution. The solution is unique if and only if <b>the</b> <b>rank</b> equals <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> variables.

5|$|Range {{queries are}} also straightforward.

This count can be adjusted up or down by one according to whether the endpoints of the range should be considered to be part of the range and whether the array contains keys matching those endpoints.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with <b>the</b> <b>rank</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> matrix radius <b>of</b> <b>the</b> limiting set for a singular Hamiltonian system with one singular end point. The exact relationship between <b>the</b> <b>rank</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> matrix radius and <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> square integrable solutions is obtained and then <b>the</b> defect index <b>of</b> <b>the</b> corresponding minimal operator can be represented in terms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rank</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> matrix radius. So two results obtained by Allan M. Krall [SIAM J. Math. Anal. 20 (1989) 664] are improved. In addition, it is discussed that <b>the</b> <b>rank</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> matrix radius is independent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spectral parameter and a certain matrix. Especially, <b>the</b> classification <b>of</b> singular linear Hamiltonian systems is present and several sufficient and necessary conditions for the limit point and limit circle cases are established...|$|R
50|$|According to the Rouché-Capelli theorem, {{a system}} of {{equations}} is consistent {{if and only if}} <b>the</b> <b>rank</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coefficient matrix is equal to <b>the</b> <b>rank</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> augmented matrix (the coefficient matrix augmented with a column of intercept terms), and the system has a unique solution if and only if that common <b>rank</b> equals <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> variables. Thus with two variables the k lines in the plane, associated with a set of k equations, are concurrent if and only if <b>the</b> <b>rank</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> k × 2 coefficient matrix and <b>the</b> <b>rank</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> k × 3 augmented matrix are both 2. In that case only two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> k equations are independent, and <b>the</b> point <b>of</b> concurrency can be found by solving any two mutually independent equations simultaneously for the two variables.|$|R
