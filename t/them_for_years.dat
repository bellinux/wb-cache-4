In February 1917, 10,000 more (plus 14 assay coins) were minted, again at Philadelphia. The Association sold these {{to the public at}} $3 each, the same price at which the Louisiana Purchase pieces, which sold poorly, had been vended. The McKinley Memorial pieces were ill-publicized, and few were sold at full price. Texas coin dealer B.

5|$|While the Material Defender recovers in the Red Acropolis {{station on}} Mars, the {{director}} of the team informs him that they have been investigating PTMC, and have uncovered a conspiracy: one of her acquaintances in the PTMC was killed by a robot, and when she contacted PTMC about it, they denied having ever employed such acquaintance, even though he had worked with <b>them</b> <b>for</b> <b>years.</b> The Red Acropolis had tried to notify the Collective Earth Defense (CED), a large police group, of the PTMC's actions, but they took no action, not daring to interfere with such a powerful corporation. The director also tells the Material Defender that, while he was clearing the mines during the events of Descent II, PTMC executive Samuel Dravis was actually testing and modifying the virus and deliberately tried to kill him by overloading the warp drive on his ship. After some persuasion and offers from the director, including a new ship and an AI assistant known as the Guide-Bot, the Material Defender accepts to help the Red Acropolis stop the virus.|$|E

25|$|In the United States, {{examples}} such as {{the case}} of Kennewick Man have illustrated the tensions between Native Americans and archaeologists, which can be summarized as a conflict between a need to remain respectful toward sacred burial sites and the academic benefit from studying <b>them.</b> <b>For</b> <b>years,</b> American archaeologists dug on Indian burial grounds and other places considered sacred, removing artifacts and human remains to storage facilities for further study. In some cases human remains were not even thoroughly studied but instead archived rather than reburied. Furthermore, Western archaeologists' views of the past often {{differ from those of}} tribal peoples. The West views time as linear; for many natives, it is cyclic. From a Western perspective, the past is long-gone; from a native perspective, disturbing the past can have dire consequences in the present.|$|E
25|$|Built by the Norwegian State Railways, {{construction}} commenced in 1892 and {{was initially}} estimated {{to take one}} year. However, it took three years, largely because of inferior geological conditions, in part caused by clay in the ground. Construction did fall within the NOK750,000 budget. Of this, Brevik Municipality ended up paying NOK90,000, which would stand as a major burden for <b>them</b> <b>for</b> <b>years.</b> Export of ice for cooling was a major industry in Eidanger from the 1850s to the 1970s. There were several small dammed-up ice lakes, and four of these had to be expropriated to give way for the railway. The construction work was initially led by S. H. Strøm, and from January 1894 by M. Olsen. Surveying started in May 1894 and allowed negotiations for expropriation to commence in the fall, which lasted a half year.

500|$|While {{many fans}} were upset with this sudden change of direction, {{the album was}} {{generally}} well received by mainstream publications. Entertainment Weekly was highly positive, writing that [...] "This is the group at their best." [...] In his review of the album, Rolling Stone writer Barry Walters wrote [...] "On a Wire quivers with the anxieties that must have arisen as the Get Up Kids left behind what originally made them. Straining vocals, racing tempos and walls of distortion give way to softer singing, spacious guitars and prominent keyboards [...] [...] [...] The Get Up Kids dig deeper into themselves. What they find is often subtle, less visceral but far more tender." [...] The poor public reception of the album had a larger impact on the band's popularity as a whole. The band embarked on a tour to promote the album in the late spring soon after the album was released, {{only to find that}} they had far less support from both their fans and their record label. Using the financial and critical success of Something to Write Home About, Vagrant signed several other headlining emo bands such as Alkaline Trio, Dashboard Confessional, and Saves the Day. The Get Up Kids were no longer the label's top priority, and certainly not after the lukewarm reception of On a Wire. In an interview with Alternative Press, lead singer Matt Pryor considered the dramatic change in style on On a Wire seriously dented the momentum the band had built up since Something to Write Home About, allowing later bands such as Dashboard Confessional to take much of the fan base that The Get Up Kids had previously earned. In an interview, Pryor confessed that he did not think that [...] "anyone, including Vagrant, gave that record a chance". Even though they had avoided the term since its inception, it was at this point the band actively began trying to shed the term [...] "emo", a word that had defined <b>them</b> <b>for</b> <b>years</b> but had come to be associated with more pop-oriented acts. Pryor commented on the album, saying [...] "We really didn't give two shits if anyone liked the record or not, we were really confident {{that we were going to}} kill this 'emo' stigma that we had and take the people with open minds with us and leave everyone else in the dust." ...|$|E
