5|$|As stated above, the exosome complex {{contains}} many proteins with ribonuclease domains. The {{exact nature of}} these ribonuclease domains has changed across evolution from bacterial to archaeal to eukaryotic complexes as various activities have been gained and lost. The exosome is primarily a 3'-5' exoribonuclease, meaning that it degrades RNA molecules from their 3' end. Exoribonucleases contained in exosome complexes are either phosphorolytic (the RNase PH-like proteins) or, in eukaryotes, hydrolytic (the RNase R and RNase D domain proteins). The phosphorolytic enzymes use inorganic phosphate to cleave the phosphodiester bonds - releasing nucleotide diphosphates. The hydrolytic enzymes use water <b>to</b> <b>hydrolyse</b> these bonds - releasing nucleotide monophosphates.|$|E
5|$|The {{second most}} studied triad is the Cysteine-Histidine-Aspartate motif. Several {{families}} of cysteine proteases use this triad set, for example TEV protease and papain. The triad acts similarly to serine protease triads, {{with a few}} notable differences. Due to cysteine's low pKa, {{the importance of the}} Asp to catalysis varies and several cysteine proteases are effectively Cys-His dyads (e.g. hepatitis A virus protease), whilst in others the cysteine is already deprotonated before catalysis begins (e.g. papain). This triad is also used by some amidases, such as N-glycanase <b>to</b> <b>hydrolyse</b> non-peptide C-N bonds.|$|E
5|$|Thorium {{is rather}} active chemically. Owing {{to lack of}} {{electrons}} on 6d and 5f orbitals, the tetravalent thorium compounds are colorless. At pH < 3, the solutions of thorium salts are dominated by the cations 4+. The Th4+ ion is relatively large, and depending on the coordination number can have a radius between 0.95 and 1.14 Å. As a result, thorium salts have a weak tendency <b>to</b> <b>hydrolyse.</b> The distinctive ability of thorium salts is their high solubility, not only in water, but also in polar organic solvents.|$|E

5|$|The Serine-Histidine-Aspartate motif {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{thoroughly}} characterised catalytic motifs in biochemistry. The triad is exemplified by chymotrypsin, a model serine protease from the PA superfamily which uses its triad <b>to</b> <b>hydrolyse</b> protein backbones. The aspartate is hydrogen bonded to the histidine, increasing the pKa of its imidazole nitrogen from 7 to around 12. This allows the histidine to act as a powerful general base and to activate the serine nucleophile. It also has an oxyanion hole consisting of several backbone amides which stabilises charge build-up on intermediates. The histidine base aids the first leaving group by donating a proton, and also activates the hydrolytic water substrate by abstracting a proton as the remaining OH− attacks the acyl-enzyme intermediate.|$|E
25|$|Ionic liquids {{are often}} {{moderate}} to poor conductors of electricity, non-ionizing (e.g., non-polar), highly viscous and frequently exhibit low vapor pressure. Their other properties are diverse: many have low combustibility, are thermally stable, with wide liquid regions, and favorable solvating properties {{for a range}} of polar and non-polar compounds. Many classes of chemical reactions, such as Diels-Alder reactions and Friedel-Crafts reactions, can be performed using ionic liquids as solvents. IL's can serve as solvents for biocatalysis. The miscibility of ionic liquids with water or organic solvents varies with side chain lengths on the cation and with choice of anion. They can be functionalized to act as acids, bases, or ligands, and are precursors salts in the preparation of stable carbenes. They have recently been found <b>to</b> <b>hydrolyse,</b> affording acidic or basic media in the aqueous milieu. Because of their distinctive properties, ionic liquids are attracting increasing attention in many fields, including organic chemistry, electrochemistry, catalysis, physical chemistry, and engineering; see for instance magnetic ionic liquid.|$|E

[...] Bacterial and fungal proteases {{are particularly important}} to the global carbon and nitrogen cycles in the recycling of proteins, and such activity tends to be regulated [...] by nutritional signals in these organisms.

2500|$|An amylase (...) is {{an enzyme}} that catalyses the {{hydrolysis}} of starch into sugars. Amylase {{is present in}} the saliva of humans and some other mammals, where it begins the chemical process of digestion. Foods that contain large amounts of starch but little sugar, such as rice and potatoes, may acquire a slightly sweet taste as they are chewed because amylase degrades some of their starch into sugar. The pancreas and salivary gland make amylase (alpha amylase) <b>to</b> <b>hydrolyse</b> dietary starch into disaccharides and trisaccharides which are converted by other enzymes to glucose to supply the body with energy. Plants and some bacteria also produce amylase. As diastase, amylase was the first enzyme to be discovered and isolated (by Anselme Payen in 1833). [...] Specific amylase proteins are designated by different Greek letters. All amylases are glycoside hydrolases and act on α-1,4-glycosidic bonds.|$|E
2500|$|Large {{coordination}} {{numbers are}} the rule: thorium nitrate pentahydrate {{was the first}} known example of coordination number 11, the oxalate tetrahydrate has coordination number 10, and the [...] anion in the calcium and magnesium salts is 12-coordinate. Due to the large size of the Th4+ cation, thorium salts have a weaker tendency <b>to</b> <b>hydrolyse</b> than that of many multiply charged ions such as Fe3+, but hydrolysis happens more readily at pH above 4, forming various polymers of unknown nature, culminating {{in the formation of}} the gelatinous hydroxide: this behaviour is similar to that of protactinium, which also hydrolyses readily in water to form colloidal precipitates. The distinctive ability of thorium salts is their high solubility, not only in water, but also in polar organic solvents. As a hard Lewis acid, Th4+ favours hard ligands with oxygen atoms as donors: complexes with sulfur atoms as donors are less stable.|$|E
2500|$|Spanish or Sevillian type (olives with fermentation): Most {{commonly}} {{applied to}} green olive preparation, around 60% {{of all the}} world's table olives are produced with this method. Olives are soaked in lye (dilute NaOH, 2–4%) for 8–10 hours <b>to</b> <b>hydrolyse</b> the oleuropein. They are usually considered [...] "treated" [...] when the lye has penetrated {{two-thirds of the way}} into the fruit. They are then washed once or several times in water to remove the caustic solution and transferred to fermenting vessels full of brine at typical concentrations of 8–12% NaCl. The brine is changed on a regular basis to help remove the phenolic compounds. Fermentation is carried out by the natural microbiota present on the olives that survive the lye treatment process. Many organisms are involved, usually reflecting the local conditions or [...] "Terroir" [...] of the olives. During a typical fermentation gram-negative enterobacteria flourish in small numbers at first, but are rapidly outgrown by lactic acid bacteria species such as Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus brevis and Pediococcus damnosus. These bacteria produce lactic acid to help lower the pH of the brine and therefore stabilize the product against unwanted pathogenic species. A diversity of yeasts then accumulate in sufficient numbers to help complete the fermentation alongside the lactic acid bacteria. Yeasts commonly mentioned include the teleomorphs Pichia anomala, Pichia membranifaciens, Debaryomyces hansenii and Kluyveromyces marxianus. Once fermented, the olives are placed in fresh brine and acid corrected, to be ready for market.|$|E
