500|$|To {{calm the}} indignation of Vicente Romualdez, Eduardo and Danieling {{exercised}} their {{political and economic}} influence to find work for Imelda in the Central Bank where she worked in the Intelligence Division under Braulio Hipuna, the Chief Clerk of the Intelligence Division.

According to Susie Abadilla, who took the same vocal sessions together with Imelda, she was not so friendly, and the reason presumably stemmed from the strict and busy routines back then, and her reluctance <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>her</b> family and her past.
