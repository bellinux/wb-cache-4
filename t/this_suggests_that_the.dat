5|$|In {{the early}} days of the colony, the land between Iron Cove and the Cooks River was known as the Kangaroo Ground. <b>This</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> land was open terrain favoured by kangaroos, that they were common in the area and may have formed a {{significant}} part of the Aboriginal diet.|$|E
5|$|Most {{aftershocks}} {{occurred at}} significantly greater depths than the mainshock and {{are dominated by}} strike-slip focal mechanisms. <b>This</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> mainshock triggered later movement on {{a complex set of}} right and left lateral strike-slip faults within the basement, together accommodating north-south shortening beneath the Hormuz salt layer.|$|E
5|$|Pterobranchs {{may be a}} {{sub-group}} of enteropneusts ("acorn worms"). <b>This</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ancestral deuterostome {{looks more}} like a mobile worm-like enteropneust than a sessile colonial pterobranch. The fact that lophophorates and pterobranchs both use tentacles for feeding is probably not a synapomorphy of lophophorates and deuterostomes, but evolved independently as convergent adaptations to a sessile lifestyle.|$|E

5|$|The K'iche' conquest {{appears to}} have taken place around AD1000, some four centuries earlier than had been {{supposed}} using calculations based on the indigenous accounts. After the initial arrival of the K'iche' activity continued at the site without pause, and the local styles were simply replaced by styles associated with the conquerors. <b>This</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> original inhabitants abandoned the city they had occupied for almost two millennia.|$|E
5|$|A 2011 genetic {{study showed}} that two {{examined}} specimens of the Columbian mammoth were grouped within a subclade of woolly mammoths. <b>This</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> two populations interbred and produced fertile offspring. A North American type formerly referred to as M. jeffersonii may be a hybrid between the two species. A 2015 study suggested that the animals in the range where M. columbi and M. primigenius overlapped formed a metapopulation of hybrids with varying morphology. It also suggested that Eurasian M. primigenius had a similar relationship with M. trogontherii, in areas where their range overlapped.|$|E
5|$|Another {{issue is}} the role of {{inherited}} genetic factors in shaping attachments: for example one type of polymorphism of the gene coding for the D2 dopamine receptor has been linked to anxious attachment and another in the gene for the 5-HT2A serotonin receptor with avoidant attachment. <b>This</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> influence of maternal care on attachment security is not the same for all children. One theoretical basis for this is that it makes biological sense for children to vary in their susceptibility to rearing influence.|$|E

5|$|Harvey {{also noted}} that the fatwa covered a wide range of Islamic {{religious}} duties, while usually a responsum fatwa only addresses a specific enquiry on a difficult point of detail. The fatwa also went into specific practical challenges faced by Muslims in Spain, such as the pressure to curse Muhammad, eat pork, drink wine, and intermarry with the Christians. <b>This</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> author had some knowledge of what life under Christian rule was like.|$|E
5|$|The {{evolution}} of TBR1 {{has been studied}} in amphioxi, also known as lancelets. A T-box-containing cDNA was isolated in the lancelet Branchiostoma belcheri and found to possess a T-domain orthologous {{to that of the}} T-Brain subfamily of T-box genes, specifically TBR1. However, lancelets lack a true brain and no TBR1 transcripts were found in the neural tissue of the lancelet. <b>This</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> neuronal role of TBR1 evolved in vertebrates after the lancelet lineage had already diverged from that of vertebrates.|$|E
5|$|The rate of star {{formation}} in the Milky Way is much higher, with Andromeda Galaxy producing only about one solar mass per year compared to 3–5 solar masses for the Milky Way. The rate of supernovae in the Milky Way is also double that of Andromeda Galaxy. <b>This</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> latter once experienced a great {{star formation}} phase, but {{is now in a}} relative state of quiescence, whereas the Milky Way is experiencing more active star formation. Should this continue, the luminosity in the Milky Way may eventually overtake that of Andromeda Galaxy.|$|E

5|$|Tyrannosaurus {{had very}} large {{olfactory}} bulbs and olfactory nerves {{relative to their}} brain size, the organs responsible for {{a heightened sense of}} smell. <b>This</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> sense of smell was highly developed, and implies that tyrannosaurs could detect carcasses by scent alone across great distances. The sense of smell in tyrannosaurs may have been comparable to modern vultures, which use scent to track carcasses for scavenging. Research on the olfactory bulbs has shown that Tyrannosaurus rex had the most highly developed sense of smell of 21 sampled non-avian dinosaur species.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{presence}} of an embryo per se would be equivocal regarding this issue, the conditions in which the embryo were preserved provide strong evidence that Dinocephalosaurus was viviparous. There is no preserved calcified eggshell surrounding the embryo, despite {{the presence}} of delicately-preserved calcified elements from other animals at Luoping. This is consistent with the eggshells surrounding the embryos of viviparous reptiles being non-calcified membranes. Furthermore, the relative proportions of the humerus and the fibula in the embryo, compared with the maternal individual and IVPP V13898 from Panxian, indicate that the embryo is around 12% of the size of its mother. Combined with its ossified bones, <b>this</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> embryo was at an advanced developmental stage, whereas crocodilians, birds, turtles, and tuataras lay eggs at very early developmental stages.|$|E
5|$|Antiquarians {{and historians}} have been {{interested}} in the ditch since the 19th century, but much of its course has been built over. Between 1990 and 1997, the University of Manchester Archaeological Unit excavated sections of the ditch in Denton, Reddish, Levenshulme and Platt Fields, in an attempt to determine its age and purpose. Although no date was established for the ditch's construction, the investigations revealed that the bank {{to the north of the}} ditch is of 20th century origin. Together with the ditch's profile, which is U-shaped rather than the V-shape typically used in military ditches and defences, <b>this</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> purpose of the earthwork was to mark a territorial boundary. The conclusion of the project was that the ditch was probably a boundary marker.|$|E

5|$|BF4 forms a {{colourless}} centrosymmetric monoclinic crystal {{belonging to}} the P21/c space group, and with a density of 1.486gcm−3. Looking at the ORTEP diagram {{of the structure of}} the cation (at right), it is evident that it possesses the typical geometry expected of a rhodocene or rhodocenium cation. The two cyclopentadienyl rings are close to parallel (the centroid–Rh–centroid angle is 177.2°) and the rhodium centre is slightly closer to the substituted cyclopentadienyl ring (Rh–centroid distances are 1.819Å and 1.795Å), an observation attributed to the greater inductive effect of the tert-butyl groups on the substituted ligand. The ORTEP diagram shows that the cation adopts an eclipsed conformation in the solid state. The crystal structure of the hexafluorophosphate salt shows three crystallographically independent cations, one eclipsed, one staggered, and one which is rotationally disordered. <b>This</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> conformation adopted is dependent on the anion present and also that the energy barrier to rotation is low – in ferrocene, the rotational energy barrier is known to be ~5kJmol−1 in both solution and gas phase.|$|E
5|$|Coprinellus micaceus has a {{cosmopolitan}} distribution, {{and has been}} collected in northern Africa, South Africa, Europe (including Turkey), North America (as far north as Alaska), the Hawaiian islands, South America, India, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan. Phylogenetic analysis of rDNA sequences from specimens collected in southeastern Asia and Hawaii show that the Hawaiian species form a distinct clade with little genetic diversity compared to Asian populations; <b>this</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Hawaiian populations have been introduced relatively recently and have not had much time to develop genetic variation. One study suggests that in South Africa, where C.micaceus is rare, it has been frequently confused with the similar-appearing C.truncorum, a more common species in that region. A similar inference has been raised about North American species.|$|E
5|$|Fossil {{tracks are}} rare and no burrows under the sea-floor {{have so far}} {{been found in the}} Burgess Shale. These {{absences}} have been used to support the idea that the water near the sea-floor was anoxic. However {{it is possible that the}} water just above the sea-floor was oxygenated while the water in the sediment below it was anoxic, and also possible that there simply were no deep-burrowing animals in the Burgess Shale. Some fossils, such as Marrella, are almost always the right way up, which suggests they were not transported far if at all. Others, such as Wiwaxia, are often at odd angles, and some fossils of animals with shelly or toughened components very rarely contain remains of soft tissues. <b>This</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> distances over which corpses were transported may have varied between genera, although most were buried where they had lived.|$|E

5|$|Hale–Bopp was {{the first}} comet where the noble gas argon was detected. Noble gases are {{chemically}} inert and highly volatile, and since different noble elements have different sublimation temperatures, {{they can be used}} for probing the temperature histories of the cometary ices. Krypton has a sublimation temperature of 16–20K and was found to be depleted more than 25 times relative to the solar abundance, while argon with its higher sublimation temperature was enriched relative to the solar abundance. Together these observations indicate that the interior of Hale–Bopp has always been colder than 35–40K, but has at some point been warmer than 20K. Unless the solar nebula was much colder and richer in argon than generally believed, <b>this</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> comet formed beyond Neptune in the Kuiper belt region and then migrated outward to the Oort cloud.|$|E
5|$|In August 937, Olaf {{crossed the}} Irish Sea with his army {{to join forces}} with Constantine and Owen and in Livingston's opinion <b>this</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> battle of Brunanburh {{occurred}} in early October of that year. According to Paul Cavill, the invading armies raided Mercia, from which Æthelstan obtained Saxon troops as he travelled north to meet them. Michael Wood wrote that no source mentions any intrusion into Mercia. John of Worcester wrote that the invaders entered via the Humber but no other chronicler mentioned this. Because {{of the lack of}} sources supporting the claim, along with other issues, philologist Paul Cavill argues John's statement is not true. According to Symeon of Durham, Olaf had 615 ships but this number is likely exaggerated.|$|E
5|$|In another study, {{students}} who read less-organized material performed better that students given organized material on tasks that required {{an application of}} the knowledge to problem-solving. <b>This</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> inclusion of seductive details might be beneficial for transfer performance but detrimental when trainees are recalling information. Interference from seductive details creates confusion of what the core material is and, therefore, the recall {{will not be as}} good and more errors will occur. This distortion can lead to a richer understanding of the material and facilitate transfer performance because trainees are required to form a macro structure of the instructional material. Research using the dual-coding paradigm also suggests that interesting and engaging information promotes image-based thoughts and leads to deeper processing of information because it allows storage of material in both verbal and nonverbal systems. When information is made easier to comprehend, material is processed less deeply, thus leading to poorer acquisition of information.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{studies have}} shown that certain {{dinoflagellates}} produce sterols <b>that</b> have <b>the</b> potential to serve as genera-specific biomarkers.
