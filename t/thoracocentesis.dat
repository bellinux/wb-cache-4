40|$|Background: Ultrasound (US) {{guidance}} is advocated {{to reduce}} complications from <b>thoracocentesis</b> or intercostal catheter (ICC) insertion. Although imaging of the intercostal artery (ICA) with Doppler US has been reported, current thoracic guidelines do not advocate this, and bleeding from a lacerated ICA {{continues to be}} a rare but serious complication of <b>thoracocentesis</b> or ICC insertion. Objectives: It was the aim of this study to describe a method to visualise the ICA at routine US-guided <b>thoracocentesis</b> and map its course across the posterior chest wall. Method: The ICA was imaged in 22 patients undergoing US-guided <b>thoracocentesis,</b> at 4 positions across the back to the axilla. Its location, relative to the overlying rib, was calculated as the fraction of the intercostal space (ICS) below the inferior border of that rib. Results: An ICA was identified in 74 of 88 positions examined. The ICA migrated from a central 2 ̆ 7 vulnerable 2 ̆ 7 location within the ICS near the spine (0. 28, range 0. 21 - 0. 38; p < 0. 001) towards the overlying rib (0. 08, range 0. 05 - 0. 11; p < 0. 001) in the axilla. Conclusions: The ICA can be visualised with US and is more exposed centrally within the ICS in more posterior positions; however, there is a marked variation between individuals, such that the ICA may lie exposed in the ICS even as far lateral as the axilla. Future studies need to identify which patients are at risk for a 2 ̆ 7 low-lying 2 ̆ 7 ICA to further define the role of US imaging of the ICA during <b>thoracocentesis</b> or ICC insertion.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} prenatal therapeutic interventions on perinatal outcome in pregnancies complicated by isolated fetal hydrothorax with hydrops. METHODS: A systematic {{review of the literature}} from January 1982 to January 2006 of perinatal outcome in pregnancies with isolated fetal hydrothorax with hydrops with any form of prenatal treatment was conducted. RESULTS: Forty-four articles met our selection criteria, reporting a total of 172 fetuses treated prenatally. Reported treatment options were single (n = 13) or serial <b>thoracocentesis</b> (n = 18), thoraco-amniotic shunt placement (n = 100) or a combination of <b>thoracocentesis</b> and shunting (n = 36). Four case-reports described pleurodesis with OK- 432, (n = 3) and intrapleural injection of autologous blood (n = 2). Overall survival rate was 63 %, ranging from 54 % for single <b>thoracocentesis</b> to 80 % in the 5 cases treated with pleurodesis, without statistically significant differences between the treatment modalities. Shunt-placement with or without prior <b>thoracocentesis</b> was most often described, with survival rates of 67 and 61 % respectively. DISCUSSION: The available literature consists exclusively of case reports and case series. This systematic review suggests that with prenatal intervention, perinatal survival rates around 63 % are possible. There is a need for prospective, adequately controlled studies with long-term follow-up to determine the best treatment and more reliable outcome data in pregnancies complicated by fetal hydrothorax with hydrops. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Background : Determining the pleural PH and PCo 2 {{could be}} helpful in {{differential}} diagnosis of pleural effusion. Usually pleural fluid PH and Pco 2 are measured immediately following the <b>thoracocentesis</b> and in case of any delay samples will be preserved on ice, meanwhile, PH could be remained unchanged under special situations in vivo and at room temperature. The present {{study was conducted with}} the aim of determining the changes in pleural PH, Po 2, PCo 2, and HCo 3 immediately following the <b>thoracocentesis</b> and one hour later at room temperature. Materials and methods : For this descriptive study, 84 patients with pleural effusion referring to Shaheed Beheshti Hospital in Kashan were included. Pleural aspiration was carried out in sitting position, then samples were examined for pleural PH, Po 2, PCo 2, and HCo 3. To differentiate transudate and exudate blood samples were also obtained. Results: There {{was no significant difference between}} PH and Hco 3 of samples immediately obtained following the <b>thoracocentesis</b> and one hour later, however this difference was observed in Po 2. Of 84 patients, 33 had transudative pleural effusion, whereas the remaining 51 had exudative pleural effusion. Among transudative pleural effusion PH, PCo 2, and Po 2 were significantly differed between T 0 and T 60, however this significant relation was not found in HCo 3. Among exudative patients we have found significant association between Po 2 T 0 and Po 2 T 60. Conclusion : The pleural fluid PH, PCo 2, and HCo 3 of samples kept at room temperature does not change significantly during the first hour following the <b>thoracocentesis.</b> Po 2 is increased in transudative and exudative pleural effusion within the first hour following the <b>thoracocentesis.</b> Meanwhile, changes in PH, Po 2, and PCo 2 of transudate samples were more than exudate samples...|$|E

40|$|Background: Invasive {{practical}} procedures require {{identification of}} surface anatomical landmarks to reduce {{risk of damage}} to other structures. Needle <b>thoracocentesis</b> has specific complications, which have been previously documented. An observational study was performed among emergency physicians to name the landmark for needle <b>thoracocentesis</b> and identify this point on a human volunteer as per Advanced Trauma and Life Support (ATLS) guidelines. Results: A cohort of 25 emergency physicians was studied, 21 (84 %) of which were ATLS certified. The correct landmark was named by 22 (88 %). Only 15 (60 %) correctly identified the second intercostal space on the human volunteer, all placing the needle medial to the midclavicular line, {{with a range of}} 3 cm. Two (8 %) named and identified the site of needle pericardiocentesis; one (4 %) named and identified the fifth intercostal space in the anterior axillary line. Discussion: These results demonstrate a low accuracy among emergency physicians in identifying correct landmarks for needle <b>thoracocentesis</b> under elective conditions.

30|$|Physicians {{also must}} {{recognise}} that coagulation tests {{are not well}} correlated {{to the risk of}} bleeding. In a recent meta-analysis of 25 studies, Segal et al. have shown that the risk of bleeding during different procedures (angiography, liver biopsy, <b>thoracocentesis,</b> bronchoscopy, liver laparoscopy, etc.) was similar for patients with normal and abnormal coagulation [45].|$|E

30|$|Most current {{guidelines}} recommend that, whenever possible, <b>thoracocentesis</b> {{should be}} performed under US guidance [210], {{as the number of}} complications is markedly reduced compared with conventional <b>thoracocentesis.</b> US-guided trans-thoracic biopsy of peripheral pulmonary lesions is now routinely employed [211 – 232]. So is LUS for ruling out pneumothorax after invasive procedures such as biopsy, drainage or placement of central venous catheters [233 – 238]. In trauma patients with pneumothorax, LUS quantification {{of the size of the}} pneumothorax can be used to predict whether removal of the chest tube can be performed safely or whether chest drainage should continue [106]. As an adjunct before thoracic surgery, LUS of the areas where the surgeon is expected to make an incision can diagnose and rule out pleural adhesions. If lung sliding is present, there are no pleural adhesions in the intended surgical site. If no lung sliding is present, adhesions should be suspected and the incision {{should be performed}} elsewhere [239]. Lung recruitment following positive end-expiratory pressure can be assessed with LUS [158, 178]. In a small study, LUS quantification of aeration changes during a trial of spontaneous breathing seemed to be able to predict post-extubation distress [240].|$|E
