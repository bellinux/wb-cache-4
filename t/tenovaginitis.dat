5000|$|M. gallisepticum causes {{respiratory}} infection in turkeys which can induce sinusitis, pneumonia, and airsacculitis. With infectious sinusitis, {{the birds have}} symptoms of coughing, swollen sinuses, nasal and ocular discharge, tracheal rales, labored breathing, impaired vision, depression and weight loss. The disease can even cause death and found to especially occur if combined with E. coli. Outbreaks in turkeys occur {{at an early age}} usually between 8 and 15 weeks and about 90% of birds show signs. With breeding females, there could be a decline in egg production. [...] "Occasionally an encephalitic form is seen in growing birds. A <b>tenovaginitis</b> may also develop and the organism {{can be found in the}} oviduct and semen of infected male birds, leading to infection in the egg and eventually of the young poulty." ...|$|E

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{observe the}} {{therapeutic}} effect {{and safety of}} using the hooked needle-shaped knife to treat the stenosing <b>tenovaginitis</b> of flexor digitorum. MethodsSixty outpatients were divided into a treatment group of 30 cases treated by using the hooked needle-shaped knife, and a control group of 30 cases treated by block therapy. 6 months later, the alleviation of pain in the affected finger during movement, under pressure, traction and finger-bending anti-resistance was compared before and after treatment. ResultsThe alleviation of pain during movement, under pressure, traction and finger-bending anti-resistance was much better in the treatment group {{than that of the}} control group (P < 0. 01), with a effective rate of 93. 3 % in the treatment group and 80. 0 % in the control group (P < 0. 01). ConclusionThe micro-wound technique using the hooked needle-shaped knife has definite effect and safety for stenosing <b>tenovaginitis</b> of flexor digitorum...|$|E
40|$|Anomalous {{muscles are}} often a matter of concern to clinicians as they mislead the diagnosis. Knowledge of such variant muscles is {{important}} clinically to avoid misdiagnosis. In this report we present an anomalous muscle on the dorsum of hand, extensor digitorum brevis manus an uncommon variation present as a swelling on the dorsum. It is originated from the dorsal wrist capsule within the compartment deep to the extensor retinaculum for the extensor digitorum and inserted into the extensor hood of the index finger, this variant muscle often cause dorsal wrist pain and often confused as ganglion, soft tissue tumor, synovial cyst or <b>tenovaginitis.</b> The presence of such variant muscles on dorsum of hand, their clinical significance and literature has been reviewed...|$|E
40|$|An {{isolated}} constriction of the {{tendon sheath}} of extensor digiti minimi caused triggering {{of the little}} finger. Incision of the tendon sheath resulted in recovery of frictionless gliding of the tendon. Journal of Hand Surgery (British and European Volume, 1994) 19 B: 5 : 662 - 663 Trigger finger results from loss of smooth gliding of a tendon within its sheath. Stenosing <b>tenovaginitis</b> has numerous causes including inflammatory processes (Froimson, 1992; Pruzansky 1988), tumours (Oni, 1984), metabolic abnormalities, mild repetitive occu-pational disorders, tendon lacerations (Frewin and Scheker, 1989) and sports related trauma. These con-ditions result in flexor tendon sheath abnormalities. Triggering because of flexor tendon sheath constric-tions is common (Thorpe, 1988), and although trig-gering of extensor tendons is mentioned in textbooks we {{have been unable to}} find any documented cases i...|$|E
40|$|Twelve {{cases of}} stenosing <b>tenovaginitis</b> at the radial styloid process (de Quervain's disease), {{including}} two bilateral cases, are reviewed. These patients presented the typical symptoms of pain just proximal to the radial styloid process accompanied by limitation of abduction of the thumb. Many previous reports {{have emphasized the}} frequency of aberrant tendons in this region and have implied that such anomalies may {{play a part in}} the etiology of this disorder. In our cases aberrant tendons were not found. Pronounced thickening of the tendon sheaths was present at operation and accumulations of fluid resembling ganglion formation were frequently noticed. All forms of therapy except surgical excision of the involved tendon sheaths were largely ineffective. This surgical procedure was so simple and satisfactory that it is recommended as the treatment of choice. The diagnosis of de Quervain's disease is easily missed unless the examining physician constantly keeps it in mind...|$|E
40|$|Trigger finger is a stenosing <b>tenovaginitis</b> {{in which}} there is a {{constriction}} of the annular sheath associated with a nodule in the digital flexor tendon. Clinically this can present as triggering or snapping of the nodule as it passes through the tight constricting tendon sheath. Although many triggering fingers settle spontaneously, and others respond to local anaesthestic and steroid injec-tion, others require surgical decompression. The association between diabetes and trigger finger, although not widely known, has been described and forms part of the "diabetic hand syndrome". We studied 100 adult patients in the group that required surgery. Eighteen of the 100 patients were diabetic with six insulin dependent diabetics (IDDM) and 12 non-insulin dependent diabetics (NIDDM). In the current climate of day case surgery this has significant implications both for the management of known diabetics as well as the preoperative detection of those with the condition. Journal of Hand Surgery (British and European Volume, 1996) 2 lB. " 2. " 244 - 245 The association between diabetes and trigger finger, although previously suspected, was probably first con-firmed by Strom in 1977, and later by Benedetti et al (1982) and Yosipovitch et al (1990).

40|$|Trigger finger is a {{term for}} stenosing <b>tenovaginitis</b> {{affecting}} the excursion of the long flexor of the hand at the area of zone II of the digit. Steroid injection {{is one of the}} treatment option. Triamcinolone is the steroid mainly used for trigger finger treatment. Hydrocortisone is used only in paeditric trigger finger. Therefore result and outcome of hydrocortisone in treatment of adult trigger finger still not establish. PURPOSE: This study was designed to test the null hypothesis that there is no difference in resolution of trigger finger in term of pain, tenderness and triggering/locking in 3 months after injection with triamcinolone, a depot form of potent steroid or hydrocortisone, a highly soluble form but less potent steroid. METHODS: Seventy patients were enrolled in a prospective randomized controlled study comparing triamcinolone and hydrocortisone injection for idiopathic trigger finger. They were randomized into two groups; triamcinolone group and hydrocortisone group. All patients required to answer DASH questionnaire, give VAS score and evaluated for triggering/locking and tenderness at A 1 pulley before injection, immediately after injection and 3 months after injection. Fifty-nine patients completed the 3 months follow-up (28 triamcinolone arm, 31 dexamethasone arm). Outcome measures included the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) questionnaire, presence/absence of triggering/locking finger, presence/absence of A 1 pulley tenderness and pains severity base on visual analog scale. A Chi-square test and student t-test were used to compare both groups. RESULTS: Immediately after injection, absence of triggering was documented in 24 of 34 patients (70. 6 %) in the triamcinolone group and in 28 of 36 patients (77. 8 %) in the hydrocortisone group. The rates of resolution of triggering 3 months after injection were 22 of 28 (78. 6 %) in the triamcinolone group and 26 of 31 (83. 9 %) in the hydrocortisone group. In term of tenderness of A 1 pulley, immediately after injection, absence of tenderness was documented in 26 of 34 patients (76. 5 %) in the triamcinolone group and in 28 of 36 patients (77. 8 %) in the hydrocortisone group. The rates of resolution of tenderness 3 months after injection were 18 of 28 (64. 3 %) in the triamcinolone group and 22 of 31 (71 %) in the hydrocortisone group. There {{were no significant differences between}} Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand scores and Visual Analog Scale score for pain immediately after injection and the 3 -month follow-up. After the close of the study, there was no complication in both treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: There is no significant different in term of resolution of tenderness over A 1 pulley, resolution triggering/locking, pain and physical disabilities score improvement between the two types of steroid injection...|$|E
