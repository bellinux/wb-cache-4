5|$|Following {{his success}} in Sydney, Jackson was tapped to direct the audio design and {{production}} at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, where he directed the opening ceremony and the closing ceremony. His sound design for BC Place Stadium did not have loudspeakers at ground level aimed up at the seating areas—Jackson determined that this approach would produce too much uncontrolled reverberation from sound waves bouncing off the ceiling. Instead, he configured two rings of loudspeakers {{hung from the ceiling}} 100ft (30m) above the ground, aimed downward. The inner ring held 8 arrays each composed of 12 Clair Brothers i3 line array speakers and the outer ring held 12 arrays of 7 Clair Brothers i3 line array speakers, augmented by 16 subwoofers. The lot was powered by 160 Lab.gruppen amplifiers which were also hung from the ceiling, and were networked via Dante in a triple-redundant configuration. Two DiGiCo D5 digital mixing consoles served as main and backup for the main audience sound, and two Yamaha PM1Ds handled main and backup duties for monitor mixing. Other equipment included dual-redundant Optocore fibre connections, two Dolby Lake Processors, and <b>time</b> <b>code</b> generated by two pairs of Fairlights which also handled audio cues timed to the action on the field.|$|E

40|$|Space <b>Time</b> <b>Coding</b> is a {{communication}} technique for wireless systems that employs multiple transmit antennas {{in addition to}} multiple receiver antennas. This is becoming a compulsory technology to reduce the operating region of signal to noise ratios. With the ever increasing demand for high data rate, these systems need to be implemented under frequency selective fading conditions, sometimes subject to severe Inter Symbol Interference (ISI). Therefore finding a means to use the existing Space <b>Time</b> <b>Codes</b> which were originally designed for frequency nonselective channels is essential. The real usage of these codes depends on the channel state information available at the receiver side for the decoding. Therefore channel estimation plays a vital role and finding a better method for channel estimation is an important problem. The use of Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) together with Space <b>Time</b> <b>Codes</b> makes the frequency selective channels frequency nonselective due to the increased symbol duration of the OFDM symbols. Channel estimation could be done using several methods. Least Square (LS) Error based channel estimation and Minimum Mean square Error (MMSE) based channel estimation {{are some of the}} available channel estimation methods for Space <b>Time</b> <b>Coded</b> OFDM systems. MMSE estimation is more complex than LS but superior in performance. In this thesis we evaluate the performance and complexity of LS and MMSE channel estimation methods for Space <b>Time</b> <b>Coded</b> OFDM systems. This also considers the application of MMSE based channel estimation method to different Space <b>Time</b> <b>Codes</b> with different modulation schemes. The performance of this channel estimation method and the state of system complexity in the above mentioned situations were also evaluated. We have also considered a low complexity Eigen Vector Decomposition based channel estimation method. The performance of the system was simulated with two transmit and two receive antennas. It has been clearly shown that the MMSE channel estimation method performs better with higher number of states in the Space <b>Time</b> <b>Codes</b> and with higher modulation schemes. The Eigen Vector Decomposition base channel estimation brings a low complexity solution...|$|R

Kesha, seen in a ponytail wearing gray and black makeup, chains, ripped stockings, and a sparkly one-piece leotard made of shards of broken glass, walks through the 2nd Street Tunnel with fellow partygoers. The scene features drag races and explosions in the background. Close-up shots of Kesha show her wearing studs in her eyebrows and her glittery eye makeup. As cars zoom by, the video transitions into a new location at a different party. Midway through the party Kesha changes outfits to an American-flag top and pink hot pants. As the song's hook kicks in, Kesha is seen standing {{on the edge of}} a building; the music stops and Kesha stage jumps backwards off of the building's rooftop. She is caught by the partygoers beneath her and the music resumes. The final scenes show Kesha dancing among fellow partygoers on a rooftop and smiling while singing [...] "We R Who We R". Jocelyn Vena from MTV News noted that the video makes a departure from Kesha's previous music videos, in which humor is usually present; she wrote the video shows a [...] "darker and sexier" [...] side of the songstress. Tanner Stransky from Entertainment Weekly was positive in his review of the video.
