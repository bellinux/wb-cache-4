5|$|On 13 February 2006, Lawrence and Rush, {{the first}} of the nine to face sentencing, were sentenced to life imprisonment. The next day, Czugaj and Stephens were sentenced to life imprisonment, and the group ringleaders, Chan and Sukumaran, were sentenced to death by firing squad, the first ever death {{sentences}} imposed by the Denpasar District Court. The other three, Norman, Chen and Nguyen, were all sentenced to life imprisonment on 15 February 2006. On 26 April 2006, Lawrence, Nguyen, Chen, and Norman appealed and had <b>their</b> <b>sentences</b> reduced to 20 years, while the life sentences for Czugaj and Stephens were upheld. Prosecutors launched appeals against the changes in <b>their</b> <b>sentences.</b>|$|E

5|$|Patton did {{not stop}} with the {{juvenile}} justice system, however. He encouraged passage of a bill that required that violent offenders serve at least 85percent of <b>their</b> <b>sentences</b> (up from the 50percent previously mandated), while requiring that judges consider home incarceration for first-time, non-violent offenders. The bill also allowed judges to sentence criminals to life without parole; previously, life without parole for 25years had been the harshest non-capital sentence. The bill passed the legislature in 1999.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of a {{quantitative}} study conducted in Sydney that investigated subjective reactions to an appearance before the NSW Children’s Court. A total of 206 young people were interviewed following <b>their</b> <b>sentencing</b> hearing using a questionnaire that measured {{the extent to which they}} perceived <b>their</b> <b>sentence</b> to be a deterrent, the extent to which they felt stigmatised or reintegrated by the experience (Braithwaite, 1989), and finally, whether they felt they had been treated fairly. In general, the participants of this study did not perceive <b>their</b> <b>sentence</b> to be severe. They reported low levels of stigmatisation and moderate levels of reintegration. They also believed they had, on the whole, been treated fairly by the court...|$|R

5|$|The {{government}} also exempted those who presented authorities with a slave, a horse, or grain. In {{the system of}} twenty ranks bestowed on commoners and nobles alike, those of the ninth rank and above were exempt from military service. To compensate {{for the loss of}} manpower, the Eastern Han government favored the recruitment of a largely volunteer army. Many other soldiers in Eastern Han were convicted criminals who commuted <b>their</b> <b>sentences</b> by joining the army. Mercenaries eventually comprised much of the capital guard, while foreign nomadic tribes were often employed to guard the frontiers.|$|E
5|$|Villermé {{published}} {{works on}} the conditions in prisons in France, {{and the benefits of}} helping prisoners return to outside life when <b>their</b> <b>sentences</b> ended. Another concerned the role of industrialization on the general health and quality of life of working class people. His best known work was concerned with workers in the cotton, wool, and silk industries, including the children that worked in the mills.|$|E
5|$|A {{few days}} after the execution, the ten {{condemned}} prisoners who had had <b>their</b> <b>sentences</b> commuted to twelve months' imprisonment were transported to the prison hulk Justitia, moored at Woolwich on the River Thames. Such ships were used as holding areas prior to convicts being transferred to a regular vessel for penal transportation to, at this time, Australia. Residents of Ely tried to hold meetings to complain at this apparent extension of the prisoners' sentences. Despite, or because of, media attention—newspapers of the time took sides depending whether they supported the government or not—the prisoners were returned to Ely gaol; it may all have been a simple mistake by the clerk of the assizes.|$|E

Video footage thus collected is constantly replayed on TV screens in rooms where officers complete their paperwork. Footage that they have recorded has also been uploaded onto YouTube in an attempt to catch people they believe have reoffended.|$|E
5|$|In November, Gambira {{was sentenced}} to 68 years in prison, at least 12 years {{of which would be}} hard labour. In early 2009, five years were taken off his total sentence, {{reducing}} it to 63 years. Both Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International protested his sentence, calling for his immediate release. Aung Ko Ko Lwin, Gambira's brother who had sheltered him from authorities, {{was sentenced to}} twenty years in prison, and Moe Htet Hlyan, Gambira's brother-in-law, was also imprisoned. Aung Ko Ko Lwin and Moe Htet Hlyan were sent to Arakan State and Mon State, respectively, to serve <b>their</b> <b>sentences.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 14 June {{the court}} acquitted nine medics and {{downgraded}} sentences against nine others. Ali Al-Ekri {{was sentenced to}} five years imprisonment, another doctor to three years and seven were given from one month to one year. Two other doctors did not appeal <b>their</b> <b>sentences</b> of 15 years' imprisonment, instead fleeing the country. On 1 October, the Court of Cassation, the country's highest court, closed the first case involving twenty medics by upholding jail sentences on the remaining nine. Although the verdict is final, activist Mohamed al-Maskati said that they could still be pardoned by the king.|$|E

5|$|John Constable of HMS Windsor {{was found}} guilty of breach of orders and {{drunkenness}} and was cashiered. Samuel Vincent of the Falmouth and Christopher Fogg of the Breda were initially sentenced to be cashiered for signing the six captains' resolution, but Benbow personally declared that they had fought bravely, and <b>their</b> <b>sentences</b> were remitted by the Lord High Admiral. The sentences were deferred so that Queen Anne could have a chance to examine the proceedings. After her consideration in January 1703, she allowed the sentences to proceed and Constable, Kirkby, and Wade were returned to England as prisoners. Constable was imprisoned until 1704, when the Queen pardoned him. Kirkby and Wade were shot aboard HMS Bristol on 16 April 1703 while she was anchored in Plymouth Sound under Captain Edward Acton. Controversy slowly began to develop over the events of August 1702. Supporters of the disgraced Kirkby and Wade sought to discredit Benbow by publishing their own account of the action.|$|E
5|$|On July 22, 1986, {{both women}} entered Alford pleas for the Salmonella attack {{and the other}} charges, and {{received}} sentences ranging from three to twenty years, to be served concurrently.

Both Sheela and Puja were released on parole early for good behavior, after serving twenty-nine months of <b>their</b> <b>sentences</b> in a minimum-security federal prison. Sheela's Green Card was revoked; she moved to Switzerland. She remarried there and went on to run two nursing homes in Switzerland.|$|E
5|$|On October 24, 1944, Admiral Osterhaus and {{the other}} six {{members of the court}} deliberated for 80minutes and found all 50 {{defendants}} guilty of mutiny. Each man was reduced in rank to seaman apprentice and sentenced to 15years of hard labor to be followed by dishonorable discharge. The men were held under guard while <b>their</b> <b>sentences</b> were passed to Admiral Wright for review. On November 15, Wright reduced the sentences for 40 of the men: 24 were given 12years, 11 were given 10years and the five youngest sailors were given eight-year sentences. The full 15-year sentences remained in place for ten of the men including Joe Small and Ollie Green. In late November, the 50 men were transferred to the Federal Correctional Institution, Terminal Island in San Pedro Bay near the Port of Los Angeles and the Port of Long Beach.|$|E
