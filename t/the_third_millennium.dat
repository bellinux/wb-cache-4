5|$|According to the British Museum, the Cyrus Cylinder {{reflects}} {{a long tradition}} in Mesopotamia where, from as early as <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>millennium</b> BC, kings began their reigns with declarations of reforms. Cyrus's declaration stresses his legitimacy as the king, and is a conspicuous statement of his respect for the religious and political traditions of Babylon. The British Museum and scholars of the period describe it {{as an instrument of}} ancient Mesopotamian propaganda.|$|E

5|$|Tell Brak (Nagar, Nawar) was {{an ancient}} city in Syria.

The kungas of Nagar were in great demand in the Eblaite empire; they cost two kilos of silver, fifty times {{the price of a}} donkey, and were imported regularly by the monarchs of Ebla to be used as transport animals and gifts for allied cities.

5|$|Salt {{may have}} been used for barter in {{connection}} with the obsidian trade in Anatolia in the Neolithic Era. Herodotus described salt trading routes across Libya back in the 5th century BC. In {{the early years of the}} Roman Empire, roads such as the Via Salaria were built for the transportation of salt from the salt pans of Ostia to the capital. Salt was included among funeral offerings found in ancient Egyptian tombs from <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>millennium</b> BC, as were salted birds, and salt fish. From about 2800 BC, the Egyptians began exporting salt fish to the Phoenicians in return for Lebanon cedar, glass, and the dye Tyrian purple; the Phoenicians traded Egyptian salt fish and salt from North Africa throughout their Mediterranean trade empire.|$|E
5|$|Starting {{as a small}} {{settlement}} in the early Bronze Age (c. 3500 BC), Ebla developed into a trading empire and later into an expansionist power that imposed its hegemony over much of northern and eastern Syria. Ebla was destroyed during the 23rd century BC; it was then rebuilt and was mentioned in {{the records of the}} Third Dynasty of Ur. The second Ebla was a continuation of the first, ruled by a new royal dynasty. It was destroyed at the end of <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>millennium</b> BC, which {{paved the way for the}} Amorite tribes to settle in the city, forming the third Ebla. The third kingdom also flourished as a trade center; it became a subject and an ally of Yamhad (modern-day Aleppo) until its final destruction by the Hittite king Mursili I in c. 1600 BC.|$|E

5|$|The Zagros Mountains {{have been}} {{occupied}} {{since at least}} the Lower Palaeolithic, and Neanderthal occupation of the Great Zab basin has been testified at the archaeological site of Shanidar Cave. Historical records for the region are available from the end of <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>millennium</b> BCE onward. In the Neo-Assyrian period, the Great Zab provided water for irrigation for the lands around the capital city of Nimrud. The Battle of the Zab – which ended the Umayyad Caliphate – took place near a tributary of the Great Zab, and the valleys of the river provided shelter for refugees from the Mongol conquest of Iraq. During the 19th and 20th centuries, the Great Zab basin saw frequent uprisings of local Kurdish tribes striving for autonomy.|$|E
5|$|While the {{transition}} from the Early Neolithic to the Late Neolithic—which took place with {{the transition}} from the fourth to <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>millennium</b> BCE—witnessed much economic and technological continuity, it also saw a considerable change in the style of monuments erected, particularly in southern and eastern England. By 3,000 BCE, the long barrows, causewayed enclosures, and cursuses which had predominated in the Early Neolithic had ceased being built, and were instead replaced by circular monuments of various kinds. These include earthen henges, timber circles, and stone circles. These stone rings are found in most areas of Britain where stone is available, {{with the exception of the}} island's south-eastern corner. Stone circles are most densely concentrated in south-western Britain and on the north-eastern horn of Scotland, near Aberdeen.|$|E
5|$|According to {{linguists}} like Bhadriraju Krishnamurti, Tamil, as a Dravidian language, descends from Proto-Dravidian, a Proto-language. Linguistic reconstruction {{suggests that}} Proto-Dravidian was spoken around <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>millennium</b> BC, possibly {{in the region}} around the lower Godavari river basin in peninsular India. The material {{evidence suggests that the}} speakers of Proto-Dravidian were of the culture associated with the Neolithic complexes of South India. The next phase in the reconstructed proto-history of Tamil is Proto-South Dravidian. The linguistic evidence suggests that Proto-South Dravidian was spoken around the middle of the second millennium BC, and that proto-Tamil emerged around the 3rd century BC. The earliest epigraphic attestations of Tamil are generally taken to have been written shortly thereafter. Among Indian languages, Tamil has the most ancient non-Sanskritised Indian literature. Scholars categorise the attested history of the language into three periods, Old Tamil (300 BC – AD 700), Middle Tamil (700–1600) and Modern Tamil (1600–present). In November 2007, an excavation at Quseir-al-Qadim revealed Egyptian pottery dating back to first century BC with ancient Tamil Brahmi inscriptions. John Guy states that Tamil was the lingua franca for early maritime traders from India.|$|E

Its contemporary name is uncertain: perhaps this was Eresh. Kesh has also been suggested.

5|$|Starting {{as a small}} {{settlement}} in the seventh millennium BC, Tell Brak evolved during the fourth millennium BC {{into one of the}} biggest cities in Upper Mesopotamia, and interacted with the cultures of southern Mesopotamia. The city shrank in size at the beginning of <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>millennium</b> BC with the end of Uruk period, before expanding again around c. 2600 BC, when it became known as Nagar, and was the capital of a regional kingdom that controlled the Khabur river valley. Nagar was destroyed around c. 2300 BC, and came under the rule of the Akkadian Empire, followed by a period of independence as a Hurrian city-state, before contracting {{at the beginning of the}} second millennium BC. Nagar prospered again by the 19th century BC, and came under the rule of different regional powers. In c. 1500 BC, Tell Brak was a center of Mitanni before being destroyed by Assyria c. 1300 BC. The city never regained its former importance, remaining as a small settlement, and abandoned at some points of its history, until disappearing from records during the early Abbasid era.|$|E
