Minor improvements to the design were made, of which the most significant was to replace the glass flask with plastic. Finally, after passing all the required tests, the sticky bomb – now the No 74 Grenade Mk II – was accepted by the Ordnance Board; it was put into full-scale production and it became a service issue.|$|E

25|$|With the Serbian threat {{eliminated}} and {{the bulk}} of the Byzantine army destroyed, in 918 SimeonI personally led a campaign in the Theme of Hellas and penetrated deep to the south, reaching the Isthmus of Corinth.

The capital of Hellas, Thebes, was seized and its fortifications destroyed. A noteworthy episode of that campaign was described in the manual on warfare Strategikon by the 11th-century writer Kekaumenos. After fruitlessly besieging a populous city in Hellas, Simeon employed a ruse de guerre by sending brave and resourceful men into the city to discover weaknesses in its defences.

25|$|The x-ray {{diffraction}} {{of a sample}} from an unfired lump of pottery clay excavated at the Zebree (3MS20) site confirmed that the shell was burned before being added to the raw clay. Burning the shells eliminates the organic binder and the cooled, burnt shells are easily crushed into a shell temper of fine plate-like particles, some nearly powder. <b>The</b> <b>hinges</b> of the shells are discarded. Using burned shells is logical as unburned mussel shells are hard and very durable. In terms of soil technology, the addition of shell (calcium carbonate) {{has the effect of}} neutralizing the ionic charge of the clay particles. During the course of replicative pottery experiments, as the shell was added to the clay in the presence of water, distinct and immediate changes took place in the feel of the clay. With the valence neutral, the clay-temper combination produces a very satisfactory pottery clay. This modification of backswamp clay - particles now clumping instead of constantly slipping - into a well-behaved modeling clay would have been immediately noticed by the experienced prehistoric potter.|$|E
25|$|Of the 11th and 12th centuries {{there are}} {{numerous}} examples of bronze doors, the earliest being one at Hildesheim, Germany (1015). The Hildesheim design affected the concept of Gniezno door in Poland.

In all these cases the hanging stile had pivots {{at the top and}} bottom.

40|$|AbstractDuring {{the fusion}} of the {{influenza}} virus to the host cell, bending of the HA 2 chain of hemagglutinin into a hairpin-shaped structure in a pH-dependent manner facilitates {{the fusion of}} the viral envelope and the endosomal membrane. To characterize the structural and dynamical responses of <b>the</b> <b>hinge</b> region of HA 2 to pH changes and examine {{the role of a}} conserved histidine in this region (<b>the</b> <b>hinge</b> histidine), we have performed an extensive set of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of 26 -residue peptides encompassing <b>the</b> <b>hinge</b> regions of several hemagglutinin subtypes under both neutral and low pH conditions, modeled by the change of the protonation state of <b>the</b> <b>hinge</b> histidine. More than 70 sets of MD simulations (collectively amounting to 25. 1 μs) were performed in both implicit and explicit solvents to study the effect of histidine protonation on structural dynamics of <b>the</b> <b>hinge</b> region. In both explicit and implicit solvent simulations, hinge bending was consistently observed upon the protonation of the histidine in all the simulations starting with an initial straight helical conformation, whereas the systems with a neutral histidine retained their primarily straight conformation throughout the simulations. Conversely, the MD simulations starting from an initially bent conformation resulted in the formation of a straight helical structure upon the neutralization of <b>the</b> <b>hinge</b> histidine, whereas <b>the</b> bent structure was maintained when <b>the</b> <b>hinge</b> histidine remained protonated. Finally, mutation of <b>the</b> <b>hinge</b> histidine to alanine abolishes the bending response of the peptide altogether. A molecular mechanism based on the interaction of <b>the</b> <b>hinge</b> histidine with neighboring acidic residues is proposed to be responsible for its role in controlling the conformation of <b>the</b> <b>hinge.</b> We propose that this might present a common mechanism for pH-controlled structural changes in helical structures when histidines act as the pH sensor...|$|R
40|$|Ribosome {{recycling}} factor (RRF), {{in concert}} with elongation factor EF-G, is required for disassembly of the posttermination complex of the ribosome after release of polypeptides. The crystal structure of Thermus thermophilus RRF was determined at 2. 6 A resolution. It is a tRNA-like L-shaped molecule consisting of two domains: a long three-helix bundle (domain 1) and a three-layer beta/alpha/beta sandwich (domain 2). Although the individual domain structures {{are similar to those}} of Thermotoga maritima RRF (Selmer et al., Science, 1999, 286 : 2349 - 2352), the interdomain angle differs by 33 degrees in two molecules, suggesting that <b>the</b> <b>hinge</b> between two domains is potentially flexible and responsive to different conditions of crystal packing. <b>The</b> <b>hinge</b> connects hydrophobic junctions of domains 1 and 2. The structure-based genetic analysis revealed the strong correlation between <b>the</b> <b>hinge</b> flexibility and <b>the</b> in vivo function of RRF. First, altering <b>the</b> <b>hinge</b> flexibility by making alanine or serine substitutions for large-size residues conserved at <b>the</b> <b>hinge</b> loop and nearby in domain 1 frequently gave rise to gain of function except a Pro residue conserved at <b>the</b> <b>hinge</b> loop. Second, <b>the</b> <b>hinge</b> defect resulting from a too relaxed hinge structure can be compensated for by secondary alterations in domain 1 that seem to increase the hydrophobic contact between domain 1 and <b>the</b> <b>hinge</b> loop. These results show that <b>the</b> <b>hinge</b> flexibility is vital for the function of RRF and that the steric interaction between <b>the</b> <b>hinge</b> loop and domains 1 and 2 restricts the interdomain angle and/or <b>the</b> <b>hinge</b> flexibility. These results indicate that RRF possesses an architectural difference from tRNA regardless of a resemblance to tRNA shape: RRF has a "gooseneck" elbow, whereas the tRNA elbow is rigid, and the direction of flex of RRF and tRNA is at a nearly right angle to each other. Moreover, surface electrostatic potentials of the two RRF proteins are dissimilar and do not mimic the surface potential of tRNA or EF-G. These properties will add a new insight into RRF, suggesting that RRF is more than a simple tRNA mimic...|$|R

The present study provides laser Doppler velocimetry results for the Advantage and St Jude Medical valves to make a direct comparison of the flow fields of the 2 valve designs. This study aids in determining the preclinical efficacy of Medtronic’s new bileaflet valve hinge design. MethodsTwo-dimensional laser Doppler velocimetry was used to measure the velocities in <b>the</b> <b>hinge</b> regions of size 29 Medtronic Advantage and St Jude Medical standard bileaflet valve designs. Exact dimensional models of the bileaflet valves, including <b>the</b> <b>hinge</b> regions, were cast from transparent plastic materials to conduct these measurements under simulated physiologic conditions. Laser Doppler velocimetry measurements were conducted under physiologic conditions, with the valves placed in the mitral position of a pulsatile flow loop. Measurements were taken at several elevation levels in <b>the</b> <b>hinge</b> region. Multiple measurement locations obtained in each plane provided a grid work by which the flow fields could be detailed. ResultsVelocity measurements obtained for each valve design in <b>the</b> <b>hinge</b> recess were used to reconstruct the flow fields. For the Advantage valve, the peak velocities during leakage flow in <b>the</b> <b>hinge</b> at zero depth, one-third depth, and two-thirds depth levels into <b>the</b> <b>hinge</b> recess were 0. 9, 1. 6, and 1. 8 m/s, respectively.
