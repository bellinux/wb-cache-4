5|$|Beginning {{with the}} pilot, Miller {{structured}} each episode by telling two {{stories in the}} episode. The first was a traditional procedural plotline. <b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>story</b> was a flashback from Henry's past. The flashback either related to the episode's main present-day storyline, such as Henry's involvement in investigating the Jack the Ripper case, or was a scene from Henry's backstory, such as {{his life in the}} Lower East Side's tenements in the 1890s. Both the father-son relationship between Henry and Abe and one of the two season-long story arcs, Henry's relationship with his wife Abigail, were told through flashbacks.|$|E
5|$|Following the bombing, French Gabonese {{made more}} {{threatening}} {{phone calls to}} the embassy. A second bomb exploded at the embassy two nights later, causing no damage. A drive-by shooting, during which at least five rounds of buckshot were fired from a 12-gauge automatic shotgun, riddled <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>story</b> windows with over 30 holes. It is likely that its perpetrators were French, as Gabonese {{have no access to}} grenades. Following the second bombing a car containing white men was noticed, driving through otherwise empty Shore Boulevard. At the time, practically the only white men in Gabon were French.|$|E

5|$|Although Hergé {{wanted to}} send Tintin to the United States, Wallez ordered him to set his {{adventure}} in the Soviet Union, acting as anti-socialist propaganda for children. The result, Tintin in the Land of the Soviets, was serialised in Le Petit Vingtième from January 1929 to May 1930. Popular in Francophone Belgium, Wallez organised a publicity stunt at the Gare du Nord station, following which he organised {{the publication of the}} story in book form. The story's popularity led to an increase in sales, so Wallez granted Hergé two assistants. At Wallez's direction, in June he began serialisation of <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>story,</b> Tintin in the Congo, designed to encourage colonial sentiment towards the Belgian Congo. Authored in a paternalistic style that depicted the Congolese as childlike idiots, in later decades it was accused of racism, however at the time was un-controversial and popular, and further publicity stunts were held to increase sales.|$|E
5|$|As {{with each}} season since Big Brother 6, {{the program was}} filmed at CBS Studios in Studio City, California.

5|$|In January 1942, {{a meeting}} {{was held for}} the purpose of {{establishing}} a more extensive library service. Later that month, on January 29, a charter was issued by West Virginia Secretary of State William Smith O'Brien for the creation of the non-profit Hampshire County Library Association. Following its incorporation, the library was relocated from Literary Hall to two rear adjoining rooms on <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>story</b> of the Hampshire County Courthouse. The association continued to house its library collection in the courthouse until 1967, when the new Hampshire County Public Library building at 153West Main Street was formally dedicated on September 28, 1967. The library had been built on land donated by sisters Kate and Mary Davis, who had been engaged in the restoration of Literary Hall and whose father, Charles Maurice Davis, {{had been a member of}} both the Romney Literary Society and the Clinton Lodge Masons, which had both held meetings in the building.|$|E
5|$|Set on {{the fictional}} continents of Westeros and Essos, Game of Thrones has several plot lines {{and a large}} {{ensemble}} cast but centers on three primary story arcs. The first story arc centers on the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms and follows a web of alliances and conflicts among the dynastic noble families either vying to claim the throne or fighting for independence from the throne. <b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>story</b> arc focuses on the last descendant of the realm's deposed ruling dynasty, exiled and plotting {{a return to the}} throne. The third story arc centers on the longstanding brotherhood charged with defending the realm against the ancient threats of the fierce peoples and legendary creatures that lie far north, and an impending winter that threatens the realm.|$|E
5|$|Sora {{returns as}} the game's protagonist. Donald Duck and Goofy are less {{involved}} in the gameplay and story. Like the first game, Chain of Memories features numerous characters from both the Final Fantasy series and the Disney animated features canon.

5|$|The new wing has six dormers (three on a side), and six dormers {{were added}} to the old house in the 1913 {{renovation}} (four on the east side, two on the west). The windows {{on the first floor of}} the new wing matched the old windows, but the windows in <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>story</b> of the addition have twelve panes in the upper sash and eight in the lower. As part of the renovation work, four new windows were placed in the 1850s house: two just west of the new wing, and two on the east wall of the lower part of the L. A small porch was added in the corner where the west wall of the new wing meets the north wall of the old house, and all the old porches were restored. In the original house two chimneys were restored and two replaced, and new fireplaces were installed in the living room, library, and dining room. The house has a total of 28 rooms.|$|E

Across Japan, strong waves and high winds killed over 11,000bluefin tuna on a fish farm in Kushimoto, accounting for ¥1.29billion ($10.4million) in losses. About 15,000people lost power across the country. The storm damaged 30homes and flooded another 190, and also damaged farming equipment. There were 55injuries and two deaths related to the typhoon, including an elderly man who drowned after falling into a ditch. Total damage in the Kansai region reached ¥18billion (US$150million), including ¥7.1billion (US$58.9million) in Wakayama Prefecture and ¥4.9billion (US$40.7million) in Hyogo Prefecture.

6000|$|... § V. So far {{as their}} {{structure}} can be traced, they agree also in having tall and few arches in their lower stories, and shorter and more numerous arches above: {{but it happens}} most unfortunately that in the only two cases in which <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>stories</b> are left <b>the</b> ground floors are modernized, and in the others where the sea <b>stories</b> are left <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>stories</b> are modernized; so that we never have more than two tiers of the Byzantine arches, one above the other. These, however, are quite enough to show the first main point on which I wish to insist, namely, the subtlety of the feeling for proportion in the Greek architects; and I hope that even the general reader will not allow himself to be frightened {{by the look of}} a few measurements, for, if he will only take the little pains necessary to compare them, he will, I am almost certain, find the result not devoid of interest.|$|R

5|$|Barrington Civic Center Historic District is a {{historic}} district in Barrington, Rhode Island on County Road. The district, which consists of the Barrington Town Hall, Leander R. Peck School and Prince's Hill Cemetery, is located on Prince's Hill {{near the center of}} Barrington. In 1728, Prince's Hill Cemetery was purchased and later expanded to its present size by 1898. The -story Barrington Town Hall was completed in 1888 and originally served as the seat of the town's government, library and high school. With the completion of the Leander R. Peck School in 1917, the high school moved into the adjacent building and the library used its space. The two-story Elizabethan Revival style Peck School is designed with a T-shaped plan and features a stairway to access the main entrance on <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>story.</b> The Peck School was later used by the fifth and sixth grade elementary students before becoming the public library. Also located within the district is Wood's Pond. The Barrington Civic Center Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976, and serves as historically significant example of civic and natural environment planning of the late nineteenth century.|$|E
5|$|In March 1985, Partnair {{was granted}} {{concession}} for scheduled services from Fornebu via Notodden to Stavanger. The route was started on 15 August using a ten-seat Beechcraft 200 Super King Air and flew twice a day, {{five days a}} week. This route was made possible after an instrument landing system was installed at the airport. The NOK2 million cost had been paid for by Norsk Hydro, while Tinfos had paid NOK100,000 for new landing lights. The upgrades also included a new terminal, which included a café in <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>story</b> and seating for 14 people. Ticket sales and check-in was managed by NSB Reisebyrå, {{a subsidiary of the}} Norwegian State Railways. After five months, Partnair had lost NOK1.2 million on the route. In average, they were selling three to four tickets per flight to Stavanger, and one to Oslo. From March 1986, the leg from Notodden to Oslo was dropped and the service to Stavanger reduced. However, the route proved unprofitable and was eventually terminated later the same month.|$|E
