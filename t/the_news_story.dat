Previous researches have shown {{that there is a}} strong relationship between the time when <b>the</b> <b>news</b> <b>stories</b> are released and the time when the stock prices fluctuate. In this paper, we propose a systematic framework for predicting the tertiary movements of stock prices by analyzing the impacts of <b>the</b> <b>news</b> <b>stories</b> on <b>the</b> stocks. To be more specific, we investigate the immediate impacts of <b>news</b> <b>stories</b> on <b>the</b> stocks based on the Efficient Markets Hypothesis.
