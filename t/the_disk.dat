5|$|Dust and {{possibly}} water ice from this belt migrates inward because of drag from the stellar wind and a {{process by which}} stellar radiation causes dust grains to slowly spiral toward Epsilon Eridani, known as the Poynting–Robertson effect. At the same time, these dust particles can be destroyed through mutual collisions. The time scale {{for all of the}} dust in <b>the</b> <b>disk</b> to be cleared away by these processes is less than Epsilon Eridani's estimated age. Hence, the current dust disk must have been created by collisions or other effects of larger parent bodies, and <b>the</b> <b>disk</b> represents a late stage in the planet-formation process.

A conflict-free {{coloring}} {{for a given}} set of disks is a coloring of <b>the</b> <b>disks</b> {{such that}} for any point p on the plane there is a <b>disk</b> among <b>the</b> <b>disks</b> covering p having a color {{different from that of}} the rest of <b>the</b> <b>disks</b> that covers p.

This paper focuses on unit disks, i. e., disks with radius one. We give an algorithm that colors a sequence of n unit <b>disks</b> in <b>the</b> dynamic offline setting using O(log n) colors. The algorithm is asymptotically optimal because Ω(log n) colors is necessary to color some set of n unit disks for any value of n [9]. ...|$|R
5|$|The {{most recent}} disk {{responsible}} for these phase changes was formed in 1972. What's intriguing, however, is that Pleione's long-term polarimetric observations show the intrinsic polarization angle has changed, providing direct evidence for a spatial motion of <b>the</b> <b>disk</b> axis. Because Pleione has a stellar companion with a relatively close orbit, the shift in the polarization angle {{has been attributed to}} the companion causing a precession (wobble) of <b>the</b> <b>disk,</b> with a precession period of roughly 81 years.|$|E
5|$|Under certain {{circumstances}} <b>the</b> <b>disk,</b> which {{can now be}} called protoplanetary, may {{give birth to a}} planetary system. Protoplanetary disks have been observed around a very high fraction of stars in young star clusters. They exist from the beginning of a star's formation, but at the earliest stages are unobservable due to the opacity of the surrounding envelope. <b>The</b> <b>disk</b> of a Class0 protostar is thought to be massive and hot. It is an accretion disk, which feeds the central protostar. The temperature can easily exceed 400K inside 5AU and 1,000K inside 1AU. The heating of <b>the</b> <b>disk</b> is primarily caused by the viscous dissipation of turbulence in it and by the infall of the gas from the nebula. The high temperature in the inner disk causes most of the volatile material—water, organics, and some rocks to evaporate, leaving only the most refractory elements like iron. The ice can survive only in the outer part of <b>the</b> <b>disk.</b>|$|E
5|$|Computer {{simulations}} of the dusty disk orbiting Epsilon Eridani {{suggest that the}} shape of <b>the</b> <b>disk</b> {{may be explained by}} the presence of a second planet, tentatively dubbed Epsilon Eridanic. Clumping in the dust disk may occur because dust particles are being trapped in orbits that have resonant orbital periods with a planet in an eccentric orbit. The postulated Epsilon Eridanic would orbit at a distance of 40AU, with an eccentricity of 0.3 and a period of 280 years. The inner cavity of <b>the</b> <b>disk</b> may be explained by the presence of additional planets. Current models of planet formation cannot easily explain how a planet could have been created at this distance from Epsilon Eridani. <b>The</b> <b>disk</b> is expected to have dissipated long before a giant planet could have formed. Instead, the planet may have formed at an orbital distance of about 10AU, then migrated outward because of gravitational interaction with the disc or with other planets in the system.|$|E
40|$|We here {{examine the}} {{conditions}} of <b>the</b> two-phase <b>disk</b> model under which magnetic flares arise above <b>the</b> cold accretion <b>disk</b> due to magnetic buoyancy and produce X-rays via Comptonization of <b>the</b> <b>disk's</b> soft radiation.

Using a simplified, yet physically self-consistent, model that takes this effect into account, we show that the hard X-ray spectrum of some GBHCs can be explained as the X-ray emission by magnetic flares only when <b>the</b> <b>disk's</b> bolometric luminosity is a relatively small fraction (∼ 5...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that chondrules and calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions (CAIs) were formed at the inner edge of <b>the</b> protoplanetary <b>disk</b> and then entrained in magnetocentrifugal X-winds. We study trajectories of such solid bodies with the consideration of the central star gravity, <b>the</b> protoplanetary <b>disk</b> gravity, and <b>the</b> gas drag of the wind. The efficiency of the gas drag depends on a parameter η, which is the product of the solid body size and density. We find that the gravity of <b>the</b> protoplanetary <b>disk</b> has a non-negligible effect on the trajectories.

5|$|One {{hypothesis}} is formation by the gravitational instability. Particles several centimeters in size or larger slowly settle {{near the middle}} plane of <b>the</b> <b>disk,</b> forming a very thin—less than 100km—and dense layer. This layer is gravitationally unstable and may fragment into numerous clumps, which in turn collapse into planetesimals. However, the differing velocities of the gas disk and the solids near the mid-plane can generate turbulence which prevents the layer from becoming thin enough to fragment due to gravitational instability. This may limit the formation of planetesimals via gravitational instabilities to specific locations in <b>the</b> <b>disk</b> where the concentration of solids is enhanced.|$|E
5|$|Photographing {{an eclipse}} is {{possible}} with fairly common camera equipment.

Solar filters are required for digital photography even if an optical viewfinder is not used. Using a camera's live view feature or an electronic viewfinder is safe for the human eye, but the Sun's rays could potentially irreparably damage digital image sensors unless the lens is covered by a properly designed solar filter.|$|E

5|$|The {{main problem}} in the physics of {{accretion}} disks is the generation of turbulence and the mechanism responsible for the high effective viscosity.
