25|$|One {{prominent}} and very popular theory states that lifespan can be lengthened by a tight budget for food energy called caloric restriction. Caloric restriction observed in many animals (most notably mice and rats) shows a near doubling of life span {{from a very}} limited calorific intake. Support for the theory has been bolstered by several new studies linking lower basal metabolic rate to increased life expectancy. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> to why animals like giant tortoises can live so long. Studies of humans with life spans of at least 100 have shown a link to decreased thyroid activity, resulting in their lowered metabolic rate.|$|E
500|$|The first actors cast in {{the pilot}} were Kirk Acevedo and Mark Valley in mid January 2008. John Noble and Lance Reddick were next to be cast, {{although}} it was incorrectly believed that Tomas Arana had been cast in Reddick's role. This {{was followed by the}} casting of Anna Torv, Blair Brown and Jasika Nicole. Abrams said that Torv was cast because she was a combination of [...] "sophistication, great talent, amazing looks and a complexity <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> to the character being an interesting central character". Kurtzman felt that she was someone [...] "you want to spend time with", which was critical to a series about science. Joshua Jackson was the last series regular to be cast. Jackson auditioned for the role of James T. Kirk in Abrams' Star Trek and believed this is what impressed the producer to cast him in his television project. According to Abrams, Jackson's casting was [...] "very last minute".|$|E

Idea Space {{was created by}} humans tired of {{awaiting}} the arrival of their [...] "Messiah" [...] in the real world: hoping to bring about salvation through technology, the humans created the Idea Space, and generated Maria as its goddess and administrator to further the creation of Millennial Kingdom by manipulating its users. On their mission into Shibuya 109, Azuma retrieves a Desire Disc, an artifact containing the saved desires of humanity <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> to both sides' plans. Azuma is faced with choices about which faction to support. The Law faction, supported by Maria, wishes {{to bring peace to}} humanity along with releasing the Idea Space's inhabitants. The Chaos faction, which can be led by Lucifer if he is freed from his prison within a metaphysical plain called the Expanse, intends to destroy the inhabitants of Idea Space and start anew with the chosen Adam and Eve: Azuma and the Chaos companion. To fulfill any of their chosen roles, Azuma must defeat Yaldabaoth, the controller of Idea Space who is keeping the system going and will not allow either Maria or Lucifer to carry out their plans.|$|E
