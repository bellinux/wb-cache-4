5|$|The deleted scenes {{included}} on the DVD were originally featured on the official Parks and Recreation website after the episode aired. In the first, a minute-long clip, Ron tries {{to take a job}} offer that was previously offered to him at an Internet flower company web site, but when he finds <b>the</b> <b>business</b> <b>is</b> doing so poorly, he sadly realizes he will be in his government job for a long time. In a second minute-long clip, Leslie talks about her very detailed life plan, which involves eventually becoming head of the parks department, then governor of Indiana, then U.S. vice president and then getting married at age 84.

25|$|In 2014, {{the city}} {{government}} pumped $16.5 million into Mall St. Vincent, but the long-term fate of <b>the</b> <b>business</b> <b>is</b> in doubt. An outdoor fountain included in the remodeling project, is crumbling and without water, and plants surrounding the structure have died. In 2017, Gymboree and Grimaldi's Pizzeria closed their Mall St. Vincent operations; Sears is reportedly in jeopardy too. Online shopping and changing consumer habits pose {{a serious threat to}} shopping malls; as many as one in four could close within the next five years.|$|E
25|$|Dongguan has as well {{a variety}} of types of brothels, massage parlours, nightclubs, sauna centres and karaoke bars. The city has more than 120 top-end luxury hotels and {{hundreds}} of other mid-range places that offer illegal sexual services or lease floors to sex operators, and many parts of the broader service sector benefit from the trade brought by visitors. Although much of <b>the</b> <b>business</b> <b>is</b> illegal, police operations to limit these activities were for a long time largely ineffective, in part because many members of the local administration and other officials have business interests in the sector.|$|E
25|$|Compared to {{the other}} three of the “Big Four,” PwC {{is said to have}} a “less competitive” atmosphere. According to one observer, the core to <b>the</b> <b>business</b> <b>is</b> how the firm values and {{promotes}} “difference by building an environment where everyone can be themselves.” The company employs large numbers of young workers, with 80 percent of their work-force millennials. PwC uses education to bridge the culture gap between generations. The firm also implements the “Connect-Embed-Improve plan to promote employee engagement. PwC relies on employees sharing of knowledge and learning. Senior staff facilitate learning. Teaching the next generation what they know is one of the keys that ensures that PwC can bring value to its clients.|$|E

25|$|Administrative {{controls}} (also called chibai) {{consist of}} approved written policies, procedures, standards and guidelines. Administrative controls form {{the framework for}} running the business and managing people. They inform people on how <b>the</b> <b>business</b> <b>is</b> to be run and how day-to-day operations are to be conducted. Laws and regulations created by government bodies are also a type of administrative control because they inform the business. Some industry sectors have policies, procedures, standards and guidelines that must be followed – the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) required by Visa and MasterCard is such an example. Other examples of administrative controls include the corporate security policy, password policy, hiring policies, and disciplinary policies.|$|E
25|$|During {{the years}} the ship {{has been in the}} care of two {{foundation}}s. The first foundation consisted of Volvo, SKF, Stena Line and the Port of Gothenburg among others. This foundation financed the ship up {{until the end of the}} journey to China and in 2010, its economical commitment ended. The second foundation, a non-profitable foundation, for the ship was created shortly afterwards. <b>The</b> <b>business</b> <b>is</b> operated by The Swedish East India Company Ltd. In January 2011, questions were raised about the future of the ship. The Gothenburg Municipality was willing to pay for the ongoing maintenance of the ship if sponsors made contributions for the expeditions and other activities. An immediate liquidation of the operation and turning the ship into a museum was also suggested. In February 2011, the future plans for the ship were postponed by the Västra Götaland Regional Council.|$|E
25|$|There are {{approximately}} 15,000 inmates profiled on the site, {{most of whom}} are incarcerated in the United States. However, the site also includes international inmates. Although the site provides no Internet access of any kind to inmates, it has often been called the MySpace and Facebook for inmates by the media. Because <b>the</b> <b>business</b> <b>is</b> housed online and includes inmate profiles, it has been compared to social media; however, most agencies recognize it as promoting traditional pen-pal postal mail because the site provides no mechanism for inmates to access the site online. By 2003, the site had about 10,000 hits per day and presented profiles from inmates in about a dozen countries. Inmates using WriteAPrisoner.com only have access to postal mail. The site charges inmates $40 per year to post their profile and photo, which are viewed by the public at no cost. The site encourages writing directly to inmates or sending a first message through its free e-mail forwarding service. The president and owner of the company is Adam Lovell, author of WriteAPrisoner.com's SELF-HELP GUIDE FOR INMATES: Flourishing Through Adversity. In 2010 the website received about 2 million page views per month.|$|E

25|$|Under wind, {{atmospheric}} pollutants {{move in a}} north and northeasterly direction, and in times of low winds or moderate winds, are more evenly distributed over the city. The most polluting industrial processes in the city are ammonium sulfate, cement, plaster and paper pulp. The emission of gases from motor vehicle traffic is more critical in the central district, where much of <b>the</b> <b>business</b> <b>is.</b> The main source of air pollution is from the vehicles at 34% and then industry with 18%. The pollutants emitted by vehicles are carbon monoxide (89.12%), sulfur dioxide (0.23%), hydrocarbons (6.46%), oxides of nitrogen (3.82%) and other particles (0. 37%). To help remedy this problem, several state enterprises and private sector have supported a project to convert liquid fuel vehicles to natural gas. Furthermore, the city has installed more than 12 service stations catering to natural gas vehicles. Barranquilla is the fourth biggest atmospheric polluter from industry. According to research conducted by the Institute of Hydrology, Meteorology and Environmental Studies of Colombia (IDEAM), monthly concentrations in Barranquilla of particulate matter smaller than 160 micrograms per cubic meter exceeds the highest international standard allowed of 70. The causes of this problem lie heavily on the poor quality of petrol and diesel used by vehicles of the city, with record levels of 5,000 ppm (parts per million sulfur) and 4,500 ppm respectively, when there are countries whose rates do not even exceed 50.|$|E
500|$|Even the {{building}} itself is minimalistic. One observer described it as [...] "so understated that [...] is easy to miss even when one is looking for it", while another said [...] "pass by and you might think it's {{the home of a}} batty husband and wife who rarely go outside". [...] The building has a dirty awning and cheap blinds that give the impression <b>the</b> <b>business</b> <b>is</b> closed for remodeling. Schwa is surrounded by dingy buildings and a tire store featuring plastic palm trees.|$|E
500|$|The pared-down {{approach}} {{can also be}} seen in the way <b>the</b> <b>business</b> <b>is</b> run. Carlson maintains a staff of only four people to run his restaurant – himself and three other chefs. Schwa has no receptionist, waiters, or other support staff. [...] Schwa's chefs do every job in the restaurant ranging from taking orders to busing tables. Tables are small, simple, and have none of the usual restaurant amenities – no flowers, candles, salt, or pepper. The decor is minimalist, and the kitchen is viewable by patrons in the dining room.|$|E
