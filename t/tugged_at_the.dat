25|$|Led {{from the}} front by Steve Waugh, Australia began the day at a {{precarious}} 291/8 but that {{would prove to be}} the high of the day for India. The 35 yr old Waugh batted well with Gillespie and then Glenn McGrath – and crossed numerous landmarks on the way – as he took Australia to a total of 445. In the process the Australian captain notched up his 25th Test century, crossing Sachin Tendulkar's tally of 24 hundreds at the time. Having never made a Test hundred in India, Waugh was more emotional than normal as he <b>tugged</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> red handkerchief in his pocket, took off his helmet and raised his bat to a full house Eden crowd. He also passed Javed Miandad to become the (then) 4th highest run getter in test cricket.|$|E
500|$|Gaga {{opened the}} 2011 MuchMusic Video Awards with a {{performance}} of the song, sporting a bejeweled catsuit and a bob teal colored wig. While on tour in Japan, Gaga performed [...] "The Edge of Glory" [...] and [...] "Born This Way" [...] at the 2011 MTV Video Music Aid Japan. She started the performance while hanging from a giant spider web, with her aquamarine hair extensions stuck in it. Beginning to sing, Gaga pulled and <b>tugged</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> web, and ultimately broke free to join her dancers as she finished the performance. On October 16, 2011 she performed the song during a concert at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles for the Clinton Foundation. [...] "The Edge of Glory" [...] was performed regularly as the penultimate song of Gaga's [...] Born This Way Ball (2012–2013) tour where she played {{the beginning of the}} song on piano atop a watch tower. She wore a Versace-designed cloth for the performance. In 2014, Gaga sang a short version of the song during the [...]|$|E
2500|$|Every man {{sprang to}} duty. The cheerful chanty was roared out, and heard above the howl of the gale. The cable held very hard, {{and when it}} surged over, the {{windlass}} sent the men flying about the deck, as if a galvanic battery had been applied to their hands. The vessel's head was often buried in the solid seas, and the men, soaked and sweating, yelled out hoarsely, [...] "Paddy on the Railway," [...] and [...] "We're Homeward Bound," [...] while they <b>tugged</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> brakes, and wound the long, hard cable in, inch by inch.|$|E
60|$|Chiltern {{paused in}} his <b>tugging</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> straps, {{and looked up}} at her.|$|R

60|$|Then Randal <b>tugged</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> cloths, {{and then}} they all heard a little shrill cry.|$|E
60|$|Bibot {{tried to}} speak; he <b>tugged</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{collar of his}} ragged shirt; an awful curse escaped him.|$|E
60|$|He <b>tugged</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> ropes {{around his}} body, {{and after a}} hard {{struggle}} he managed to free his left arm.|$|E
50|$|Mistletoe {{served as}} a <b>tug</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Cairo Naval Base until joining the Mississippi Squadron downriver 7 September 1863.|$|R

60|$|Lewisham's {{face flushed}} irregularly. He did not answer. He scowled and <b>tugged</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> still {{by no means}} ample moustache.|$|E
60|$|Segrave's hand wandered {{mechanically}} {{to his own}} neck; he <b>tugged</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> fastening of his lace collar, as if, in truth, he were choking.|$|E
6000|$|Clavering <b>tugged</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> extemporized girth. [...] "I {{am afraid}} {{you can only}} try again. I don't think it will slip now," [...] he said.|$|E
60|$|Aynesworth ceased <b>tugging</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> strap of his portmanteau, {{and rose}} slowly to his feet. A visitor had entered his rooms--apparently unannounced.|$|R
50|$|Following the {{collapse}} of the Confederacy, Blue Light continued to perform duty as an ordnance <b>tug</b> <b>at</b> Boston, Massachusetts, until 1870. From 1871-June 1873, she served as a yard <b>tug</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Washington Navy Yard.|$|R

60|$|So Tom pulled and <b>tugged</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> bricks: but {{he could}} not move one. And then he tried to wipe Mr. Grimes' face: but the soot would not come off.|$|E
6000|$|They crept on {{against the}} tide, Whitney panting as he <b>tugged</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> oars, {{for he had}} enough; and it was with keen {{satisfaction}} that he heard Andrew call out presently: ...|$|E
60|$|With might {{and main}} he <b>tugged</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> rope which bound his hands. At first it {{remained}} tight, {{but at last}} it loosened sufficiently {{to allow him to}} slip out his right hand.|$|E
60|$|She {{followed}} Mr. Wragg inside, and the driver, a {{small man}} and elderly, began <b>tugging</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> huge trunk. Mr. Gale's moment had arrived.|$|R
60|$|She swept {{down the}} steps and passed him. Before he could reach her side she was <b>tugging</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> handle of the {{carriage}} door.|$|R
60|$|While {{our friends}} yet trembled with this sensation, quick steps ascended to their door, and then {{followed}} a sharp, anxious <b>tug</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> bell.|$|R
60|$|On {{reaching}} Sixty-First Street {{she found}} her way blocked by a lumbering delivery wagon. She followed it slowly for a while; then, growing tired of being merely a unit in a procession, <b>tugged</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> steering-wheel, {{and turned to the}} right.|$|E
60|$|He {{seemed to}} choke, <b>tugged</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> throat button of the cloak, jumped up {{open-mouthed}} {{as if to}} hurl curses and denunciation, but instantly mastered himself, and, wrapping up the cloak closer about him, {{sat down on the}} deck again as quiet as ever.|$|E
60|$|Every {{evening he}} went out upon the sea, and one evening the net was so heavy that hardly could he draw it into the boat. And he laughed, and said to himself, 'Surely I have caught all the fish that swim, or snared some dull monster {{that will be a}} marvel to men, or some thing of horror that the great Queen will desire,' and putting forth all his strength, he <b>tugged</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> coarse ropes till, like lines of blue enamel round a vase of bronze, the long veins rose up on his arms. He <b>tugged</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> thin ropes, and nearer and nearer came the circle of flat corks, and the net rose at last {{to the top of the}} water.|$|E
60|$|He was {{a little}} on edge, that she knew. He gave another <b>tug</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> boot, and {{while she was still}} hesitating, he began again.|$|R
6000|$|RICHARDSON, <b>tugging</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> closed door, 'Come out of that. I {{promised to}} put you on the upper landing. You can't go hiding in there, lady.' ...|$|R
60|$|Both {{began to}} <b>tug</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sapling, and <b>at</b> last got it {{free from the}} stump end. Then they fairly rushed with it {{to the bottom of}} the cliff.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, but please, you mustn't!' She <b>tugged</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> car's side. 'Wouldn't {{you like}} some flowers or some orchids? We've really splendid orchids, and'--she clasped her hands--'there are Japanese goldfish--real Japanese goldfish, with four tails. If you don't care for 'em, perhaps your friends or somebody--oh, please!' ...|$|E
60|$|The hungry waves hissed tumultuously on, {{but were}} cleft and passed under the ship disappointed, {{for there was}} still enough of water beneath to permit of her tossing to and fro and rising to them like a duck, as she {{strained}} and <b>tugged</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> anchors.|$|E
60|$|Quickly {{she came}} to his side and motioned him to rise while she <b>tugged</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> knots which held the bonds in place about his arms. Once she stopped long enough to recross the room {{and close the door}} which she had left open when she entered.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Bab, {{how could}} you do it? Ma was frightened dreadfully," [...] said Betty, gently <b>tugging</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> striped leg, as Sancho poked his head in for another shoe.|$|R
6000|$|... "You're very kind, I must say," [...] said Barry. [...] "I {{suppose you}} won't object to my having {{a bottle of}} soda water?"--and he gave a terrible <b>tug</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> bell.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{other girls}} said," [...] she began, <b>tugging</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> button, [...] "that you was a 'cirkiss'"--another tug--"'a nigger minstrel'"--and a third tug--"'a agent with samples'--but that showed all they knew!" ...|$|R
