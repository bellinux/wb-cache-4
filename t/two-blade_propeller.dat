25|$|The Triplane first flew with a 110hp (80kW) Clerget {{rotary engine}} driving a four-blade, 8ft (2.46m) {{diameter}} propeller, then {{later with a}} 100hp (75kW) Gnome with a <b>two-blade</b> <b>propeller.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Ar 66 had an Argus As 10 {{air-cooled}} inverted V8 engine producing about 179kW (240hp), which drove a 2.5m (8.2ft) <b>two-blade</b> <b>propeller.</b> It carried 205L (54US gal) of fuel, and 17L (4US gal) of oil.|$|E
25|$|The {{first two}} A6M1 prototypes were {{completed}} in March 1939, {{powered by the}} 580kW (780hp) Mitsubishi Zuisei 13 engine with a <b>two-blade</b> <b>propeller.</b> It first flew on 1 April, and passed testing within a remarkably short period. By September, {{it had already been}} accepted for Navy testing as the A6M1 Type 0 Carrier Fighter, with the only notable change being a switch to a three-bladed propeller to cure a vibration problem.|$|E

25|$|The 650hp (490kW) Condor engine drove a <b>two-blade</b> <b>propeller</b> and had, {{after some}} Air Ministry input, a nose-mounted {{radiator}} under the propeller shaft. The Ministry advised that {{the wings of}} the first two Berkeleys of the three specified in the contract should have wooden wings for speed of completion, with the third to be all metal. Leitner-Watts Metal airscrews were required for the second and third machine. The first Berkeley flew on 5 March 1925.|$|E
25|$|The Epsilon {{is a low}} winged {{cantilever}} monoplane of all metal construction. It {{is powered}} by a Lycoming O-540 flat-six piston engine driving a <b>two-blade</b> <b>propeller,</b> and is fitted with a retractible nosewheel undercarriage. The pilot and instructor are sat in tandem under a sliding Plexiglas canopy, with cockpit layout designed to aid transition to the Dassault/Dornier Alpha Jet to which French students graduate after completing the Epsilon part of their training syllabus.|$|E
25|$|The wood {{used for}} the {{planking}} varies depending on where in the ship it is laid and what structural purpose it serves: The inner layer is Scots pine while the 6-inch skin is made of pitch pine, Honduras mahogany or oak. The outer hull is made of English Elm and Greenheart. Oak beams run across the hull forming three decks - the lower deck beams are 11inches (27.9cm) square in cross-section and are placed less than three feet (0.9m) apart along the ship's length. Seven transverse bulkheads, also of wood, provide additional strength and ensured that any flooding caused by ice damage would not flood the entire ship. To prevent damage from ice floes or crushing the <b>two-blade</b> <b>propeller</b> could be hoisted {{out of the way}} and the rudder could be easily detached and stored aboard. Iron-shod bows were severely raked so that when ramming the ice they would ride up over the margin and crush the ice with deadweight. The coal bunkers on each side contained a steel tank, each of which could hold 60 tons of fresh water. On the long ocean trip to and from New Zealand these tanks could hold additional coal but for the Antarctic voyage the extra water capacity was more important. The metal tanks also contributed to the strength of the lower hull around the boiler and engine spaces.|$|E

2500|$|The Hispano drove a <b>two-blade</b> <b>propeller</b> with {{a pointed}} spinner; it was cooled by a {{rectangular}} radiator {{on each side}} of the fuselage between the wings. [...] The fuselage was flat sided with rounded decking, tapering aft to the mid-mounted tailplane, where the vertical tail was broad and low. [...] The Š-14 landed on a fixed conventional tailskid undercarriage.|$|E
2500|$|... had {{a rather}} abrupt, {{dome-shaped}} nose housing the [...] Hispano-Suiza 8Fb water-cooled V-8 engine and its [...] turbo-supercharger. The engine was mounted with its output shaft low down in the nose and drove a <b>two-blade</b> <b>propeller.</b> [...] Though this was of the wooden, fixed-pitch type, it was intended {{that it would be}} replaced by a variable-pitch Lavasseur airscrew later. A single, roughly cylindrical Lamblin radiator was suspended below the engine, between the undercarriage legs.|$|E
2500|$|A mixed-construction low-wing {{cantilever}} monoplane with {{a conventional}} tailunit. A fuselage {{was made of}} steel frame, canvas covered. Three-part wing, outer parts of wings and tail surfaces were wooden, plywood covered. Wings were folding rearwards. The pilot and three passengers had an enclosed cabin, well glazed. The plane had a fixed tailskid landing gear, wheels had teardrop covers (removed during the Challenge contest due to weight). Wings were fitted with slats and flaps. Useful load was [...] 490kg. Engine in front, with <b>two-blade</b> <b>propeller.</b> Fuel tank 230 l.|$|E

5000|$|FY-Y6 Scorpion Copter is a trirotor, {{and each}} rotor is {{propelled}} by {{two pairs of}} <b>two-blade</b> <b>propellers</b> in coaxial configuration. Specification: ...|$|R
2500|$|It was {{powered by}} a Pobjoy R seven-cylinder radial engine; the <b>two-blade</b> <b>propeller</b> was driven via spur gears that reduced its speed and placed the output shaft above the engine centre, an unusual {{arrangement}} for a radial. [...] The cabin was under the wing with a deep starboard-side access door and multi-panel glazing. The fuselage tapered aft, with the tailplane set halfway up it, and its fin and rudder together were almost triangular apart from a rounded tip. The Multipro's conventional undercarriage was fixed, with the mainwheels on V-struts attached to the lower longerons and stabilized laterally by an inverted V-strut jointed at the fuselage central underside.|$|E
2500|$|The Š-3's upright inline {{engine was}} {{completely}} enclosed within a cowling, with its top {{just below the}} pilot's eye line. It drove a <b>two-blade</b> <b>propeller</b> with a domed spinner. [...] The BMW was cooled with Lamblin cylindrical radiators placed between the undercarriage legs, though a diagram shows it with narrow, fuselage-hugging (cheek) radiators. The oval cross-section fuselage tapered rearwards behind the cockpit to a straight tapered tailplane and divided elevators with a cutout for rudder movement; the latter was mounted on a circular-edged fin and had its bottom cropped for elevator clearance. [...] The Š-3 had a fixed, single-axle conventional undercarriage, with mainwheels on cross-braced V-struts.|$|E
2500|$|The Nie 31 was {{powered by}} a [...] Le Rhone 9R nine-cylinder rotary engine, {{smoothly}} and completely cowled. It drove a <b>two-blade</b> <b>propeller.</b> [...] The fuselage, {{like that of the}} earlier Nieuport Nie 29, was a smooth wooden monocoque shell of tulipwood, produced by winding thin spiral strips around a mould in a series of alternately handed layers and glueing them together. [...] It tapered to the rear, where an almost delta-shaped tailplane was mounted at mid-height, carrying horn-balanced elevators. The fin was much less broad, with a straight-edged, balanced rudder extending down between the elevators below the lower fuselage, where there was a small dorsal fin.|$|E

2500|$|The Pensuti had {{a simple}} {{rectangular}} cross-section fuselage, with the open cockpit at the wing trailing edge. A three cylinder, inverted Y configuration Anzani air-cooled engine of 26kW (35hp) {{in the nose}} drove a <b>two-blade</b> <b>propeller.</b> [...] The triplane had a fixed undercarriage of wide track, with a single wheel {{at each end of}} a single axle with its extremities attached to extensions of the outer interplane struts. [...] Its cruciform tail had horizontal surfaces mounted {{on the top of the}} fuselage; the vertical surface was trapezoidal and extended equally above and below the fuselage. A small tailskid was carried on its lower tip.|$|E
2500|$|The {{engine of}} the 1919 {{aircraft}} was also a Potez design, the [...] A-4. [...] This was a four-cylinder inline built to run with its crankshaft vertical. [...] It was mounted with its exposed cylinders pointing forwards for cooling and had gearing that turned the output through 90° to drive a <b>two-blade</b> <b>propeller.</b> Although the Potez A-4 was unsuccessful, its configuration produced the high power line and low centre of gravity of later inverted inline engines, allowing a shorter undercarriage, easier access to the cockpits and a better forward view over a shorter, lower nose than its inline contemporaries. [...] The high propeller shaft also allowed a shorter undercarriage; a four-wheeled unit protected the propeller tips from contact with the ground.|$|E
2500|$|The two beams {{were covered}} in smooth Alferium; behind the wing they were inverted, convex teardop-shaped in section and tapered to the tail. [...] At the front, each had a [...] Lorraine-Dietrich 12Db {{water-cooled}} 12-cylinder upright V-12 engine driving a <b>two-blade</b> <b>propeller.</b> The radiators were placed {{on both sides of}} the cowlings, and the fuel tanks were in the booms behind the engines, seen as a relatively safe place in case of attack. Each main wheel of the wide track, tailskid undercarriage was rubber-sprung on a V strut enclosed by a bulged and tapered continuous extension of the boom underside. At the rear the booms were linked by a rectangular tailplane carrying a single elevator. [...] The booms mounted small fins with deep, balanced rudders.|$|E
25|$|O-9: One O-2 {{refitted}} {{with the}} 500hp (373kW) Packard 3A-1500 geared engine. It resembled the O-7 {{but had a}} four- rather than <b>two-bladed</b> <b>propeller.</b> It later became an O-2A.|$|R
50|$|The M.26 was {{powered by}} a 100 hp (45 kW) Siemens Sh 11 radial engine, mounted uncowled with the seven {{cylinder}} heads protruding for cooling. It drove a <b>two-bladed</b> <b>propeller.</b>|$|R
25|$|Only two Jupiters were built. The first, {{designated}} 360-4 {{and initially}} registered as F-WLKE had two 200hp (150kW) Lycoming IO-360-A1A engines driving <b>two-bladed</b> <b>propellers</b> and was configured as a 4-5 seater.|$|R
2500|$|The {{fuselage}} of the Shark {{is formed}} with integral fin, seat backs, floors and instrument panel. [...] The fin, set forward so the rudder trailing edge {{is above the}} elevator hinge line, is shaped like a shark's back fin, strongly swept and with a curved leading edge. There is also a small ventral fin. From the fin forward the upper fuselage line rises rapidly to merge into that of the side hinged, single piece canopy. There is a big baggage space behind the cockpit. Both of the adjustable tandem seats have flight controls; the Shark is flown by a sidestick. It {{is powered by a}} [...] Rotax 912ULS or [...] Rotax 914 turbocharged powerplant, driving a three-blade or a <b>two-blade</b> <b>propeller.</b> The Shark UL has retractable gear and a variable-pitch propeller.|$|E
2500|$|The square-section, rounded-cornered {{fuselage}} {{was built}} around these four longerons {{and a set}} of diagonally braced formers. [...] The Aviméta's [...] Hispano-Suiza 12Hb water-cooled V-12 engine was in a pointed nose, driving a <b>two-blade</b> <b>propeller.</b> [...] There were two open cockpits, with the pilot forward at mid-chord and the gunner/observer behind in line with the trailing edge. [...] Behind the cockpits the fuselage tapered rapidly in profile to a conventional empennage, with the tailplane mounted at mid-fuselage. [...] Both horizontal and vertical surfaces were strongly tapered, particularly on the leading edges, with a broad tailplane and fin but with small, inset elevators and rudder. The Aviméta 88 had independent bungee-sprung wheels on legs enclosed in tapered trouser fairings attached to the lower longerons {{at the bottom of the}} wing struts.|$|E
2500|$|The wooden {{monocoque}} fuselage {{was equally}} refined and polished, its oval section tapering towards the tail. [...] Towards the nose the fuselage flattened {{to accommodate the}} three four-cylinder blocks of its 340kW (450hp) W-12 Hispano-Suiza 12Gb engine, driving a low-set <b>two-blade</b> <b>propeller</b> with a large spinner. [...] This was water-cooled, with under-wing radiators from the root to half span, assisted by a single ventral radiator just aft of the undercarriage. [...] The fixed, tricycle undercarriage had unfaired single mainwheels on a single axle, attached by bungee cord to two flat, faired, tapered legs. These legs were cross-braced with streamlined stays. [...] The open cockpit was at the wing trailing edge. [...] Because the Hispano engine of the V.2 was mounted lower in the nose than the Lorraine-Dietrich, another W-12, of the V.1, the central cylinder bank did not so completely obscure the pilot's forward view.|$|E
50|$|O-9: One O-2 {{refitted}} {{with the}} 500 hp (373 kW) Packard 3A-1500 geared engine. It resembled the O-7 {{but had a}} four- rather than <b>two-bladed</b> <b>propeller.</b> It later became an O-2A.|$|R
