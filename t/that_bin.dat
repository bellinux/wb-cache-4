5|$|In 2005, Saleh engaged several NDS agents infiltrating the Pakistani {{tribal areas}} {{to search for}} bin Laden and other al-Qaeda and Taliban leaders. Several al-Qaeda members could be identified, but it was {{determined}} <b>that</b> <b>Bin</b> Laden {{was not in the}} area. In 2006, Saleh was presented with evidence <b>that</b> <b>bin</b> Laden was living in a major settled area of Pakistan just 20 miles from the town of Abbottabad, Pakistan. He shared the intelligence with former Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf who angrily brushed off the claim, taking no action.|$|E
5|$|According to a U.S. official, in 2004 a {{prisoner}} named Hassan Ghul revealed <b>that</b> <b>bin</b> Laden {{relied on a}} trusted courier known as al-Kuwaiti. Ghul stated that al-Kuwaiti was close to bin Laden as well as Khalid Sheik Mohammed and Mohammed's successor Abu Faraj al-Libbi. Ghul revealed that al-Kuwaiti had not been seen in some time, which led U.S. officials to suspect he was traveling with bin Laden. When confronted with Ghul's account, Mohammed maintained his original story. Abu Faraj al-Libbi was captured in 2005 and transferred to Guantánamo in September 2006. He told CIA interrogators <b>that</b> <b>bin</b> Laden's courier was a man named Maulawi Abd al-Khaliq Jan and denied knowing al-Kuwaiti. Because both Mohammed and al-Libbi had minimized al-Kuwaiti's importance, officials speculated that {{he was part of}} bin Laden's inner circle.|$|E
5|$|December 2001: During {{the opening}} {{stages of the}} war in Afghanistan {{launched}} following the September 11 attacks, the U.S. and its allies believed <b>that</b> <b>bin</b> Laden was hiding in the rugged mountains at Tora Bora.

5|$|A {{debate on}} whether the {{military}} photos {{should or should not}} be released to the public has taken place. Those supporting the release argued that the photos should be considered public records, that the photos are necessary to complete the journalistic record, and that the photos would prove bin Laden's death and therefore prevent conspiracy theories <b>that</b> <b>bin</b> Laden is still alive. Those in opposition to a release of the photos expressed concern that the photos would inflame anti-American sentiment in the Middle East.|$|E

5|$|ISI {{reported}} after questioning {{survivors of}} the raid that there were 17 to 18 people in the compound {{at the time of}} the attack and that the Americans took away one person still alive, possibly a bin Laden son. The ISI said that survivors included a wife, a daughter and eight to nine other children, not apparently bin Laden's. An unnamed Pakistani security official was quoted as saying one of bin Laden's daughters told Pakistani investigators <b>that</b> <b>bin</b> Laden had been captured alive, then in front of family members was shot dead by American forces and dragged to a helicopter.|$|E
5|$|In August 2010, {{a former}} Pakistani {{intelligence}} officer approached the U.S. embassy station chief in Islamabad {{and offered to}} reveal bin Laden's location, {{in return for the}} $25 million reward, according to a retired senior U.S. intelligence official. This story was corroborated by two U.S. intelligence officials speaking to NBC News, and had been previously reported by intelligence analyst Raelynn Hillhouse. The Pakistani official informed U.S. intelligence <b>that</b> <b>bin</b> Laden had been located by Pakistani ISI in 2006, and held under house arrest near Pakistani intelligence and military centers ever since. The official passed polygraph tests, after which the U.S. began local and satellite surveillance of bin Laden's Abbottabad residence.|$|E

5|$|The {{reports of}} bin Laden's death on May 2, 2011, are not universally {{accepted}} despite unreleased DNA testing confirming his identity, bin Laden's twelve-year-old daughter witnessing his death, and a May 6, 2011, al-Qaeda statement confirming his death. The swift burial of bin Laden's body at sea, {{the speed of}} the DNA results, and the decision not to release pictures of the dead body have led to the rise of conspiracy theories <b>that</b> <b>bin</b> Laden had not died in the raid. Some Internet blogs suggested that the U.S. government feigned the raid, and some Internet forums hosted debates over the alleged hoax.|$|E
5|$|On 6 September 2007, eight {{members of}} the team (including five runners dressed as bodyguards) and three hired chauffeurs manned a fake Canadian {{motorcade}} consisting of two motorcycles, two black four-wheel drive vehicles, and a black sedan. The group—including Chas Licciardello dressed as Osama bin Laden, and Julian Morrow—drove the motorcade through the Sydney central business district and breached the APEC security zone. The premise of the stunt was <b>that</b> <b>bin</b> Laden should have been invited to the summit as a world leader, to discuss the War on Terror, with another motive being to test the event's security. The stunt was approved by ABC lawyers under the assumption that the motorcade would be stopped at the first security checkpoint and denied entry.|$|E
25|$|Bin Laden's {{location}} and {{state of health}} were a continuing topic of speculation since his disappearance from Tora Bora. It has become clear {{that most of these}} rumors and speculation were not based on fact. First, rumors surfaced <b>that</b> <b>bin</b> Laden was killed or fatally injured during U.S. bombardments, most notably near Tora Bora, or that he died of natural causes. According to Gary Berntsen, in his 2005 book, , a number of al-Qaeda detainees later confirmed <b>that</b> <b>bin</b> Laden had escaped Tora Bora into Pakistan via an eastern route through snow-covered mountains in the area of Parachinar, Pakistan. The media reported <b>that</b> <b>bin</b> Laden suffered from a kidney disorder requiring him to have access to advanced medical facilities, possibly kidney dialysis. Ayman al-Zawahiri, al-Qaeda's second-in-command and a close bin Laden associate, is a physician and may have provided medical care to bin Laden.|$|E
