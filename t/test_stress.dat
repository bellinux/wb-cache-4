50|$|Levels {{of stress}} can be measured. One way {{is through the}} use of {{psychological}} testing: The Holmes and Rahe Stress Scale is used to rate stressful life events, while the DASS contains a scale for stress based on self-report items. Changes in blood pressure and galvanic skin response can also be measured to <b>test</b> <b>stress</b> levels, and changes in stress levels. A digital thermometer can be used to evaluate changes in skin temperature, which can indicate activation of the fight-or-flight response drawing blood away from the extremities. Cortisol is the main hormone released during a stress response and measuring cortisol from hair will give a 60- to 90-day baseline stress level of an individual. This method of measuring stress is currently the most popular method in the clinic.|$|E

40|$|Bibliography: leaves 135 - 142. Heaving clays are {{partially}} saturated soils {{composed of}} a high fraction of the montmorillonite clay mineral. When exposed to free water they undergo volumetric expansion, which often results in differential movements at the surface and damage to building structures founded on the clay. The economic consequences of such damage is severe. Heaving clay causes in excess of R 100 million damage in South Africa each year, making it the country's most significant problem soil. The best method of dealing with a heaving clay is through appropriate design. This would be facilitated if methods such as finite element analysis were available to designers. The aim of this research project {{was to develop a}} constitutive model for an expansive clay which could be numerically implemented within the finite element method. A review of available literature on expansive clays showed that the heave strain that clay under an applied load will undergo can be expressed in terms of the parameters percent heave and heave pressure. These parameters are influenced by the degree of moisture changes experienced by the soil, and its dry density. Various different methods of establishing the percent heave and heave pressure have been proposed, but the values given by each differ due to the influence of different <b>test</b> <b>stress</b> paths on the results. More detailed examination of the effect of <b>test</b> <b>stress</b> path on the volume of heaving clays was therefore required to resolve the reasons for the differences in the test results, and to give a fuller understanding of the volumetric response of the material for the purposes of developing the constitutive model. Hence a series of laboratory tests was conducted on a clay from Rosebank in the Cape Province to investigate the effect of <b>test</b> <b>stress</b> path on the clay volume...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} study the damage {{mechanism}} under different stress states of aluminum alloy components, two kinds of representative triaxial stress states were adopted, namely notch tensile and pure shear. The results of study showed: During the notch tensile <b>test,</b> <b>stress</b> triaxiality in the least transverse-section was relatively higher. With increasing applied stress, the volume fraction of the microvoid in notch root was increasing constantly. When microvoid volume fraction reached the critical value, the specimen fractured. During the pure shear <b>test,</b> <b>stress</b> triaxiality almost came up to zero, and {{there was almost no}} micro-void but localized shear bands within the specimen. The shear bands resulted from non-uniform deformation constantly under the shear stress. With stress concentrating, the cracks were produced in the shear bands and later coalesced. When the equivalent plastic strain reached the critical value, the specimen fractured. The modified Gurson damage model and the Johnson-Cook model were used to simulate the notch tensile and shear test respectively. Simulated engineering stress-strain curves fit the measured engineering stress-strain curves very well. In addition, the empirical damage evolution equation for the notch specimen was obtained from the experiment data and FEM simulations...|$|E

40|$|The {{mechanical}} failure of optical fibers must be avoided to ensure reliability of fiber-based systems. The first stress event in a fiber’s lifetime is the proof test. The proof test will alter the fiber’s strength distribution for all subsequent processing and applications. Thus {{it is critical}} to know the fiber strength distribution after proof test (post-proof strength distribution). It is generally assumed that the proof test truncates the strength distribution at the proof <b>test</b> <b>stress</b> level. But, many users are concerned because they know that theoretically {{it has been shown that}} after proof test the strength of fiber may be much less than the proof <b>test</b> <b>stress</b> level, and that the minimum post-proof strength is determined only by the unloading rate during the proof test. But this theoretical result is not consistent with historical field data. Historically no one has documented failures stresses below the proof stress level. This dissertation resolves this apparent contradiction by reviewing the theory and conducting a probabilistic assessment. As optical fibers are used more and more in computer and switching gear backplanes, a new potential mechanical reliability problem arises due to the necessar...|$|E

Method- Eleven adolescents with hearing impairment and 65 hearing adolescents, aged 13 - 15, learning at an inclusive school completed the demographic Coping Across Situation Questionnaire, the Test Anxiety Inventory, and a terror-bombing-related stress symptoms questionnaire. Results- Higher levels of <b>test</b> <b>stress</b> and terror-related stress symptoms were found in the adolescents with hearing impairment. They used more avoidant coping and less active coping than the hearing adolescents. Higher use of avoidant coping was related to higher levels of test and terror-related symptoms, internal coping was related to higher <b>test</b> <b>stress</b> only, and active coping was related to lower terror-related symptoms. Conclusions- Identifying and targeting the factors related to developing avoidant coping styles by adolescents with hearing impairment could help them to adopt more efficient coping strategies.
