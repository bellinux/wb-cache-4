5|$|As {{part of the}} U.S. {{national}} defenses, {{to support}} military transport, the National Highway System was expanded with Interstate highways, beginning in 1955, across {{many parts of the}} United States. The wider, multi-lane highways allowed traffic to move at faster speeds, with few or no stoplights on the way. <b>The</b> <b>wide-open</b> spaces along the highways became a basis for numerous billboards showing advertisements.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{this period}} {{represented}} a high point in Galveston's economy. It is {{sometimes referred to as}} the open era or <b>the</b> <b>wide-open</b> era because the business owners and the community made little effort to hide the illegal vice activities. The tourist industry spawned by the illegal businesses helped to offset Galveston's decline as a commercial and shipping center following a devastating hurricane in 1900. However, crackdowns against gambling and prostitution in Texas during the mid-20th century made these businesses increasingly difficult to sustain. By the 1950s, this era of Galveston's history had ended.|$|E

Let Him solve it as seems good to Him." ...|$|R
500|$|Unlike most forts for {{military}} use, the fort {{did not have}} defensive walls or structures when first built; <b>the</b> <b>wide-open</b> area and the available artillery made an enclosed fort unnecessary. The soldiers concentrated on building structures for lodging the men, animals, and equipment. These buildings were {{on the edges of}} a [...] parade ground.|$|E
500|$|The {{season was}} met with {{generally}} positive reviews. Mark Wilson of About.com believed that after the series was [...] "finding its feet," [...] and [...] "looks like a harbinger of the new, more confident Sanctuary," [...] but added [...] "there's still work to be done." [...] He also stated [...] "because of the talents involved, <b>the</b> <b>wide-open</b> concept, and the way it's created, Sanctuary has huge potential. The season 2 premiere is good to great, with a fantastic performance from Tapping and a real escalation of the Cabal threat. Let's hope that the show continues to develop and evolves, like its characters, into the show it's capable of becoming." [...] In a DVD review of the season, Monsters and Critics rated it five out of five, stating that fans [...] "will be very happy" [...] with the season set.|$|E
500|$|The {{alternative}} to 5.Bg3 is 5.Bd2 {{to place the}} bishop on <b>the</b> <b>wide-open</b> diagonal a1–h8, after which [...] "White can expect a safe advantage". Then according to Lalic, delaying the recapture with 5...Bg7 6.Bc3 Nc6 7.e3 Ngxe5 is not correct as White can gain an advantage by 8.h4 or 8.Qh5, so the immediate 5...Nxe5 is better. For some time 6.Bc3 was well considered because Black had problems dealing with various positional threats, but the correct way for Black was found in 5...Nxe5 6.Bc3 Qe7 7.e3 Rg8! 8.Nf3 Nbc6 9.Be2 d6 10.Nd4 Bd7 11.b4 g4 with good counterplay for Black on the kingside. White's efforts then switched to 6.Nf3 to open the e-file, something that Black cannot really avoid, as 6...Bg7 7.Nxe5 Bxe5 8.Bc3 would leave an advantage to White. For example 8...Qe7 9.Bxe5 Qxe5 10.Nc3 d6 11.e3 and Black is {{at a loss for}} an equalising line, White's advantage consisting in his ability to install his knight on the strong d5-square and to attack the weakened Black's kingside with the advance h2–h4. It is better for Black to continue with 6...Nxf3+ 7.exf3 when both 7...h5? and 7...Bg7 would fail to 8.Qe2+, so Black must try 7...d6 8.Qe2+ Be6 instead.|$|E

2500|$|There {{was also}} often an {{emphasis}} on black nationalism. Hip hop scholar Michael Eric Dyson stated, [...] "during {{the golden age of}} hip hop, from 1987 to 1993, Afrocentric and black nationalist rap were prominent", and critic Scott Thill described the time as [...] "the golden age of hip hop, the late '80s and early '90s when the form most capably fused the militancy of its Black Panther and Watts Prophets forebears with <b>the</b> <b>wide-open</b> cultural experimentalism of De La Soul and others". Stylistic variety was also prominent. MSNBC said that in the golden age, [...] "rappers had an individual sound that was dictated by their region and their communities, not by a marketing strategist" [...] and the Village Voice referred to the golden age's [...] "eclecticism".|$|E
2500|$|Further themes {{pointed out}} by critics have {{included}} vengeance, solidarity, home, and redemption. In his review of Mad Max: Fury Road, film critic A. O. Scott wrote: [...] "The themes of vengeance and solidarity, <b>the</b> <b>wide-open</b> spaces and the kinetic, ground-level movement mark Fury Road as a western, and the filmmakers pay tribute to such masters of the genre as John Ford, Budd Boetticher and, not least, Chuck Jones, whose Road Runner cartoons are models of ingenuity and rigor." [...] Similar to the previous Mad Max films, home has been regarded as a central theme in Mad Max: Fury Road as it dominates the motivations of Max, Furiosa, and the Five Wives: his home was destroyed, she was taken from her home, and the wives are {{in search of a}} new home to raise their children. The unity of these characters also harnesses a concern for family, a common theme within Miller's filmography. It also carries the theme of female empowerment.|$|E
2500|$|Use of {{armoured}} forces {{was crucial}} {{for both sides}} on the Eastern Front. Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, involved a number of breakthroughs and encirclements by motorised forces. Its goal according to Führer Directive 21 (18 December 1940) was [...] "to destroy the Russian forces deployed in the West and to prevent their escape into <b>the</b> <b>wide-open</b> spaces of Russia." [...] The Red Army was to be destroyed west of the Dvina and Dnieper rivers, which were about [...] east of the Soviet border, {{to be followed by}} a mopping-up operation. The surprise attack resulted in the near annihilation of the Voyenno-Vozdushnye Sily (VVS, Soviet Air Force) by simultaneous attacks on airfields, allowing the Luftwaffe to achieve total air supremacy over all the battlefields within the first week. On the ground, four German panzer groups outflanked and encircled disorganised Red Army units, while the marching infantry completed the encirclements and defeated the trapped forces. In late July, after 2nd Panzer Group (commanded by Guderian) captured the watersheds of the Dvina and Dnieper rivers near Smolensk, the panzers had to defend the encirclement, because the marching infantry divisions were still hundreds of kilometres to the west.|$|E

40|$|As {{one of the}} {{potential}} source of local government revenue, {{it seems that the}} Local Government Owned Enterprise (Badan Usaha Milik Daerah BUMD) have contributed very little to the whole Local Government Revenue (Pendapatan Asli Daerah). It is also ironic that insofar the existence of BUMD has been much rely on the government regulation and given monopoly in its business. The ambiguous mission of BUMD â€” between an agent of development and a profit center â€” proved to be the main obstacle for its management system. From the strategic management perspective and SWOT analysis, it is found out that BUMD should adopt a turn-around approach, to minimize its weaknesses and try to get maximum benefit of <b>the</b> <b>wide-opened</b> opportunities. <b>The</b> strategic issues to be tackled by the BUMD management are quite complex. But among the most important issues are: the lack of professional human resources, the inflexible organisational structure and the low product or service quality. To address these issues, it is recommended that BUMD would come up with strategic human resource development programs, to apply more adaptive and flat organisational structure, and to adopt Total Quality Management (TQM) system in order to be more responsive to its customers...|$|R
