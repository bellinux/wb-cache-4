The methods used and results reported for the capacity analysis of the network <b>timetable</b> <b>and</b> in particular the main through station since the first feasibility studies in 1994, complementing <b>timetabling</b> <b>and</b> operations research analysis in 1997 until the robustness analysis in {{the scope of the}} stress test simulations are described in detail in order to identify and discuss the critical issues. The shortcomings of the original approach consisting of a periodic network timetable design, queuing models for the estimation of the waiting probability and queue length for the purpose of <b>timetabling</b> <b>and</b> estimation of the operations quality respectively, as well as multiple stochastic simulations are explained and the consistency of the recent stress test simulations are examined. </p...|$|R
