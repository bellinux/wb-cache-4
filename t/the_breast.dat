5|$|Brachytherapy {{for breast}} or skin cancer may cause scar tissue to form around the {{treatment}} area. In {{the case of}} breast brachytherapy, fat necrosis may occur {{as a result of}} fatty acids entering <b>the</b> <b>breast</b> tissues. This can cause <b>the</b> <b>breast</b> tissue to become swollen and tender. Fat necrosis is a benign condition and typically occurs 4â€“12 months after treatment and affects about 2% of patients.|$|E

50|$|Anisomastia is {{a medical}} {{condition}} {{in which there is}} a severe asymmetry or unequalness in the size of <b>the</b> <b>breasts,</b> generally related to a difference in volume. In other words, when one of <b>the</b> <b>breasts</b> is much larger than the other. In contrast to anisomastia, a slightly asymmetry of <b>the</b> <b>breasts</b> is common. Anisomastia may be corrected by surgical breast augmentation or reduction.|$|R

5|$|A {{medical report}} {{documented}} that wearing an underwire bra in the Tropics, specifically East Africa, {{can lead to}} severe furuncular myiasis of <b>the</b> <b>breast</b> caused by the Tumbu fly. The eggs and larvae from this fly are deposited in clothing, especially {{along the length of}} the metal wires of an underwire bra, and can only be killed by applying heat through ironing. It is almost impossible when ironing a traditional underwire bra to achieve the required heat to kill the larvae deposited along the underwire.|$|E
5000|$|Engorgement usually {{happens when}} <b>the</b> <b>breasts</b> switch from {{colostrum}} to mature milk (often {{referred to as}} when the milk [...] "comes in"). However, engorgement can also happen later if lactating women miss several nursings and not enough milk is expressed from <b>the</b> <b>breasts.</b> It can be exacerbated by insufficient breastfeeding and/or blocked milk ducts. When engorged <b>the</b> <b>breasts</b> may swell, throb, and cause mild to extreme pain.|$|R
25|$|At menopause, <b>breast</b> atrophy occurs. <b>The</b> <b>breasts</b> can {{decrease}} in size when {{the levels of}} circulating estrogen decline. The adipose tissue and milk glands also begin to wither. <b>The</b> <b>breasts</b> can also become enlarged from adverse side effects of combined oral contraceptive pills. The size of <b>the</b> <b>breasts</b> can also increase and {{decrease in}} response to weight fluctuations. Physical changes to <b>the</b> <b>breasts</b> are often are recorded in the stretch marks of the skin envelope; they can serve as historical indicators of the increments and the decrements of the size and volume of a woman's <b>breasts</b> throughout <b>the</b> course of her life.|$|R
50|$|Another {{technique}} {{is to put}} a rope around the torso just above <b>the</b> <b>breasts,</b> and another one just below them, then push the ropes together to squeeze <b>the</b> <b>breasts</b> from <b>the</b> top and bottom. This can be done instead of, or as well as, the other method. A rope can also be passed over the shoulders and between <b>the</b> <b>breasts,</b> drawing <b>the</b> rope above and below <b>the</b> <b>breasts</b> together, then pass back over the shoulders to the knots at the back. The primary rope {{can be used to}} place cinches between the arms and the body.|$|R
5|$|A {{number of}} authors {{have noted that}} the two explanations, as a {{chemical}} defence against predators and as a chemical defence against ectoparasites, are not mutually exclusive, and evidence for both explanations exists. The fact that the highest concentrations of toxins are bound in the feathers of <b>the</b> <b>breast</b> and belly, in both pitohuis and ifrits, has caused scientists {{to suggest that the}} toxins rub off on eggs and nestlings providing protection against predators and nest parasites.|$|E

5|$|Procellariids {{generally}} have weak legs that are set back, and many species move around on land by resting on <b>the</b> <b>breast</b> and pushing themselves forward, {{often with the}} help of their wings. The exception to this is the two species of giant petrel, which like the albatrosses, have strong legs used to feed on land (see below). The feet of shearwaters are set far back on the body for swimming and are of little use when on the ground.|$|E
50|$|Making {{cleavage}} appear {{deeper and}} <b>the</b> <b>breasts</b> look fuller alongside the cleavage using makeup is achieved using shading effects. The {{middle of the}} cleavage is made to look deeper by using a darker makeup colour than the base colour of the skin in a vertical line between <b>the</b> <b>breasts,</b> while <b>the</b> most prominent areas of <b>the</b> <b>breasts</b> (either side of the cleavage) are made to look larger or more protruding {{by the use of}} a paler colour. Sometimes, the darker shade is extended in a Y shape to add further emphasis to the roundness of the top of <b>the</b> <b>breasts.</b>|$|R
50|$|During the menstrual cycle, <b>the</b> <b>breasts</b> are {{enlarged}} by premenstrual {{water retention}} and temporary growth. During pregnancy, <b>the</b> <b>breasts</b> become enlarged and denser (firmer) {{because of the}} prolactin-caused organ hypertrophy. This begins <b>the</b> production of <b>breast</b> milk, increases <b>the</b> size of the nipples, and darkens the skin color of the nipple-areola complex. These changes continue during the lactation and breastfeeding periods. Afterwards, <b>the</b> <b>breasts</b> generally revert to their pre-pregnancy size, shape, and volume, but might show stretch marks.|$|R
2500|$|When corsets became unfashionable, {{brassieres}} and padding {{helped to}} project, display and emphasize <b>the</b> <b>breasts.</b> In 1893, New Yorker Marie Tucek {{was granted a}} patent for a [...] "breast supporter," [...] described as a modification of the corset, and was very similar to a modern push-up bra designed to support <b>the</b> <b>breasts.</b> It consisted of a plate made of metal, cardboard or other stiff material shaped to fit against the torso under <b>the</b> <b>breasts,</b> following <b>the</b> contour of <b>the</b> <b>breasts.</b> It was covered with silk, canvas or other cloth, which extended above the plate to form a pocket for each <b>breast.</b> <b>The</b> plate curved around the torso and ended near the armpits.|$|R
5|$|Sebaceous glands {{are also}} found in hairless areas (glabrous skin) of the eyelids, nose, penis, labia minora, the inner mucosal {{membrane}} of the cheek, and nipples. Some sebaceous glands have unique names. Sebaceous glands on the lip and mucosa of the cheek, and on the genitalia, are known as Fordyce spots, and glands on the eyelids are known as meibomian glands. Sebaceous glands of <b>the</b> <b>breast</b> are also known as Montgomery's glands.|$|E
5|$|Since ancient times, the mallard {{has been}} eaten as food. The wild mallard was eaten in Neolithic Greece. Usually, only <b>the</b> <b>breast</b> and thigh meat is eaten.

5|$|The Eurasian rock pipit's {{subspecies}} Anthus petrosus littoralis {{in summer}} plumage is particularly close in outward appearance {{to the water}} pipit. The rock pipit normally has a bluer tint to the head, streaking on <b>the</b> <b>breast</b> and flanks, and buff outer tail feathers, and the songs are also different. The species mostly occupy different habitat types even when they occur in the same general area.|$|E
5|$|The red wattlebird begins {{moulting}} {{after the}} breeding season, {{starting with the}} primary flight feathers in November or December and finishing between the following March and May.

5|$|The {{scaly-breasted munia}} or spotted munia (Lonchura punctulata), {{known in the}} pet trade as nutmeg mannikin or spice finch, is a sparrow-sized estrildid finch native to {{tropical}} Asia. A species of the genus Lonchura, it was formally described and named by Carl Linnaeus in 1758. Its name {{is based on the}} distinct scale-like feather markings on <b>the</b> <b>breast</b> and belly. The adult is brown above and has a dark conical bill. The species has 11 subspecies across their range and differ slightly in size and colour.|$|E

5|$|There {{are also}} devices that combine the {{features}} of interstitial and intracavitary breast brachytherapy (e.g. SAVI). These devices use multiple catheters but are inserted through a single-entry point in <b>the</b> <b>breast.</b> Studies suggest {{the use of multiple}} catheters enables physicians to target the radiation more precisely.|$|E
5|$|Underwire bras can rub and pinch <b>the</b> <b>breast,</b> causing skin {{irritation}} and breast pain, and the wire of a worn bra can protrude from the fabric and scrape or cut the skin. When {{the fabric of}} worn bra exposes an underwire, skin contact with nickel and other metals may cause contact dermatitis in a few women.|$|E
5|$|Underwire bras, {{like other}} constrictive garments, may {{contribute}} to clogged milk ducts in lactating women. Fluctuating breast size during pregnancy poses another problem. Because underwire bras are rigid, they do not easily accommodate changes in breast size, and an ill-fitting bra that {{does not support the}} breasts correctly can cause discomfort and pain. For several days after a mastectomy, or as long as <b>the</b> <b>breast</b> is tender, a woman is advised not to use an underwire bra.|$|E
50|$|Sometimes, breast bondage is {{combined}} with other bondage techniques. For example, the woman's arms can be tied behind her back, in an elbow or box tie or in a reverse prayer position. When combined with breast bondage, bound arms force the woman's chest and breasts to protrude further. When combining breast and arm bondage, the ropes can draw the ropes above and below <b>the</b> <b>breasts</b> together at <b>the</b> sides of <b>the</b> <b>breasts</b> as they pass under the shoulders and behind the neck, thus resulting in rope effectively surrounding <b>the</b> <b>breasts.</b>|$|R
50|$|Cleavage {{enhancing}} bras {{are most}} {{commonly referred to}} as push-up bras. They vary in design from unpadded designs which simply push <b>the</b> <b>breasts</b> towards each other through to moulded cup designs with large moulded pads in the bottom and outside of the cups to force <b>the</b> <b>breasts</b> upwards and inwards.|$|R
50|$|A {{preventive}} mastectomy or prophylactic mastectomy is {{an elective}} operation to remove <b>the</b> <b>breasts</b> so that <b>the</b> risk of <b>breast</b> cancer is reduced.|$|R
