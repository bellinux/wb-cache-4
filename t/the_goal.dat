This area {{has a number of}} functions, the most prominent being to mark where the goalkeeper may handle the ball and where a penalty foul {{by a member of the}} defending team becomes punishable by a penalty kick. Other markings define the position of the ball or players at kick-offs, goal kicks, penalty kicks and corner kicks.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Contradictions in {{requirements}} are inevitable in early project stages. To resolve these contradictions, {{it is necessary}} to know <b>the</b> rationale (<b>goals)</b> that lead to the particular requirements. In early project stages one stakeholder rarely knows <b>the</b> <b>goals</b> of <b>the</b> others. Sometimes the stakeholders cannot explicitly state even their own <b>goals.</b> Thus, <b>the</b> <b>goals</b> have to be elaborated in the process of requirements elicitation and negotiation. This paper shows how <b>the</b> <b>goals</b> can be derived by systematic analysis of stakeholders dialogs. <b>The</b> derived <b>goals</b> have to be presented to the stakeholders for validation. Then, when <b>the</b> <b>goals</b> are explicitly stated and validated, it becomes easier to resolve requirements contradictions. ...|$|R

His effort proved to be unsuccessful, as the ball hit the left-hand post and bounced off <b>the</b> <b>goal.</b> Şükür became the next player to take Galatasaray's spot kick. He scored as he lobbed the ball in the right-hand corner. With Galatasaray leading 2–0, Arsenal's next penalty taker was Parlour. He placed the ball on the spot and successfully scored by burying the ball to Taffarel's right to make it 2–1. Ümit Davala calmly placed <b>the</b> <b>goal,</b> near the centre of <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> to make it 3–1 to Galatasaray.

40|$|The {{notion of}} agent's goals {{is crucial in}} {{negotiation}} dialogues. In fact, during a negotiation, each agent tries to make and to accept the offers which satisfy its own goals. Works on negotiation suppose that an agent has a set of fixed goals to pursue. However, it is not shown how <b>the</b> <b>goals</b> are computed and chosen by the agent. Moreover, these works handle one kind of goals: the ones that an agent wants to achieve. Recent studies on psychology claim that goals are bipolar and {{there are at least}} two kinds of goals: <b>the</b> positive <b>goals</b> representing what <b>the</b> agent wants to achieve and <b>the</b> negative <b>goals</b> representing what <b>the</b> agent rejects.
