5|$|Due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>flat</b> {{topography}} of Essex County, the land use surrounding Highway77 {{is almost entirely}} agricultural. Soil conditions in Essex are ideal for farming, {{and as a result}} very few natural areas {{can be found in the}} county. Many streams have been diverted to irrigate the endless farmland to either side of the highway. Relief from the plain is provided only by the few hamlets along the route. In addition, Lake Erie and Lake St Clair are both a short distance from Highway 77.|$|E
5|$|Contrary <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>flat</b> {{appearance}} of the loudspeaker, all three panels are slightly curved along the vertical axis to improve quality. The panels themselves are flat, but obtain their curvature by being slightly bent to a curved backing. With the bipolar nature of the speaker emitting sound from both front and back surfaces as it does, {{the application of a}} felt sheet {{to the rear of the}} panels damps and absorbs high frequencies radiating from the back. A crossover network, set at 500Hz, remains necessary to adjust for back-to-front interference causing loss in output at low frequencies. In addition, the speaker should stand in free space to achieve optimum sound. The instructions book contains advice against placement of the speaker in corners or positions close to or parallel with walls, and further explains that a corner placement will adversely affect bass response and be detrimental to the midrange because of standing waves generated.|$|E

60|$|The telegraphic {{importance}} of <b>the</b> <b>Flats</b> consisted in <b>the</b> {{fact that it}} was the starting point of three telegraph lines to remote trading posts up North. Not many messages came therefrom, but the few that did come generally amounted to something worth while. Days and even weeks would pass without a single one being clicked <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Flats.</b> Carey was debarred from talking over <b>the</b> wires <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Prince Albert man for the reason that they were on officially bad terms.

5|$|The Santa Ana {{drainage}} basin has {{a diversity of}} terrain, ranging from high peaks of inland mountains {{in the north and}} east, to the hot, dry interior and semi-desert basins of the Inland Empire, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>flat</b> coastal plain of Orange County. Although it includes areas of alpine and highland forest, the majority of the watershed consists of arid desert and chaparral environments. Due to low regional rainfall, the river carries only a small flow except during the brief winter season, when it is prone to massive flash floods. The San Jacinto River, which drains the southern half of the watershed, rarely reaches the Santa Ana except in extremely wet years. However, a wide variety of animal and plant communities depend on the riparian zones and remnant wetlands along the Santa Ana River.|$|E
5|$|The {{house on}} Hadley Common was a citadel of riotous insolvency—not just at Christmas but every weekend. There {{was a great}} sense of {{in-depth}} back-up, a cellar, a barrel of malt whisky, a walk-in larder: proof against snowstorm or shutdown. I think it was that Christmas morning , that all four Amises, with breakfast trays on their laps, watched Journey to the Centre of the Earth—then the visit to the pub, then the day-long, the week-long lunch. And with Kingsley the hub of all humour and high spirits, like an engine of comedy... I felt so secure in that house—and, clearly, so insecure elsewhere—that I always experienced a caress of apprehension as I climbed into the car on Sunday night, any Sunday night, and headed back to the motorway and Monday, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>flat</b> or the flatlet, the street, the job, the tramp dread, the outside world.|$|E
5|$|Using Iraqi passports, Oan {{and three}} {{other members of the}} DRFLA arrived in London on 31 March 1980 and rented a flat in Earls Court. They claimed they had met by chance on the flight. The men {{typically}} returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>flat</b> drunk, late at night, and sometimes accompanied by prostitutes. Within a week, the housekeeper asked them to leave. They soon found another flat, where they told their new landlord they were moving because they had been joined by other men and required larger accommodation. Over the following days, the group swelled, with up to a dozen men in the flat on one occasion.|$|E

5|$|In 1859, six guns, four 12-pounders and two 12-pound carronades, were {{installed}} on the bastion, and four years later, five 32-pounders were mounted on the fortification. The earliest defences of {{the southern end of}} the city of Gibraltar included the 16th century Charles V Wall, Flat Bastion, South Bastion, Southport Gate, and Southport Ditch. The complex of defences also included Southport Ditch which was depicted in the 1627 map of Gibraltar by Spanish engineer Luis Bravo de Acuña. On that map which is held by the British Museum, the ditch is shown as a Fosso south of Southport Gate. It was a large trench which extended from the southwestern aspect of the 16th century South Bastion <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Flat</b> Bastion at Prince Edward's Gate. The width of the ditch is now indicated by that of Ragged Staff Gates, which initially served as a water gate. By the late 19th century, the ditch was utilised as an ordnance depot, with a magazine constructed in the 1880s. However, by the early 20th century, that same magazine was used as a pump house. After World War I and reclamation of land, the Ragged Staff Gates were opened to vehicular traffic. Gibraltar's Sunken Gardens, a 19th-century market garden, were a remnant of the western portion of the Southport Ditch, and were filled in at the time of the 1967 Referendum Gate. Trafalgar Cemetery represents an eastern remnant of the ditch.|$|E
5|$|In Sarasota County, the {{flooding}} closed several roads {{and led to}} many overflown creeks and rivers, including the Horse Creek which crested at 5.8feet (1.8m) above flood level. Damage to roads and bridges totaled about $1million. Due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>flat</b> landscape of the region, {{the flooding}} persisted for several days. The depression spawned a tornado in a mobile home park in Nokomis, destroying the roofs of fivehomes and causing leaks in twelveothers. Throughout the area, {{the passage of the}} depression left about 45,000customers without power, primarily due to gusty winds. The outages were fairly short-lived due to power companies calling in extra workers to restore the power. Moderate winds toppled a construction crane at the northern end of the Sunshine Skyway Bridge, closing the bridge for 35minutes before the crane was removed. In Pinellas County, a man hydroplaned while driving along a flooded roadway; he crashed into a concrete pole and was killed. Severe crop damage to orange trees was reported in association with the flooding. Damage from the depression totaled over $2.6million (1992USD, $4million 2008USD), with about4,000houses affected by the flooding and an additional 70destroyed. Twopeople were killed in Florida.|$|E

5|$|Morris became {{increasingly}} {{fascinated with the}} idyllic Medievalist depictions of rural life {{which appeared in the}} paintings of the Pre-Raphaelites, and spent large sums of money purchasing such artworks. Burne-Jones shared this interest, but took it further by becoming an apprentice to one of the foremost Pre-Raphaelite painters, Dante Gabriel Rossetti; the three soon became close friends. Through Rossetti, Morris came to associate with poet Robert Browning, and the artists Arthur Hughes, Thomas Woolner, and Ford Madox Brown. Tired of architecture, Morris abandoned his apprenticeship, with Rossetti persuading him to take up painting instead, which he chose to do in the Pre-Raphaelite style. Morris aided Rossetti and Burne-Jones in painting the Arthurian murals at Oxford Union, although his contributions were widely deemed inferior and unskilled compared to those of the others. At Rossetti's recommendation, Morris and Burne-Jones moved in together <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>flat</b> at Bloomsbury's No. 17 Red Lion Square by November 1856. Morris designed and commissioned furniture for the flat in a Medieval style, much of which he painted with Arthurian scenes in a direct rejection of mainstream artistic tastes.|$|E
