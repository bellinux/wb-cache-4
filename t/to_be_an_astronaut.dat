40|$|JPL {{is funded}} by Code U to develop a Miniature QMSA for an EVA flight test. The initial intent <b>was</b> <b>to</b> fly <b>an</b> {{experiment}} internal to the <b>astronaut</b> suit during <b>a</b> shuttle EVA. Following discussions with JSC the suit application was abandoned in favor of other more urgent needs. The JSC EVA office was particularly interested in hydrazine detection on the astronaut suit. While discussing and exploring the implementation of such an experiment, managers at JSC suggested combining the interests of two JSC groups. The Life Support and Thermal Systems Branch, Crew and Thermal Systems Division {{has a need for}} an ammonia detection instrument, while the EVA office has a need for hydrazine detection.

Instead, the JPL QMSA offers a single instrument solution via <b>a</b> portable instrument <b>to</b> <b>be</b> used by <b>an</b> <b>astronaut</b> on <b>an</b> EVA.

40|$|Looking {{ahead to}} the human {{exploration}} of Mars, NASA is planning for exploration of near-Earth asteroids and the Martian moons. Performing tasks near the surface of such low-gravity objects will likely {{require the use of}} an updated version of the Manned Maneuvering Unit (MMU) since the surface gravity is not high enough to allow astronauts to walk, or have sufficient resistance to counter reaction forces and torques during movements. The extravehicular activity (EVA) Jetpack device currently under development is based on the Simplified Aid for EVA Rescue (SAFER) unit and has maneuvering capabilities to assist EVA astronauts with their tasks. This maneuvering unit has gas thrusters for attitude control and translation. When EVA astronauts are performing tasks that require ne motor control such as sample collection and equipment placement, the current control system will re thrusters to compensate for the resulting changes in center-of-mass location and moments of inertia, adversely affecting task performance. The proposed design of a next-generation maneuvering and stability system incorporates control concepts optimized to support astronaut tasks and adds control-moment gyroscopes (CMGs) to the current Jetpack system. This design aims to reduce fuel consumption, as well as improve task performance for <b>astronauts</b> by providing <b>a</b> sti er work platform. The high-level control architecture for an EVA maneuvering system using both thrusters and CMGs considers an initial assessment of tasks <b>to</b> <b>be</b> performed by <b>an</b> <b>astronaut</b> and <b>an</b> evaluation of the corresponding human-system dynamics. For a scenario in which the <b>astronaut</b> orbits <b>an</b> asteroid, simulation results from the current EVA maneuvering system <b>are</b> compared <b>to</b> those from a simulation of the same system augmented with CMGs, demonstrating that the forces and torques on <b>an</b> <b>astronaut</b> can <b>be</b> significantly reduced with the new control system actuation while conserving onboard fuel...|$|R
40|$|NASA's {{periodic}} {{selection of}} <b>astronauts</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> highly selective process accepting applications {{from the general}} population, wherein the mechanics of selection are not made public. This research <b>was</b> <b>an</b> effort <b>to</b> determine if biases (specifically age) exist in the process and, if so, at which points they might manifest. Two sets of analyses were conducted. The first utilized data requested via the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) on NASA astronaut applicants for the 2009 and 2013 selection years. Using a series of multinomial and logistic regressions, the data <b>were</b> analyzed <b>to</b> uncover whether age of the applicants linearly or nonlinearly affected their likelihood of receiving an invitation, {{as well as their}} likelihood of being selected into the astronaut program. The second used public data on age at selection and age at other career milestones for every astronaut selected from 1959 to 2013 to analyze trends in age over time using ordinary least-squares (OLS) regression and Pearson's correlation. The results for the FOIA data revealed a nonlinear relationship between age and receiving an interview, as well as age and selection into the astronaut program, but the most striking observation was the loss of age diversity at each stage of selection. Applicants younger or older than approximately 40 years were significantly less likely to receive invitations for interviews and were significantly less likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> selected as <b>an</b> <b>astronaut.</b> Analysis of the public-source data for all selections {{since the beginning of the}} astronaut program revealed significant age trends over time including a gradual increase in selectee age and decreased tenure at NASA after last flight, with average age at retirement steady over the entire history of the astronaut program at approximately 48 years...|$|R
