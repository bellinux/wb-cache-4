5|$|The sexes {{are similar}} {{although}} the female has, on average, a greyer head. Young birds resembles the non-breeding adult, but are browner and more streaked above with prominent streaking on the underparts. A. s. coutellii {{is smaller than}} the nominate subspecies and <b>the</b> <b>white</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> outer tail feathers has a hint of grey. It is paler and more heavily streaked above, and in summer plumage the underparts' colour covers a larger area and has a rusty tint. A. s. blakistoni is large, pale and less strongly streaked.|$|E
5|$|The three {{subspecies}} {{also differ}} in their colour. A. m. angolensis has a brown to tawny coat, with thick, dark brown stripes on the face extending two-thirds down to the snout. While the lateral stripe is nearly black, the stripe on the rump is dark brown. The medium brown forehead patch extends to eye level and is separated from the bright white face by a dark brown border. A brown spot is seen on the nose. A. m. hofmeyri is a light fawn, with thin, dark brown face stripes. The stripes on the flanks are dark brown to black, and the posterior stripes are moderately brown. The forehead patch, dark brown or fawn, extends beyond {{the level of the}} eyes and mixes with <b>the</b> <b>white</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> face without any clear barriers. The nose may have a pale smudge. A. m. marsupialis is a rich chestnut brown, with thin, light face stripes. The stripe near the rump is well-marked, and that on the flanks is deep brown. The forehead is brown, fawn, or white, the patch not extending beyond the eyes and having no sharp boundaries. The nose is white or marked with brown.|$|E
25|$|Jaundice, or icterus is yellow {{discoloration}} of {{the skin}} and mucous membranes, (with <b>the</b> <b>white</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eye being especially noticeable) due to increased bilirubin (at least 2–3mg/dL or 30µmol/L). The urine may also appear dark.|$|E

25|$|Manifestations {{may include}} {{enlarged}} spleen and liver, liver malfunction, skeletal disorders or bone lesions {{that may be}} painful, severe neurological complications, swelling of lymph nodes and (occasionally) adjacent joints, distended abdomen, a brownish tint to the skin, anemia, low blood platelet count, and yellow fatty deposits on <b>the</b> <b>white</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eye (sclera).

25|$|Collins told McMurdo Station that {{he would}} be {{dropping}} to , at which point he switched control of the aircraft to the automated computer system. Outside there was a layer of clouds that blended with <b>the</b> <b>white</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> snow-covered volcano, forming a sector whiteout – there was no contrast between the two to warn the pilots. The effect deceived everyone on the flight deck, making them believe that the white mountainside was the Ross Ice Shelf, a huge expanse of floating ice derived from the great ice sheets of Antarctica, which was in fact now behind the mountain. As it was little understood, even by experienced polar pilots, Air New Zealand had provided no training for the flight crew on the sector whiteout phenomenon. Consequently, the crew thought they were flying along McMurdo Sound, when they were flying over Lewis Bay in front of Mt.Erebus.|$|E

50|$|This {{allows for}} an easy {{distinction}} between simple tristimulus-based color models and color appearance models. A simple tristimulus-based color model ignores <b>the</b> <b>white</b> point <b>of</b> <b>the</b> illuminant when it describes <b>the</b> surface color <b>of</b> an illuminated object; if <b>the</b> <b>white</b> point <b>of</b> <b>the</b> illuminant changes, so does <b>the</b> color <b>of</b> <b>the</b> surface {{as reported by the}} simple tristimulus-based color model. In contrast, a color appearance model takes <b>the</b> <b>white</b> point <b>of</b> <b>the</b> illuminant into account (which is why a color appearance model requires this value for its calculations); if <b>the</b> <b>white</b> point <b>of</b> <b>the</b> illuminant changes, <b>the</b> color <b>of</b> <b>the</b> surface as reported by the color appearance model remains the same.|$|R
25|$|Greek temples were {{designed}} and constructed according to set proportions, mostly {{determined by the}} lower diameter of the columns or by {{the dimensions of the}} foundation levels. The nearly mathematical strictness of the basic designs thus reached was lightened by optical refinements. In spite of the still widespread idealised image, Greek temples were painted, so that bright reds and blues contrasted with <b>the</b> <b>white</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building stones or of stucco. The more elaborate temples were equipped with very rich figural decoration in the form of reliefs and pedimental sculpture. The construction of temples was usually organised and financed by cities or by the administrations of sanctuaries. Private individuals, especially Hellenistic rulers, could also sponsor such buildings. In the late Hellenistic period, their decreasing financial wealth, along with the progressive incorporation of the Greek world within the Roman State, whose officials and rulers took over as sponsors, led to the end of Greek temple construction. New temples now belonged to the tradition of Roman architecture, which, in spite of the Greek influence on it, aimed for different goals and followed different aesthetic principles.|$|E
500|$|The {{current flag}} is divided diagonally {{from the lower}} hoist-side corner, with the upper {{triangle}} yellow and the lower triangle orange. Centred along the dividing line is a large black and white dragon facing away from the hoist side. [...] The dragon is holding a norbu, or jewel, in each of its claws. The background colours of the flag, yellow and orange, are identified as Pantone 116 and 165 respectively. Equivalents of these shades and <b>the</b> <b>white</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Druk are specified by various other codes according to particular matching systems as indicated below.|$|E

500|$|The {{current state}} flag of West Virginia {{consists}} of a pure white field bordered on four sides by a stripe of blue. <b>The</b> <b>white</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> field symbolizes purity, while the blue border represents the Union. The center of the state flag is emblazoned with the state's Coat of Arms, a stylized version of the Great Seal of West Virginia. The {{lower half of the}} state flag is wreathed by two tethered swags of Rhododendron maximum, the state flower of West Virginia. Across the top of the state flag is an unfurled red ribbon with the constitutional designation [...] "State of West Virginia", and across the bottom of the state flag is a tied red ribbon with the state's Latin motto Montani Semper Liberi (English: [...] "mountaineers are always free").|$|E

2500|$|The {{rings are}} five {{interlocking}} rings, colored blue, yellow, black, {{green and red}} on a white field, known as the [...] "Olympic rings". [...] The symbol was originally designed in 1912 by Baron Pierre de Coubertin, co-founder of the modern Olympic Games. He appears to have intended the rings to represent the five participating continents: [...] Africa, Asia, America, Australia and Europe. [...] According to Coubertin, {{the colors of the}} rings together with <b>the</b> <b>white</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> background included the colors composing every competing nation's flag at the time.

2500|$|The Italian tricolour, defaced {{with the}} {{coat of arms}} of the House of Savoy, was first adopted as war flag by the Regno di Sardegna-Piemonte (Kingdom of Sardinia-Piedmont) army in 1848.

2500|$|Mother and {{daughter}} stand {{a few meters}} from the sea on an ocher expanse of sand in the foreground at the bottom. Unlike the people depicted, the sand surface is depicted in short strokes. Behind the two women is a seamless transition from the beach to the sea. The perspective of the viewer is slightly raised so that no horizon is visible. Instead, the beach and the sea form a curtain-like background and a curl of white foam [...] rides a wave {{at the top of}} the screen, replacing the horizon. The sea shimmers in different shades of blue, which Sorolla applied in elongated brushstrokes. Before chest of Clotilde the sea has a pale blue color, and behind the backs of the womwn are rather darker shades of blue. Dimly seen, the area to the right of the daughter, where the turquoise surface of the water is difficult to distinguish from the shore. The dominant color of the image is <b>the</b> <b>white</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dress and the parasol. Sorolla has mixed this white, like the French impressionists, with many other colors. So blue, yellow, lilac or orange shades are in the white form the light and shadow effects.|$|E
