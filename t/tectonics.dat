5|$|The early Earth {{during the}} Hadean eon is {{believed}} by most scientists {{to have had}} a Venus-like atmosphere, with roughly 100 bar of CO2 and a surface temperature of 230Â°C, and possibly even sulfuric acid clouds, until about 4.0billion years ago, by which time plate <b>tectonics</b> were in full force and together with the early water oceans, removed the CO2 and sulfur from the atmosphere. Early Venus would thus most likely have had water oceans like the Earth, but any plate <b>tectonics</b> would have ended when Venus lost its oceans. Its surface is estimated to be about 500million years old, so it would not be expected to show evidence of plate <b>tectonics.</b>|$|E
30|$|<b>Tectonic</b> {{diagenesis}} is {{a common}} and important geological phenomenon. We can fully understand the diagenesis of compressional basins through studying <b>tectonic</b> diagenesis. In this paper, we presented the <b>tectonic</b> diagenetic characteristics in the Kuqa area of the Tarim Basin by integrated method of geological analysis and paleotectonic stress. The {{results showed that the}} Mesozoic-Cenozoic <b>tectonic</b> diagenesis affected sandstone compaction evolution mainly through physical mechanisms. It showed characteristics of abrupt change and nonthermal indicator (it means that sandstone compaction can not be explained by thermal diagenetic compaction alone because actual sandstone compaction was larger than thermal compaction), which were different from the thermal and fluid diagenesis. Compared with thermal diagenesis, <b>tectonic</b> diagenesis had a typical <b>tectonic</b> compaction in very short time, and many phases of <b>tectonic</b> deformation showed multiple abrupt changes of compaction. There are obvious differences between <b>tectonic</b> and thermal diagenetic compaction, leading to sandstone compaction being larger than the thermal compaction under the same thermal evolution stage in the areas where <b>tectonic</b> deformation happened. The stronger the <b>tectonic</b> deformation, the more obvious the difference. <b>Tectonic</b> process changed the stress distribution through changing the <b>tectonic</b> deformation styles, resulting in different <b>tectonic</b> diagenesis effects. Therefore, <b>tectonic</b> diagenesis of Mesozoic-Cenozoic in the Kuqa area can be divided into four types including rigid rock restraint, fault ramp, low angle fault slippage, and napping.|$|R
50|$|<b>Tectonic</b> joints are joints {{that formed}} when the {{relative}} {{displacement of the}} joint walls is normal to its plane as the result of brittle deformation of bedrock in response to regional or local <b>tectonic</b> deformation of bedrock. Such joints form when directed <b>tectonic</b> stress causes the tensile strength of bedrock to be exceeded {{as the result of the}} stretching of rock layers under conditions of elevated pore fluid pressure and directed <b>tectonic</b> stress. <b>Tectonic</b> joints often reflect local <b>tectonic</b> stresses associated with local folding and faulting. <b>Tectonic</b> joints occur as both nonsystematic and systematic joints, including orthogonal and conjugate joint sets.|$|R
50|$|When {{numerous}} subsequent compressional <b>tectonic</b> phases {{share the}} same geodynamic cause (usually some plate <b>tectonic</b> mechanism) this is called an orogeny. During an orogeny <b>tectonic</b> phases lead to mountain building, which causes deformation and metamorphism of rocks. In most Phanerozoic orogenies many <b>tectonic</b> phases are distinguished.|$|R

5|$|Two 20th century {{developments}} in geology {{had a big}} effect on paleontology. The first was the development of radiometric dating, which allowed absolute dates to be assigned to the geologic timescale.

5|$|A planet or moon's {{interior}} heat {{is produced}} from the collisions {{that created the}} body, by the decay of radioactive materials (e.g. uranium, thorium, and 26Al), or tidal heating caused by interactions with other bodies. Some planets and moons accumulate enough heat to drive geologic processes such as volcanism and <b>tectonics.</b> Those that accumulate or retain an atmosphere can also undergo surface erosion from wind or water. Smaller bodies, without tidal heating, cool more quickly; and their geological activity ceases {{with the exception of}} impact cratering.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Based on the {{new round}} of {{national}} potential evaluation on coal resources, and reference to the latest achievements about regional geological and energy basins, this article analyzed the main features of North China coalfield structure. According to the main features of North China coalfield structure {{and the distribution of}} North China coal series, the boundary of North China coal-bearing <b>tectonic</b> region and the division of North China coal-bearing <b>tectonic</b> units were identified. North China coalfield <b>tectonic</b> region can be divided into 5 coal-bearing <b>tectonic</b> sub-regions and 22 coal-bearing <b>tectonic</b> zones.

Platinum, for example, comprises approximately 1 part per billion of the crust whereas its concentration in the core {{is thought to be}} nearly 6,000 times higher. Recent speculation suggests that uranium (and thorium) in the core may generate a substantial amount of the heat that drives plate <b>tectonics</b> and (ultimately) sustains the Earth's magnetic field.|$|E
5|$|Enceladus {{is losing}} mass {{at a rate}} of 200kg/second. If mass loss at this rate {{continued}} for 4.5 Gyr, the satellite would have lost approximately 30% of its initial mass. A similar value is obtained by assuming that the initial densities of Enceladus and Mimas were equal. It suggests that <b>tectonics</b> in the south polar region is probably mainly related to subsidence and associated subduction caused by the process of mass loss.|$|E
5|$|In Darwin's global hypothesis, vast {{areas where}} the seabed was being {{elevated}} were marked by fringing reefs, sometimes around active volcanoes, and similarly huge {{areas where the}} ocean floor was subsiding were indicated by barrier reefs or atolls based on inactive volcanoes. These views received general support from deep sea drilling results in the 1980s. His idea that rising land would be balanced by subsidence in ocean areas has been superseded by modern plate <b>tectonics,</b> {{which he did not}} anticipate.|$|E

This protein, named <b>Tectonic,</b> is the founding member of a previously undescribed family of evolutionarily conserved secreted and transmembrane proteins. During neural tube development, mouse <b>Tectonic</b> is required for formation of the most ventral cell types and for full Hedgehog (Hh) pathway activation. Epistasis analyses reveal that <b>Tectonic</b> modulates Hh signal transduction downstream of Smoothened (Smo) and Rab 23.

5|$|Models of the {{evolution}} of the planet's orbit over time suggest that heating resulting from this tidal locking may {{play a major role in}} the planet's geology.

5|$|On average, {{the light}} that Gliese 581d {{receives}} from its star has about 30% of the intensity of light the Earth receives from the Sun. By comparison, sunlight on Mars has about 40% of the intensity of that on Earth. That might {{seem to suggest that}} Gliese 581d is too cold to support liquid water and hence is inhospitable to life. However, an atmospheric greenhouse effect can significantly raise planetary temperatures. For example, Earth's own mean temperature would be about â18Â°C without any greenhouse gases, ranging from around 100Â°C on the day side to â150Â°C at night, much like that found on the Moon. If the atmosphere of Gliese 581d produces a sufficiently large greenhouse effect, and the planet's geophysics stabilize the CO2 levels (as Earth's does via plate <b>tectonics),</b> then the surface temperature might permit a liquid water cycle, conceivably allowing the planet to support life. Calculations by Barnes et al. suggest, however, that tidal heating is too low to keep plate <b>tectonics</b> active on the planet, unless radiogenic heating is somewhat higher than expected.|$|E

40|$|Morphotectonic {{analysis}} {{by the use of}} geomorphic indices serves as a tool of recognition in regions with active <b>tectonic</b> deformation. Landforms in active deformation area are created from interaction of <b>tectonic</b> and surficial processes. One of the most important landforms in ground are rivers that are very sensitive to <b>tectonic</b> movements especially uplift and tilting.

In this article, determine of <b>tectonic</b> movements bye the use of geomorphic indices is surveyed in the Ghezel Ozan River basin between 2007 and 2010. After segmentation of the Ghezel Ozan River and preparation of digital elevation model (DEM) amounts of geomorphic indices per segments is separately attained.

40|$|River {{drainage}} patterns sculpt terrestrial landscapes. Whether {{these patterns}} contain fingerprints of past <b>tectonic</b> events is debated. On the one hand, elaborate dendritic river networks always retain an invariant structure, implying that rivers will simply reorganize {{in response to}} <b>tectonic</b> perturbations, without long-term trace of the <b>tectonic</b> event. On the other hand, many rivers in active mountain belts seem to be passive features and may record long-term crustal deformation. Here we use numerical simulations, constrained by drainage patterns observed in the Southern Alps of New Zealand, to analyse the response of river basins to distributed plate <b>tectonic</b> strain. We find that both dynamically reorganized and passively deformed rivers coexist in the Southern Alps. Rivers {{on the western side}} of the mountain range reorganize and rapidly evolve in response to <b>tectonic</b> deformation. In contrast, rivers on the eastern side resist reorganization and record large-scale plate <b>tectonic</b> influence over timescales of tens of millions of years. We conclude that both types of river drainage pattern in the Southern Alps are primarily controlled by plate <b>tectonic</b> strain, implying that landscape topography can be used to reconstruct the distribution of <b>tectonic</b> strain within zones of continental deformation around the world...|$|R

These canyons can be up to 200km long, 5â10km wide, and 1km deep.
