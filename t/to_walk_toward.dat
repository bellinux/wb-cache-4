25|$|Witnesses dispute this account, {{saying that}} Tabatabainejad had begun <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>toward</b> {{the door with}} his {{backpack}} when an officer approached him and grabbed his arm, whereupon Tabatabainejad told the officer several times to let go.|$|E
6000|$|They began <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>toward</b> the carriage. [...] "Well," [...] said Robert Acton, [...] "it 's {{a curious}} story! How {{did you make}} his acquaintance?" ...|$|E
60|$|As {{they came}} still closer the {{individual}} {{on the bridge}} turned <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>toward</b> them. Suddenly, however, he stopped short and tried his best to hide himself behind some of the steel work.|$|E
50|$|O Great Atat√ºrk ! On {{the path}} that you have paved, I swear <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> incessantly <b>toward</b> the aims that you have set.|$|R
60|$|Hugh stood {{a moment}} on the river's bank, staring at the stream beneath; then he turned and began <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> slowly <b>toward</b> the dead swan.|$|R
60|$|So saying Beechnut went away, leaving Phonny and Stuyvesant together. They {{talked a}} few minutes about the squirrel, and then began <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> along <b>toward</b> the house.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Wetherell, who had {{forgotten}} his own engagement and [...] "Uncle Tom's Cabin," [...] {{said he would}} be happy to come. And they went out together and began <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>toward</b> the State House.|$|E
6000|$|... "You are tired, Maurice, and overwrought. Shall {{we go in}} {{and wait}} for father? He will be getting anxious about me." [...] And without {{waiting to see if}} he {{followed}} her, she turned <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>toward</b> the steps.|$|E
6000|$|Lyra turned <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>toward</b> the house, {{deflecting}} {{a little}} in the direction of her nephew and Miss Northwick. [...] "Jack!" [...] she drawled over the shoulder next them as she passed, [...] "I wish you'd bring your aunty's wrap to her on the piazza." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{we still}} haven't got the brain itself," [...] Gross finished. They began <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> back <b>toward</b> the car. [...] "If {{we can get}} that we'll {{be ready for the}} tests." ...|$|R
60|$|As I strolled up, {{both men}} {{came out of}} the hotel. Wright saw me, and making an almost {{imperceptible}} sign <b>to</b> Sampson, he <b>walked</b> <b>toward</b> me.|$|R
60|$|Motioning her <b>to</b> follow, Tarzan <b>walked</b> <b>toward</b> {{the trees}} {{at the edge of}} the arena, and taking her in one strong arm swung to the {{branches}} above.|$|R
6000|$|There was a silence. Then--"Move on please, gentlemen," [...] {{said the}} sentry, {{and they started}} <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>toward</b> the car line, the lawyer and the Colonel together. Virginia put her hand through the Captain's arm. In the {{darkness}} he laid his big one over it.|$|E
60|$|All {{these matters}} having been agreed upon, Socrates and Pythagoras started <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>toward</b> the eastern {{portion of the}} city where several posting inns were {{situated}} and where they hoped to find the conveyance which they required {{as well as the}} necessary horses. Diogenes on the other hand turned his steps deliberately southwards.|$|E
60|$|Then he, too, followed, {{and quietly}} the little party turned <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>toward</b> the gate. The ramparts {{themselves}} now looked strangely still and silent: the merrymakers were far away, {{only one or}} two passers-by hurried swiftly past here and there, carrying bundles, evidently bent on making use of that welcome permission to leave this dangerous soil.|$|E
6000|$|... "As {{these men}} are evidently coming in quest of me," [...] I remarked, [...] "it may be as well, ladies, for you <b>to</b> {{continue}} your <b>walk</b> <b>toward</b> home, while I wait for them on this stile." ...|$|R
50|$|A {{thunderstorm}} rumbles across Brooklyn, where AC/DC {{is about}} to play. In a bar across the bay and the Brooklyn Bridge, a cameraman spy, nicknamed Super Snoop, walks in from the bar's back door, trying <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> slowly <b>toward</b> the band's dressing room. His job being to get photographs of the band for a local newspaper.|$|R
50|$|The {{sculpture}} depicts Indian {{civil rights}} leader Mahatma Gandhi dressed in traditional attire and walking with a long staff. His head is bald, and his chest, shoulders, and legs are bare. He wears glasses and his gaze is directed toward the path he is walking. He wears sandals. The figure is oriented away from the Courthouse, appearing <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> eastward <b>toward</b> downtown and Lake Michigan.|$|R
6000|$|... "Can {{her aunt}} have induced {{her to come}} to me?" [...] was Lawrence's first thought. But his second was very different, for she began <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>toward</b> the large gate which led out of the yard. Instantly Lawrence rose, and hopped on one foot to the window, where he tapped loudly on the glass. The lady turned, and then he threw up the sash.|$|E
60|$|The crew, who {{had learned}} all these orders {{in the course}} of the {{repeated}} instructions which Forester and Marco had given them, began to rise and <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>toward</b> the bow of the boat and to go ashore. Marco landed first, and held the boat with his boat-hook, while the rest got out. Forester then ordered Marco to make the boat fast, until they were ready to embark again.|$|E
6000|$|... "That is not ex-act-ly true," [...] said Tiktok, {{starting}} <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>toward</b> {{the path}} through the forest, and still holding fast to his prisoner, who rolled slowly along beside him. [...] "You and your peo-ple are full of mis-chief, and like to both-er those who fear you. And you are of-ten im-pu-dent and dis-a-gree-a-ble, too. But if you will try to cure those faults I will not tell any-one how help-less you are." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{you might}} get to see her {{at the edge of}} the Gin and Ginger Woods," [...] he persisted feebly, in a last effort to detain her; [...] "if you'll take a pasear there with me." [...] Flip's only {{response}} was <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> on <b>toward</b> the cabin, whence, with a vague complimentary suggestion of [...] "droppin' in to pass the time o' day" [...] with her father, the Postmaster meekly followed.|$|R
60|$|By and bye he bethought {{himself of}} the time, and took a cab uptown. He had more than the twelve cents in his pocket, now, besides the check book which was {{carefully}} hidden away in an inside pocket; so {{the cost of the}} cab did not worry him. He dismissed the vehicle near an uptown corner and started <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> hastily <b>toward</b> Danny Reeves's restaurant, a block away, Patsy was standing in the doorway, anxiously watching for him.|$|R
60|$|The others {{seemed to}} feel the same {{influence}} in different ways, for the group began to break up in the manner indicated. Morton moved toward the window immediately in front of them, where the hidden outlaw had just snuffed the candle; Nolan, a little farther westward to the next window; while Wilson, followed by Macbride with the ladder, went round to the two windows at the back. Sir Walter Carey himself, followed by his secretary, began <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> round <b>toward</b> the only door, to demand admittance in a more regular fashion.|$|R
60|$|Monsieur Decresson touched Louis on the {{shoulder}} and motioned him to enter the automobile which was waiting. With many bows and solemn salutes the great car swung off and left me there alone. I watched it until it disappeared, and then, turning in the opposite direction, started <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>toward</b> the Ritz. Curiously enough {{it never occurred to me}} to doubt for a moment the assurance which had been given me. I had no longer the slightest fear of arrest.|$|E
60|$|Then she saw Carew kiss Bella {{among the}} cedars {{before she left}} him <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>toward</b> the tent, and the sight stirred her blood. It was clear that she must be on her guard; her guide must be kept firmly at a distance, though this promised to be difficult. She was, to all intents and purposes, pledged to Clarence; and until Bella joined her she tried to fix her {{thoughts}} on him, wondering where he was {{and what he was}} doing, without being able to find much interest in the question.|$|E
6000|$|She turned <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>toward</b> the house, but stopped. [...] "We are {{all here}} to enjoy ourselves, {{and it is}} against the rules to worry each other with puzzles. I {{therefore}} will at once say, in explanation of my name, that I have briefly thrust myself {{into the life of}} my friends; and of my appearance, that the Middle-Aged Man of the Sea, who is a very self-willed person, caused the costume which I ordinarily wear, and in which I arrived, to be abstracted and hidden, so that I am obliged, while here, to wear clothes belonging to others. Now, you see, Mr. Understudy, everything is as plain as daylight." ...|$|E
5000|$|The series' tone is {{somewhat}} {{darker than the}} other Blackadders; it details the deprivations of trench warfare {{as well as the}} incompetence and life-wasting strategies of the top brass. For example, Baldrick is reduced to making coffee from mud and cooking rats, while General Melchett hatches a plan for the troops <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> very slowly <b>toward</b> the German lines, because [...] "it'll be the last thing Fritz will expect." ...|$|R
5000|$|As {{a part of}} Turrell's Space Division Construction series, Acton {{consists}} of two distinct rooms of roughly equal sizes divided by a wall with a rectangular opening. The viewer enters the [...] "sensing space," [...] which is dimly illuminated by tungsten lights aimed at the walls. These low-light conditions lead them to first perceive the opening and the [...] "viewing space" [...] beyond it as a solid grey plane. However, time and closer examination reveal {{the true nature of}} the spaces. Security guards often facilitate this shift in perception by encouraging patrons to [...] "touch" [...] the [...] "painting," [...] going so far as to instruct them <b>to</b> speed <b>walk</b> <b>toward</b> it, making the moment of realization even more startling.|$|R
50|$|Eventually Peterson {{is sent to}} a {{psychiatric}} hospital where he continues to rebel against those charged with the duty of controlling him. In response, Peterson is kept heavily drugged which makes him physically weak. His first escape attempt is merely <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> sluggishly <b>toward</b> the exit until he is calmly thwarted by a staffer standing nearby who waves him into a chair. Later, he decides to escape by earning himself a transfer back to prison. He attempts to strangle another detainee with his socks, but is apprehended before killing the man, which means {{he will not be}} transferred. He comments to the audience that despite all his prison time and solitary confinement, he has never yet killed anyone.|$|R
60|$|A naked bronze arm lighted {{from above}} {{pointed out the}} {{direction}} and Mrs. Travers began <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>toward</b> the featureless black mass of the stockade. When after a few steps she looked back over her shoulder, the lagoon, the beach, the canoe, the men she had just left had become already invisible. She was alone bearing up a blazing torch on an earth that was a dumb shadow shifting under her feet. At last she reached firmer ground and the dark length of the palisade untouched as yet {{by the light of}} the torch seemed to her immense, intimidating. She felt ready to drop from sheer emotion. But she moved on.|$|E
60|$|They {{went to the}} wagon-maker and {{explained}} to him what they wanted. The wagon-maker readily undertook the work. They all {{went down to the}} boat together, to plan the seats and the places for the thole-pins. They concluded to have three pairs on each side. This would require six oars. These oars the wagon-maker promised to make, and to have all the work done {{by the beginning of the}} next week. They also concluded to have the boat taken out of the water and thoroughly calked again, and her bottom payed over with pitch, as she was not perfectly tight. This being all arranged, Forester and Marco began <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>toward</b> home.|$|E
60|$|Alf {{had long}} since ceased to say anything, {{but he knew that}} the {{situation}} was getting dangerous, and that the only thing left to him was to get away. His face was set doggedly, his eyes glinted like points of steel, and his body was firmly and confidently poised. This air of determination sufficiently impressed the boatmen to make them give way before him When he started <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>toward</b> the shore-end of the pier. But they trooped along beside more noisily than ever. One of the youngsters about Alf's size and build, impudently snatched his cap from his head; and before he could put it on his own head, Alf struck out from the shoulder, and sent the fellow rolling on the stones.|$|E
60|$|Egbert {{was curious}} {{to know what the}} reason could be for {{changing}} the plan, and also to hear the story. Still he was extremely disappointed in having to lose his fishing, and very much disposed to be angry with George for not going on. It was, however, difficult to get very angry without knowing George's reason, and George, though he said that the reason was a good one--that it was a serious difficulty in the way of going a-fishing that day, which had only come to his knowledge since they left home, steadily persisted in declining to explain what the difficulty was until the evening, and began slowly <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> back <b>toward</b> the house.|$|R
40|$|SummaryUnlike {{a static}} and {{immobile}} skeleton, the actin cytoskeleton {{is a highly}} dynamic network of filamentous actin (F-actin) polymers that continuously turn over. In addition to generating mechanical forces and sensing mechanical deformation, dynamic F-actin networks serve as cellular tracks for myosin motor traffic. However, much of our mechanistic understanding of processive myosins comes from in¬†vitro studies in which motility was studied on pre-assembled and artificially stabilized, static F-actin tracks. In this work, we examine the role of actin dynamics in single-molecule myosin motility using assembling F-actin and two highly processive motors, myosin- 5 and myosin- 6. These two myosins have distinct functions in the cell and travel in opposite directions along actin filaments [1 ‚Äì 3]. Myosin- 5 <b>walks</b> <b>toward</b> the barbed ends of F-actin, traveling to sites of actin polymerization at the cell periphery [4]. Myosin- 6 <b>walks</b> <b>toward</b> the pointed end of F-actin [5], traveling toward the cell center along older segments of the actin filament. We find that myosin- 5 takes 1. 3 - to 1. 5 -fold longer runs on ADP‚Ä¢Pi (young) F-actin, whereas myosin- 6 takes 1. 7 - to 3. 6 -fold longer runs along ADP (old) F-actin. These results suggest that conformational differences between ADP‚Ä¢Pi and ADP F-actin tailor these myosins <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> farther <b>toward</b> their preferred actin filament end. Taken together, these experiments define a new mechanism by which myosin traffic may sort to different F-actin networks depending on filament age...|$|R
40|$|Redirected Walking, a new {{interactive}} locomotion {{technique for}} virtual environments (VEs), captures {{the benefits of}} real walking while extending the possible size of the VE. Real walking, although natural and producing a high subjective sense of presence, limits virtual environments {{to the size of}} the tracked space. Redirected Walking addresses this limitation by interactively and imperceptibly rotating the virtual scene about the user. The rotation causes the user <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> continually <b>toward</b> the furthest wall of the lab without noticing the rotation. We implemented the technique using stereo graphics and 3 D spatialized audio. Observations during a pilot study suggest that the technique works: Redirected <b>Walking</b> causes people <b>to</b> change their real walking direction without noticing it, allows for larger VEs, and does not induce appreciable simulator sickness. 1...|$|R
