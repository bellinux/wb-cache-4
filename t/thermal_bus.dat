40|$|Abstract: This paper {{proposes a}} novel fast {{computational}} method {{to determine the}} simultaneous power available transfer capability (ATC) in a power system. This method consists of a fast estimation algorithm and a constrained power flow iteration. The ATC limiting factors considered in the method are: line <b>thermal</b> limits, <b>bus</b> voltage limits, and generator reactive power limits. When combined with the first line contingency considerations, this method will give the fastest ATC computing. The feature of this method is that it uses only one steady state power flow result for the fast estimation algorithm. Without further time consuming power flow iterations, it is the fastest estimation algorithm available. Based on the fast estimation, with a few more constrained power flow iterations, precise ATC value can be obtained. This method {{can be used to}} improve the speed of many available ATC programs. Especially, it may be used in addition to the widely used DC power flow program or simply replace it to provide additional voltage and var information, since DC power flow generally ignore voltage or var problems. This method can help the independent system operator (ISO) to determine the validity of the bidding results in an open access deregulated electricity market when timely ATC information is very important.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{growth in}} power demand and the penetration of renewable distributed generations in competitive electricity market demands large and flexible capacity from the transmission grid to reduce transmission bottlenecks. The bottlenecks cause transmission congestion, reliability problems, restrict competition, {{and limit the}} maximum dispatch of low cost generations in the network. The electricity system requires efficient utilization of the current transmission capability to improve the Available Transfer Capability (ATC). To improve the ATC, power flow among the lines can be managed by using Flexible AC Transmission System (FACTS) devices as power flow controllers, which alter the parameters of power lines. It is important to place FACTS devices on suitable lines to vary the reactance for improving Total Transmission Capacity (TTC) of the network and provide flexibility in the power flow. In this paper a transmission network is analyzed based on line parameters variation to improve TTC of the interconnected system. Lines are selected for placing FACTS devices based on real power flow Performance Index (PI) sensitivity factors. TTC is computed using the Repeated Power Flow (RPF) method using the constraints of lines <b>thermal</b> limits, <b>bus</b> voltage limits and generator limits. The reactance of suitable lines, {{selected on the basis}} of PI sensitivity factors are changed to divert the power flow to other lines with enough transfer capacity available. The improvement of TTC using line reactance variation is demonstrated with three IEEE test systems with multi-area networks.

40|$|Throughout the {{spacecraft}} design and development process, detailed instrument thermal models are created to simulate their on-orbit behavior {{and to ensure}} that they do not exceed any thermal limits. These detailed models, while generating highly accurate predictions, can sometimes lead to long simulation run times, especially when integrated with a spacecraft observatory model. Therefore, reduced models containing less detail are typically produced in tandem with the detailed models so that results may be more readily available, albeit less accurate. In the current study, both reduced and detailed instrument models are integrated with their associated spacecraft bus models to examine the impact of instrument model reduction on run time and accuracy. Preexisting instrument <b>bus</b> <b>thermal</b> model pairs from several projects were used to determine trends between detailed and reduced thermal models; namely, the Mirror Optical Bench (MOB) on the Gravity and Extreme Magnetism Small Explorer (GEMS) spacecraft, Advanced Topography Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS) on the Ice, Cloud, and Elevation Satellite 2 (ICESat- 2), and the Neutral Mass Spectrometer (NMS) on the Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE). Hot and cold cases were run for each model to capture the behavior of the models at both thermal extremes. It was found that, though decreasing the number of nodes from a detailed to reduced model brought about a reduction in the run-time, a large time savings was not observed, nor was it a linear relationship between the percentage of nodes reduced and time saved. However, significant losses in accuracy were observed with greater model reduction.

40|$|A {{high-performance}} design, and fabrication {{and growth}} processes {{to implement the}} design, have been devised for encapsulating a hydrated salt in a container that both protects the salt and provides thermal conductance between the salt and the environment surrounding the container. The unitary salt/container structure is known in the art as a salt pill. In the original application of the present design and processes, the salt is, more specifically, a hydrated paramagnetic salt, {{for use as a}} refrigerant in a very-low-temperature adiabatic demagnetization refrigerator (ADR). The design and process can also be applied, with modifications, to other hydrated salts. Hydrated paramagnetic salts have long been used in ADRs because they have the desired magnetic properties at low temperatures. They also have some properties, disadvantageous for ADRs, that dictate the kind of enclosures in which they must be housed: Being hydrated, they lose water if exposed to less than 100 -percent relative humidity. Because any dehydration compromises their magnetic properties, salts used in ADRs must be sealed in hermetic containers.
