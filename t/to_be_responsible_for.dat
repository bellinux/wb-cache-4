5|$|It is {{suspected}} that comet impacts have, over long timescales, also delivered significant quantities {{of water to}} the Earth's Moon, {{some of which may}} have survived as lunar ice.

5|$|Although the Poor Law Amendment Act did not ban {{all forms}} of outdoor relief, it stated that no able-bodied person was to receive money or other help from the Poor Law {{authorities}} except in a workhouse. Conditions in workhouses were to be made harsh to discourage people from claiming. Workhouses were {{to be built in}} every parish and, if parishes were too small, parishes could group together to form Workhouse Unions. The Poor Law Commissioners were <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> overseeing the implementation of the Act.|$|E
5|$|Astronomically, {{the most}} {{important}} property of compact objects is that they provide a supremely efficient mechanism for converting gravitational energy into electromagnetic radiation. Accretion, the falling of dust or gaseous matter onto stellar or supermassive black holes, is thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> some spectacularly luminous astronomical objects, notably diverse kinds of active galactic nuclei on galactic scales and stellar-size objects such as microquasars. In particular, accretion can lead to relativistic jets, focused beams of highly energetic particles that are being flung into space at almost light speed.|$|E

5|$|Even {{though the}} miners {{were able to}} reach a {{settlement}} in early 1990, the case of the UMWA vs. Pittston Coal Company did not end in 1990. The fines, over $60 million, did not come into bargaining until 1994 and Pittston agreed to drop most of the charges. However, since the case was now in the court system, many courts wanted the UMWA <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> all of the fines. The UMWA appealed all fines against them and the case remained undecided for many years.|$|E
5|$|Fishers {{have had}} a long history of contact with humans, but most of it has been to the {{detriment}} of fisher populations. Unprovoked attacks on humans are extremely rare, but fishers will attack if they feel threatened or cornered. In one case, a fisher was blamed for an attack on a six-year-old boy. In another case, a fisher is believed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> an attack on a twelve-year-old boy.|$|E
5|$|General {{relativity}} {{has developed}} into an essential tool in modern astrophysics. It provides {{the foundation for}} the current understanding of black holes, regions of space where the gravitational effect is so strong that even light cannot escape. Their strong gravity is thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> the intense radiation emitted by certain types of astronomical objects (such as active galactic nuclei or microquasars). General relativity is also part of the framework of the standard Big Bang model of cosmology.|$|E

5|$|Matter falling onto {{a compact}} object {{is one of}} the most {{efficient}} mechanisms for releasing energy in the form of radiation, and matter falling onto black holes is thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> some of the brightest astronomical phenomena imaginable. Notable examples of great interest to astronomers are quasars and other types of active galactic nuclei. Under the right conditions, falling matter accumulating around a black hole can lead to the formation of jets, in which focused beams of matter are flung away into space at speeds near that of light.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the past}} 2 billion years, star {{formation}} throughout Andromeda's disk {{is thought to}} have decreased to the point of near-inactivity. There have been interactions with satellite galaxies like M32, M110, or others that have already been absorbed by Andromeda Galaxy. These interactions have formed structures like Andromeda's Giant Stellar Stream. A galactic merger roughly 100 million years ago is believed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> a counter-rotating disk of gas found in the center of Andromeda as well as the presence there of a relatively young (100 million years old) stellar population.|$|E
5|$|Populations have {{declined}} {{in recent decades}} in western Europe, including the British Isles, Belgium, the Netherlands, Austria and Italy. The yellowhammer is a red-list (severely declining) species in Ireland and the UK. In eastern Europe, numbers appear to be stable, although the trend in Russia is unknown. Changes to agricultural practices are thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> reduced breeding densities. The introduced population in New Zealand has been very successful, with breeding densities much {{higher than in the}} UK.|$|E
50|$|Volunteers at Livnot, as it <b>is</b> often {{referred}} <b>to,</b> <b>were</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> many Western Wall tunnel excavations, aiding in {{the absorption of}} Ethiopian immigrants, as well as helping to repair damage caused to the cities of Safed, Kiryat Shemona, Karmiel and Hazor in the North of Israel by Katyusha fire during the Second Lebanon War {{in the summer of}} 2006.|$|R

5|$|Spotted hyenas {{have also}} been found to catch fish, tortoises, humans, black rhino, hippo calves, young African elephants, {{pangolins}} and pythons. There {{is at least one}} record of four hyenas killing an adult or subadult hippopotamus in Kruger National Park. The fossil record indicates that the now extinct European spotted hyenas primarily fed on Przewalski's horses, Irish elk, reindeer, red deer, roe deer, fallow deer, wild boar, ibex, steppe wisent, aurochs, and woolly rhinoceros. Spotted hyenas are thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> the dis-articulation and destruction of some cave bear skeletons. Such large carcasses were an optimal food resource for hyenas, especially at the end of winter, when food was scarce. Spotted hyenas may consume leather articles such as boots and belts around campsites. Jane Goodall recorded spotted hyenas attacking or savagely playing with the exterior and interior fittings of cars, and the species is thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> eating car tyres.|$|E
5|$|The active atmospheres and {{closeness}} of these stars {{means that they}} are among the brightest x-ray sources in the sky. However the x-ray emission is due to stable coronal structures and not eruptive flaring activity. Coronal loops larger than the Sun and with temperatures of several million K are likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> the majority of the x-rays.|$|E

5|$|The giraffe genome {{is around}} 2.9 billion base pairs in length {{compared}} to the 3.3 billion base pairs of the okapi. Of the proteins in giraffe and okapi genes, 19.4% are identical. The two species are equally distantly related to cattle, suggesting the giraffe's unique characteristics are not because of faster evolution. The divergence of giraffe and okapi lineages dates to around 11.5 mya. A small group of regulatory genes in the giraffe appear <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> the animal's stature and associated circulatory adaptations.|$|E
5|$|The season {{only saw}} one driver change, which was brought about when Lotus driver Romain Grosjean {{was found by}} race {{stewards}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> causing a multi-car pile-up {{at the start of}} the Belgian Grand Prix. He was given a one-race ban and a €50,000 fine for his role in the collision, forcing him to miss the Italian Grand Prix. He was replaced by the team's testing and reserve driver, Jérôme d'Ambrosio. Grosjean returned to the team for the next round in Singapore.|$|E
5|$|Venom in {{snakes and}} some lizards {{is a form}} of saliva that has been {{modified}} into venom over its evolutionary history.
