Howard and Bayliss petition Gee (Yaphet Kotto) {{to set up a}} non-smoking section for the squad room, but an amused Gee refuses because most of the detectives smoke. Howard, Felton, Bayliss and Pembleton find they share a common suspect in a Union Square murder, and plan a joint stakeout. Howard and Bayliss decide to ride together so Pembleton and Felton can smoke in the car. Although outwardly critical and skeptical, Pembleton and Felton are actually impressed with their partners' willpower and discuss the merits of quitting smoking. Howard and Bayliss, however, talk about nothing but smoking, prompting Bayliss to walk to Pembleton's car window and ask for a cigarette. As the result, the four detectives almost miss the suspect, and have to engage him in a foot chase to arrest him.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: {{although}} {{the benefits of}} <b>quitting</b> <b>smoking</b> even at an advanced age have been proved, few campaigns target the older population. The goals {{of this study were}} to analyse the characteristics of older women smokers help and support those wanting <b>to</b> <b>quit.</b> METHODS: we assessed the determinants of smoking cessation in a prospective cohort study performed in 7, 609 older women. A questionnaire about smoking habits was sent to the 486 eligible smokers. Smoking dependence and smokers' readiness <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> was assessed. Participants who had <b>quit</b> <b>smoking</b> during follow-up were asked about their previous reasons for quitting and the methods used <b>to</b> <b>quit.</b> RESULTS: 372 women of the 424 (88 %) responded to our questionnaire and were included. The most common reasons for smoking were relaxation, pleasure, and habit. Major obstacles <b>to</b> <b>quitting</b> <b>smoking</b> were 'no benefit <b>to</b> <b>quitting</b> at an advanced age', 'smoking few or "light" cigarettes yields no negative health consequences', and 'smoking does not increase osteoporotic risk'. During the 3 -year follow-up period, 57 of the 372 (15 %) women successfully <b>quit</b> <b>smoking.</b> Being an occasional smoker (OR= 2. 4) and reporting 'quitting is not difficult' (OR= 3. 7) were positively associated with having recently <b>quit</b> <b>smoking.</b> Only 11 % of successful cessations were reported to have received physician advice. CONCLUSIONS: these data illustrate the specific smoking behaviour of older women, suggesting that cessation interventions ought to be tailored to these characteristics. Willingness <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> was associated with a low education level. The most frequent obstacles <b>to</b> <b>quitting</b> were all based on incorrect information...|$|R

2500|$|Dream rebound is when {{suppressed}} thoughts {{manifest themselves}} in one's dreams. Self-control {{is a form}} of thought suppression and when one dreams, that suppressed item has a higher chance of appearing in the dream. For example, when an individual is attempting <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> <b>smoking,</b> they may dream about themselves smoking a cigarette. Emotion suppression has also been found to trigger dream rebound. Recurrence of emotional experiences act as presleep suggestions, ultimately leading to the suppressed thoughts presenting themselves within the dream. One effecting factor of dream rebound is the changes in the prefrontal lobes during rapid-eye movement sleep. Suppressed thoughts are more accessible during REM sleep, as a result of operating processes having a diminished effectiveness. This leads to presleep thoughts becoming more available [...] "with an increased activity of searching for these suppressed thought". There are other hypotheses regarding REM sleep and dream rebound. For instance, weak semantic associations, post REM sleep, are more accessible than any other time due to weak ironic monitoring processes becoming stronger. More research is needed to further understand what exactly causes dream rebound.|$|E

Hajek performed an unnecessary cosmetic surgery in his clinic's outpatient department. Freud bled {{during and after the}} operation, and may narrowly have escaped death.
