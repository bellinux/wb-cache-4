500|$|Like Andrew Hanson, The A.V. Club's Noel Murray {{called the}} {{introduction}} of the First People [...] "a masterstroke {{on the part of the}} Fringe writers". Murray graded the episode with a B+, explaining it [...] "was a strange Fringe for me. The dialogue was often painfully expository, with liberal doses of ADR to make sure that we viewers didn’t miss any of the massive amounts of significant information we need to understand as the story moves forward...And yet the episode was also funky and philosophical in <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> my Fringe to be, using the plot and even the setting to put across more than just pieces of the series’ mythology." ...|$|E

Although not named until season three's [...] "Black Widower", the character Snake Jailbird appeared {{for the first time}} in this episode. [...] "The War of the Simpsons" [...] features cultural references to songs such as Tom Jones's [...] "It's Not Unusual", Dusty Springfield's [...] "The Look of Love", KC and the Sunshine Band's [...] "That's <b>the</b> <b>Way</b> (<b>I</b> <b>Like</b> It)", and Glen Campbell's [...] "Wichita Lineman". Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. It acquired a Nielsen rating of 11.6, and was the second highest-rated show on the Fox network the week it aired.|$|E

500|$|He often played {{supporting}} roles, {{rather than}} the lead part. He said [...] "throughout my career, I've never been a huge star, but I've made steady progress and that's <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> it," [...] and [...] "It's fun coming in as {{the second or third}} lead. If the movie or TV show bombs, you aren't to blame." [...] Hartman was considered a [...] "utility player" [...] on SNL with a [...] "kind of Everyman quality" [...] which enabled him to appear in the majority of sketches, often in very distinct roles. Jan Hooks stated of his work on SNL: [...] "Phil never had an ounce of competition. He was a team player. It was a privilege for him, I believe, to play support and do it very well. He was never insulted, no matter how small the role may have been." [...] He was disciplined in his performances, studying the scripts beforehand. Hooks added: [...] "Phil knew how to listen. And he knew how to look you in the eye, and he knew the power of being able to lay back and let somebody else be funny, and then do the reactions. I think Phil was more of an actor than a comedian." [...] Film critic Pauline Kael declared that [...] "Phil Hartman and Jan Hooks on Saturday Night Live are two of the best comic actors I've ever seen." ...|$|E
500|$|The way Ned Flanders {{prepares the}} cocktails {{at the party}} is similar to actor Tom Cruise's bartending stunts in the 1988 film Cocktail. Songs heard at the party include Tom Jones's [...] "It's Not Unusual" [...] (1965), Dusty Springfield's [...] "The Look of Love" [...] (1967), KC and the Sunshine Band's [...] "That's <b>the</b> <b>Way</b> (<b>I</b> <b>Like</b> It)" [...] (1975), and Glen Campbell's [...] "Wichita Lineman" [...] (1968). Homer's false memory of the party the {{following}} day (in which he imagines himself as being erudite and witty instead of drunk) is {{a reference to the}} Algonquin Round Table, a group of New York City writers, critics, actors, and wits. The [...] "Mexican Hat Dance" [...] song is heard when Marge turns on the radio in the car to mute the conversation between her and Homer so that the children cannot hear them fight. When Homer comes into the church late, while looking for his chair, a character who strikes a resemblance to Adolf Hitler is seen. In a flashback sequence, Bart remembers chasing away a screaming babysitter with the car as a toddler. This sequence and the music in it are references to a scene in the 1976 film The Omen, in which the Devil's child Damien makes animals shriek in terror as Damien approaches. The picture of General Sherman at the bait shop is a reference to the [...] of the Loch Ness Monster. John and Gloria are a reference to George and Martha from Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? Homer's attempt at catching General Sherman, his bludgeoning of the fish and the line [...] "I love you but I have to kill you" [...] are all based on Santiago's fight with the marlin in Ernest Hemingway's novel The Old Man and the Sea. The battle between Homer and General Sherman is also reminiscent of Captain Ahab's battle with the white whale Moby-Dick in the novel Moby-Dick.|$|E

5000|$|Of {{the mixing}} process, Fogerty said, [...] "I'd {{take a piece}} of a song from one night and add pieces from other nights...a bridge here, a chorus there. I was looking to get as close to that feeling I had when I first saw him. At the same time, it was {{important}} to me that I didn't mess with the material itself. Duke is a great songwriter, and great song interpreter. I really wasn't able to tell which tunes were originals and which were covers and that's <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> it. This is his music, played his <b>way.</b> <b>I</b> just sort of assembled the best moments." [...] Capturing Tumatoe's crowd interaction was a prominent concern. [...] "That interaction was vital. Which is why {{you get a lot of}} call and response on the record. Duke is a very quick guy. And very funny. He knows how to work a crowd and it was my hope that the energy would come across on record." ...|$|R

Harper told the press that he used [...] "colourful language not suitable for public television" [...] when pressing President Bush privately over his opposition to a U.S. law that will require Canadian citizens to show their passport when crossing the border into the United States. Bush reported that Harper was [...] "a very open, straightforward fella....

2500|$|For scenes where Peyton {{is drawing}} or painting, Ward stated, [...] "...there {{would likely be}} very light lines for her to follow.

[...] Regarding the evolution of Peyton's artwork over the years, she said, [...] "I {{look back at the}} first season and think the drawings are awful! I certainly became more comfortable working in her style, but I think her style also evolved to fit mine. Does that make sense?" [...] Ward clarified, [...] "Initially I was trying to do something that just didn’t flow well from me. The drawings were too clean. A little forced and not at all <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> to work." [...] Ward said that as the show progressed, she began to put more of my own style in them, and became more comfortable and the work got better. In Season 3, the artwork was promoted through the album Friends with Benefit. In Season 6, it is seen in color instead of in black and white, to reflect the character's happiness.|$|R
