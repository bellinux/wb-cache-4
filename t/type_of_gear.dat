50|$|Generally a {{rotational}} device, where a mode 2 {{device is}} modified to have external field coil(s), thus effecting a variable transmission or variable ratio magnetic gear. This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>gear</b> consumes approximately 25% of its input power in the process. This renders the variable magnetic gearbox to less than 75% efficiency. However the lower maintenance and the torque limiting characteristics may find suitability in some applications.|$|E

5000|$|Even Less Gears: The only 3x3 <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>Gear</b> Cube with a {{total of}} four gears. It takes another four gears out and replaces them with {{standard}} edges. As the amount of gears get fewer and fewer, the difficulty level rises. So four sides can make 90° turns whereas the fifth and sixth sides are using the gear cogs giving only one option being a 180° turn.|$|E
5000|$|Slewing: This is {{rotation}} of the stacker around its central axis to align or place the stockpile where required. This works mostly by a slew pinion that rotates around a slew base. This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>gear</b> assembly is called a sun and planet gear. The axles may be multiple and are driven by DC-powered axle motors which transmit the torque via bevel or helical gears.|$|E
50|$|The {{profile angle}} of a gear is the angle at a {{specified}} pitch point between a line tangent to a tooth {{surface and the}} line normal to the pitch surface (which is a radial line of a pitch circle). This definition is applicable to every <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>gear</b> for which a pitch surface can be defined. The profile angle gives {{the direction of the}} tangent to a tooth profile.|$|E

5000|$|Tooth {{interior}} fatigue fracture, (TIFF), is a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>gear</b> failure. The {{failure is}} characterised by a fracture at approximately mid-height on the tooth of the gear. This distinguishes {{it from a}} tooth root fatigue failure. The crack for a TIFF is initiated {{in the interior of}} the tooth. This distinguishes TIFF from other fatigue failures of gears. TIFF has been observed in case-hardened idlers (i.e. gear wheels loaded on both flanks during each revolution).|$|E
40|$|The {{economics}} <b>of</b> different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> fishing <b>gears</b> on lake Kainji {{had been}} analyzed. The result has shown that, all <b>types</b> <b>of</b> fishing <b>gears</b> in {{use on the}} lake have net returns that represent gains on the users investments, and on average, earned profits. Furthermore, {{the size of the}} net returns –gain, depends on the amount of user’s investment and the profitability of each fishing method positively correlates with amount of input. The operational costs, catch and revenues did not only vary between different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> fishing <b>gears</b> in different localities but also in the same <b>type</b> <b>of</b> unit for each trip in the same locality.

40|$|Pedro Bank {{is about}} 1, 300 square miles in extent and {{lies at the}} mouth of the Palk Strait close to the mainland, {{enabling}} smaller boats to exploit it. Trawl surveys indicated the presence of substantial demersal varieties on the Pedro Bank, but the results of the early commercial operations indicate that a 135 -foot trawler may not be operated continuously on the bank without diminishing returns. Subsequent to the commercial operations extensive surveys with smaller boats and various <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>gear</b> were carried out. <b>Of</b> the various <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>gear</b> tried out, results from bottom long lining and hand lining operations were promising. Trials were carried out to compare these two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>gear.</b> Though not extensive, these trials indicated that at the initial stages of exploitation of the Bank, hand lining, which is extensively practiced in Ceylon, may be better but as exploitation progresses; with more experience, it should be possible to overcome some of the present disadvantages of bottom long lining and eventually bottom long lining should produce better results. The recently introduced mechanised craft are exploiting only the fringe of the bank and it should be possible to exploit its stocks fully with slightly bigger boats with a 35 - 40 mile range...|$|R
