Purpose of Study: The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the effect of saliva on load-deflection characteristics of superelastic NiTi wires. Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, 15 wires of three kinds of NiTi wires (Sentalloy, Force I and Truflex) were prepared; five of them were tested in their as-received condition to provide baseline information and the rest were divided into two groups of five. Half of them were put inside artificial saliva, and the other half outside. After one month, 3 -point bending test was done in a dental arch model and data from selected points on the unloading phase of the generated graphs were used for statistical analysis. Results: <b>The</b> <b>load</b> <b>values</b> of Sentalloy were lower than <b>the</b> <b>load</b> <b>values</b> of Force I and Truflex significantly. <b>The</b> <b>load</b> <b>values</b> of Truflex and Force I after one month exposed to artificial saliva decreased significantly but Sentalloy was not affected significantly. The plateau gap values between new wires and wires that were inside and outside of saliva were not significantly different and saliva did not affect it. Conclusion: Saliva decreased the load of Force I and Truflex significantly, but it did not have a statistical significant effect on Sentallo...|$|E

30|$|The {{two sets}} of joints show a {{different}} behaviour at increasing ageing time: the St 1.5 /Al 1 batch shows a constant decay of <b>the</b> <b>load</b> <b>values,</b> instead the St 1 /Al 1.5 set maintains acceptable values of resistance for several weeks of ageing, at tenth week the mechanical stability is strongly impaired. In the latter case {{the presence of the}} thin oxide layer at the overlapping interface, which behaves as an adhesive interlayer, and the larger thickness of the aluminium plate improve the resistance of the St 1 /Al 1.5 joints. Statistical analysis confirms that the two thickness combinations and ageing time are the significant factors. At zero weeks, neglecting the effect of ageing, the maximum load values of all samples belong to the same population. This means that the resistance of the clinched joints is the same regardless the combination of thicknesses, but by considering both the ageing and thickness, the analysis of variance shows that both thickness and weeks are significant parameters distinguishing two different populations in the distribution of loads.|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, {{improving}} {{energy efficient}} systems {{is one of}} the most controversial and significant global focuses. However, this trend in the field of engineering concentrates on the optimization of the existing technologies more than implementing new ones. Meanwhile, fans are one of the potent devices to be more efficient. Improvement in fan efficiency can be achieved by reducing material that is used in the fan blades. Due to this, decreasing the airfoil chord length to optimum value, leads to a decline in the amount of used materials in the blade design and manufacturing. In fan designing, Factor of safety should be considered. This factor changes by varying the chord length of the airfoil. However, this paper attempts to analyze the factor of safety in an axial fan blade with different chord lengths by use of finite element method. Due to this, axial fan blade with NACA 5514 airfoil that is made by Aluminum 6061 -T 91 will be analyzed to find the correlation between the factor of safety and chord length in various pressure loads. <b>The</b> <b>load</b> <b>values</b> are determined by the experimental test...|$|E
