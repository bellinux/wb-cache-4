5|$|<b>The</b> <b>confessional</b> {{conflicts}} {{that dominated the}} relations between the ruling city authorities were only secondary to the peasants of the Huttwil league. The peasant alliance bridged <b>the</b> <b>confessional</b> divide, uniting Catholic people from the Entlebuch and from Solothurn with Protestant peasants from the Emmental and from Basel. The treaty of Huttwil explicitly recognized this biconfessionalism. The cities remained in all their manoeuvring and negotiations for military support within their respective confessional spheres: Catholic Lucerne had requested mediation and then military help from the Catholic central Swiss cantons, while Protestant Bern had turned to Protestant Zürich for help. The distrust between the authorities of the Catholic and Protestant cantons was so deep that none would allow troops of the other confession to operate on their territories.|$|E
5|$|In December 1531, the Zurich council {{selected}} Heinrich Bullinger as his successor. He immediately removed {{any doubts}} about Zwingli's orthodoxy and defended him as a prophet and a martyr. During Bullinger's rule, <b>the</b> <b>confessional</b> divisions of the Confederation were stabilised. He rallied the reformed cities and cantons and helped them {{to recover from the}} defeat at Kappel. Zwingli had instituted fundamental reforms, while Bullinger consolidated and refined them.|$|E
5|$|Due to Calvin's {{missionary work}} in France, his {{programme}} of reform eventually reached the French-speaking provinces of the Netherlands. Calvinism was {{adopted in the}} Electorate of the Palatinate under Frederick III, {{which led to the}} formulation of the Heidelberg Catechism in 1563. This and the Belgic Confession were adopted as confessional standards in the first synod of the Dutch Reformed Church in 1571. Several leading divines, either Calvinist or those sympathetic to Calvinism, settled in England (Martin Bucer, Peter Martyr, and Jan Laski) and Scotland (John Knox). During the English Civil War, the Calvinistic Puritans produced the Westminster Confession, which became <b>the</b> <b>confessional</b> standard for Presbyterians in the English-speaking world.|$|E

5|$|As Mr. Burns {{fights for}} {{life at the}} hospital, the Springfield police are working to find his assailant.

Guilt-ridden, Smithers heads for a local church, and is promptly arrested when <b>the</b> <b>confessional</b> {{turns out to be a}} police sting. While passing the media on his way to the police station, Smithers makes a witty remark Sideshow Mel recognizes from an episode of Pardon My Zinger that aired at the same time as the shooting. Mel realizes Smithers must have watched it as well, giving him an alibi. As Smithers' memory clears, it turns out he had actually shot Jasper in his wooden leg. Meanwhile, the townsmen pull down the sun-blocker, which crushes Shelbyville to their delight.|$|E
5|$|Details of the {{assassination}} attempt were allegedly known by the principal Jesuit of England, Father Henry Garnet. Although {{he was convicted of}} treason and sentenced to death, doubt has been cast on how much he really knew of the plot. As its existence was revealed to him through confession, Garnet was prevented from informing the authorities by the absolute confidentiality of <b>the</b> <b>confessional.</b> Although anti-Catholic legislation was introduced soon after the plot's discovery, many important and loyal Catholics retained high office during King James I's reign. The thwarting of the Gunpowder Plot was commemorated for many years afterwards by special sermons and other public events such as the ringing of church bells, which have evolved into the Bonfire Night of today.|$|E

5|$|The current city {{structure}} can {{be traced}} back to the Tanzimat period of reform in the 19th century, before which Islamic judges and imams led the city under the auspices of the Grand Vizier. Following the model of French cities, this religious system was replaced by a mayor and a citywide council composed of representatives of <b>the</b> <b>confessional</b> groups (millet) across Istanbul. Beyoğlu was the first area of the city to have its own director and council, with members instead being longtime residents of the neighborhood. Laws enacted after the Ottoman constitution of 1876 aimed to expand this structure across the city, imitating the twenty arrondissements of Paris, but they were not fully implemented until 1908, when Istanbul was declared a province with nine constituent districts. This system continued beyond the founding of the Turkish Republic, with the province renamed a belediye (municipality), but the municipality was disbanded in 1957.|$|E
5|$|For {{the motives}} of Bardanes himself, the {{situation}} is less clear. According to the Byzantine chroniclers, he accepted the acclamation only reluctantly, after vainly entreating the soldiers {{to allow him to}} leave. According to another story however, before his revolt, Bardanes, accompanied by his three principal associates, Thomas the Slav, Leo the Armenian and Michael the Amorian visited a holy man at Philomelion to learn of the prospects for the uprising. The monk correctly prophesied that his rebellion would fail, that Thomas too would begin a revolt, and that Leo and Michael would reign as emperors. Although possibly a later invention, this story may suggest that Bardanes planned his revolt beforehand. Aside from any personal ambition, Bardanes was {{also a member of the}} landed aristocracy and a devoted iconophile who supported Empress Irene's regime. He has therefore also been seen as the representative of the opposition by the traditional elites to Nikephoros's policies, both in <b>the</b> <b>confessional</b> area, where the Emperor maintained a carefully neutral stance towards both iconoclasts and iconophiles, and in the socio-financial sphere, where new taxes on landed property and the expropriation of ecclesiastical estates hurt their interests. Historian Warren Treadgold further suggested that the revolt was a reaction against Nikephoros's usurpation and aimed, at least ostensibly, at the restoration of Irene. Her death, however, at Lesbos on 8 August deprived the rebels of any claim to legitimacy.|$|E
5|$|Mark befriends Stephanie Scully (Carla Bonner), {{and they}} share a kiss, before {{deciding}} to remain friends. After a jealous Paige fights with Steph, Mark and Steph have sex and begin a relationship. Following an explosion at Lassiter's Hotel, Mark finds evidence Paul was responsible and arrests him. Released on bail, Paul convinces Steph of his innocence, causing trouble in her and Mark's relationship. Tyler is later questioned and Mark {{is removed from the}} case. Mark raises the subject of having children with Steph and she tells him she is open to {{the idea of having a}} child with him in the future. Mark starts to think Paul could be innocent, but is threatened with dismissal if he continues to investigate. He later discovers that Jacka Hills (Brad McMurray) caused the explosion on Julie Quill's (Gail Easdale) orders. Mark investigates the release of snakes in Ramsay Street and soon realises that Steph is being stalked. Hearing that someone has made a confession to Father Jack Callahan (Andrew Morley), Mark bugs <b>the</b> <b>confessional,</b> despite being ordered not to. Mark learns from Steph's former girlfriend Belinda Bell (Nikki Shiels) that one of her patients Ari Philcox (Dylan Watson) is behind the release of the snakes. Mark is suspended when the bug is discovered. Despite this, Mark goes after Ari when he threatens Belinda and Steph's son Charlie Hoyland (Alexander McGuire), but he is stabbed in the process. His injuries are not life-threatening. Steph and Mark are saddened when Charlie has to return home. Sonya offers to be their surrogate, as Steph is wary of her mental health problems returning. However, when they learn that Steph has a low ovarian count, Steph briefly breaks things off, until Mark convinces her to try the IVF procedure once.|$|E
50|$|Van Vlierden's {{style is}} {{represented}} most clearly in <b>the</b> <b>confessionals</b> he {{made for the}} churches in Beringen and Maastricht. The treatment of garments typical of the high Baroque was alien to him. He draped the garments of the figures in a natural way around the bodies, without, however, accentuating the bodyparts. At {{the height of the}} hip of the static leg the busy folds, along with the movement of the arm, compensate the dynamics of the moving leg. The Contrapposto pose is used in all the figures of <b>the</b> <b>confessionals</b> and <b>the</b> two figures on each side of <b>the</b> <b>confessionals</b> always mirror each other. The muscles of the upper body, abdomen, arms and legs are represented in an almost anatomically exact manner. By respecting the general proportions and a natural posture the sculptures appear lifelike. Each figure is typified as an individual through the appropriate clothing and attributes. In the small-scale sculptures van Vlierden dared to emphasize movement which he, however, downplayed in the life-size sculptures.|$|R
50|$|In November 2016, <b>the</b> old <b>confessional</b> {{rooms in}} <b>the</b> cathedral which were built and opened in 1989 {{were closed and}} new confessionals which were {{constructed}} {{at the back of}} the cathedral near the main entrance doors during the summer of 2016, were opened. This was done to encourage people who enter the cathedral through the main entrance doors to think about going to confession. It also made it easier for people, having <b>the</b> <b>confessionals</b> located at <b>the</b> back of the cathedral and not away up near the top of the cathedral, adjacent to the sacristy. <b>The</b> new <b>confessionals</b> were blessed by Bishop Donal McKeown at Sunday Mass on 20th November 2016.|$|R

25|$|The {{general idea}} and {{principle}} of <b>the</b> <b>confessional</b> genre was that dying {{men did not}} lie.

50|$|The Baroque paneling, altars and {{at least}} three of <b>the</b> <b>confessionals</b> were {{produced}} by cabinetmaker Tillman Janssens and the sculptor Daniël van Vlierden from Hasselt. Three of <b>the</b> four <b>confessionals</b> can be attributed with certainty to van Vlierden on the basis of stylistic similarities with <b>the</b> <b>confessionals</b> that he made for the Dominican church in Maastricht (now in the Basilica of Saint Servatius). The facial expressions and the arrangement of the figures point in the direction of van Vlierden. One <b>confessional</b> in <b>the</b> northern transept is probably the work of the eminent Antwerp sculptor Artus Quellinus II, given the similarity with the design drawn by Artus Quellinus II himself. The sculpture of the Holy Sepulchre in the northern aisle of the church can also be attributed with certainty to van Vlierden. The main altar displays certain characteristics of van Vlierden’s expressive forms. However, it can not be attributed to him with certainty. The execution of the pulpit is certainly the work of another, less skilled sculptor.|$|R
40|$|Confessional {{poetry is}} still as popular and {{controversial}} as ever. Devastated by mental breakdowns, <b>the</b> <b>Confessionals</b> invented a new mode of {{writing in the}} hope of self-cure. None of them succeeded. Their failures materialized dramatically in the suicides of three major Confessional poets: Sylvia Plath, Anne Sexton, and John Berryman. Although Robert Lowell did not actually killed himself, his resignation and self-destructive behavior was clearly discernible to friends and family members. In this book Rita Horváth reconceptualizes <b>the</b> field of <b>Confessional</b> poetry viewing Confessional poetry as a future-oriented attempt at self-construction rather than at self-exposure. Rita Horváth's work moves from consideration of formative traumas in the lives of <b>the</b> <b>Confessionals</b> to consideration of the whole era's formative trauma, the Nazi Holocaust. The earlier chapters of the book are quite transfigured by the last chapter concerned with the Holocaust, and take on unexpected meanings in its wake...|$|R
