Although his one game for Canterbury in 1992 was as a replacement, he played seven games the following season.

5|$|Sennheiser sound {{equipment}} {{was used for}} the audio. According <b>to</b> <b>Matt</b> Napier, Madonna's monitor engineer, they used Sennheiser's Wireless Systems Manager software to tweak frequencies. Madonna used an HSP 4 headset {{at the beginning of the}} show, later switching to a Sennheiser SKM 5200-II handheld transmitter. Sennheiser transmitters were also used by Minaj, M.I.A. and LMFAO, and Green's microphone used an MD 5235 capsule. Napier said in a Mix article that they needed gold-plated transmitters for Madonna and Green, which were provided by Sennheiser the day of the show. Professional Wireless Systems (PWS), a Masque Sound company, were in charge of wireless sound monitoring; in a series of trial runs, PWS chose a frequency that eliminated interference from other systems.|$|E

Thus, Calvin must — quite awkwardly — teach Matt {{through the use}} of rap (Never Know). When the big night comes, their plan works like a charm. But it pains Calvin <b>to</b> see <b>Matt</b> kiss Rosanna.|$|R

5|$|The Scottie is also {{renowned for}} being {{featured}} in the popular board game, Monopoly, as a player token. When the game was first created in the 1930s, Scotties {{were one of the}} most popular pets in the United States, and it is also {{one of the most popular}} Monopoly game tokens, according <b>to</b> <b>Matt</b> Collins, vice president of marketing for Hasbro. In Disney's 1955 film Lady and the Tramp, a Scottish terrier named Jock is the friend of Lady, the American Cocker Spaniel. A Scottish Terrier named Dulcinea is a scene-stealer in the 1998 Latin American novel Yo-Yo Boing! by Giannina Braschi.|$|E
5|$|The {{lopsided}} victory allowed Texas to play several less-experienced players. Back-up quarterback Matt Nordgren {{entered the}} game in the thirdquarter, replacing Vince Young. Third-string quarterback Matt McCoy replaced Nordgren just past the midpoint of the fourthquarter. Since Colt McCoy was listed third on the UT depth chart, television broadcasters referred <b>to</b> <b>Matt</b> McCoy (no relation) as Colt McCoy, a mistake they repeated over the season. The Longhorns did not play Colt in the 2005season, choosing to redshirt him instead. After viewing this game as part of a recruiting visit to UT, Jevan Snead – ranked {{as one of the top}} high school quarterbacks in the nation, elected to switch his commitment from University of Florida to Texas.|$|E
5|$|As a freshman, he {{was given}} a redshirt year so he did not play during the team's 2005 {{national}} championship season. He served as the quarterback for the scout team in practice against the starting defense. During this time, Matt McCoy (no relation) was officially listed as the number three quarterback behind Vince Young and Matt Nordgren. When Brown chose to play Matt McCoy in four separate game situations where Texas had a commanding lead, confusion arose as to which McCoy was in the game. Many sportscasters mistakenly referred <b>to</b> <b>Matt</b> McCoy as Colt McCoy, as Colt was the more widely known player. The following year, with Young forgoing his senior year to enter the NFL and Nordgren graduating, the position of starting quarterback for the defending National Champion Texas Longhorns came down to a competition between redshirt freshman Colt McCoy and true freshman newcomer Jevan Snead.|$|E

5|$|Hardy gained {{attention}} for his high risk stunts in the TLC matches, making {{a name for}} himself {{as one of the most}} seemingly reckless and unorthodox WWF performers of his time. In 2001, Hardy received a push as a singles competitor, and he held the Intercontinental (defeating Triple H), Light Heavyweight (defeating Jerry Lynn) and Hardcore Championships (defeating Mike Awesome and Van Dam on two separate occasions). At the end of 2001, the Hardys began a storyline in which they began to fight, which led <b>to</b> <b>Matt</b> demanding a match at Vengeance, with Lita as the special guest referee. After Hardy beat Matt by pinfall at Vengeance, while Matt's foot was on the ropes, Hardy and Lita began feuding against Matt. In the middle of the feud, however, Hardy faced The Undertaker in a Hardcore Championship match and lost. After the match, The Undertaker was scripted to attack both Hardy and Lita, injuring them. On the next episode of SmackDown!, The Undertaker attacked Matt as well, also injuring him, in storyline. The Hardys and Lita were not seen again until the Royal Rumble, because WWF did not have another storyline for their characters. The Hardys later came back as a team, and there was never any mention of their previous storyline split.|$|E
5|$|Hardy won the TNA World Title from EC3 on the January 19, 2016 {{episode of}} Impact Wrestling, {{becoming}} {{the first man to}} defeat him in a one-on-one match in TNA. During the match a double turn took place; Hardy turned heel after Tyrus betrayed EC3. The following week on Impact Wrestling, Jeff Hardy had confronted him about last week and issued a challenge <b>to</b> <b>Matt</b> for the World Heavyweight title in the main event and Matt accepted. However, later before the main event could begin, Eric Young and Bram would attack Jeff from behind. Kurt Angle would then come out to try save Jeff and Matt would have Tyrus attack Angle from behind. While Matt watched from the ramp, Young attacked Jeff with the Piledriver off the apron through a table. The following week, he successfully retained his title against Kurt Angle. At Lockdown, he retained his title in a Six-side of steel match against Ethan Carter III, with the help of Rockstar Spud. He lost his title against Drew Galloway on the March 15 episode of Impact Wrestling, after a match featuring EC3 and Jeff Hardy.|$|E
