40|$|Abstract: The {{influence}} of root reinforcement on shallow landsliding {{has been well}} established through mechanistic and empirical studies, yet {{few studies have examined}} how local vegetative patterns influence slope stability. Because root networks spread outward from trees, the species, size, and spacing of trees should influence the spatial distribution of root strength. We documented the distribution and characteristics of trees adjacent to 32 shallow landslides that oc-curred during 1996 in the Oregon Coast Range. Although broadly classified as a conifer-dominated forest, we observed sparse coniferous and abundant hardwood trees near landslide scars in an industrial forest (Mapleton) that experienced widespread burning in the 19 th century. In industrial forests that were burned, selectively harvested, and not replanted (Elliott State Forest), swordfern was ubiquitous near landslides, and we observed similar numbers <b>of</b> <b>live</b> <b>conifer</b> and hardwood trees proximal to landslide scarps. We demonstrate that root strength quantified in landslide scarps and soil pits correlates with a geometry-based index of root network contribution derived from mapping the size, species, condi-tion, and spacing of local trees, indicating that root strength can be predicted by mapping the distribution and charac-teristics of trees on potentially unstable slopes. In our study sites, landslides tend to occur in areas of reduced root strength, suggesting that to make site-specific predictions of landslide occurrence slope stability analyses must account for the diversity and distribution of vegetation in potentially unstable terrain. Key words: slope stability, vegetation, root strength, shallow landslide, debris flow, Oregon Coast Range...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1996 Presentation date: 1996 - 02 - 05 Breeding bird {{communities}} {{were examined in}} 18 managed Douglas-fir stands in 6 age classes from 5 to 34 years old in spring and early summer, 1993 on the Detroit Ranger District, Willamette National Forest, Oregon. The range of seral stages included early shrub/sapling, late shrub/sapling, and pole. In general, the 9 younger stands were opencanopy while the 9 older stands were closed-canopy. Of the 50 bird species recorded, 21 had large enough sample sizes for analysis. Of these 21, 8 showed a pattern of increasing abundance with increasing stand age (chestnut-backed chickadee, golden-crowned kinglet, hermit thrush, hermit warbler, Pacific-slope flycatcher, Swainson's thrush, Wilson's warbler, winter wren). Six species showed a pattern of decreasing abundance with increasing stand age (American robin, darkeyed junco, rufous hummingbird, white-crowned sparrow) and 4 species peaked in abundance in age class 2 (10 - 14 years old) before decreasing with increasing stand age (dusky flycatcher, MacGillivray's warbler, orange-crowned warbler, rufous-sided towhee). Two species did not exhibit any particular pattern associated with stand age (warbling vireo, western tanager). Three species were dropped from analysis because their average territory size {{is larger than the}} smallest stand surveyed. Abundance indices for species which showed an increasing pattern were positively associated with habitat variables describing conifer basal area, percent cover <b>of</b> <b>live</b> <b>conifer</b> crown between 4 m and the height of the tallest conifer tree, number of conifer stems/ha between 20 - and 30 - cm dbh, and/or percent cover <b>of</b> <b>live</b> hardwood crown between 4 m and the height of the tallest hardwood tree. Abundance indices for species which showed a decreasing or peaked abundance were negatively associated with the same variables, excluding percent cover of hardwood crown. Total abundance, species richness, and species diversity did not differ (P< 0. 05) among the age classes. However, bird community composition changed with increasing stand age. Open-canopy stands were dominated by species preferring open-canopy habitats (top 5 species in order of abundance: dark-eyed junco, MacGillivray's warbler, rufous hummingbird, dusky flycatcher, rufous-sided towhee) while closed canopy-stands were dominated by species preferring closed-canopy habitats, (hermit warbler, dark-eyed junco, chestnut-backed chickadee, golden-crowned kinglet, Swainson's thrush); the dark-eyed junco was an exception. The rate of bird community change was rapid along the gradient of open-canopy stands but appeared to reach a plateau once canopy closure was reached...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2010 Stand {{structure}} in headwater riparian areas of western Oregon is highly variable making quantification of structural attributes within these stands difficult. A reliable sampling design {{is important to}} characterize and monitor changes in stand structure over time. This study examined sixteen alternatives for sampling <b>live</b> <b>conifers</b> and six alternatives for sampling hardwoods and snags. Each sampling alternative was replicated 500 times on a 72 meter square stem map at eight headwater stream locations in western Oregon. A variety of plot sizes and shapes were considered at two sampling intensities of 10 % and 20 % of the stand area. Applied to <b>live</b> <b>conifers,</b> the performance <b>of</b> the alternatives were assessed with respect to estimation of trees per hectare, basal area per hectare, and height to diameter ratio using root mean square error, average mean deviation and percent bias as criteria. Performance with respect to snags and hardwoods was similar. In general, rectangular strip designs oriented perpendicular to the stream outperformed circular, radial plots, and variable plots...|$|R
30|$|The {{prescribed}} burns {{we studied}} may have benefited quaking aspen in some individual transects by increasing mean regeneration density or heights relative to untreated or pre-fire numbers (although only one site had statistically significant changes). However, heavy post-fire mule deer browsing is {{reducing the number}} of aspen regenerations that reach sufficient height (> 150 cm) to replace the declining aspen overstory, and may even be producing multi-stemmed trees or aspen “shrubs.” Low intensity burning followed by heavy browsing could ultimately lead to reduced aspen regeneration density, as was observed at two sites. Fires likely need to be intense enough to kill conifers that are out-competing the shade-intolerant aspen regenerations, or aspen stands may decline further. In areas where aspen restoration is the primary goal, multiple risk factors should be considered (e.g., numbers <b>of</b> <b>live</b> aspen regeneration, <b>conifer</b> cover, and browse pressure) for prioritizing and designing restoration treatments (Bartos and Campbell 1998). Additional research is needed to improve our understanding of the interactions of fire severity, competing vegetation and browsing on aspen in this understudied region. This is especially the case in small, declining groves where low intensity fires are being implemented that are consistent with historical fire intensity, but may be ineffective at reducing conifer density or regenerating aspen under current conditions.|$|R

Finally, with the {{finite element method}} (FEM), the simplified model <b>of</b> extrusion <b>tapping</b> are built, and the simulation of thread forming process <b>of</b> traditional extrusion <b>tapping</b> <b>of</b> internal thread are conducted, furthermore, the characteristic and influencing law of different vibration parameters (include vibration frequency, amplitude and direction) <b>of</b> vibration-assisted extrusion <b>tapping</b> <b>of</b> internal thread are studied, and some practical results are obtained. The simulation results show that applying vibration to extrusion <b>tapping</b> <b>of</b> internal thread can reduce tapping torque and improve thread forming quality, the reasonable selection of vibration parameters are very crucial to this novel process...|$|R

30|$|We searched within aspen {{patches and}} along the patch {{boundaries}} for conifers with potential direct evidence of fire (e.g., fire scars, conifer death dates, and ring-width changes and injuries). Cross sections and partial cross sections were collected with handsaws from remnant conifer logs, living trees, and standing dead snags with intact outer rings. Increment cores were collected from potentially injured <b>live</b> <b>conifers</b> without basal scars. Potential evidence of fire injury included char, scars on the undersides of branches, elevated crown base height, and unilateral loss of branches. Fire scars were not collected at PIN due to the existing fire scar collection located within our study site (Grissino-Mayer et al. 1995).|$|R
