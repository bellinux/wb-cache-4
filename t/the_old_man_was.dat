25|$|To {{make matters}} {{easier for the}} youth, however, the Old Man that dwelt in the first cave the youth had {{discovered}} kept track {{of all of the}} youth's money and inventory items so that the youth could recover them again and take up from roughly the same position. Additionally, <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Man</b> <b>was</b> capable of telepathic communication with the hero and could grant the child magical abilities for short periods of time by researching spells in tomes of forbidden magic. The Old Man's ability to see clairvoyantly also enabled him to sense when certain plot elements were occurring such as the kidnapping of the great fairy or the washing up of useful items by the seashore. These events would be relayed to the hero telepathically.|$|E

[...] As soon as Holmes discovered what was happening, he was able to forbid the payment of his fine as a matter of conscience, though friends attempted to pay for him as well. [...] As a result, Holmes was taken to the town's whipping post on 5 September 1651 and given 30 lashes with a three-corded whip. [...] He told the magistrates, [...] "You have struck me as with roses", and he claimed to have felt no pain during the incident; however, he could only sleep by resting on his knees and elbows for many days afterwards. [...] Much later, Rhode Island Governor Joseph Jenckes wrote, [...] "Those who have seen the scars on Mr. Holmes' back (which <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> wont to call the marks of the Lord Jesus), have expressed a wonder that he should live." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{surviving}} portrait {{from this}} time shows the prince in armour, mounted on a white horse and pulling the winged figure of Father Time by the forelock. Art historian John Sheeran suggests this is a classical allusion that signifies opportunity. The old man carries Henry's lance and plumed helmet; and scholar Chris Caple points out that his pose {{is similar to that}} of Albrecht Dürer's figure of death in Knight, Death and the Devil (1513).• [...] He also observes that <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> painted later than other components of the painting, since the bricks of the wall show through his wings. When the painting was restored in 1985, the wall and the figure of time were revealed to modern eyes for the first time, having been painted over at some point in the seventeenth century by other hands than Peake's. The painting has also been cut down, the only original canvas edge being that on the left.• ...|$|E

The two drive the horses down into the deeps of Busiltjörn, and all of the horses swim back to land but a large, young, and {{handsome}} grey horse that no one had ever mounted. The grey-bearded old man says that the horse is from [...] "Sleipnir's kin" [...] and that [...] "he must be raised carefully, because he will become better than any other horse."
