25|$|In 2001, {{when the}} Changi Airport Line was opened, {{some of these}} trains plying the East West Line had luggage racks {{installed}}. These luggage racks were installed in every carriage of the train, taking up the space of two seats next to <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of each carriage. The purpose of those racks were to let travellers heading to the airport, who usually carry {{a large amount of}} luggage, to have a space to place their bags easily.|$|E

Remote TV camera inspections revealed that twelve of the elements had fallen just over 80ft (24.4m) down the discharge well into a water filled transport flask at the bottom. The NII initiated an investigation because dropping irradiated fuel elements is a serious issue even when, as in this event, BNFL had advised NII {{that there had been}} no release of radiological activity.|$|E
25|$|Whereas most {{dwellings}} in Madagascar {{are traditionally}} constructed from pliable plant materials, the Antandroy {{are one of}} the few ethnic groups to use wood plank to build their homes. Antandroy homes are traditionally square (not rectangular, as elsewhere on the island), raised on low stilts, topped with a peaked roof and constructed of vertically-hung planks of wood affixed to a wooden frame. These houses traditionally have no windows and feature three wooden doors: the front door is the women's entrance, <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> rear of the house is for children, and the third door is used by the men. Fences are often constructed around Antandroy houses using prickly-pear cactus (raketa) or lengths of indigenous succulents from the surrounding spiny forests.|$|E

500|$|By contrast, the Antandroy {{inhabit the}} Madagascar spiny thickets, an {{extremely}} dry and hot {{region in the}} south of Madagascar where unique forms of drought-resistant plants have evolved and thrived. [...] Their homes are traditionally square (not rectangular), raised on low stilts, topped with a peaked roof and constructed of vertically-hung planks of wood affixed to a wooden frame.

500|$|The Mosque of al-Khidr (also called [...] "Maqam al-Khader") is [...] by [...] and {{was built}} on the site of a Byzantine monastery. The {{northern}} and southern walls were buttressed and the eastern wall has three apses. The Survey of Western Palestine related in 1875 that there were Greek inscriptions on one of the steps leading to <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> southern wall while on the floor was a broken stone slab marked by two Maltese crosses, apparently resembling a tombstone. Further slabs and Greek inscriptions were found {{in the eastern part of}} the mosque and in the courtyard. In the center is a tomb made of modern masonry that tradition claims is the tomb of Saint George ("Mar Jirjis") or al-Khidr, as he is known in Arabic.|$|E
500|$|The {{church is}} entered through <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{west side of}} the tower, with modern double doors between the tower and the nave set into a plain square doorway dating from the 17th or 18th century. [...] The nave is 27feet 9inches by 13feet 8inches (8.5 by 4.2m). Between the nave and the chancel there is a plain round arch, from the 11th or 12th century, a step up, and a rail. At the east end of the chancel, there is a further step up from the chapel into the sanctuary, which has some 18th-century gravestones set into it. The late 15th-century chancel, which {{measures}} 32feet 6inches by 14feet (9.9 by 4.3m), has some memorials from the 18th and early 19th centuries. [...] One is to a bonesetter called Evan Thomas (died 1814), erected by Thomas Bulkeley, 7th Viscount Bulkeley; another, to Emma Viscountess Bulkeley Williams, is made from ornately decorated marble.|$|E

500|$|Pei's first {{proposed}} design included a large glass pyramid that would fill the interior with sunlight, meant {{to represent the}} optimism and hope that Kennedy's administration had symbolized for so many in the US. Mrs. Kennedy liked the design, but resistance began in Cambridge, the {{first proposed}} site for the building, {{as soon as the}} project was announced. Many community members worried that the library would become a tourist attraction, causing particular problems with traffic congestion. Others worried that the design would clash with the architectural feel of nearby Harvard Square. By the mid-70s, Pei tried proposing a new design, but the library's opponents resisted every effort. These events pained Pei, who had sent all three of his sons to Harvard, and although he rarely discussed his frustration, it was evident to his wife. [...] "I could tell how tired he was by the way he opened <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of the day," [...] she said. [...] "His footsteps were dragging. It was very hard for I.M. to see that so many people didn't want the building." ...|$|E
500|$|Several {{observers}} {{have noted that}} foreign journalists {{were not allowed to}} interview the self-immolation victims recovering in hospitals. Even the victims' relatives were not permitted to speak with them, according to David Ownby. [...] Pan wrote that [...] "Beijing denied requests to interview Liu Siying and the three other survivors, who are all hospitalized... A Kaifeng official said only China Central Television and the official New China News Agency were permitted to speak to their relatives or their colleagues. A man who answered <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Liu home referred questions to the government." [...] The survivors were interviewed by the state-run press, however. In one such interview, CCTV interviewed the 12-year-old Liu Siying. Government sources reported Liu Siying had undergone a tracheotomy shortly before the interview. Speaking through approved media outlets, she said that her own mother told her to set herself on fire to reach the [...] "heavenly golden kingdom"; journalist Danny Schechter doubted that the child {{would have been able to}} speak to the Chinese media so soon after a tracheotomy, yet Liu Siying appeared to be speaking clearly and singing in the interview.|$|E
