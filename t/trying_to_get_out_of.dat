500|$|In {{his closing}} argument, Coakley {{described}} a chronological sequence of mutinous occurrences, beginning at Camp Shoemaker {{shortly after the}} explosion when {{two and a half}} companies were mixed together for two weeks.

Coakley described how the mutiny continued in the barge when Joe Small spoke to the men and asked them to stick together. Coakley entered into the record his definition of mutiny: [...] "Collective insubordination, collective disobedience of lawful orders of a superior officer, is mutiny."
