25|$|Trauma {{models are}} <b>typically</b> <b>founded</b> {{on the view}} that {{traumatic}} experiences (such as actual physical or sexual abuse) are more common or more serious than thought in the histories of those diagnosed with mental disorders. Such models have traditionally been associated with psychoanalytic approaches, notably Sigmund Freud's early ideas on childhood sexual abuse and hysteria.|$|R
5|$|A dusty plasma {{contains}} tiny {{charged particles}} of dust (<b>typically</b> <b>found</b> in space). The dust particles acquire high charges {{and interact with}} each other. A plasma that contains larger particles is called grain plasma. Under laboratory conditions, dusty plasmas are also called complex plasmas.|$|E
5|$|Leccinum holopus, {{commonly}} known as the white birch bolete, white bog bolete, or ghost bolete, is a species of bolete fungus in the family Boletaceae found in northern Asia, Europe, and northeastern North America. It associates with birch trees and is <b>typically</b> <b>found</b> in boggy or swampy areas, often growing among sphagnum moss.|$|E
5|$|Rotifers are a phylum of {{microscopic}} but multi-celled animals, <b>typically</b> <b>found</b> in freshwater environments. Although the Latin name rotifer means 'wheel-bearer', these organisms {{do not have}} any rotating structures, but rather a ring of rhythmically beating cilia used for feeding and propulsion.|$|E
25|$|The austral storm-petrels <b>typically</b> breed <b>found</b> in the {{southern}} hemisphere, {{in contrast to the}} Northern storm-petrel in the northern hemisphere.|$|R

50|$|The school {{boasts a}} wide variety of student-run clubs, with {{designated}} club activity time built into the school schedule. These clubs serve as opportunities for students to explore their interests, both academic and otherwise, and as such, they contribute largely to the culture of the school. Clubs are <b>typically</b> <b>founded</b> and run by students with teachers serving in supervisory roles. Among the school's most notable clubs are CFLHS Model United Nations (CMUN), English Power Speech (public speaking), and Hermes (student newspaper).|$|R
5|$|The {{sky over}} Consett, which {{had long been}} famous for its thick haze of red iron oxide dust thrown up by the steelworks, cleared as did the cloud of steam <b>typically</b> <b>found</b> around the tall cooling towers and chimneys. Some Consett steel workers {{took part in the}} demolition.|$|E
5|$|An oceanic (or maritime) {{climate is}} <b>typically</b> <b>found</b> {{along the west}} coasts at the middle latitudes of all the world's continents, {{bordering}} cool oceans, as well as southeastern Australia, and is accompanied by plentiful precipitation year-round. The Mediterranean climate regime resembles the climate of the lands in the Mediterranean Basin, parts of western North America, parts of Western and South Australia, in southwestern South Africa and in parts of central Chile. The climate is characterized by hot, dry summers and cool, wet winters. A steppe is a dry grassland. Subarctic climates are cold with continuous permafrost and little precipitation.|$|E
5|$|Exsudoporus frostii (formerly Boletus frostii), {{commonly}} known as Frost's bolete or the apple bolete, is a bolete fungus first described scientifically in 1874. A {{member of the family}} Boletaceae, the mushrooms produced by the fungus have tubes and pores instead of gills on the underside of their caps. Exsudoporus frostii is distributed in the eastern United States from Maine to Georgia, and in the southwest from Arizona extending south to Mexico and Costa Rica. A mycorrhizal species, its fruit bodies are <b>typically</b> <b>found</b> growing near hardwood trees, especially oak.|$|E
50|$|Because plate {{switches}} {{can only}} be used by double-flanged wheels and at extremely low speeds, they are <b>typically</b> only <b>found</b> on hand-worked narrow gauge lines.|$|R
50|$|Terrapin {{is used to}} {{describe}} several species of small, edible, hard-shell turtles, <b>typically</b> those <b>found</b> in brackish waters, and is an Algonquian word for turtle.|$|R
50|$|A {{university}} {{museum is}} {{a repository of}} collections run by a university, <b>typically</b> <b>founded</b> to aid teaching and research within the institution of higher learning. The Ashmolean Museum at the University of Oxford in England is an early example, originally housed in the building that is now the Museum of the History of Science. A more recent example is the Holburne Museum of Art in Bath, originally constructed as a hotel in 1796 {{it is now the}} official museum of the University of Bath.|$|R
5|$|Giant mouse lemurs {{are often}} {{sympatric}} with mouse lemurs, such as M.murinus, {{though they are}} <b>typically</b> <b>found</b> higher in the canopy and favor thicker, taller gallery forests. At the Marosalaza forest (north of Morondava), Coquerel's giant mouse lemur is sympatric with four other nocturnal lemurs (mouse lemurs, sportive lemurs, dwarf lemurs, and fork-marked lemurs), but manages niche differentiation by feeding at different times and specializing on insect secretions during the dry season.|$|E
5|$|Growing in {{woodland}} among moss, {{plant detritus}} or other habitats, the L.lubrica fruit bodies are <b>typically</b> <b>found</b> in large numbers, though they can grow in tight clumps or even individually. The species feeds as a saprotroph. The youngest fruit bodies {{are small and}} conical, but the fertile head quickly grows from the stalk. It {{is often described as}} inedible, despite its common name, but has also been reported as edible and even good. L.lubrica has been recorded in Europe, North America, Asia and Australasia.|$|E
5|$|Like {{all species}} {{remaining}} in the genus Collybia, C.cirrhata is saprobic, and is <b>typically</b> <b>found</b> growing on the decaying or blackened remains of other mushrooms; occasionally the fruit bodies may be found growing on moss or soil without any apparent connection to decaying mushrooms, although these observations may represent instances where the remnant host tissue—possibly from a previous season—has decayed {{to such an extent}} that it remains as buried fragments in the substrate. Known hosts include Lactarius, Russula, Meripilus giganteus, and Bovista dermoxantha.|$|E
50|$|They are <b>typically</b> {{asymptomatic}} and <b>found</b> incidentally.|$|R
50|$|Merogony: Schizonts in this genus produce 6 to 16 merozoites by {{simultaneous}} exogenous budding. These <b>typically</b> are <b>found</b> in a fan shaped arrangement. This occurs {{within the}} erythrocytes.|$|R
50|$|The trust {{laws of the}} {{offshore}} world are <b>typically</b> <b>founded</b> on the trust laws of the onshore world. For those jurisdictions which are currently possessions of the UK, or were former possessions of the UK, typically the UK Trustee Act of 1925 is the common starting point. From there, each jurisdiction has sought to develop and evolve the law in a race to develop the most attractive trust environment which maintains acceptable standards, preserves the concepts of a trust, yet is attractive to potential users. Many of these jurisdictions share similar characteristics.|$|R
5|$|Muscazone {{is another}} {{compound}} {{that has more}} recently been isolated from European specimens of the fly agaric. It {{is a product of}} the breakdown of ibotenic acid by ultra-violet radiation. Muscazone is of minor pharmacological activity compared with the other agents. Amanita muscaria and related species are known as effective bioaccumulators of vanadium; some species concentrate vanadium to levels of up to 400 times those <b>typically</b> <b>found</b> in plants. Vanadium is present in fruit-bodies as an organometallic compound called amavadine. The biological importance of the accumulation process is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Some {{water from}} the Shamokin Creek {{watershed}} enters the Mahanoy Creek watershed via various mine tunnels, mainly the Doutyville, Helfenstein, the Locust Gap, and the Centralia Mine discharges. Water from Mahanoy Creek also flows through mine tunnels into Shamokin Creek. The discharge of the creek at various locations ranges from 0 to 320 cubic feet per second. The discharge of acid mine drainage in the creek ranges from 0 to 17.2 cubic feet per second. In 2001, the discharge was <b>typically</b> <b>found</b> to be higher in March than in August.|$|E
5|$|Specimens {{have been}} {{collected}} from several ecosystems, including old fields, river terrace forests, flatwoods, Florida Sand Pine scrub, Slash Pine forests, Appalachian grass balds, and rice fields. Robert and Betty Barnes reported the species as occurring in broomsedge fields throughout the southeastern Piedmont. The species is <b>typically</b> <b>found</b> in the herb stratum (among grasses and other short plants) and may be collected with a sweep net.|$|E
50|$|The Seadornavirus genus {{contains}} Banna virus, Kadipiro virus, and Liao ning virus. All three viruses can <b>typically</b> be <b>found</b> where Japanese encephalitis {{virus and}} Dengue virus have been reported.|$|R
