5|$|A {{statement}} is considered falsifiable {{if there is}} an observation or a <b>test</b> <b>that</b> could be made that would demonstrate that the {{statement is}} false. Statements that are not falsifiable cannot be examined by scientific investigation since they permit no tests that evaluate their accuracy. Creationists such as Henry M. Morris have claimed that any observation can be fitted into the evolutionary framework, so it is impossible to demonstrate that evolution is wrong and therefore evolution is non-scientific.|$|E

5|$|Although Gascoigne {{had always}} {{intended}} to study mathematics at Cambridge, an event occurred that significantly shaped his career. In 1931, an earthquake in New Zealand killed Michael Hiatt Baker, a young traveller from Bristol, {{and his parents}} established a postgraduate scholarship in his memory, for study at the University of Bristol, which Gascoigne won and took up in 1938. During his thesis studies at Bristol, Gascoigne developed a diffraction theory of the Foucault <b>test</b> <b>that</b> is used for evaluating the shape of large telescope mirrors.

40|$|Abstract—Finding {{the cause}} of a program’s failure from a causal-analysis {{perspective}} requires, for each statement, <b>tests</b> <b>that</b> cover the statement and <b>tests</b> <b>that</b> do not cover the statement. However, in practice the composition of test suites can be detrimental to effective fault localization for two reasons: (1) lack-of-balance, which occurs if the coverage characteristics of <b>tests</b> <b>that</b> cover a statement differ from <b>tests</b> <b>that</b> do not cover the statement, and (2) lack-of-overlap, which occurs if <b>test</b> cases <b>that</b> reach the control-dependence predecessor of a statement cover or do not cover the statement. This paper addresses these two problems. First, the paper presents empirical results that show that, for effective fault localization, the composition of test suites should exhibit balance and overlap. Second, the paper presents new techniques to overcome these problems—matching to address lack-of-balance and causal-effect imputation to overcome lack-of-overlap—and presents empirical evidence that these techniques increase the effectiveness of fault localization.

5|$|Appointed vice-captain for {{the tour}} of Pakistan and New Zealand that winter, Boycott assumed the {{captaincy}} in 1978 for two Tests when Mike Brearley was injured, and brought with him his successful summer form. However, he was replaced upon Brearley's return. While {{the rest of the}} England team took part in warm-up matches, Boycott remained in Lahore and organised a special warm up match where the team would play itself. However he went on to occupy the crease {{for a long period of}} time, limiting the amount of time other players had to practice. He later stated that, as the number one batsman, he should have the most time in the middle. In the second Test match, he scored 79 and 100 not out, increasing his statistics since his return to the England team to 684 runs at 136.80. It was between this match and the third <b>Test</b> <b>that</b> Brearley broke his arm, giving Boycott the captaincy. Boycott led England to a draw in the third match, his leadership meeting mixed reviews.|$|E
5|$|Between Tests, Bradman rested himself {{during the}} match against Northamptonshire, which started {{the day after}} the Test, as Hassett led Australia to victory by an innings. He {{returned}} for the match against Yorkshire. Bradman came in at 1/0 when Barnes fell for a duck and top-scored with 54 as Australia made 249. Bradman pulled many short balls and reached 50 in 76 minutes. After the hosts replied with 209, Bradman came in at 1/17 and put on 154 for the second wicket with Brown, ending with 86 as the match petered into a draw. His innings ended when Hutton caught him in the leg trap. Not wanting to tire his bowlers before the Second <b>Test</b> <b>that</b> started the day after next, Bradman showed little intent to win the match. The batsmen batted unhurriedly and set Yorkshire 329 for victory with only 70 minutes of play remaining and the hosts ended at 4/85. Yardley expressed his displeasure by allowing his part-timers to bowl and then promoting tail-enders to the upper half of the batting order in the second innings. The Australians were booed from the field by the spectators.|$|E
5|$|Bradman rotated the two glovemen {{during the}} tour, and Tallon played in 14 of the 31 {{first-class}} matches, taking 29 catches and 14 stumpings.

He also took a difficult catch to remove George Emmett in the Third Test at Old Trafford, catching a ball that flew to his feet at yorker length. However, Tallon also had some mishaps, with finger injuries inflicted by failing to catch the ball correctly. Tallon had few opportunities with the bat, scoring 283 runs at a batting average of 25.72 in 13 first-class innings, including two fifties. During the Test, Tallon scored 112 runs at 28.00, including a 53 in the Second <b>Test</b> <b>that</b> saw Australia recover to a first innings of 350 after a middle-order slump had seen England take the upper hand.

5|$|Cerebellar abiotrophy (CA or CCA). Recessive disorder, {{homozygous}} {{horses are}} affected, carriers show no signs. An affected foal is usually born without clinical signs, {{but at some}} stage, usually after six weeks of age, develops severe incoordination, a head tremor, wide-legged stance and other symptoms related {{to the death of}} the purkinje cells in the cerebellum. Such foals are frequently diagnosed only after they have crashed into a fence or fallen over backwards, and often are misdiagnosed as suffering from a head injury caused by an accident. Severity varies, with some foals having fast onset of severe coordination problems, others showing milder signs. Mildly affected horses can live a full lifespan, but most are euthanized before adulthood because they are so accident-prone as to be dangerous. As of 2008, there is a genetic <b>test</b> <b>that</b> uses DNA markers associated with CA to detect both carriers and affected animals. Clinical signs are distinguishable from other neurological conditions, and a diagnosis of CA can be verified by examining the brain after euthanasia.|$|E
