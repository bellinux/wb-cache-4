30|$|In {{conjunction}} to kidney dosimetry, individualised dosimetry {{to assess}} BM toxicity is indicated and a dose limit of 2  Gy is accepted [58, 64]. BM dosimetry {{can be performed}} using both imaging and non-imaging approaches [65]. Sequential blood samples are often used to estimate the self-dose to the BM using blood kinetics [10, 58, 64, 65]. In most patients, self-dose is the most dominant source of BM irradiation [9]. However, estimation of the cross-fire effect from large organs (mainly the kidney, liver and spleen) and bone metastases require quantitative imaging [58]. Whole-body scintigraphy is essential in this respect, as the field-of-view of SPECT/CT is limited, and the activity in the remaining body cannot be estimated [54]. Alternatively, urine samples {{can be used to}} estimate the activity in the remainder of the body [58]. Yet, collecting urine and blood samples is labour intensive for both the patient and hospital employees. Imaging is often performed using <b>three</b> <b>to</b> <b>four</b> <b>time</b> points, where blood sampling five up to eight samples was described [9, 58, 64]. Clinical BM dosimetry studies were based on imaging, urine and blood sampling data.

These are outpouchings of the arachnoid mater into the venous sinuses around the brain, with valves to ensure one-way drainage. This occurs because of a pressure difference between the arachnoid mater and venous sinuses. CSF has also been seen to drain into lymphatic vessels, particularly those surrounding the nose via drainage along the olfactory nerve through the cribriform plate. The pathway and extent are currently not known, but may involve CSF flow along some cranial nerves and be more prominent in the neonate.

5|$|Iodine is an {{essential}} element for life and is the heaviest element commonly needed by living organisms. (Lanthanum and the other lanthanides, as well as tungsten, are used by a few microorganisms.) It {{is required for the}} synthesis of the growth-regulating thyroid hormones thyroxine and triiodothyronine (T4 and T3 respectively, named after their number of iodine atoms). A deficiency of iodine leads to decreased production of T3 and T4 and a concomitant enlargement of the thyroid tissue in an attempt to obtain more iodine, causing the disease known as simple goitre. The major form of thyroid hormone in the blood is thyroxine (T4), which has a longer half-life than T3. In humans, the ratio of T4 to T3 released into the blood is between 14:1 and 20:1. T4 is converted to the active T3 (<b>three</b> <b>to</b> <b>four</b> <b>times</b> more potent than T4) within cells by deiodinases (5'-iodinase). These are further processed by decarboxylation and deiodination to produce iodothyronamine (T1a) and thyronamine (T0a'). All three isoforms of the deiodinases are selenium-containing enzymes; thus dietary selenium is essential for T3 production.|$|E

40|$|Background: There {{are many}} {{different}} ways to measure glomerular filtration rate (GFR) using various exogenous filtration markers, each having their own strengths and limitations. However, not only the marker, but also the methodology may vary in many ways, {{including the use of}} urinary or plasma clearance, and, in the case of plasma clearance, the number of time points used to calculate the area under the concentration-time curve, ranging from only one (Jacobsson method) to eight (or more) blood samples. Methods: We collected the results obtained from 5106 plasma clearances (iohexol or 51 Cr-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)) using <b>three</b> <b>to</b> <b>four</b> <b>time</b> points, allowing GFR calculation using the slope-intercept method and the Brochner-Mortensen correction. For each time point, the Jacobsson formula was applied to obtain the single-sample GFR. We used Bland-Altman plots to determine the accuracy of the Jacobsson method at each time point. Results: The single-sample method showed within 10 % concordances with the multiple-sample method of 66. 4 %, 83. 6 %, 91. 4 % and 96. 0 % at the time points 120, 180, 240 and >/= 300 min, respectively. Concordance was poorer at lower GFR levels, and this trend is in parallel with increasing age. Results were similar in males and females. Some discordance was found in the obese subjects. Conclusion: Single-sample GFR is highly concordant with a multiple-sample strategy, except in the low GFR range (< 30 mL/min). Peer reviewe...|$|R

5|$|The War of the Bavarian Succession was {{the last}} war for both Frederick and Maria Theresa, whose reigns began and ended with wars against one another. Although they {{deployed}} armies <b>three</b> <b>to</b> <b>four</b> <b>times</b> {{the size of the}} armies of the Seven Years' War, neither monarch used the entirety of the military force each had at his or her disposal, making this war-without-battles remarkable. Despite the restraint of the monarchs, some early nineteenth-century casualty estimates suggest that tens of thousands died of starvation and hunger-related disease. Carlyle's more moderate estimate lies at about ten thousand Prussian and probably another ten thousand Austrian dead. Michael Hochedlinger assesses combined casualties at approximately thirty thousand; Robert Kann gives no estimate of casualties but suggests the primary causes of death were cholera and dysentery. Gaston Bodart, whose 1915 work is still considered the authority on Austrian military losses, is specific: five Austrian generals (he does not name them), over twelve thousand soldiers, and 74officers died of disease. In minor actions and skirmishes, nine officers and 265men were killed and four officers and 123men were wounded, but not fatally. Sixty-two officers and 2,802men were taken prisoner, and 137men were missing. Over three thousand Imperial soldiers deserted. Finally, twenty-six officers and 372men were discharged with disabilities. Bodart also gives Prussian losses: one general killed (he does not say which), 87officers and 3,364 men killed, wounded or captured. Overall, he assumes losses of ten percent of the fighting force. Little has been discovered of civilian casualties, although certainly the civilians also suffered from starvation and disease. There were other damages: for example, Habelschwerdt and one of its hamlets were destroyed by fire.|$|E

40|$|Growing {{environmental}} concerns encourage the cement industry {{to improve its}} environmental performance, which in turn renews the interest in clinker grinding efficiency. Current knowledge on clinker grinding was built over the past decades, but contributions from fracture mechanics remained limited. This research aimed to contribute to this field by investigating industrial clinkers with innovative techniques such as multiscale microscratching and statistical electron-probe microanalysis (EPMA). Microstructure investigations were first performed with scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and three characteristic length scales were defined for clinkers: the nodules at the macroscale, the clinker matrix and porosity at the intermediate scale, and the clinker phases at the microscale. A statistical EPMA method was developed to allow simultaneous determination of the clinker bulk chemistry, the chemistry of the clinker phases, and their abundance. The microscratch test method was downscaled to measure the fracture properties at each characteristic scale of clinkers. Measurements on single silicate grains provided access to the intrinsic fracture toughness, which was <b>three</b> <b>to</b> <b>four</b> <b>time</b> lower than the macroscale fracture toughness. A combination of microstructure effects and toughening mechanisms (crack deflection, crack tip shielding by microcracks, crack trapping, and crack pinning) explained this behavior. Comparison of industrial clinkers showed that higher macroscale toughness (i. e., poor coarse grindability) was associated with oversized alite crystals, which was explained by the increase of microcracks toughening with larger grain size. In contrast, lower macroscale fracture toughness (i. e., better coarse grindability) was associated with either poorly burned clinkers showing excessive porosity or well burned clinkers having a good repartition of small silicates. However, difficulties in fine grinding were expected for the poorly burned clinkers because of the increased amounts of clustered belite. Overall, this thesis presents new experimental methods to investigate clinkers, as well as links between clinkers properties and grindability, both of which hold interest to the scientific community and the cement industry. by William Wilson.
