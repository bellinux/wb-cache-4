Several theories would be explained; they are propagule pressure, process of invasion, stages and several management theories which include: biological controlling, chemical controlling, mechanical controlling, eradication and prevention. The most basic and important theories would be talked. Then <b>three</b> <b>case</b> studies about invasive species and their management circumstances would be introduced. <b>Three</b> <b>case</b> studies were chosen representatively of three basic management methods of invasive species, they are: 	Hyphantria Cunea in China 	Eichhornia crassipes in Florida 	Mustela vision This project focuses on the discussion part of <b>three</b> <b>case</b> studies. With the explanation and discussions of <b>three</b> <b>case</b> studies, theories of invasion biology would be revised. The possible improvement of management of <b>three</b> <b>case</b> studies will be explored {{during the process of}} revision of the theory part. However, this project explores the answer of the problem of “How could we find a most efficient method to control invasive species?” This follows the perception of using technology of science to integrate society well...|$|R

5|$|Edward Hack {{developed}} {{the original idea}} and model of lemon juice being contained inside lemon-shaped and coloured packaging in the 1950s. The product was then designed and produced by Cascelloid Ltd. Hack presented Cascelloid with a fresh lemon he acquired at Covent Garden, upon which to base the plastic container. Hack had performed significant searches at several markets to find an optimal model. Cascelloid stated that Hack reviewed and evaluated the entire inventory of lemons at Fortnum and Mason’s, Selfridges, Harrods and Covent Garden, the latter of which involved examining <b>three</b> <b>cases</b> of lemons that contained around 300 lemons in each case.|$|E
5|$|The Marshall Court possessed {{jurisdiction}} {{in criminal cases}} only via writs of error from state courts, original writs of habeas corpus, and certificates of division from the circuit courts. In <b>three</b> <b>cases</b> involving certificates of division, the Marshall Court decided issues of double jeopardy, but did not clearly rely on the Double Jeopardy Clause. Similarly, the Marshall Court discussed the level of detail required for a sufficient indictment without explicitly citing the Information Clause of the Sixth Amendment.|$|E

After receiving payment for his services, he sent $100 back to Ohio to Henry Kennon to pay off some debt. That summer he worked for Peter H. Burnett’s brother, Elder Glen Burnett, running his store while Burnett was in California acquiring supplies. While working at the store he sold many supplies to the local Native Americans and learned some Chinook jargon from them.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the court {{vacation}} in August 1904, Hastings decided that {{it would be best to}} find a tenancy in a more prestigious set of chambers; Corbet only dealt with two or <b>three</b> <b>cases</b> a year, and solicitors were unlikely to give briefs to a barrister of whom they had never heard. The set of chambers below Corbet's was run by Charles Gill, a well-respected barrister. Hastings would be able to improve his career through an association with Gill, but Gill did not actually know Hastings and had no reason to offer him a place in his chambers. Hastings decided he would spend the court vacation writing a law book, and introduce himself to Gill by asking if he would mind having the book dedicated to him. Hastings wrote the book on the subject of the law relating to money-lending, something he knew very little about. He got around this by including large extracts from the judgements in cases related to money-lending, which increased the size of the book and reduced how much he would actually have to write.|$|E

5|$|MLB and NPB {{officials}} {{created the}} posting {{system as a}} combined reaction to <b>three</b> <b>cases</b> in the 1990s, involving NPB players who moved to MLB. The first of these occurred {{in the winter of}} 1994 when pitcher Hideo Nomo, with the help of agent Don Nomura, became the second Japanese-born player to play in MLB, 30years after Murakami. Nomo, who was not yet eligible for free agency in Japan, was advised by Nomura that the Japanese Uniform Players Contract's reserve clause limited the Kintetsu Buffaloes' control over him to Japan only. Nomo utilized this loophole by voluntarily retiring from NPB to terminate his contract with the Buffaloes, circumvent its reserve clause and play in MLB. He announced his retirement from NPB in late 1994 and signed with the Los Angeles Dodgers in February 1995, where he won the National League Rookie of the Year award. The following year, the Dodgers signed Nomo to a three-year, $4.3million contract.|$|E

5|$|The {{first report}} of {{nephrotoxicity}} appeared in 1964, when Paddock and colleagues reported <b>three</b> <b>cases</b> of acute renal insufficiency, {{two of whom}} {{were found to have}} calcium oxalate crystals in the renal tubules at autopsy. In 1966, Crandell and colleagues reported a series in which 17/95 (18%) of patients developed an unusual type of nephropathy after operations in which methoxyflurane was used as a general anesthetic. This particular type of renal insufficiency was characterized by vasopressin-resistant high-output renal failure (production of large volumes of poorly concentrated urine) with a negative fluid balance, pronounced weight loss, elevation of serum sodium, chloride, osmolality and blood urea nitrogen. The urine of these patients was of a relatively fixed specific gravity and an osmolality very {{similar to that of the}} serum. Furthermore, the high urine output persisted a challenge test of fluid deprivation. Most cases resolved within 2–3 weeks, but evidence of renal dysfunction persisted for more than one year in 3 of these 17 cases (18%), and more than two years in one case (6%).|$|E
