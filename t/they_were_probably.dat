5|$|During the 2nd century some {{units with}} the new names numerus ("group") and vexillatio ("detachment") appear in the diploma record. Their size is uncertain, but was likely smaller than the regular alae and cohortes, as {{originally}} <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>probably</b> detachments from the latter, acquiring independent status after long-term separation. As these units are mentioned in diplomas, they were presumably part of the regular auxiliary organisation. But numeri was also a generic term used for barbarian units outside the regular auxilia. (see section 2.4 Irregular units, below).|$|E
5|$|Large mounds up to 50 {{meters in}} {{diameter}} are found {{not only in}} Kraków, but also in Przemyśl and Sandomierz. among other places (about 20 total). <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>probably</b> funeral locations of rulers or chiefs, with the actual burial site, {{on the top of}} the mound, long lost. Besides the mounds, the degree of gord development and the grzywna treasure point to Kraków as the main center of Vistulan power (instead of Wiślica, as also suspected in the past).|$|E
5|$|The Crusades {{also led}} to the {{introduction}} of machicolations into Western architecture. Until the 13thcentury, the tops of towers had been surrounded by wooden galleries, allowing defenders to drop objects on assailants below. Although machicolations performed the same purpose as the wooden galleries, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>probably</b> an Eastern invention rather than an evolution of the wooden form. Machicolations were used in the East long before the arrival of the Crusaders, and perhaps as early as {{the first half of the}} 8thcentury in Syria.|$|E

5|$|The {{geographic}} {{origin of}} the onion is uncertain because the wild onion is extinct and ancient records of using onions span western and eastern Asia. The first cultivated, farmed onions {{are the subject of}} much debate, but the two regions that many archaeologists, botanists, and food historians will point to are central Asia or Persia. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>probably</b> simultaneously domesticated by peoples all over the world, as there are species of the onion found the world over. Food uses of onions date back thousands of years in China, Egypt and Persia.|$|E
5|$|Bivalves {{developed}} at the shores of Lake Cahuilla. These include Anodonta californiensis and possibly Pisidium casertanum. Anodonta shells are sometimes found within their own tunnels. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>probably</b> used by inhabitants as a food source or to make shell beads. Gastropods identified include Amnicola longinqua, Gyraulus parvus, Helisoma trivolvis, Physella ampullacea, Physella humerosa and Tryonia protea. These taxa were relatively abundant at {{the shores of the}} lake. Ostracods include Cypridopsis vidua, Cyprinotus torosa and Limnocythere ceriotuberosa. Sponges have been identified in fossil deposits as well. One mammal found in the lake was the muskrat, Ondatra zibethicus.|$|E
5|$|During {{the peak}} {{popularity}} of the breed, three main types could be distinguished. All three are now considered extinct, having disappeared or been merged back into the main Canadian horse population. The first, the Canadian Heavy Draft or St. Lawrence, which disappeared by the late 1700s, probably developed from Shire and Clydesdale crosses. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>probably</b> a popular export to New England, which bred large numbers of horses for Caribbean plantations. The second, the Frencher, sometimes also called the St. Lawrence, was a trotting horse known for its power and speed, resulting from crosses with Thoroughbreds. Mixed with French trotting lines, they {{played a role in}} the development of the US trotting horses.|$|E
50|$|Sylvester and Happy wears vintage spacesuits, too, but <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> fictional (like the two {{characters}} themselves).|$|R
5000|$|Use {{motion and}} {{formations}} {{to spread the}} defense out and anticipate what the {{defense is going to}} do. If one uses motion and the defensive back follows the motioning receiver, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> playing man coverage or blitzing. If no defensive back follows the motion receiver, then <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> playing zone defense, although this tactic has partly faded with the addition of zone blitzes by defenses since the early 1990s.|$|R
50|$|Policemen Robin Decker and John Little {{begin to}} realise <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> {{the only two}} honest cops on the force.|$|R
5|$|From {{the twelfth}} century, burghs, towns that were granted certain legal {{privileges}} from the crown, developed, {{particularly on the}} east coast. They were typically surrounded by a palisade or had a castle and usually had a market place, with a widened high street or junction, often marked by a mercat cross, beside houses for the nobles, burgesses and other significant inhabitants, which were often built in a relatively elaborate style {{and by the end}} of the period some would have slate roofs or tiles. Very little has survived of the houses of the urban poor. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>probably</b> largely located in the backlands, away from the main street frontages. From Aberdeen and Perth there is evidence of nearly forty buildings dating from the twelfth to the fourteenth centuries, with walls of planks or wattles.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not known}} what the {{function}} of the oral setae in extant species is, other than the long sensory hairs seen in some genera such as Anochetus and Odontomachus. In Zigrasimecia, the similar structures most likely did not act as trigger-hairs because they are stout and shorter. Instead, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>probably</b> used for mechanical interactions with their food. The setae may have allowed the manipulation of liquid food, and the unification of the mandibles with other body parts such as the clypeus and labral indicates that they served as a trap for potential arthropod prey, particularly mites and small flies. Zigrasimecia was possibly a generalist predator.|$|E
5|$|The central {{window of}} the North Aisle is a World War II {{memorial}} and a World War I memorial {{is on the other}} side. The Moores Chantry Chapel (or Moor Hayes Chapel) occupying the easternmost bay of the North Aisle, was built by the Moor (alias Moore) family, long resident at Moor Hayes within the parish, and contains some original box pews. At the rear (western end) of the church are two large pieces of oak which make up a Golgotha which once rested on top of the Rood Screen. They are carved with rocks, skulls and bones. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>probably</b> removed from the church in 1549 and cut into 2 pieces. For many years they remained in the graveyard.|$|E

50|$|Two hymn {{boards are}} {{mounted on the}} wall on {{opposite}} sides of the altar. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> from the 19th century.|$|R
5|$|The {{entrance}} hall was flanked {{on either side}} by similarly sized rooms probably accessible from the central courtyard. The one on the west contained washing facilities and a gutter leading to a soak-away in {{the central part of}} the building, the room to the east may possibly have been a guardroom. On the western side of the courtyard were three small rooms which opened out onto the central colonnade at ground level. The function of these rooms is uncertain, but <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>probably</b> used as private accommodation for users of the mansio. The largest room in the mansio lay in the north-east corner, the chamber was heated by a channelled hypocaust system added some time after the building was first completed.|$|E
5|$|The {{reign of}} the first four kings was {{distinct}} {{from that of the}} last three kings. The first kings were elected. Between the reigns of the final three kings, however, the monarchy became hereditary, and as such, the senate became subordinated to the king. This breach in the senate's sovereignty, rather than an intolerable tyranny, was probably what led the Patricians in the senate to overthrow the last king. The king may have sought the support of the Plebeians; however, the Plebeians were no doubt exhausted from their continued military service, and from their forced labor in the construction of public works. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>probably</b> also embittered by their lack of political power, and therefore did not come to the aide of either the king or the senate.|$|E
5|$|There has {{probably}} been a church {{on the site of}} the present St Chad's since before the Norman conquest of England in 1066, and there is written evidence of one from 1094. The Domesday Book of 1086 mentioned three churches in the hundred of Amounderness, although they were not named. Later documentary evidence suggests that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>probably</b> the churches at Poulton, Kirkham and St Michael's on Wyre. The dedication of Poulton's church to 7th century Anglo-Saxon saint Chad of Mercia lends weight to its pre-conquest foundation, although it is possible that it was built between 1086 and 1094.|$|E
50|$|HD 75289 B is a {{possible}} red dwarf star orbiting HD 75289. The stars share the same proper motion so <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> related. Apparent distance between the two stars is about 21.5 arcseconds, {{at a distance of}} 94 light years that would be 621 astronomical units. However, the radial distance between the stars <b>is</b> unknown, so <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> further apart. In any case, one revolution around the primary would take thousands of years to complete.|$|R
50|$|Various {{colourful}} {{stories are}} told about him, such as laying his cloak over a puddle for the Queen, but <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> apocryphal.|$|R
50|$|Tuff layers can be {{encountered}} {{right at}} the very base of the formation. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> a precursor of the later ehrwaldite magmatism.|$|R
5|$|Wristwatches {{were first}} worn by {{military}} men {{towards the end}} of the nineteenth century, when the importance of synchronizing manoeuvres during war without potentially revealing the plan to the enemy through signalling was increasingly recognized. It was clear that using pocket watches while in the heat of battle or while mounted on a horse was impractical, so officers began to strap the watches to their wrist. The Garstin Company of London patented a 'Watch Wristlet' design in 1893, although <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>probably</b> producing similar designs from the 1880s. Clearly, a market for men's wristwatches was coming into being at the time. Officers in the British Army began using wristwatches during colonial military campaigns in the 1880s, such as during the Anglo-Burma War of 1885.|$|E
5|$|Coria and Salgado {{suggested}} that the convergent evolution of gigantism in theropods could {{have been linked to}} common conditions in their environments or ecosystems. Sereno and colleagues found that the presence of carcharodontosaurids in Africa (Carcharodontosaurus), North America (Acrocanthosaurus), and South America (Giganotosaurus), showed the group had a transcontinental distribution by the Early Cretaceous period. Dispersal routes between the northern and southern continents appear to have been severed by ocean barriers in the Late Cretaceous, which led to more distinct, provincial faunas, by preventing exchange. Previously, it was thought that the Cretaceous world was biogeographically separated, with the northern continents being dominated by tyrannosaurids, South America by abelisaurids, and Africa by carcharodontosaurids. The subfamily Carcharodontosaurinae, in which Giganotosaurus belongs, appears to have been restricted to the southern continent of Gondwana (formed by South America and Africa), where <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>probably</b> the apex (top) predators. The South American tribe Giganotosaurini may have been separated from their African relatives through vicariance, when Gondwana broke up during the Aptian–Albian ages of the Early Cretaceous.|$|E
5|$|From {{the twelfth}} century, burghs, towns that were granted certain legal {{privileges}} from the Crown, developed, {{particularly on the}} east coast with distinctive urban building patterns. They were typically surrounded by a palisade, and many had a castle. They usually had a market place, with a widened high street or junction, often marked by a mercat cross. There were houses for the nobles, burgesses and other significant inhabitants, which were often built in a relatively elaborate style {{and by the end of}} the period some would have slate roofs or tiles.

5|$|It was Scots {{that emerged}} as the {{language}} of national literature in Scotland. The first surviving major text is John Barbour's Brus (1375), composed under the patronage of Robert II and telling the story in epic poetry of Robert I's actions before the English invasion {{until the end of}} the war of independence. The work was extremely popular among the Scots-speaking aristocracy and Barbour is referred to as the father of Scots poetry, holding a similar place to his contemporary Chaucer in England. In the early 15th century these were followed by Andrew of Wyntoun's verse Orygynale Cronykil of Scotland and Blind Harry's The Wallace, which blended historical romance with the verse chronicle. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>probably</b> influenced by Scots versions of popular French romances that were also produced in the period, including The Buik of Alexander, Launcelot o the Laik and The Porteous of Noblenes by Gibert Hay.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of William's early years. He was the fourth son of the family, and up until three years before his father died, he still had two {{surviving}} older brothers. For this reason, his early biography is based largely on conjecture. It is known that he managed to establish an independent position for himself through a fortunate marriage. By 1361 {{he was married to}} Joan Montagu, the daughter of Alice of Norfolk, and – through Alice – a granddaughter of Thomas of Brotherton, a younger son of Edward I. The first recorded evidence for his military activity dates from 1367, but he was probably also present in earlier campaigns. His father campaigned in France in 1355–6 and 1359–60, and it is likely that William also took part in these expeditions, along with Thomas Beauchamp, the future Earl of Warwick. The two men would develop a close affinity, and their careers were strikingly similar: they were born around the same time, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>probably</b> knighted together in July 1355, neither was born as heir to their earldoms but came to their titles through the death of older brothers, and both succeeded their fathers in 1369.|$|E
5|$|Poulton is one {{of seven}} ancient parishes of the hundred of Amounderness. Prior to the Norman conquest in 1066, Amounderness was in the {{possession}} of Earl Tostig, the brother of King Harold II. Tostig died at the Battle of Stamford Bridge and his lands were subsequently taken over by the Normans. Between 1069 and 1086 William the Conqueror gave Amounderness to Anglo-Norman baron Roger the Poitevin. In the Domesday Book of 1086 Poulton's area was estimated to contain two carucates of arable land. The survey recorded three churches in Amounderness though not by name. Later documentary evidence suggests that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>probably</b> the churches at Poulton, Kirkham and St Michael's on Wyre. The dedication of Poulton's church to 7th century Anglo-Saxon saint Chad of Mercia lends weight to its pre-conquest foundation, although it is possible that it was built between 1086 and 1094.|$|E
