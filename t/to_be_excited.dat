The only available charge carriers for conduction are the electrons that have enough thermal energy <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>excited</b> across the band gap and the electron holes that are left off when such an excitation occurs.|$|E
25|$|Stimulated {{emission}} {{from the}} N-V− center has been demonstrated, {{though it could}} be achieved only from the phonon side-band (i.e. broadband light) and not from the ZPL. For this purpose the center has <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>excited</b> at wavelength longer than ~650nm, as higher-energy excitation ionizes the center.|$|E
25|$|There {{exist only}} limited {{possible}} states {{of energy for}} electrons, atoms and molecules. These {{are determined by the}} rules of quantum mechanics, which require quantization of energy of a bound system. The atoms/molecules in a higher energy state are said <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>excited.</b> The molecules/atoms of substance in an excited energy state are often much more reactive; that is, more amenable to chemical reactions.|$|E

25|$|If light (photons) of {{frequency}} ν12 {{passes through the}} group of atoms, {{there is a possibility}} of the light being absorbed by atoms which are in the ground state, which will cause them <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>excited</b> to the higher energy state. The rate of absorption is proportional to the radiation intensity of the light, and also to the number of atoms currently in the ground state, N1.|$|E
25|$|Fluorophores {{are more}} likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>excited</b> by photons if the {{transition}} moment of the fluorophore {{is parallel to the}} electric vector of the photon. The polarization of the emitted light will also depend on the transition moment. The transition moment is dependent on the physical orientation of the fluorophore molecule. For fluorophores in solution this means that the intensity and polarization of the emitted light is dependent on rotational diffusion. Therefore, anisotropy measurements can be used to investigate how freely a fluorescent molecule moves in a particular environment.|$|E
25|$|Initially, the {{absorption}} of a photon causes an electron <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>excited</b> into a singlet state of the Q band. The excited state undergoes an intersystem crossing from the singlet state to a triplet state {{in which there are}} two electrons with parallel spin. This species is, in effect, a free radical, and is very reactive and allows an electron to be transferred to acceptors that are adjacent to the chlorophyll in the chloroplast. In the process chlorophyll is oxidized. Later in the photosynthetic cycle, chlorophyll is reduced back again. This reduction ultimately draws electrons from water, yielding molecular oxygen as a final oxidation product.|$|E

500|$|Comer and Edelen {{released}} {{the report on}} their joint probe on April 30, 2012.

Edelen confirmed that his investigation indicated that laws had been broken, and the report {{was turned over to}} the state attorney general for investigation. Minutes after the report was released, Farmer's lawyer made a public statement in which he opined, [...] "I don't see anything in this audit report that any law-enforcement agency is going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>excited</b> about." [...] He conceded that Farmer had declined to be interviewed during the investigation but felt it was unfair that Farmer was not given a chance to review or comment on the final report prior to its release.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the round}} of touring for Vitalogy, the band went into the studio to record its follow-up, No Code. Vedder said, [...] "Making No Code was all about gaining perspective." [...] Released in 1996, No Code {{was seen as a}} {{deliberate}} break from the band's sound since Ten, favoring experimental ballads and noisy garage rockers. David Browne of Entertainment Weekly stated that [...] "No Code displays a wider range of moods and instrumentation than on any previous Pearl Jam album." [...] The lyrical themes on the album deal with issues of self-examination, with Ament stating, [...] "In some ways, it's like the band's story. It's about growing up." [...] Although the album debuted at number one on the Billboard charts, it quickly fell down the charts. No Code included the singles [...] "Who You Are" [...] (...) , [...] "Hail, Hail", and [...] "Off He Goes". As with Vitalogy, very little touring was done to promote No Code because of the band's refusal to play in Ticketmaster's venue areas. A European tour took place in the fall of 1996. Gossard stated that there was [...] "a lot of stress associated with trying to tour at that time" [...] and that [...] "it was growing more and more difficult <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>excited</b> about being part of the band." ...|$|E

He wrote, [...] "I {{do not know what}} this Aether is", but that if it consists of particles then they must be exceedingly smaller than those of Air, or even than those of Light: The exceeding smallness of its Particles may contribute to the greatness of the force by which those Particles may recede from one another, and thereby make that Medium exceedingly more rare and elastic than Air, and by consequence exceedingly less able to resist the motions of Projectiles, and exceedingly more able to press upon gross Bodies, by endeavoring to expand itself.|$|E

After working with the demos produced during the summer with Feldmann for several months afterward, the duo decided they weren't satisfactory, so the band started over with new material. The biggest difference for the band was that it was now half the previous band, with Urie and Smith writing everything. The album was produced by Feldmann and Butch Walker. Urie recalled that they were initially nervous to experiment with new producers, but instead regarded Feldmann and Walker's input positively, regarding their help as [...] "Hey, this is your record, I want to help you with your ideas. So you bring me the ideas, and we’ll help you do that. I don’t want to write anything for you, this is your record, it has to be your voice."

40|$|The {{difference}} {{of the values}} of observables for the time-independent Schroedinger equation, with matrix valued potentials, and the values of observables for ab initio Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics, of the ground state, depends on the probability <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in <b>excited</b> states and the electron/nuclei mass ratio. The paper first proves an error estimate (depending on the electron/nuclei mass ratio and the probability <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in <b>excited</b> states) for this {{difference of}} microcanonical observables, assuming that molecular dynamics space-time averages converge, with a rate related to the maximal Lyapunov exponent. The error estimate is uniform in the number of particles and the analysis does not assume a uniform lower bound on the spectral gap of the electron operator and consequently the probability <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in <b>excited</b> states can <b>be</b> large. A numerical method to determine the probability <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in <b>excited</b> states <b>is</b> then presented, based on Ehrenfest molecular dynamics and stability analysis of a perturbed eigenvalue problem.
