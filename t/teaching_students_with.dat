40|$|To {{determine}} whether general educators perceived {{that they are}} prepared to <b>teach</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> special needs in their classroom, the author designed a survey which was administered to general educators in various elementary schools in a unified school district. One hundred and twenty-two individuals participated in the study. Current educational research and subsequent practice support including <b>students</b> <b>with</b> special needs in the general education setting; therefore, ensuring educators are prepared to <b>teach</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> diverse learning needs is vital to student achievement. The findings of the study clearly revealed that general educators perceive that they are unprepared and further, lack the pedagogical knowledge to <b>teach</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> special needs in their classrooms. The results suggest a need for teachers to attend professional development courses in order to receive specific training and experience educating <b>students</b> <b>with</b> special learning needs. As well, pre-service training that is offered at the university level needs to be developed and expanded, so that education programs embed special education pedagogy and concept development within teacher credential programs. By law, <b>students</b> <b>with</b> special needs are entitled to receive an equal education alongside their non-disabled peers, taught by educated professionals who understand and implement positive techniques in order to address their diverse learning needs.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to survey core content {{teachers}} 2 ̆ 7 (CCTs) perceptions of working with children with disabilities in the subject areas of English, math, science and social studies in two school districts (referred to as school district 1 and 2). The survey consisted of 3 subscales: internal, external and social and were formatted in a Likert-type scale. The research questions in this study are: 1.) Do CCTs feel prepared to <b>teach</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> disabilities across districts and buildings based on the internal subscale? 2.) Do schools prepare CCTs to <b>teach</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> disabilities across districts and buildings based on the external subscale? 3.) Do CCTs see social improvements in <b>students</b> <b>with</b> disabilities across districts and buildings based on the social subscale? 4.) Does subject taught by the CCT have an overall effect on how inclusion is perceived based on the internal and external subscales? 5.) Do age, gender, degree awarded and district influence the way CCTs perceive inclusion based on the external subscale. With a significance level =. 05, the perceptions of CCTs regarding how their school districts prepare them to <b>teach</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> disabilities are influenced by gender (p-value =. 0149) and marginally by school district (p-value =. 0804).

The time delay prompt procedures are different from SLP and MTL procedures because instead of removing prompts by progressing through a hierarchy, prompts are removed by delaying them in time.

Eight schools in Washington County were the first elementary schools to use the closed-circuit television network in <b>teaching</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> instructional television.

All 45 public elementary schools in Washington County were connected to the closed circuit system by September 1963.

The project required over 125 miles of coaxial cable, which was strung by the Bell Telephone Company with the required associated equipment.|$|E
50|$|Most {{children}} with milder forms of mental disabilities {{learn how to}} take care of their basic needs, but they often require training in self-management skills to achieve the levels of performance necessary for eventual independent living. Making and sustaining friendships and personal relationships present significant challenges for many persons with mental disabilities. Limited cognitive processing skills, poor language development, and unusual or inappropriate behaviors can seriously impede interacting with others. <b>Teaching</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> mental disabilities appropriate social and interpersonal skills is one of the most important functions of special education. Students with mental disabilities more often exhibit behavior problems than {{children with}}out disabilities. Some of the behaviors observed by students with mental disabilities are difficulties accepting criticism, limited self-control, and bizarre and inappropriate behaviors. The greater the severity of the mental disabilities, generally the higher the incidence of behavioral problems.|$|E

40|$|For {{inclusion}} to be effective, it {{is generally}} agreed that regular teachers should be receptive to the principles and demands of inclusion. This {{study was to investigate}} attitudes of 561 Vietnamese regular teachers towards inclusive education (IE) of <b>students</b> <b>with</b> disabilities at 24 lower secondary inclusive project schools funded by INGOs across Vietnam.

These attitudes varied {{when it comes to the}} issues of how they understood the general philosophy of inclusion and their perceived ability to <b>teach</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> disabilities. The finding suggested that teachers agreed with the positive benefits of inclusion for <b>students</b> <b>with</b> disabilities.

Data showed that physical educators were undecided about <b>teaching</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> severe disabilities and disagreed with the proposal of <b>teaching</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> profound disabilities in their regular classes. There was a significant difference between attitudes toward <b>teaching</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> severe and profound disabili-ties. Although only a moderate amount ofthe variance was accounted by attributes, results from a forward stepwise multiple regression procedure showed that as the quality of teaching experiences improved and adapted physical education coursework increased, at-titudes toward <b>teaching</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> severe disabili-ties were more favorable.

The sample of teacher participants was taken {{from one of the}} largest public school boards in Ontario, and included teachers of varying years of experience, special education and non-special education teachers, and both elementary and secondary teachers. Results indicated that teachers were generally dissatisfied with their abilities to <b>teach</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> ADHD. Special education teachers seemed to be more satisfied with their abilities to use successful strategies to <b>teach</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> ADHD compared to non-special education teachers, and special education teachers also seemed to be more familiar with related resources and policies compared to non-special education teachers. In addition, special education teachers seemed to have more working knowledge of the nature of ADHD as a disorder compared to non-special education teachers. Results also indicated possible areas for a lack of knowledge about ADHD among teachers in general, including diet, age, and genetics in relation to the nature of ADHD and the propagation of symptoms indicative of the disorder. Years of teaching experience also seemed to play a part in teachers’ knowledge of certain areas.
