25|$|Mark Tauber, senior {{vice-president}} of HarperOne, {{has stated that}} the Green Bible was developed {{with the intention of}} being “the first ever specialty bible that takes the issues of sustainability, stewardship of the earth, what many in the religious community call ‘creation care’ very seriously”. He went further, exposing on the Green Bible’s purpose: “That the Bible has a profound message of sustainability—some might argue, the original message—is not all that surprising. What is surprising {{is that it is not}} one of the first things <b>that</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> mind when most folks think about the Bible and its message... this Bible seeks to change that fact. We believe that the unique and specially added features by some of today's most important thinkers, writers and leaders, across the ecumenical spectrum make it a must-have for those who already find motivation, comfort and inspiration in it and for the many more who might see it freshly as a critical resource in their journey to sustain our planet”.|$|E

Through the negative aspects that Dhumavati represents rise the virtues of patience, persistence, forgiveness, and detachment. Without the revealing of this negativity of life, it cannot be transcended and the secret truths would remain hidden under the smoky veil of illusion.|$|E
