5|$|Babakotia radofilai and {{all other}} sloth lemurs share many traits with living sloths, demonstrating {{convergent}} evolution. It had long forearms, curved digits, and highly mobile hip and ankle joints. Its skull was more heavily built than that of indriids, {{but not as much}} as in the larger sloth lemurs. Its dentition is similar to that of all other indriids and sloth lemurs. It lived in the northern part of Madagascar and shared its range with at least two other sloth lemur species, Palaeopropithecus ingens and Mesopropithecus dolichobrachion. Babakotia radofilai was primarily a leaf-eater (folivore), though it also ate fruit and hard seeds. It is known only from subfossil remains and may have died out shortly after the arrival of humans on the island, but not enough radiocarbon dating has been done with this species <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>for</b> certain.|$|E

25|$|Contemporary {{debate on}} this issue is still fresh; neither side can claim <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>for</b> certain which {{strategies}} will ultimately be effective in defeating non-state combatants. Opponents of the invasion strategy point {{to a lack of}} examples in which occupying or peacekeeping forces have met with conclusive success. They also cite continuing conflicts such as Northern Ireland, Israel, Chechnya, and Iraq, as well as examples which they claim ultimately proved to be failures, such as Lebanon, and Afghanistan. Supporters of the invasion strategy hold that {{it is too soon to}} call those situations failures, and that patience is needed to see the plan through. Some say that the invasions themselves have, in fact, been successful, but that political opponents and the international media skew the facts for sensationalism or political gain.|$|E
25|$|Sadly, the {{conditions}} of Ælfgifu's return to fortune remain unclear. It would have been important <b>to</b> <b>know,</b> <b>for</b> instance, how and what on terms she came to hold the estates mentioned in her will. Those at Newnham Murren and Linslade were previously granted to her by King Edgar and now returned to the royal family, but {{it is impossible to}} determine which of the other estates were part of her dower property and which were inherited or acquired otherwise. As noted earlier, a case has been made for Princes Risborough as having been passed on through the maternal line. If the other holdings were likewise her own, the rehabilitation of her position may have come at a great price, one which considerably enriched the royal family with land north of the Thames.|$|E

500|$|Traditional Chinese {{literary}} criticism emphasized {{the life of}} the author when interpreting a work, a practice which Burton Watson attributes to [...] "the close links that traditional Chinese thought posits between art and morality". Since many of Du Fu's poems feature morality and history, this practice is particularly important. Another reason, identified by the Chinese historian William Hung, is that Chinese poems are typically concise, omitting context that might be relevant, but which an informed contemporary could be assumed <b>to</b> <b>know.</b> <b>For</b> modern Western readers, [...] "The less accurately we know the time, the place and the circumstances in the background, the more liable we are to imagine it incorrectly, and the result will be that we either misunderstand the poem or fail to understand it altogether". [...] Stephen Owen suggests a third factor particular to Du Fu, arguing that the variety of the poet's work required consideration of his whole life, rather than the [...] "reductive" [...] categorizations used for more limited poets.|$|E
500|$|On {{the night}} of March 22, 1969, Abebe lost control of his Volkswagen Beetle; it overturned, {{trapping}} him inside. According to biographer Tim Judah, {{he may have been}} drinking. Judah quotes Abebe's account of the accident from the biography by his daughter, Tsige Abebe, that he tried [...] "to avoid a fast, oncoming car". Judah wrote that it was difficult <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>for</b> certain what happened. Abebe was freed from his car the following morning and brought to the Imperial Guard hospital. The accident left him a quadriplegic, paralysed from the neck down; he never walked again. On March 29 Abebe was transferred to Stoke Mandeville Hospital in England, where he spent eight months receiving treatment. He was visited by Queen Elizabeth II and received get-well cards from all over the world. Although Abebe could not move his head at first, his condition eventually improved to paraplegia, regaining the use of his arms.|$|E

2500|$|After {{returning}} to the country in 1931, he was made editor of the PCdR's main gazette, [...] As later noted by researcher Victor Frunză, the PCdR's clandestine nature and inner struggles make it impossible <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>for</b> sure {{who was in charge}} of [...] by that moment in time. Frunză believes that Roller was one of the young men working under senior activist Ana Pauker; the others were Răutu, Chișinevschi, Vasile Luca, Gheorghe Stoica, Sorin Toma, Gheorghe Vasilichi and Ștefan Voicu. Another fellow communist, Belu Zilber, later noted that Roller was already designated the PCdR historian, and promised an official post in the event of a communist takeover. Such historiographic ambitions prompt historian Adrian Cioroianu to call Roller a [...] "fantasizer" [...] in the field. According to political scientist Vladimir Tismăneanu, Roller was also one of the Jewish and Bessarabian [...] "déclassés" [...] who gained top PCdR positions in the Chișinevschi–Răutu faction, and in fact a staunch anti-intellectual.|$|E
