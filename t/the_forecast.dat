5|$|Once a human-only {{endeavor}} based mainly upon {{changes in}} barometric pressure, current weather conditions, and sky condition, weather forecasting now relies on computer-based models that take many atmospheric factors into account. Human input is still required {{to pick the}} best possible forecast model to base <b>the</b> <b>forecast</b> upon, which involves pattern recognition skills, teleconnections, knowledge of model performance, and knowledge of model biases. The inaccuracy of forecasting {{is due to the}} chaotic nature of the atmosphere, the massive computational power required to solve the equations that describe the atmosphere, the error involved in measuring the initial conditions, and an incomplete understanding of atmospheric processes. Hence, forecasts become less accurate as the difference between current time and the time for which <b>the</b> <b>forecast</b> is being made (the range of <b>the</b> <b>forecast)</b> increases. The use of ensembles and model consensus help narrow the error and pick the most likely outcome.|$|E

30|$|For the {{conventional}} method, <b>the</b> <b>forecasting</b> accuracy of <b>the</b> month ahead daily load profile and fuel price {{of each day}} is relatively low. However, the electricity price is strongly sensitive to the load and fuel prices. Forecasting errors of these input factors may result in non-negligible errors of <b>the</b> <b>forecasted</b> electricity price. For the proposed method, <b>the</b> <b>forecasting</b> accuracy of month ahead average daily load profile and month ahead average fuel price is relatively high. In other words, <b>the</b> <b>forecasting</b> errors of <b>the</b> input factors are small, and <b>the</b> <b>forecasting</b> error of <b>the</b> proposed method mainly originates from the modeling error.|$|R

5|$|In the past, {{the human}} {{forecaster}} {{was responsible for}} generating the entire weather forecast based upon available observations. Today, human input is generally confined to choosing a model based on various parameters, such as model biases and performance. Using a consensus of forecast models, as well as ensemble members of the various models, can help reduce forecast error. However, regardless how small the average error becomes with any individual system, large errors within any particular piece of guidance are still possible on any given model run. Humans are required to interpret the model data into weather forecasts that are understandable to the end user. Humans can use knowledge of local effects that may be too small in size to be resolved by the model to add information to <b>the</b> <b>forecast.</b> While increasing accuracy of forecast models implies that humans {{may no longer be}} needed in <b>the</b> <b>forecast</b> process {{at some point in the}} future, there is currently still a need for human intervention.|$|E
5|$|On April5 a new {{forecast}} was issued, {{calling for}} 12named storms, 7hurricanes and 3intense hurricanes.

30|$|According to the {{achieved}} trend-information, a {{value is}} {{generated from the}} last closing value.

5|$|The Storm Prediction Center(SPC) {{began to}} note the {{possibility}} that a severe weather event could develop on December30 as early as December25, 2010.

These uncertainties remained through December29 with forecasts calling for only marginal hail and possibly damaging gusts. However, the SPC indicated that supercells and more severe weather could result from atmospheric conditions deviating slightly from <b>the</b> <b>forecast.</b> In contrast, forecasts were more confident in a widespread outbreak of severe weather for New Year's Eve; the SPC issued a slight risk outlook for much of the Lower Mississippi Valley and the Ozarks as a result.|$|E

30|$|The {{experiments}} in Fig.  7 show that, compared to <b>the</b> <b>forecasting</b> using a single target fields, using {{a very few}} number of target fields, such as 2 – 7 can almost always help improve <b>the</b> <b>forecasting</b> accuracy, {{as shown in the}} left corner of Fig.  7.

Moreover, when continuously adding more target variables, as shown on the right section of Fig.  7, <b>the</b> <b>forecasting</b> accuracy will actually drop, which suggests that too many correlations may add confusion to <b>the</b> <b>forecasting</b> modules and result in deteriorated results (similar to the case in supervised learning where continuously adding extra features may in fact deteriorate the classification accuracy).|$|R

40|$|Improvements in {{the ability}} to model El Niño and other {{large-scale}} interannual climate variations have allowed for the development of seasonal climate forecasts, predicting rainfall and temperature anomalies for many places around <b>the</b> world.

40|$|Abstract: The theory {{suggests}} that investment activities and monetary policy influence {{the development of the}} global business cycle.

Therefore, the aim of this study is to explain the development of this set of variables by ARs, small-scale VARs and ECMs. The lag length and the rank of the time series models have been determined using information criteria. Then one-step ahead forecasts have been generated. It was found, that the ARs generate <b>the</b> best <b>forecasts</b> at <b>the</b> beginning of <b>the</b> <b>forecasting</b> horizon. However, when <b>the</b> <b>forecasting</b> horizon increases <b>the</b> VARs outperform the ARs. Comparing <b>the</b> <b>forecasting</b> performance of <b>the</b> ECMs, it was found that <b>the</b> <b>forecasting</b> ability of <b>the</b> ECMs in first differences outperform the level based ECMs when <b>the</b> <b>forecasting</b> horizon increases. ...|$|R
