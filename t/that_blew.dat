5|$|The {{submarine}} sank {{only one}} ship, a Greek cargo ship in May 1915, {{but she had}} earlier captured six Montenegrin sailing vessels as prizes in March. U-12 also damaged, but did not sink, the French battleship Jean Bart in December 1914. While searching for targets {{in the vicinity of}} Venice in August 1915, U-12 struck a mine <b>that</b> <b>blew</b> her stern off, and sank with all hands, becoming the first Austro-Hungarian submarine sunk in the war. Her wreck was salvaged the next year by the Italians, who interred U-12s crewmen in a Venetian cemetery.|$|E
5|$|In November of {{that year}} the same group planted a bomb <b>that</b> <b>blew</b> out the front of Nussbaum's house, while {{he and his wife}} were {{sleeping}} there. Nussbaum blamed the bombings on local antisemitism and bigotry, but most of his congregation blamed it on Nussbaum's anti-segregationist activism. Though the congregation officially supported him, a number of members privately urged him to leave Beth Israel and find another pulpit. The synagogue's board of trustees voted to prohibit non-Jewish groups from using the synagogue's premises unless they had prior approval from the board; the intent was to put an end to the interracial meetings that Nussbaum held there.|$|E
5|$|Like {{a number}} of other delta-wing {{aircraft}} designed to cruise at very high speeds, the Valkyrie included a droop-nose that allowed the pilots to view the ground during the nose-high takeoff and landing. The Concorde or Tupolev Tu-144 both used a design where the entire nose section was angled downward, including outer window panels, exposing interior windows that were more vertically angled. In the B-70 design, only the upper section of the nose moved down into a fixed lower section, and the outer window panels moved with it to become more vertical, at 24degrees slope. With the nose raised into its high-speed position, the outer windows were almost horizontal. A system <b>that</b> <b>blew</b> 600F air from the engines was used for both defogging and rain removal. The lower forward section included a radar bay, and production machines were to be equipped with a refueling receptacle on the upper surface of the nose.|$|E

5|$|The sociopolitical {{atmosphere}} of Chicago {{was one of}} ethnic tension caused by competition among many new groups. With the Great Migration, thousands of African Americans from the South had settled next to neighborhoods of European immigrants on Chicago's South Side, near jobs in the stockyards and meatpacking plants. The Irish had been established first, and fiercely defended their territory and political power against all newcomers. Post World War I tensions caused frictions between the races, especially in the competitive labor and housing markets. Overcrowding and increased African American militancy by veterans contributed to the visible racial frictions. Also, a combination of ethnic gangs and police neglect strained the racial relationships. According to official reports, the turmoil came to a boil {{after the death of}} an African American youth who had accidentally drifted into a swimming area at an informally segregated beach. Tensions between groups arose in a melee <b>that</b> <b>blew</b> up into days of unrest.|$|E
5|$|Upon Nubians {{contact with}} the German 17th Half Flotilla, she made the same error as Flirt and mistook the German boats for Allied vessels. Surprised with a hail of gunfire, Nubian {{attempted}} to ram the last boat in the German line of battle but {{was struck by a}} torpedo <b>that</b> <b>blew</b> off her bow and reduced her to a drifting hulk. Amazon and Cossack soon arrived to aid Nubian and engaged the German boats. The Germans scored several hits on Amazon, knocking out two of her boilers before withdrawing. Vikings division of boats also clashed with Kaiserliche Marine torpedo boats. The German 18th Half Flotilla was heading back to Zeebrugge when it sailed into Oliphant′s group of destroyers, engaging them as they passed. Although Viking escaped unscathed, Mohawk suffered several hits, before the Germans were able to break away to the safety of the coast. Near the end of the action, Admiral Bacon dispatched the Dunkirk Division to intercept the German torpedo boats before they could return to Flanders but the Germans were able to successfully withdraw before being caught by these further reinforcements.|$|E
5|$|Clara and Merry flee {{back to the}} {{ceremony}} and the Doctor faces the creature, realising it feeds off memories, stories, and feelings. He tries to overfeed it by offering {{the sum total of}} his Time Lord memories; Merry also leads the citizens in a song of hope, confusing Akhaten who then disappears. However, the Doctor's memories are not enough to sate the creature and Akhaten reappears. Clara returns to help, offering Akhaten the leaf <b>that</b> <b>blew</b> into her father's face on the day he met her mother, which contains an infinite amount of untold potential that Clara's mother never saw because she died early. Akhaten, overwhelmed by the infinite potential it has consumed, implodes on itself and the Rings are saved. The Doctor returns Clara to her home on the same day they left and gives her back her mother's ring, telling her that all the creatures she saved wanted her to have it back. Suddenly Clara remembers seeing the Doctor at her mother's funeral and asks why he was there. He tells her that she reminds him of someone who died and she rebukes him for using her as a replacement, but he assures her she is not a replacement and Clara leaves. However, the moment she is gone, the Doctor's expression becomes grim and closes the TARDIS door from which Clara left.|$|E

25|$|On the Boeing YC-14, the upper-surface-blowing {{design for}} high {{aerodynamic}} lift used two jet engines <b>that</b> <b>blew</b> high-velocity airstreams over the inboard {{section of the}} wing and over special trailing-edge flaps. The large multisection flaps extended rearward and downward from the wing's trailing edge to increase the wing area, thus creating extra lift, which was further augmented by positioning the engines so their jet blast across the upper wing surfaces created still more lift. In addition, {{the placement of the}} engines above the wing prevented the engines from ingesting dirt and debris and shielded some of the engine noise from the ground so that the transport could make a quieter approach.|$|E
25|$|By 21 December, {{the action}} was stalemated. The PAVN broke the tie with a night raid on Houei Ma <b>that</b> <b>blew</b> up an {{ammunition}} depot and a howitzer. On 25 December, the 148 Regiment of the 316th Division launched an relief expedition from Xam Neua. Vang Pao attempted to counter that by having an appeal for surrender taped by a communist prisoner; he hoped to spark mass desertion before the relief column arrived. On 26 and 27 December, he had the appeal broadcast at the enemy via Helio Courier. An RLAF forward operating base at Muang Soui was stockpiled with ordnance; Thai mercenary pilots were slated to fly short strike missions from there against northerly Plain of Jars targets. However, PAVN sappers infiltrated at 02:00 on 1 January 1969, killing one of the onsite U.S. advisors and 11 of the local troops. The defenders trickled away.|$|E

25|$|In January 1669, Morgan brought ten {{ships and}} 800 men to Isla Vaca as a {{rendezvous}} point before launching {{a raid on}} the Spanish city of Cartagena. Because {{he and his fellow}} buccaneers had just captured two French warships, they decided to celebrate in the easily accessible Ferret Bay on the northwest side of the island. They made a fire to roast several pigs and fired the cannons of their flagship as was typical for a buccaneer celebration. In the midst of their drunken revelry, the ship's gunpowder magazine was accidentally lit, triggering an explosion <b>that</b> <b>blew</b> up Morgan's flagship Oxford. In the explosion, Morgan, who was on board the ship, was thrown through the window of his quarters and into the sea. He survived the accident, but the Oxford sank, taking down with it the two captured French warships (which were tied to it) and about 200 of his men.|$|E

500|$|One of {{the injured}} horses {{harnessed}} to the bank stagecoach bolted, pulling the stagecoach with it, chased by Kupriashvili, Kamo, and another robber, Datiko Chibriashvili. [...] Kupriashvili threw a grenade <b>that</b> <b>blew</b> off the horse's legs, but Kupriashvili {{was caught in the}} explosion, landing stunned on the ground. He regained consciousness and sneaked out of the square before police and military reinforcements arrived. [...] Chibriashvili snatched the sacks of money from the stagecoach while Kamo rode up firing his pistol, and they and another robber threw the money into Kamo's phaeton. Pressed for time, they inadvertently left twenty thousand rubles behind, some of which was pocketed by one of the stagecoach drivers who was later arrested for the theft.|$|E
500|$|Farnborough stopped, {{blew off}} steam, and {{launched}} a boat to simulate a surrender. As U-68 closed to , Farnborough raised the White Ensign, uncovered her guns and opened fire with three of her five 12 pounder (76mm) guns. The British gunners scored several hits on the U-boat out of 21 rapidly fired rounds. As U-68 began to sink, Campbell steered Farnborough over U-68s location and dropped a depth charge <b>that</b> <b>blew</b> {{the bow of the}} submarine out of the water. As U-68 began going down by the stern, Farnboroughs gunners scored another five hits on the U-boat's conning tower. U-68 sank with the loss of all 38 men at position [...] off Dingle in southern Ireland. U-68 sank no ships during her brief service career.|$|E
500|$|Soon after {{occupying the}} ridge, Rogers' men {{came under heavy fire}} from two {{directions}} from Oka's forces.

Captain Charles Kelley—commander of one of the companies—took command and deployed the Marines in a perimeter defense around the ridge to fight back. The Marines on Hill 84 were without radio communication and thus could not call for help. The Marines improvised by using white undershirts to spell out the word [...] "H-E-L-P" [...] on the ridge. A Cactus Air Force (the name for the Allied aircraft operating out of Henderson Field) SBD Dauntless supporting the operation spotted the undershirt message and relayed the message to Edson by radio.|$|E

500|$|The {{task group}} moved from Formosa to Luzon in {{anticipation}} of [...] "A" [...] Day, the Sixth Army's coming invasion of Leyte. Strikes were launched against Aparri Harbor and Laog Airfield on October 18 to weaken Japanese resistance to the U.S. Army landings. TG 38.2 was in position for air support of General Douglas MacArthur's troops by the morning of [...] October 21, at which time its air groups conducted further strikes against Japanese installations in Luzon and the Visayas. During the very first strike of this operation, Harris and his wingman Burley tag-teamed a Mitsubishi Ki-21 ("Sally") near San Jose air base. First Harris hit the cockpit from 6 o'clock and left the plane smoking. Burley came in under Harris, and his machine guns flamed the twin-engine bomber. Harris finally came in on a third pass <b>that</b> <b>blew</b> the plane to pieces.|$|E
500|$|During {{the war of}} {{independence}} from Spain, anarchists joined others in the labor movement in distributing propaganda to Spanish soldiers, urging them not to oppose the separatists, and to join the anarchist cause. A few years previously, anarchists had embraced the ideas espoused by Spanish anarchists of organizing not just in unions, but also forming specificly anarchist groups to educate people and commit violent anti-state acts known as [...] "propaganda of the deed", which carried on into the war {{of independence}}. Anarchists placed bombs <b>that</b> <b>blew</b> up bridges and gas pipelines, {{and contributed to the}} failed separatist attempt to assassinate the colonial head Captain General Valeriano Weyler in 1896. This led to the government further repressing of anarchists, closing the Sociedad General de Trabajadores (which grew out of the Círculo), mass deportations of activists, and even the forbidding of the lectura in the workplace.|$|E
500|$|Anxious to revenge {{themselves}} against the Austro-Hungarians, the Regia Marina (Royal Italian Navy) made plans for a sneak attack on the two ships in their berths in the Bay of Muggia, near Trieste, by MAS launches. On the night of 9/10 December, two MAS boats managed to penetrate the harbor defenses undetected, and fired torpedoes at Wien and Budapest at 02:32. The torpedoes fired at Budapest missed, but Wien was hit by two torpedoes fired by MAS 9, commanded by Lieutenant Commander (tenente di vascello) Luigi Rizzo, <b>that</b> <b>blew</b> a hole [...] wide abreast the boiler rooms. All of the watertight doors were open on board the Wien and the ship capsized in five minutes despite an attempt to counter her growing list by flooding the trim tanks on the opposite side. The attack killed 46 members of the crew. Both Italian boats escaped without being detected and Rizzo was awarded the Gold Medal of Military Valor.|$|E
