25|$|The first Richard and Linda Thompson album, I Want to See <b>the</b> <b>Bright</b> <b>Lights</b> Tonight, was {{recorded}} in May 1973 in short time and on a small budget. Largely because of the petrol shortage in Britain {{and its impact on}} the availability of vinyl for records, Bright Lights was held back by Island Records for nearly a year before being released in April 1974. The album was well received by the critics, though sales were less than stellar.|$|E

25|$|It was not {{apparent}} from their records at first, but the Thompsons had embraced an esoteric Sufi strand of Islam in early 1974.

The songs {{for the second}} Richard and Linda album, Hokey Pokey, were similarly written some time ahead of the album's recording and eventual release.

In writing the script, she drew from her own experience of growing up in Las Vegas and the conflict she perceived [...] "between the traditions of Mormon culture in Utah and <b>the</b> <b>bright</b> <b>lights</b> of Las Vegas".

500|$|A {{scene in}} which Craig's {{character}} rides a horse alongside a ravine and jumps down it onto a spacecraft emulated many scenes in American Western films where cowboys rode along a moving train and jumped on it. Favreau said the scene referenced {{the one in the}} 1981 film Raiders of the Lost Ark where Indiana Jones chases a truck and noted that a similar scene existed in the 1939 film Stagecoach, saying [...] "We're constantly referencing back to our roots." [...] Cowboys & Aliens also make multiple references to Close Encounters of the Third Kind, such as the introduction to the aliens through <b>the</b> <b>bright</b> <b>lights</b> on their aircraft and an upturned paddle steamer {{in the middle of the}} desert.

For the closing credits, Ward and Zooey Deschanel recorded a duet cover of [...] "When I Get to the Border" [...] from Richard and Linda Thompson's 1974 album I Want to See <b>the</b> <b>Bright</b> <b>Lights</b> Tonight. The pair found themselves [...] "mutually charmed", according to The New York Times Melena Ryzik, and bonded over similar musical interests. After Ward listened to Deschanel's demos, they paired up and formed the band She & Him. Pitchfork Media reported in April 2007 of a future The Go-Getter soundtrack to be released by Merge Records, including a 12-song tracklist, but Merge later claimed that it was never planning to release a soundtrack.|$|E
500|$|Because {{of their}} [...] "cuteness", viral videos of pet slow lorises {{are some of}} the mostly {{frequently}} watched animal videos on YouTube. In March2011, a newly posted video of a slow loris holding a cocktail umbrella had been viewed more than two million times, while an older video of a slow loris being tickled had been viewed more than six million times. At the time, most viewers did not realize that the slow loris pet trade is illegal or that the docile behavior of the animals in the videos is a passive defensive reaction for dealing with stress. For instance, according to Nekaris, the slow loris with the umbrella—who was suffering from a head wound—was disoriented in the video by <b>the</b> <b>bright</b> <b>lights</b> and was grasping the umbrella like it would a piece of bamboo from its native habitat. Nekaris requested that YouTube remove the videos, but the UK-based newspaper, The Independent, reported that YouTube {{declined to comment on the}} slow loris videos. While YouTube currently has means for viewers to flag videos involving animal cruelty, pornography, and illegal weapons or drugs, it has no means for flagging videos involving illegally trafficked animals. The 'tickling slow loris' video was eventually removed in February 2012, after having received over 9 million views and generating over 12 thousand comments (although copies of it were later reposted). During the lifetime of the video two significant slow loris conservation-associated events occurred, the March 2011 posting of this Wikipedia article and the January 2012 airing of a BBC television production entitled Jungle Gremlins of Java; both events were associated with a spike in viewership of the video, and were often mentioned in the comments made during those periods (3.2% and 13.3%, respectively). Celebrity endorsements stimulated viewing of the video without providing any increase in conservation awareness. Over time, the proportion of comments indicating a desire to have a slow loris as a pet remained high but trended downward, while the proportion of comments indicating awareness of slow loris's legal and conservation status increased after the conservation-related events but did not follow a long term trend. The removal of the video followed shortly after the airing of the BBC documentary, which dramatized the exploitation of slow lorises for the pet trade.|$|E

50|$|In 1955, Robert Thompson and James V. McConnell {{conditioned}} planarian flatworms by pairing a <b>bright</b> <b>light</b> with {{an electric}} shock. After repeating this several times they took away the electric shock, and only exposed them to <b>the</b> <b>bright</b> <b>light.</b> <b>The</b> flatworms would react to <b>the</b> <b>bright</b> <b>light</b> {{as if they had}} been shocked. Thompson and McConnell found that if they cut the worm in two, and allowed both worms to regenerate each half would develop the light-shock reaction. In 1962, McConnell repeated the experiment, but instead of cutting the trained flatworms in two he ground them into small pieces and fed them to other flatworms. He reported that the flatworms learned to associate <b>the</b> <b>bright</b> <b>light</b> with a shock much faster than flatworms who had not been fed trained worms.|$|R

After a highly successful foray by five Type IX long-range U-boats, the offensive was maximized {{by the use of}} short-range Type VII U-boats, with increased fuel stores, replenished from supply U-boats called Milchkühe (milk cows). From February to May 1942, 348 ships were sunk, for the loss of two U-boats during April and May. U.S. naval commanders were reluctant to introduce the convoy system that had protected trans-Atlantic shipping and, without coastal blackouts, shipping was silhouetted against <b>the</b> <b>bright</b> <b>lights</b> of American towns and cities such as Atlantic City until a dim-out was ordered in May.|$|E
2500|$|The {{effects of}} this early {{discrimination}} still linger a half-century later, as documented by the studies of the Adva Center, a think tank on social equality, and by other Israeli academic research (cf., for example, Tel Aviv University Professor Yehuda Shenhav's article in Hebrew documenting the gross under-representation of Sephardic Jewry in Israeli high school history textbooks.) All Israeli Prime Ministers have been Ashkenazi, although Sephardim and Mizrahim have attained high positions including ministerial positions, chief of staffs and presidency. The student bodies of Israel's universities remain overwhelmingly Ashkenazi in origin, {{despite the fact that}} roughly half the country's population is non-Ashkenazi.
