40|$|Synopsis We {{present the}} results of a {{combined}} experimental and theoretical investigation of the mechanics of self-burial of some plant seeds whose morphologies respond to environmental changes in humidity. The seeds of Erodium and Pelargonium have hygroscopically responsive awns that {{play a critical role in}} their self-burial into soil. The awn, coiled in a dry state, uncoils to stretch linearly under highly humid condition because of a <b>tilted</b> <b>arrangement</b> of cellulose microfibrils in one of the layers of the awn’s bilayered structure. By measuring the mechanical characteristics of the awns of Pelargonium carnosum, we find that the extensional force of the awn can be aptly modeled by the theory of elasticity for a coiled spring. We further show that although the resistance to the seed-head penetrating relatively coarse soils without spinning is large enough to block the digging seed, the rotation of the seed greatly reduces the soil’s resistance down to a level the awn can easily overcome. Our mechanical analysis reveals that the self-burial of the seed is a sophisticated outcome of the helically coiled configuration of the awn...|$|R

40|$|Photoprocesses {{occuring}} {{in different}} supramolecular assemblies containing diphenyldiacetylene as chromophore are investigated. Therefore, an amphiphilic diphenyldiacetylene derivative is synthesized which forms monolayers at the air/water interface. The supramolecular structure of theses monolayers {{can be changed}} upon complexation with different polyelectrolytes. The influence of the complexation can be visualized by pressure-area isotherms and BREWSTER angle microscopy. The latter reveals different domain structures for the amphiphile spread on pure water or on subphases containing the polyelectrolyte. UV/Vis spectra of the monolayers indicate a highly ordered structure with a dense packing of the chromophores leading to strong interactions between the delocalized p-electron orbitals which result in {{a change in the}} intensity of the absorption bands. From this change in intensity and an additional shift of the absorption maxima a <b>tilted</b> <b>arrangement</b> of the chromophores can be deduced. Monolayers of the amphiphile/polyelectrolyte complex can be deposited as Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films. Shear forces during the transfer process result in a preferred orientation of the chromophores in dipping direction and the LB films exhibit optical anisotropy.

Whereas 3 D confocal imaging has thus far been limited to steady specimen, we overcome this restriction and present a method to access the 3 D shape of moving objects.

Using a specially designed microrheometer allowing for simultaneous transient optical and mechanical observations, we observed band formation upon reversal of flow direction. It was seen that this band formation causes asymmetric light diffraction in HV small-angle light scattering mode, indicating a <b>tilted</b> <b>arrangement</b> of the regularly spaced bands. Also conducted were shear start-up and flow reversal experiments using a cone-and-plate rheometer under the same thermal and deformation histories as those in rheo-optical experiments for polymers of differing spacer lengths at equal temperature difference below the nematic-to-isotropic transition temperature (TNI). It was observed that, during both shear start-up and flow reversal, the first normal stress difference N 1 +(çø, t) exhibits a large overshoot followed by an oscillatory decay, while shear stress ó+(çø, t) exhibits a large overshoot followed by a monotonic decay. It was found that the higher the applied shear rate, the larger the overshoot of N 1 +(çø, t) and ó+(çø, t), and the longer the persistence of oscillations in N 1 +(çø, t). Similarity was found between the ratio N 1 +(çø, t) / ó+(çø, t) and flow birefringence ¢n+(çø, t) during shear start-up and flow reversal of the TLCPs investigated in this study.

40|$|Comprehensive {{microscopy}} of distal esophagus could greatly {{improve the}} screening and surveillance of esophageal {{diseases such as}} Barrett’s esophagus by providing histomorphologic information over the entire region at risk. Spectrally encoded confocal microscopy (SECM) is a high-speed reflectance confocal microscopy technology that can be configured to image the entire distal esophagus by helically scanning the beam using optics within a balloon-centering probe. It is challenging to image the human esophagus in vivo with balloon-based SECM, however, because patient motion and anatomic tissue surface irregularities decenter the optics, {{making it difficult to}} keep the focus at a predetermined location within the tissue as the beam is scanned. In this paper, we present a SECM probe equipped with an adaptive focusing mechanism that can compensate for tissue surface irregularity and dynamic focal variation. A <b>tilted</b> <b>arrangement</b> of the objective lens is employed in the SECM probe to provide feedback signals to an adaptive focusing mechanism. The tilted configuration also allows the probe to obtain reflectance confocal data from multiple depth levels, enabling the acquisition of three-dimensional volumetric data during a single scan of the probe.

The cluster anion features a central rigid binding site made up of six terminal oxygen ligands and this motif allows the selective binding {{of a range of}} alkali and alkali-earth-metal cations. Here, the binding site was utilised to functionalise the metal oxide-based cavity by complexing a range of protonated primary amines within the recognition site. As a result, a set of four hybrid organic-inorganic hostguest complexes were obtained whereby the interactions are highly directed specifically within this cavity. The guest cations in these molecular assemblies range from the aromatic 2 -phenethylamine (1) and 4 -plienylbutylamine (2) to the bifunctional aromatic p-xylylene diamine (3) and the aliphatic, bifunctional 1, 6 -diaminohexane (4). Compounds 1 - 4 were structurally characterised by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, elemental analysis, flame atomic absorption spectroscopy, FTIR and bond valence sum calculations. This comparative study focuses on the supramolecular effects of the amine guest cations and investigates their structure-directing effects on the framework arrangement arising by locking the protonated amines within the cavity of the {W- 36 } cluster. It was shown that parts of the organic guest cation protrude from the central binding cavity and the nature of this protruding organic "tail" directs the solid-state arrangement of compounds 1 - 4. Guest cations with a hydrophobic phenyl tail result in an anti-parallel assembly of {W- 36 } complexes arranged in a series of pillared layers.

Atomistic simulations were performed using ail isothermal-isobaric ensemble over a wide temperature range from 65 to 665 K for different alkyl chain lengths, n = 12, 14, 16, and 18. The simulations are able to reproduce the essential Features of the experimental observations of this system, including {{the existence of a}} transition, the linear variation of the transition temperature with alkyl chain length, and the expansion of the bilayer thickness at the transition. By use of the distance fluctuation Criteria, it is Shown that the transition is associated With a Melting of the alkyl chains of the anchored bilayer. Ail analysis of the conformation of the alkyl chains shows increased disorder in the form of gauche defects above due melting transition. Simulations also show that the melting transition is characterized by the complete disappearance of all-trans alkyl chains in the anchored bilayer, in agreement with experimental observations. A conformationally disordered chain has a larger effective cross-sectional area, and above due transition a uniformly <b>tilted</b> <b>arrangement</b> of the anchored chains call no longer be Sustained.

One is a phase characterized by a lattice expansion of 26. 5 Angstrom, in which the methylene chains of the CTA ion adopt a <b>tilted</b> bilayer <b>arrangement.</b> This phase, when left in the reaction media, transforms to a phase characterized by a lattice expansion of: 12. 5 Angstrom with no change in chemical stoichiometry. Using X-ray diffraction and orientation-dependent infrared spectroscopy, it has been possible to establish that the observed collapse of the Interlayer spacing {{is a consequence of}} the interdigitation of the methylene "tails" of the intercalated CTA ion. Infrared, Raman, and C- 13 NMR spectroscopies have been used to establish the conformation of the methylene chains in the intercalated normal bilayer and interdigitated bilayer phases of Cd 0. 83 PS 3 (CTA) (0. 34) and the dispersion of the delocalized methylene wagging (nu (3)) and rocking-twisting (nu (8)) modes as a probe of the planarity of the chains. The results indicate {{that a majority of the}} methylene chains in the intercalated interdigitated bilayer adopt an all-trans planar conformation, whereas, in the normal bilayer phase of Cd 0. 83 PS 3 (CTA) (0. 34), although a majority of the methylene units are in a trans configuration, the presence of a few gauche defects is sufficient to destroy the planarity of the methylene chain. Planarity of the methylene chains is the key factor for the absence or occurrence of interdigitation of the intercalated surfactant bilayer...|$|R
30|$|We {{report on}} {{progress}} in growth and applications of submonolayer (SML) quantum dots (QDs) in high-speed vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs). SML deposition enables controlled formation of high density QD arrays with good {{size and shape}} uniformity. Further increase in excitonic absorption and gain is possible with vertical stacking of SML QDs using ultrathin spacer layers. Vertically correlated, <b>tilted</b> or anticorrelated <b>arrangements</b> of the SML islands are realized and allow QD strain and wavefunction engineering. Respectively, both TE and TM polarizations of the luminescence can be achieved in the edge-emission using the same constituting materials. SML QDs provide ultrahigh modal gain, reduced temperature depletion and gain saturation effects when used in active media in laser diodes. Temperature robustness up to 100 °C for 0.98 μm range vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) is realized in the continuous wave regime. An open eye 20 Gb/s operation with bit error rates better than 10 − 12 has been achieved in a temperature range 25 – 85 °Cwithout current adjustment. Relaxation oscillations up to ∼ 30 GHz have been realized indicating feasibility of 40 Gb/s signal transmission.|$|R
40|$|Layered organic {{inorganic}} hybrids {{based on}} perovskite-derived alkylammonium lead halides {{have been demonstrated}} as important new materials {{in the construction of}} molecular electronic devices. Typical of this class of materials are the single-perovskite slab lead iodides of the general formula (CnH 2 n+ 1 NH 3) (2) PbI 4. While for small n, these compounds are amenable to single-crystal structure determination, the increasing degree of disorder in the long chain (n = 12, 14 [...] .) compounds makes such an analysis difficult. In this study, we use powder X-ray diffraction, and vibrational and C- 13 NMR spectroscopies to establish the conformation, orientation and organization of hydrocarbon chains in the series of layered alkylammonium lead iodides (CnH 2 n+ 1 NH 3) (2) PbI 4 (n = 12, 16, 18). We find that the alkyl chains adopt a <b>tilted</b> bilayer <b>arrangement,</b> while the structure of the inorganic layer remains invariant with respect to the value of n. Conformation-sensitive methylene stretching modes in the infrared and Raman spectra, as well as the C- 13 NMR spectra indicate that bonds in the methylene chain are in trans configuration. The skeletal modes of the alkyl chain in the Raman spectra establish that there is a high degree of all-trans conformational registry for the values of n studied here. From the orientation dependence of the infrared spectra of crystals of (CnH 2 n+ 1 NH 3) (2) PbI 4 (n = 12, 16), we find that the molecular axis of the all-trans alkyl chains are tilted away from the interlayer normal by an angle of 55 degrees. This value of this tilt angle is consistent with the dependence of the c lattice expansion as a function of n, as determined from powder X-ray diffraction...|$|R
40|$|Several oligo(p-phenylene-vinylene) {{oligomers}} capped with a guanosine or a guanine moiety {{have been}} prepared via a palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling reaction. Their self-assembly, in both the absence and presence of alkaline salts, has been studied by means of different techniques in solution (NMR, MS, UV-vis, CD, fluorescence), solid state (X-ray diffraction), and on surfaces (STM, AFM). When no salt is added, these p-conjugated molecules self-associate {{in a mixture of}} hydrogen-bonded oligomers, among which the G-quartet structure may be predominant if the steric hindrance around the guanine base becomes important. In contrast, in the presence of sodium or potassium salts, well-defined assemblies of eight functional molecules (8 mers) can be formed selectively and quantitatively. In these assemblies, the p-conjugated oligomers are maintained in a chirally <b>tilted</b> (J-type) stacking <b>arrangement,</b> which is manifested by negative Cotton effects, small bathochromic absorption and emission shifts, and fluorescence enhancements. Furthermore, these self-assembled organic nanostructures, 1. 5 - 2. 0 nm high and 8. 5 nm wide, exhibit an extraordinary stability to temperature or concentration changes in apolar media, and they can be transferred and imaged over solid substrates as individual nanoparticles, showing no significant dissociation or further aggregation...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this program {{was to develop a}} {{calibration}} curve (stress as a function of change in gauge resistance/gauge resistance) and to obtain gauge repeatability data for Micro-Measurements stripped manganin thin-foiled gauges up to 6. 1 GPa in ALOX (42 % by volume alumina in Epon 828 epoxy) material. A light-gas gun was used to drive an ALOX impactor into the ALOX target containing four gauges in a centered diamond <b>arrangement.</b> <b>Tilt</b> and velocity of the impactor were measured along with the gauge outputs. Impact stresses from 0. 5 to 6. 1 GPa were selected in increments of 0. 7 GPa with duplicate tests done at 0. 5, 3. 3 and 6. 1 GPa. A total of twelve tests were conducted using ALOX. Three initial tests were done using polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) as the impactor and target at an impact pressure of 3. 0 GPa for comparison of gauge output with analysis and literature values. The installed gauge, stripped of its backing, has a nominal thickness of 5 {micro}m. The thin gauge and high speed instrumentation allowed higher time resolution measurements than can be obtained with manganin wire...|$|R
