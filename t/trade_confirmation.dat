50|$|In 1993, Edelstein was {{recruited}} by Thomson Financial, {{which was in}} the early stages of developing straight-through processing systems for equity market investors. He was named president and CEO of its newly established post-trade processing business, Thomson Financial Electronic Settlements Group. In that role, Edelstein eventually succeeded in securing an SEC ruling to overturn a longstanding New York Stock Exchange rule that had given the Depository Trust & Clearing Company (“DTCC”) a monopoly on equity <b>trade</b> <b>confirmation</b> services. Thomson’s electronic network replaced the industry’s paper-based processes to enable speedy, efficient, straight-through transaction processing. In 2000, the Boston Globe estimated that Edelstein's Thomson Financial Electronic Settlements Group was responsible for processing one third of the world's daily stock transactions. A year later, Edelstein orchestrated the merger of Thomson's <b>trade</b> <b>confirmation</b> business with a subsidiary of the DTCC to create the new company, Omgeo, which was the first commercial provider of such services. In 2003, Edelstein became president and CEO of Radianz, a joint venture of Reuters and Equant that operated a financial industry telecommunications platform. The company had not yet turned a profit at the time, and Edelstein redefined the Equant's mandate to embrace an early version of cloud computing. After bringing Radianz to profitability, Edelstein facilitated the sale of the company to BT Group, which then named Edelstein CEO of BT Radianz.|$|E

50|$|In 1999, {{these were}} the first retail {{brokerage}} accounts where every communication and business process was conducted electronically. New account applications, account approvals, monthly customer statements and <b>trade</b> <b>confirmations</b> were all processed over the internet and/or sent electronically. ShareBuilder’s automatic investing system was the first commercial program that employed an in-house share accounting system that accepted customer orders for any stock or exchange-traded fund (ETF) on a dollar-denominated basis, instead of specified share amounts. This enabled the investor to set a pre-determined dollar amount for monthly investing and accumulate both whole and fractional shares of stock as the program executed. Most importantly, this form of investing is based on aggregating customer orders across all stocks being bought, enabling the trade cost to be spread across a multitude of buyers and allowing efficient order execution for even small orders. For example, a customer investing only $50 each in Google and Microsoft every month would have their order grouped with thousands of dollars' worth of other orders, enabling better order execution, fractional share purchases and a commission as low as $1 per transaction.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The MPI {{programming}} model hides {{network type}} and topology from developers, but also {{allows them to}} seamlessly distribute a computational job across multiple cores in both an intra and inter node fashion. This provides for high locality performance when the cores are either on the same node or on nodes closely connected by the same network type. The streaming model splits a computational job into a linear chain of decoupled units. This decoupling allows the placement of job units on optimal nodes according to network topology. Furthermore, the links between these units can be of varying protocols when the application is distributed across a heterogeneous network. In this paper we study how to integrate the MPI and Stream programming models in order to exploit network locality and topology. We present a hybrid MPI-Stream framework that aims {{to take advantage of}} each model’s strengths. We test our framework with a financial application. This application simulates an electronic market for a single financial instrument. A stream of buy and sell orders is fed into a price matching engine. The matching engine creates a stream of order <b>confirmations,</b> <b>trade</b> <b>confirmations,</b> and quotes based on its attempts to match buyers with sellers. Our results show that the hybrid MPI-Stream framwork can deliver a 32 % performance improvement at certain order transmission rates. ...|$|R
40|$|While many {{technical}} trading {{rules are}} based upon patterns in asset prices, we lack convincing explanations {{of how and why}} these patterns arise, and why trading rules based on technical analysis are profitable. This paper provides a model that explains the success of certain trading rules that are based on patterns in past prices. We point to the importance of confirmation bias, which has been shown to {{play a key role in}} other types of decision making. Traders who acquire information and trade on the basis of that information tend to bias their interpretation of subsequent information in the direction of their original view. This produces autocorrelations and patterns of price movement that can predict future prices, such as the "head-and-shoulders" and "double-top" patterns. The model also predicts that sequential price jumps for a particular stock will be positively autocorrelated. We test this prediction and find that jumps exhibit statistically and economically significant positive autocorrelations.

Empirical {{studies suggest that}} neither the US nor China can be solely blamed for this discrepancy. Previous empirical studies investigating the effects of Yuan depreciation on US-China trade largely retrieved the data from one side only without even citing which side it is. This study extends the literature regarding the dynamic effects of exchange rate on trade balance, known as the J-Curve Theory, by employing the trade data reported by the US and China independently in empirical assessment. We tested 38 trade commodities over the period 1987 - 2012 and found that: (i) discrepancy in trade data affects the accuracy of testing the J-Curve considerably. (ii) the coefficients suggesting that Yuan depreciation increases the US bilateral trade deficit with China seem much less inconsistent compared with the coefficients claiming the opposite.

This is done by benchmarking three different neural network designs representing a Higher Order Neural Network (HONN), a Psi Sigma Network and a Recurrent Network (RNN) with three successful architectures, the traditional Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), the Softmax and the Gaussian Mixture (GM) models. More specifically, the trading performance of the six models is investigated in a forecast and trading simulation competition on the EUR/USD time series over a period of 8 years. These results are also benchmarked with more traditional models such as a moving average convergence divergence technical model (MACD), an autoregressive moving average model (ARMA) and a logistic regression model (LOGIT). As it turns out, the MLP, the HONN, the Psi Sigma and the RNN models all do well and outperform the more traditional models in a simple trading simulation exercise.

40|$|Changing post-trading {{arrangements}} for OTC derivatives 2 The post-trading infrastructure of OTC derivatives markets {{has not always}} kept up with the rapid growth in trading volumes. Recent years have seen some initiatives that seek to introduce multilateral elements that facilitate flows of information between market participants while preserving the decentralised nature of the transactions. While central counterparties lead to the highest degree of mutualisation, other services, such as central information depositories or multilateral terminations, could deliver similar benefits in terms of information management. JEL classification: G 24, G 29, G 32. Over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives markets have grown rapidly {{in terms of both}} size and complexity since the BIS started surveying the market in 1995. Daily turnover in OTC foreign exchange and interest rate contracts increased from $ 0. 9 trillion in April 1995 to over $ 4 trillion in April 2007 (Graph 1, lefthand panel). Notional amounts outstanding of OTC derivatives of all types increased more than tenfold between 1995 and 2007, to $ 500 trillion at the end of June 2007, which corresponds to an average rate of growth of over 20 % per year. While most of this growth was driven by increasing volumes in fairly standardised (“plain vanilla”) contracts, there has also been a proliferation of new products, some of which are highly complex. The increase in size and complexity of the OTC derivatives markets naturally raises the issue of whether the risks emanating from such contracts are being properly managed. One area which has repeatedly given cause for concern is the post-trading infrastructure of the market, which has often not matched the rise in volumes and the continued development of new and increasingly complex products.

40|$|Food {{retailers}} may enjoy {{market power}} {{by way of}} selling power (ability to control competitors and consumers) and/or buying power (ability to control suppliers). Selling power {{is reflected in the}} market share gains achieved by some distribution channels and groups of enterprises. The double effect of structural factors (consumer behaviour) and economies of scale and scope in terms of logistics, merchandise management and distribution led to the rapid growth of super- and hypermarkets in the past decades and contributed to the emergence of major suburban shopping centres. Market leaders were able to boost their market shares significantly, and the concentration increased, which in turn improved efficiency and accelerated the erosion of the position of neighbourhood shops. High concentration rates in retailing, combined with the structural advantages enjoyed by the retail trade over much of the manufacturing, makes for a substantial potential buying power by the retailer. The extent to which buying power has implications in terms of welfare economics depends very much on the market structures in retailing and manufacturing, but also {{on the extent to which}} competition works at the retailing <b>trade</b> level. <b>Confirmation</b> that the retailing industry has in recent years gained in buying power comes, i. a., from the fact that the main buyers have increased their sales volumes. Their rising buying power is accompanied by a shift of functions from manufacturing industry to retailing industry, larger discounts, insistence on better terms and price and terms negotiations which are largely controlled by the retailing industry. The most efficient method of fighting buying power appears to be the development of strong brands. To a large extent, increasing buying power is also due to intensified competition in the wake of EU membership and structural problems suffered by the manufacturing industry: too small enterprises, excessive production costs, weak brands as a result of the lack of innovation and marketing competence. High concentration rates among food retailers and their resultant market and buying power may be countered only by competitive policy measures (preventive merger control, accompanying supervision to prevent abuse). Structural problems, especially those suffered by small businesses, need to be eliminated within the scope of a structural and industrial policy, with the initiative to be taken by the businesses themselves.
