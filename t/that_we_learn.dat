For [...] reports that at the Tent of Meeting, “Moses called Aaron and his sons, and the elders of Israel.” And in Messianic times {{it will also be}} so, as [...] says: “For the Lord of Hosts will reign in Mount Zion, and in Jerusalem, and before His elders shall be glory.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Yaakov Yosef, {{the son of}} Ovadia Yosef {{who headed}} the Hazon Ya'akov Yeshiva and served as rabbi of the Givat Moshe {{neighborhood}} in Jerusalem, described Kahane as one who [...] "fulfilled his role faithfully", and declared that, [...] "We must learn from [...] great actions in order <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>learn</b> {{the way of the}} Torah."

2500|$|Rabbi Josiah taught <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>learn</b> {{the formal}} {{prohibition}} against kidnapping from the words [...] "You shall not steal" [...] in [...] (20:13 in the NJPS) (since [...] and [...] merely state the punishment for abduction). Rabbi Johanan taught <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>learn</b> it from [...] "They {{shall not be}} sold as bondsmen." [...] The Gemara harmonized the two positions by concluding that Rabbi Josiah referred to the prohibition for abduction, while Rabbi Johanan referred to the prohibition for selling a kidnapped person. Similarly, the Rabbis taught in a Baraita that [...] (20:13 in the NJPS), [...] "You shall not steal," [...] refers to the stealing of human beings. To the potential objection that [...] (20:13 in the NJPS) refers to property theft, the Baraita responded {{that one of the}} thirteen principles by which we interpret the Torah is that a law is interpreted by its general context, and the Ten Commandments speak of capital crimes (like murder and adultery). (Thus [...] "You shall not steal" [...] must refer to a capital crime and thus to kidnapping.) Another Baraita taught that the words [...] "You shall not steal" [...] in [...] refer to theft of property. To the potential objection that [...] refers to the theft of human beings, the Baraita responded that the general context of [...] speaks of money matters; therefore [...] must refer to monetary theft..

2500|$|Rav Ashi deduced from [...] {{that as long}} as {{a person}} has the {{obligation}} to bury a body, {{it is as if the}} corpse lay before the person. [...] says: [...] "And Abraham rose up from before his dead," [...] indicating that he departed from the presence of Sarah's body. And then [...] says: [...] "that I may bury my dead out of my sight," [...] showing that Abraham still spoke as if Sarah's corpse were lying before him. (And this status affects a person's obligation to perform other commandments.). Brooklyn: Mesorah Publications, 1997[...] Similarly, Rabbi Johanan taught <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>learn</b> from the words, [...] "And Abraham rose up from before his dead and spoke," [...] in [...] that one whose dead lies before him is exempt from reciting the Shema (as the verse implies that until Sarah's burial, Abraham did nothing but make arrangements for it)..|$|E
2500|$|It is {{from these}} {{charters}} <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>learn</b> of the obligations lying upon land. The state demanded {{men for the}} army and the corvée, as well as dues in kind. A certain area was bound to provide a bowman, together with his linked pikeman (who bore the shield for both), and to furnish them with supplies for the campaign. This area was termed a [...] "bow" [...] as early as the 8th century BC, but the practice goes back much earlier. Later, a horseman was also due from certain areas. A man was only bound to serve a certain number of times, but the land still had to find a man annually. This service was usually discharged by slaves and serfs, but the amelu (and perhaps the mushkenu) also went to war. The bows were grouped together in tens and hundreds. The corvée was less regular. Special liabilities also lay upon riparian owners to repair canals, bridges, quays, etc. The letters of Hammurabi often deal with claims to exemption. Religious officials and shepherds in charge of flocks were exempt from military duty.|$|E
2500|$|The Gemara cited [...] for the {{proposition}} that, {{except for a}} very few circumstances, a person need not obey God's commandments if doing so would cause the person to die. Interpreting what constitutes profanation of God's Name {{within the meaning of}} [...] Rabbi Johanan said in the name of Rabbi Simeon ben Jehozadak that by a majority vote, it was resolved in the attic of the house of Nitzah in Lydda that if a person is directed to transgress a commandment in order to avoid being killed, the person may transgress any commandment of the Torah to stay alive except idolatry, prohibited sexual relations, and murder. With regard to idolatry, the Gemara asked whether one could commit it to save one's life, as it was taught in a Baraita that Rabbi Ishmael said that if a person is directed to engage in idolatry in order to avoid being killed, the person should do so, and stay alive. Rabbi Ishmael taught <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>learn</b> this from [...] "You shall therefore keep my statutes and my judgments, which if a man do, he shall live in them," [...] which means that a person should not die by them. From this, one might think that a person could openly engage in idolatry in order to avoid being killed, but this is not so, as [...] teaches, [...] "Neither shall you profane My holy Name; but I will be hallowed." [...] When Rav Dimi came from the Land of Israel to Babylonia, he taught that the rule that one may violate any commandment except idolatry, prohibited sexual relations, and murder to stay alive applied only when there is no royal decree forbidding the practice of Judaism. But Rav Dimi taught that {{if there is such a}} decree, one must incur martyrdom rather than transgress even a minor precept. When Ravin came, he said in Rabbi Johanan's name that even absent such a decree, one was allowed to violate a commandment to stay alive only in private; but in public one needed to be martyred rather than violate even a minor precept. Rava bar Rav Isaac said in Rav's name that in this context one should choose martyrdom rather than violate a commandment even to change a shoe strap. Rabbi Jacob said in Rabbi Johanan's name that the minimum number of people for an act to be considered public is ten. And the Gemara taught that ten Jews are required for the event to be public, for [...] says, [...] "I will be hallowed among the children of Israel."–b1.|$|E
