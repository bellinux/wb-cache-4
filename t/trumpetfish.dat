50|$|The Chinese <b>trumpetfish</b> is diurnal and solitary. It is {{a clever}} stealth hunter with two {{techniques}} to catch its prey. The {{first is the}} ambush, consisting of lying in wait for a potential prey close to hard coral, black coral bush, or gorgonian. The second is the discrete tracking, where the <b>trumpetfish</b> stays close to some big fishes (groupers, carangids) or even hawksbill sea turtles (Eretmochelys imbricata) until it {{has the opportunity to}} approach unsuspecting prey. The Chinese <b>trumpetfish</b> feeds on small fishes and crustaceans.|$|E
50|$|Analysis {{of stomach}} {{contents}} of Hawaiian roi found that diets consist of 97.7% fish and 2.3% crustaceans.

Fish species that can be easily spotted in the area include giant trevallies, <b>trumpetfishes,</b> anthiases, groupers and snappers.|$|R
50|$|During {{her next}} Mediterranean deployment, she snorkeled through the Strait of Bonifacio between Corsica and Sardinia. In August 1959, {{as part of}} Atlantic Fleet {{dispersal}} plans, <b>Trumpetfish’s</b> home port was changed to Charleston, South Carolina. During January and February 1960, the submarine took part in operations in the North Atlantic before briefly visiting Scotland. She subsequently participated in exercises in the western Atlantic Ocean, before a major refit at Charleston during 1961 modernized the ship to a Greater Underwater Propulsive Power Program (GUPPY) III configuration. The alterations increased her capabilities by adding 15 ft to her length, by giving her better weapons and electronics, and by extending her range.|$|R

50|$|They are {{relatively}} large for reef fish, where they reach almost 1 m in length. Bodies of <b>trumpetfish</b> are elongated, rigid, and pike-shaped. Their dorsal and anal fins are almost closely {{adjacent to the}} tail, where individual dorsal spines reach midway towards the head region. Similar to {{most members of the}} order Syngnathiformes, the bodies of <b>trumpetfish</b> are inflexible, supported by interwoven struts of bone. A distinct trait of the family is their long, tubular snouts ending with somewhat nondescript jaws. Members of the family have the capability to expand their jaws quickly into a circular, gaping hole almost to the body's diameter when feeding.|$|E
5000|$|On 5 June, after {{participating}} in a fleet naval mine test, <b>Trumpetfish</b> commenced six weeks of pre-deployment upkeep, with sea trials from 12 July to 16 July.
