5|$|A normal dog has {{a muscular}} {{appearance}} {{with a deep}} chest and strong legs. The French Spaniel has eyes of a dark amber colour, and a thick tail that tapers towards the tip. <b>The</b> <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> medium, dense, with long feathers on the ears, backs of the legs and tail. It has some waviness on the chest and otherwise lies flat on the body. The normal colour of a French Spaniel's coat is white with brown markings rather in shade from a light cinnamon to dark liver. Historically, the coat was only white with black markings, but the breed was mixed with other colours of Spaniels during the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|The queen {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} to the worker, {{but they are the}} largest members of the colony. <b>The</b> <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> more abundant, and the head is broader. The mandibles are shorter and broader, although they are still as long as the head. The wings are yellowish in colour and translucent in appearance. Males are the smallest members of the colony and can be easily identifiable by their perceptibly smaller mandibles. The hairs on males are the longest and most abundant among the worker and queen castes, with a long and broad head.|$|E
5|$|It is a small, mouse-like rodent. It {{differs from}} the very similar eastern voalavo mainly in some measurements, such as a greater tail length. It also resembles small species of Eliurus, but the fur is darker {{and there is no}} tail tuft. The fur is soft, short, and thick, and appears dark gray on most of the upperparts, but more {{brownish}} on the sides. On the back, the cover hairs, which form {{the main part of the}} fur, are three-colored: most of <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> gray, followed by a narrow light buff band and a black tip. The longer guard hairs are black. The fur of the underparts is not different in overall color, but the individual hairs are gray for about three quarters of their length and white at the tips, except for those at the chin, which are white throughout.|$|E
5000|$|On 19 March 1954, the Daily Mail printed {{an article}} which {{described}} expedition teams obtaining hair specimens {{from what was}} alleged to be a Yeti scalp found in the Pangboche monastery. <b>The</b> <b>hairs</b> <b>were</b> black to dark brown in colour in dim light, and fox red in sunlight. <b>The</b> <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> analysed by Professor Frederic Wood Jones, an expert in human and comparative anatomy. During <b>the</b> study, <b>the</b> <b>hairs</b> <b>were</b> bleached, cut into sections and analysed microscopically. The research consisted of taking microphotographs of <b>the</b> <b>hairs</b> and comparing them with hairs from known animals such as bears and orangutans. Jones concluded that <b>the</b> <b>hairs</b> <b>were</b> not actually from a scalp. He contended that while some animals do have a ridge of <b>hair</b> extending from <b>the</b> pate to the back, no animals have a ridge (as in the Pangboche [...] "scalp") running {{from the base of}} the forehead across the pate and ending at the nape of the neck. Jones was unable to pinpoint exactly the animal from which <b>the</b> Pangboche <b>hairs</b> <b>were</b> taken. He was, however, convinced that <b>the</b> <b>hairs</b> <b>were</b> not of a bear or anthropoid ape. He suggested that <b>the</b> <b>hairs</b> <b>were</b> from <b>the</b> shoulder of a coarse-haired hoofed animal.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>hairs</b> <b>are</b> {{modified}} spines {{and they}} make many a plant appear almost snow-white; they serve to protect the plant from frost and sun. However, <b>the</b> <b>hairs</b> <b>are</b> only <b>the</b> radial spines of the cactus; they conceal formidable sharp yellow central spines that belie the inoffensive appearance of the hairy covering.|$|R
50|$|The larvae dense white <b>hairs.</b> <b>The</b> <b>hairs</b> <b>are</b> arched, rather long, {{but even}} except for four erect black {{slightly}} curling tufts along the dorsal line, one near each end, {{two in the}} middle, close together. <b>The</b> subventral <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> short, mixed with orange and obliquely down-turned to a row of short black <b>hairs.</b> <b>The</b> head <b>is</b> black.|$|R
5|$|The {{next step}} is to apply hair. The hair can either be done in one of two ways; wigging, rooting or microrooting. when rooting hair is added 1-4 hair strands per plug. When microrooting, hair is added strand by strand. This can take up to 30 or more hours per head. Once <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> finished, the {{original}} vinyl body is weighted with a soft stuffed body filled with pellets/fine glass beads/fiberfill.The weight corresponds with its age to achieve a real effect. Various additions also can be added to give the doll an even more life like appearance. Reborns heads are often weighted, so that owners have to support the head like one would a real newborn. Purchasers can have magnets attached inside the mouth or head for attaching a pacifier or hair bows. Electronic devices that mimic a heart beat, or make the chest rise and fall to simulate breathing are common. Reborns can come with an umbilical cord, baby fat, heat packs to make the reborn warm to the touch, or voice boxes that mimic infant sounds. For preemie dolls, they may come in incubators with a breathing apparatus attached to their nose.|$|E
5|$|The skins or {{heads of}} taiko are {{generally}} made from cowhide from Holstein cows aged {{about three or}} four years. Skins also come from horses, and bull skin is preferred for larger drums. Thinner skins are preferred for smaller taiko, and thicker skins are used for larger ones. On some drumheads, a patch of deer skin placed in the center serves as the target for many strokes during performance. Before fitting it to the drum body <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> removed from the hide by soaking it in a river or stream for about a month; winter months are preferred as colder temperatures better facilitate hair removal. To stretch the skin over the drum properly, one process requires the body to be held on a platform with several hydraulic jacks underneath it. The edges of the cowhide are secured to an apparatus below the jacks, and the jacks stretch the skin incrementally to precisely apply tension across the drumhead. Other forms of stretching use rope or cords with wooden dowels or an iron wheel to create appropriate tension. Small tension adjustments can be made during this process using small pieces of bamboo that twist around the ropes. Particularly large drumheads are sometimes stretched by having several workers, clad in stockings, hop rhythmically atop it, forming a circle along the edge. After the skin has dried, tacks, called byō, are added to the appropriate drums to secure it; chū-daiko require about 300 of them for each side. After the body and skin have been finished, excess hide is cut off and the drum can be stained as needed.|$|E

50|$|Feathered <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> a hairstyle {{popular in}} the 1970s and the early 1980s with men and women. It was {{designed}} for straight <b>hair.</b> <b>The</b> <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> layered, with either a side or a center parting. <b>The</b> <b>hair</b> would <b>be</b> brushed back at the sides, giving an appearance similar to the feathers of a bird.|$|R

40|$|<b>Hair</b> {{microscopy}} <b>is</b> a {{fast and}} simple method for {{the diagnosis of}} various disorders affecting <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> in daily practice. For the microscopy of <b>the</b> <b>hair,</b> samples <b>are</b> collected by either clipping or plucking. The trichogram technique which <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> sample <b>is</b> collected by a standardized plucking method is used for <b>the</b> diagnosis of <b>hair</b> shedding and of alopecia via hair root pattern. In this review, the examination techniques and details are discussed and the most common indications for <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> microscopy including hair abnormalities {{as a part of}} genodermatosis and, infections and infestations affecting <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> <b>are</b> highlighted. ...|$|R
25|$|This breed {{does not}} shed its hair. <b>The</b> <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> either wavy or curly. Many dogs have mixed pattern hair: curly {{all over the}} body but wavy on the tail and ears.|$|E
25|$|On the scalp, <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> usually {{known to}} be lost around the hair line, leaving the densest amount of hair at the crown. Small vellus hair will often replace the hair that is lost.|$|E
25|$|Super Dollfie dolls {{are made}} {{to be easy to}} customize. <b>The</b> <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> a wig that can easily be changed. The head can be opened to change the eyes and adjust the stringing. The face paint can be removed and the head repainted. Optional hands and feet are available, and heads and other body parts are {{removable}} and interchangeable. The resin parts themselves can be carved or sanded to reshape them.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> guard <b>hairs</b> <b>are</b> very coarse and stiff, and overlie a much softer {{layer of}} dense under-fur. <b>The</b> <b>hairs</b> <b>are</b> unusual in lacking a central medulla, and have {{numerous}} microscopic cracks across their surfaces. These cracks are host {{to a number}} of commensal species of algae, including Rufusia pillicola, Dictyococcus bradypodis, and Chlorococcum choloepodis. The algae are generally absent in <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> of young sloths, and may also be absent in particularly old individuals, where the outer cuticle of <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> has <b>been</b> lost. Sloth <b>hair</b> also harbours a rich fungal flora.|$|R
50|$|Both {{male and}} female wore their hair in a long braid until they were married, at which time <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> knotted; man's <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> knotted in a topknot called sangtu (상투) {{on the top of}} the head, and <b>the</b> woman’s <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> rolled into a ball shaped form and was set just above the nape of the neck.|$|R
50|$|In {{the ninth}} century {{there is more}} {{distinction}} between freemen and slaves, as regards <b>the</b> <b>hair.</b> Henceforth <b>the</b> slaves <b>were</b> no longer shorn save in punishment for certain offences. Under Louis the Débonnaire and Charles <b>the</b> Bald <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> cut on <b>the</b> temples {{and the back of}} the head. In the tenth century <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> cut at <b>the</b> height of the ears fell regularly about the head. At the end of twelfth century <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> shaven close {{on the top of the}} head and fell in long curls behind.|$|R
25|$|Often, as men age {{and begin}} to lose their hair, <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> either closely cropped, or the head is shaved {{completely}} free of hair. However, since the 1960s, natural hairstyles, such as the afro, braids, and dreadlocks, have been growing in popularity. Despite their association with radical political movements and their vast difference from mainstream Western hairstyles, the styles have attained considerable, but certainly limited, social acceptance.|$|E
25|$|More specifically, wudu is {{performed}} by Muslims by washing the hands, mouth, nose, arms, face, hair (often washing <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> merely drawing the already wet hands from the fringe to {{the nape of}} the neck), ears, and feet three times each in that order. (It is not obligatory to wash the hair three times, once is sufficient, and men must also wash their beard and mustache when washing the face).|$|E
25|$|She {{is about}} the medium height, perhaps a little below it. Her {{forehead}} is an unusually fine one nose of a slightly Roman curve; eyes dark and piercing; mouth well-formed and remarkably pleasant in its expression. The portrait in Graham's Magazine {{is by no means}} a likeness, and, although <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> represented as curled, (Miss Sedgwick at present wears a cap—at least, most usually,) gives her the air of being much older than she is.|$|E
50|$|Many {{members of}} Salvia have trichomes (<b>hairs)</b> growing on <b>the</b> leaves, stems, and flowers, which help to reduce water loss in some species. Sometimes <b>the</b> <b>hairs</b> <b>are</b> glandular and secrete {{volatile}} oils that typically give a distinct aroma to the plant. When <b>the</b> <b>hairs</b> <b>are</b> rubbed or brushed, {{some of the}} oil-bearing cells are ruptured, releasing the oil. This often results in the plant being unattractive to grazing animals and some insects.|$|R
2500|$|Pubic hair often {{appears on}} a boy {{shortly after the}} {{genitalia}} begin to grow. [...] <b>The</b> pubic <b>hairs</b> <b>are</b> usually first visible at the dorsal (abdominal) base of the penis. <b>The</b> first few <b>hairs</b> <b>are</b> described as stage 2. Stage 3 is usually reached within another 6–12 months, when <b>the</b> <b>hairs</b> <b>are</b> too many to count. By stage 4, <b>the</b> pubic <b>hairs</b> densely fill <b>the</b> [...] "pubic triangle." [...] Stage 5 refers {{to the spread of}} pubic <b>hair</b> to <b>the</b> thighs and upward towards the navel as part of <b>the</b> developing abdominal <b>hair.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Coazzoni: <b>The</b> <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> center-parted and {{smoothed}} {{to the head}} with a long braid at the back; ribbons or netting was added.|$|R
25|$|The {{jewellery}} includes silver pieces, a metal favored {{in regional}} tradition. <b>The</b> <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> tied up, and typically drawn into an elaborate bun resembling a Hindu temple spire, {{and decorated with}} Seenthi. They hairdo may contain a moon shaped crest of white flowers, or a reed crown called Mukoot with peacock feathers (symbolism for Lord Krishna). The dancers forehead is marked with Tikka, and adorned with various jewelry such as the Allaka (head piece on which the tikka hangs). The eyes are ringed with Kajal (black eyeliner).|$|E
25|$|As {{usual in}} medieval art, {{the figures are}} not individualized, but repeat a few stylised types. They have the disproportionately large, oval faces which are {{characteristic}} of Pre-Romanesque sculpture. Their very large, almond-shaped eyes sit in flat sockets with sharply delineated eyebrows. <b>The</b> <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> composed of parallel strands from a central parting. Nevertheless, the facial expressions of some figures are very individuated and match the figures' gestures. Especially relevant in this respect is the figure of Cain who looks up to the Hand of God in heaven with fearful, terror-stricken eyes and pulls his cloak tight around his body.|$|E
25|$|The bathing {{ceremony}} {{takes place}} shortly after death. Today, it {{is held in}} the Phiman Rattaya Throne Hall in the Grand Palace, and is attended {{by members of the}} Royal Family and senior government officials. As with common funerals today, this takes place as a ceremonial pouring of water by the attendees, but the water is usually poured over the deceased's feet instead of the hand, as is done for commoners. After the bathing ceremony, <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> ritually combed, once upwards and once downwards, and the comb is broken. For high-ranking royals, a gold death mask is placed on the body (after sealing the orifices with wax, in times before embalming).|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> often shaved {{above the}} oiled forehead. In the Hallstatt period, {{hairnets}} have been found; in some accounts individual emphasised braids (up to three) are mentioned, but most women tied their hair {{back in a}} braid. <b>The</b> <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> often coloured red or blonde. The seer Fedelm in Irish sagas is described with three braids, two tied around her head and one hanging {{from the back of}} her head down to her calves. Unlike married women, unmarried women usually wore <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> untied and without a headcovering.|$|R
2500|$|The bow is {{held with}} an underhand grip. <b>The</b> bow <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> {{adjusted}} {{so it is}} slightly loose. The fingers of the right hand are used to push <b>the</b> <b>hairs</b> away from <b>the</b> stick {{in order to create}} tension in <b>the</b> <b>hairs.</b> <b>The</b> bow <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> placed in between the two strings and both sides of <b>the</b> bow <b>hair</b> <b>are</b> used to produce sound, the player pushes the bow away from the body when bowing the A string (the outside string), and pulls it inwards when bowing the [...] "inside" [...] Dstring.|$|R
50|$|<b>Hair</b> {{growth on}} <b>the</b> head is noticeably less full than normal, and <b>the</b> <b>hairs</b> <b>are</b> very weak; <b>the</b> {{rest of the}} body shows normal hair.|$|R
25|$|They {{appear to}} {{represent}} boxers, archers and warriors, all standing upright, barefoot and with legs slightly parted. Feet are clearly defined, {{resting on a}} square base. A further characteristic {{is the presence of}} geometrical, decorative chevron (zig-zag) patterns, parallel lines and concentric circles, in cases where it was not possible, for statics reasons, to represent such motives in relief. This happens both for the object and for bodily features. As an example, the braids coming down at the sides of the face are represented in relief, but <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> rendered with incised fish-bone patterns. The archers’ brassard is slightly in relief, while the details are rendered with geometrical engravings. These peculiarities– together with other evidences– demonstrate that the Mont'e Prama statues draw heavily on the Sardinian statuettes.|$|E
25|$|The Kennel Club in the United Kingdom and the American Kennel Club in the United States {{recognize}} {{only two}} varieties of Chihuahua: the long coat, and the smooth coat, {{also referred to}} as longhaired and shorthaired. They are genetically the same breed. The term smooth coat does not mean that <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> necessarily smooth, as the hair can range from having a velvet touch to a whiskery feeling. Longhaired Chihuahuas are actually smoother to the touch, having soft, fine guard hairs and a downy undercoat, which gives them their fluffy appearance. Unlike many longhaired breeds, longhaired Chihuahuas require no trimming and minimal grooming. Contrary to popular belief, the longhaired breed also typically sheds less than its shorthaired counterparts. It may take up to three or more years before a full longhaired coat develops.|$|E
25|$|Cinderella, {{returning}} from {{the last night of}} the festival, describes how the Prince had spread pitch on the stairs to prevent her from escaping. Caught between wanting to escape and wanting to stay, she eventually resolves to let the Prince decide, leaving him one of her slippers as a clue to her identity ("On the Steps of the Palace"). The Baker's Wife frantically tries to convince her to give up her other shoe, offering her the sixth magic bean in exchange for it. Cinderella throws the bean aside, but trades shoes with the Baker's Wife and flees, while unbeknownst to anyone a second beanstalk starts to grow. The Baker arrives with another cow; they now have all four items. The Prince's Steward grabs the slipper from the Baker's Wife, and they are fighting over it when a great crash is heard and Jack's mother runs in to report that a Giant seeking revenge from Jack for stealing his magic harp has fallen from the first beanstalk when Jack chopped it and is dead in her backyard. The Prince, more concerned with finding Cinderella, waves her off and departs with one of the slippers, giving the other to the Baker and his wife. Jack, to the relief of his mother, returns with the magic harp. The Witch discovers that the new cow is not pure white; it is covered with flour. However, the Witch is able to bring Milky White back to life and instructs the Baker and his Wife to feed the items to her. Jack tries to milk her, but no milk comes. The Baker's Wife admits that <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> Rapunzel's, and the Witch furiously explains that the magic will not work because the Witch has already touched Rapunzel's hair, which is also why she had asked the Baker and his Wife to get the objects for her: she's not allowed to touch any of the objects. The Mysterious Man tells the Baker to feed the hair-like corn silk to the cow. Now Milky White gives milk which is the potion. The Witch reveals that the Mysterious Man is the Baker's father. The Witch drinks the potion, and suddenly the Mysterious Man falls dead, his reparation complete, the curse is broken, and the Witch is transformed into a beautiful young woman, reversing the effects of the curse of ugliness by which she was punished by her mother, because the Baker's father stole the beans from her, regaining her youth and beauty.|$|E

It used no machines and no heat. <b>The</b> <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> wrapped on rods and a reduction lotion containing ammonium thioglycolate was applied. This chemical breaks open the disulfide linkages between the polypeptide bonds in the keratin; the protein structure in <b>the</b> <b>hair.</b> <b>The</b> disulfide bonds give hair its elasticity, and can be reformed with chemicals. Next, an oxidation lotion—hydrogen peroxide—was applied to close the disulfide bridges again, and <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> reformed to <b>the</b> shape of the rod.
