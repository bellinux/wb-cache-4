2500|$|In 1995 {{economist}} Robert Whaples {{stated that}} measuring {{the effect of}} the New Deal remains a thorny issue for economists because it is so difficult to measure the effects it had on the country. A survey of academic specialists by Whaples showed that 49% of those economists surveyed felt that the New Deal lengthened and deepened the depression, while 51% disagreed. The same survey also showed that only 5% of professional historians and 27% of professional economists felt the same way. However, economist Eric Rauchway of the University of California stated [...] "very few people disapprove of most of the New Deal reforms", which include Social Security, the Securities and Exchange Commission, <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Deposit</b> <b>Insurance</b> <b>Corp.,</b> and Fannie Mae.

On November 24, 2008, the U.S. government announced a massive stimulus package for Citigroup designed to rescue the company from bankruptcy while giving the government a major say in its operations. A joint statement by the US Treasury Department, the Federal Reserve and <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Deposit</b> <b>Insurance</b> <b>Corp</b> announced: [...] "With these transactions, the U.S. government is taking the actions necessary to strengthen the financial system and protect U.S. taxpayers and the U.S. economy."

The Treasury provided $20 billion in Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) funds in addition to $25 billion given in October. The Treasury Department, the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) agreed to cover 90% of the losses on Citigroup's $335 billion portfolio after Citigroup absorbed the first $29 billion in losses. The Treasury would assume the first $5 billion in losses; the FDIC would absorb the next $10billion; then the Federal Reserve would assume the rest of the risk. The assets remained on Citigroup's balance sheet; the technical term for this arrangement is ring fencing.|$|E

50|$|New owner James Louis Williams {{purchased}} the Cotton Exchange Building in 1985 {{and planned to}} tear it down {{to build a new}} 52-story tower in its place.

Meanwhile, the original lender on the building, First RepublicBank Corp., had failed in 1988, sending the loan to <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Deposit</b> <b>Insurance</b> <b>Corp.</b> In 1991, demolition crews were hired to implode the structure.|$|E

50|$|In 1933, a {{national}} banking crisis prompted President Franklin Delano Roosevelt {{to declare a}} nationwide bank holiday and to order examinations of every bank in the nation. Only banks found to be solvent were allowed to reopen under their previous owners. The rest were either liquidated or opened under new owners and new capital — a process Kirk McLaughlin said {{is similar to the}} way <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Deposit</b> <b>Insurance</b> <b>Corp.</b> handles bank failures today. Security State Bank {{was one of the few}} in the region to reopen without reorganizing.The business continued until 1984 when the family formed the McLaughlin Bancshares holding company and began purchasing other banks, according to a history provided by the bank. McLaughlin Bancshares bought the Idalou State Bank in 1984. When the state dropped its prohibition on branch banking in 1987, the bank opened a branch in Lorenzo — where McLaughlin had briefly operated a branch two years after operating in Ralls. Five years later, the family opened branches in Crosbyton and Abernathy.|$|E
