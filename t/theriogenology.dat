All cows received an additional 4 kg per day of concentrate. Grass dry matter intake (GDMI) was measured 5 wk after the initiation of dietary treatment. Cows were treated with prostaglandin F 2 α (PGF 2 α) to eliminate the endogenous source of P 4, and two intravaginal progesterone-releasing devices (CIDR) were inserted into each cow for a period of 8 days.

The study was performed on 58 large purebred, normal, healthy puppies, born by spontaneous or cesarean parturition. The mean C claws concentrations significantly decrease from birth (26 ± 16. 39 pg/mg) to 30 (10 ± 4. 53 pg/mg) and 60 (6 ± 3. 12 pg/mg) days of age (p < 0. 0001) a decrease was also seen from 30 to 60 days of age (p < 0. 05).

This trend of decrease is in agreement with data reported by (Veronesi et al. 2015, <b>Theriogenology</b> 84 : 791 – 796) in dead puppies, and suggests the important role of C around the time of birth.

Within 30 s, the 30 -μL drop containing the embryo was loaded into the center of a 0. 25 -mL straw separated by air from columns (30 μL) of the same solution. Straw ends were loaded with columns (60 μL) of 0. 5 M galactose in base medium. The straw was heat-sealed and exposed to liquid-nitrogen vapor for 1 min before being plunged into liquid nitrogen. To warm embryos, straws were held in air for 10 s and then immersed in 20 °C water for 10 s. Embryos were transferred into 200 μL of 0. 25 M galactose solution for 5 min, and then placed in PBS or HCDM. Within 10 min, embryos (n = 3 per recipient), grouped for stage and media, were transferred nonsurgically into the uteri of 6 recipients that had ovulated 6 days earlier.

Embryos were transferred in October, at the end of the breeding season. Therefore, quality of available recipients could have affected pregnancy rates. No pregnancies were observed from expanded blastocysts. Potentially, the embryonic capsule, present at this stage, impeded diffusion of cryoprotectants. These preliminary results demonstrate the potential for vitrification of small equine embryos...|$|E
40|$|Breeding {{soundness}} examination data on over 1, 200 yearling Angus bulls {{were analyzed}} to determine heritability of and genetic relationships among breeding soundness traits. Breeding soundness exam procedures {{were consistent with}} those currently recommended by the Society of <b>Theriogenology.</b> Presence of seminal white blood cells (an indicator of seminal vesiculitis), penile warts and persistent frenulums were noted and recorded. Data were adjusted for age at measurement and contemporary group effects. Heritability was high for scrotal circumference, moderate for percentage of abnormalities, low for sperm motility, and near zero for semen white blood cells, persistent frenulum, and penile warts. Genetic correlations between scrotal circumference and both sperm motility and abnormalities were favorable, indicating that selection for increased scrotal circumference should result in higher fertility...|$|E
40|$|In buffalo, {{in vitro}} embryo {{production}} (IVEP) {{technology is the}} best tool to improve the genetic merit through the maternal lineage. A major limitation of IVEP technology in buffalo species is the poor cryotolerance of the embryos, likely due to their high lipid content (Gasparrini 2002 <b>Theriogenology</b> 57, 237 – 256). It was previously demonstrated that supplementing bovine culture media with L-carnitine, a cofactor of β-oxidation, improves in vitro embryo development (Sutton-McDowall et al. 2012 <b>Theriogenology</b> 77, 1632 – 1641). The aim of this work was to evaluate whether L-carnitine supplementation during in vitro culture (IVC) improves blastocyst development and cryotolerance of in vitro produced buffalo embryos. After a preliminary dose response trial, we selected the concentration of 0. 25 mM for the experiment. Cumulus–oocytes complexes (n = 288, over 4 replicates), recovered from slaughtered animals, were matured and fertilized in vitro according to our standard procedures (Gasparrini et al. 2006 <b>Theriogenology</b> 65, 275 – 287). On Day 1 (Day 0 = IVF), zygotes were cultured in SOF supplemented with 8 mg mL– 1 BSA, in the absence (control, n = 143) or presence of 0. 25 mM L-carnitine (n = 145). In vitro culture was carried out at 38. 5 °C under 5 % CO 2, 7 % O 2, and 88 % N 2. Cleavage rate was evaluated on Day 5, when the cleaved embryos were transferred into fresh medium for further 2 days. On Day 7 after IVF, embryo outcome was assessed and all the embryos were vitrified by cryotop in 16. 5 % ethylene glycol, 16. 5 % dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and 0. 5 M sucrose (De Rosa et al. 2007 Ital. J. Anim. Sci. 6 (Suppl 2), 747 – 750). The resistance to cryopreservation was evaluated by assessing the survival rate, {{on the basis of}} morphological criteria, after 24 h culture. Data were analyzed by chi-square test. No differences were found in cleavage rates between the control (81. 5 %) and the L-carnitine group (78. 8 %). The blastocyst yields (calculated in relation to the cleaved embryos) were not significantly influenced by the L-carnitine treatment (40. 2 and 52. 9 %, in the control and the L-carnitine groups, respectively). However, buffalo embryos cultured in the presence of L-carnitine showed an increased resistance to cryopreservation, as indicated by the higher survival rates recorded after 24 h culture (78. 7 and 96. 4 %, in the control and the L-carnitine groups, respectively; P < 0. 01). In conclusion, these results demonstrated that L-carnitine supplementation of culture medium improves the resistance to cryopreservation of in vitro produced buffalo embryos. We speculate that the increased cryotolerance observed in the presence of L-carnitine may be due to a better utilization of the endogenous lipid stores, resulting in improved embryo quality...|$|E
