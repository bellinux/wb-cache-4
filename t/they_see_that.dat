They discuss how they do not feel grown up and how being an adult is not necessarily a good thing.|$|E

Midst the aggressive fighting, the white Madonna takes a speargun and shoots the black Madonna squarely on the chest. The black Madonna falls down and concurrently a soldier pulls the switch on the electric chair. They laugh loudly thinking Madonna to be burnt but as the smoke clears, <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> no remnants are to be found. They rush to inspect the chair closely and notice three letters (לאו) being burnt in the chair. They scratch their head and see {{a vision of a}} bearded man laughing at them. Madonna is shown running from the torture chamber and opens the door, as the video ends with the gun barrel sequence.|$|E
5|$|That night, as Sunnydale sleeps, white wisps float {{from each}} person's mouth to a belfry, where they {{settle in the}} box from Buffy's dream as ghoulish {{skeletal}} figures, with metal-toothed grins and impeccable black suits, look on. In the morning, Buffy and Willow discover {{they are unable to}} speak and become visibly distressed; they soon discover that everybody is unable to speak. The group gathers at Giles' where <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> the news is reporting that Sunnydale is suffering from an epidemic of laryngitis. Buffy and Riley, each concerned that chaos will ensue, find each other attempting to keep order on the streets. For the first time, Buffy sees Riley in his paramilitary role as an agent of The Initiative; he in turn is unaware that she is the Slayer. They exchange a look and then their first kiss, before parting to continue their efforts.|$|E

25|$|During sleep, {{a person}} is in an altered state of mind. Aristotle compares a {{sleeping}} person {{to a person who}} is overtaken by strong feelings toward a stimulus. For example, a person who has a strong infatuation with someone may begin to think <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> person everywhere because they are so overtaken by their feelings. When {{a person is}} asleep, their senses are not acting as they do when they are awake and this results in them thinking like a person who is influenced by strong feelings. Since a person sleeping is in this suggestible state, they become easily deceived by what appears in their dreams.|$|E
25|$|When an {{observer}} measures a quantum system and becomes entangled with it, it now constitutes a larger quantum system. In regards to each possibility within the wave function, a mental {{state of the}} brain corresponds. And ultimately, only one mind is experienced, leading the others to branch off and become inaccessible, albeit real. In this way, every sentient being is attributed with an infinity of minds, whose prevalence correspond to the amplitude of the wavefunction. As {{an observer}} checks a measurement, the probability of realizing a specific measurement directly correlates {{to the number of}} minds they have where <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> measurement. It is in this way that the probabilistic nature of quantum measurements are obtained by the Many-minds Interpretation.|$|E

When the kids arrive at Shannon's party, <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> no one has arrived. Shannon laments about how his bullying ways have caused no one he knows to actually like him, and the kids sympathize with the bully. However, Shannon then reveals that there are several kids at the party, who come out from hiding spots and ridicule Brendon, Jason, and Melissa for being swindled. As their retaliation, the children steal Shannon's lawn gnome and depart from the party.|$|E

Jacqui is about to turn herself in to the police for the attack {{although}} Tony stops her. Tony and Jacqui then begin a relationship and Tony tells Cindy that if she reports Jacqui to the police then he will make her homeless. He then files for divorce. Jacqui then discovers that Tony knew about Rhys and Cindy's affair yet did not do anything so she breaks up with him. Jacqui becomes stressed when she is told to sell illegal vodka by her criminal boss, Trudy Ryan (Danniella Westbrook) and Tony helps her by standing up to Trudy. Tony and Jacqui then get back together and they destroy the vodka although they are shocked when <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> Trudy has robbed Tony's apartment. Tony makes sure that Jacqui gets extra security in case Trudy does the same to her.|$|E

Stark is annoyed {{that they are}} losing, when Lord Azlok storms in and tries to get the truth of where the Doctor is. The Doctor and Seruba have escaped the vault and drive a Jeep to the base, where <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> it's under heavy attack. The Doctor is worried about getting in until Jimmy and Cassie show up with the TARDIS. The TARDIS materialises in the room in Area 51 where Rivesh is dying. In the nick of time, Seruba revives Rivesh. The Doctor asks for the device to be {{activated}} and Rivesh relishes the thought of killing the Viperox. However, the Doctor warns him not to detonate it, or it will completely wipe the Viperox out. Rivesh remains adamant on revenge, but the Doctor reinstates his beliefs and tells him that no-one should {{have the power to}} exterminate an entire species. Rivesh returns the favour of his revival and trusts the Doctor with the device. The Doctor uses his sonic screwdriver on it and then he rushes into the TARDIS and grabs a cable. At that moment, Azlok holds Jimmy hostage {{at the entrance to the}} TARDIS, threatening to kill him if the Doctor detonates it. The Doctor says he isn't going to set it off and explains that one day the Viperox will become a peace-loving race. Azlok dismisses this as madness and advances, but the Doctor connects a cable from the TARDIS console to the device and unleashes a deafening soundwave that affects all the Viperox in the area: the Doctor then orders the Viperox to leave Earth and never return. A furious Azlok vows that the Doctor's time will come, though the Doctor dismisses the warning of his impending death, before Azlok and the rest of the Viperox retreat and flee from Earth. After the attack, Stark thanks the Doctor and Seruba and Rivesh leave in their ship. The Doctor leaves the weapon with Stark in case the Viperox ever return, and Stark warns them to keep quiet about the events. The Doctor suggests that Cassie and Jimmy clear up the Viperox mess. As the TARDIS departs, Cassie and Jimmy hold hands.|$|E

As they approach, <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> the ISS's crew has {{evacuated}} into one of its two Soyuz TMA capsules. The parachute of the remaining Soyuz TMA-14M has deployed, rendering the capsule useless for returning to Earth. Kowalski suggests using it to travel to the nearby Chinese space station Tiangong, [...] away, in order to board a Chinese module to return safely to Earth. Out of air and maneuvering power, the two try to grab onto the ISS as they fly by. Stone's leg gets entangled in the Soyuz's parachute cords and she grabs a strap on Kowalski's suit, but it soon becomes clear that the cords will not support them both. Despite Stone's protests, Kowalski detaches himself from the tether to save her from drifting away with him. Stone is pulled back towards the ISS, while Kowalski floats away to certain death. He continues to support her until he is out of communications range.|$|E

She kisses the sheet music, leaving a lipstick imprint, which Dice later discovers. Dice plans a reconciliation, but is killed by Billie's former producer Timothy Walker (Terrence Howard) after Dice did not pay the US$100,000 from their agreement to release Billie from Walker's contract. At Billie's first show at Madison Square Garden, her management and support crew see a report of the murder on television. They wonder if Billie was with him, <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> she is there and has seen the report. Billie onstage commands the band to stop playing [...] "Loverboy", tells the crowd never to take someone for granted, and that if you love them, you should tell them, because you might never have the chance to tell them how you really feel.

Bubblegum agrees to perform an experimental procedure which extracts the vampiric essence from Marceline's body, but is unsure of whether it has worked or not. As Marceline recovers, the extracted essence gains {{a mind of its}} own and escapes.

Meanwhile, Jake encounters the vampires Marceline had previously killed, now resurrected from Marceline's freed vampiric essence.|$|E
