We show that the implementation of an emergency delivery option allows an augmentation of the fraction of customers served by lateral <b>transhipments</b> <b>and</b> that increased resupply flexibility enables increasingly important cost savings.

40|$|This {{paper offers}} {{a tool for}} {{analysing}} patterns of maritime supply chains. The study uses empirical data on slot capacity deployed by container shipping lines for analysing ports (as nodes) and routes and shipping lines (as links) that are embedded within the maritime supply chain. The ports of Singapore and Hong Kong are chosen to illustrate the respective <b>transhipment</b> <b>and</b> gateway perspectives. Findings reveal that geographical location {{and changes in the}} constitution of players can have reverberations on the maritime supply chain dynamics that traverse the port. Furthermore, evidence from trade route data also shows that maritime supply chain dynamics associated with <b>transhipment</b> <b>and</b> gateway ports could be governed by different levels of scope economies, demand complementarity and market power. The paper illustrates the abundant potential of slot capacity analysis for academic and industry/market research. Thus, future research can be pursued in various contexts and for different applications...|$|R

30|$|Taking {{into account}} the <b>transhipment</b> <b>and</b> third party costs, the rail freight {{operator}} would have to identify ways to reduce to cost. Also {{there were a number}} of operational requirements, such as a frequent service operated in conjunction with passenger timetables. Linking to the previous discussion, the bundling of goods could lead to increased volumes, facilitating a multi-stop service. The interview with P&G suggested that multi-stop train services were not feasible without fast <b>and</b> reliable <b>transhipment,</b> where a freight train stopped in a terminal for only short transit time – much like passenger train station stops. Such faster transhipment was unrealistic using traditional vertical <b>transhipment</b> techniques <b>and</b> equipment (forklift or gantry crane), leading us to recommend that a new transhipment technique would be required to reduce the building and operations cost of a rail terminal.|$|R
