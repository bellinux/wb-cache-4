25|$|Two {{years before}} their ascent, Grove had {{stood in the}} Hotel Royal in Chamouni (Chamonix), trying to persuade two young ladies and their father, who were using a {{telescope}} to view the peaks around Mont Blanc, that a black dot on the summit snowfield was not a person, but a distant rock some hundreds of feet in height. By chance they espied a real group of climbers, appearing as extremely small dots making {{their way across the}} Dôme du Goûter. Attempting to devise for them some imaginary route by which they might have reached that point, Grove showed them the fine snow crest descending in a gentle curve from the sharp and still unclimbed summit of the Aiguille de Bionnassay. The <b>thought</b> <b>then</b> struck him that an expedition to the summit, with an exit down the eastern ridge towards the easy Dôme du Goûter might actually make a fine undertaking.|$|E
25|$|In March, {{others were}} accused of witchcraft: Martha Corey, child Dorothy Good, and Rebecca Nurse in Salem Village, and Rachel Clinton in nearby Ipswich. Martha Corey had {{expressed}} skepticism about {{the credibility of the}} girls' accusations and thus drawn attention. The charges against her and Rebecca Nurse deeply troubled the community because Martha Corey was a full covenanted member of the Church in Salem Village, as was Rebecca Nurse in the Church in Salem Town. If such upstanding people could be witches, the townspeople <b>thought,</b> <b>then</b> anybody could be a witch, and church membership was no protection from accusation. Dorothy Good, the daughter of Sarah Good, was only four years old, but not exempted from questioning by the magistrates; her answers were construed as a confession that implicated her mother. In Ipswich, Rachel Clinton was arrested for witchcraft at the end of March on independent charges unrelated to the afflictions of the girls in Salem Village.|$|E
25|$|Private grade {{schools were}} {{operating}} in Livermore from the 1860s on. The Livermore Collegiate Institute {{was founded in}} 1870, and the Union High School (later called Livermore High) graduated its first class of students in 1896. Petroleum was discovered near Livermore and become a valuable asset. Extensive coal deposits were mined near Corral Hollow by the Livermore Coal Company. In September 1871 Laddsville mostly burned down, and the people rebuilt their homes and businesses nearer the railroad {{in what is now}} downtown Livermore. Until 1875 the townspeople enjoyed bull fights in a small bullring on many Sundays, and on other occasions a captured grizzly bear might be pitted against a longhorn bull. Apparently, roping a grizzly was <b>thought</b> <b>then</b> to be a great sport. As the town grew there were a fire company, churches, a bank, and a library that were formed by 1876. Livermore was officially incorporated by the state as a city on April 15, 1876, its original city limits being the line a block north of 1st Street on the north and Livermore Avenue (then Lizzie Street) on the east. The part of the west side north of 5th Street was bounded by Q Street, and the part of it south of 5th Street by I Street. The part of the south side east of I Street was bounded by 6th Street, and the part of it west of I Street by 5th Street.|$|E

2500|$|The investigation, {{known as}} the Siegal {{committee}}, found heated debate among the staff over affirmative action hiring, as Blair is African American. Jonathan Landman, Blair's editor, told the Siegal committee he felt that Blair's being black played a large part in the younger man's initial promotion in 2001 to full-time staffer. [...] "I think race was the decisive factor in his promotion," [...] he said. [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>then</b> and I think {{now that it was}} the wrong decision." ...|$|E
2500|$|Russell {{was born}} in Stroud, Gloucestershire, England. [...] He gained the support he needed to become a {{first-class}} cricketer from his father, John, at Stroud Cricket Club, and at Archway School. Two days before his fourteenth birthday, he saw a catch on television: McCosker, caught Knott, bowled Greig, at Headingley in 1977. Russell himself has commented: [...] "Low-down, one-handed, across first-slip. Brilliant. I <b>thought</b> <b>then</b> that I {{would like to be}} able to do that. That's where it started; that was the inspiration [...]" ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{the game}} spread {{throughout}} Texas, hold 'em {{was introduced to}} Las Vegas in 1967 {{by a group of}} Texan gamblers and card players, including Crandell Addington, Doyle Brunson, and Amarillo Slim. This is when [...] "ace high" [...] was changed from the original form in which aces were low. [...] Addington said {{the first time he saw}} the game was in 1959. [...] "They didn't call it Texas hold 'em at the time, they just called it hold 'em.… I <b>thought</b> <b>then</b> that if it were to catch on, it would become the game. Draw poker, you bet only twice; hold 'em, you bet four times. That meant you could play strategically. This was more of a thinking man's game." ...|$|E
2500|$|During development, skeptical {{elements}} of the Air Ministry had expected mature piston-powered aircraft types to exceed {{the capabilities of the}} Meteor in all respects except that of speed; thus, the performance of early Meteors was considered favourable for the interceptor mission, being capable of out-diving the majority of enemy aircraft. The conclusion of in-service trials conducted between the Meteor F.3. and the Hawker Tempest V was that the performance of the Meteor exceeded the Tempest in almost all respects and that, barring some manoeuvrability issues, the Meteor could be considered a capable all-round fighter. Pilots formerly flying piston-engine aircraft often described the Meteor as being exciting to fly. Ex-RAF pilot Norman Tebbit stated of his experience of the Meteor: [...] "Get airborne, up with the wheels, hold it low until you were about 380 knots, pull it up and she would go up, well we <b>thought</b> <b>then,</b> like a rocket".|$|E
2500|$|At {{the age of}} 12, {{shortly before}} the end of his first year at the [...] in Basel, Jung was pushed to the ground by another boy so hard that he {{momentarily}} lost consciousness. (Jung later recognized that the incident was his fault, indirectly.) A <b>thought</b> <b>then</b> came to him—"now you won't {{have to go to school}} anymore." [...] From then on, whenever he walked to school or began homework, he fainted. He remained at home for the next six months until he overheard his father speaking hurriedly to a visitor about the boy's future ability to support himself. They suspected he had epilepsy. Confronted with the reality of his family's poverty, he realized the need for academic excellence. He went into his father's study and began poring over Latin grammar. He fainted three more times but eventually overcame the urge and did not faint again. This event, Jung later recalled, [...] "was when I learned what a neurosis is." ...|$|E

2500|$|Desperate for cash, Miller fell to {{churning}} out pornography on commission for an Oklahoma oil baron at a dollar per page, {{but after two}} 100-page stories that brought him US$200, he could do no more. Now he wanted to tour the United States by car and write about it. He got a US$750 advance and persuaded the oil man's agent to advance him another $200. He was preparing to leave on the trip but still had not provided the work promised. He <b>thought</b> <b>then</b> of Caresse. She was already pitching in ideas and pieces of writing to Anaïs Nin's New York City smut club for fun, not money. In her journal, Nin wrote, [...] "Harvey Breit, Robert Duncan, George Barker, Caresse Crosby, all of us concentrating our skills in a tour de force, supplying the old man with such an abundance of perverse felicities, that now he begged for more." [...] Caresse was facile and clever, wrote easily and quickly, with little effort.|$|E
2500|$|The most {{systematic}} and extensive movement , however, {{was made in}} New England. [...] "The New England Emigrant Aid Company," [...] which had been chartered by the legislature of Massachusetts in April, was then called [...] "The Massachusetts Emigrant Aid Society." [...] But afterwards a new charter was obtained for [...] "The New England Emigrant Aid Company." [...] The men engaged in it, Eli Thayer, Amos A. Lawrence, and others, began their work at once, arousing public interest and making arrangements to facilitate emigration to Kansas. As early as June, 1854, they sent Dr. Charles Robinson, of Fitchburg, and Mr. Charles H. Branscomb, of Holyoke, to explore the territory and select a site for a colony ... Dr. Robinson [...] his party climbed the hill along this spur, and looked off over what was afterwards the site of Lawrence. They marked {{the beauty of the}} spot and the magnificence of the view. Whether they <b>thought</b> <b>then</b> of what might afterwards occur is not known; but when the time came to select a location for the first colony, Dr. Robinson remembered this view from the hilltop, and this doubtless had much to do in the final decision. When he was asked, therefore, to go and explore the country with a view to locating colonies, it was not altogether an unknown land to him.|$|E
2500|$|The American {{businessman}} and explorer Samuel Phillips Verner travelled to Africa in 1904 under {{contract from the}} Louisiana Purchase Exposition (St. Louis World Fair) to bring back an assortment of pygmies {{to be part of}} an exhibition. To demonstrate the fledgling discipline of anthropology, the noted scientist W. J. McGee intended to display [...] "representatives of all the world's peoples, ranging from smallest pygmies to the most gigantic peoples, from the darkest blacks to the dominant whites" [...] to show what was commonly <b>thought</b> <b>then</b> to be a sort of cultural evolution. Verner discovered Ota Benga while 'en route' to a Batwa village visited previously; he negotiated Benga's release from the slave traders for a pound of salt and a bolt of cloth. Verner later claimed Benga was rescued from the cannibals by him. The two spent several weeks together before reaching the village. There the villagers had developed distrust for the muzungu (white man) due to the abuses of King Leopold's forces. Verner was unable to recruit any villagers to join him until Benga spoke of the muzungu saving his life, the bond that had grown between them, and his own curiosity about the world Verner came from. Four Batwa, all male, ultimately accompanied them. Verner recruited other Africans who were not pygmies: five men from the Bakuba, including the son of King Ndombe, ruler of the Bakuba, and other related peoples– [...] "Red Africans" [...] as they were collectively labeled by contemporary anthropologists.|$|E

2500|$|Deepak Chopra, {{founding}} {{president of}} Maharishi Ayur-Veda Products International, Inc (MAPI), the American Association of Ayurvedic Medicine and former {{medical director of}} the Maharishi Ayurveda Health Center for Stress Management and Behavioral Medicine, says, according to Stephen Barrett {{in an article in the}} journal Alternative Medicine and Ethics, that [...] "If you have happy <b>thoughts,</b> <b>then</b> you make happy molecules. On the other hand, if you have sad thoughts, and angry thoughts, and hostile <b>thoughts,</b> <b>then</b> you make those molecules which may depress the immune system and make you more susceptible to disease." [...] Barrett goes on to say that, while the TM technique and other relaxation techniques may temporarily relieve stress, claims made by Chopra that happy or sad thought may affect the molecular levels of the body and the immune system have no scientific basis.|$|R
