Conventional {{methods for}} {{reducing}} the pulsed thermographic responses of delaminations tend to overestimate the size of <b>the</b> <b>flaw.</b> Since <b>the</b> heat diffuses in the plane parallel to the surface, the resulting temperature profile over <b>the</b> <b>flaw</b> is larger than <b>the</b> <b>flaw.</b> A variational method is presented {{for reducing the}} thermographic data to produce an estimated size for <b>the</b> <b>flaw</b> that is {{much closer to the}} true size of <b>the</b> <b>flaw.</b> <b>The</b> size is determined from the spatial thermal response of the exterior surface above <b>the</b> <b>flaw</b> and a constraint on the length of the contour surrounding <b>the</b> <b>flaw.</b> <b>The</b> technique is applied to experimental data acquired on a flat bottom hole composite specimen...|$|R

This singularity, <b>the</b> <b>Flaw,</b> rests within <b>the</b> Way's plasma tube (which in turn is sustained by <b>the</b> <b>Flaw).</b> <b>The</b> <b>Flaw</b> 'produces' gravity by actively repulsing matter away from itself in an acceleration at {{the square of the}} distance away from itself. In addition, any object encircling <b>the</b> <b>Flaw,</b> and then exerting pressure against it, experiences this pressure as a translation force along <b>the</b> <b>Flaw's</b> length perpendicular to the direction of force. The motion thus induced is controllable by the angle at which an annular ring enclosure is pressed against <b>the</b> <b>Flaw.</b> <b>The</b> same spatial transform also can be used to turn tip turbines in order to generate electricity. <b>The</b> <b>Flaw</b> permits a violation of the First Law of Thermodynamics, therefore defining the Way as a perpetual motion machine of the First Order, making energy out of nothing.|$|R

5|$|Clement criticizes Greek paganism in the Protrepticus on {{the basis}} that its deities are both false and poor moral examples, and he attacks the mystery {{religions}} for their obscurantism and trivial rituals. In particular, the worshippers of Dionysus are ridiculed for their ritual use of children's toys. He suggests at some points that the pagan deities are based on humans, but at others that they are misanthropic demons, and he cites several classical sources in support of this second hypothesis. Clement, like many pre-Nicene fathers, writes favourably about Euhemerus and other rationalist philosophers, {{on the grounds that they}} at least saw <b>the</b> <b>flaws</b> in paganism. However, his greatest praise is reserved for Plato, whose apophatic views of God prefigure Christianity.|$|E
5|$|Further {{support for}} the {{association}} between autism and thiomersal appeared in an article by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. in the magazines Rolling Stone and Salon.com alleging a government conspiracy at a CDC meeting to conceal the dangers of thiomersal to protect the pharmaceutical industry, and a book written by David Kirby, Evidence of Harm, dramatizing the lives of parents of autistic children, with both authors participating in media interviews to promote their work and the controversy. Although the allegations by Kennedy were denied and a US Senate committee investigation later found no evidence to substantiate the most serious allegations, the story had already been well publicized by leveraging Kennedy's celebrity. Salon magazine subsequently amended Kennedy's article five times due to factual errors and later retracted it completely on January 16, 2011, stating that the works of critics of the article and evidence of <b>the</b> <b>flaws</b> in the science connecting autism and vaccines undermined {{the value of the}} article to the editors.|$|E

This situation demonstrated some of <b>the</b> <b>flaws</b> inherent in the championship system then being used.

40|$|A {{series of}} {{experimental}} studies {{are carried out}} to investigate the propagation of an open surface-flaw in gabbro samples under compression load. A new fracture pattern is observed where an anti-wing crack (its growth direction is opposite to that of wing crack) is induced at a distance away from <b>the</b> <b>flaw</b> tip in <b>the</b> region of compression stress zone. The wing crack appears at the later stage. Besides, the stress for crack initiation is strongly affected by the inclined angle α of <b>the</b> pre-existing <b>flaw.</b> <b>The</b> stress for crack initiation decreases when <b>the</b> <b>flaw</b> angle increases (30 °≤aα≤ 75 °). Besides, the outburst phenomenon always appears at <b>the</b> <b>flaw</b> tips when <b>the</b> <b>flaw</b> angle equals about 45 °, which {{may be an important}} parameter for the problem of the rock outburst. The initiation angle of the anti-wing crack is between 135 ° and 145 ° from <b>the</b> <b>flaw</b> plane. <b>The</b> growth of the anti-wing crack turns to the loading direction when the crack growth length equals about half of <b>the</b> <b>flaw</b> length. <b>The</b> results of acoustic emission (AE) support the observations from the experiments.

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{detection}} {{and location of}} a small flaw inside a conducting cylinder using an eddy current coil coaxial with the cylinder has been addressed. The electric field at an arbitrary axial and radial position inside the conductor has been obtained from a previous solution of the boundary value problem. An expres-sion for the change in complex impendance due to a small flaw located within a conducting body has been derived and is {{shown to be a}} func-tion of the electric field at the position of <b>the</b> <b>flaw.</b> For <b>the</b> case of a degenerate point flaw this expression is further simplified by using just the value of the electric field at the position of the centroid of <b>the</b> <b>flaw.</b> <b>The</b> overall impendance is shown to be a func-tion of the ratio of the radii of the loop and cylinder and of the conductivity of the material.

5|$|Work {{began in}} about 1735 and {{continued}} until Dashwood's death in 1781, when the older {{house had been}} transformed inside and out. The long building time partly explains <b>the</b> <b>flaws</b> and variations in design: when building commenced, Palladianism was the height of fashion, {{but by the time}} of its completion, Palladianism had been succeeded by Neoclassicism; thus, the house is a marriage of both styles. While the marriage is not completely unhappy, the Palladian features are marred by the lack of Palladio's proportions: the east portico is asymmetrical with the axis of the house, and trees were planted either side to draw the eye away from the flaw.|$|E
5|$|A {{short run}} of Gran Trak systems was {{produced}} in March 1974 and revealed other design problems, such as the steering controls; in their prototype system, Eigen used real a real car steering wheel and pedals, but the production run used different parts. Alcorn returned to Cyan that month and redesigned the game to fix <b>the</b> <b>flaws</b> and use more standard parts; the copying protection scheme was changed to use a custom-designed integrated circuit that was named {{the same as a}} standard Texas Instruments integrated circuit. Alcorn later stated in an interview that neither Warman nor Emmons understood the challenges in converting a prototype design to a product that could be manufactured. The game entered production soon after, and Atari announced it was shipping a full production run in May 1974. Although the design flaws were fixed, the communication problems during development led to one final problem with the game: Atari was unclear on the actual cost of producing the game. As a result, a single Gran Trak game ended up costing US$1,095 to manufacture, while Atari was selling them to distributors for only $995, losing $100 per sale. Atari soon corrected the problem, but ended the fiscal year with a large loss {{due in part to the}} financial failure of the game.|$|E
5|$|Noriega {{took control}} of most major {{newspapers}} by either buying a controlling stake in them, or by forcing them to shut down. The government also harassed, intimidated, or exiled individual journalists and editors. The newspaper La Prensa, which remained independent and was frequently critical of Noriega, had its staff intimidated and its offices damaged; eventually, it too was forced to close. In May 1984, Noriega allowed the first presidential elections in 16 years. Noriega and Díaz Herrera picked Nicolás Ardito Barletta Vallarino to be the PRD's candidate, {{with the intention of}} keeping him under close control. When the initial results showed Arias, who had the support of much of the opposition, {{on his way to a}} landslide victory, Noriega halted the count. After brazenly manipulating the results, the government announced that Barletta had won by a slim margin of 1,713 votes. Independent estimates suggested that Arias would have won by as many as 50,000 votes had the election been conducted fairly. More than 60,000 votes were not included in the final count. The U.S. government was aware of this manipulation, but chose not to comment on it. Noriega's rule became increasingly repressive, even as the U.S. government of Ronald Reagan began relying on him in its covert efforts to undermine Nicaragua's Sandinista government. The U.S. accepted Barletta's election, and signaled a willingness to cooperate with him, despite recognizing <b>the</b> <b>flaws</b> in the election process.|$|E

5|$|The great {{accomplishment}} of the Hortensian Law {{was in that}} it deprived the Patricians of their final weapon over the Plebeians. Therefore, the new Patricio-Plebeian aristocracy replaced the old Patrician aristocracy, and the last great political question of the earlier era had been resolved. As such, no important political changes occurred between 287 BC and 133 BC. This entire era was dominated by foreign wars, which eliminated the need to address <b>the</b> <b>flaws</b> in the current political system, since the patriotism of the Plebeians suppressed their desire for further reforms. However, this era created new problems, which began to be realized {{near the end of}} the 2nd century BC. For example, the nature of Rome's military commanders changed. Roman soldiers of earlier eras fought short wars, and then returned to their farms. Since their generals did the same thing, the soldiers came to view their generals as being nothing more than fellow citizen-soldiers. Now, however, wars were becoming longer and of a larger scale. Thus, this period saw a growing affinity between the average citizen and his general, while the generals acquired more power than they had ever held before.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A new {{ultrasonic}} {{method for}} evaluating axial flaw depth in pipes is proposed with circumferential shear vertical, SV, wave. When a conventional {{ultrasonic flaw detection}} technique with pipe transducers is applied to sizing of inner axial <b>flaws</b> in pipes, <b>the</b> wave amplitude reflected at <b>the</b> axial <b>flaw</b> or that transmitted through <b>the</b> <b>flaw</b> is not proportional to <b>the</b> <b>flaw</b> depth. Moreover, <b>the</b> received amplitude of <b>the</b> <b>flaw</b> depends on circumferential position. The {{reason is that the}} shear wave beams in the pipe are not parallel, e. g., the refraction angle into steel pipes varies with the circumference position. To improve this, a special shear wave transducer of equi-refraction angle was designed. With this transducer, the wave energy distribution along the wall thickness is nearly uniform, therefore, the transmitted wave amplitude through <b>the</b> <b>flaw</b> is expected to be proportional to <b>the</b> <b>flaw</b> depth. To confirm this, we measured the wave amplitude transmitted through an axial slot in a pipe of thickness of 3 mm and diameter of 60 mm. The depths of the axial slot are 33, 50 and 67 % of the thickness. The amplitude transmitted through the slots is found to be nearly proportional to the slot depth...|$|R

In many instances <b>the</b> NDE <b>flaw</b> detectability is given as a flaw size such as crack length. <b>The</b> <b>flaw</b> is either a crack or behaving like a crack in terms of affecting the structural integrity of the material.
