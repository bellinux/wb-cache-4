The only females granted access were Bartholdi's wife and de Lesseps's granddaughter; officials stated that they feared women might be injured in <b>the</b> <b>crush</b> <b>of</b> people. The restriction offended area suffragists, who chartered a boat and got as close as they could to the island. The group's leaders made speeches applauding the embodiment of Liberty as a woman and advocating women's right to vote. A scheduled fireworks display was postponed until November 1 because of poor weather.|$|E

Two constables were required to keep the crowd away from the church doors and pickpockets took advantage of <b>the</b> <b>crush</b> <b>of</b> people to steal from the crowd.|$|E

25|$|At Astoria a {{peaceful}} celebration of Fidesz started. Despite their readiness (during the previous few days, hundreds of policemen {{were called in}} from {{the country to the}} city), police did little to defend <b>the</b> <b>crush</b> <b>of</b> radical anti-government protests that took place only 300–500 metres away and pressed nearer and nearer by police's gas attacks in the wide Erzsébet Boulevard. That night and the next day many political analysts and congressmen brought up the idea that this police behaviour was not by chance. Fidesz celebration, with a participation of thousands, ended at 18:00. That crowd could not be disbanded at all when police started a horse assault on Deák Square protesters. They used gun shells too.|$|E
25|$|Around 9:10p.m., power {{failed in}} the building, {{extinguishing}} the lights. Panic ensued, and even {{those who had been}} calmly moving toward exits in the Cabaret Room began to push and shove each other. The situation was made worse by the fact that of the three exits in the room, two were quickly blocked off by the fire, leaving the crowd to funnel through a single exit. Employees outside the exits attempted to pull guests to safety, but <b>the</b> <b>crush</b> <b>of</b> bodies as those behind pushed upon those in front became so solid that no amount of strength could free most of them. Many of those who escaped the crush blocking the northeast fire exit became lost trying to find other exits. Twists and turns in building design which led to a set of doors opening into a bar area funneled some into a dead end.|$|E

He required {{the assistance of the}} police to extricate himself from <b>the</b> <b>crush</b> <b>of</b> well-wishers at the course, while at Westminster, Ladas's win was cheered in the House of Commons. By contrast, Rosebery was strongly criticised by some churchmen for involving himself in the [...] "dishonesty and degradation" [...] of the racing world. Rosebery, who responded to criticism by saying that he had [...] "no vestige of shame" [...] in owning a good horse, used the Derby win to his advantage; he presented one of Ladas's winning horseshoes as [...] a gift to the United States ambassador Thomas F.

After several minutes, medical attendants arrived and lifted Kennedy onto a stretcher, prompting him to whisper, [...] "Don't lift me..." [...] which were to become his last words. He lost consciousness shortly thereafter. Kennedy was taken a mile away to Central Receiving Hospital, where he arrived near death. One doctor slapped his face, calling, [...] "Bob, Bob", while another doctor manually massaged Kennedy's heart. After obtaining a good heartbeat, doctors handed a stethoscope to Ethel so she could hear her husband's heart beating, much to her relief.|$|E

However American writer Eugene Bagger says that, at Bayonne, he saw Sousa Mendes rushing out of the Portuguese Consulate, pursued by a mob, and that Sousa Mendes holding his head between his hands was crying “Go away!

2500|$|Chapter 8 {{contains}} {{references to}} and quotes {{from many of}} the works Blake was exposed to and influenced by at a young age. These references include allusions to Saint Jerome, John Taylor's Urania, or his Heavenly Muse (1630), Abraham Cowley's translation of Anacreon's lyric poem [...] "The Grasshopper" [...] (1656), Henry Wotton's Reliquae Wottonianae (1685), John Locke's An Essay Concerning Human Understanding (1690), Joseph Addison's Cato, a Tragedy (1712), Edward Young's Night-Thoughts (1742) and James Hervey's Meditations and Contemplations (1746) and Theron and Aspasio (1755). The Jerome reference is found in Steelyard's comment [...] "Says Jerome happiness is not for us poor crawling reptiles of the earth Talk of happiness & happiness its no such thing – every person has a something." [...] The Taylor reference is Steelyard’s poem; [...] "Hear then the pride & knowledge of a Sailor/His sprit sail fore sail main sail & his mizen/A poor frail man god wot I know none frailer/I know no greater sinner than John Taylor." [...] Although Alicia Ostriker feels this is a reference to the preacher John Taylor, David Erdman argues that the lines closely parallel the opening of the poem Urania , and as such, the reference is more likely to the poet than the preacher. The Cowley reference is found in the poem [...] "Phebe drest like beauties Queen", which contains the lines [...] "Happy people who can be/In happiness compard with ye." [...] Erdman believes this to be derived from the lines in Cowley's translation of Anacreon, [...] "Happy Insect! What can be/In Happiness compar'd to thee?" [...] The Wotton reference is found in Steelyard's [...] "My crop of corn is but a field of tares;" [...] John Sampson believes this to be reference to the Chidiock Tichborne poem [...] "Elegy" [...] (1586), which Blake could have been familiar with from Wotton's Reliquae. Locke is mentioned when Scopprell picks up one of Steelyard's books and reads the cover, [...] "An Easy of Huming Understanding by John Lookye Gent." [...] Addison is referred to indirectly when Steelyard attributes the quote [...] "the wreck of matter & <b>the</b> <b>crush</b> <b>of</b> worlds" [...] to Edward Young, when it is actually from Addison's Cato. Both the reference to Young and Hervey's Meditations are found in the opening sentence of the chapter; [...] "Steelyard the Lawgiver, sitting at his table taking extracts from Herveys Meditations among the tombs & Youngs Night thoughts." [...] The Theron reference is found when Steelyard announces to Obtuse Angle that he is reading the book.|$|E
