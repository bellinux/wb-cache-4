25|$|On March 20, 1985, an Okanagan Helicopters S-61N (C-GOKZ) ditched in the Atlantic Ocean off of Owl's Head, Nova Scotia. The {{aircraft}} {{was en route}} from the MODU Sedco 709 offshore Nova Scotia to the Halifax International Airport(YHZ)when the main gearbox suffered a total loss of <b>transmission</b> <b>fluid.</b> There were 15 passengers and two crew on board. There were no injuries during the ditching, however several passengers suffered varying degrees of hypothermia. As {{a result of this}} incident, improved thermal protection and other advancements in helicopter transportation suits were instituted for offshore workers on Canada's east coast.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the start}} of 2008, another world-first [...] seven-speed DSG {{transaxle}} (Volkswagen Group internal code: DQ200, parts code prefix: 0AM) became available. [...] It differs from the six-speed DSG, in that it uses two single-plate dry clutches (of similar diameter). This clutch pack was designed by LuK Clutch Systems, Gmbh. This seven-speed DSG is used in smaller front-wheel-drive cars with smaller-displacement engines with lower torque outputs, such as the latest Volkswagen Golf, Volkswagen Polo Mk5, and the new SEAT Ibiza. It has been paired to engines with up to [...] It has considerably less oil capacity than the six-speed DQ250; this new DQ200 uses just [...] of <b>transmission</b> <b>fluid.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Dual-clutch {{transmissions}} use two {{fundamentally different}} types of clutches: either two wet multiplate clutches, bathed in oil (for cooling), or two dry single-plate clutches.

2500|$|The G20 {{featured}} {{either a}} 5-speed manual transmission or an optional 4-speed automatic. [...] Most {{front wheel drive}} transmissions from other SR-powered cars {{can be used with}} few modifications. The stock transmission as well as other SR20 transmissions are often upgraded with various modifications in order to handle more power. Common manual transmission modifications include cryo treating, shot peening, transmission case welding, aftermarket limited slip differential, aftermarket axles, and upgraded clutches. Common automatic transmission modifications include built valve bodies, aftermarket torque converters, automatic <b>transmission</b> <b>fluid</b> (ATF) coolers, additional ATF filters, and aftermarket TCUs. Higher rated transmission swaps from front-wheel drive VQ or QR25DE powered cars such as the 2002–2006 Nissan Sentra SE-R Spec-V have also been performed.|$|E
2500|$|Powertrain {{design was}} reassessed for {{front-wheel-drive}} and this generated {{a foundation for}} which other models were developed. The transaxle is connected inline with the engine, {{and to create a}} simple and compact structure, a single rail system that replaces the three shafts normally used for each gear range with a single shaft, was adopted. In addition, automatic <b>transmission</b> <b>fluid</b> was used for the lubricating oil in order to reduce friction. Existing gasoline S- and diesel C-series engines were converted for use in transverse applications. Initially, the V10 featured the 1.8-liter 1S-LU engine good for [...] and a five-speed manual transmission. From July 1982, four-speed automatic with overdrive became available after starting manufacture the previous month. The 2.0-liter 2S-ELU engine with [...] and four-speed automatic followed in August. August 1983 saw the 1.8-liter 1C-TL turbocharged diesel offered (...) exclusive to Japanese dealerships called Toyota Diesel Store. June 1984 introduced the twin-cam 2.0-liter 3S-GELU engine offered on higher trims with [...] depending on the version. For lower trims, the [...] "Ci" [...] 1.8-liter 1S-iLU arrived.

2500|$|In late 2008, an all-new seven-speed {{longitudinal}} S tronic {{version of}} the DSG transaxle went into series production (Volkswagen Group internal code: DL501, parts code prefix: 0B5). Initially, from early 2009, it is only used in certain Audi cars, and only with longitudinally mounted engines. Like the original six-speed DSG, it features a concentric dual wet multi-plate clutch. However, this particular variant uses notably more plates — the larger outer clutch (for the odd-numbered gears) uses 10 plates, whereas the smaller inner clutch (driving even-numbered gears and reverse) uses 12 plates. Another notable change over the original transverse DSGs is the lubrication system [...] — Audi now utilise two totally separate oil circuits. One oil circuit, consisting of , lubricates the hydraulic clutches and mechatronics with fully synthetic specialist automatic <b>transmission</b> <b>fluid</b> (ATF), whilst the other oil circuit lubricates the gear trains and front and centre differentials with [...] of conventional hypoid gear oil.

2500|$|DCFEMS {{also asked}} the D.C. police to {{investigate}} whether arson {{was the cause of}} the ambulance fires. Deputy Mayor Paul Quander called two ambulance fires on the same day suspicious and asked the police to investigate to ensure that [...] "nothing untoward is happening". Quander declined to elaborate on what he meant, and the firefighters' union denounced his statement as a slur on workers. But on August 16, a preliminary investigation determined that both fires were likely accidental. Investigators discovered that DCFEMS maintenance crews (with management approval) were attempting to fix overheating vehicle air conditioners by cutting up aluminum signs and using them as heat shields. DCFEMS superiors ordered the [...] "heat shields" [...] removed after the revelation. Police arson investigators then learned that Medic 27 (which caught fire at the apartment building) had ongoing maintenance issues and that its air conditioner repeatedly failed. The investigation determined that the fire started near the air conditioner (although it did not determine exactly which piece of equipment failed and caused the fire), and concluded the fire was accidental. Medic 27, a 2006 vehicle in the reserve fleet, suffered $25,000 in damage. The second [...] "fire" [...] was not a fire but merely smoke issuing from under the hood of the ambulance. D.C police arson investigators found a small plastic container of <b>transmission</b> <b>fluid</b> stored in the engine compartment, which began smoking after being heated by the constantly-running engine. Because no actual fire occurred, the report did not conclude whether the container was placed there accidentally.|$|E
