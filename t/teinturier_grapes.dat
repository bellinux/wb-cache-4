25|$|The Gamay grape, more {{accurately}} known as Gamay noir à Jus blanc to {{distinguish it from}} the Gamay <b>teinturier</b> <b>grapes</b> with red juice and different from the Napa Gamay and the Gamay Beaujolais grapes of California, is the most widely planted grape in Beaujolais, accounting for nearly 98% of all plantings. The remaining plantings are mostly Chardonnay. Aligote vines that were planted prior to 2004 are permitted in wine production, but the entire grape variety is being phased out of the region by 2024. According to AOC regulation, up to 15% of white wine grape varieties can be included in all Beaujolais red wines from the basic Beaujolais AOC to the Cru Beaujolais wines, but in practice the wines are almost always 100% Gamay. Pinot noir, which has very small plantings, is also permitted, but that grape is being phased out by 2015 as Beaujolais winemakers continue to focus their winemaking identity on the Gamay grape. The characteristics that the Gamay grapes adds to Beaujolais are a deep bluish-red color, low acidity, moderate tannins, and light to medium body. The aroma associated with the grape itself is typically red berries.|$|E
50|$|Cascade, one of L'Acadie blanc's parent varieties, has a {{long and}} complex {{pedigree}} itself with Concord, Chasselas Musqué, the Vitis vinifera <b>teinturier</b> <b>grapes</b> Alicante Bouschet and Alicante Ganzin {{as well as the}} Munson grape in its lineage.|$|E
50|$|Since high-yielding Aramon {{gives one}} of the least {{coloured}} wines that still pass as red, the practice of blending such wines with wines from <b>teinturier</b> <b>grapes</b> such as Alicante Bouschet was a measure used to give them a measure of increased credibility as reds.|$|E
50|$|The French {{wine grape}} variety Morrastel Bouschet is a {{crossing}} of Graciano and the red-fleshed <b>teinturier</b> <b>grape</b> Bouschet Petit.|$|R
50|$|It is {{produced}} by concentrating the <b>teinturier</b> <b>grape</b> Rubired, a cross between Alicante Ganzin and Tinta Cão, has 68% sugar and sells for approximately $135 a gallon.|$|R
50|$|Royalty is a {{crossing}} of the Vitis vinifera Trousseau gris variety from the Jura wine region of France and the <b>teinturier</b> <b>grape</b> Alicante Ganzin that, itself, is a hybrid of a Vitis rupestris variety and the Vitis vinifera grape Aramon. The variety was first developed in 1938 but wasn't released for commercial use until 1958 when it was released with Rubired.|$|R
50|$|Alicante Ganzin {{is a red}} French {{wine grape}} variety. Unlike most Vitis vinifera wine grapes, Alicante Ganzin is a teinturier with dark flesh that {{produces}} red juice. Most varieties used to produce red wine, such as Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, etc., have clear color flesh and juice with the wine receiving its color through a maceration process where the color seeps out of the grape skins {{for as long as}} they are in contact with the juice. Alicante Ganzin can thus produce light red and rose colored wine without maceration. It is believed that Alicante Ganzin is often described as the progenitor of all French <b>teinturier</b> <b>grapes.</b>|$|E
50|$|Alicante Bouschet or Alicante Henri Bouschet is a {{wine grape}} variety that has been widely {{cultivated}} since 1866. It is a cross of Petit Bouschet (itself a cross of the very old variety Teinturier du Cher and Aramon) and Grenache. Alicante is a teinturier, a grape with red flesh. It {{is one of the}} few <b>teinturier</b> <b>grapes</b> that belong to the Vitis vinifera species. Its deep color makes it useful for blending with light red wine. It was planted heavily during Prohibition in California for export to the East Coast. Its thick skin made it resistant to rot during the transportation process. The intense red color was also helpful for stretching the wine during prohibition, as it could be diluted without detracting from the appearance. At the turn of the 21st century, Alicante Bouschet was the 12th most planted red wine grape in France with sizable plantings in the Languedoc, Provence and Cognac regions. In 1958, Alicante Bouschet covered 24,168 hectares (mainly across southern France); by 2011, plantings represented less than 4,000 hectares. This scenario is largely reversed in other regions of Europe, and in southern Portugal in particular.|$|E
50|$|The Gamay grape, more {{accurately}} known as Gamay noir à Jus blanc to {{distinguish it from}} the Gamay <b>teinturier</b> <b>grapes</b> with red juice and different from the Napa Gamay and the Gamay Beaujolais grapes of California, is the most widely planted grape in Beaujolais, accounting for nearly 98% of all plantings.

50|$|Saperavi is a hardy variety, {{known for}} its ability to handle {{extremely}} cold weather and is popular for growing in high altitude and inland regions such as Kakheti. It is a <b>teinturier</b> <b>grape,</b> containing the red anthrocyanin within the grape pulp as well as the skin and is unusual in being one of very few such grapes used in single-varietal winemaking.|$|R

The vast majority of red wine grapes are like the Grenache on the right with the red color of wine coming from skin contact during winemaking.|$|R
25|$|Grapes {{that are}} also {{unrelated}} to Carignan but share synonyms include Carignan Boushet (a Petit Bouschet and Morrastel cross), Bobal (a Spanish wine grape that {{is also known as}} Carignan d'Espagne), Aubun (a French wine grape that is also known as Carignan de Bedoin, Carignan de Bedouin, and Carignan de Gigondas), Alicante Bouschet (French <b>teinturier</b> <b>grape</b> that is also known as Carignan jaune), and Grenache (which is also known as Carignan rouge, Carignane rosso, and Carignane rousee).|$|R
50|$|Seibel 7042 is a {{crossing}} of Seibel 5351 and Seibel 6268. Gloire de Seibel is a cross of Seibel 867 and Seibel 452. From these parent and grandparent varieties Cascade is descended from Concord, Chasselas Musqué and the Vitis vinifera <b>teinturier</b> <b>grape</b> Alicante Bouschet (great-grandparents to Seibel 5351). Cascade also has extended relations with another vinifera teinturier Alicante Ganzin (grandparent to Seibel 452) and the Munson grape (great-grandparent to Seibel 452). The phylloxera-resistance rootstock variety Rupestris du Lot is {{also related to}} Cascade as a grandparent variety to Seibel 452.|$|R
5000|$|While most {{wine grape}} varieties, even those such as Cabernet Sauvignon and Grenache {{used to make}} red wine, have [...] "white flesh" [...] that yield white or greyish colored juice, Grand Noir de la Calmette is a <b>teinturier</b> <b>grape</b> that has red color flesh that yields red colored juice without needing any skin contact to leach color into the wine. However, the juice of Grand Noir de la Calmette is very pale (especially {{compared}} to other Bouschet varieties such as Alicante Bouschet) so the wine often does see some maceration time.|$|R
50|$|The {{color of}} the wine mainly depends on the {{color of the}} drupe of the grape variety. Since {{pigments}} are localized {{in the center of the}} grape drupe, not in the juice, {{the color of the}} wine depends on the method of vinification and the time the must is in contact with those skins, a process called maceration. The <b>Teinturier</b> <b>grape</b> is an exception in that it also has a pigmented pulp. The blending of two or more varieties of grapes can explain the color of certain wines, like the addition of Rubired to intensify redness.|$|R
50|$|Royalty (also {{known as}} Royalty 1390) {{is a red}} Californian wine grape variety that was {{developed}} in 1938 by Dr. Harold P. Olmo of the University of California, Davis. The grape is a red fleshed teinturier which, unlike most red wine grapes, will produced red-tinged colored wine even without maceration time on the skins. The grape is a hybrid being produced from the Vitis vinifera Trousseau gris variety from the Jura wine region of France and the <b>teinturier</b> <b>grape</b> Alicante Ganzin that, itself, is a hybrid of a Vitis rupestris variety and the Vitis vinifera grape Aramon.|$|R
5000|$|Grand Noir de la Calmette (or simply Grand noir) {{is a red}} <b>teinturier</b> <b>grape</b> {{variety that}} is a {{crossing}} of Petit Bouschet and Aramon noir created in 1855 by French grape breeder Henri Bouschet at his vineyard in Mauguio in the Hérault department. The grape was named after the breeding station Domaine de la Calmette. As a teinturier, Grand noir {{is often used to}} add color to wines that it is blended into but is paler than other choices such as Alicante Bouschet. The vine tends to bud late and has a high productivity but with some susceptibility to the viticultural hazard of powdery mildew.|$|R
50|$|The grape {{produces}} a deep-colored and aromatic wine. It {{can be made}} into a dry style or one with a moderate residual sugar level. Chambourcin is a <b>teinturier,</b> a <b>grape</b> whose juice is pink or red rather than clear like most red vitis vinifera cultivars.|$|R
50|$|Petit Bouschet {{is a red}} <b>teinturier</b> <b>grape</b> {{variety that}} is a {{crossing}} of Aramon noir and Teinturier du Cher created in 1824 by French grape breeder Louis Bouschet at his vineyard in Mauguio in the Hérault department. The grape was used by Louis' son, Henri Bouschet, to create several more varieties including Alicante Bouschet, Grand Noir de la Calmette and Morrastel Bouschet. Petit Bouschet saw a surge of plantings in the late 19th century as France recovered from the phylloxera epidemic where it was often used to add color to blends made from hybrid grapes and other high yielding varieties. As its offspring Alicante Bouschet became more popular, plantings of Petit Bouschet fell off and the grape is now hardly found in France.|$|R
2500|$|Over centuries, the Grenache vine has {{produced}} color mutation vines with berries of all range of colors. While Grenache noir or [...] "red" [...] Grenache {{is the most}} well known, Grenache blanc or [...] "white" [...] Grenache {{is a very important}} grape variety in France where it is the fourth most widely planted white variety after Ugni blanc, Chardonnay and Semillon. Like Grenache noir, it is a permitted variety in the blends of Châteauneuf-du-Pape. In Southern France and Sardinia, the mutants Grenache Rose and Grenache gris are also found making pale rosé and lightly tinted white wines. [...] "Hairy Grenache" [...] (Garnacha Peluda as known in Spain) is a Grenache variant evolved to grow fuzz on the underside of its leaves to protect the vine from transpiration in hot climates, [...] "like the corresponding fuzz on rosemary or other mediterranean plants." [...] Compared to its more widely planted cousin, it produces wines lower in alcohol and higher in acidity that show spicy and savory notes more readily as they age. [...] It was not widely replanted after phylloxera as it was not well-adapted to making the vins doux naturels (see Fortified wine) that were [...] "all the rage" [...] at the time. [...] The vine known as Garnacha Tintorera is a synonym for the <b>teinturier</b> <b>grape</b> Alicante which is a crossing of Grenache and Petite Bouschet. In 1961, a cross between Grenache and Cabernet Sauvignon produced the French wine grape Marselan.|$|R
