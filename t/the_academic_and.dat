For others, it is a bad thing: they argue that at least <b>the</b> <b>academics</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> elites had some rational, thought-through and coherent ideas about socialism.|$|R

5|$|Until {{the late}} 1950s, {{when the federal}} {{government}} shifted to a day school integration model, residential schools were severely underfunded and often relied on the forced labour of their students to maintain their facilities, although it was presented as training for artisan skills. The work was arduous, and severely compromised <b>the</b> <b>academic</b> <b>and</b> social development of the students. School books and textbooks were drawn mainly from the curricula of the provincially funded public schools for non-Indigenous students, and teachers at the residential schools were often poorly trained or prepared. During this same period, Canadian government scientists performed nutritional tests on students and knowingly kept some students undernourished to serve as the control sample.|$|E
