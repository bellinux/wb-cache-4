5|$|The {{underwater}} volcano Hunga Tonga in Tonga breached {{sea level}} in 2009. Both of its vents exhibited Surtseyan activity {{for much of}} <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> also {{the site of an}} earlier eruption in May 1988.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on August11. Associated deep convection quickly decreased after tracking westward through the tropical Atlantic Ocean, although by August13 a broad low pressure area and closed circulation developed along the wave. Environmental conditions favored tropical development, and the system gradually became better organized, although convection was initially limited near the center. On August 14, convection increased northwest of the center and became sufficiently well-organized for the system to be considered a tropical depression; at <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> located about 1500miles (2400km) east of the southern Windward Islands.|$|E

5|$|A.× cunninghamii (Albany Woollybush), {{a hybrid}} between A.cuneatus and A.sericeus, was first {{collected}} in 1827, and published as A.cunninghamii in 1845. Other than some dubious collections in the 1830s and 1840s, no further sightings {{are known to}} have been made until 1973, when Nelson rediscovered it. At <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> regarded as a distinct species, but by 1995 it was thought to be a hybrid, and this was confirmed by genetic analysis in 2002. In appearance it is very similar to A.sericeus, but its leaf segments are flat rather than cylindrical.|$|E
5|$|After {{rest and}} recovery, the {{regiment}} {{moved to the}} Fromelles sector of the front in mid-October. Here Kippenberger volunteered for sniper duty despite not being known for his accuracy as a marksman. He served in this capacity until he was badly wounded in the arm by shrapnel on 10 November 1916. Although he eventually recovered from his wound, at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> serious enough that he was repatriated to New Zealand and discharged from the NZEF in April 1917.|$|E
5|$|Along the way, {{the story}} was greatly {{modified}} {{to make it more}} suitable as a family film. By <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> completed in 1981, the film had changed into a chronicle of the unlikely friendship of two creatures, who should be natural enemies and who learn society sometimes tries to determine their roles despite their better impulses. In the original screenplay, Chief was slated to die the same as in the novel, but Stevens did not want to have an on-screen death and modified the film so that he survived.|$|E

5|$|Another {{location}} in the city used for large productions is the Hamasa Shrine Temple Theater. The Temple Theater houses a 778-pipe Robert Morgan organ, one of two Theater Organs still in their original installations in the state. With seating for 1800 persons, the silent movie era was a prosperous time for the Temple. At <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{one of the largest}} stages in the United States, second only to the Roxy Theater in New York City. Today, seating 1576 persons, the Temple is used year-round for area events, live stage shows, plays, concerts, Hamasa Shrine functions, and public screenings of classic movies.|$|E
5|$|As the DVD {{featurette}} Within a Minute illustrates, {{the film}} required 910 artists and 70,441 man-hours to create 49 seconds of footage for the Mustafar duel alone. Members of Hyperspace, the Official Star Wars Fan Club, received a special {{look into the}} production. Benefits included not only special articles, but they also received access to a webcam that transmitted a new image every 20 seconds during <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> operating in Fox Studios Australia. Many times the stars, and Lucas himself, were spotted on the webcam.|$|E
5|$|At its opening, Chang {{claimed the}} record for the tallest {{vertical}} loop of any roller coaster in the world. At <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the world's tallest, fastest and longest stand-up coaster. It also claimed records for the largest drop and the most inversions on a stand-up roller coaster. All of these records had eclipsed those set by Mantis, which opened at Cedar Point in 1996. In 1998 Riddler's Revenge opened at Six Flags Magic Mountain, and Chang surrendered its titles.|$|E

5|$|At <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{known that}} the drag at {{supersonic}} speeds was strongly related to the span of the wing. This led {{to the use of}} very short-span, very thin rectangular wings such as those seen on the control surfaces of many missiles, or in aircraft like the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter or the Avro 730 that the team studied. The team outlined a baseline configuration that looked like an enlarged Avro 730.|$|E
5|$|At <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{not known}} which {{submarine}} had sunk Irish Oak. The survivors knew {{only that it}} was not U-650. In the House of Commons Sir William Davidson called for a formal protest, because Irish Oak had not warned the convoy, and Douglas Lloyd Savory called for an end of coal exports to Ireland.|$|E
5|$|At <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{purchased}} by {{the wife of the}} Togolese Minister in 2011, there had been preparations to salvage the plane for its aluminium.

5|$|At <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{thought that}} Alpha was the twenty-second storm of the season, {{and so was}} the storm which broke the 1933 season's record for most storms in a single season. However post-season {{analysis}} revealed that there was also a previously unnoticed subtropical storm on October4, which made Alpha the twenty-third storm of the season. Alpha was the first tropical storm to be assigned a Greek-alphabet name after the list of hurricane names was exhausted.|$|E
5|$|At <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{uncertain}} which submarine {{had launched}} the torpedoes. Its periscope remained visible as lifeboats were lowered.

The survivors were located by Irish Plane at 4:20 pm.|$|E
5|$|At <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> by far {{the largest}} battle ever fought in North America. If the Royal Navy is included, over 40,000 men took part in the battle. Howe {{reported}} his losses as 59 killed, 268 wounded and 31 missing. The Hessian casualties were 5 killed and 26 wounded. The Americans suffered much heavier losses. About 300 had been killed and over 1,000 captured. As few as half of the prisoners survived. Kept on prison ships, then transferred to locations such as the Middle Dutch Church, they were starved and denied medical attention. In their weakened condition, many succumbed to smallpox.|$|E

5|$|Casablanca was {{initially}} released on Betamax and VHS by Magnetic Video {{and later by}} CBS/Fox Video (as United Artists owned the rights at <b>the</b> <b>time).</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> next released on laserdisc in 1991, and on VHS in 1992—both from MGM/UA Home Entertainment (distributing for Turner Entertainment Co.), {{which at the time}} was distributed by Warner Home Video. It was first released on DVD in 1997 by MGM, containing the trailer and a making-of featurette (Warner Home Video reissued the DVD in 2000). A subsequent two-disc special edition, containing audio commentaries, documentaries, and a newly remastered visual and audio presentation, was released in 2003.|$|E

30|$|The {{most recent}} theory (Jones 2015) treats the home {{advantage}} as an away disadvantage, namely, that the away players (in {{agreement with the}} first two theories) see the hometown crowd as hostile and the officials as accommodating. What makes this perception a disadvantage <b>is</b> that <b>it</b> puts the away players on the defensive. The hometown crowd is not necessarily hostile. Much of <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> just rooting, but it never roots for the away team and some of <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> hostile. To <b>the</b> away players the crowd’s attitude constitutes a threat, namely, that the home team will win and the crowd will rejoice.|$|R
