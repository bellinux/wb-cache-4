50|$|An early {{method of}} {{disabling}} shaped charges developed during World War II was to apply <b>thin</b> <b>skirt</b> armor or meshwire {{at a distance}} around the hull and turret of the tank. The skirt or mesh armor (cage armor) triggers the RPG on contact {{and much of the}} molten jet that a shaped charge produces dissipates before coming into contact with the main armor of the vehicle. Well-sloped armor also gives some protection because the shaped charge is forced to penetrate a greater amount of armor due to the oblique angle. The benefits of cage armor are still considered great in modern battlefields in the Middle East, and although similar effects can be obtained using spaced armor, either {{as a part of the}} original design or as appliqué armor fitted later, cage armor is preferable due to its low weight and ease of repair.|$|E
40|$|Avaliaram-se as características de carcaça de búfalos Murrah castrados terminados em confinamento. Foram utilizados 20 bubalinos Murrah (15 meses de idade e peso inicial de 207 kg), castrados e descornados, divididos em quatro grupos homogêneos e abatidos aos 75, 100, 125, 150 dias de confinamento, após período de adaptação. Ao abate, as carcaças foram identificadas, resfriadas por 24 horas para pesagem e cálculo dos rendimentos das meias-carcaças, dos cortes dianteiro, ponta-de-agulha, traseiro total e serrote. Não houve diferença estatística para o rendimento de carcaça. Os pesos de traseiro total, serrote e dianteiro apresentaram aumento linear, porém, observou-se efeito cúbico do período de confinamento sobre os rendimentos de traseiro total e dianteiro. Verificou-se ainda aumento linear dos pesos de filé-mignon, contrafilé, fraldinha, coxão mole, coxão duro, lagarto, sebo, porção comestível e ossos. O período de confinamento promoveu efeito linear decrescente sobre os rendimentos de patinho, músculo traseiro e maminha + alcatra e linear crescente para fraldinha e sebo. The {{objective}} of this trial was to evaluate the carcass traits of feedlot castrated Murrah buffaloes. Twenty castrated hornless Murrah buffaloes averaging 15 months of age and initial body weight of 207 kg were used. Animals were divided in four groups and slaughtered at 75, 100, 125 or 150 days of feedlot after an adaptation period. At slaughter, carcasses were identified, cooled for 24 hours, and weighed for calculation of yields of half carcass, hindquarter, spare ribs, forequarter, and sawcut. There {{was no significant difference}} for carcass yield comparing the different periods of feedlot. Weights of sawcut, forequarter, hindquarter, tenderloin, strip loin, <b>thin</b> <b>skirt,</b> topside, outside flat, eye round, tallow, retail beef cuts, and bones all increased linearly while significant cubic effects were observed for yields of forequarter and hindquarter by increasing the days in feedlot. However, yields of knuckle, shank, and beef loin + tri-tip decreased linearly while those of <b>thin</b> <b>skirt</b> and tallow increased linearly when the feedlot period went from 75 to 150 days...|$|E

40|$|The {{fascinating}} behaviour {{of bubbles}} and drops rising or falling under gravity, {{even without the}} presence of any impurities or other forces (such as electric, magnetic and marangoni forces), is still a subject of active research. Let alone a uni fied description {{of the dynamics of}} bubbles and drops, a full description of a single bubble/drop is out of our reach, as of now. The <b>thin</b> <b>skirted</b> bubbles, for instance, may rise axisymmetrically or may have travelling waves in azimuthal or vertical direction; may or may not remain axisymmetric; may eject satellite bubbles, or they may form wrinkles in their skirt. The length scales may vary across 3 or more orders of magnitude. A rising bubble may change its topology to become a toroidal bubble and become unstable to break into smaller bubbles, which may further break into even smaller bubbles. Bubbles which attain a terminal shape and velocity may change their fi nal behaviour depending on the initial conditions of release. Ellipsoidal bubbles, released axisymmetrically, may often take a zigzag or a spiral path as they rise. On the other hand, drops have a completely di ff erent dynamics. Drops have been studied due to their importance in atomization, rain drop size distribution, emulsi fi cation and many other problems of industrial importance. Apart from the low Reynolds number regime and density ratios close to 1, any literature seldom compares bubbles and drops because of the inherent difference in their dynamics. The reason for this difference has been investigated i...|$|R

40|$|We investigate, {{using the}} {{modeling}} code SHAPE, the three-dimensional {{structure of the}} bipolar Homunculus nebula surrounding Eta Carinae as mapped by new ESO VLT/X-Shooter observations of the H 2 (lambda) = 2. 12125 micrometers emission line. Our results reveal {{for the first time}} important deviations from the axisymmetric bipolar morphology: 1) circumpolar trenches in each lobe positioned point-symmetrically from the center and 2) offplanar protrusions in the equatorial region from each lobe at longitudinal (approximately 55 degrees) and latitudinal (10 degrees to 20 degrees) distances from the projected apastron direction of the binary orbit. The angular distance between the protrusions (approximately 110 degrees) is similar to the angular extent of each polar trench (approximately 130 degrees) and nearly equal to the opening angle of the wind-wind collision cavity (approximately 110 degrees).

60|$|Nothing {{which he}} had heard or {{imagined}} of Madame Christophor had prepared Julien for the subdued yet manifest magnificence of her dwelling.

40|$|For {{hypereutectic}} Al/Si alloys, one of {{the advantages}} of thixoforming in comparison with casting routes is the relatively short processing times at high temperatures and hence limited coarsening of the Si phase. Coarse silicon particles give poor mechanical properties. Here two hypereutectic Al/Si alloys (magneto-hydro-dynamically (MHD) stirred A 390 from Pechiney and an extruded A 390 alloy from Showa in Japan) have been thixoformed to form pistons. Opening up the die entrance to the full width of the crown made the flow into the die more uniform and helped to reduce the tendency for large pores to form due to swirling of the slurry. Die heating reduced cold shuts in the <b>skirt</b> (<b>thin</b> section) of the piston. Placing inserts into the die to make holes for the piston pins (i. e. having an obstacle in the thicker regions) evened up the flow between the thick and the thin regions in the die. Massive pores experienced in earlier shots were then eliminated. Placing ceramic material in the die entrance considerably reduced the shrinkage porosity in the crown. The use of the Showa alloy, where the globular semisolid microstructure is achieved by a solid state deformation route rather than MHD, gave reduced shrinkage porosity and eliminated macrosegregation of the eutectic and the silicon. Computer modeling has aided optimization of the die...|$|R
40|$|The {{structure}} of the particle formed by the SFVmSQL mutant of Semliki Forest virus (SFV) has been defined by cryo-electron microscopy and image reconstruction to a resolution of 21 Å. The SQL mutation blocks the cleavage of p 62, the precursor of the spike proteins E 2 and E 3, which normally occurs in the trans-Golgi. The uncleaved spike protein is insensitive to the low pH treatment that triggers membrane fusion during entry of the wild-type virus. The conformation of the spike in the SFVmSQL particle should correspond {{to that of the}} inactive precursor found {{in the early stages of}} the secretory pathway. Comparison of this 'precursor' structure with that of the mature, wild-type, virus allows visualization of the changes that lead to activation, the first step in the pathway toward fusion. We find that the conformational change in the spike is dramatic but localized. The projecting domains of the spikes are completely separated in the precursor and close to generate a cavity in the mature spike. E 1, the fusion peptide-bearing protein, interacts only with the p 62 in its own third of the trimer before cleavage and then collapses to form a trimer of heterotrimers (E 1 E 2 E 3) 3 surrounding the cavity, poised for the pH-induced conformational change that leads to fusion. The capsid, transmembrane regions and the spike <b>skirts</b> (<b>thin</b> layers of protein that link spikes above the membrane) remain unchanged by cleavage. Similarly, the interactions of the spikes with the nucleocapsid through the transmembrane domains remain constant. Hence, the interactions that lead to virus assembly are unaffected by the SFVmSQL mutation...|$|R
40|$|Grasstrees (Xanthorrhoea) are an {{important}} structural component of many Australian ecosystems and also {{an important}} resource for many fauna species. Grasstrees have distinctive morphologies, with a crown of long <b>thin</b> leaves and <b>skirts,</b> the latter of which are accumulated dead leaves; both are incinerated by fire. This study determined the morphological features of Xanthorrhoea preissii, which change in response to fire from 6 months to 21 years post-burn. In addition, using radio-telemetry and spool-tracking, we determined that grasstrees are utilised as foraging and nesting resources for mardos (Antechinus flavipes leucogaster (Gray, 1841), Marsupialia: Dasyuridae). Recently burnt grasstrees (6 months post-burn) appeared not {{to be used by}} mardos at all. We found few mardos in these recently burnt sites, and the one individual we managed to track for 126 m utilised only a single grasstree: a 2 -m-tall multiple-crowned grasstree that had escaped the fire was used as a nest site. For sites 5 years post-burn, mardos selectively utilised grasstrees with larger crown areas and those with a greater number of crowns compared with a random sample of available trees. At the 14 -year post-burn sites, mardos still demonstrated some selection for grasstrees, although no specific single feature could be determined as most significant. We recorded humidity and temperature buffering effects in association with post-burn accumulation of grasstree skirt material and found that even dead grasstree ‘logs’ were an important resource for nests. We conclude that mardos utilise both live and dead grasstrees for foraging and nest sites, possibly owing to the availability of dense cover, a buffered microclimate, and potentially also food resources. Fire-management policies that promote habitat heterogeneity and retain several intact-skirted grasstrees within the landscape are likely to benefit mardos...|$|R
