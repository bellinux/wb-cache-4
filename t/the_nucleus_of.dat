5|$|In 1874, Ivanović offered four of her {{paintings}} to the Gallery of Historical Portraits, <b>the</b> <b>nucleus</b> <b>of</b> what was later {{to become the}} National Museum of Serbia. One of these paintings was The Conquest of Belgrade. The work remains {{in the possession of}} the National Museum, and is classified under inventory number 413.|$|E
5|$|In 1943, the 5th and 8th King's (Liverpool Irish) {{received}} specialist {{training at}} Ayrshire {{in preparation for}} a planned invasion of France. They had been selected to form <b>the</b> <b>nucleus</b> <b>of</b> the 5th and 7th Beach Groups, which would have the objectives of maintaining beach organisation, securing positions, and providing defence against counter-attack.|$|E
5|$|WTTG and New York's WABD (later WNEW-TV, and now WNYW) survived as Metromedia-owned independents until 1986, when Metromedia was {{purchased}} by the News Corporation to form <b>the</b> <b>nucleus</b> <b>of</b> the new Fox Broadcasting Company. Clarke Ingram, who maintained a DuMont memorial site, has suggested that Fox {{can be considered a}} revival, or at least a linear descendant, of DuMont.|$|E

50|$|Conjugate eye {{movement}} refers to motor coordination {{of the eyes}} that allows for bilateral fixation on a single object. Several centers in the brainstem are involved. Horizontal conjugate gaze is controlled by <b>the</b> <b>nuclei</b> <b>of</b> CN III and CN VI, the paramedian pontine reticular formation, and <b>the</b> <b>nucleus</b> prepositus hypoglossi-medial vestibular nucleus. Vertical conjugate gaze is controlled by <b>the</b> <b>nuclei</b> <b>of</b> CN III and CN IV, <b>the</b> rostral interstitial <b>nucleus</b> <b>of</b> medial longitudinal fasciculus (riMLF), and <b>the</b> interstitial <b>nucleus</b> <b>of</b> Cajal.|$|R

And it remains central {{in the adult}} human body {{as it was in}} the egg-cell. In the adult human body <b>the</b> first <b>nucleus</b> <b>of</b> independence, first-born from <b>the</b> great original <b>nucleus</b> <b>of</b> our conception, lies always established in the lumbar ganglion. Here we have our positive center of independence, in a multifarious universe.|$|R
5|$|When the {{airborne}} establishment was expanded, No. 11 Special Air Service Battalion was renamed 1st Parachute Battalion, and eventually formed <b>the</b> <b>nucleus</b> <b>of</b> 1st Parachute Brigade {{when it was}} created in September 1941.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} development {{during this}} period was {{the establishment of the}} Narrow Gauge Railway Museum at Tywyn Wharf station. The first exhibit for what was to become the museum was a locomotive donated in 1952 by Guinness from their recently closed St. James's Gate Brewery railway. In 1954 the Preservation Society agreed to start work on a formal museum and exhibits from around the United Kingdom were acquired to form <b>the</b> <b>nucleus</b> <b>of</b> the collection. In 1955 work started on converting the old gunpowder store at Wharf station into a temporary museum building, and in 1956 the first exhibit arrived at Tywyn.|$|E
5|$|Founded in 1852 by Rabbi Abraham Ash as Beth Hamedrash, the {{congregation}} split in 1859, with the rabbi {{and most of}} the members renaming their congregation Beth Hamedrash Hagodol. The congregation's president and a small number of the members eventually formed <b>the</b> <b>nucleus</b> <b>of</b> Kahal Adath Jeshurun, also known as the Eldridge Street Synagogue. Rabbi Jacob Joseph, the first and only Chief Rabbi of New York City, led {{the congregation}} from 1888 to 1902. Rabbi Ephraim Oshry, one of the few European Jewish legal decisors to survive the Holocaust, led the congregation from 1952 to 2003.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>nuclei</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{male and}} female gametocytes of the malarial parasites {Plasmo-dium and Hepatocystis) are Feulgen-negative, while <b>the</b> <b>nuclei</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gametocytes of Hepatozoon, which are not sexually differentiated, are Feulgen-positive. <b>The</b> <b>nuclei</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> male gametocytes of Eimeria are {{strongly}} Feulgen-positive, while <b>the</b> <b>nuclei</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> female gametocytes are Feulgen-negative. <b>The</b> <b>nuclei</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> male gametes of Plasmodium are Feulgen-negative, while <b>the</b> <b>nuclei</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> male gametes of Eimeria are strongly Feulgen-positive. DNA appeared {{to be present in}} the gametocytes of Plas-modium when the fluorescence method of Armstrong (1956) was employed. Feulgen-positive inclusions have been found to occur in the cytoplasm of some of the oocysts of Plasmodium. The oocysts containing such inclusions may degenerate totally or partially. There is no evidence to relate this type of degeneration with the formation of Ross's black spores. These inclusions have been found in abundance in the oo'cysts of P. cynomolgi, while in those of P. gallinaceum they were found only once. Certain Feulgen-positive granules have been found in the cytoplasm of some of the oocysts and the female gametocytes of Eimeria. These granules {{did not appear to be}} related to any degenerating changes. A probable loss <b>of</b> some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nuclei</b> during sporogony <b>of</b> Eimeria is discussed. <b>The</b> <b>nuclei</b> in <b>the</b> early pre-erythrocytic schizonts of Plasmodium cynomolgi are Feulgen-positive, notwithstanding an earlier report to the contrary...|$|R
50|$|Ten of {{the twelve}} pairs of cranial nerves either target or are sourced from <b>the</b> brainstem. <b>The</b> <b>nuclei</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> oculomotor nerve (III) and trochlear nerve (IV) are located in <b>the</b> midbrain. <b>The</b> <b>nuclei</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trigeminal nerve (V), abducens nerve (VI), facial nerve (VII) and vestibulocochlear nerve (VIII) are located in <b>the</b> pons. <b>The</b> <b>nuclei</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{glossopharyngeal}} nerve (IX), vagus nerve (X), accessory nerve (XI) and hypoglossal nerve (XII) {{are located in the}} medulla.

5|$|Ivanović was {{inspired}} to create the painting upon reading a book titled History of the Serb People while studying at the Munich Academy. The painting was poorly received by Belgrade's art critics. The art historian Lilien Filipovitch-Robinson suggests {{this was due to}} its poor compositional and spatial conception. By the 1870s, Ivanović's works had largely been forgotten in Serbia. The Conquest of Belgrade was one of four paintings offered by Ivanović to the Gallery of Historical Portraits in 1874. The Gallery went on to form <b>the</b> <b>nucleus</b> <b>of</b> what was to become the National Museum of Serbia. The painting is currently in the possession of the National Museum.|$|E
5|$|Northeast Minnesota has 2700-million-year-ago exposed rocks formed during {{volcanic}} activity {{that was in}} the form of seepage of lava from rifts in the sea floor. These lava flows began to rise up out of the ancient ocean to form the Superior craton; the Superior craton later assembled into the Canadian shield, which became part of the North American craton. The Superior province is the largest preserved fragment of Archean crust, and the Canadian shield is <b>the</b> <b>nucleus</b> <b>of</b> the North American craton.|$|E

5|$|On February 4 and 5, Grant landed two {{divisions}} {{just north of}} Fort Henry on the Tennessee River. (The troops serving under Grant were <b>the</b> <b>nucleus</b> <b>of</b> the Union's successful Army of the Tennessee, although that name was not yet in use.) Grant's plan was to advance upon the fort on February 6 while it was being simultaneously attacked by Union gunboats commanded by Flag Officer Andrew Hull Foote. A combination of accurate and effective naval gunfire, heavy rain, and the poor siting of the fort, nearly inundated by rising river waters, caused its commander, Brig. Gen. Lloyd Tilghman, to surrender to Foote before the Union Army arrived.|$|E
5|$|Other notable Irish {{physicists}} include Ernest Walton, {{winner of}} the 1951 Nobel Prize in Physics. With Sir John Douglas Cockcroft, {{he was the first}} to split <b>the</b> <b>nucleus</b> <b>of</b> the atom by artificial means and made contributions to the development of a new theory of wave equation. William Thomson, or Lord Kelvin, is the person whom the absolute temperature unit, the kelvin, is named after. Sir Joseph Larmor, a physicist and mathematician, made innovations in the understanding of electricity, dynamics, thermodynamics and the electron theory of matter. His most influential work was Aether and Matter, a book on theoretical physics published in 1900.|$|E
5|$|Piłsudski {{anticipated}} {{a coming}} European {{war and the}} need to organize <b>the</b> <b>nucleus</b> <b>of</b> a future Polish Army which could help win Poland's independence from the three empires that had partitioned her out of political existence in the late 18th century. In 1906 Piłsudski, with the connivance of Austrian authorities, founded a military school in Kraków for the training of paramilitary units. In 1906 alone, the 800-strong paramilitaries, operating in five-man teams in Congress Poland, killed 336 Russian officials; in subsequent years, the number of their casualties declined, while the paramilitaries' numbers increased to some 2,000 in 1908.|$|E

5000|$|The cell {{bodies of}} many of the neurons of most of the cranial nerves are {{contained}} in one or more <b>nuclei</b> in <b>the</b> brainstem. These <b>nuclei</b> are important relative to cranial nerve dysfunction because damage to these nuclei such as from a stroke or trauma can mimic damage to one or more branches of a cranial nerve. In terms of specific cranial nerve <b>nuclei,</b> <b>the</b> midbrain <b>of</b> the brainstem has <b>the</b> <b>nuclei</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> oculomotor nerve (III) and trochlear nerve (IV); the pons has <b>the</b> <b>nuclei</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trigeminal nerve (V), abducens nerve (VI), facial nerve (VII) and vestibulocochlear nerve (VIII); and the medulla has <b>the</b> <b>nuclei</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> glossopharyngeal nerve (IX), vagus nerve (X), accessory nerve (XI) and hypoglossal nerve (XII).

5|$|TCDD may in some {{conditions}} potentiate the carcinogenic {{effects of}} other compounds. An example is benzo(a)pyrene that is metabolized in two steps, oxidation and conjugation. Oxidation produces epoxide carcinogens that are rapidly detoxified by conjugation, but some molecules may escape to <b>the</b> <b>nucleus</b> <b>of</b> the cell and bind to DNA causing a mutation, resulting in cancer initiation. When TCDD increases {{the activity of}} oxidative enzymes more than conjugation enzymes, the epoxide intermediates may increase, increasing the possibility of cancer initiation. Thus a beneficial activation of detoxifying enzymes may lead to deleterious side effects.|$|E
5|$|The Louvre Palace was altered {{frequently}} {{throughout the}} Middle Ages. In the 14thcentury, CharlesV converted the building into a residence and in 1546, FrancisI renovated {{the site in}} French Renaissance style. Francis acquired what would become <b>the</b> <b>nucleus</b> <b>of</b> the Louvre's holdings, his acquisitions including Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa.
