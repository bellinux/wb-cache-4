5|$|If the {{dissection}} of <b>the</b> <b>artery</b> {{extends to}} the part of <b>the</b> <b>artery</b> that lies inside the skull, subarachnoid hemorrhage may occur (1% of cases). This arises due to rupture of <b>the</b> <b>artery</b> and accumulation {{of blood in the}} subarachnoid space. It may be characterized by a different, usually severe headache; it may also cause a range of additional neurological symptoms.|$|E
5|$|Arteria thyroidea ima is the Latin name of <b>the</b> <b>artery.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>artery</b> is only {{present in}} {{approximately}} 3–10% of the population. Thyroid ima artery is of surgical importance; {{due to its}} relatively small size and infrequent presence it can cause complications such as severe bleeding in surgery of the thorax, trachea, thyroid or parathyroid glands. Knowledge of occurrence of <b>the</b> <b>artery</b> is especially important during tracheostomy and thyroidectomy. Because <b>the</b> <b>artery</b> is smaller than the other thyroid vessels, and having an origin {{from one of the}} bigger vessels, a brisk cut while performing the surgery may cause complications such as severe hemorrhage and significant blood loss. <b>The</b> <b>artery,</b> if dissected, may draw back into the mediastinum and further complicate the condition by causing hemorrhage and clots in the thoracic cavity.|$|E

25|$|Like the face, {{the human}} nose is well vascularized with arteries and veins, and thus {{supplied}} with abundant blood. The principal arterial blood-vessel {{supply to the}} nose is two-fold: (i) branches from <b>the</b> internal carotid <b>artery,</b> <b>the</b> branch of <b>the</b> anterior ethmoid <b>artery,</b> <b>the</b> branch of <b>the</b> posterior ethmoid <b>artery,</b> which derive from the ophthalmic artery; (ii) branches from <b>the</b> external carotid <b>artery,</b> <b>the</b> sphenopalatine <b>artery,</b> <b>the</b> greater palatine <b>artery,</b> <b>the</b> superior labial <b>artery,</b> and <b>the</b> angular <b>artery.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... dextro-Transposition of <b>the</b> great <b>arteries</b> (d-Transposition of <b>the</b> great <b>arteries,</b> dextro-TGA, or d-TGA), {{sometimes}} {{also referred}} to as complete transposition of <b>the</b> great <b>arteries,</b> is a birth defect in <b>the</b> large <b>arteries</b> of <b>the</b> heart. <b>The</b> primary <b>arteries</b> (<b>the</b> aorta and <b>the</b> pulmonary <b>artery)</b> are transposed.|$|R
5|$|When present, {{the thyroid}} ima's chief supply is the thyroid gland, though it also {{supplies}} the trachea. <b>The</b> <b>artery</b> may extend and supply the parathyroid glands. An infrequently observed artery, {{it is more}} frequently reported {{in the context of}} enlarged parathyroid glands (parathyroid adenomas). <b>The</b> <b>artery</b> ends by supplying the thyroid gland, or the parathyroid glands, as a single unit or as multiple branches. <b>The</b> <b>artery</b> is also found to be the only supply of the parathyroid gland in rare cases.|$|E
5|$|If the {{symptoms}} of delayed ischemia do not improve with medical treatment, angiography may be attempted to identify the sites of vasospasms and administer vasodilator medication (drugs that relax the blood vessel wall) directly into <b>the</b> <b>artery.</b> Angioplasty (opening the constricted area with a balloon) may also be performed.|$|E
5|$|In {{cases where}} {{the length of the}} thyroid ima artery is shorter, <b>the</b> <b>artery</b> ends by {{supplying}} the thymus gland and is known as thymica accessoria.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> {{superficial}} brachial <b>artery</b> continuing into <b>the</b> forearm as <b>the</b> radial <b>artery</b> {{was observed}} in the right upper limb of an 86 -year-old Japanese woman who died of pneumonia.

50|$|The {{superficial}} palmar arch {{is formed}} predominantly by <b>the</b> ulnar <b>artery,</b> with a contribution from the superficial palmar branch of <b>the</b> radial <b>artery.</b> However, in some individuals the contribution from <b>the</b> radial <b>artery</b> might be absent, and instead anastomoses with either <b>the</b> princeps pollicis <b>artery,</b> <b>the</b> radialis indicis <b>artery,</b> or <b>the</b> median <b>artery,</b> <b>the</b> former {{two of which}} are branches from <b>the</b> radial <b>artery.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> gastroepiploic <b>arteries</b> are arteries {{that supply}} oxygenated {{blood to the}} stomach. <b>The</b> right gastroepiploic <b>artery</b> arises when <b>the</b> {{gastroduodenal}} <b>artery</b> bifurcates. <b>The</b> left gastroepiploic <b>artery</b> arises from <b>the</b> splenic <b>artery.</b> <b>The</b> gastroepiploic <b>arteries</b> anastomose to one another on the greater curvature of the stomach.|$|R
5|$|Subarachnoid hemorrage due to {{arterial}} rupture typically occurs if the dissection extends {{into the}} V4 section of <b>the</b> <b>artery.</b> This {{may be explained}} by the fact that the arterial wall is thinner and lacks a number of structural supports in this section.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of thyroid ima artery is also observed in other higher primates. <b>The</b> <b>artery</b> {{has been reported}} in gorillas, gibbons, macaques and gray langurs. Variations in the origin were also seen; it was found to originate from the aorta in the thorax, or the carotid in the neck.|$|E
5|$|The thyroid ima artery {{was first}} defined by German anatomist Johann E. Neubauer {{in the year}} 1772.

50|$|The ECU is {{supplied}} by <b>the</b> ulnar <b>artery.</b> <b>The</b> APL, EPB, EPL, EI, ED, and EDM are supplied by <b>the</b> Posterior interosseous <b>artery,</b> {{a branch of}} <b>the</b> ulnar <b>artery.</b> <b>The</b> ECRL and ECRB receive blood from <b>the</b> radial <b>artery.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> carotid <b>artery</b> is <b>the</b> large {{vertical}} <b>artery</b> in red. <b>The</b> {{blood supply}} to <b>the</b> carotid <b>artery</b> starts at <b>the</b> arch of the aorta (bottom). <b>The</b> carotid <b>artery</b> divides into <b>the</b> internal carotid <b>artery</b> and <b>the</b> external carotid <b>artery.</b> <b>The</b> internal carotid <b>artery</b> supplies <b>the</b> brain. Plaque often builds {{up at that}} division, and causes a narrowing (stenosis). Pieces of plaque can break off and block <b>the</b> small <b>arteries</b> above in <b>the</b> brain, which causes a stroke. Plaque can also build up at the origin of <b>the</b> carotid <b>artery</b> at <b>the</b> aorta.|$|R
5|$|On September 24, 2005, Cheney {{underwent}} a six-hour endo-vascular procedure to repair popliteal artery aneurysms bilaterally, a catheter treatment technique used in <b>the</b> <b>artery</b> behind each knee. The condition was discovered at a regular physical in July, {{and was not}} life-threatening. Cheney was hospitalized for tests after experiencing shortness of breath five months later. In late April 2006, an ultrasound revealed that the clot was smaller.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>artery</b> has a {{variable}} origin. It mostly {{arises from the}} brachiocephalic trunk, but may also originate from the aortic arch, the right common carotid, the subclavian, the pericardiacophrenic artery, the thyrocervical trunk, the transverse scapular or the internal thoracic artery. It ascends {{in front of the}} trachea in the superior mediastinum to {{the lower part of the}} thyroid gland.|$|E
5|$|The {{middle ear}} is {{supplied}} by the mastoid branch of either the occipital or posterior auricular arteries and the deep auricular artery, {{a branch of the}} maxillary artery.

40|$|Summary: Venous fenestrations are a {{rarely seen}} entity in the neck. Although their {{clinical}} significance is question-able, their importance in presurgical planning may be con-siderable. We present {{a report of}} two cases of internal jugular vein fenestration. Fenestrations, or complete divisions of vasculature, have been described in many of <b>the</b> craniocervical <b>arteries.</b> One postmortem study has shown {{that as many as}} 6 % of people have a fenestrated basilar artery (1). Arterial fenestrations have been described in <b>the</b> vertebral <b>artery,</b> <b>the</b> basilar <b>artery,</b> <b>the</b> middle cerebral <b>artery,</b> <b>the</b> anterior cerebral <b>artery,</b> <b>the</b> pos-terioinferior cerebellar <b>artery,</b> <b>the</b> posterior cerebral <b>artery,</b> <b>the</b> posterior communicating <b>artery,</b> and <b>the</b> internal carotid <b>artery.</b> Although multiple craniocer-vical arterial fenestrations have been described, ve-nous fenestrations have not. Two recent cases of in-ternal jugular vein fenestrations are described herein...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: In this study, the circulus arteriosus cerebri of the {{squirrel}} was investigated. Ten squirrel were used. Coloured latex was given from left ventriculi {{of the all}} squirrels. Circulus arteriosus cerebri was examined after the dissection was made. <b>The</b> basilar <b>artery</b> was formed by merge of {{the right and left}} vertebral <b>artery.</b> <b>The</b> caudal communicans <b>artery</b> which was caudal part of circulus arteriosus cerebri was formed by <b>the</b> basilar <b>artery</b> on sulcus pontocrurale. From caudal to cranial, the branches originated from <b>the</b> basilar <b>artery</b> and circulus arte-riosus cerebri to cerebrum and cerebellum were as follows: the caudal cerebelli artery,rami ad pontem, <b>the</b> rostral cerebelli <b>artery,</b> <b>the</b> caudal choroidea <b>artery,</b> <b>the</b> caudal cerebral <b>artery,</b> <b>the</b> internal ophtalmic <b>artery,</b> <b>the</b> rostral choroidea <b>artery,</b> <b>the</b> media cerebral <b>artery,</b> rami striati and <b>the</b> rostral cerebral <b>artery.</b> In squirrels a variability was observed in the branches that <b>the</b> rostral cerebral <b>artery</b> gives, and their endings. It was determined that <b>the</b> internal carotid <b>artery</b> didn’t exist in 4 animals when the right and left vertebral artery were ligatured. It was found that <b>the</b> internal carotid <b>artery</b> didn’t contribute to the arterial blood to circulus arteriosus cerebri and the arterial blood to circulus arteriosus cerebri of squirrels is provided via only <b>the</b> basilar <b>artery...</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{superior}} parathyroid glands {{receive their}} blood from <b>the</b> inferior thyroid <b>arteries.</b> <b>The</b> inferior parathyroid glands receive a variable blood supply, {{from either the}} ascending branch of <b>the</b> inferior thyroid <b>arteries</b> or <b>the</b> thyroid ima <b>artery.</b> <b>The</b> inferior thyroid <b>artery</b> arises from <b>the</b> subclavian <b>arteries.</b>|$|R
5|$|Vertebral artery {{dissection}} (VAD) is a flap-like tear of {{the inner}} lining of the vertebral artery, which {{is located in the}} neck and supplies blood to the brain. After the tear, blood enters the arterial wall and forms a blood clot, thickening <b>the</b> <b>artery</b> wall and often impeding blood flow. The symptoms of vertebral artery dissection include head and neck pain and intermittent or permanent stroke symptoms such as difficulty speaking, impaired coordination and visual loss. It is usually diagnosed with a contrast-enhanced CT or MRI scan.|$|E
5|$|Vertebral artery {{dissection}} {{is one of}} the {{two types}} of dissection of the arteries in the neck. The other type, carotid artery dissection, involves the carotid arteries. Vertebral artery dissection is further classified as being either traumatic (caused by mechanical trauma to the neck) or spontaneous, and it may also be classified by the part of <b>the</b> <b>artery</b> involved: extracranial (the part outside the skull) and intracranial (the part inside the skull).|$|E
5|$|Adjacent to the {{pituitary}} lies {{a part of}} {{the skull}} base known as the cavernous sinus. This contains a number of nerves that control the eye muscles. 70% of people with pituitary apoplexy experience double vision due to compression of one of the nerves. In half of these cases, the oculomotor nerve (the third cranial nerve), which controls a number of eye muscles, is affected. This leads to diagonal double vision and a dilated pupil. The fourth (trochlear) and sixth (abducens) cranial nerves are located in the same compartment and can cause diagonal or horizontal double vision, respectively. The oculomotor nerve is predominantly affected as it lies closest to the pituitary. The cavernous sinus also contains the carotid artery, which supplies blood to the brain; occasionally, compression of <b>the</b> <b>artery</b> can lead to one-sided weakness and other symptoms of stroke.|$|E

5|$|Koufax had {{his strong}} season despite an injured {{pitching}} hand. While batting in April, Koufax had been jammed by a pitch from Earl Francis. A numbness developed in Koufax's index finger {{on his left}} hand, and the finger became cold and white. Koufax was pitching better than ever, however, so he ignored the problem, hoping that the condition would clear up. By July, though, his entire hand was becoming numb and {{he was unable to}} complete some games. In a start in Cincinnati, his finger split open after one inning. A vascular specialist determined that Koufax had a crushed artery in his palm. Ten days of experimental medicine successfully reopened <b>the</b> <b>artery.</b> Koufax finally was able to pitch again in September, when the team was locked in a tight pennant race with the Giants. But after the long layoff, Koufax was ineffective in three appearances as the Giants caught the Dodgers {{at the end of the}} regular season, forcing a three-game playoff.|$|E
5|$|Two {{additional}} semilunar valves sit at {{the exit}} {{of each of the}} ventricles. The pulmonary valve is located {{at the base of the}} pulmonary artery. This has three cusps which are not attached to any papillary muscles. When the ventricle relaxes blood flows back into the ventricle from <b>the</b> <b>artery</b> and this flow of blood fills the pocket-like valve, pressing against the cusps which close to seal the valve. The semilunar aortic valve is at the base of the aorta and also is not attached to papillary muscles. This too has three cusps which close with the pressure of the blood flowing back from the aorta.|$|E
5|$|From {{analysis}} of the existing small treatment trials of cervical artery dissection (carotid and vertebral) it appears that aspirin and anticoagulation (heparin followed by warfarin) are equally effective in {{reducing the risk of}} further stroke or death. Anticoagulation is regarded as more powerful than antiplatelet therapy, but anticoagulants may increase the size of the hematoma and worsen obstruction of the affected artery. Anticoagulation may be relatively unsafe if a large stroke has already occurred, as hemorrhagic transformation is relatively common, and if the dissection extends into V4 (carrying a risk of subarachnoid hemorrhage). Anticoagulation may be appropriate if there is rapid blood flow (through a severely narrowed vessel) on transcranial doppler despite the use of aspirin, if there is a completely occluded vessel, if there are recurrent stroke-like episodes, or if free-floating blood clot is visible on scans. Warfarin is typically continued for 3–6 months, as during this time the flow through <b>the</b> <b>artery</b> usually improves, and most strokes happen within the first 6 months after the development of the dissection. Some regard 3 months as sufficient.|$|E
