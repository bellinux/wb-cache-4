40|$|It {{is shown}} {{that on the}} basis of {{existing}} high-speed airfoil data, propeller efficiencies appreciably in excess of 40 % do not appear possible at speeds above 500 miles per hour at 20, 000 feet. The assumption that present propeller-blade thicknesses cannot be reduced radically, is implied. Until the reliability and applicability of the airfoil data are established, this conclusion must not be regarded as infallible. Dive tests with airplanes equipped with thrust <b>meters</b> and <b>torque</b> <b>meters</b> are proposed to provide an urgently needed check. The design of high-speed propellers is dictated wholly by compressibility considerations. The blade width, thickness, and pitch distribution; also the airfoil sections, the lift coefficient, the propeller diameter, and rpm must all be adjusted if reasonable efficiencies are to be maintained at airplane speeds that are now being approached. Research is urgently needed on: 1) airfoils at subsonic, sonic, and supersonic speeds; 2) propellers at high forward speeds in wind tunnels; 3) propellers in free flight at high speeds; and 4) jet propulsion and related devices. The breakdown of propeller efficiency indicated by airfoil data, should serve as an incentive for accelerated research on jet propulsion.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the range of motion (ROM) (in degrees) of the upper limb and trunk, forces (Newtons), two-dimensional fraction effective force (FEF 2 D) (in percent), and <b>torque</b> (Newton <b>meters)</b> during hand cycling. Seven nondisabled participants performed a 1 min exercise test at 70 rpm on a hand cycle (HC) fixed to an ergometer in synchronous (SC) mode versus asynchronous (AC) mode and in arm-power (AP) versus arm-trunk-power (ATP) type of propulsion. Higher (p < 0. 001) flexion/extension of the trunk was found during ATP versus AP type and higher (p < 0. 001) lateral flexion and rotation of the trunk in AC versus SC mode. The trunk ROM should explain the different force generation patterns observed in this investigation between AC and SC modes and AP and ATP types. However, kinetic results do not allow the most effective type or mode of propulsion (FEF 2 D: from 72. 9 % to 89. 3 %) to be established. We conclude that trunk movement is an important parameter to consider in ergonomically optimizing hand cycling. Nevertheless, future studies in experienced HC users, especially with limited trunk function, should be performed...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Accurate measurement of a vehicle's resistance to motion on a road (the 'road load'), and the separation of this resistive force into its contributory components is of fundamental importance to generate the data required for vehicle performance assessment, the calibration of a modem chassis dynamometer and for comparing the drag of different vehicles or vehicle configurations. Established methods of determining road load on a test track are the coastdown and steady state torque tests, but environmental variability (largely due to ambient wind) and differences in the vehicle operating conditions cause wide variation in the results. This thesis describes a comprehensive study into methods of acquiring and analysing road load data at a test track. A mathematical model of the vehicle travelling in a straight line, {{in the presence of}} ambient wind, is developed and may be applied to measured data obtained in both the coastdown and the steady state test modes. The model includes the aerodynamic drag, tyre losses, transmission and un-driven wheel losses and the variation of aerodynamic drag with yaw angle. Experimental data obtained at a test track, using advanced instrumentation (including on-board anemometry and wheel <b>torque</b> <b>meters)</b> are analysed to obtain estimates of the coefficients in the road load equation. The results from an initial study demonstrate the importance of measuring the local wind at the test vehicle and the transmission losses if the total drag is to be accurately measured and separated into its contributory components. The coastdown method is shown to be more accurate and repeatable than the steady state method, and is therefore used as the basis of an advanced test procedure. Up to four coefficients can be determined from the coastdown data using a parameter optimisation routine. This routine fits the mathematical model to the measured coastdown profile to obtain estimates of the road load coefficients including the variation of aerodynamic drag coefficient with yaw angle. Results using this analytical method show that all four coefficients can be determined from coastdown data if there is sufficient ambient wind, and hence lay the basis for an advanced test method using only data from track tests. Constrained methods, where {{one or more of the}} parameters is fixed, can be used to investigate a single source of drag. The reduction in the total number of tests required to achieve an acceptable level of accuracy in the variable coefficients when using the constrained method is demonstrated...|$|R

A work model was obtained from a metal matrix with five 3. 75 x 9 mm external hex implants with standard platform (4. 1 mm). Four frameworks were waxed using UCLA type abutments and one-piece cast in commercially pure titanium. The misfit was analyzed with a comparator microscope after 20 Ncm torque.

40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} 1) {{the differences}} in maximum torque between 7 biodegradable and 2 titanium screw systems, and 2) the differences of maximum torque between "hand tight" and break of the biodegradable and the titanium osteofixation screw systems. Materials and Methods: Four oral and maxillofacial surgeons inserted 8 specimens of all 9 screw systems in polvmethylmethacrylate plates. The surgeons were instructed to insert the screws as they would do in the clinic (hand tight). The data were recorded by a <b>torque</b> measurement <b>meter.</b> A PhD resident inserted 8 specimens of {{the same set of}} 9 screw systems until fracture occurred. Likewise, the maximum applied torque was recorded. Results: 1) The mean maximum torque of the 2 titanium screw systems was significantly higher than that of the 7 biodegradable screw systems, and 2) the mean maximum torque for hand tight was significantly lower than for break in 2 biodegradable, and both titanium screw systems. Conclusions: Based on the results, we conclude that the 1. 5 nim and 2. 0 mm titanium screw systems still present the highest torqne strength compared with the biodegradable screw systems. When there is an intention to use biodegradable screws, we recommend the use of 2. 0 mm BioSorb FX (Linvatec Biomaterials Ltd, Tampere, Finland), 2. 0 mm LactoSorb (Walter Lorenz Surgical Inc, Jacksonville, FL), or the larger 2. 5 mm Inion (Inion Ltd, Tampere, Finland) screws.

The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the influence of tightening technique and the screw coating on the loosening torque of screws used for Universal Abutment fixation after cyclic loading. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Forty implants (Titamax Ti Cortical, HE, Neodent) (n= 10) were submerged in acrylic resin and four tightening techniques for Universal Abutment fixation were evaluated: A – torque with 32 Ncm (control); B – torque with 32 Ncm holding the <b>torque</b> <b>meter</b> for 20 seconds; C – torque with 32 Ncm and retorque after 10 minutes; D – torque (32 Ncm) holding the <b>torque</b> <b>meter</b> for 20 seconds and retorque after 10 minutes as initially. Samples were divided into subgroups according to the screw used: conventional titanium screw or diamond like carbon-coated (DLC) screw. Metallic crowns were fabricated for each abutment. Samples were submitted to cyclic loading at 106 cycles and 130 N of force. Data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA and Tukey’s test (5 %). RESULTS. The tightening technique did not show significant influence on the loosening torque of screws (P=. 509). Conventional titanium screws showed significant higher loosening torque values than DLC (P=. 000). CONCLUSION.

The ranges of attainable test conditions include load from 100 to greater h than 50, 000 lb (445 to greater than 2. 22 x 10 (exp 5) N), resisting torque up to 30, 000 lb-in. (approximately equal to 3, 390 N-m), oscillating rotation through an angle as large as 280 degrees, and oscillation frequency from 0 to 6 Hz.

40|$|The {{flexibility}} of behavior is so rich, and its components are so exquisitely interwoven, that {{one may be}} well advised to turn to an isolated behavioral module for study. Gill withdrawal in Aplysia, the proboscis extension reflex in the honeybee, and lid closure in mammals are such examples. We have chosen yawing, a single component of flight orientation in Drosophila melanogaster, for this approach. A specialty of this preparation is that the behavioral output can be reduced beyond the single module by one further step. It can be studied in tethered animals in which all turns are blocked while the differentially beating wings still provide the momentum. These intended yaw turns are measured by a <b>torque</b> <b>meter</b> to which the fly is hooked. The fly is held horizontally as if cruising at high speed. The head is glued to the thorax. It can bend its abdomen, extend its proboscis, and move its legs but cannot shift its direction of gaze or its orientation in space.

40|$|Scrupulous {{measurements}} and detailed data {{analysis of the}} torque in a swirling turbulent flow driven by counter-rotating bladed disks reveals an apparent breaking {{of the law of}} similarity. Potentially, such breakdown could arise from several possible factors, including dependence on dimensionless numbers other that $Re$ or velocity coupling to other fields such as temperature. However, careful redesign and calibration of the experiment showed that this unexpected result was due to background errorscaused by minute misalignments which lead to a noisy and irreproducible torque signal at low rotation speeds and prevented correct background subtraction normally ascribed to frictional losses. An important lesson to be learnt is that multiple minute misalignments can nonlinearly couple to the torque signal and provide a dc offset that cannot be removed by averaging. That offset can cause the observed divergence of the friction coefficient C_f from its constant value observed in the turbulent regime. To minimize the friction and misalignments, we significantly modified the experimental setup and carried out the experiment with one bladed disk where the disk, <b>torque</b> <b>meter</b> and motor shaft axes can be aligned with significantly smaller error, close to the <b>torque</b> <b>meter</b> resolution. As a result we made precise measurements with high resolution and sensitivity of the small torques produced for low rotation speeds for several water-glycerin solutions of different viscosities and confirmed the similarity law {{in a wide range of}} Re in particular in low viscosity fluids.
