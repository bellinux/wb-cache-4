5000|$|This can be {{contrasted with}} the {{behaviour}} of an aircraft with positive stability, which, when [...] trimmed to fly at a certain attitude, {{will continue to do}} so in the absence of control input, and if perturbed will oscillate in simple harmonic motion on a decreasing scale around and eventually return to the trimmed attitude. A positively stable aircraft will also resist any bank movement. A Cessna 152 is an example of a stable aircraft. Similarly, an aircraft with neutral stability will not return to its <b>trimmed</b> <b>setting</b> without control input, but will oscillate in a stable simple harmonic motion around the <b>trimmed</b> <b>setting</b> continuously, neither increasing nor decreasing oscillation amplitude, and be susceptible to bank influences.|$|R

40|$|A frequency-based {{performance}} identification {{approach was}} evaluated using flight {{data from the}} NASA F- 15 Highly Integrated Digital Electronic Control aircraft. The approach used frequency separation to identify the effectiveness of multiple controls simultaneously {{as an alternative to}} independent control identification methods. Fourier transformations converted measured control and response data into frequency domain representations. Performance gradients were formed using multiterm frequency matching of control and response frequency domain models. An objective function was generated using these performance gradients. This function was formally optimized to produce a coordinated control <b>trim</b> <b>set.</b> This algorithm was applied to longitudinal acceleration and evaluated using two control effectors: nozzle throat area and inlet first ramp. Three criteria were investigated to validate the approach: simultaneous gradient identification, gradient frequency dependency, and repeatability. This report describes the flight test results. These data demonstrate that the approach can accurately identify performance gradients during simultaneous control excitation independent of excitation frequency...|$|E

50|$|The direct {{reason for}} an {{abnormally}} nose-up position {{was found to}} be an excessively high stabilizer <b>trim</b> <b>setting</b> (7.5 units ANU); likely, in the confusion due to switching seats, the pilots failed to reset the <b>trim</b> <b>setting</b> while performing takeoff checklists. (It was reported the first officer made this mistake occasionally.) Taking off at night, with no visual references, the inexperienced flight engineer did not manage to correct the attitude in time, leading to engine surges, aircraft banking and eventually an upset and an unrecoverable stall. It was not known why the captain did not manage to correct the situation; one possibility was that the flight engineer froze on the controls as he put the DC-8 into a gradual bank, and the opposite inputs from the captain had no effect on the movement of the stabilizer. The captain's decision to allow the flight engineer perform the takeoff was considered a contributing factor in the accident.|$|R

25|$|The crew never {{realized}} {{the severity of}} the fire. The fire was already too severe and started to degrade the structural integrity of the lift wing. This caused the crew to hardly be able to control the aircraft. The crew had to apply maximum aileron <b>trim</b> <b>setting</b> due to the reduction of the stiffness of the wing. The left wing then failed upwards, causing the aircraft to roll through 90 degree and crash, subsequently bursting into flames and killing everyone on board.|$|R

40|$|Two {{methods for}} {{scheduling}} {{the leading edge}} slat and optimizing lift-to-drag ratio (LDR) are compared. One method employs wind tunnel data on pitching moment, lift force, and drag force to obtain the LDR for assumed Mach number, slat position, and AOA while using an elevator setting that is taken as the <b>trim</b> <b>setting</b> for which the pitching moment is zero. The second method uses the complete 6 -DOF simulation model and associated trim algorithm to generate the LDR for a given flight condition and aircraft configuration. The comparison shows that the second method is more realistic as well as simple.

Here we defined the entire human TRIM family and also identified the <b>TRIM</b> <b>sets</b> of other vertebrate (mouse, rat, dog, cow, chicken, tetraodon, and zebrafish) and invertebrate species (fruitfly, worm, and ciona). By means of comparative analyses we found that, after assembly of the tripartite motif in an early metazoan ancestor, few types of C-terminal domains have been associated with this module during evolution and that an important increase in TRIM number occurred in vertebrate species concomitantly with the addition of the SPRY domain. We showed that the human TRIM family is split into two groups that differ in domain structure, genomic organization and evolutionary properties. Group 1 members present a variety of C-terminal domains, are highly conserved among vertebrate species, and are represented in invertebrates. Conversely, group 2 is absent in invertebrates, is characterized by the presence of a C-terminal SPRY domain and presents unique sets of genes in each mammal examined. The generation of independent sets of group 2 genes is also evident in the other vertebrate species.

25|$|Before Ariel {{had even}} crossed {{the bar of}} the Min River, Captain Keay had the crew working on the fore and aft trim of the ship, a process that {{continued}} for over two weeks. Adjustments were needed later in the voyage as stores and water were used. The loaded draft of 18 feet 8 inches forward and 18 feet 3 inches aft was eventually altered to 18 feet 1 inch forward and 18 feet 3 inches aft by moving some of the cargo into the after cabin, and generally moving aft any heavy movable material such as hawsers, casks of salt pork, and spare spars. This improved the steering and general sailing performance.
