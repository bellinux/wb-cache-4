5|$|As for the BIA's assurance, the Court {{that only}} {{meant that the}} {{termination}} act did not terminate the claim, not <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>statute</b> of limitations would not begin to run. Because the Court of Appeals had only held <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>statute</b> of limitation did not apply, not {{that it would not}} bar the claim if it applied, and the District Court had held the claim barred, the Court remanded to the Court of Appeals to pass on that conclusion of the District Court.|$|E
5|$|Browning, Gyles' attorney, cited a case {{which had}} also {{appeared}} before Hardwicke, that of Read v Hodges. In that case, a publisher attempted {{to circumvent the}} rights of the author of Czar Peter the Great by including all three volumes in one and cutting several pages. Hardwicke rejected the argument, however, declaring that the former case had been decided merely on a motion, and that he had given his decision and statements without the thought he would have given a normal hearing. Hardwicke further took contention with the Attorney General for England and Wales' assertion <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Statute</b> of Anne provided a publishing monopoly, instead interpreting the act as one meant to promote public education and the public good.|$|E
5|$|In {{answering}} {{both questions}} in the negative, the Court of Appeal overturned the High Court's finding <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>statute</b> was unconstitutional. The Court of Appeal further clarified Singapore's stance on legislative plenary power and expounded upon Article 12(1) of the Constitution, explaining that the promise of equality {{does not mean that}} all persons are to be treated equally, but simply that all persons in like situations will be treated alike. Drawing on foreign case law, the Court of Appeal further outlined the test to determine if a differentiating law falls foul of Article 12.|$|E

50|$|A {{three-judge panel}} of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, held <b>the</b> <b>statutes</b> unconstitutional and enjoined {{enforcement}} of the challenged provisions. 403 F.Supp. 931 (S.D.N.Y. 1975). On appeal, the Supreme Court reversed {{the decision of the}} district court, holding <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>statutes</b> were within <b>the</b> state's police power. The Supreme Court held <b>that</b> <b>the</b> state need not show the State action was necessary to solve the identified problem {{and that there was no}} basis for assuming <b>that</b> <b>the</b> state security provisions would be improperly administered. The Court dismissed the plaintiff's key concerns, holding <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>statutes</b> would not significantly deter patients from seeking necessary medication nor would <b>the</b> <b>statutes</b> impair physicians' right to practice medicine free from unwarranted state interference.|$|R
5|$|Mayor Daley and all law {{enforcement}} officials who had been deposed {{were excluded from the}} report. Also, the 75 credible abuse cases were overlooked; the report focused on doubts about the torture of the four pardoned death row inmates. Among the final costs were $6.2 million for the investigation and $7 million to hire outside counsel for Burge and his cohort. Many activists were disappointed to learn <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>statute</b> of limitations meant that Burge would not be prosecuted for torture. Debates in the op-ed pages continued for days. Egan explained his report to the public with legal theories and federal jurisdiction issues.|$|E
5|$|Florida's {{consideration}} {{of a bill}} to compensate victims of racial violence was the first by any U.S. state. Opponents argued that the bill set a dangerous precedent and put the onus of paying survivors and descendants on Floridians who {{had nothing to do}} with the incident in Rosewood. James Peters, who represented the State of Florida, argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>statute</b> of limitations applied because the law enforcement officials named in the lawsuit—Sheriff Walker and Governor Hardee—had died many years before. He also called into question the shortcomings of the report: although the historians were instructed not to write it with compensation in mind, they offered conclusions about the actions of Sheriff Walker and Governor Hardee. The report was based on investigations led by historians as opposed to legal experts; they relied in cases on information that was hearsay from witnesses who had since died. Critics thought that some of the report's writers asked leading questions in their interviews.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, {{the tribe}} {{filed suit in}} the United States Court of Federal Claims, seeking $14,000,000 in damages for breach of trust by DOI. The tribe argued that the United States had {{exclusive}} control over the buildings and allowed them to fall into disrepair, {{a violation of the}} trust relationship established by the 1960 statute. Additionally, the tribe claimed that the Snyder Act and the National Historic Preservation Act applied in this case. The Snyder Act deals with appropriations to the BIA, and the National Historic Preservation Act discussed federal assistance for preservation programs. The United States moved for dismissal on the basis of lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim. In addition, the United States claimed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>statute</b> of limitations had run under both the Tucker Act and the Indian Tucker Act, the acts governing claims in the Federal Court of Claims. The trial court dismissed the suit on the failure to state a claim.|$|E
50|$|Justice Breyer {{issued a}} {{concurrence}} in <b>the</b> judgement, arguing <b>that</b> while <b>the</b> <b>statute</b> does limit speech, all human interactions limit speech as well. However, Breyer argued <b>that</b> because <b>the</b> <b>statute</b> was effectually under state law, {{that it should}} be remanded to the Second Circuit.|$|R
5000|$|The {{district}} court concluded <b>that</b> <b>the</b> amended <b>statute’s</b> definition of material [...] "harmful to juveniles” was not unconstitutionally vague, and thus satisfied the Supreme Court's tests under Miller and Ginsberg. However, the {{district court}} concluded <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>statute's</b> treatment of [...] "internet communications" [...] was unconstitutionally overbroad {{in violation of the}} First Amendment. The court then partially granted and denied summary judgment to both parties. [...] Both parties appealed the decision.|$|R

5|$|In United States v. Gooding (1827), the Court {{construed}} {{the elements}} of the fitting out offense. First, the Court held that the offense of fitting out a vessel for slave trading could be committed even if the owner of the vessel did not personally fit it out. Second, the Court held <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>statute</b> could be violated by a partial fitting out (as opposed to a complete fitting out) of a vessel for that purpose. Third, the Court held thatsince slave trading was a misdemeanorthere was no distinction between principal and accessory. Fourth, the Court held that, for the statute to be violated, the fitting out must have occurred within the United States. Finally, the Court held that the statute's mens rea required that the owner intend to cause the vessel to be used for slave trading, as opposed to intending that the vessel be used for slave trading (by some third party).|$|E
25|$|In Kring v. Missouri (1883), the Court {{also found}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>statute</b> {{violated}} the Constitution's prohibition against {{ex post facto}} laws (the plea was entered before the state constitutional amendment was passed). This alternative holding was overruled by Collins v. Youngblood (1990).|$|E
25|$|In his opinion, Justice Harlan concurred {{with the}} Court's initial {{conclusion}} that the Pennsylvania statute did not violate the Establishment Clause or the Equal Protection Clause. However, Justice Harlan dissented from {{the remainder of the}} opinion, arguing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>statute</b> should be held unconstitutional under the Free Exercise Clause. Braunfeld, 366 U.S. at 610-16.|$|E
500|$|On appeal, Aguilar again argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> AUUF <b>statute</b> {{was unconstitutional}} on its face. [...] Aguilar also made <b>the</b> {{argument}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> UPF <b>statute</b> was unconstitutional, since {{at the time}} the Second Amendment was adopted, 16- and 17-year-olds could lawfully bear arms.|$|R
50|$|Nonetheless, Brennan {{points out}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> New York <b>statute</b> has, thus far, proven {{to secure the}} privacy {{interests}} of those patients whose information has been collected. Without an actual showing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>statute’s</b> procedural safeguards have been ineffective in ensuring patients are not deprived of their privacy interests, the state cannot be compelled to show <b>that</b> <b>the</b> collection of the data is absolutely necessary to control illegal drug use.|$|R
5000|$|... 2) The Court further held <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>statute's</b> {{exception}} of lawyers did {{not constitute a}} denial of {{equal protection of the}} laws to nonlawyers. Statutes created many classifications that did not deny equal protection; it was only invidious discrimination <b>that</b> offended <b>the</b> Constitution.|$|R
25|$|Convicted in the Court of Common Pleas of Hamilton County, Brandenburg {{was fined}} $1,000 {{and sentenced to}} one to ten years in prison.

The Supreme Court of Ohio dismissed his appeal without opinion.|$|E
25|$|An 1873 statute punished {{fraud in}} {{connection}} with claims against the United States. In United States v.

500|$|In 2011, two federal {{lawsuits}} {{were filed}} in the Southern District of Illinois and the Central District of Illinois. [...] In both cases, <b>the</b> plaintiffs claimed <b>that</b> AUUF <b>statute</b> violated <b>the</b> Second Amendment in {{that it did not}} allow any method for a citizen to bear arms outside the home. [...] Mary Shepard argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>statutes</b> were facially unconstitutional, while Michael Moore argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>statutes</b> were unconstitutional as applied. [...] In both cases, the judges granted the state's motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, holding <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Second Amendment only protected the right to possess arms in the home. [...] Both Moore and Shepard appealed their cases to the Seventh Circuit, where the cases were consolidated.|$|R

25|$|Harris County District Attorney Rosenthal later {{dismissed}} the Chronicles complaint, finding it without merit {{on the grounds}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>statute</b> did not apply. Rosenthal's involvement in the probe itself came under fire by the Houston Press, which in editorials questioned whether Rosenthal {{was too close to}} TTM: from 2000 to 2004, Rosenthal accepted some $30,000 in donations from known TTM supporters. Later that year, TTM revealed that their television and radio ads were funded by $30,000 in contributions made the day before the election by two PACs controlled by DeLay.|$|E
25|$|The Waite Court heard two {{criminal}} cases under the prerogative writ of mandamus (habeas corpus {{is also a}} prerogative writ). In Virginia v. Rives (1879), the Court used mandamus to order a {{criminal cases}} removed to federal court under the civil rights removal statute to be remanded back to state court, finding <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>statute</b> did not authorize federal jurisdiction because the bar on African-Americans serving on juries was not codified by statute or state constitution. In Ex parte Wall (1883), the Court denied a writ of mandamus, finding that it was proper to remove an attorney who participated in a lynch mob from a case.|$|E
25|$|In United States v. Cruikshank (1875), the Court {{overturned}} {{a conviction}} under {{the civil rights}} crime statute, holding that the First and Second Amendment were not incorporated against {{the states and the}} Fourteenth Amendment only applied to state action. In United States v. Reese (1875), the Court overturned another civil rights conviction for depriving African-Americans of the right to vote, holding <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>statute</b> was void for vagueness as applied to voter suppression. In United States v.

25|$|An 1885 statute {{governing}} appeals {{from the}} territorial court reduced {{the possibility of}} such appeals. In Snow v. United States (1886), the Court rejected a polygamy appeal on the grounds <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>statute</b> granted jurisdiction in criminal appeals only if the validity, existence, or jurisdiction of the territorial courts was called into question. The statute did not preclude jurisdiction to hear appeals from denials of habeas corpus by the territorial courts. In Ex parte Snow (1887), the Court {{for the first time}} granted relief to a polygamy defendant, holding that the crime was a continuing offense, and thus the prosecutor could not increase the number of counts in the indictment by charging the same conduct over different time periods.|$|E

When developing a new charter Archbishop Kirill (Gundyaev) used the achievements of the Cathedral 1917-1918. Was rejected by the charter of 1945.

25|$|The {{parties had}} turned to {{arbitration}} to settle a lingering issue from the termination of a lease: whether Mattel was contractually bound to indemnify Hall Street for environmental contamination {{to the site of}} a factory it rented from Hall Street in Beaverton, Oregon until closing it in 2001. The arbitrator had decided <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>statute</b> covering the groundwater pollution was primarily a health law, and so ruled that Mattel did not have to pay Hall Street's costs. Since the arbitration agreement had taken the form of an order from a district judge, Mattel and Hall Street had included a provision that the judge could review the arbitration award, he did and the award was reversed. It went back and forth twice between the district court and the Ninth Circuit before the Supreme Court granted certiorari.|$|E

50|$|There {{were also}} {{specific}} problems with <b>that</b> action in <b>the</b> instant case.
