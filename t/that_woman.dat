5|$|The Woman's Bible is {{a two-part}} non-fiction book, written by Elizabeth Cady Stanton and a {{committee}} of 26 women, published in 1895 and 1898 to challenge the traditional position of religious orthodoxy <b>that</b> <b>woman</b> should be subservient to man. By producing the book, Stanton wished to promote a radical liberating theology, one that stressed self-development. The book attracted {{a great deal of}} controversy and antagonism at its introduction.|$|E
5|$|Haunted by {{memories}} of the prostitute, Chandru lures two prostitutes to lonely places and murders them as he sees <b>that</b> <b>woman</b> in each of them. Rekha's female friend Pallavi comes to Bangalore to meet her, and telephones her for her residential address. The conversation is overheard by the Madam of a brothel, who misleads Pallavi. Instead of being taken to Rekha's house, Pallavi is taken to the brothel and forced into prostitution. Rekha and Raghunath search for Pallavi. Chandru comes to the same brothel and takes Pallavi in his car, but kills her. Rekha learns of Pallavi's murder through Raghunath; neither Rekha nor Raghunath are aware that Chandru is the murderer.|$|E
5|$|Her {{position}} {{changed the}} following month. She {{had had a}} series of rows with Bamber. He seemed to want to end the relationship, and they had argued about his involvement in the murders. She told him he was a psychopath and at one point tried to smother him with a pillow. During one argument on 4 September, another woman telephoned Bamber in her presence, and it became clear to Mugford that he had been seeing <b>that</b> <b>woman</b> too. Mugford smashed a mirror, slapped Bamber and he twisted her arm up her back. Three days later she went to the police and changed her statement.|$|E
50|$|He has {{declared}} <b>that</b> <b>women</b> have equal status in Islam. Like Zohreh Sefati, he believes <b>that</b> <b>women</b> can even become a marja' in Islam, i.e. <b>that</b> men and <b>women</b> can follow a female Islamic jurists' ijtihad.|$|R
5000|$|Waaafs also {{succeeded in}} making a few old truisms into lies ... It can never be said again <b>that</b> <b>women</b> cannot keep secrets, for in the WAAAF they did {{confidential}} work and kept top secrets. Nor can it be said <b>that</b> <b>women</b> cannot work and live together without squabbling or <b>that</b> <b>women</b> will not take orders from women.|$|R
50|$|The Digambara sect of Jainism {{believes}} <b>that</b> <b>women</b> must be reborn as men {{in order}} to achieve liberation. Digambaras maintain <b>that</b> <b>women</b> cannot take higher vows of ascetic renunciation.|$|R

25|$|There {{may be a}} movie. It's {{something}} that we’ve been talking about and it's {{something that}} America Ferrera would really love to do. <b>That</b> <b>woman</b> has so much determination that I can’t imagine anything she puts her mind to not getting done.|$|E
25|$|Who can be ignorant <b>that</b> <b>woman</b> {{was created}} for man, and not man for woman; and that a husband may be inju'd as insufferably in mariage as a wife. What an injury is it after wedlock not to be belov'd, what to be slighted, what to be contended with a point of house-rule who shall be the head, not for any parity of wisdome, for that were somthing reasonable, but out of female pride.|$|E
30|$|Discussion: Overall {{standard}} of the Hysteroscopy clinic {{is very good}} and comments showed <b>that</b> <b>women</b> were highly satisfied with the care they received. Areas for improvement are: 1. To ensure <b>that</b> <b>women</b> receive written information prior to attendance and are informed by their referrer if an urgent appointment is required. 2. To ensure <b>that</b> <b>women</b> understand explanations regarding findings and follow-up.|$|R
50|$|During the Great Depression, {{there was}} an {{ideology}} <b>that</b> <b>women</b> should work to help contribute to the finances of the family. Bell, however, disagreed with this. She believed <b>that</b> <b>women</b> working were a “mistake in values”, and <b>that</b> <b>women</b> should {{move back to the}} home and work on making a family. She believed women needed to “fulfill their womanly obligations”.|$|R
30|$|Our {{results show}} <b>that</b> <b>women</b> decide {{significantly}} less {{in line with}} a private-sector logic concerning the “market case” and the “allocation case”. This finding fits the assumption of Rubinstein (2006) <b>that</b> <b>women</b> show more compassionate behaviour and are less confident in the market. Our result could provide a further indication <b>that</b> <b>women</b> have stronger values that correspond to social concerns than men (Croson and Gneezy 2009).|$|R
25|$|In fact, barren mothers often {{call upon}} the spirit to cure their affliction. Many traditions hold that Mami Wata herself is barren, so if she gives a woman a child, <b>that</b> <b>woman</b> {{inherently}} becomes more distanced from the spirit's true nature. The woman will thus {{be less likely to}} become wealthy or attractive through her devotion to Mami Wata. Images of women with children often decorate shrines to the spirit.|$|E
25|$|Alternatively, {{people may}} {{themselves}} conclude {{that a given}} self-view is dysfunctional or obsolete and take steps to change it. Consider, for example, a woman who decides that her negative self-views have led her to tolerate abusive relationship partners. When she realizes that such partners are making her miserable, she may seek therapy. In {{the hands of a}} skilled therapist, she may develop more favorable self-views which, in turn, steer her toward more positive relationship partners with whom she may cultivate healthier relationships. Alternatively, when a woman who is uncertain about her negative self-concept enters a relationship with a partner who is certain that she deserves to view herself more positively, <b>that</b> <b>woman</b> will tend to improve the self-concept.|$|E
25|$|The old anti-suffragist {{argument}} that only men could fight a war, and therefore only men deserve {{the right to}} vote, was refuted by the enthusiastic participation {{of tens of thousands}} of American women on the home front in World War I. Across the world, grateful nations gave women the right to vote. Furthermore, most of the Western states had already given the women the right to vote in state and national elections, and the representatives from those states, including the first woman Jeannette Rankin of Montana, demonstrated <b>that</b> <b>woman</b> suffrage was a success. The main resistance came from the south, where white leaders were worried about the threat of black women voting. Congress passed the Nineteenth Amendment in 1919, and women could vote in 1920.|$|E
5000|$|Scientists in {{the field}} {{distinguish}} between emotionality and the expression of emotion: Associate Professor of Psychology Ann Kring said, [...] "It is incorrect to make a blanket statement <b>that</b> <b>women</b> are more emotional than men, it is correct to say <b>that</b> <b>women</b> show their emotions more than men." [...] In two studies by Kring, women {{were found to be}} more facially expressive than men when it came to both positive and negative emotions. These researchers concluded <b>that</b> <b>women</b> and men experience the same amount of emotion, but <b>that</b> <b>women</b> are more likely to express their emotions.|$|R
50|$|Gender essentialism also assumes <b>that</b> <b>women</b> are {{innately}} peaceful, usually due {{to their}} experience as mothers, {{which is one of}} the main reasons that people use to argue for including women in peace processes. Another frequently cited gender essentialist argument is <b>that</b> <b>women</b> are natural coalition builders and are more likely to work with members of other groups. Resolution 1325 incorporates these assumptions and they are frequently cited in the Secretary-General Reports, advocacy movements, and National Action Plans. The result is <b>that</b> <b>women</b> often feel the need to conform to certain stereotypes and <b>that</b> <b>women</b> who do not fit these ideals are marginalized in politics and policy.|$|R
5|$|In August 1843, {{just after}} she turned 25, Stone {{traveled}} by train, steamship, and stagecoach to Oberlin College in Ohio, the country's first college to admit {{both women and}} African Americans. She entered the college believing <b>that</b> <b>women</b> should vote and assume political office, <b>that</b> <b>women</b> should study the classic professions and <b>that</b> <b>women</b> {{should be able to}} speak their minds in a public forum. Oberlin College did not share all of these sentiments.|$|R
25|$|Another Russian journalist, Victoria Ivleva entered Khojaly {{after it}} fell to the Armenian armed forces. She took the {{pictures}} of the streets of the town strewn with dead bodies of its inhabitants, including women and children. In the article that she wrote for a Russian newspaper she described how she saw a large crowd of Meskhetian Turks from Khojaly, who were led to captivity by the Armenian militants. She mentioned that she was hit by an Armenian soldier who took her for one of the captives, when she was helping a woman who was falling behind the crowd with four children, one of which was wounded, and the other one was newly born. The captives were later exchanged or released, and in 2011 Ivleva found in Azerbaijan <b>that</b> <b>woman.</b> Her little child grew up, but did not speak because of the shock she suffered in her childhood.|$|E
500|$|Claire is a {{lobbyist}} who runs an environmental group {{while serving as}} her husband's primary accomplice. After President Garrett Walker (Michel Gill) goes back on his promise to make Frank Secretary of State, Frank enlists Claire {{to help him get}} revenge and propel them both to positions of power. She and Frank scheme nightly over a cigarette, and together they maneuver their way into Walker's inner circle. Frank says of Claire: [...] "I love <b>that</b> <b>woman,</b> I love her more than sharks love blood." ...|$|E
500|$|The secrecy {{surrounding}} the circumstance {{of his death}} caused speculation for several days. At the time, Punch stated that Richmond had been hospitalized due to a motorcycle accident, though {{it is unlikely that}} Richmond had the strength to ride a motorcycle during his last months. Ten days after his death, on August 23, the Richmond family held a press conference to reveal that Richmond died from complications from AIDS, which he acquired from an unknown woman. Richmond's physician, Dr. David Dodson, said: [...] "There's no way of knowing who <b>that</b> <b>woman</b> was. Tim was a celebrity with a lot of charisma, a handsome guy. He naturally attracted a lot of women." [...] Punch later claimed that more than 90 drivers and personnel underwent HIV testing in the wake of Richmond's death.|$|E
50|$|Samajwadi Party Rajya Sabha MP Naresh Agarwal {{sparked a}} {{controversy}} over the brutal Mumbai gang-rape, saying <b>that</b> <b>women</b> needed {{to pay attention to}} their clothes to avoid being raped.

5000|$|In 2015 Nigel Short was criticised {{for saying}} <b>that</b> <b>women</b> had a {{different}} skill set than men, and that men were [...] "hardwired" [...] to be better at chess, although he also stated <b>that</b> <b>women</b> are better in other areas.|$|R
50|$|However {{he states}} <b>that</b> <b>women</b> {{should be able}} to protect {{themselves}} and not make bad choices. For example he says that rape in society has been on the rise but even knowing <b>that</b> <b>women</b> still walk around with short skirts and low cut tops. He implied <b>that</b> he wants <b>women</b> to respect themselves.|$|R
500|$|Christian Louboutin {{said that}} he would {{dedicate}} his time to creating some [...] "scene-stealing designs for the single's video", out of his appreciation for the song. According to Rap-Up, Lopez was scheduled to film the music video for the song in January 2010. She outlined the concept of the video in a radio interview, where she said: [...] "It's gonna be a lot of dancing, I definitely want to do some dancing because it's been a while and I want to do a dance video, and it's going to be really empowering. It's going to be about <b>that</b> <b>woman,</b> you know when you have that moment when you realize you have to really get out of here that's the moment we're trying to cauterize in the video. Even when you know that it's gonna hurt later, you feel good about making the decision, so you're like [...] "I decided! I'm walking up out the house right now" [...] and that's the part we're gonna do in the video except I'm gonna dance my way out the house." ...|$|E
500|$|Jill {{is known}} for her feud with Katherine Chancellor (Jeanne Cooper), which took place over four decades. BuddyTV wrote that, [...] "Nothing spells rivalry like the {{on-going}} feud between Jill Foster Abbott and Katherine Chancellor." [...] In 1993, Katherine {{was diagnosed with breast}} cancer and shared several tender scenes with Jill. Nancy Reichardt of the Los Angeles Times noted that the characters were acting out of character; she wrote: [...] "Katherine's breast cancer scare was touching and seeing Katherine and Jill come together added an intriguing new dimension to their relationship. To confuse us, the show has thrown out this budding friendship as if it never happened. How much more moving it would have been if these two women faced Katherine's request for Jill to name her child Phillip as former adversaries trying to put the past behind them instead of as bitter enemies of days gone by." [...] Of working with Cooper, Walton has stated: [...] "I thank God every day for <b>that</b> <b>woman.</b> She feeds me. She is like a shot in the arm when you see her in the morning. [...] She is funny and sharp and I love her." ...|$|E
500|$|Since her death, McClintock {{has been}} the subject of a {{biography}} by the science historian Nathaniel C. Comfort's The Tangled Field: Barbara McClintock's Search for the Patterns of Genetic Control. Comfort's biography contests some claims about McClintock, described as the [...] "McClintock Myth", which he claims was perpetuated by the earlier biography by Keller. Keller's thesis was that McClintock was long ignored or met with derision because she was a woman working in the sciences. For example, when McClintock presented her findings that the genetics of maize did not conform to Mendelian distributions, geneticist Sewall Wright expressed the belief that she did not understand the underlying mathematics of her work, a belief he had expressed towards other women at the time. In addition, geneticist Lotte Auerbach recounted that Joshua Lederberg returned from a visit to McClintock's lab with the remark: 'By God, <b>that</b> <b>woman</b> is either crazy or a genius.' [...] " [...] As Auerbach tells it, McClintock had thrown Lederberg and his colleagues out after half an hour 'because of their arrogance. She was intolerant of arrogance... She felt she had crossed a desert alone and no one had followed her.'" ...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{evidence}} suggests <b>that</b> <b>women</b> overcome the potential {{negative impact of}} gender stereotypes by emerging when they are stronger candidates than men. I leverage an original survey of state legislative candidates to determine whether women {{devote more time to}} their campaigns. I find <b>that</b> <b>women</b> on the whole, and those who had previously been elected to a political office in particular, invested more of their personal time into the campaign than men. This difference is driven by the fact <b>that</b> <b>women</b> are more likely to forgo employment during the election. These findings suggest <b>that</b> <b>women</b> are {{more likely than men to}} arrange their personal obligations in such a fashion that they can run stronger campaigns...|$|R
5000|$|On 8 January 2014, the Pew Research Center {{conducted}} a survey of Muslim women in various countries. [...] An overwhelming eighty-nine percent of Egyptian women {{who responded to the}} survey believed <b>that</b> <b>women</b> should show their face in public. Ten percent of the survey participants believed <b>that</b> <b>women</b> should be fully veiled when in public. Compared to other countries, Egypt is not as conservative as others, but only fourteen percent of the <b>women</b> surveyed believed <b>that</b> Egyptian <b>women</b> should be able to choose their own clothing. Compared to six other countries, Egypt was last in this category; the statistic (eighty-four percent) suggests <b>that</b> Egyptian <b>women,</b> in general, do not believe <b>that</b> <b>women</b> should have freedom to choose their clothing.|$|R
500|$|With {{regards to}} women, neither Qur'an nor Sunnah {{explicitly}} state <b>that</b> <b>women</b> cannot cut their hair. Hadith does mention <b>that</b> <b>women</b> should not imitate men, and vice versa, and hence many scholars on this assumption, decree <b>that</b> <b>women</b> should let their hair grow {{longer than the}} hair of the Prophet, reaching beyond their shoulders, as hadith mentions that the Prophet had his hair between his shoulder and his earlobes. (He described Jesus's hair, which hung to his earlobes, as long.) ...|$|R
500|$|The jury began {{deliberations}} on November 17, 2010. Scheduled {{proceedings of}} the case met delays because of increased security at the courthouse. After two days of deliberations, all but one juror had voted to convict Guandique. On the third day, the jury asked Judge Gerald Fisher to clarify the definition of assault. Fisher responded that any physical injury could legally be considered an assault, regardless of how small. On November 22, 2010, the jury found Guandique guilty of both remaining counts of first-degree murder. After the trial, a juror said the testimony of Morales was decisive in reaching the verdict. The conviction was called a [...] "miracle" [...] for having been reached with only circumstantial evidence. Gladys Weatherspoon, who had previously represented Guandique in the 2001 assault cases, stated that she was troubled by the jury's verdict: [...] "I just think {{they were going to}} convict anyway.... They felt bad for <b>that</b> <b>woman,</b> the mom. She's sitting in there every day." [...] At a post-trial press conference, Susan Levy said, [...] "There's {{always going to be a}} feeling of sadness. I can surely tell you, it ain't closure." [...] Since the conclusion of the trial, Susan Levy has acted to keep photographic evidence of her daughter's remains sealed from the news media.|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} South African [...] "Freedom Songs" [...] had musical origins in makwaya, or choir music, which {{combined}} elements of Christian hymns with traditional South African musical forms. The songs were often short and repetitive, using a [...] "call-and-response" [...] structure. The music was primarily in indigenous languages such as Xhosa or Zulu, {{as well as}} in English. Melodies used in these songs were often very straightforward. Songs in the movement portrayed basic symbols that were important in South Africa—re-purposing them to represent their message of resistance to apartheid. This trend had begun decades previously when South African jazz musicians had added African elements to jazz music adapted from the United States in the 1940s and 1950s. Voëlvry musicians used rock and roll music to represent traditional Afrikaans songs and symbols. Groups affiliated with the Black Consciousness movement also began incorporating traditional material into their music: the jazz-fusion group Malombo, for example, used traditional rhythms of the Venda people to communicate pride in African culture, often with music that was not explicitly political. While musicians such as Makeba, performing outside South Africa, felt an obligation to write political lyrics, musicians within the country often held that there was no divide between revolutionary music and, for instance, love songs, because the struggle of living a normal life was also a political one. Vusi Mahlasela would write in 1991: [...] "So who are they who say no more love poems now? I want to sing a song of love for <b>that</b> <b>woman</b> who jumped fences pregnant and still gave birth to a healthy child." ...|$|E
500|$|Clive Russell, who portrayed Blackfish, {{spoke about}} working with Gwendoline Christie as Brienne of Tarth, noting [...] "There's {{something}} very curious, by the way, I'm probably about 6'6" [...] tall. I think she's about 6'3", but all the time I worked with her, I {{felt like she was}} taller than me. Now I don't really know what {{that has to do with}} it. It might be something to do with being confronted by a physically charismatic very tall woman, or maybe it's that she's caught the impressiveness of the character of <b>that</b> <b>woman,</b> that soldier. She's also an extraordinarily hilarious woman. We had great fun together. It was great fun to play." [...] Gwendoline Christie also spoke about filming with Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, who portrays Jaime Lannister, again, saying [...] "I was excited, It was really fun to be with Nikolaj again, and I thought the way of which their reunion happens is not really expected. I just loved that it was so formal, because within the confines of such formality, and having to negotiate with each other, there are so many other stories begging to be told in those moments. There's a slow process of creeping familiarity among two people who haven't been together for a long time; it was allowed to build." [...] Coster-Waldau also spoke about their first reunion scene, stating [...] "It's a great scene. These characters are so much about holding their cards so close to their chest and they don't want to reveal how they're feeling. But we know there's history between them, that this is more than two knights meeting. But they would never acknowledge that." ...|$|E
