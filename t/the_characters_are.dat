5|$|In {{this kind}} of system, the {{developers}} set {{the properties of the}} camera, such as its position, orientation or field of view, during the game creation.

While <b>the</b> <b>characters</b> <b>are</b> in 3D, the background on which they evolve has been pre-rendered. The early Resident Evil games are notable examples of games that use fixed cameras. The God of War series of video games is also known for this technique.|$|E

5|$|Most of <b>the</b> <b>characters</b> <b>are</b> {{fully aware}} of Veridian's nature, and often try to {{manipulate}} the system {{in order to stop}} bad things from happening to them (and sometimes to mitigate the evil effects of some of Veridian's projects). They are also all susceptible to the potential rewards the company can offer despite the consequences of their actions, such as the company's attempt to hire Lem's mother, or the company's introduction of scented light bulbs with known flaws. Much of the comedy of the show comes from the characters' navigation of these morally ambiguous areas.|$|E

5|$|The glyphs {{are divided}} into three categories: in{{dependent}}, compound, and dependent (glyphs that only appear in combination with others). He sees other groupings as being arbitrary, as well as detrimental to the proper understanding of rongorongo. Contrary to other scholars who do not place importance on compound glyphs, Dietrich sees compounding as a major aspect of the system. In fact, Dietrich describes rongorongo as a network in which <b>the</b> <b>characters</b> <b>are</b> interwoven together through various combinations. He speculates {{that it was his}} background in graphic design that allowed him to perceive this pattern, while other researchers relied too heavily on linguistics and epigraphy.|$|E
