5|$|In 1966, a {{small change}} {{was made to}} the design to add <b>the</b> <b>initials</b> of the {{designer}} (FS) to the obverse, underneath Jefferson's portrait. In commemoration of that change, two specimen 1966 nickels with <b>the</b> <b>initials</b> were struck and presented to him. Coins struck at any mint between 1965 and 1967 lack mint marks, which were omitted as the Mint replaced the silver circulating coins with copper-nickel. Beginning in 1968, mint marks were again used, and on the nickel were moved to {{the lower part of}} the obverse, to the right of Jefferson's bust. From 1971, no nickels were struck for circulation in San Francisco—the 1971-S was the first nickel struck in proof only since 1878.|$|E

5|$|Cyril McNeile, MC (born Herman Cyril McNeile; 1888–1937) was a British {{soldier and}} author. During the First World War he wrote short stories {{based on his}} {{experiences}} in the trenches with the Royal Engineers.

McNeile also wrote a series of articles titled The Making of an Officer, which appeared under <b>the</b> <b>initials</b> C.N., in five issues of The Times between 8and 14June 1916; these were also subsequently collected together and published. During the course of the war, McNeile wrote more than 80collected and uncollected stories.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{relationship}} between <b>the</b> <b>initial</b> temperature {{dependence of the}} detonation velocity and <b>the</b> <b>initial</b> density is examined using a proposed unified form of the EOS for pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN). First, the derivatives of the variables at Chapman-Jouguet (C-J) points are calculated. These derivatives are used to investigate <b>the</b> <b>initial</b> state dependence of the detonation velocity using the {{relationship between}} the detonation velocity and <b>the</b> <b>initial</b> state variables. As a result, the contributions of the coefficient of thermal expansion and the increment of <b>the</b> <b>initial</b> internal energy to the detonation velocity are clarified. We found that <b>the</b> <b>initial</b> temperature derivative of the detonation velocity can be estimated from <b>the</b> <b>initial</b> density derivative of the detonation velocity...|$|R

5|$|Each {{class of}} cadets elects representatives {{to serve as}} class {{president}} and fill several administrative positions. They also elect a ring and crest committee, which designs the class's crest, the emblem that signifies their class and it is embossed upon their class rings. Each class crest is required to contain <b>the</b> <b>initials</b> USMA and their class motto. The class motto is proposed by the class during cadet basic training and voted on by the class prior {{to the beginning of}} their freshman academic year. Class mottos typically have verbiage that rhymes or is phonetically similar with their class year.|$|E
5|$|The Bolton Wanderers club badge {{consists}} of <b>the</b> <b>initials</b> {{of the club}} {{in the shape of}} a ball, with a red scroll and Lancashire rose underneath. The current badge is a reimagining of one designed in 1975; this was replaced in 2001 by a badge which retained the recognisable initials but controversially exchanged the scroll and rose for blue and red ribbons. The re-design has been welcomed by fans who saw the ribbons as a poor choice. The original club badge was the town crest of Bolton, a key feature of which was the Elephant and Castle motif with the town motto – Supera Moras. This feature has been reincorporated into more recent club shirts.|$|E
5|$|The exact date of {{construction}} is not known, but {{is believed to have}} started in the 15th century and was definitely before 1574, when <b>the</b> <b>initials</b> of the owner George Perceval, the father of Richard Percivale, were added to the chimney piece in the library. One of his descendants Richard Percivale (or Perceval) contributed to the English response to the plans for invasion by the Spanish Armada by deciphering Spanish documents for Queen Elizabeth. Perceval sold the estate to the Bristol merchant and member of parliament Richard Cole in 1582 and it was passed down to his descendants.|$|E

5|$|The new bank used {{different}} names in its three core languages: German, French and English.

The original English name for the combined bank was the Swiss Banking Association, but it was later changed to Union Bank of Switzerland in 1921 to mirror the French form of the name: Union de Banques Suisses. The bank's logo, introduced in 1966, would later reflect both the German SBG and the English and French name UBS.|$|E
5|$|On June2, {{dozens of}} members of the storm chasing and {{spotting}} communities coordinated a tribute to Tim Samaras, Paul Samaras, and Carl Young. Using GPS transponders over Spotter Network, they aligned themselves to spell out <b>the</b> <b>initials</b> of the three men in North Dakota, South Dakota and Nebraska for many hours. The Discovery Channel scheduled a special tribute episode of Storm Chasers titled Mile Wide Tornado: Oklahoma Disaster on June5, both honoring the three chasers and covering the events of the EF5-rated tornado that struck Moore and portions of southern Oklahoma City eleven days earlier on May20. The November 2013 issue of National Geographic, for its featured cover story, paid tribute to Tim Samaras, a National Geographic Explorer funded in part by the Society, and featured a detailed scientific analysis of the tornado itself.|$|E
5|$|The carvings are {{all based}} on popular series of engravings, which were often {{published}} in pattern books. Nuremberg was the origin of numerous such books, and one may {{have been brought to}} Edzell by the miner Hans Ziegler. Specifically, the images of the deities are derived from engravings of 1528–29 by the German artist Georg Pencz (or Iorg Bentz, c. 1500–1550), a pupil of Albrecht Dürer; <b>the</b> <b>initials</b> I. B. appear on the carving of Mars. The arts and virtues are both based on engravings derived from paintings by the Flemish artist Marten de Vos. The engravings, by Jan Sadeler and Crispijn de Passe, were widely distributed in Scotland, along with those of the deities. Indeed, the image of Prudence is identical to that used by the King's Master of Works William Schaw, in the spectacular display to welcome Queen Anne to Scotland, following her marriage to James VI in 1589.|$|E

5|$|The {{gatehouse}} {{was built}} by the Campbells in the late 15th century, replacing an earlier round tower in the east corner. It {{takes the form of}} a four-storey harled tower house, with the entrance passage running through half the vaulted basement, the other half forming guard rooms with arrow slits facing the gate. The present approach to the gate is by a stone stair, replacing an earlier drawbridge. The tower was remodelled in the 18th century to provide reception rooms and a private suite. The dormer windows at the top are capped by the pediments from the 1725 house (see below), and bear the date, the Campbell arms, and <b>the</b> <b>initials</b> AEC and DLC, for Aeneas Campbell, 11th Captain, and his wife Dame Lilias. The pediments were moved here during the 1903 restoration works.|$|E
5|$|A factory was {{established}} {{soon after the}} fort was constructed and it minted coins that bore <b>the</b> <b>initials</b> TB or DB, indicating Dansborg. The fort acted as the important gateway in the trade route from Europe to Coramandel. Protestant missionaries were sent from Denmark by king Fredric IV, who was also the head of Lutheran Church of Denmark. Two of them, namely, Bartholomäus Ziegenbalg and Heinrich Plutschua came to Tranquebar on 9 July 1706, established the Tranquebar Mission, learnt Tamil {{in a few years}} and were the first to translate and print The New Testament of the Bible in Tamil in the printing press inside the fort. The Danish mission was the first Protestant mission in India and from its inception, was staffed by German missionaries trained at Pietist schools and seminary founded by Francke at the end of 17th century. A Tamil-Latin dictionary containing 9000 words was compiled there by a medical missionary named Friedrich Koenig in 1778, whose source letters are stored in the royal archives. The fort is featured in a large number of videos, films and commercials. After India's independence in 1947, the fort was used as an inspection bungalow by the state government till 1978 when the State Department of Archaeology of the Government of Tamil Nadu took over the control of the fort. The fort is now used as a museum, housing a collection of major artifacts of the fort and the Danish empire. The fort {{is one of the most}} visited tourist landmarks in the region.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{the morning}} of November 2, 2002, a female {{employee}} of the Camp Courtney officers' club on Okinawa drove up to the Courtney main gate and reported to base security personnel that a Marine Corps major had just attempted to sexually assault her in her car on a deserted road near the back gate of the base. She identified the Marine as Major Michael Brown and stated that during the assault the major threw her mobile phone into the nearby Tengan River. The woman, later identified with <b>the</b> <b>initials</b> V.N., who was 40 years old, and originally from the Philippines, had lived in Okinawa for 17 years, and was married to a Japanese citizen of Okinawan descent. She reported that she had picked up Brown in her car about 1:30a.m. after the officers' club closed and that he directed her to the deserted road behind the base and after parking, Brown tried to rape her and then threw her mobile phone into the river when she tried to call the police. The Camp Courtney security personnel called the Japanese National Police Agency (NPA). Japanese officers came and took V. N.'s report.|$|E
