5|$|As a rationalist and ardent social reformer, Periyar {{advocated}} forcefully {{throughout his}} life <b>that</b> <b>women</b> should be given their legitimate position in society as the equals of men {{and that they should}} be given good education and have the right to property. He thought age and social customs was not a bar in marrying women. He was keen <b>that</b> <b>women</b> should realise their rights and be worthy citizens of their country.|$|E
5|$|In August 1843, {{just after}} she turned 25, Stone {{traveled}} by train, steamship, and stagecoach to Oberlin College in Ohio, the country's first college to admit {{both women and}} African Americans. She entered the college believing <b>that</b> <b>women</b> should vote and assume political office, <b>that</b> <b>women</b> should study the classic professions and <b>that</b> <b>women</b> {{should be able to}} speak their minds in a public forum. Oberlin College did not share all of these sentiments.|$|E
5|$|There is some {{evidence}} from the Classic period <b>that</b> <b>women</b> provided supporting roles in war, {{but they did not}} act as military officers with the exception of those rare ruling queens. By the Postclassic, the native chronicles suggest <b>that</b> <b>women</b> occasionally fought in battle.|$|E

5|$|In Africa, the HIV/AIDS {{pandemic}} {{has been}} the major cause of falling life expectancy. There is currently a crisis of decreasing number of available care workers for an increasing population requiring care. One reason why this phenomenon occurs is because HIV/AIDS affects working age people the most, {{and there has been}} evidence to show <b>that</b> <b>women</b> are affected at a younger age and in greater numbers. Another reason is due to the influx of HIV/AIDS, government-led health policies are breaking down, increasing the amount of care work and community work <b>that</b> <b>women</b> have to do. Because of the lack of care workers available, the very young and the very old have also started participating in care work, resulting in poorer quality of care.|$|E
5|$|One of Wollstonecraft's central {{arguments}} in the Rights of Woman is <b>that</b> <b>women</b> should be educated in a rational manner {{to give them the}} opportunity to contribute to society. In the 18th century, it was often assumed by both educational philosophers and conduct book writers, who wrote what one might think of as early self-help books, <b>that</b> <b>women</b> were incapable of rational or abstract thought. Women, it was believed, were too susceptible to sensibility and too fragile to be able to think clearly. Wollstonecraft, along with other female reformers such as Catharine Macaulay and Hester Chapone, maintained <b>that</b> <b>women</b> were indeed capable of rational thought and deserved to be educated. She argued this point in her own conduct book, Thoughts on the Education of Daughters (1787), in her children's book, Original Stories from Real Life (1788), {{as well as in the}} Rights of Woman.|$|E

5|$|The early women’s {{movement}} in China focused on eradicating the assumption <b>that</b> <b>women</b> were inferior to men. The early reformers believed <b>that</b> <b>women</b> needed help {{to improve their}} own attitudes about themselves, since even the women generally considered themselves to be inferior to men. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) had shown an early interest in protecting the rights of women. During the 2nd National Congress in 1922, the CCP issued a statement arguing {{for the end of}} Chinese traditions that repress women. The CCP also released a formal letter ensuring equality under the law for both men and women, and guaranteed equal pay for both genders during the 3rd National Congress.|$|E

5|$|Women {{were usually}} {{identified}} as victims during the independence wars since {{the women of}} Latin America were forced to sacrifice for the cause. The ideals of womanhood meant <b>that</b> <b>women</b> must sacrifice what the situation required such as a mother sacrificing her son or a virgin knowing she might be sacrificing motherhood or marriage due {{to the loss of}} many young men. This view meant <b>that</b> <b>women</b> were meant to contribute to independence in a supportive role while leaving the combat and politics {{in the hands of the}} men.|$|E

As an independent woman in the city, Beatrice strives for the balance that Okonkwo lacked so severely. She refutes the notion that she needs a man, and slowly learns about Idemili, a goddess balancing the aggression of male power. Although {{the final stages of}} the novel show her functioning in a nurturing mother-type role, Beatrice remains firm in her conviction <b>that</b> <b>women</b> should not be limited to such capacities.|$|E
5|$|Along with Annie Smith Peck, Workman was {{recognized}} {{during the early}} 20th century {{as one of the}} most famous female climbers in the world.

No other women, however, climbed in the Himalaya until well after World War I, by which time improvements in equipment and organization had shifted that nature of risks and difficulties of expeditions.|$|E
