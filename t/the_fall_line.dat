5|$|<b>The</b> <b>fall</b> <b>line</b> is the geomorphologic {{break between}} the upland region of {{relatively}} hard crystalline basement rock and {{the coastal plain}} of softer sedimentary rock. <b>The</b> <b>fall</b> <b>line</b> is most prominent when crossed by a river. It {{is at this point}} that cities developed, because riverboats could not typically travel any farther inland without portaging. In some locations, the rapid change in elevation of the water, and the resulting energy release, made <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> <b>line</b> a good location for water mills, grist mills, and sawmills. Because of the need for a river port leading to the ocean, and a ready supply of water power, settlements developed where rivers crossed <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> <b>line.</b> In Georgia, <b>the</b> <b>Fall</b> <b>Line</b> extends from Augusta, through Macon, and on to Columbus.|$|E
5|$|In Georgia, it {{is found}} in the {{southern}} half of the state up to a few kilometers north of <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> <b>line</b> with few exceptions. Its range also includes the Ohio River Valley as far north as southern Indiana, and it inhabits many barrier islands off the coasts of the states where {{it is found}}.|$|E
5|$|At {{approximately}} 2:45UTC on July 9, {{the hurricane}} made landfall near McClellanville, South Carolina. Shortly thereafter, Cindy began re-curving northwestward along <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> <b>line,</b> and eventually weakened to a tropical depression. The depression abruptly {{turned toward the}} east-northeast over North Carolina during the afternoon hours of July 9. Cindy then began to accelerate as it curved slightly towards the northeast, and eventually regained tropical storm status late on July 10 as it emerged into the Atlantic. Cindy scraped the southern fringe of the Delmarva Peninsula {{near the mouth of}} the Chesapeake Bay at approximately 00:00UTC on July 11, and rapidly traveled northeastward during the day. Cindy passed over Cape Cod near the mid-morning of July 11, during which a series of shortwave troughs passed near the storm, producing high-level outflow that helped Cindy maintain intensity. Later on July 11, Cindy moved ashore in New Brunswick and made landfall over Prince Edward Island the following day. The storm subsequently moved over Quebec and Labrador, where it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Cindy {{impacted}} the Carolinas, the Mid-Atlantic states, New England, and the Canadian Maritime Provinces {{during the}} 1959 Atlantic hurricane season. The third storm of the season, Cindy originated from a low-pressure area {{associated with a}} cold front located east of northern Florida. The low developed into a tropical depression on July 5 while tracking north-northeastward, and became Tropical Storm Cindy by the next day. Cindy turned westward because of a high-pressure area positioned to its north, and further intensified into a weak hurricane {{off the coast of}} the Carolinas on July 8. Early on July 9, Cindy made landfall near McClellanville, South Carolina, and re-curved to the northeast along <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> <b>line</b> as a tropical depression. It re-entered the Atlantic on July 10, quickly restrengthening into a tropical storm while it began to move faster. On July 11, Cindy passed over Cape Cod, while several other weather systems helped the storm maintain its intensity. Cindy transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on July 12 as it neared the Canadian Maritime Provinces.|$|E
25|$|Like {{many other}} {{significant}} early settlements in colonial America, Columbia is on <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> <b>line</b> from the Piedmont region. <b>The</b> <b>fall</b> <b>line</b> is {{the spot where}} a river becomes unnavigable when sailing upstream and where falling water downstream cannot power a mill.|$|E
25|$|The Upstate region {{contains}} {{the roots of}} an ancient, eroded mountain chain. It is generally hilly, with thin, stony clay soils, and contains few areas suitable for farming. Much of the Piedmont was once farmed. Due to the changing economics of farming, much {{of the land is}} now reforested in Loblolly pine for the lumber industry. These forests are part of the Southeastern mixed forests ecoregion. At the southeastern edge of the Piedmont is <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> <b>line,</b> where rivers drop to the coastal plain. <b>The</b> <b>fall</b> <b>line</b> was an important early source of water power. Mills built to harness this resource encouraged the growth of several cities, including the capital, Columbia. The larger rivers are navigable up to <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> <b>line,</b> providing a trade route for mill towns.|$|E

25|$|Skiers use {{outriggers}} {{for balance}} and as leverage when they fall to right themselves. Outriggers {{are also used}} for turning; skiers use the outrigger and their upper body by leaning into the direction they want to turn. In para-Nordic skiing, outriggers or ski poles are used to propel the skier forward. If skiers fall, they may require assistance in righting themselves, and/or getting back to <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> <b>line.</b> Doing this on their own, they need to position their mono-ski facing uphill relative to <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E
25|$|Columbus {{is one of}} Georgia's three Fall Line Cities, {{along with}} Augusta and Macon. <b>The</b> <b>fall</b> <b>line</b> is where the hilly lands of the Piedmont plateau meet the flat terrain of the coastal plain. As such, Columbus has a varied {{landscape}} of rolling hills {{on the north side}} and flat plains on the south. <b>The</b> <b>fall</b> <b>line</b> causes rivers in the area to decline rapidly towards sea level. Textile mills were established here in the 19th and early 20th centuries {{to take advantage of the}} water power from the falls. Columbus was developed along the Chattahoochee River.|$|E

25|$|Around {{the year}} 1670, Seneca warriors from the New York Iroquois Confederacy conquered the {{territory}} of the Manahoac of Northern Piedmont. That year the Virginia Colony had expelled the Doeg from Northern Virginia east of <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> <b>line.</b> With the Seneca action, the Virginia Colony became de facto neighbours of part of the Iroquois Five Nations. Although the Iroquois never settled the Piedmont area, they entered it for hunting and raiding against other tribes. The first treaties conducted at Albany between the two powers in 1674 and 1684 formally recognized the Iroquois claim to Virginia above <b>the</b> <b>Fall</b> <b>Line,</b> which they had conquered from the Siouan peoples. At the same time, from 1671 to 1685, the Cherokee seized what are now the westernmost regions of Virginia from the Xualae.|$|E
