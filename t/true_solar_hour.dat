50|$|A moment (momentum) was {{a medieval}} unit of time. The {{movement}} of a shadow on a sundial covered 40 moments in a <b>solar</b> <b>hour.</b> An hour {{in this case}} means one twelfth of the period between sunrise and sunset.

A day was divided into 24 hours of both equal and unequal lengths, the former being called natural or equinoctial, and the latter artificial. The hour was divided into four puncta (quarter-hours), ten minuta, or 40 momenta.|$|R
