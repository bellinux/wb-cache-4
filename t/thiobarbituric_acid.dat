40|$|Pre-eclampsia is {{characterized}} by increased lipid peroxidation and diminished antioxidant capacity.

The study was conducted at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Clinical Centre of Vojvodina. The study included 57 singleton pregnancies, gestation > 24 weeks, of which 29 were healthy pregnancies and 28 were with pre-eclampsia, defined as systolic arterial pressure of > 90 mmHg, diastolic of > 145 mmHg, and 24 h proteinuria of > 300 mg. <b>Thiobarbituric</b> <b>acid</b> reactive substances concentrations evaluated by malondialdehyde equivalent standards (OxiSelect™ TBARS Assay Kit (malondialdehyde Quantitation), Cell Biolabs’ OxiSelect™) showed that oxidative stress was more evident in the group with pre-eclampsia, though not statistically significant (p= 0. 107).

40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{temporal}} patterns of (the formation of) <b>thiobarbituric</b> <b>acid</b> reactive substances and the activities of antioxidant enzymes in the erythrocytes of ten healthy adult subjects and ten oral cancer patients of comparable age.

This report verified in chronically stable medicated schizophrenic patients whether there are correlations between the serum levels of superoxide dismutase, a key enzyme in the antioxidant defense, <b>thiobarbituric</b> <b>acid</b> reactive substances, a direct index of lipid peroxidation, and {{brain-derived neurotrophic factor}}, the most widely distributed neurotrophin.

40|$|The {{specificity}} of an iodometric assay for measuring lipid peroxides in lipoproteins was tested, {{compared with the}} fluorimetric <b>thiobarbituric</b> <b>acid</b> assay, and adopted for detecting lipid peroxide in plasma samples. Oxidation of low density lipoproteins in vitro by Cu 2 +, lipoxidase, and phagocytosing polymorphonuclear leucocytes was sensitively detected by the iodometric assay. Unlike the <b>thiobarbituric</b> <b>acid</b> assay, neither non-lipid substances commonly present in plasma, nor platelet or polymorphonuclear leucocyte by-products interfered with the iodometric assay. The iodometric assay measured a normal mean (SD) plasma lipid peroxide concentration of 10. 8 (2. 1) microM; n = 63.

40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To {{evaluate}} {{an increase}} in plasma concentration of <b>thiobarbituric</b> <b>acid</b> reactive substances as a non-invasive biochemical test of reperfusion after thrombolysis and to investigate {{the relation between the}} inflammatory response after acute myocardial infarction and the production of the substances. METHODS [...] Venous samples were taken from 19 patients receiving thrombolysis for acute myocardial infarction before the start of therapy and every hour afterwards up to 5 hours and then at 24 and 48 hours and the concentration of <b>thiobarbituric</b> <b>acid</b> reactive substances measured. These substances are markers of lipid peroxidation induced by free oxygen radicals. Early reperfusion was judged by regression of ST elevation and late coronary artery patency from the results of coronary angiography 24 - 72 hours after thrombolysis. RESULTS [...] The concentration of <b>thiobarbituric</b> <b>acid</b> reactive substances increased in only 6 out of 14 patients with signs of early reperfusion. In patients with late coronary artery patency the corresponding number was 6 out of 15. However, {{a significant increase in the}} concentration of <b>thiobarbituric</b> <b>acid</b> reactive substances was found for the whole group 24 and 48 hours after treatment. The change in concentration in serum correlated significantly with that of C reactive protein [...] an acute phase reactant (r = 0. 62, P < 0. 01) [...] but not to the serum activities of markers of infarct size such as creatine kinase B and lactate dehydrogenase. CONCLUSIONS [...] The fluorimetric assay used in this study to measure the concentration of <b>thiobarbituric</b> <b>acid</b> reactive substances seems to be an insensitive method of detecting reperfusion after thrombolysis for myocardial infarction. The increase in concentrations found 24 and 48 hours after treatment correlated with C reactive protein concentrations but not with those of markers of infarct size...|$|E
