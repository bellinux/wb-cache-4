On the feasibility analysis of transportation project, either economical and financeal analysis, one of the data needed is Vehicle Cost Analysis (VCA) which passes the roads. However the study of VCA motor cycles is rarely done. The purposes of this research are to identify {{the factors that influence}} VCA, to analysis VCA and to find out the suitable VCA model in Semarang area. In collecting the data, quisionaires are distributed to the motor cycle drivers, such as: students colleges, lectures, employees of college around Tembalang campus, and also the people of Banyumanik region. The questions are : the type, the capacity and the year of motor cycle assembling, the amount of journey per week, oil consumption, frequency of service, tube and <b>tyre</b> <b>changing,</b> motor cycle is price, the speed average of motor cycle journey, over head cost per month,and spareparts per year. The data is compiled and analyses including two means for the influence factors of VCA and the regression model of the factors that influence the journey. The research concludes that VCA consists of fixed costs (price, tax, re-sale cost) and variable cost (fuel, service, oil, tube and tyre, overhead cost, and spare parts cost). The variable cost of motor cycle inverses to the year of its assembling, it means that the newer the motor cycle, the lower the variable cost.

This paper elaborates virtual {{methods used to}} as tool for safety and ergonomic evaluations of in wheel design using Switch Reluctance Motor (SRM). In our recent research, a unique design of in wheel design using SRM has been developed. Special advantages of this design include modularity, scalability, cost effectiveness, and easy installation.

In the proposed passenger car, if work is carried out for maintenance issues, generally single operator (mechanic) dose <b>tyre</b> <b>changing</b> or wheel/brake servicing. Two validations are important, mainly safety of the operator; secondly design for assembly of motor, and tyre rims. As a part of this research, Virtual Reality (VR) based safety and ergonomic evaluation studies have been conducted for the in wheel design adaptations. The computational models and virtual modelling simulations using motion capture, Arena and EON reality mimicked live system environments, so as to validate effectiveness motor assembly and disassembly functionality using human as an interface. Initial phase consists of schematic representations of models to evaluate conceptualisation for different designs. Based on schematics, SR motor and rim tyre models were developed and interfaced in VR environment. In second phase, vehicle topology was reverse engineered using hand held 3 D scanner and converted to metafile for full scale model development. In third phase, motion capture was used with 20 camera systems to video record the existing human movements and rigid body such as tyre to develop live environment. Finally all three phases were interfaced together in VR environment to evaluate assembly and disassembly functions. Based on the validation of these, designs were fine tuned for effective assembly functionality. The VR based safety and ergonomic evaluation procedures were used for demonstration of wheel assembly disassembly functions by single operator. Similar context can be extended to other automotive design evaluations, without substantial prototype costs for safety and ergonomic evaluations...|$|E

40|$|A set of scaling factors {{has been}} {{introduced}} by Pacejka [Pacejka, H. B., 2002, Tyre and Vehicle Dynamics (Oxford: Butterworth Heinemann Editions) ] into his Magic Formula tyre model {{to take into account}} the influence of a number of external overall parameters such as road roughness, weather conditions, suspension characteristics and so on. These scaling factors are important for a correct prediction of tyre–road contact forces, but are not a function of the <b>tyre</b> itself. <b>Changing</b> the point of view, one could say that scaling factors should remain constant for different tyres on the same circuit, with the same weather conditions and with the same car. After characterizing different tyres through indoor tests (that do not consider external overall parameters) and after having identified Pacejka’s coefficients with scaling factors equal to one, several outdoor experimental tests have been carried out to assess the influence of vehicle and road surface conditions on scaling factors. These experimental data allowed us to identify, through a minimization approach, the ‘best’ set of Pacejka’s scaling factors for that vehicle and for that tyre on that track. Scaling factors for equal track and vehicle but different tyres were compared to check whether their values remained constant. To access the validity of scaling factors, a comparison between experimental data, collected on an instrumented passenger car, and MB simulations considering unity and identified scaling factors’ values, were carried out. All experimental data shown in this article come from tests carried out within the VERTEC project, a European founded research project (Task 2. a and 2. b) that puts together knowledge coming from vehicle manufacturers (Volvo, Porsche and Centro Ricerche Fiat CRF), tyre manufacturers (Pirelli and Nokian Tyres), control logic manufacturers (Lucas Varity GmbH), road maintenance experts (Centres d’Études Techniques de l’Équipement CETE), transport research organizations (Transport Research Laboratory TRL, Swedish National Road and Transport Research Institute VTI) and universities (Helsinki University of Technology HUT, Politecnico di Milano and University of Florence UNIFI) ...|$|R
40|$|Current {{and future}} {{requirements}} for efficiency force {{the automotive industry}} to consider all aspects of reducing the energy consumption of road going vehicles. An important aspect of reducing fuel consumption is reduced aerodynamic drag, which at highway cruising speeds is dominating the total drag force for both cars and heavy goods vehicles. Furthermore, on a modern car, up to 25 percent of the aerodynamic drag originates from the wheels and wheel housings, making them important aerodynamic components. This thesis investigates the aerodynamic effects of wheels and tyres further, with focus on reducing aerodynamic drag. Both experimental and numerical tools were used {{in order to increase}} the understanding of how the wheels interact with the surrounding flow field regions, and how such interactions are affected by wheel design. Experiments were performed in the Volvo Aerodynamic Wind Tunnel and RANS and U-RANS were used in the numerical investigations. With regards to CFD, the performance of MRF for modelling wheel rotation was investigated in detail, and compared with both experimental data and sliding mesh simulations for some configurations. The steady state RANS approach using MRF was found to correlate well with experiments for several configurations, {{but in the case of}} highly closed front wheels, large discrepancies were identified. Using sliding mesh showed a potential for improved predictions of wake structures compared with experiments, but further investigations of numerical methods, suitable for modelling wheel aerodynamics in a reliable way, was recommended. Several experimental investigations on wheel design resulted in an increased understanding of important wheel design parameters, and their effect on both drag and local flow field. Radial wheel covers was found to be one of the most efficient means of reducing the drag contributions from the wheels. The effect of tyre model was found to be of equal importance as the wheel design. Despite identical size definitions, the tyre geometries were found noticeably different, giving several possible reasons for the differences in drag. Furthermore, effects on drag due to the <b>tyre</b> geometry <b>changing</b> with velocity were also investigated...|$|R
50|$|Where it is permitted, {{refuelling}} {{is often}} an important purpose of a pit stop. Carrying fuel slows down a vehicle and {{there is often a}} limit {{on the size of the}} fuel tank, so many races require multiple stops for fuel to complete the race distance in the minimum time. <b>Changing</b> <b>tyres</b> is also common to permit the use of softer tyres that wear faster but provide more grip, to use tyres suitable for wet conditions, or to use a range of tyres designated by the rules. Teams will aim for each of their vehicles to pit following a planned schedule, with the number of stops determined by many factors such as fuel capacity, tyre lifespan, and the trade-off between time lost in the pits versus time gained on the track due to the benefits of pit stops. Choosing the optimum pit strategy of how many stops to make and when to make them is crucial in having a successful race. It is also important for teams to take competitors' strategies into account when planning pit stops to avoid being held up behind a competitor where overtaking is difficult or risky. An unscheduled or extended stop, such as for a repair, can be very costly for a driver's chance of success, because while they are stopped for service, competitors remaining on the track are gaining time on them. For this reason, the pit crew often undergo intensive training to perform operations such as tyre changes as quickly as possible leading to pit stops, for example in Formula 1, where the car is only stationary for a few seconds for a regular pit stop.|$|R

He also addressed several solutions which had been proposed by the teams, insisting that use of the new specification tyres flown in overnight would be [...] "a breach of the rules to be considered by the stewards", and the placement of a chicane in the turn was [...] "out of the question" [...] - the race would not be sanctioned by the FIA (making it a non-championship race) if the track layout was changed.

50|$|After Ford {{acquired}} Cosworth in July 1998, they risked {{designing and}} building a brand-new engine for 1999. The SF3 was quick out of the box, however for Ford both cars over-heated on the grid of the first race, the Australian Grand Prix, after qualifying competitively. This put Herbert out instantly and made Barrichello start from the pit lane. Barrichello received a stop-go penalty during the race and finished 5th. The car was consistently competitive throughout the season, however the engine initially proved fragile as both cars blew their engines at the Brazilian race which meant the engine was rarely run at full power. Stewart's competitiveness was affirmed by running first in Brazil for a long spell of the race and qualifying on pole for the French Grand Prix with Barrichello. Johnny Herbert won a popular victory at the rain soaked 1999 European Grand Prix at the new Nürburgring after other leading contenders crashed off the track or lost time in the pits <b>changing</b> <b>tyres.</b> Barrichello finished third, in a result most observers indicated that Stewart deserved given their strength over the season. Johnny Herbert also became unwittingly influential in the championship at the next and penultimate race, the Malaysian Grand Prix. Running 3rd behind the Ferraris of Michael Schumacher and Eddie Irvine, a mistake in the closing laps allowed Mika Häkkinen to slip past and claim the final podium position which gave the championship contender vital points. The Ferraris were disqualified for car irregularities and the win allowed Häkkinen to gain his second championship. The Stewarts as a result finished 2nd and 3rd in the race. However Ferrari won an appeal and the initial result was reinstated. Häkkinen however {{went on to win}} the championship and Stewart came 4th in the Constructors Championship beating teams such as Williams and Benetton.

40|$|This study aims {{to predict}} the Dynamic Load Coefficient (DLC) of tyre forces from truck axles. Dynamic Load Coefficient is {{frequently}} used to characterise the dynamic loads generated by axles. It is a simple measurement of the dynamic variation magnitude of the axle load, for a specific combination of road roughness and speed. Under normal operating conditions, the DLC's value is typically {{in the range of}} 0. 05 - 0. 3, and close to zero when the truck's wheels are moving over a perfectly smooth road. To achieve the objectives of this study, which is to determine the DLC's value for seven different types of axles, a simple validated quarter-truck model was excited by a random road surface profile, in order to simulate a vehicle-road interaction. Points are equally spaced along the simulated road to generate dynamic loadings over a broad range of truck speeds. Multiple trucks gross-weight conditions were used to present realistic traffic behaviour. The results showed that irregular road profiles, exciting the vehicle as it travelled, caused continually <b>changing</b> <b>tyre</b> forces. Also, dynamic loading was seen to be fundamentally influenced by the type of suspension (i. e., air and steel), loading condition, and vehicle speed. For example, the DLC value of the tyre forces of the quarter-truck fitted with a steel suspension was found to be more than twice that of the truck fitted with an air suspension. Tyre forces of the one-third laden truck were more aggressive than any other loading condition, due to the uncertain body-bounce generated by the truck, which was strongly dependent on surface irregularities. At low speed, the DLC was greatly decreased if the load was increased. Furthermore, DLC value was always lower for trucks with air suspension over steel suspension, for the same load and vehicle speed. However, air suspension efficiency was clearly better for higher axle loads...|$|R
40|$|Improving fuel {{efficiency}} {{is one of}} the core targets when minimizing the transport cost of a vehicle combination. Hence, it is crucial to optimize the design and selection of all vehicle components, including tyres. Volvo Group Trucks Technology (GTT) and Chalmers University of Technology run a common research project TyreOpt—Fuel consumption reduction by tyre drag optimization. This master thesis is supporting the TyreOpt research project by verification of a computationally efficient model for an evaluation of the operating costs by a newly developed joint model of the vehicle, environment, and tyres, which is based on one of the existing tools within Volvo GTT. Selection of the proper Volvo GTT analysis tool, which serves as a base for the newly developed joint model, was supported by Volvo experts’ experience. Theory of tyre was reviewed in order to support modelling of the transientlinear tyre model and implementation of the rolling resistance model, which was developed within the TyreOpt research project. Representation of the computationally efficient model of the operational cycle and all relevant parameters was transformed to the newly developed model. Simple driver and power-train models were developed in order to evaluate vehicle performance for selected operational environments. Feasability of constraining events implementation to the high-fidelity model is discussed and candidates for new constraints are proposed. Verification of the computationally efficient model concludes performance and limitations of this computationally efficient model, developed within the TyreOpt research project. The tyre model is parameterised in tyre design parameters, such as tyre width, radius and pressure. The computationally efficient and the newly developed model are investigated in qualitative manner in order to list differences in behaviour under various specification parameters of the vehicle, the tyres and the operating environment. Improvements of the computationally efficient model are proposed. Sensitivity analysis aims to investigate energetic behaviour of both models with respect to <b>changing</b> <b>tyre</b> design variables. Results proved considerable influence of different fidelity of the model on transport costs, mainly due to inverse kinematic principle of computationally efficient model, which can not cope with velocity transients and different control strategies. Trends of the energy consumption for different tyre design variables are compared with the rolling resistance theory, which was summarized in the literature review...|$|R
