50|$|Willy {{takes his}} Mance's ex-boss's son, Tommy Boatwright (played by Alex Pederson), {{with him to}} the water hole in order to set up bait for <b>the</b> <b>monster.</b> Tommy falls in and <b>the</b> <b>monster</b> <b>eats</b> <b>him.</b> <b>The</b> police suspect foul play from Mance on account of him being fired.

An old saying claims {{that it was so}} large that it fed on seven whales: Local folklores say this huge animal can {{disguise}} himself as a small, silver fish when fisherman come in contact with it.

60|$|But {{they need}} {{never have been}} afraid of the Griffin. The autumnal equinox day came round, and <b>the</b> <b>monster</b> <b>ate</b> nothing. If {{he could not have}} the Minor Canon, he did not care for any thing. So, lying down, with his eyes fixed upon the great stone griffin, he {{gradually}} declined, and died. It was a good thing for some {{of the people of the}} town that they did not know this.|$|R

50|$|While {{using the}} same {{character}} as Felix in the Factory, the gameplay bears no relation to that platformer, instead taking {{the form of a}} maze game. The game is set out like a typical Pac-Man clone but plays very differently. The maze design is very similar with <b>the</b> four <b>monsters</b> emerging from a central cave and four power cells in the corners but there are no dots in the maze. There are pieces of fruit that float freely around the maze (except for the first level on the BBC Micro version where the fruit is static). The object of the game is to stop <b>the</b> <b>monsters</b> <b>eating</b> all of <b>the</b> fruit until the timer (shown as a bar {{at the top of the}} screen) runs out.|$|R

This fails, however, as <b>the</b> <b>monster</b> doesn't <b>eat</b> children, and just dumps them in the trash whenever Xykon's attention is focused elsewhere. <b>The</b> <b>monster</b> and O-Chul have come to regard each other as friends, {{going so far as to}} have O-Chul refer to it as Monster-san, since <b>the</b> <b>monster</b> does not know its own name.|$|R

500|$|<b>The</b> Gila <b>monster</b> <b>eats</b> small birds, mammals, frogs, lizards, insects, and carrion. <b>The</b> Gila <b>monster</b> feeds {{primarily}} on bird and reptile eggs, and eats infrequently (only {{five to ten}} times {{a year in the}} wild), but when it does feed, it may eat up to one-third of its body mass. It uses its extremely acute sense of smell to locate prey, especially eggs. Its sense of smell is so keen, it can locate and dig up chicken eggs buried [...] deep and accurately follow a trail made by rolling an egg.|$|R

25|$|<b>Monster</b> <b>Eats</b> Machine (October 8, 1967) – A {{prototype}} {{version of}} Cookie Monster (performed by Jim Henson) finds a talking machine (voiced by Jim Henson) and eats {{it while it}} explains its various parts. After <b>the</b> <b>monster</b> is done <b>eating</b> <b>the</b> machine, its voice is heard from within <b>the</b> <b>monster</b> as it states that nothing can stop it from performing its function {{which is to be}} the most powerful exploding device known to man.

In [...] "Eye of the Sea", he {{lost his}} nose during the battle against the Draken (a one-eyed sea monster which is {{a cross between a}} dragon and a kraken) over 20 years ago. Squint's vengeful pursuit of the Draken is remininscent of Captain Ahab in Moby Dick (his name is a {{reference}} to the Moby Dick story in that its first line is [...] "Call me Ishmael"). <b>The</b> <b>monster</b> <b>ate</b> Squint alive before Alan stabbed it in the eye, killing it. In [...] "Return of Squint", Captain Squint later came back alive with two new shipmates.

50|$|<b>The</b> lava <b>monsters</b> {{are really}} rock monsters that were heated up badly when <b>the</b> <b>monster</b> race was beginning. A Sulfurix was heated in the magma {{chambers}} to create Combustix. Later, a Firax was created when a Firox fell in boiling lava. The same happened to Meltrox to create Infernox. <b>The</b> Lava <b>Monsters</b> then <b>ate</b> lava crystals {{that were made}} of lava and kinetic energy trapped in igneous rock formation. <b>The</b> <b>monsters</b> were made of the same material. Just like their cousins, <b>the</b> <b>monsters</b> release a form of energy once eating a crystal, in ways involving lava and volcanic eruption. A Firax once later grew in size to the powerful Eruptorr, who ruled <b>the</b> <b>monsters.</b> <b>The</b> Lava <b>Monsters</b> hate their Rock Monster cousins and wish {{to take over the}} LEGO world before them.|$|R

It is up to Cassie and Sean (Cody Linley), a popular boy who Cassie likes, to save them. At first, they try to defeat The Evil Thing on their own, but fail. Cassie then asks {{the owner of the}} shop, where she bought the book, for help. Cassie discovers that the store owner travels around the world each Halloween, searching for a person who loves to scare people the most and tricks them into reading the book aloud, releasing The Evil Thing, possibly in order to teach them a lesson. He leaves them with the riddle [...] "two heads are better than one; that's the way to get the bloody job done" [...] before his shop disappears. After he disappears, Sean solves the riddle. Together, they formulate that if they get blood from a roast that Cassie's mother made and throw it onto The Evil Thing, it will be forced to suck up the blood. In doing so, it will devour itself. [...] While they plan their attack, The Evil Thing's babies hatch and tries to eat the victims. Luckily, Sean and Cassie make it in time. By using Sean's CD of monster sound effects, they are able to lure <b>the</b> <b>monster</b> to <b>the</b> CD player; however, when <b>the</b> <b>monster</b> nudges it, <b>the</b> music turns into hip hop, thus ruining their plan. While fumbling, Sean and Cassie accidentally drop the blood near Max, who must conquer his fears.

O-Chul is horrified at the prospect that Tsukiko <b>eats</b> babies, but <b>the</b> <b>monster</b> denies this, saying the only reason she can't be a member is because girls can't join the club.|$|R
