5|$|All ballots, {{absentee}} ballot envelopes, and voting machines were impounded under a court injunction sought by state Republicans. Under <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>order,</b> {{absentee ballot}}s were counted in central locations rather than individual precincts. Of the 10,000 absentee ballots {{sent out to}} voters, 6,000 were returned. Absentee ballots mailed within the United States had to be received by April 7 to be counted. The deadline for overseas (including military) ballots was extended to April 13 after the United States Department of Justice sued the state to ensure {{they would have a}} reasonable chance of being counted. Counting of the absentee ballots due by April 7 began on April 8 under a New York State Supreme Court ruling sought by Murphy's campaign.|$|E

The decision came as a surprise to many, and Odex quickly announced its intent to appeal. Although Lau denied Odex <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>order,</b> he warned that the right to privacy was no defence for copyright infringement.|$|E
