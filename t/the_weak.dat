5|$|In {{particle}} physics, <b>the</b> <b>weak</b> interaction (<b>the</b> <b>weak</b> {{force or}} weak nuclear force) is {{the mechanism of}} interaction between sub-atomic particles that causes radioactive decay and thus plays {{an essential role in}} nuclear fission. The theory of <b>the</b> <b>weak</b> interaction is sometimes called quantum flavourdynamics (QFD), in analogy with the terms quantum chromodynamics (QCD) dealing with the strong interaction and quantum electrodynamics (QED) dealing with the electromagnetic force. However, the term QFD is rarely used because <b>the</b> <b>weak</b> force is best understood in terms of electro-weak theory (EWT).|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>weak</b> {{interaction}} affects all the fermions of the Standard Model, {{as well as}} the Higgs boson; neutrinos interact through {{gravity and}} <b>the</b> <b>weak</b> interaction only, and neutrinos were the original reason for the name weak force. <b>The</b> <b>weak</b> interaction does not produce bound states (nor does it involve binding energy) – something that gravity does on an astronomical scale, that the electromagnetic force does at the atomic level, and that the strong nuclear force does inside nuclei.|$|E

50|$|An {{important}} {{variant of}} <b>the</b> <b>weakest</b> precondition is <b>the</b> <b>weakest</b> liberal precondition , which yields <b>the</b> <b>weakest</b> condition under which S either does not terminate or establishes R. It therefore differs from wp in not guaranteeing termination. Hence it corresponds to Hoare logic in partial correctness: for the statement language given above, wlp differs with wp only on while-loop, in not requiring a variant (see above).|$|R

5|$|Although <b>the</b> <b>weak</b> {{interaction}} was once described by Fermi's theory, {{the discovery of}} parity violation and renormalization theory suggested that a new approach was needed. In 1957, Robert Marshak and George Sudarshan and, somewhat later, Richard Feynman and Murray Gell-Mann proposed a V−A (vector minus axial vector or left-handed) Lagrangian for weak interactions. In this theory, <b>the</b> <b>weak</b> interaction acts only on left-handed particles (and right-handed antiparticles). Since the mirror reflection of a left-handed particle is right-handed, this explains the maximal violation of parity. Interestingly, the V−A theory was developed before {{the discovery of the}} Z boson, so it did not include the right-handed fields that enter in the neutral current interaction.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the large}} masses of the W bosons, {{particle}} transformations or decays (e.g., flavour change) that depend on <b>the</b> <b>weak</b> interaction typically occur much more slowly than transformations or decays that depend only on the strong or electromagnetic forces. For example, a neutral pion decays electromagnetically, and so has a life of only about 10−16seconds. In contrast, a charged pion can only decay through <b>the</b> <b>weak</b> interaction, and so lives about 10−8seconds, or a hundred million times longer than a neutral pion. A particularly extreme example is the weak-force decay of a free neutron, which takes about 15minutes.|$|E

5|$|In 1933, Enrico Fermi {{proposed}} the first theory of <b>the</b> <b>weak</b> interaction, known as Fermi's interaction. He suggested that beta decay {{could be explained}} by a four-fermion interaction, involving a contact force with no range.|$|E
5|$|In an aerotow a powered {{aircraft}} {{is attached}} to a glider with a tow rope. Single-engined light aircraft or motor gliders are commonly used. The tow-plane takes the glider to the height and location requested by the pilot where the glider pilot releases the tow-rope. A weak link is often fitted to the rope to ensure that any sudden loads do not damage the airframe of the tow-plane or the glider. Under extreme loads <b>the</b> <b>weak</b> link will fail before any part of the glider or plane fails. There is a remote chance that <b>the</b> <b>weak</b> link might break at low altitude, and so pilots plan for this eventuality before launching.|$|E

40|$|Professor O’Kelley {{comments}} on a familiar {{problem in the}} law of closely held business associations - the alleged exploitation of weaker or minority investors by stronger or majority participants. The fact pattern is simple. At {{the outset of the}} cooperative venture, a stronger participant assumes the role of proprietor, partner, or majority shareholder, while <b>the</b> <b>weaker</b> participant assumes <b>the</b> role of agent, partner, or minority shareholder. For whatever reason, the venturers do not explicitly guarantee or protect <b>the</b> <b>weaker</b> participant’s right to income or continued participation in the venture. Consequently, at some later date the stronger participant reduces or eliminates <b>the</b> <b>weaker</b> investor’s participation in or return from the cooperative venture. <b>The</b> <b>weaker</b> investor then seeks equitable relief, claiming that the stronger venturer’s actions violate the implied fiduciary duties owed to <b>the</b> <b>weaker</b> participant. This comment explores how efficiency minded judges should apply the Cosean Contract Theory, and, thus, some light on the theory itself...|$|R
5|$|In {{the case}} of <b>the</b> <b>weak</b> interaction, fermions can {{exchange}} three distinct types of force carriers known as the W+, W−, and Z bosons. The mass {{of each of these}} bosons is far greater than the mass of a proton or neutron, which is consistent with the short range of <b>the</b> <b>weak</b> force. The force is in fact termed weak because its field strength over a given distance is typically several orders of magnitude less than that of the strong nuclear force or electromagnetic force.|$|E

5|$|Lee and Yang's {{research}} into existing experimental results convinced them that parity was conserved for electromagnetic interactions {{and for the}} strong interaction.

Lee and Yang worked out a pencil-and-paper design of an experiment for testing conservation of parity in the laboratory. Lee then turned to Wu for her expertise in choosing and then working out the hardware manufacture, set-up, and laboratory procedures for carrying out this experiment.|$|E
