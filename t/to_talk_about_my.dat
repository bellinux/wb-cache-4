500|$|After {{consulting}} with his lawyers in October 2005, Stollery {{responded to the}} Church with a far more aggressive stance. Now believing the accusation to be completely frivolous, Stollery publicly refused, challenging the Church with: [...] "I'm keeping my domain, see you in court." [...] Again {{in an interview with}} ONE News, Stollery reiterated {{that he was going to}} retain rights to [...] "ScienTOMogy", and not transfer the URL to the Church of Scientology, as they had requested. After the media attention, Stollery said he began to receive [...] "annoying calls" [...] from local Scientologists. [...] "The first few I was stupid enough to answer, but now they just call and call and call. When I did speak to 'a church member here in Auckland' he kept insisting over and over that we meet <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> 'vendetta' with the church." ...|$|E
2500|$|Asked {{about this}} comment in an {{interview}} by email, Coetzee said, [...] "I have met Rian Malan only once in my life. He does not know me and is not qualified <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> character." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although Mauresmo {{had been}} one of the top singles players for several years, she did not have success in winning Grand Slam tournaments until 2006. Her talents were never questioned, but Mauresmo was criticized for her mental {{strength}} after succumbing to nerves in those events. In consecutive Wimbledon semifinals, she lost to Serena Williams and Lindsay Davenport after leading comfortably. Before her 2006 Australian Open title, Mauresmo was often touted as [...] "the greatest women's player never to win a Grand Slam." [...] After winning the 2006 Wimbledon title, Mauresmo openly joked, [...] "I don’t want anyone <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> nerves any more." ...|$|E
60|$|Then we got <b>to</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> brother Samuel, {{and he told}} me my {{explanations}} were confusing.|$|R

6000|$|... “To defend {{me against}} Mr. Littlemore? I’ve known him since I was a baby—I know the worst he can do.” She fixed her charming {{smile on her}} {{retreating}} visitor and added with much unexpectedness: “I want <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him <b>about</b> <b>my</b> past!” ...|$|R
2500|$|The rubber {{match between}} Tim Sylvia and Arlovski {{took place on}} July 8, 2006, at UFC 61. In {{what turned out to}} be a 5-round battle of attrition, neither fighter was able to KO the other, or even land any truly {{significant}} blows. In the end Sylvia won the fight by unanimous decision. It was later discovered that during the fight, Arlovski had been significantly injured by a checked leg kick sometime in the second round which left him unable to throw kicks of his own or make any takedown attempts. When confronted by a reporter about the injury, Arlovski avoided responding directly and would only say [...] "I do not want <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> injuries or look for any other excuses." [...] Not too long after it was revealed Sylvia had sustained an injury as he fainted at his hotel room and upon hospital examination, doctors discovered a concussion undetected after the match.|$|E
2500|$|Diane Sawyer interviewed O'Donnell in a March 14, 2002, {{episode of}} PrimeTime Thursday. O'Donnell told USA Today that {{she chose to}} talk to Sawyer because she wanted an investigative piece on Florida's ban on gay adoption. She told Sawyer if that was done, [...] "I would like <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> life and how (the case) {{pertains}} to me." [...] She spoke about the two gay men in Florida who faced having a foster child they raised removed from their home. State law wouldn't let them adopt because Florida banned gay or bisexual people from adopting. O'Donnell's coming out drew criticism from some LGBT activists who cited her repeated references to being enamored of Tom Cruise on The Rosie O'Donnell Show as deceptive. She responded in her act stating, [...] "I said I wanted him to mow my lawn and bring me a lemonade. I never said I wanted to blow him." [...] After leaving her show and coming out, O'Donnell returned to stand-up comedy, and cut her hair. O'Donnell told the press that her haircut was meant to mimic the haircut of former Culture Club backup singer Helen Terry.|$|E
2500|$|They {{have three}} adult children: {{two daughters and}} a son. His elder daughter, Seon-yong, was born in 1972 and now works for the Korea Foundation in Seoul. Her spouse {{is a native of}} India. His son Woo-hyun was born in 1974 in India. He {{received}} an MBA from Anderson School of Management at University of California, Los Angeles, and works for an investment firm in New York. His younger daughter, Hyun-hee (born 1976), is a field officer for UNICEF in Nairobi. After his election as Secretary-General, Ban became an icon in his hometown, where his extended family still resides. Over 50,000 gathered in a soccer stadium in Chungju for celebration of the result. In the months following his election, thousands of practitioners of geomancy went to his village to determine how it produced such an important person. Ban himself is not a member of any church or religious group and has declined to expound his beliefs: [...] "Now, as Secretary-General, it will not be appropriate at this time <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> own belief in any particular religion or god. So maybe we will have some other time to talk about personal matters." [...] His mother is Buddhist.|$|E
40|$|As {{a younger}} writer, I {{attempted}} {{to write an}} historical novel without really knowing what I was getting into. Almost five years later, it was published under the title "Three Day Road". I look forward <b>to</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> trials and tribulations in writing that book. And it seems that I've gotten addicted to the masochism of writing books about periods of history I seem to know little about. I've embarked on a new journey, writing a new novel that takes place almost five hundred years ago. I'll <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> fears and aspirations with this one, too, as well as give a first-ever reading from my new manuscript...|$|R

2500|$|While {{promoting}} Keep Your Head Down, Yunho and Changmin {{spoke up}} for the first time about their 2010 hiatus and breakup with JYJ. According to Yunho, JYJ had [...] "exceedingly deep conflicts" [...] with their agency and the members had irreconcilable differences about their career. Changmin added that the team had worked so hard {{to the point where they}} felt like they could finally [...] "harvest the fruits of [...] labor", yet instead of being happy they had to perform their final stage with heavy hearts. JYJ responded by saying that they did not regret their decision in leaving S.M. Entertainment. The lyrics of [...] "Keep Your Head Down" [...] also came under media scrutiny, with claims that they were directed at JYJ; however, TVXQ clarified that [...] "Keep Your Head Down" [...] was not a diss track, and that similar claims would still happen even if they were to release a different song with different lyrics. Yunho said, [...] "The song is about a man's mind towards a woman who had left him. We can sometimes find out that a certain song seems <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> own story. In this way it totally depends on the interpretation using our own thoughts." ...|$|E
60|$|We began <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> aunt's losses, and I {{told them}} what I had {{tried to do that}} morning.|$|E

6000|$|... "I wanted you," [...] {{she said}} in answer to his self-reproaches, [...] "and here we are, together. It's simply {{nonsense}} <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> ruining <b>my</b> life and dragging me down. What does it matter about this money? We have got plenty left." ...|$|R
30|$|Patient 1 : I had one {{therapist}} that, I’m mixed, {{and when}} I {{would come to}} see her, all she wanted <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> was <b>my</b> culture, instead of dealing with my psychiatric problems, instead {{of dealing with the}} depression and what was going on at that time.|$|R
6000|$|... "MY DEAR CHARLES,--I {{have wanted}} to see you <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you <b>about</b> <b>my</b> Foreign affairs. If {{you are going to be}} in London for a few days, I believe you can be very useful to me, at a {{considerable}} expense and trouble to yourself, in the way of buying accoutrements; inter alia, a sword and a saddle,--not, you will understand, for my own use.|$|R
6000|$|... [Recovering himself, with a smile.] Has {{she been}} telling you my {{numerous}} faults? [To JENNY.] You must have had plenty <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about,</b> <b>my</b> love.|$|E
6000|$|... "I reckon {{the less}} said {{about it the}} better," [...] responded the older man. [...] "I'm {{going up to the}} camp, but not <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> daughter." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And how the dickens did he know, {{and what}} right had he <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> affairs?" [...] Julien demanded, with all an Englishman's indignation at his {{movements}} having been discussed by strangers.|$|E
5000|$|Some Afghan {{women face}} {{difficulties}} selling their produce {{because of their}} gender. One woman described her own experience: [...] "It really irritates me when I meet shopkeepers <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> selling <b>my</b> fruit and they tell me, 'Go and send a man from your family {{because you are a}} woman.'" ...|$|R
60|$|He got to {{dropping}} alongside {{me every}} day, after breakfast, {{to help me}} make my promenade; and so, {{in the course of}} time, his easy-working jaw had told me everything about his business, his prospects, his family, his relatives, his politics--in fact everything that concerned a Backus, living or dead. And meantime I think he had managed to get out of me everything I knew <b>about</b> <b>my</b> trade, my tribe, my purposes, my prospects, and myself. He was a gentle and persuasive genius, and this thing showed it; for I was not given <b>to</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> matters. I said something about triangulation, once; the stately word pleased his ear; he inquired what it meant; I explained; after that he quietly and inoffensively ignored my name, and always called me Triangle.|$|R
60|$|GERALD. It is very curious, {{my mother}} never <b>talks</b> <b>to</b> me <b>about</b> <b>my</b> father. I {{sometimes}} think she must have married beneath her.|$|R

6000|$|... "Until I {{came here}} {{perhaps that was}} almost nearly true. But you've stirred me up, sweet cousin, and old things, old {{memories}} and habits {{have come to the}} surface again. Mary wrote herself over my life--in all sorts of places.... I can't tell you. I've never talked of her to anyone. I'm not able, very well, <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> feelings.... Perhaps a man of my sort--doesn't love twice over." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So {{you found}} me a bore!" [...] he observed. [...] "Then I {{must admit that}} your manners were good, for when you found that I spoke English and {{that you could not}} escape conversation, you allowed me <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> on <b>about</b> <b>my</b> business, and you showed few signs of weariness. You should be a diplomatist, Mr. Norgate." ...|$|R
2500|$|The album {{deals with}} the [...] "apprehension of a woman facing the death with after all the {{satisfaction}} to have loved". It mainly talks of sex, death and religion. The lyrics are [...] "slightly disturbing", [...] "sometimes important", {{and there is some}} [...] "humor". About the album content, Farmer said: [...] "I very selfishly continue <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> me, <b>my</b> shadows, my lights".|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have not}} ’eard of it," [...] said Captain Barber, fiercely, {{as he took}} up his glass and walked towards the parlour. [...] "I’ve got {{something}} better <b>to</b> do than <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> neighbours’ affairs." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Who the deuce {{asked you}} <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> affairs?" [...] Osborne shouted indignantly. [...] "Why {{the devil is}} all the {{regiment}} to know that I {{am going to be}} married? Why is that tattling old harridan, Peggy O'Dowd, to make free with my name at her d--d supper-table, and advertise my engagement over the three kingdoms? After all, what right have you to say I am engaged, or to meddle in my business at all, Dobbin?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{have reason}} to be patriotic," [...] she said, [...] "or rather, we had," [...] she added, with a curious note of sadness in her tone. [...] "But, come, I do not desire <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> country. I {{admitted}} you here to be an entertaining companion, and you have made me speak already of the subject which is to me the most mournful in the world. I do not wish to talk any more about France. Will you please think of another subject?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Tell him so, Jekyl," [...] {{answered}} the Earl, [...] "and his proud Scotch stomach {{will be up}} in an instant, and he will pay you with a shot for your pains.--Why, he thinks himself cock of the walk, this strutting bantam, notwithstanding the lesson I gave him before--And what do you think?--He has the impudence <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> attentions to Lady Binks as inconsistent with the prosecution of my suit to his sister! Yes, Hal--this awkward Scotch laird, that has scarce tact enough {{to make love to}} a ewe-milker, or, at best, to some daggletailed soubrette, has the assurance to start himself as my rival!" ...|$|E
60|$|Both of them found {{occasion}} on {{that first}} visit of mine <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> me <b>about</b> <b>my</b> published writings and particularly <b>about</b> <b>my</b> then just published book THE NEW RULER, which had interested them very much. It fell in indeed so closely with their own way of thinking that I doubt if they ever understood how independently I had arrived at my conclusions. It was their weakness to claim excessively. That irritation, however, came later. We discovered each other immensely; for a time it produced {{a tremendous sense of}} kindred and co-operation.|$|R
6000|$|... "You understand, Lena, {{that when}} I {{ask you to}} keep so {{strictly}} out of sight, it is because you are not for them <b>to</b> look at--to <b>talk</b> <b>about.</b> <b>My</b> poor Lena! I can't help that feeling. Do you understand it?" ...|$|R
