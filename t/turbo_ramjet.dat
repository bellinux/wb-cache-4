The Gas Generator cycled Air <b>Turbo</b> <b>Ramjet</b> Engine is {{the most}} promising candidate for propulsion engine for this UAV. For this GG-ATR engine, its fuel and oxidizer are bio-ethanol and liquefied oxygen (LOX), respectively. The present paper describes about GG-ATR engine cycle analysis, design and manufacturing of engine components, ground test facilities. In addition, the authors describe about future study plan for ground test of GG-ATR engine. 特集 : 航空宇宙機システム研究センターにおける開発研究 2 : 1. オオワシII飛行にむけて並びに関連技術の研究開発（推進系...|$|E

50|$|While {{conventional}} <b>turbo</b> and <b>ramjet</b> {{engines are}} able to remain reasonably efficient up to Mach 5.5, some ideas for very high-speed flight above Mach 6 are also sometimes discussed, {{with the aim of}} reducing travel times down to one or two hours anywhere in the world.|$|R
40|$|It is {{demonstrated}} that two ceramic engine components of reduced weight can be efficiently produced and employed at higher combustion gas temperatures. The engine components, containing internal cooling and hydraulic passages, are fabricated {{in a process}} involving platelet technology, tape casting, and multilayer ceramic packaging techniques. Traditional metal platelet design techniques are used to fabricate components from ceramic tape which are then laminated and processed to densities of close to 100 percent. A methane cooled regenerator for an air <b>turbo</b> <b>ramjet</b> engine and a rocket engine bipropellant injector are fabricated from silicon nitride. The two components are tested under conditions similar to the pressurization, thrusts, and temperatures encountered in a combustion gas environment. The survivability and leak-free nature of the components demonstrate that more complex ceramic engine components can be fabricated using these techniques...|$|E
40|$|The {{feasibility}} of fabricating an Air <b>Turbo</b> <b>Ramjet</b> (ATR) regenerator containing intricate hydraulic passages from a ceramic material {{in order to}} allow operation with high temperature combustion gas and to reduce weight as compared with metallic materials was demonstrated. Platelet technology, ceramic tape casting, and multilayer ceramic packaging techniques were used in this fabrication of subscale silicon nitride components. Proof-of-concept demonstrations were performed to simulate a methane cooled regenerator for an ATR engine. The regenerator vane was designed to operate at realistic service conditions, i. e., 600 psi in a 3500 R (3040 F), 500 fps combustion gas environment. A total of six regenerators were fabricated and tested. The regenerators were shown to be able to withstand internal pressurization to 1575 psi. They were subjected to testing in 500 fps, 3560 R (3100 F) air/propane combustion products and were operated satisfactorily for an excess of 100 hr and 40 thermal cycles which exceeded 2460 R (2000 F) ...|$|E
40|$|Performance {{analyses}} of Gas Generator cycle Air <b>Turbo</b> <b>Ramjet</b> (GG-ATR) engine are conducted {{to investigate the}} feasibility of ethanol fuel, as comparing Liquefied Hydrogen (LH 2), Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG), and n-C 12 H 26. Liquefied Oxygen (LOX) is considered as an oxidizer. Gas generator combustion temperature and compressor pressure ratio are selected as the analytical parameters, which are varied from 900 to 1700 K and from 2. 0 to 4. 0, respectively. In general, specific impulses of light molecule weight fuels, such as LH 2 and LNG, are {{higher than those of}} large molecule weight fuel. For storable fuel, Isp of ethanol is larger than that of n-C 12 H 26 when gas generator temperature is less than 1300 K, although specific heat release of ethanol is only two thirds of n-C 12 H 26 heat release. The main chemical species of n-C 12 H 26 gas generator (GG) combustion gas are CH 4 and CO. On the other hand, ethanol GG combustion gas is mainly composed of H 2 and CO, resulting in smaller molecular weight than n-C 12 H 26. These characteristics contribute to larger Isp of ethanol than n-C 12 H 26 and indicate the feasibility of ethanol for GG-ATR engine fuel. 本アーカイブに掲載したPDFは校正前の原稿である...|$|E
