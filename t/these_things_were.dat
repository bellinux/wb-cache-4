5|$|The {{text of the}} {{document}} is rather vague and noncommittal. The signatories were concerned with guarding the king's honour {{and the rights of}} the Crown (garder son honeur et les dreits de sa Corounne). There was also a promise to address and correct both the things that had been done against that honour and those rights, as well as the past and present oppression of the people (les choses que sont feites avant ces houres countre soen honour et le droit de sa Coronne, et les oppressiouns que ount estre feit et uncore se fount de jour en jour a soen people). Nothing is said about what specifically <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>were,</b> but it must be assumed that the target was Gaveston. Bek was given the authority to excommunicate whoever broke the terms of the agreement.|$|E
5|$|However much it was believed, the king's divine {{status was}} the {{rationale}} {{for his role as}} Egypt's representative to the gods, as he formed a link between the divine and human realms. The Egyptians believed the gods needed temples to dwell in, as well as the periodic performance of rituals and presentation of offerings to nourish them. <b>These</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> provided by the cults that the king oversaw, with their priests and laborers. Yet, according to royal ideology, temple-building was exclusively the pharaoh's work, as were the rituals that priests usually performed in his stead. These acts were a part of the king's fundamental role: maintaining maat. The king and the nation he represented provided the gods with maat so they could continue to perform their functions, which maintained maat in the cosmos so humans could continue to live.|$|E

25|$|Havel’s message, “We are all responsible, {{we are all}} guilty,” was not popular. He {{enacted a}} general amnesty {{for all but the}} most serious criminals, apologized on behalf of Czechoslovakia for the post-World War II {{expulsion}} of the Sudeten Germans and resisted demands for a more draconian purge of secret police collaborators. <b>These</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> not popular either. And as the government undertook privatization and restitution, Havel confronted pyramid schemes, financial corruption and robber baron capitalism. He saw his country fall apart (if bloodlessly), becoming in 1993 the Czech Republic and Slovakia.|$|E
25|$|One {{study that}} {{looked at the}} abuse of street {{children}} in Jaipur City, India in 2009 provided new insight into the abuse that street children in India suffer by studying the types and prevalence of abuse and how <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> related to other factors. The street children in the study reported all five types of abuse: general abuse and neglect, health abuse, verbal abuse, physical abuse, psychological abuse, and sexual abuse. Verbal and psychological abuse were reported the most. Older children and children with higher incomes were abused more than younger children and children with lower incomes, respectively.|$|E

25|$|Mantetsu {{was also}} {{charged with a}} government-like role in {{managing}} the rail transportation system after the formation of Manchukuo in 1932. By 1938, Mantetsu had 72 subsidiary companies, development projects in 25 urban areas and carried 17,515,000 passengers per year. Between 1930-1940, the Japanese population of Manchukuo rose by 800,000 making ethnic Japanese the majority {{in many of the}} towns and cities served by Mantetsu. Mantetsu prided itself on state-of-the-art urban planning, with modern sewer systems, public parks, and creative modern architecture far in advance of what could be found in Japan itself. <b>These</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> possible due to Mantetsu's tremendous profitability, and its political power to seize property and silence opposition and dissent at will through its political connections to the military and totalitarian national leadership.|$|E
25|$|The {{circumstance}} of Mr. Rogers having preached at Paul's cross, after Queen Mary {{arrived at}} the Tower, has been already stated. He confirmed in his sermon the true doctrine taught in King Edward's time, and exhorted the people to beware of the pestilence of popery, idolatry, and superstition. For this he was called to account, but so ably defended himself that, for that time, he was dismissed. The proclamation of the queen, however, to prohibit true preaching, gave his enemies a new handle against him. Hence he was again summoned before the council, and commanded to keep to his house. He did so, though he might have escaped; and though he perceived {{the state of the}} true religion to be desperate. He knew he could not want a living in Germany; and he could not forget a wife and ten children, and to seek means to succor them. But all <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> insufficient to induce him to depart, and, when once called to answer in Christ's cause, he stoutly defended it, and hazarded his life for that purpose.|$|E
25|$|The Internet allows {{computer}} users to remotely access other computers and information stores easily from any access point. Access may be with computer security, i.e. authentication and encryption technologies, {{depending on the}} requirements. This is encouraging new ways of working from home, collaboration and information sharing in many industries. An accountant sitting at home can audit the books of a company based in another country, on a server situated in a third country that is remotely maintained by IT specialists in a fourth. These accounts could have been created by home-working bookkeepers, in other remote locations, based on information emailed to them from offices all over the world. Some of <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> possible before {{the widespread use of}} the Internet, but the cost of private leased lines would have made many of them infeasible in practice. An office worker away from their desk, perhaps {{on the other side of}} the world on a business trip or a holiday, can access their emails, access their data using cloud computing, or open a remote desktop session into their office PC using a secure virtual private network (VPN) connection on the Internet. This can give the worker complete access to all of their normal files and data, including email and other applications, while away from the office. It has been referred to among system administrators as the Virtual Private Nightmare, because it extends the secure perimeter of a corporate network into remote locations and its employees' homes.|$|E

On the night of October 15, 1872, with an iceberg {{threatening}} the ship, Schuman reported that water was coming in and the pumps could not keep up. Budington ordered cargo to be thrown onto the ice to buoy the ship. Men began throwing goods overboard, as Tyson put it, [...] "with no care taken as to how or where <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> thrown". Much of the jettisoned cargo was lost.|$|E
500|$|Islamic and Christian missionaries {{among the}} Chinese were strong advocates of shorter male hair for their converts. Around the Destruction of Four Olds period in 1964, almost {{anything}} {{seen as part}} of Traditional Chinese culture would lead to problems with the Communist Red Guards. [...] Items that attracted dangerous attention if caught in the public included jewelry and long male hair. <b>These</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> regarded as symbols of bourgeois lifestyle, that represented wealth. [...] People had to avoid them or suffer serious consequences such as tortures and beatings by the guards. More recently, long hair was ridiculed in China from October 1983 to December 1983, as part of the short and unsuccessful Anti-Spiritual Pollution Campaign.|$|E

Carry On Laughing ran for two seasons, with six half-hour episodes in season one and seven in season two. [...] The writer Penelope Gilliatt wrote: [...] "The usual charge to make against the Carry On films {{is to say that}} they could be so much better done. [...] This is true enough. [...] They look dreadful, they seem to be edited with a bacon slicer, the effects are perfunctory and the comic rhythm jerks along like a cat on a cold morning. [...] But if all <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> more elegant I don't really think the films would be more enjoyable: the badness is part of the funniness." ...|$|E

500|$|The show's sound {{production}} team had two major special effects to create for the episode: the mole creature, and Olivia's superhearing. They decided to voice the creature using Automated Dialogue Replacement (ADR) [...] "because his range of actions and emotions {{was simply too}} broad for a library monster vocal set to cover". Sound editor Bruce Tanis cut [...] "creepy moans and breaths" [...] when the creature was heard but not seen, and added [...] "a layer of vicious attack growls and wounded screams" [...] for when it died. Tanis commented that the actor voicing the creature placed pieces of orange in his mouth {{in order to have}} [...] "a slobbery, sputtering voice". For Olivia's scenes with superhearing, Tanis made ordinary, far off items like phones, typewriters, and cars [...] "sound a little beefier than normal and kept them a bit more up in the mix than they usually would be," [...] as <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> not in the same room as her. The sound editors wanted to emphasize that the various sounds she hears could be coming from anywhere, such as next door, or a block away, or could perhaps be all inside her head. Torv later noted in a BuddyTV interview that while shooting, she was unsure whether her newfound abilities were permanent or temporary, to which the writers replied that [...] "apparently it's just something that comes and goes". After expressing her confusion, they responded [...] "Oh that's good, Olivia's confused too".|$|E
