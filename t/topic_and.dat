40|$|Research <b>topics</b> <b>and</b> {{research}} {{communities are}} not disconnected from each other: communities <b>and</b> <b>topics</b> are interwoven <b>and</b> co-evolving. Yet, scientometric evaluations of <b>topics</b> <b>and</b> communities {{have been conducted}} independently and synchronically, with researchers often relying on homogeneous unit of analysis, such as authors, journals, institutions, or topics. Therefore, new methods are warranted that examine the dynamic relationship between <b>topics</b> <b>and</b> communities. This paper examines how research <b>topics</b> are mixed <b>and</b> matched in evolving research communities by using a hybrid approach which integrates both <b>topic</b> identification <b>and</b> community detection techniques. Using a data set on information retrieval (IR) publications, two layers of enriched information are constructed and contrasted: one is the communities detected through the topology of coauthorship network {{and the other is}} the topics of the communities detected through the topic model. We find evidence to support the assumption that IR communities <b>and</b> <b>topics</b> are interwoven <b>and</b> co-evolving, <b>and</b> <b>topics</b> can be used to understand the dynamics of community structures. We recommend the use of the hybrid approach to study the dynamic interactions of <b>topics</b> <b>and</b> communities...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Preservice {{teachers}} identify <b>topics</b> <b>and</b> formulate {{research questions}} in action research {{under the guidance}} of advisors in the teaching practicum of an undergraduate foreign languages teaching program in Colombia. Objective: To examine preservice teachers' and advisors' beliefs about useful methodological strategies to identify the <b>topics</b> <b>and</b> formulate the research questions, and the roles they assumed. Method: In this case study, structured questionnaires and semi-structured interviews were used with the participants. Results: This study shows that journal writing, collaborative dialogue, exploring and expanding one's theoretical base, delimiting <b>topics,</b> <b>and</b> demonstrating work were useful strategies. Though preservice teachers took ownership of choosing <b>topics</b> <b>and</b> formulating questions, some shared roles led advisors to participate more actively in this process. Conclusions: The methodological process used to identify the <b>topics</b> <b>and</b> formulate the research questions is associated with a reflective professional development endeavour with individual and group reflection...|$|R
40|$|The {{diffusion}} process on weblogs has attracted great interest {{since the early}} days of weblog studies. We propose a ranking technique which extracts <b>topics</b> <b>and</b> innovators by analyzing that process. Our method identifies URLs of <b>topics</b> <b>and</b> the bloggers who trigger topic diffusion. Our assumption is that the strength of propagation of a topic is determined by the influences of <b>topics</b> <b>and</b> bloggers. This decomposition is attained through singular value decomposition (SVD); We construct a diffusion matrix: the first left and right singular vectors are regarded respectively as the influences of the <b>topics</b> <b>and</b> the bloggers. We show that our method can extract propagative topics (which is not bursty because of the media effect) as well as the influential bloggers...|$|R

On 13 December 2007, Foreign Secretary David Miliband attended for the Prime Minister at the official signing ceremony in Lisbon of the EU Reform Treaty. Brown's opponents {{on both sides of the}} House, and in the press, suggested that ratification by Parliament was not enough and that a referendum should also be held. Labour's 2005 manifesto had pledged to give British public {{a referendum on the}} original EU Constitution.

5|$|Gradually, {{women began}} to author their own {{thoughts}} and literary works about lesbian relationships. Until {{the publication of}} The Well of Loneliness, most major works involving lesbianism were penned by men. Foster suggests that women would have encountered suspicion about their own lives had they used same-sex love as a <b>topic,</b> <b>and</b> that some writers including Louise Labé, Charlotte Charke, and Margaret Fuller either changed the pronouns in their literary works to male, or made them ambiguous. Author George Sand was portrayed as a character in several works in the 19th century; writer Mario Praz credited the popularity of lesbianism as a theme to Sand's appearance in Paris society in the 1830s. Charlotte Brontë's Villette in 1853 initiated a genre of boarding school stories with homoerotic themes.|$|E

From 1969 to 1973, Mau became friends with Mike McCoy, a Peace Corps volunteer stationed on Satawal. As well as marrying Mau's niece, McCoy sailed with Mau and they worked together on a project tagging turtles. McCoy became interested in Satawalese navigation, published several articles on the <b>topic</b> <b>and</b> {{kept in touch with}} the anthropologist Ben Finney, who was researching Polynesian navigation. When McCoy's assignment on Satawal ended, he asked Pialug if he wanted to come to Hawaii with him.|$|E

5|$|Scotland in the High Middle Ages is a {{relatively}} well-studied <b>topic</b> <b>and</b> Scottish medievalists have produced {{a wide variety of}} publications. Some, such as David Dumville, Thomas Owen Clancy and Dauvit Broun, are primarily interested in the native cultures of the country, and often have linguistic training in the Celtic languages. Normanists, such as G.W.S. Barrow, are concerned with the Norman and Scoto-Norman cultures introduced to Scotland after the eleventh century. For much of the twentieth century, historians tended to stress the cultural change that took place in Scotland during this time. However, scholars such as Cynthia Neville and Richard Oram, while not ignoring cultural changes, argue that continuity with the Gaelic past was just as, if not more, important.|$|E

5|$|Syntax {{refers to}} {{patterns}} for combining {{words and phrases}} to make clauses and sentences. Verbal and nominal inflectional morphology are central to Ottawa syntax, as they mark grammatical information on verbs and nouns {{to a greater extent}} than in English (which has few inflections, and relies mainly on word order). Preferred word orders in a simple transitive sentence are verb-initial, such as verb–object–subject (VOS) and VSO. While verb-final orders are avoided, all logically possible orders are attested. Ottawa word order displays considerably more freedom than is found in languages such as English, and word order frequently reflects discourse-based distinctions such as <b>topic</b> <b>and</b> focus.|$|E

This would be the 50th anniversary of the Massey Lectures and coincide with the 75th anniversary of the CBC.

5|$|Publisher Jamie Byng of Canongate Books {{solicited}} author Margaret Atwood {{to write}} a novella re-telling a classic myth of her choice. Byng explained it would be published simultaneously in several languages {{as part of an}} international project called the Canongate Myth Series. Atwood agreed to help the rising young publisher by participating in the project. From her home in Toronto, the 64-year-old author made attempts at writing the Norse creation myth and a Native American story but struggled. After speaking with her British literary agent about canceling her contract, Atwood began thinking about the Odyssey. She had first read it as a teenager and remembered finding the imagery of Penelope's twelve maids being hanged in the denouement disturbing. Atwood believed the roles of Penelope and her maids during Odysseus' absence had been a largely neglected scholarly <b>topic</b> <b>and</b> that she could help address it with this project.|$|E
5|$|Sigmund Freud, {{the founder}} of psychoanalytic theory, {{discussed}} the ego's role in balancing the immediate pleasure-driven desires of the id with the morality-driven choices of the superego. Funder and Block expanded psychoanalytic research on the <b>topic,</b> <b>and</b> found that impulsivity, {{or a lack of}} ego-control, has a stronger effect on one's ability to delay rewards if a reward is more desirable. Finally, environmental and social factors play a role; for example, delay is affected by the self-imposed or external nature of a reward contingency, by the degree of task engagement required during the delay, by early mother-child relationship characteristics, by a person's previous experiences with unreliable promises of rewards (e.g., in poverty), and by contemporary sociocultural expectations and paradigms. Research on animals comprises another body of literature describing delayed gratification characteristics that are not as easily tested in human samples, such as ecological factors affecting the skill.|$|E
