25|$|Sequent {{calculus}} is, in essence, a {{style of}} formal logical argumentation where every line of a proof is a conditional <b>tautology</b> (called a sequent by Gerhard Gentzen) instead of an unconditional <b>tautology.</b> Each conditional <b>tautology</b> is inferred from other conditional tautologies on earlier lines in a formal argument according to rules and procedures of inference, giving a better approximation to the style of natural deduction used by mathematicians than David Hilbert's earlier style of formal logic where every line was an unconditional <b>tautology.</b> There may be more subtle distinctions to be made; for example, there may be non-logical axioms upon which all propositions are implicitly dependent. Then sequents signify conditional theorems in a first-order language rather than conditional tautologies.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{consists}} of two parts both of which attempt to provide <b>tautologies</b> which might be hard for a propositional proof system P. Finding hard <b>tautologies</b> is of interest as a possible approach to the NP versus co − NP problem. The {{first part of the}} paper continues the study of the τ(g) b(x) <b>tautologies</b> begun in Krajíček [1]. These <b>tautologies</b> express that b ∈ { 0, 1 } m is not the output of g(x) for a function g: { 0, 1 } n − → { 0, 1 } m with m> n computed by a polynomial sized circuit family. In the earlier Krajíček paper, τ(g) b(x) <b>tautologies,</b> where g computes a certain pseudo-random number generator, were put forward as candidate hard <b>tautologies</b> for propositional proof systems like extended Frege. Another choice of g suggested in this earlier paper was the function tt which takes as input a circuit C of size at most 2 k/ 2 with k inputs and outputs the truth table for C. The first part of the present paper gives two example <b>tautologies,</b> which if they had short proofs, would imply the τ(g) b(x) <b>tautologies</b> have short proofs.

40|$|This {{paper is}} aimed at finding {{differentiating}} criteria between <b>tautologies</b> and pleonasms and other expressions with similar syntactic, semantic and pragmatic properties through examining a corpus of 1000 examples in English, German and Russian. It is argued that although in logical theories <b>tautologies</b> were considered redundant and non-informative (Wittgenstein, Carnap, Frege, Russell), their wide usage in various discourses and multiple syntactic types suggest their meaningfulness in most cases. From the semantic viewpoint, <b>tautologies</b> and pleonasm of the prototypic structure A 1 (to be) A 2 are defined as explicative expressions, in which components A 1 and A 2 are related as a concept and its attribute. The analyzed data shows that the denotative meaning of components A 1 and A 2 is identical in <b>tautologies,</b> and partially identical in pleonasms. The meaningfulness of these expressions is explained by the variations in the connotative meaning of A 1 and A 2. Two differentiating semantic criteria for explicitly redundant expressions are suggested in this paper. As my literature review shows, the most commonly analyzed syntactic type of <b>tautologies</b> and pleonasm is A 1 (to be) A 2 (Seibicke, Wierzbicka). As a result of semantic analysis, several other frequented syntactic types of <b>tautologies</b> and pleonasms are singled out, such as attributive <b>tautologies</b> (academic scholar), predicative <b>tautologies</b> (boys will be boys), tautological or pleonastic parataxis (she’s she, and I’m I) and hypotaxis, which is in its turn is divided into further subtypes {{depending on the type}} of the dependant clause (e. g. conditional clauses: if I must, I must). The pragmatic analysis focuses on the illocutionary functions of the expression. It is demonstrated that <b>tautologies</b> and pleonasms can be used in different types of speech acts and have different illocutionary force. Intrasubjective and extrasubjective factors, determining the choice of <b>tautologies</b> and pleonasms by the speaker, are analyzed. Such factors include the observance/flouting of the principle of politeness, shared background knowledge, language incompetence, and affective state. It is proposed that in similar situations speakers tend to use similar expressions. Some situational factors determining the choice of <b>tautologies</b> and pleonasm are described. It is suggested that <b>tautologies</b> and pleonasm are used redundantly only in predicative structures, when their function is limited by the expression of the grammatical categories of tense and aspect (they kissed a long tender kiss) ...|$|R

25|$|An axiomatization of propositional {{calculus}} {{is a set}} of tautologies called axioms and one or more inference rules for producing new tautologies from old. A proof in an axiom system A is a finite nonempty sequence of propositions each of which is either an instance of an axiom of A or follows by some rule of A from propositions appearing earlier in the proof (thereby disallowing circular reasoning). The last proposition is the theorem proved by the proof. Every nonempty initial segment of a proof is itself a proof, whence every proposition in a proof is itself a theorem.

The st-connectivityprinciple {{states that it}} is not possible to have a red path of edges and a green path of edges which connect diagonally opposite corners of thegrid graph unless the paths cross somewhere. We prove that the propositional <b>tautologies</b> which encode the st-connectivity principle have polynomial size Frege proofs and poly-nomial size T C 0 -Frege proofs. For bounded width grid graphs, the st-connectivity <b>tautologies</b> have polynomial size resolution proofs. Akey part of the proof is to show that the group with two generators, both of order two, has word problem in alternating logtime (Alogtime) and even in T C 0. Conversely, we show that constant depth Frege proofs of the st-connectivity <b>tautologies</b> require near-exponential size.
