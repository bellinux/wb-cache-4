5|$|Only Roman {{citizens}} (both plebeians and patricians) had {{the right}} to confer magisterial powers (potestas) on any individual magistrate. The most important power was imperium, which was held by consuls (the chief magistrates) and by praetors (the second highest-ranking ordinary magistrate). Defined narrowly, imperium simply gave a magistrate the authority to command a military force. Defined more broadly, however, imperium gave a magistrate the constitutional authority to issue commands (military, diplomatic, civil, or otherwise). A magistrate's imperium was at its apex while the magistrate was abroad. While the magistrate was in the city of Rome itself, however, he had to completely surrender his imperium, so that liberty (libertas) was maximized. Magistrates with imperium sat in a curule chair, and were attended by lictors (bodyguards) who carried axes called fasces which symbolized <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> to punish and to execute. Only a magistrate with imperium could wear a bordered toga, or be awarded a triumph.|$|E

5|$|The Right to Freedom of Religion, {{covered in}} Articles 25–28, {{provides}} religious freedom to all citizens and ensures a secular state in India. According to the Constitution, {{there is no}} official State religion, and the State is required to treat all religions impartially and neutrally. Article 25 guarantees all persons the freedom of conscience {{and the right to}} preach, practice and propagate any religion of their choice. This right is, however, subject to public order, morality and health, and <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>State</b> to take measures for social welfare and reform. The right to propagate, however, does not include the right to convert another individual, since it would amount to an infringement of the other's right to freedom of conscience. Article 26 guarantees all religious denominations and sects, subject to public order, morality and health, to manage their own affairs in matters of religion, set up institutions of their own for charitable or religious purposes, and own, acquire and manage property in accordance with law. These provisions do not derogate from the State's power to acquire property belonging to a religious denomination. The State is also empowered to regulate any economic, political or other secular activity associated with religious practice. Article 27 guarantees that no person can be compelled to pay taxes for the promotion of any particular religion or religious institution. Article 28 prohibits religious instruction in a wholly State-funded educational institution, and educational institutions receiving aid from the State cannot compel any of their members to receive religious instruction or attend religious worship without their (or their guardian's) consent.|$|E

Advani paused the yatra in Delhi for several days, daring the central government to arrest him, which it did not. However, on 23 October the Indian Prime Minister V. P.

25|$|Ngawang Namgyal's son and stepbrother, in 1651 and 1680, respectively, succeeded him. They {{started their}} reigns as minors {{under the control}} of {{religious}} and civil regents and rarely exercised authority in their own names. For further continuity, the concept of multiple reincarnation of the first Zhabdrung—in the form of either his body, his speech, or his mind—was invoked by the Je Khenpo and the Druk Desi, both of whom wanted to retain the power they had accrued through the dual system of government. The last person recognized as the bodily reincarnation of Ngawang Namgyal died in the mid-18th century, but speech and mind reincarnations, embodied by individuals who acceded to the position of Zhabdrung Rinpoche, were recognized into the early 20th century. <b>The</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> religion also increased with a new monastic code that remained in effect in the early 1990s. The compulsory admission to monastic life of at least one son from any family having three or more sons was instituted in the late 17th century. In time, however, the State Council became increasingly secular as did the successive Druk Desi, ponlop, and dzongpon, and intense rivalries developed among the ponlop of Tongsa and Paro and the dzongpon of Punakha, Thimphu, and Wangdue Phodrang.|$|E

500|$|Film scholar Stephen Teo {{posits that}} Mughal-e-Azam is a [...] "national allegory", a stylistic way of appropriating history and {{heritage}} to emphasise the national identity.
