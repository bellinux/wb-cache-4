40|$|Although Apis mellifera, {{the western}} honey bee, has long {{encountered}} pesticides when foraging in agricultural fields, {{for two decades}} it has encountered pesticides in-hive {{in the form of}} acaricides to control Varroa destructor, a devastating parasitic mite. The pyrethroid <b>tau-fluvalinate</b> and the organophosphate coumaphos have been used for Varroa control, with little knowledge of honey bee detoxification mechanisms. Cytochrome P 450 -mediated detoxification contributes to pyrethroid tolerance in many insects, but specific P 450 s responsible for pesticide detoxification in honey bees (indeed, in any hymenopteran pollinator) have not been defined. We expressed and assayed CYP 3 clan midgut P 450 s and demonstrated that CYP 9 Q 1, CYP 9 Q 2, and CYP 9 Q 3 metabolize <b>tau-fluvalinate</b> to a form suitable for further cleavage by the carboxylesterases that also contribute to <b>tau-fluvalinate</b> tolerance. These in vitro assays indicated that all of the three CYP 9 Q enzymes also detoxify coumaphos. Molecular models demonstrate that coumaphos and <b>tau-fluvalinate</b> fit into the same catalytic pocket, providing a possible explanation for the synergism observed between these two compounds. Induction of CYP 9 Q 2 and CYP 9 Q 3 transcripts by honey extracts suggested that diet-derived phytochemicals may be natural substrates and heterologous expression of CYP 9 Q 3 confirmed activity against quercetin, a flavonoid ubiquitous in honey. Up-regulation by honey constituents suggests that diet may influence the ability of honey bees to detoxify pesticides. Quantitative RT-PCR assays demonstrated that <b>tau-fluvalinate</b> enhances CYP 9 Q 3 transcripts, whereas the pyrethroid bifenthrin enhances CYP 9 Q 1 and CYP 9 Q 2 transcripts and represses CYP 9 Q 3 transcripts.

40|$|Background: Honey {{bees are}} exposed to phytochemicals through the nectar, pollen and {{propolis}} consumed to sustain the colony. They may also encounter mycotoxins produced by Aspergillus fungi infesting pollen in beebread. Moreover, bees {{are exposed to}} agricultural pesticides, particularly in-hive acaricides used against the parasite Varroa destructor. They cope with these and other xenobiotics primarily through enzymatic detoxificative processes, but the regulation of detoxificative enzymes in honey bees remains largely unexplored. Methodology/Principal Findings: We used several approaches to ascertain effects of dietary toxins on bee susceptibility to synthetic and natural xenobiotics, including the acaricide <b>tau-fluvalinate,</b> the agricultural pesticide imidacloprid, and the naturally occurring mycotoxin aflatoxin. We administered potential inducers of cytochrome P 450 enzymes, the principal biochemical system for Phase 1 detoxification in insects, to investigate how detoxification is regulated. The drug phenobarbital induces P 450 s in many insects, yet feeding bees with phenobarbital {{had no effect on}} the toxicity of taufluvalinate, a pesticide known to be detoxified by bee P 450 s. Similarly, no P 450 induction, as measured by <b>tau-fluvalinate</b> tolerance, occurred in bees fed xanthotoxin, salicylic acid, or indole- 3 -carbinol, all of which induce P 450 s in other insects.

40|$|Background: Chemical {{analysis}} shows that honey bees (Apis mellifera) and hive products contain many pesticides derived from various sources. The most abundant pesticides are acaricides applied by beekeepers to control Varroa destructor. Beekeepers also apply antimicrobial drugs to control bacterial and microsporidial diseases. Fungicides may enter the hive {{when applied to}} nearby flowering crops. Acaricides, antimicrobial drugs and fungicides are not highly toxic to bees alone, but in combination there is potential for heightened toxicity due to interactive effects. Methodology/Principal Findings: Laboratory bioassays based on mortality rates in adult worker bees demonstrated interactive effects among acaricides, {{as well as between}} acaricides and antimicrobial drugs and between acaricides and fungicides. Toxicity of the acaricide <b>tau-fluvalinate</b> increased in combination with other acaricides and most other compounds tested (15 of 17) while amitraz toxicity was mostly unchanged (1 of 15). The sterol biosynthesis inhibiting (SBI) fungicide prochloraz elevated the toxicity of the acaricides <b>tau-fluvalinate,</b> coumaphos and fenpyroximate, likely through inhibition of detoxicative cytochrome P 450 monooxygenase activity. Four other SBI fungicides increased the toxicity of <b>tau-fluvalinate</b> in a dose-dependent manner, although possible evidence of P 450 induction was observed at the lowest fungicide doses. Non-transitive interactions between some acaricides were observed.

The synthetic pyrethroids <b>tau-fluvalinate</b> and flumethrin have proven very effective at managing this mite within apiaries, but intensive control programs based mainly on one active ingredient have led to many reports of pyrethroid resistance. In Europe, a modification of leucine to valine at position 925 (L 925 V) of the V. destructor voltage-gated sodium channel was correlated with resistance, the mutation being found at high frequency exclusively in hives with a recent history of pyrethroid treatment. Here, we identify two novel mutations, L 925 M and L 925 I, in <b>tau-fluvalinate</b> resistant V. destructor collected at seven sites across Florida and Georgia in the Southeastern region of the USA.

40|$|Honey bee (Apis mellifera) colonies are declining, and {{a number}} of {{stressors}} have been identified that affect, alone or in combination, the health of honey bees. The ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor, honey bee viruses that are often closely associated with the mite, and pesticides used to control the mite population form a complex system of stressors that may affect honey bee health in different ways. During an acaricide treatment using Apistan (plastic strips coated with <b>tau-fluvalinate),</b> we analyzed the infection dynamics of deformed wing virus (DWV), sacbrood virus (SBV), and black queen cell virus (BQCV) in adult bees, mite-infested pupae, their associated Varroa mites, and uninfested pupae, comparing these to similar samples from untreated control colonies. Titers of DWV increased initially with the onset of the acaricide application and then slightly decreased progressively coinciding with the removal of the Varroa mite infestation. This initial increase in DWV titers suggests a physiological effect of <b>tau-fluvalinate</b> on the host's susceptibility to viral infection. DWV titers in adult bees and uninfested pupae remained higher in treated colonies than in untreated colonies. The titers of SBV and BQCV did not show any direct relationship with mite infestation and showed a variety of possible effects of the acaricide treatment. The results indicate that other factors besides Varroa mite infestation may be important to the development and maintenance of damaging DWV titers in colonies. Possible biochemical explanations for the observed synergistic effects between <b>tau-fluvalinate</b> and virus infections are discussed...|$|E

Although pyrethroids such as <b>tau-fluvalinate</b> and flumethrin can be highly effective in removing the mites from hives, their intensive use has led to many reports of resistance. To investigate the mechanism of resistance in UK Varroa samples, the transmembrane domain regions of the V. destructor voltage-gated sodium channel (the main target site for pyrethroids) were PCR amplified and sequenced from pyrethroid treated/untreated mites collected at several locations in Central/Southern England. A novel amino acid substitution, L 925 V, was identified that maps to a known hot spot for resistance within the domain IIS 5 helix of the channel protein; a region that has also been proposed to form part of the pyrethroid binding site. Using a high throughput diagnostic assay capable of detecting the mutation in individual mites, the L 925 V substitution was found to correlate well with resistance, being present in all mites that had survived <b>tau-fluvalinate</b> treatment but in only 8 % of control, untreated samples.

One major group of {{hypotheses}} invokes the pesticides and other xenobiotics to which this important pollinator species is often exposed. Most {{studies have focused on}} mortality or behavioral deficiencies in exposed honey bees while neglecting other biological functions and target organs. The midgut epithelium of honey bees presents an important interface between the insect and its environment. It is maintained by proliferation of intestinal stem cells throughout the adult life of honey bees. We used caged honey bees to test multiple xenobiotics for effects on the replicative activity of the intestinal stem cells under laboratory conditions. Most of the tested compounds did not alter the replicative activity of intestinal stem cells. However, colchicine, methoxyfenozide, tetracycline, and a combination of coumaphos and <b>tau-fluvalinate</b> significantly affected proliferation rate. All substances except methoxyfenozide decreased proliferation rate. Thus, the results indicate that some xenobiotics frequently used in apiculture and known to accumulate in honey bee hives may have hitherto unknown physiological effects. The nutritional status and the susceptibility to pathogens of honey bees could be compromised by the impacts of xenobiotics on the maintenance of the midgut epithelium.

Honey bees are exposed to pesticides when foraging for nectar and pollen and when beekeepers use in-hive chemical pest control measures. Persistent pesticides can accumulate in the hive over years, potentially harming the bees. Honeycomb is removed from bee colonies for honey extraction and then placed back on the colonies at a later date, providing a time when combs could be fumigated to eliminate or reduce pesticide residues. We found that ozone gas at a rate> 920 mg O 3 /m 3 for 10 - 20 h lowers coumaphos residues on a glass surface by 93 - 100 % and <b>tau-fluvalinate</b> by 75 - 98 %. Ozone was less effective at eliminating pesticides on beeswax, and residues were more effectively eliminated with new combs (comb built by bees within 3 y) than with old combs (combs used by beekeepers for> 10 y). Ozone significantly reduced dimethylphenyl formamide, chlorpyrifos, and fenpyroximate contaminations in comb. When comb is treated with ozone, an off-odor is created, but the volatiles {{were found to be}} primarily straight chain aldehydes and carboxylic acids that are probably harmless to bees and humans.

In the potentiation studies, {{the effect of the}} insecticide dimethoate with added propiconazole fungicide and neonicotinoid insecticide clothianidin with added <b>tau-fluvalinate</b> pyrethroid acaricide showed no difference in toxicity compared to the single chemical alone. Clothianidin toxicity showed a small scale, but temporally conserved increase in exposure conducted in the presence of propiconazole, particularly for B. terrestris and O. bicornis, the latter showing a near three-fold increase in clothianidin toxicity in the presence of propiconazole. In the mixture toxicity studies, the dominant response patterns were of additivity, however, binary mixtures of clothianidin and dimethoate in A. mellifera, B. terrestris and male O. bicornis there was evidence of a predominant antagonistic interaction.

Since the honey bee genome {{has been published}} (Honey bee Genome Sequencing Consortium, 2006), more is known about their metabolic systems, especially the detoxification pathways for potential xenobiotics. Bioassay and biochemical data from various {{studies have shown that}} both P 450 s and carboxylesterases are responsible for pesticide metabolism in honey bees. Here, those metabolic enzymes that confer primary defence to different classes of insecticides in honey bee were validated. Metabolic enzymes are characterised regarding their ability to interact with the insecticide. Synergist bioassay results with PBO and EN 16 / 5 - 1 suggest that detoxification mechanism(s) {{play an important role in}} protecting honey bees from selected insecticide toxicity. No binding was found between honey bee esterases and tested insecticides, whilst inhibition of P 450 activity sensitised the honey bees to these chemicals. Metabolism of <b>tau-fluvalinate</b> and thiacloprid in honey bees is reportedly due to P 450 activity, but this metabolism may not be the only reason for the relatively benign action of this insecticide on bees. Honey bees are less sensitive to neonicotinoids containing a cyanoimino pharmacophore than to those with a nitroimino group, however the specific enzymes involved in detoxification remain to be characterised. In this work, pre-treatment of honey bees with a sub-lethal dose of an insecticide induced protection to the same compound. Transcriptome profiling, using microarrays, identified a number of genes encoding detoxification enzymes that were overexpressed significantly in insecticide-treated bees compared to untreated controls...|$|E
40|$|Sodium channels, found ubiquitously {{in animal}} muscle cells and neurons, {{are one of}} the main target sites of many naturally-occurring, insecticidal plant {{compounds}} and agricultural pesticides. Pyrethroids, derived from compounds found only in the Asteraceae, are particularly toxic to insects and have been successfully used as pesticides including on flowering crops that are visited by pollinators. Pyrethrins, from which they were derived, occur naturally in the nectar of some flowering plant species. We know relatively little about how such compounds [...] i. e., compounds that target sodium channels [...] influence pollinators at low or sub-lethal doses. Here, we exposed individual adult forager honeybees to several compounds that bind to sodium channels to identify whether these compounds affect motor function. Using an assay previously developed to identify the effect of drugs and toxins on individual bees, we investigated how acute exposure to 10 ng doses (1 ppm) of the pyrethroid insecticides (cyfluthrin, <b>tau-fluvalinate,</b> allethrin and permethrin) and the nectar toxins (aconitine and grayanotoxin I) affected honeybee locomotion, grooming and wing fanning behaviour. Bees exposed to these compounds spent more time upside down and fanning their wings. They also had longer bouts of standing still. Bees exposed to the nectar toxin, aconitine, and the pyrethroid, allethrin, also spent less time grooming their antennae. We also found that the concentration of the nectar toxin, grayanotoxin I (GTX), fed to bees affected the time spent upside down (i. e., failure to perform the righting reflex). Our data show that low doses of pyrethroids and other nectar toxins that target sodium channels mainly influence motor function through their effect on the righting reflex of adult worker honeybees...|$|E
40|$|Honey bees (Apis mellifera) are {{the primary}} pollinators of major horticultural crops. Over the last few decades, a {{substantial}} decline in honey bees and their colonies have been reported. While a plethora of factors could contribute to the putative decline, pathogens and pesticides are common concerns that draw attention. In addition to potential direct effects on honey bees, indirect pesticide effects could include alteration of essential gut microbial communities and symbionts {{that are important to}} honey bee health (e. g. immune system). The primary objective {{of this study was to}} determine the microbiome associated with honey bees exposed to commonly used in-hive pesticides: coumaphos, <b>tau-fluvalinate</b> and chlorothalonil. Treatments were replicated at three independent locations near Blacksburg Virginia, and included a no-pesticide amended control at each location. The microbiome was characterized through pyrosequencing of V 2 -V 3 regions of the bacterial 16 S rRNA gene and fungal ITS region. Pesticide exposure significantly affected the structure of bacterial but not fungal communities. The bee bacteriome, similar to other studies, was dominated by sequences derived from Bacilli, Actinobacteria, α-, β-, γ-proteobacteria. The fungal community sequences were dominated by Ascomycetes and Basidiomycetes. The Multi-response permutation procedures (MRPP) and subsequent Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt) analysis indicated that chlorothalonil caused significant change to the structure and functional potential of the honey bee gut bacterial community relative to control. Putative genes for oxidative phosphorylation, for example, increased while sugar metabolism and peptidase potential declined in the microbiome of chlorothalonil exposed bees. The results of this field-based study suggest the potential for pesticide induced changes to the honey bee gut microbiome that warrant further investigation...|$|E
40|$|In Italy a nation-wide {{monitoring}} {{network was}} established in 2009 in response to significant honey bee colony mortality reported during 2008. The network comprised of approximately 100 apiaries located across Italy. Colonies were sampled four times per year, {{in order to assess}} the health status and to collect samples for pathogen, chemical and pollen analyses. The prevalence of Nosema ceranae ranged, on average, from 47 - 69 % in 2009 and from 30 - 60 % in 2010, with strong seasonal variation. Virus prevalence was higher in 2010 than in 2009. The most widespread viruses were BQCV, DWV and SBV. The most frequent pesticides in all hive contents were organophosphates and pyrethroids such as coumaphos and <b>tau-fluvalinate.</b> Beeswax was the most frequently contaminated hive product, with 40 % of samples positive and 13 % having multiple residues, while 27 % of bee-bread and 12 % of honey bee samples were contaminated. Colony losses in 2009 / 10 were on average 19 %, with no major differences between regions of Italy. In 2009, the presence of DWV in autumn was positively correlated with colony losses. Similarly, hive mortality was higher in BQCV infected colonies in the first and second visits of the year. In 2010, colony losses were significantly related to the presence of pesticides in honey bees during the second sampling period. Honey bee exposure to poisons in spring could have a negative impact at the colony level, contributing to increase colony mortality during the beekeeping season. In both 2009 and 2010, colony mortality rates were positively related to the percentage of agricultural land surrounding apiaries, supporting the importance of land use for honey bee health...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} by greenhouse producers that adding sugar to a stomach poison insecticide enhances {{the efficacy of the}} insecticide in controlling western flower thrips (Frankliniella occidentalis). As such, a series of laboratory, including no-choice and multiple-choice assays, and greenhouse experiments were conducted to determine if adding sugar-based compounds to insecticides enhances efficacy against western flower thrips. The sugar-based compounds evaluated were Mountain Dew, Diet Mountain Dew, white sugar, and brown sugar at two rates [initial (0. 18 mL/ 100 mL and 0. 12 g/ 100 mL) and high (0. 36 mL/ 100 mL and 0. 24 g/ 100 mL) ]. A water control was also included in all the assays. In the laboratory experiments, western flower thrips adults and nymphs were not attracted to any of the sugar-based compounds with < 60 s (out of 300 s total) spent in any of the treatments, and ≤ 29 s (out of 300 s total) spent in the treatments when the sugar-based compounds were mixed with three insecticides (<b>tau-fluvalinate,</b> pyridalyl, and spinosad). In the greenhouse experiments, the addition of the high rate of Mountain Dew (0. 36 mL/ 100 mL) and brown sugar (0. 24 g/ 100 mL) did not enhance the efficacy (based on percent mortality) of the insecticides against western flower thrips. There {{was no significant difference between}} the individual insecticide treatments and the mixtures with either Mountain Dew or brown sugar. This study is the first to quantitatively demonstrate that western flower thrips adults and nymphs are not attracted to sugar-based compounds and that it is not warranted to add these types of materials to spray solutions targeted for control of western flower thrips...|$|E
40|$|Risk {{assessment}} {{of the impact of}} diseases of bees and bee brood of bees on products concerning risk assessment mainly on honey, wax, propolis, royal jelly and bee venom. At the same time, {{it should be noted that}} morbidity bees, has a negative impact on the number of population of bee colonies in Slovakia but also on agricultural production and the environment (rapid reduction of pollinated plants and the consequent reduction in crop yields per hectare). American foulbrood, European foulbrood, Varroa mite, Tracheal mite, Tropilaelaps mite and Small hive beetle are the diseases (possibly pests of bees), causing huge financial losses due to the death of bee colonies. The greatest risk of health issues hives is the use of medications in the prevetion and treatment of dangerous diseases of bees and bee brood. While at the national level and at EU can not use antibiotics and sulfonamides or in the prevention and even treatment, in many other countries in the world it is common practice the use of these drugs in beehives. Subsequent import of honey from these countries to the EU are at risk of honeys on the market for residues of antibiotics and sulfonamides. The situation is different when using acaricidal drugs to control Varroa mite, because treatment is mandatory and necessary to maintain relatively good health bee colonies. However, there are also the occurrence of residues acaricidal substances in honey, which is only set MRLs for amitraz and <b>tau-fluvalinate</b> (substances used in the Slovak Republic). By using these products is a risk of their residues in honey consumption and the risk of end-users...|$|E
40|$|Varroa destructor, a key biotic {{threat to}} the Western honey bee, has {{played a major role}} in colony losses over the past few years worldwide. Overuse of {{traditional}} acaricides, such as <b>tau-fluvalinate</b> and flumethrin, on V. destructor has only increased its tolerance to them. Therefore, the application of essential oils in place of traditional pesticides is an attractive alternative, as demonstrated by its high efficiency, lack of residue and tolerance resistance. To study the acaricidal activity of essential oils, we used clove oil (Syzygium aromaticum L.), a typical essential oil with a wide range of field applications, and examined its effects on the enzyme activities of Ca 2 +-Mg 2 +-ATPase, glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) and its effects on the water-soluble protein content of V. destructor body extracts after exposure to 0. 1  μl and 1. 0  μl of clove oil for 30  min. Our results showed that the water-soluble protein content significantly decreased after the treatments, indicating that the metabolism of the mites was adversely affected. The bioactivity of GSTs increased significantly after a low dosage (0. 1  μl) exposure but decreased at a higher dosage (1. 0  μl), while the activities of SOD and Ca 2 +-Mg 2 +-ATPase were significantly elevated after treatments. These results suggest that the protective enzyme SOD and detoxifying enzymes Ca 2 +-Mg 2 +-ATPase and GST contributed to the stress reaction of V. destructor to the essential oils and that the detoxification ability of V. destructor via GST was inhibited at higher dosages. Our findings are conducive to understanding the physiological reactions of V. destructor to treatment with essential oils and the underlying mechanisms behind the acaricidal activities of these natural products...|$|E
40|$|The {{literary}} part of {{the thesis}} describes biology, economic importance and methods of chemical protection against pollen beetle, cabbage seed weevil and cabbage stem flea beetle. The resistance of these pests against zoocides in the Czech republic and {{in some parts of}} neighbour European countries is decribed and principles of antiresistance strategies are outlined. Each group of insecticides is describd and their active components are rated in the practical {{part of the}} thesis. Findings about pest resistance are summarized - resistance types and mechanisms in particular. Then monitoring of resistent populations of plant pests are described. New findings concerning the resistance of three oilseed rape pests were acquired using biological methods. For cabage seed weevil six areas were evaluated, for pollen beetle seven and for cabbage stem flea beetle two areas were evaluated. All the evaluated areas are in the Czech republic. The adult-vial test number 11, nr. 25, nr. 27 accordinng to IRAC methodology and topical aplication test were used to rate the resistance. The efficiency of five pyrethroids (deltamethrin, lambda-cyhalothrin, esfenvalerate, etofenprox, <b>tau-fluvalinate,</b> cypermethrin), one organophosphate (chlorpyrifos - cabbage stem flea beetle only) and one oxadiazin (indoxacarb) in different concentrations were rated. The mortality of the pests was rated 24 hours after active component functioning for pollen beetle and cabbage seed weevil and after 48 hours for cabage stem flea beetle. Then lethal concentration LC 50 and LC 95 values were assessed. For ppollen beetle, the resistance against pyrethroids was confirmed with the exception, the effect of neonicotinoids was variable, acetamiprid and thiacloprid showed reduced efficiency in populations of some areas. Assessed populations of cabbage seed weevil and cabbage stem flea beetle were very sensitive to pyrethroids, but neonicotinoids showed insufficient efficiency. The indoxacarb sensitivity of pollen beetle and cabbage stem flea beetle was high...|$|E
40|$|Acaricides {{are used}} to treat honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) colonies to control the {{parasitic}} Varroa mite (Varroa destructor Anderson 2 ̆ 6 Trueman), a worldwide threat to honey bee health. As such, these compounds act as drugs to mitigate bee losses but may also stress the bees. This dissertation quantifies differences between queen and worker tolerance of five acaricides and clarifies the honey bee mechanism of tolerance for coumaphos. Selected acaricides were topically applied to adult queen and worker bees to generate dose-response curves and LD 50 s. Twenty-four hours after treatment, queens were 3 -times more tolerant of <b>tau-fluvalinate</b> and 6 -times more tolerant of thymol than workers when adjusted for body weight differences between workers (108 mg) and queens (180 mg). Queens survived the highest administered doses of fenpyroximate (1620 μg/g) and coumaphos (2700 μg/g) indicating that queens are at least 12 -fold more tolerant of coumaphos and at least 40 -fold more tolerant of fenpyroximate than workers. However, queens treated with as little as 54 μg/g of fenpyroximate exhibited reduced survival over 6 weeks following treatment. Amitraz was the only acaricide tested for which queens were not more tolerant than workers. Differences between queen and worker tolerance of coumaphos was explored further by topical bioassays with the metabolite coumaphos oxon. Coumaphos oxon was only half as toxic as the parent compound to Apis mellifera. This insensitivity to both coumaphos and coumaphos oxon is unique as both castes were highly susceptible to chlorpyrifos, with chlorpyrifos oxon being twice as toxic as the parent compound. Using Ellman’s assay, honey bee and house fly acetylcholinesterase were all shown to be similarly inhibited by both chlorpyrifos oxon and coumaphos oxon. Target site insensitivity is therefore not the mechanism of honey bee tolerance. Finally, bee metabolism was compared using GC/MS and LC-MS/MS at 24 hr time intervals for 5 days. Most notably, coumaphos oxon was not found. Queen and worker acetone rinse and worker internal recovered coumaphos concentrations decreased over time. Therefore, coumaphos is likely being metabolized to a less toxic coumaphos metabolite. Caste differences are likely due to metabolism, but further {{studies are needed to}} determine specific mechanisms. Advisors: Marion Ellis 2 ̆ 6 Blair Siegfrie...|$|E
40|$|The {{toxicity}} of pesticides used in agriculture towards non-targeted organisms and especially pollinators has recently drawn the attention from a broad scientific community. Increased honeybee mortality observed worldwide certainly contributes to this interest. The potential role of several neurotoxic insecticides in triggering or potentiating honeybee mortality was considered, in particular phenylpyrazoles and neonicotinoids, given that they are widely used and highly toxic for insects. Along with their ability to kill insects at lethal doses, they can compromise survival at sublethal doses by producing subtle deleterious effects. In this study, we compared the bee's locomotor ability, which is crucial for many tasks within the hive (e. g. cleaning brood cells, feeding larvae…), before and after an acute sublethal exposure to one insecticide belonging to the two insecticide classes, fipronil and thiamethoxam. Additionally, we examined the locomotor ability after exposure to pyrethroids, an older chemical insecticide class still widely used and known to be highly toxic to bees as well. Our study focused on young bees (day 1 after emergence) since (i) few studies are available on locomotion at this stage and (ii) in recent years, pesticides {{have been reported to}} accumulate in different hive matrices, where young bees undergo their early development. At sublethal doses (SLD 48 h, i. e. causing no mortality at 48 h), three pyrethroids, namely cypermethrin (2. 5 ng/bee), tetramethrin (70 ng/bee), <b>tau-fluvalinate</b> (33 ng/bee) and the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam (3. 8 ng/bee) caused a locomotor deficit in honeybees. While the SLD 48 h of fipronil (a phenylpyrazole, 0. 5 ng/bee) had no measurable effect on locomotion, we observed high mortality several days after exposure, an effect that was not observed with the other insecticides. Although locomotor deficits observed in the sublethal range of pyrethroids and thiamethoxam would suggest deleterious effects in the field, the case of fipronil demonstrates that toxicity evaluation requires information on multiple endpoints (e. g. long term survival) to fully address pesticides risks for honeybees. Pyrethroid-induced locomotor deficits are discussed in light of recent advances regarding their mode of action on honeybee ion channels and current structure-function studies...|$|E
