5|$|The {{drainage}} basin of Spring Brook is {{designated as a}} High-Quality Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery from its headwaters downstream to the Northeast Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike (Interstate 476). From that point downstream to its mouth, the {{drainage basin}} of the stream is designated as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. Wild trout naturally reproduce in Spring Brook from its headwaters downstream to its mouth. A 2.4-mile (4-kilometer) section of the stream from the Watres Dam downstream to the Nesbitt Reservoir is considered by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission to be Class A Wild Trout Waters for both brook <b>trout</b> <b>and</b> brown trout. The tributaries Green Run and Panther Creek are Class A Wild Trout Waters for brook <b>trout</b> <b>and</b> part of the tributary Rattlesnake Creek is Class A Wild Trout Waters for both brook <b>trout</b> <b>and</b> brown trout.|$|E

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. September 2014. Major: Conservation Biology. Advisors: Bruce Vondracek, Leonard Ferrington Jr. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); ix, 99 pages. Winter {{has traditionally been}} considered a period of dormancy for stream dwelling trout in temperate latitudes. Seasonal changes including low water temperatures, ice formation, and reduced prey availability from aquatic and terrestrial sources often contribute to reductions in <b>trout</b> growth <b>and</b> survival. Consequentially, winter has rarely {{been the focus of}} study by fisheries scientists, and relatively little information is available regarding stream trout during winter. However, because of the potential impact on stream <b>trout</b> growth <b>and</b> survival, winter is an important season for <b>trout</b> populations <b>and</b> of particular interest to fisheries managers. The goal of this dissertation was to examine winter trophic ecology of stream dwelling <b>trout</b> populations, <b>and</b> the potential of groundwater input to buffer stream water temperatures <b>and</b> <b>trout</b> from the environmental conditions typically associated with winter. This dissertation consists of three chapters that contribute towards this goal. The first chapter examines winter diet of Brown Trout by quantifying trout consumption, identifies important winter prey taxa, and compares diet composition among a number of trout populations. The second chapter describes Brown <b>Trout</b> winter growth <b>and</b> condition, and examines the influence of groundwater buffering <b>and</b> <b>trout</b> diet composition on growth and condition. The third and final chapter uses stable isotope analyses to examine seasonal variation in Brown <b>Trout</b> diets, <b>and</b> the position of trout within winter food webs of groundwater dominated streams. My dissertation will help managers predict the potential effects of winter on important recreational stream <b>trout</b> fisheries, <b>and</b> allow informed management decisions incorporating the best available information...|$|R

The reason for the disappearance of the blacknose dace is unknown. The pumpkinseeds were only present in the 1970s due to their escape from nearby farm ponds.|$|E
