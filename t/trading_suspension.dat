We also find that trading suspensions help to ameliorate the spread of market microstructure noise and price inefficiency across securities during falling markets but the reverse is true during rising markets.

However, because a microgrid typically has limited generation capability, a microgrid operator (MGO) has to take the risk of island operation into account in its market participation and generation scheduling to ensure efficient operation. In this paper, a microgrid islanding event is interpreted as a <b>trade</b> <b>suspension</b> of a contract, and a set of islanding rules is presented {{in the form of a}} market rule. The risk of island operation is evaluated by modeling the microgrid islanding stochastically using an islanding probability function, which is defined in the form of a conditional probability to reflect the influence of outside conditions. An optimal bidding strategy is obtained for the MGO by formulating and solving an optimization problem to minimize the expected operating cost. The effectiveness of the proposed method was investigated by numerical simulations in which the proposed method and two other methods were applied to the same microgrid. Numerical sensitivity analyses of the coefficients of the islanding probability function were conducted to determine how an MGO copes with changes in outside conditions. conditional probability; microgrid operator (MGO); microgrid islanding; operating cost; stochastic modelin...|$|R

40|$|We {{examine the}} effects of {{firm-specific}} trading suspensions triggered by price limit hits on three dimensions of market quality: trading activity, return volatility, and price efficiency. The empirical analysis is based on a sample of trading halts on the Italian market (Borsa Italiana) and compare the results under two <b>trading</b> <b>suspension</b> regimes. Our preliminary results reveal mixed evidence. Consistently with previous studies, we find unusually higher levels of both volume and volatility after the halt. Differently from previous studies, we find abnormally higher levels of volume prior to the halt. No significant effect has been found on price efficiency. The nonstandard procedure used by Borsa Italiana to halt trading in case of limit hits allows us to at least partially disentangle the effects of the trading halt itself from the effects {{of the way in which}} trading is halted and then resumed after the halt. Type 1 trading halts resume trading with a continuous market, while type 2 trading halts employs a batch call auction to restart trading after the suspension. By comparing type 1 and type 2 trading halts two main results arise. First, type 2 halts always show larger abnormal volume measures than type 1. Second, type 2 halts show lower post-halt abnormal volatility than type 1. This might be explained by the difference in the way the market restarts after the halt.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} intraday effects on market {{quality of a}} unique <b>trading</b> <b>suspension</b> {{mechanism}} {{in place at the}} Italian stock market (Borsa Italiana) in case of price limit hit. Specifically, when prices hit the limit, Borsa Italiana halts trading for 5 minutes ('freeze phase') and removes the order that caused the limit to be hit. If trading regularly resumes after the freeze phase, exchange officials make no other intervention and we call this sequence of events 'Type 1 ' halt (i. e., freeze-only halt). Alternatively, if a second limit hit occurs after the freeze phase, an intraday call auction replaces the continuous trading. We name this sequence 'Type 2 ' halt (i. e., intraday auction halt). We examine both the general effects of trading halts and the specific effects of Type 1 and Type 2 trading suspensions on three dimensions of market quality: trading activity, return volatility, and price discovery. The full sample results reveal mixed evidence about the usefulness of price limit hit trading halts: trading volume and return volatility after the halt are abnormally high (trading interference hypothesis for volume and spillover hypothesis for volatility), whereas prices converge towards equilibrium values (cool off hypothesis for price discovery). When we partition the sample by type of halt three main results arise. First, Type 2 halts always show larger abnormal volume measures than Type 1 and this indicates a greater interference on the normal trading process of Type 2 relative to Type 1 halts. Second, Type 2 halts show lower post-halt abnormal volatility than Type 1. This might be explained by the difference in the way the market restarts after the halt. The call auction procedure associated with Type 2 allows for wider information dissemination, whereas the price discovery process in Type 1 trading halts takes place only through the tâtonnement process in continuous trading. Third, for the price discovery process, the call auction reopening procedure of Type 2 halts also has a stronger cool off effect relative to the Type 1 continuous trading. ...|$|E

In fact, to the casual observer, it appears that anyone can trade any listed share {{at any time during the}} business day. However, this is not quite true. On average, the exchange suspends the trading of four common stocks every day. During these periods, the specialist does not trade and the exchange ceases to provide liquidity in the affected stocks. Three related questions arise: what motivates the exchange to call a suspension, what is the relationship between the “resiliency ” of the exchange- its ability to absorb severe volatility shocks- and other measures of liquidity, and has the “resiliency ” of the exchange improved over time. The goal of this paper is to address these three questions. Why is trade in an individual stock sometimes suspended? This is an important question because...|$|R

50|$|In {{reaction}} to the numerous labour conflicts across Romania {{during the summer of}} 1920, the government adopted in September a new labour law, which severely curtailed the power of the trade unions. At the same time, the heavy-handed response of the authorities to the strikes (which included deployment of army units, militarisation of factories, official censorship. and even armed confrontation) left the working class increasingly disgruntled. The problem of formal unification of the socialist parties and trade unions was thus further postponed, in order to concentrate on the new issue.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines, both theoretically and empirically, {{the effects}} of international policies, especially of sanctions, on conflicts. In theoretical analysis, we consider conflicts (both civil and inter-state) related to natural resources and examine how sanctions on natural resource exports affect the intensity of conflicts. However, for the empirical analysis, we consider only the civil conflicts and examine how international sanctions affect the duration of civil conflicts. In chapter 1, we develop a two-period general equilibrium model {{on the relationship between}} natural resources and civil conflicts. Contrary to the most of the existing literature, we assume that resource extraction and wage rate are endogenous during the conflict. We find that {{the effects of}} current international sanctions on civil conflict depend critically on whether the budget constraints of the warring groups are binding or non-binding, and whether wage rate is exogenous or endogenous. Under both binding and non-binding budgets, the current sanction can be counter-productive. However, a threat of future sanction reduces conflict intensity, when the budget constraint is non-binding. An improvement in agricultural productivity may also limit the conflict. Our results also suggest that the most effective policy for conflict resolution would be bilateral piece-meal reduction in war efforts. Chapter 2 develops a two-period general equilibrium model linking natural resources to inter-state conflict, treating resource extraction and wage rate are endogenous. First, we characterize the war equilibrium and derive a number of properties of it. Second, we examine the effects of different types of trade sanctions imposed by the international community on war efforts of the two countries. We find that a temporary current sanction on both countries, or even on one of the countries, will be counter-productive, and an anticipated future sanction on both countries will unambiguously reduce war intensity. Whether an anticipated future sanction on one of countries will reduce war intensity will depend on the level of resource stock; the effect of a permanent sanction on both countries is ambiguous: war intensities will fall only if the resource stocks of the countries are sufficiently high. Finally, in chapter 3, we examine empirically the effects of international sanctions on the expected duration of civil conflicts. Contrary to the most of the previous findings, we find that sanctions reduce the expected duration of civil conflicts. Our finding is robust for different controls, different parametric models, and with consideration of endogeneity of sanctions. However, not all types of sanction are equally successful in shortening conflicts. Total economic embargoes and arms sanctions are effective, but <b>trade</b> sanctions, aid <b>suspension,</b> and other sanctions do not work. We also find that both multi-lateral and unilateral sanctions (mainly US sanctions) can reduce duration of civil wars...|$|R
