500|$|Kubrick {{credited}} {{the ease}} with which he photographed scenes to his early years as a photographer. He rarely added camera instructions in the script, preferring <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> <b>that</b> after a scene is created, as the visual part of film-making came easiest to him. Even in deciding which props and settings would be used, Kubrick paid meticulous attention to detail and tried to collect as much background material as possible, functioning rather like what he described as [...] "a detective". Cinematographer John Alcott, who worked closely with Kubrick on four of his films, and won an Oscar for Best Cinematography on Barry Lyndon, remarked that Kubrick [...] "questions everything", and was involved in the technical aspects of film-making including camera placement, scene composition, choice of lens, and even operating the camera which would usually be left to the cinematographer. Alcott considered Kubrick to be the [...] "nearest thing to genius I've ever worked with, with all the problems of a genius".|$|E

2500|$|For {{periodic}} functions, {{both the}} Fourier transform and the DTFT comprise only a discrete set of frequency components (Fourier series), and the transforms diverge at those frequencies. One common practice (not discussed above) is <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> <b>that</b> divergence via Dirac delta and Dirac comb functions. But the same spectral {{information can be}} discerned from just one cycle of the periodic function, since all the other cycles are identical. Similarly, finite-duration functions can be represented as a Fourier series, with no actual loss of information except that the periodicity of the inverse transform is a mere artifact. We also note {{that none of the}} formulas here require the duration of s(â€¢) to be limited to the period, [...] or [...] But that is a common situation, in practice.|$|E

Bud Smithers is the guy <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> <b>that</b> kid. You ought to see him take hold of a dog that's all grouch and ugliness and make it over into a dog that it's a pleasure to have around. I thought a few weeks with Bud was what the doctor ordered for Ogden, and Miss Ann guessed I was right, so we had it all framed. And now this happens and balls everything up! She can't do nothing with a husky kid like that without me to help her. And how am I going to help her if I'm not allowed in the house?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{told me you}} {{had found}} time in the press of all yours to say you would," [...] Nick replied. And this was pretty much all that had passed on the subject between them--save of course her {{immediately}} making clear that Peter had grossly misinformed him. What had happened {{was that she had}} said she would do nothing of the sort. She professed a desire not to be confronted again with this obnoxious theme, and Nick easily fell in with it--quite from his own settled inclination not <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> <b>that</b> kind of subject with her. If Julia had false ideas about him, and if Peter had them too, his part of the business was to take the simplest course to establish the falsity. There were difficulties indeed attached even to the simplest course, but there would be a difficulty the less if one should forbear to meddle in promiscuous talk with the general, suggestive topic of intimate unions. It is certain that in these days Nick cultivated the practice of forbearances for which he didn't receive, for which perhaps he never would receive, due credit.|$|E
6000|$|I had {{intended}} [...] "The Adventure of the Abbey Grange" [...] {{to be the}} last of those exploits of my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, which I should ever communicate to the public. This resolution of mine was not due to any lack of material, since I have notes of many hundreds of cases to which I have never alluded, nor was it caused by any waning interest on the part of my readers in the singular personality and unique methods of this remarkable man. The real reason lay in the reluctance which Mr. Holmes has shown to the continued publication of his experiences. So long as he was in actual professional practice the records of his successes were of some practical value to him, but since he has definitely retired from London and betaken himself to study and bee-farming on the Sussex Downs, notoriety has become hateful to him, and he has peremptorily requested that his wishes in this matter should be strictly observed. It was only upon my representing to him that I had given a promise that [...] "The Adventure of the Second Stain" [...] should be published when the times were ripe, and pointing out to him that it is only appropriate that this long series of episodes should culminate in the most important international case which he has ever been called upon <b>to</b> <b>handle,</b> <b>that</b> I at last succeeded in obtaining his consent that a carefully guarded account of the incident should at last be laid before the public. If in telling the story I seem to be somewhat vague in certain details, the public will readily understand that there is an excellent reason for my reticence.|$|E

50|$|An {{object in}} {{object-oriented}} language {{is essentially a}} record that contains procedures specialized <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> <b>that</b> record; and object types are an elaboration of record types.
