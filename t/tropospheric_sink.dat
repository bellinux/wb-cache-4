The observed ratio between these products as a function of the Cl- concentration in the aerosol cannot be explained from simply two competing reactions.

40|$|In situ {{measurements}} of atmospheric methane concentrations {{begun in the}} early 1980 s show decadal trends, as well as large interannual variations, in growth rate. Recent research indicates that while wetlands can explain several of the large growth anomalies for individual years, the decadal trend may be the combined effect of increasing sinks, due to increases in tropospheric OH, and stabilizing sources. We discuss new 20 -year histories of annual, global source strengths for all major methane sources, i. e., natural wetlands, rice cultivation, ruminant animals, landfills, fossil fuels, and biomass burning, and present estimates of the temporal pattern of the sink required to reconcile these sources and atmospheric concentrations over the time period. Analysis of the individual emission sources, together with model-derived estimates of the OH sink strength, indicates that {{the growth rate of}} atmospheric methane observed over the last 20 years can only be explained by a combination of changes in source emissions and an increasing <b>tropospheric</b> <b>sink...</b>|$|E

Their application {{to the study of}} atmospheric convection, however, is challenged by the complexity and nonlinearity of diabatic processes. Herein, the adjoint of a significantly sim-pler parameterized moisture (PM) model is described and tested. The PM model eliminates explicit moisture by making latent heating conditionally proportional to updraft velocity and providing a lower <b>tropospheric</b> heat <b>sink</b> mimicking rainwater evaporation. The PM adjoint, of course, is useful only if the parameterization can produce realistic results. Earlier work suggested that the PM framework possessed a fundamental flaw that made its storms have an excessive impact on their upstream environments. In fact, the adjoint was used to identify the origin of the discrepancies between PM and traditional cloud model storms, thereby leading to the parameterization improvements and dynamical insights recently discussed in Fovell (2002). The present paper is a companion to that study, describing how the adjoint model was constructed, tested and utilized. In addition, an even more realistic adjoint framework is described. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{eruption}} of Mount Pinatubo in 1991 injected {{a large amount}} of SO 2 into the stratosphere, which formed sulfate aerosols. Increased scattering and absorption of UV radiation by the enhanced stratospheric SO 2 and aerosols decreased the amount of UV radiation reaching the troposphere, causing changes in tropospheric photochemistry. These changes affected the oxidizing capacity of the atmosphere and the removal rate of CH 4 in the years following the eruption. We use the three-dimensional chemistry transport model TM 5 coupled to the aerosol microphysics module M 7 to simulate the evolution of SO 2 and sulfate aerosols from the Pinatubo eruption. Their effect on tropospheric photolysis frequencies and concentrations of OH and CH 4 is quantified for the first time. We find that UV attenuation by stratospheric sulfur decreased the photolysis frequencies of both ozone and NO 2 by about 2 % globally, decreasing global OH concentrations by a similar amount in the first 2 years after the eruption. SO 2 absorption mainly affects OH primary production by ozone photolysis, while aerosol scattering also alters OH recycling. The effect of stratospheric sulfur on global OH and CH 4 is dominated by the effect of aerosol extinction, while SO 2 absorption contributes by 12. 5 % to the overall effect in the first year after the eruption. The reduction in OH concentrations causes an increase in the CH 4 growth rate of 4 and 2 ppb/yr in the first and second years after the eruption, respectively, contributing 11 Tg to the 27 Tg observed CH 4 burden change in late 1991 and early 1992.

40|$|The {{effects on}} the {{atmospheric}} circulation imposed by El Nino-induced SST-forcing (''El Nino-forcing''), by volcanic dust induced stratospheric heating and reduction of solar radiation (''volcanic forcing'') and {{by a combination of}} both are investigated using permanent January runs of the low-resolution (T 21) ECHAM 2 -GCM. Considering zonally averaged quantities related to the atmospheric energy cycle, we find two features that are unique for the forcings: the Hadley circulation is increased with El Nino-forcing present, and the stratospheric jet of the winter hemisphere is increased with volcanic forcing. Combined forcing produces both anomalies simultaneously. Other anomaly structures are excited no matter which forcing is active, and it is mostly the local anomaly amplitudes that vary. Thus, the other zonal mean anomalies are not suitable for a separation of signals. One of the features common to both forcings is an increase of heat transports by stationary eddies. It causes <b>sinking</b> <b>tropospheric</b> temperatures at 30 N. It is in contrast to expectations from linear model studies that this modification of the stationary waves is associated with opposing stratospheric wind anomalies. In accordance with the reduced temperature gradients poleward of 30 N, local contributions to baroclinic energy conversions by transient eddies are smaller than in the control run. This means that, with respect to the zonal mean temperature signal, the transient eddies are counteracting the anomaly imposed by the stationary eddies. (orig.)

40|$|International audienceLittle {{is known}} about how the methane source {{inventory}} and sinks have evolved over recent centuries. New and detailed records of methane mixing ratio and isotopic composition (12 CH 4, 13 CH 4 and 14 CH 4) from analyses of air trapped in polar ice and firn can enhance this knowledge. We use existing bottom-up constructions of the source history, including "EDGAR"-based constructions, as inputs to {{a model of the}} evolving global budget for methane and for its carbon isotope composition through the 20 th century. By matching such budgets to atmospheric data, we examine the constraints imposed by isotope information on those budget evolutions. Reconciling both 12 CH 4 and 13 CH 4 budgets with EDGAR-based source histories requires a combination of: a greater proportion of emissions from biomass burning and/or of fossil methane than EDGAR constructions suggest; a greater contribution from natural such emissions than is commonly supposed; and/or a significant role for active chlorine or other highly-fractionating <b>tropospheric</b> <b>sink</b> as has been independently proposed. Examining a companion budget evolution for 14 CH 4 exposes uncertainties in inferring the fossil-methane source from atmospheric 14 CH 4 data. Specifically, methane evolution during the nuclear era is sensitive to the cycling dynamics of "bomb 14 C" (originating from atmospheric weapons tests) through the biosphere. In addition, since ca. 1970, direct production and release of 14 CH 4 from nuclear-power facilities is influential but poorly quantified. Atmospheric 14 CH 4 determinations in the nuclear era have the potential to better characterize both biospheric carbon cycling, from photosynthesis to methane synthesis, and the nuclear-power source...|$|E
40|$|Nitrous oxide (N₂O) is {{a potent}} {{greenhouse}} gas and the major ozone depleting substance in the stratosphere. One major source of N₂O is incomplete denitrification, whereas the only known <b>tropospheric</b> <b>sink</b> of N₂O is the microbial enzyme nitrous oxide reductase. Denitrification {{is defined as the}} stepwise reduction of nitrite to dinitrogen via nitric oxide and N₂O by facultative anaerobic microorganisms. This thesis aims to elucidate the phylogenetic diversity of the N₂O reductase encoding gene nosZ and its context in microbial genomes in relation to other genes in the denitrification pathway, as well as the relative influence of plants and soil on the activity, abundance and structure of N₂O-reducing communities in the rhizosphere. Phylogenetic analysis of publicly available nosZ gene sequences revealed that its genetic diversity is divided into two distinct clades termed clade I and clade II, the latter having not been accounted for in previous studies. Newly developed molecular tools revealed that it is abundant {{in a wide range of}} environments. Analysis of microbial genomes showed that co-occurrence patterns of nosZ with other denitrification genes were neither randomly distributed among taxonomic units nor among habitats. Many genomes had truncated pathways as organisms possessing nosZII often lacked other genes involved in denitrification, suggesting these organisms may act as N₂O-sinks in the environment. Pot experiments with sunflower and barley indicated a niche differentiation between the two nosZ gene variants, as nosZI showed an affinity for plant roots while nosZII was more abundant in the surrounding soil. However, denitrification and N₂O-production activity in soil were controlled by edaphic factors. Moreover, an intercropping experiment with cocksfoot and lucerne showed that intercropping had a negative influence on nosZII abundances on cocksfoot roots which in conjunction with phylogenetic placement of sequencing reads indicated the presence of organisms with only nosZ lacking a denitrification pathway. In conclusion, the development of new molecular tools combined with comparative genomic analysis sheds new light on the ecology of biological N₂O reduction in the rhizosphere...|$|E

Dazu wurden 3 Groessenklassen - nucleus-mode, accumulation-mode und coarse-mode - ausgewaehlt, weil fuer diese typische mikrophysikalische und optische Eigenschaften gelten. In dem Modul werden die in der Troposphaere wichtigen Senkenprozesse wie trockene Deposition, Sedimentation, Rainout, Washout und Koagulation parameterisiert. Es gibt eine groessere trockene Deposition ueber Wald. Fuer das Rainout wurde eine Parameterisierung ausgewaehlt, die den Wolkendeckungsgrad miteinbezieht. Das Auswaschen durch Niederschlag (Washout) haengt von der Niederschlagsrate im Modell, der Teilchenzahldichte und der Kollisionseffizienz ab. Die von der Teilchenzahldichte abhaengige Koagulation beschreibt die Wechselwirkung zwischen den Groessenklassen. Die durchgefuehrten Simulationen bestaetigen, dass in jeder Groessenklasse ein anderer Senkenprozess dominiert; fuer den nucleus-mode die Koagulation, fuer den accumulation-mode das Rainout und fuer den coarse-mode die trockene Deposition. (orig. /GL) The {{aerosol particle}} module APMO for parametrisation of the microphysics of aerosol particles {{was developed for}} calculating space- and time-variable tropospheric aerosol particle fields. As the first application of APMO, global natural aerosol particle fields of three size modes were calculated interactively in the climate model. The three size modes - nucleus mode, accumulation mode and coarse mode - were selected because of their typical microphysical and optical properties. In the module, the <b>tropospheric</b> <b>sink</b> processes - dry deposition, sedimentation, rainout, washout and coagulation -are parametrized. Dry deposition is more pronounced over forest terrain. In the case of rainout, the selected parametrisation takes account of the cloud cover. Washout {{is a function of}} the precipitation rate in the model, the particle density and the collision efficiency. The interdependence between the size modes is decribed by coagulation, which is a function of particle density. The simulations prove that each size mode is dominated by a different sink process: Coagulation is dominant in the case of nucleus mode, rainout in the case of accumulation mode, and dry deposition for coarse mode.

40|$|Events {{involving}} stratosphere-troposphere exchange (STE) of ozone, such as tropopause folds and westerly ducts, {{are readily}} identified in observations and models, but a quantitative flux specifying {{where and when}} stratospheric ozone is mixed into the troposphere is not readily discerned from either. This work presents a new diagnostic based on determining when stratospheric air is mixed and diluted down to tropospheric abundances (< 100 ppb) and hence effectively participates in tropospheric chemistry. The method is applied to two years of high-resolution, global meteorological fields (1. 9 degrees, 40 levels) from the ECMWF forecast model derived by U. Oslo for chemistry transport modeling and used in TRACE-P studies. The UCI CTM is run here with linearized stratospheric ozone chemistry (Linoz) and a parameterized <b>tropospheric</b> <b>sink.</b> In terms of events, the CTM accurately follows a March 2001 westerly duct stratospheric intrusion into the tropical eastern Pacific as observed by TOMS and calculates a 48 -hour burst of STE O 3 flux for that region. The influx associated with the event (0. 3 Tg) is {{much less than the}} anomalous amount seen as an isolated island in column ozone (1. 7 Tg). A climatology of monthly mean STE fluxes is similar for both years (January to December 1997 and May 2000 to April 2001), but the warm phase of ENSO December 1997 is distinctly different from the cold phase of ENSO month December 2000. Global ozone fluxes are about 515 Tg (year 1997) and 550 Tg (year 2000 / 2001) with an equal amount into each hemisphere, and larger springtime fluxes for both hemispheres. In terms of geographical distribution, Northern Hemisphere regions of high ozone flux follow the jet streams over the oceans in the winter and over the continents in the summer, in agreement with many previous studies. In contrast, we find the largest STE flux is located in the subtropics during late spring, particularly over the Tibetan Plateau in May. This hot spot of STE is not a numerical artifact, it occurs in both meteorological years, and it appears to be caused by the rapid erosion of the tropopause. Ozone fluxes in the Southern Hemisphere have less variability (either temporal or spatial), and they occur mainly in the subtropical region (25 °S– 35 °S) regardless of season. The poles, throughout the year, show minimal STE O 3 flux...|$|E
