In the Battle of Cape Finisterre, Anson won a decisive victory, but Grenville was among the casualties. He had been hit by a large splinter two hours into the engagement, which smashed his left thigh. The leg was at once amputated, but Grenville succumbed to his wounds five hours later. His body was returned to England, where George Lyttelton wrote that the joy of the victory [...] "is palled <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>family</b> by the loss of poor Captain Grenville, {{one of the most promising}} young men in the navy, and who, had he lived, would have been an honour not to his family only, but to his country."

They make reference to various Harry Potter objects, such as the Mirror of Erised and the Patronus Charm. The lyrics are generally mocking and condescending towards Harry, Ron, and others. BostonNOW asked the band if Ross ever had [...] "any anti-fans at your shows?" [...] Ross replied: [...] "Never.
