5|$|President Warren G. Harding visited Fairbanks in 1923 {{as part of}} a trip <b>to</b> <b>hammer</b> in the {{ceremonial}} final spike of the railroad at Nenana. The rail yards of the Tanana Valley Railroad were converted for use by the Alaska Railroad, and Fairbanks became the northern end of the line and its second-largest depot.|$|E
5|$|Across the German Empire nagelfiguren, war {{memorials}} {{made from}} iron nails embedded in wood, became popular, particularly in Austria. These took various forms, including knights, shields, eagles and crosses, {{as well as}} submarines. This practice had medieval origins, and the memorials were reinforced by the promotion of burgfrieden during the war, a medieval pact in which disparate German communities would put aside their differences during a conflict. In some cases, relatives of the deceased were encouraged <b>to</b> <b>hammer</b> memorial nails in {{as part of the}} ceremonies, while children might be encouraged to read out poems in a medieval style. At some nagelfiguren a charge was made for each nail used, with the revenues donated to charities supporting soldiers, orphans and others affected by the conflict.|$|E
50|$|The {{technological}} feature which distinguishes Shang bronzes {{from those}} found {{elsewhere in the}} world is the technique of casting as opposed <b>to</b> <b>hammering.</b> Casting was a far more extravagant technique compared <b>to</b> <b>hammering,</b> and required both abundant mineral resources and organisation of labour.|$|R

5|$|Case No. 5 were {{light bulbs}} that {{represented}} {{the state of}} the art of filament lamps from 1900 to 1913. They show electric lights using certain gases within the sealed bulb. They were directing a path of technology into 'cold light.' One of these was a long tube instead of a globe. It had a stop cock in the center and a glass bulb at each end. Hammer explained how this one came about. He said one day in 1902 he visited Pierre Curie, the husband of Madam Curie. Professor Curie drew a diagram on the blackboard and suggested that Hammer make a lamp like that with sulfide of zinc inside. Curie explained <b>to</b> <b>Hammer</b> what radium gaseous could do in this configuration. It would stimulate luminescence that would produce light without a hot filament involved.|$|E
5|$|Tromp on Christianus Quintus, Vice Admiral Jens Rodsten on Tre Løver and Niels Juel on Churprindsen took {{advantage}} of the chaos. They quickly surrounded Svärdet and three supporting ships (Hieronymus, Neptunus and Järnvågen, an armed merchantman) and began <b>to</b> <b>hammer</b> them into submission. Several other Swedish vessels attempted to assist Uggla, but they were in a lee position and could not provide effective support. After about an hour-and-a-half to two hours of hard fighting Svärdets mainmast went overboard and Uggla had to surrender to Tromp. Despite this, Svärdet was ignited by accident or misunderstanding by the Dutch fireship t Hoen. The second largest Swedish ship after Kronan sank in the blaze and took with it 600 out of a crew of 650, including Admiral Uggla himself. Only Hieronymus escaped the assault by the allied admirals, though badly damaged, and the others were captured by Juel on Churprindsen together with one of his lieutenants on Anna Sophia.|$|E
5|$|Royall and Marbury envisaged {{nuclear energy}} being {{controlled}} by experts, {{with a minimum}} of political interference. The commissioners would be appointed for indefinite terms, and the President's power to remove them would be limited. They would be supported by four advisory boards, for military applications, industrial uses, research and medicine, the membership of which would be restricted to those with technical qualifications. Day-to-day running of the organization would {{be in the hands of}} an administrator and his deputy. The Royall–Marbury Bill was reviewed by the Interim Committee at its July 19 meeting and revised in line with their suggestions. After the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki lifted the veil of secrecy surrounding the Manhattan Project, Royall and Marbury were able to consult with the Attorney General, the Judge Advocate General and the Office of Scientific Research and Development. The draft was sent to the President in August for circulation among, and comment from, affected government agencies. Only the State Department had objections, on the basis that it was still involved in trying <b>to</b> <b>hammer</b> out an international agreement on nuclear energy.|$|E

25|$|This {{legend has}} since {{proven to be}} false {{by virtue of the}} fact that these ratios are only {{relevant}} to string length (such as the string of a monochord), and not <b>to</b> <b>hammer</b> weight. However, it may be that Pythagoras was indeed responsible for discovering the properties of string length.|$|E
25|$|On {{their return}} from Rome in 856 Æthelwulf was deposed {{by his son}} Æthelbald. With civil war looming the magnates of the realm met in council <b>to</b> <b>hammer</b> out a compromise. Æthelbald would retain the western shires (i.e. {{historical}} Wessex), and Æthelwulf would rule in the east. When King Æthelwulf died in 858 Wessex was ruled by three of Alfred's brothers in succession: Æthelbald, Æthelberht and Æthelred.|$|E

25|$|The Medical College Hospital {{board of}} {{trustees}} then met secretly {{with a small group}} of strike leaders <b>to</b> <b>hammer</b> out an agreement. After 99 days of protest, a compromise was reached. Because South Carolina was a right-to-work state, the hospital did not feel compelled to recognize the union. But the administration did rehire the fired workers, created a credit union for hospital employees, and instituted a six-point grievance system.|$|E

25|$|The problem—which also {{exists in}} the State Senate—can be boiled down to a single {{overarching}} issue: The Assembly speaker has too much power. He controls everything, from the legislation that can be voted on to how his normally docile members vote on it. He decides what the Assembly will accept in a state budget. He negotiates secretly {{with the other two}} leaders <b>to</b> <b>hammer</b> out important, expensive and far-reaching laws. And he ignores the wishes of less-exalted lawmakers.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, Manser and {{his friend}} Jacques Christinet {{travelled}} to Brunei and swam across the 300-metre wide Limbang river at night. Manser's friend was almost fatally injured by drifting logs along the river. They spent 3 weeks in Sarawak hiding from the police. During that time period, they attempted to order four tons of 25-centimeter nails for the Penan tribe <b>to</b> <b>hammer</b> into the tree trunks. These nails could have caused serious injuries to the loggers when the embedded nails inevitably {{came into contact with}} chainsaws.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} morning, the bear inexplicably begins <b>to</b> <b>hammer</b> away at iron. He's roaring loudly, {{almost as if}} in song, and no one understands why. However, the men join him and, in essence, lose {{themselves}} in the hard work. Prushevsky does not follow suit. A girl asks him to teach her knowledge, and he leaves the worksite with her. The activist receives {{a letter from the}} Soviet government stating that any peasants who seem too willing to have their property collectivized should be treated with suspicion as undercover agents.|$|E
50|$|Despite its nominal Canadian setting, {{exterior}} filming for Never Take Sweets from a Stranger {{took place}} at Black Park in Wexham, Buckinghamshire.

25|$|They {{applied for}} a federal charter for the {{foundation}} in the US Senate in 1910, with at one stage Junior even secretly meeting with President William Howard Taft, through the aegis of Senator Nelson Aldrich, <b>to</b> <b>hammer</b> out concessions. However, because of the ongoing (1911) antitrust suit against Standard Oil at the time, along with deep suspicion in some quarters of undue Rockefeller influence on the spending of the endowment, the end result was that Senior and Gates withdrew the bill from Congress in order to seek a state charter.|$|E
25|$|Brown-headed nuthatches (Sitta pusilla) {{have been}} {{observed}} to methodically use bark pieces to remove other flakes of bark from a tree. The birds insert the bark piece underneath an attached bark scale, using it like a wedge and lever, to expose hiding insects. Occasionally, they reuse the same piece of bark several times and sometimes even fly short distances carrying the bark flake in their beak. The evolutionary origin of this tool use {{might be related to}} these birds frequently wedging seeds into cracks in the bark <b>to</b> <b>hammer</b> them open with their beak, which can lead to bark coming off.|$|E
25|$|All {{the iron}} and {{machinery}} {{had to be}} packed in by mule overland, and a forge was set up <b>to</b> <b>hammer</b> the iron into fittings. The timber for her hull and cabins was cut {{in the mountains and}} hauled or floated to the construction site, where it was sawn into planks and other components for the vessel. It cost the company as much to build Shoshone as it took to build three boats elsewhere. Although she was a large boat and expensive, Shoshone drew less than two feet of water and had no difficulty navigating the river to Old's Ferry, Idaho.|$|E

40|$|Gothic {{themes and}} {{settings}} permeated British sf and horror {{in the later}} twentieth century. The vivid horror films made by Hammer Productions drew influence from gothic novels of {{the eighteenth and nineteenth}} centuries and in turn influenced numerous gothic serials in the sf series Doctor Who. While Doctor Who’s own creative personnel noted their debt <b>to</b> <b>Hammer’s</b> distillation of the gothic, this article interprets one major point of departure between them, in terms of how they treat the sacramental efficacy of Christianity within gothic settings. It suggests that Doctor Who’s gothic stories disparage rituals and holy items in contrast <b>to</b> <b>Hammer’s</b> serious treatment of faith. The gothic in Doctor Who reflects the strain of sacramental scepticism in earlier gothic texts that Hammer films do not. ...|$|R
