5|$|After gaining {{tropical}} characteristics <b>throughout</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day on November3, {{the storm}} was designated Tropical Depression Eleven.

5|$|Hurricane Gilma {{originated}} from a tropical wave that moved {{off the coast}} of Africa and traversed the Atlantic Ocean during the second week of July 1994. The wave was of little note until it crossed Central America and entered the Northeastern Pacific hurricane basin on July15–16. Convection began to increase; however, the system remained disorganized. Tracking westward, gradual development took place, leading to the Dvorak classification being initiated on July20. Several hours later, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) designated the system as Tropical Depression Seven-E. A strong ridge situated north of the depression steered the system steadily westward. This movement would remain the same <b>throughout</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> storm's existence. The depression was initially hard to locate due to its large size.|$|E
