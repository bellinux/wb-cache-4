Low doses of the T 3 metabolite, triiodothyracetic acid (TRIAC), induced ectopic expression of UCP 1 in rat abdominal WAT (Medina-Gomez et al. 2008). Consistently, chronic administration of GC- 1, a thyroid hormone receptor β-specific agonist, to obese mice markedly increased browning of subcutaneous WAT with a significant increase in core body temperature and whole body energy expenditure (Lin et al. 2015). Similar safety concerns for the use of β 3 -AR agonists have been raised for THs in terms of heart risks, hyperthermia, and weight loss (Moolman 2002; Mullur et al. 2014). THs have also been linked to an increased risk of fractures in postmenopausal women with lower serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels (Bauer et al. 2001), which directly affects bone turnover (Murphy and Williams 2004). This further emphasizes the need for browning agents to be carefully designed and controlled in order to ensure its safe metabolic benefits.|$|E
40|$|One of the {{obstacles}} for cancer immunotherapy is the ineffi-ciency of CD 8 þ T-cell recruitment to tumors. STAT 3 {{has been shown to}} suppress CD 8 þ T-cell antitumor functions in various cancermodels, in part by restricting accumulationofCD 8 þT cells. However, the underlying molecular mechanism by which STAT 3 in CD 8 <b>þ</b> <b>T</b> cells inhibits their accumulation in tumors remains to be defined. Here, we show that STAT 3 signaling in CD 8 <b>þ</b> <b>T</b> cells inhibits chemokine CXCL 10 production by tumor-associated myeloid cells by reducing IFNg expression by T cells. We further demonstrate that ablating STAT 3 in T cells allows expression of CXCR 3, the receptor of CXCL 10, on CD 8 <b>þ</b> <b>T</b> cells, resulting in efficient accumulation of CD 8 <b>þ</b> <b>T</b> cells at tumor sites. Blocking IFNg or CXCR 3 impairs the accumulation of STAT 3 -deficient CD 8 <b>þ</b> <b>T</b> cells in tumor and their antitumor effects.

40|$|An {{impaired}} antitumor immunity {{is found}} in patients with cancer and represents a major obstacle in the successful development of different forms of immunotherapy. Signaling through Notch receptors regulates the differentiation and function of many cell types, including immune cells. However, the effect of Notch in CD 8 þ T-cell responses in tumors remains unclear. Thus, we aimed to determine the role of Notch signaling in CD 8 <b>þ</b> <b>T</b> cells in the induction of tumor-induced suppression. Our results using conditional knockout mice show that Notch- 1 and Notch- 2 were critical for the proliferation and IFNg production of activated CD 8 <b>þ</b> <b>T</b> cells and were significantly decreased in tumor-infiltrating T cells. Conditional transgenic expression of Notch- 1 intracellular domain (N 1 IC) in antigen-specific CD 8 <b>þ</b> <b>T</b> cells did not affect activation or proliferation of CD 8 <b>þ</b> <b>T</b> cells, but induced a central memory phenotype and increased cytotoxicity effects and granzyme B levels. Consequently, a higher antitumor response and resistance to tumor-induced tolerancewere found after adoptive transfer of N 1 IC-transgenic CD 8 <b>þ</b> <b>T</b> cells into tumor-bearing mice. Additional results showed that myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) blocked the expression of Notch- 1 and Notch- 2 in T cells through nitric oxide–dependent mechanisms. Interestingly, N 1 IC overexpression rendered CD 8 <b>þ</b> <b>T</b> cells resistant to the tolerogenic effect induced byMDSC in vivo. Together, the results suggest the key role of Notch in the suppression of CD 8 þT-cell responses in tumors and the therapeutic potential of N 1 IC in antigen-specific CD 8 <b>þ</b> <b>T</b> cells to reverse T-cell suppression and increase the efficacy of T cell–based immunotherapies in cancer.

Objectives: To investigate the immune activation status and T regulatory (Treg) cell levels in SPC. Study design: A cross-sectional study was carried out on 28 children 8 years old and older who were vertically infected with HIV. The children were stratified into 3 groups according to their clinical outcome: SPC (anti-retroviral-therapy-naı̈ve; 8 years-old; CD 4 20 %; viral load < 25, 000 copies), IF/VF (anti-retroviral-therapy but with no therapeutic response), and IS/VS (anti-retroviral therapy with good therapeutic response).

Results: A higher percentage of activated CD 8 <b>þ</b> <b>T</b> cells were found in all HIV infected children, regardless of the evolution of disease. The activation of CD 8 <b>þ</b> <b>T</b> cells was not associated with either viral load or the percentage of CD 4 <b>þ</b> <b>T</b> cells.

40|$|SummaryMost {{studies in}} {{evolution}} are centered on how homologous genes, structures, and/or processes appeared and diverged. Although historical homology is well {{defined as a}} concept, in practice its establishment can be problematic, especially for some morphological traits or developmental processes. Metamorphosis in chordates is such an enigmatic character. Defined as a spectacular postembryonic larva-to-adult transition, it shows a wide morphological diversity between the different chordate lineages, suggesting {{that it might have}} appeared several times independently. In vertebrates, metamorphosis is triggered by binding of the thyroid hormones (<b>THs)</b> <b>T</b> 4 and T 3 to thyroid-hormone receptors (TRs). Here we show that a TH derivative, triiodothyroacetic acid (TRIAC), induces metamorphosis in the cephalochordate amphioxus. The amphioxus TR (amphiTR) mediates spontaneous and TRIAC-induced metamorphosis because it strongly binds to TRIAC, and a specific TR antagonist, NH 3, inhibits both spontaneous and TRIAC-induced metamorphosis. Moreover, as in amphibians, amphiTR expression levels increase around metamorphosis and are enhanced by THs. Therefore, TH-regulated metamorphosis, mediated by TR, is an ancestral feature of all chordates. This conservation of a regulatory network supports the homology of metamorphosis in the chordate lineage...|$|E

40|$|Ligand gated ionotropic receptors are {{responsible}} for the fast neurotransmission in the brain and are the target of widely used drugs, such as anxiolytics, anticonvulsant and antidepressant, and of endogenously produced substances, e. g. hormones. In this review, the fast regulatory effects of thyroid hormones (<b>THs,</b> <b>T</b> 3 and T 4) on ligand gated ion channels will be analyzed and discussed. More precisely, the focus will be on receptors that mediate the majority of inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmission in the brain, respectively γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate ionotropic receptors. Brain is an important target of THs, as proved by profound alterations in its functionality related to hormonal imbalance. Indeed, dysthyroidism is often associated with several neuropsychiatric disorders that derive also from a dysfunction of GABAergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission. The molecular mechanisms responsible for these changes are not completely clarified yet. THs, through the binding of nuclear receptors, can modulate the expression of proteins directly or indirectly involved in neurotransmission; in addition, their non genomic fast modulation of ionotropic receptors mediating excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission could also play an important role. THs modulate recombinant and native receptors activated by exogenous GABA or glutamate as well synaptic and extrasynaptic excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission. These non genomic effects do not depend on protein phosphorylation or on the membrane integrin receptor αvβ 3 activation. Keeping in mind that a local regulation of THs levels can occur in different brain regions the fast modulation of THs of synaptic activity could provide a rapid and efficacious control of the function of several brain circuitries...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was testing on the example of a model region a method of {{estimation}} of the production potential of forest ecosystems and the consequences of anthropogenic changes there. The object of study is a typical Carpathian lower mountain forest in the basin of the river Lyuchka, an area of 14, 806 ha. It has long undergone considerable agricultural transformations. Studies were based on cartographic modeling of modern anthropogenically transformed biogeocenotic cover using large scale satellite images. The main types of biogeocenotical cover were defined according to the altitudinal zonation of vegetation of the parts of the mountain terrain and the prevailing types of soil and hydrological conditions. For analytical procedures a database of materials describing the biometric features of the forests was created. It is possible to perform calculations of average and potential biometrical parameters of stands growing in different climatic, soil and hydrological conditions. The structure and the biological diversity of different vegetation types was determined by construction of mapping models of spatial structures of the basic types of biogeocenotic cover. The biological productivity of the main types of forest ecosystems was determined on base of the volume of timber stands. The mass of dry wood was determined taking into account its size and standard density of wood of different tree species. Calculation of the total volume of forest biomass was performed using the conversion factors of weight relative to the trunk timber volume. The mass of carbon deposited accounted for 50 % of the total biomass. The average annual growth of biomass and carbon deposited was determined by dividing the volume of the stands by their average age. Calculation of phytocenosis consumed as a result of photosynthesis reaction of CO 2, H 2 O and light energy was performed taking into account corresponding material and energy ratios. In general, in the course of one year the biogeocenotic cover of the model lowland area could deposit as a result of photosynthesis for the restoration of potential vegetation cover 43. 3 ths. tons of carbon, while consuming 159 <b>ths.</b> <b>t</b> of CO 2 and 65. 2  ths. t of H 2 O and 1, 724 ∙ 103 GJ of light energy, which is equivalent to 479 GW ∙ hour.

DM was induced in adult female SD rats by injection of nicotinamide (N; 200 mg/kg) followed by streptozotocin (STZ; 65 mg/kg). One month after STZ/N, rats were randomized to the following groups (N= 10 /group) : STZ/N or STZ/N + 0. 03 μg/ml T 3; Age-matched vehicle treated rats served as non-diabetic controls (C). After 2 months T 3 treatment (3 months post DM induction), LV function was assessed by echocardiography and LV pressure measurements. Despite normal serum thyroid hormone (TH) levels, STZ/N treatment resulted in reductions in myocardial tissue content of <b>THs</b> (<b>T</b> 3 & T 4 : 39 % & 17 % reduction vs. C, respectively). Tissue hypothyroidism in the DM hearts was associated with increased D 3 deiodinase (which converts THs to inactive metabolites) and TH transporter expression, re-expression of the fetal gene phenotype, reduced arteriolar resistance vessel density, and diminished cardiac function. Low-dose T 3 replacement largely restored cardiac tissue TH levels (T 3 & T 4 : 43 % & 10 % increase vs. STZ/N, respectively), improved cardiac function, reversed fetal gene expression, and preserved the arteriolar resistance vessel network without causing overt symptoms of hyperthyroidism.

Methods Placenta samples collected from 95 women who delivered term (> 37  weeks) infants in Durham, NC, USA (enrolled 2010 – 2011) were analyzed for polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), 2, 4, 6 -tribromophenol (2, 4, 6 -TBP), <b>THs</b> (<b>T</b> 4, T 3 and rT 3), and DIO 3 and TH SULT activities. Results PBDEs and 2, 4, 6 -TBP were detected in all placenta samples. PBDEs were higher in placental tissues from male infants compared to female infants, with 2, 4, 6 -TBP and BDE- 209 levels approximately twice as high. Among male infants, placental BDE- 99 and BDE- 209 were negatively associated with rT 3 placental levels. For female infants, placental BDE- 99 and 2, 4, 6 -TBP were positively associated with T 3 concentrations. DIO 3 activity was also significantly higher in placental tissues from male infants compared to females, while 3, 3 ’-T 2 SULT activity was significantly higher in placental tissues from females compared to males. Among males, several PBDE congeners were positively correlated with T 3 SULT, while BDE- 99 was negatively associated with T 3 SULT among females. Associations generally remained after adjustment for potential confounding by maternal age and gestational age at delivery. Conclusions These results suggest BFRs accumulate in the placenta and potentially alter TH function in a sex-specific manner, a possible mechanism to explain the sex-dependent impacts of environmental exposure on children’s growth and development. More {{research is needed to}} elucidate the effects of BFRs on placenta function during pregnancy, as well as the biological consequences of exposure and thyroid disruption...|$|E
40|$|Monocarboxylate {{transporter}} 8 (MCT 8) facilitates cellular influx and efflux of {{the thyroid}} hormones (<b>THs)</b> <b>T</b> 4 and T 3. Mutations in MCT 8 lead to severe psychomotor retardation. Here, we studied {{the importance of}} 2 highly conserved residues (Arg 445 in transmembrane domain 8 and Asp 498 in transmembrane domain 10) for substrate recognition and helix interactions. We introduced single and double mutations (R 445 A, R 445 C, R 445 D, R 445 K, D 498 A, D 498 E, D 498 N, D 498 R, R 445 A+D 498 A, R 445 D+D 498 R, and R 445 K+D 498 E) in human MCT 8 cDNA and studied the effects on MCT 8 -mediated TH uptake and metabolism in transfected cells. The impact of these mutations on MCT 8 protein expression, dimerization capacity, and subcellular localization was studied by Western blottingandconfocal microscopy. Wefound that mutations in Arg 445 or Asp 498 that alter the local charge resulted in a near-complete loss of TH uptake capacity, whereas the expression, stability, and subcellular localization of these mutant proteins was similar to those for wild-type MCT 8. Given the impaired TH uptake, TH efflux could not be adequately studied. The importance of opposite charges at Arg 445 and Asp 498 was studied by exchanging these residues (R 445 D+D 498 R). In particular, T 4 uptake was less severely reduced by the exchange mutation than by the single mutations. Mutations of Arg 445 and Asp 498 to equally charged residues (R 445 K and/or D 498 E) resulted in TH uptake levels similar to wild-type MCT 8. The presence of 2 oppositely charged residues at positions Arg 445 and Asp 498 that are predicted in close structural proximity is crucial for efficient TH uptake, which may indicate the presence of an, at least transient, charge pair between these residues.

40|$|Neurosteroids (NSs) and Thyroid hormones (<b>THs,</b> <b>T</b> 3, {{triiodothyronine}} and T 4, thyroxine) {{are important}} endogenous modulators of GABAA receptor (GABAAR) function (Puia and Losi, 2011). The involvement of NSs in several physiological and pathological processes {{has been largely}} acknowledged, among them pain transmission. Several studies revealed the antinociceptive properties of some NSs and demonstrated that they can induce a potent peripheral analgesia via a direct GABAAR allosteric modulation (Poisbeau et al., 2014). Very little is known instead of how THs affect synaptic transmission in structures devoted to pain transmission. Pain sensitivity {{is related to the}} thyroid status, indeed hyperthyroidism confers greater sensitivity to thermal noxious stimuli (Edmondson et al., 1990) and alters the nociceptive responses in rats (Bruno et al., 2005). Dorsal root ganglion (DRG) cells are primary sensory neurons playing important roles in pain transmission between periphery and CNS. By using the patch clamp technique in the whole cell configuration we analyzed the effect of THs and of some NSs (Pregnenolone Sulfate, PS, and Allopregnenolone, ALLO) on GABA-evoked currents in rat DRG cells grown in primary cultures T 3, T 4 and PS (from 500 nM to 50 µM) reduce GABA-evoked currents with an IC 50 of 0. 8 ± 0. 3 μM for T 3 (eff max =- 42 ± 9 %), of 1. 4 ± 0. 7 μM for T 4 (eff max =- 41 ± 6 %) and of 4. 3 ± 1. 2 μM (eff max =- 60 ± 8 %) for PS. ALLO potentiates GABA-evoked current in DRG neurons with an IC 50 of 1. 3 ± 0. 8 μM and a maximal effect of 110 ± 20 %. To investigate the mechanism of action of THs and PS we applied increasing concentrations of GABA (5, 10 and 50 µM) to the same concentration of modulator (10 µM). The effect of T 3, T 4 and PS was not dependent on the GABA concentration used suggesting that they act in a non-competitive way. The modulatory activity of THs and PS on sIPSCs amplitude and frequency measured in lamina II neurons of acutely dissociated spinal cord slices was also investigated. In conclusion, since DRG neurosteroidogenesis is a physiologically relevant process (Schaeffer et al., 2010), our findings suggest that NSs modulation of GABAAR in this cells could {{play an important role in}} pain transmission from periphery to spinal cord. Furthermore the decreased GABAAR activity induced by T 3 and T 4 result in a reduced inhibitory neurotransmission that could contribute to the increased pain sensitivity detected in hyperthyroid animals...|$|E
40|$|Summary: The strict {{limit in}} proliferative {{potential}} of normal {{human somatic cells}} – {{a process known as}} replicative senescence – is highly relevant to the immune system, because clonal expansion is fundamental to adaptive immunity. CD 8 <b>þ</b> <b>T</b> cells that undergo extensive rounds of antigen-driven proliferation in cell culture invariably reach the end stage of replicative senescence, characterized by irreversible cell-cycle arrest and a critically short telomere length. Cultures of senescent CD 8 <b>þ</b> <b>T</b> cells also show resistance to apoptosis, permanent loss of CD 28 expres-sion, altered cytokine profiles, reduced ability to respond to stress, and various functional changes. Cells with similar characteristics accumulate during normal aging as well as in younger persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus, suggesting that the process of replicative senes-cence is not an artifact of cell culture but is also occurring in vivo. Interestingly, in elderly persons, the presence of high proportions of CD 8 <b>þ</b> <b>T</b> cells with characteristics of replicative senescence is correlated with reduced antibody responses to vaccines as well as with osteoporotic fractures. CD 8 þCD 28 – T cells also accumulate in patients with certain types of cancer. The emerging picture is that senescent CD 8 <b>þ</b> <b>T</b> cells may modulate both immune and non-immune functions, contributing not only to reduced anti-viral immunity but also to diverse age-related pathologies...|$|R
40|$|Head {{and neck}} cancers {{positive}} for human papillomavirus (HPV) {{have a more}} favorable clinical outcome than HPV-negative cancers, but it is unknown why this is the case. We hypothesized that prognosis was affected by intrinsic features ofHPV-infected tumor cells or differences in host immune response. In this study, we focused on a comparison of regulatory Foxp 3 <b>þ</b> <b>T</b> cells and programmed death- 1 (PD- 1) <b>þ</b> <b>T</b> cells in the microenvironment of tumors thatwere positive or negative forHPV, in two groups thatwerematched for various clinical and biologic parameters. HPV-positive head and neck cancers were more heavily infiltrated by regulatory T cells and PD- 1 <b>þ</b> <b>T</b> cells and the levels of PD- 1 þ cells were positively correlated with a favorable clinical outcome. In explaining this paradoxical result, we showed that these PD- 1 <b>þ</b> <b>T</b> cells expressed activation markers and were functional after blockade of the PD- 1 –PD-L 1 axis in vitro. Approximately 50 % of PD- 1 <b>þ</b> tumor-infiltrating <b>T</b> cells lacked Tim- 3 expression andmay indeed represent activated T cells. Inmice, administration of a cancer vaccine increased PD- 1 on T cells with concomitant tumor regression. In this setting, PD- 1 blockade synergized with vaccine in eliciting antitumor efficacy. Our findings prompt a need to revisit the significance of PD- 1 –infiltrating T cells in cancer, where we suggest that PD- 1 detection may reflect a previous immune response against tumors that might be reactivated by PD- 1 /PD-L 1 blockade.

Tuberculosis (TB), the disease caused by Mtb infection, {{remains one of the}} leading causes of infectious morbidity and mortality worldwide and is the most frequent opportunistic infection in individuals with HIV/AIDS. Therefore, we undertook this study to define immunodominant CD 8 Mtb antigens. First, using IFN-c ELISPOT and synthetic peptide arrays as a source of antigen, we measured ex vivo frequencies of CD 8 <b>þ</b> <b>T</b> cells recognizing known immunodominant CD 4 <b>þ</b> <b>T</b> cell antigens in persons with latent tuberculosis infection. In addition, limiting dilution was used to generate panels of Mtb-specific T cell clones.

We assessed whether a T 1 D genetic risk score (T 1 D-GRS) generated from T 1 D-associated common genetic variants provides a novel way to discriminate monogenic diabetes from T 1 D. The T 1 D-GRS was highly discriminative of proven MODY (n= 805) and T 1 D (n= 1963) (ROC-AUC= 0. 87). A T 1 D-GRS of > 0. 280 (> 50 (<b>th)</b> <b>T</b> 1 D centile) was indicative of T 1 D (94 % specificity, 50 % sensitivity). We then analyzed the T 1 D-GRS in 242 White-European {{patients with}} neonatal diabetes (NDM) who had been tested for all known neonatal diabetes genes. Monogenic NDM was confirmed in 90 %, 59 % and 8 % in patients with GRS 75 (<b>th)</b> <b>T</b> 1 D centile, respectively.

40|$|Background: Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) chronically colonizes gastric/duodenal mucosa and induces {{gastroduodenal}} disease such as gastritis and {{peptic ulcer}} and induces vigorous innate and specific immune responses; however, the infection is not removed, {{a state of}} chronic active gastritis persists for life if untreated. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the number of regulatory T cells (Tregs) in gastric mucosa of patients with gastritis and peptic ulcer and determined the relationship between main virulence factor of H. pylori and Tregs. Methods and materials: A total of 89 patients with gastritis, 63 patients with peptic ulcer and 40 healthy, H. pylori-negative subjects were enrolled in this study. Expression of CD 4 and Foxp 3 was determined by immunohistochemistry. Antrum biopsy was obtained for detection of H. pylori, bacterial virulence factors and histopathological assessments. TGF-b 1, IL- 10 and FOXP 3 expressions were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Results: The numbers of CD 4 þ and Foxp 3 <b>þ</b> <b>T</b> cells as well as the expression of IL- 10, TGF-b 1, FOXP 3, INF-g and IL- 17 A in infected patients were significantly higher than the ones in uninfected patients. Also, the number of CD 4 <b>þ</b> <b>T</b> cells was independent on the vacuolating cytotoxin A (vacA) and outer inflammatory protein A (oipA), but it was positively correlated with cytotoxin-associated gene A (cagA). Instead, the number of Foxp 3 <b>þ</b> <b>T</b> cells was dependent on the vacA and oipA, but it was independent on cagA. The number of Foxp 3 <b>þ</b> <b>T</b> cells and the expression of IL- 10, TGF-b 1 and FOXP 3 in infected patients with gastritis were significantly higher than the ones in infected patients with peptic ulcer. Moreover, the number of CD 4 <b>þ</b> <b>T</b> cells and the expression of IL- 17 A and INF-g was the lowest in the gastritis patients, however, increased progressively in the peptic ulcer patients. Additionally, the numbers of CD 4 þ and Foxp 3 <b>þ</b> <b>T</b> cells as well as the expression of IL- 10, TGF-b 1, FOXP 3 and INF-g were positively correlated with the degree of H. pylori density and chronic inflammation.
