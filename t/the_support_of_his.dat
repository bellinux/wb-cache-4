5|$|A strong {{influence}} on Champagne wine production was the centuries-old rivalry between {{the region and}} Burgundy. From the key market of Paris to the palace of Louis XIV of France at Versailles, proponents of Champagne and Burgundy would compete for dominance. For most of his life, Louis XIV would drink only Champagne wine with <b>the</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> doctor Antoine d'Aquin who advocated the King drink Champagne with every meal {{for the benefit of}} his health. As the King aged and his ailments increased, competing doctors would propose alternative treatments with alternative wines, to soothe the King's ills. One of these doctors, Guy-Crescent Fagon conspired with the King's mistress to oust d'Aquin and have himself appointed as Royal Doctor. Fagon quickly attributed the King's continuing ailments to Champagne and ordered that only Burgundy wine must be served at the royal table.|$|E
5|$|As Mary was {{an infant}} when she {{inherited}} the throne, Scotland was ruled by regents until she became an adult. From the outset, there were two claims to the Regency: one from Catholic Cardinal Beaton, and the other from the Protestant Earl of Arran, who was next in line to the throne. Beaton's claim {{was based on a}} version of the late king's will that his opponents dismissed as a forgery. Arran, with <b>the</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> friends and relations, became the regent until 1554 when Mary's mother managed to remove and succeed him.|$|E
5|$|Australia's {{leadership}} changed {{again during}} the Borneo Campaign. Prime Minister Curtin {{suffered a heart attack}} in November 1944 and Deputy Prime Minister Frank Forde acted in his place until 22 January 1945. Curtin was hospitalised with another bout of illness in April 1945 and Treasurer Ben Chifley became acting Prime Minister as Forde was attending the San Francisco Conference. Curtin died on 5 July 1945 and Forde was sworn in as Prime Minister. Forde did not have <b>the</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> party, however, and was replaced by Chifley after a leadership ballot was held on 13 July.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the return}} of Shackleton's body to South Georgia, there was a {{memorial}} service held for him with full military honours at Holy Trinity Church, Montevideo, and on 2 March a service was held at St Paul's Cathedral, London, at which the King {{and other members of}} the royal family were represented. Within a year the first biography, The Life of Sir Ernest Shackleton, by Hugh Robert Mill, was published. This book, as well as being a tribute to the explorer, was a practical effort to assist his family; Shackleton died some £40,000 in debt (2011: £1.6 million). A further initiative was the establishment of a Shackleton Memorial Fund, which was used to assist the education of his children and <b>the</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> mother.|$|E
5|$|By the 15th century English chivalric {{ideas of}} selfless {{service to the}} king had been corrupted. Armed forces were mostly raised through musters in {{individual}} estates; every able-bodied man had to respond to his lord's call to arms, and each noble had exclusive authority over his militia. Although a king could raise personal militia from his lands, he could only muster a significantly large army through <b>the</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> nobles. Richard, like his predecessors, had to win over these men by granting gifts and maintaining cordial relationships. Powerful nobles could demand greater incentives {{to remain on the}} liege's side or else they might turn against him. Three groups, each with its own agenda, stood on Bosworth Field: Richard III and his Yorkist army; his challenger, Henry Tudor, who championed the Lancastrian cause; and the fence-sitting Stanleys.|$|E
5|$|Due to the lord's {{presence}} in a castle, it was a centre of administration from where he controlled his lands. He relied on the support of those below him, as without <b>the</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> more powerful tenants a lord could expect his power to be undermined. Successful lords regularly held court with those immediately below them on the social scale, but absentees could expect to find their influence weakened. Larger lordships could be vast, {{and it would be}} impractical for a lord to visit all his properties regularly so deputies were appointed. This especially applied to royalty, who sometimes owned land in different countries.|$|E

5|$|Henry's {{ability to}} govern was intimately {{bound up with}} the Church, which formed the key to the {{administration}} of both England and Normandy, and this relationship changed considerably {{over the course of his}} reign. William the Conqueror had reformed the English Church with <b>the</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> Archbishop of Canterbury, Lanfranc, who became a close colleague and advisor to the King. Under William Rufus this arrangement had collapsed, the King and Archbishop Anselm had become estranged and Anselm had gone into exile. Henry also believed in Church reform, but on taking power in England he became embroiled in the investiture controversy.|$|E
5|$|In 371, the Emperor Valens split Cappadocia {{into two}} new provinces, Cappadocia Prima and Cappadocia Secunda. This {{resulted}} in complex changes in ecclesiastical boundaries, during which several new bishoprics were created. Gregory was elected {{bishop of the}} new see of Nyssa in 372, presumably with <b>the</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> brother Basil, who was metropolitan of Caesarea. Gregory's early policies as bishop often went against those of Basil : for instance, while his brother condemned the Sabellianist followers of Marcellus of Ancyra as heretics, Gregory may have tried to reconcile them with the church.|$|E
5|$|In the primary, Rhea {{achieved}} {{a plurality of}} the votes, but not a majority. Chandler had the next highest vote total, and the two faced {{each other in a}} run-off on September 7, 1935. In the run-off, Chandler defeated Rhea, securing the nomination for governor. President Roosevelt, not wanting Democratic factionalism to cost him votes in the 1936 presidential election, attempted to bring together the Laffoon and Chandler factions, but to little avail. Laffoon and Rhea, along with most of Laffoon's administration, bolted the party and supported Republican nominee King Swope. Despite losing <b>the</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> predecessor, Chandler {{went on to win the}} general election. In his last days in office, Laffoon issued pardons for Denhardt and others charged in connection with the National Guard's interference with the primary in Harlan County. These were among a record 560 pardons issued by Laffoon, most of which were to relieve prison crowding.|$|E

2500|$|Many castles were feudal estates {{that were}} {{owned by a}} {{powerful}} feudal lord or prince-bishopric. Princely territories at that time were protected by a dense network of small and medium-sized fortifications, which was supplemented by the fortified estates of sub-vassals. From this perspective, {{in the event of}} attack the defenders could rely entirely on <b>the</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> their lords <b>his</b> subordinated or allied knighthood. Conversely the ruler would of course rely on <b>the</b> <b>support</b> [...] <b>of</b> <b>his</b> vassals in time of conflict.|$|R
5|$|Precisely because Prince Yelü Bei {{exemplified}} both Chinese and Khitan values, Empress Shulü Ping {{objected to}} Bei assuming {{the role of}} Emperor. The Empress believed that Bei's openness to Chinese culture detracted from his leadership ability as a Khitan, and she instead favored Emperor Taizu's more traditionalist second son, Yelü Deguang. Deguang enjoyed not only <b>the</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> mother, {{but also of the}} Khitan nobility. Realizing that he could not assume the throne, {{and that it would be}} dangerous to try, Bei campaigned in favor of allowing his younger brother to assume the throne, and by the end of 927, formally stated to his mother that Deguang's qualifications were superior to his own, functionally ending his ability to challenge Deguang's ascension to the throne.|$|E
5|$|The IPC Alpine Skiing World Cup in Thredbo, New South Wales in September 2013 was {{intended}} to be his last competition due to the desire {{to spend more time with}} his family.

His return to competitive skiing with <b>the</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> wife Emily was subject to his training program allowing for more family time.|$|E
5|$|While it was {{possibly}} an overstatement {{to describe the}} 1975 position as a choice between evils, neither {{of the two major}} political groupings reached the 15 October 1975 crunch position with completely clean hands. Fraser and the Liberal-CP senators... lacked the numbers to defer the Budget until the arrival in the Senate of Albert Patrick Field, whose arrival was not due to any decision by the Australian voters but to a decision by one of the rulers, the Whitlam-hating Bjelke-Petersen... Whitlam for his part had decided even before the Budget was deferred to embark upon the bold, Cromwellian project of changing the Australian Constitution, not through the vote of the mass electorate... but through prodigious personal exertions backed by <b>the</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> parliamentary followers.|$|E

5|$|William faced several {{challenges}} on becoming duke, including his illegitimate birth and his youth: the {{evidence indicates that}} he was either {{seven or eight years}} old at the time. He enjoyed <b>the</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> great-uncle, Archbishop Robert, as well as the king of France, Henry I, enabling him to succeed to his father's duchy. The support given to the exiled English princes in their attempt to return to England in 1036 shows that the new duke's guardians were attempting to continue his father's policies, but Archbishop Robert's death in March 1037 removed one of William's main supporters, and conditions in Normandy quickly descended into chaos.|$|E
5|$|At this point, {{international}} affairs intervened. Louis XI {{declared war on}} Burgundy, and Duke Charles responded by granting an expeditionary force to Edward IV, in order to reclaim his throne. On 14March Edward landed at Ravenspurn in Yorkshire, with the acquiescence of the Earl of Northumberland. Warwick was still waiting for Queen Margaret and her son Edward, {{who were supposed to}} bring reinforcements from France, but were kept on the continent by bad weather. At this point Edward received <b>the</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> brother Clarence, who realised that he had been disadvantaged by the new agreement with the Lancastrians. Clarence's defection weakened Warwick, who nevertheless went in pursuit of Edward. On 14April 1471 the two armies met at Barnet. Fog and poor visibility on the field led to confusion, and the Lancastrian army ended up attacking its own men. In the face of defeat Warwick attempted to escape the field, but was struck off his horse and killed.|$|E
5|$|Gillard {{was first}} elected to the House of Representatives at the 1998 federal {{election}} for the seat of Lalor. Following the 2001 election, she was elected to Shadow Cabinet. When Kevin Rudd was elected as party leader and Leader of the Opposition in December 2006, Gillard was elected unopposed as his deputy. Upon Labor's victory at the 2007 election, {{she became the first}} female Deputy Prime Minister of Australia, and was made Minister for Education, Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister for Social Inclusion. On , after Rudd lost <b>the</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> party and resigned, Gillard was elected unopposed as his replacement, thus becoming prime minister. The subsequent 2010 federal election saw the first hung parliament since 1940. Gillard was able to form a minority government with the support of a Green MP and three independents. On 26 June 2013, after a leadership spill, Gillard lost the leadership of the Labor Party back to Rudd. Her resignation as prime minister took effect the following day. Gillard retired from politics on 5 August 2013, before the impending federal election.|$|E

5|$|In 595, Gregory chose Augustine, who was {{the prior}} of the Abbey of St Andrew's in Rome, to head the mission to Kent. The pope {{selected}} monks to accompany Augustine and sought support from the Frankish royalty and clergy {{in a series of}} letters, of which some copies survive in Rome. He wrote to King Theuderic II of Burgundy and to King Theudebert II of Austrasia, as well as their grandmother Brunhild, seeking aid for the mission. Gregory thanked King Chlothar II of Neustria for aiding Augustine. Besides hospitality, the Frankish bishops and kings provided interpreters and Frankish priests to accompany the mission. By soliciting help from the Frankish kings and bishops, Gregory helped to assure a friendly reception for Augustine in Kent, as Æthelbert was unlikely to mistreat a mission which visibly had <b>the</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> wife's relatives and people. Moreover, the Franks appreciated the chance to participate in mission that would extend their influence in Kent. Chlothar, in particular, needed a friendly realm across the Channel to help guard his kingdom's flanks against his fellow Frankish kings.|$|E
5|$|Marthandan {{is chosen}} by a {{majority}} of the imperial council of the kingdom of Ratnapuri to be its new ruler after the previous king died without naming a successor. However, the kingdom's Rajaguru (high priest) Vijayavarman, plans to kill Marthandan and make Pingalan, Marthandan's cousin, king. Meanwhile, Veerabahu, a loyal bodyguard of the late king, and his men, including his son Bhupathi and daughter Madhana, are not pleased to see Marthandan as king and are equally saddened by the situation of Ratnapuri's people. Food shortages and high unemployment have besieged Ratnapuri in addition to the taxes imposed by Vijayavarman without Marthandan's knowledge. This results in violent protests by the people led by Veerangan, Marthandan's look-alike, with <b>the</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> friend Sagayam. They march to the palace condemning the monarchy and demanding democracy. Veerangan is imprisoned for his actions in Naganathapuram, a nearby town. Madhana is also incarcerated in the same prison on a similar charge. They are pardoned and released on the occasion of Marthandan's coronation. They travel together to Ratnapuri. Sharing the same ideals and revolutionary thoughts, they fall in love.|$|E
5|$|Roberts {{found it}} {{difficult}} to both study and play hockey, but praised <b>the</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> classmates and the faculty in helping him earn his degree. He had to complete an extra year of schooling after failing his second year, but graduated from McGill in 1916. Following an 18-goal season in 1915–16, he left Montreal to take up practice in British Columbia. Roberts continued his hockey career and joined the Vancouver Millionaires of the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA). He led the PCHA in scoring with 43 goals – in 23 games – and was named a league all-star on left wing. His medical career took him to Seattle and as a result, he joined the Seattle Metropolitans for the 1917–18 PCHA season. He retired in 1918 to focus on his medical career in the Howe Sound region of British Columbia, but was lured back to the PCHA by the Millionaires for the 1919–20 season. He scored 16 goals in 22 games for Vancouver before permanently retiring from hockey.|$|E
