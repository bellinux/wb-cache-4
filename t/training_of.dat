5|$|Because the {{existing}} airstrip at Turatam near the cosmodrome was small, {{the dogs and}} crew had to be first flown aboard a Tu-104 plane to Tashkent.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether <b>trains</b> <b>of</b> subthreshold high frequency conditioning stimuli (333 Hz, 1 ms duration, 2 ms interval) delivered to the canine ventricle inhibited the response to a premature stimulus (S 2) more effectively than did a single subthreshold conditioning stimulus. It was found that <b>trains</b> <b>of</b> conditioning stimuli (mean 1. 21 mA) inhibited the response to S 2152 ms beyond expiration of the ventricular effective refractory period, whereas a single conditioning stimulus inhibited S 2 only 20 ms or less beyond the ventricular effective refractory period. In late diastole, <b>trains</b> <b>of</b> conditioning stimuli failed to inhibit S 2 when the <b>train</b> <b>of</b> stimuli caused ventricular depolarization or the latter occurred in response to the next sinus impulse. <b>Trains</b> <b>of</b> conditioning stimuli did not induce ventricular arrhythmias. Lidocaine or autonomic blockade did not alter the response to <b>trains</b> <b>of</b> conditioning stimuli. <b>Trains</b> <b>of</b> conditioning stimuli or a single conditioning stimulus inhibited the response to S 2 only when they were delivered at the same electrode site. By lengthening the ventricular effective refractory period, <b>trains</b> <b>of</b> conditioning stimuli could prevent or terminate tachycardias, but this possibility is constrained, at present, by the spatial limitations of the technique...|$|R
5|$|But {{daunting}} {{technical problems}} remained. Raeder wanted newer planes, {{specifically designed for}} carrier use. Reichsmarshall Hermann Göring, head of the Luftwaffe, replied that the already overburdened German aircraft industry could not possibly complete the design, testing and mass production of such aircraft before 1946. Instead, he proposed converting existing aircraft (again the Junkers Ju 87 and Messerschmitt Bf 109) as a temporary solution until newer types could be developed. <b>Training</b> <b>of</b> carrier pilots at Travemünde would also resume.|$|E
5|$|Compared {{to former}} Russian armies, Shein's army was {{significantly}} modernised. Dissatisfied with their traditional formations of musket-equipped infantry (the streltsy), the Russians looked to foreign officers {{to update the}} equipment and <b>training</b> <b>of</b> their troops based on the Western European model of regulars, dragoons, and reiters. Eight such regiments, totaling 14,000 to 17,000 men, comprised a part of Shein's army.|$|E
5|$|During a {{press conference}} on 26 February 2015, Chovanec {{introduced}} five areas that were to be scrutinized {{in connection with the}} Uherský Brod attack: the communication of national police with municipal authorities, possible changes in crisis plans, operational range of tactical teams, and enhanced <b>training</b> <b>of</b> policemen. Chovanec didn't repeat his sentiment regarding the number of gun license holders, and instead specified that one of the issues to be analyzed will be the issuing and revocation of licenses under the existing legislation.|$|E

5|$|Gregory legislated on the {{behaviour}} of {{the laity}} and the clergy.

40|$|A {{simple method}} for {{generating}} <b>trains</b> <b>of</b> high-contrast femtosecond pulses is proposed and demonstrated: a linearly polarized, frequency-chirped laser pulse is {{passed through a}} multiple-order wave plate and a linear polarizer.

In combination with an acousto-optic programmable dispersive filter this technique {{could be used to}} generate and control pulse trains with chirped spacing.
