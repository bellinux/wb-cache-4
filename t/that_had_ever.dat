5|$|The chapel {{underwent}} a two-year, $10 million restoration between 2000 and 2002. Despite {{the complexity of}} the work, the chapel remained open throughout the restoration. The project earned a New Jersey Historic Preservation Award in 2002, and the stone work won the 2004 Tucker Award for Renovation and Restoration from Stone World magazine. At the time, two experts working on the stained glass restoration called it the largest such project <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> been undertaken in the United States; too large for a single studio, it was divided among studios in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and New York.|$|E
5|$|Aruba competed at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China. Their {{participation}} marked their sixth Olympic appearance, {{and included}} the smallest number of athletes <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> represented Aruba in its history. Two Arubans {{competed in the}} Olympic games: Jan Roodzant participated as a swimmer, and Fiderd Vis participated in judo. The Aruban delegation arrived in Beijing between August 1 and August 4, including the athletes, coaches, and various officials from both the IOC and the Aruban Olympic Committee (Comité Olimpico Arubano, COA), Aruba's local Olympic committee. Fiderd Vis came to Beijing on special invitation from the IOC, which had observed his progress while he trained in Brazil. Vis was the flagbearer in the opening ceremony, while Roodzant was so in the closing ceremony. Both athletes were eliminated in the preliminary rounds on August 12, 2008; consequently, Aruba did not earn any medals.|$|E
5|$|At Kelmscott Press the {{perfection}} of book-making was under his constant supervision and practical assistance. It was his ambition to produce a perfect work to restore all the beauty of illuminated lettering, richness of gilding and grace of binding that {{used to make a}} volume the treasure of a king. His efforts were constantly directed towards giving the world at least one book that exceeded anything <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> appeared. Morris designed his type after the best examples of early printers, what he called his “golden type” which he copied after Jenson, Parautz, Coburger and others. With this in mind, Morris took equal care on the choice of his paper which he adapted to his subject with the same care that governed his selection of material for binding. As a result, few but only the wealthy could purchase his lavish works, mainly due to how intrinsic his work was. However, he realized that creating works in the manner of the middle ages was difficult in a profit-grinding society.|$|E

5|$|The trip to Lorraine in 1564 was a {{set back}} for his health but he soon {{recovered}} and embarked on his greatest project yet, a project which would extend far beyond his cartographic interests. The first element was the Chronologia, {{a list of all}} significant events {{since the beginning of the}} world compiled from his literal reading of the bible and no less than 123 other authors of genealogies and histories of every empire <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> existed. Mercator was the first to link historical dates of solar and lunar eclipses to Julian dates calculated mathematically from his knowledge of the motions of the sun, moon and Earth. He then fixed the dates of other events in Babylonian, Greek, Hebrew and Roman calendars relative to the eclipses that they recorded. The time origin was fixed from the genealogies of the Bible as 3965 years before the birth of Christ. This huge volume (400 pages) was greeted with acclaim by scholars throughout Europe and Mercator himself considered it to be his greatest achievement up to that time. On the other hand, the Catholic Church placed the work on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum (List of Prohibited Books) because Mercator included the deeds of Martin Luther. Had he published such a work in Louvain he would again be laying himself open to charges of heresy.|$|E

25|$|In June of {{this year}} two vessels were sent from Manila to New Spain. The {{flagship}} was the Nuestra Señora de los Remedios and the other vessel was the Sant Antonio. Many rich men of Manila, frightened by the past troubles, took passage in these vessels (especially the Sant Antonio) with their households and property, with the greatest wealth <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> left the Philippines. Both vessels experienced such severe storms during the voyage, that the flagship, without masts and greatly lightened and damaged, put back in distress to Manila. The Sant Antonio was swallowed up in the sea, {{and no one was}} saved.|$|E

Giles's Thomas of Canterbury, Oxford, 1845), which is probably an expansion of a sermon he preached in 1220, on occasion of the translation of the relics of Thomas Becket; the ceremony was the most splendid <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> been seen in England. He also wrote a life of Richard I, and other historical works and poems are attributed to him.|$|E

25|$|Servia had public {{rooms of}} a scale and luxury greater than {{previously}} known. Of the three decks, {{the upper deck}} consisted of deck-houses that included a first-class smoking room, and a luxuriously fitted ladies drawing room and a music room. The entrance and grand staircase was the largest <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> appeared on a liner, and was panelled in polished maple and ash. It led down to the a landing on the main deck which featured a library. Twenty-four first-class state-rooms were situated aft of this landing, while the first-class dining salon was situated forward. The dining salon could sit 220 of Servia's 480 first-class passengers on five long tables, and was richly decorated with carved panels and carpets. In the centre was an open well that rose 17ft to a skylight. Forward of the dining salon were a further 58 staterooms, followed by crew accommodation areas.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the Cape, van der Stel {{set high}} {{standards}} for wine production. He issued official decrees that imposed a high penalty on growers harvesting grapes {{before they were}} ripe or fermenting wine in dirty barrels. Van der Stel's dedication to quality soon garnered the wines of Constantia – and by association the Cape – a reputation for quality across Europe. Wine expert Hugh Johnson has described Constantia as the first New World wine to enjoy international acclaim. The early tasting notes from Batavia in 1692 remarked that the Cape wines of Constantia were the highest quality <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> been exported there. In his 1705 work, Description of the Cape of Good Hope, the Dutch writer Françcois Valentijn noted that the red wines of Constantia {{were on the same}} scale of quality as the best Persian wines or Lachryma Christi from Italy. He also went on to praise the quality of the Chenin blanc Steenwyn produced at the estate.|$|E
25|$|Hudson Taylor {{made the}} first {{decision}} to found the China Inland Mission at Brighton, England during his first furlough from China. Like his missionary forebear Karl Gützlaff and contemporary William Chalmers Burns, Taylor was convinced that Chinese clothing should be worn when engaged in missionary work in inland China. On 3 October 1865, Taylor sent John and Anne Stevenson and George Stott to China, where they arrived on February 6, 1866. Including the five missionaries previously sent to Ningbo -James Joseph Meadows, Jean Notman, Stephen Paul Barchet, and George and Anne Crombie, these eight were already in China when Taylor returned in 1866. On 26 May of that year, Taylor accompanied {{the largest group of}} missionaries <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> sailed to China on the Lammermuir. There were 16 missionaries as well as Hudson, his wife, Maria and their 4 children that became known as the Lammermuir Party. This journey took 4 months.|$|E

25|$|On 8 December 2009, APOEL fans created another {{impressive}} record. More than 6,000 fans of {{the team}} travelled to London at Stamford Bridge for the last match of the 2009–10 Champions League group D against Chelsea F.C. which ended in a 2–2 draw. This is the biggest number of fans of any Cypriot team <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> travelled away from Cyprus. A similar record created on 14 February 2012, in APOEL's participation to the 2011–12 UEFA Champions League last 16, when more than 5,000 APOEL fans travelled in France to support their team against Olympique Lyonnais. The match was held at Stade de Gerland and Olympique Lyonnais took a slender advantage into the second leg by winning 1–0. Also, on 4 April 2012, about 4,000 APOEL fans travelled to Santiago Bernabéu in Madrid, to support APOEL against Real Madrid for the return leg of the 2011–12 UEFA Champions League quarter-finals, in a match which Real Madrid won by 5–2.|$|E
25|$|Buckland {{began his}} {{investigation}} {{believing that the}} fossils in the cave were diluvial, that is {{that they had been}} deposited there by a deluge that had washed them from far away, possibly the Biblical flood. However, upon further investigation he realized that the cave had never been open to the surface through its roof, and that the only entrance <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> been open to the outside world was too small for the carcasses of animals as large as elephants or hippos to have floated in. He began to suspect that the animals had lived in the local area, and that the hyenas had used the cave as a den and brought in remains of the various animals they fed on. This hypothesis was supported by {{the fact that many of}} the bones showed signs of having been gnawed prior to fossilization, and by the presence of objects Buckland suspected to be fossilized hyena dung. Further analysis, including comparison with the dung of modern spotted hyenas living in menageries, confirmed the identification of the fossilized dung.|$|E
