500|$|Brian Crecente, {{editor-in-chief}} of Kotaku, praised the general use of {{light as a}} gameplay-mechanic. He commented on the episodic structure, saying it made the player feel satisfied even after short gameplay sessions. He also praised the overall storyline, having played the final episode thrice in a row, saying: [...] "For {{the first time in}} my life, I have experienced something that plays like a game but has the impact of a movie... Alan Wake is a powerful ride, an experience bound <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>you</b> thinking about it and wanting more for days after its completion." [...] He criticised the game for not providing enough information about Wake and his wife, despite being [...] "packed with memorable people", but concluded that the game [...] "redefines interactive storytelling".|$|E
500|$|David Balls of Digital Spy rated [...] "Work" [...] {{three stars}} out of five, writing that it [...] "bears all the {{ingredients}} of a smash, but lacks the killer blow <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>you</b> gasping for air." [...] Balls also noted that Ciara tends to rely on guest artists to guarantee a hit. The Houston Chronicle critic Joey Guerra called the song a [...] "blast of energy", but observed that it is [...] "too reminiscent of past Ciara/Elliott hits". Guerra said that [...] "A little variation would have made for a more dynamic tune." [...] Andy Kellman of Allmusic was more critical and called the song an [...] "over-stuffed dancefloor mess that does not benefit from Missy Elliott's hoarse hectorin". Jordan Sargent of PopMatters considered the song a letdown due to Ciara's [...] "lifeless" [...] vocal delivery. Dan Gennoe of Yahoo! UK & Ireland referred to the song as [...] "an underwhelming twitch which Missy surely wouldn't have had anywhere near {{one of her own}} albums." ...|$|E

500|$|Robert Copsey from Digital Spy {{gave the}} single {{five out of}} a {{possible}} five stars. Cospey felt that the song was representative of Kesha, writing the track [...] "sums up everything [...] – for all her scrubbiness, Auto-Tuning and boozy antics – is all about." [...] The song's chorus was praised in the review with Cospey writing that the song contained a [...] "hooky, robotic and all-round stonkingly huge chorus." [...] Cospey concluded his review on the song writing that [...] "Blow" [...] was the [...] "Jägermeister of pop singles: sweet, potent and guaranteed <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>you</b> buzzing for hours after." [...] The A.V. Club editors Steven Hyden and Genevieve Koski were positive of the song, giving it a B and a B+, respectively, with Hyden complimenting its [...] "top-notch bubblegum production" [...] while noting that it was more [...] "safe" [...] than many of Kesha's other hits. Koski, on the other hand, said that, due to the song's [...] "big, bold, and bumping production," [...] it allowed her to overlook Kesha's usual [...] "trashiness." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{the season}} finale, Bell talked about Coulson losing his arm, saying that [...] "he paid a price—that was {{important}} to us. You don't mess with {{the forces of nature}} without getting bitten, {{and the fact that he}} literally saved everyone on the ship by that crystal not shattering was a wonderful, heroic thing and showed you that at heart, Coulson is a heroic man whose actions back up his words." [...] Bell also talked about the cliffhanger involving Simmons being absorbed by a Kree monolith: [...] "When we first started talking about the Monolith, we knew that it needed to present a threat and we needed to demonstrate some of that threat and the promise of more story... It's easy to kill a character for shock value or whatever, and we did have a number of deaths this season, but ... we prefer <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>you</b> with something to talk about, to walk away with. This is something that came up in the room, we talked about what it meant ...

So we have to give him the opportunity to see how he can do in the first-team and he's got great ability." [...] Pogba was promoted to the club's reserve team permanently for the 2011–12 season and made his first appearance of the season on 15 August 2011 in the team's opening Premier Reserve League match against Arsenal.

500|$|The Sands of Time {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} upon launch. Edge said that, despite difficulty spikes caused by respawning enemies, [...] "the game cannot be commended highly enough". IGN's Matt Casamassina found the entire experience enjoyable, saying that [...] "Whether you're a diehard Prince of Persia fan or {{somebody with a}} mild interest in action-adventures, The Sands of Time is a must own -- a soon-to-be-classic worthy of a permanent place in your collection". 1UP.com, while pointing out the camera control as [...] "tricky", said that the game [...] "will make your chest explode if you've got a heart condition (in a good way, of course)". GameSpot's Greg Kasavin called it [...] "a game that can be recommended wholeheartedly". Both Eurogamer and Official PlayStation Magazine positively compared the game's aesthetics and presentation to Ico. Francesca Reyes of Official Xbox Magazine gave the game a good review, praising the story and general gameplay, but finding the combat difficult at times and lack of new skills. In closing, she praised the game's lasting appeal: [...] "When {{the whole thing is}} over, it's perfectly timed <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>you</b> wanting more. It's a stunning and rare achievement that makes you feel happy to be a gamer." [...] Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu gave the PS2 version a good review, saying that the action was smooth and challenging, bearing similarities to the original Prince of Persia, and one reviewer found the Prince [...] "colourful".|$|E

2500|$|They {{then head}} to the nearby village to look for Alverez' family. The gate to town is locked, but in return for freeing his soul, Horace opens it. They then {{encounter}} a broken bridge, but, impressed with Torque's efforts to kill him, Hermes helps them cross. As they near the village, however, they are separated by a fire, and Alverez goes on alone, telling Torque {{to get to the}} docks. As he arrives, he encounters Killjoy, who tells him to cure himself he must face what awaits him, and only by using the Rebirth Machine can he defeat it. Torque heads to the docks where he encounters a massive creature with a miniature version of himself protruding from its stomach. Torque fights and defeats the creature, finally remembering what happened to his family; they were murdered by two hitmen, one of whom told Torque [...] "the Colonel sends his regards. Back in Eastern, he warned you, but you didn't listen. He said <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>you</b> alive. Only you. Enjoy your new life." [...] Torque heads to the docks and is picked up by the coastguard.
