5|$|Assiniboine {{returned}} to Canada in June and was briefly {{used as a}} troop transport before a boiler room fire on 4 July effectively ended her career. She was paid off on 8 August and placed on the disposal list. Whilst on tow to the breakers in Baltimore, she ran aground near East Point, Prince Edward Island. Attempts to get her off failed, and she was left <b>to</b> <b>rust</b> until eventually being broken up in place in 1952.|$|E
5|$|The funding {{produced}} by the Battleship Texas Commission was {{not up to the}} task of maintaining the ship. Consequently, years of neglect resulted in cracks and gaps in coated surfaces, water intrusion, and steel deterioration. Paint in interior spaces began to crack, then flake, exposing metal surfaces underneath, which began <b>to</b> <b>rust.</b> At the same time, pipes open to the sea ultimately failed, flooding various voids and bunkers.|$|E

5|$|Although B. rufimanus {{does not}} {{directly}} affect faba bean yield, it alters the aesthetic quality of the seeds {{as well as its}} germinative properties and ensuing yield is therefore an issue for human consumption and seed markets. A maximum 3% damage threshold is set for seeds targeting market for human consumption. Damaged seeds (seeds from which adults have emerged) might have lower germination rates with 13% reduced germination observed in the lab, but no difference observed in the field. Yield from infested beans are lower (-45% to -70%) than for healthy ones (Epperlein, 1992). In addition, damaged seeds have increased susceptibility <b>to</b> <b>rust</b> and root diseases.|$|E
5|$|During {{trials of}} the first submarines, the {{propulsion}} system {{was found to be}} prone to failure for a variety of reasons. Most failures were attributed to the fifteen-tank diesel fuel system: the tanks were designed to fill with salt water as they were emptied to maintain neutral buoyancy, but water would regularly enter the engines due to a combination of poor design, gravity separation of the fuel and water being insufficient, and operator error resulting from poor training. Problems were also caused by bacterial contamination of the diesel fuel, which, along with the salt water, would cause the fuel pumps <b>to</b> <b>rust</b> and other components to seize. The fuel-related issues were solved by installing coalescers, improving training and operational procedures, and adding biocides to the fuel.|$|E
5|$|The main {{structure}} of the fruit body consists primarily of an agglutination (mass) of interwoven skeletal hyphae, which are golden- to rust-brown. The hyphae are unbranched, forming long tubes 2 to 3.6μm in diameter, enveloping a lumen of variable thickness. There are also hyaline generative hyphae. These hyphae have thinner walls than the skeletal hyphae, and are also septate (possessing of septa), but are sometimes branched. They measure 2 to 3μm in diameter. The flesh, again, is primarily made up of skeletal hyphae with some generative hyphae. The thick-walled skeletal hyphae are a yellow-brown <b>to</b> <b>rust</b> brown, and are slightly less agglutinate. The hyphae in the flesh are a little smaller; the skeletal hyphae measure 1.8 to 3.4μm in diameter, while the generative hyphae measure 1.5 to 2.6μm in diameter.|$|E

Rust sales hit one million after two months as an Early Access title and by the end of 2015, Rust had sold over 3 million copies. By February 2014, Rust had {{overtaken}} Garry's Mod in terms of sales, making over , and by March 2017, the game had sold more than 5.2 million units, alongside more than 1.2 million in-game skins sold. Other games, such as The Forest, , , and 7 Days to Die were compared <b>to</b> <b>Rust</b> due to the open world survival aspect, along with having crafting mechanics similar <b>to</b> <b>Rust.</b>|$|E

25|$|In {{extremely}} humid locations, adding insulation to {{an already}} well-insulated tank may cause condensation leading <b>to</b> <b>rust,</b> mold, or other operational problems so some air flow must be maintained, usually by convection caused by waste heat, but in particularly humid conditions such ventilation may be fan-assisted.|$|E

25|$|By 2000, a high-occupancy vehicle lane {{was added}} to the {{eastbound}} Gowanus Expressway to serve traffic heading toward Manhattan. Over the years, the viaduct structure of the Gowanus Expressway has deteriorated. In 1998, a $16 million feasibility study for a tunnel for the Gowanus Expressway was awarded. The New York State Department of Transportation was considering putting the road in a tunnel, but in November 2011 the Federal Highway Administration canceled the project. The viaduct's vertical steel supports show material missing due <b>to</b> <b>rust,</b> but the federal government promises it won't collapse.|$|E
25|$|The {{next major}} design change came in 1968 with the {{introduction}} of the Type F pillar box. This was conceived by Vandyke Engineering and proposed to the Post Office as a cheaper alternative to the traditional cast box. It was fabricated in sheet steel with welded construction. Unfortunately, the British climate did not suit the use of galvanised steel (a problem often seen with the 1940 and 1988 pattern of lamp box) and the Vandyke pillars soon began <b>to</b> <b>rust</b> badly. The very last one was removed from service at Colmore Row in Birmingham in 2002.|$|E
25|$|In 1925, she {{was invited}} by William Richard Motherwell, the federal Minister of Agriculture, to help manage {{the newly opened}} Dominion Rust Research Laboratory at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, {{established}} as a response <b>to</b> <b>rust</b> outbreaks in 1916, 1919, and 1921. She was appointed the laboratory's senior plant pathologist, a position she maintained until retirement, and brought with her former student Thorvaldur Johnson as her research assistant. She established an annual stem rust survey in Western Canada, discovering a diversity of races in rust populations, which eventually enabled her to discover and catalogue the wheat species and cross-species resistant to stem rust.|$|E

25|$|Wheat is {{a staple}} crop from Canada. To help homesteaders attain an {{abundance}} harvest in a foreshortened growing season, varieties of wheat were {{developed at the}} beginning of the twentieth century. Red Fife was the first strain; it was a wheat which could be seeded in the fall and sprout in the early spring. Red Fife ripened nearly two weeks sooner and was a harder wheat than other spring wheats. Dr. C. Saunders, experimented further with Red Fife, and developed Marquis Wheat, which was resistant <b>to</b> <b>rust</b> and came to maturity within 100 days. Some other types of wheat grown are durum, spelt, and winter wheat. In recent years, Canadian farmers have also begun to grow rice.|$|E
25|$|Some common metals oxidize {{extremely}} {{rapidly in}} air. Titanium and aluminium oxidize instantaneously {{in contact with}} the oxygen in the air. These metals form an extremely thin layer of oxidized metal on the surface which bonds with the underlying metal. This thin layer of oxide protects the underlying layers of the metal from the air preventing the entire metal from oxidizing. These metals are used in applications where corrosion resistance is important. Iron, in contrast, has an oxide that forms in air and water, called rust, that does not bond with the iron and therefore does not stop the further oxidation of the iron. Thus iron left exposed to air and water will continue <b>to</b> <b>rust</b> until all of the iron is oxided.|$|E
25|$|The TSPC {{had also}} planned to realign {{the road at}} Lake Mohansic and replace the grade {{intersection}} with an interchange. In 1962, while the commission was finishing the northern section of the Taconic, the EHPA began that project. The original parkway became the northbound roadway and a new southbound one was built. The EHPA's improvements made the road safer and more efficient for the commuters who now used it, but changed {{the character of the}} road, widening it and replacing its concrete pavement with asphalt and its wooden guardrails with steel ones that were allowed <b>to</b> <b>rust</b> in order to approximate the color of their predecessors. In 1964, I-84 was built through Dutchess and Putnam counties, giving the middle of the Taconic a limited-access intersecting route that made it possible to access the Danbury and Newburgh areas via the parkway.|$|E
50|$|Knowledge {{about the}} use of iron spread from the Middle East to Greece and the Aegean region by 1000BC and had reached western and central Europe by 600BC.
