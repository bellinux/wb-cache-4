But it was his most comprehensive work on plants, the 1753 publication Species Plantarum that formalised <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> genus with a single epithet to form <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> species as two words, the binomial thus making secure the biological system of binomial nomenclature. In these works Linnaeus used a third name as a variety within a species. These varieties included both wild and horticultural variants. The horticultural varieties were still written in Latin and some have persisted to this day.|$|E
