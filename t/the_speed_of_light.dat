5|$|In 1845, Arago {{suggested}} to Fizeau and Foucault that {{they attempt to}} measure <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>light.</b> Sometime in 1849, however, {{it appears that the}} two had a falling out, and they parted ways pursuing separate means of performing this experiment. In 1848−49, Fizeau used, not a rotating mirror, but a toothed wheel apparatus to perform an absolute measurement of <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> in air. In 1850, Fizeau and Foucault both used rotating mirror devices to perform relative measures of <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> in air versus water. Foucault used a scaled-up version of the rotating mirror apparatus to perform an absolute measurement of <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> in 1862. Subsequent experiments performed by Marie Alfred Cornu in 1872–76 and by Albert A. Michelson in 1877–1931 used improved versions of the toothed wheel and rotating mirror experiments to make steadily more accurate estimates of <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>light.</b>|$|E

5|$|Until {{the early}} modern period, it was not known whether light {{travelled}} instantaneously or at a very fast finite speed.

5|$|According to Einstein's {{theory of}} special relativity, as an electron's speed {{approaches}} <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>light,</b> from an observer's {{point of view}} its relativistic mass increases, thereby making it {{more and more difficult}} to accelerate it from within the observer's frame of reference. The speed of an electron can approach, but never reach, <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> in a vacuum, c. However, when relativistic electrons—that is, electrons moving at a speed close to c—are injected into a dielectric medium such as water, where the local speed of light is significantly less than c, the electrons temporarily travel faster than light in the medium. As they interact with the medium, they generate a faint light called Cherenkov radiation.|$|E

5|$|In 1889 {{there was}} no {{generally}} accepted theory regarding the nature of light but by 1960 the wavelength of specific light spectra could give a more accurate and reproducible value than a prototype metre.

By 1983 it was accepted that <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> in vacuum was constant and that this constant provided a more reproducible procedure for measuring length.

5|$|The {{concept of}} a Universe filled with a luminiferous aether {{remained}} in vogue among some scientists until the early 20th century.

However, the null result indicated something was wrong with the concept. The idea of the luminiferous aether was then abandoned.

Christiaan Huygens combined this estimate with an estimate for {{the diameter of the}} Earth's orbit to obtain an estimate of speed of light of , 26% lower than the actual value.|$|E

50|$|A {{preferred}} {{reference frame}} is a reference frame {{in which the}} laws of physics take on a special form. The ability to make measurements which show <b>the</b> one-way <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> to be different from its two-way speed would, in principle, enable a preferred reference frame to be determined.

50|$|Howard Percy Robertson (1949) {{extended}} the Lorentz transformation by adding additional parameters.He assumed a preferred frame of reference, in which <b>the</b> two-way <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>light,</b> i.e. <b>the</b> average <b>speed</b> from source to observer and back, is isotropic, {{while it is}} anisotropic in relatively moving frames due to the parameters employed. In addition, Robertson used the Poincaré-Einstein synchronization in all frames, making <b>the</b> one-way <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> isotropic in all of them.|$|R
5|$|The {{interference}} pattern {{between the two}} beams when the light is recombined at the observer depends upon the transit times over the two paths, {{and can be used}} to calculate <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> {{as a function of the}} speed of the water.|$|E
5|$|A photon {{is a type}} of {{elementary}} particle, the quantum of the electromagnetic field including electromagnetic radiation such as light, and the force carrier for the electromagnetic force (even when static via virtual particles). The photon has zero rest mass and always moves at <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> within a vacuum.|$|E
5|$|Another way {{to measure}} <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> is to {{independently}} measure the frequency f and wavelength λ of an electromagnetic wave in vacuum. The value of c can then be found by using the relation c=fλ. One option is to measure the resonance frequency of a cavity resonator. If {{the dimensions of the}} resonance cavity are also known, these can be used to determine the wavelength of the wave. In 1946, Louis Essen and A.C. Gordon-Smith established the frequency for a variety of normal modes of microwaves of a microwave cavity of precisely known dimensions. The dimensions were established to an accuracy of about ±0.8μm using gauges calibrated by interferometry. As the wavelength of the modes was known from the geometry of the cavity and from electromagnetic theory, knowledge of the associated frequencies enabled a calculation of <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>light.</b>|$|E
50|$|Although {{experiments}} {{cannot be}} done in which <b>the</b> one-way <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> is measured independently of any clock synchronization scheme, {{it is possible to}} carry out experiments that measure a change in <b>the</b> one-way <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> due, for example, to the motion of the source. Such experiments are the De Sitter double star experiment (1913), conclusively repeated in the x-ray spectrum by K. Brecher in 1977;or the terrestrial experiment by Alväger, et al. (1963); they show that, when measured in an inertial frame, <b>the</b> one-way <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> is independent <b>of</b> the motion of the source within the limits of experimental accuracy.
