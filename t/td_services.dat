40|$|Abstract. Service-oriented {{systems support}} process {{evolution}} {{by allowing the}} replacement of a service S by another <b>service</b> <b>T.</b> To maintain proper interaction in the overall system, <b>service</b> <b>T</b> should interact properly with all controllers (i. e., in all contexts) of service S. To support the construction of such <b>services</b> <b>T,</b> we compute operating guidelines that represent all services that can replace service S. Our computation relies on the additional notion of a maximal controller. Maximal controllers {{can also be used}} for deciding whether a <b>service</b> <b>T</b> can replace <b>service</b> S, and for computing a public view that hides service details that are not relevant for controllers. ...|$|R

40|$|This PhD by Public Works {{demonstrates}} how three key topic areas with convergent themes {{emerge from a}} systematic analysis of 21 submitted public works. These are: The personalisation policy agenda in adult social care and mental health; Service user participation; and LGB (<b>T)</b> <b>service</b> user experience. The final synthesis brings together these three topics and core themes as a coherent critique of how the personalisation policy has been constructed and implemented. It examines {{the way in which}} this reflects some of the broader political, operational and systemic barriers to service user participation, the use of experiential knowledge and evidence and the recognition of the full diversity and complexity of people who use mental health and social care services (with particular reference to LGB (<b>T)</b> <b>service</b> user experience). The resultant exploration and argument is informed by my service user perspective and associated methodologies. This context statement shows how the knowledge for the PhD by Public Works was produced, how it makes a significant contribution to knowledge in the field and to the broader sphere of social care and mental health research methodology and service user epistemology...|$|R
