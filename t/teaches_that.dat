5|$|Final Damnation: Finally, {{those who}} persist in {{living in a}} state of mortal sin and do not repent before death subject {{themselves}} to hell, an everlasting separation from God. The Church <b>teaches</b> <b>that</b> no one is condemned to hell without having freely decided to reject God. No one is predestined to hell and no one can determine with absolute certainty who has been condemned to hell. Catholicism <b>teaches</b> <b>that</b> through God's mercy a person can repent at any point before death, be illuminated with the truth of the Catholic faith, and thus obtain salvation. Some Catholic theologians have speculated that the souls of unbaptised infants and non-Christians without mortal sin but who die in original sin are assigned to limbo, although this is not an official dogma of the Church.|$|E

5|$|Gnostics read John but {{interpreted}} {{it differently}} from the way non-Gnostics did. Gnosticism taught that salvation came from gnosis, secret knowledge, and Gnostics did not see Jesus as a savior but a revealer of knowledge. Barnabas Lindars asserts that the gospel <b>teaches</b> <b>that</b> salvation can only be achieved through revealed wisdom, specifically belief in (literally belief into) Jesus.|$|E
5|$|In Muslim families, {{women and}} men are {{considered}} equal, {{but not in the}} westernised sense. The Quran <b>teaches</b> <b>that</b> the minds of males and females work differently and are generally different biologically. Therefore, Islam grants different rights to the husband and wife. One such right which the wife owes to her husband is being head of the household.|$|E
5|$|The Catholic Church <b>teaches</b> <b>that,</b> {{immediately}} after death, {{the soul of}} each person will receive a particular judgement from God, based on their sins {{and their relationship to}} Christ. This teaching also attests to another day when Christ will sit in universal judgement of all mankind. This final judgement, according to the church's teaching, will bring an end to human history and mark the beginning of both a new and better heaven and earth ruled by God in righteousness.|$|E
40|$|Fertility {{regulation}} is taught didactically in 82 of 94 medical school departments {{of obstetrics and}} gynecology in the United States and Canada, but students are given clinical experience in only 59 medical schools, according to a survey conducted in 1964 by a committee of the American Public Health Association. Legal prohibitions impeded teaching in 1964 in two States and in all of Canada. Nearly all schools <b>teach</b> <b>that</b> help with fertility regulation should be offered for medical and socioeconomic stress, and most <b>teach</b> <b>that</b> it should be offered routinely in premarital counselling and in the postpartum period, but only two-thirds <b>teach</b> <b>that</b> this help should be given to unmarried adults and only one-third <b>teach</b> <b>that</b> any person requesting help with fertility regulation should receive it...|$|R
50|$|The {{rationale}} behind placing prayer {{notes in the}} Wall has been traced to the Midrashic <b>teaching</b> <b>that</b> the Divine Presence has never moved from the Western Wall, and the Kabbalistic <b>teaching</b> <b>that</b> all prayers ascend to Heaven through the Temple Mount, which the Western Wall abuts.|$|R
2500|$|Rabbi Jeremiah ben Eleazar {{interpreted}} the words, [...] "and {{he brought her}} to the man," [...] in [...] to <b>teach</b> <b>that</b> God acted as best man to Adam, <b>teaching</b> <b>that</b> a man of eminence should not think it amiss to act as best man for a lesser man.|$|R
5|$|Of its seven sacraments the Eucharist is the {{principal}} one, celebrated liturgically in the Mass. The church <b>teaches</b> <b>that</b> through consecration by a priest the sacrificial bread and wine become the body and blood of Christ. Virgin Mary is venerated in the Catholic Church as Mother of God and Queen of Heaven, honoured in dogmas and devotions. Its teaching includes sanctification through faith and evangelisation of the Gospel and Catholic social teaching, which emphasises support for the sick, the poor, and the afflicted through the corporal and spiritual works of mercy. The Catholic Church is the largest non-government provider of {{education and health care}} in the world.|$|E
5|$|Process {{theology}} {{argues that}} God is not omnipotent: rather than coercion, {{he has the}} power of divine persuasion, but he cannot force his will. Griffin, a prominent process theologian, argues that God feels {{the pain of the}} world (both physically and emotionally) and does everything within his power to achieve good, but he can neither force beings to be good nor prevent evil because he does not play a coercive role in the world. Process theology <b>teaches</b> <b>that,</b> rather than creating the world ex nihilo (as Augustine proposed), God created it out of a pre-existent chaos.|$|E
5|$|Scholars of {{religion}} Paul Ingram and Frederick Streng {{argued that the}} teachings of Buddhism challenge Augustine's view of good and evil, proposing a dualism in which good and evil have equal value instead of casting good over evil, as Augustine did. This {{is similar to the}} Manicheist account of good and evil– that the two are equal and in conflict– though Buddhism <b>teaches</b> <b>that</b> the two will come to a final conclusion and transcend the conflict. Ingram and Streng argued that the Augustinian theodicy fails to account for the existence of evil before Adam's sin, which Genesis presents {{in the form of the}} serpent's temptation.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{denominations}} <b>teach</b> <b>that</b> one enters heaven at {{the moment}} of death (2 Corinthians 5:6-8), while others <b>teach</b> <b>that</b> this occurs at a later time (the Last Judgment). Some Christians maintain that entry into Heaven awaits such time as [...] "When the form of this world has passed away." ...|$|R

50|$|LDS leaders <b>teach</b> <b>that</b> {{family and}} {{societal}} relationships {{are a part}} of mortal life for many purposes, including the need to learn to show love, acceptance, and compassion in ways that continue to allow agency. They <b>teach</b> <b>that</b> unrighteous dominion is never acceptable to God, and that with the agency given to men is the expectation that when they marry, they will treat their wife and children with love, respect, tenderness, and material and emotional support. LDS leaders <b>teach</b> <b>that</b> men should treat women as equal partners in all decisions in the family.|$|R
5|$|The Catholic Church <b>teaches</b> <b>that</b> {{it is the}} One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic church {{founded by}} Jesus Christ in his Great Commission, that its bishops are the {{successor}}s of Christ's apostles, and that the Pope is the successor to Saint Peter to whom primacy was conferred by Jesus Christ. It maintains that it practises the original Christian faith, reserving infallibility, passed down by sacred tradition. The Latin Church, the Eastern Catholic Churches, and institutes such as mendicant orders and enclosed monastic orders reflect a variety of theological and spiritual emphases in the Church.|$|E
5|$|The Catholic Church <b>teaches</b> <b>that</b> {{marriage}} is a social and spiritual bond {{between a man and}} a woman, ordered towards the good of the spouses and procreation of children; according to Catholic teachings on sexual morality, it is the only appropriate context for sexual activity. A Catholic marriage, or any marriage between baptised individuals of any Christian denomination, is viewed as a sacrament. A sacramental marriage, once consummated, cannot be dissolved except by death. The Church recognises certain conditions, such as freedom of consent, as required for any marriage to be valid; In addition, the Church sets specific rules and norms, known as canonical form, that Catholics must follow.|$|E
5|$|The Christian {{religion}} {{is based on}} the teachings of Jesus Christ, who lived and preached in the 1st century AD in the province of Judea of the Roman Empire. Catholic doctrine <b>teaches</b> <b>that</b> the contemporary Catholic Church is the continuation of this early Christian community established by Jesus. Christianity spread throughout the early Roman Empire, despite persecutions due to conflicts with the pagan state religion. Emperor Constantine legalised the practice of Christianity in 313, and it became the state religion in 380. Germanic invaders of Roman territory in the 5th and 6th centuries, many of whom had previously adopted Arian Christianity, eventually adopted Catholicism to ally themselves with the papacy and the monasteries.|$|E
500|$|The Reformed confessions <b>teach</b> <b>that</b> Christ's true {{body and}} blood are really present in the Lord's Supper. Regarding what is {{received}} in the Supper, the Reformed tradition does not disagree with the position of Catholicism or Lutheranism. Reformed confessions <b>teach</b> <b>that</b> partakers of the Supper, {{in the words of}} the Belgic Confession, partake of [...] "the proper and natural body and the proper blood of Christ". However, they deny the explanations for this eating and drinking made by Lutherans and Catholics. Against Catholics, Reformed confessions <b>teach</b> <b>that</b> the bread and wine of the Supper do not become the blood and body of Christ, as in the Catholic view of transubstantiation. Against Lutherans, Reformed confessions do not <b>teach</b> <b>that</b> partakers of the Supper physically eat Christ's body and drink his blood with their mouths (...) [...] While Reformed confessions <b>teach</b> <b>that</b> in the Supper Christ is received in both his divine and human natures, the manner of eating is believed to be spiritual (...) [...] The {{body and blood}} of Christ remain fleshly substance, but they are communicated to the partaker in a spiritual manner.|$|R

5|$|The Temple <b>teaches</b> <b>that</b> {{the true}} self, or essence, is immortal, and Xeper {{is the ability}} to align {{consciousness}} with this essence. Aquino taught that there is an afterlife for those who have reached the necessary level of individual development. This afterlife could occur in the individual's subjective universe. Those unable to reach this level dissolve into non-existence when the physical body dies. Self-initiation is knowledge understood as a conjunction of intellect and intuition. In keeping with its emphasis on the individual, the Temple encourages their members to celebrate their own birthday, and does not prescribe any other calendar of religious festivities.|$|E
5|$|According {{to church}} doctrine, the sacraments {{of the church}} require the proper form, matter, and intent to be validly {{celebrate}}d. In addition, the Canon Laws for both the Latin Church and the Eastern Catholic Churches govern who may licitly celebrate certain sacraments, as well as strict rules about who may receive the sacraments. Notably, because the Church <b>teaches</b> <b>that</b> Christ {{is present in the}} Eucharist, those who are conscious of being in a state of mortal sin are forbidden to receive the sacrament until they have received absolution through the sacrament of Reconciliation (Penance). Catholics are normally obliged to abstain from eating {{for at least an hour}} before receiving the sacrament. Non-Catholics such are ordinarily prohibited from receiving the Eucharist as well.|$|E
5|$|Basil Mitchell {{responded to}} Flew's falsification {{principle}} {{with his own}} parable. He described an underground resistance soldier who meets a stranger who claims to be leading the resistance movement. The stranger tells the soldier to keep faith in him, {{even if he is}} seen to be fighting for the other side. The soldier's faith is regularly tested as he observes the stranger fighting for both sides, but his faith remains strong. Mitchell's parable <b>teaches</b> <b>that</b> although evidence can challenge a religious belief, a believer still has reason to hold their views. He argued that although a believer will not allow anything to count decisively against his beliefs, the theist still accepts the existence of evidence which could count against religious belief.|$|E

5|$|Raëlism (also {{known as}} Raëlianism or the Raëlian movement) is a UFO {{religion}} that {{was founded in}} 1974 by Claude Vorilhon (b. 1946), now known as Raël. The Raëlian Movement <b>teaches</b> <b>that</b> life on Earth was scientifically created by a species of extraterrestrials, which they call the Elohim. Members of this species appeared human when having personal contacts with {{the descendants of the}} humans that they made. They purposefully misinformed early humanity that they were angels, cherubim, or gods. Raëlians believe that messengers, or prophets, of the Elohim include Buddha, Jesus, and others who informed humans of each era. The founder of Raëlism received the final message of the Elohim and that its purpose is to inform the world about Elohim and that if humans become aware and peaceful enough, they wish to be welcomed by them.|$|E
5|$|The Assembly {{worked in}} the Reformed Protestant {{theological}} tradition, also known as Calvinism. It took the Bible as the authoritative word of God, from which all theological reflection must be based. The divines were committed to the Reformed doctrine of predestination—that God chooses certain men to be saved and enjoy eternal life rather than eternal punishment. There was some disagreement at the Assembly over the doctrine of particular redemption—that Christ died only for those chosen for salvation. The Assembly also held to Reformed covenant theology, a framework for interpreting the Bible. The Assembly's Confession {{is the first of}} the Reformed confessions to teach a doctrine called the covenant of works, which <b>teaches</b> <b>that</b> before the fall of man, God promised eternal life to Adam on condition that he perfectly obeyed God.|$|E
5|$|The {{prosperity}} theology {{teaching of}} positive confession stems from its proponents' view of scripture. The Bible {{is seen as}} a faith contract between God and believers; God is understood to be faithful and just, so believers must fulfill their end of the contract to receive God's promises. This leads to a belief in positive confession, the doctrine that believers may claim whatever they desire from God, simply by speaking it. Prosperity theology <b>teaches</b> <b>that</b> the Bible has promised prosperity for believers, so positive confession means that believers are speaking in faith what God has already spoken about them. Positive confession is practiced to bring about what is already believed in; faith itself is a confession, and speaking it brings it into reality.|$|E
