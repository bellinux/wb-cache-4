Cleveland gets nervous at the audition and {{in an effort to}} calm him, Peter removes Cleveland’s clothes and then his own. The producers see this and Brian apologizes for what happened with Peter and Cleveland--Brian begins to explain how Cleveland and his wife recently divorced and how Cleveland's confused about what he really wants in a relationship.|$|E

Harada also traveled to the United Kingdom and United States <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>some</b> of the American and British airmen he had fought against, including the American ace Joe Foss who {{is believed to have been}} the pilot who shot down his plane.

5|$|Critics {{primarily}} found {{fault with}} the game's length, as {{the bulk of}} the game's content can be completed in only a few hours. Will Tuttle of GameSpy questioned whether Harmonix limited the number of songs on release knowing {{that there would be a}} market for the game's downloadable content in the near future. The low number of songs, along with the new themed instrument controllers, were found to make the game an expensive proposition for those new to rhythm games. Due to the limited selection of songs on the disc, some critics questioned the specific inclusion of certain songs or the exclusion of more popular songs. Furthermore, critics claimed that the game's complete dedication to the Beatles, without the option for cross-compatibility with Rock Band or vice versa, can potentially lead to tedious play sessions with minimal variety, hampering the social nature of the game. Justin Haywald of 1UP.com considered that in attaching the Rock Band name to the game's title, there was a certain expectation on an expandable library of songs and interoperability with previous Rock Band titles, which The Beatles: Rock Band failed <b>to</b> <b>meet.</b> <b>Some</b> players coming from previous versions of Rock Band would consider the songs in The Beatles: Rock Band to lack technical challenge. However, the less difficult note tracks were seen to be a welcoming benefit for newcomers to the series as well as those attempting to sing along with the harmony portions of the game. For purist fans, some critics noted that the game purposely avoids certain aspects of the Beatles' history; former band members such as Pete Best or collaborators such as Billy Preston or Eric Clapton are never seen during gameplay. Concerning supplemental content, Hilary Goldstein of IGN felt the extra features could have been more substantial, especially in comparison to the additional material that accompanies the remastered CDs.|$|E

25|$|Repeated interviews, written tests, medical examinations, {{physical}} fitness tests, comprehensive background investigations, fingerprinting, drug testing, a police oral board interview, a polygraph examination and consultation with a psychologist are common practices used {{to review the}} suitability of candidates.

Police oral boards are the most subjective {{part of the process}} and often disqualifies the biggest portion of qualified candidates. Departments maintain records of past applicants under review, and refer to them in the case of either reapplication or requests between other agencies.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to Open Studios Cyprus, {{there are a}} number of privately owned galleries and exhibition spaces. Details and dates for the regular events can always be found in the local English newspapers, such as Cyprus Weekly and Cyprus Monthly. Maintained by the Paphos Municipality, is the popular exhibition and conference space, Palia Ilektriki. In the centre of the town, this converted electricity building plays host to both conferences and exhibitions throughout the year. In 2009, 2010 and 2011 Open Studios Cyprus, used this location to launch the event with an Opening Art Exhibition.

25|$|Robert Neighbors {{recorded}} one of {{the best}} known meetings with Old Owl. While he was a Texas Indian Agent for the Republic in 1845, Major Neighbors was at a Tonkawa camp. Old Owl arrived with 40 warriors, and in a manner the Major called “most insolent,” demanded that the Tonkawa feed the war party and their horses, and provide for them entertainment. The Tonkawas, in fear of their lives, provided 40 women, food and shelter, and cared for the horses at once. Neighbors, who had just been appointed Indian Agent for all Texas Indians including the Comanche, took this opportunity <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>some</b> of his new charges, and told them he was hopeful of civilizing them. Old Owl, introduced to Neighbors, complimented him on his fine blue coat. Neighbors, understanding the meaning of this compliment, presented the Chief with the coat immediately. Other warriors admired his pants, boots, and other clothing, and soon Neighbors was standing only in a nightshirt.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{the cuts}} to coal {{production}} and falling percentage of coal {{in the energy}} mix, electricity consumption {{is expected to grow}} by 3.6-4 percent over 2016 to 2020 according to the Thirteenth Plan (2016–2020). According to the same five-year plan, coal power capacity will be expanded from 960 GW to under 1,100 GW by the end of 2020 <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>some</b> of the continued growth in electricity demand. Indeed, in the first two months of 2016, China had added 22 GW of capacity, 14 GW of which was coal, according to the China Electricity Council. To curtail the continued rapid construction of coal fired power plants, strong action was taken in April of the same year by the National Energy Administration (NEA), which issued a directive curbing construction {{in many parts of the}} country. This was followed up in January 2017 when the NEA canceled a further 103 coal power plants, eliminating 120 gigawatts of future coal-fired capacity, despite the resistance of local authorities mindful of the need to create jobs. The decreasing rate of construction is due to the realization that too many power plants had been built and some existing plants were being used far below capacity.|$|E
25|$|Natives on Private Estates Ordinance, 1928 was {{a colonial}} {{ordinance}} {{passed by the}} Legislative council of the Nyasaland protectorate, now Malawi, (a body mainly of senior colonial officials, with a minority of nominated members representing European residents) to regulate {{the conditions under which}} African tenants who farmed land on estates owned by European settlers within that protectorate. The legislation corrected some of the worst abuses of the system of thangata, under which tenants were required to work in lieu of paying rent. However, it failed in its intention of encouraging these tenants to increase production on the undeveloped land in those estates because of the world-wide economic downturn in the Great Depression of the 1930s. Tensions between estate owners and tenants continued in the 1940s and early 1950s over evictions and the tenants’ desire to market their produce freely. The legislation was modified in 1952 <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>some</b> of these problems, but only the colonial government's purchase of estate lands to resettle former tenants after 1952 and final abolition of thangata by the Africans on Private Estates Ordinance, 1962, passed shortly before independence, created an African peasantry with free access to farming land.|$|E
25|$|As {{the demand}} for direct labour on tobacco estates {{declined}} with collapse {{in the market for}} flue-cured tobacco, the estate owners claimed that they had insufficient work for their labour tenants to meet their obligations under the thangata system and that they had become rent-free squatters who should be liable to be evicted. The owners also complained of the significant numbers resident on their estate who paid no rent under non-disturbance clauses. <b>To</b> <b>meet</b> <b>some</b> of the estate owners’ demands but also give some protection to tenants the protectorate government introduced the Natives on Private Estates Ordinance 1928, which abolishing all rights under non-disturbance clauses, but gave tenants tenancies with a five-year term and with maximum rents fixed by District Rent Boards. Rents could be satisfied in cash, by labour or by selling economic crops to the owner. Blantyre and East Africa Ltd accepted tobacco in lieu of cash rents on some estates but others had become crowded and during the 1930s it obtained cash rents from subsistence farmers on these instead. The company ceased direct operations on its estates in Zomba and Chiradzulu districts, and in 1929 there were no Europeans resident on its estates in those districts, only an agent living in Zomba who visited them periodically.|$|E

25|$|Just {{before this}} time, Rameau {{had made the}} {{acquaintance}} of the powerful financier Alexandre Le Riche de La Poupelinière, who became his patron until 1753. La Pouplinière's mistress (and later, wife), Thérèse des Hayes, was Rameau's pupil and a great admirer of his music. In 1731, Rameau became the conductor of La Pouplinière's private orchestra, which was of an extremely high quality. He held the post for 22 years; he was succeeded by Johann Stamitz and then Gossec. La Pouplinière's salon enabled Rameau <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>some</b> of the leading cultural figures of the day, including Voltaire, who soon began collaborating with the composer. Their first project, the tragédie en musique Samson, was abandoned because an opera on a religious theme by Voltaire—a notorious critic of the Church—was likely to be banned by the authorities. Meanwhile, Rameau had introduced his new musical style into the lighter genre of the opéra-ballet with the highly successful Les Indes galantes. It was followed by two tragédies en musique, Castor et Pollux (1737) and Dardanus (1739), and another opéra-ballet, Les fêtes d'Hébé (also 1739). All these operas of the 1730s are among Rameau's most highly regarded works. However, the composer followed them with six years of silence, in which the only work he produced was {{a new version of}} Dardanus (1744). The reason for this interval in the composer's creative life is unknown, although it is possible he had a falling-out with the authorities at the Académie royale de la musique.|$|E

Many critics of Berlusconi accused him of using his power primarily to protect his own business ventures.

Nevertheless, {{in spite of}} their opinion of its drawbacks, Car and Driver drove a GT500 in their 2007 [...] "Lightning Lap" [...] road test at Virginia International Raceway and found that the car's on-track performance lap time of 3:05.9 fell just below that of the Porsche 911 Turbo (3:05.8) and faster than that of the Lotus Elise (3:09.3), Porsche Cayman S (3:09.5) and BMW M6 (3:10.0).|$|E
