40|$|PURPOSE: Suicide is a {{major health}} problem in Korea. Extensive media {{exposure}} of celebrity suicide may induce imitative suicide, a phenomenon called the Werther effect. We examined <b>the</b> increased <b>suicide</b> risk following <b>the</b> <b>suicides</b> of an entertainer and a politician, and identified <b>the</b> relative <b>suicide</b> risks. METHODS: News articles about <b>the</b> celebrity <b>suicides</b> were obtained from three major newspapers and analysed for quantitative and qualitative features. Imitative suicide risk was investigated by applying a Poisson time series autoregression model with suicide mortality data from the National Statistics Office for 1. 5 years before and 1. 5 years after each celebrity's <b>suicide.</b> <b>The</b> period with a significantly increased number of <b>suicides</b> immediately after <b>the</b> celebrity's <b>suicide</b> determined <b>the</b> Werther effect band. The relative risk during this period was examined for different ages, genders, and suicide methods. RESULTS: News reports were more numerous and they contained more positive definitions about <b>the</b> entertainer's <b>suicide.</b> <b>The</b> risk of <b>suicide</b> deaths rose markedly after both celebrity <b>suicides.</b> However, <b>the</b> Werther effect band was longer for the entertainer (6 weeks) than for the politician (4 weeks). <b>The</b> relative <b>suicide</b> risk was significant for almost all ages and both genders during that of both individuals. Use of <b>the</b> same <b>suicide</b> method was a prominent risk factor after both celebrity suicides. CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm the existence of imitative suicide behaviours, suggesting a facilitation effect of media reports. Guidelines for responsible media reporting need to be implemented to enhance public mental health in Korea...|$|R
