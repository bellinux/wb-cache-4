5|$|Chauvel {{arrived on}} 12 May 1915 {{and took over}} the {{critical}} sector, which included Pope's Hill and Quinn's, Courtney's and Steele's Posts, from Colonel John Monash. Open to Turkish observation on two sides, these four advanced posts {{at the top of}} Monash Valley were the linchpin of the defence. Chauvel reorganised the defence, appointing permanent commanders for the posts. He also formed special sniper groups who eventually managed to suppress the Turkish snipers, making it safe even for mule trains to move up Monash Valley. Chauvel's brigade soon found itself under heavy pressure from the Turks. On 29 May 1915, the Turks fired a mine under Quinn's Post and broke into it. The permanent commander of the post, Lieutenant Colonel J. H. Cannan was absent on leave and the acting commander, Lieutenant Colonel G. J. Burnage was wounded in the fighting. Chauvel responded by bringing up reserves and appointing a temporary post commander, Lieutenant Colonel H. Pope, with orders to drive the Turks out at all costs. Major S. C. E. Herring was miraculously able to charge across the open practically unscathed, his attack having coincided with a Turkish one on another part of the post so that the Turkish machine gunners could not shoot without hitting their own men. There were in fact only about seventeen Turks in the post, who eventually surrendered. Chauvel's decision may have been <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>one,</b> but it was decisive; he was also lucky. For this action, he was mentioned in despatches.|$|E
5|$|Shortly before {{approaching}} {{the town of}} the first Gym Leader, the protagonist first encounters Team Magma/Aqua in the Petalburg Woods, {{where he or she}} rescues a worker from Devon (a company that manufactures Pokéballs) and recovers Devon merchandise. Upon arriving in Fallarbor Town (after defeating the third Gym Leader), the protagonist discovers that Professor Cozmo, an astronomer, has been kidnapped by Magma/Aqua. The protagonist traces them to a cave, Meteor Falls, but is too late to stop them from escaping to Mt. Chimney with a meteorite. The protagonist follows Magma/Aqua to Mt. Chimney where they are preparing to use the meteorite to alter the climate of the region. The protagonist defeats the Team's leader, however, and returns the meteorite to Professor Cozmo. Shortly after the protagonist defeats the fifth Gym Leader (the protagonist's father, the first time such a character appears), Magma/Aqua again attempts to change the region's climate by stealing a Castform, a Pokémon with the ability to change the weather, from the Weather Institute. After the protagonist defeats the sixth Gym Leader, Magma/Aqua steals an orb with the ability to control a legendary Pokémon (Groudon in Ruby, Kyogre in Sapphire). Magma/Aqua then steals a submarine from Captain Stern in Slateport City; the protagonist, however, infiltrates the team's hideout, but fails to prevent the submarine from being used. Magma/Aqua, then travel with the orb to the Seafloor Cavern, where Groudon or Kyogre resides; the team then uses the orb to awaken the legendary Pokémon, but they have chosen <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>one</b> and have instead enraged the Pokémon instead of putting it under their thrall. Once awakened, the Pokémon travels to the Cave of Origin and causes a region-wide drought (Ruby) or severe rainstorms (Sapphire). When the protagonist defeats (or captures) the Pokémon, the region's weather returns to normal.|$|E

Because of the widespread migration of numerous ethnic groups like the Celts and Teutonic peoples and events like Roman expansion and subsequent Romanization, {{it is highly unlikely that}} only one ethnic group was responsible for the development of the Gundestrup cauldron.

In the end, Nielsen concludes that, based on accelerator datings from beeswax found on the back of the plates, the vessel was created within the Roman Iron Age at a location somewhere in Central Europe.|$|E
500|$|A New Day Has Come {{garnered}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} the music critics, who noticed that Dion explores a [...] "broader, more adventurous" [...] range of pop music and [...] "dips its toe" [...] into modern music, particularly dance ("Sorry for Love").

Her [...] A New Day Has Come television special was taped on 3 March 2002 at the Kodak Theatre in Los Angeles and aired on CBS on 7 April 2002. During the show Dion performed [...] "A New Day Has Come", [...] "I'm Alive", [...] "At Last", [...] "Have You Ever Been in Love", [...] "Nature Boy" [...] {{and a movie}} medley with the songs [...] "Because You Loved Me", [...] "Beauty and the Beast" [...] in duet with Brian McKnight and [...] "My Heart Will Go On".

On 17 March 2002 Dion taped La spéciale Céline Dion in Paris, France to promote the album in Francophone countries. This television special was broadcast on 30 March 2002 on TF1.

500|$|The album {{garnered}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Chuck Taylor from Billboard {{gave it a}} favorable review, saying that Dion explores a [...] "broader, more adventurous" [...] range of pop music. Among the highlights, he mentioned [...] "Sorry for Love" [...] where Dion [...] "dishes out her first all-out dance anthem" [...] and holds a twelve-second [...] "authentic note that puts the [...] "d" [...] in diva", [...] "I'm Alive" [...] and [...] "When <b>the</b> <b>Wrong</b> <b>One</b> Loves You Right", which he described as [...] "hitworthy uptempo gems", the rock-leaning [...] "Ten Days", and a Spanish track, [...] "Aun Existe Amor". According to Taylor, Dion does not disappoint with ballads like the [...] "rafter-shaking" [...] "I Surrender" [...] where she sings of [...] "forbidden love amid a firestorm of utterly volcanic instrumentation" [...] and [...] "The Greatest Reward", and two standards – the [...] "diamond-dipped" [...] "Nature Boy" [...] and gospel [...] "At Last". He called the album the most [...] "versatile and gratifying" [...] Dion's recording yet. Larry Flick, also from Billboard wrote about another song, [...] "Have You Ever Been in Love" [...] that [...] "at a time when music is frightfully aggressive and {{the world at large}} is fraught with turmoil, a classic Dion power ballad is a warm source of comfort." [...] The track [...] "builds from a gentle, piano-laced opening into a deliciously theatrical, string-framed climax." [...] All along, Dion offers an [...] "appealing palette of vocal colors that range from delicate and breathy to full-bodied and appropriately dramatic." ...|$|E
500|$|Chuck Taylor also {{reviewed}} {{all three}} singles from the album. He {{wrote that the}} life-affirming [...] "A New Day Has Come" [...] "comes off like a gentle exhale against the world's ills." [...] The Ric Wake Radio Remix of [...] "A New Day Has Come" [...] opens with an [...] "Enya-inspired whisper before a shuffle skips in and lifts the song upward like a dove gracefully taking flight." [...] The Album Edit [...] "comes sans the beat, allowing Dion's performance alone to fully color the message." [...] According to him, on both versions Dion [...] "embraces a particularly restrained performance – dramatic enough to steer the track's emotion, but still delicate to offer comfort." [...] "I'm Alive" [...] demonstrates a stylistic [...] "left turn, with its throbbing tribal rhythms and a loose, sky-grazing vocal from Dion." [...] The [...] "percolating" [...] Humberto Gatica Mix [...] "adds juice" [...] to the Album Version, while the uptempo Wake Up Mix, with assistance from Ric Wake and Richie Jones, is Dion's most [...] "inspired and festive" [...] remix to date, with Blondie's [...] "Heart of Glass" [...] woven into the beat to [...] "splendid effect". Taylor criticized {{the choice of the}} third single, [...] "Goodbye's (The Saddest Word)", a ballad relegated solely to adult contemporary radio stations. He noticed that the song is [...] "devastatingly beautiful", offering a loving tribute to one's mother at death's door and that Dion [...] "delivers it with a heaving helping of passion, emotionally drawing one's attention to the devotional message." [...] Although he felt that many will connect to the loss of a parent, on a commercial level, this was a disappointing decision. According to Taylor, songs like [...] "Sorry for Love" [...] and [...] "When <b>the</b> <b>Wrong</b> <b>One</b> Loves You Right" [...] were primed for radio airplay and dancefloor remixes and were ideal candidates for release.|$|E
