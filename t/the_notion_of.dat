5|$|Descartes {{argued that}} God's {{existence}} can be deduced from his nature, just as geometric ideas can be deduced {{from the nature}} of shapes—he used the deduction of the sizes of angles in a triangle as an example. He suggested {{that the concept of}} God is that of a supremely perfect being, holding all perfections. He seems to have assumed that existence is a predicate of a perfection. Thus, if <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> God did not include existence, it would not be supremely perfect, as it would be lacking a perfection. Consequently, <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> a supremely perfect God who does not exist, Descartes argues, is unintelligible. Therefore, according to his nature, God must exist.|$|E
5|$|In very {{elementary}} terms, anti-de Sitter {{space is}} {{a mathematical model}} of spacetime in which <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> distance between points (the metric) is different from <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> distance in ordinary Euclidean geometry. It {{is closely related to}} hyperbolic space, which {{can be viewed as a}} disk as illustrated on the right. This image shows a tessellation of a disk by triangles and squares. One can define the distance between points of this disk in such a way that all the triangles and squares are the same size and the circular outer boundary is infinitely far from any point in the interior.|$|E

5|$|Fodor {{revived the}} idea of modularity, without <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> precise {{physical}} localizability, in the 1980s, {{and became one of}} the most vocal proponents of it with the 1983 publication of his monograph Modularity of Mind. Two properties of modularity in particular, informational encapsulation and domain specificity, make it possible to tie together questions of functional architecture with those of mental content. The ability to elaborate information independently from the background beliefs of individuals that these two properties allow Fodor to give an atomistic and causal account of <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> mental content. The main idea, in other words, is that the properties of the contents of mental states can depend, rather than exclusively on the internal relations of the system of which they are a part, also on their causal relations with the external world.|$|E
5|$|In mathematics, {{a matrix}} is a {{rectangular}} array of numbers or other data. In physics, a matrix {{model is a}} particular kind of physical theory whose mathematical formulation involves <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> a matrix in an important way. A matrix model describes the behavior of a set of matrices within the framework of quantum mechanics.|$|E
5|$|In the AdS/CFT correspondence, the {{geometry}} of spacetime is {{described in terms of}} a certain vacuum solution of Einstein's equation called anti-de Sitter space. In very elementary terms, anti-de Sitter space is a mathematical model of spacetime in which <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> distance between points (the metric) is different from <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> distance in ordinary Euclidean geometry. It is closely related to hyperbolic space, which {{can be viewed as a}} disk as illustrated on the left. This image shows a tessellation of a disk by triangles and squares.

5|$|It {{has been}} said that Jehovah's Witnesses do not entirely oppose the idea of {{national}} service, but rather <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> armed military service.

5|$|Kohlberg's theory {{centers on}} the notion that justice is the {{essential}} characteristic of moral reasoning. Justice itself relies heavily upon <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> sound reasoning based on principles. Despite being a justice-centered theory of morality, Kohlberg considered it to be compatible with plausible formulations of deontology and eudaimonia.|$|E
5|$|The present {{purpose is}} to {{illustrate}} the role of representation theory of groups in mathematics and in physics.

40|$|A {{central issue}} in {{contemporary}} psychology consists in understanding how we develop new cognitive structures {{and how we}} modify them. This article aims to address the links between <b>the</b> <b>notions</b> from conceptual change and some aspects from the theories of Piaget and Vygotsky. For that purpose, <b>the</b> <b>notions</b> <b>of</b> implicit theory and scientific concept were analyzed from the theory of conceptual change, and <b>the</b> <b>notions</b> <b>of</b> error and pseudo-concept from the theories of Piaget and Vygotsky. First, we examined the work of representative authors of conceptual change to understand the place granted to <b>the</b> <b>notions</b> <b>of</b> implicit theory and scientific concept. Then, some aspects from the theories of Piaget and Vygotsky were considered {{to reflect on the}} place that <b>the</b> <b>notions</b> <b>of</b> error and pseudo-concept have in those theories.
