In spring they feed their silkworms, and wind their silk. In summer they reap their crops, and hang the maize-heads from their rafters for their own winter food, while they sell the wheat to the poor creatures, objects of their pity, who live in towns, and are forced to eat white bread. From spring to autumn they have fruit, and to spare, for themselves and for their customers; and with the autumn comes the vintage, and all its classic revelries. A happy folk--under a happy clime; which yet has its drawbacks, like all climes on earth. Terrible thunderstorms sweep over it, hail-laden, killing, battering, drowning, destroying in an hour the labours of the year; and there are ugly mistral winds likewise, of which it may be fairly said, that he who can face an eight days' mistral, without finding his life a burden, must be either a very valiant man, or have neither liver nor mucous membrane.|$|E

Both columns are decorated with chimerae, which were not originally part of the Macellum, but belonged to one of the major tombs: the Tomba delle Ghirlande (Garland grave) on Via del Sepolchri (Street of Sepulchres) before the Herculaneum gate. The chimerae were presumably not produced in Pompeii, but probably originate in a workshop in Greece. However, it is also possible that they were manufactured in a neo-Attic workshop in Naples or Puteoli.|$|E

5000|$|The {{presumption}} {{has been}} subjected to criticism on the basis that it reflects outdated Victorian era social values, i.e. a transfer from a father or a husband is <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>presumed</b> <b>to</b> be a gift, but not a transfer from a wife or a mother (although in Australia it has been recognised in Brown v Brown that a wife can transfer property to her husband). [...] Others have questioned whether the presumption has any significant effect in practice.

[...] There is no presumption of advancement between cohabiting couples (whether heterosexual or homosexual), nor between a man and his mistress.|$|E

5000|$|As such, the {{contract}} was held void, rather than voidable. This has introduced a distinction from cases such as Phillips v Brooks, where parties dealing face <b>to</b> face <b>are</b> <b>presumed</b> <b>to</b> contract with each other.

At {{the time of the}} deceased’s death, his daughter had two children and was pregnant with a third. The question before the court was whether the nasciturus could inherit. The court was unwilling to act to the prejudice of the nasciturus, and held, therefore, that it could inherit. A child in ventre matris had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>presumed</b> <b>to</b> be alive for the purpose of inheritance, and was entitled to inherit equally with his mother, the testator's daughter, and her other children already born at the death of the testator.|$|E
5000|$|On June 9, 1891, Campbell filed a {{claim for}} reparations for losses he had {{suffered}} during an Indian raid in November 1868. When the case came before the United States Court of Claims, he was asked for proof he was United States citizen. Campbell assumed {{he had become a}} citizen automatically when his father was naturalized following their migration from Scotland. He was unable however to find any record of his father's naturalization. With Campbell unable to establish his citizenship, the court denied his claim. The matter would not be finally settled until after Campbell's death. In 1912, Representative Carl Hayden introduced legislation to provide relief to Campbell's heirs. Hayden's argument was [...] "One who has served in the House of Representatives ought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>presumed</b> <b>to</b> be a citizen of the United States." [...] The legislation was not passed until 1915 with the Court of Claims taking until February 19, 1917 to approve payment of US$470 in reparations.|$|E

50|$|Apart from this, {{the accused}} <b>was</b> {{compelled}} <b>to</b> adduce evidence {{in order to}} avoid a conviction. The effect of the presumption therefore <b>was</b> <b>to</b> force the accused to break his silence.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the effect of post-growth rapid thermal annealing on self-assembled InAs/GaAs bilayer quantum dot samples having very thin barrier thickness (7. 5 - 8. 5 nm). In/Ga interdiffusion in the samples due <b>to</b> annealing <b>is</b> <b>presumed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> controlled by the vertical strain coupling from the seed dots in bilayer heterostructure. Strain coupling from embedded seed QD layer maintains a strain relaxed state in active top islands of the bilayer quantum dot sample grown with comparatively thick spacer layer (8. 5 nm). This results in minimum In/Ga interdiffusion. However controlled interdiffusion across the interface between dots and GaAs barrier, noticeably enhances the emission efficiency in such bilayer quantum dot heterostructure on annealing up to 700 degrees C...|$|R

At the downstream of PKS genes, the genes involved in the biosynthesis of methoxymalonyl-CoA from glycerol as a polyketide precursor (Chan and Thomas 2010) were also found from BafAI to BafAV.
