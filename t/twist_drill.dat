25|$|A <b>twist</b> <b>drill</b> is a {{bit with}} two cut grooves in {{opposite}} sides of a round bar, whereby the twisted bar produces a helical flute in order to drill holes in metal, plastic, or wood. The <b>twist</b> <b>drill</b> was invented by Stephen A. Morse in October 1861 and later patented on April 7, 1863.|$|E
25|$|Manufacturers {{can produce}} special {{versions}} of the <b>twist</b> <b>drill</b> bit, varying the geometry and the materials used, to suit particular machinery and particular materials to be cut. <b>Twist</b> <b>drill</b> bits {{are available in the}} widest choice of tooling materials. However, even for industrial users, most holes are drilled with standard high speed steel bits.|$|E
25|$|Conventional <b>twist</b> <b>drill</b> bits tend {{to wander}} when {{presented}} to a flat workpiece. For metalwork, this is countered by drilling a pilot hole with a spotting drill bit. In wood, the lip and spur drill bit is another solution: The {{centre of the}} drill bit is given not the straight chisel of the <b>twist</b> <b>drill</b> bit, but a spur with a sharp point and four sharp corners to cut the wood. The sharp point of the spur simply pushes into the soft wood to keep the drill bit in line.|$|E
40|$|Accurate {{geometric}} {{models of}} <b>twist</b> <b>drills</b> {{are needed to}} determine the required grinding wheel profile for generating a given drill flute profile design, as well as, for finite element simulations of the drilling process. This paper presents a method to create accurate models of two-flute conical <b>twist</b> <b>drills</b> using analytical equations to generate drill flute profile needed for production of <b>twist</b> <b>drills</b> with straight lips and solidmodeling techniques to generate geometric models of <b>twist</b> <b>drills.</b> Boolean operations are used to mimic the drill manufacturing steps and generate the fully designed drill...|$|R
40|$|Drilling is {{involved}} in many applications of carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) composite. <b>Twist</b> <b>drilling</b> is widely used in industry. Rotary ultrasonic machining (RUM) has been successfully tested to drill holes in CFRP. However, there are no reports on comparisons between RUM and <b>twist</b> <b>drilling</b> of CFRP. This paper compares RUM and <b>twist</b> <b>drilling</b> of CFRP in six aspects (cutting force, torque, surface roughness, delamination, tool life, and material remove rate). Experimental results show that RUM is superior in almost all these aspects...|$|R

25|$|The <b>twist</b> <b>drill</b> bit is {{the type}} {{produced}} in largest quantity today. It comprises a cutting point {{at the tip of}} a cylindrical shaft with helical flutes; the flutes act as an Archimedean screw and lift swarf out of the hole.|$|E

25|$|Lip and {{spur drill}} bits are also {{effective}} in soft plastic. Conventional <b>twist</b> <b>drill</b> bits in a hand drill, where the hole axis is not maintained throughout the operation, {{have a tendency}} to smear the edges of the hole through side friction as the drill bit vibrates.|$|E
25|$|Long series {{drill bits}} are unusually long <b>twist</b> <b>drill</b> bits. However, {{they are not}} the best tool for {{routinely}} drilling deep holes, as they require frequent withdrawal to clear the flutes of swarf and to prevent breakage of the bit. Instead, gun drill bits are preferred for deep hole drilling.|$|E
25|$|Traditional <b>twist</b> <b>drill</b> bits may tend {{to wander}} when started on an {{unprepared}} surface. Once a bit wanders off course {{it is difficult to}} bring it back on center. A center drill bit frequently provides a reasonable starting point as it is short and therefore has a reduced tendency to wander when drilling is started.|$|E

25|$|Using an {{ordinary}} two-flute <b>twist</b> <b>drill</b> bit {{to enlarge the}} hole resulting from a casting core will not produce a clean result, the result will possibly be out of round, off center and generally of poor finish. The two fluted drill bit also {{has a tendency to}} grab on any protuberance (such as flash) which may occur in the product.|$|E
25|$|The {{geometry}} and sharpening of the cutting edges {{is crucial to}} the performance of the bit. Small bits that become blunt are often discarded because sharpening them correctly is difficult and they are cheap to replace. For larger bits, special grinding jigs are available. A special tool grinder is available for sharpening or reshaping cutting surfaces on <b>twist</b> <b>drill</b> bits in order to optimize the bit for a particular material.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of numerical modeling of skew rolling process of <b>twist</b> <b>drills</b> in four-segments configuration. On the basis of the conducted numerical simulation the results were obtained in a form of distributions: stress intensity, strain intensity, temperature and damage. The energetic parameters of the process were also given on the example of a drill Ã˜ 10 mm from high-speed steel HS 6 - 5 - 2. The conducted numerical simulation confirmed the usefulness of the graphic method based on envelope theory in tools designing for skew rolling of <b>twist</b> <b>drills...</b>|$|R
40|$|Recent {{advances}} in cutting tool materials and PVD surface coatings are making high-speed dry machining an increasingly viable machining operation in commercial manufacturing sectors. High oxidation resistant coatings, such as TiAlN, are used extensively in global manufacturing for reducing production costs and improving productivity in such aggressive metal-cutting operations. In this investigation, {{the performance of}} TiN, Ti 1 -xAlxN and Ti 1 -x-yAlxCryN coatings was assessed on Co-HSS <b>twist</b> <b>drills</b> used to machine an automotive grade grey cast iron. As part of the study, two experimental methods were used to characterise {{the performance of the}} <b>twist</b> <b>drills,</b> namely, by an audible 'screech' and measurement of the progression of outer corner flank wear lands. Both techniques showed that a single layer TiN coating failed to outperform even uncoated <b>twist</b> <b>drills</b> when dry machining grey cast iron under aggressive machining conditions. However, using the measurement of outer corner flank wear technique, the average tool life of uncoated <b>twist</b> <b>drills</b> was increased by factors of 4. 5, 6. 5 and 6. 9 by Ti 0. 59 Al 0. 41 N, Ti 0. 27 Al 0. 19 Cr 0. 54 N and Ti 0. 21 Al 0. 14 Cr 0. 65 N coatings, respectively. In the case of 'screech' failure, the average tool life of uncoated <b>twist</b> <b>drills</b> was increased by factors of 3. 9, 7. 3 and 10. 8 by Ti 0. 59 Al 0. 41 N, Ti 0. 27 Al 0. 19 Cr 0. 54 N and Ti 0. 21 Al 0. 14 Cr 0. 65 N coatings, respectively. The performance of <b>twist</b> <b>drills</b> was also assessed using a number of quantitative techniques, namely, measurement of thrust and torque, hole diameter and drill wear. The latter was also observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) which showed an early onset of workpiece material transfer at the margins of the uncoated drills. In the case of the PVD coated drills, an improvement in the tribological interaction between the coatings and the grey cast iron workpiece resulted in a significant reduction in material transfer at the drill margins. The above results are discussed in terms of their affect on hole diameter and cutting forces...|$|R

25|$|An {{additional}} use of unibits is deburring holes left {{by other}} bits, as the sharp increase {{to the next}} step size allows the cutting edge to scrape burrs off the entry surface of the workpiece. However, the straight flute is poor at chip ejection, and can cause a burr to be formed on the exit side of the hole, more so than a spiral <b>twist</b> <b>drill</b> bit turning at high speed.|$|E
25|$|The <b>twist</b> <b>drill</b> bit {{was invented}} by Steven A. Morse of East Bridgewater, Massachusetts in 1861. The {{original}} method of manufacture was to cut two grooves in opposite sides of a round bar, then to twist the bar (giving the tool its name) to produce the helical flutes. Nowadays, the drill bit is usually made by rotating the bar while moving it past a grinding wheel to cut the flutes {{in the same manner}} as cutting helical gears.|$|E
25|$|Installer bits are {{a type of}} <b>twist</b> <b>drill</b> bit for {{use with}} a hand-portable power tool. Installer bits are also known as bell-hanger bits or fishing bits. The key {{distinguishing}} feature of an installer bit is a transverse hole drilled through the web of the bit near the tip. Once the bit has penetrated a wall, a wire can be threaded through this transverse hole, and the bit pulled back through the drilled hole. The installer bit was invented and patented by Sinclair Smith of Brooklyn, New York in 1898.|$|E

40|$|Accurate {{models of}} <b>twist</b> <b>drills</b> {{are needed for}} Finite Element {{simulations}} of the drilling process. Existing drill designing methods rely extensively on discretized analytical equations to describe the drill and different sets of equations need to be formulated as the drill design changes. This paper presents a method to create accurate models of two-flute conical <b>twist</b> <b>drills</b> using solid-modeling techniques which addresses some of these shortcomings. Boolean operations are used to mimic the drill manufacturing steps and generate the fully designed drill.

25|$|While {{the above}} {{is a common}} use of center drill bits, it is a {{technically}} incorrect practice {{and should not be}} considered for production use. The correct tool to start a traditionally drilled hole (a hole drilled by a high-speed steel (HSS) <b>twist</b> <b>drill</b> bit) is a spotting drill bit (or a spot drill bit, as they are referenced in the U.S.). The included angle of the spotting drill bit should be the same as, or greater than, the conventional drill bit so that the drill bit will then start without undue stress on the bit's corners, which would cause premature failure of the bit and a loss of hole quality.|$|E
25|$|Metals are {{typically}} isotropic, and an ordinary <b>twist</b> <b>drill</b> bit shears {{the edges of}} the hole cleanly. Wood drilled across the grain has long strands of wood fiber. These long strands tend {{to pull out of the}} wood hole, rather than being cleanly cut at the hole edge. The lip and spur drill bit has the outside corner of the cutting edges leading, so that it cuts the periphery of the hole before the inner parts of the cutting edges plane off the base of the hole. By cutting the periphery first, the lip maximizes the chance that the fibers can be cut cleanly, rather than having them pull messily out of the timber.|$|E

50|$|Center drills are {{available}} with two different included angles; 60 degrees is the standard for drilling centre holes (for example for subsequent centre support in the lathe), but 90 degrees is also common and used when locating holes prior to <b>drilling</b> with <b>twist</b> <b>drills.</b> Center drills are made specifically for drilling lathe centers, but are often incorrectly used as spotting drills.|$|R
40|$|In modern {{engineering}} {{one most}} commonly used instrument for <b>twist</b> <b>drills</b> holes remain. <b>Twist</b> <b>drills</b> are used {{more than one hundred}} years, during which time much of their manufacturing technology has not changed. With the development of machine tools with numerical control has recently been started to use a special back-grinding in the manufacture of continuous spiral drill bit as high-speed steel and carbide. Feature of these machines is that all operations are carried out for the production of drill bits in a single setup: processing, helical grooves, helical ribbons, sharpening drills. As a tool used grinding wheels, and on one mandrel that fits over the spindle of the machine can be on one axis three wheels, which allows you to combine all the operations for the production of such a tool. Shaping chip flutes of <b>twist</b> <b>drills</b> on these machines is not shaped grinding wheel, and around a flat shape. This work describes the features of forming helical groove particleboard <b>twist</b> <b>drills</b> disk tool rectilinear forms. The effect of adjusting the parameters of circles on the shape and size of the drill flute grinding wheels obtained with a rectilinear profile. A comparative analysis of the obtained helical surface with a theory - the exact surface of a standard drill. The calculations have shown that through judicious choice of settings in terms of shaping flute drill bit can be obtained by minimizing the deviation profile of the drill flute profile of the grooves is theoretically accurate standard drill. ? ?????? ??????????? ??????????? ???????????????? ?????????? ???????? ??????? ?????????? ????? ???????? ???????????? ????????????? ?????. ???????? ?????? ??????? ???????????? ?????????? ?????? ?? ????? ? ??????? ?????????? ??????? ?????? ??????????? ????????????? ??????? ? ????????????? ????????. ???????? ????????????? ?????? ?????????? ???????? ??????????? ? ???????????? - ?????? ???????????? ???????????? ??????. ?? ??????????? ???????? ????????, ??? ?? ???? ????????????? ?????? ???????????? ?????????? ????? ??? ???????????????? ?????????? ??????? ?????? ????? ?????????????? ?????????? ??????????? ??????? ?????????? ??????? ?????? ?? ??????? ???????????? ?????? ??????? ???????????? ??????...|$|R
