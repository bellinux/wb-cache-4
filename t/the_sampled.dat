According to Amadon, the Rodrigues and hoopoe starlings were related to Asiatic starlings, such as some species of Sturnus, rather than the glossy starlings (Lamprotornis) of Africa and the Madagascan starling (Saroglossa aurata); he concluded this based on the colouration of the birds. A 2008 study, which analysed the DNA of various starlings, confirmed that the hoopoe starling was a starling, but with no close relatives among <b>the</b> <b>sampled</b> species.|$|E
5|$|Fourier {{series are}} used to solve {{boundary}} value problems in partial differential equations. In 1822, Fourier first used this technique to solve the heat equation. A discrete version of the Fourier series {{can be used in}} sampling applications where the function value is known only at a finite number of equally spaced points. In this case the Fourier series is finite and its value is equal to <b>the</b> <b>sampled</b> values at all points. The set of coefficients is known as the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of the given sample sequence. The DFT {{is one of the key}} tools of digital signal processing, a field whose applications include radar, speech encoding, image compression. The JPEG image format is an application of the closely related discrete cosine transform.|$|E

25|$|How <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> and matrix is {{deposited}} {{on the surface}} of <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> probe needs to be a consideration in sample preparation as well.

The sandwich method involves depositing a layer of matrix onto the surface of the probe and allowing it to dry. A drop of <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> followed by a drop of additional matrix is then applied to the layer of dried matrix and allowed to dry as well. Variations on the sandwich technique involve depositing the matrix on the surface and then depositing <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> directly on top of the matrix. A particularly useful method involves depositing the matrix solution {{on the surface of}} <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> probe in a solvent that will evaporate very rapidly, thus forming a very thin fine layer of matrix. <b>The</b> <b>sample</b> solution is then placed on top of the matrix layer and allowed to evaporate slowly, thus integrating <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> into <b>the</b> top layer of matrix as <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> solution evaporates. An addition concern when depositing <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> on <b>the</b> surface of the probe is the solubility of <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> in <b>the</b> matrix.

The fourth grid is only necessary when the LEED is used like a tetrode and the current at the screen is measured, when it serves as screen between the gate and the anode.|$|E

25|$|Although {{statistically}} {{not significant}} enough sample size to be a nationwide projection, {{a study on}} 246 unrelated male individuals from eight provinces of three Argentinean regions using ancestry-sensitive DNA showed a large fraction of European genetic heritage in their Y-chromosomal (94.1%) and autosomal (78.5%) DNA, but their mitochondrial gene pool is mostly of Native American ancestry (53.7%); African heritage was small in all three genetic systems (<4%). Another clustering analyses performed on data from autosomal ancestry-sensitive SNPs – providing somewhat approximate representation of the bi-parentally inherited part of the genome – demonstrated a major European component (overall 78.5%) in the pooled Argentinean sample, whereas the Native American component (overall 17.3%) was lower but considerable, and the African component was very small (overall 4.1%). Despite this general trend in the genetic variation, {{it should be noted}} that analyses revealed a considerable genetic heterogeneity at the individual level, also noticed before in a smaller number of Argentinean samples. About 40% of <b>the</b> <b>sampled</b> individuals attained more than 90% of European ancestry, but the Native American proportion was as high as 80% (although this was observed only in a single individual). Such findings reflect the dynamics of the recent demographic history of the extant Argentinean population, indicating that individuals retaining a higher proportion of European ancestry could be descendants from the recent newcomers to the Argentinean population, whereas those with a higher amount of Native American admixture could be descendants from the first contact between the European and Amerindian populations, starting approximately 500 years ago.|$|E
