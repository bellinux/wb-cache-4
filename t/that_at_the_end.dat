5|$|One of {{the biggest}} criticisms Steiner {{received}} was that he himself believed what his fictive Hitler said about the Jews. It was also thought <b>that</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the London theatre production, the audience were applauding Hitler and not the play.|$|E
5|$|When the Cicero {{documents}} predicted Allied bombing {{missions in}} the Balkans, {{which took place}} on the predicted date, the authenticity of the information was supported and his reputation enhanced.

5|$|Chopin's {{influence}} is marked {{in the first}} two pieces. Orledge observes that the right-hand figuration at the end of No 1 is remarkably similar to <b>that</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of Chopin's Waltz in E minor. In No 2 Nectoux detects the additional influence of Liszt (Au bord d'une source) in the opening bars. In the closing bars of No 2, Orledge finds a resemblance to the end of Chopin's Grande Valse Brillante, Op, 18.|$|E
50|$|CS Botoșani {{remained}} in Divizia B for 11 seasons, the most seasons spent by {{a football team}} from Botoșani. After <b>that,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ending</b> of 1989-90 season the team was relegated to Divizia C. In 1993, the team was relegated to the county division and disbanded.|$|R

5|$|Although Newcastle had {{two games}} in hand over Manchester United going into April, their {{advantage}} was slim in comparison <b>that</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of January when Newcastle had a 12-point lead over Manchester United. When both teams met in March at St James' Park, Cantona scored the winning goal for Manchester United and goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel produced a number of outstanding saves which prevented midfielder Peter Beardsley and striker Les Ferdinand from scoring. The win was Manchester United's ninth successive victory in the league, who also beat Newcastle 2–0 in the corresponding fixture at Old Trafford in December 1995.|$|E
5|$|In October 2005, Foyt {{announced}} <b>that</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the 2005 season, {{he would}} leave Foyt Enterprises and drive in the NASCAR Busch Series for the #38 Akins Motorsports team and was signed as a developmental driver for Evernham Motorsports. He ran several events in the #38 late in 2005, but failed to produce results. In 2006, {{he was scheduled to}} run the entire Busch Series schedule in the #38 and be a competitor for the Rookie of the Year award. However, early in the 2006 season, Akins was purchased by Braun Racing, which switched the #38 from Dodge to Chevrolet bodies. Foyt had an exclusive contract with Dodge that prevented him from continuing with the team. After a week off, Ray Evernham found him a ride with FitzBradshaw Racing, but he failed to qualify for his first race with the team and has not attempted a NASCAR race since.|$|E
5|$|The {{calls of}} {{throwing}} so infuriated Marsh <b>that</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the day's play, {{he announced that}} he would wear splints when he was bowling the next day. Marsh took this action to ensure that his elbow was kept straight and to demonstrate that he could bowl fast without throwing. Marsh had previously performed such an exhibition to ground members and the requisite splints and bandages were acquired from the nearby St. Vincent's Hospital, in order to bind his bowling arm. The hospital provided a medical certificate stating that Marsh could not move his elbow while encased in the splints. Marsh was proactive in attempting to defend the legitimacy of his bowling action. Marsh's intentions were published in the Sydney Morning Herald and Curran was made aware that Marsh would seek to challenge him.|$|E

5|$|The {{lives of}} Elves only endure {{as the world}} endures. It is said in the Second Prophecy of Mandos <b>that</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of time the Elves will join the other Children of Ilúvatar in singing the Second Music of the Ainur. However it is disputable whether the Prophecy is canon, and the {{published}} Silmarillion states that only Men shall participate for certain in the Second Music, and that the ultimate fate of the Elves is unknown. However, {{they do not believe}} that Eru will abandon them to oblivion.|$|E
5|$|When he recovers, {{he learns}} <b>that,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the bugger war, Earth's powers fought among themselves. He stays on Eros as his friends return home and colonists venture to other worlds, using Eros {{as a way}} station. Among the first colonists is Valentine, who apologizes that Ender can never return to Earth, where he would become {{dangerous}} as Peter and other politicians sought to exploit him for their own purposes. Instead, Ender joins the colony program to populate one of the buggers' former worlds. There, he discovers the dormant egg of a bugger queen, who reveals that the buggers had initially assumed humans were a non-sentient race, for want of collective consciousness, but realized their mistake too late, and requests that Ender take the egg to a new planet to colonize.|$|E
5|$|C'est trop bête d'en parler (It's {{too stupid}} to talk about). There was a break. Coppi {{attacked}}. His brother Fausto gave him a push to get him away. He wanted his brother to win. I waited a bit and then I attacked and I caught him and the break. Then I went off by myself. I {{was going to win}} Paris–Roubaix. At the entrance to the vélodrome, there were crowds everywhere, blocking the way. I looked around for where to go and I was directed round the outside wall of the track, to where the team cars had to park. It wasn't like nowadays, when there's television and everything. Then it was more chaotic and the whole road was blocked. People said I should have known the way into the track. But how do you know a thing like <b>that</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of Paris–Roubaix, when you've raced all day over roads like that? A gendarme signalled the way to go and that's the way I went.|$|E

50|$|Due {{to their}} slow {{hydrogen}} fusion {{compared to other}} types of low mass stars their life spans are estimated at hundred billion years with the smallest living for trillions of years. As {{the age of the}} universe is only 13.8 billion years, all cool dwarf stars are relatively young.

5|$|Double Fine {{believed}} they were given the go-ahead to develop a sequel to Brütal Legend after the game's release, and had invested {{a great deal of}} development time towards this, but were later told by EA that it was cancelled. Schafer stated that the sequel would likely incorporate much of what they had to drop prior to the game's release. This game world would have been three times larger than what Brütal Legend contained. The sequel would have likely included a fourth faction that was cut from the original game which would have been the last major group the player would have to fight through, including a major boss character, before the final battles with Doviculus. Schafer further noted <b>that</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the original game, Doviculus' head falls into the Sea of Black Tears, and implied that the same effect that the Sea had on Ophelia could happen to Doviculus. Schafer also had ideas for a plot using a character voiced by Ronnie James Dio, but will not likely be used due to Dio's death.|$|E
5|$|Other {{authors have}} {{suggested}} that competition was limited by geographical separation. Unlike some other groups of dinosaurs, {{there appears to be}} no correlation with distance from the sea. Neither Daspletosaurus nor Gorgosaurus was more common at higher or lower elevations than the other. However, while there is some overlap, Gorgosaurus appears to be more common at northern latitudes, with species of Daspletosaurus more abundant to the south. The same pattern is seen in other groups of dinosaurs. Chasmosaurine ceratopsians and hadrosaurine hadrosaurs are also more common in the Two Medicine Formation and in southwestern North America during the Campanian. Thomas Holtz has suggested that this pattern indicates shared ecological preferences between tyrannosaurines, chasmosaurines and hadrosaurines. Holtz notes <b>that,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the later Maastrichtian stage, tyrannosaurines like Tyrannosaurus rex, hadrosaurines and chasmosaurines like Triceratops were widespread throughout western North America, while albertosaurines and centrosaurines became extinct, and lambeosaurines were very rare.|$|E
5|$|The Clintons accrued {{several million}} dollars in legal fees during his presidency; the bills were paid off four years after he left office. Bill and Hillary Clinton have both {{received}} {{millions of dollars in}} book authorship fees. In 2016, Forbes reported Bill and Hillary Clinton made about $240 million in the 15 years from January 2001 to December 2015 (mostly from paid speeches, business consulting and book-writing). Also in 2016, CNN reported the Clintons combined to receive more than $153 million in paid speeches from 2001 until spring 2015. In May 2015, The Hill reported that Bill and Hillary Clinton have made more than $25 million in speaking fees since the start of 2014, and that Hillary Clinton also made $5 million or more from her book, Hard Choices, during the same time period. In July 2014, The Wall Street Journal reported <b>that</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of 2012, the Clintons were worth between $5 million and $25.5 million, and that in 2012 (the last year they were required to disclose the information) the Clintons made between $16 and $17 million, mostly from speaking fees earned by the former president. Clinton earned more than $104 million from paid speeches between 2001 and 2012. In June 2014, ABC News and The Washington Post reported that Bill Clinton has made more than $100 million giving paid speeches since leaving public office, and in 2008, the New York Times reported that the Clintons' income tax returns show they have made $109 million in the 8 years from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2007, including almost $92 million from his speaking and book-writing.|$|E
