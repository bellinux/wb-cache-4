40|$|Protonated dihydrogen {{trioxide}} (HOOOH) {{has been}} postulated {{in various forms}} for many years. Protonation can occur at either the terminal (HOOO(H) H+) or central (HOOH(OH) +) oxygen atom. However, to date {{there has been no}} definitive evidence provided for either of these species. In the current work we have employed ab initio methods, CCSD(T) and MP 2, with a large basis set (6 - 311 ++G(3 df, 3 pd)) to determine the relative stabilities of these species. It is shown that the terminally protonated species is strongly favored relative to the centrally protonated species (ΔE) 15. 8 kcal/mol, CCSD(T) //MP 2). The mechanism of formation of HOOO(H) H+ was determined to occur with a low barrier with the H 3 O+ occurring in a <b>thermoneutral</b> <b>reaction</b> (ΔE) - 0. 3 kcal/mol, CCSD(T) //MP 2). Although HOOO(H) H+ exists as a stable intermediate, it is extremely short-lived and rapidly decomposes (ΔE*) 8. 6 kcal/mol, MP 2) to H 3 O+ and O 2 (1 Δg). The decomposition reaction is stabilized by solvent water molecules. The short-lived nature of the intermediate implies that the intermediate species can not be observed in 17 O NMR spectra, which has been demonstrated experimentally...|$|E
40|$|Chemical {{reactions}} at ultracold temperature {{provide an}} ideal platform to study chemical reactivity at the fundamental level, {{and to understand}} how chemical reactions are governed by quantum mechanics. Recent years have witnessed the remarkable progress in studying ultracold chemistry with ultracold molecules. However, these works were limited to exothermic reactions. The direct observation of state-to-state ultracold endothermic reaction remains elusive. Here {{we report on the}} investigation of endothermic and nearly thermoneutral atom-exchange reactions in an ultracold atom-dimer mixture. By developing an indirect reactant-preparation method based on a molecular bound-bound transition, we are able to directly observe a universal endothermic reaction with tunable energy threshold and study the state-to-state reaction dynamics. The reaction rate coefficients show a strikingly threshold phenomenon. The influence of the reverse reaction on the reaction dynamics is observed for the endothermic and nearly thermoneutral reactions. We carry out zero-range quantum mechanical scattering calculations to obtain the reaction rate coefficients, and the three-body parameter is determined by comparison with the experiments. The observed endothermic and nearly <b>thermoneutral</b> <b>reaction</b> may be employed to implement collisional Sisyphus cooling of molecules, study the chemical reactions in degenerate quantum gases and conduct quantum simulation of Kondo effect with ultracold atoms.

40|$|Neutral hydroxymethylene HCOH is an {{important}} intermediate in several chemical reactions; however, {{it is difficult to}} observe due to its high reactivity. In this work, neutral hydroxymethylene and formaldehyde were generated by charge exchange neutralization of their respective ionic counterparts and then were reionized and detected as positive-ion recovery signals in neutralization-reionization mass spectrometry in a magnetic sector instrument of BEE geometry. The reionized species were characterized by their subsequent collision-induced dissociation mass spectra. The transient hydroxymethylene neutral was observed to isomerize to formaldehyde with an experimental time span exceeding 13. 9 μs. The vertical neutralization energy of the HCOH +· ion has also been assayed using charge transfer reactions between the fast ions and stationary target gases of differing ionization energy. The measured values match the result of ab initio calculations at the QCISD/ 6 - 311 + G(d,p) and CCSD(T) / 6 - 311 + + G(3 df, 2 p) levels of theory. Neutral hydroxymethylene was also produced by proton transfer from CH 2 OH + to a strong base such as pyridine, confirmed by appropriate isotopic labeling. There is a kinetic isotope effect (KIE) for H + versus D + transfer from the C atom of the hydroxymethyl cation of ∼ 3, consistent with a primary KIE of a nearly <b>thermoneutral</b> <b>reaction.</b> © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|E
40|$|The BEBO (bond energy-bond order) {{model is}} further {{examined}} {{with the results}} of ab initio calculations on a series of metathetic reactions involving hydrogen transfer. Energies are calculated at the 6 - 31 G**/PMP 2 =full/ 6 - 31 G** level while the bond-orders are estimated using the 6 - 31 G** basis set with the geometry optimisation at the single configuration unrestricted Hartree-Fock frame. Our analysis reveals that for all <b>thermoneutral</b> <b>reactions</b> where the making and breaking bonds are collinear in the transition state, the reduced distensions in the transition state structures are same and independent of the bond-order exponent in the BEBO model. For others such displacements increase with the square of the energy changes during reactions. The Bronsted coefficient is examined and is found to be neither strictly parallel to the position of the barrier in the reaction path nor a measure of the 'transition state' structure of the system...|$|R

In this work, monometallic Ni/Al 2 O 3 /cordierite, Rh/Al 2 O 3 /cordierite and bimetallic Ni-Rh/Al 2 O 3 /cordierite monolithic catalysts were prepared, characterized and tested in ATR of isooctane for syngas production. Compared to monometallic formulations, the bimetallic Ni-Rh/Al 2 O 3 catalyst was active for ATR at lower temperature and H- 2 production already reached the equilibrium composition in 400 - 550 degrees C temperature range. The Ni-Ph/Al 2 O 3 catalyst exhibited stable performances for 140 h in ATR of isooctane at 700 degrees C, and was unaffected by oxidizing conditions at 700 degrees C. <b>Thermoneutral</b> <b>reactions</b> conditions at H 2 O/C = 2 were obtained with O/C = 0. 66. Carbon deposition was marginal during ATR of isooctane and no carbons whiskers were detected.

40|$|In many plasma simulations, ion-molecule {{reactions}} are modeled using ion energy independent reaction rate coefficients that {{are taken from}} low temperature selected-ion flow tube experiments. Only exothermic or nearly <b>thermoneutral</b> <b>reactions</b> are considered. This is appropriate for plasma applications such as high-density plasma sources in which sheaths are collisionless and ion temperatures 111 the bulk p!asma do not deviate significantly from the gas temperature. However, for applications at high pressure and large sheath voltages, this assumption does not hold as the sheaths are collisional and ions gain significant energy in the sheaths from Joule heating. Ion temperatures and thus reaction rates vary significantly across the discharge, and endothermic reactions become important in the sheaths. One such application is plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition of carbon nanotubes in which dc discharges are struck at pressures between 1 - 20 Torr with applied voltages {{in the range of}} 500 - 700 V.

40|$|The Marcus cross {{relation}} {{provides a}} tool to calculate cross rates from the corresponding identity rates and the equilibrium constant. Assumptions made in deriving the Marcus cross relation and conclusions which {{can be drawn from}} agreement or disagreement between experimental and calculated cross rates are discussed. For a small variation in identity rate constants agreement between experimental and calculated cross rates simply means that the rate constant of a hypothetical <b>thermoneutral</b> cross <b>reaction</b> has a value within the range covered by the identity rates. Whether or not this value corresponds indeed to the mean value of logarithmic identity rate constants can only be checked for a large variation in identity rates. Therefore, a newly defined index M relates the difference in experimental and calculated logarithmic rate constants to the variation in the logarithmic identity rates. Provided the Marcus cross relation is not obeyed this indicates non-additivity of kinetic parameters. Applying this analysis to proton-transfers reactions between different transition metal acids and between 9 -alkylfluorenes and (9 -alkylfluorenyl) lithium shows that claims about agreement or disagreement of experimental rate constants with the rate constants calculated by means of the Marcus cross relation have to be revised in part...|$|R

The combination of density functional electronic structure techniques and a dielectric continuum model for electrostatic solvation applied to the Fe(H$_ 2 $O) $_ 6 $$^{ 3 +}$ complex yields - 1020 ~kcal/mol (experimental values - 1037 ~kcal/mol to - 1019 ~kcal/mol) for the absolute free energy of the aqueous ferric ion. The predicted reaction energy change for the first hydrolysis is 2 kcal/mol (compared to 3 kcal/mol experimental). For the second hydrolysis, we found an unexpected low energy isomer of Fe(H$_ 2 $O) $_ 4 $(OH) $_ 2 $$^{+}$ with five ligands in the inner sphere and one water outside.

40|$|Abstract: The {{present study}} focuses on {{important}} questions associated with modeling of peptide and protein stability. Computing {{at different levels}} of theory (RHF, B 3 LYP) for a representative ensemble of conformers of di- and tripeptides of alanine, we found that the Gibbs Free Energy values correlate significantly with the total electronic energy of the molecules (0. 922 R 2). For noncovalently attached but interacting peptide subunits, such as [For-NH 2] 2 or [For-L-Ala-NH 2] 2, we have found, as expected, that the basis set superimposition error (BSSE) is large in magnitude for small basis set but significantly smaller when larger basis sets [e. g., B 3 LYP/ 6 - 311 G(d,p) ] are used. Stability of the two hydrogen bonds of antiparallel -pleated sheets were quantitatively determined {{as a function of the}} molecular structure, S 10 and S 14, computed as 4. 0 0. 5 and 8. 1 1. 1 kcal/mol, respectively. Finally, a suitable <b>thermoneutral</b> isodesmic <b>reaction</b> was introduced to scale both covalently and noncovalently attached peptide units onto a common stability scale. We found that a suitable isodesmic reaction can result in the total electronic energy as well as the Gibbs free energy of a molecule, from its “noninteracting ” fragments, as accurate as a few tenths of a kcal per mol. The latter observation seems to hold for peptides regardless of their length (1 n 8) or the level of theory applied. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The combination of density functional electronic structure techniques and a dielectric continuum model for electrostatic solvation applied to the Fe(H 2 O) 6 3 + complex yields an estimate of- 1020 kcal/mol (experimental values- 1037 kcal/mol to- 1019 kcal/mol) for the absolute free energy of the aqueous ferric ion. The free energy change for the first hydrolysis reaction is predicted reasonably (2 kcal/mol predicted compared to 3 kcal/mol experimental). For the second hydrolysis reaction, we found an unexpected low energy isomer of Fe(H 2 O) 4 (OH) 2 + with five ligands in the inner sphere and one water outside. The hexa-coordinate cis and trans isomers are, respectively, slightly lower and higher in energy. Calculations on the penta-coordinate species Fe(H 2 O) 3 (OH) 2 + suggest that extrusion of the outer sphere water is nearly <b>thermoneutral.</b> The <b>reaction</b> free energy for the second hydrolysis is predicted in the range 16 - 18 kcal/mol, higher than the experimental value of 1 5 kcal/mol. In view of the facts that the theoretical predictions are higher than experimental values, and that novel structures were encountered among products of the second hydrolysis, we argue that conformational entropy is an important omission in this theoretical treatment of net reaction free energies. A fuller cataloging of low energy hydrolysis products and direct calculations of partition functions of the isolated complexes should help in modeling equilibrium speciation in groundwaters. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{few simple}} three-atom <b>thermoneutral</b> radical {{exchange}} <b>reactions</b> (i. e. A + BC [...] > AB + C) are examined by ab initio SCF methods. Emphasis is {{laid on the}} detailed analysis of density matrices rather than on energetics. Results reveal that {{the sum of the}} bond orders of the breaking and forming bonds is not conserved to unity, due to development of free valence on the migrating atom 'B' in the transition state. Bond orders, free valence and spin densities on the atoms are calculated. The present analysis shows that the bond-cleavage process is always more advanced than the bond-formation process in the transition state. Further analysis shows a development of the negative spin density on the migrating atom 'B' in the transition state. The depletion of the alpha-spin density on the radical site "A" in the reactant during the reaction lags behind the growth of the alpha-spin density on the terminal atom "C" of the reactant bond, 'B-C' in the transition state. But all these processes are completed simultaneously {{at the end of the}} reaction. Hence, the reactions are asynchronous but kinetically concerted in most cases...|$|R
