5|$|According to Kalupahana, Buddhaghosa was {{influenced}} by Mahayana-thought, which were subtly mixed with Theravada orthodoxy to introduce new ideas. Eventually <b>this</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> flowering of metaphysical tendencies, {{in contrast to the}} original stress on anattā in early Buddhism.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} it was known that the drag at {{supersonic}} speeds was strongly related to the span of the wing. <b>This</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> use of very short-span, very thin rectangular wings such as those seen on the control surfaces of many missiles, or in aircraft like the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter or the Avro 730 that the team studied. The team outlined a baseline configuration that looked like an enlarged Avro 730.|$|E
5|$|By 16:30 on Monday 12 December, it was {{reported}} that a further two tank fires had been extinguished, but that one of the tanks extinguished earlier had ruptured and re-ignited, and was now threatening to cause the explosion of an adjacent tank. <b>This</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> M1 motorway being closed again; the public exclusion area was widened, and firefighters were temporarily withdrawn until the risk posed by the threatened tank could be assessed.|$|E
5|$|In 1204, Constantinople, {{the capital}} city of the Byzantine Empire was taken by the Crusaders of the Fourth Crusade and the Republic of Venice. <b>This</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{collapse}} of the Byzantine Empire and the establishment of the Latin Empire.|$|E

5|$|In 1970 the College of Arts and Sciences {{allowed the}} first women to enroll in its {{undergraduate}} programs, which effectively made the university coeducational. <b>This</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rapid establishment of many social sororities at the university, {{and by the end}} of the 1970s there were eleven sorority chapters at the university, with still more chartered in the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, it was {{announced}} that Loring would close in 1994. <b>This</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 42nd being moved to Maxwell Air Force Base in Alabama, where it became the 42nd Air Base Wing. All other squadrons of the wing were inactivated and have remained inactive, except for the 69th, which was reactivated in 2009 at Minot Air Force Base.|$|E
5|$|In March 1984, the National Coal Board (NCB) {{proposed}} to close 20 of the 174state-owned mines and cut 20,000jobs out of 187,000. Two-thirds of the country's miners, {{led by the}} National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) under Arthur Scargill, downed tools in protest. However, Scargill had refused to hold a ballot on the strike, having previously lost three ballots on a national strike (in January and October 1982, and March 1983). <b>This</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> strike being declared illegal.|$|E

5|$|In October 2008, the WHO convoked {{a working}} group to revise the {{nomenclature}} of monoclonal antibodies, to meet challenges discussed in April the same year. <b>This</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> adoption of the new target substems in November 2009.

5|$|In September 1999, {{high winds}} during a heavy storm {{resulted}} in the dislodgement of some domes in the canopy over the building's forecourt. <b>This</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> closure of St Georges Terrace entrance as a safety precaution. The building's then-owner, the Government Employees Superannuation Board, subsequently initiated legal action against the tower's builder Multiplex.|$|E
5|$|In the 1920s, {{competition}} from small unregulated bus operators reduced {{the profitability of}} the road transport operations, leading the UERL's directors to seek government regulation. <b>This</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> establishment of the London Passenger Transport Board in 1933, which absorbed the UERL {{and all of the}} independent and municipally operated railway, bus and tram services in the London area.|$|E

5|$|Jones {{encouraged}} local {{industry to}} design and build trainers for the RAAF and produce more sophisticated combat aircraft under licence from overseas manufacturers. <b>This</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Winjeel basic trainer and Australian industry co-partnership in production of the CAC Sabre and Canberra jets; such local participation has continued to figure in major RAAF aircraft acquisitions.|$|E
5|$|Most of Bath's Grade I listed {{buildings}} {{are made from}} the local golden-coloured Bath Stone, and date from the 18th and 19th centuries. Their dominant architectural style is Georgian, which evolved from the Palladian revival style that became popular during the early 18th century. <b>This</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> entire city's designation as a World Heritage Site.|$|E
5|$|On {{election}} night, news networks {{first called}} Florida for Gore, later retracted the projection, and then called Florida for Bush, before finally retracting that projection as well.

5|$|Team 3D and MCMG {{continued}} their rivalry heading into Turning Point, with MCMG now joined by Lethal.

5|$|The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 proved {{insufficient}} in its {{objective of}} encouraging privately built and run nuclear reactors. A series of accidents with research reactors, including partial core meltdowns, made private companies cautious, and reluctant {{to become involved}} with nuclear energy without protection from liability. <b>This</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Price–Anderson Nuclear Industries Indemnity Act of 1957, which capped private liability for nuclear accidents, while providing for adequate compensations for accident victims.|$|E
