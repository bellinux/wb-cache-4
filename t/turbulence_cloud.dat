40|$|The {{focal point}} of the study {{reported}} here was the definition and examination of turbulence, wind shear and thunderstorm in relation to aviation accidents. NASA project management desired this information regarding distinct subgroups of atmospheric hazards, in order to better focus their research portfolio. A seven category expansion of Kaplan's turbulence categories was developed, which included wake turbulence, mountain wave turbulence, clear air <b>turbulence,</b> <b>cloud</b> turbulence, convective turbulence, thunderstorm without mention of turbulence, and low altitude wind shear, microburst or turbulence (with no mention of thunderstorms). More than 800 accidents from flights based in the United States during 1987 - 2008 were selected from a National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) database. Accidents were selected for inclusion in this study if turbulence, thunderstorm, wind shear or microburst was considered either a cause or a factor in the accident report, and each accident was assigned to only one hazard category. This report summarizes the differences between the categories in terms of factors such as flight operations category, aircraft engine type, the accident's geographic location and time of year, degree of injury to aircraft occupants, aircraft damage, age and certification of the pilot and the phase of flight {{at the time of the}} accident...|$|E
40|$|Abstract:Radar {{techniques}} {{have been used}} as powerful research tools to study clear air <b>turbulence,</b> <b>cloud</b> physics, and dynamics of consecutive storms and large-scale storms. Several ground-based techniques are used to observe and study turbulent echoes in the MST (Mesosphere Stratosphere Troposphere) region. This paper discusses Spaced Antenna (SA) technique using Full Correlation Analysis (FCA) to estimate wind velocity of simulated moving targets {{which is one of the}} important parameter used in various applications. Airglow intensities are recorded for three spaced regions in the sky, and observations of the moving pattern in the middle atmosphere is derived and recorded. The spaced antenna method is applied to model-generated, simulated data in order to extract the typical Full correlation analysis output parameters such as the apparent and true velocity. The quantity of principal interest is the estimate of �V�, the �random velocity parameter�. Correlation Analysis is a logical, simple yet effective way to estimate the wind velocity. These ideas are implemented using a mathematical model which can be simulated in any high level language. C language has been used to simulate the radar backscatter and �Origin� software for further analysis and calculation of useful quantities. The present model incorporates turbulent motions of the pattern under the presence of noise with varying turbulence strength & varying levels of noise...|$|E

40|$|We discuss {{constraints}} on the rates of stirring and dissipation of MHD <b>turbulence</b> in molecular <b>clouds.</b> Recent MHD simulations suggest that <b>turbulence</b> in <b>clouds</b> decays rapidly, thus providing {{a significant source of}} energy input, particularly if driven at small scales by, for example, bipolar outflows. We quantify the heating rates by combining the linewidth-size relations, which describe global cloud properties, with numerically determined dissipation rates. We argue that, if <b>cloud</b> <b>turbulence</b> is driven on small internal scales, the $^{ 12 }$CO flux (enhanced by emission from weakly supersonic shocks) will be much larger than observed; this, in turn, would imply excitation temperatures significantly above observed values. We reach two conclusions: (1) small-scale driving by bipolar outflows cannot possibly account for cloud support and yield long-lived clouds, unless the published MHD dissipation rates are seriously overestimated; (2) driving on large scales (comparable to the cloud size) is much more viable from an energetic standpoint, and if the actual net dissipation rate is only slightly lower than what current MHD simulations estimate, then the observationally inferred lifetimes and apparent virial equilibrium of molecular clouds can be explained.

40|$|The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) is {{studying}} the application and utility of various ground-based and space-based optical sensors for improving surveillance of space objects in both Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO). At present, ground-based optical and radar sensors provide the bulk of remotely sensed information on satellites and space debris, {{and will continue to}} do so into the foreseeable future. However, in recent years, the Space Based Visible (SBV) sensor was used to demonstrate that a synthesis of space-based visible data with ground-based sensor data could provide enhancements to information obtained from any one source in isolation. The incentives for space-based sensing include improved spatial resolution due to the absence of atmospheric effects and cloud cover and increased flexibility for observations. Though ground-based optical sensors can use adaptive optics to somewhat compensate for atmospheric <b>turbulence,</b> <b>cloud</b> cover and absorption are unavoidable. With recent advances in technology, we are in a far better position to consider what might constitute an ideal system to monitor our surroundings in space.

To {{investigate}} {{the processes of}} development and maintenance of low-level clouds during major synoptic events, the cloudy boundary layer under stormy conditions during the summertime Arctic has been studied using observations from the Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic Ocean (SHEBA) experiment and large-eddy simulations (LES).

The local dynamic and thermodynamic structure of the boundary layer was determined from aircraft measurements including the analysis of <b>turbulence,</b> <b>cloud</b> micro-physics and radiative properties.

40|$|Due {{to their}} coarse {{horizontal}} resolution, present-day climate models must parameterize deep convection. This paper presents single-column simulations of deep convection using a probability density function (PDF) parameterization. The PDF parameterization predicts the PDF of subgrid variability of <b>turbulence,</b> <b>clouds,</b> and hydrometeors. That variability is interfaced to a prognostic microphysics scheme using a Monte Carlo sampling method. The PDF parameterization {{is used to}} simulate tropical deep convection, the transition from shallow to deep convection over land, and midlatitude deep convection. These parameterized single-column simulations are compared with 3 -D reference simulations. The agreement is satisfactory except when the convective forcing is weak. The same PDF parameterization {{is also used to}} simulate shallow cumulus and stratocumulus layers. The PDF method is sufficiently general to adequately simulate these five deep, shallow, and stratiform cloud cases with a single equation set.

40|$|The study {{attempts}} {{to evaluate the}} aerosol indirect effects over tropical oceans in regions of deep convection applying a three-dimensional cloud-resolving model run over a doubly-periodic domain. The Tropics are modeled using a radiative-convective equilibrium idealization when the radiation, <b>turbulence,</b> <b>cloud</b> microphysics, and surface fluxes are explicitly represented while the effects of large-scale circulation are ignored. The aerosol effects are modeled by varying the number concentration of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) at 1 % supersaturation, {{which serves as a}} proxy for the aerosol amount in the environment, over a wide range, starting from pristine maritime (50 cm− 3 ) to polluted (1000 cm− 3 ) conditions. No direct effects of aerosol on radiation are included. Two sets of simulations have been run to equilibrium: fixed (non-interactive) sea surface temperature (SST) and interactive SST as predicted by a simple slab-ocean model responding to the surface radiative fluxes and surface enthalpy flux. Both sets of experiments agree on the tendency to make the shortwave cloud forcing more negative and reduce the longwave cloud forcing in response to increasing CCN concentration. These, in turn, tend to cool the SST in interactive-SST case. It is interesting that the absolute change of the SST and most other bulk quantities depends only on relative change of CCN concentration; that is, same SST change can be the result of doubling CCN concentration regardless of clean or polluted conditions. It is found that the 10 -fold increase of CCN concentration can cool the SST by as much as 1. 5 K. This is quite comparable to 2 K warming obtained in a simulation for clean maritime conditions, but doubled CO 2 concentration. Qualitative differences between the interactive and fixed SST cases have been found in sensitivity of the hydrological cycle to the increase in CCN concentration; namely, the precipitation rate shows some tendency to increase in fixed SST case, but robust tendency to decrease in interactive SST case...|$|E
40|$|Small scale <b>turbulence</b> in <b>clouds</b> plays a {{major role}} for mixing {{processes}} and the interaction between cloud droplets and the turbulent ow in the atmosphere. Mixing processes include internal mixing but also entrainment of dry and sub-saturated air into the cloud (so-called en-trainment). However, the nature of <b>cloud</b> <b>turbulence</b> on sub-meter scale has not yet been investigated in more detail since most experimental data are based on fast-ying aircraft yielding a spatial resolution of about one meter. In this paper, we present rst in-situ data of the three-dimensional wind vector with a spatial resolution on the decimeter range. The data were taken dur-ing a helicopter-borne experiment with ACTOS (Airborne <b>Cloud</b> <b>Turbulence</b> Observation System) in shallow cumu-lus clouds of different life stages (Siebert et al. 2006 c).

The existing prediction models relate the long-term average scintillation intensity to the wet term of refractivity at ground level. The comparison {{shows that the}} seasonal variation of scintillation intensity is well predicted by this relation, but for the annual average some additional meteorological information is needed. A much better agreement with measurement results is found when a parameter representing the average water content of heavy clouds is incorporated. This confirms the assumption that scintillation is, at least partly, associated with <b>turbulence</b> inside <b>clouds.</b> The asymmetry between the distributions of signal fade and enhancement can also be explained by <b>turbulence</b> inside <b>clouds.</b> The asymmetry depends on {{the intensity of the}} scintillation, which is consistent with the theory assuming a thin layer of cloudy turbulence.

This comprehensive evaluation approach covers multiple parameters and scales focusing on boundary layer variables, clouds and precipitation. The evaluation {{points to the need}} to work on parameterisations influencing the surface energy balance, and possibly on ice cloud microphysics. The central purpose for the development and application of ICON in LES configuration is the use of simulation results to improve the understanding of moist processes, as well as their parameterisation in climate models. The evaluation thus aims at building confidence in the model's ability to simulate small- to meso-scale variability in <b>turbulence,</b> <b>clouds,</b> and precipitation. The results are encouraging: the high-resolution model much better matches the observed variability at small- to meso-scales than the coarser-resolved reference model. In its highest grid resolution, the simulated turbulence profiles are realistic, and column water vapour matches the observed temporal variability at short timescales. Despite being somewhat too large and too frequent, small cumulus clouds are well represented in comparison to satellite data, as is the shape of the cloud size spectrum. Variability of cloud water matches the satellite observations much better in ICON than in the reference model.
