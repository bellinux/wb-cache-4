5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>and</b> months {{following}} Woods' admission of multiple infidelities, several companies re-evaluated {{their relationships with}} him. Accenture, AT, Gatorade and General Motors completely ended their sponsorship deals, while Gillette suspended advertising featuring Woods. TAG Heuer dropped Woods from advertising in December 2009 and officially ended their deal when his contract expired in August 2011. Golf Digest suspended Woods' monthly column beginning with the February 2010 issue. In contrast, Nike continued to support Woods, as did Electronic Arts, which was working with Woods on the game Tiger Woods PGA Tour Online. A December 2009 study estimated the shareholder loss caused by Woods' affairs to be between $5 billion and $12 billion.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} since Jock Stein's death, some, {{including}} Alex Ferguson, {{have said that they}} noticed changes in him in <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>and</b> weeks prior to the game against Wales. The night before, Stein had invited Ferguson and Andy Roxburgh to his hotel room, where he reminisced with them about his time in football, something that he rarely if ever did; he also persuaded his family not to make the trip to Cardiff to watch the game. Further, Ferguson noted that, during the half-time interval, Stein did not dominate the dressing room in the way he normally did, while Gordon Strachan found it difficult to understand precisely what Stein was saying during his team-talk. However, Strachan came to accept that the final decision Stein made, to replace him with Davie Cooper, was the correct one given Cooper's subsequent impact on the game.|$|E
5|$|Water clocks, or Fenjaan, in Persia {{reached a}} level of {{accuracy}} comparable to today's standards of timekeeping. The fenjaan was the most accurate and commonly used timekeeping device for calculating the amount or the time that a farmer must take water from a qanat or well for irrigation of the farms, until it was replaced by more accurate current clock. Persian water clocks were a practical and useful tool for the qanat's shareholders to calculate {{the length of time}} they could divert water to their farm. The qanat was the only water source for agriculture and irrigation so a just and fair water distribution was very important. Therefore, a very fair and clever old person was elected to be the manager of the water clock, and at least two full-time managers were needed to control and observe the number of fenjaans and announce the exact time during <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>and</b> nights.|$|E

The disaster also led to a number of safety improvements in the largest English football grounds, notably the elimination of fenced standing terraces in favour of all-seater stadiums in the top two tiers of English football.|$|E

25|$|On 27 May, {{a report}} {{compared}} {{the effectiveness of}} the kite balloon with aircraft found that balloon observation was better for reports of the situation in general, including that of artillery-fire. During <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>and</b> nights, the balloon observer could tell the British artillery group commander where German guns were firing, the areas worst bombarded, the areas of greatest activity, whether gas had been released and the direction it moved. Aircraft were considered better for artillery ranging, managing to operate in conditions which were impossible for the balloon. During the day, air observers saw far more gun flashes than the observation balloon crews but none after dark. A balloon observer could spot flashes at night and sometimes name the battery, given the observer's knowledge of the area. The advantage of telephone communication with the balloon observer over Morse wireless from aeroplanes was judged considerable.|$|E
25|$|Initially, the {{touching}} {{ceremony was}} an informal process.

The rapid spread of tuberculosis across France and England, however, necessitated a more formal and efficient touching process. By the time of Louis XIV of France, placards indicating <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>and</b> times the King would be available for royal touches were posted regularly; sums of money were doled out as charitable support. In England, the process was extremely formal and efficient. As late as 1633, the Book of Common Prayer of the Anglican Church contained a Royal Touch ceremony. The monarch (king or queen), sitting upon a canopied throne, touched the afflicted individual, and presented that individual with a coin – usually an Angel, a gold coin the value of which varied from about 6 shillings to about 10 shillings – by pressing it against the afflicted's neck.|$|E
