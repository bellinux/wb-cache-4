40|$|This article {{presents}} a quantitative approach to restructuring public and public utility enterprises, particularly during downsizing requests. The {{large number of}} employees {{in the public sector}} {{can be one of the}} causes for economic instability at country level. That is particularly visible in the context of the euro zone crisis and economic/political instability in countries like Greece, Portugal, Ireland, Spain and Italy. Our approach is based on the statistical analysis of productivity oscillation and setting of performance standards in public and public utility enterprises based on the aforementioned productivity. Data background is given through job descriptions, organizational charts, salary reports and monthly performance reports, in most cases part of organizational information systems. It is recommended for quantitative data to be analyzed on a monthly basis, during a period of 30 or more months. Our method increases procedural fairness and accuracy, because quantitative, statistical, impartial and objective approach is applied for estimating parameters which could be related <b>to</b> <b>downsizing.</b> However, the application of this method is not limited <b>to</b> <b>downsizing,</b> as during its application in more than 20 public and public utility enterprises it was sometimes applied to increase output or reduce costs not necessarily connected to labour. Although it finally refers <b>to</b> <b>downsizing,</b> this method can provide fairer and more impartial approach than the subjective estimate of employee surplus, and its arbitral distribution within the enterprise...|$|R

40|$|Background—The optimal {{surgical}} treatment in functional ischemic mitral regurgitation (FIMR) remains controversial. Recently, a posterior papillary muscle relocation (PMR) technique as adjunct procedure to ring annuloplasty {{has been proposed}} to prevent recurrent FIMR. In the present study, we used 3 D cardiac MRI {{to assess the impact}} of relocating both papillary muscles as adjunct procedure <b>to</b> <b>downsized</b> ring annuloplasty on mitral leaflet coaptation geometry in FIMR pigs. Methods and Results—Eleven FIMR pigs were randomized <b>to</b> <b>downsized</b> ring annuloplasty (RA; n 6) or RA combined with PMR (RAPMR, n 5). In the RAPMR group, a 2 – 0 Gore-Tex suture was attached to each trigone, exteriorized through the corresponding papillary muscle, mounted on an epicardial pad, and tightened to relocate the myocardium adjacent to the anterior and posterior papillary muscles 5 and 15 mm, respectively. Using 3 D MRI, the impact from these interventions on leaflet geometry was assessed. The distance from the posterior papillary muscle to the anterior trigone was reduced significantly more (median values) in the RAPMR compared with RA animals at end-diastole (7. 9 % versus 3. 8 %, P 0. 01) and end-systole (9. 7 % versus 2. 5 %, P 0. 02). Accordingly, lateral tethering of the coaptation point (median values) was reduced significantly more in RAPMR compared with RA animals (42. 8 % versus 29. 1 %, P 0. 01). Conclusions—Adding papillary muscle relocation <b>to</b> <b>downsized</b> ring annuloplasty reduced lateral leaflet tethering in a porcine experimental model of FIMR.
