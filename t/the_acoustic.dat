A correlation is found between <b>the</b> measured <b>acoustic</b> parameters and a linear estimate of <b>the</b> <b>acoustics</b> recovered from <b>the</b> visual data. This correlation exists despite {{the simplicity of the}} visual representation and is in rough agreement with correlations measured in earlier work by Yehia et al. using different techniques. However, analysis of the estimation errors suggests that the visual information, as parameterised in our experiment, offers only a weak constraint on <b>the</b> <b>acoustics.</b> Results are discussed from the perspective of models of early audio-visual integration...|$|R

5|$|The engines power an 18.59metre {{diameter}} five-bladed main rotor. The {{rotor blades}} are constructed from carbon/glass with nomex honeycomb and rohacell foam, edged with titanium alloy in a sandwich construction. The shaping {{of the main}} rotor blades {{is derived from the}} BERP rotor blades first used on the Westland Lynx. This blade design improves aerodynamic efficiency at the blade tip and reduces <b>the</b> <b>acoustic</b> signature. Improved BERP IV rotors have since been developed; when installed, this increases the AW101's maximum takeoff weight.|$|E

40|$|Several {{authors have}} {{proposed}} indices to synthesize <b>the</b> <b>acoustics</b> of a space, especially of concert halls. Meanwhile, {{a few studies}} have focused on <b>the</b> <b>acoustics</b> of worship spaces. The peculiarities of these last ones have shown distinctive characteristics. The increasing interest for <b>the</b> <b>acoustics</b> of worship spaces justifies the formulation of indices to synthesize <b>the</b> results of <b>acoustic</b> studies in these buildings too. This paper proposes a double synthetic index to evaluate <b>the</b> <b>acoustics</b> of a church. The index is obtained combining the average values of seven parameters generally considered in studies of architectural <b>acoustics.</b> <b>The</b> differences between requirements for music and speech in churches suggest to consider different optimal values of the selected parameters for different kinds of sound. A double synthetic index has been defined to synthesize the acoustical properties related to the music and to the speech separately. The validity of this double index is then assessed, comparing its values with subjective preferences captured through listening tests. The index, which is proposed and validated in this paper, aims to be an instrument to show synthetically the acoustical characteristics of a church to people with low knowledge in acoustics...|$|R
