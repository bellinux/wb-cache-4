5|$|The {{simplest}} possible <b>tennessine</b> compound {{would be}} the monohydride, TsH. The bonding {{is expected to be}} provided by a 7p3/2 electron of <b>tennessine</b> and the 1s electron of hydrogen. The non-bonding nature of the 7p1/2 spinor is because <b>tennessine</b> is expected not to form purely sigma or pi bonds. Therefore, the destabilized (thus expanded) 7p3/2 spinor is responsible for bonding. This effect lengthens the TsH molecule by 17picometers compared with the overall length of 195pm. Since the <b>tennessine</b> p electron bonds are two-thirds sigma, the bond is only two-thirds as strong as it would be if <b>tennessine</b> featured no spin–orbit interactions. The molecule thus follows the trend for halogen hydrides, showing an increase in bond length and a decrease in dissociation energy compared to AtH. The molecules TlTs and NhTs may be viewed analogously, taking into account an opposite effect shown {{by the fact that the}} element's p1/2 electrons are stabilized. These two characteristics result in a relatively small dipole moment (product of difference between electric charges of atoms and displacement of the atoms) for TlTs; only 1.67D, the positive value implying that the negative charge is on the <b>tennessine</b> atom. For NhTs, the strength of the effects are predicted to cause a transfer of the electron from the <b>tennessine</b> atom to the nihonium atom, with the dipole moment value being −1.80D. The spin–orbit interaction increases the dissociation energy of the TsF molecule because it lowers the electronegativity of <b>tennessine,</b> causing the bond with the extremely electronegative fluorine atom to have a more ionic character. <b>Tennessine</b> monofluoride should feature the strongest bonding of all group 17 monofluorides.|$|E
5|$|The melting and boiling {{points of}} <b>tennessine</b> are not known; earlier papers {{predicted}} about 350–500°C and 550°C, respectively, or 350–550°C and 610°C, respectively. These values exceed those of astatine and the lighter halogens, following periodic trends. A later paper predicts {{the boiling point}} of <b>tennessine</b> to be 345°C (that of astatine is estimated as 309°C, 337°C, or 370°C, although experimental values of 230°C and 411°C have been reported). The density of <b>tennessine</b> {{is expected to be}} between 7.1 and 7.3g·cm−3, continuing the trend of increasing density among the halogens; that of astatine is estimated to be between 6.2 and 6.5g·cm−3.|$|E
5|$|There {{is another}} {{opportunity}} for <b>tennessine</b> to complete its octet—by forming a covalent bond. Like the halogens, when two <b>tennessine</b> atoms meet {{they are expected}} to form a Ts–Ts bond to give a diatomic molecule. Such molecules are commonly bound via single sigma bonds between the atoms; these are different from pi bonds, which are divided into two parts, each shifted in a direction perpendicular to the line between the atoms, and opposite one another rather than being located directly between the atoms they bind. Sigma bonding has been calculated to show a great antibonding character in the At2 molecule and is not as favorable energetically. <b>Tennessine</b> is predicted to continue the trend; a strong pi character should be seen in the bonding of Ts2. The molecule <b>tennessine</b> chloride (TsCl) is predicted to go further, being bonded with a single pi bond.|$|E
5|$|Two heavier {{isotopes}} of moscovium, 289Mc and 290Mc, {{were discovered}} in 2009–2010 as daughters of the <b>tennessine</b> isotopes 293Ts and 294Ts; the isotope 289Mc was later also synthesized directly and confirmed {{to have the same}} properties as found in the <b>tennessine</b> experiments. The JINR also has plans to study lighter isotopes of moscovium in 2017 by replacing the americium-243 target with the lighter isotope americium-241.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the {{previous}} group 17 elements, <b>tennessine</b> may not exhibit the chemical behavior {{common to the}} halogens. For example, the extant {{members of the group}} routinely accept an electron to achieve the more stable electronic configuration of a noble gas, one having eight electrons (octet) in its valence shell. This ability weakens as atomic weight increases going down the group; <b>tennessine</b> would be the least willing to accept an electron. Of the oxidation states it is predicted to form, −1 {{is expected to be the}} least common. The standard reduction potential of the Ts/Ts− couple is predicted to be −0.25V; this value is negative and thus <b>tennessine</b> should not be reduced to the −1 oxidation state under standard conditions, unlike all {{the previous}} halogens.|$|E
5|$|<b>Tennessine</b> is a {{synthetic}} superheavy chemical element with symbol Ts and atomic number 117. It is the second-heaviest known element and the penultimate {{element of the}} 7th period of the periodic table.|$|E
5|$|As of 2016, the {{periodic}} table has 118 confirmed elements, from element 1 (hydrogen) to 118 (oganesson). Elements 113, 115, 117 and 118, the most recent discoveries, were officially confirmed by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) in December 2015. Their proposed names, nihonium (Nh), moscovium (Mc), <b>tennessine</b> (Ts) and oganesson (Og) respectively, were announced by the IUPAC in June 2016 and made official in November 2016.|$|E
5|$|A 22milligram {{batch of}} berkelium-249 was {{prepared}} in a 250-day irradiation and then purified for 90 days at Oak Ridge in 2009. This target yielded the first 6 atoms of <b>tennessine</b> at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR), Dubna, Russia, after bombarding it with calcium ions in the U400 cyclotron for 150 days. This synthesis was a {{culmination of the}} Russia—US collaboration between JINR and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory on the synthesis of elements 113 to 118 which was initiated in 1989.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{calculated}} that the isotope 295Ts would have a half-life of 18±7milliseconds and {{that it may be}} possible to produce this isotope via the same berkelium–calcium reaction used in the discoveries of the known isotopes, 293Ts and 294Ts. The chance of this reaction producing 295Ts is estimated to be, at most, one-seventh the chance of producing 294Ts. Calculations using a quantum tunneling model predict the existence of several isotopes of <b>tennessine</b> up to 303Ts. The most stable of these is expected to be 296Ts with an alpha-decay half-life of 40milliseconds. A liquid drop model study on the element's isotopes shows similar results; it suggests a general trend of increasing stability for isotopes heavier than 301Ts, with partial half-lives exceeding the age of the universe for the heaviest isotopes like 335Ts when beta decay is not considered. Lighter isotopes of <b>tennessine</b> may be produced in the 243Am+50Ti reaction, which was considered as a contingency plan by the Dubna team in 2008 if 249Bk proved unavailable,Ca + 238U-249Cf |trans-title=Synthesis of new elements 113–118 in complete fusion reactions 48Ca + 238U–249Cf |last=Utyonkov |first=V.

5|$|All {{elements}} from atomic numbers 1 (hydrogen) to 118 (oganesson) {{have been discovered}} or synthesized, with the most recent additions (nihonium, moscovium, <b>tennessine,</b> and oganesson) being confirmed by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) in 2015 and officially named in 2016: they complete the first seven rows of the periodic table. The first 94 elements exist naturally, although some are found only in trace amounts and were synthesized in laboratories before being found in nature. Elements with atomic numbers from 95 to 118 have only been synthesized in laboratories or nuclear reactors. Synthesis of elements having higher atomic numbers is being pursued. Numerous synthetic radionuclides of naturally occurring elements have also been produced in laboratories.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} {{unstable}} −1 state, three more oxidation states are predicted; +5, +3, and +1. The +1 state should be especially stable {{because of the}} destabilization of the three outermost 7p3/2 electrons, forming a stable, half-filled subshell configuration; astatine shows similar effects. The +3 state should be important, again due to the destabilized 7p3/2 electrons. The +5 state is predicted to be uncommon because the 7p1/2 electrons are oppositely stabilized. The +7 state has not been shown—even computationally—to be achievable. Because the 7s electrons are greatly stabilized, it has been hypothesized that <b>tennessine</b> effectively has only five valence electrons.|$|E
5|$|Just {{over one}} gram of {{berkelium}} has been {{produced in the}} United States since 1967. There is no practical application of berkelium outside scientific research which is mostly directed at the synthesis of heavier transuranic elements and transactinides. A 22milligram batch of berkelium-249 was prepared during a 250-day irradiation period and then purified for a further 90 days at Oak Ridge in 2009. This sample was used to synthesize the new element <b>tennessine</b> {{for the first time}} in 2009 at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research, Russia, after it was bombarded with calcium-48 ions for 150 days. This was the culmination of the Russia–US collaboration on the synthesis of the heaviest elements on the periodic table.|$|E
5|$|Although minute {{quantities}} of some transuranic elements occur naturally, {{they were all}} first discovered in laboratories. Their production has expanded the periodic table significantly, {{the first of these}} being neptunium, synthesized in 1939. Because many of the transuranic elements are highly unstable and decay quickly, they are challenging to detect and characterize when produced. There have been controversies concerning the acceptance of competing discovery claims for some elements, requiring independent review to determine which party has priority, and hence naming rights. In 2010, a joint Russia–US collaboration at Dubna, Moscow Oblast, Russia, claimed to have synthesized six atoms of <b>tennessine</b> (element 117), making it the most recently claimed discovery. It, along with nihonium (element 113), moscovium (element 115), and oganesson (element 118), are the four most recently named elements, whose names all became official on 28 November 2016.|$|E
5|$|In December 2015, the Joint Working Party of {{international}} scientific bodies International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) and International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP) recognized the element's discovery and assigned {{the priority of}} the discovery to the Dubna–Livermore collaboration. This was on account of two 2009 and 2010 confirmations of {{the properties of the}} granddaughter of 294Og, 286Fl, at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, as well as the observation of another consistent decay chain of 294Og by the Dubna group in 2012. The goal of that experiment had been the synthesis of 294Ts via the reaction 249Bk(48Ca,3n), but the short half-life of 249Bk resulted in a significant quantity of the target having decayed to 249Cf, resulting in the synthesis of oganesson instead of <b>tennessine.</b>|$|E
5|$|The sum {{argument}} {{advanced by}} the JWP in {{the approval of}} the discovery of nihonium was later criticized in a May 2016 study from Lund University and the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research, as it is only valid if no gamma decay or internal conversion takes place along the decay chain, which is not likely for odd nuclei, and the uncertainty of the alpha decay energies measured in the 278Nh decay chain was not small enough to rule out this possibility; and if this is the case, similarity in lifetimes of intermediate daughters become a meaningless argument, as different isomers of the same nuclide can have wildly different half-lives (the ground state of 180Ta has a half-life of mere hours, but an excited state 180mTa has never been observed to decay). However, although this study found reason to doubt and criticize the IUPAC approval of the discoveries of moscovium and <b>tennessine,</b> the data from RIKEN for nihonium was found to be congruent, and the data from the Dubna team for moscovium and nihonium to probably be so, thus necessitating no criticism of the IUPAC approval of the discovery of element 113.|$|E
5|$|A 2016 {{calculation}} of the half-lives of the isotopes of unbiunium from 290Ubu to 339Ubu suggested that those from 290Ubu to 303Ubu would not be bound and would decay through proton emission, those from 304Ubu through 314Ubu would undergo alpha decay, and those from 315Ubu to 339Ubu would undergo spontaneous fission. Only the isotopes from 309Ubu to 314Ubu would have long enough alpha-decay lifetimes to be detected in laboratories, starting decay chains terminating in spontaneous fission at moscovium, <b>tennessine,</b> or ununennium. This would present a grave problem for experiments aiming at synthesising isotopes of unbiunium if true, because the isotopes whose alpha decay could be observed {{could not be reached}} by any presently usable combination of target and projectile. Calculations in 2016 and 2017 by the same authors on elements 123 and 125 suggest a less bleak outcome, with alpha decay chains from the more reachable nuclides 300–307Ubt leading down to bohrium or nihonium; in particular, 304Ubt could be synthesised in the reaction 249Bk(58Fe,3n)304Ubt and would alpha decay through 300Ubu, 296Uue, and 292Ts to the known 288Mc and 284Nh, though the cross-section would likely be extremely low. It has also been suggested that cluster decay might be a significant decay mode in competition with alpha decay and spontaneous fission in the region past Z = 120, which would pose yet another hurdle for experimental identification of these nuclides.|$|E
5|$|For further {{elements}} up to 124, {{given that}} increasing the neutron number allows for {{getting closer to}} the predicted closed neutron shell at N = 184 that would confer stability, the use of weakly radioactive iron-60 instead of stable iron-58 as a projectile has been considered. 60Fe has a half-life of 2.6 million years. The isotopes 299Ubu, 300Ubu, and 301Ubu that could be produced in these reactions via the 3n and 4n channels {{are expected to be}} the only reachable unbiunium isotopes with half-lives long enough for detection; the cross-sections would nevertheless push the limits of what can currently be detected. They would decay through isotopes of ununennium that could be produced by cross-bombardments in the 248Cm+51V or 249Bk+50Ti reactions, which will be tried at RIKEN and JINR respectively in 2019–2020, down through known isotopes of <b>tennessine</b> and moscovium synthesised in the 249Bk+48Ca and 243Am+48Ca reactions. The multiplicity of excited states populated by the alpha decay of odd nuclei may however preclude clear cross-bombardment cases, as was seen in the purported yet likely nonexistent link between nuclides assigned to 293Ts and 289Mc. Heavier isotopes are expected to be more stable; 320Ubu is predicted to be the most stable unbiunium isotope, but {{there is no way to}} synthesise it with current technology as no combination of usable target and projectile could provide enough neutrons.|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} neutron sources at ORNL; the High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR), the Oak Ridge Electron Linear Accelerator (ORELA) and the Spallation Neutron Source. HFIR {{provides}} neutrons {{in a stable}} beam resulting from a constant nuclear reaction whereas ORELA and SNS produce pulses of neutrons as they are particle accelerators. HFIR went critical in 1965 and {{has been used for}} materials research and as a major source of medical radioisotopes since. As of 2013, HFIR provides the world's highest constant neutron flux as a result of various upgrades. As part of a US non-proliferation effort the HFIR is scheduled to switch from highly enriched uranium (>90%, weapons grade) to low-enriched (3–4%) in 2020; the last reactor in the US to do so. Berkelium used to produce the world's first sample of <b>tennessine</b> was produced in the High Flux Isotope Reactor as part of an international effort. HFIR is likely to operate until approximately 2060 before the reactor vessel is considered unsafe for continued use.|$|E
500|$|Tennessine's first {{ionization}} energy—the energy {{required to}} remove an electron from a neutral atom—is predicted to be 7.7eV, {{lower than those}} of the halogens, again following the trend. [...] Like its neighbors in the periodic table, <b>tennessine</b> is expected to have the lowest electron affinity—energy released when an electron is added to the atom—in its group; 2.6 or 1.8eV. The electron of the hypothetical hydrogen-like <b>tennessine</b> atom—oxidized so it has only one electron, Ts116+—is predicted to move so quickly that its mass is 1.9 times that of a non-moving electron, a feature attributable to relativistic effects. For comparison, the figure for hydrogen-like astatine is 1.27 and the figure for hydrogen-like iodine is 1.08. Simple extrapolations of relativity laws indicate a contraction of atomic radius. Advanced calculations show that the radius of an <b>tennessine</b> atom that has formed one covalent bond would be 165pm, while that of astatine would be 147pm. With the seven outermost electrons removed, <b>tennessine</b> is finally smaller; 57pm for <b>tennessine</b> and 61pm for astatine.|$|E
500|$|<b>Tennessine</b> may {{be located}} in the [...] "island of stability", a concept that {{explains}} why some superheavy elements are more stable compared to an overall trend of decreasing stability for elements beyond bismuth on the periodic table. The synthesized <b>tennessine</b> atoms have lasted tens and hundreds of milliseconds. In the periodic table, <b>tennessine</b> {{is expected to be a}} member of group 17, all other members of which are halogens. Some of its properties may significantly differ from those of the halogens due to relativistic effects. As a result, <b>tennessine</b> is expected to be a volatile metal that neither forms anions nor achieves high oxidation states. A few key properties, such as its melting and boiling points and its first ionization energy, are nevertheless expected to follow the periodic trends of the halogens.|$|E
500|$|<b>Tennessine</b> is {{expected}} to be a member of group 17 in the periodic table, below the five halogens; fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine, and astatine, each of which has seven valence electrons with a configuration of [...] For <b>tennessine,</b> being in the seventh period (row) of the periodic table, continuing the trend would predict a valence electron configuration of , and it would therefore be expected to behave similarly to the halogens in many respects that relate to this electronic state. However, going down group 17, the metallicity of the elements increases; for example, iodine already exhibits a metallic luster in the solid state, and astatine is often classified as a metalloid due to its properties being quite far from those of the four previous halogens. As such, an extrapolation based on periodic trends would predict <b>tennessine</b> to be a rather volatile post-transition metal.|$|E
500|$|Calculations have {{confirmed}} {{the accuracy of}} this simple extrapolation, although experimental verification of this is currently impossible as the half-lives of the known <b>tennessine</b> isotopes are too short. Significant differences between <b>tennessine</b> and the previous halogens are likely to arise, largely due to spin–orbit interaction— the mutual interaction between the motion and spin of electrons. The spin–orbit interaction is especially strong for the superheavy elements because their electrons move faster— at velocities comparable to the speed of light— than those in lighter atoms. In <b>tennessine</b> atoms, this lowers the 7s and the 7p electron energy levels, stabilizing the corresponding electrons, although two of the 7p electron energy levels are more stabilized than the other four. The stabilization of the 7s electrons is called the inert pair effect; the effect that separates the 7p subshell into the more-stabilized and the less-stabilized parts is called subshell splitting. Computational chemists understand the split as a change of the second (azimuthal) quantum number l from 1 to 1/2 and 3/2 for the more-stabilized and less-stabilized parts of the 7p subshell, respectively. For many theoretical purposes, the valence electron configuration may be represented to reflect the 7p subshell split as [...]|$|E
500|$|In 2016, Pratchett fans {{petitioned the}} International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) to name {{chemical}} element 117, temporarily called ununseptium, as octarine with the proposed symbol Oc (pronounced [...] "ook"). The final name chosen for element 117 was <b>tennessine</b> with the symbol Ts.|$|E
500|$|The {{discovery}} of <b>tennessine</b> was officially announced in Dubna, Russia, by a Russian–American collaboration in April 2010, {{which makes it}} the most recently discovered element [...] One of its daughter isotopes was created directly in 2011, partially confirming {{the results of the}} experiment. The experiment itself was repeated successfully by the same collaboration in 2012 and by a joint German–American team in May 2014. In December 2015, the Joint Working Party of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) and the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics, which evaluates claims of {{discovery of}} new elements, recognized the element and assigned the priority to the Russian–American team. In June 2016, the IUPAC published a declaration stating that the discoverers suggested the name <b>tennessine</b> after Tennessee, United States. In November 2016, they officially adopted the name [...] "tennessine".|$|E
500|$|A 2016 {{study from}} Lund University and the GSI {{nevertheless}} cast some {{doubt on the}} syntheses of moscovium and <b>tennessine</b> after the IUPAC/IUPAP Joint Working Party recognized these elements as having been discovered in 2009–2010. It found that the decay chains assigned to the isotopes 287Mc and 288Mc were probably internally consistent, with the uncertainty due to the probable insensitivity of the measurements to very short and very long nuclide lifetimes, incorrect assignments of other decay chains from the 243Am+48Ca reaction to different moscovium isotopes, or uncertainty {{in the identification of}} some of the daughters of these moscovium isotopes. On the other hand, the decay chains assigned to 289Mc, the isotope instrumental in the official confirmation of the synthesis of moscovium and <b>tennessine,</b> were found not to be internally consistent. Some subsets of these chains were found to be consistent, suggesting however that their true assignment was to 288Mc, and that their shortness indicated instead new spontaneous fission branches in its daughters 284Nh and 280Rg – or, more likely, undetected electron capture branches in these daughters leading to the even–even nuclides 284Cn and 280Ds, which have a very low barrier to spontaneous fission. While the 294Ts decay chains were found to be congruent, the 293Ts decay chains approved by the JWP were found to probably not be so and require splitting into individual data sets assigned to different <b>tennessine</b> isotopes. It was also found that the set of chains from 293Ts and 289Mc were not congruent. The multiplicity of states found when nuclides that are not even–even undergo alpha decay is not unexpected and contributes to the lack of clarity in the cross-reactions. This study criticised the IUPAC/IUPAP JWP report for overlooking subtleties associated with this issue, and noted that the fact that the only argument for the acceptance of the discoveries of moscovium and <b>tennessine</b> was an almost certainly non-existent link was [...] "problematic".|$|E
500|$|In March 2016, the {{discovery}} team {{agreed on a}} conference call involving representatives from the parties involved on the name [...] "tennessine" [...] for element 117. In June 2016, IUPAC published a declaration stating the discoverers had submitted their suggestions for naming the new elements 115, 117, and 118 to the IUPAC; the suggestion for the element 117 was <b>tennessine,</b> with a symbol of Ts, after [...] "the region of Tennessee". The suggested names were recommended for acceptance by the IUPAC Inorganic Chemistry Division; formal acceptance was set to occur after a five-months term following publishing of the declaration expires. In November 2016, the names, including <b>tennessine,</b> were formally accepted. Concerns that the proposed symbol Ts may clash with a notation for the tosyl group used in organic chemistry were rejected, following existing symbols bearing such dual meanings: Ac (actinium and acetyl) and Pr (praseodymium and propyl).|$|E
500|$|Differences {{for other}} {{electron}} levels also exist. For example, the 6d electron levels (also split in two, with four being 6d3/2 and six being 6d5/2) are both raised, {{so they are}} close in energy to the 7s ones, although no 6d electron chemistry has been predicted for <b>tennessine.</b> The difference between the 7p1/2 and 7p3/2 levels is abnormally high; 9.8eV. Astatine's 6p subshell split is only 3.8eV, and its 6p1/2 chemistry has already been called [...] "limited". These effects cause tennessine's chemistry to {{differ from those of}} its upper neighbors (see below).|$|E
500|$|The {{experiment}} was originally planned {{to continue to}} November 2012, but was stopped early {{to make use of}} the 249Bk target to confirm the synthesis of <b>tennessine</b> (thus changing the projectiles to 48Ca). This reaction between 249Bk and 50Ti was predicted to be the most favorable practical reaction for formation of ununennium, as it is rather asymmetrical, though also somewhat cold. (The reaction between 254Es and 48Ca would be superior, but preparing milligram quantities of 254Es for a target is difficult.) Nevertheless, the necessary change from the [...] "silver bullet" [...] 48Ca to 50Ti divides the expected yield of ununennium by about twenty, as the yield is strongly dependent on the asymmetry of the fusion reaction.|$|E
500|$|The {{stability}} of nuclei quickly decreases {{with the increase}} in atomic number after curium, element 96, whose half-life is four orders of magnitude longer than that of any subsequent element. All isotopes with an atomic number above 101 undergo radioactive decay with half-lives of less than 30 hours. No elements with atomic numbers above 82 (after lead) have stable isotopes. Nevertheless, for reasons not yet well understood, there is a slight increase of nuclear stability around atomic numbers 110–114, which leads to the appearance of what is known in nuclear physics as the [...] "island of stability". This concept, proposed by University of California professor Glenn Seaborg, explains why superheavy elements last longer than predicted. <b>Tennessine</b> is the second-heaviest element created so far, and all its known isotopes have half-lives of less than one second. Nevertheless, this is longer than the values predicted prior to their discovery. The Dubna team believes that the synthesis of the element is direct experimental proof of the existence of the island of stability.|$|E

If relativistic effects are ignored, TsF3 should follow its lighter congeners in having a bent-T-shaped molecular geometry. More sophisticated predictions show that this molecular geometry would not be energetically favored for TsF3, predicting instead a trigonal planar molecular geometry (AX3E0).

In 1985, a joint experiment between Berkeley and Peter Armbruster's team at GSI, the result was again negative with a calculated cross-section limit of 10–100pb. Work on reactions with 48Ca, which had proved very useful in the synthesis of nobelium from the natPb+48Ca reaction, nevertheless continued at Dubna, with a superheavy element separator being developed in 1989, a search for target materials and starting of collaborations with LLNL being started in 1990, production of more intense 48Ca beams being started in 1996, and preparations for long-term experiments with three orders of magnitude higher sensitivity being performed in the early 1990s. This work led directly {{to the production of}} new isotopes of elements 112 to 118 in the reactions of 48Ca with actinide targets and the discovery of the five heaviest elements on the periodic table: flerovium, moscovium, livermorium, <b>tennessine,</b> and oganesson.Ca with 248Cm in the Bombarding Energy Range of 4.5–5.2MeV/u |year=1985 |last=Armbruster |first=P. |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=54 |pages=406–409 |pmid=10031507 |last2=Agarwal |first2=YK |last3=Brüchle |first3=W |last4=Brügger |first4=M |last5=Dufour |first5=JP |last6=Gaggeler |first6=H |last7=Hessberger |first7=FP |last8=Hofmann |first8=S |last9=Lemmertz |first9=P |last10=Münzenberg |first10=G. |last11=Poppensieker |first11=K. |last12=Reisdorf |first12=W. |last13=Schädel |first13=M. |last14=Schmidt |first14=K. |last15=Schneider |first15=J. |last16=Schneider |first16=W. |last17=Sümmerer |first17=K. |last18=Vermeulen |first18=D. |last19=Wirth |first19=G. |last20=Ghiorso |first20=A. |last21=Gregorich |first21=K. |last22=Lee |first22=D. |last23=Leino |first23=M. |last24=Moody |first24=K. |last25=Seaborg |first25=G. |last26=Welch |first26=R. |last27=Wilmarth |first27=P. |last28=Yashita |first28=S. |last29=Frink |first29=C. |last30=Greulich |first30=N. |issue=5 |bibcode=1985PhRvL..54..406A |display-authors=8}} ...|$|E
500|$|Nihonium is {{the first}} member of the 7p series of {{elements}} and the heaviest group 13 element on the periodic table, below boron, aluminium, gallium, indium, and thallium. It is predicted to show many differences from its lighter homologues: a largely contributing effect is the spin–orbit (SO) interaction. It is especially strong for the superheavy elements, because their electrons move much faster than in lighter atoms, at velocities comparable to the speed of light. In relation to nihonium atoms, it lowers the 7s and the 7p electron energy levels (stabilizing the corresponding electrons), but two of the 7p electron energy levels are stabilized more than the other four. The stabilization of the 7s electrons is called the inert pair effect, and the effect [...] "tearing" [...] the 7p subshell into the more stabilized and the less stabilized parts is called the subshell splitting. Computation chemists see the split as a change of the second (azimuthal) quantum number l from 1 to 1/2 and 3/2 for the more stabilized and less stabilized parts of the 7p subshell, respectively. For many theoretical purposes, the valence electron configuration may be represented to reflect the 7p subshell split as 7s27p1/21. These effects stabilize lower oxidation states: the first ionization energy of nihonium is expected to be 7.306eV, the highest in group 13. Hence, the most stable oxidation state of nihonium is predicted to be the +1 state, and nihonium is expected to be less reactive than thallium. Differences for other electron levels also exist. For example, the 6d electron levels (also split in halves, with four being 6d3/2 and six being 6d5/2) are both raised, so that they are close in energy to the 7s ones. Thus, the 6d electron levels, being destabilized, should still be able to participate in chemical reactions in nihonium (as well as in the next 7p element, flerovium), thus making it behave in some ways like transition metals and allow higher oxidation states. Nihonium should hence also be able to show stable +3 and possibly also +5 oxidation states. However, the +3 state should still be less stable than the +1 state, following periodic trends. Nihonium should be the most electronegative among all the group 13 elements: for example, in the compound NhTs, the negative charge is expected to be on the nihonium atom rather than the <b>tennessine</b> atom, the opposite of what would be expected from simple periodicity. The electron affinity of nihonium is calculated to be around 0.68eV; in comparison, that of thallium is 0.4eV. The high electron affinity and electronegativity of nihonium are due to it being only one electron short of the closed-shell valence electron configuration of flerovium (7s27p1/22): this would make the −1 oxidation state of nihonium more stable than that of its lighter congener thallium. The standard electrode potential for the Nh+/Nh couple is predicted to be −0.6V.|$|E
2500|$|The {{experiment}} was originally planned {{to continue to}} November 2012, but was stopped early {{to make use of}} the 249Bk target to confirm the synthesis of <b>tennessine</b> (thus changing the projectiles to 48Ca). This reaction between 249Bk and 50Ti was predicted to be the most favorable practical reaction for formation of ununennium, as it is rather asymmetrical, though also somewhat cold. (The reaction between 254Es and 48Ca would be superior, but preparing milligram quantities of 254Es for a target is difficult.) Nevertheless, the necessary change from the [...] "silver bullet" [...] 48Ca to 50Ti divides the expected yield of ununennium by about twenty, as the yield is strongly dependent on the asymmetry of the fusion reaction.|$|E
50|$|The {{simplest}} possible <b>tennessine</b> compound {{would be}} the monohydride, TsH. The bonding {{is expected to be}} provided by a 7p3/2 electron of <b>tennessine</b> and the 1s electron of hydrogen. The non-bonding nature of the 7p1/2 spinor is because <b>tennessine</b> is expected not to form purely sigma or pi bonds. Therefore, the destabilized (thus expanded) 7p3/2 spinor is responsible for bonding. This effect lengthens the TsH molecule by 17 picometers compared with the overall length of 195 pm. Since the <b>tennessine</b> p electron bonds are two-thirds sigma, the bond is only two-thirds as strong as it would be if <b>tennessine</b> featured no spin-orbit interactions. The molecule thus follows the trend for halogen hydrides, showing an increase in bond length and a decrease in dissociation energy compared to AtH. The molecules TlTs and NhTs may be viewed analogously, taking into account an opposite effect shown {{by the fact that the}} element's p1/2 electrons are stabilized. These two characteristics result in a relatively small dipole moment (product of difference between electric charges of atoms and displacement of the atoms) for TlTs; only 1.67 D, the positive value implying that the negative charge is on the <b>tennessine</b> atom. For NhTs, the strength of the effects are predicted to cause a transfer of the electron from the <b>tennessine</b> atom to the nihonium atom, with the dipole moment value being −1.80 D. The spin-orbit interaction increases the dissociation energy of the TsF molecule because it lowers the electronegativity of <b>tennessine,</b> causing the bond with the extremely electronegative fluorine atom to have a more ionic character. <b>Tennessine</b> monofluoride should feature the strongest bonding of all group 17 monofluorides.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Tennessine</b> may {{be located}} in the [...] "island of stability", a concept that {{explains}} why some superheavy elements are more stable compared to an overall trend of decreasing stability for elements beyond bismuth on the periodic table. The synthesized <b>tennessine</b> atoms have lasted tens and hundreds of milliseconds. In the periodic table, <b>tennessine</b> {{is expected to be a}} member of group 17, all other members of which are halogens. Some of its properties may significantly differ from those of the halogens due to relativistic effects. As a result, <b>tennessine</b> is expected to be a volatile metal that neither forms anions nor achieves high oxidation states. A few key properties, such as its melting and boiling points and its first ionization energy, are nevertheless expected to follow the periodic trends of the halogens.|$|E
