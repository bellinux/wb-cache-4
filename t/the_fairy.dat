5|$|According to the Bannatyne {{manuscript}}, <b>the</b> <b>Fairy</b> Flag {{was also}} unfurled during the Battle of Glendale, which the manuscript states {{to have been}} fought in about 1490. At one point during this conflict, both the MacLeods of Harris and Dunvegan, and the MacLeods of Lewis {{were on the verge}} of giving way to the invading MacDonalds. Just at this moment, the mother of Alasdair Crotach, chief of the MacLeods of Harris and Dunvegan, ordered <b>the</b> <b>Fairy</b> Flag to be unfurled. The result was that both MacLeod clans renewed the battle with redoubled fury and, despite immense losses, eventually won the battle. Among the MacLeod dead was the flag bearer, Paul Dubh, who carried <b>the</b> <b>Fairy</b> Flag throughout the conflict until his death. The Bannatyne manuscript relates that Paul Dubh was honourably buried in a deep stone coffin, with a metal grate — much like the account given in the c.1800 manuscript. The writer of the Bannatyne manuscript states that each successive flag bearer was buried within this tomb, and that the writer's own grandfather saw the old ceremony performed for the last time, in the 18th century. The Bannatyne manuscript states that the tomb is located in the north-east corner of the chancel at St Clements Church, in Rodel. R.C. MacLeod noted that there was no trace of such a coffin or tomb; although, he suggested that it could have been buried or possibly built within a wall.|$|E
40|$|In the English stage {{history of}} Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream, <b>the</b> <b>fairies</b> {{underwent}} decisive {{changes in their}} function. An imaginative presentation of <b>the</b> <b>fairies</b> is essential to any production of the Dream; however, the past history of the productions proved otherwise. For example, after the Restoration, the presence of <b>the</b> <b>fairies</b> was required only for a decorative purpose. The romanticization of the play in the subsequent centuries further encouraged this trend until the redefinition of <b>the</b> <b>fairies</b> in this century finally redeemed their positive function within the play. This essay attempts to follow {{the process of the}} fairies' transformation on the English stage and see how the changing ideas of <b>the</b> <b>fairies</b> themselves incited this transformation...|$|R

5|$|As Lois finds Chris and {{his friends}} {{watching}} a pornographic film, she becomes convinced a proper sex-ed class should be taught at his school. Since the sex-ed class at her children's school was removed, Lois decides to become the school's newest sex-ed teacher. In class, she attempts to teach students about safe sex, but her efforts are ruined by a botched attempt of Peter, who wishes to distribute his views on sex as well. Soon after the first sex-ed class, parental protests arise as Lois taught kids about safe ways to perform premarital sex, rather than abstinence. As a result, Lois is subsequently fired. She {{is replaced by a}} reverend who promotes both premarital and marital abstinence, explaining fictional consequences of intercourse with various questionable examples. The idea appeals to most students, including Meg, who starts a relationship with a fellow student named Doug. In a subplot, Stewie loses a tooth and is told about the tooth fairy. Frightened by <b>the</b> <b>fairy</b> tale, Stewie develops a plan to capture <b>the</b> <b>fairy,</b> not knowing she does not exist. He borrows Herbert's false teeth and provokes Brian's girlfriend Jillian to throw up, as she has bulimia nervosa, in order to collect her teeth as well. Brian, overseeing Stewie's increasing obsession with <b>the</b> <b>fairy,</b> reveals to Stewie that she does not exist, but another scene shows a man named T. Fairy, having an apparent tooth fetish, stealing teeth to roll around in them.|$|E

5|$|In Maleficent (2014), a live-action re-imagining of the {{animated}} film in which Sleeping Beauty is retold {{from the perspective}} of the villain, Aurora is portrayed by actress Elle Fanning, while actress Janet McTeer voices an elderly version of the character in the role of film's narrator. The princess is raised by Maleficent after first being cursed by <b>the</b> <b>fairy</b> in an act of revenge against her father King Stefan, only for a strong mother-daughter bond to develop between the characters; Aurora affectionately refers to Maleficent as her fairy godmother. When her curse is finally fulfilled, Aurora is awoken by Maleficent's remorseful kiss to her forehead as opposed to a prince's. Aurora defends Maleficent from her father, and eventually returns her wings to her when she is crowned queen of both the human kingdom and <b>the</b> <b>fairy</b> kingdom known as the Moors.|$|E
5|$|R.C. MacLeod listed another tradition, {{somewhat}} {{similar to the}} one that appeared in c.1800 manuscript. According to this version, a MacLeod joined a Crusading army, and went to the Holy Land. While in the desert-wilderness, he came across a witch, from whom he managed to escape. He then came upon a river, and proceeded to cross it at a ford. However, a fairy maiden appeared from the water and blocked his passage. After a struggle, MacLeod overcame <b>the</b> <b>fairy</b> and passed over the river. He then became friends with her. Before they parted, <b>the</b> <b>fairy</b> maiden gave him a box of scented wood; this box, she told him, held several other smaller boxes, which fitted inside one another. She told him that the innermost box contained a magic banner, which when waved would bring forth a host of armed men to aid its owner. <b>The</b> <b>fairy</b> warned the MacLeod, that if he were to open the box within a year and a day from then, that no crops would grow on his land, no livestock would be born, as well as no children. When the MacLeod returned home he gave the box to the chief's wife. The wife, however, ignored the MacLeod's warning, and opened the box. Immediately a host of armed men appeared and that year, no children were born. The tradition concluded that ever since that time, the flag had been preserved for a time when such an army might mean salvation for the clan.|$|E
