25|$|On 21 May 1920, a {{break for}} Villa came when Carranza, along with his <b>top</b> <b>advisers</b> and {{supporters}}, was assassinated by supporters of Álvaro Obregón. With his nemesis dead, Villa was now ready to negotiate a peace settlement and retire. On 22 July 1920, Villa {{was finally able to}} send a telegram to Mexican interim President Adolfo de la Huerta, which stated that he recognized Huerta's presidency and requested amnesty.

25|$|In late 1938, {{during the}} great crisis in Europe over Czechoslovakia that culminated in the Munich Agreement, Canadians were divided. Francophones insisted on neutrality, as did some <b>top</b> <b>advisers</b> like Oscar D. Skelton. Imperialists stood behind Britain and were willing to fight Germany. King, who served as his own {{secretary}} of state for external affairs (foreign minister), said privately that if he had to choose he would not be neutral, but he made no public statement. All of Canada was relieved that the British appeasement at Munich, while sacrificing the rights of Czechoslovakia, seemed to bring peace.|$|E
25|$|Napoleon's defeat {{was also}} {{somewhat}} mirrored by Hitler's failed invasion of Russia during World War II in 1941. Although, ironically, Hitler had studied Napoleon's battle tactics, he decided, against {{the advice of}} many of his <b>top</b> <b>advisers,</b> to invade Russia and break his pact with Stalin. He knew the invasion would have only one chance and if he failed, he would be fighting a war on two fronts (the Western Front consisting of the Western Allies and the Eastern Front which would consist of the Soviet Union) which also proved fatal in Napoleon's situation. In 1812, Napoleon had been campaigning in Spain as well as Russia and had failed in both. In 1941, Hitler had to split his army in order to conquer Russia and in doing so, perhaps lost the war solely on that point. After Stalin found out what had happened, he orchestrated the Battle of Moscow which, along with the notoriously cold Russian winter, stopped the German troops and finally pushed them back. Hitler would now be fighting on two fronts.|$|E

25|$|In 1924, the New York City Board of Transportation {{was created}} by the New York City Board of Estimate {{following}} a bill passed by New York State Legislature. The Board of Transportation would responsible for mapping and constructing new rapid transit lines, carrying out the powers dictated in the 1891 Rapid Transit Act, while the State Transit Commission would continue to oversee the privately-operated systems. The bill had been deadlocked in the State Assembly for two years until a compromise bill was introduced in February 1924 and passed on April 11 of that year. Governor Smith signed the bill into law on May 2, and the BOT assumed power on June 1. The board's first chairman was John Hanlon Delaney, one of Hylan's <b>top</b> <b>advisers</b> who had been the transit construction commissioner since 1919. The BOT would release the initial plans for what would become the Independent Subway System (IND) on December 9, 1924, based largely off of Mayor Hylan's plans. The first IND subway line and the system's trunk line, the IND Eighth Avenue Line, broke ground on March 14, 1925, and was opened on September 10, 1932. On August 29, 1929, the BOT released its first major plans for the expansion of the city-owned system still under construction. A revision of this proposal was released almost ten years later on July 5, 1939. These plans would later be called the IND Second System, and would go largely unbuilt due to the Great Depression and World War II.|$|E

[...] But the Church Committee had full authority to call a hearing and require Colby's testimony. Ford and his <b>top</b> <b>advisers</b> met with Colby to prepare him for the hearing. Colby testified, [...] "These last two months have placed American intelligence in danger. The almost hysterical excitement surrounding any news story mentioning CIA or referring even to a perfectly legitimate activity of CIA has raised a question whether secret intelligence operations can be conducted by the United States." ...|$|E

2500|$|Kennedy {{met with}} members of EXCOMM and other <b>top</b> <b>advisers</b> {{throughout}} October 21, considering two remaining options: an air strike primarily against the Cuban missile bases or a naval blockade of Cuba. A full-scale invasion was not the administration's first option. McNamara supported the naval blockade as a strong but limited military action that left the US in control. However, the term [...] "blockade" [...] was problematic. According to international law, a blockade {{is an act of}} war, but the Kennedy administration did not think that the Soviets would be provoked to attack by a mere blockade. Additionally, legal experts at the State Department and Justice Department concluded that a declaration of war could be avoided if another legal justification, based on the Rio Treaty for defense of the Western Hemisphere, was obtained from a resolution by a two-thirds vote from the members or the Organization of American States (OAS).|$|E
