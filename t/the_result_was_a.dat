5|$|As {{his second}} {{administration}} began, disaster hit the nation when the Panic of 1893 produced a severe national depression, which Cleveland {{was unable to}} reverse. It ruined his Democratic Party, opening {{the way for a}} Republican landslide in 1894 and for the agrarian and silverite seizure of the Democratic Party in 1896. <b>The</b> <b>result</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> political realignment that ended the Third Party System and launched the Fourth Party System and the Progressive Era.|$|E

5|$|Between Operations Trident and Python, and the Indian Air Force {{attacks on}} Karachi's fuel and {{ammunition}} depots, {{more than fifty}} percent of the total fuel requirement of the Karachi zone was reported to have been destroyed. <b>The</b> <b>result</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> crippling economic blow to Pakistan. The damage was estimated to be worth $3billion, with most of the oil reserves and ammunition warehouses and workshops destroyed. The Pakistan Air Force was also affected by the loss of fuel.|$|E
5|$|Blaine and Harrison {{wished to}} see American power and trade {{expanded}} across the Pacific and were {{especially interested in}} securing rights to harbors in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, and Pago Pago, Samoa. When Blaine entered office, the United States, Great Britain, and the German Empire were disputing their respective rights in Samoa. Thomas F. Bayard, Blaine’s predecessor, had accepted {{an invitation to a}} three-party conference in Berlin aimed at resolving the dispute, and Blaine appointed American representatives to attend. <b>The</b> <b>result</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> treaty that created a condominium among the three powers, allowing all of them access to the harbor.|$|E
5|$|In 2016 a {{breakthrough}} in creating a strong light aluminium steel alloy which might be suitable in applications such as aircraft was announced by researchers at Pohang University of Science and Technology. Adding small amounts of nickel was found to result in precipitation as nano particles of brittle B2 intermetallic compounds which had previously resulted in weakness. <b>The</b> <b>result</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> cheap strong light steel alloy—nearly as strong as titanium at 10% of the cost—which is slated for trial production at industrial scale by POSCO, a Korean steelmaker.|$|E
25|$|Zero {{intensity}} {{for each}} component gives the darkest color (no light, considered the black), and full intensity of each gives a white; {{the quality of}} this white depends {{on the nature of}} the primary light sources, but if they <b>are</b> properly balanced, <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> neutral white matching the system's white point. When the intensities for all the components <b>are</b> <b>the</b> same, <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> shade of gray, darker or lighter depending on the intensity. When the intensities <b>are</b> different, <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> colorized hue, more or less saturated depending on the difference of the strongest and weakest of the intensities of the primary colors employed.|$|R

5|$|Special {{consideration}} {{was given}} during filming {{to allow for}} integration of the planned special effects. Television monitors standing in for computer displays were specially calibrated so that their refresh rate {{did not result in}} banding on film. Due to a loss of resolution and quality resulting from rephotographing an element in an optical printer, live action sequences for effects were shot in 65mm or VistaVision formats to compensate. When the larger prints were reduced through an anamorphic lens on the printer, <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> Panavision composite.|$|E
5|$|Stanford won all its 1926 games, {{crushing}} California 41–7 and narrowly defeating USC 13–12. Warner's {{team was}} invited to the Rose Bowl to play Alabama. Like the game against the Fighting Irish, Stanford dominated but <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> 7–7 tie. After the game, both teams were recognized as national champions {{by a number of}} publications.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of the Standard, as the {{encounter}} {{came to be}} called, was a defeat for the Scots. Afterwards, David and his surviving notables retired to Carlisle. Although <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> defeat, it was {{not by any means}} decisive. David retained the bulk of his army and thus the power to go on the offensive again. The siege of Wark, for instance, which had been going on since January, continued until it was captured in November. David continued to occupy Cumberland as well as much of Northumberland.|$|E

5|$|The first {{parliamentary}} elections after independence were held on 27 February and 8 March 1958. <b>The</b> <b>result</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> victory for Abd al-Rahman's Umma Party, which won 63 of the 173 seats. The Southern Sudan Federal Party {{competed in the}} election, and won 40 of the 46 seats allocated to the southern provinces. The Federal party platform represented a serious challenge to the authorities. However, {{when it became clear}} that the party's demands for a federal structure would be ignored by the Constituent Assembly, on 16 June 1958 the southern MPs left parliament.|$|E
5|$|The {{participants}} were vessels of the U.S. Navy's North Atlantic Blockading Squadron opposed by vessels of the Confederate Navy's Mosquito Fleet; {{the latter were}} supported by a shore-based battery of four guns at Cobb's Point (now called Cobb Point) near the southeastern border of the town. The battle {{was a part of}} the campaign in North Carolina that was led by Burnside and known as the Burnside Expedition. <b>The</b> <b>result</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> Union victory, with Elizabeth City and its nearby waters in their possession and the Confederate fleet captured, sunk, or dispersed.|$|E
5|$|There were problems. Inflated bomb damage {{assessment}} reports during operations in northeastern Laos were common, but {{the cause was}} not difficult to discern. Mountainous terrain, poor weather, ground cover, the lack of ground forces for confirmation, and the language barrier all contributed to overestimation of the damage inflicted on communist forces by the bombing effort. <b>The</b> <b>result</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> skewed sense of the effectiveness and {{the capabilities of the}} campaign. The results of the campaign (which were made obvious by the repeating seasonal nature of PAVN and Pathet Lao offensives), however, indicated that American airpower was quite effective.|$|E

5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the Middle Ages, the {{functions}} and composition of households started to change. This was due primarily to two factors. First of all, the introduction of gunpowder to the field of warfare rendered the castle a less effective defence, and did away with the military function of the household. <b>The</b> <b>result</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> household more focused on comfort and luxury, and with a significantly larger proportion of women.|$|E
5|$|Under Campbell Authentic {{improved}} somewhat, {{and continued}} its metamorphosis into a magazine, with additional non-fiction writing, and short fiction {{in addition to}} the main novel in each issue. Hamilton also ran a science fiction paperback imprint, Panther Books, which would go on {{to become one of the}} leading British sf houses. By 1953 the British sf market was going through a metamorphosis similar to the one going in the US at the same time: poor quality sf markets were failing, and <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> reduced but active market, with four magazines: Authentic, New Worlds, Science Fantasy, and Nebula Science Fiction.|$|E
5|$|Where {{the shot}} is {{tracking}} with Superman as he flies (such {{as in the}} Superman and Lois Metropolis flying sequence), front projection was used. This involved photographing the actors suspended {{in front of a}} background image dimly projected from the front onto a special screen made by 3M that would reflect light back at many times the original intensity directly into a combined camera/projector. <b>The</b> <b>result</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> very clear and intense photographic reproduction of both the actors and the background plate, with far less image deterioration or lighting problems than occur with rear projection.|$|E

5|$|Ionic {{compounds}} containing hydrogen ions (H+) {{are classified}} as acids, and those containing electropositive cations and basic anions ions hydroxide (OH−) or oxide (O2−) {{are classified as}} bases. Other ionic compounds are known as salts and can be formed by acid–base reactions. If <b>the</b> compound <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of <b>a</b> reaction between a strong acid and <b>a</b> weak base, <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> acidic salt. If it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of <b>a</b> reaction between a strong base and <b>a</b> weak acid, <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> basic salt. If it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of <b>a</b> reaction between a strong acid and <b>a</b> strong base, <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> neutral salt. Weak acids reacted with weak bases can produce ionic compounds with both the conjugate base ion and conjugate acid ion, such as ammonium acetate.|$|R
5|$|A silver boom {{occurred}} in England after {{the discovery of}} silver near Carlisle in 1133. Huge quantities of silver were produced from a semicircle of mines reaching across Cumberland, Durham and Northumberland – up to three to four tonnes of silver were mined each year, more than ten times the previous annual production across the whole of Europe. <b>The</b> <b>result</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> local economic boom and a major uplift to 12th-century royal finances. Tin mining was centred in Cornwall and Devon, exploiting alluvial deposits and governed by the special Stannary Courts and Parliaments. Tin formed a valuable export good, initially to Germany and then later in the 14th century to the Low Countries. Lead was usually mined as a by-product of mining for silver, with mines in Yorkshire, Durham and the north, {{as well as in}} Devon. Economically fragile, the lead mines usually survived as a result of being subsidised by silver production.|$|E
5|$|Although {{it gained}} recruits, the rising began {{to suffer from}} {{internal}} divisions, particularly between the Highlanders who made {{up the bulk of}} the forces and the Lowland nobles and officers who were their commanders. In early 1654, nine months into the revolt, Middleton, a Lowland officer and a veteran of the Battle of Worcester, arrived with a commission to command from Charles II. Despite objections from his followers, Glencairn surrendered control over his forces, which had now reached 3,500 foot and 1,500 horse. That evening Sir George Munro, Middleton's aide insulted Glencairn's forces and <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> duel in which Munro was wounded. Glencairn was arrested. He would eventually be released and retire from the conflict. A series of other disputes and duels undermined the leadership of the campaign {{for the remainder of the}} rising.|$|E
5|$|Baltimore was far {{and away}} the most {{successful}} of any American CFL team on the field and off, averaging crowds of over 37,000 their first year. Knowing that Canadian football was considerably different from the American game, Speros stocked the Stallions mostly with CFL veterans. As coach, he brought in Don Matthews, who had already played in two Grey Cups and won one. <b>The</b> <b>result</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> team that eventually finished second in the East with a 12–6 record and became the first American team to qualify for the playoffs. They advanced {{all the way to the}} Grey Cup. In a thrilling match played in BC Place, the BC Lions defeated the Stallions on a last second field goal. Perhaps most remarkably, they were reported to have turned a profit in their first year after an initial US$7 million investment by Speros.|$|E
