Sometime after this, she met the witch-priestess, Ainet, who <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> and became her surrogate mother. Once, when their village {{was going through a}} terrible drought, Storm commanded rain for days just to help them. By doing this, she threw off the natural order of nature, and droughts were formed over numerous villages, and hundreds of animals were killed. Sensing the damage she had done, Ainet told Storm of her kind but ill-thought-out gesture, and of the damage she caused. Ainet took this opportunity to explain to Ororo how her powers worked with nature, and how she could fix the problem by properly distributing rain.|$|E

25|$|Demeter's {{search for}} her {{daughter}} Persephone {{took her to the}} palace of Celeus, the King of Eleusis in Attica. She assumed the form of an old woman, and asked him for shelter. He <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>in,</b> to nurse Demophon and Triptolemus, his sons by Metanira. To reward his kindness, she planned to make Demophon immortal; she secretly anointed the boy with ambrosia and laid him in the flames of the hearth, to gradually burn away his mortal self. But Metanira walked in, saw her son in the fire and screamed in fright. Demeter abandoned the attempt. Instead, she taught Triptolemus the secrets of agriculture, and he in turn taught them to any who wished to learn them. Thus, humanity learned how to plant, grow and harvest grain. The myth has several versions; some are linked to figures such as Eleusis, Rarus and Trochilus. The Demophon element may be based on an earlier folk tale.|$|E
