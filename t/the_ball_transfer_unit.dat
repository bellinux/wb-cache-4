50|$|They are {{commonly}} used in an inverted ball up position where objects are quickly moved across an array of units, known as a ball transfer table, a type of conveyor system. This permits manual transfer to and from machines and between different sections of another conveyor system. They are used in airports for luggage delivery, or in industry as part of manufacturing systems. Prior to the invention of <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>unit,</b> first patented by Autoset Production Ltd in 1958, these applications were solved {{by the use of}} inverted casters. However, casters recognise a trail, meaning that the wheels had to align before directional change could be achieved.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> {{component}} called <b>Ball</b> <b>Transfer</b> <b>Unit</b> {{is often}} used in the conveyor belt system for the automatic and rapid transport of luggage within the airport handling systems. The analysed component is a bearing in which a largest ball rotates over a belt of other small balls. Some of these components grip, but only the ones present in one airport near the seaside. The aim of the present examination {{is focused on the}} reliable identification of the causes which have produced the loss of the rotational attitude which represents the main functional property of this mechanical bearing component. Visual inspection, microscopic analysis (optical and SEM) and computational simulation have been carried out to understand the failure mechanism. In particular the computational analysis permits to calculate the stress state and the deformation induced on the bearing. In a first time the damage has been attributed on the different and often not regular depth of the carburised and hardened layer supporting the belt of <b>the</b> little <b>ball.</b> This irregularity seems to produce an excessive deformation of the supporting body and the consequent detachment of the zinc coating. The presence of debris in the bearing component seems to be the element which deteriorates the rotation of <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> involved in <b>the</b> system. On the other hand, the performed study has revealed that the cause of the disease is not the irregularity of the depth of the hardened layer, but the presence of an abrasive body composed by SiO 2, CaO and Al 2 O 3 of exogenous origin which can start up a wear mechanism...|$|R

40|$|Purpose. Justification of optimum heat {{treatment}} of <b>ball</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>unit</b> body {{was developed and}} patented by "Victoria Ltd. " (Ukraine). These modes of {{heat treatment}} had to assure the maximum carrying capacity of <b>ball</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>unit</b> {{and its ability to}} withstand the load impact with given impact energy. Also the state of unit operability was investigated subject to applied static loading. Design/methodology/approach. The special experimental equipment was designed and manufactured for research. It allowed to simulate the real working conditions of <b>ball</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>unit</b> during <b>the</b> experiments. Entire test cycle was divided into three phases. Initially the units were subjected to impact loading with falling weight under increasing impact energy up to destruction of a body. The influence of steel body hardness on unit dynamic strength was estimated. Then samples of <b>ball</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>units</b> were loaded with static forces applied to central ball. Maximum failure load was determined and real safety factors were calculated subject to body hardness. Also unit operability at maximum load was investigated. It was estimated by possibility of full twisting central <b>ball</b> in <b>the</b> unit body. Findings. Optimum regimes of hardening of the body and the actual ultimate load safety factor at the normal loading of the unit were defined. Originality. New results on structural strength of <b>ball</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>unit</b> with steel punching body were obtained. ???????????? ?????????? ????????????????? ???????????? ??????????????? ????????? ? ????????????????? ???? ????????? ?????????? ??????????? ???????????? ???

50|$|For a {{sequence}} of same-weight elastic objects constrained to a straight path, the effect continues to each successive object. For example, when two balls are dropped to strike three stationary balls in a cradle, there is an unnoticed but crucial small distance between <b>the</b> two dropped <b>balls</b> and <b>the</b> action is as follows: <b>The</b> first moving <b>ball</b> that strikes <b>the</b> first stationary <b>ball</b> (<b>the</b> 2nd <b>ball</b> striking <b>the</b> 3rd <b>ball)</b> <b>transfers</b> all its velocity to <b>the</b> 3rd <b>ball</b> and stops. <b>The</b> 3rd <b>ball</b> then <b>transfers</b> <b>the</b> velocity to <b>the</b> 4th <b>ball</b> and stops, and then the 4th to <b>the</b> 5th <b>ball.</b> Right behind this sequence is <b>the</b> 1st <b>ball</b> <b>transferring</b> its velocity to <b>the</b> 2nd <b>ball</b> that had just been stopped, and the sequence repeats immediately and imperceptibly behind the first sequence, ejecting <b>the</b> 4th <b>ball</b> right behind <b>the</b> 5th <b>ball</b> with <b>the</b> same small separation that was between the two initial striking balls.

50|$|A {{traditional}} lock pick uses trial-and-error {{methods to}} find the correct alignment of the locking pins. The snap gun uses a primary law of physics, the transfer of energy, to momentarily burst all of the driver pins out of the lock cylinder without sending the bottom pins up into it.

The bottom pins transfer their kinetic energy to the top pins and come to a complete stop without penetrating the lock housing. The driver pins are {{thrown out of the}} cylinder body entirely up into the lock housing. Until the springs force the driver pins back into the cylinder, the lock cylinder is momentarily unobstructed.
