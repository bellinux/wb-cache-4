5|$|In June 2014, {{the chief}} {{executive}} of UBS Belgium, Marcel Brühwiler, was arrested on suspicion of fraud, while UBS' offices and Brühwiler's residence were searched by police. It is alleged that UBS Belgium actively recruited rich Belgians, proposing <b>to</b> <b>funnel</b> funds to secret Swiss accounts, enabling tax avoidance.|$|E
5|$|In December 1919, Meyszner {{was placed}} {{in charge of the}} border {{gendarmerie}} at the Styrian town of Judenburg, on the frontier with the newly created Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later Yugoslavia), and was involved in fighting there. That year, he had become involved with the German-nationalist sporting association Deutsch-Völkischen Turnvereins and was made a leader in the right-wing paramilitary Steirischen Heimatschutz (Styrian Home Guard). He later used his senior position in the gendarmerie <b>to</b> <b>funnel</b> arms to the Home Guard.|$|E
5|$|Munro also {{reported}} that, at the time, Rùm was highly forested, with {{an abundance of}} deer. Munro goes on to argue that the best way of slaying the deer would be when they are moving uphill (when gravity is against them), their principle home being in the heights. Contemporary with Munro, substantial stone walls were built in the glens <b>to</b> <b>funnel</b> deer into pens.|$|E

5|$|The Spanish army, led by Francisco Verdugo, with Lieutenant-Colonel Johann Baptista von Taxis {{as second}} in command, was {{deployed}} before {{the village of}} Noordhorn and behind broken ground with only one access point that was covered by a wide ravine and flanked on its left {{by a series of}} muddy ditches. Aiming to create a trap for Norreys' army, the Spanish had smoothed the ground on their right in order <b>to</b> <b>funnel</b> English units and draw Norrey's troops into an engagement area where a crossfire effect could be created. Verdugo himself drove two stakes into the ground to mark the point that his cavalry was to charge upon the English vanguard.|$|E
5|$|Following her election, Collins {{donated the}} surplus $242,000 from her {{campaign}} coffers {{to the state}} Democratic Party. When Collins' husband was named state treasurer for the party– at an annual salary of $59,900– the state press charged that the move was a plot <b>to</b> <b>funnel</b> Collins' campaign funds into her personal account. (The previous Democratic state treasurer had received no salary during his tenure.) Following the media criticism, Dr. Collins resigned his post as treasurer. All of the involved individuals insisted that Governor Collins had not been briefed {{on the details of}} her husband's appointment. The media's criticism of Collins continued as many of the appointments to her executive cabinet went to what they characterized as inexperienced personnel who had held key positions in her past campaigns. When newly appointed Insurance Commissioner Gilbert McCarty approved a 17% rate increase requested by Blue Cross Blue Shield– a request that his predecessor had denied a few days earlier– Collins quickly countermanded the approval pending a public hearing on the matter.|$|E
5|$|Pohlmann struck {{camp and}} {{deployed}} his infantry battalions {{in a line}} facing southwards behind the steep banks of the Kailna with his cannon arrayed directly in front. The great mass of Maratha cavalry was kept on the right flank and Berar's irregular infantry garrisoned Assaye to the rear. The only observable crossing point over the river was a small ford directly ahead of the Maratha position. Pohlmann's strategy was <b>to</b> <b>funnel</b> the British and Madras troops across the ford {{into the mouth of}} his cannon, and then on to the massed infantry and cavalry behind. Wellesley's local guides assured him that no other ford existed nearby, but he quickly discarded the option of a frontal assault as suicide. While reconnoitring he had noticed two unguarded villages, Peepulgaon and Waroor, one on each bank of the Kaitna beyond the Maratha left. On the assumption that a ford must exist between the two villages, Wellesley ordered the area to be further reconnoitred by his Chief Engineer, Captain John Johnson, who reported that there was indeed a ford at that spot. Thus Wellesley led his army east to the crossing in an attempt to launch an attack on Pohlmann's left flank.|$|E

5|$|The ROK 1st Infantry Division, with 7,500 men {{had held}} the line around the Bowling Alley since August 12. The Bowling Alley area was {{selected}} because of its advantageous high ground which provided natural barriers <b>to</b> <b>funnel</b> North Korean troops into smaller fronts where South Korean defenses could attack them from the high ground in concealed positions. In the meantime, the KPA 3rd, 13th, and 15th Divisions were advancing south and preparing to close on Taegu. The KPA 13th Division converged on the Tabu-dong corridor and a vicious melee ensued between the North and South Korean troops, with ROK 1st Division's 11th, 12th, and 13th regiments committed against the KPA 13th Division's 19th, 21st and 23rd regiments. The fight became a battle of attrition. As the two sides closed on one another, the battle took a brutal turn by August 15 as supplies ran low and units were locked in close quarters combat with little ammunition for the weapons. Fighting across the entire front became hand-to-hand combat and grenade fights at close range. The two divisions were so evenly matched that neither could make any appreciable gains for days of fighting and huge numbers of casualties.|$|E
25|$|After the rebellion, King Sigismund {{attempted}} <b>to</b> <b>funnel</b> {{the restless}} {{energy of the}} nobles into external wars. This, combined with other factors, led to the official Commonwealth involvement in the Polish–Muscovite War (1609–1618), which followed the Dimitriads (1605–1609).|$|E

2500|$|Twelve [...] (睦月, [...] "First Moon") {{ships were}} {{commissioned}} between November 1925 and July 1927. They were {{developed from the}} Kamikaze class and introduced the new 24 in (61cm) Type 93 torpedo. These were in triple mounts, allowing the reduction of torpedo placements from three to two. Half of the class were rebuilt in 1935–36, receiving shields to the torpedo tubes, strengthened hulls and modifications <b>to</b> <b>funnels.</b> Further changes occurred in 1941–1942 when many were converted to fast transports, with reduced gunnery.|$|R

25|$|With the ministerial scandals neutralised and the State Plan launched, one of Labor's few {{remaining}} worries {{for the election}} was {{the completion of the}} new Lane Cove Tunnel. Labor feared that the tunnel could prove every bit as problematic as the controversial Cross City Tunnel.

25|$|In {{an effort}} to {{manually}} control the flow of PageRank among pages within a website, many webmasters practice {{what is known as}} PageRank Sculpting—which is the act of strategically placing the nofollow attribute on certain internal links of a website in order <b>to</b> <b>funnel</b> PageRank towards those pages the webmaster deemed most important. This tactic has been used since the inception of the nofollow attribute, but may no longer be effective since Google announced that blocking PageRank transfer with nofollow does not redirect that PageRank to other links.|$|E
25|$|Following their Kelly Cup victory, ECHL {{management}} {{accused the}} franchise of circumventing the league's salary cap by colluding {{with the city}} of North Charleston <b>to</b> <b>funnel</b> money through a city-run youth hockey program to provide payouts to players. After two months of investigation by the league, the Stingrays were assessed a US$50,000 fine, and Vaive was suspended for the first six games of the 199798 season. The Internal Revenue Service determined that no state or federal tax laws were broken, but the incident sparked a re-evaluation by the ECHL of the teams' salary caps.|$|E
50|$|Funnels are {{essentially}} funnel-shaped drone units {{that are designed}} to be remotely controlled by a Newtype pilot. It is equipped with a small beam cannon, and an energy cell <b>to</b> propel the <b>funnel</b> when it is operating. A Newtype pilot is able <b>to</b> control these <b>funnels</b> with great precision via a psycommu system, allowing him/her to conduct BVR attacks on a target from almost all directions without having to establish visual contact, making a funnel-equipped mobile suit extremely deadly. When the funnels are not in use, they are attached to the mother suit's surface hardpoints for recharging. All Zeon funnel-equipped units have the ability <b>to</b> recharge <b>funnels</b> but the Earth Federation Forces were very slow in adopting the technology.|$|R

25|$|The federal Auditor General's report {{released}} publicly on February 10, 2004, showed {{what appeared to}} be a criminal misdirection of government funds intended for advertising to key Quebec-based supporters of the Liberal Party of Canada. (See sponsorship scandal.) Included in the Auditor General's report was the fact that Via Rail was used as one of several federal government departments, agencies, and Crown corporations <b>to</b> <b>funnel</b> these illicit funds. Forced to act on the Auditor General's report due to its political implications, Prime Minister Paul Martin's government suspended Via Rail President Marc LeFrançois on February 24, 2004, giving him an ultimatum of several days to defend himself against allegations in the report or face further disciplinary action.|$|E
25|$|Albania became {{dependent}} on Soviet aid and know-how after it broke with Yugoslavia in 1948. In February 1949, Albania gained {{membership in the}} communist bloc's organization for coordinating economic planning, the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (Comecon). Tirana soon entered into trade agreements with Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, and the Soviet Union. Soviet and East European technical advisers took up residence in Albania, and the Soviet Union also sent Albania military advisers and built a submarine installation on Sazan Island. After the Soviet-Yugoslav split, Albania and Bulgaria remained the only countries that the Soviet Union could use <b>to</b> <b>funnel</b> war material to the communists fighting in Greece. What little strategic value Albania offered the Soviet Union, however, gradually shrank as nuclear-arms technology developed.|$|E
25|$|Around 9:10p.m., power {{failed in}} the building, {{extinguishing}} the lights. Panic ensued, and even {{those who had been}} calmly moving toward exits in the Cabaret Room began to push and shove each other. The situation was made worse by the fact that of the three exits in the room, two were quickly blocked off by the fire, leaving the crowd <b>to</b> <b>funnel</b> through a single exit. Employees outside the exits attempted to pull guests to safety, but the crush of bodies as those behind pushed upon those in front became so solid that no amount of strength could free most of them. Many of those who escaped the crush blocking the northeast fire exit became lost trying to find other exits. Twists and turns in building design which led to a set of doors opening into a bar area funneled some into a dead end.|$|E

25|$|The U.S. Justice Department (DOJ) and Senate Permanent Committee on Investigations {{started to}} examine the {{finances}} of the Obiang family in 2004. The Senate committee found that Teodorin Obiang had utilized shell corporations to circumvent anti money-laundering laws <b>to</b> <b>funnel</b> more than $100 million into United States financial institutions and that Riggs Bank in Washington, D.C., had opened several accounts for Obiang and helped him sequester his wealth in offshore shell corporations. The bank was eventually fined for these actions and for similar dealings on behalf of Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet. The Senate committee concluded, moreover, that Riggs Bank had ignored evidence suggesting they had handled the proceeds of corrupt foreign practices. After the U.S. fined Riggs Bank for its dealings with Obiang, the bank was allowed to keep his account open, although the funds were transferred shortly thereafter to accounts in Banco Santander and other institutions {{in the name of}} Kalumga Company.|$|E
25|$|The Escort quest is a {{combination}} of slaying monsters to maintain the well-being of a non-player character (NPC), while exploring an area alongside that NPC. A typical escort quest would involve protecting a character as he or she moves through a monster-infested area. A majority of the time, the quest will demand the player to slay multiple monsters {{to ensure the safety of}} the NPC. Escort quests can be beneficial, forcing the player's to focus on a particular area, in order to play out a scene or reveal a section of the plot. Escort quests can also be used <b>to</b> <b>funnel</b> a character from one location to another, leading the player along a route or path. However, problems with this type of quest can occur if the artificial intelligence controlling the NPC causes the NPC to behave in unexpected or unmanageable ways. Because many escort quests are often perceived as being done wrong, they are very unpopular amongst the gaming community.|$|E
25|$|While {{running for}} reelection in 2008, Coleman was {{mentioned}} in a Texas lawsuit by Paul McKim, CEO of Deep Marine Technology (DMT), against Nasser Kazeminy. Kazeminy was a longtime Coleman supporter who owned a controlling share of DMT. The petition alleged that Kazeminy used DMT <b>to</b> <b>funnel</b> $75,000 or more to Laurie Coleman through her employer, Hays Companies, in order to enrich Senator Coleman. McKim's petition covered several issues, of which the Coleman matter was only one. Coleman's 2009 Senate financial disclosure form disclosed that Laurie Coleman received a salary from Hays Companies, but Senate rules do not require the salary amount to be revealed. Neither Coleman nor his wife were named as defendants in the suit. On October 31, a related suit was filed in Delaware Chancery Court by minority shareholders in DMT. The Delaware suit also alleged that DMT {{was used as a}} conduit for unearned funds to Laurie Coleman through Hays Companies, at Kazeminy's behest. As in the Texas case, the Colemans were not named as defendants, and Coleman was not charged with any ethical or legal wrongdoing.|$|E
