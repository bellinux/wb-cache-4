5|$|Almost every silver siliqua in the hoard has had {{its edge}} clipped to some degree. This is typical of Roman silver coin finds of this period in Britain, {{although}} clipped coins are very unusual <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Roman Empire. The clipping process invariably leaves the imperial portrait {{on the front of}} the coin intact, but often damages the mint mark, inscription, and the image on the obverse.|$|E

5|$|In January 1918, Friedrich Schlosser {{replaced}} von Trapp {{as commander}} of U-14. Schlosser was, in turn, replaced in June by Hugo Pistel, {{who remained in}} command {{until the end of}} the war. Neither of the later commanders was able to duplicate von Trapp's success in U-14; the U-boat sank no more ships <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war.|$|E

After the collimator, a high-pass filter blocks {{almost half of the}} incoming light (that of too long a wavelength).

5|$|<b>Through</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1970s, other {{possible}} designs were looked at but never implemented, while preliminary {{work on the}} construction site resumed. On April 29, 1979, the foundations for the Auburn Dam were completed. However, debates continued over whether to build an arched or straight-axis gravity dam. Some favored the latter design {{because it would have}} greater mass, allowing it to better withstand earthquakes.|$|E

5|$|Allosteric {{sites are}} pockets on the enzyme, {{distinct}} from the active site, that bind to molecules in the cellular environment. These molecules then cause {{a change in the}} conformation or dynamics of the enzyme that is transduced to the active site and thus affects the reaction rate of the enzyme. In this way, allosteric interactions can either inhibit or activate enzymes. Allosteric interactions with metabolites upstream or downstream in an enzyme's metabolic pathway cause feedback regulation, altering the activity of the enzyme according to the flux <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pathway.|$|E

5|$|In 1954, Tammany Hall boss Carmine DeSapio led {{the effort}} to defeat Eleanor's son, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Jr., in the {{election}} for New York Attorney General. Eleanor grew increasingly disgusted with DeSapio's political conduct <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1950s. Eventually, she would join with her old friends Herbert Lehman and Thomas Finletter to form the New York Committee for Democratic Voters, a group dedicated to opposing DeSapio's reincarnated Tammany Hall. Their efforts were eventually successful, and DeSapio was forced to relinquish power in 1961.|$|E

Heather Nedohin held a slight lead over Margaretha Sigfridsson, who tried {{to win the game}} in the final end but fell short and tied the game. Jennifer Jones and Mirjam Ott played a back-and-forth game which saw Ott miss a double-takeout attempt for the win, allowing Jones to steal the point.

FIBT spokesman Don Krone also stated that it was common that turn profiles were changed when it was being used by other sliding disciplines such as luge and skeleton.|$|E

He enjoyed the WWF World Heavyweight Championship match, although he was disappointed by its lack of buildup prior to the event. He also felt that the Flair/Ramon vs. Savage/Perfect match {{was a good one}} until the ending got out of control. Pro Wrestling Torch columnist agreed, stating that the WWF World Heavyweight Championship match was the best and that the Flair/Ramon vs. Savage/Perfect bout was also enjoyable, but he recommended fast-forwarding <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> show.|$|E

5|$|As {{a part of}} an army-wide reorganization, the division's brigade {{headquarters}} were disbanded {{in favor}} of regimental commands. The division was instead based around three infantry regiments; the 101st, 104th, and the 328th. Also assigned to the division were the 101st, 102nd, 180th, and 263rd Field Artillery Battalions, the 39th Signal Company, the 726th Ordnance Company, the 26th Quartermaster Company, the 26th Reconnaissance Troop, the 101st Engineer Combat Battalion, and the 114th Medical Battalion. In August 1943 Major General Willard Stewart Paul took command of the division, which he would lead <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war. Before deploying overseas to the European Theater of Operations (ETO), the 26th ID trained at Camp Campbell, Kentucky and prepared to depart for the Western Front in late August 1944.|$|E

It angles southeasterly toward Albion before returning to an easterly course {{on the north side}} of town. I-94 crosses into western Jackson County before intersecting M-99. From there, it runs generally due east with a jog around Parma. West of the county airport, the Jackson business loop follows M-60 southward, and I-94 travels through the north side of Jackson. North of downtown, US127 merges in from the north and runs concurrently with I-94 around the city. Southeast of the Michigan State Prison, US127 departs to the south, and I-94 continues eastward <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> county.|$|E
5|$|For {{the third}} {{successive}} tournament, Wales had {{missed out on}} qualification by a slender margin, having missed the 1982 World Cup on goal difference, and the 1984 European Championship by a single point. Despite this setback, which {{was followed by a}} 3â€“0 home defeat to Hungary in October, the team went <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> season with only one other defeat, against Canada in May 1986. There was also the sense of history repeating itself in that, just as in 1977, it was a controversial penalty decision that ended up costing them dearly. Despite this however, there was also a feeling that, given the group of players available to them, they would qualify for the next tournament. As it was, Wales failed to qualify for a major tournament until the 2016 European Championships.|$|E

5|$|Liukin {{competed in}} her first National Championships as a junior in 2002, {{at the age of}} 12 and a half. In {{contrast}} to her WOGA teammates Carly Patterson and Hollie Vise, who finished first and second, respectively, Liukin suffered a fall on the uneven bars that rendered her unable to finish the routine. She continued <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> competition and, despite the incomplete bars set, finished 15th, which landed her one of the final spots on the U.S. National Team. She was chosen to compete with the U.S. team at the 2002 Junior Pan American Championships, where she contributed to the team gold medal and placed second on the uneven bars and balance beam and in the all-around.|$|E
5|$|The end {{came first}} for Virginia. Because the {{blockade}} was unbroken, Norfolk was of little strategic {{use to the}} Confederacy, and preliminary plans were laid to move the ship up the James River to the vicinity of Richmond. Before adequate preparations could be made, the Confederate Army under Major General Benjamin Huger abandoned the city on May 9, without consulting anyone from the Navy. Virginias draft was too great to permit her to pass up the river, which had a depth of only , and then only under favorable circumstances. She was trapped and could only be captured or sunk by the Union Navy. Rather than allow either, Tatnall decided to destroy his own ship. He had her towed down to Craney Island in Portsmouth, where the gang were taken ashore, {{and then she was}} set afire. She burned <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day and most of the following night; shortly before dawn, the flames reached her magazine, and she blew up.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} the board game Monopoly {{can be traced back}} to the early 20th century. The {{earliest}} known version of Monopoly, known as The Landlord's Game, was designed by an American, Elizabeth Magie, and first patented in 1904 but existed as early as 1902. Magie, a follower of Henry George, originally intended The Landlord's Game to illustrate the economic consequences of Ricardo's Law of Economic rent and the Georgist concepts of economic privilege and land value taxation. A series of board games were developed from 1906 through the 1930s that involved the buying and selling of land and the development of that land. By 1933, a board game had been created much like the version of Monopoly sold by Parker Brothers and its related companies <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 20th century, and into the 21st. Several people, mostly in the Midwestern United States and near the East Coast, contributed to the game's design and evolution.|$|E
