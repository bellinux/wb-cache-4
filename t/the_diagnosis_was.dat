Samples of the tumor were sent anonymously to the Army Medical Museum. <b>The</b> <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> not a malignant cancer, but instead an epithelioma.|$|E
5|$|Though Wiggins did {{not give}} up hope {{for a return to}} baseball, he began to study the {{real-estate}} market after his suspension from the game. In the late 1980s, Wiggins began to suffer from health difficulties related to AIDS, though <b>the</b> <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> not publicly disclosed while he was alive. He was receiving deferred payments from his baseball career, and he began to make plans for the financial future of his children. He told one of his former teammates that he was getting into computer work. Gwynn said that he had seen Wiggins in the spring of 1990 and was struck by his visible weight loss.|$|E

5|$|Wigner Jenő Pál {{was born}} in Budapest, Austria-Hungary on November 17, 1902, to middle class Jewish parents, Elisabeth (Einhorn) and Anthony Wigner, a leather tanner. He had an older sister, Bertha, known as Biri, and a younger sister Margit, known as Manci, who later married British {{theoretical}} physicist Paul Dirac. He was home schooled by a professional teacher {{until the age of}} 9, when he started school at the third grade. During this period, Wigner developed an interest in mathematical problems. At the age of 11, Wigner contracted what his doctors believed to be tuberculosis. His parents sent him to live for six weeks in a sanatorium in the Austrian mountains, before the doctors concluded that <b>the</b> <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> mistaken.|$|E
5|$|The {{briefing}} {{process was}} repeated {{with a second}} group of 34 candidates a week later. Of the 69, six {{were found to be}} over the height limit, 15 were eliminated for other reasons, and 16 declined. This left NASA with 32 candidates. Since this was more than expected, NASA decided not to bother with the remaining 41 candidates, as 32 candidates seemed a more than adequate number from which to select 12 astronauts as planned. The degree of interest also indicated that far fewer would drop out during training than anticipated, which would result in training astronauts who would not be required to fly Project Mercury missions. It was therefore decided to cut the number of astronauts selected to just six. Then came a grueling series of physical and psychological tests at the Lovelace Clinic and the Wright Aerospace Medical Laboratory. Only one candidate, Jim Lovell, was eliminated on medical grounds at this stage, and <b>the</b> <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> later found to be in error; thirteen others were recommended with reservations. The director of the NASA Space Task Group, Robert R. Gilruth, found himself unable to select only six from the remaining eighteen, and ultimately seven were chosen.|$|E

25|$|The Dodgers {{suffered}} {{their first}} injury of 2010 when catcher Russell Martin pulled a groin muscle while stealing {{a base in}} the first spring training game. <b>The</b> <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> that he would miss 4–6 weeks, which would cause him to miss the rest of spring training {{and the start of}} the season. The Dodgers announced that rookie A. J. Ellis would get the bulk of the playing time in Martin's absence. However, Martin returned from his injury earlier than expected and was back in action before the spring training games ended. Relief pitcher Cory Wade also suffered a recurring of a shoulder injury and underwent arthroscopic surgery on March 17.|$|E
25|$|In 1997, Cash was {{diagnosed}} with the neurodegenerative disease Shy–Drager syndrome, a form of multiple system atrophy; according to biographer Robert Hilburn, the disease was originally misdiagnosed as Parkinson's disease, and Cash even announced to a concert audience that he had Parkinson's during a show in Flint, Michigan, on October 25, 1997, after he nearly collapsed on stage; soon after his diagnosis was changed to Shy–Drager and Cash was told he had approximately 18 months to live. <b>The</b> <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> later again altered to autonomic neuropathy associated with diabetes. The illness forced Cash to curtail his touring. He was hospitalized in 1998 with severe pneumonia, which damaged his lungs.|$|E
25|$|During 1968, Collins {{noticed that}} his legs were not working as they should, first during {{handball}} games, then as he walked down stairs, his knee would almost give way. His left leg also had unusual sensations when in hot and cold water. Reluctantly he sought medical advice and <b>the</b> <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> a cervical disc herniation, requiring two vertebrae to be fused together. The surgery was performed at Wilford Hall Hospital at Lackland Air Force Base, Texas, and he spent three months in a neck brace. It also removed Collins from the crew of Apollo 9 and moved Jim Lovell up to the prime crew. When the Apollo 8 mission was changed from a CSM/LM in Earth orbit, to a CSM-only flight around the Moon, both prime and backup crews for the Apollo 8 and Apollo 9 swapped places.|$|E

500|$|In {{the first}} episode of the fourth season, Burt gives Kurt an {{emotional}} sendoff when his son leaves for New York City. Burt travels to New York to surprise Kurt at Christmas in [...] "Glee, Actually", bringing Blaine with him, and the three spend Christmas together. During his visit, Burt reveals {{that he has been}} diagnosed with prostate cancer, but his chances of survival are very high as <b>the</b> <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> made early and treatment appears to have been successful. Several months later, his doctor confirms that he is cancer free. During the season finale, he is approached by Blaine who wants his permission to marry Kurt. Burt tells him that he while he does understand why he wants to get married, he believes that both Blaine and his son are too young to make that kind of step.|$|E
500|$|Kaczynski's lawyers, {{headed by}} Montana federal defender Michael Donahoe and Judy Clarke, {{attempted}} to enter an insanity defense {{to avoid the}} death penalty, but he rejected this plea. On January 8, 1998, he requested to dismiss his lawyers and hire Tony Serra as his counsel; Serra had agreed to not use an insanity defense and instead base a defense on Kaczynski's anti-technology views. This request was unsuccessful and Kaczynski subsequently {{tried to commit suicide}} by hanging on January 9. Several, though not all, forensic psychiatrists and psychologists who examined Kaczynski diagnosed him as suffering from paranoid schizophrenia. Forensic psychiatrist Park Dietz said Kaczynski was not psychotic but had a schizoid or schizotypal personality disorder. In his 2010 book Technological Slavery, Kaczynski said that two prison psychologists, who visited him frequently for four years, told him they saw no indication that he suffered from paranoid schizophrenia and <b>the</b> <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> [...] "ridiculous" [...] and a [...] "political diagnosis".|$|E
500|$|The family {{settled in}} a small house loaned to them by Princess George of Greece at Saint-Cloud, on the {{outskirts}} of Paris, where Princess Andrew helped in a charity shop for Greek refugees. She became deeply religious, and on 20 October 1928 entered the Greek Orthodox Church. That winter, she translated her husband's defence of his actions during the Greco-Turkish War into English. Soon afterward, she began claiming that she was receiving divine messages and that she had healing powers. In 1930, after suffering a severe nervous breakdown, Princess Andrew was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, first by Thomas Ross, a psychiatrist who specialised in shell-shock, and subsequently by Sir Maurice Craig, who treated the future King George VI before he had speech therapy. <b>The</b> <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> confirmed at Dr Ernst Simmel's sanatorium at Tegel, Berlin. She was forcibly removed from her family and placed in Dr Ludwig Binswanger's sanatorium in Kreuzlingen, Switzerland. It was a famous and well-respected institution with several celebrity patients, including Vaslav Nijinsky, the ballet dancer and choreographer, who was there {{at the same time as}} Princess Andrew. Binswanger also diagnosed schizophrenia. Both he and Simmel consulted Sigmund Freud who believed that the princess's delusions were the result of sexual frustration. He recommended [...] "X-raying her ovaries in order to kill off her libido." [...] Princess Andrew protested her sanity and repeatedly tried to leave the asylum.|$|E

500|$|On 3 November, Frederick and {{his entourage}} {{departed}} for San Remo. At San Remo two days later, on 5 November, Frederick entirely lost his voice and experienced severe pain throughout his throat. Upon examination, Dr. Hovell discovered a new growth under the left vocal cord; when the news reached William and the German government, it caused great consternation. The following day, Mackenzie issued a bulletin stating that while {{there was no immediate}} danger to the Crown Prince, his illness had [...] "unfortunately taken an unfavourable turn," [...] and that he had requested advice from other specialists, including the Austrian professor of laryngology Leopold Schrötter and Dr. Hermann Krause of Berlin. On 9 November, Schrötter and Krause diagnosed the new growth as malignant, and said it was unlikely Frederick could live another year. All the doctors in attendance, including Mackenzie, now concluded that Frederick's disease was indeed laryngeal cancer, as new lesions had appeared {{on the right side of}} the larynx, and that an immediate and total laryngectomy was required to save his life; Moritz Schmidt, one of the doctors, subsequently said that the earlier growths found in May had also been cancerous. Frederick was devastated by the news, bursting into tears upon being informed by Mackenzie and crying, [...] "To think I should have such a horrid disgusting illness ... I had so hoped to have been of use to my country. Why is Heaven so cruel to me? What have I done to be thus stricken and condemned?" [...] Even at this stage, however, Frederick, in a private discussion with his wife, decided against the laryngectomy as it was itself highly risky. He sent his doctors a written statement that he would remain in Italy and would only submit to a tracheotomy if he was at risk of suffocating due to his condition. The news was greeted with shock in Berlin and generated further hatred against Victoria, now seen as a domineering [...] "foreigner" [...] who was manipulating her husband. Some politicians suggested that Frederick be made to relinquish his position in the line of succession in favour of his son Wilhelm, but Bismarck firmly stated that Frederick would succeed his ailing father [...] "whether he is ill or not, [...] whether the K is then unable permanently to perform his duties," [...] would then be determined per the relevant provisions of the Prussian Constitution. [...] Despite the renewed diagnosis of cancer, Frederick's condition appeared to improve after 5 November, and he became more optimistic; through January 1888 there remained some hope that <b>the</b> <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> incorrect. Both Frederick and Victoria retained their faith in Mackenzie, who reexamined Frederick's throat several times in December and gave a good prognosis, again doubting whether the growths had been cancerous.|$|E
