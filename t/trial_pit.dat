50|$|The <b>trial</b> <b>pit</b> in Sir Thomas Stepney’s Study however told a very {{different}} story from the re-opened trial pits in the former Great Hall and the south-western range. This <b>trial</b> <b>pit</b> revealed that the under-floor material was a single fill deposit characterised by demolition material of small stones, mortar and soil. An interesting feature exposed in this preliminary <b>trial</b> <b>pit</b> was a narrow north to south aligned stone built cross wall, which was partly supporting the present floor joists. This <b>trial</b> <b>pit</b> reached a depth of approximately 3 ft. The fact that the fill of this <b>trial</b> <b>pit</b> was all one deposit, suggested that the floor level in this room had been raised only once and raised a considerable height.

50|$|In {{order to}} {{accommodate}} a concrete support base for the proposed display cabinet that is to hold the Stepney armorial dinner service, a large trench had to be excavated in {{the centre of the}} room, which offered archaeology the opportunity to evaluate the floor deposits below the 17th-century floor level more thoroughly than was possible for the already re-opened <b>trial</b> <b>pit</b> in this room. Excavations for this trench revealed that approximately 0.35 m below the 17th-century floor was an earlier floor level of compacted orange/buff coloured clay. This surface had been covered over with a loose demolition deposit of soil/sand, lime mortar and wall plaster, which in turn had been compacted with earth. Initially it was thought that this compacted clay floor was the natural clay, however a small <b>trial</b> <b>pit</b> was sunk through this deposit, which showed that the compacted clay floor was approximately 0.10 m thick and was covering a dark soil intermixed with irregular shaped stones. Luckily, positioning of the small <b>trial</b> <b>pit</b> happened to be positioned directly over a small post-hole, approximately 0.20 m in diameter and 0.30 m deep, filled with the same loose dark soil material.

50|$|While {{other areas}} of the South Wales {{coalfield}} had been exploited up to 50 years earlier, due to the scarcity and difficult access conditions of Rhondda Fach, it remained largely undeveloped. But the demand for steam coal drove development and, in 1874, Mordecai Jones of Brecon and Nantmelyn purchased the mineral rights around the farmhouse and its surrounding lands from the estate of the late Crawshay Bailey for £122,000.

40|$|Too often {{geophysical}} {{surveys of}} the near surface are a last resort. Direct sampling by trenching or <b>trial</b> <b>pits</b> is relatively cheap and gives a geologist or engineer a direct view of the target. Boreholes are a natural extension from <b>trial</b> <b>pits</b> since, although they sample in depth at only one point, they may recover physical samples of the material from the units under investigation. Geophysics is frequently regarded as useful {{in terms of being}} noninvasive, but lacking in resolution, and incapable of coping with complex near-surface materials. This presents a strange contradiction, since geophysical surveys are accepted as a good tool for archaeological surveys, where the main purpose is to identify inhomogeneity in the near surface with high resolution. Archaeogeophysical surveys are highly detailed, but slow and expensive.

A grammatical inference machine is a black box, which when presented with a sample of observations of some unknown source language, produces a grammar which is compatible with the sample. This article presents a heuristic model for a grammatical inference machine, which takes as data sentences and non-sentences identified as such, and is capable of inferring grammars in the class of context-free grammars expressed in Chomsky Normal Form. An algorithm and its corresponding software implementation have been developed based on this model.

40|$|Network Rail has {{recently}} acquired High Output Ballast Cleaners (HOBC) {{to increase the}} effectiveness and output of track renewals in the UK. One {{of the most important}} criteria to ensure efficient programming, correct application and utilisation of the HOBC plant is to accurately predict the volume of ballast returned to track and the subsequent amount of new ballast required for the renewal. Therefore, the rate of return of ballast to the track needs to be determined accurately prior to any renewal using HOBC. This paper presents an extensive site investigation to evaluate ballast return on a planned HOBC site. Current recommended site investigation methods to evaluate ballast return, utilising <b>trial</b> <b>pitting</b> and sub-sampling are discussed. It was considered that a more rigorous approach should be adopted to identify locations along the track that give a more representative sample for ballast return assessment. It was also noted that pitting and sub-sampling is time consuming and is subject to human error. Thus, Automatic Ballast Sampling (ABS) was conducted in addition to the more traditional methods of sample recovery in a closely monitored site investigation. The predicted ballast recovery results based on both the ABS and <b>trial</b> <b>pitting</b> are compared and discussed, and the relative merits of both techniques identified...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Landslides and {{roadside}} slope failures {{result in}} road blockage, damage and recurrent economic losses in most mountain {{regions of the}} world. The situation is often exacerbated in developing countries where existing engineering geological and geotechnical information is frequently limited or unavailable. Case examples from Bhutan and Ethiopia are used to highlight the value of engineering geological assessments applied to the rehabilitation of low-cost roads in landslide-prone mountain areas. In both case examples the roads were severely affected by landslides, making large sections impassable. Only limited engineering geological assessments had been carried out prior to road construction, therefore {{only a few of}} these hazards had been identified during project feasibility study and design phases. Following these failures, engineering geological investigations were carried out to determine their causes and mechanisms using field mapping, supplemented in places by <b>trial</b> <b>pit</b> investigation, laboratory testing and stability analysis. The case examples demonstrate the value in carrying out timely and appropriately scaled engineering geological assessments as key contributions to the investigation, analysis and mitigation of these hazards. On the basis of the case examples described, engineering geological techniques are categorized into essential, desirable and useful as a guide to future assessments...|$|E
40|$|Cadmium, chromium, copper: lead, manganese, nickel, {{vanadium}} {{and zinc}} have been determined in samples of made-up ground from layers of a <b>trial</b> <b>pit</b> excavated on a recently derelict, industrially contaminated site. The pseudototal metal {{content of the}} layers was determined following a microwave-assisted digestion with aqua regia. Operational speciation was performed using the BCR three-step sequential extraction procedure. Analyses were carried out by flame or electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS or ETAAS). A suppressive interference (similar to 30 %) was observed in the determination of cadmium in aqua regia digests by ETAAS, but not in 0. 11 mol l(- 1) acetic acid, 0. 1 mol l(- 1) hydroxylammonium chloride or 1. 0 mol l(- 1) ammonium acetate extracts. Agreement between duplicate samples was acceptable (i. e. within 10 %) for most elements in most layers, but some large discrepancies were apparent. especially for lead. The amount of metal extracted in the sequential procedure (i. e. Step 1 +Step 2 +Step 3 +residual) did not generally agree well with pseudototal digestion. Various layers of the trail pit contained significant levels of contaminant metals, but these were not always in easily mobilized forms. For example, less than 0. 2 % of the lead (similar to 4000 mu g g(- 1)) at 65 - 85 cm depth was present as exchangeable or acid-soluble species.

40|$|Geomorphological mapping {{is being}} used {{increasingly}} in engineering projects (especially at the reconnaissance and site-investigation stages) as a rapid, highly cost-effective means of assessing both potential hazards and resources. This is normally achieved through a field mapping programme which {{is dependent on the}} availability of aerial photographs, and which involves the correct interpretation f landforms as to their origins, material composition, and associated present-day geomorphological processes. The results of such a survey need to be presented in a form which is of direct use to an engineering geologist and/or engineer. This is best achieved, in most cases, by the production of problem or site-orientated maps derived from the primary geomorphological survey. The case studies, drawn from several investigations in arid land environments, were made by a small team of (3 - 5) geomorphologists and geologists, working for short but con-centrated periods of time in the field.
