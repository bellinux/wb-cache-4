5|$|On April 24, 2007, the Raptors {{won their}} first playoff game in five seasons, with an 89–83 {{victory over the}} New Jersey Nets, but lost the series 4–2. The series was notable for pitting ex-Raptor Vince Carter against his former team. <b>The</b> <b>Nets</b> took home court {{advantage}} in Game 1, holding off a late Raptors rally in the fourth quarter. The Raptors pulled away in another tight game to even the series at one game apiece. When the series shifted to New Jersey, <b>the</b> <b>Nets</b> {{took charge of the}} series, winning games 3 and 4 in routs. New Jersey had a chance to win the series in game 5 in Toronto, but the Raptors took a 20-point lead after one quarter. Still, New Jersey managed to chip away and had a chance to win the game, but Boštjan Nachbar's three-pointer missed at the buzzer. Needing to win in New Jersey to force a game 7, Toronto held a one-point lead with under a minute to play in game 6, but Richard Jefferson hit a layup with eight seconds left to play. Toronto attempted to try for the game-winning shot, but Jefferson intercepted a pass to seal the series for <b>the</b> <b>Nets.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Brooklyn Nets are an American {{professional}} basketball team based in Brooklyn, New York. They are {{a member of}} the Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference in the National Basketball Association (NBA). The team plays its home games at the Barclays Center. The franchise was founded as the New Jersey Americans in 1967, {{and was one of the}} eleven original American Basketball Association (ABA) teams. In its second ABA season, Arthur Brown, the team owner, moved the team to Long Island and renamed it the New York Nets. The team won ABA championships in 1974 and 1976. When the ABA merged with the NBA in 1976, <b>the</b> <b>Nets</b> were one of four ABA teams admitted into the NBA. The team was moved to the Rutgers Athletic Center in New Jersey; after the 1976–77 NBA season, the team was renamed the New Jersey Nets. Since they joined the NBA, <b>the</b> <b>Nets</b> have won 4divisional championships, 2conference championships and appeared in the playoffs 16times. <b>The</b> <b>Nets</b> moved to Brooklyn in 2012, and now play as the Brooklyn Nets.|$|E
5000|$|One way {{to better}} {{understand}} the concept of flux in electromagnetism is by comparing it to a butterfly <b>net.</b> <b>The</b> amount of air moving through <b>the</b> <b>net</b> at any given instant in time is the flux. If the wind speed is high, then the flux through <b>the</b> <b>net</b> is large. If <b>the</b> <b>net</b> is made bigger, then the flux is larger even though the wind speed is the same. For the most air to move through <b>the</b> <b>net,</b> <b>the</b> opening of <b>the</b> <b>net</b> must be facing the direction the wind is blowing. If <b>the</b> <b>net</b> is parallel to the wind, then no wind will be moving through <b>the</b> <b>net.</b> <b>The</b> simplest way to think of flux is [...] "how much air goes through the net", where the air is a velocity field and <b>the</b> <b>net</b> is <b>the</b> boundary of an imaginary surface.|$|R

5|$|Australia {{came out}} to bat halfway through the middle session on the second day, after England had ended on 363. Having dropped Brown, Barnes's injury left Australia with only one {{specialist}} opener, Morris. Johnson—a bowler—was deployed as Australia's makeshift second opener and fell for one. On the third morning, Barnes {{came out to}} bat upon Keith Miller's dismissal at 4/135, {{even though he had}} collapsed from the aftereffects of his injury while practising in <b>the</b> <b>nets.</b> Barnes had refused to stay in hospital and returned to the ground despite his ribs being discoloured from the bruising. Bradman was not aware of Barnes's collapse in <b>the</b> <b>nets,</b> but had told all rounder Sam Loxton to bat before Barnes to give the bruised opener more rest. Loxton told Barnes of Bradman's wishes, but when Miller was dismissed, Barnes defied team orders and walked out to bat, shaking Pollard's hand at the start of his innings.|$|E
5|$|In July 2014, Morris {{joined the}} San Antonio Spurs for the 2014 NBA Summer League. On September 24, 2014, {{he signed with}} the Portland Trail Blazers. However, he was later waived by the Trail Blazers on October 25, 2014. On December 11, 2014, the Brooklyn Nets made a two-for-one trade {{clearing}} a space on their roster. Morris signed with the team that day and made his debut for them the next day, recording two points and one assist in the 88-70 win over the Philadelphia 76ers. On June 29, he was waived by <b>the</b> <b>Nets.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to attracting predators {{such as the}} Amazon river dolphin, these high-water occurrences are an ideal location to draw in the local fisheries. Human fishing activities directly compete with the dolphins for the same fish species, the tambaqui (Colossoma macropomum) and the pirapitinga (Piaractus brachypomus), resulting in deliberate or unintentional catches of the Amazon river dolphin. The local fishermen overfish, and when the Amazon River dolphins remove the commercialized fish from <b>the</b> <b>nets</b> and lines, it damages the equipment and the capture and causes a negative reaction from the local fishermen.|$|E

Parker was effective in shutting down Carter, restricting him to 13-for-43 shooting in the first two games. However, the Raptors were eliminated by <b>the</b> <b>Nets</b> after Game 6. On April 4, 2007, the NBA also announced that Parker had been selected by a five-member panel of former players as the divisional winner of the 2006–07 NBA Sportsmanship Award.

40|$|The Swedish {{electricity}} {{market was}} deregulated in 1996 {{and as a}} consequence of this <b>the</b> <b>net</b> companies are acting on a natural monopoly market. <b>The</b> <b>Net</b> Utility Model was introduced to force <b>the</b> <b>net</b> companies to charge fair prices for the distribution of electricity. The model was developed by the Energy Agency to create an incentive for <b>the</b> <b>net</b> company to increase efficiency and is still under construction. The purpose of this report is to examine <b>the</b> <b>net</b> companies response and attitudes after that <b>the</b> <b>Net</b> Utility Model is applied. Within that, it is questioned which arguments <b>the</b> <b>net</b> companies present in order to motivating a debit degree of more than 1, 0. Further are <b>the</b> <b>net</b> companies’ views of their customers demands examined. This is done by a method called Stated Preference where the respondent is faced with different scenarios and has to choose the best alternative. The conclusions of the study are that several arguments stressed by <b>the</b> <b>net</b> companies are valid and therefore are allowing a debit degree higher than 1. 0. However, the Energy Agency considers that the model already takes these arguments into consideration. On the other hand <b>the</b> <b>net</b> companies stress that the model does not take the arguments enough into consideration. Several of <b>the</b> <b>net</b> companies’ arguments are valid if tested in a competitive market. <b>The</b> <b>net</b> companies do not emphasize the assumed arguments of their customers but stress their own technical arguments...|$|R

5|$|The Raptors {{entered the}} All-Star break with a 28–24 record, and DeRozan was also {{selected}} {{to play in}} the All-Star game, being only the fourth ever Raptor to do so. On March 28, 2014, the Raptors clinched a playoff berth {{for the first time since}} 2008 after beating the Boston Celtics, 105–103. On April 11, 2014, the Raptors lost to the New York Knicks, 108–100, but since the division rival Brooklyn Nets lost to the Atlanta Hawks the same night, the Raptors became Atlantic Division champions for the first time since 2007. They finished the regular season with a franchise-high 48 wins (.585), going 42–22 (.656) after the Gay trade, the third-best record in the Eastern Conference. The Raptors faced <b>the</b> <b>Nets</b> in the first round of the playoffs for the first time since 2007, when <b>the</b> <b>Nets</b> were located in New Jersey.
