5000|$|A <b>ticket</b> <b>punch</b> (or control nippers) is a {{hand tool}} for {{permanently}} marking admission tickets and similar items of paper or card stock. It makes a perforation and a corresponding chad. A <b>ticket</b> <b>punch</b> resembles a hole punch, differing {{in that the}} <b>ticket</b> <b>punch</b> has a longer jaw (or [...] "reach") and the option of having a distinctive die shape. A <b>ticket</b> <b>punch</b> resembles a needle punch in that it makes a distinctive pattern in the item punched, but differs in that it makes a chad.|$|E

50|$|The {{company was}} {{established}} in July 1878 in order to acquire the patent rights to an American hand-registering <b>ticket</b> <b>punch</b> that was being used {{by a number of}} British tramway companies. By 1884 they had begun development of their own range of ticket printing machines. In 1891 they began supplying ticketing machines for London General Omnibus Company. From then until its demise, Bell Punch would have an unbroken history of supplying successive London bus companies, along with many other bus operators throughout the country.|$|E

50|$|In foot orienteering, {{the oldest}} form of orienteering, the first control cards were card stock with a {{perforated}} stub, the stub {{to be handed}} in at the Start as a safety check. At each control, originally, the control staff or the competitor rubber stamped the control card using a rubber stamp and inkpad kept at that control. Rubber stamps soon were replaced with <b>ticket</b> <b>punches,</b> usually with a different punch shape (circular, square, diamond, star, etc.) at each control. Card stock control cards are in limited use today, having been mostly replaced by weatherproof stock such as Tyvek. <b>Ticket</b> <b>punches</b> {{have been replaced by}} needle punches that punch a pattern of small holes in the control card (similar to a perfin).|$|R
50|$|<b>Ticket</b> <b>punches</b> {{also have}} {{decorative}} uses, involving both their perforations and their chads. Available die shapes include many geometric shapes, silhouettes of objects or animals. Die shapes for company logos and other proprietary {{images can be}} manufactured by special arrangement. These are used to punch decorative holes {{in the margins of}} pieces of paper, and to make small confetti.|$|R

5000|$|The Bell Punch Company (named {{after its}} first product, a <b>ticket</b> <b>punch</b> with a bell used by tram and bus conductors) had been {{producing}} {{a very successful}} range of key-driven mechanical calculators of the Comptometer type under the names [...] "Plus" [...] and [...] "Sumlock", since the 1930s. In 1956 the young graduate Norbert Kitz (also known as Norman Kitz), who had worked on the early British Pilot ACE computer project, had a chance meeting {{with some of the}} directors of Control Systems Ltd., of which the Bell Punch Company was then a subsidiary. Some years earlier, while researching the introduction to his dissertation, he was looking at the mechanical calculators in the Science Museum, London, United Kingdom, and had realised that the future of calculators lay in electronics. Unfortunately, the major mechanical calculator manufacturers were far away in the U.S. and Germany, and Kitz's idea lay dormant until he raised it at that meeting. The directors were very forward looking and were impressed by Kitz and his idea. They decided to open an Electronics Development Department, and took on Kitz as the leader of a project to develop an electronic version of the company's mechanical calculators. To help confidentiality the project was given the code-name ANITA.|$|E

5000|$|Herman Hollerith's first {{device for}} {{punching}} cards from the 1890s was ...any ordinary <b>ticket</b> <b>punch,</b> cutting a round hole 3/16 {{of an inch}} in diameter. Use of such a punch was facilitated by placing the holes to be used near {{the edges of the}} card. Hollerith soon developed a more accurate and simpler to use Keyboard Punch, using a pantograph to link a punch mechanism to a guide pointer that an operator would place over the appropriate mark in a 12 by 20 matrix to line up a manual punch over the correct hole in one of 20 columns. [...] In 1901 Hollerith patented a mechanism where an operator pressed one of 12 keys to punch a hole, with the card automatically advancing to the next column. This first-generation Type 001 keypunch used 45 columns and round holes. In 1923 The Tabulating Machine Company introduced the first electric keypunch, the Type 011 Electric Keypunch, a similar looking device where each key closed an electrical contact that activated a solenoid which punched the hole. The 80 column punched card format was introduced in 1928; existing keypunches and other products could be modified for this new format while keeping the same model numbers. [...] Later Hollerith keypunches included the Type 016 Motor-Driven Electric Duplicating Keypunch (1929), the Type 31 Alphabetical Duplicating Punch (1933), and the Type 32 Alphabetical Printing Punch (1933).|$|E
50|$|Confetti {{are small}} pieces or {{streamers}} of paper, mylar, or metallic material {{which are usually}} thrown at parades, sporting team winners, and celebrations, especially weddings (and game shows, {{following the end of}} a milestone or the occasion of a big win. The origins are from the Latin confectum, with confetti the plural of Italian confetto, small sweet. Modern paper confetti trace back to symbolic rituals of tossing grains and sweets during special occasions, traditional for numerous cultures throughout history as an ancient custom dating back to pagan times, but adapted from sweets and grains to paper through the centuries.Confetti are made in a variety of colors, and commercially available confetti come in many different shapes. A distinction is made between confetti and glitter; glitter is smaller than confetti (pieces usually no larger than 1mm) and is universally shiny. Most table confetti are also shiny. While they are called metallic confetti they are actually metallized PVC. The most popular shape is the star. Seasonally, Snowflake Confetti are the most requested shape. Most party supply stores carry paper and metallic confetti. Confetti are commonly used at social gatherings such as parties, weddings, and Bar Mitzvahs, but are by some people considered taboo at funerals. The simplest confetti are simply shredded paper (see ticker-tape parade), and can be made with scissors or a paper shredder. Other confetti often consist of chads punched out of scrap paper. A hole punch {{can be used to make}} small round chads. For more elaborate chads, a <b>ticket</b> <b>punch</b> can be used. Most pieces of paper flats will flutter as tumblewings giving flight times because of gliding aerodynamics.|$|E

He returned to the North Texas area where he was a shoe salesman at Sanger Brothers in Dallas.
