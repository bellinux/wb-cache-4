5|$|Texas voters {{lean toward}} fiscal conservatism, while enjoying the {{benefits}} of huge federal investment {{in the state in}} military and other facilities achieved by the power of the Solid South in the 20th century. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> have socially conservative values.|$|E
5|$|Both {{resident}} and transient orangutans aggregate on large fruiting trees to feed. The fruits {{tend to be}} abundant, so competition is low and individuals may engage in social interactions. Orangutans will also form travelling groups with members moving between different food sources. These groups tend {{to be made of}} only a few individuals. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> be consortships between an adult male and female.|$|E
5|$|In their {{introduced}} ranges, <b>they</b> <b>also</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> {{seek out}} organisms that exhibit structures their slender bodies can easily blend with. These include macroalgae like Ulva lactuca, Ceramiumspp., Plocamiumspp., Cladophoraspp., Chorda filum, Fucus vesiculosus, Pylaiellaspp. and the introduced Sargassum muticum; hydrozoans like Obeliaspp. and Tubularia indivisa; bryozoans; tube-building amphipods like Monocorophium acherusicum and Jassa marmorata; and even soft-bodied tunicates like Ascidiella aspersa and Ciona intestinalis.|$|E

40|$|The {{literature}} suggests {{a relationship between}} technology use and self-esteem. Such research has failed to consider young school-aged children and {{their use of the}} internet, particularly across contexts. Thirty-eight children aged 6 to 8 years rated the level and nature of their internet use (email, instant message, play games, visit websites) at home, school and in the community (i. e., at someone else’s house). <b>They</b> <b>also</b> rated items that measured home, school and peer self-esteem. Instant messaging at school explained 21 % of the differences in school self-esteem. As children <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> report instant messaging at school, <b>they</b> <b>also</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> report the highest school-based self-esteem. Instant messaging at someone else’s house explained 11 % of the differences in home self-esteem. As children <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> report instant messaging at someone else’s house, <b>they</b> <b>also</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> report the lowest home self-esteem. Visiting websites at someone else’s house explained 10 % of the differences in peer self-esteem. As children <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> report visiting websites at someone else’s house, <b>they</b> <b>also</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> report the highest peer self-esteem. Internet use during the early school years is related to children’s sense of self and mediated by context. </p...|$|R
5|$|Caching is {{inhibited}} by {{the presence}} of Steller's jays (Cyanocitta stelleri) and grey jays from adjacent territories, which follow resident grey jays to steal cached food. Grey jays carry large food items to distant cache sites for storage more often than small food items. To prevent theft, <b>they</b> <b>also</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> carry valuable food items further from the source when caching in the company of one or more grey jays. Scatterhoarding discourages pilferage by competitors, while increased cache density leads to increased thievery. In southern portions of the grey jay's range, food is not cached during summer because of the chance of spoilage and the reduced need for winter stores.|$|E
5|$|Horses are prey {{animals with}} a strong fight-or-flight response. Their first {{reaction}} to threat is to startle and usually flee, although they will stand their ground and defend themselves when flight is impossible or if their young are threatened. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> be curious; when startled, they will often hesitate an instant to ascertain the cause of their fright, and may not always flee from something that they perceive as non-threatening. Most light horse riding breeds were developed for speed, agility, alertness and endurance; natural qualities that extend from their wild ancestors. However, through selective breeding, some breeds of horses are quite docile, particularly certain draft horses.|$|E
25|$|Permanent tribunals tend to {{have their}} own rules and procedures, and tend to be much more formal. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> be more expensive, and, for {{procedural}} reasons, slower.|$|E
25|$|Like evangelicals {{in other}} Protestant denominations, they {{stressed}} the need for a conversion experience and participated in the revivalism of the Second Great Awakening, holding revival meetings and prayer meetings. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> disapprove of social amusements such as dancing, card-playing, and the theatre.|$|R
50|$|In contrast, the Japanese {{speakers}} often produced backchannel expressions such as un or sō {{while their}} partner was speaking. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> {{mark the end}} of their own utterances with sentence-final particles, and produced vertical head movements near the end of their partner's utterances.|$|R

25|$|Eastern Orthodox Christians {{are among}} the wealthiest Christian {{denominations}} in the United States. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> be better educated than most other religious groups in America, having {{a high number of}} graduate (68%) and post-graduate (28%) degrees per capita.|$|E
25|$|The two {{aldehydes}} {{of greatest}} importance in industry, formaldehyde and acetaldehyde, have complicated behavior {{because of their}} tendency to oligomerize or polymerize. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> hydrate, forming the geminal diol. The oligomers/polymers and the hydrates exist in equilibrium with the parent aldehyde.|$|E
25|$|<b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> {{occupy the}} largest comb, while {{subordinates}} (those that lack developed eggs) are often forced onto smaller combs or reside on the substrate of the ceiling. Acts of dominance {{also appear to}} increase as the colony cycle progresses, so {{it is possible that}} some acts of dominance may be performed by the parent-generation on the newly emerging adults.|$|E
5000|$|Jameson was {{the first}} {{professional}} historian to become the AHA president (1907). Although a number of Jameson's colleagues and friends went on to serve as AHA presidents, <b>they</b> <b>also</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> refer to Jameson as [...] "the Dean," [...] a jocose reference to his influence within the organization. Jameson invited W.E.B. Du Bois to present a paper concerning Reconstruction at the 1909 AHA meeting, which proved controversial; no other African-American was invited to speak before the AHA until 1940.|$|R
50|$|Settings {{were often}} ranches, the battlefields of the Revolution, and cabarets. Movies about the Mexican Revolution {{focused on the}} initial {{overthrow}} of the Porfirio Díaz government rather than the fighting among the various factions afterwards. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> focus on rural themes as “Mexican”, even though the population was increasingly urban.|$|R
50|$|All in all, the TSV 1861 Nördlingen is a {{very stable}} and solid club, having played now for almost 50 years either in the Landesliga Süd or the highest Schwaben league, be this the Bezirksliga, Bezirksoberliga or 2nd Amateurliga. While some clubs in the Bezirk Schwaben {{achieved}} higher, <b>they</b> <b>also</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> fall deeper.|$|R
25|$|In {{administered}} arbitration, the arbitration will {{be administered}} {{by a professional}} arbitration institution providing arbitration services, such as the LCIA in London, or the ICC in Paris, or the American Arbitration Association in the United States. Normally the arbitration institution also will be the appointing authority. Arbitration institutions tend {{to have their own}} rules and procedures, and may be more formal. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> be more expensive, and, for procedural reasons, slower.|$|E
25|$|A {{low-cost}} denture {{starts at}} about $300–$500 per denture, or $600–$1,000 {{for a complete}} set of upper and lower dentures. These tend to be cold cured dentures, which are considered temporary because of the lower quality materials and streamlined processing methods used in their manufacture. In many cases, there is no opportunity to try them on for fit before they are finished. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> look artificial and not as natural as higher quality, higher priced dentures.|$|E
25|$|Extraversion is {{the state}} of {{primarily}} obtaining gratification from outside oneself. Extraverts tend to enjoy human interactions and to be enthusiastic, talkative, assertive, and gregarious. Extraverts are energized and thrive off being around other people. They take pleasure in activities that involve large social gatherings, such as parties, community activities, public demonstrations, and business or political groups. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> work well in groups. An extraverted person is likely to enjoy time spent with people and find less reward in time spent alone. They tend to be energized when around other people, and they are more prone to boredom when they are by themselves.|$|E
50|$|Due {{to their}} {{geographic}} concentration, it is {{noted that they}} <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> be isolated and had an insular culture. As a result, <b>they</b> <b>also</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> be very late in their adoption of the English language and of western culture in general. The insular culture and resultant intermarriage can result in a high degree of consanguinity amongst Vathimas.|$|R
25|$|Women {{also began}} to wear caps known as a cornette around 1816. These caps were tied under the chin and worn indoors. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> be greatly adorned with plumes, ribbons, flowers, and jewels. Another {{alternative}} to the cornette was the turban, also often bejeweled and adorned, which shows the great interest in exotic cultures.|$|R
50|$|By contrast, a {{large portion}} of the {{settlers}} encroaching on the Native American territories were Scots-Irish, Irish from Ulster who were of Scottish descent and had been part of the English plantation of northern Ireland. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> support the Revolution. But in the back country, there were also Scots-Irish who were Loyalists, such as Simon Girty.|$|R
25|$|A {{distinct}} form of Japanese adventure {{game that}} eventually emerged is the visual novel, a genre that was largely rooted in Portopia Serial Murder Case, but gradually became more streamlined and uses many conventions that are distinct from Western adventures. They are almost universally first-person, and driven primarily by dialog. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> use menu-based interactions and navigation, with point and click implementations that {{are quite different}} from Western adventure games. Inventory-based puzzles {{of the sort that}} form the basis of classic Western adventures, are quite rare. Logic puzzles like those found in Myst are likewise unusual. Because of this, Japanese visual novels tend to be streamlined, and often quite easy, relying more on storytelling than challenge to keep players interested.|$|E
25|$|Schottky diodes are {{constructed}} from a metal to semiconductor contact. They {{have a lower}} forward voltage drop than p–n junction diodes. Their forward voltage drop at forward currents of about 1mA is in the range 0.15V to 0.45V, which makes them useful in voltage clamping applications and prevention of transistor saturation. They {{can also be used}} as low loss rectifiers, although their reverse leakage current is in general higher than that of other diodes. Schottky diodes are majority carrier devices and so do not suffer from minority carrier storage problems that slow down many other diodes—so they have a faster reverse recovery than p–n junction diodes. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> have much lower junction capacitance than p–n diodes, which provides for high switching speeds and their use in high-speed circuitry and RF devices such as switched-mode power supply, mixers, and detectors.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the skill}} system is freeform, certain {{combinations}} {{of skills and}} equipment work well together. This combination of specialization in skill and equipment is known as an archetype. The most notable archetypes are street samurai, characters who have heavily augmented their bodies with cyberware and bioware and focus on physical combat; adepts, characters who have magical abilities that increase their physical (and sometimes mental) combat abilities; faces, highly charismatic characters who specialize in negotiations and social manipulation; hackers (deckers), experts in electronic surveillance, security, and augmented/virtual reality monitoring, combat and response; riggers, who augment their brains to achieve fine control over vehicles and drones; and magicians, who cast spells and can view emotions and call spirits from astral space. In Fourth Edition, with the setting change, deckers are replaced by hackers, who manipulate computer networks with augmented reality via ubiquitous commlinks; <b>they</b> <b>also</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> take over the rigger's role.|$|E
5000|$|Welliver later {{expanded}} some of {{the outdoor}} studies into large paintings in the studio, painting 4 to 7 hours a day, meticulously starting the canvases in the upper left-hand corner and finishing in the lower right. If the finished paintings were vibrantly painted, containing [...] "an emotional intensity {{that goes beyond the}} ordinary limits of realism", <b>they</b> <b>also</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> be emotionally sombre.|$|R
2500|$|The yer vowels ĭ and ŭ {{are often}} called [...] "ultrashort" [...] and were lower, more {{centralised}} and shorter {{than their counterparts}} i and y/u. They disappeared in most positions in the word, already sporadically in the earliest texts but more frequently later on. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> merge with other vowels, particularly ĭ with e and ŭ with o, but differently in different areas.|$|R
5000|$|... 1954: A {{study in}} Manchester {{revealed}} {{that between the}} years 1937 and 1954, {{almost a quarter of}} under-age girls coming to the attention of one female police officer regarding underage sex were pregnant. It was also noted that the girls often came from backgrounds of broken homes or bad parental influence. It was found that <b>they</b> <b>also</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> have a lower than average IQ.|$|R
25|$|PMI {{estimation}} is used {{to figure}} out how much time has elapsed since a person died by using insects to help estimate this interval. It depends on the species of insect, as some are attracted to fresh corpses while others are only attracted to the putrid and advanced stages of decomposition. This means the insects go through waves of succession. Using this information as well as the lifecycle of the insect in question can help to estimate the PMI. The judgment depends on what stage of development the insect is in, as well as the weather in recent months among other factors. Specifically with C. cadaverina, they tend to be attracted to fairly advanced stages of decomposition, while rarely being found on fresh carrion. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> be in the second wave of succession, usually showing up after Lucilia spp. and Calliphora spp.|$|E
25|$|Cathedrals, {{as well as}} many abbey {{churches and}} basilicas, have certain complex {{structural}} forms that are found less often in parish churches. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> display a higher level of contemporary architectural style and the work of accomplished craftsmen, and occupy a status both ecclesiastical and social that an ordinary parish church does not have. Such a cathedral or great church is generally one of the finest buildings within its region and is a focus of local pride. Many cathedrals and basilicas, and a number of abbey churches are among the world's most renowned works of architecture. These include St. Peter’s Basilica, Notre Dame de Paris, Cologne Cathedral, Salisbury Cathedral, Prague Cathedral, Lincoln Cathedral, the Basilica of St Denis, the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore, the Basilica of San Vitale, St Mark's Basilica, Westminster Abbey, Saint Basil's Cathedral, Gaudí's incomplete Sagrada Familia and the ancient church of Hagia Sophia, now a museum.|$|E
25|$|Many changes {{brought about}} by the {{domestication}} of the horse have led to a need for shoes for numerous reasons, mostly linked to management that results in horses' hooves hardening less and being more vulnerable to injury. In the wild, a horse may travel up to 50 miles per day to obtain adequate forage. While horses in the wild cover large areas of terrain, they usually do so at relatively slow speeds, unless being chased by a predator. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> live in arid steppe climates. The consequence of slow but nonstop travel in a dry climate is that horses' feet are naturally worn to a small, smooth, even and hard state. The continual stimulation of the sole of the foot keeps it thick and hard. However, in domestication, the ways horses are used differ from what they would encounter in their natural environment. Domesticated horses are brought to colder and wetter areas than their ancestral habitat. These softer and heavier soils soften the hooves and make them prone to splitting, making hoof protection necessary. Consequently, it was in northern Europe that the nailed horseshoe arose in its modern form.|$|E

50|$|Kalinga Magha's geopolitical {{impact is}} {{reflected}} in the changing language of the Culavamsa as well. The traditional divisions of Sri Lanka, into Rajarata, Dhakkinadesa, and Ruhuna, first undergo a change of names (Rajarata becomes Pathithadesa, Dhakkinadesa becomes Mayarata), and then slip into obsolescence altogether. Their successor kingdoms <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> be geographically smaller and centred on a strong citadel-capital, such as Yapahuwa or Gampola; <b>they</b> <b>also</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> be much short lived, like Sitawaka.|$|R
50|$|The populist faction had {{concerns}} that sometimes prompted it to support {{one of the}} other parties. Its rural character meant that they sided with the expansionists when there were troubles on the frontier. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> side with the expansionists on the recurring problems with the local money, whose inflation <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> favor their ability to repay debts in depreciated currency. These ties became stronger in the 1760s as the conflict grew with Parliament.|$|R
