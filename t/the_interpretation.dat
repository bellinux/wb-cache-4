5|$|There is {{a debate}} {{on the origins of}} the word Ahimsa, and how its meaning evolved. Mayrhofer as well as Dumot suggest the root word may be han which means kill, which leads to <b>the</b> <b>interpretation</b> that ahimsa means do not kill. Schmidt as well as Bodewitz explain the proper root word is hiṃs and the Sanskrit verb hinasti, which leads to <b>the</b> <b>interpretation</b> ahimsa means do not injure, or do not hurt. Wackernagel-Debrunner concur with the latter explanation.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if students change their responses to selected interpretations of American history after participating in a course in American history. The analysis of the responses was based upon interpretations in a measuring device titled, "Student Responses to Selected Interpretations of American History. " This measuring device was created for this study by the researcher. The research was planned to answer the question, "Do students change their responses to selected interpretations of American history at a statistically significant level after participating in a course in American history?"The investigator collected responses to the pre-test and post-test administration of the measuring device from six hundred and fourteen eleventh grade students. An additional eighty-seven responses from sophomores were collected for purposes of comparison with the juniors. The subjects were students from two senior high schools in Indiana. The subjects represented a heterogeneity of socio-economic status, race and achievement levels. The six hundred and fourteen juniors participated in a course in Americanhistory. The eighty-seven sophomores were enrolled in a course in world history at those two schools. Statistical processing of the data consisted of determining the significance of the proportion of changed responses to the measuring device. Coefficients of correlations of proportional change were computed on the basis of sex, intelligence test scores, and grade point averages. An analysis of the difference in proportion of change between sophomores and juniors was also computed. Analysis of the data led to the following findings:Students who had participated in the course in American history at the eleventh grade level changed their responses at a statistically significant level for forty-three of <b>the</b> <b>interpretations.</b> There was no correlation between sex and the proportion of change for forty-three of <b>the</b> <b>interpretations.</b> There was no correlation between intelligence test scores and the proportion of change for forty-three of <b>the</b> <b>interpretations.</b> There was no correlation between grade point average and proportion of change for thirty-eight of <b>the</b> <b>interpretations.</b> For two of <b>the</b> <b>interpretations</b> students with higher grade point averages were more likely to change their responses and for five of <b>the</b> <b>interpretations</b> students with higher grade point averages were less likely to change their responses than were students with a lower grade point average. Students who had participated in the course in American history were more likely to change their responses to ten of <b>the</b> <b>interpretations</b> than were students who had not participated in the course in American history. There was no statistically significant difference between these two groups' proportion of change for thirty-five of <b>the</b> <b>interpretations.</b> <b>The</b> following conclusions have been drawn from the findings: 1. Students who had participated in the course in American history at the eleventh grade level changed their responses at a statistically significant level for forty-three of <b>the</b> <b>interpretations.</b> 2. There was no significant correlation between sex and the proportion of change for forty-three of <b>the</b> <b>interpretations.</b> 3. There was no significant correlation between intelligence test scores and the proportion of change for forty-three of <b>the</b> <b>interpretations.</b> 4. There was no significant correlation between grade point average and the proportion of change for thirty-eight of <b>the</b> <b>interpretations.</b> For two of <b>the</b> <b>interpretations,</b> students with higher grade point averages were more likely to change their responses and for five of <b>the</b> <b>interpretations</b> students with higher grade point averages were less likely to changetheir responses than were students with lower grade point averages. 5.
