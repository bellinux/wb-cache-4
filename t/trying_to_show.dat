5|$|I {{think it}} is {{important}} that people see that spirituality is at the base of Nonviolent Communication, and that they learn the mechanics of the process with that in mind. It's really a spiritual practice that I am <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> as a way of life. Even though we don't mention this, people get seduced by the practice. Even if they practice this as a mechanical technique, they start to experience things between themselves and other people they weren't able to experience before. So eventually they come to the spirituality of the process. They begin to see that it's more than a communication process and realize it's really an attempt to manifest a certain spirituality.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of process theology has challenged the Irenaean tradition by teaching that God's power is limited {{and that he}} cannot be responsible for evil. Twentieth century philosopher Alvin Plantinga supported {{the idea that this}} world is the best possible world, arguing that the good in the world (including God's infinite goodness) outweighs the evil and proposing that the ultimate good of God's sacrifice when Jesus was crucified necessitated the existence of evil. His free will defence was not a theodicy because he was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> the logical compatibility of evil and the existence of God, rather than the probability of God. D. Z. Phillips and Fyodor Dostoyevsky challenged the instrumental use of suffering, suggesting that love cannot be expressed through suffering. However, Dostoyevsky also states that the beauty of love is evident, in that love can continue to grow, withstand and overcome even the most evil acts. Michael Tooley argued that the magnitude of suffering is excessive and that, in some cases, cannot lead to moral development. French theologian Henri Blocher criticised Hick's universalism, arguing that such a view negates free will, which was similarly important to the theodicy.|$|E

25|$|I've always {{believed}} that you play to highlight the song, not to highlight the player. The song is all that matters. There are two ways {{you can choose to}} go. You can try to be someone like Eddie Van Halen, who is a great guitarist, a virtuoso. Yet he doesn't make good records because what he plays is totally lost {{in the context of this}} band's music. Then there are guitar players like Chet Atkins, who weren't out there <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> themselves off as guitarists per se, but were using the guitar as a tool to make good records. I remember loving Chet's work when I was a kid, but it was only later, when I really listened to his guitar parts, that I realized how much they were a part of the song's fabric, and how much you'd be going 'Oh, that song just isn't working' if they weren't there.|$|E

Upon release, Gilmour said: [...] "Perhaps we were <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> what Syd was really like. But perhaps we were trying to punish him..." [...] While Barrett admitted that [...] "I don't think it would stand as my last statement", Waters was more optimistic, declaring Barrett a [...] "genius".

500|$|As {{with the}} pilot, [...] "The Thing You Love Most" [...] was co-written by series co-creators Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz. Smallville co-executive {{producer}} Greg Beeman served as director. The episode {{focuses on the}} rivalry between Emma and Regina, as each believes they know {{what is best for}} Henry. In an interview with TV Overmind, actress Lana Parrilla explained that viewers would see a [...] "vulnerable" [...] side of Regina/The Evil Queen in this episode. Says Parrilla, [...] "What I’ve been <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> is not the hatred for Snow White, but where it derives from. It’s not so surfaced. That brings a vulnerability to the character. You’ll see into her history and that exposes her in a very vulnerable way as well." [...] As for Regina's troubled relationship with Henry, Parrilla noted that [...] "she may have a cold heart, but I think she really, genuinely loves her son. She doesn’t think of him as an adopted son, she thinks of him as her son." ...|$|E

As we'll see with the introduction {{in a moment of}} a character who throws all of this into question – God – we're going to see what his place is in all of this, or at least explore what Burt Reynolds, playing God here, {{has to do with the}} character Wayne." [...] The main idea behind the episode, was that God knows all the numbers, because they are his numbers and he is laying them down and is in [...] "charge of the big game". Being that God is <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> us the game, as it was a [...] "game" [...] to be [...] "won or lost", and Wayne has lost this game.|$|E
500|$|The {{animation}} of {{the eagle}} (the [...] "Eagle King") that transports Kuros to the Wind Elemental {{was one of}} Ste Pickford's first graphics which he drew for the NES. It was done in Deluxe Paint for the Amiga with sketching done by mouse - without assistance from graphics tablets or other scanners. He took eagle drawings from a book on animals in motion by Eadweard Muybridge. Pickford wanted {{to show off the}} possible graphical capabilities of the NES; he said, [...] "I wanted to do something 'flashy' early in the game, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> off my amazing graphic art skills on the rather primitive NES. We were working on Amiga and ST games at the same time, so were always trying to push the NES with bigger and better graphics, right from the start of our work on the machine." [...] The eagle consisted of only three colors and between 11 and 17 sprites per frame of animation. There was a smaller version of the same eagle, which was used as a regular enemy in that level.|$|E
