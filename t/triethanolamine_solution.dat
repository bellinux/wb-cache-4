The thin films were obtained in a reaction bath at various amounts of <b>triethanolamine</b> <b>solution.</b> The structure and optical properties of the thin films were studied by X-ray diffraction and UV-Visible spectrophotometer, respectively. The photoresponse of the deposited films and their conduction types were evaluated using the photoelectrochemical technique.

However, the total Ni 4 S 3 peaks were reduced to two peaks as the amount of triethanolamine was further increased to 10 ml. Based on the photoelectrochemical test, different samples showed different photosensitivity results. Therefore, the presence of triethanolamine as a complexing agent had significant influence on the properties of the deposited films...|$|E
40|$|This {{contribution}} {{reports the}} synthesis, characterization {{and application of}} a new ternary homo-heterojunction photocatalyst for improved hydrogen production via water-splitting. The heterostructure is constructed by soft-grafting of graphitic carbon nitride (GCN) and graphene oxide (GO) into an amorphous carbon nitride (ACN) substrate. In this ternary hybrid, a cascaded redox-junction is formed that significantly facilitates the separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs (EHPs), retards EHP recombination and shuttles electrons to the photocatalyst/liquid interface for proton reduction reactions. When deposited with 3 wt% Pt as a cocatalyst, this new photocatalyst exhibits hydrogen production of 251 μmol h− 1 from 10 vol% aqueous <b>triethanolamine</b> <b>solution</b> under visible light (420 nm) irradiation with an apparent quantum efficiency of 6. 3 %.

Quantitative analyses of the surface complex revealed that absorption intensity at 450 nm in diffuse reflection measurement was almost proportional to its amount and that its amount depended strongly on the amount of surface hydroxyl groups of TiO 2 but not on the crystal structure of TiO 2, anatase and rutile. The bn(OH) 2 complexation was also applied to platinized TiO 2 to drive photocatalytic molecular hydrogen (H 2) evolution from 1 deaerated <b>triethanolamine</b> <b>solutions</b> under visible-light irradiation at a wavelength even longer than 540 nm.

A {{simple and}} {{sensitive}} spectrophotometric method for {{the determination of}} nitrogen dioxide in air and nitrite in water, soil, some analytical grade chemicals and tooth paste has been developed. Nitrogen dioxide in air is fixed as nitrite ion in alka-line sodium arsenite or <b>triethanolamine</b> absorber <b>solution.</b> The method {{is based on the}} reaction of nitrite in aqueous medium with known excess of Neutral Red (C. I. 50040), an azine dye having a primary amino group with absorption maxima at 530 nm. In acid medium, it showed a decrease in colour intensity due to diazotization, followed by deamination. Addition of bromide ion enhances the rate of diazotization, and the reaction goes to completion almost instantaneously. Beer’s law is obeyed over the range 0 – 20 µg nitrite and the molar absorptivity is 2. 5 · 104 L mol– 1 cm– 1. The colour system is stable for 2 days.

Optical density {{per unit area}} (OD per area) of infective juveniles of Steinernerna carpocapsae (All) and two Heterorhabditis isolates (UK 211 and HF 85) was measured with an image analysis system and compared with neutral lipid levels obtained by Oil Red O staining. Optical density (OD) measurements were compared with triglyceride levels of UK 211 and HF 85. Good correlations between OD per area and neutral lipids (0. 90) and between OD and triglycerides (0. 87) were found.

The operating principle of almost all passive samplers is based on chemical reactions taking place on absorbent (impregnated filter or grid). The pollutant absorption mechanism is based on passive diffusion through the gas diffusion layer to absorbent. The diffusion process {{can be explained by}} first Fick’s law described as a free movement of gases from the ambient air to a passive sampler. This movement depends on pollutant gradient.

40|$|Oligomers of beta-amino acids ("beta-peptides") can be {{designed}} to fold into stable helices that display side chains with a diverse range of chemical functionality in precise arrangements. We sought {{to determine whether the}} predictable, three-dimensional side-chain patterns generated by beta-peptides could be used in combination with single-molecule force spectroscopy to quantify how changes in nanometer-scale chemical patterns affect intermolecular interactions. To this end, we synthesized beta-peptides that were designed to be either globally amphiphilic (GA), i. e., display a global segregation of side chains bearing hydrophobic and cationic functional groups, or non-globally amphiphilic (iso-GA), i. e., display a more uniform distribution of hydrophobic and cationic functional groups in three-dimensions. Single-molecule force measurements of beta-peptide interactions with hydrophobic surfaces through aqueous <b>solution</b> (<b>triethanolamine</b> buffer, pH 7. 2) reveal that the GA and iso-GA isomers give rise to qualitatively different adhesion force histograms. The data are consistent with the display of a substantial nonpolar domain by the GA oligomer, which leads to strong hydrophobic interactions, and the absence of a comparable domain on the iso-GA oligomer. This interpretation is supported by force measurements in the presence of methanol, which is known to disrupt hydrophobic interactions. Our ability to associate changes in measured forces with changes in three-dimensional chemical nanopatterns projected from conformationally stable beta-peptide helices highlights a contrast between this system and conventional peptides (a-amino acid residues) : conventional peptides are more conformationally flexible, which leads to uncertainty in the three-dimensional nanoscopic chemical patterns that underlie measured forces. Overall, we conclude that beta-peptide oligomers provide a versatile platform for quantifying intermolecular interactions that arise from specific functional group nanopatterns...|$|R
40|$|Humic acid (HA) {{is one of}} {{the common}} NOM which {{contribute}} a major problem in treatment of surface water including (i) negative effect on water quality by colour, taste and odour problems, (ii) increased coagulant and disinfectant dose requirement (iii) promoted biological growth in distribution system and (iv) increased levels of complexes heavy metals and adsorbed organic pollutants. Thus, more efficient method for the humic acid removal has emerged. Among the membrane processes, nanofiltration (NF) has been increasingly used for wastewater and water treatments including natural organic matters (NOM). Nine membranes were prepared through interfacial polymerization of aqueous <b>solution,</b> <b>triethanolamine</b> (TEOA) and organic solution, trimesoyl chloride (TMC) on a polyethersulfone (PES) support film. The composite membranes were prepared under different TEOA monomer concentration (4, 6, 8 % w/v) and reaction times (15, 25, and 35 min). These membranes were characterized in terms of chemical properties (functional group and hydrophilicity) and morphological structures to verify polyester membrane formed on the top surface of PES (interfacial polymerization process). On top of that, membrane performance was also investigated in term of pure water permeability, rejection of charged (sodium chloride (NaCl) and sodium sulphate (Na 2 SO 4)) and uncharged solutes (vitamin B 12). All nine polyester membranes showed NF characteristics which in between 12. 98 L m 2 h- 1 bar- 1 until 1. 25 L m 2 h- 1 bar- 1. Analysis done by attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) on top surface and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) on top and cross sectional membrane indicate a new polyester layer formed on the PES membrane support. Highest TEOA monomer concentration (8 % w/v TEOA) and reaction time membrane (35 min) resulted as less hydrophobicity membrane when achieved the lowest contact angle measurement (θ = 34. 0 ± 0. 35) compared to unmodified membrane (θ = 62. 6 ± 0. 33). Using uncharged (Vitamin B 12) /charged solute (NaCl) data, the changes in the morphological and electrical properties of the synthesized NF membranes were deduced by employing the combination of irreversible thermodynamic model, Steric-Hindrance Pore (SHP) model and Teorell–Meyer–Sievers (TMS) model. In NF membrane characterization, three important parameters have been identified as an effective pore radius (rp), the ratio of effective thickness over porosity (Δx/Ak) and an effective charged density (Xd). In this study, it was observed that the variation of reaction times and TEOA monomer concentrations affect the properties of the membrane produced and affect water permeabilities and solute rejection as well. The salt rejection order of the membrane changed from 0. 001 M Na 2 SO 4 > 0. 1 M Na 2 SO 4 > 0. 001 M NaCl> 0. 1 M NaCl. Moreover, pH of humic acid solution {{plays an important role in}} flux reduction and fouling. HA filtration analysis was preferably chosen at pH 7 (4 % 35 min) and pH 3 (4 % 15 min) respectively It observes that all nine membranes able to removes humic acid with an efficiency of approximately 98 % and were capable of reducing initial concentrations of 15 mg/L at the TEOA monomer concentration (6 % w/v TEOA) and reaction time (35 min) ...|$|R
