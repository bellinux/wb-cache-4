40|$|AbstractThis article {{outlines}} {{advances in}} thematic progression {{theory in the}} hope they {{may be useful to}} teachers of writing, especially with non-native and non-European students. Thematic progression denotes the strategies available to writers for linking the <b>themes</b> <b>and</b> <b>rhemes</b> in a clause to those of surrounding clauses. It is a key factor in the structuring of information because it acts as a bridge between sentence level and discourse level, coordinating cohesion and coherence. This paper compares the use of thematic progression in essays by students on a course leading to MA studies in journalism, media and communications with that in two leading British newspapers. It considers how assignment writing could be improved generally by teaching the rudiments of progression theory. If students' assignments are to be clear in their development but also varied and interesting for the reader, additional progression skills are required. In particular, this paper recommends certain variations on Daneš' progression types, as well as the use of more breaks (non-participant themes) to mark rhetorical transitions in the text. Familiarisation with the thematic progression in tabloids and broadsheets, respectively, should provide an overview of a range of progression from formal to outspoken, which would raise awareness of what is available, even if not all elements are appropriate for all types of academic writing...|$|R

30|$|Traditional Arab Grammarians (TAGs), namely Basra and Kufa Schools, {{have defined}} the mubtada’, or theme, in Arabic as a {{definite}} pre-verbal, or initial, noun displaying the nominative case marker u, and the khabar, rheme, as whatever comes after the mubtada’. The TAGs’ approach to <b>theme</b> <b>and</b> <b>rheme</b> analysis {{has been criticized}} for a number of reasons. Firstly, modern Arab grammarians criticize TAGs for analysing <b>theme</b> <b>and</b> <b>rheme</b> grammatically, rather than semantically or pragmatically. According to Abdul-Raof (1998), <b>theme</b> <b>and</b> <b>rheme</b> in classical Arabic grammar are morpho-syntactic notions which rely heavily upon case marking. Moutaouakil (1989) also criticizes the TAGs’ association of theme with definiteness. Theme is presupposed as known or old information despite {{the fact that there are}} cases where theme can display unknown information in clause-initial position. Secondly, traditional, and most modern, Arab grammarians have been criticized for analysing <b>theme</b> <b>and</b> <b>rheme</b> in Arabic on a sentence basis. Abdul-Raof (1998) points out that the analysis has so far been confined to isolated sentences with no consideration of text-types, genre, or the contextual situation of the real event. All three aspects are taken into consideration in this paper. Thirdly, in the view of TAGs, conjuncts and disjuncts are not integrated within the structure of the Arabic clause. Conjuncts and disjuncts do not function as theme or rheme nor do they comprise part of the thematic structure of the Arabic nominal clause. Moreover, fronted Adjuncts and fronted Complements whose use is marked in Arabic are not fully recognized by TAGs. TAGs account for the change of word sequence in nominal but not verbal clauses. For example, Adjuncts in nominal clauses, whether in front or final position, are considered as rheme or part of the rhematic elements, whereas Complements are treated the same in initial and final position. Finally, and most importantly, TAGs and most Arab linguists, including Abdul-Raof 1998 and Moutaouakil 1989, analyse theme as a nominal phrase, which occurs in nominal but not verbal clauses. News reports, like any text-type or genre in Arabic, contain both verbal and nominal clauses. We argued that verbal clauses, which are more frequently used in news reports, represent the basic, unmarked, structure in Arabic. However, these structures are not accounted for in terms of <b>theme</b> <b>and</b> <b>rheme.</b> The latter elements are considered as attributes of declarative nominal clauses, whereas imperative, interrogative and verbal clauses are considered themeless. Using approaches such as described to perform a comparative study of thematic structures in Arabic, or Arabic and English, would produce incomprehensive and incompatible results. Hence there is a need to find and develop a new approach by means of which all types of Arabic clauses, verbal and nominal, can be analysed.|$|E

Principally, Firbas distinguishes two types of the dynamic semantic scales: the Presentation Scale, in which a context-independent subject is presented on the scene, and the Quality Scale, where a specifying quality is ascribed to the subject.

40|$|This diploma essay {{contributes}} to the studies of the Czech word order. Its theoretical background {{is provided by the}} findings of the Czech school of functional sentence perspective (FSP), represented by Jan Firbas and Aleš Svoboda. Based on the material excerpted from the present-day Czech corpora SYN 2005, this paper presents a broad scale of word order varieties in Czech subordinate clauses. Special attention is paid to the word order position of the <b>theme</b> elements <b>and</b> the most common adverbial complements. In comparison to primary clause some differences are pointed out: The transit centre (or transit proper or theme proper) position in front of the <b>theme</b> centre <b>and</b> <b>rheme</b> is a characteristical feature of subordinate clause, whereas in the primary clauses it applies to rather limited number of clauses. The emotional (subjective) word order is often caused by unfitting allocation of information instead of emotional movement. The initial theme in the subordinate clause seems to be of higher degree of communicational dynamism (CD) compared to the primary clause. It proved useful to differentiate premedial theme (in front of transit centre), which has higher degree of CD than postmedial theme (behind transit centre). Influenced by the spoken language, final theme also occurs. The tension between FSP and [...] ...|$|R

Several grammar theories relate information structure and prosody, highlighting a major correspondence between <b>theme</b> <b>and</b> <b>rheme,</b> and intonation patterns. Although these theories have been successfully exploited in some specific speech synthesis applications, they are mainly based on short default-order sentences, which limits their expressiveness for real discourse with longer sentences and complex structures. This paper revises/nthese theories, identifying cases {{in which they are}} valid, and providing a new proposal for cases in which a more complex model is needed. Specifically, our experiments performed on real discourse from the Wall Street Journal corpus show that we need a model that: (1) foresees a hierarchical theme/rheme structure, and (2) introduces, apart from the traditional <b>theme</b> <b>and</b> <b>rheme,</b> a new element—the specifier.

Thematic progression, a concept introduced by FrantišekDaneš (1974), {{draws on the}} theory of functional sentence perspective (FSP). According to FSP, overwhelming majority of sentences contain the <b>theme</b> <b>and</b> the <b>rheme,</b> i. e. elements carrying the lowest and the highest degree of communicative dynamism (CD), respectively. Despite being the least dynamic element, the theme {{plays an important role}} in the organization of the text; its progression throughout the text notably contributes to textual cohesion. The empirical part of the thesis is based on Peter H. Friesʼs (1995) assumption that patterns of thematic progression (TP) do not occur randomly, but different patterns of thematic progressions correlate with different genres. The aim of the thesis is to ascertain which pattern of thematic progression might be specific for the newspaper genre. For this purpose, thematic progression will be observed in two different journals - USA Today and New York Times - concerning the same subject matter; the 2016 US presidential election.
