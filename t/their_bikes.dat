5|$|In May and June 2015 cyclists {{were allowed}} to board the trams with <b>their</b> <b>bikes,</b> during a trial period which was {{supported}} by cycle campaign groups Spokes and Pedal on Parliament. Following this, Edinburgh trams became the first light rail network in the UK to permit the carriage of bikes on a permanent basis, with up to two bicycles being allowed per tram outwith peak hours (7.30am to 9.30am, and 4pm to 6.30pm) and excluding the festival period (7−31 August) and other large events.|$|E
5|$|The race's fifth {{stage is}} {{considered}} to be the first real mountain stage in Giro d'Italia history. The stage contained the climb of the Sestriere which rises over 2,000 meters. As the race entered the Val Chisone leading up the Sestriere, the peloton ran into muddy roads, which forced many to walk <b>their</b> <b>bikes.</b> Frenchman Lucien Petit-Breton led the riders up the slopes before cracking near the snowy summit. He was passed first by Ezio Corlaita, who was the first to summit the Sestriere, and then by many other riders. Petit-Breton caught up with the leading riders on the long descent and rode into the finish in Turin with Corlaita, Rossignoli, and Galetti. Petit-Breton edged out Galetti for the stage win as Galetti tied Rossignoli for the overall lead.|$|E
5|$|Realizing that Roberts {{needed more}} help if his racing career {{was going to}} progress, Aksland {{introduced}} Roberts to airline pilot and amateur motorcycle racer Jim Doyle, who would become Roberts' personal manager. In 1971, Doyle and Roberts approached Triumph's American distributor {{to ask about the}} possibility of a sponsored ride, but were told that Roberts was too small for one of <b>their</b> <b>bikes.</b> They then turned to the American Yamaha importer's team, who agreed to make Roberts a factory sponsored rider at the age of 19. Yamaha asked the head of their American racing program, former 250cc world champion Kel Carruthers to help guide Roberts' racing career. It marked the beginning of a long and productive relationship between the two men. Carruthers ended his riding career after the 1973 season to concentrate full-time on managing Roberts' and Yamaha's efforts in the A.M.A. Grand National Championship, a series which encompassed events in four distinctive dirt track disciplines plus road racing.|$|E

5|$|The {{plans for}} bicycling {{included}} a suspension ramp {{that would allow}} bicyclists to leave the Big Four Bridge without dismounting <b>their</b> <b>bikes.</b> Due {{to the length of}} time any new downtown bridge would take to be built, and needing an alternative for cyclists and pedestrians to get across the Ohio River when the George Rogers Clark Bridge is closed, which happens yearly during Thunder Over Louisville, bicyclists preferred the idea of converting the Big Four rather than relying on a new downtown bridge or the Clark Bridge. By mid-July 2009, work had begun to convert the bridge to a pedestrian walkway. With the approach ramps, the bridge upon completion of work was to span about 1 mile. In February 2013, pedestrians were allowed to access the completed bridge from the ramp on the Kentucky side with construction still continuing on the Indiana ramp. The Indiana ramp opened on May 20, 2014. Lighting along the bridge is required for safety and had been redesigned to please nearby residents. Originally, the lighting was to be similar to those on the Kentucky side, which has computer-controlled lights that can show various colors. The Indiana construction also had to be cautious of historic properties.|$|E

25|$|The Koppenberg {{has been}} dropped some years {{because it was}} deemed too {{difficult}} and too dangerous. Particularly when wet weather had made the cobbles slippery, {{it was hard for}} riders to take the steep slopes all the way riding. One rider falling could bring many others down and, in turn, halt those behind, who often had to shoulder <b>their</b> <b>bikes</b> and run up the remainder of the hill. In 1984 only two riders– Phil Anderson and Jan Raas– got to the top on <b>their</b> <b>bikes.</b> In 1987 Danish rider Jesper Skibby slipped and fell on the slick cobbles, before being run over by an official's car who tried to pass him. The climb was subsequently banned from the Tour of Flanders for the next 15 years.|$|E
5000|$|One {{can prevent}} bicycle theft by {{avoiding}} using bicycles with quick release wheels, {{as these are}} easy for anyone to take off {{without the use of}} any tools. Furthermore, one should use a strong U-lock to secure <b>their</b> <b>bike.</b> One should only lock <b>their</b> <b>bike</b> to sturdy structures and should not leave the bike in one place for too long.|$|R

25|$|Relatively new to Laredoans, this {{mountain}} bike trail is approximately 4 miles of single-track dirt trails, widening occasionally to double-track. Some technical parts make this trail challenging, {{but not impossible}} for beginners who can briefly walk <b>their</b> <b>bikes</b> before getting on their way again. Thorned shrubs and cacti encompass bikers, so be careful! The trail is well-marked and improvements continue {{to be seen as}} the months go by. The trail is located off Shiloh Road at the end of Livingston Road.|$|E
25|$|Inspired {{by these}} results, and after once again {{improving}} <b>their</b> <b>bikes,</b> Laverda entered 20 bikes {{the following year}} in the 15th running of the Milan-Taranto in 1952. In this race which covered a distance of 1410km they took the first five places. The winner was Nino Castellani, L. Marchi came second and F. Diolio came third. In total they had 16 bikes amongst the first 20 of the classification. Laverda motorcycles thus became a firm favorite among racing clubmen due to their record for reliable performance.|$|E

Four indicate health issues as a reason, whereas four others state that even though cycling is a valid alternative for short-distance trips, it still does not play any role in their daily routines. An important precondition for bike use is of course the residential location and the location of the required urban amenities and destinations.|$|R

25|$|The new Nova Bus LFS {{articulated}} buses came factory-equipped with bike racks, {{as do the}} non-articulated LFS buses entering service in 2015. These racks were sealed in October 2014 by order of the Ministry of Labour, due to concerns about bikes on the racks obscuring the drivers' view. In May 2015, the slot closer to the bus was authorised for use. The other is sealed off with metal panels, and the retention hooks have been removed. Once the first slot is full, cyclists may bring <b>their</b> <b>bikes</b> inside the articulated bus during off-peak hours, at the driver's discretion.|$|E
25|$|Most Danes {{are active}} cyclists, often using <b>their</b> <b>bikes</b> to commute {{to work or}} to go off on trips at the weekend. With its well-engineered cycle paths, Copenhagen is {{especially}} suited to city cycling. Every day 1.3 million km are cycled in the city, with 36% of all citizens commuting to work, school or university by bicycle. Cycling is generally perceived as a healthier, environmentally friendlier, cheaper and often quicker way around town than by public transport or car and it is therefore municipal policy {{for the number of}} commuters by bike to go up to 40% by 2012 and 50% by 2015.|$|E
25|$|Conditions {{improved}} in the 1930s and riders {{were allowed to}} accept a rain jacket, a spare tyre and a pump, but only in an emergency and at the judges' discretion. A change of bike was allowed only if a frame, wheel or handlebar broke, but riders were still expected to ride with spare tyres and a pump. Riders in the 1940s had to hand <b>their</b> <b>bikes</b> to officials {{the day before the}} race to have them identified with a lead seal, later with a ring similar to that fitted to racing pigeons. In that way the judges, or commissaires, could see if a rider had illegally changed bikes.|$|E

25|$|In {{terms of}} infrastructure, the city aims {{to build up}} a network of {{distinctive}} bicycle routes in order to achieve these objectives. At a final stage, the network will consist of main routes (Hauptrouten) for everyday use and comfort routes (Komfortrouten), with the latter focussing on leisure cycling. Additional measures such as special Velostationen providing bike related services are expected to help to further improve the quality. One of the key projects of the system is a tunnel beneath the tracks of the main railway station planned to combine a main connection with staffed possibilities where commuters can leave <b>their</b> <b>bikes</b> throughout the day. Apart from infrastructural measures, further approaches are planned in the fields of communication, education and administration.|$|E
25|$|Bicycles and {{tricycles}} {{are popular}} for getting {{around on the}} dry lake. Mountain bikes are generally preferred over road bikes for riding on the dried silt, which is normally hard but becomes loose with traffic. Participants often decorate <b>their</b> <b>bikes</b> to make them unique. Since lighting on the bikes is critically important for safety at night, many participants incorporate the lighting into their decorations, using electroluminescent wire (a thin, flexible tube that glows with a neon-like effect when energized with electricity) to create intricate patterns over {{the frame of the}} bike. Every night during Burning Man, thousands of bikes and art cars drive around, creating a visual display similar to Las Vegas at night, except that the lights are mobile.|$|E
25|$|Little 500 {{bikes are}} rather distinctive. They are single gear, coaster brake racing bicycles. There are two {{different}} versions of the bike: the men's and the women's. The only difference between the men's and women's bikes is the frame size; the men race on a 56 cm frame, the women's bikes are built on 54 cm frames. Men and women race on the same 46x18 gearing. Every year {{a new version of the}} bike is made and then two are given to each team. The cost of the bikes are, for the most part, covered in the team registration fees and race sponsorship money. At the end of the season, team's are given the option to keep <b>their</b> <b>bikes</b> or to sell them back to IUSF. The used bikes are then kept at the track and are rented out by those teams that do not have old bikes.|$|E
