5|$|Because of {{the steep}} {{elevation}} increase around the pass, the vegetation graduates from sub-tropical forest at its base, to a temperate region, to a {{wet and dry}} alpine climate, and finally to cold tundra desert devoid of vegetation. Around Nathu La and the Tibetan side, <b>the</b> <b>region</b> <b>has</b> little vegetation besides scattered shrubs. Major species found in the region include dwarf rhododendrons (Rhododendron anthopogon, R. setosum) and junipers. The meadows include the genera Poa, Meconopsis, Pedicularis, Primula, and Aconitum. <b>The</b> <b>region</b> <b>has</b> a four-month growing season during which grasses, sedges, and medicinal herbs grow abundantly and support a host of insects, wild and domestic herbivores, larks, and finches. The nearby Kyongnosla Alpine Sanctuary has rare, endangered ground orchida and rhododendrons interspersed among tall junipers and silver firs.|$|E

5|$|Northwest Argentina is {{predominantly}} dry, hot, and subtropical. Owing to its rugged and varied topography, {{the region is}} climatically diverse, depending on the altitude, temperature and distribution of precipitation. Consequently, the vegetation will also differ. Under the Köppen climate classification, <b>the</b> <b>region</b> <b>has</b> five different climate types: semi–arid (BS), arid (BW), temperate without a dry season and temperate with a dry season (Cf and CW respectively), and, at the highest altitudes, an alpine.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>region</b> <b>has</b> {{numerous}} faults, many considered active, {{but none}} has produced significant earthquakes in recorded history. These faults tend {{to move at}} a smooth rate in what is termed fault creep, which {{reduces the risk of}} an earthquake.|$|E
5|$|The {{vegetation}} of Strandzha evolved {{before the}} formation of the Bosphorus Strait when the whole southern Black Sea coast was linked and represents the westernmost extension of the Euxine-Colchic ecoregion. Because of the proximity of three seas, the Black Sea, the Marmara Sea and the Aegean Sea, Strandzha remained unaffected by the Quaternary glaciation and retained its mild and relatively humid climate. Under those conditions <b>the</b> <b>region</b> <b>has</b> preserved relict species from the Neogene.|$|E

5|$|Despite the low precipitation, Patagonia is cloudy, {{with the}} mean cloud cover ranging from 50% in eastern parts of Neuquén Province and {{northeast}} Río Negro Province to 70% in Tierra del Fuego Province; <b>the</b> <b>region</b> <b>has</b> {{one of the}} highest percentages of cloud cover in Argentina. In general, mountainous areas are the cloudiest, and coastal areas are cloudier than inland areas. Northern areas are sunnier (50% possible sunshine) than the southern parts of the region such as western Santa Cruz and Tierra del Fuego Provinces (less than 40% possible sunshine). The southernmost islands receive some of the lowest average annual sunshine hours in the world.|$|E
5|$|It has a humid {{subtropical}} climate (Cfa {{according to the}} Köppen climate classification). whose main features are high temperatures and abundant rainfall throughout the year. This year-round rainfall occurs {{because most of the}} region lies north of the subtropical high pressure belt even in winter, exposing it to moist easterly winds from the Atlantic Ocean throughout the year. Water deficiencies and extended periods of drought are uncommon, and much of <b>the</b> <b>region</b> <b>has</b> a positive water balance (i.e. the precipitation exceeds the potential evapotranspiration).|$|E

Along with the Hoover Dam and Nellis Air Force Base, <b>the</b> <b>region</b> <b>has</b> additional landmarks, including its own vaults and the HELIOS One solar energy plant.|$|E
5|$|Northwest Argentina is {{predominantly}} dry, hot, and subtropical. Owing to its rugged topography, {{the region is}} climatically diverse, depending on the altitude, temperature, and distribution of precipitation. Consequently, vegetation differs within these different climate types. In general, the climate {{can be divided into}} two main types: a cold arid or semi-arid climate at the higher altitudes, and warmer subtropical climate in the eastern parts of the region. Under the Köppen climate classification, <b>the</b> <b>region</b> <b>has</b> 5 different climate types: semi–arid (BS), arid (BW), temperate climate without a dry season and with a dry season (Cf and CW respectively), and an alpine climate at the highest altitudes.|$|E
5|$|Providing an {{adequate}} water supply for Hong Kong {{has always been}} difficult because <b>the</b> <b>region</b> <b>has</b> few natural lakes and rivers, inadequate groundwater sources (inaccessible in most cases due to the hard granite bedrock found in most areas in the territory), a high population density, and extreme seasonable variations in rainfall. Thus about 70 percent of water demand is met by importing water from the Dongjiang River in neighbouring Guangdong province. In addition, freshwater demand is curtailed {{by the use of}} seawater for toilet flushing, using a separate distribution system.|$|E

5|$|The Chronister dig site {{is located}} atop the Ripley Formation. The land around the Chronister home and dig site sits atop {{sandstone}} from the Lower Ordovician Period or Canadian Epoch. It {{is located in}} a section of the Ozarks affected by erosion and filled with chert and sandstone debris. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>region</b> <b>has</b> been impacted by frequent faulting, leading to the combination of rocks from different geologic periods.

5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature has {{listed the}} milk shark under Least Concern; despite being heavily fished, {{it has a}} wide {{distribution}} and remains fairly common. The reproductive characteristics of this species suggests {{it is capable of}} withstanding a somewhat high level of exploitation, though not as much as the grey sharpnose shark (R. oligolinx) or Australian sharpnose shark (R. taylori). In the 1980s and early 1990s, stock assessments of the milk shark off India's Verval coast concluded catches by gillnet and trawl fisheries were below the maximum sustainable level. However, these studies were based on methodologies that have subsequently been proven unreliable for shark populations. Moreover, fishing pressure in <b>the</b> <b>region</b> <b>has</b> increased substantially since the assessments were conducted.|$|E
