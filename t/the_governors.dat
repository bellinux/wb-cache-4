5|$|In 1963, Rangers {{governor}} William Jennings {{introduced to}} his peers {{the idea of}} expanding the league to the American West Coast by adding two new teams for the 1964–65 season. While <b>the</b> <b>governors</b> did not agree to the proposal, the topic of expansion came up every time the owners met from then on out. In 1965, {{it was decided to}} expand by six teams, doubling the size of the NHL. In February 1966, <b>the</b> <b>governors</b> met and decided to award franchises to Los Angeles, Minnesota, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Oakland and St. Louis. The league rejected bids from Baltimore, Buffalo and Vancouver. In Canada, there was widespread outrage over the denial of an expansion team to Vancouver in 1967; three years later, the NHL awarded a franchise to Vancouver, which formerly played in the Western Hockey League, for the 1970–71 season, along with the Buffalo Sabres.|$|E
50|$|Oklahoma {{also has}} nine other {{independent}} executive offices {{that do not}} owe loyalty to <b>the</b> <b>governor</b> as they are elected statewide and exercise authority outside the control of <b>the</b> <b>governor.</b> <b>The</b> general rule is that, while independent of <b>the</b> <b>governor,</b> <b>the</b> other statewide executive officers are {{at the disposal of}} <b>the</b> <b>governor</b> as he is the chief executive. This is enforced through statutory restriction on the independent offices authority to act without <b>the</b> <b>governor's</b> approval and <b>the</b> ability of <b>the</b> <b>governor</b> to force <b>the</b> independent offices to act according to his will. The greatest power of <b>the</b> <b>governor</b> over <b>the</b> independent executive offices is <b>the</b> <b>governor's</b> ability to determine each office's annual budget.|$|R
25|$|The {{executive}} branch {{is headed by}} <b>the</b> <b>governor</b> who serves as both head of state and head of government. <b>The</b> lieutenant <b>governor</b> {{may or may not}} have executive authority depending on whether the person is a member of <b>the</b> <b>Governor's</b> cabinet.

5|$|Michigan {{was part}} of colonial New France until the Treaty of 1763 {{transferred}} ownership to the Kingdom of Great Britain.

The 1783 Treaty of Paris ceded the territory that is now Michigan to the United States {{as part of the}} end of the Revolutionary War, but British troops were not removed from the area until 1796. During the British ownership, their governors administrated the area as part of the Canadian territorial holdings.|$|E
5|$|The Governor didn't {{have the}} right to make or suspend any laws, unless in cases of urgent necessity, he could do it with the consent of the Governor-General of India. He didn't have the power of {{creating}} a new office, or granting any salary, gratuity, or allowance, without the sanction of the Governor-General of India. The Governor-General had full power to superintend and control the Governor in all points relating to the civil or military administration of the Presidency, and the Governor had to obey the orders and instructions of the Governor-General in all cases. <b>The</b> <b>Governors</b> could propose to the Governor-General drafts of any laws which they thought expedient, together with their reasons for the same; and the Governor-General communicated the resolutions to the Governor, after considering the reasons. <b>The</b> <b>Governors</b> regularly transmitted to the Governor-General true copies of all orders and acts of their governments, and also advice of all matters which they felt to be communicated to the Governor-General. The powers of <b>the</b> <b>Governors</b> were not suspended when the Governor-General visited the Presidency. The departure of the Governor from India with intent to return to Europe was deemed to be a resignation from his office. Alternately, the Governor could resign by declaring it in writing and delivering it to the secretary for the public department of the Presidency.|$|E
5|$|The act {{gave the}} new school {{an annual budget of}} £900 (around £75,000 in 2008) from the bequest while <b>the</b> <b>governors</b> of the City of London Corporation School, who still wanted to {{implement}} their original idea, gained nothing, only retaining the old workhouse income. Both Hale and the Corporation of London were also eager to create this second school, which <b>the</b> <b>governors</b> of the City of London Corporation School had proposed. Despite their efforts, the other school was not founded until 1854, as the Freemen's Orphanage School, in Brixton with Hale as chairman. The Freemen's Orphanage School still exists today as the City of London Freemen's School in Surrey.|$|E

25|$|A {{lieutenant}} governor can {{also serve as}} Acting Governor.

5|$|The {{foundation}} document stipulated that fees {{were to be}} fixed by <b>the</b> <b>governors</b> and could range from £4–8 per year; in 1888, the fees charged were £7/10s per year.

Around the turn of the 20thcentury, an attempt was made to attract younger boys into the school by reducing fees for those under the age of 12 from £2/20s to £2 per term.|$|E
5|$|The {{state governments}} are {{structured}} in roughly similar fashion; Nebraska uniquely has a unicameral legislature. The governor (chief executive) of each state is directly elected. Some state judges and cabinet officers are appointed by <b>the</b> <b>governors</b> {{of the respective}} states, while others are elected by popular vote.|$|E
5|$|Another issue {{concerned}} {{the election of}} the president. Few agreed with Madison that the executive should be elected by the legislature. There was widespread concern with direct election, because information diffused so slowly in the late 18th century, and because of concerns that people would only vote for candidates from their state or region. A vocal minority wanted the national executive to be chosen by <b>the</b> <b>governors</b> of the states.|$|E

5|$|As a governor, Rodríguez Saá {{attracted}} huge {{investments to}} the province, {{which led to}} the growth of local industries, public works, social services and tourism.
