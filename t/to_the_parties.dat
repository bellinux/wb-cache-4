25|$|It is {{only fair}} {{to admit that}} the task of imputing an {{intention}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>parties</b> in the third situation presents the courts with another opportunity for uncertainty and arbitrariness, but this overall approach is nevertheless felt to be the lesser of the available evils.|$|E
25|$|When the {{decision-maker}} has a pecuniary {{or personal}} interest in relation <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>parties</b> in the decision, {{he or she will}} be disqualified from making the decision on the basis that there is imputed bias. If the adjudicator has a pecuniary interest in the case, however small the interest is, it will be enough for the decision to be set aside. As for a personal interest, if it can be shown that, for example, an adjudicator has already indicated partisanship by expressing opinions antagonistic or favourable <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>parties</b> before him, or has made known his views about the merits of the very issue or issues of a similar nature {{in such a way as}} to suggest prejudgment, or because of his personal relationship with a party, the court is likely to impute bias.|$|E

25|$|Consider a {{customer}} purchasing an item which costs five pence, who possesses several silver sixpence coins. Some of these coins are more debased, {{while others are}} less so – but legally, they are all mandated to be of equal value. The customer would prefer to retain the better coins, and so offers the shopkeeper the most debased one. In turn, the shopkeeper must give one penny in change, and has every reason to give the most debased penny. Thus, the coins that circulate in the transaction will tend {{to be of the}} most debased sort available <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>parties.</b>|$|E
25|$|In Spring 1964, Johnson did {{not look}} optimistically upon the {{prospect}} of being elected president in his own right. A pivotal change took place in April when he assumed personal management of negotiations between the railroad brotherhood and the railroad industry over the issue of featherbedding. Johnson emphasized <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>parties</b> the potential impact upon the economy of a strike. After considerable horse trading, especially with the carriers who won promises from the president for greater freedom in setting rights and more liberal depreciation allowances by the IRS, Johnson got an agreement. This substantially boosted his self-confidence as well as his image.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to a pecuniary interest, other forms of personal interest that an adjudicator has in a decision may {{give the impression that}} he or she is biased. As the High Court stated in Re Singh Kalpanath (1992), a likelihood of bias may arise because an adjudicator (1) has already indicated partisanship by expressing opinions antagonistic or favourable <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>parties</b> before him; (2) has made known his views about the merits of the very issue or issues of a similar nature in such a way as to suggest prejudgment; or (3) has a personal relationship with the party or there is close kinship between the adjudicator and a party.|$|E
25|$|According to the Constitution, the President Elect {{must take}} the Oath of Office on December 1, before {{a joint session of}} Congress; the Constitution also states that the presidential term begins on December 1.

According to the Constitution, if the elected president does not take the Oath of Office on 1 December before a joint session, the presidency is declared vacant and an interim president must be named and new elections called.|$|E
25|$|Afghanistan was {{traditionally}} {{divided into}} provinces governed by centrally appointed governors with considerable autonomy in local affairs. There are currently 34 provinces. During the Soviet occupation {{and the development}} of country-wide resistance, local areas came increasingly under the control of mujaheddin groups that were largely independent of any higher authority; local commanders, in some instances, asserted a measure of independence also from the mujaheddin leadership in Pakistan, establishing their own systems of local government, collecting revenues, running educational and other facilities, and even engaging in local negotiations. Mujaheddin groups retained links with the Peshawar parties to ensure access to weapons that were doled out <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>parties</b> by the government of Pakistan for distribution to fighters inside Afghanistan.|$|E
