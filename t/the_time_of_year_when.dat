5|$|Aphids: There {{are five}} species of aphids {{commonly}} found on apples: apple grain aphid, rosy apple aphid, apple aphid, spirea aphid and the woolly apple aphid. The aphid species {{can be identified}} by their color, <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>year</b> <b>when</b> they are present and by differences in the cornicles, which are small paired projections {{from the rear of}} aphids. Aphids feed on foliage using needle-like mouth parts to suck out plant juices. When present in high numbers, certain species reduce tree growth and vigor.|$|E
5|$|The 1953 Pacific {{hurricane}} season {{was the least}} active season on record. The season officially began on May 15 in the northeast Pacific Ocean and on June 1 in the central northern Pacific. They ended on November 30. These dates conventionally delimit <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>year</b> <b>when</b> most tropical cyclones form in northeast Pacific Ocean. Before the satellite age started in the 1960s, data prior to that time on Pacific hurricanes is extremely unreliable as most east Pacific storms are of no threat to land.|$|E
5|$|He {{opened his}} first Butlin's camp at Ingoldmells, near Skegness, on 11 April 1936 (Easter eve). It was officially opened by Amy Johnson, {{the first woman}} to fly solo from England to Australia. An {{advertisement}} costing £500 (2011:£) was placed in the Daily Express, announced the opening of the camp, inviting the public to book for a week's holiday. The advertisement offered holidays with three meals a day and free entertainment with a week's full board cost anything from 35 shillings to £3 (2011:£), according to <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>year.</b> <b>When</b> the camp opened, Butlin realised that his guests were not engaging with activities in the way he had planned; most kept to themselves, and others looked bored. He asked Norman Bradford (who was engaged as an engineer constructing the camp) to take on the duty of entertaining the guests, which he did with a series of ice breakers and jokes. By {{the end of the night}} the camp was buzzing and the Butlin's atmosphere was born. From that point on, entertainment was the very heart of Butlins and Bradford became the first of the Butlin's Redcoats. The same night Butlin decided that for his camp to work he would require many more people to carry out the same job as Bradford, and the role of Redcoat was conceived.|$|E

25|$|In Northern Alberta, oil {{development}} activities bring {{an enormous number}} of people into a fragile ecosystem. Historically, population figures have been very low for this region. Water is easily polluted because the water table reaches the surface in most areas of muskeg.

Woodland Caribou are particularly sensitive to human activities, and as such are pushed away from their preferred habitat during <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>year</b> <b>when</b> their caloric needs are greatest and food is the most scarce. Humans' effect on the Caribou is compounded by road construction and habitat fragmentation that open the area up to deer and wolves.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} the first {{original}} episode of The Office to be broadcast since the episode [...] "The Deposition" [...] on November 15, 2007, due {{to the effects of}} the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike. The Writers Guild of America (WGA) went on strike at 12:01AM Eastern Standard Time on November 5, 2007. Filming of The Office immediately halted on that date, as Steve Carell, {{who is a member of}} the WGA, refused to cross WGA picket lines. Members of Writers Guild of America, East and Writers Guild of America, West voted to end the 100-day strike on February 12, 2008. Writers were allowed to return to work on the same day. The WGA allowed for show runners to return to work on February 11, in preparation for the conclusion of the strike. The show runner for The Office, executive producer Greg Daniels, returned on February 11, while the show's writers returned to work on February 13. If not for the writers' strike, this episode would have completed filming successfully during the week of November 5, 2007.

[...] Grahamona arrived at the locks, but the water was too low to allow it to transit the locks.

2500|$|Theophilus {{recommends}} {{the use of}} beech logs, which analysis has shown has {{a high proportion of}} CaO when grown on calcareous soil. [...] Whatever wood is used, the amount of potash and CaO it provides, as well as other components that might affect colour and opacity, varies considerably with the age and part of the tree, soil chemistry, climate, <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>year</b> <b>when</b> the tree was cut and the dryness of the wood when burned, factors over which the glassmaker had little control. This variability explains the problems that glassmakers had in trying to produce glass of a consistent quality. Large amounts of ash would have to be prepared and mixed together to give the homogeneity needed to give a predictable glass composition. A typical yield of ash from beech is only about 1%, so using Theophilus' recipe of two parts of sand to one part of ash means it would take 63kg of beech wood to produce one kilo of glass. It has been estimated that, including fuel, 150–200kg of wood would be needed per kilo of glass.|$|E

40|$|Motivated by a matched {{case-control study}} to {{investigate}} potential {{risk factors for}} meningococcal disease amongst adolescents, we consider the analysis of matched case-control studies where disease incidence, and possibly other risk factors, vary with <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>year.</b> For <b>the</b> cases, <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> infection may be recorded. For controls, however, <b>the</b> recorded <b>time</b> is simply <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> data collection, which is shortly after <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> infection for <b>the</b> matched case, and so depends on the latter. We show {{that the effect of}} risk factors and interactions may be adjusted for <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>year</b> effect in a standard conditional logistic regression analysis without introducing any bias. We also show that, if <b>the</b> <b>time</b> delay between data collection for cases and controls is constant, provided this delay is not very short, estimates <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>year</b> effect are approximately unbiased. In the case that the length of the delay varies over <b>time,</b> <b>the</b> estimate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>year</b> effect is biased.
