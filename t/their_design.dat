The aluminium chassis components and body panels were manufactured and assembled at Abbey Panels factory in Coventry, before the body in white was delivered to the assembly plant at Bloxham. The car, including chassis and body components, consists of approximately 3000 unique parts.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{collapse}} of the Minneapolis I-35W arch-truss bridge on August 1, 2007, the Washington State Department of Transportation was directed to perform inspections of all steel cantilever bridges in the state that used gusset plates in <b>their</b> <b>design,</b> including the George Washington Memorial Bridge. The bridge had earlier been certified as structurally sound with no serious deficiencies detected.|$|E
50|$|In {{traditional}} Persian architecture, a dome {{is referred}} to as a gonbad (گنبد). The history of designing gonbads dates back to pre-Islamic Persia. The Parthians in particular were very keen in using such structures in <b>their</b> <b>designs.</b> The Sassanids inherited them and elevated <b>their</b> <b>designs</b> into full maturity.|$|R

5|$|Organ pipes {{are divided}} into flue pipes and reed pipes {{according}} to <b>their</b> <b>design</b> and timbre. Flue pipes produce sound by forcing air through a fipple, {{like that of a}} recorder, whereas reed pipes produce sound via a beating reed, like that of a clarinet or saxophone.|$|E
5|$|Other Japanese {{role-playing}} games would incorporate random dungeon generation {{as part of}} <b>their</b> <b>design,</b> mimicking part of {{the nature}} of roguelikes, and were considered roguelike titles when published in Western markets. Such titles include Vagrant Story, Shining Soul, and Baroque. The massively multiplayer online role playing game Final Fantasy XIV added a randomly-generated Deep Dungeon that was inspired by the procedural generation of roguelikes.|$|E
5|$|The castles of the Mary Rose had {{additional}} decks, {{but since}} virtually nothing of them survives, <b>their</b> <b>design</b> {{has had to}} be reconstructed from historical records. Contemporary ships of equal size were consistently listed as having three decks in both castles.

30|$|Engineers use {{investigation}} both to gain data {{essential for}} specifying design criteria or parameters and to test <b>their</b> <b>designs.</b> Like scientists, engineers must identify relevant variables, decide {{how they will}} be measured, and collect data for analysis. Their investigations help them to identify how effective, efficient, and durable <b>their</b> <b>designs</b> may be under a range of conditions.|$|R
5|$|After the First Crusade, Crusaders who did {{not return}} to their homes in Europe helped found the Crusader states of the Principality of Antioch, the County of Edessa, the Kingdom of Jerusalem, and the County of Tripoli. The castles they founded to secure their {{acquisitions}} were designed mostly by Syrian master-masons. <b>Their</b> <b>design</b> was very similar to that of a Roman fort or Byzantine tetrapyrgia which were square in plan and had square towers at each corner that did not project much beyond the curtain wall. The keep of these Crusader castles would have had a square plan and generally be undecorated.|$|E
5|$|Charles II was {{restored}} to the throne in 1660 and reduced both the size and the wages of the garrisons across the kingdom. The Device Forts initially remained {{at the heart of}} the defences along the south coast, but <b>their</b> <b>design</b> was by now badly antiquated. Deal continued to play an important role in defending the Downs during the Second and Third Dutch Wars, supported by local trained bands, and castles such as Hurst, Portland and Sandgate remained garrisoned. Others, however, were decommissioned with Sandsfoot closing in 1665 following a dispute over the control of the defences, and Netley being abandoned to fall into ruin.|$|E
5|$|Despite their {{technical}} complexity, neither {{device was}} revolutionary {{by the standards}} of the time. However, the total vision of <b>their</b> <b>design</b> was. Evans was attempting a radical shift in thinking about the manufacturing process, treating it as a continuous integrated whole rather than a series of isolated processes. Thus, manufacturing could be a fully automated production line. The missing link was materials handling, and Evans's mill designs sought to feed materials continuously through a system without the need for any human intervention. This was the first fully automated industrial process, and the idea of continuous production was proved to be a critical ingredient of the industrial revolution, and would ultimately lay the foundation for modern mass production.|$|E

5|$|During the 1930s the Japanese {{government}} {{adopted an}} ultranationalist militancy {{with a view}} to greatly expand the Japanese Empire. Japan withdrew from the League of Nations in 1934, renouncing its treaty obligations. After withdrawing from the Washington Naval Treaty, which limited the size and power of capital ships, the Imperial Japanese Navy began <b>their</b> <b>design</b> of the new Yamato class of heavy battleships. Their planners recognized Japan would be unable to compete with the output of U.S. naval shipyards should war break out, so the 70,000ton vessels of the Yamato class were designed to be capable of engaging multiple enemy battleships at the same time.|$|E
5|$|In <b>their</b> <b>design</b> of the reductions, the Jesuits were {{inspired}} by “ideal cities“ as outlined in works such as Utopia and Arcadia, written respectively by the 16th-century English philosophers Thomas More and Philip Sidney. The Jesuits had specific criteria for building sites: locations with plenty of wood for construction; sufficient water for the population; good soil for agriculture; and safety from flooding during the rainy season. Although most of the missions in the Chiquitania were relocated at least once {{during the time of}} the Jesuits, four of ten towns remained at their original sites. Wood and adobe were the main materials used in the construction of the settlements.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the aspects}} of <b>their</b> <b>design</b> {{ultimately}} were incorporated into the two , and they are often described as being a cut-down G3. Indeed, the Nelsons received the design designation 'O3', marking them as next in the design sequence from the 'N3' battleship design although they used the guns intended for the G3 class for cost reasons and {{to comply with the}} Treaty's 16-inch limitation on main armament.|$|E

5|$|Moltke and Goeben, {{improvements}} {{over the}} preceding Von der Tann, were ordered in 1908 and 1909, respectively. While <b>their</b> <b>design</b> {{was not as}} contentious as with the Von der Tann, there were still disagreements between Tirpitz and the General Navy Department over whether the main battery guns should be increased in number or caliber. Tirpitz favored the increase to ten guns, while the Navy Department preferred eight 30.5cm (12in) guns. It was eventually decided that ten 28cm guns would be mounted. In addition to the increased main battery, the two Moltke-class ships were slightly larger and better armored than Von der Tann.|$|E
5|$|The Ekaterina II {{class were}} {{a class of}} four battleships built for the Imperial Russian Navy in the 1880s. They were the first battleships built for the Black Sea Fleet. <b>Their</b> <b>design</b> was highly unusual in having the main guns on three barbettes grouped in a {{triangle}} around a central armored redoubt, two side-by-side forward {{and one on the}} centerline aft. This was intended to maximize their firepower forward, both when operating in the narrow waters of the Bosphorus and when ramming. Construction was slow because they were the largest warships built until then in the Black Sea and the shipyards had to be upgraded to handle them.|$|E
5|$|The Robillon wing {{contains}} an {{entrance to the}} palace reached by flights of ingeniously designed graduated steps. <b>Their</b> <b>design</b> creates an illusion of a longer and higher perspective, centred on a corner of a terrace because of exigencies of the site, and divided mid-flight {{so as not to}} lead the eye and footstep towards an angle of the colonnade beyond. The steps are adorned with elaborate statuary (see key 11). The bays of the façade are stuccoed rose-pink, contrasting with the motifs and pilasters in natural stone (see illustration).|$|E

5|$|The first {{committee}} {{to design the}} Great Seal of the United States was appointed on 4 July 1776 by the Second Continental Congress and consisted of Benjamin Franklin, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson. <b>Their</b> <b>design</b> was rejected on 20 August 1776. The second committee (James Lovell, John Morin Scott, and William Churchill Houston) design met with the same fate. It was the third committee (Arthur Middleton, Elias Boudinot, John Rutledge, who consulted with William Barton) that submitted a design which was approved on 20 July 1782.|$|E

For example, the ISS, Mars Odyssey and the Mars Global Surveyor are equipped with nickel-hydrogen batteries. In the dark part of its orbit, the Hubble Space Telescope is also powered by nickel-hydrogen batteries, which were finally replaced in May 2009, more than 19 years after launch and 13 years beyond <b>their</b> <b>design</b> life.|$|E
5|$|Unsurprisingly, the {{two teams}} found much to agree on. The French had no modern large jet engines, and had already {{concluded}} they would buy a British design anyway (as they had on the earlier subsonic Caravelle). As neither company had experience {{in the use of}} high-heat metals for airframes, a maximum speed of around Mach 2 was selected so aluminium could be used– above this speed the friction with the air warms the metal so much that aluminium begins to soften. This lower speed would also speed development and allow <b>their</b> <b>design</b> to fly before the Americans. Finally, everyone involved agreed that Küchemann's ogee shaped wing was the right one.|$|E

5000|$|Design {{patterns}} {{are composed of}} several sections (see [...] below). Of particular interest are the Structure, Participants, and Collaboration sections. These sections describe a design motif: a prototypical micro-architecture that developers copy and adapt to <b>their</b> particular <b>designs</b> to solve the recurrent problem described by the design pattern. A micro-architecture {{is a set of}} program constituents (e.g., classes, methods...) and their relationships. Developers use the design pattern by introducing in <b>their</b> <b>designs</b> this prototypical micro-architecture, which means that micro-architectures in <b>their</b> <b>designs</b> will have structure and organization similar to the chosen design motif.|$|R
