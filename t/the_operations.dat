40|$|ObjectiveWe {{investigated}} {{change in}} platelet activation using flow cytometry in patients {{before and after}} splenectomy with total gastrectomy for gastric cancer. MethodsSix patients who underwent splenectomy for lymphadenectomy with total gastrectomy for gastric cancer were the subjects in this study. In the patients, platelet count and platelet activation were evaluated before <b>the</b> <b>operation,</b> 1 week after <b>the</b> <b>operation,</b> and 1 month after <b>the</b> <b>operation.</b> Expression of CD 62 P (P-selectin) was analysed as a marker of platelet activation using flow cytometry. ResultsAlthough platelet count significantly increased 1 week after <b>the</b> <b>operation,</b> <b>the</b> platelet count 1 month after <b>the</b> <b>operation</b> did not increase significantly. Expression of CD 62 P (P-selectin) significantly decreased at 1 week and 1 month after <b>the</b> <b>operation,</b> compared with <b>the</b> level before <b>the</b> <b>operation.</b> No postoperative complications occurred in any patient. ConclusionIn the present study, platelet activation did not progress after <b>the</b> <b>operation.</b> <b>The</b> results mean {{that the risk of}} thrombosis after splenectomy does not increase...|$|R
