5|$|Beta: Arc Light of the Point of Infinity follows Mayuri, and {{is set in}} {{the beta}} attractor field, after Daru's future daughter, Suzuha Amane, brought Okabe back in time to save Kurisu; this is {{necessary}} to avoid a world line where Kurisu's time travel theories are stolen, resulting in an arms race leading up to World War III. Okabe fails at first, as world line convergence appears to make Kurisu's death inevitable; Suzuha is about to make him try one more time, but Mayuri stops her, as she thinks Okabe has suffered enough. Suzuha does not go back to the time she came from, still intending to get Okabe to try once more, but notes that {{due to a lack of}} fuel, the time machine will no longer be able to go back far enough after less than a year has passed. After that time is nearly up, Suzuha gets ready to travel back in time and try saving Kurisu herself, but Mayuri follows along. They arrive just after the past Suzuha and Okabe left to save Kurisu for the first time, and Mayuri tells her past self that she needs to get Okabe to try again. The scene from the beginning plays out again, but Mayuri slaps Okabe and tells him that he is not the type to give up. The future Mayuri and Suzuha leave before the past Okabe and Suzuha return, with too little fuel to be able to <b>tell</b> <b>where</b> they will end up.|$|E

50|$|Events can be {{described}} by light cones. The top of the light cone <b>tells</b> <b>where</b> {{the light from the}} event will travel, the bottom <b>tells</b> <b>where</b> the light was in the past, and the center is the event itself. Besides light cones, Hawking also talks about how light can bend. When light goes past a highly massive object, such as a star, the light changes direction slightly towards the object.|$|R

25|$|After {{the move}} to New York, Sun Ra and company plunged headlong into the experimentalism that they had only hinted at in Chicago. The music was often {{extremely}} loud and the Arkestra grew to include multiple drummers and percussionists. In recordings of this era, Ra began to use new technologies—such as extensive use of tape delay—to assemble spatial sound pieces that were far removed from earlier compositions such as Saturn. Recordings and live performances often featured passages for unusual instrumental combinations, and passages of collective playing that incorporated free improvisation. It {{is often difficult to}} <b>tell</b> <b>where</b> compositions end and improvisations begin.|$|E
25|$|The entire Early Dynastic {{period is}} {{generally}} dated to 2900–2350 BC {{according to the}} Middle Chronology, or 2800–2230 BC according to the Short Chronology. The Sumerians were firmly established in Mesopotamia {{by the middle of}} the 4th millennium BC, in the archaeological Uruk period, although scholars dispute when they arrived. It is hard to <b>tell</b> <b>where</b> the Sumerians might have come from because the Sumerian language is a language isolate, unrelated to any other known language. Their mythology includes many references to the area of Mesopotamia but little clue regarding their place of origin, perhaps indicating that they had been there for a long time. The Sumerian language is identifiable from its initially logographic script which arose last half of the 4th millennium BC.|$|E

25|$|Academic hoods in the United States are {{traditionally}} lined {{with the official}} colors of the school, in theory so watchers can <b>tell</b> <b>where</b> the hood wearer earned his or her degree. Amherst's hoods are purple (Williams' official color) with a white stripe or chevron, said to signify that Amherst was born of Williams. Amherst records {{one of the first}} uses of Latin honors of any American college, dating back to 1881. The college was an all-male school until the late 1960s, when a few female students from nearby schools in the Five-College Consortium attended on an experimental basis. In October 1974, the faculty voted in favor of coeducation and in November 1974 the board of trustees voted to admit female students starting in the 1975-1976 school year. In 1975, nine women who were already attending classes as part of an inter-college exchange program were admitted as transfer students. In June 1976, they became the first female graduates of the college.|$|E
500|$|The Chronicle was put {{together}} about four hundred years after these events. It is known that the annalists used material from earlier chronicles, {{as well as from}} oral sources such as sagas, but {{there is no way to}} <b>tell</b> <b>where</b> these lines came from. [...] It should also be noted that the terms 'British' and 'Welsh' were used interchangeably, as 'Welsh' is the Saxon word meaning 'foreigner', and was applied to all the native Romano-British of the era.|$|E

500|$|Western Chalukyan deity sculptures were well-rendered; {{exemplified}} best {{by that of}} Hindu goddess Sarasvati at the Sarasvati {{temple in}} Gadag city. Much of the drapery on the bust of the image is ornamentation comprising jewellery made of pearls around her throat. An elaborate pile of curls forms her hair, some of which trails to her shoulders. [...] Above these curly tresses and behind the head is a tiered coronet of jewels, the curved edge of which rises to form a halo.

500|$|The game's {{graphics}} {{were generally}} praised by critics. GameSpot's Andrew Park stated that virtually {{everything in the}} PC version [...] "looks bright, colorful and clean" [...] when playing in 3D-accelerated mode, but called its texturing minimal. GameSpot's Ben Stahl also called the N64 version's track design [...] "innovative and cute", as well as saying the tracks and backgrounds have a [...] "somewhat real look" [...] {{that makes it easier}} to <b>tell</b> <b>where</b> the player should be driving. IGN's reviewer for the PC version praised the game's background animations, stating that they not only [...] "add to the atmosphere of the game, but also affect the way it plays". However, some reviewers criticised the game's performance, with IGN's Sam Bishop stating that the PlayStation version's load times between levels are horrendous and Next Generation Chris Charla calling the N64 version's framerate [...] "nauseatingly slow". Conversely, IGN's Winnie Imperio called the N64 version's framerate [...] "consistent, if not entirely smooth".|$|E
500|$|The ported {{version of}} the game {{available}} in Sonic Gems Collection was more negatively reviewed. Eurogamer's Tom Bramwell called the game [...] "too awkward to play {{for any length of}} time", 1UP.com's Jeremy Parish stated [...] "The grainy visuals make it hard to <b>tell</b> <b>where</b> you're going, and the frustrating controls make it difficult to get there," [...] GameSpot's Ryan Davis described [...] "its laughably bad soundtrack" [...] as [...] "the game's only redeeming quality", and GameSpy's Phil Theobald called Sonic R [...] "a concept that works better in theory than in practice"—despite its [...] "fantastic (if not bizarre) soundtrack". In a 2003 retrospective, Game Informer described the game as [...] "decent, but unmemorable", while GamesRadar included Sonic R in a 2014 list of the top 50 Sega Saturn games, calling it [...] "a technical tour de force". GameTrailers ranked it as the second worst Sonic game, behind 2006's Sonic the Hedgehog. Game designer Hirokazu Yasuhara, who helped Traveller's Tales rework the game in response to concerns over the quality of a preview version, has maintained that [...] "the final version of Sonic R is actually quite good... However, I do admit that the base concept of Sonic R, in which a player 'drives' running characters, is not great".|$|E

However, she criticized the scenes of nudity noting: [...] "The rest of the video is pretty tame by Gaga standards." [...] Spins Marc Hogan wrote that [...] "it's hard to <b>tell</b> <b>where</b> Gaga is winking at us and where she's simply fallen into a foxhole of unrestrained ego." [...] Camille Mann of CBS News described the video as a [...] "avant-garde short film" [...] and noted that Gaga was [...] "pushing [...] boundaries." [...] Leah Collins of Dose compared Gaga's outfits with Christian Louboutin's designs. She further compared the set in the video to the cover artwork of Born This Way and called it a [...] "very fashionable recreation of Girl, Interrupted." [...] A writer of CNN commented, [...] "Lady Gaga is known for creating evocative mini-movies to provide the visuals for her singles, and 'Marry the Night' is no different." [...] Describing the video as [...] "rough" [...] and [...] "enigmatic", Liz Raftery of People further commened that it [...] "will certainly leave fans talking, if not scratching their heads." [...] An editor of ABC News praised Gaga's [...] "interesting perspective in the video." [...] NMEs Priya Elan wrote that Gaga sounds like [...] "a lobotomized Carrie Bradshaw" [...] during the introduction. He also commented, [...] "It's definitely an improvement on 'Judas', but could it maybe have been snipped a bit to make it shorter?" ...|$|E
