Many Gazans began <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> these vehicles have fuel themselves, as diesel was completely unavailable in Gaza, ambulances {{could no longer be}} used, but Hamas government officials still had fuel for their own cars. Many Gazans said that Hamas confiscated the fuel it needed from petrol stations and used it exclusively for their own purposes.|$|E
25|$|And it is {{occasionally}} visionary, as when Ludlow, {{decades before}} Albert Einstein {{would do the}} same, abandons {{the idea of the}} æther and muses that “e might be allowed to... assert that because our only cognitions of matter are cognitions of force, matter in the scientific sense is force.” He does not elaborate, and evidently the article was altered and cut for publication substantially, so we are left <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> far he pursued this idea of the equivalency of matter and energy.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes the narrator's {{unreliability}} is made immediately evident. For instance, a {{story may}} open with the narrator making a plainly false or delusional claim or admitting to being severely mentally ill, or {{the story itself}} may have a frame in which the narrator appears as a character, with clues to the character's unreliability. A more dramatic use of the device delays the revelation until near the story's end. In some cases, the reader discovers that in the foregoing narrative, the narrator had concealed or greatly misrepresented vital pieces of information. Such a twist ending forces readers to reconsider {{their point of view}} and experience of the story. In some cases the narrator's unreliability is never fully revealed but only hinted at, leaving readers <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> much the narrator should be trusted and how the story should be interpreted.|$|E

25|$|In 1535 {{the abbey}} was valued in the Valor Ecclesiasticus {{as having an}} income of £540, a very {{comfortable}} sum, which leads one <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> many of the abbey's financial problems were due to bad management. This figure meant that Vale Royal escaped being dissolved {{under the terms of}} the First Suppression Act, King Henry VIII's initial move in the Dissolution of the Monasteries. The last abbot was John Hareware (elected 1535), who had previously been abbot of Hulton Abbey. He pursued a two-pronged policy of attempting to ensure the survival of his abbey and, should that fail, the security of himself and his brethren thereafter. He bribed courtiers, influential nobles and in particular chief minister Thomas Cromwell with money and property in the hope of gaining respite; he also leased out most of the abbey lands to friends and associates of the monastery to keep them out of royal hands should the abbey fall (many of these leases had a clause which stated that they should be void if the abbey survived). He began to realise the other assets such as livestock and timber for cash.|$|E
500|$|She {{returned}} to the Sellafield issue in 2002, noting that while Ireland had no nuclear power plants itself, Belarus {{had been the most}} affected region even though Chernobyl was not in it, and that was [...] "exactly what could happen in Ireland if there was an explosion at Sellafield." [...] In addition, she feared the ongoing low-level emissions from Sellafield: [...] "I started <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> safe it was for [...] to play on the beach or to swim in the sea or even to eat fish." [...] In the aftermath of the 11 September 2001 attacks, she also viewed the plant as vulnerable to terrorists.|$|E
500|$|... "What is {{the point}} of life?" [...] is a {{question}} Vonnegut often pondered in his works. When one of Vonnegut's characters, Kilgore Trout, finds the question [...] "What is the purpose of life?" [...] written in a bathroom, his response is, [...] "To be the eyes and ears and conscience of the Creator of the Universe, you fool." [...] Marvin finds Trout's theory curious, given that Vonnegut was an atheist, and thus for him, there is no Creator to report back to, and comments that, [...] " [...] Trout chronicles one meaningless life after another, readers are left <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> a compassionate creator could stand by and do nothing while such reports come in." [...] In the epigraph to Bluebeard, Vonnegut quotes his son Mark, and gives an answer to what he believes is the meaning of life: [...] "We are here to help each other get through this thing, whatever it is." ...|$|E

500|$|FiringSquad said Freelancers {{multiplayer}} mode encapsulated the [...] "best {{and worst}} of [...] in a nutshell": although players can move their characters anywhere, group with others for missions, and trade ships and equipment, they have very little else {{to do in the}} unchanging virtual galaxy. [...] Despite these limitations, Stratos Group said the joy of playing with real-life counterparts is a positive factor; the NPC pilots are so inept that human-controlled pilots outperform them most of the time. [...] However, as the missions are practically the same, IGN and GameCritics.com questioned the point of playing them repeatedly with friends. [...] Furthermore, IGN thought it was meaningless to amass wealth and higher-grade equipment when they cannot be transferred to other servers. [...] The lack of substance and repetitiveness led the gaming site <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> long Freelancer can be viable as a commercial multiplayer product. [...] Whereas massively multiplayer online games such as EverQuest have thousands of players in a vast playing area, Freelancer can accommodate only up to 128; the loneliness of playing in such a sparsely populated virtual world gave UGO concern as well over the longevity of Freelancers multiplayer mode.|$|E
500|$|Casting Crowns {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Particular praise {{was given to}} the album's lyrical content and production quality. Ashleigh Kittle of Allmusic gave it 3 out of 5 stars, comparing the album's overall sound to that of Chapman, Caedmon's Call, and Phillips, Craig & Dean. Andy Argyrakis of CCM Magazine gave the album a B grade, praising the album as a [...] "promising freshman effort" [...] but critiquing its [...] "tendency to occasionally reflect its primary muse a bit too liberally". Belinda S. Ayers of Christian Broadcasting Network praised the album's lyrics and sound. Steve Best of Cross Rhythms gave Casting Crowns ten out of ten squares, saying, [...] "The passion of lead vocalist and youth pastor Hall jumps out of each set of lyrics, while Chapman's distinctive production touch...makes this a must listen album". While praising the album's overall production and lyrical content, Breimeier said the album [...] "too readily recalls the work of its producers, leaving us <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> much of it is really Casting Crowns" [...] – he gave the album 3.5 out of 5 stars. The album received positive reviews from Brian Mansfield of USA Today, Robin Parrish of CMCentral.com, and Michael Herman of Christianity Today.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} {{described}} as [...] "porn-tastic" [...] in a review for Now! Christmas 4 by Eye Weekly reviewer Chris Bilton, quoting the lyric [...] "My Christmas tree is delicious". Bilton also called it one of few tracks on the album that make it a [...] "worthy stocking stuffer". Also in a review for Now! Christmas 4, Charlottetown Guardian reviewer Doug Gallant called [...] "Christmas Tree" [...] a [...] "dreadful offering". Beverley Lunney, a reviewer for Winnipeg Free Press, gave the song a negative review, commenting that listeners would be [...] "offended" [...] by the song's [...] "truly unfestive metaphors" [...] and called it one of a [...] "sea of unbearable original tunes" [...] on Now! Christmas 4. Darryl Sterdan of the Ottawa Sun called the song [...] "the only reason to buy" [...] Now! Christmas 4 and recommended downloading it. In a review of Now! Christmas 4, John Lucas of The Georgia Straight described the song as a [...] "filthy electro banger" [...] and [...] "so blatantly about [...] that you have <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> in the hell it got past the usually vigilant Now! gatekeepers", calling it the [...] "single exception" [...] to an otherwise bland album. In a review for It's Christmas Time, Chester Chronicle reviewer Polly Weeks called the song something that [...] "will keep teenagers happy". In a review for Now That's What I Call Christmas! 4, J Matthew Cobb of HiFi Magazine called [...] "Christmas Tree" [...] part of a [...] "good list" [...] of new material and described it as [...] "naughty, but nice".|$|E

500|$|Gareth McLean of the Radio Times {{said that}} Lewis {{was a gentleman}} escort and he deemed him a [...] "suave companion." [...] A {{spokeswoman}} for the show said, [...] "There is no suggestion that Lewis is {{anything more than a}} companion escort for his clients." [...] A writer for the Metro described Lewis as [...] "charming" [...] and [...] "charismatic", and a reporter from the Daily Record wrote that he was [...] "Weatherfield's answer to American Gigolo." [...] The soap's official website lists [...] "ungallant behaviour" [...] as something Lewis dislikes. Havers believed Lewis would eventually display [...] "a real dark side", though he was unaware of what that could be. Lewis is first seen accompanying Claudia Colby (Rula Lenska) to a Christmas ball. He is introduced by Audrey Roberts; Digital Spy's Daniel Kilkelly stated that she was [...] "immediately bowled over by his charming ways." [...] Claudia informs Audrey that she booked Lewis through an agency and Audrey decides to hire Lewis to be her companion to another event. Lewis goes to the Rovers Return Inn and pretends not to know Audrey. He then proceeds to chat her up in front of her friends, causing them <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> she attracted him. Havers thought the scenes were funny and called the storyline between Lewis and Audrey [...] "fantastic". In March 2010, Lewis was seen advertising his escort service in society magazine, The Lady. A reporter for The Belfast Telegraph revealed the character's classified advert would be seen in the real life magazine in a crossover with the show. A spokeswoman for Coronation Street stated [...] "The Lady heard the magazine was going to feature in an episode, and they approached us with the idea of using the advert in the actual magazine." [...] In the advert, Lewis claims to have [...] "years of experience" [...] and is [...] "suitable to accompany ladies in any social or corporate event". On screen, Audrey's friend Rita Sullivan (Barbara Knox) notices the advert and books Lewis for a date.|$|E

2500|$|Her {{employment}} at Amnesty International made Rowling realise that [...] "imagination is what {{allows us to}} empathise {{with people who have}} suffered horribly and to act on their behalf." [...] The danger of inaction, Rowling said, comes from people who [...] "prefer not to exercise their imaginations at all. They choose to remain comfortably within the bounds of their own experience, never troubling <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> it would feel to have been born other than they are. They can refuse to hear screams or to peer inside cages. They can close their minds and hearts to any suffering that does not touch them personally; they can refuse to know.|$|E
