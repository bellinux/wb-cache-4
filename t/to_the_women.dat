5|$|As Petty gets {{further into}} his investigation, Rost's answers become more evasive. Petty {{suspects}} that Eric actually kills women for his snuff films, a suspicion further exacerbated when Rost {{says that he}} will relay Petty's contact information <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> instead of giving their contact information to Petty. It is not clear at the film's end whether Rost's films are actual snuff in the fictional subplot's context. However, {{it is known that}} he spies on them {{for a long period of}} time before asking them to participate.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} statues and {{memorials}} {{have been built}} on and around Whitehall, commemorating military victories and leaders. The Cenotaph was designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens and erected {{at the southern end}} in 1919, commemorating victory in World War I and later used as a memorial for both World Wars. It is the main war memorial in Britain and an annual service is held here on Remembrance Sunday, led by the reigning monarch and leading politicians.

5|$|After {{leaving the}} wrestling business, Greenwald has made {{sporadic}} wrestling appearances, {{acts as a}} landlady with regards to her property holdings, invests in real estate, and performs charity work.

5|$|Agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{investigate}} {{the birth of}} five babies {{in the town of}} Martinsburg, West Virginia, who were born with tails. The mother of the most recent baby, Amanda Nelligan, tells the agents that the father of her baby is Luke Skywalker. By researching the baby's chromosomes it is discovered that all five share the same father. The parents of the children blame the local fertility doctor, who had used insemination to impregnate all of the mothers but Nelligan. Mulder spots a janitor nearby with signs that he formerly had a tail. When he runs Mulder chases him and catches him. The janitor, Eddie Van Blundht, is discovered to be the father of all of the children. Scully believes Eddie used a date rape drug although Mulder questions how he could be in the position to give it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>women.</b>|$|E

All the women assure Michael that Jan's behavior is not normal and urge {{him to get out}} of the relationship. He remains conflicted about what he should do about Jan, but at Phyllis's prompting he finally admits to himself that he wants to break up with her. Michael thanks them for their help by treating them to one item each at Victoria's Secret. On the drive back, Pam takes a step toward asserting herself by changing a flat tire on Meredith Palmer's (Kate Flannery) car. At the office, Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) sneaks into the women's bathroom and discovers a plush waiting room. The other men soon join him.|$|E

Found distraught, Sandy receives treatment from Sharon and chief medical officer Karl (Barry Houghton), who discovers that the assault has triggered an accelerated pregnancy despite the regular intravenous injections of contraceptives given <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> in the team.

5|$|The minor inmates at the Castellania {{were the}} ones who took care of the general maintenance, {{cleaning}} and repair works of the building, while guards were responsible for the allocation of tasks and observing their performance. Some historical graffiti made by prisoners {{can be found at the}} courtyard of the prison. At the underground are the dungeons, which are described as an unpleasant place to stay. By the early 19th century, arrested females awaiting a court decision started to be sent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> prison at Corradino (now a police station) rather than accommodated at the Castellania.|$|E
5|$|The {{new focus}} was on women's self-discovery; and the ACWF {{launched}} the Four Self Campaign consisting of: self-respect, self-confidence, self-improvement, and self-reliance. An example of the ACWF balancing its government responsibilities with its responsibility <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> of China {{can be seen in}} the One-Child Policy. The ACWF was responsible for publicizing the policy and its content, but questioned if the policy respected the rights of women. In the end, the ACWF settled on requesting that its cadres comply with the law to set a good example for the country, to promote the One-Child policy to the Chinese women, and to strongly condemn any coercive action related to the policy.|$|E

5|$|The {{world of}} comic strips saw {{a number of}} works pop up. Ben Wicks was doing The Outsiders and Wicks, Jim Unger's Herman debuted in 1975, and Ted Martin's Pavlov in 1979. In 1978, Lynn Johnston, living in Lynn Lake, Manitoba, began For Better or For Worse, which was noted for {{following}} {{the lives of the}} Patterson family as they grew older in real time, and dealt with real-life issues. The strip based a number of its storylines on Johnston's real-life experiences with her own family, as well as social issues such as the midlife crisis, divorce, the coming out of a gay character, child abuse, and death. In 1985, she became the first female cartoonist to win a Reuben Award, and the Friends of Lulu added her <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Women</b> Cartoonists Hall of Fame in 2002. The strip was very popular, appearing in over 2000 newspapers in 25 countries.|$|E
5|$|When {{the crowd}} finally reached Versailles, it {{was met by}} another group that had {{assembled}} from the surrounding area. Members of the Assembly greeted the marchers and invited Maillard into their hall, where he fulminated about the Flanders Regiment and the people's need for bread. As he spoke, the restless Parisians came pouring into the Assembly and sank exhausted on the deputies' benches. Hungry, fatigued, and bedraggled from the rain, they seemed {{to confirm that the}} siege was a simple demand for food. The unprotected deputies {{had no choice but to}} receive the marchers, who shouted down most of the speakers and demanded to hear from the popular reformist deputy Mirabeau. The great orator declined this chance at demagoguery but nonetheless mingled familiarly with the market women, even sitting for some time with one of them upon his knee. A few other deputies welcomed the marchers warmly, including Maximilien Robespierre who was still at that time a relatively obscure figure in politics. Robespierre gave strong words of support <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> and their plight, and his efforts were received appreciatively; his solicitations helped greatly to soften the crowd's hostility towards the Assembly.|$|E
