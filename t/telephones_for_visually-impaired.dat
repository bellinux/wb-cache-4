We conducted an evaluation with eight visually-impaired children with a pre-test to assess their current skills with a set of character shapes, a training phase using McSig and then a post-test of the same character shapes to see if there were any improvements. The children could all use McSig and we saw significant improvements in the character shape...|$|R

40|$|Because reading groups {{historically}} have been under-researched (Long, 2003), {{the literature in}} this field is limited, presenting this as an interesting area for researchers. A need for further research is also {{explained by the fact}} that the traditional model of a reading group has been expanded through recent library policies leading to the development of specific group types such as groups <b>for</b> <b>visually-impaired</b> people (VIPs). To date, there have been no long-term empirical studies of these groups. This thesis, therefore, makes a significant contribution to the literature in this field by providing an in-depth exploration of a VIP reading group. The thesis is an ethnographic study which follows a library-run reading group <b>for</b> <b>visually-impaired</b> people from its formation in September 2007 and concentrates on five of the group members. The methodology for the study is influenced by participatory approaches to research involving disabled people by inviting the participants to participate in the co-creation of knowledge about themselves (French & Swain, 2000, p. 1). It is also influenced by new ethnography’s preference for multi-layered texts by exploring both the individual and collective experiences of the participants. While the participants are defined throughout as readers, visual-impairment plays a role in their experiences. I show that visually-impaired readers and reading groups sit within a complex web of factors which impact on their experiences both as individual readers and as a group. The study also shows that VIP reading groups challenge traditional definitions of reading as a visual activity. The study explores issues of power and concludes that, because ownership of the group lies with the library, this challenges the idea of reading groups empowering their members. Furthermore, offering discrete groups <b>for</b> <b>visually-impaired</b> readers means that the role these groups play in contributing to agendas for social inclusion is problematic. The study concludes by making suggestions as to how these groups might develop to be more inclusive and empowering...|$|R

Other examples are ReadSpeaker or BrowseAloud that add text-to-speech functionality to web content. The primary audience for such applications is those who have difficulty reading because of learning disabilities or language barriers. Although functionality remains limited compared to equivalent desktop applications, the major benefit is to increase the accessibility of said websites when viewed on public machines where users do not have permission to install custom software, giving people greater [...] "freedom to roam".|$|R

40|$|Although touch screens {{have great}} input flexibility, they are largely {{inaccessible}} {{to people with}} visual impairment. One of the issues with touch screens {{is the lack of}} clear tactile feedback, which is critical <b>for</b> <b>visually-impaired</b> people. We developed SemFeel, a tactile feedback technology that can express some semantic information by using multiple vibration motors in concert. We believe that the rich tactile feedback offered by SemFeel enables people with visual impairment to better use mobile touch-screen devices. In this paper, we report our findings from semi-structured interviews with three participants who have visual impairment about their experience of mobile devices. We then discuss a gesture-based user interface with tactile feedback for people with visual impairment. ACM Classification: H 5. 2 [Information interfaces an...|$|R

Using the analogy of the play 'One Man, Two Guvnors', this paper discusses the tensions a beginning researcher faces in reconciling her own vision for a project with the academic demands of doctoral-level study. Focusing on an ethnographic study of a reading group <b>for</b> <b>visually-impaired</b> people, the paper explores how the researcher's developing understanding of the considerations necessary when working with disabled people impacted on the research design. In particular, it focuses on the conflict faced by doctoral students when working in a paradigm that requires actively involving research participants, thereby relinquishing some control over the project. The aim of the paper is to provide an honest narrative that will resonate with other beginning researchers...|$|R

Numerous assistive technologies (AT) products in terms of hardware and software have been found in previous studies. Conversely, studies in the development of creative content application especially in education are highly scarce. Furthermore, elicitation from literature's also reveals that the use of AT was problematic for low vision children. Hence, this study attempts to investigate the availability and the needs of creative educational content application for VI learners. Accordingly, semi-structured interviews have been conducted with experts from special needs field. The results indicate that the creative educational content application specifically developed for VI learners is not yet exist and the need for it is urgent...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIt {{is thought}} by {{cognitive}} scientists and typographers alike, that lower-case text is more legible than upper-case. Yet lower-case letters are, on average, smaller in height and width than upper-case characters, which suggests an upper-case advantage. Using a single unaltered font and all upper-, all lower-, and mixed-case text, we assessed size thresholds for words and random strings, and reading speeds for text with normal {{and visually impaired}} participants. Lower-case thresholds were roughly 0. 1 log unit higher than upper. Reading speeds were higher for upper- than for mixed-case text at sizes twice acuity size; at larger sizes, the upper-case advantage disappeared. Results suggest that upper-case is more legible than the other case styles, especially <b>for</b> <b>visually-impaired</b> readers, because smaller letter sizes can be used than with the other case styles, with no diminution of legibility...|$|R
