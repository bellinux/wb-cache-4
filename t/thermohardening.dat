50|$|Bicycloundecane is anisotropically conductive. It is one {{of several}} bridged {{hydrocarbon}} residues that are formed during the <b>thermohardening</b> of polymerizable conductive adhesives based on di(metha)acroyloxymethyl-tricyclodecane, organic peroxide, and thermoplastic resin; such adhesives have applications in electronics.|$|E
40|$|The Glass-fibre Reinforced Plastic is a {{material}} consisting of: fibreglass fabric and/or glass or aramid fibre (a synthetic fibre with high mechanical resistance) bound {{together by a}} <b>thermohardening</b> resin which has been suitably polymerized (polyester, epoxy, acrylic or phenolic). With this technology known as 2 ̆ 2 Pultrusion 2 ̆ 2, {{it is possible to}} combine the mentioned range of fibres with the resin {{in such a way as}} to obtain the required mechanical characteristics, which may vary in different parts of the same profile or be uniform throughout...|$|E
