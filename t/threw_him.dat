5|$|In {{the first}} match of the tournament, Bam Bam Bigelow got the early {{advantage}} by attacking Razor Ramon from behind. Ramon gained momentum after Bigelow missed a diving headbutt, but Bigelow used {{his strength and}} got Ramon in a torture rack. As Bigelow climbed the ropes, however, Ramon <b>threw</b> <b>him</b> back into the ring and scored the pinfall.|$|E
5|$|The Ultimate Warrior {{gained the}} early {{advantage}} in his steel cage match with Rick Rude. After the Warrior missed a splash attempt, Rude attempted {{to win the}} match by escaping the cage. The Warrior stopped him, and both wrestlers unsuccessfully attempted to perform their finishing moves. Rude was then able to perform a Rude Awakening neckbreaker but chose to continue attacking the Warrior rather than escape the cage. Rude performed a shoulderblock and tried to leave through the cage door. The Warrior held him back while Bobby Heenan, Rude's manager, tried to pull Rude out. The Warrior pulled both Rude and Heenan into the cage. He punched Heenan and then <b>threw</b> <b>him</b> out of the cage with an atomic drop. Warrior then knocked Rude down three times with clotheslines and <b>threw</b> <b>him</b> onto the ring floor with a gorilla press drop. Warrior climbed over the cage and dropped to the arena floor to win the match and retain the WWF World Heavyweight Championship.|$|E
5|$|Another feud {{created for}} Over the Edge {{involved}} Triple H and The Rock, who would {{meet each other}} in a standard singles match at the event. Triple H had interfered in one of The Rock's matches, and later <b>threw</b> <b>him</b> off the stage. The script called for The Rock to portray an injury to his arm that required him to wear a plaster cast. Shane, acting his role as co-owner of WWF and ally of Triple H, further aggrieved The Rock by forbidding him to wear the cast for Over the Edge.|$|E

60|$|It {{is one of}} the defects of a super-subtle intellect {{to trust}} too implicitly to calculation, and to leave nothing to chance. Once or twice already Father Benwell had been (in the popular phrase) a little too clever--and chance had <b>thrown</b> <b>him</b> out. As events happened, chance was destined to <b>throw</b> <b>him</b> out once more.|$|R
2500|$|Another story relates how a {{relative}} of his wife wanted Abdallah El-Yafi to grant him a license to build a tunnel in Dahr El-Baydar, an area in Mount Lebanon promising him a worthy profit. Abdallah El-Yafi told his wife [...] "You either <b>throw</b> <b>him</b> {{out of my house}} now, or I will <b>throw</b> <b>him</b> down the stairs myself".|$|R
5|$|Bat {{remained}} until April 1881, when {{he returned}} to Dodge City to assist his brother Jim. On October 8, 1881, Doc Holliday got into a dispute with John Tyler in the Oriental Saloon. A rival gambling concession operator hired someone to disrupt Wyatt's business. When Tyler started a fight after losing a bet, Wyatt <b>threw</b> <b>him</b> out of the saloon. Holliday later wounded Oriental owners Milt Joyce and his partner William Parker and was convicted of assault.|$|E
5|$|Donatian {{stands in}} front of a set of windows that are just outside the {{pictorial}} space. He holds a jewelled processional cross in his left hand, and a wheel containing five lit tapered candles in his right. The wheel is his usual attribute, and refers to an incident when he nearly drowned after being flung into the Tiber, but was saved after Pope Dionysius <b>threw</b> <b>him</b> a carriage wheel he was able to use as a float.|$|E
5|$|The {{match between}} Shawn Michaels and Mr. Perfect {{began with a}} series of wrestling holds. The match {{remained}} primarily technical until Diesel distracted Perfect, allowing Michaels to superkick him in the face. Michaels worked on Perfect's injured back until Perfect took control of the match. After a series of attacks on Michaels, Perfect used the Perfect Plex. Diesel pulled him out of the ring and <b>threw</b> <b>him</b> into the steel ring steps, however, allowing Michaels to win by countout.|$|E

5|$|Beckett grew up idolizing fellow Texans Nolan Ryan and Roger Clemens. As a youth, he starred on Little League All-Star teams. He later {{attended}} Spring High School in Spring, Texas. He {{had trouble}} with grades and {{not paying attention to}} his coach during his freshman year. His coach was so frustrated with him he <b>threw</b> <b>him</b> off the team. He went through a growth spurt before his sophomore year and added speed to his fastball. He also raised his GPA and was able {{to get back on the}} team, where he had a 9–3 record with a 1.18 earned run average (ERA) as a sophomore, tossing three no-hitters.|$|E
5|$|Dunstan {{soon became}} a {{favourite}} of the king and was the envy of {{other members of the}} court. A plot was hatched to disgrace him and Dunstan was accused of being involved with witchcraft and black magic. The king ordered him to leave the court and as Dunstan was leaving the palace his enemies physically attacked him, beat him severely, bound him, and <b>threw</b> <b>him</b> into a cesspool. He managed to crawl out and make his way to the house of a friend. From there, he journeyed to Winchester and entered the service of his uncle, Ælfheah, Bishop of Winchester.|$|E
5|$|During {{his watch}} one night while the crew were camped on the ice, {{a small part}} of the ice floe broke away and he was only rescued due to the quick {{intervention}} of the men of the next watch who <b>threw</b> <b>him</b> a line allowing him to jump back to safety. Shackleton reported that McNish calmly mentioned his narrow escape the next day after further cracks appeared in the ice. Mrs. Chippy, the cat McNish had brought on board, had to be shot after the loss of the Endurance, as it was obvious he would not survive the harsh conditions. McNish apparently never forgave Shackleton for giving the order.|$|E

5|$|In {{the main}} event, Shawn Michaels {{was the first}} entrant in the Royal Rumble match, while Davey Boy Smith was the second participant. Every 60 seconds, another wrestler entered the match. As Owen Hart {{made his way to}} the ring, he was {{attacked}} by his brother Bret. As a result of the attack, Owen was quickly eliminated from the match when Smith, his brother-in-law, <b>threw</b> <b>him</b> out of the ring. King Kong Bundy and Mabel, the two biggest competitors in the match, fought until Mabel eliminated Bundy. Lex Luger then entered the match and eliminated Mabel. Bret Hart returned later and attacked Bob Backlund as Backlund was about to enter the match. This enabled Luger to eliminate Backlund quickly, after which Backlund and Bret continued to fight. The final four participants remaining in the ring were Michaels, Smith, Luger, and Crush. Luger attacked Crush but was eliminated by Michaels. Crush then convinced Michaels to work with him but then turned on Michaels by attacking him. Michaels scratched Crush's eyes, which enabled Smith to eliminate Crush. Michaels and Smith, the first two entrants, were the last two wrestlers remaining. Smith threw Michaels over the top rope and began to celebrate. Michaels, who had only touched the floor with one foot, was not eliminated from the match, however. He attacked Smith from behind and <b>threw</b> <b>him</b> out of the ring to become the first wrestler to win the Royal Rumble after entering first. Michaels celebrated in the ring with Pamela Anderson.|$|E
5|$|The next {{match was}} Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch against Paul London and Brian Kendrick for the World Tag Team Championship. Cade and Murdoch had the {{advantage}} over London and Kendrick early on. At one point, Murdoch pulled Kendrick outside the ring, over the top rope, and <b>threw</b> <b>him</b> into Cade, who performed a sitout spinebuster onto Kendrick. London tried to help his partner until Cade superplexed him over the top rope. Murdoch took the advantage and pinned Kendrick for the win. As a result, Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch retained the World Tag Team Championship.|$|E
5|$|Wrestling with a {{lumberjack}} gimmick, he {{debuted in}} Stampede Wrestling with his kayfabe brother, Paul LeDuc. The pair later won several titles in Montreal, where they feuded with the Rougeau wrestling family, and Florida, where {{they held the}} NWA Florida Tag Team Championship. After an injury ended Paul's career, LeDuc competed as a singles wrestler and involved in a heated feud with Dusty Rhodes. LeDuc then moved to Tennessee, where he had a rivalry with Jerry Lawler over the NWA Mid-America Southern Tag Team Championship, notably legitimately breaking Lawler's leg when he <b>threw</b> <b>him</b> over the top rope onto the announcer's desk.|$|E

5|$|After {{receiving}} a favourable omen {{during the night}} Pyrrhus renewed his assault. An effect of the shortage of warriors was that the Spartan women were active in providing the defenders with missiles and refreshments as well as taking away the wounded. In an attempt to nullify the Spartans' advantage, the Epiriotes tried to fill up with trench with debris and bodies but were prevented from doing so by the Sparta. Responding to this Spartan counter-attack, Pyrrhus personally led a charge against the Spartan lines and succeeded in entering the city, spreading panic amongst the defenders. However, at this point his horse <b>threw</b> <b>him</b> after it was wounded by a javelin in the belly. Pyrrhus' fall threw his companions {{into a state of}} dismay, permitting the Spartans to rally and they managed to slay many of the companions in a barrage of missiles. Despite this, Pyrrhus was taken safely back to his camp.|$|E
5|$|Control {{went back}} and forth at the {{beginning}} of the match between Hulk Hogan and Earthquake. When Earthquake rolled out of the ring, both wrestlers' corner-men got involved, as Hogan and the Big Boss Man fought against Earthquake and Dino Bravo. Bravo and Earthquake powerslammed Hogan while the referee was distracted, which allowed Earthquake to lock Hogan in a Boston crab hold. After being powerslammed outside of the ring by Earthquake, Hogan tried to lift his opponent but was unsuccessful. Earthquake powerslammed Hogan and performed two Earthquake splashes but was unable to get the pinfall. Hogan recovered and bodyslammed Earthquake. He performed a legdrop on Earthquake before Earthquake's manager, Jimmy Hart interfered. Hogan <b>threw</b> <b>him</b> out of the ring and then bodyslammed Earthquake onto a table at ringside. Hogan got back into the ring and won the match via countout. Earthquake attacked Hogan after the match, but the Big Boss Man saved Hogan by hitting Earthquake with a chair.|$|E
5|$|Early in 1905, Tomita and Maeda gave several public {{demonstration}}s of judo. On February 17, 1905, Tomita and Maeda gave a demonstration at Princeton University, when Maeda threw N. B. Tooker, a Princeton football player, while Tomita threw Samuel Feagles, the Princeton gymnasium instructor. On February 21, 1905, they gave a judo demonstration at the United States Military Academy at West Point, where Tomita and Maeda performed kata (patterns)—nage-no, koshiki, ju-no, and so on. At {{the request of}} the crowd, Maeda wrestled a cadet and <b>threw</b> <b>him</b> easily. Because Tomita had been the thrower in the kata, the cadets wanted to wrestle him too. Tomita threw the first (Charles Daly) without any trouble. However, Tomita twice failed to throw another football player named Tipton using tomoe-nage (stomach throw). Afterwards, the New York sportswriters claimed the victory for the cadets because Tomita was thrown, whereas the Japanese embassy staff proclaimed that Tomita had achieved a moral victory, on the grounds that he was a far smaller man.|$|E

5|$|Gaveston's {{return to}} grace was only temporary. On 26 February 1307, Edward I {{announced}} that the prince's favourite {{had to leave the}} realm shortly after 30 April that year. This time it seems the punishment was not intended for Gaveston, though, but for the Prince of Wales. According to Walter of Guisborough, the prince appeared before the King to request that his own county of Ponthieu be given to Gaveston. Edward I, enraged, tore out handfuls of his son's hair and <b>threw</b> <b>him</b> out of the royal chambers. Though Guisborough cannot necessarily be trusted on the details of the events, the story reflects the general exasperation the King felt with the prince's favouritism towards Gaveston, and the lavish gifts bestowed on the favourite. This extravagance was clearly seen on Gaveston's departure, when Prince Edward equipped him with horses, luxurious clothes, and £260 of money.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fifth}} match Matt Hardy faced Edge, who was {{accompanied}} by Lita, inside a Steel Cage. As the bell rang, Hardy tried to throw Edge face-first into the cage wall but didn't succeed. Back and forth action took place until Hardy got the advantage over Edge. Lita began to climb up {{the outside of the}} cage, but Hardy hit the cage, making Lita fall off. As Lita distracted Hardy, Edge started to crawl out. Hardy noticed this, grabbed Edge, and <b>threw</b> <b>him</b> into a corner. Lita interfered, which led to Hardy delivering a Twist of Fate to Lita. Edge executed a Spear on Hardy for a near-fall. After knocking Edge off the turnbuckle, Hardy delivered a leg drop {{off the top of the}} cage before pinning Edge for the win.|$|E
5|$|Robert {{issued an}} appeal {{for help to}} his barons, and Henry {{was the first to}} arrive in Rouen in November. Violence broke out, leading to savage, {{confused}} street fighting as both sides attempted {{to take control of the}} city. Robert and Henry left the castle to join the battle, but Robert then retreated, leaving Henry to continue the fighting. The battle turned in favour of the ducal forces and Henry took Conan prisoner. Henry was angry that Conan had turned against his feudal lord. He had him taken to the top of Rouen Castle and then, despite Conan's offers to pay a huge ransom, <b>threw</b> <b>him</b> off the top of the castle to his death. Contemporaries considered Henry to have acted appropriately in making an example of Conan, and Henry became famous for his exploits in the battle.|$|E
