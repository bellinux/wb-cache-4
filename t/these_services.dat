Predicted journey times of almost nine hours for Glasgow to Paris {{at the time}} of growth of low-cost air travel during the 1990s made the plans commercially unviable against the cheaper and quicker airlines. Other reasons that have been suggested for <b>these</b> <b>services</b> having never been run were both government policies and the disruptive privatisation of British Rail.|$|E

In order to make clear the essential of cloud computing, we propose the characteristics of <b>these</b> <b>service</b> models which distinguish cloud computing from other research areas. <b>These</b> <b>service</b> models are compared from various angles in order to clearly define there origin, working, advantages, disadvantages and limitations from existing other service models. On the other hand, <b>these</b> <b>service</b> models are classified on various stages to differentiate there characteristics from several other service models. This paper strives to compare and contrast the three major service models i. e. software-as-aservice, platform-as-a-service and infrastructure-as-a-service from various angles and give insight into essential characteristics of <b>these</b> three <b>service</b> models...|$|R
