The base, , was the sixth largest employer {{in the state of}} Utah and is the third largest employer which is neither the state government nor a state-funded higher education institution. SR-103 is one of four Utah state highways that connect to Hill Air Force Base, the others being SR-97, SR-168 and SR-232, Only SR-168 has a lower average daily <b>traffic</b> <b>count,</b> with roughly 1,000vehicles-per-day traveling along the highway compared to SR-103's approximately 16,000vehicles-per-day.

The measurement point for the traffic counts is at the eastern terminus of SR-103, the entrance to the Falcon Hill National Aerospace Research Park.

5|$|The {{entirety}} of NY448 was originally designated {{as part of}} NY117 in the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. In 193233, John D. Rockefeller offered to straighten a short section of NY117 that passed through Kykuit, the Rockefeller family estate, citing safety concerns. The state expressed similar sentiments in 1949, deeming the stretch unsafe for commercial traffic. By the 1960s, the annual average daily <b>traffic</b> <b>count</b> along NY117 had grown to 5,000 vehicles per day, {{far more than the}} 1,800 that the road had originally been built to serve. This led the New York State Legislature to approve plans for a new alignment for NY117 in 1965. The new road would be located north of the existing road, relieving traffic congestion on the Albany Post Road (US9) and NY117 and providing access to NY9A, US9, the Taconic State Parkway and the proposed Hudson River Expressway in the North Tarrytown area.|$|E

40|$|Many {{practitioners}} {{question the}} advantages of activity-based models over conventional four-step models in regard to replication of <b>traffic</b> <b>counts.</b> This paper highlights a framework that actively links travel demand models in general and activity-based models in particular with <b>traffic</b> <b>counts.</b> Two approaches are presented that calibrate activity-based models with traffic count—an indirect and a direct approach. The indirect approach tries to incorporate findings based on the analysis of <b>traffic</b> <b>counts</b> into {{the components of the}} activity-based models. The direct approach calibrates the parameters of the travel demand model {{in such a way that}} the model replicates the observed <b>traffic</b> <b>counts</b> (quasi-) perfectly. A practical example is provided to illustrate the direct approach. The study area for this practical example is Hasselt, Belgium, a city of about 70, 000 residents, and its surrounding municipalities. The practical examples revealed not a single roadway to success in calibrating activity-based models, but different options exist in fine-tuning the activity-based model. It is important to recognize some open issues and avenues for further research. First, it is not always appropriate to assume that <b>traffic</b> <b>counts</b> are completely correct. Setting up some belief structure might increase the responsiveness of the activity-based model. In addition, the origin-destination matrix calibration that optimizes the correspondence between estimated and observed screen-line counts could negatively affect the correspondence to other measures, such as vehicle miles traveled. To conclude, the formulation of a multiobjective calibration method is a key challenge for further research. Peer reviewe...|$|R
