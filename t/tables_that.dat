His book Arithmetica Integra contains several <b>tables</b> <b>that</b> show the integers with their corresponding powers of two.

5|$|In {{the year}} 1826, he {{conducted}} a study connecting mortality rates with wealth and poverty based on neighborhoods in Paris. Louis-René Villermé is also accounted {{as the author of}} the one of the first life expectancy <b>tables</b> <b>that</b> directly linked income to mortality rates and life expectancy. He concluded that poor people die younger. This extended into his study in 1829 that reasoned the cause for shorter heights in poorer people was the result of inadequate money to provide proper nutrition. Villermé's work on height is considered the first study in auxological epidemiology.|$|E
5|$|On August 2, 1600, after {{refusing to}} convert to Catholicism, Kepler {{and his family were}} banished from Graz. Several months later, Kepler returned, now {{with the rest of his}} household, to Prague. Through most of 1601, he was {{supported}} directly by Tycho, who assigned him to analyzing planetary observations and writing a tract against Tycho's (by then deceased) rival, Ursus. In September, Tycho secured him a commission as a collaborator on the new project he had proposed to the emperor: the Rudolphine <b>Tables</b> <b>that</b> should replace the Prutenic Tables of Erasmus Reinhold. Two days after Tycho's unexpected death on October 24, 1601, Kepler was appointed his successor as imperial mathematician with the responsibility to complete his unfinished work. The next 11 years as imperial mathematician would be the most productive of his life.|$|E
5|$|The first list {{fragment}} {{is followed}} by the canon tables of Eusebius of Caesarea. These tables, which predate the text of the Vulgate, were developed to cross-reference the Gospels. Eusebius divided the Gospel into chapters and then created <b>tables</b> <b>that</b> allowed readers to find where a given episode in the life of Christ was located in each of the Gospels. The canon tables were traditionally included in the prefatory material in most mediaeval copies of the Vulgate text of the Gospels. The tables in the Book of Kells, however, are almost unusable because the scribe condensed the tables {{in such a way as}} to make them confused. In addition, the corresponding chapter numbers were never inserted into the margins of the text, making it impossible to find the sections to which the canon tables refer. The reason for the omission remains unclear: the scribe may have planned to add the references upon the manuscript's completion, or he may have deliberately left them out so as not to spoil the appearance of pages.|$|E

25|$|Normalization splits up data {{to avoid}} {{redundancy}} (duplication) by moving commonly repeating groups of data into new tables.

25|$|Some {{database}} developers compromise {{by creating}} an underlying snowflake schema with views built {{on top of it}} that perform many of the necessary joins to simulate a star schema. This provides the storage benefits achieved through the normalization of dimensions with the ease of querying that the star schema provides. The tradeoff is that requiring the server to perform the underlying joins automatically can result in a performance hit when querying as well as extra joins to <b>tables</b> <b>that</b> may not be necessary to fulfill certain queries.|$|E

25|$|New England almanacs were {{compiled}} by young Harvard graduates who used {{them as a}} vehicle for popular essays on Copernican astronomy. This included, Zachariah Brigden from Connecticut, who wrote about the revolution of the six planets around the sun, the four satellites around Jupiter and the two satellites around Saturn in The New England Almanack of the Coelestial Motions for this Present Year of the Christian AEra 1659. Brigden had access to English almanac-maker and astronomer Vincent Wing’s 1656 Astronomia Instraurata. Wing was the first to put the discoveries of Copernicus, Galileo, and Kelper into English. He published astronomical <b>tables</b> <b>that</b> made predicting eclipses more accessible.|$|E
25|$|A {{large part}} of Albert A. Bühlmann's {{research}} {{was to determine the}} longest half time compartments for Nitrogen and Helium, and he increased the number of compartments to 16. He investigated the implications of decompression after diving at altitude and published decompression <b>tables</b> <b>that</b> could be used at a range of altitudes. Bühlmann used a method for decompression calculation similar to that proposed by Workman, which included M-values expressing a linear relationship between maximum inert gas pressure in the tissue compartments and ambient pressure, but based on absolute pressure, which made them more easily adapted for altitude diving. Bühlmann's algorithm was used to generate the standard decompression tables for a number of sports diving associations, and is used in several personal decompression computers, sometimes in a modified form.|$|E

25|$|Familiar as {{an ancient}} {{symbol of the}} region, the Triskelion is also {{featured}} on Greek coins of Syracuse, such as coins of Agathocles (317–289 BC).The symbol dates back to when Sicily was part of Magna Graecia, the colonial extension of Greece beyond the Aegean. The triskelion was revived, as a neoclassic – and non-Bourbon – emblem for the new Napoleonic Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, by Joachim Murat in 1808. Pliny the Elder attributes {{the origin of the}} triskelion of Sicily to the triangular form of the island, the ancient Trinacria, which consists of three large capes equidistant from each other, pointing in their respective directions, the names of which were Pelorus, Pachynus, and Lilybæum. The three legs of the triskelion are also reminiscent of Hephaestus's three-legged <b>tables</b> <b>that</b> ran by themselves, as mentioned in Iliad xviii.|$|E
25|$|To {{compete on}} a National level for {{national}} titles you must compete in Nationals. Nationals {{have their own}} separate points <b>tables</b> <b>that</b> are accumulated by the racers similarly to local district points. However the points rewarded {{are not the same}} amount. For instance 240 National points are awarded to the first place Expert winner as well as his 300 district triple points, but his national points are not added to his district points or vice versa. Like in local races he or she is also awarded participant points. The amateur with the most National points {{at the end of the}} year is the overall National number one (#1) racer and gets to wear a #1 on his number plate at national events the following season. Professionals are not affected since they have their own points system and table separate from the amateurs for the number one pro title.|$|E
25|$|ENIAC {{could be}} {{programmed}} to perform complex sequences of operations, including loops, branches, and subroutines. However, instead of the stored program computers that exist today, ENIAC was just a large collection of arithmetic machines, which had programs hard coded into the machines with function <b>tables</b> <b>that</b> each contained 1200 ten way switches. The task of taking a problem and mapping it onto the machine was complex, and usually took weeks. Due {{to the complexity of}} mapping programs onto the machine, programs were only changed after huge numbers of tests of the current program. After the program was figured out on paper, the process of getting the program into ENIAC by manipulating its switches and cables could take days. This was followed by a period of verification and debugging, aided by the ability to execute the program step by step. A programming tutorial for the modulo function using an ENIAC simulator gives an impression of what a program on the ENIAC looked like.|$|E
