The engines {{featured a}} sliding cowl arrangement to facilitate cooling airflow {{instead of the}} normal cowl flaps, which caused too much drag. At {{the front of the}} cowls, the engines were also fitted with a two-stage [...] "impeller fan" [...] directly behind the propeller hub and prop spinner. This allowed the engines to be tightly cowled for aerodynamic efficiency, but still provide the cooling airflow the engines required. When the sliding cowl ring was closed (during flight), the air used for cooling the engine was ducted through the nacelle to the rear exhaust orifice for a net <b>thrust</b> <b>gain,</b> as opposed to the usual cooling drag penalty.|$|E

Extra fuel was to be burned in the tailpipe to avoid overheating the turbine blades, making use of unused oxygen present in the exhaust. To supply more air to the afterburner than could move through the fairly small engine, an augmentor fan powered by the engine was to be fitted behind the engine to draw air around the engine via ducts. These changes were estimated to provide for an addition 1,620lb of thrust when at 36,000ft and 500mph; much greater <b>thrust</b> <b>gains</b> were believed to have resulted from travelling at speeds in excess of 500mph.|$|R

One of the reference programs for nozzle analysis is the Two-Dimensional Kinetics (TDK) Program. The purpose of this report is to calibrate the JANNAF procedure incorporated into the December l 984 version of the TDK program for the high-area-ratio rocket engine regime. The calibration was accomplished by modeling the performance of a 1030 : 1 rocket nozzle tested at NASA Lewis Research Center. A detailed description of the experimental test conditions and TDK input parameters is given. The results show that the computer code predicts delivered vacuum specific impulse to within 0. 12 to 1. 9 percent of the experimental data. Vacuum thrust coefficient predictions were within + or - 1. 3 percent of experimental results. Predictions of wall static pressure were within approximately + or - 5 percent of the measured values. An experimental value for inviscid thrust was obtained for the nozzle extension between area ratios of 427. 5 and 1030 by using an integration of the measured wall static pressures. Subtracting the measured <b>thrust</b> <b>gain</b> produced by the nozzle between area ratios of 427. 5 and 1030 from the inviscid <b>thrust</b> <b>gain</b> yielded experimental drag decrements of 10. 85 and 27. 00 N (2. 44 and 6. 07 lb) for mixture ratios of 3. 04 and 4. 29, respectively.

As the void fraction in the bubbly mixture increases the speed of sound drops significantly and the mixture velocity could drop below the speed of sound leading to a need to investigate choked or supersonic mixture flow in the nozzle. In the present study, a convergent-divergent nozzle was designed, built, and tested to investigate experimentally if choked flow in the nozzle can actually be reached at high void fractions and to measure <b>thrust</b> <b>gain</b> for choked supersonic conditions.

The experimental results indicated that the pumping range and amount of cooling-air flow obtained with a 1. 06 diameter ratio ejector were relatively small for cooling purposes but that the maximum possible thrust loss, which occurred with no secondary flow, was only 7 percent of convergent nozzle thrust. The 1. 40 diameter ratio ejector produced a large cooling air flow and showed a possible thrust loss of 29. 5 percent with no cooling air flow. <b>Thrust</b> <b>gains</b> were attained with ejectors of both diameter ratios at secondary pressure ratios greater than 1. 0.

40|$|Older {{commercial}} aircraft often exceed FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) sideline noise regulations. The major {{problem is the}} jet noise associated with the high exhaust velocities of the low bypass ratio engines on such aircraft. Mixer/ejector exhaust systems can provide a simple means of reducing the jet noise on these aircraft by mixing cool ambient air with the high velocity engine gases before they are exhausted to ambient. This paper presents new information on thrust performance predictions, and thrust augmentation capabilities of mixer/ejectors. Results are presented from the recent development program of the patented Alternating Lobe Mixer Ejector Concept (ALMEC) suppressor system for the Gulfstream GII, GIIB and GIII aircraft. Mixer/ejector performance procedures are presented which include classical control volume analyses, compound compressible flow theory, lobed nozzle loss correlations and {{state of the art}} computational fluid dynamic predictions. The mixer/ejector thrust predictions are compared to subscale wind tunnel test model data and actual aircraft flight test measurements. The results demonstrate that a properly designed mixer/ejector noise suppressor can increase effective engine bypass ratio and generate large <b>thrust</b> <b>gains</b> at takeoff conditions with little or no thrust loss at cruise conditions.

In the present study, the authors conducted two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations on small-scale magnetospheres to investigate thrust {{characteristics of a}} magnetic sail and its derivative, magnetoplasma sail, in which the magnetosphere is inflated by an additional plasma injection. As a result, the authors found that the electron Larmor motion and the charge separation become significant on such a small-scale magnetosphere and {{the thrust of the}} magnetic sail is affected by the cross-sectional size of the charge-separated magnetosphere. The authors also reveal that the plasma injection, on the condition that the kinetic energy of plasma is smaller than the local magnetic field energy (β∼ 10 [− 3]), can significantly inflate the magnetosphere by inducing diamagnetic current {{in the same direction as}} the onboard coil current. As a result, the magnetoplasma sail thrust is increased effectively by an additional plasma injection: the magnetoplasma sail thrust (15 μN/m) becomes up to 7. 5 times larger than the original thrust of the magnetic sail (2. 0 μN/m).

In order to help bring down the cost of running a research mission with an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), the method of tracking the AUV can be improved. An autonomous surface vessel (ASV), equipped with both acoustic instrumentation and wireless or radio communication technology, can successfully track the AUV and interface with scientists. An ASV named RoBoat, built at MIT in undergraduate classes using a kayak hull, is vessel that can be controlled remotely. To help RoBoat become fully autonomous, a program must be created to take in the data from the underwater acoustic sensors and output commands that the kayak can follow. This thesis studies the homing rules that govern the kayak, under realistic tracking scenarios. The kayak dynamics were modeled and the response to several AUV paths was simulated. The simulation uses many of the kayak properties to be able to create a model that can be used with this specific ASV. The AUV is modeled as a single point target and follows four different common trajectories: a straight line, a line with a delayed start, a simple turn and a lawnmower configuration. (cont.) There were several quantities varied throughout these four cases in order to understand more {{about the nature of the}} model; these quantities are the speed of the vehicles, the <b>thrust</b> control <b>gain,</b> the heading control gains and in the lawnmower case the distance between a turn around. With this controller, the kayak responded in predictable ways. An decrease in speed and an increase in the <b>thrust</b> control <b>gain</b> will both lead to smaller trailing distance. Both quantities had large effects on the response and path of the kayak. The heading control gains had very little effect in any of the situations. When the kayak encounters sharp turns, it can overshoot the target path, but will settle within fifty seconds. Within these scenarios encountered, the kayak did not fail its mission; the kayak always stabilizes to a reasonable path. by Christina Gomez. Thesis (S. B.)

40|$|Ornithopters or {{flapping}} wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) {{have potential}} applications in both civil and military sectors. Amongst all categories of UAVs, ornithopters {{have a unique}} ability to fly in low Reynolds number flight regimes and have the agility and maneuverability of rotary wing aircraft. In nature, birds achieve such performance by exploiting various wing kinematics known as gaits. The objective of this work was to improve the steady level flight wing performance of an ornithopter by implementing the Continuous Vortex Gait (CVG) using a novel passive compliant spine. The CVG {{is a set of}} bio-inspired kinematics that natural flyers use to produce lift and thrust during steady level flight. A significant contribution of this work was the recognition that the CVG is an avian gait that could be achieved using a passive morphing mechanism. In contrast to rigid-link mechanisms and active approaches, reported by other researchers in the open literature, passive morphing mechanisms require no additional energy expenditure, while introducing minimal weight addition and complexity. During the execution of the CVG, the avian wing wrist is the primary joint responsible for the wing shape changes. Thus a compliant mechanism, called a compliant spine, was fabricated, and integrated in the ornithopter's wing leading edge spar where an avian wrist would normally exist, namely at 37 % of the wing half span. Each compliant spine was designed to be flexible in bending during the wing upstroke and stiff in bending during the wing downstroke. Inserting a variable stiffness compliant mechanism in the leading edge (LE) spar of the ornithopter could affect its structural stability. An analytical model was developed to determine the structural stability of the ornithopter LE spar. The model was validated using experimental measurements. The LE spar equations of motion were then reformulated into Mathieu's equation and the LE spar was proven to be structurally stable with a compliant spine design insert. A research ornithopter platform was tested in air and in vacuum as well as in free and constrained flight with various compliant spine designs inserted in its wings. Results from the constrained flight tests indicated that the ornithopter with a compliant spine inserted in its wings consumed 45 % less electrical power and produced 16 % of its weight in additional lift, without incurring any thrust penalties. Results from, the vacuum constrained tests attributed these benefits to aerodynamic effects rather than inertial effects. Free flight tests were performed at Wright Patterson Air Force Base, which houses the largest indoor flight laboratory in the country. The wing kinematics along with the vehicle dynamics were captured during this testing using Vicon® motion tracking cameras. These flight tests proved to be successful in producing consistent and repeatable flight data over more than eight free flight flapping cycles of free flight and validated a new and novel testing technique. The ornithopter body dynamics were shown to be significant, i. e. ± 4 gs. Inserting the compliant spine into the leading edge spar of the ornithopter during free flight reduced the baseline configuration body vertical center of mass positive acceleration by 69 %, which translates into overall lift gains. It also increased the horizontal propulsive force by 300 %, which translates into <b>thrust</b> <b>gains.</b> &# 8195...|$|R

This thesis develops a threedimensional rocket nozzle design that includes the potential for incorporating the ejector effect. The nozzle is designed such that the diverging portion of the nozzle geometry must pass through a gate that is placed on the outer perimeter whose shape does not have to remain axisymmetric, thus creating a void for air intake into the centre of an annular rocket exhaust stream. Viscous effects are included via Edenfield’s displacement thickness δ correlation for turbulent boundary layers.

This maximum is significantly less than the 37. 5 km of right slip required in this region by a recent reconstruction of the central Mojave Desert. Geologic relations along the southern boundary of the rotating domain are poorly known, but this boundary is interpreted to involve a series of curved strike slip faults and non-coaxial extension, bounded on the southeast by the Mammoth Wash and related faults in the eastern Chocolate Mountains.

40|$|Controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) {{accidents}} {{occur when}} an aircraft, {{under the control}} of the crew, is flown into terrain (or water) with no prior awareness from the part of the crew of the imminent catastrophe (Wiener, 1977). In commercial aviation, CFIT are among the deadliest accidents but the situation has continuously improved this last decade. In particular, a spectacular fall in the number of fatalities was made possible by the introduction of enhanced ground proximity warning systems (EGPWS). However, CFIT accidents remain the second leading cause of on-board fatalities and several crashes of this category involving airplanes equipped with EGPWS occurred since 2007. The human factor plays a major role in that type of disaster and studies show that visual and auditory alarms are not always taken into account. Yet, when a ‘PULL UP’ alert is triggered, the pilot has only a few seconds to react in order to avoid the impending CFIT. Most of the time, the procedure is quite simple: the pilot must pull full back on the stick and apply maximum <b>thrust</b> to <b>gain</b> altitude. In this study, we introduced a new type of visual alert specifically dedicated to activate the mirror neurons that appear to play a key role in both action understanding and imitation (Rizzolatti, 2004). Such motor neurons are known to fire either when a person acts or when a person observes the same action performed by another one. We hypothesized that an immediate understanding of a required behavior, displayed by a video that shows the appropriate actions to perform, will activate the mirror neurons and provoke an extremely rapid reaction from the pilots to prevent a potential collision. We designed short videos displayed in the primary flight displays in which virtual avatars explicitly performed the actions on the levers and on the stick. Three pilots completed 10 different flight scenarios during the approach phase with a full motion A 320 flight simulator. In some of the scenarios, an alarm was triggered just before an imminent collision and the pilots had to immediately perform a go-around. The results showed that the videos with avatars allowed much shorter reaction times than the regular textual ‘PULL UP’ alerts. While the anti-collision maneuver was initiated in 7. 60 s (SD = 1. 83) with the regular alert, video mean reaction time was 1. 27 s (SD = 0. 31).

Partially inspired by the automotive industry’s success with the hybrid car, this thesis investigated the feasibility of an electric-hybrid propulsion system for an Airbus A 340 - 600 on a long-haul flight and its effect on the aircraft’s performance. First, an analysis was done of the reference aircraft, A 340 - 600, using conventional propulsion. Second, a 5700 nautical miles flight was modelled to determine performance data such as the power and thrust requirements during the different flight phases. Third, the flight phases where electric propulsion would be implemented were identified and an optimum ratio between conventional and electric propulsion was calculated. Finally, a detailed performance analysis of the new hybrid electric aircraft comparing it to a conventional aircraft was conducted. The maximum available conventional thrust was reduced to a certain percentage of the maximum thrust. Primarily conventional thrust is used, however when it is no longer sufficient, additional <b>thrust</b> is <b>gained</b> through electric propulsion. Conventional thrust ratio of 69. 5 %, 63. 5 % and 59. 5 % of total thrust was investigated yielding 8680 kg, 10500 kg and 8585 kg of payload decrease respectively. Net energy of 6. 70 MWh, 11. 71 MWh and 31. 06 MWh is required and the electric engines need to provide 21. 3 MW, 25. 5 MW and 28. 3 MW of net power respectively. Partial electric propulsion will result in increased weight; however, it will also give room for further performance optimisation and technical innovations. On the one hand, the conventional engines will run at a constant speed throughout the flight allowing for better optimisation at a specific design point. On the other hand, electric engines are more reliable and require less maintenance than conventional engines. Furthermore, lower fuel consumption means less carbon-dioxide emissions. An exemption from CO 2 -taxes, similar to measures implemented for hybrid cars in certain countries, could financially justify use of the aircraft by airlines and compensate for the decrease in payload. Since a fully electric propelled airliner is not likely to fly for several decades, a hybrid-airliner would be a suitable alternative for the transition period from fossil fuels to electric energy...|$|R
40|$|For future fully {{reusable}} SSTOs and rocket engines, {{light weight}} and high performance propulsion system from low altitude to high altitude are essential. Engines with aero spike nozzles are drawing attention as promising candidates which satisfy these requirements. A renewed interest into aerospike (plug) nozzles has surfaced for the possible replacement of standard contoured nozzles {{used for the}} propulsion systems of space vehicles. Although a more complex flow field develops on plug nozzles, the potential <b>thrust</b> and structural <b>gains</b> are attractive as the propulsive flow is free {{to adapt to the}} external stream. The commercial software Ansys-Fluent 14. 0 is used for the numerical simulation of the problem. Steady state analysis with implicit formulation is carried out. Mass, momentum and energy equations with k-e turbulence model is solved. In this project a study on various types of aero spike nozzles and characteristics of its flow field is carried out. Numerical analysis of a typical aero spike nozzle with results analysis and discussion on flow characteristics, comparison on full spike and truncated spike configuration for different pressure ratios are included. In truncated spike configuration, 20 %, 40 %, 60 %, 80 % of spike length are included. The flow characteristics such as shock waves and wake formation etc are discussed with the help of contour plots. The performance analysis is done by plotting maximum Mach number, average exit velocity and thrust produced. Based on the analysis it can be state that the maximum performance is given by full spike nozzle. But we can provide truncation upto 60 % {{in order to reduce the}} weight and catastrophic failure due to high load on the surface...|$|R
