60|$|Soon the {{stranger}} was seen dimly wallowing along astern, crowding all sail in chase, while {{now and then}} her bow-gun, showing its red <b>tongue,</b> <b>bellowed</b> after them like a mad bull. Two more shots struck the cutter, but without materially damaging her sails, or the ropes immediately upholding them. Several of her less important stays were sundered, however, whose loose tarry ends lashed the air like scorpions. It seemed not improbable that, owing to her superior sailing, the keen cutter would yet get clear.|$|R
2500|$|In 1979 it {{was given}} a general clean and {{overhaul}} by Henry Willis IV. [...] The total number of registers, including 24couplers, is 144. With 7,737pipes, {{it was the largest}} organ in the country until a larger one was built at the Royal Albert Hall in 1871, after which an organ even larger than the one at the Royal Albert Hall was constructed at Liverpool Anglican Cathedral, using over 10,000pipes. Repairs were made to the organ as part of the restoration of the hall in 2000–2007, including replacement of the <b>bellows</b> <b>leather.</b> [...] The organ is maintained by David Wells, Organ Builders.|$|R

50|$|One {{frequent}} {{source of}} light leaks in 35 mm cameras {{is around the}} film door due to degrading foam. Replacing the foam is a simple matter. Medium format system cameras or large format cameras may have leaks between their various interchangeable parts or in old <b>leather</b> <b>bellows.</b> Electrical tape {{is often used to}} repair light leaks in these cases.|$|R
50|$|To {{maintain}} their inherent accuracy and ensure long life, great care {{is needed to}} avoid contamination with dirt and abrasive particles. This may be achieved by using rubber or <b>leather</b> <b>bellows</b> to completely or partially enclose the working surfaces. Another solution {{is to use a}} positive pressure of filtered air when they are used in a semi-sealed or open enclosure.|$|R

[...] Both the efficient, electric blower, which replaced the wood and <b>leather</b> <b>bellows</b> still resting by the forge, and the electric trip-hammer enabled smiths, who at that time often found themselves working alone as the apprentice system broke down, to handle larger work without assistance.|$|R
50|$|Herbert Skinner (1872-1931), pioneer {{motorist}} and {{an active}} participant {{in the development of the}} petrol engine, invented his Union carburettor in 1904. His much younger brother Carl (Thomas Carlisle) Skinner (1882-1958) also a motoring enthusiast had joined the Farman Automobile Co in London in 1899. He helped Herbert to develop the carburettor. Herbert's son could remember his mother sewing the first <b>leather</b> <b>bellows.</b> It would be given on loan to The Science Museum, South Kensington in 1934. In 1905 Herbert applied for a patent which was granted in early 1906. Later Carl sold his interest in footwear business Lilley & Skinner and became a partner in G Wailes & Co of Euston Road, London, manufacturers of their carburettor. Herbert continued to develop and patent improvements through to the 1920s including the replacement of the <b>leather</b> <b>bellows</b> by a brass piston though he was a full-time director and divisional manager of Lilley & Skinner.|$|R
40|$|Product {{diversification}} is a usual {{strategy of}} footwear producers. As a requirement related to competitiveness in this domain, diversification {{can be done}} by practical application of some criteria. Considering this aspect, the paper proposes a research on the diversification {{in the case of a}} safety footwear product by modifying its component patterns, while keeping the initial shape of the product. Thus, starting from a safety shoe model, diversification was performed by changing the configuration in the joining area of two patterns of the product. By joining the <b>tongue</b> with the <b>bellows</b> <b>tongue,</b> the upper with the quarter, the heel counter with the quarter and the collar and heel counter with quarter has resulted a family of models characterized by a reduction of the number of patterns in the product. The size of the set presents a significant influence on the theoretical nesting factor and implicitly on the size of the wastes. The analysis of the resulting new model types lead to highlighting the influence of the patterns number of the uppers and the area of the set on the usage index of the leather surface when cutting the parts and on the specific consumption. ...|$|R
50|$|After leaving Nordica, in {{the late}} '70s he {{modified}} a Nordica Meteor shell to use a springy nylon flex-controlling internal shell-tongue. He brought the design to Erik Giese in Aspen. Giese, an ex-ski racer and lawyer from Seattle, had founded a small research-and-design company in 1973, called Comfort Products. He employed two former NASA space-suit engineers: Al Gross, who was instrumental in developing the Flexon <b>bellows</b> <b>tongue</b> based on space suit components, and Dixie Rinehart, who designed articulated gloves later licensed to Swany.|$|R
50|$|As the Brigand became hedged in {{with more}} restrictions, both unit commanders had {{serious doubts about}} {{continued}} use of the aircraft. It was decided to keep on operating them, since as long as thorough maintenance was carried out {{it was felt that}} nothing else could go wrong. Another design flaw arose in the <b>leather</b> <b>bellows</b> used to deploy the air brakes during dives. In the tropical climate, the leather would rot away, causing the brakes to fail. This led to Brigands losing wings in dives due to excessive airspeed or rotation as only one brake deployed. When this problem was discovered, the air brakes of all Brigands were wired shut, decreasing the aircraft's dive bombing capabilities.|$|R

5000|$|The first camera, the SLV, {{was born}} with the 6X7 / 6X9 format, with a {{rotating}} back with click stop each 90 degrees and the lens, a Super Angulon 5,6/47 mm in focusing helical mount by Schneider, was not interchangeable. The shift mechanism permitted a total rise or fall of 25 mm, it consisted in a control knob and two counter posed screws right/left and allowed a precise setting and locking of the shift. The attachment of the roll film back was Graflex compatible that opened the system to the application of various backs like Mamiya, Horseman, Wista, etc. The image viewing and the focusing were made on the round glass by mean of a magnifying lens in a <b>leather</b> <b>bellows.</b> The whole camera structure was made in anodized aluminium worked with CNC machineries, ensuring constructive exactness and reliability.|$|R
50|$|The Link family firm in Binghamton {{manufactured}} player pianos and organs, and Ed Link {{was therefore}} familiar with such components as <b>leather</b> <b>bellows</b> and reed switches. He {{was also a}} pilot, but dissatisfied {{with the amount of}} real flight training that was available, he decided to build a ground-based device to provide such training without the restrictions of weather and the availability of aircraft and flight instructors. His design had a pneumatic motion platform driven by inflatable bellows which provided pitch and roll cues. A vacuum motor similar to those used in player pianos rotated the platform, providing yaw cues. A generic replica cockpit with working instruments was mounted on the motion platform. When the cockpit was covered, pilots could practice flying by instruments in a safe environment. The motion platform gave the pilot cues as to real angular motion in pitch (nose up and down), roll (wing up or down) and yaw (nose left and right).|$|R
50|$|Water-powered and {{mechanised}} trip hammers reappeared {{in medieval}} Europe by the 12th century. Their use {{was described in}} medieval written sources of Styria (in modern-day Austria), written in 1135 and another in 1175 AD. Both texts mentioned the use of vertical stamp mills for ore-crushing. Medieval French sources of the years 1116 and 1249 both record the use of mechanised trip hammers used in the forging of wrought iron. Medieval European trip hammers by the 15th century were most often {{in the shape of}} the vertical pestle stamp-mill. The well-known Renaissance artist and inventor Leonardo da Vinci often sketched trip hammers for use in forges and even file-cutting machinery, those of the vertical pestle stamp-mill type. The oldest depicted European illustration of a martinet forge-hammer is perhaps the Historia de Gentibus Septentrionalibus of Olaus Magnus, dated to 1565 AD. In this woodcut image, there is the scene of three martinets and a waterwheel working wood and <b>leather</b> <b>bellows</b> of an osmund (sv) bloomery furnace.

5000|$|The first {{prototype}} of the new camera, named the Rolleiflex, was finally completed in 1927; it was built for absolute reliability and featured a rigid, injection-moulded housing made of aluminium. Heidecke wanted to avoid conventional <b>leather</b> <b>bellows</b> for focusing the lens because of an earlier, bad experience: around 1916, he conducted an experiment with a Kodak camera; he left it in a cellar, and when he later retrieved it, he found that rats had eaten the bellows. This convinced him that a camera designed for photojournalism and operation in the tropics had to work perfectly, which excluded components that might rot. He ruled out a cloth shutter curtain for the same reason, choosing instead a Compur mechanical shutter.Focusing in the [...] "Rolleiflex" [...] was achieved by moving the carriage that held both the viewfinder and the imaging lens, i.e. the camera had so-called [...] "metallic bellows"; that is, the plate enclosed {{the sides of the}} case. It was crucial that the plate remained parallel as it moved during focusing; to achieve this, Heidecke developed an ingenious design which proved to be highly successful. Behind the imaging lens and surrounding the opening for the optical path was a large cogwheel which drove four smaller cogs located top left and right, and bottom left and right. Each of the four small cogs drove rack and pinions (toothed rails) attached to the lens assembly. This system functioned perfectly, and, thanks to high-quality components, also for many years of service. Only the viewfinder and back of the camera, both made of aluminium, had to be handled with care, which remained the case until the camera went into production.|$|R
