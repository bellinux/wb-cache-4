500|$|Upon AJ's arrival, Ally Ross of The Sun said: [...] "New arrivals have {{included}} [...] Masood's supposedly funny and long-lost brother AJ, {{who made the}} fatal mistake of arriving with the line: 'Do I look like a comedian?' No. You look like David Baddiel. Now kindly piss off". Kay Ribeiro from Heat said, [...] "We like new boy AJ. Not only is he a laugh [...] but he's providing light relief during [...] and 's split, which is making us sad." [...] Laura Morgan from All About Soap hoped that AJ would become a permanent character after his initial appearances. In October 2012, Allison Jones from Inside Soap said, [...] "AJ has proved the perfect tonic for a family almost constantly dogged with crisis [...] his tenacious ability to wind up Zainab never fails to entertain! AJ may have only been in Walford for a few months, but it already feels as if we've known him for ages." [...] She also called Sharma and Ganatra, [...] "a killer on-screen pairing". Nathan Bevan from Welsh newspaper Western Mail praised Sharma's role in EastEnders, naming {{him as one of}} [...] "50 <b>things</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> look forward to in Wales" [...] in 2013, saying, [...] "Anyone who injects a little sunshine into the 'Chekhov with a covered market' drudgery of EastEnders should be automatically given an Outstanding Contribution to Broadcasting Award in our book. So well done Newport's very own Phaldut Sharma who, since arriving in Walford as Masood Ahmed's gregarious but aggro-magnet brother AJ, has helped break up the unrelenting, bicker-filled misery of Albert Square." [...] Bevan later said that Sharma has [...] "shaken up the residents of Walford as the wise-cracking, wheeler-dealing AJ Ahmed", adding, [...] "He's the gregarious, trouble-magnet who's brought some much needed sunshine to the sombre, squabble-filled soapiness of Albert Square." [...] Anthony D. Langford from AfterElton.com said AJ was a [...] "find" [...] but thought the writers might not be sure {{what to do with the}} character. Vicky Prior from the Metro said AJ [...] "has lit up the square with his gently laddish behaviour." ...|$|E

If the women were to arm {{themselves}} with mops soaked in dirty water, and were to attack every man under forty they found lurking in the streets, they would soon make a change in <b>things.</b> <b>You</b> <b>should</b> begin in your own quarter first, for although they are always denouncing the bourgeois for not fighting, I cannot see that there is any more eagerness to go out at Montmartre than there is in the quarter of the Bank--in fact, a great deal less." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'On the contrary, aunt. In matrimony, as in {{some other}} <b>things,</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> be slow to decide, but quick to execute. Nothing on earth would make me marry another man; I know every fibre of his character; and he knows a good many fibres of mine; so as {{there is nothing more}} to be learnt, why shouldn't we marry at once? On one point I am firm: I will never return to that castle as Miss Power. A nameless dread comes over me when I think of it--a fear that some uncanny {{influence}} of the dead De Stancys would drive me again from him. O, if it were to do that,' she murmured, burying her face in her hands, 'I really think it would be more than I could bear!' ...|$|E
60|$|A {{man with}} his intellect a clear, plain, {{geometric}} mirror, brilliantly sensitive of all objects and impressions around it, and imagining all things in their correct proportions--not twisted up into convex or concave, and distorting everything, so that he cannot see {{the truth of the}} matter without endless groping and manipulation--healthy, clear, and free, and all round about him. We never can attain that at all. In fact, the operations we have got into are destructive of it. You cannot, if you are going to do any decisive intellectual operation--if you are going to write a book--at least, I never could--without getting decidedly made ill by it, and really you must if it is your business--and you must follow out what you are at--and it sometimes is at the expense of health. Only remember at all times to get back as fast as possible out of it into health, and regard the real equilibrium as the centre of <b>things.</b> <b>You</b> <b>should</b> always look at the heilig, which means holy, and holy means healthy.|$|E

6000|$|... “Now, don’t {{make fun}} of me,” she replied, crossly, “I happen to know her quite well by sight, and she isn’t a bit like me. And it’s an odd <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> have {{mentioned}} her, for it so happens she’s just come into the room. That lady in black, with the yellow plume in her hat, there over by the door.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Maybe it {{was some}} danger {{that he could not}} be {{protected}} against. There's one <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> know. He always went about armed. His revolver was never out of his pocket. But, by bad luck, he was in his dressing gown and had left it in the bedroom last night. Once the bridge was up, I guess he thought he was safe." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then go, and God be with you. I'll warn {{certain of}} the {{faithful}} of your coming, so {{that you may not}} lack a friend at need. When you return, if you should ever return, come to me, for I have more influence with these Moslems than most, and may be able to serve you. I can say no more, and it is not safe that you should tarry here too long. Stay, I forget. There are two <b>things</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> know. The first is that the Emir Musa, he who seized the lady Heliodore, is about to be deposed. I have the news from the Caliph Harun himself, for with him I am on friendly terms because of a service I did him through my skill in medicine. The second is that Irene has beguiled Constantine, or bewitched him, I know not which. At least, by his own proclamation once more she rules the Empire jointly with himself, and that I think will be his death warrant, and perhaps yours also." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Really, my dear boy, I {{suppose the}} captain cannot be omnipresent. Some {{discretion}} must {{be left to}} the other officers. They probably know his ideas and {{what is to be done}} better than we do. You business men trouble yourselves too much about these <b>things.</b> <b>You</b> <b>should</b> take them more philosophically. For my part I always confide myself trustingly to these people. I enter a ship or railroad car with perfect faith. I say to myself, 'This captain, or this conductor, is a responsible man, selected with a view to my safety and comfort; he understands how to procure that safety and that comfort better than I do. He worries himself; he spends hours and nights of vigil to look after me and carry me to my destination. Why should I worry myself, who can only assist him by passive obedience? Why'--" [...] But here he was interrupted by a headlong plunge of the Excelsior, a feminine shriek that was half a laugh, the rapid patter of small feet and sweep of flying skirts down the slanting deck, and the sudden and violent contact of a pretty figure.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will tell}} you where you belong," [...] she said. [...] "In your heart you must know it, but you are {{suffering}} from that reaction which comes from failure {{to those people who}} are not used to failure. You belong to the head of <b>things.</b> <b>You</b> <b>should</b> hold up your right, hand, and the party you should lead should form itself about you. No, don't interrupt me," [...] she went on. [...] "You and all of us know that the country is in a bad way. She is feeling all the evils of a too-great prosperity, thrust upon her after a period of suffering. You can see the dangers ahead--I learnt them first from you {{in the pages of the}} reviews, when after the war you foretold the exact position in which we find ourselves to-day. Industrial wealth means the building up of a new democracy. The democracy already exists but it is unrepresented, because those people who should form its bulwark and its strength are attached to various factions of what is called the Labour Party. They don't know themselves yet. No Rienzi has arisen to hold up the looking-glass. If some one does not teach them to find themselves, there will be trouble. Mind, I am only repeating what you have told others." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{programme}} {{starts with}} Billie Piper entering a hackney carriage, as her character frequently does on Secret Diary of a Call Girl, and {{driving to the}} Mayfair Hotel. Whilst in the cab, Piper, through a voice-over, says [...] "the first <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> know is today, I'm {{going to meet a}} whore", a reference to the line in Episode 1 of Secret Diary of a Call Girl, [...] "the first <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> know about me is that I'm a whore". Piper walks into the Mayfair Hotel and walks across the lobby, heading towards the lift, another direct reference to Secret Diary of a Call Girl. As she enters the hotel the screen splits in two, showing the original scene from Secret Diary of a Call Girl. The scene was so similar to the original that various publications, including the Daily Mail, mistakenly reported that Piper was filming scenes for Secret Diary of a Call Girl.|$|R
