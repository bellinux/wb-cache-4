The complication rates, duration of thoracostomy tubes and length of hospital stay were collected as primary outcome variables.

5000|$|Indirectly heated cathode: In this type, the {{filament}} {{is not the}} cathode {{but rather}} heats the cathode which then emits electrons. Indirectly heated cathodes are used in most devices today. For example, in most vacuum tubes the cathode is a nickel tube with the filament inside it, and {{the heat from the}} filament causes the outside surface of the tube to emit electrons. [...] The filament of an indirectly heated cathode is usually called the heater. The main reason for using an indirectly heated cathode is to isolate the rest of the vacuum tube from the electric potential across the filament.

40|$|A {{streak tube}} having {{circular}} scan was designed, built and tested. Continuous circular scan, easily derived {{from out of}} phase sine waves applied to the conventional deflection plates, permits the timing of pulses traveling long baselines. At the <b>tube's</b> <b>output</b> a circular array of 720 elements is scanned to provide 30 to 40 picosecond resolution. Initial difficulties with electron bombarded silicon arrays were circumvented by using microchannel plates within the streak tube to provide the needed electronic amplification and digital sensitivity and coupling the 720 element arrays to the electron beam {{by means of a}} phosphor on a fiber optics.

Attention is given to modulator design, performance tests, the <b>tube's</b> <b>output</b> for a constant light source, the use of an exponential light source, and the effect of defocusing. The test results show that a range-corrected output with less than 10 % error between 1. 5 and 40 microsec can easily be obtained with the considered design. The accuracy could probably be improved to 6 % with more careful adjustment...|$|R
5000|$|Today, Dynaco is {{best remembered}} for its highly {{regarded}} vacuum tube stereo amplifier, the Stereo 70 (ST 70). Introduced in 1959, the ST 70 was {{available as a}} kit (Dynakit) intended for assembly by the purchaser or as a complete factory-wired unit. The ST 70 used four EL34 <b>output</b> <b>tubes,</b> one GZ34/5AR4 rectifier tube, two 7199 input (driver) <b>tubes,</b> two <b>output</b> transformers, one power transformer, and a preassembled printed circuit board (PCB) containing the driver circuit. It produced 35 watts per channel (wpc). The driver circuit had a single 7199 pentode/triode tube per channel, and used the driver tube to handle both voltage amplification and phase splitting. The output transformers are an ultralinear design, whereby part of the primary winding is fed back to the <b>output</b> <b>tube's</b> screen grid. This design reduced distortion and improved audio quality.|$|R

40|$|Introduction Quality control {{techniques}} {{used to test}} the components of the radiological system and verify that the equipment is operating satisfactorily. In this study, quality control (QC) assessment of conventional radiology devices was performed in frequently visited radiology centers of Khuzestan province, Iran. Materials and Methods Fifteen conventional radiology devices were examined, based on the protocol proposed in Report No. 77 by the Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine (IPEM). Ten standard QC tests, including voltage accuracy and reproducibility, exposure time accuracy and reproducibility, <b>tube</b> <b>output</b> linearity (time and milliampere), filtration (half-value layer), <b>tube</b> <b>output</b> (70 kV at FSD = 100 cm), <b>tube</b> <b>output</b> reproducibility and beam alignment were performed and assessed. All measurements were performed, using Barracuda multi-purpose detector. Results The reproducibility of voltage, exposure time and dose output, as well as output linearity, met the standard criteria in all devices. However, in 60 % of the units, the results of the beam alignment test were poor. We also found that 66. 7 % of the studied units offer services to more than 18, 000 patients annually or 50 patients per day. Conclusion Despite the fact that radiological devices in Khuzestan province are relatively old with high workload, the obtained results showed that these devices met the standard criteria. This may be mainly related to proper after-sale services, provided by the companies. Although these services may be expensive for radiology centers, the costs may be significantly reduced if QC is defined as a routine procedure performed by qualified medical physicists or radiation safety officers...|$|E

30|$|Based {{upon the}} {{available}} medical literature and clinical expertise, the Department of Surgical Education at the Orlando Regional Medical Center presented an algorithm {{similar to what}} we use in our institution (Cheatham 2009). However, this was based upon literature from other studies rather than upon results from their institution. It was not published as a peer-reviewed document, nor was it used in patients who {{were not involved in}} a trauma. In this evaluation, they depicted data based on a defined level of published data. Their recommendations regarding level-one evidence suggested that thoracostomy tube drainage should be[*]≤[*] 2  mL/kg/day or[*]≤[*] 200  mL/day before removal. Our algorithm suggests that thoracostomy <b>tube</b> <b>output</b> should be[*]≤[*] 200  mL/day to advance from wall suction to water seal or water seal to removal. These data were based on randomized studies evaluating the timing of thoracostomy tube removal in regards to the daily drainage volume (Younes et al. 2002; Hessami et al. 2009). Thus, both Hessami et al. and Younes et al. conducted prospective randomized investigations of 138 and 139 trauma patients and documented that a thoracostomy <b>tube</b> <b>output</b> of[*]<[*] 200  mL/day was just as safe as an output of < 150  mL/day.|$|E
40|$|Abstract OBJECTIVE: Tranexamic acid (TXA) and ɛ-aminocaproic acid (EACA) {{are used}} in {{coronary}} bypass surgery for antifibrinolytic therapy. Since the removal of aprotinin, data directly comparing their blood sparing effect and their side effects is still missing. METHODS: Fifty patients undergoing coronary bypass cardiac surgery at St. Vincent’s Hospital and Health Services in Indianapolis, IN were evaluated in a retrospective cohort study. Perioperative data was collected by a thorough chart review. Patients received EACA from 01 / 01 / 2013 to 04 / 05 / 2013 or TXA from 05 / 07 / 2013 to 12 / 31 / 2013. Primary outcome was the amount of chest <b>tube</b> <b>output</b> throughout the hospital stay. Secondary outcomes were the amount of blood transfusion requirements, post-operative complications, number of ICU days, need for re-exploration, and in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: All demographic and pre-operative parameters were well comparable. There {{was no difference in}} chest <b>tube</b> <b>output</b> (EACA 942 ± 371 mL vs. TXA 1162 ± 480 mL, p= 0. 077). There were also not any differences in blood transfusion requirements (EACA 4. 92 ± 3. 29 units vs. TXA 3. 44 ± 2. 10 units, p= 0. 064), nor in post-operative complications such as atrial fibrillation, unstable blood pressure, pneumonia, or pleural effusions related to surgery (EACA 20 % vs. TXA 32 %, p= 0. 520). There were not any patients in the study who experienced a need for re-exploration or in-hospital mortality. The number of days spent in the ICU (EACA 1. 60 ± 1. 35 vs. TXA 1. 08 ± 0. 4, p = 0. 0717) were also found to be statistically non-significant. CONCLUSIONS: TXA and EACA are comparable in the effect of chest <b>tube</b> <b>output</b> and blood transfusion requirements, as well as their adverse event profile. Although the number of days spent in the ICU approached statistical significance for favoring TXA, either agent would be appropriate to be utilized at the St. Vincent’s Hospital and Health Services in Indianapolis, IN...|$|E
