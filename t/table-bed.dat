40|$|We {{consider}} {{a model of}} self-avoiding walk on a lattice with on-site repulsion and an attraction for every vertex of the walk visited on the surface to study force-induced desorption of a linear polymer chain adsorbed on an attractive surface and use the exact enumeration technique for analyzing how the critical force for desorption $f_c(T) $ depends on the temperature. The curve $f_c(T) $ gives the boundary separating the adsorbed phase from the desorbed phase. Our results show that in two dimensions where surface is a line the force $f_c(T) $ increases monotonically as temperature is lowered and becomes almost constant at very low temperatures. In case of three-dimensions we, however, find re-entrance, i. e. $f_c(T) $ goes through a maximum as temperature is lowered. The behaviour of the polymer chain at different values of temperature and force is examined by calculating the probability distribution of the height {{from the surface of}} the vertex at which external force is applied.

40|$|PURPOSE: We {{sought to}} {{identify}} racial differences among histological subtypes of {{renal cell carcinoma}} (RCC) between black and non-black patients in an equal-access health care system. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We established a multi-institutional, prospective database of patients undergoing partial or radical nephrectomy between January 1, 2000 and Sept 31, 2009. For {{the purposes of this}} study, data captured included age at diagnosis, race, tumor size, presence of lymphovascular invasion, presence of capsular invasion, margin status, and tumor histology. RESULTS: 204 kidney tumors were identified (<b>Table-</b> 1). Of these, 117 (57. 4 %) were in black patients and 87 (42. 6 %) were in non-black patients. Age at surgery ranged from 37 to 87 with a median of 62. Tumor size ranged from 1. 0 to 22. 0 cm with a median of 5. 0 cm. Overall, tumors were composed of clear cell RCC in 97 cases (47. 5 %), papillary RCC in 65 cases (31. 9 %), chromophobe RCC in 13 cases (6. 4 %), collecting duct/medullary RCC in 2 cases (1. 0 %), RCC with multiple histological subtypes in 8 cases (3. 9 %), malignant tumors of other origin in 6 cases (2. 9 %), and benign histology in 13 cases (6. 4 %). Among black patients, papillary RCC was seen in 56 cases (47. 9 %), compared to 9 cases (10. 3 %) among non-black patients (p < 0. 001) (<b>Table-</b> 2). Clear cell RCC was present in 38 (32. 5 %) of black patients and in 59 (67. 8 %) of non-blacks (p < 0. 001).
