5|$|Although {{the houses}} at Gedi vary in size, their number of rooms, and their layout, the basic {{house at the}} site is a three-room structure, which usually {{contained}} a forecourt and domestic court. With the three-room layout, there was usually a long main room with two storage and sleeping quarters towards <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b> One of the back rooms usually had a storage compartment near the roof with access through a trapdoor. Latrines, usually located {{toward the back of}} the main room, were also present in many of the houses, while wells were present in the courtyards of some of the houses. One of the oldest stone houses dates to the fourteenth century and has a long narrow sunken court, which contrasts the wider and deeper courts found in houses constructed during the fifteenth century. The entrances of houses have a greater deal of variability in the configuration of their passageways, since many of the houses were highly concentrated and laid out to maximize the use of available space.|$|E
5|$|Kenwood {{has three}} floors: {{on the ground}} floor during the Lennon period the front door opened onto an {{entrance}} hall, where Lennon placed a suit of armour and a gorilla suit. Across the hall was a large living room, which had black carpets, two 18-foot sofas and a marble fireplace. To the left of the hall was a toilet, and through the living room was a dining room, where purple, velvet wallpaper was put up. Adjacent to the dining room, at <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> was a small sunroom. This was decorated with various pictures, caricatures and stickers, such as the one from the Safe as Milk debut album (1967) by Captain Beefheart & His Magic Band, and one advertising the Monterey Pop Festival. Photos published by The Beatles Book Monthly show the shelves of the sunroom filled with articles such as a large, ornate cross, a Mickey Mouse doll and a mortar and pestle, reportedly used by Lennon to mix various combinations of cocaine, amphetamine, barbiturates and LSD. There was also a yellow sofa or chaise-longue upon which Lennon would spend much of his time. It was a present from his aunt, Elizabeth Smith (née Stanley) also known as Mimi. Behind the sunroom was the split-level kitchen where state-of-the-art appliances were installed, so complex that a tutor had to come and give the Lennons lessons in their use.|$|E

During the daytime, for approximately 13 hours Genie's father tied her to a child's toilet in a makeshift harness designed to function as a straitjacket. While in the harness, she wore only diapers and could only move her extremities. At night he usually tied her into a sleeping bag and placed her in a crib with a metal-screen cover, keeping her arms and legs immobilized, and researchers believed that he sometimes left her on the child's toilet overnight.|$|E

At 10am the Danish Working Environment Authority (Arbejdstilsynet) had the demolition interrupted due to reported concerns about dust and the potential presence of asbestos. The demolition resumed at 11am. At 4pm, about one-third of the house had been removed. The demolition was broadcast live by webcam on TV2 News' website.|$|E
25|$|The {{garden was}} located behind the house, {{or on the}} {{southern}} side. The garden was grown above a man-made level platform where {{there used to be}} a hill, and was exactly one acre (about 4000sqm) in area. A gravel path runs from <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> to the southern edge, and was twelve feet (3.7m) wide during Mason's time period, the same width as the central passage in the house and the portico. Today, the path is narrower, crowded by boxwoods that are now about 250 years old. The path ends in an overlook extending out from the steep edge of the garden. From here, the Potomac river can be seen. The Gunston Hall museum website says that the view was more impressive during Mason's time, when the trees were cleared. The garden was most likely broken into four rectangles, with additional gravel paths running through and around it. To give the illusion from the house of all rectangles being the same size, the rectangles closer to the house were probably shorter than the rectangles farther away.|$|E

25|$|The Street family {{considered}} Harrison a skyscraper architect, so {{his decision}} to both plan and supervise the construction of their house in Scarborough, a hamlet of the village of Briarcliff Manor, surprised them. By October 6, 1937, the house that Harrison constructed had one story of stone {{in the shape of}} an L, with a short stone wall extending from <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> and a ramp path with a serpentine wall running up along {{the front of the house}} to the entrance. By March 7, 1938, the two-story house was completed. The finished house was built of local fieldstone in the shape of an L, using steel beams on the roofs of the house and garage, with sixteen-inch walls, glass porthole windows, and large panes of glass and doors on the back of the house—it was related in design to other early Modernist houses constructed in the late 1930s by the Modernists Walter Gropius and Marcel Breuer. Breuer was a proponent of the more modern International Style, and Gropius, as Director of the Bauhaus in Germany, applied the International Style when he designed the school's faculty housing and building around 1925-1926. Gropius and Breuer represented a new form of architectural design, one that did not look to the past, but rather to modern industry for inspiration.|$|E
25|$|It was {{a period}} of {{violence}} from 1978. In March 1979 the Olinga home was robbed though the temple was undisturbed and there was a suspicious accident where Olinga's car was rammed and forced down a hill by a troop transport vehicle, where he was robbed and left for dead, and Olinga's son George was disappeared for a week by soldiers of Amin. Death threats perhaps simply because of his prominence came to Olinga from his home town. Meanwhile, after President Amin fled in April the religion began to re-organize - there was the re-opening of the Bahá'í House of Worship again, and the beginning of reforming the national assembly in August. Neighbors and a garden servant boy bore witness mostly by hearing events of the execution of the Olinga family. On the evening of Sunday, September 16, 1979, the birthday of one of Olinga's daughters and planned as a day of a family reunion of which a few could not arrive in time, after 8pm local time five soldiers entered Olinga's home while one stood guard at the household gate and killed Olinga, his wife, and three of their five children. Trails of blood went from the kitchen to <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> and one of the children had been hurt and roughly bandaged before the family was executed. Enoch himself was killed out in the yard where he had been heard weeping after perhaps witnessing his dead family in the very same house he had joined the religion in. The news was conveyed initially by the garden servant to {{a member of the national}} committee that had been appointed and then to a 79-year-old pioneer, Claire Gung, who called internationally. Ultimately news reached the Universal House of Justice while it sat in session on the 17th. All the dead were buried in the Bahá'í cemetery on the temple grounds on the 25th while civil war and terrorism continued. The funeral included hundreds of Bahá'ís who could make the trip and several members of the government of Uganda.|$|E
