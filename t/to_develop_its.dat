5|$|Across North America, {{electricity}} transmission systems are interconnected into wide area synchronous grids, or interconnections. Suppliers are legally required to follow reliability standards. In 2006, Québec's transmission system {{was recognized by}} the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) as a full interconnection because it is asynchronous with neighboring systems. Québec will consequently be able <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> <b>its</b> own reliability standards, as needed, and these will apply {{in addition to the}} relevant North American standards. Besides the Quebec Interconnection, there are three other interconnections in North America: the Eastern Interconnection, the Western Interconnection, and the Electric Reliability Council of Texas.|$|E
5|$|After the elation {{of change}} {{following}} group {{action in the}} 1969 Stonewall riots in New York City, in the late 1970s and the early 1980s, some gays and lesbians became less accepting of bisexual or transgender people. Critics said that transgender people were acting out stereotypes and bisexuals were simply gay men or lesbian women who were afraid {{to come out and}} be honest about their identity. Each community has struggled <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> <b>its</b> own identity including whether, and how, to align with other gender and sexuality-based communities, at times excluding other subgroups; these conflicts continue to this day. LGBTQ activists and artists have created posters to raise consciousness about the issue since the movement began.|$|E

That same year, Nintendo announced a partnership with Sony <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> <b>its</b> own CD-ROM peripheral for the Super NES.

5|$|DuBois rose to {{national}} prominence {{as the leader}} of the Niagara Movement, a group of African-American activists who wanted equal rights for blacks. DuBois and his supporters opposed the Atlanta compromise, an agreement crafted by BookerT. Washington which provided that Southern blacks would work and submit to white political rule, while Southern whites guaranteed that blacks would receive basic educational and economic opportunities. Instead, DuBois insisted on full civil rights and increased political representation, which he believed would be brought about by the African-American intellectual elite. He referred to this group as the Talented Tenth and believed that African Americans needed the chances for advanced education <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> <b>its</b> leadership.|$|E
5|$|For the {{remainder}} of the 1890s, the CCE struggled unsuccessfully to raise the capital it needed to fund the construction. Whilst it did so it continued <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> <b>its</b> route proposals. In 1899, parliamentary permission was obtained to modify the route so that the Euston branch was extended northwards to connect to the main route {{at the south end of}} Camden High Street. The section of the main route between the two ends of the loop was omitted. In 1900, the CCE was taken over by a consortium led by American financier Charles Yerkes which raised the necessary money.|$|E

5|$|Many of {{the damaged}} houses were of poor construction, {{and in the}} wake of Althea, {{engineering}} studies of the destruction resulted in a new understanding of the structural design loads necessary to withstand severe winds. In particular, inadequate roof cladding and fastening systems were among the primary points of failure. Consequently, much stricter building codes were explored in Queensland and Australia as a whole. Three years later, Cyclone Tracy's devastation in Darwin, Northern Territory, bolstered the trend of more rigorous construction specifications in the country. Many of the buildings destroyed by Tracy were government housing units constructed according to new guidelines based on findings after Althea, showing the need for further study. The severe cyclones prompted Queensland <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> <b>its</b> first statewide building regulations in 1975; the new Queensland Home Building Code was fully adopted in the mid-1980s. Under the new regulations, roofs had to be more securely anchored than before using bolts and reinforced fastenings. Having seen the dangers of deficient construction first-hand, Townsville was the first community to enact the enhanced building standards, and served as a testing ground for further revisions. The Cyclone Testing Station, a wind damage research organisation housed within James Cook University's Townsville campus, was established in 1977 in response to cyclones Althea and Tracy.|$|E
