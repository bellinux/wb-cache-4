5|$|In 2008, Groundwork Hudson Valley, the {{coordinator}} of <b>the</b> <b>Saw</b> Mill River Coalition, received a three-year, $889,183 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Targeted Watershed Grant. One of 15 recipients from a nationwide pool {{of more than}} 100 applicants, the group cleans up garbage, removes invasive species, and plants native trees along the river. The group also marks storm drains that drain to the river. On September 25–26, 2009, <b>the</b> <b>Saw</b> Mill River Coalition organized a BioBlitz to catalog species of plant life, animal life, insects, fungi, and bacteria in the river and its watershed. The Coalition is also looking to restore the wetlands along the river {{in order to reduce}} flooding.|$|E
5|$|In the {{commercial}} {{center of the}} community, NY117 serves the Bedford Hills Metro-North station before widening to four lanes as it crosses the railroad tracks and connects to exit39 of <b>the</b> <b>Saw</b> Mill River Parkway. For the next mile (1.6km), NY117 runs alongside {{the northern edge of}} <b>the</b> <b>Saw</b> Mill River Parkway as it heads through another residential part of Bedford Hills as a two-lane road. At Harris Road, the route turns southeastward, crossing the parkway and the adjacent railroad tracks again as it intersects with the parkway's exit42. NY117's southeastward run on Harris Road ends just past the railroad crossing, where the highway turns northeast onto an unnamed road leading to a commercial and industrial area south of the hamlet of Katonah. After turning onto the highway, NY117 serves various businesses before the route ends at the southbound-only exit43 of <b>the</b> <b>Saw</b> Mill River Parkway. NY117 northbound feeds into the northbound direction of the parkway, while exit43 serves as the start of NY117 southbound.|$|E
5|$|On the north, <b>the</b> <b>Saw</b> Mill {{watershed}} is {{bordered by}} the watersheds of Gedney Brook and the Kisco River, {{both of which}} drain into New Croton Reservoir on the Croton River, one of several large reservoirs in that watershed {{that are part of}} New York City's water supply system. On the northeast, the adjacent watersheds drain into Kensico Reservoir, another that supplies the city. Moving south, the next watersheds are tributaries of the Bronx River, then Yonkers' Grassy Sprain Reservoir and finally Tibbetts Brook. To its west in the narrow strip between <b>the</b> <b>Saw</b> Mill and the Hudson are the Pocantico River and Sheldon Brook watersheds {{at the north end of}} the watershed, and those of unnamed shorter streams at the south.|$|E
40|$|In <b>the</b> <b>sawing</b> {{processes}} of solid woods and wood based materials with a fret saw blade, {{in order to}} make clear <b>the</b> <b>sawing</b> characteristics which are related to sawing-force components, saw-blade wear, machinability of <b>the</b> materials, <b>sawing</b> efficiency and so forth, a more fundamental research under <b>the</b> actual <b>sawing</b> conditions should be carried out. For that purpose, it is important and necessary to make clear the sawing-force components and <b>the</b> <b>sawing</b> phenomena. But few studies have dealt with the exact measurements of them, and so, the main objective {{of this study is to}} obtain quantitative information on them. In this study. <b>the</b> basic <b>sawing</b> tests of solid woods and wood based materials were performed, using an experimental apparatus designed for sawing with a fret <b>saw</b> blade. <b>The</b> main (Fp) and thrust (Fq) components of <b>the</b> <b>sawing</b> force were measured, And in addition to measurement of these components, <b>the</b> several <b>sawing</b> phenomena were observed and measured.

40|$|The {{shortage}} in wood supply {{makes the}} effort to find alternative for wood material {{become more and more}} important. It was reported that the outer parts of oil palm stems could be used as solid wood after being properly treated. Being a monocotyledon, oil palm stems have a contradictory characteristic to the conventional hardwoods and softwoods and thus <b>the</b> <b>sawing</b> patterns suitable for hardwoods and softwoods should not be suitable for the oil palm stems. Two modified sawing patterns (polygon sawing and cobweb sawing) plus one ordinary sawing pattern (life sawing) were compared in <b>the</b> <b>sawing</b> of oil palm stems. The {{purpose of this study was}} to find <b>the</b> most suitable <b>sawing</b> pattern for oil palm stems. <b>The</b> cobweb <b>sawing</b> provided <b>the</b> highest outer lumber recovery (35 %) followed by polygon sawing (27 %) and life <b>sawing</b> (23 %). <b>The</b> polygon <b>sawing</b> provided <b>the</b> highest occurrence of wide lumbers, followed by <b>the</b> cobweb <b>sawing</b> and life <b>sawing.</b> <b>The</b> cobweb <b>sawing</b> need more than twice effective sawing time (15. 4 min) than <b>the</b> life <b>sawing</b> and polygon <b>sawing.</b> In overall, <b>the</b> polygon <b>sawing</b> was <b>the</b> most suitable pattern for <b>the</b> <b>sawing</b> of oil palm stem...|$|R
5|$|Outside of Chappaqua, NY117 loosely {{parallels}} <b>the</b> <b>Saw</b> Mill River Parkway as it winds its way northeastward across residential {{parts of}} New Castle. The two parallel roads connect again {{by way of}} Roaring Brook Road, a four-lane arterial located midway between Chappaqua and the next community along NY117, the village of Mount Kisco. Roaring Brook Road also connects NY117 and <b>the</b> <b>Saw</b> Mill River Parkway to the global headquarters of Reader's Digest, which comprises a large complex bounded by NY117 {{to the east and}} the Metro-North tracks to the west. From here, NY117 takes on a more pronounced northeasterly alignment that takes the route past Mount Kisco Country Club and into the village of Mount Kisco.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the release}} of Saw III, Twisted Pictures and Brash Entertainment {{announced}} they were planning to create a game based on <b>the</b> <b>Saw</b> property. Although no release was confirmed, they stated that the game would most likely release alongside Saw IV. Originally, Brash Entertainment was going to develop the game and co-publish it with Twisted Pictures, the producers of all of <b>the</b> <b>Saw</b> films. The game's plot was originally to follow that of the first Saw film, with the player assuming control of various characters in Jigsaw's traps, but this was later changed as development progressed.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Saw</b> Mill River, {{then known}} as the Nepperhan River, acted as a {{boundary}} between the Manhattan Indians and the Weckquaesgeeks, members of the Algonquian family who fished the region's streams and lakes with rods and nets. The Manhattans occupied present-day New York City north to the river, while the Weckquaesgeeks occupied the land from the river north to the Pocantico River. The Manhattans' principal village, Nepperamack, was {{on the site of}} present-day Yonkers where <b>the</b> <b>Saw</b> Mill River discharges into the Hudson River. The Weckquaesgeeks settled the site of today's Dobbs Ferry, and on the river's banks west of White Plains.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. An {{investigation}} is reported of the temperatures in <b>the</b> <b>sawing</b> of granite with a circular sawblade under {{a wide range}} of machining parameters including cutting fluids and cutting modes. Temperature responses in <b>the</b> <b>sawing</b> contact zone were measured using a foil thermocouple. The measurement was subsequently used to analyze the influence of operating parameters on <b>the</b> <b>sawing</b> temperatures and <b>the</b> energy partition. For either down-cutting or up-cutting, either with cutting fluids or without cutting fluids, the temperatures in <b>the</b> <b>sawing</b> zone were found to increase with depth of cut, sawblade speed, and workpiece speed. The maximum temperature in <b>the</b> <b>sawing</b> without cutting fluids was found to be up to 400 °C whereas it was reduced to around 250 °C while using cutting fluids. The energy partition conducted to the workpiece is about 7 % ~ 10 % in dry sawing and about 2 % ~ 5 % in wet sawing...|$|R

40|$|A {{diamond wire}} sawing process was {{developed}} for slicing granite in order to complement <b>the</b> disk <b>sawing.</b> Machining characteristics and tool wear during wire sawing of a granite material that consists of three major minerals, that is, quartz, feldspar and mica, were systematically investigated. The material removal mechanism involved in <b>the</b> <b>sawing</b> was explored. <b>The</b> scanning electron microscope examination of <b>the</b> <b>sawn</b> surfaces of <b>the</b> granite and {{the analysis of the}} force and temperature involved in <b>the</b> <b>sawing</b> process indicated that the material removal of the granite was dominated by brittle fracture. The typical cleaving and slipping behaviors of feldspar and mica associated with sawing resulted in unique morphologies on <b>the</b> <b>sawn</b> granite surfaces. <b>The</b> tool wear of the process was characterized by the nonuniform wear of diamond beads impregnated on the wire, with the fore end of the diamond beads experiencing greater wear than the rear part...|$|R

5|$|Westchester's postwar {{development}} {{led to more}} stormwater runoff, {{which often}} flooded and closed the parkway. By 1958, engineers were urging that the river be cleaned up to reduce flooding. Still, illegal dumping and overflows continued. For example, storm runoff gave the Yonkers section the river's highest concentrations of heavy metals, PCBs, and other chemicals, {{according to a study}} of the river in 1983, the year the city stopped using <b>the</b> <b>Saw</b> Mill as its primary water source.

5|$|Commercially navigable only at its mouth, <b>the</b> <b>Saw</b> Mill River {{itself was}} useless {{as a way}} to bring crops to market, {{limiting}} settlement further upriver. Nevertheless, the roots of present-day communities along the river were established during the colonial era. In 1695, a land agent named Isaac See settled at the north bound of Philipse Manor, in the flat land between a bend in the river. Other farmers came to the area, and the settlement ultimately became today's village of Pleasantville.|$|E
5|$|Communities along <b>the</b> <b>Saw</b> Mill played minor {{parts in}} the Revolutionary War, {{especially}} after the Battle of White Plains in October 1776. The defeated Continentals retreated to the vicinity of Peekskill while the victorious British withdrew to Kingsbridge {{in what is now}} the Bronx. Neither side wanted to cede control of the Hudson Valley, which divided New England from the other colonies. This left most of Westchester unoccupied neutral ground. However, Westchester was not demilitarized. Local militias and raiding parties affiliated with both sides fought each other and terrorized the other's sympathizers and supporters. Many residents of southern Westchester abandoned their farms and drove their herds up the valley to Buttermilk Hill to protect them from Loyalist raids. The Continentals built forts near Hawthorne, where a minor tributary named Flykill Creek drained into <b>the</b> <b>Saw</b> Mill (roughly at the junction of today's Saw Mill and Taconic parkways), and built Yankee Dam to create a lake wide enough to slow any British progress up the river. At Chappaqua, the pacifist Quakers opened their meetinghouse as a hospital for injured Continental Army soldiers. Storm's tavern was a gathering place for Continental officers and, later, their French colleagues.|$|E
