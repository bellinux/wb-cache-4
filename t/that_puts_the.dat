5|$|Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore) is a {{kind and}} loving boy living in poverty with his parents (Noah Taylor and Helena Bonham Carter) and four {{bedridden}} grandparents. They all rely on his father for income, employed at a toothpaste factory, responsible for putting the caps on the tubes. However, Mr. Bucket eventually loses his job because the factory replaced him with a machine <b>that</b> <b>puts</b> <b>the</b> caps on the tubes. Down the street is Willy Wonka's (Johnny Depp) chocolate factory, which reopened after industrial espionage forced him into seclusion and sacking his employees. Charlie's Grandpa Joe (David Kelly) worked for Wonka before the termination.|$|E
5|$|Pilotwings 64 is a 3D amateur flight {{simulator}} <b>that</b> <b>puts</b> <b>the</b> player {{in control of}} one of six pilots {{as they try to}} earn pilot licenses through various forms of aviation. The events are flying an autogyro, using a jet pack, and hang gliding. Several bonus tasks are offered, such as skydiving and a human cannonball test. The game also puts focus on allowing the player to freely explore its detailed 3D environments, most notably a miniature representation of the United States.|$|E
5|$|Another {{game from}} the book is Civil War, a text-based {{computer}} game <b>that</b> <b>puts</b> <b>the</b> player against the computer in a simulation of the American Civil War. Civil War originated on multi-user mainframe computers in 1968, and simulates fourteen major battles of the conflict, with the human player as the South and the computer as the North. The player can control four direct variables which interact to determine a battle's outcome: how much of their {{money to spend on}} food, salaries, and ammunition, and which of four offensive or four defensive strategies to use. The side with the fewest casualties wins a battle, and if the player wins eight or more battles they win the game. After appearing in 101 BASIC Computer Games, Civil War was later {{one of a number of}} text-based games available on early 1980s pay-to-play systems.|$|E

5|$|Risk parity advocates {{assert that}} the unlevered risk parity {{portfolio}} is quite close to the tangency portfolio, as close as can be measured given uncertainties and noise in the data. Theoretical and empirical arguments are made {{in support of this}} contention. One specific set of assumptions <b>that</b> <b>puts</b> <b>the</b> risk parity portfolio on the efficient frontier is that the individual asset classes are uncorrelated and have identical Sharpe ratios. Risk parity critics rarely contest the claim that the risk parity portfolio is near the tangency portfolio but they say that the leveraged investment line is less steep and that the levered risk parity portfolio has slight or no advantage over 60% stocks / 40% bonds, and carries the disadvantage of greater explicit leverage.|$|E
5|$|The {{vertebral}} column in bowfin is ossified and {{in comparison to}} earlier fishes, the centra are the major support for the body, whereas in earlier fish the notochord was the main form of support. Neural spines and ribs provide additional support and help stabilize unpaired fins. In bowfin neural spines and ribs also increase in prominence, an evolutionary aspect that helps them stabilize unpaired fins. The evolution of the {{vertebral column}} allows the bowfin to withstand lateral bending <b>that</b> <b>puts</b> <b>the</b> column under compression without breaking. This, in turn, allows the bowfin to have more controlled and powerful movements, in comparison to fish that had only a notochord. The bowfin has a homocercal tail, {{which means that the}} tail has equal lobes that appear symmetrical.This type of tail gives the body a streamlined shape which allows the bowfin to improve its swimming ability by reducing drag. These types of tails are common in fish with gas bladders, because the bladder supplies the fish with natural buoyancy.|$|E
25|$|Integral humanism is a {{doctrine}} developed by Deendayal Upadhyaya and {{adopted by the}} Jana Sangh in 1965 as its official doctrine.

25|$|Unger {{sees the}} Christian-Romantic {{tradition}} {{as the one}} tradition <b>that</b> <b>puts</b> <b>the</b> individual {{at the center of}} the world and gives him the tools for the liberation of self and environment. However, similar to the world's religious and philosophical traditions, it fails to provide a lasting answer to the predicament of human existence. This failure is the constant danger that after liberation the self will return to its customary affairs and routine practices. Rather than moving onwards to greater feats of humanity and godlike existence, the individual will allow everyday affairs to again take over. This surrender to habit is directly linked to the defeat of the imagination. Thus metaphysical revolution is needed through a psychology of empowerment and an analysis of social conditions upon which this empowerment relies. Unger’s project begins here.|$|E
25|$|In recent years, several {{makers have}} begun to market compact B/C trombones that are {{especially}} well suited for young children learning to play the trombone who cannot reach the outer slide positions of full-length instruments. The fundamental note of the unenhanced length is C, but the short valved attachment <b>that</b> <b>puts</b> <b>the</b> instrument in B is open when the trigger is not depressed. While such instruments have no seventh slide position, C and B natural may be comfortably accessed on {{the first and second}} positions by using the trigger. A similar design ("Preacher model") was marketed by C.G. Conn in the 1920s, also under the Wurlitzer label. Currently, B/C trombones are available from many manufacturers, including German makers Günter Frost, Thein and Helmut Voigt, as well as the Yamaha Corporation.|$|E

500|$|For many millennia the Natives of Rohanda prosper in a Canopean induced {{climate of}} {{peaceful}} coexistence and accelerated development. Then an unforeseen [...] "cosmic re-alignment" [...] puts Rohanda {{out of phase}} with Canopus which causes the Lock to break.

500|$|The {{official}} {{philosophy of}} the BJP is [...] "Integral humanism," [...] a philosophy first formulated by Deendayal Upadhyaya in 1965, who described it as advocating an [...] "indigenous economic model <b>that</b> <b>puts</b> <b>the</b> human being at center stage." [...] It is committed to Hindutva, an ideology articulated by [...] Indian independence activist Vinayak Damodar Savarkar. According to the party, Hindutva is cultural nationalism favouring Indian culture over westernisation, thus it extends to all Indians regardless of religion. However, scholars and political analysts have called their Hindutva ideology an attempt to redefine India and recast it as a Hindu country {{to the exclusion of}} other religions, making it a Hindu nationalist party in a general sense. The BJP has slightly moderated its stance after the NDA was formed in 1998, due to the presence of parties with a broader set of ideologies.|$|E
500|$|English is {{an immensely}} rich {{language}} {{in terms of}} vocabulary, containing more synonyms than any other language. There are words which appear on the surface to mean {{exactly the same thing}} but which, in fact, have a slightly different shade of meaning and must be used appropriately if a speaker wants to convey precisely the message they intend to convey. It is generally stated that English has around 170,000 words, or 220,000 if obsolete words are counted; this estimate is based on the last full edition of the Oxford English Dictionary from 1989. Over half of these words are nouns, a quarter adjectives and a seventh verbs. There is one count <b>that</b> <b>puts</b> <b>the</b> English vocabulary at about 1 million wordsbut that count presumably includes words such as Latin species names, scientific terminology, prefixed and suffixed words, jargon, foreign words of extremely limited English use and technical acronyms.|$|E

When asked whether ignorance was not bliss in such matters, he stated that his knowledge means that he can now take measures to ward off the disease.

500|$|Siward and his force {{were said}} to have rescued Constantinople from a siege by [...] "heathens", after which the emperor Alexios offered Siward and his men {{positions}} in the Varangian Guard. According to both sources, Siward and some of the English expressed their desire to have a territory of their own, and so Alexius told them of a land over the sea that had formerly been part of the empire, but was now occupied by heathens. The emperor subsequently granted this land to the English, and a party led by Earl Siward sailed onwards to take control of it. The land, the sources allege, lay [...] "6 days north and north-east of Constantinople", a distance and direction <b>that</b> <b>puts</b> <b>the</b> territory somewhere in or around the Crimea and Sea of Azov. Earl Siward, after many battles, defeated and drove away the heathens. The Chronicon Laudunensis says that this territory was renamed [...] "New England", while the Játvarðar Saga claims that the towns of the land were named after English towns, including London and York.

500|$|For Dunne, the Dooley {{pieces were}} a burden, {{but one that}} brought him fame and money, neither of which was enough to keep him at his desk once he gained the Whitney legacy. Before he died in 1936, Dunne knew that {{interest}} in the Dooley pieces was fading, and this saddened him. [...] Understanding that readers were having trouble with the Irish dialect, he experimented with translating the columns into ordinary English, but published none in that form. In 1938, The New Republic noted in an article, [...] "if you try quoting Mr. Dooley's brogue to the average listener you will be rewarded {{with a look of}} intense pain. But if you translate Mr. Dooley into ordinary English nearly everything precipitates out as pure wisdom." [...] Ellis, writing in 1941, argued, [...] "that the Dooley essays are journalism of the finest type few will dispute; that they are literature in the more permanent sense may not be so clear. Were the American-Irish brogue of Mr. Dooley still a living and growing language there might be no doubt about it, but Mr. Dooley's language has become at least obsolescent, and <b>that</b> <b>puts</b> <b>the</b> future of the Dooley essay in serious question." [...] Ellis noted that attempts to imitate Dunne's success with other Irish-dialect columns failed, and suggested the brogue was not essential to the originals' [...] popularity, [...] "Dunne's essays lose nothing today when translated into ordinary English words".|$|E
