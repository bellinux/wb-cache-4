[...] However, when he pulled the film, the numeral [...] "0" [...] appeared instead. [...] He appeared to fiddle with the back of the wheel and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> out two films: one dark film (supposedly the [...] "cover" [...] film) and another film with the numeral [...] "2" [...] printed on it. [...] As he held those two films in his hand, the numeral [...] "0" [...] was still visible in the window of the violet wheel.|$|E
500|$|After {{the success}} of Dallas, Jacobs' {{presented}} his initial idea again and created Knots Landing, with some alterations of his original script. In an interview, Jacobs explained: [...] " [...] Well, that's pretty good, but you know-and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> out the pages that we'd left for them {{a few years ago}} on Knots Landing, or a year before on Knots, and he said, 'Is there any way we can make this a spin-off?' [...] I just took one of the couples and made it, you know, Val and Gary who had already been created on the parent series and putting them into the mix, but when you have four couples and you change one, you sort of have to change the dynamic all the way around. However, once I wrote the script, remarkably little changed from the script and the pilot as you would see it." [...] Gary Ewing was originally played by actor David Ackroyd, but Ackroyd was unable to sign on for the spin-off, and Ted Shackelford assumed the role. Initially, it was presumed that Charlene Tilton would be joining Knots Landing as Gary and Val's daughter, but the network decided to keep her on Dallas {{in order to keep the}} two shows separate. She did, however, make a guest appearance in the first season.|$|E
