5|$|In September 1811, William Henry Harrison, then {{governor}} of Indiana Territory, visited Kentucky and directed Colonel Samuel Wells <b>to</b> <b>recruit</b> Kentuckians {{for a new}} federal regiment then being formed by the authority of Secretary of War William Eustis. Harrison had not applied to Scott for permission <b>to</b> <b>recruit</b> in the state, and many Kentuckians– from Scott's political enemy, Humphrey Marshall, to his trusted advisor, Jesse Bledsoe– perceived this as a slight to the governor. Ignoring Bledsoe's indignation, Scott refused to make an issue of the faux pas and instead {{became one of the}} staunchest supporters of Harrison's rising career.|$|E

5|$|Sometimes {{in areas}} where the new wages were applied, {{factories}} would struggle <b>to</b> <b>recruit</b> workers for important tasks because the reform had given a low pay grade to a task that was considered to require a lower level of skill. For example, machine-tool operation was given a low pay grade, and at one factory in Kotlyakov some 30 machine-tools sat unused as factory managers were unable <b>to</b> <b>recruit</b> workers to operate them.|$|E
5|$|The Republicans {{initially}} struggled <b>to</b> <b>recruit</b> a candidate. Former Governor Douglas and Lieutenant Governor Phillip Scott announced {{early on}} {{that they would not}} run and it was not until March 2014 that a candidate entered the race: marijuana legalization activist and former Independent gubernatorial candidate Emily Peyton. This spurred Republicans <b>to</b> <b>recruit</b> a serious candidate, but they struggled to do so. Former Wall Street banker Bruce Lisman announced in May 2014 that he was not running, and attention turned to former State Senator and 2012 nominee Randy Brock, State Representative Heidi Scheuermann and businessman Scott Milne.|$|E
5|$|To {{termites}}, any {{breach of}} their tunnels or nests {{is a cause}} for alarm. When termites detect a potential breach, the soldiers usually bang their heads, apparently to attract other soldiers for defence and <b>to</b> <b>recruit</b> additional workers to repair any breach. Additionally, an alarmed termite bumps into other termites which causes them to be alarmed and to leave pheromone trails to the disturbed area, {{which is also a}} way <b>to</b> <b>recruit</b> extra workers.|$|E

They also tried <b>to</b> <b>recruit</b> Harry Thode from McMaster University, but found that Harold Urey from the Manhattan Project's SAM Laboratories was also {{interested}} in Thode's expertise in testing heavy water with mass spectrography, and had made a more attractive offer. A compromise was reached whereby Thode did work for the Montreal Laboratory, but remained at McMaster University. Promising young Canadian scientists were also recruited, including J.

5|$|In 212, the constitutio Antoniniana (Antonine decree) of emperor Caracalla granted Roman {{citizenship}} {{to all the}} free inhabitants of the Empire– the peregrini– thus abolishing their second-class status. But {{there is no evidence}} that the citizens-only rule for legions was also abolished at this time. The legions simply gained a much wider recruitment base, as they were now able <b>to</b> <b>recruit</b> any male free resident of the empire. Auxiliary units were now recruited mainly from Roman citizens, but probably continued <b>to</b> <b>recruit</b> non-citizen barbari from outside the Empire's borders. However, the citizens-only rule for legions appears to have been dropped some time during the 3rd century, as by the 4th-century Romans and barbarians are found serving together in all units.|$|E
