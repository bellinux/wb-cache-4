40|$|The {{population}} genetics and demography of soft corals, {{the second most}} abundant benthic invertebrate group on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), were investigated to identify <b>the</b> <b>proceses</b> that determine their abundance and distribution. The study focusses particularly on the interplay between <b>the</b> demographic <b>proceses</b> and life history strategies of soft corals that commonly lead to their dominance in many coral reef communities. My general objective was to identify the mechanisms that allow soft coral species, specifically Sinularia flexibilis and Clavularia koellikeri, to dominate nearshore communities and to determine the likely time scales involved. One potential mechanism to attain high cover is rapid colonisation of newly opened substrata, thus pre-empting space and preventing recruitment by potential competitors. The mortality caused by the 1998 -bleaching event constituted an opportunity to evaluate the role that recruitment plays in the dynamics of recovering soft coral assemblages. Living cover declined by half at study sites on nearshore reefs in the Palm Island group (central GBR) that had been dominated by soft corals prior to the bleaching. In contrast to the common expectation that soft corals rapidly colonise substrata, a slow recovery was documented {{in the three years}} following the mortality, with soft coral cover increasing by only 16...|$|R

Depending on these inputs, the sensor will show a detection and a lock-on range to the user. The detection range for the IR sensor was based on the intensity of the signal, above a specific threshold. For the TV system, target contrast was used. Atmospheric extinction was included. Several aspects of the SGI hardware and software capability were used to mimic physical problems and processes at considerable savings in computational effort. One was the use of the SGI Gouraud shading capability to establish the temperature distribution for IR targets; a second was use of the hardware (screen) projection to map from 3 -D to 2 -D.
