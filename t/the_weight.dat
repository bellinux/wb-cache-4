5|$|At the Jock River, {{southwest}} of Barrhaven, deposits of sensitive leda clay presented {{a challenge in}} designing the crossing for the freeway {{as well as the}} Canadian National Railway overpass to the north. It was feared that <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> of these structures could destabilize the clay deposits beneath and lead to landslides. In place of the standard heavier aggregate, lighter blast furnace slag, at half <b>the</b> <b>weight,</b> was substituted.|$|E
5|$|Because at {{any given}} point on Earth <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> of an object is {{proportional}} to its mass, the mass of an object in kilograms is usually measured by comparing its weight to <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> of a standard mass, whose mass is known in kilograms, using a device called a weighing scale. The ratio of {{the force of gravity}} on the two objects, measured by the scale, is equal to the ratio of their masses.|$|E
5|$|Gleason is {{also the}} namesake of the Gleason polynomials, a system of polynomials that {{generate}} <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> enumerators of linear codes. These polynomials take a particularly simple form for self-dual codes: in this case there are just two of them, the two bivariate polynomials x2+y2 and x8+14x2y2+y8. Gleason's student Jessie MacWilliams continued Gleason's work in this area, proving a relationship between <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> enumerators of codes and their duals that {{has become known as}} the MacWilliams identity.|$|E

30|$|The {{relations}} in (46) and (47) govern the transient {{behavior of the}} MSD and EMSE of the proposed algorithm. These relations show how {{the effect on the}} proposed algorithm’s transient behavior of <b>the</b> <b>weighting</b> matrix varies from one iteration to the next as <b>the</b> <b>weighting</b> matrix itself varies at each iteration. This is not the case in the simple fixed step-size DLMS in[6] where <b>the</b> <b>weighting</b> matrix remains constant for all iterations. Since <b>the</b> <b>weighting</b> matrix depends on the step-size matrix, which becomes very small asymptotically, then both the norm and influence of <b>the</b> <b>weighting</b> matrix also become asymptotically small. From the above relations, it is seen that both the MSD and EMSE become very small at steady-state because <b>the</b> <b>weighting</b> matrix itself becomes small at steady-state and these relations will then depend only on the product of <b>the</b> <b>weighting</b> matrices at each iteration.|$|R

But concrete domes also required expensive wooden formwork, also called shuttering, to be built and kept in place during the curing process, which would usually have to be destroyed to be removed. Formwork for brick domes need not be kept in place as long and could be more easily reused.|$|E
5|$|The {{limbs of}} the horse are {{structures}} made of dozens of bones, joints, muscles, tendons and ligaments that support <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> of the equine body. They include two apparatuses: the suspensory apparatus, which carries much of <b>the</b> <b>weight,</b> prevents overextension of the joint and absorbs shock, and the stay apparatus, which locks major joints in the limbs, allowing horses to remain standing while relaxed or asleep. The limbs play a major part in the movement {{of the horse}}, with the legs performing the functions of absorbing impact, bearing weight, and providing thrust. In general, the majority of <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> is borne by the front legs, while the rear legs provide propulsion. The hooves are also important structures, providing support, traction and shock absorption, and containing structures which provide blood flow through the lower leg. As the horse developed as a cursorial animal, with a primary defense mechanism of running over hard ground, its legs evolved to the long, sturdy, light-weight, one-toed form seen today.|$|E

5|$|Diamonds are {{extremely}} hard, but also brittle {{and can be}} split up by a single blow. Therefore, diamond cutting is traditionally considered as a delicate procedure requiring skills, scientific knowledge, tools and experience. Its final goal is to produce a faceted jewel where the specific angles between the facets would optimize the diamond luster, that is dispersion of white light, whereas the number and area of facets would determine <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> of the final product. <b>The</b> <b>weight</b> reduction upon cutting is significant and can be {{of the order of}} 50%. Several possible shapes are considered, but the final decision is often determined not only by scientific, but also practical considerations. For example, the diamond might be intended for display or for wear, in a ring or a necklace, singled or surrounded by other gems of certain color and shape. Some of them may be considered as classical, such as round, pear, marquise, oval, hearts and arrows diamonds, etc. Some of them are special, produced by certain companies, for example, Phoenix, Cushion, Sole Mio diamonds, etc.|$|E
