5|$|According to MCC {{guidelines}} for umpires, factors {{to consider when}} giving an lbw decision include the angle at which <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> was travelling and whether <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> was swinging through the air. He must also account for the height of <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> at impact and how far from the wicket the batsman was standing; from this information he must determine if <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> would have passed over the stumps or struck them. The MCC guidance states that {{it is easier to}} make a decision when <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> strikes the batsman without pitching, but that the difficulty increases when <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> has bounced and more so when there is a shorter time between <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> pitching and striking the batsman.|$|E
5|$|After {{a safety}} is scored, <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> {{is put into}} play by a free kick. The team that was scored upon must kick <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> from their own 20-yard line and can punt, drop kick, or place kick <b>the</b> <b>ball.</b> In {{professional}} play, a kicking tee cannot be used – however, a tee {{can be used in}} high school or college football. Once <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> has been kicked, it can be caught and advanced by any member of the receiving team, and it can be recovered by the kicking team if <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> travels at least 10 yards and bounces at least once or a player of the receiving team touches <b>the</b> <b>ball.</b>|$|E
5|$|Buffalo got <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> back {{at their}} own 21-yard line and were only able to advance it to their 34-yard line before punting <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> back to Connecticut. UConn cornerback Jasper Howard {{returned}} <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> 26yards to the Bulls' 41-yard line. The Huskies handed <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> to Donald Brown for five straight running plays, advancing <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> to the Buffalo 19-yard line as the first quarter clock expired. At {{the end of the}} first quarter, UConn held a 7–3 lead and looked to be in position to score more when the second quarter began.|$|E
5000|$|Putting <b>the</b> <b>Balls</b> Together: If both {{balls are}} caught {{at the same}} time, they may be [...] "put together," [...] at which point normal play stops. <b>The</b> <b>balls</b> may then be thrown {{according}} to {{the manner in which}} they are thrown when just two people are left. If the player trying to catch <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> fails, they receive an out. Note that <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> do not have to be put together, and that normal play could stop, as <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> are put together, and then begin anew if a player makes the catch and opts to separate them again.|$|R

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Balls,</b> {{also known}} as Storm and <b>the</b> <b>Balls,</b> were formed in May/June 2002 after Large moved to Portland from San Francisco. Storm and <b>the</b> <b>Balls</b> {{consisted}} of Davey Loprinzi (aka [...] "Hotrod" [...] Davey Nipples, formerly of Sweaty Nipples) on bass guitar, James Beaton on keyboards, and Brian Parnel on drums. <b>The</b> <b>Balls</b> drew what local media called a [...] "cult-like" [...] following in clubs, primarily during Wednesday night shows at Dante's. They perform [...] "lounge-core, mash-up" [...] renditions of artists such as ABBA, Black Sabbath, Cheap Trick, Billy Idol, Led Zeppelin, Motörhead and Olivia Newton-John {{as well as their}} own compositions.

5|$|On a kickoff, <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> {{is placed}} at the 35-yard line of the kicking team in {{professional}} and college play and at the 40-yard line in high school play. <b>The</b> <b>ball</b> may be drop-kicked or place-kicked. If a place kick is chosen, <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> can {{be placed on the}} ground or on a tee, and a holder may be used in either case. On a safety kick, the kicking team kicks <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> from their own 20-yard line. They can punt, drop-kick or place-kick <b>the</b> <b>ball,</b> but a tee may not be used in professional play. Any member of the receiving team may catch or advance <b>the</b> <b>ball,</b> and <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> may be recovered by the kicking team once it has gone at least ten yards and has touched the ground or has been touched by any member of the receiving team.|$|E

5|$|A batsman can be out lbw even if <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> did not hit his leg: for example, a batsman struck on {{the head}} could be lbw. However, he cannot be lbw if <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> pitches on the leg side of the stumps ("outside leg stump"), even if <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> would have {{otherwise}} hit the wickets. Similarly, a batsman who has attempted to hit <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> with his bat cannot be lbw if <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> strikes him outside the line of off stump. However, some shots in cricket, such as the switch hit or reverse sweep, involve the batsman switching between a right- and left-handed stance; this affects {{the location of the}} off and leg side, which are determined by the stance. The law explicitly states that the off side is determined by the batsman's position when the bowler commences his run-up.|$|E

5000|$|Another Mosconi Cup rule {{change in}} 2007 called for racking such that <b>the</b> 9 <b>ball</b> rather than <b>the</b> 1 <b>ball</b> is on <b>the</b> [...] (i.e. the racker rolls <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> forward farther; <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> remain in <b>the</b> same {{position}} in the rack), which further thwarts pocketing a wing ball easily.|$|R
5|$|A {{field goal}} (FG), worth three points, is scored when <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> is placekicked or dropkicked through the {{uprights}} {{and over the}} crossbars of the defense's goalposts. After a PAT attempt or successful field goal the scoring team must kick <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> off to the other team.|$|E
5|$|A {{safety is}} scored when <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> carrier is tackled {{in his own}} end zone. Safeties are worth two points, which are awarded to the defense. In addition, the team that conceded the safety must kick <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> to the scoring team via a free kick.|$|E
5|$|After a halftime {{performance}} featuring Lorrie Morgan, singer Steve Winwood and {{the marching}} bands of the competing schools, Alabama prepared to receive <b>the</b> <b>ball.</b> Because Virginia Tech received <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> {{to begin the}} game, Alabama was on offense to begin the second half.|$|E

50|$|For a {{sequence}} of same-weight elastic objects constrained to a straight path, the effect continues to each successive object. For example, when two balls are dropped to strike three stationary balls in a cradle, there is an unnoticed but crucial small distance between <b>the</b> two dropped <b>balls</b> and <b>the</b> action is as follows: <b>The</b> first moving <b>ball</b> that strikes <b>the</b> first stationary <b>ball</b> (<b>the</b> 2nd <b>ball</b> striking <b>the</b> 3rd <b>ball)</b> transfers all its velocity to <b>the</b> 3rd <b>ball</b> and stops. <b>The</b> 3rd <b>ball</b> then transfers <b>the</b> velocity to <b>the</b> 4th <b>ball</b> and stops, and then the 4th to <b>the</b> 5th <b>ball.</b> Right behind this sequence is <b>the</b> 1st <b>ball</b> transferring its velocity to <b>the</b> 2nd <b>ball</b> that had just been stopped, and the sequence repeats immediately and imperceptibly behind the first sequence, ejecting <b>the</b> 4th <b>ball</b> right behind <b>the</b> 5th <b>ball</b> with <b>the</b> same small separation that was between the two initial striking balls. If they are simply touching when they strike <b>the</b> 3rd <b>ball,</b> <b>the</b> more complete solution described below is {{necessary in order to}} be precise.|$|R
50|$|The {{motion of}} a {{bouncing}} ball obeys projectile motion. Many forces act {{on a real}} <b>ball,</b> namely <b>the</b> gravitational force (FG), the drag force due to air resistance (FD), the Magnus force due to <b>the</b> <b>ball's</b> spin (FM), and the buoyant force (FB). In general, one has to use Newton's second law taking all forces into account to analyze <b>the</b> <b>ball's</b> motion:where m is <b>the</b> <b>ball's</b> mass. Here, a, v, r represent <b>the</b> <b>ball's</b> acceleration, velocity, and position over time t.|$|R
5|$|After {{scoring a}} safety touch, the scoring team has {{the option of}} taking control of <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> and {{beginning}} play from their own 35-yard line, kicking <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> off from their 35-yard line, or accepting a kickoff from the 25-yard line {{of the team that}} conceded the score. If a kickoff is chosen it must be a place kick, and <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> can be held, placed on the ground, or placed on a tee prior to the kick. As in American football, <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> must go at least ten yards before it can be recovered by the kicking team.|$|E
5|$|After {{ten minutes}} {{interval}} <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> was again put in play, this time being kicked {{off by the}} Cliftons. The rest period had apparently stiffened the Cliftons, for the Academy making a vigorous spurt got <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> thru them, and Street, following it up well, scored a touchdown for the Academy.|$|E
5|$|After the kickoff, Virginia Tech's offense again {{failed to}} advance <b>the</b> <b>ball.</b> After a three-and-out, the Hokies again punted. <b>The</b> <b>ball</b> {{traveled}} 44yards, forcing the Eagles {{to start at}} their own 21-yard line.

Fifteen minutes {{from the end of the}} match QPR equalised, Marsh's shot with his right foot went in off the post. A corner followed for QPR who were now dominating Albion with their style of play. Allen crossed it in to Lazarus, but the Albion goalkeeper saved the shot with his legs. With eight minutes to go, one of Albion defenders mis-kicked <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> in their own penalty area. Hunt rushed in for the chance but Sheppard once again saved the game for Albion. <b>The</b> <b>ball</b> ran free to Mike Lazarus who tapped <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> into the back of an empty net to increase the scoreline to 3–2 in QPR's favour.

5|$|Another {{feature of}} <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> is its rubber layer; it was {{designed}} to allow a better response while retaining the impact energy and releases it in the coup. Its support material of cross-linked nitrogen-expanded foam improves its retention and durability of its shape. Polyester support fabric enhances structure and stability. The asymmetrical high-contrast graphic around <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> creates an optimal flicker as <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> rotates for a more powerful visual signal, allowing the player to more easily identify and track <b>the</b> <b>ball.</b>|$|E
5|$|Any runners {{already on}} base may attempt to advance on batted balls that land, or contact the ground, in fair territory, {{before or after}} <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> lands. A runner on first base must attempt to advance if a ball lands in play. If a ball hit into play rolls foul before passing through the infield, it becomes dead and any runners must return to the base they were at when the play began. If <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> is hit {{in the air and}} caught before it lands, the batter has flied out and any runners on base may attempt to advance only if they tag up or touch the base they were at when the play began, as or after <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> is caught.

50|$|Its {{construction}} {{differs from}} that of the Rzeppa in that <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> are a tight fit between two halves of the coupling and that no cage is used. <b>The</b> center <b>ball</b> rotates on a pin inserted in the outer race and serves as a locking medium for <b>the</b> four other <b>balls.</b> When both shafts are in line, that is, at an angle of 180 degrees, <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> lie in a plane that is 90 degrees to the shafts. If the driving shaft remains in the original position, any movement of the driven shaft will cause <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> to move one half of the angular distance. For example, when the driven shaft moves through an angle of 20 degrees, the angle between the two shafts is reduced to 160 degrees. <b>The</b> <b>balls</b> will move 10 degrees in the same direction, and the angle between the driving shaft and the plane in which <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> lie will be reduced to 80 degrees. This action fulfills the requirement that <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> lie in <b>the</b> plane that bisects the angle of drive. This type of Weiss joint is known as the Bendix-Weiss joint.|$|R
50|$|The {{variation}} called simple rotation {{does not}} count {{the value of}} <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> for a score but requires ascending numerical order in which <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> must be struck.

The frame ends when one player has pocketed eight or more balls.|$|R
