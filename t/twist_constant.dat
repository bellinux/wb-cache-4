40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the elasto-plastic behaviour of circular rods under combined torsion-tension loading Three aspects of the work were examined. In the first, an instrumented mechanical torque-tension machine was designed, built and commissioned to enable the application of biaxial loading under controlled conditions. The main features of the machine are (1) it can apply either simultaneous or individual loadings subject to a specific deformation history and (11) it provides the time variations of the controlling and the controlled deformation parameters using the appropriate load cells and tranducing elements. Whilst the machine was controlled by analogue signals, it was designed such that it could allow digital control of the different command signals. An analytical model to calculate the stiffness of the machine has been developed. The second was wholly devoted to the experimental investigations where solid, copper and steel, circular rods were subjected to complex non-proportional biaxial loading paths. In these paths, elasto-plastic torsion followed by tension, keeping the angle of <b>twist</b> <b>constant,</b> and elasto-plastic tension followed by torsion, holding the corresponding axial displacement constant, were examined. Other loading paths, where the initial axial loads and the torques were maintained constant, and where the torque and the axial load were applied successively, were also studied. The expenmental programme also considered the biaxial loading of thinwalled steel tubes. In the third, the experimental results were compared with two different analytical models from the literature Numerical solutions were also obtained along the lines descnbed in an available literature. Expenmentally, it has been observed that when the rod is initially subjected to a torque and then, keeping the angle of <b>twist</b> <b>constant,</b> to a gradually increasing axial load, the rod behaves as if its torque carrying ability becomes drastically reduced without in any way affecting its load carrying ability. Similarly, when the rod is initially subjected to an axial load and then, keeping the axial displacement constant, to a gradually increasing torque, the rod behaves as if its load carrying ability becomes drastically reduced without in any way affecting its torque carrying ability Such reductions in the load or torque capacity appear to be governed by the material plastic yield criterion. During the successively applied loading, it has been observed that when the rod is initially subjected to an initial torque and then to a successively applied axial load and torque, keeping the axial displacement or the angle of <b>twist</b> <b>constant</b> in an alternate manner, the rod soon regains its axial load carrying capability irrespective of the initially applied torque. Similarly, during the multiple alterations of successively applied torque or axial load, it has been observed that at any stage for the axial load or torque, whichever was applied subsequently, the rod regains its carrying capability of the parameter involved. Experimental test results with fitted strain gauges show that, even when the angle of twist or axial displacement was held constant, the strain readings increase rapidly with the decrease of the initially applied torque or axial load at the confined zone where the plastic deformation begins. Elsewhere of the specimen the strain readings decrease. The findings of this work have direct bearing on the relaxation of tightening torques or axial loads as experienced by critical engineering components, such as couplings, bolted joints and rotating shafts, which are subjected to similar type of biaxial loadings...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} work {{is concerned with}} the determination of elastic-plastic deformation behaviour of structural members to combined tension-torsion loadings. Three aspects of the work were examined. In the first, an adaptive control system is developed for performing combined tension and torsion tests on solid and thin-walled tubular specimens by using systems supplied by National Instruments to control the axial and torsion loads on the specimen through data acquisition boards. The LabView software in conjunction with data acquisition board, servo-controllers and servomotors form the adaptive control system for the torque-tension machine. The second aspect was to carry out experimental investigations, where solid steel rods (structural steel) were subjected to non-proportional combined tension-torsion loading paths. In these loading paths, initial elastic tension followed by torsion, holding corresponding axial displacement constant and initial elastic torsion followed by tension, keeping the corresponding angle of <b>twist</b> <b>constant,</b> were examined The experimental programme also considered the non-proportional combined tension-torsion loading of thin walled steel tubes. It has been observed experimentally that, when the rod is initially subjected to an axial load keeping the corresponding axial displacement constant and then followed by subsequently application of the torque the rod behaves as if its axial load carrying capacity decreases without affecting its torque carrying ability. Similarly when the rod is initially subjected to a torque, keeping its corresponding angle of <b>twist</b> <b>constant,</b> and then followed by subsequently application of the axial load the rod behaves as if its torque carrying capacity is reduced without affecting its axial load carrying ability. The third aspect was devoted to the finite element analysis. The finite element analysis package ANSYS (version 5. 7) was used for the analysis of the combined tension-torsion loadings of the steel rods. The geometry of the steel rod was supplied to the Ansys package and meshed. The preconditioning conjugate gradient (PCG) and the spare direct solver were used to solve all the combination of loads. Experimental results obtained were compared with computed values from the finite element analysis and are presented. Reasonably good agreement is obtained between the experimental and computed stresses and displacements. This work has direct bearing on the relaxation of tightening torques or axial loads as experienced by critical engineering components, such as couplings, bolted joints, rotating shafts, and steel structures that are subjected to similar types of combined loadings. It is also hoped that the information generated in this {{research work}} will guide the designer towards the use of more realistic materials and achieve better design...|$|E

40|$|The splay, twist, {{and bend}} elastic {{constants}} of an oxadiazole based bent-core liquid crystal have been measured as functions of temperature throughout the nematic phase. The splay elastic constant (K 11) behaves similarly to other bent-core systems, though it exhibits rather high values, varying between 8 - 14 pN. Further, anomalously low, temperature-independent values {{of both the}} twist and bend constants (K 22 and K 33) are found. The combination of such low values of both constants (~ 0. 15 pN and ~ 1. 2 pN) and temperature independence has not been observed in any type of nematic material previously. This unusual behaviour has been further investigated using two independent theoretical approaches; a molecular theory based on atomistic simulations of the real molecular structure and an analytical molecular-field theory. Computational calculations show good agreement with the experimental results for both the twist and bend constants. The statistical theory introduces a term related to chiral fluctuations that affects the <b>twist</b> <b>constant,</b> while the inclusion of polarity is known to explain low values of the bend constant.

40|$|Consider a fibred compact Kähler {{manifold}} X {{endowed with}} a relatively ample line bundle, such that each fibre admits a constant scalar curvature Kähler metric and has discrete automorphism group. Assuming {{the base of the}} fibration admits a twisted extremal metric where the twisting form is a certain Weil-Petersson type metric, we prove that X admits an extremal metric for polarisations making the fibres small. Thus X admits a constant scalar curvature Kähler metric if and only if the Futaki invariant vanishes. This extends a result of Fine, who proved this result when the base admits no continuous automorphisms. As consequences of our techniques, we obtain the following analogues for maps of various fundamental results for varieties: if a map admits a <b>twisted</b> <b>constant</b> scalar curvature Kähler metric metric, then its automorphism group is reductive; a twisted extremal metric is invariant under a maximal compact subgroup of the automorphism group of the map; there is a geometric interpretation for uniqueness of twisted extremal metrics on maps.

In the nematic phase, there are elementary splay defects (chain ends and hairpins), {{and in the}} hexagonal phase, there are both splay defects and twist defects. In the nematic phase, splay defects are free {{in the limit of}} large separation; i. e., their binding energy is finite.

We derive expressions for two correlation functions, the structure factor and the director fluctuation spectrum, in the presence of defects, and we use these correlation functions to define macroscopic Frank constants and elastic moduli. In the nematic phase, the presence of ionized splay defects causes the macroscopic splay constant K̂_ 1 to be finite. It is large and strongly temperature-dependent in the low-temperature regime, but smaller and temperature-independent in the higher-temperature Debye-Hückel regime.

40|$|Stiff, {{elongated}} biomolecules such as filamentous viruses, DNA or cellulose nanocrystals {{are known}} to form liquid crystals often exhibiting a helical supramolecular organization. Little {{is known about the}} microscopic origin, size and handedness of the helical pitch in these, so-called cholesteric phases. Experimental observations in chiral lyotropics suggest that long-ranged chiral forces of electrostatic origin acting between the mesogens are responsible for such organization. Using large-scale computer simulation we study the sensitivity of the pitch imparted by soft microscopic helices and confirm that the helical sense is sensitive to a change of packing fraction, magnitude of the molecular pitch and amplitude of the chiral interactions. In particular, we find evidence that the cholesteric helix sense may change spontaneously upon variation of particle density, at fixed molecular chirality. These pitch inversions have been reported in recent theoretical studies but simulation evidence remains elusive. We rationalize these sudden changes in the supramolecular helical symmetry on the basis of detailed measurements of the mean-torque generated by the twisting of the helices. The simulation methodology employed does not require confining the twisted nematic in a slab geometry and allows for a simultaneous measurement of the pitch and the <b>twist</b> elastic <b>constant.</b> We find that the <b>twist</b> elastic <b>constant</b> increases almost linearly with density suggesting that twisted nematic shows no signs of anomalous stiffening due to pre-smectic fluctuations at higher packing fraction.

The equations of the static interface have been solved, both numerically and using asymptotic analysis, with an emphasis on the effect of inclusion of the order parameter biaxiality on the physical properties. We have compared the results of the exact solutions to the commonly used de Gennes ansatz, which assumes positive and uniform unixiality through the interface. Although the de Gennes ansatz in general gives good results, when bend and splay elastic constants dominate over the <b>twist</b> <b>constants,</b> it can lead to errors of up to 10 % in the surface energy. The asymptotic analysis also shows that, by contrast with the de Gennes ansatz, the order parameter wings in the isotropic phase exhibit negative order parameter, with principal axis perpendicular to the surface. For moving interfaces, using an approximation which at this stage does not yet include hydrodynamic coupling, we have compared our results with the analogue of the de Gennes ansatz used by the present authors in an earlier paper. We find that including biaxiality leads to larger effects in the dynamic than in the static properties, and that whereas this is essentially a perturbation to the energy, the velocity of the moving interface can be significantly slowed down. The slowing down effects are strongly correlated with surface biaxiality, but both effects seem to be diminished when the isotropic phase is advancing...|$|R
