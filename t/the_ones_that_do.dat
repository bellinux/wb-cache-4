25|$|Most of {{the damage}} caused by Cyclone Namu {{occurred}} due to river flooding. The cyclone affected 48% of the Solomon's land area and 62% of its total population. Even though there are few rivers in the Solomon Islands, <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> <b>do</b> exist are shallow and flood easily. Of all the islands, Malaita was the worst affected by the cyclone due to Namu's rough seas and strong winds. Along the eastern coast of the island, damage was massive; entire villages were destroyed. Gardens were devastated and walking pathways were blocked. On Sikiana Island, a small island with a few hundred residents, only one house was left standing. In Babanakira, 5people died.|$|E
500|$|Cuthbert's letter also relates a five-line poem in {{the vernacular}} that Bede {{composed}} on his deathbed, known as [...] "Bede's Death Song". It is the most-widely copied Old English poem, and appears in 45 manuscripts, but its attribution to Bede is not certain—not all manuscripts name Bede as the author, and <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> <b>do</b> are of later origin than those that do not. Bede's remains may have been transferred to Durham Cathedral in the 11th century; his tomb there was looted in 1541, but the contents were probably re-interred in the Galilee chapel at the cathedral.|$|E
2500|$|Most flash ICs come in ball {{grid array}} (BGA) {{packages}}, and even <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> <b>do</b> not are often mounted on a PCB next to other BGA packages. After PCB Assembly, boards with BGA packages are often X-rayed {{to see if the}} balls are making proper connections to the proper pad, or if the BGA needs rework. These X-rays can erase programmed bits in a flash chip (convert programmed [...] "0" [...] bits into erased [...] "1" [...] bits). Erased bits ("1" [...] bits) are not affected by X-rays.|$|E

But, as for the average mistress--well it ain't a gal she wants, it's a plaster image, without any natural innards--a sort of thing as ain't 'uman, and ain't to be found in 'uman nature.

50|$|Until the {{publication}} of The Tarot, most English-speaking occultists {{had never heard of}} Case's Cube of Space concept, much less were they aware of how it related to the much better-known 'Tree of Life' diagram.

50|$|Many modern nations' {{views on}} the ethics of {{civilian}} casualties align with the Just War theory, which advocates a system of proportionality.
