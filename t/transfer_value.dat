25|$|A {{final point}} {{needs to be}} explained. It was noted above that when a {{candidate}} polls more votes than the quota, their surplus vote is distributed to other candidates. Thus, in the example given above, Hutchins's surplus was 909,698, or 1,446,231 (his primary vote) minus 536,533 (the quota). It may be asked: which 909,698 of Hutchins's 1,446,231 primary votes are distributed? Are they chosen at random from among his votes? In fact they are all distributed, but at less than their full value. Since 909,698 is 62.9% of 1,446,231, each of Hutchins's votes is transferred to other candidates as 62.9% of a vote: each vote {{is said to have}} a <b>transfer</b> <b>value</b> of 0.629. This avoids any possibility of an unrepresentative sample of his votes being transferred. After each count the candidate's progressive total is rounded down to the nearest whole number. This means that a small number of votes are lost by fractionation in the final count.|$|E

In January 2016, documents pertaining to the transfer were leaked which confirmed a then-world record transfer fee of €100.8million, eclipsing the previous record fee of £80million (€94million) for Cristiano Ronaldo in 2009. Bale played an integral role {{in his first season}} at Real Madrid, helping the club to win the 2013–14 Copa del Rey and UEFA Champions League, scoring in both finals. The following season, he won the UEFA Super Cup and scored in a third major final to help the club win the FIFA Club World Cup. Two years later, he was a key player in another Champions League run, winning the 2015–16 title and being elected to the UEFA Squad of the Season. He was also a finalist in the UEFA Best Player in Europe Award. In 2016, ESPN ranked Bale twelfth on its list of the world's most famous athletes.|$|E

Although practitioners generally recommend benefit function transfers, these are not always possible. Where unit <b>value</b> <b>transfers</b> are to be performed, appropriate protocols must be followed to select source studies, <b>transfer</b> <b>values,</b> and perform necessary value adjustments. This chapter demonstrates the processes and challenges involved in the implementation of unit <b>value</b> <b>transfers,</b> using case studies of environmental values in a peri-urban community on the east coast of Australia where key ecosystems ranged from coastal beaches to inland forests. Key issues in evaluating the potential for benefit transfer included the availability and quality of source studies, the extent of overlap between source studies and the target site, the need for different forms of adjustment to account for variations in scope and scale, and the limitations to unit <b>value</b> <b>transfers...</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{significant}} {{barrier to}} the assessment of ecosystem services {{is a lack of}} primary data, especially for cultural ecosystem services. Spatial <b>value</b> <b>transfer,</b> also known as benefits transfer, is a method to identify the probable locations of ecosystem services based on empirical spatial associations found in other geographic locations. To date, there has been no systematic evaluation of spatial <b>value</b> <b>transfer</b> methods for cultural ecosystem services identified through participatory mapping methods. This research paper addresses this knowledge gap by examining key variables that influence <b>value</b> <b>transfer</b> for cultural ecosystem services: (1) the geographic setting, (2) the type of ecosystem services, and (3) the land cover data selected for value-transfer. Spatial data from public participation GIS (PPGIS) processes in two regions in Norway were used to evaluate spatial <b>value</b> <b>transfer</b> where the actual mapped distribution of cultural ecosystem values were compared to maps generated using <b>value</b> <b>transfer</b> coefficients. Six cultural ecosystem values were evaluated using two different land cover classification systems GlobCover (300 m resolution) and CORINE (100 m resolution). <b>Value</b> <b>transfer</b> maps based on the distribution of mapped ecosystem values produced strongly correlated results to primary data in both regions. <b>Value</b> <b>transfer</b> for cultural ecosystems appear valid under conditions where the primary data and <b>value</b> <b>transfer</b> regions have similar physical landscapes, the social and cultural values of the human populations are similar, and the primary data sample sizes are large and unbiased. We suggest the use of non-economic <b>value</b> <b>transfer</b> coefficients derived from participatory mapping as the current best approach for estimating the importance and spatial distribution of cultural ecosystem services...|$|R
