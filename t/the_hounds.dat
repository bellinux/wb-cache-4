5|$|At Winterfell, Ramsay Bolton mourns {{the death}} of Myranda, but {{commands}} that her corpse be fed to <b>the</b> <b>hounds.</b> Roose Bolton warns him that, despite their victory, they could be facing {{the wrath of the}} Lannisters in the future, and as such, they must secure the loyalty of the North's other nobles. Roose blames Ramsay for losing Sansa Stark, who, as a child of Eddard Stark, could have been used as a figure-head for the North. As such, Roose implies that he will disinherit Ramsay if he cannot retrieve her and his unborn child is a son.|$|E
5|$|Back at school, Skinner's {{dress code}} demoralizes the {{students}} until a rainstorm soaks through the uniforms, causing the grey color {{to be washed}} out, revealing tie-dye colors that make the playful spirit of the children return. At the bowling alley, before the championship game begins, Burns gives the team new shirts. Two pins away from victory, Burns takes his turn. Otto tips over a vending machine and the vibrations help the Pin Pals win by knocking down the pins. As the team celebrates their win, Burns takes the trophy and keeps it for himself. Cheered on by his teammates, Homer attempts {{to break into the}} mansion and recover the trophy; however, this ends disastrously when <b>the</b> <b>hounds</b> are released and catch Homer {{a few feet from the}} gate, mauling him severely.|$|E

Immediately after, they are attacked by Biter and Rorge. Biter bites <b>the</b> <b>Hound's</b> neck, and <b>the</b> <b>Hound</b> kills him. <b>The</b> <b>Hound</b> believes that <b>the</b> outlaws are trying to kill him because he insulted King Joffrey Baratheon, but Rorge explains that Joffrey was poisoned at his wedding and that the bounty on <b>the</b> <b>Hound's</b> head is for killing Lannister soldiers. Arya recalls that Rorge had previously threatened to rape her, and, after learning his name, stabs him in the heart. Later, while <b>the</b> <b>Hound</b> tries to stitch his neck wound, Arya offers to cauterize the wound, but <b>the</b> <b>Hound</b> refuses due to his pyrophobia. He recounts how his brother Gregor caused his facial burns by pressing him into a fire, and she assists him in stitching the bite.|$|R

25|$|In the US, it is {{sometimes}} the practice to have some fox cubs chased but allowed to escape {{in order for them}} to learn evasion techniques and so that they can be tracked again in the future.

25|$|Around 1848 a {{group of}} volunteers from the Mexican–American War were {{eventually}} discharged and settled in San Francisco. Many of them were from New York City gangs from the Five Points and Bowery districts. About sixty of them organized into a gang called <b>the</b> <b>Hounds,</b> paraded around {{as if they were}} military, and even creating a headquarters named Tammany Hall within a tent on Kearney Street. In 1849, these thugs began to call themselves the Regulators as they harassed Mexicans and those of Spanish origin, and extorted money from local businesses for protection services. Anyone who would not pay was likely to lose a nose, ear, or suffer greater bodily injury. However, after {{a group of}} 230 men organized into a militia and confronted <b>the</b> <b>Hounds</b> with possible arrest, they quickly fled from San Francisco.|$|E
25|$|Drag hunting, an equestrian sport which {{involves}} dragging an object {{over the ground}} to lay a scent for <b>the</b> <b>hounds</b> to follow, can also be popular, either instead of, or in addition to, live quarry hunting. Drag hunts are often considered to be faster, with followers not having to wait while <b>the</b> <b>hounds</b> pick up a scent, and often covering an area far larger than a traditional hunt, which may even necessitate a change of horses halfway through. A non-equestrian variation, hound trailing, is practised in the Lake District. Since the UK hunting ban, hunts are using a mixture of an odoriferous substance with an oil {{in order to improve}} the persistence of the scent trail, and then to lay the scent about 20minutes in advance of the hunt. Bloodhounds are also used to hunt a human runner in the sport of Hunting the Clean Boot.|$|E
25|$|A keen foxhunter, Hill was {{master of}} the North Shropshire Foxhounds until 1823.

Hill also formed the Hawkstone Otter Hunt around 1800, which was maintained and hunted by successive Lords.|$|E
50|$|Brienne of Tarth and her squire, Podrick Payne, {{lose their}} horses {{as they make}} their way toward the Eyrie. They happen across Arya Stark and <b>the</b> <b>Hound,</b> Sandor Clegane. After Podrick {{recognises}} <b>the</b> <b>Hound,</b> Brienne deduces Arya's identity and tells her of her oath to her mother, Catelyn Stark. <b>The</b> <b>Hound</b> is unconvinced of her loyalties, pointing out her Lannister sword, and the matter quickly comes to blows. After a brutal brawl, Brienne knocks <b>the</b> <b>Hound</b> off a cliff, and unsuccessfully searches for Arya. After they leave, Arya emerges from hiding and finds <b>the</b> <b>Hound</b> grievously injured. Though he begs her for death, she instead takes his money and leaves him, presumably to die. Traveling by horse to a harbor, she buys passage on a ship bound for Braavos with the coin Jaqen H'ghar gave her ("Valar Morghulis").|$|R

25|$|A Pratt & Whitney J52-P-3 {{turbojet}} propelled <b>the</b> <b>Hound</b> Dog, {{instead of}} Navaho's ramjet engine. The J52 engine {{was located in}} a pod located beneath the rear fuselage, giving it an appearance similar to the Lockheed X-7 high-speed experimental drone. The J52-P-3 used in <b>the</b> <b>Hound</b> Dog, unlike J52s installed in aircraft like the A-4 Skyhawk or the A-6 Intruder, was optimized to run at maximum power during the missile's flight. As a result, <b>the</b> <b>Hound</b> Dog's version of the J52 had a short operating lifetime of only six hours. However, in combat, <b>the</b> <b>Hound</b> Dog was expected to self-destruct in less than six hours.|$|R
25|$|In his Historie of Ireland {{completed}} 1571, Edmund Campion gives {{a description}} of <b>the</b> <b>hounds</b> used for hunting the wolves on the Dublin and Wicklow mountains. He says: They (the Irish) are not without wolves and greyhounds to hunt them, bigger of bone and limb than a colt. Due to their popularity overseas many were exported to European royal houses leaving numbers in Ireland depleted. This led to a declaration by Oliver Cromwell himself being published in Kilkenny on 27 April 1652 to ensure that sufficient numbers remained to control the wolf population.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Hounds</b> was not {{the only}} group of criminals to set up {{business}} on San Francisco's Barbary Coast. By the end of 1849, several ships from Australia brought former members of Great Britain’s penal colony – including ex-convicts, ticket-of-leave men, and criminals – to San Francisco, where they would become known as the Sydney Ducks. These Australian immigrants had become so numerous that they dominated the neighborhood. They opened boarding houses and various types of groggeries which had prostitutes affiliated with their businesses. People who entered these groggeries and brothels were frequently later beaten and robbed.|$|E
25|$|The Army {{decided to}} use bloodhounds to track the Seminole. (Although General Taylor had {{requested}} and received permission to buy bloodhounds in 1838, he had not done so.) In early 1840, the Florida territorial government purchased bloodhounds from Cuba and hired Cuban handlers. Initial trials of <b>the</b> <b>hounds</b> had mixed results, and a public outcry arose {{against the use of}} the dogs, based on fears that they would be set on the Seminole in physical attacks, including against women and children. The Secretary of War ordered the dogs to be muzzled and kept on leashes while tracking. As bloodhounds cannot track through water, the Seminole easily evaded the dogs.|$|E
25|$|On September 22, 1966, Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara {{recommended}} retiring all of <b>the</b> remaining <b>Hound</b> Dog missiles {{within a}} few years. <b>The</b> <b>Hound</b> Dogs would be retained pending {{the outcome of the}} Terrain Contour Matching (TERCOM) guidance system development program.

25|$|One of {{the first}} {{attempts}} to use K9s in Policing was in 1889 by the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police of London, Sir Charles Warren. Warren's repeated failures at identifying and apprehending the serial killer Jack the Ripper had earned him much vilification from the press, including being denounced for not using bloodhounds to track the killer. He soon had two bloodhounds trained {{for the performance of}} a simple tracking test from the scene of another of the killer's crimes. The results were far from satisfactory, with one of <b>the</b> <b>hounds</b> biting the Commissioner and both dogs later running off, requiring a police search to find them.|$|E

25|$|The gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus), {{a distant}} {{relative}} of the European red fox, is also hunted in North America. It is an adept climber of trees, making it harder to hunt with hounds. The scent of the gray fox is {{not as strong as}} that of the red, therefore more time is needed for <b>the</b> <b>hounds</b> to take the scent. Unlike the red fox which, during the chase, will run far ahead from the pack, the gray fox will speed toward heavy brush, thus making it more difficult to pursue. Also unlike the red fox, which occurs more prominently in the northern United States, the more southern gray fox is rarely hunted on horseback, due to its densely covered habitat preferences.|$|E
