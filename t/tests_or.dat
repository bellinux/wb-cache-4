5|$|A {{diagnosis}} of psoriasis is usually {{based on the}} appearance of the skin. Skin characteristics typical for psoriasis are scaly, erythematous plaques, papules, or patches of skin that may be painful and itch. No special blood <b>tests</b> <b>or</b> diagnostic procedures are needed to make the diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|If a {{cylinder}} passes the listed procedures, but the condition remains doubtful, further tests {{can be applied}} to ensure that the cylinder is fit for use. Cylinders that fail the <b>tests</b> <b>or</b> inspection and cannot be fixed should be rendered unserviceable after notifying the owner of the reason for failure.|$|E
5|$|Tuberculosis {{prevention}} and control efforts rely {{primarily on the}} vaccination of infants and the detection and appropriate treatment of active cases. The World Health Organization has achieved some success with improved treatment regimens, and a small decrease in case numbers. The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends screening {{people who are at}} high risk for latent tuberculosis with either tuberculin skin <b>tests</b> <b>or</b> interferon-gamma release assays.|$|E
25|$|The {{condition}} is diagnosed by the patient's history, and by performing the Dix–Hallpike <b>test</b> <b>or</b> the roll <b>test,</b> <b>or</b> both.|$|R
5000|$|A Coombs test (also {{known as}} Coombs' <b>test,</b> antiglobulin <b>test</b> <b>or</b> AGT) is either of two {{clinical}} blood tests used in immunohematology and immunology. The two Coombs tests are the direct Coombs test (DCT, {{also known as}} direct antiglobulin <b>test</b> <b>or</b> DAT), and the indirect Coombs test (also known as indirect antiglobulin <b>test</b> <b>or</b> IAT) ...|$|R

5|$|Although Mold {{appeared}} for the North {{against the}} Australians, who toured again in 1896, {{he did not}} play any <b>Tests</b> <b>or</b> other representative cricket that year and his wicket total fell to 150 at 18.12; after this season, his bowling began to decline in effectiveness. Suffering frequently from injury in 1897, Mold failed to reach 100 wickets in the season for the first time. His 90 wickets in 1898 were taken at an average over 20, the only time his bowling average was so high, and he missed three {{weeks of the season}} owing to injury. After improving his record to 115 wickets at 18.68 during 1899, he was awarded a benefit match by Lancashire during 1900 which raised £2,050, a record total at the time and worth around £173,000 in 2010.|$|E
5|$|Most {{applicants}} {{choose to}} apply {{to one of the}} individual colleges, which work with each other to ensure that the best students gain a place somewhere at the university regardless of their college preferences. Shortlisting is based on achieved and predicted exam results, school references, and, in some subjects, written admission <b>tests</b> <b>or</b> candidate-submitted written work. Approximately 60% of applicants are shortlisted, although this varies by subject. If a large number of shortlisted applicants for a subject choose one college, then students who named that college may be reallocated randomly to under-subscribed colleges for the subject. The colleges then invite shortlisted candidates for interview, where they are provided with food and accommodation for around three days in December. Most applicants will be individually interviewed by academics at more than one college. Students from outside Europe can be interviewed remotely, for example, over the Internet.|$|E
5|$|The Albany Free School is {{the oldest}} independent, inner-city {{alternative}} school in the United States. Founded by Mary Leue in 1969 based on the English Summerhill School philosophy, the free school lets students learn at their own pace. It has no grades, <b>tests,</b> <b>or</b> firm schedule: students design their own daily plans for learning. The school is self-governed through a weekly, democratic all-school meeting run by students in Robert's Rules. Students and staff alike receive one equal vote apiece. Unlike Summerhill-style schools, the Albany Free School is a day school that serves predominantly working-class children. Nearly 80 percent of the school is eligible for reduced-price meals in the public schools. About 60 students {{between the ages of}} three and fourteen attend, and are staffed by six full-time teachers and a number of volunteers.|$|E
50|$|Testing {{is often}} either logical <b>testing</b> <b>or</b> {{physical}} <b>testing.</b> The test procedures may involve other criteria from mathematical <b>testing</b> <b>or</b> chemical <b>testing.</b> Beyond simple conformance other requirements for efficiency, interoperability or compliance may apply.|$|R
30|$|Trial {{characteristics}} {{associated with}} the presence of at least one patient-important outcome (primary or secondary outcome) were identified in univariate analysis, using Chi-square <b>test</b> <b>or</b> Fisher’s <b>test</b> for categorical variables and Student’s <b>test</b> <b>or</b> Wilcoxon’s <b>test</b> for continuous variables.|$|R
30|$|Results are {{reported}} as medians and quartiles (interquartile range, IQR) or numbers (%). Categorical variables were compared using the Chi-square <b>test</b> <b>or</b> Fisher’s exact <b>test,</b> as appropriate, and continuous variables were compared using the nonparametric Wilcoxon <b>test</b> <b>or</b> the Mann–Whitney <b>test.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{use of a}} {{subwoofer}} augments {{the bass}} capability of the main speakers, and allows them to be smaller without sacrificing low frequency capability. A subwoofer does not necessarily provide superior bass performance in comparison to large conventional loudspeakers on ordinary music recordings due to the typical lack of very low frequency content on such sources. However, there are recordings with substantial low frequency content that most conventional loudspeakers are ill-equipped to handle {{without the help of}} a subwoofer, especially at high playback levels, such as music for pipe organs with 32' (9.75 meter) bass pipes (16Hz), very large bass drums on symphony orchestra recordings and electronic music with extremely low synth bass parts, such as bass <b>tests</b> <b>or</b> bass songs.|$|E

50|$|Dependent on the country, {{other tests}} may be required, {{such as an}} {{eyesight}} <b>test</b> <b>or</b> a reaction <b>test.</b> These {{may be part of}} the theory <b>test</b> <b>or</b> the practical <b>test</b> <b>or</b> may be separate tests, in which case they are usually a prerequisite for admission to the practical test. The United Kingdom and some other countries use a Hazard Perception Test as part of the theory test, in which candidates are shown multiple short video clips of driving scenarios and must respond to any emerging hazards.|$|R
30|$|Statistical {{analysis}} of the data was performed using SPSS 16.0 (IBM, Somers, NY). Data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation (SD) if normally distributed (Kolmogorov–Smirnov <b>test)</b> <b>or</b> as median (25 – 75 % interquartile range, IQR). Categorical variables are presented as the number and percentage. For comparison of values between different study times, the paired Student’s t <b>test</b> <b>or</b> Wilcoxon <b>test</b> was performed when appropriate. For the comparison between responders and non-responders, the Mann–Whitney U <b>test</b> <b>or</b> two-tailed Student’s t test was performed when appropriate. Differences were considered significant at p <  0.05.|$|R
30|$|Between-group {{comparisons}} {{for secondary}} endpoints were made using the Chi-square <b>test</b> (<b>or</b> Fisher’s exact <b>test</b> when the expected cell frequency was < 5) for qualitative endpoints and the Student t <b>test</b> (<b>or</b> Mann–Whitney U <b>test</b> {{in the case}} of non-Gaussian distribution) for quantitative endpoints. No adjustment was made for multiple comparisons.|$|R
