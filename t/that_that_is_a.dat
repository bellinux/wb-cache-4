In 2013, writer Jay Fosgitt marketed to publishing company Archaia Entertainment the idea of reviving The Land of Gorch characters in comic book format with a new storyline.|$|E
500|$|GameFans Levi Buchanan praised Destruction Derby 64 as [...] "the best racer for the Nintendo 64 this year", and he lauded its [...] "simplistic control" [...] as {{a remedy}} for the complex {{controls}} that he believed had [...] "ruined the PlayStation versions". He liked its graphics but wrote that its music [...] "isn’t too hot". Buchanan enjoyed its multiplayer component and wrote that [...] "the slowdown when all four join in is minima—nice programming {{on the part of}} Looking Glass". Although he complained that the game's vehicle damage is not [...] "segmented throughout your car", he concluded by calling the game [...] "pure, unadulterated fun [...] has enough tracks and hidden vehicles to keep you playing for a very long time". Jeff Gerstmann of GameSpot wrote, [...] "Graphically, Destruction Derby 64 surpasses the old PlayStation games by quite a bit - not <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> particularly hard thing to do". He found that its framerate was adequate even in split-screen mode, and concluded that it was [...] "a better game than its PlayStation counterparts". He finished, [...] "Give it a rent next time you're rounding up the posse for a day of gaming." ...|$|E

[...] People are going to have different ideas. That's why we have states. We ought to give great leeway to states and not have the federal government and not have the Supreme Court of the United States making social policy that's contrary to the traditions of this country and changing that overnight. And that's what's happened in a lot of these areas.|$|E

500|$|When Pee-wee's fame started growing, Reubens {{started to}} move away from the spotlight, keeping his name under wraps and making all his public {{appearance}} and interviews in character while billing Pee-wee as playing himself; Reubens was trying to [...] "get the public to think <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> real person". Later on he would even prefer his parents be known only as Honey Herman and Herman Herman. In the early and mid-1980s, Reubens made several guest appearances on Late Night with David Letterman as Pee-wee Herman which gave Pee-wee an even bigger following. During the mid-1980s, Reubens traveled the United States with a whole new The Pee-wee Herman Show, playing notably at the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis, Caroline's in New York City and, in 1984, in front of a full Carnegie Hall.|$|R

Guaiacol, {{instead of a}} full creosote solution, was suggested by Hermann Sahli in 1887; he argued it had the active chemical of creosote and {{had the advantage of}} being of definite composition and of having a less unpleasant taste and odor. A number of solutions of both creosote and guaiacol appeared on the market, such as phosphotal and guaicophosphal, phosphites of creosote and guaiacol; eosot and geosot, valerinates of creosote and guaicol; phosot and taphosot, phosphate and tannophospate of creosote; and creosotal and tanosal, tannates of creosote. Creosote and eucalptus oil <b>were</b> also <b>a</b> remedy used together, administered through a vaporizor and inhaler.
