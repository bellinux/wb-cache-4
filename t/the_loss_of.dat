The experimental material were potato tubers of Ibis, Mila and Muza varieties with elevated nitrate (175. 4 - 250. 7 mg NO 3 • kg - 1) and nitrite (1. 7 - 4. 3 mg NO 2 • kg - 1) content. <b>The</b> <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> nitrites occurring after the preliminary processing (washing, manual peeling and rinsing) were greater than nitrates and ranged from 25 to 75 % and from 18 to 40 %, respectively.

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{experiment}} was to analyze selected reproductive characteristics in sows and <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> piglets according to their age and to evaluate the effect of sex on survivability of piglets before weaning. The experimental observation involved 80 sows with their second litters (40 sows of genotye I and 40 sows of genotype II). The sows were mated with a boar of Danish Duroc. No {{significant difference was found}} between the evaluated genotypes of sows in numbers of live‑born piglets and reared piglets, however it is evident that better results were reached by the sows of the genotype II. Also <b>the</b> <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> piglets per litter were lower, by 0. 65 piece (P ≤ 0. 05). In sows of the genotype I a high correlation (P ≤ 0. 01) was confirmed between the number of live‑born piglets and the number of reared piglets per litter (r = 0. 750). Another correlation was found between the number of live‑born piglets and their losses before weaning (r = 0. 716). Similar trend was observed in the genotype II, however without significant correlation between the number of live‑born piglets and <b>the</b> <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> piglets before weaning. The results also revealed that the piglets died mostly before the 14 th day <b>of</b> age, while <b>the</b> <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> male piglets were more frequent than <b>of</b> female piglets. <b>Losses</b> <b>of</b> female piglets of the genotype I before the 14 th day of age were 6. 82 %, in the genotype II they were 3. 01 %.
