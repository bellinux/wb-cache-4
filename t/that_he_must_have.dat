5|$|Meanwhile, Mr. Burns learns of the school's oil and {{immediately}} decides <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> it, even as Smithers voices his disapproval. After failing to convince Principal Skinner {{to give him}} the oil, Mr. Burns establishes a slant drilling operation and beats the school to tapping the oil well. The school is told they have no legal recourse, and Willie and Puente are laid off to cover the school's losses.|$|E
5|$|Philip {{was born}} in a village in Auranitis, part of the {{district}} of Trachonitis, east of the Sea of Galilee in Palestine. Philip renamed the village Philippopolis (the modern al-Shahbā', Syria) during his reign as emperor. He was one of only three Easterners to be made emperor before the decisive separation of East and West in 395. (The other two were Elagabalus and Alexander Severus). Even among Easterners Philip was atypical, as he was an Arab, not a Greek. His father was Julius Marinus; nothing besides his name is known, but the name indicates that he held Roman citizenship and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> been prominent in his community.|$|E
5|$|Another {{controversy}} {{surrounds the}} sole {{survivor of the}} flight, a Czech officer, Eduard Prchal. Prchal, like many pilots who {{did not wish to}} tempt fate was known for never wearing his Mae West life jacket — but on this occasion, when rescued from the sea, he was wearing one. During the inquiry he denied this, and later blamed the inconsistency on post-crash shock affecting his actions and memory – essentially, on amnesia. Later he explained <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> instinctively put the vest on when he realised the plane was in trouble. Polish aviation expert Jerzy Maryniak created a simulation of the crash, in which he concluded that the plane must have been under control up until the very moment of the crash. Kisielewski argues that the plane was likely {{under the control of the}} second pilot, who died in the crash.|$|E

5|$|Bruce's {{regiment}} {{landed at}} Cape Helles in mid-1915, where he fully distinguished {{himself in the}} construction of trenches and as an able commander. His battalion suffered heavy casualties over the coming months, and Bruce himself was wounded on 3 June by a shot to the arm, though it was this injury that spared him from a major assault by his battalion on 4 June in which many of his peers perished. He later reflected <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> been kept on earth for some purpose. He returned to the front lines and his division moved to the new front at Suvla Bay, where it was involved in particularly heavy fighting and sustained trench warfare throughout August and September. Bruce received the Military Cross and the Croix de Guerre for his service during these months, and rose to the rank of captain on 5 August. He was wounded again on 26 September, this time by a shot to the knee, which left him crippled for several years and forced him to return to England to recuperate, while the rest of his regiment were transferred to France after the abandonment of the Gallipoli campaign.|$|E
25|$|Chauncey Rowland Brown's {{reputation}} preceded him {{and led to}} many rumors. It {{was said}} he knew {{a little too much}} about gangsters; <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> been a communist because he thought capitalism was flawed; that he was hot headed and irresponsible; that he had been a professional boxer; that he was a heavy drinker.|$|E
25|$|Supporters of bin Laden {{have also}} pointed to reports {{according}} to which the Islamic prophet Muhammad attacked towns at night or with catapults, and argued <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> condoned incidental harm to noncombatants, since {{it would have been}} impossible to distinguish them from combatants during such attacks. These arguments were not widely accepted by Muslims.|$|E
60|$|He {{spoke in}} Italian, with the Tuscan rusticity of accent, and an unshaped sort of utterance, betokening <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>must</b> {{heretofore}} <b>have</b> been chiefly conversant with rural people.|$|R

25|$|No {{record of}} Tilney's {{education}} survives. He evidently learned Latin, French, Italian and Spanish because his early works indicate his acquaintance {{not only with}} the languages but also with subjects such as law, history, economics and genealogy. There is speculation <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> travelled because travel was regarded as a part of one's education at that time.|$|E
25|$|Three {{specific}} {{levels of}} knowledge are often discussed in Christology as beatific, infused and acquired knowledge. Those (such as Thomas Aquinas) who {{adhere to the}} principle of the Perfection of Christ reason <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> had beatific knowledge of all things from The Word from the very beginning due to his perfection. However, the views of Aquinas are not generally accepted by all Christians.|$|E
25|$|The {{start of}} Pytheas's voyage is unknown. The Carthaginians had closed the Strait of Gibraltar to all ships from other nations. Some historians, mainly {{of the late}} 19th century and before, {{therefore}} speculated (on no evidence) <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> traveled overland {{to the mouth of}} the Loire or the Garonne. Others believed that, to avoid the Carthaginian blockade, he may have stuck close to land and sailed only at night, or taken advantage of a temporary lapse in the blockade.|$|E
60|$|In {{less than}} five minutes the first party {{was on its way to}} the blazed tree. Dan Gilbert feeling certain that if Pawnee Brown <b>had</b> passed <b>that</b> way <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> seen the sign and left word of his own.|$|R

50|$|Philip is {{revealed}} {{not to be}} a chief's son from Africa, but from Croydon, adopting his false persona {{to start a new life}} and gain respect. When Rigsby finds out, <b>he</b> tells Philip <b>that</b> <b>he</b> believes <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> some royal ancestry and he does not tell the rest of the characters about his deception. This plotline is from the original stageplay The Banana Box.|$|R
25|$|<b>That</b> <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> {{been well}} practised in {{surveying}} {{is shown by}} his descriptions of surveying instruments, especially the water level or chorobates, which he compares favourably with the groma, a device using plumb lines. They were essential in all building operations, but especially in aqueduct construction, where a uniform gradient was important to the provision of a regular supply of water without damage to {{the walls of the}} channel. He also developed one of the first odometers, consisting of a wheel of known circumference that dropped a pebble into a container on every rotation.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of the king, the {{resources}} and tools with which to rule are that he have his land fully manned: he must have praying men, fighting men and working men. You know also that without these tools no king may make his ability known. Another aspect of his resources is <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> the means of support for his tools, the three classes of men. These, then, are their means of support: land to live on, gifts, weapons, food, ale, clothing and whatever else is necessary {{for each of the three}} classes of men.|$|E
25|$|Muttu Krishnappa Nayak was {{succeeded by}} his eldest son, Muttu Virappa. He began the {{construction}} of the Dindigul Fort at Dindigul on the Hill, along with the Temple on it, which later was completed by Tirumalai Nayak. Muttu Virappa's rule was in general not noteworthy and he is said to have allowed his favourites to tyrannise the people unchecked. Muttu Virappa is said to have had several vassals under him indicating <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> already obtained great power; and he is stated to have paid the Vijayanagara king at Chandragiri a tribute of 600,000 pagodas in 1616.|$|E
50|$|He {{was still}} alive in 1626 as is testified by a {{painting}} dated in <b>that</b> year. <b>He</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> died in or before 1628 as two works he had left as inheritance to a niece were bought in 1628 by the Archduchess Isabella.|$|R

25|$|Portolá {{returned}} by land to Monterey the next year, having concluded <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> been at Vizcaino's Port of Monterey after all. The land party was met at Monterey by Junípero Serra who traveled by sea. Portolá erected the Presidio of Monterey {{to defend the}} port and, on June 3, 1770, Serra founded the Cathedral of San Carlos Borromeo inside the presidio enclosure. Portolá returned to Mexico, replaced in Monterey by Captain Pedro Fages, who had been third in command on the exploratory expeditions. Fages became the second governor of Alta California, serving from 1770 to 1774.|$|E
25|$|Bhagwan Gopinath, {{being an}} introvert, {{was a man}} of few words and had a {{straightforward}} demeanor. He is known to have always shunned publicity and covered himself with anonymity. As such, various religious commentators along with his devotees have found it difficult to classify his spiritual journey into a particular school of Indian philosophical thought. Its widely believed <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> followed the tenets of trika doctrine of advaita (non-dual) Kashmir Shaivism (in which, the Goddess Bhairavi-Aghoreshwari is enthroned above God Bhairava and is the main ideal of worship) with jnana (knowledge), iccha (will) and kriya (action) having had a dominating influence on him.|$|E
25|$|When Gladiolus {{reaches the}} inner sanctum, he {{must go on}} alone and face Gilgamesh in combat. Gilgamesh {{challenges}} him once again, repeating Cor's warning {{that he may be}} risking his life for nothing. The two fight and Gladiolus emerges victorious, but not before Gilgamesh scars him. Gilgamesh reveals that there is no ultimate power, but reminds Gladiolus <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> been a capable warrior to defeat him and so should be reassured of his ability to defend Noctis. He offers Gladiolus his favourite sword, which is revealed to have been Cor's. Gladiolus and Cor leave the Tempering Grounds, with Gladiolus planning to reunite with the party while reflecting on the experience.|$|E
60|$|Dick Varley's {{fears and}} troubles, in the meantime, were ended. On the day {{following}} he awoke refreshed and happy--so happy and light at heart, {{as he felt}} the glow of returning health coursing through his veins, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> fancied <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> dreamed it all. In fact, he was so certain that his muscles were strong <b>that</b> <b>he</b> endeavoured to leap up, but was powerfully convinced of his true condition by the miserable stagger that resulted from the effort.|$|R

25|$|Heseltine {{was granted}} leave {{to contest the}} General Election in October that year; {{according}} to Ian Josephs this had been his plan from the start. Afterwards he applied on business grounds for exemption from return to the Army, {{in part because of}} difficulties caused by an employee's embezzlement, and partly including the need to sort out his father's affairs, and was exempted from his remaining sixteen months of service. During the 1980s his habit of wearing a Guards regimental tie, sometimes incorrectly knotted with a red stripe on the neck, was the subject of much acerbic comment from military figures and from older MPs with distinguished war records. Crick estimated <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> worn the tie on more days than he actually served in the Guards.|$|E
25|$|Anaximander was {{the first}} {{astronomer}} to consider the Sun as a huge mass, and consequently, to realize how far from Earth it might be, {{and the first to}} present a system where the celestial bodies turned at different distances. Furthermore, according to Diogenes Laertius (II, 2), he built a celestial sphere. This invention undoubtedly made him the first to realize the obliquity of the Zodiac as the Roman philosopher Pliny the Elder reports in Natural History (II, 8). It is a little early to use the term ecliptic, but his knowledge and work on astronomy confirm <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> observed the inclination of the celestial sphere in relation to the plane of the Earth to explain the seasons. The doxographer and theologian Aetius attributes to Pythagoras the exact measurement of the obliquity.|$|E
25|$|Field's {{claim to}} {{distinction}} does not rest {{entirely on the}} fact that he wrote the first volume of verse to appear in Australia, he also founded the first savings bank in June 1819. He is spoken of with respect in Miss Marion Phillips's A Colonial Autocracy. He was the B.F. {{of one of the most}} famous of Lamb's essays and the recipient of more than one of his delightful letters, which suggests <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> had likeable qualities. His verse has little value, but he could do better work in prose and had some claims to be an Elizabethan scholar, his special interest being Thomas Heywood. His Geographical Memoirs on New South Wales, published in 1825, is an interesting collection of some of the earliest scientific papers relating to Australia.|$|E
