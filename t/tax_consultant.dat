The advanced training of <b>tax</b> <b>consultants</b> should be a continuous process as they need to take into account both external and internal taxpayers risks associated with the development of law and law-enforcement practice. Obviously, the training of <b>tax</b> <b>consultants</b> should take into account the experience of developed foreign countries, such as Germany, Austria, Czech Republic, Slovakia and other European countries as well.

30|$|In Germany, {{becoming}} a certified auditor (comparable to a CPA) requires passing an exam on four topics: auditing, business administration, commercial law, and taxation. The state examination for auditors enables auditors, once qualified, to advise non-listed corporate clients on various issues including taxation. However, {{it is common}} practice for auditors to also take a state examination specifically for taxation {{so they can be}} fully certified chartered <b>tax</b> <b>consultants.</b> This particular exam goes beyond tax issues dealt with in the state examination for auditors and is very challenging. The failure rate regularly lies at around 50 %. This exam {{can be seen as a}} further education of auditors that broadens individual auditors’ knowledge and allows to differentiate among auditors. Consequently, since this tax certification expands the knowledge acquired with the audit examination, audit exam candidates who have already passed the state examination for chartered <b>tax</b> <b>consultants</b> are permitted to bypass the exam on taxation. However, candidates for the state examination for chartered <b>tax</b> <b>consultants</b> who are already certified auditors may only bypass the accounting portion of the state examination for <b>tax</b> <b>consultants.</b>|$|R

40|$|Contingency fee {{agreements}} between local tax assessors and contract auditors {{on the one}} hand, and property owners and private <b>tax</b> <b>consultants</b> on the other, create perverse financial incentives that undermine the integrity {{of state and local}} tax administration. When local governments engage outside auditors to identify undervalued or escaped taxable property, the practice raises serious due process and ethical concerns. As a matter of policy, diverting a share of property tax revenue to private third parties in consideration for outsourced tax assessment services undermines public accountability and reduces net property tax revenue for local government services. And when states allow private <b>tax</b> <b>consultants</b> to use contingency fee agreements to solicit clients seeking to reduce their share of local property taxes, they unwittingly divert substantial tax revenue to private entrepreneurs. The associated private transaction cost of seeking uniformity in local tax assessment unduly burdens the entire property tax system. Because contingency fee agreements with nonattorneys are generally unregulated by state law, honest taxpayers effectively subsidize not only property tax dodgers, but also contract auditors and private <b>tax</b> <b>consultants...</b>|$|R
