25|$|On September 11, 1987, Rather marched off-camera {{in anger}} {{just before a}} remote {{broadcast}} of the program when it appeared that CBS Sports' coverage of a U.S. Open tennis semifinal match between Steffi Graf and Lori McNeil was going to overrun into time allotted for his program.

2500|$|Springer began {{traveling}} consistently {{with the}} A4 pod (her mother's closest relatives), and distant cousins in the A5 pod. It was hoped that Springer would form {{a bond with}} a mature female who would act as a surrogate mother. The killer whale known as A51 or [...] "Nodales," [...] a 16-year-old female from the A5 pod who had no calf of her own, appeared to take that role. In August, A51 was observed following Springer and guiding her away from boats, which Dr. Barrett-Leonard described {{as a sign of}} [...] "reciprocalness in the relationship. It convinced me {{this is not just a}} case of A73 finding a placid female she's following around." [...] The bond between Springer and Nodales turned out to not be as strong as a normal mother-offspring bond in killer whales, however. Springer has since often been seen with Nawitti, a 12-year-old female from the A4 pod, and with Springer's great-aunt Yakat. Dr. John Nightingale, Director of the Vancouver Aquarium, stated on ABC World News <b>Tonight</b> <b>With</b> <b>Peter</b> <b>Jennings,</b> [...] "I've been a fascinated spectator, watching these whales get used to each other and her integration into her larger family group." ...|$|E
