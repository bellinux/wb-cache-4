5000|$|Tip protectors are {{metal or}} plastic devices that fit {{over the bar}} tip and are usually fitted to small, domestic-class saws. While these are effective, they hamper the saw {{in terms of the}} type and {{capacity}} of cuts it can execute, and are not widely used. They find a useful application in pole pruners and one-handed battery-powered saws that are used for trimming, hedge laying etc. The hooked nose of the <b>tip</b> <b>protector</b> can be used to [...] "grab" [...] branches for cutting, and presents no great drawback since these very small saw units are not used for cuts where the bar tip is buried.|$|E
40|$|The {{existence}} of substances which inhibit the enzymatic destruction of auxin in shoots of the Japanese morning glory (Pharbitis nil Choisy) has been confirmed, {{as has the}} fact that these substances are distributed in a gradient diminishing from apex to base in a manner indicating a regulatory role in internode elongation and tissue maturation. In addition to the 2 auxin protector substances reported previously (protectors I and II) which appear to account for most of the inhibition of the enzymatic destruction of auxin in young, elongating stem tissue, a third substance, designated as protector A, {{has been found to be}} highly active in seeds, and shoot tips of mature plants: In germinating seeds, no protector I or II activity was observed; in stem <b>tips,</b> no <b>protector</b> II and only slight protector I activity was observed. In contrast, old tissue contained no detectable amounts of protector A, but did contain protectors I and II. Between these extremes along the shoot axis, mixtures of the 3 substances were found. The evidence can be interpreted to mean that protector A is degraded into protectors I and II and perhaps translocated in this form. Gel filtration studies indicate that protector A has a molecular weight exceeding 200, 000 gm/mole...|$|R
