5|$|St. John Bastion, {{also known}} as Abercrombie's Bastion – a large {{asymmetrical}} bastion at St. Elmo Point, <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> the Sciberras Peninsula. The bastion contains several British gun emplacements and magazines.|$|E
5|$|The {{basic unit}} of {{measurement}} used during construction was the tala, defined as {{the length of a}} human face from the forehead's hairline to <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> the chin or the distance from <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> the thumb to <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> the middle finger when both fingers are stretched at their maximum distance. The unit is thus relative from one individual to the next, but the monument has exact measurements. A survey conducted in 1977 revealed frequent findings of a ratio of 4:6:9 around the monument. The architect had used the formula to lay out the precise dimensions of the fractal and self-similar geometry in Borobudur's design. This ratio is also found in the designs of Pawon and Mendut, nearby Buddhist temples. Archeologists have conjectured that the 4:6:9 ratio and the tala have calendrical, astronomical and cosmological significance, {{as is the case with}} the temple of Angkor Wat in Cambodia.|$|E

5|$|Apart from pit-trap-forming taxa, {{the biology}} {{of members of the}} family Myrmeleontidae, to which the antlions belong, has been little studied. The {{life-cycle}} begins with oviposition (egg-laying) in a suitable location. The female antlion repeatedly taps the prospective laying site with <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> her abdomen and then inserts her ovipositor into the substrate and lays an egg.|$|E

5|$|As {{with other}} early sauropodomorphs, {{it has been}} {{proposed}} that Massospondylus had cheeks. This theory was proposed {{because there are a}} few large holes for blood vessels on the surfaces of the jaw bones, unlike the numerous small holes present on the jaws of cheekless reptiles. The cheeks would have prevented food from spilling out when Massospondylus ate. Crompton and Attridge (1986) described skulls of Massospondylus as possessing pronounced overbites and suggested the presence of a horny beak on <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> the lower jaw {{to make up the difference}} in length and account for tooth wear on the teeth at <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> the snout. However, the difference in length may be a misinterpretation based on crushing in a top–bottom plane, and the possession of a beak is considered unlikely in recent studies.|$|E
5|$|Ceratopsians {{are easily}} {{recognized}} by {{features of the}} skull. On <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> a ceratopsian upper jaw is the rostral bone, an edentulous (toothless) ossification, unique to ceratopsians. Othniel Charles Marsh recognized and named this bone, which acts as {{a mirror image of}} the predentary bone on the lower jaw. This ossification evolved to morphologically aid the mastication of plant matter. Along with the predentary bone, which forms <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> the lower jaw in all ornithischians, the rostral forms a superficially parrot-like beak. Also, the jugal bones below the eye are very tall and flare out sideways, making the skull appear somewhat triangular when viewed from above. This triangular appearance is accentuated in later ceratopsians by the rearwards extension of the parietal and squamosal bones of the skull roof, to form the neck frill.|$|E

5|$|Later in {{the morning}} North Korean barges crossed the Naktong below A Company. The company sent a squad with a light machine gun to the {{southern}} tip of the ridge overlooking Agok to take these troops under fire. When the squad reached <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> the ridge they saw that a North Korean force occupied houses at its base. The company hit these houses with artillery. The North Koreans broke from the houses, running for the river. At this the light machine gun at <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> the ridge took them under fire, as did another across the Naktong to the south in the US 25th Infantry Division sector. Proximity fuze artillery fire decimated this group. Combined fire from all weapons inflicted an estimated 300 casualties on this North Korean force. In the afternoon, US aircraft dropped food and ammunition to the company; only part of it was recovered. The 1st Battalion ordered A Company to withdraw the company that night.|$|E
5|$|Most antbirds have proportionately large, heavy bills.
