5|$|The Guardian of Education was {{the first}} {{periodical}} to review children's books seriously and with a distinctive set of criteria. Trimmer's reviews were carefully thought out; they influenced publishers and authors to alter <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> books, helped to define the new genre of children's literature, and greatly affected the sales of children's books. The Guardian also offered the first history of children's literature; establishing a list of landmark books, which scholars still use today.|$|E
5|$|The Guayaquil conference {{took place}} on 26 July 1822. They had two private meetings, on that day and the {{following}} one. As there were no witnesses or minutes, <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> discussions can only be inferred from their later actions and their letters to other people. Some likely topics of discussion {{may have been a}} request of reinforcements, and an offer to combine the armies into a single one, with San Martín ranked second to Bolívar.|$|E
5|$|When {{the game}} is ready for release, the {{publisher}} sends copies of {{the final version of}} the game to the ESRB, who reviews the game's packaging, and a random number of games they receive are play tested for more thorough review. Penalties apply to publishers who misrepresent <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> games, including the potential for fines up to US $1 million and a product recall, if deemed necessary. The ESRB typically posts rating information for new titles on its website 30 days after the rating process is complete; in 2008, in response to incidents where this practice inadvertently leaked information about games that had not yet been announced, the ESRB began to allow publishers to place embargoes on the release of ratings information until a game is officially announced.|$|E

25|$|As the {{business}} of UK companies becomes increasingly globalised, {{and a growing number}} of overseas businesses operate in the UK, multiple proceedings in different countries with different laws can be engaged by one insolvency. In order to regulate this in the European Union, the Insolvency Regulation (EC) 1346/2000 was passed. It is essentially a conflicts of laws measure, and generally leaves member states free to determine <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> own insolvency proceedings and priorities. However, it ensures that one jurisdiction will be determined to be the primary jurisdiction, and all others are secondary.|$|E
25|$|Under the Palo Alto Daily News model, {{papers are}} {{delivered}} to public {{places such as}} coffee shops, restaurants, stores, gyms, schools, corporate campuses, and news racks. Price and Pavelich have avoided putting <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> newspapers online because that would reduce readership of their printed newspapers, and therefore reduce {{the effectiveness of their}} print advertising. While ads can be placed on Web pages, they are not as effective for clients as print advertising. They have said that if they ever find an example of a newspaper that is making a profit on its website, they would copy that approach.|$|E
25|$|In 1988 {{when the}} Ministry of Education started its {{independent}} school program, the school again reorganized. New regulations allowed schools access to private funding and subjected them to less government regulation in <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> curricula. Renamed ACS (Independent), in 1993 the school vacated the Barker Road campus {{and moved to}} Dover Road. After strong lobbying by alumni, the Barker Road site became {{the site of a}} second secondary school. At the same time, the Anglo-Chinese Primary School abandoned its Coleman Street premises (the old building now housing the National Archives of Singapore) to share premises with the new secondary school at Barker Road, now named ACS (Barker Road).|$|E

25|$|Despite the {{economic}} calamity facing {{the nation and}} his dim hopes for re-election, Hoover faced little opposition for re-nomination at the 1932 Republican National Convention. Some Republicans talked of nominating Coolidge, former Vice President Charles Dawes, or Senator Hiram Johnson, but all passed on the opportunity to challenge Hoover. Curtis was re-nominated as Hoover's running mate. Franklin D. Roosevelt won the presidential nomination on the third ballot of the 1932 Democratic National Convention, defeating the 1928 Democratic nominee, Al Smith. Speaker of the House John Nance Garner was nominated as Roosevelt's running mate. By 1932, the radio was in 12 million homes, changing the nature of presidential campaigns. No longer could presidents change <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> speeches for each audience; anyone with a radio could listen to every major speech.|$|E
25|$|Novelists {{come from}} a variety of {{backgrounds}} and social classes, and frequently this shapes <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> works. Public reception of a novelist's work, the literary criticism commenting on it, and the novelists' incorporation of their own experiences into works and characters can lead to the author's personal life and identity being associated with a novel's fictional content. For this reason, the environment within which a novelist works and the reception of their novels by both the public and publishers can be influenced by their demographics or identity; important among these culturally constructed identities are gender, sexual identity, social class, race or ethnicity, nationality, religion, and an association with place. Similarly, some novelists have creative identities derived from their focus on different genres of fiction, such as crime, romance or historical novels.|$|E
25|$|Biafra (1970–1978) was a {{group of}} Croatian artists that rebelled against the artistic, social and {{cultural}} conventions of the day, and engaged with real problems through their art. Individual members ranged in style from pop-art and minimalism to new figuration. The sculptors of the group used new materials in their work, such as polyester, plastic, jute, aluminum, and glass wool, while the painters engaged with imaginative, expressive, rich colors. <b>The</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> art was expressionist, clear and direct. Exhibitions and activities were organized on the streets, presenting their ideas directly to the public. The group originally consisted of the young sculptors Branko Bunić, Stjepan Gračan, Ratko Petrić and Miro Vuco. Membership expanded over the years to include Ivan Lesiak, Zlatko Kauzlarić Atač, Rudolf Labaš, Vlado Jakelić, Stanko Jančić, Ratko Janjić-Jobo, Đurđica Zanoški-Gudlin, Emil Robert Tanay.|$|E

25|$|The Interviews {{stage of}} the process takes place as the {{penultimate}} step of the competition, in which the five remaining candidates in the competition each undergoes an individual set of interviews with a selection of trusted aides of Lord Sugar; for the seventh and eighth series, this stage was assigned as the final step, and featured the four remaining candidate in each respective series' competition. In this stage, each interviewer questions the candidates over various matters, from their performance in the process, why they applied for the show, <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> CVs, and their personal attitude with others, and often probe and scrutinise any brash, boastful, or controversial statements that they have made, including on their application forms and CVs, which can usually see them encouraged to prove such outlandish claims are truthful or were made up. The aim being to determine the suitability of the candidate for the prize being offered by Lord Sugar. Since the seventh series, following the change of prize, the interviewers now scrutinise a candidate on their business plan, determining how feasible it is, if the candidate can achieve the plan, as well as rooting out any potential flaws and issues that come with it.|$|E
500|$|The Wiggles' stage {{shows were}} full of action and {{audience}} participation. [...] By the group's [...] "New Wiggles" [...] iteration, The Sydney Morning Herald called their shows slick and fast-paced, with inside jokes for the adult members of their audience. [...] The bandmembers tended to wander throughout the audience, [...] "thrilling toddlers and smartphone wielding guardians alike". [...] Pryce, as an experienced stage performer, was conscious that their shows were the first live theater young children experienced; as a result, the group adapted <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> shows to accommodate their audience's development and understanding. [...] Paddick's role as Captain Feathersword became {{more important in the}} mid-1990s, especially in the group's stage shows, when he was able to incorporate his circus and opera training, as well as impersonations that were popular with their audience's parents.|$|E
500|$|Additionally, Justice Thomas {{rejected}} the town's assertion that a law is only content-based if it [...] "censor or favor" [...] specific viewpoints or ideas. The town argued that its sign code was not unconstitutional because it neither endorsed nor suppressed any particular viewpoints or ideas. However, Justice Thomas clarified that a statute is content-based if it singles out a specific subject, {{even though it}} may not target ideas or viewpoints within that subject matter. Furthermore, he also {{rejected the}} Ninth Circuit's conclusion that the ordinance was content-neutral because it targeted specific classes of speakers, rather than <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> speech. Although he recognized that speaker-based restrictions were only [...] "the beginning — not the end — of the inquiry", Justice Thomas held that [...] "laws favoring some speakers over others demand strict scrutiny when the legislature’s speaker preference reflects a content preference".|$|E

500|$|The group's [...] "golden rule", {{according}} to Field, {{was to make}} <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> songs and shows [...] "developmentally appropriate and fun". [...] Their music, stage shows, and television and DVD productions were developed, as The New York Times reported, [...] "from the premise that a young child has a short attention span, is curious about {{a limited number of}} objects and activities, loves having a job to do and is thrilled by mastering basic movements". [...] They also respected their audience's intelligence and insight about entertainment, information, and honesty. [...] As Field said, [...] "Young children identify with relevant concepts, and enjoy being entertained and being part of the entertainment. They are willing to commit to interacting if you are direct, inclusive, and positive". [...] The group understood that challenging young children to engage in difficult tasks is more effective than simply telling them to do it. [...] They believed that young children were egocentric, so they stared continually into the camera in their videos and TV shows, and explained every action because they believed that young children needed to be told what to expect so that they do not feel left out and in order to feel safe.|$|E
500|$|In {{the wake}} of these two incidents, the ESRB changed its {{policies}} in June 2006 to account for hidden content; publishers must disclose information surrounding all unlockable or otherwise [...] "hidden" [...] content in the game {{as part of the}} ratings process, and publishers can be fined up to US$1 million if they are found to have misrepresented <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> game after further reviews. In response to the aftermath of Hot Coffee and the resulting policy changes, ESRB President Patricia Vance stated that in her opinion, [...] "there is no other industry self-regulatory system willing or capable of imposing such swift and sweeping sanctions on its own members, which in this particular case resulted in the removal of a top-selling product from the market and a major loss of sales." [...] However, several U.S. politicians, including Senator Sam Brownback, California Senator Leland Yee, and Michigan Senator Fred Upton (who was a major critic against Rockstar during the controversy), still felt that the ESRB had [...] "lost" [...] its trust of consumers, believing that video game developers were taking advantage of the board's conflict of interest with the industry to incorporate objectionable content into their products without the ESRB's full knowledge.|$|E
500|$|The Wii {{version of}} the game, {{developed}} by Vicarious Visions, is [...] "full feature parity" [...] with the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions, including support for up to eight players online, each possibly on their own console. Guitar Hero 5 is the first Wii game to support high capacity SD cards, allowing up to about 800 songs to be stored on a 32 GB card. While existing Wii Guitar Hero games allow players to purchase downloadable content one song at a time, Guitar Hero 5 includes the ability to download complete albums and song packs. Players are also able to manage <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> Wii memory cards through the game's interface. The game does not require players to enter game-specific Friends Codes, but instead uses the global Wii address book to locate friends. The [...] "Mii Freestyle" [...] mode, introduced in World Tour, is also present, and with changes {{to address some of}} the issues with less-skilled players trying to play well together. A [...] "Guitar Hero Nintendo Ecosystem" [...] is introduced in Guitar Hero 5, letting the Wii version communicate with the Nintendo DS, including a stage manager/video editor DS controller feature in conjunction with the Mii Freestyle mode, and a new game mode called [...] "Roadie Battle". In Roadie Battle, four players play as two teams; each team has one player performing on an instrument through the Wii, while the other player uses a DS to connect to the Wii and act as the roadie. During play, the roadie players attempt to sabotage the other team by completing mini-games on the DS that affect the other team's music performance {{in a manner similar to}} Guitar Hero IIIs Battle Mode. These can only be cleared by the other DS player performing another mini-game.|$|E

2500|$|It is [...] {{important}} for instructors {{to realize that}} although a curriculum may be set down for them, it inevitably becomes shaped by them into something personal that reflects their own belief systems, their thoughts and feelings about both <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> instruction and their learners (Rhodes and Bellamy 1999). Thus, the learning experience becomes a shared enterprise. The emotions and life contexts {{of those involved in}} the learning process must therefore be considered {{as an integral part of}} learning. The goal of the learner is central in considering what is learned (Brown et al. 1989; Ackerman 1996).|$|E
