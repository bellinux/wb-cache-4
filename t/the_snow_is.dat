5|$|January 24, 2003: A {{plume of}} Arctic air {{produces}} widespread record low temperatures and light snow flurries {{along the eastern}} coastline. <b>The</b> <b>snow</b> <b>is</b> described as ocean-effect snow, identical to lake effect snow in that it occurs due to very cold air passing over relatively warm water temperatures. The snow reaches {{as far south as}} Fort Pierce.|$|E
5|$|Snowfall {{is often}} heavier in the Sussex Weald than {{in many other}} low-lying parts of central and {{southern}} England due to the proximity of moisture-laden southerly tracking low pressure systems bringing easterly winds and snow to areas from South London southwards. However, again due to the southerly location of the area, with warmer air from the nearby English Channel, <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> <b>is</b> often temporary as low pressure systems track north bringing in milder air; areas immediately north of London tend to have less accumulation, but lying for a longer duration.|$|E
5|$|Although Australia is {{generally}} considered to be more suited to summer sport, several ice-based sports take place as well. Snow falls on the Australian Alps and parts of Tasmania. The Australian Alps are within six hours' drive for residents of Sydney, but within two hours' drive for residents of Melbourne and Canberra, Tasmanian ski slopes are within a day's drive for residents of the major cities of Hobart and Launceston. However, the season is quite short, as <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> <b>is</b> skiable for only about four months per year. Skiing in Australia was first introduced by Norwegian miners in the goldrush town of Kiandra, New South Wales, around 1859, near today's Selwyn Snowfields ski resort. The sport remains a popular winter activity in the south-eastern states and territories. Major alpine skiing resorts include Thredbo, Perisher and Charlotte Pass in New South Wales; Mount Hotham, Falls Creek and Mount Buller in Victoria and Mount Ben Lomond in Tasmania. Victoria has three dedicated cross-country ski resorts and extensive areas are available for cross-country skiing within national parks including Kosciuszko National Park (NSW), Alpine National Park (VIC); Namadgi National Park (ACT) and in the Tasmanian Wilderness.|$|E

Though mostly orange, some of <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> <b>was</b> red or yellow. It affected an area with about 27,000 residents. It was originally speculated that it was caused by industrial pollution, a rocket launch or even a nuclear accident. It was later determined that <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> <b>was</b> non-toxic; however, {{people in the region}} were advised not to use <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> or allow animals to feed upon it.

Based on a vision that night, a {{basilica}} was built in honour of Our Lady, on the spot that had been covered with snow.|$|E
25|$|Wildlife is {{abundant}} {{on the slopes}} of Blue Knob. Species such as white-tailed deer, ruffed grouse, turkey, coyote, porcupine and fox are difficult to see, but finding their tracks in <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> <b>is</b> not uncommon. Black bears are also resident on the mountain {{and are more likely to}} be seen during the early morning and evening hours. Red-tailed hawks, warblers, vireos and songbirds are found here throughout the seasons.|$|E

25|$|Daytime {{exposure}} to sunlight will rapidly destabilize the upper {{layers of the}} snowpack if the sunlight {{is strong enough to}} melt the snow, thereby reducing its hardness. During clear nights, the snowpack can re-freeze when ambient air temperatures fall below freezing, through the process of long-wave radiative cooling, or both. Radiative heat loss occurs when the night air is significantly cooler than the snowpack, and the heat stored in <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> <b>is</b> re-radiated into the atmosphere.|$|E

500|$|Snow melters are in {{some ways}} more {{environmentally}} friendly than gritters, as they do not spray hazardous materials, and pollutants from the road surface can {{be separated from the}} meltwater and disposed of safely. In addition, because <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> <b>is</b> melted on board, the costs of transporting snow from the site are eliminated. [...] On the other hand, snow melting can require large amounts of energy, which has its own costs and environmental impact.|$|E

500|$|The International Classification for Seasonal Snow on the Ground defines [...] "height of new snow" [...] as {{the depth}} of freshly fallen snow, in centimeters as {{measured}} with a ruler, that accumulated on a snowboard during an observation period of 24 hours, or other observation interval. After the measurement, <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> <b>is</b> cleared from the board and the board is placed flush with the snow surface to provide an accurate measurement {{at the end of}} the next interval. Melting, compacting, blowing and drifting contribute to the difficulty of measuring snowfall.|$|E
500|$|The Red River {{forms the}} border between North Dakota and Minnesota. A few sets of [...] "sister cities" [...] sit {{directly}} on this border, including Grand Forks, North Dakota and its counterpart East Grand Forks, Minnesota, Fargo, North Dakota/Moorhead, Minnesota (Fargo-Moorhead), and Wahpeton, North Dakota/Breckenridge, Minnesota. The Red River in Manitoba and the U.S. states of Minnesota and North Dakota has flooded repeatedly through the centuries, endangering lives and property. The river is highly prone to flooding because of its northward flow. As spring approaches, <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> <b>is</b> melted from south to north alongside the riverflow. There is also {{the possibility that the}} surplus water can hit unmelted ice on the river and back up. The flatness of the terrain and small slope of the river is a significant factor.|$|E
500|$|In {{terms of}} their characteristics, Panhandle hooks are nearly the {{opposite}} of Alberta clippers. [...] Instead of forming {{in the north and}} dropping south, these low pressure systems form in the southwestern United States and then move northeast. [...] They get their name from the location where they usually make their turn to the north; near the panhandles of Oklahoma and Texas. [...] Unlike clippers, these storms usually {{have a great deal of}} moisture to work with. [...] As the storms make their turn to the north, they pull in moist air from the nearby Gulf of Mexico and pull it northward toward Minnesota and other parts of the Midwest. As these systems move to the northeast, there will usually be a heavy band of snow to the northwest of the low pressure center if there is enough cold air present. [...] A wintery mix of precipitation, rain, or sometimes even thunderstorms will then often occur to the south of it. Snowfall over a foot (30cm) is not uncommon with a panhandle hook, and because of the high moisture content in these systems <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> <b>is</b> usually wet and heavy. Large panhandle hooks can become powerful enough to draw in arctic air after they pass by the state, leaving bitter cold temperatures and wind chills in their wake. [...] Panhandle Hooks are responsible for some of the most famous blizzards that have occurred in the Midwest, including the Great Storm of 1975.|$|E

500|$|In {{order to}} make a {{faithful}} rendition of the circus, director Kramer asked the animators to watch a showing of Cirque du Soleil in Santa Monica, but they declined the offer. Regardless, executive producer and former showrunner Mike Scully found that the animators did an [...] "amazing" [...] job animating the setpiece. Because the episode takes place in winter, the animators faced some challenges that they would not have with any other episode. [...] "It just adds another element", Kramer said about episodes taking place in winter, [...] "People's clothes have to get tugged in the wind if it's windy. And {{you have to make sure}} <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> <b>is</b> consistent because [...] It's like a character. If it's a big snowflake in one scene and then tiny ones where it's snowing too hard in the next scene... It's not gonna work." [...] The scratches and bad quality of [...] "The Christmas That Almost Wasn't, But Then Was" [...] were added in by the Post-Production Department, led by Alex Duke. [...] "Our Post-Production Department never gets enough credit," [...] Scully said, [...] "But they'll take a film like [...] and make it all scratchy and make it look really old. They always do a great job." [...] The woman in [...] "The Christmas That Almost Wasn't, But Then Was" [...] was portrayed by Tress MacNeille, while the clown in the Cirque du Purée was voiced by Hank Azaria.
