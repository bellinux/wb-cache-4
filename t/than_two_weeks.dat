On the ice, McDonald scored 35goals with the Rockies and finished with a total of 40 between the two teams.|$|E
25|$|In 1983, the European Union {{banned the}} import of whitecoat harp seal pup pelts (pelts from pups less <b>than</b> about <b>two</b> <b>weeks</b> of age, when the pups molt).

5|$|Christopher Reeve {{was cast}} as Superman, having {{initially}} failed {{to impress the}} Salkinds before bulking up.

5|$|Diagnosing active {{tuberculosis}} {{based only on}} signs and symptoms is difficult, as is diagnosing the disease in those who are immunosuppressed. A diagnosis of TB should, however, be considered in those with signs of lung disease or constitutional symptoms lasting longer <b>than</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks.</b> A chest X-ray and multiple sputum cultures for acid-fast bacilli are typically part of the initial evaluation. Interferon-γ release assays and tuberculin skin tests are of little use in the developing world. Interferon gamma release assays (IGRA) have similar limitations in those with HIV.|$|E

From the start of the conflict, Kilkis was used as a floating battery based in Salamis. Spare guns from Kilkis and Lemnos were employed as coastal batteries throughout Greece.|$|E

40|$|The second {{flight of}} the Zeno {{experiment}} in the USMP- 3 flight has shown successful control of density perturbations near the window surfaces. These density changes were demonstrated to be arising from the rate of temperature change in the sample cell during the flight. These effects could be controlled by using decreasing ramp rates as Tc was approached. The cell window interference was carefully recorded to provide data about the phase of the interference close to the critical point and the effective window reflectivity. Correlograms were recorded from 500 mili K down to 2 mili K at 24 temperatures, 383 correlograms in all. The efforts to get closer were prevented by a long (greater <b>than</b> <b>two</b> <b>week</b> time constant) decay of a 1. 3 % density error caused by local heating from the 17 micro W laser beam. The phase boundary was located with unprecedented precision of +/- 2 O micro K. The complete experiment sequence was done with ground commanding and uploaded script files, bypassing the original autonomous-mode program sequence...|$|R
