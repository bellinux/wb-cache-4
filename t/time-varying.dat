5|$|Faraday's and Ampère's work {{showed that}} a <b>time-varying</b> {{magnetic}} field acted {{as a source of}} an electric field, and a <b>time-varying</b> electric field was a source of a magnetic field. Thus, when either field is changing in time, then a field of the other is necessarily induced. Such a phenomenon has the properties of a wave, and is naturally referred to as an electromagnetic wave. Electromagnetic waves were analysed theoretically by James Clerk Maxwell in 1864. Maxwell developed a set of equations that could unambiguously describe the interrelationship between electric field, magnetic field, electric charge, and electric current. He could moreover prove that such a wave would necessarily travel at the speed of light, and thus light itself was a form of electromagnetic radiation. Maxwell's Laws, which unify light, fields, and charge are one of the great milestones of theoretical physics.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of harmonic, {{quasi-periodic}} musical tones, wavetable synthesis can be as general as <b>time-varying</b> additive synthesis, but requires less computation during synthesis. As a result, an efficient implementation of <b>time-varying</b> additive synthesis of harmonic tones {{can be accomplished by}} use of wavetable synthesis.|$|E

25|$|The minimum-variance {{smoother}} can {{attain the}} best-possible error performance, {{provided that the}} models are linear, their parameters and the noise statistics are known precisely. This smoother is a <b>time-varying</b> state-space generalization of the optimal non-causal Wiener filter.|$|E
25|$|Geodesy, {{also called}} geodetics, is the {{scientific}} discipline {{that deals with}} the measurement and representation of the Earth, its gravitational field and geodynamic phenomena (polar motion, Earth tides, and crustal motion) in three-dimensional <b>time-varying</b> space.|$|E
25|$|In general, neither {{impedance}} nor admittance can be {{time varying}} {{as they are}} defined for complex exponentials for –∞ < t < +∞. If the complex exponential voltage–current ratio changes over time or amplitude, the circuit element cannot be described using the frequency domain. However, many systems (e.g., varicaps {{that are used in}} radio tuners) may exhibit non-linear or <b>time-varying</b> voltage–current ratios that appear to be linear time-invariant (LTI) for small signals over small observation windows; hence, they can be roughly described as having a <b>time-varying</b> impedance. That is, this description is an approximation; over large signal swings or observation windows, the voltage–current relationship is non-LTI and cannot be described by impedance.|$|E
25|$|Localized <b>time-varying</b> {{charge and}} current densities {{can act as}} sources of {{electromagnetic}} waves in a vacuum. Maxwell's equations can be written {{in the form of}} a wave equation with sources. The addition of sources to the wave equations makes the partial differential equations inhomogeneous.|$|E
25|$|A {{generalized}} electric {{scalar potential}} {{is also used}} in electrodynamics when <b>time-varying</b> electromagnetic fields are present, but {{this can not be}} so simply calculated. The electric potential and the magnetic vector potential together form a four vector, so that the two kinds of potential are mixed under Lorentz transformations.|$|E
25|$|The {{piezoelectric}} effect converts mechanical strain into electric current or voltage. This strain {{can come from}} many different sources. Human motion, low-frequency seismic vibrations, and acoustic noise are everyday examples. Except in rare instances the {{piezoelectric effect}} operates in AC requiring <b>time-varying</b> inputs at mechanical resonance to be efficient.|$|E
25|$|All the Kepler circumbinary {{planets are}} either close to or {{actually}} in the habitable zone. None of them are terrestrial planets, but large moons of such planets could be habitable. Because of the stellar binarity, the insolation received by the planet will likely be <b>time-varying</b> in a way quite unlike the regular sunlight Earth receives.|$|E
25|$|In 1932 an {{analytic}} {{solution to}} the problem of calculating adiabatic transition probabilities was published separately by Lev Landau and Clarence Zener, for the special case of a linearly changing perturbation in which the <b>time-varying</b> component does not couple the relevant states (hence the coupling in the diabatic Hamiltonian matrix is independent of time).|$|E
25|$|When {{reactive}} {{elements such}} as capacitors, inductors, or transmission lines {{are involved in a}} circuit to which AC or <b>time-varying</b> voltage or current is applied, the relationship between voltage and current becomes the solution to a differential equation, so Ohm's law (as defined above) does not directly apply since that form contains only resistances having value R, not complex impedances which may contain capacitance ("C") or inductance ("L").|$|E
25|$|The {{activation}} pattern {{within the}} motor map determines the movement pattern of all model articulators (lips, tongue, velum, glottis) for a speech item. In {{order not to}} overload the model, no detailed modeling of the neuromuscular system is done. The Maeda articulatory speech synthesizer is used in order to generate articulator movements, which allows the generation of a <b>time-varying</b> vocal tract form and the generation of the acoustic speech signal for each particular speech item.|$|E
25|$|The {{pyroelectric effect}} {{converts}} a temperature change into electric current or voltage. It {{is analogous to}} the piezoelectric effect, which is another type of ferroelectric behavior. Pyroelectricity requires <b>time-varying</b> inputs and suffers from small power outputs in energy harvesting applications due to its low operating frequencies. However, one key advantage of pyroelectrics over thermoelectrics is that many pyroelectric materials are stable up to 1200 ⁰C or higher, enabling energy harvesting from high temperature sources and thus increasing thermodynamic efficiency.|$|E
25|$|These {{effects are}} derived from two {{fundamental}} observations of physics: a steady current creates a steady magnetic field described by Oersted's law, and a <b>time-varying</b> magnetic field induces an electromotive force (EMF) in nearby conductors, which is described by Faraday's law of induction. According to Lenz's law, a changing electric current through a circuit that contains inductance induces a proportional voltage, which opposes the change in current (self-inductance). The varying field in this circuit may also induce an EMF in neighbouring circuits (mutual inductance).|$|E
25|$|A deep {{predictive}} coding network (DPCN) is a {{predictive coding}} scheme that uses top-down information to empirically adjust the priors {{needed for a}} bottom-up inference procedure {{by means of a}} deep, locally connected, generative model. This works by extracting sparse features from <b>time-varying</b> observations using a linear dynamical model. Then, a pooling strategy is used to learn invariant feature representations. These units compose to form a deep architecture and are trained by greedy layer-wise unsupervised learning. The layers constitute a kind of Markov chain such that the states at any layer depend only on the preceding and succeeding layers.|$|E

2500|$|When <b>time-varying</b> {{magnetic}} fields are present (which is true whenever there are <b>time-varying</b> electric fields and vice versa), {{it is not}} possible to describe the electric field simply in terms of a scalar potential V because the electric field is no longer conservative: [...] is path-dependent because [...] (Faraday's law of induction).|$|E

2500|$|One {{can take}} the observables to be {{dependent}} on time, while the state σ was fixed once {{at the beginning of the}} experiment. This approach is called the Heisenberg picture. (This approach was taken in the later part of the discussion above, with <b>time-varying</b> observables P(t), Q(t).) One can, equivalently, treat the observables as fixed, while the state of the system depends on time; that is known as the Schrödinger picture. (This approach was taken in the earlier part of the discussion above, with a <b>time-varying</b> state [...]) Conceptually (and mathematically), the two approaches are equivalent; choosing one of them is a matter of convention.|$|E
2500|$|If {{a system}} is static, such that {{magnetic}} fields are not <b>time-varying,</b> then by Faraday's law, the electric field is curl-free. In this case, one can define an electric potential, that is, a function [...] such that [...]|$|E
2500|$|If the {{capacitor}} is a varicap diode, {{then the}} 'moving the plates' {{can be done}} simply by applying <b>time-varying</b> DC voltage to the varicap diode. This driving voltage usually comes from another oscillator — sometimes called a [...] "pump".|$|E

2500|$|Electric and {{magnetic}} fields {{are created by}} charged particles in matter such as electrons. [...] A stationary charge creates an electrostatic field in the space around it. [...] A steady current of charges (direct current, DC) creates a static magnetic field around it. [...] The above fields contain energy, but cannot carry power because they are static. [...] However <b>time-varying</b> fields can carry power. [...] Accelerating electric charges, such as are found in an alternating current (AC) of electrons in a wire, create <b>time-varying</b> electric {{and magnetic}} fields in the space around them. [...] These fields can exert oscillating forces on the electrons in a receiving [...] "antenna", causing them to move back and forth. [...] These represent alternating current {{which can be used}} to power a load.|$|E
2500|$|As {{with other}} classes of smooth numbers, regular numbers are {{important}} as problem sizes in computer programs for performing the fast Fourier transform, a technique for analyzing the dominant frequencies of signals in <b>time-varying</b> data.
