30|$|The German REACH-CLP {{helpdesk}} {{plays an}} important role when companies get involved with the new regulations. This becomes apparent from the strong demand for information which was noted during the last five years. The helpdesk provides information on demand by answering in total 15.300 enquiries and arranging 114 bilateral talks to industry. In the year 2008 companies had to fulfil their duty to pre-register phase-in substances in order to take advantage from the transitional regime providing registration deadlines depending on the <b>tonnage</b> <b>band.</b> Looking back on a continuous increase of enquiries in the beginning of 2008 the maximum peak was reached with 1100 enquires in November close to the deadline of 1 December 2008.|$|E
30|$|Nanomaterials {{have a low}} bulk density. This {{comes along}} with a {{typically}} high technical effectiveness caused by a high specific surface area and changes of reactivity, respectively. These characteristics together allow a wide dispersive use by a low mass application of the substance. Therefore {{and because of the}} uncertainties regarding (eco-) toxicology, environmental fate and exposure information requirements should already apply at lower tonnage bands. Following the structure of the REACH regulation for tonnage-based triggers, it would be reasonable to stipulate a simplified registration for nanomaterials starting from 100  kg/a, which requires information about substance identity, characterisation and use. Starting at a <b>tonnage</b> <b>band</b> of 1  t/a, requirements regarding (eco-) toxicology listed in a new nanospecific annex have to be fulfilled. This nanospecific annex covers information requirements for the different tonnage levels. With respect to environment, these nanospecific information requirements subject chronic tests instead of acute tests at lower tonnage levels. Regarding the presumable partitioning of nanomaterials within the environment, appropriate target organisms have to be taken into account. That means information requirements must cover toxicity to sediment and soil organisms at lower tonnages. Furthermore, low water solubility as the exclusive waiving criterion for aquatic testing is not appropriate for nanomaterials, since also insoluble nanomaterials can show effects in the environment. Moreover, a chemical safety report, which considers every nanoform separately, has to be submitted if the sum of all nanoforms of a substance reaches the quantity of 1  t/a. Future adjustments regarding assessment concepts and test guidelines have to be taken into account.|$|E
40|$|Prediction of {{neurotoxic}} {{effects is}} a key feature in the toxicological profile of many compounds and therefore is required by regulatory testing schemes. Nowadays neurotoxicity assessment required by the OECD and EC test guidelines is based solely on in vivo testing, evaluating mainly effects on neurobehavior and neuropathology, which is expensive, time consuming and unsuitable for screening large number of chemicals. Additionally, such in vivo tests are not always sensitive enough to predict human neurotoxicity and often do not provide information that facilitates regulatory decision-making processes. Incorporation of alternative tests (in vitro testing, computational modelling, QSARs, grouping, read-across, etc.) in screening strategies would speed up {{the rate at which}} compound knowledge and mechanistic data are available and the information obtained could be used in the refinement of future in vivo studies to facilitate predictions of neurotoxicity. On 1 st June 2007, the European Commission legislation concerning registration, evaluation and authorisation of chemicals (REACH) has entered into force. REACH addresses one of the key issues for chemicals in Europe, the lack of publicly available safety data sheets. It outlines a plan to test approximately 30, 000 existing substances. These chemicals are currently produced in volumes greater than 1 ton/year and the essential data on the human health and ecotoxicological effects are lacking. It is estimated that approximately 3. 9 million test animals (including 2. 6 million vertebrates) (Hartung T, Bremer S, Casati S, Coecke S, Corvi R, Fortnaer S, et al. ECVAM's response to the changing political environment for alternatives: consequences of the European Union chemicals and cosmetics policies. ATLA 2003; 31 : 473 – 81) would be necessary to fulfill the requirements of REACH if the development and establishment of alternative methods is not accepted by regulatory authorities. In an effort to reduce animal use and testing costs within this <b>tonnage</b> <b>band,</b> the European Commission has advocated the use of alternative approaches. Neurotoxicity testing is not directly addressed within REACH, however when alerts are observed based on organ specific toxicity studies then neurotoxicity assessment has to be performed. This session at the 11 th International Neurotoxicology Association Meeting provided a forum to openly discuss and debate the potential of in vitro testing strategies that could be relevant for neurotoxicity evaluation in the context of regulatory requirements. The EU FP 6 project A-Cute-Tox was presented {{as an example of a}} possible in vitro testing strategy for prediction of human acute systemic toxicity. Other presentations focused on the characterization of the available in vitro models (cell lines and primary culture) and neuronal specific endpoints, with a special emphasis on electrical activity, metabonomics and modulation of vesicular neurotransmitter release as possible neuronal endpoints relevant for in vitro neurotoxicity testing. Finally, it was underlined that in vitro systems (strategies) that have the potential to be applied for neurotoxicity assessment have to be formally validated under standardised conditions that have been recognised by national and international validation bodies. Work by the authors was supported by the following grants: FIS PI 061212 (Ministry of Health, Spain), the EU Integrated Project LSHB-CT- 2004 - 512051 (CS), the European Union (DEVNERTOX-FOOD-CT 2003 - 506143) and MIUR (PRIN 2004) (LGC) and by the State of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and European Community (ERDF).

30|$|According to the REACH Regulation, ECHA publishes {{several items}} of {{information}} (inter alia from the registration dossier) on the Internet [4]. This {{is intended to}} improve the knowledge on the properties and the risk potential of substances. The baseline study [5], which was performed {{on behalf of the}} EU Commission (Eurostat), already proves that this is the case. Meanwhile, ECHA makes publicly available a much wider range of information concerning, inter alia, the identity of the registrant and a more detailed breakdown of <b>tonnage</b> <b>bands.</b>|$|R
30|$|A minimum tonnage of the {{manufactured}} or imported {{substance is}} necessary to trigger registration (1 t/a). The extent of mandatory information is reduced for on-site isolated (OSII) and transported isolated intermediates (TII). The toxicological information requirements increase with increasing <b>tonnage</b> <b>bands</b> only. From an occupational point of view, the profile of use of a substance and information about high exposures and wide dispersive professional uses would serve as more effective triggers. Read-across approaches and waiving of studies can also be justified. The registration requirements of REACH exclude chemical agents not intentionally produced or those present in the workplace for reasons not directly associated with occupation [7].|$|R
30|$|Also in this case, the {{regulation}} of nanomaterials under REACH has to meet specific requirements. This includes a differentiated consideration of the bulk form and nanoform and the different nanoforms of the same substance respectively. Separate risk assessments shall be performed for the different nanoforms. An adequate handling of surface-treated nanomaterials has to be defined. <b>Tonnage</b> <b>bands</b> and information requirements need to be adjusted, and even {{the role of the}} downstream user has to be reconsidered. For all these requirements, the burden of proof has to be {{on the side of the}} registrant. In the following sections, we will present some corner stones of the proposal published by the German federal authorities responsible for REACH[41]. The concept presents considerations how REACH could be amended to adequately cover nanomaterials.|$|R
40|$|Environmental risk {{assessment}} of chemical substances produced or imported in amounts higher than 10 tons/year require a {{short term toxicity}} test on fish. This master thesis analyses whether {{it is possible to}} use in vitro data from experiments with fish cell lines as a regulatory tool in the aquatic {{risk assessment}}. The thesis thus seeks to answer the following question: How can alternative methods like in vitro experiments supplement or replace the current in vivo methods, and if so how can they be integrated in the ecotoxicological risk assessment methods in REACH? Since environmental regulation is based on natural science it is important to reach a scientific consensus regarding whether or not in vitro methods are suitable for ecotoxicological risk assessment. I have produced experimental data using in vitro methods in an ecotoxicological setting in order to discuss this issue from an empirical angle. In order to test an in vitro assay two fish cell lines from carp, namely Cyprinus carpio brain (CCB) and Epithelioma papulosum cyprini (EPC) were exposed to the inorganic compound potassium dichromate and the organic compound acrylamide. The cytotoxicity was observed with the MTT viability assay. The EC 50 values obtained in the experiment were compared to LC 50 values for Cyprinus carpio (C. carpio) found in the literature. The experiments were divided in a short term toxicity test (24 h) and a time-experiment (96 h) where measurements were taken every 24 hours. My results indicated no signs of correlation between in vitro data and in vivo data, which is in accordance with some other authors. Fish cell lines were more sensitive to potassium dichromate than fish, but for acrylamide the opposite was observed. Because the obtained experimental data is conflicting it is only possible to conclude {{that it is difficult to}} draw general conclusions on that issue. However there are some advantages with in vitro assays that should not be overlooked. They are cost effective, produce less waste and are able to screen a large amount of chemicals in a short time. Based on these assumptions it can be concluded that in vitro methods do have serious limitations, that need further investigation, but as a screening tool for the <b>tonnage</b> <b>band</b> 1 - 10 tons/year it could be useful due to its ability to handle many contaminants in a short time. Therefore in vitro methods should be supplemented by the “Threshold approach” method, which focus on test with algae and daphnia, because they are often reported to be more sensitive than fish. In addition to the scientific possibilities it is important that the legislative foundation for implementation of in vitro methods in REACH is present. The second analysis of this thesis concerns whether it is possible to implement in vitro methods in REACH. Furthermore the analysis includes a qualitative scientific interview. This aspect is important in regard to the evaluation of the usefulness of a regulatory tool. This thesis concludes that there needs to be consensus among the scientific researchers before in vitro methods can be implemented in the aquatic risk assessment. Due to in vitro methods acceptance in the human health risk assessment of chemicals, there should be no regulatory obstacles to implement in vitro methods in environmental risk assessment of chemicals...|$|E
30|$|There are {{exemptions}} {{from the}} obligation to register in accordance with Art. 2 (7 b) e.g. ‘Substances occurring in nature other than those listed under paragraph 7 (which are inorganic substances or petrochemicals (added by the author)), {{if they are not}} chemically modified, unless they meet the criteria for classification as dangerous according to Directive 67 / 548 /EEC.’ The natural substances in the INCI list that are classified as hazardous substances should therefore be registered according to REACH. 19 natural substances in the INCI list are registered according to REACH with annual production <b>tonnage</b> <b>bands</b> up to 100, 000 to 1, 000, 000  t/a (Table  5). As substances used as medicinal products, food and feeding stuff {{do not need to be}} registered, evaluated, and authorized according to REACH Art. 2 (5), production volumes indicated in Table  5 cover the uses in other applications, e.g. in personal care products. The other 350 natural substances which are classified and labeled according to the C&L inventory have not been registered so far. Some of them might be registered in 2018, the registration deadline for production volumes of 1 to 100  t/a. Furthermore, it must be assumed that some of the 703 natural substances that do not turn up in the C&L inventory so far also will have to be registered according to REACH in future. Classifications in the REACH registration are not in line with the classifications by the majority of notifiers in the C&L inventory as shown in Table  5.|$|R
