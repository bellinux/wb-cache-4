Joining Admiral William Hotham's fleet on 14June, Gibraltar fought in an action off the Hyères Islands in July. The fleet was re-victualling in San Fiorenzo bay on 8July when a small squadron under Commodore Horatio Nelson approached, followed by the French Fleet from Toulon. The British fleet was not able to put to sea immediately due to contrary winds but was spotted by the French, who abandoned their chase. Hotham finished refitting and supplying his ships, and finally managed to set off after his quarry at 21:00; almost twelve hours later. Following a storm, the British were carrying out repairs when they sighted the French fleet at dawn on 13July. At 03:45 Hotham gave the order to make all possible sail in pursuit of their enemy, five miles off and heading for Fréjus. The two fleets were close enough to exchange fire at 08:00 when the British van engaged the rearmost French ships, one of which struck after six hours. However, she caught fire and exploded before the British could take possession of her. Just as Gibraltar was joining the action, Hotham signalled to disengage, believing the fleet to be running out of sea-room but being too far back <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was not the case. Hotham resigned his position early the following year and was eventually replaced by Admiral John Jervis.|$|E

The historian David Hill shows how all of the recensions {{can be used to}} correct each other or at least help us understand how errors, especially in the hidage numbers, were mistranscribed in the copying process. Hill argues that these errors are not conflicts of facts or derive from differing lists, but simply errors in copying from a common source; it is possible <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was because lines of the text were being missed. However, as noted above, the ‘B’ recensions do not list Burpham, Wareham and Bridport, it is likely that their common archetype must have missed them also. Yet it too must have contained the ‘grand total’ sentence at the end which is flatly contradicted by the hidages enumerated.|$|E

One of her recommendations was that Congress should create a new State Department Bureau for African Affairs to be overseen by a new {{assistant secretary of state for}} African affairs. Bolton helped <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> did in fact happen, and Congress created the new bureau in 1958. In addition to sharing information about her trip with Congress through her official report, Bolton also made an impressive effort to enlighten the American people about the diversity of the African continent by creating a film about her trip, entitled Africa: Giant With a Future, 1955. This film is an excellent resource for students and instructors wanting a look at several African countries/colonies in the mid-1950s, and has been made available on DVD by the National Archives. In addition to educating Congress and the general public about Africa, Bolton's trip helped to begin the process of opening doors for women to play a major role in US foreign relations.|$|E

40|$|According to rule consequentialism, {{an agent}} can be morally {{required}} to φ in {{virtue of the}} fact that her φ-ing is part of a set of acts (such as the set consisting in everyone’s following the ideal code) that, if realized, would have good consequences, and this can be so even if she is unable <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>to</b> it <b>that</b> <b>this</b> set and its good consequences are realized and even if her φ-ing would not itself have good consequences. 1 But, as I will argue, an agent has a reason to φ in virtue {{of the fact that}} her φ-ing is part of a set of acts that, if realized, would have good consequences only if she is able <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>to</b> it <b>that</b> <b>this</b> set and its good consequences are realized. <b>This</b> means <b>that,</b> absent there being some other fact that constitutes sufficient reason for her to φ, rule consequentialism requires agents to act in ways that they lack sufficient reason to act.
