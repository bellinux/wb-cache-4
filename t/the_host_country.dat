40|$|Abstract: The {{importance}} of {{foreign direct investment}} (FDI) for <b>the</b> <b>host</b> <b>countries</b> has been arguable since its emergence. Numerous country-specific and cross-countries {{studies have been conducted}} to investigate the impacts of <b>the</b> FDI on <b>host</b> <b>countries</b> from different angles. Review of empirical evidence may help us enhance our understanding about of the effects of <b>the</b> FDI on <b>host</b> <b>countries</b> and to develop a framework that may help if not for all but for most of <b>the</b> <b>host</b> <b>countries</b> in capitalizing FDI. This study reviewed the empirical evidence related to the FDI impacts focusing on economic growth and human capital in <b>the</b> <b>host</b> <b>countries.</b> This study would help to understand which assumptions about the FDI are supported robustly by empirical evidence. Moreover, this study points to various directions for further research...|$|R

The Jury aims to order the problems so that the order in increasing difficulty is Q1, Q4, Q2, Q5, Q3 and Q6. As the leaders know the problems in advance of the contestants, they are kept strictly separated and observed.|$|E

All members of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) were eligible to become members of the agency. MIGA was established as an effort to complement existing sources of non-commercial risk insurance for investments in developing countries, and thereby improve investor confidence. The agency's mandate to be apolitical has been said to be an advantage over private and national risk insurance markets.
