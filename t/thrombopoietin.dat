25|$|The {{coating of}} {{platelets}} with IgG renders them susceptible to opsonization and phagocytosis by splenic macrophages, as well by Kupffer {{cells in the}} liver.nbsp& The IgG autoantibodies are also thought to damage megakaryocytes, the precursor cells to platelets, although this is believed to contribute only slightly to the decrease in platelet numbers.nbsp& Recent research now indicates that impaired production of the glycoprotein hormone <b>thrombopoietin,</b> which is the stimulant for platelet production, may be a contributing factor to the reduction in circulating platelets.nbsp& This observation {{has led to the}} development of a class of ITP-targeted drugs referred to as <b>thrombopoietin</b> receptor agonists.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to RTK pathway, fibroblast growth factors can also activate the Jak-STAT signaling cascade. Instead of carrying covalently associated tyrosine kinase domains, Jak-STAT receptors form noncovalent complexes with tyrosine kinases of the Jak (Janus kinase) class. These receptors bind are for erythropoietin (important for erythropoiesis), <b>thrombopoietin</b> (important for platelet formation), and interferon (important for mediating immune cell function).|$|E

2500|$|Thrombopoetin analogues {{have been}} tested {{extensively}} {{for the treatment of}} ITP. [...] These agents had previously shown promise but had been found to stimulate antibodies against endogenous <b>thrombopoietin</b> or lead to thrombosis. Romiplostim (trade name Nplate, formerly AMG 531) was found to be safe and effective for the treatment of ITP in refractory patients, especially those who relapsed following splenectomy.|$|E
50|$|The ligand for c-mpl, <b>thrombopoietin,</b> was cloned in 1994. <b>Thrombopoietin</b> {{was shown}} to be the major {{regulator}} of megakaryocytopoiesis and platelet formation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Thrombopoietin</b> {{regulates the}} {{differentiation}} of megakaryocytes and platelets, but {{studies on the}} removal of the <b>thrombopoietin</b> receptor show that its effects on hematopoiesis are more versatile.|$|E
50|$|<b>Thrombopoietin</b> was cloned by five {{independent}} {{teams in}} 1994. Before its identification, its function has been hypothesized {{for as much}} as 30 years as being linked to the cell surface receptor c-Mpl, and in older publications <b>thrombopoietin</b> is described as c-Mpl ligand (the agent that binds to the c-Mpl molecule). <b>Thrombopoietin</b> is one of the Class I hematopoietic cytokines.|$|E
50|$|Its {{negative}} feedback {{is different from}} that of most hormones in endocrinology: The effector regulates the hormone directly. <b>Thrombopoietin</b> is bound to the surface of platelets by the mpl receptor (CD 110) and destroyed, thereby reducing megakaryocyte exposure to the hormone. Therefore, the rising and dropping platelet concentrations regulate the <b>thrombopoietin</b> levels. Low platelets lead a higher degree of <b>thrombopoietin</b> exposure to the undifferentiated bone marrow cells, leading to differentiation into megakaryocytes and further maturation of these cells. On the other hand, high platelet concentrations lead to less availability of <b>thrombopoietin</b> to megakaryocytes.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Thrombopoietin</b> stimulates megakaryopoiesis, {{the process}} of {{megakaryocyte}} maturation and differentiation. <b>Thrombopoietin,</b> upon release, binds to its receptor, c-mpl, found on megakaryocyte progenitor cells. Following binding, intracellular signalling leads to megakaryocyte growth, maturation, membrane stability, platelet granule formation and the demarcation of the cytoplasm into regions destined to fragment into mature platelets. These [...] "proplatelet processes" [...] further fragment into platelets. This last step of proplatelet process and platelet formation, in vitro, {{has been shown to}} be independent of <b>thrombopoietin.</b>|$|E

50|$|The MPL gene {{codes for}} a protein {{that acts as}} a {{receptor}} for <b>thrombopoietin.</b> A mutation in that gene, known as a W515 mutation, leads to the production of an abnormal <b>thrombopoietin</b> receptor protein, which results in the overproduction of abnormal megakaryocytes. The abnormal megakaryocytes stimulate other cells, the fibroblasts, to produce collagen in the bone marrow.|$|E

50|$|In June 1994, the New York Times {{reported}} that Dr. Kaushansky {{along with a}} team from ZymoGenetics had found the mouse <b>thrombopoietin</b> gene, cloned it, produced recombinant hormone, demonstrated that it worked as expected in mice and then found the human hormone by looking for a human gene that resembled the mouse gene.In recent years his group has established that <b>thrombopoietin</b> exerts a profound influence on hematopoietic stem cells, affects {{the expression of a}} number of transcription factors that influence stem cell fate decisions (HOXB4, HOXA9, c-Myb, HIF1A) and has unraveled the pathobiology of several congenital disorders of thrombopoiesis.|$|E
