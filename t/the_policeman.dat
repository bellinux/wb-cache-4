5|$|Later, Alan and Joanna are {{stopped by}} a {{policeman}} on suspicion of stealing the campervan. Joanna gets her peanut-butter sandwich and smears it in the policeman's face. Alan and Joanna have an argument about the minute odds of <b>the</b> <b>policeman</b> having a peanut allergy and going into anaphylaxis, while in the background this is actually happening. They then carry the body of <b>the</b> <b>policeman</b> into the van. Soon, having run out of food and petrol, Alan changes the engine to run on alcohol and fermented excrement. The plan is of no use however, as the van explodes. They soon reach the beach and Joanna gives Alan three options: Give themselves up, swim the Channel to Spain or commit suicide. As Alan is not keen on the Spanish, they choose the third option and they are last seen walking naked into the sea, presumably to their deaths - although the alternate ending shows them hanging on to a buoy sometime later.|$|E
5|$|Isabella {{is accused}} of driving a stolen van and taken into custody, while the other {{survivors}} reunite for safety. After Nora is decapitated by malfunctioning elevator doors, the group leaves to track down Isabella, who has gone into labor at the police station, while <b>the</b> <b>policeman</b> on duty rushes Isabella {{to the hospital in}} her van. Along the way they discover they have all cheated death twice; {{had it not been for}} the survivors of Flight 180 they would all be dead, which explains why the survivors are dying in reverse. Since Thomas saved Kimberly from being hit by the truck, she is last on Death's list.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>policemen</b> all bore a {{statutory}} {{and constitutional}} duty to prevent crime {{and protect the}} members of the public. That duty also rested on their employer, and <b>the</b> <b>policemen</b> had been employed to perform that obligation.|$|R
50|$|Considering {{that the}} police force ratio to the populace is not sufficient, the Civilian Volunteers Organization (CVO) was created to augment <b>the</b> <b>policemen.</b> Today, there are 40 members of CVO serving {{alongside}} <b>the</b> <b>policemen</b> of <b>the</b> city.|$|R
5|$|Gens {{also came}} into {{conflict}} with the Judenrat and Friend over <b>the</b> Jewish <b>policemen</b> who guarded <b>the</b> gates into the ghetto. The Germans allowed <b>the</b> Jewish <b>policemen</b> to control access to the ghetto and conduct searches for contraband. Gens' policy was that when no Germans were present at <b>the</b> gates, <b>the</b> <b>policemen</b> would do minimal searches and would allow smuggling of food and other necessary items. If Germans were present at <b>the</b> gates, <b>the</b> <b>policemen</b> conducted thorough searches and often beat up attempted smugglers. In Gens' view, if the Germans thought <b>the</b> Jewish <b>policemen</b> were not vigilant enough, <b>the</b> <b>policemen</b> would be replaced by German guards and any opportunity for smuggling would cease. He also claimed that even when the Germans were present, any confiscated items were brought into the ghetto, which {{would not be the}} case if there were German guards at the gates.|$|R
5|$|Khan, {{suspicious}} that Jimmy {{has become}} a police informer, decides to kill him but Aslam offers to do the deed to deflect police attention. He, Dedh Tang and several thugs masquerade as rival (Yamaha RX100)biker gangs and stage a brawl. Plainclothes police officers try to control the chaos when Aslam corners Jimmy. When a police officer stops Aslam, Khan appears out of nowhere, murders Jimmy and injures <b>the</b> <b>policeman.</b> A chase ensues; the police fail to catch the two, who escape in Khan's Mercedes.|$|E
5|$|The rock {{supposedly}} {{found in}} the lake, said to be taken from the Park's garden wall, has been challenged as evidence in multiple places. Both articles say that the police diver had no memory of recovering it, and he claimed {{that if he had}} found it, he would have placed it back. Professor Kenneth Pye, a defense witness, said that {{there was no evidence that}} the rock had ever been on the lake bed at all. The article in the Sunday Herald also claims that <b>the</b> <b>policeman</b> said to be responsible for finding the rock fainted when it was produced in court, offering no explanation, but still denying that he ever found it.|$|E
5|$|Green can {{communicate}} safety to proceed, as in traffic lights. Green and red were standardized as {{the colors of}} international railroad signals in the 19th century. The first traffic light, using green and red gas lamps, was erected in 1868 {{in front of the}} Houses of Parliament in London. It exploded the following year, injuring <b>the</b> <b>policeman</b> who operated it. In 1912, the first modern electric traffic lights were put up in Salt Lake City, Utah. Red was chosen largely because of its high visibility, and its association with danger, while green was chosen largely because it could not be mistaken for red. Today green lights universally signal that a system is turned on and working as it should. In many video games, green signifies both health and completed objectives, opposite red.|$|E
60|$|The gang {{had already}} taken to flight, and they blocked the boys' retreat in one quarter, and in another they saw <b>the</b> <b>policemen</b> advancing.

5|$|As {{the gang}} exited the {{property}} and made to escape up the cul-de-sac, other police intervened. Sergeant Charles Tucker from Bishopsgate police station was hit twice, once in the hip and once in the heart by Peters: he died instantly. Choate grabbed Gardstein and wrestled for his gun, but the Russian managed to shoot him in the leg. Other members of the gang ran to Gardstein's assistance, shooting Choate twelve times in the process, but Gardstein was also wounded; as <b>the</b> <b>policeman</b> collapsed, Gardstein was carried away by his accomplices, who included Peters. As these men, aided by an unknown woman, made their escape with Gardstein they were accosted by Isaac Levy, a passer-by, whom they threatened at pistol-point. He was the only witness to the escape {{who was able to}} provide firm details; other witnesses confirmed they saw a group of three men and a woman, and thought one of the men was drunk as he was being helped by his friends. The group, which included Peters, went to Svaars' and Peter the Painter's lodgings at 59 Grove Street (now Goldring Street), off Commercial Road, where Gardstein was tended by two of the gang's associates, Luba Milstein (Svaars' mistress) and Sara Trassjonsky. As they left Gardstein on the bed, Peters left his Dreyse pistol under the mattress, either to make it seem the wounded man {{was the one who had}} killed Tucker, or to enable him to defend himself against a possible arrest.|$|E
5|$|Love, sex {{and desire}} become {{important}} elements of the plot in Sant Singh Sekhon's Punjabi play Kalakar (1945), which places the epic drama in the modern age. It depicts Ahalya as a free-spirited woman, who dares to be painted nude by Inder (Indra), a pupil of the art professor, Gautama, and defends her decision against her husband's criticisms. N. S. Madhavan's Malayalam story (April 2006) also retells Ahalya's tale in a modern setting, wherein Ahalya, accused of adultery, is beaten by her husband, leaving her in a coma from which the neurologist, Rama, revives her. The 2015 film Ahalya gives a feminist twist to the tale where <b>the</b> <b>policeman</b> Indra turns into a stone doll, after visiting Ahalya. The tale was also parodied in the Telugu film Attarintiki Daredi. However, the practice of retelling the classical Ahalya–Indra tale in a contemporary setting is not new. The Yoga Vasistha (1001–1400) narrates {{a tale of two}} adulterous lovers, Queen Ahalya and the Brahmin Indra. Here, Ahalya and Indra fall in love and continue their affair, despite being punished by Ahalya's jealous husband. After death, they reunite in their next birth.|$|E
5|$|One week later, Mrs. Mallard {{leads the}} ducklings ashore and {{straight}} to the highway in hopes of crossing to reach the Garden, but she has trouble crossing as the cars will not yield to her. Michael, <b>the</b> <b>policeman</b> who the Mallards visited, stops traffic for the family to cross. Michael calls police headquarters and instructs them to send a police car to stop traffic along the route for the ducks. The ducks cross the highway, Embankment Road (Storrow Drive {{had yet to be}} constructed when the book was written), then proceed down Mount Vernon Street to Charles Street where they head south to the Garden. The people on the streets admire the family of ducks. When the family must cross Beacon Street to enter the Garden, there are four policemen standing in the intersection stopping traffic {{to make way for the}} ducklings. Mr. Mallard is waiting in the Public Garden for the rest of the family. Finally, the family decides to stay in the Garden and lives happily ever after. They end each day searching for peanuts and food, and when night falls, they swim to their little island and go to sleep.|$|E

5|$|Piper {{reported}} {{that as he}} was leaving Exchange Buildings to return to Houndsditch he saw a man acting suspiciously {{in the shadows of the}} cul-de-sac. As <b>the</b> <b>policeman</b> approached him, the man walked away; Piper later described him as being approximately , pale and fair-haired. When Piper reached Houndsditch he saw two policemen from the adjoining beats—constables Woodhams and Choate—who watched 120 Houndsditch and 11 Exchange Buildings while Piper went to the nearby Bishopsgate Police Station to report. By 11:30 seven uniformed and two plain clothes policemen had gathered in the locality, each armed with his wooden truncheon. Sergeant Bentley from Bishopsgate police station knocked at number 11, unaware that Piper had already done so, which alerted the gang. The door was answered by Gardstein, who made no response when Bentley asked if anyone was working there. Bentley asked him to fetch someone who spoke English; Gardstein left the door half-closed and disappeared inside. Bentley entered the hall with Sergeant Bryant and Constable Woodhams; as they could see the bottom of his trouser legs, they soon realised that someone was watching them from the stairs. The police asked the man if they could step into the back of the property, and he agreed. As Bentley moved forward, the back door opened and one of the gang exited, firing from a pistol as he did so; the man on the stairs also began firing. Bentley was shot in the shoulder and the neck—the second round severing his spine. Bryant was shot in the arm and chest and Woodhams was wounded in the leg, which broke his femur; both collapsed. Although they survived, neither Bryant or Woodhams fully recovered from their injuries.|$|E
5|$|The armed {{vehicle and}} the {{soldiers}} following the human shield were ambushed in the centre of Struga by a single policeman and a civilian who threw a hand grenade and ran towards the vehicle, carrying three more hand grenades strapped to his waist. As the hand grenades exploded, gunfire erupted allowing the civilians held as human shields to run away. <b>The</b> <b>policeman</b> and civilian who carried out the ambush were both killed; sources identify the two as reserve policeman Mile Blažević and traffic policeman Željko Filipović. Shortly before 16:00, the Croatian forces counterattacked, causing the bulk of Popović's troops to flee. Popović and his remaining five or six soldiers retreated. At least five SAO Krajina troops were killed and twenty wounded in fighting in Struga. By 18:00, the battalion led by Orlović had lost 80 percent of its personnel to desertion. Prompted by the desertions and heavy shooting in Struga at 19:00, Bogdan Vajagić, the commanding officer of the SAO Krajina units subordinated to the Dvor headquarters, requested that the JNA intervene. The JNA informed Vajagić that a unit was dispatched from Petrinja, allowing him to break off further fighting with the Croatian police and send two platoons as reinforcements to Glina as reinforcements at Vasiljković's request. JNA tanks reached Struga at 19:50 to establish a buffer zone. Croatian forces there offered to leave the village if the JNA provided them with one armoured personnel carrier and escorted them to Hrvatska Kostajnica. The JNA complied with the request. During the fighting, 12 Croatian policemen were killed, along with 20 civilians.|$|E
5|$|The video {{opens in}} a deserted, {{destroyed}} school hallway with Lee's character shown {{sitting on the}} ground. As the first verse begins, he slowly begins {{to stand up and}} makes his way through the hallway. The boy then sees a female teacher in a classroom who's stricken with fear and closes the door, realizing that the boy is the cause of the damage. As the boy makes his way outside the school building, a police car arrives and the teacher rushes outside to tell <b>the</b> <b>policeman</b> about the boy, who then quickly rides a bicycle home to pack his things. While at home, he sees a news report about the incident, causing him to quickly gather his things to flee. Several policemen then appear outside {{the front door of the}} boy's house, while he tries to escape through the back door. The boy realizes that the door is locked so he uses his telekinetic powers to grab the keys from the kitchen bench. The policemen then enter the house to find that the boy has escaped, but find a teddy bear and a plush frog floating in the air. The final scene shows the boy running away from a SWAT team in the woods. The boy is caught by one of the men who pushes him to the ground. The video ends with the boy using his supernatural powers once again to push the men away in a burst of power; this references how the boy destroyed the school in the first place, as he's in the same position he was in at the beginning of the video. The aftermath of the outburst in the end, however, remains unknown.|$|E

25|$|On 6 November 1990, Chikatilo {{killed and}} {{mutilated}} a 22-year-old woman, named Svetlana Korostik, in woodland near Donleskhoz station. While leaving the crime scene, he was observed by an undercover officer. <b>The</b> <b>policeman</b> observed Chikatilo approach a well and wash {{his hands and}} face. When he approached the station, the undercover officer noted that Chikatilo's coat had grass and soil stains on the elbows. Chikatilo also had a small red smear on his cheek. To the officer, he looked suspicious. The only reason people entered woodland near the station {{at that time of}} year was to gather wild mushrooms (a popular pastime in Russia), but Chikatilo was not dressed like a typical forest scavenger; he was wearing more formal attire. Moreover, he had a nylon sports bag, which was unsuitable for carrying mushrooms. <b>The</b> <b>policeman</b> stopped Chikatilo and checked his papers, but had no formal reason to arrest him. When <b>the</b> <b>policeman</b> returned to his office, he filed a routine report, containing the name of the person he had stopped at the station.|$|E

After the show, SAC Supian Amat lodged a police report against Patrick under the instruction of Rahim Noor, then the IGP of Malaysia, resulting in Patrick being called to the police station for interviews.
