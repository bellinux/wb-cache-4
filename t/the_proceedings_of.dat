5|$|In 1958, Khrushchev {{opened a}} Central Committee meeting to {{hundreds}} of Soviet officials; some were even allowed to address the meeting. For the first time, <b>the</b> <b>proceedings</b> <b>of</b> the Committee were made public in book form, a practice which was continued at subsequent meetings. This openness, however, actually allowed Khrushchev greater control over the Committee, since any dissenters {{would have to make}} their case in front of a large, disapproving crowd.|$|E

After the conference, Ismay visited the American headquarters in Algiers to meet with Eisenhower, and helped resolve some differences of opinion between Eisenhower and his British colleagues.|$|E

5|$|The Grand Duchy's {{population}} was 65% Polish but with its exclusion of serfs and underrepresentation of landless rural commoners the electoral law {{was designed to}} favor the German inhabitants. The proportion of Polish representatives diminished further after the events of 1848, and Jacek Jędruch notes that due to growing discrimination against Polish representatives that date {{marks the end of}} the period in which this legislative body can be seen as continuing the Polish parliamentary tradition. Also, while <b>the</b> <b>proceedings</b> <b>of</b> the first sejms were published in Polish, since 1877 they were published in German.|$|E
5|$|The main ISMB {{conference is}} usually held over {{three days and}} {{consists}} of presentations, poster sessions and keynote talks. Most presentations are given in multiple parallel tracks; however, keynote talks are presented in a single track and are chosen to reflect outstanding research in bioinformatics. Notable ISMB keynote speakers have included eight Nobel laureates. The recipients of the ISCB Overton Prize and ISCB Accomplishment by a Senior Scientist Award are invited to give keynote talks {{as part of the}} programme. <b>The</b> <b>proceedings</b> <b>of</b> the conference are currently published by the journal Bioinformatics.|$|E
5|$|The {{second half}} of the 18th century, marking the age of the Enlightenment in Poland, also {{witnessed}} an increased trend aiming at the reform of the inefficient governance of the Commonwealth. Reforms of 1764–1766 improved <b>the</b> <b>proceedings</b> <b>of</b> the Sejm. Majority voting for non-crucial items, including most economic and tax matters, was introduced, with binding instructions from sejmiks being outlawed. The road to reform was not easy, as conservatives, supported by foreign powers, opposed most of the changes and attempted to defend the liberum veto and other elements perpetuating the inefficient governance, most notably by the Cardinal Laws of 1768.|$|E

5|$|Von Neumann's {{results have}} been viewed as a special case of linear programming, where von Neumann's model uses only nonnegative matrices. The study of von Neumann's model of an {{expanding}} economy continues to interest mathematical economists with interests in computational economics. This paper {{has been called the}} greatest paper in mathematical economics by several authors, who recognized its introduction of fixed-point theorems, linear inequalities, complementary slackness, and saddlepoint duality. In <b>the</b> <b>proceedings</b> <b>of</b> a conference on von Neumann's growth model, Paul Samuelson said that many mathematicians had developed methods useful to economists, but that von Neumann was unique in having made significant contributions to economic theory itself.|$|E
