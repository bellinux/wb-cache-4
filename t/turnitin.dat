Supplementary materials generally carry [...] "no weight" [...] in college admissions, according to one view. A report in Time Magazine suggested that many elite colleges used a vaguer measure of institutional fit to decide who is admitted, which is based on nonacademic qualities and may favor [...] "underrepresented minorities and students who demonstrate exceptional talent." [...] Students who take a [...] "gap year" [...] between high school and college can benefit if the year was enriching and developing and helped the student mature.|$|E

5000|$|... iParadigms, {{the company}} behind <b>Turnitin,</b> runs another {{commercial}} website called WriteCheck, where students must {{pay a fee}} to have a paper tested against the database used by <b>Turnitin,</b> {{in order to determine}} whether or not that paper will be detected as plagiarism when the student submit that paper to the main <b>Turnitin</b> website through the account provided by the school. Alex Tabarrok complained that [...] "They are warlords who are arming both sides in this plagiarism war".|$|E

50|$|Some {{students}} {{argue that}} {{requiring them to}} submit papers to <b>Turnitin</b> creates a presumption of guilt, which may violate scholastic disciplinary codes and applicable local laws and judicial practice.

50|$|<b>Turnitin</b> is an Internet-based plagiarism-prevention {{commercial}} service created by iParadigms, LLC, first launched in 1997. Typically, universities {{and high schools}} buy licenses to submit essays to the <b>Turnitin</b> website, which checks the documents for unoriginal content. The results {{can be used to}} identify similarities to existing sources or can be used in formative assessment to help students learn how to avoid plagiarism and improve their writing.|$|E

50|$|In one well-publicized {{dispute over}} {{mandatory}} <b>Turnitin</b> submissions, Jesse Rosenfeld, {{a student at}} McGill University declined to submit his academic work to <b>Turnitin.</b> The University Senate eventually ruled that Rosenfeld's assignments were to be graded without using <b>Turnitin.</b> In 2005 another McGill student, Denise Brunsdon, refused to submit her assignment to Turnitin.com and won a similar ruling from the Senate Committee on Student Grievances.A few other Canadian universities are currently {{in the process of}} either total or partial ban of this service. On March 6, 2006, the Senate at Mount Saint Vincent University in Nova Scotia prohibited the submission of students' academic work to Turnitin.com and any software that requires students' work to become part of an external database where other parties might have access to it. This decision was granted after the students' union alerted the university community of their legal and privacy concerns {{associated with the use of}} Turnitin.com and other anti-plagiarism devices that profit from students' academic work. This was the first campus-wide ban of its kind in Canada, following decisions by Princeton, Harvard, Yale and Stanford in the US not to use <b>Turnitin.</b>|$|E

50|$|Students may be {{required}} by schools to submit essays to <b>Turnitin,</b> {{as a deterrent to}} plagiarism. This {{has been a source of}} criticism, with some students refusing to do so in the belief that requiring it constitutes a presumption of guilt. Additionally, critics have alleged that use of this proprietary software violates educational privacy as well as international intellectual property laws, and exploits students' works for commercial purposes by permanently storing them in Turnitin's private database.|$|E
50|$|The {{assignments}} {{prepared by}} essay-writing companies and other paid third-parties are supposedly 'original', {{meaning that they}} are likely to evade detection by software packages such as <b>Turnitin.</b> Assessment design strategies may limit the possibility that students can use contract cheating services, although a 2014 publication in Educational Studies showed that reducing the time that students have to prepare their assessments is unlikely to deter contract cheating, and that there appeared to be significant spare capacity in the contract cheating market.|$|E
50|$|In addition, AHA is {{currently}} using <b>Turnitin,</b> a website that scans finished papers and assignments for plagiarism and helps prevent it as well. Beginning {{with the class}} of 2011, AHA has recently introduced LiveText, an online storage site in which each student is able to upload their best papers and projects, ultimately creating their own 'online resume.' With this new addition, each student is given an edge that many students from other schools do not have as this program allows each student {{to create their own}} video introducing themselves to prospective colleges.|$|E
50|$|In 2006, seven {{members of}} the senior class, calling {{themselves}} the Committee For Students' Rights, staged a protest against the plagiarism detection service <b>Turnitin.</b> The committee argued {{that the use of}} <b>Turnitin</b> was a violation of their intellectual property rights, put them in a situation where guilt of all parties was assumed, and also violated student privacy as specified in FERPA. The students were interviewed for three articles in the Washington Post, received the services of an intellectual property attorney, and one of them, Ben Donovan, was featured on NBC's The Today Show. On March 27, 2007 four high school students, two from McLean, filed legal action against iParadigms LLC, the parent company of Turnitin.com. The lawsuit was filed in United States District Court, Eastern District of Virginia, the jurisdiction where McLean lies. iParadigms counterclaimed, alleging one of the students hacked into its service. Approximately one year later, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of iParadigms and against the students based on the doctrine of fair use, and against iParadigms on their hacking claim because they failed to prove any monetary damages. Both parties appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit. On April 16, 2009, the 4th Circuit court affirmed the district court's judgment against the students in favor of iParadigms, and reversed and remanded the judgment against iParadigms on the hacking claims.|$|E

40|$|An {{accredited}} {{online university}} in the United States of America implemented <b>TurnItIn</b> similarity index rates in online classes {{in order to reduce}} unoriginal writing of online graduate and postgraduate students. The research problem was the lack of empirical research-based findings on the implementation of <b>TurnItIn</b> on reducing unoriginal academic work in online classes. The purpose of this research was to examine the similarity index rates, found in each <b>TurnItIn</b> report of each student’s assignment submitted to www. <b>TurnItIn.</b> com in order to minimize unoriginal student writing. This study was grounded in the social learning theory of Vygotsky. The research question that guided this study was “What is the impact of the implementation of <b>TurnItIn</b> on reducing unoriginal writing in online classes of graduate and postgraduate students? ” Archived data containing the similarity index rates of <b>TurnItIn</b> reports were collected for two cohorts of 111 graduate and 107 postgraduate students before and after the implementation of <b>TurnItIn</b> reports in online classes.

40|$|This article {{presents}} a qualitative critical action research of six Grade 12 {{high school teachers}} who used <b>Turnitin</b> {{as part of their}} assessment processes. <b>Turnitin</b> submissions, one-on-one semi-structured interviews, observation and reflective activities were used for data production/generation. This article concluded that although <b>Turnitin</b> did not help teachers to prevent all learner acts of plagiarism, it did scare the learners away from any obvious act of plagiarism. Teachers and learners became aware of technology as the 'servant', not the 'master'. Grounded analysis was used to generate two themes for this study. This study tried to explore the teachers' reflections of <b>Turnitin</b> used in assessing their learners' work. Purposive sampling was used in selecting the only six Grade 12 teachers who used <b>Turnitin</b> at a school in Durban.
