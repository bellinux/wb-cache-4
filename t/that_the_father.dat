5|$|After {{the birth}} of their daughter, Edith in 1896, Louema {{revealed}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>father</b> of both Edith and her older brother, Harvey (1893), was C. W. Post. Though Post offered him financial interest in La Vita Inn and his prospective famous breakfast drink, Postum, provided Beilhart he would stay and work at the Inn. Outraged at his friend's betrayal, Beilhart ordered Post out of his house and left Battle Creek for Ohio. Louema left Jacob and took the children back to her family in Kansas in 1897. This experience undoubtedly had a profound effect upon Beilhart's view of marriage.|$|E

Two {{aspects of the}} plot {{have been reported in}} reviews that are not reflected in the article's plot section because neither is in the published synopsizes. The review by The Morning Telegraph states that has both the blind girl and mother wander onto the hospital grounds.

He demands <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>fathers</b> both come to the Exchange and swap places with their sons. Bennett and Parker arrive and hatch a plan. Parker engages Mooney in a {{discussion}} where she belittles and trivializes all of the factors motivating Mooney. While she has Mooney distracted, Bennett engages Mooney in another discussion from the opposite side. Bennett convinces Mooney <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>fathers</b> of his hostages have arrived and are coming up the stairs as they speak. Mooney moves towards the stairway to verify this and is shot in the wrists by an FBI sniper stationed across the street. Unable to detonate his explosives with his hands, Mooney tries to do so with his chin and is shot in the head by the sniper.|$|R
5000|$|Given <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Catechism of the Catholic Church #239 {{specifically}} {{states that}} [...] "God is neither man nor woman: he is God", some writers reason <b>that</b> <b>the</b> reported message <b>that</b> God <b>the</b> <b>Father</b> desired his image as an icon {{to be used}} in worship contradicts <b>the</b> Catholic teachings <b>that</b> God <b>the</b> <b>Father</b> is invisible and formless.|$|R

5|$|Agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{investigate}} {{the birth of}} five babies {{in the town of}} Martinsburg, West Virginia, who were born with tails. The mother of the most recent baby, Amanda Nelligan, tells the agents <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>father</b> of her baby is Luke Skywalker. By researching the baby's chromosomes it is discovered that all five share the same father. The parents of the children blame the local fertility doctor, who had used insemination to impregnate all of the mothers but Nelligan. Mulder spots a janitor nearby with signs that he formerly had a tail. When he runs Mulder chases him and catches him. The janitor, Eddie Van Blundht, is discovered to be the father of all of the children. Scully believes Eddie used a date rape drug although Mulder questions how he could be in the position to give it to the women.|$|E

25|$|Many authorities, {{including}} the Rema, note the custom <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>father</b> of a firstborn should fast on his child's behalf until the child reaches halakhic adulthood.

The Mateh Moshe and Maharil dispute this and rule in such a scenario that the mother need not fast. The Magen Avraham rules that it is appropriate to follow the lenient opinion if fasting causes the mother excessive discomfort or if she is pregnant or nursing, but he adds that a mother who begins following the former opinion must maintain that custom and fast in subsequent years.|$|E
25|$|In November 1868, {{following}} the Battle of Washita River, George Custer was alleged (by Captain Frederick Benteen, chief of scouts Ben Clark, and Cheyenne oral tradition) to have unofficially married Mo-nah-se-tah, {{daughter of the}} Cheyenne chief Little Rock in the winter or early spring of 1868–1869. (Little Rock {{was killed in the}} Washita battle.) Mo-nah-se-tah gave birth to a child in January 1869, two months after the Washita battle. Cheyenne oral history tells that she also bore a second child fathered by Custer in late 1869. Some historians, however, believe that George Custer had become sterile after contracting gonorrhea while at West Point and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>father</b> was, in actuality, his brother Thomas.

25|$|In November 2000, William Gibbons {{did some}} {{preliminary}} research in Cameroon {{for a future}} expedition. He was accompanied by David Wetzel, and videographer Elena Dugan.

The pygmies asserted it was not a regular rhinoceros, as it had more than one horn (six horns on the frill in one eyewitness account), and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>father</b> of one of the senior members of the community had killed one with a spear a number of years ago. The locals have noted a firm dwindle in the population of these animals lately, and that they are hard to find.

25|$|Fathers' {{rights advocates}} {{have worked for}} the right of unwed, {{otherwise}} fit, fathers to get custody if the mother tries to have their child adopted by a third party or if child welfare authorities place the child in foster care. Fathers' rights activists seek a gender-neutral approach in which unwed men and women would have equal rights in adoption issues, an approach that critics state does not sufficiently acknowledge the different biological roles in procreation and pregnancy, and the disparity in society's social and economic structures. In the US, some states have passed laws {{to protect the rights}} of unwed fathers to custody. Courts have increasingly supported these rights, though judges often require evidence <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>father</b> has shown interest in, and given financial and emotional support to, the mother during pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|Caffell {{had spent}} time in a {{psychiatric}} hospital being treated for schizophrenia months before the murders. The police believed that she was responsible until Bamber's girlfriend told them he had implicated himself.

They argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>father</b> was too badly injured to have spoken to anyone; that there was no blood on the kitchen phone; and that he would have called the police, not Bamber. They also argued that the silencer was on the gun when the shots were fired, and that Caffell's reach was not long enough to hold the gun and silencer at her throat and press the trigger. In addition she was not strong enough, they said, to have overcome her father in what appeared to have been a violent struggle in the kitchen.|$|E
