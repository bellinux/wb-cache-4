In {{six out of}} six experiments, learners who studied the base lesson without the seductive details about the strikes on airplanes demonstrated they were <b>three</b> <b>times</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> recall the structurally important details. They also performed much better on a problem-solving task than learners whose lessons included the seductive details. Harper and Mayer suggested seductive details do their damage when learners are consolidating and organizing new information by forming knowledge structures ill-suited for later recall.|$|E
5|$|Psoriasis is {{generally}} {{thought to be}} a genetic disease that is triggered by environmental factors. In twin studies, identical twins are <b>three</b> <b>times</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be affected compared to non-identical twins. This suggests that genetic factors predispose to psoriasis. Symptoms often worsen during winter and with certain medications, such as beta blockers or NSAIDs. Infections and psychological stress can also play a role. Psoriasis is not contagious. The underlying mechanism involves the immune system reacting to skin cells. Diagnosis is typically based on the signs and symptoms.|$|E

25|$|High risk {{procedures}} {{or medical}} specialties {{are responsible for}} most avoidable adverse events. (Although some mistakes, such as in surgery, are harder to conceal, errors occur in all levels of care.

Many basic housekeeping and cellular metabolic genes are regulated by bidirectional promoters.The overrepresentation of bidirectionally paired DNA repair genes associates these promoters with cancer. Forty-five percent of human somatic oncogenes seem to be regulated by bidirectional promoters - significantly more than non-cancer causing genes. Hypermethylation of the promoters between gene pairs WNT9A/CD558500, CTDSPL/BC040563, and KCNK15/BF195580 has been associated with tumors.|$|R
50|$|People {{in prison}} are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> {{than the general}} United States {{population}} to have received a mental disorder diagnosis, and women in prison have higher rates of mental illness and mental health treatment than do men in prison.

Women are the fastest growing demographic of the United States prison population. As of 2010 there were over 110,000 women incarcerated in state and federal prisons in the United States and women comprised roughly 7% of all inmates in the United States.|$|R
25|$|Studies {{show that}} there is a direct {{correlation}} between poverty and mental illness. The lower the socioeconomic status of an individual the higher the risk of mental illness. Impoverished people are actually two to <b>three</b> <b>times</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> develop mental illness than those of a higher economic class. This increased risk for psychiatric complications remains consistent for all individuals among the impoverished population, regardless of any in-group demographic differences that they may possess. These families must deal with economic stressors like unemployment and lack of affordable housing, which can lead to mental health disorders. A person's socioeconomic class outlines the psychosocial, environmental, behavioral, and biomedical risk factors that are associated with mental health.|$|E
25|$|Some {{scientists}} propose using brain imaging to help {{decide which}} soon-to-be-released offenders are {{at greater risk}} for reoffending. The brain imaging data would be used along with common factors like age, prior arrests, and marital status. To support this idea, in a 2013 study, Professor Kent Kiehl from the University of New Mexico studying the population of 96 male offenders in the state’s prisons found that offenders with low activity in the anterior cingulate cortex where twice as likely to commit an offense in the four years after their release as those who had high activity in this region. Similarly, Dustin Pardini conducted that which shows that men with a smaller amygdala are <b>three</b> <b>times</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> commit violence three years after their release.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} a number of Islamic ex-gay (i.e. people {{claiming}} to have experienced a basic change in sexual orientation from exclusive homosexuality to exclusive heterosexuality) groups aimed at attempting to guide homosexuals towards heterosexuality. A large body of research and global scientific consensus indicates that being gay, lesbian, or bisexual is compatible with normal mental health and social adjustment. Because of this, major mental health professional organizations discourage and caution individuals against attempting to change their sexual orientation to heterosexual, and warn that attempting to do so can be harmful. People who have gone through conversion therapy face 8.9 times the rates of suicide ideation, face depression at 5.9 {{times the rate of}} their peers and are <b>three</b> <b>times</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> use illegal drugs compared to those who did not go through the therapy.|$|E

A study using upright MRI found cerebellar tonsillar ectopia in 23% of adults with headache from motor-vehicle-accident head trauma. Upright MRI was more than twice as sensitive as standard MRI, likely because gravity affects cerebellar position.|$|R
50|$|Studies {{have also}} found that girls whose fathers left the family early in their lives had {{the highest rates of}} early sexual {{activity}} and adolescent pregnancy. Girls whose fathers left them at a later age had a lower rate of early sexual activity, and the lowest rates are found in girls whose fathers were present throughout their childhood. Even when the researchers took into account other factors that could have contributed to early sexual activity and pregnancy, such as behavioral problems and life adversity, early father-absent girls were still about five <b>times</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> in the United States and <b>three</b> <b>times</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> in New Zealand to become pregnant as adolescents than were father-present girls.|$|R

BDD is a mental illness whereby an individual compulsively focuses on physical self-perceived flaws. According {{to a study by}} Rawhide, 18% of adolescent males were most worried about their weight and physique (Malcore, 2016), while 29% frequently thought about their appearances. Moreover, 50% had recently complained about the way they look. The main causes of male body issues on the other hand, include 25% being teased about their weight, while 33% specified social media as the source for self-consciousness.

25|$|The United States Pharmacopeia (USP) sets {{official}} {{standards for}} all prescription and over-the-counter medicines, dietary supplements, and other healthcare products manufactured {{and sold in}} the United States, but USP standards are also recognized and used in more than 130 other countries. USP operates two programs to promote patient safety. The Medication Errors Reporting Program enables healthcare professionals to report medication errors directly to USP. MEDMARX, an internet-based error and drug reaction reporting program, is designed for use in hospitals. The USP analyzes the data it receives through its reporting programs, develops professional education programs and disseminates alerts related to medication errors. The MEDMARX report released in 2007 analyzed 11,000 medication errors during surgery in 500 hospitals between 1998 and 2005. The analysis showed that medication errors that happen {{in the operating room}} or recovery areas are <b>three</b> <b>times</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> harm a patient than errors occurring in other types of hospital care. , this was the largest known analysis of medical errors related to surgery.|$|E
25|$|A 2011 {{survey of}} the largest cities in the United States by walkscore.com {{determined}} the city of Miami to be ranked eighth in terms of walkability, with an overall walkscore of 73, though Miami provides a case study for the well-known fallibility of WalkScore for not accounting for safety and other factors. The ranking is based on proximity of restaurants, food, transit stops, and entertainment, among other things. Despite this, Miami, along with many younger, auto-dependent southern and western (Sunbelt) cities, is consistently ranked {{as one of the}} most dangerous cities in the US for pedestrians due to rude drivers, very wide roads, and the number of hit and runs; Miami-Dade County was found to have the highest number of pedestrian strikes in a 2013 study. Often several cars will hit a pedestrian and drive away. Sometimes people are even killed while waiting in bus stops when cars run off the road and destroy them. In 2002, pedestrians in Tampa-Orlando and Miami-Fort Lauderdale were found to be <b>three</b> <b>times</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> die than pedestrians in Cincinnati, Cleveland, and Columbus, Ohio. In 2011, all four of the most dangerous metropolitan areas or pedestrians in the United States were in Florida, with Miami-Fort Lauderdale coming in fourth, having a Pedestrian Danger Index five times greater than the New York City metropolitan area based on 2008–2012 data. Additionally, many motorists are acquitted or receive minor punishments for crimes such as DUI vehicular manslaughter and other reckless driving incidents.|$|E
25|$|Peer-to-peer sexual {{harassment}} is <b>three</b> <b>times</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> than perpetration by teachers or other school faculty. Sexual harassment between peers {{may also be a}} result of students trying to conform to expected gender norms created by society. It can also be used as a tool for gender policing. For example, this could be seen if a male is exhibiting behavior not seen to peers as being masculine, so others may label him with homophobic slurs in order to reinforce gender conformity through a form of nonphysical {{sexual harassment}}. Students may exhibit, accept, or tolerate this conforming behavior as to not cause rifts in peer groups.|$|R

Mental health {{is an important part}} of the overall health and wellbeing of males and encompasses a range of differing disorders, each with its own issues. These disorders can impact males in varying ways, from loss of employment, relationship breakdowns, to suicide to name a few. The suicide rate, across all age groups, is higher for males than for females, the median age of men who suicided was 43.8 years of age.
