5|$|In a {{radio address}} on May 11, Alley {{announced}} {{that due to}} the nullification, the military would heve {{to stay in power}} beyond June 17. He noted that his administration would require extra time to find a successor who was backed by everyone. Alley suggested that the military should retreat back to the barracks at Camp Ghezo and leave Dahomeyan politics to the career politicians. <b>The</b> <b>view</b> <b>was</b> unpopular, and he was outvoted by his military comrades. Alley eventually became little more than Kouandété's mouthpiece.|$|E
5|$|Nearly {{a decade}} after the Tagora had ceased production, the view of the car in the {{automotive}} press was that it was merely average though there was little actively wrong with the car. <b>The</b> <b>view</b> <b>was</b> that the Tagora had the advantage of refinement, good manners and, in V6 form, good performance. Rust was identified as the single biggest problem for the surviving cars, usually around the rear suspension mountings. Buckley suggested that the car might attain collectible status by 2003.|$|E
5|$|The {{engagement}} was confusing {{for both}} sides, and <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>was</b> soon obscured by gunpowder smoke. Many ships {{on both sides}} were badly damaged, and around 2,000 men killed or wounded. Towards the end, a squadron of Danish ships met up with Dutch and escorted them into the harbor of Copenhagen. The Swedish fleet had failed; much-needed reinforcements and supplies had reached the beleaguered Danish town. The combined Danish and Dutch fleet now had control of the seas, forcing the Swedish fleet to seek refuge in the harbor of Landskrona on the Swedish mainland.|$|E

5|$|The exact {{placement}} of the genus Triceratops within the ceratopsid group has been debated by paleontologists. Two species, T. horridus and T. prorsus, are considered valid, although many other species have been named. Research published in 2010 suggested that the contemporaneous Torosaurus, a ceratopsid long regarded as a separate genus, represents Triceratops in its mature form. <b>The</b> <b>view</b> <b>was</b> immediately disputed. Retrieved July 29, 2013 from http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-17192624 and examination of more fossil evidence is expected to settle the debate.|$|E
5|$|There {{was little}} warning in New Richmond. The tornado was {{completely}} illuminated by lightning, {{but it was}} visible {{for only a few}} minutes before it reached the town, as <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>was</b> largely obstructed by buildings and large trees. Initially, several of the town's residents recalled hearing a faint rumble in the distance which many mistook for the sound of a passing train. Before long the tornado became more visible, and those who did come to realize the danger approaching began to alert those around them, and panic ensued in the streets as people scrambled to take shelter. Despite the best efforts of the storm's early spotters, a great many of the town's residents were not fully aware of the oncoming storm until it was almost upon them. Shortly after 6 PM, the tornado tore into the southwest corner of the city. This neighborhood was where many of the town's wealthiest and most influential residents lived, many of them having first come to the area as pioneers from New England in the 1850s. They included the owners of some of New Richmond's most prominent businesses, residing in stately homes built in styles derived from those seen back east. Within a few moments, as many as fifty homes were leveled in this area.|$|E

25|$|The exact motives behind Hardy's {{actions were}} {{questioned}} {{at the time}} by Griffith and later by historians of the period. The initial reports from the time in Irish newspapers portray Hardy simply as a career criminal and a rogue recruited by the British government to gain access and information on Collins and Sinn Féin. <b>The</b> <b>view</b> <b>was</b> one-sided in Ireland and across the Atlantic where reports aired which portrayed the incident as a countered threat {{on the lives of}} prominent Irish Republicans which was simply motivated by Hardy's potential share in the £40,000 reward for Collins' capture.

25|$|There {{were also}} {{concerns}} that the earlier drafts of the bill phrased clause 8, which listed the unacceptable conduct which could {{be subject to a}} restraining order, in broad and subjective terms.

It was suggested that this clause should be phrased to suggest that the objective view of a reasonable person would be the standard adopted.|$|E
25|$|The classic view of Cabinet Government {{was laid}} out by Walter Bagehot in The English Constitution (1867) in which he {{described}} the prime minister as the primus‐inter‐pares ("first among equals"). <b>The</b> <b>view</b> <b>was</b> questioned by Richard Crossman in The Myths of Cabinet Government (1972) and by Tony Benn. They were both members of the Labour governments of the 1960s and thought that {{the position of the}} Prime Minister had acquired more power so that Prime Ministerial Government was a more apt description. Crossman stated that the increase the power of the prime minister resulted from power of centralised political parties, the development of a unified civil service, and the grown of the Prime Minister's private office and Cabinet secretariat. Graham Allen (a Government Whip during Tony Blair's first government) made the case in The Last Prime Minister: Being Honest About the UK Presidency (2003) that in fact the office of prime minister has presidential powers, as did the political scientist Michael Foley in The British Presidency (2000).|$|E

25|$|Today modern Egyptologists {{evaluate}} Herodotus's and Diodorus's {{stories as}} some sort of defamation, based on both author's contemporary philosophy. Oversized tombs such as the Giza-pyramids must have appalled the Greeks and even the later priests of the New Kingdom, because they surely remembered the heretic pharaoh Akhenaten and his megalomaniac building projects. This extremely negative picture was obviously projected onto Khafra and his daunting pyramid. <b>The</b> <b>view</b> <b>was</b> possibly promoted by the fact, that during Khafra's lifetime the permission of the creation of oversized statues made of precious stone and their displaying at open places in public was limited to the king only. At their lifetime, the Greek authors and mortuary priests and temple priests couldn't explain the impressive monuments and statues of Khafra better than {{as the result of a}} megalomaniac character. These views and resulting stories were avidly snapped up by the Greek historians and so they made their also negative evaluations about Khafra, since scandalous stories were easier to sell to the public than positive (and therefore boring) tales.|$|E
25|$|The {{garden was}} located behind the house, {{or on the}} {{southern}} side. The garden was grown above a man-made level platform where {{there used to be}} a hill, and was exactly one acre (about 4000sqm) in area. A gravel path runs from the back of the house to the southern edge, and was twelve feet (3.7m) wide during Mason's time period, the same width as the central passage in the house and the portico. Today, the path is narrower, crowded by boxwoods that are now about 250 years old. The path ends in an overlook extending out from the steep edge of the garden. From here, the Potomac river can be seen. The Gunston Hall museum website says that <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>was</b> more impressive during Mason's time, when the trees were cleared. The garden was most likely broken into four rectangles, with additional gravel paths running through and around it. To give the illusion from the house of all rectangles being the same size, the rectangles closer to the house were probably shorter than the rectangles farther away.|$|E
25|$|As the {{psychiatrist}} Jan Ehrenwald has pointed out, {{the question as}} to how a possibly mentally ill Hitler could have gained millions of enthusiastic followers who supported his policies until 1945 has often been neglected. Daniel Goldhagen argued in 1996 that Hitler's political ascent was not in any way related to his psychopathology, but rather was a consequence of the precarious social conditions that existed at that time in Germany. On the other hand, some authors have noted that figures such as Charles Manson and Jim Jones, who have been described as suffering from crippling mental illness such as schizophrenia, nonetheless succeeded in having a tremendous influence on their groups of followers. Early on, <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>was</b> also expressed that Hitler was able to handle his psychopathology skillfully, and was aware of how he could use his symptoms to effectively steer the emotions of his audience. Still other authors have suggested that Hitler's followers themselves were mentally disturbed; evidence for this claim however was not produced. The question how Hitler's individual psychopathology might have been linked with the enthusiasm of his followers was first discussed in 2000 by the interdisciplinary team of authors Matussek/Matussek/Marbach.|$|E

25|$|On Friday morning, February 23, 1945, {{four days}} after the Marines landed at Iwo Jima, Rosenthal was making his daily visit to the island on a Marine landing craft when he heard that an American flag was being raised atop Mount Suribachi, a volcano at the {{southern}} tip of the island. Upon landing, Rosenthal hurried toward Suribachi, lugging along his bulky Speed Graphic camera, the standard for press photographers at the time. Together with Marine combat still photographer Pvt. Bob Campbell and Marine color movie photographer Sgt. Bill Genaust, he began the climb up to the summit of Mount Suribachi. When they got about halfway up, they met Staff Sgt. Louis Lowery, a photographer with the Marine publication “Leatherneck” who was coming down the volcano after an enemy grenade explosion on top had knocked him off his feet and broke his camera. Lowery told them that the flag had already been raised at 10:40 am, and he had gotten photos of the flag on the summit. Lowery told them <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>was</b> good from the summit, and Rosenthal convinced Genaust and Campbell to continue {{to take him to the}} top with them since they were armed.|$|E
25|$|Today Egyptologists {{evaluate}} Herodotus's and Diodorus's {{stories as}} some sort of defamation, based on both authors' contemporary philosophy. They also call for caution against the credibility of the ancient traditions. They argue that the classical authors lived around 2000 years after Khufu and their sources that were available in their lifetimes surely were antiquated. Additionally the Egyptologists point out that the philosophies of the ancient Egyptians had completely changed since the Old Kingdom. Oversized tombs such as the Giza pyramids must have appalled the Greeks and even the later priests of the New Kingdom, because they surely remembered the heretic pharaoh Akhenaten and his megalomaniac building projects. This extremely negative picture was obviously projected onto Khufu and his pyramid. <b>The</b> <b>view</b> <b>was</b> possibly promoted by the fact that during Khufu's lifetime, permission for the creation of oversized statues made of precious stone and their displaying in public was limited to the king only.

25|$|While {{the season}} was over in the Champions League, Neptūnas went on a win streak in the LKL, {{climbing}} up the standings. They finished the regular season in fourth seed with 21 victories and 15 defeats balance. During the 2016–17 LKL Playoffs quarter-final Neptūnas eliminated Juventus Utena 3–0, and advanced into the semi-finals where they faced Lithuanian champions Žalgiris Kaunas. Game 1 of the series did not provide much intrigue in Kaunas, with Žalgiris desperately crushing Neptūnas 83–54. <b>The</b> <b>view</b> <b>was</b> completely different during Game 2 in Klaipėda where Neptūnas defeated Žalgiris 73–70 to even the series 1–1. In Kaunas, Žalgiris won again, 83:60 and finished the series in Klaipėda, where Neptūnas lost the game 53:69 and the series 1-3. During the LKL bronze final Neptūnas faced Lietuvos rytas Vilnius for the intense series. Both teams successfully defended their home courts with Neptūnas losing the opening game on May 29, 2017 in Vilnius 79–60, but revening 83–70 on June 1 in Klaipėda. Later the series continued {{in the same order}} with Lietuvos rytas defeating Neptūnas 71–54 {{for the second time in}} Vilnius on June 4, and Neptūnas doing the same 70–65 in Klaipėda on June 7 to force the Game 5 of the series. Neptūnas lost the series on June 10 in Vilnius after losing the crucial game 75–66 and the series 3–2, mostly because of two former Neptūnas players Jimmy Baron and Deividas Gailius who combined for more than a half of Rytas' points (39). A very promising season at the beginning ended on a very disappointing note.|$|E
