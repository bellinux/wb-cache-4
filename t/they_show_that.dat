These include Cajal bodies, Gemini of coiled bodies, polymorphic interphase karyosomal association (PIKA), promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) bodies, paraspeckles, and splicing speckles. Although little is known about a number of these domains, they are significant in that <b>they</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> the nucleoplasm is not a uniform mixture, but rather contains organized functional subdomains.|$|E
5|$|Bina Agarwal and Pradeep Panda {{illustrate}} that a woman's property status (such as owning {{a house or}} land) directly and significantly reduces her chances of experiencing domestic violence, while employment makes little difference. They argue that such immovable property increases women's self-esteem, economic security, and strengthens their fall-back positions, enhancing their options and bargaining clout. <b>They</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> property ownership is an important contributor to women's economic well-being because it reduces their susceptibility to violence.|$|E

Computational geometry researchers have also provided algorithms for listing all pointed pseudotriangulations of a point set in a small amount of time per pseudotriangulation.|$|E
25|$|Tension-type {{headaches}} {{can usually}} be managed with NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen), acetaminophen or aspirin. Triptans are not helpful in tension-type headaches unless the person also has migraines. For chronic tension type headaches, amitriptyline is the only medication proven to help. Amitriptyline is a medication which treats depression and also independently treats pain. It works by blocking the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine, and also reduces muscle tenderness by a separate mechanism. Studies evaluating acupuncture for tension-type headaches have been mixed. Overall, <b>they</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> acupuncture is probably not helpful for tension-type headaches.|$|E

Because light from hydrogen atoms in distant galaxies may reach the earth after having traveled across space for billions of years, in effect one can do such observations covering periods of time almost {{all the way back to}} the Big Bang, and <b>they</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> the laws of physics have always been the same.|$|E

25|$|In 2011, Francesco Solinas {{discovered}} of {{a collection}} of thirty-six letters, dating from about 1616 to 1620, that provide new insight into Gentileschi’s personal and financial life in Florence. Most unexpectedly, <b>they</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> she had a passionate love affair with a wealthy Florentine nobleman named Francesco Maria Maringhi. Curiously, her husband, Stiattesi, was well aware of their relationship, and maintained a correspondence with Maringhi on the back of Artemisia’s love letters. Nevertheless, he tolerated it, presumably because Maringhi was a powerful ally who provided the couple financial support. However, by 1620, rumors of the affair had begun to spread in the Florentine court, and this fact, combined with ongoing financial and legal problems, led them to resettle in Rome.|$|E

With the help of motherships that include captured fishing and merchant vessels, the operating range of the skiffs has been increased far into the Indian Ocean. An attacked vessel is approached from quarter or stern; RPGs and small arms are used to intimidate the operator {{to slow down and}} allow boarding. Light ladders are brought along to climb aboard. Pirates then will try to get control of the bridge to take operational control of the vessel.|$|E
