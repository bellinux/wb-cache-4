Its heel was heavy and might serve for a mallet, {{and holding the}} blade of my knife on the <b>top</b> <b>strand</b> close against a post, I smote it furiously. The wire was not nicked half through when it burst beneath the pressure, and a barb on its flying end scored my face so that the blood trickled into my mouth and eyes; but the next wire was of treble twist, and as I struck and choked I regretted the {{thoroughness}} with which we had built the fence. The knife chipped under the blows I rained upon it, and when I shortened the blade its end snapped off. In a fit of desperation I seized the lacerating wires with my naked fingers and tore at them frenziedly, but what {{the pressure on the}} other side failed to accomplish the strength of twenty men might not do, so when in a few seconds reason returned to me I picked up what remained of the knife and set to work again. There was still no sign of Thorn, and as the wires did not slacken it was plain that Steel had failed to loose the straining screws without convenient tools. Three slender cords of steel alone pent in the stock that were to set me free of debt, but I had no implements with which to break them, so they also held me fast to be dragged down helpless to beggary.|$|E

30|$|One further point {{warrants}} further discussion. It {{is possible}} that the <b>top</b> <b>strand’s</b> upstream double strand break may be attributable to the activity of L 1 endonuclease (Gasior et al. 2006). Were this to be the case, this could predict an active role for L 1 -mediated retrotransposition in creating large genomic deletions. It should however be emphasised that the L 1 endonuclease used to generate the <b>top</b> <b>strand’s</b> upstream double strand break may not necessarily be the same as that used to create the bottom strand’s first nick (Mine et al. 2007), by analogy to the proposition that two different L 1 RT molecules may be used for twin-priming, leading to L 1 inversion (Ostertag and Kazazian 2001 b). It is equally possible that the <b>top</b> <b>strand’s</b> upstream double strand break was created independently of L 1 endonuclease. Were this to be the case, “a fascinating scenario would present itself: the organism could have ‘hijacked’ the L 1 machinery to repair an existing double strand break through a mechanism akin to single strand annealing.” (Chen et al. 2005). In this particular context, L 1 integration may represent a ‘host/parasite battleground’ as it has been termed by Gilbert et al. (2005), in which L 1 integration finds itself in a ‘race’ to complete cDNA synthesis before being ‘hijacked’ to patch an upstream double strand break.|$|R

40|$|Lambda {{site-specific}} recombination proceeds {{by a pair}} of sequential strand exchanges that first generate and then resolve a Holliday junction intermediate. A family of synthetic Holliday junctions with the branch point constrained {{to the center of the}} 7 bp overlap region was used to show that resolution of the <b>top</b> <b>strands</b> and resolution of the bottom strands are symmetrical but stereochemically distinct processes. Lambda integrase is sensitive to isomeric structure, preferentially resolving the pair of strands that are crossed in the protein-free Holliday junction. At the branch point of stacked immobile Holliday junctions, the number of purines is preferentially maximized in the crossed (versus continuous) strands if there is an inequality of purines between strands of opposite polarity. This stacking preference was used to anticipate the resolution bias of freely mobile junctions and thereby to reinforce the conclusions with monomobile junctions. The results provide a strong indication that in the complete recombination reaction a restacking of helices occurs between the <b>top</b> and bottom <b>strand</b> exchanges...|$|R

40|$|Pretensioned girders {{have been}} {{commonly}} used in bridge construction for years. However, some problems remain that hinder the further application of longer and more heavily prestressed girders. The prestressing force can produce large stresses at both {{the top and bottom}} surfaces of the girders, especially near the ends where self-weight moments are minimal. Additionally, the transfer of large prestressing forces can cause local cracking. Partial debonding of straight strands, harping <b>strands</b> and/or adding <b>top</b> <b>strands</b> are three common approaches to mitigating such problems. However, harping is limited to those strands aligned with the member web, and adding <b>top</b> <b>strands</b> affects the overall stress state of the section. Comparatively, partial debonding is a simple and preferred approach. The total prestress force is introduced to the member gradually, reducing stress concentrations and associated end-region cracking. 	Even so, partial debonding decreases the longitudinal tension capacity particularly when a large number of strands is debonded. Excessive debonding, therefore, can also have detrimental effects of the flexure and shear capacity of the girder. This thesis aims to quantify the effects of partial debonding on initial girder stresses and ultimate girder capacity in an effort to identify acceptable prestressing strand debonding details. 	Two series of AASHTO Type III-VI girders having varying spans, amounts of prestressing and different debonding ratios are systematically analysed for their adherence and consistency with present AASHTO LRFD Specification requirements. The analyses use a purpose-written MATLAB program. Analytically obtained girder capacities are validated with initial design capacities from the PCI Bridge Design Manual. An individual case is presented in order to illustrate the analysis procedure. From this study, acceptable partial debonding ranges, satisfying AASHTO-prescribed stress limits, are obtained. 	Conclusions indicate that the upper limit for an acceptable debonding ratio may be increased from the AASHTO-prescribed 25...|$|R
40|$|Xer {{site-specific}} recombination in Escherichia coli converts plasmid multimers to monomers, thereby ensuring their correct segregation at cell division. Xer recombination at the psi site of plasmid pSC 101 is preferentially intramolecular, giving products {{of a single}} topology. This intramolecular selectivity is imposed by accessory proteins, which bind at psi accessory sequences and activate Xer recombination at the psi core. Strand exchange proceeds sequentially within the psi core; XerC first exchanges <b>top</b> <b>strands</b> to produce Holliday junctions, then XerD exchanges bottom strands to give final products. In this study, recombination was analysed at sites in which the psi core was inverted {{with respect to the}} accessory sequences. A plasmid containing two inverted-core psi sites recombined with a reversed order of strand exchange, but with unchanged product topology. Thus the architecture of the synapse, formed by accessory proteins binding to accessory sequences, determines the order of strand exchange at psi. This finding has important implications for the way in which accessory proteins interact with the recombinases...|$|R

We tested the ability of IntDOT to cleave and ligate activated attDOT substrates in the presence of mismatches. Unlike other tyrosine recombinases, the results revealed that IntDOT is able to perform ligation reactions even when all the bases within the crossover region are mispaired. We also show that there is a strong bias in the order of strand exchanges during integrative recombination. The <b>top</b> <b>strands</b> are exchanged first in reactions that appear to require 2 bp of homology between the partner sites adjacent to the sites of cleavage.

50|$|This {{method has}} been shown to {{generate}} chimeric gene libraries with an average of 14 crossovers per chimeric gene.

The uracil containing template is then removed from the heteroduplex by treatment with a uracil DNA glcosylase, followed by further amplification using PCR. This method is advantageous because it generates chimeras with relatively high crossover frequency. However it is somewhat limited due to the complexity and the need for generation of single stranded DNA and uracil containing single stranded template DNA.|$|E
40|$|I-SceI is a homing {{endonuclease}} {{that specifically}} cleaves an 18 -bp double-stranded DNA. I-SceI exhibits a strong preference for cleaving the bottom strand DNA. The published structure of I-SceI bound to an uncleaved DNA substrate provided {{a mechanism for}} bottom strand cleavage but not for <b>top</b> <b>strand</b> cleavage. To more fully elucidate the I-SceI catalytic mechanism, we determined the X-ray structures of I-SceI in complex with DNA substrates that are nicked in either the top or bottom strands. The structures resemble intermediates along the DNA cleavage reaction. In a structure containing a nick in the <b>top</b> <b>strand,</b> the spatial arrangement of metal ions {{is similar to that}} observed in the structure that contains uncleaved DNA, suggesting that cleavage of the bottom strand occurs by a common mechanism regardless of whether this strand is cleaved first or second. In the structure containing a nick in the bottom strand, a new metal binding site is present in the active site that cleaves the <b>top</b> <b>strand.</b> This new metal and a candidate nucleophilic water molecule are correctly positioned to cleave the <b>top</b> <b>strand</b> following bottom strand cleavage, providing a plausible mechanism for <b>top</b> <b>strand</b> cleavage...|$|E
40|$|Unlike other {{restriction}} enzymes, BfiI functions without metal ions. It recognizes an asymmetric DNA sequence, 5 ′-ACTGGG- 3 ′, {{and cuts}} {{top and bottom}} strands at fixed positions downstream of this sequence. Many restriction enzymes are dimers of identical subunits, with one active site for each DNA strand. Others, like FokI, dimerize transiently during catalysis. BfiI is also a dimer but it has only one active site, at the dimer interface. We show here that BfiI remains a dimer as it makes double-strand breaks in DNA and that its single active site acts sequentially, first {{on the bottom and}} then the <b>top</b> <b>strand.</b> Hence, after cutting the bottom strand, a rearrangement of either the protein and/or the DNA in the BfiI–DNA complex must switch the active site to the <b>top</b> <b>strand.</b> Low pH values selectively block top-strand cleavage, converting BfiI into a nicking enzyme that cleaves only the bottom strand. The switch to the <b>top</b> <b>strand</b> may depend on the ionization of the cleaved 5 ′ phosphate in the bottom strand. BfiI thus uses a mechanism for making double-strand breaks that is novel among restriction enzymes...|$|E

40|$|Many {{restriction}} endonucleases are dimers {{that act}} symmetrically at palindromic DNA sequences, with each active site cutting one strand.

To cut both strands, the monomer at the site recruits a second monomer from solution, {{but it is not}} yet known which DNA strand is cut by the monomer bound to the site and which by the recruited monomer. In this work, mutants of FokI were used to show that the monomer bound to the site made the distal cut in the bottom strand, whilst the recruited monomer made in parallel the proximal cut in the <b>top</b> <b>strand.</b> Procedures were also established to direct FokI activity, either preferentially to the bottom strand or exclusively to the <b>top</b> <b>strand.</b> The latter extends the range of enzymes for nicking specified strands at specific sequences, and may facilitate further applications of FokI in gene targeting...|$|E
40|$|MmeI is {{an unusual}} Type II {{restriction}} enzyme that is useful for generating long sequence tags. We have cloned the MmeI restriction-modification (R-M) system and found it to consist of a single protein having both endonuclease and DNA methyltransferase activities. The protein comprises an amino-terminal endonuclease domain, a central DNA methyltransferase domain and C-terminal DNA recognition domain. The endonuclease cuts the two DNA strands at one site simultaneously, with enzyme bound at two sites interacting to accomplish scission. Cleavage occurs more rapidly than methyl transfer on unmodified DNA. MmeI modifies only the adenine in the <b>top</b> <b>strand,</b> 5 ′-TCCRAC- 3 ′. MmeI endonuclease activity is blocked by this <b>top</b> <b>strand</b> adenine methylation and is unaffected by methylation of the adenine in the complementary strand, 5 ′-GTYGGA- 3 ′. There is no additional DNA modification associated with the MmeI R-M system, as is required for previously characterized Type IIG R-M systems. The MmeI R-M system thus uses modification on {{only one of the}} two DNA strands for host protection. The MmeI architecture represents a minimal approach to assembling a restriction-modification system wherein a single DNA recognition domain targets both the endonuclease and DNA methyltransferase activities...|$|E
40|$|The Type IIS {{restriction}} endonuclease BtsI recognizes and digests at GCAGTG(2 / 0). It comprises two subunits: BtsIA and BtsIB.

BtsIA has the rest of the catalytic domain that is responsible for the DNA <b>top</b> <b>strand</b> nicking. BtsIA alone has no activity unless it mixes with BtsIB to reconstitute the BtsI activity. During characterization of the enzyme, we identified a BtsIB mutant R 119 A found to have a different digestion pattern from the wild type BtsI. After characterization, we found that BtsIB(R 119 A) is a novel restriction enzyme with a previously unreported recognition sequence CAGTG(2 / 0), which is named as BtsI- 1. Compared with wild type BtsI, BtsI- 1 showed different relative activities in NEB restriction enzyme reaction buffers NEB 1, NEB 2, NEB 3 and NEB 4 and less star activity.

40|$|In Escherichia coli K- 12, the {{repression}} of tyrP requires the binding of the TyrR protein to the operator {{in the presence of}} coeffectors, tyrosine and ATP. This operator contains two 22 -bp palindromic sequences which are termed TyrR boxes. Methylation, uracil, and ethylation interference experiments were used to identify the important sites in the TyrR boxes that make contacts with the TyrR protein. Methylation interference studies demonstrated that guanines at positions + 8, - 5, and - 8 of the strong TyrR box and positions + 8, - 4, and - 8 of the weak box are close to the TyrR protein. Uracil interference revealed that strong van der Waals contacts are made by the thymines at position - 7 and + 5 of the <b>top</b> <b>strands</b> of both strong and weak boxes and that weaker contacts are made by the thymines at positions + 7 (strong box) and - 5 and + 7 (weak box) of the bottom strand. In addition, ethylation interference suggested that the phosphate backbone contacts are located at the end and central regions of the palindrome. These findings are supported by our results derived from studies of symmetrical mutations of the tyrP strong box. Overall, the results confirm the critical importance of the invariant (G x C) (C x G) 8 base pairs for TyrR recognition and also indicate that interactions with (T x A) (A x T) 7 are of major importance. In contrast, mutations in other positions result in weaker effects on the binding affinity of TyrR protein, indicating that these positions play a lesser role in TyrR protein recognition.

Here we present an example in which changing the oligomerization state of an enzyme changes its function. Type IIs restriction endonucleases such as AlwI usually fold into two separate domains: a DNA-binding domain and a catalytic/dimerization domain. We have swapped the putative dimerization domain of AlwI with a nonfunctional dimerization domain from a nicking enzyme, N. BstNBI. The resulting chimeric enzyme, N. AlwI, no longer forms a dimer. Interestingly, the monomeric N. AlwI still recognizes the same sequence as AlwI but only cleaves the DNA strand containing the sequence 5 ′-GGATC- 3 ′ (<b>top</b> <b>strand).</b> In contrast, the wild-type AlwI exists as a dimer in solution and cleaves two DNA strands; the <b>top</b> <b>strand</b> is cleaved by an enzyme binding to that sequence, and its complementary bottom strand is cleaved by the second enzyme dimerized with the first enzyme. N. AlwI is unable to form a dimer and therefore nicks DNA as a monomer. In addition, the engineered nicking enzyme {{is at least as}} active as the wild-type AlwI and is thus a useful enzyme.

The rev gene constructed by this method was found to contain 4 sequence errors, which were subsequently corrected by site-directed mutagenesis. In order to evaluate the source of sequence errors, several nef genes were made from the <b>top</b> and bottom <b>strand</b> DNA synthesis solutions using independent PCR's.

The politeness hypothesis states that purine-loading prevents distracting RNA–RNA interactions and excessive formation of double-stranded RNA, which might trigger various intracellular alarms. Because RNA–RNA interactions have a distinct entropy-driven component, the pressure for the evolution of purine-loading might be greater in organisms living at high temperatures. In support of this, we find that Chargaff differences (a measure of purine-loading) are greater in thermophiles than in nonthermophiles and extend to both purine bases. In thermophiles the pressure to purine-load affects codon choice, indicating that some features of their amino acid composition (e. g., high levels of glutamic acid) might reflect purine-loading pressure (i. e., constraints on mRNA) rather than direct constraints on protein structure and function...|$|R
