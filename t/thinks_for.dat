500|$|Even so, {{the narrator}} pulls his chair {{directly}} in front of the raven, determined to learn more about it. He <b>thinks</b> <b>for</b> a moment in silence, and his mind wanders back to his lost Lenore. He thinks the air grows denser and feels the presence of angels, and wonders if God is sending him a sign that he is to forget Lenore. [...] The bird again replies in the negative, suggesting that he can never be free of his memories. [...] The narrator becomes angry, calling the raven a [...] "thing of evil" [...] and a [...] "prophet". Finally, he asks the raven whether he will be reunited with Lenore in Heaven. When the raven responds with its typical [...] "Nevermore", he is enraged, and, calling it a liar, commands the bird to return to the [...] "Plutonian shore"—but it does not move. Presumably at the time of the poem's recitation by the narrator, the raven [...] "still is sitting" [...] on the bust of Pallas. The narrator's final admission is that his soul is trapped beneath the raven's shadow and shall be lifted [...] "Nevermore".|$|E
500|$|Reviewers {{praised the}} work as [...] "entertaining, {{thoughtful}} and eminently readable", although some thought it was too mournful in places. Separating Shelley's travel memoir from the new guidebooks and handbooks, reviews such as that from the Atlas, praised her [...] "rich fancy, her intense love of nature, and her sensitive apprehension {{of all that is}} good, and beautiful and free". They praised its independence of thought, wit, and feeling. Shelley's commentary on the social and political life of Italy, which was generally thought superior to the German sections, caused one reviewer to call the book the work of [...] "a woman who <b>thinks</b> <b>for</b> herself on all subjects, and who dares to say what she thinks", a woman with a [...] "masculine and original mind". Not all reviewers celebrated her independence of mind. The Observer wrote: [...] "With her, as with all women, politics is a matter of the heart, and not as with the more robust nature of man, of the head... It is an idle and unprofitable theme for a woman." [...] Most of the reviews responded positively to Shelley's political aims; those that were unsympathetic to her political position generally disputed her specific claims. For example, one reviewer claimed that Italy had been improved by Austrian rule.|$|E

2500|$|The harsh {{treatment}} {{he received}} from the Pharisees was due to his having deserted their ranks at such a critical time. Quite in harmony with this supposition are the other sins laid to his charge; namely, that he rode in an ostentatious manner {{through the streets of}} Jerusalem on a Day of Atonement which fell upon a Sabbath, and that he was bold enough to overstep the [...] "teḥum" [...] (the limits of the Sabbath-day journey). Both the Jerusalem and the Babylonian Talmuds agree here, and cite this as proof that Elisha turned from Pharisaism to heresy. It was just such non-observance of customs that excited the anger of Akiva (Sotah 27b). The Jewish Encyclopedia writes that the mention of the [...] "Holy of Holies" [...] in this passage is not an anachronism, as Grätz <b>thinks,</b> <b>for</b> {{while it is true that}} Eliezer and Joshua were present as the geonim par excellence at Elisha's circumcisionwhich must, therefore, have occurred after the death of Johanan ben Zakkai (80)it is also true that the [...] "Holy of Holies" [...] is likewise mentioned in connection with Rabbi Akiva (Makkot, end); indeed, the use of this expression is due to the fact that the Rabbis held holiness to be inherent in the place, not in the building (Yevamot 6b).|$|E

In his first such report, published on May 20, 1917, Emory wrote, [...] "One coming to camp is struck, instantly, by the type of men Uncle Sam has taken under his care for the next three months, and to whom he will entrust the training of the first army of 500,000. There are quite a number of men between the ages of 30 and 40, but the great majority are from 20 to 30. They are all fine, upstanding fellows, and most of them have had college educations. Many of the men are married and many were doing well in civil life before coming here.

2500|$|The Emperor Altoum, {{father of}} Turandot, {{sits on his}} grand throne in his palace. Weary of having to judge his {{isolated}} daughter's sport, he urges the Prince to withdraw his challenge, but the Prince refuses (Aria – Altoum, the Prince: Un giuramento atroce – [...] "An atrocious oath"). Turandot enters and explains (In questa reggia – [...] "In this palace") that her ancestress of millennia past, Princess Lo-u-Ling, reigned over her kingdom [...] "in silence and joy, resisting the harsh domination of men" [...] until she was ravished and murdered by an invading foreign prince. Turandot claims that Lo-u-Ling now lives in her, and out of revenge, Turandot has sworn to never let any man wed her. She warns the Prince to withdraw but again he refuses. The Princess presents her first riddle: Straniero, ascolta! – [...] "What is born each night and dies each dawn?" [...] The Prince correctly replies, Speranza – [...] "Hope." [...] The Princess, unnerved, presents her second riddle (Guizza al pari di fiamma – [...] "What flickers red and warm like a flame, but is not fire?") The Prince <b>thinks</b> <b>for</b> a moment before replying, Sangue – [...] "Blood". Turandot is shaken. The crowd cheers the Prince, provoking Turandot's anger. She presents her third riddle (Gelo che ti da foco – [...] "What is ice which gives you fire and which your fire freezes still more?"). As the prince thinks, Turandot taunts him, [...] "What is the ice that makes you burn?" [...] The taunt makes him see the answer and he proclaims, [...] "It is Turandot! Turandot!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Denisof complimented {{the season}} three Angel episode [...] "Billy", in which Wesley tries to murder Fred after {{becoming}} supernaturally misogynous, [...] "because {{it was the}} first real dark change in Wesley to experiment with". Discussing Wesley's betrayal of his friends to protect Angel's baby, Denisof explains, It isn't that he's purely bad or purely good, we're discovering a deeper and more complicated area of the character where good and bad aren't as clear, where Wesley does something motivated, he <b>thinks,</b> <b>for</b> the good of all [...] i.e. saving Connor and relieving Angel of the responsibility of murdering his son [...] and in doing so creates the situation in which the baby could be kidnapped, Angel loses his son and Wesley has his throat slit for the trouble. So it's grey rather than black or white. Science fiction magazine Starburst said that [...] "somber, subdued, bearded Wesley is worlds away from the foolish, pompous Wesley". Denisof says of the period, [...] "It was a great opportunity to explore some of the character's darker layers. You couldn't have predicted it when he arrived in Sunnydale. This was an important element to introduce and explore, to be consistent with the show and to continue the organic exploration of all the characters." [...] Whilst the character spent less time with his old friends, Denisof was [...] "more or less isolated from the , barring one or two scenes of mild confrontation when they would come to visit me and we'd chew each other out. There's definitely a cold war going on with Wesley versus the world." [...] Wesley's dark attitude is alleviated somewhat when the gang decide to take over Wolfram & Hart. The tension between Wesley and his co-workers did not go away because of the mind-wipe but because [...] "we decided we were better off as a team than as separate entities. And we had to put our differences behind us and build our trust again as a group." [...] Discussing the way Wesley's English accent softens over the course of Angel, Denisof says, [...] just sits on him better. As an actor, it just felt that organically the way he was changing, and it also seemed to be accurate when you consider the amount of time he's spent in L.A. that the accent could have softened. And since he isn't surrounded by upper-crust academics as he was as a young Watcher in the Academy in England, it's understandable that he is changing the way he speaks and changing his voice, his delivery, {{as a result of his}} environment.|$|E
