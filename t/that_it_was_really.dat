He sees old photographs, including one of himself as a child on Christmas morning, where he thinks his father was not even there when he finally got to meet Santa Claus. Homer then realizes <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> his father in a Santa costume, proving that Grampa did actually care for him. Homer quickly reunites with Grampa, who by coincidence has also gone to the farmhouse to reflect. They both admit they are screw-ups – since they both caused separate fires in the farmhouse – and they finally reconcile.|$|E
5|$|Although the IUCN {{lists the}} Rodrigues {{solitaire}} as going extinct by 1778, the species probably became extinct some {{time between the}} 1730s and 1760s; the exact date is unknown. Its disappearance coincided with the tortoise trade between 1730 and 1750, when traders burnt off vegetation, hunted solitaires, and released cats and pigs that preyed on eggs and chicks. In 1755, Joseph-François Charpentier de Cossigny attempted to obtain a live specimen, {{as he had been}} assured the Rodrigues solitaire still survived in remote areas of the island. After searching for 18 months and offering large rewards, he could find none. He noted that cats were blamed for decimating the species, but suspected <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> due to hunting by humans. When he visited Rodrigues to observe the 1761 transit of Venus, Alexandre Guy Pingré encountered no solitaires, although he had been assured that they survived.|$|E

Harry Belafonte {{declined}} to play Porgy {{in the late}} 1950s film version, so the role went to Sidney Poitier. Betty Allen, president of The Harlem School of the Arts, admittedly loathed the piece, and Grace Bumbry, who excelled in the 1985 Metropolitan Opera production as Bess, made the often cited statement: I thought it beneath me, I felt I had worked far too hard, that we had come far too far to have to retrogress to 1935. My {{way of dealing with}} it was to see <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> a piece of Americana, of American history, whether we liked it or not.

Rafoss (1890–1987) from Stavanger (Kvinesdal). Because his father was {{a gardener}} they had a car, which was rare at the time, and using this they went on skiing in the winter and fishing in the summer. He enjoyed going for long skiing tours in the mountains in Stavanger, when he was young, and several times he crossed Trollgaren in Ryfylke, this marvelous moraine that is appropriate to its name. He wondered how it was formed, and was told by the local farmer <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> Trolls that had set up the meandering fence of huge boulders, far above the tree line. The curiosity for this natural phenomenon in addition to many others in turn led to his interest for the Ice Age.|$|E

As a result, in February the division's headquarters were merged with the 4th Task Force's headquarters as the 3rd Division was redesignated as the [...] "3rd Division Field Force Group". At the same time, the position of formation commander was downgraded to the rank of brigadier rather than major general. This remained the case until April 1984 when the divisional headquarters was re-established.|$|E

During the third, he said he had spoken to Silcott about the murder, and that Silcott owned a hammer with a hook on one side. After the fifth interview he was charged with affray, and during the sixth he described the attack on Blakelock: [...] "It was like you see in a film, a helpless man with dogs on him.

500|$|Moreno was {{the only}} one to sign the decree that {{established}} the newspaper, but the text implies that it {{was the result of a}} discussion of the whole Junta, and not just his initiative. Fellow member of the Junta Manuel Alberti was appointed director of the newspaper. However, Alberti never actually directed the newspaper; Moreno did. Historian Guillermo Furlong considers <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> Alberti who directed the newspaper, but the memoirs of José Pedro Agrelo (a later director), Tomás Guido, and Saavedra confirm that the newspaper was managed by Moreno. Moreno has also been promoted as a supporter of the freedom of the press, but the Gazeta... was actually a state-sponsored newspaper, and the Junta allowed such freedom only for information that was not against the interests of the government. According to Norberto Galasso, that situation would today be [...] considered media bias.|$|E

However, by March 2007, Grint agreed to return for the last instalments. For financial and scripting reasons, the last book was divided into two films which were shot back to back, with filming concluding in June 2010. After completing the final film he said: [...] "I mean it literally has been my childhood and suddenly it all came down to really just one random scene, with us jumping through a fireplace, and then it was over.

At least she knows that she's {{a part of this}} family and this affects her. I think she serves as a really important character in these later episodes because Astrid is kind of the only person that isn't directly involved with everything that is still on his side.

It also adapts the chapter [...] "Jaime VI" [...] from A Feast for Crows. The title of the episode is in reference to a speech given by Septon Meribald, a character in the A Song of Ice and Fire series, who was also used to create the character of Ray. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Cogman stated, [...] "The speech itself didn't {{make it into the}} episode, but it inspired the character and some of his dialogue. So the title of the episode is a nod to that speech." [...] He compared it to the second season episode [...] "The Ghost of Harrenhal", whose title was also a reference to the books, but was not specifically stated in the episode. Ian McShane, who portrayed Ray, spoke about the writing in the episode in regards to his participation in the series, noting, [...] "they wrote a two-page speech – so that's why they invited me.

2500|$|Henry Morton Stanley {{had been}} sent to find him by the New York Herald {{newspaper}} in 1869. He found Livingstone in the town of Ujiji on the shores of Lake Tanganyika on 10 November 1871, greeting him with the now famous words [...] "Dr. Livingstone, I presume?" [...] Livingstone responded, [...] "Yes", and then [...] "I feel thankful that I am here to welcome you." [...] These famous words may have been a fabrication, as Stanley later tore out the pages of this encounter in his diary. Even Livingstone's account of this encounter does not mention these words. However, the phrase appears in a New York Herald editorial dated 10 August 1872, and the Encyclopædia Britannica and the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography both quote it without questioning its veracity. The words are famous because of their perceived humor, Livingstone being the only other white person for hundreds of miles. Stanley's book suggests <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> because of embarrassment, because he did not dare to embrace him.|$|E

The company has $306 million of debt and leases and intended to raise $120 million of new shares in the company and order seven new Q400 planes. However, after twice delaying the final deadline for the offering, and lowering its share price from between $6 and $7 per share to $5.50, Porter cancelled the initial public offering. According to Robert Deluce [...] "We came to the conclusion <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> prudent to defer the offering at this time and to wait until better market conditions existed.

When Peyton comes back home, she reveals to him that she did come to the signing, and then inspires him by repeating his quote: [...] "Your art matters". When he tells Peyton that the bartender she is flirting with at the Clothes Over Bros store opening {{is not good enough}} for her, it becomes obvious that, despite his relationship with Lindsey, he still loves Peyton. After remembering the night he proposed, he goes straight to her house, though she is not there. When Peyton begins to antagonize Lindsey, he goes to confront her, but things escalate into a verbal fight about their break up. A little bit later, after Peyton confesses her feelings and kisses him, he kisses her back, passionately, but later proposes to Lindsey, leading Peyton to tell him that she will bury her feelings so that he can be happy. He then wins his first game as the Ravens coach, although the female counterparts miss it because they were locked in the library. He soon has to go to Dan's parole and speak up in order to have him stay locked up. He decides to have Nathan as his best man and then fuses his bachelor party with Lindsey's. He also gives Haley his new book, and she tells him not to marry Lindsey after reading it. Lucas proceeds with the wedding, but Lindsey stops him after realizing his book is about Peyton. She leaves him, and when he chases after her, he sees Lindsey's bags packed. After a confrontation, she leaves him, saying, [...] "People always leave, Luke. You know that." [...] (A reference to one of Peyton's famous lines, also featured in his first book.) Lucas flees to stay with his mother and Andy after the failed wedding. Andy convinces Lucas to go after Lindsey, prompting him to go to her and tell her that one day she will come back to him. She comes back to Tree Hill for Jamie's 5th birthday, but tells Lucas <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> over. He then helps Brooke cope with having baby Angie around. After Lindsey calls him to tell him she is seeing someone, he blows up after an opposing player gets away with attempting to injure Quentin Fields, drawing himself a 10-game suspension. He becomes heavily drunk and tells Peyton he hates her when she comes to his help. He later apologizes to her after being confronted by Haley. He tells her that it was hard to let her go, hard to see her and that it remains difficult for him, making apparent his love for Peyton. Lindsey comes by to tell him his book is over and he can e-mail her the dedication. When he does, she reveals by phone that she still loves him. He then decides to go to Las Vegas and calls someone to get married. Brooke, Peyton, and Lindsey are all shown answering the phone, and the viewers are left hanging as to whom he decides to propose to.|$|E
