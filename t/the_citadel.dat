5|$|<b>The</b> <b>citadel</b> {{is located}} in the {{northwest}} corner of the old walled city of Damascus, between the Bab al-Faradis and the Bab al-Jabiyah. Whereas most medieval Arabic castles are located on prominent hilltops, <b>the</b> <b>citadel</b> of Damascus was built on flat ground at the same level {{as the rest of the}} city, a feature it shares with <b>the</b> <b>Citadel</b> of Bosra. The location of <b>the</b> <b>citadel</b> ensured that it could control the Barada River, which flows north of <b>the</b> <b>citadel.</b> The location of the river also offered protection against attack from that side of <b>the</b> <b>citadel.</b> The Nahr Aqrabani, a canal branching off the Barada, flowed immediately below the northern wall and provided additional protection. The dry moats on the other sides of <b>the</b> <b>citadel</b> could be filled from these streams. Another branch of the Barada, the Nahr Banyas, entered the city under <b>the</b> <b>citadel.</b> Hydraulic structures below that made control of the flow of water into Damascus possible from within <b>the</b> <b>citadel</b> were probably constructed under Al-Adil. <b>The</b> <b>citadel</b> was fully integrated into the defences of Damascus, with the city walls abutting <b>the</b> <b>citadel</b> on its southwest and northeast corners.|$|E
5|$|After the Mamluk defeat by the Ottoman army under Sultan Selim I in the Battle of Marj Dabiq in 1516, Damascus and <b>the</b> <b>citadel</b> {{surrendered}} peacefully to the Ottomans. Damascus {{was given}} to Janbirdi al-Ghazali, a Mamluk who had submitted to Selim I. When Selim I died in 1520, al-Ghazali revolted and took <b>the</b> <b>citadel.</b> He marched upon Aleppo to expand his realm, but had to retreat and was eventually defeated and killed {{in the vicinity of}} Damascus in 1521. Damascus again changed hands, to the Ottomans. From 1658 onward, <b>the</b> <b>citadel</b> was controlled by the Janissaries—Ottoman infantry units. In 1738 and in 1746, they were involved in conflicts with the governors of Damascus; the Janissaries temporarily lost control of <b>the</b> <b>citadel</b> in 1746. The north gate of <b>the</b> <b>citadel</b> collapsed in 1752, and sustained heavy damage due to a severe earthquake in 1759. According to contemporary accounts, both the western and southern walls collapsed, but the damage was quickly repaired in 1761.|$|E

5|$|At {{the heart}} of the Combine's command {{structure}} in Half-Life 2 is <b>the</b> <b>Citadel,</b> an enormous structure of Combine construction, reaching approximately 2.6 kilometres (1.6 miles) into the sky from ground level, and delving deep underground. Located within City 17, <b>the</b> <b>Citadel</b> serves as the primary headquarters of the Combine, housing both Combine Advisors and the office of the Earth administrator, Wallace Breen. Breen is frequently seen on large screens around the city from which he spreads propaganda. <b>The</b> <b>Citadel</b> projects an energy field that is able to prevent human reproduction, as well as a field that keeps dangerous alien wildlife out of the city. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>Citadel</b> contains a trans-dimensional teleporter which allows the Combine to travel between their native universe and Earth. <b>The</b> <b>Citadel</b> also contains construction facilities for various synthetic Combine combat machines.|$|E
5|$|By the 19th century, {{extensive}} docks {{had grown}} up around <b>the</b> <b>Citadel</b> and in 1802 the surrounding land was granted to the Hull Dock Company. <b>The</b> <b>Citadel</b> remained in military use until 1848, by when developments in military technology had made the fortification obsolete. In 1858 there were proposals to turn the site into a public park, but instead <b>the</b> <b>Citadel,</b> including Hull Castle and the South Blockhouse, was demolished in 1864 {{to make way for}} an expansion of the docks.|$|E
5|$|Finn and Jake {{grab hold}} of the {{captured}} Lich as he is transported to <b>the</b> <b>Citadel.</b> Once there, they discover a human figure encased in a crystal-like substance, who they conclude must be Finn's father. Meanwhile, the Lich uses his malevolent magic to begin melting <b>the</b> <b>Citadel</b> and turning its prisoners to his will. Finn's father, Martin (voiced by Stephen Root), is eventually freed by the Lich's actions, and as <b>the</b> <b>Citadel</b> guardians battle the escaping prisoners he, Finn, and Jake try to escape. One of <b>the</b> <b>Citadel</b> guardians, however, uses its laser and melts away part of Martin's flesh on his leg. Finn retrieves some guardian blood, which repairs and heals Martin. However, Finn starts to realize that his father is not the hero {{that he thought he}} would be.|$|E

5|$|French {{military}} forces occupied <b>the</b> <b>citadel</b> during the French Mandate period in Syria (1920–1946). During the Great Syrian Revolt in 1925, the French shelled Al-Hariqa, the area immediately {{south of the}} citadel—where Syrian rebels {{were supposed to be}} present—from positions in the hills {{to the north of the}} city, and from <b>the</b> <b>citadel</b> itself. This bombardment resulted in widespread destruction. After the French Mandate period, <b>the</b> <b>citadel</b> continued to serve as a prison and barracks until 1986.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{following}} Nur ad-Din's {{death in}} 1174, Damascus {{was seized by}} Saladin, the Ayyubid sultan of Egypt. In that year, Saladin rode from Egypt past the Crusader states to Damascus with only 700 horsemen. The city opened its gates to Saladin without resistance, except for <b>the</b> <b>citadel,</b> which surrendered to him later that year. Saladin added a tower to <b>the</b> <b>citadel</b> and refurbished the residential buildings. Like his predecessor Nur ad-Din, Saladin died of an illness in <b>the</b> <b>citadel</b> on 4 March 1193. He was initially buried inside <b>the</b> <b>citadel,</b> but later reburied in a mausoleum near the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus.|$|E
5|$|In 1219, a {{group of}} Antiochene noblemen rose up against Raymond-Roupen who had lost Leo of Cilicia's support. Their leader, William Farabel, urged Bohemond to come to Antioch.

5|$|In 1833, his son Minh Mạng {{was faced}} with a {{rebellion}} led by Lê Văn Khôi, which started after the tomb of Khôi's father Lê Văn Duyệt was desecrated by imperial officials. The rebels took control of <b>the</b> <b>citadel</b> and the revolt continued until the imperial forces took control of <b>the</b> <b>citadel</b> in 1835. Following the capture of <b>the</b> <b>citadel,</b> Minh Mang ordered its razing and replacement with a smaller square stone-built structure, that was more vulnerable to attacks. On February 17, 1859, <b>the</b> <b>citadel</b> was captured during the French invasion after less than a day of battle and significant amounts of military supplies were seized. Realising {{that they did not have}} the capacity to hold the fort against Vietnamese attempts to recapture it, the French razed it with explosives, before withdrawing their troops.|$|E
5|$|In 2004 an {{agreement}} was signed between the DGAM and the Italian General Direction for Development Cooperation for a joint mission to renovate and reorganize <b>the</b> <b>citadel</b> and the National Museum of Damascus.

5|$|Most of the Vietnamese defence {{personnel}} were concentrated {{at the eastern}} gate of <b>the</b> <b>citadel,</b> where they stubbornly fought off the French. Rigault de Genouilly led 500 French troops in hand-to-hand combat for seven hours, having used explosives to breach <b>the</b> <b>citadel.</b> At 14:00, the French seized control of <b>the</b> <b>citadel.</b> Two hours later, de Genouilly declared <b>the</b> <b>citadel</b> as the new general headquarters of the French forces. The French seized a large arsenal. This included more than 200 cannons, 20,000 hand-held weapons such as firearms, pistols and swords, 100 tons of munitions, 80,000 tons of rice and 130,000 francs in cash. Saltpetre, shot and sulphur were also seized.

5|$|Nur ad-Din ruled as Zengid emir of Damascus from 1154 {{until his}} death in 1174. He took up {{residence}} in <b>the</b> <b>citadel</b> and rebuilt or refurbished its residential structures. After an earthquake hit Damascus in 1170, Nur ad-Din built a wooden house for sleeping and prayer next to the original stone residence of <b>the</b> <b>citadel.</b> In addition, he built a mosque and a fountain in <b>the</b> <b>citadel.</b> Between 1165 and 1174, Nur ad-Din re-fortified Damascus with a concentric wall, and it is possible that he also strengthened the defences of <b>the</b> <b>citadel.</b> Nur ad-Din died of an illness in <b>the</b> <b>citadel</b> on 15 May 1174 and was buried there; his body was later transferred to the Nur ad-Din Madrasah in Damascus.|$|E
5|$|Saladin's brother Al-Adil rebuilt <b>the</b> <b>citadel</b> {{completely}} between 1203 and 1216 {{in response}} {{to the development of the}} counterweight trebuchet. After his death, power struggles broke out between the other Ayyubid princes and although Damascus switched hands several times, <b>the</b> <b>citadel</b> was taken by force only once, in 1239. <b>The</b> <b>citadel</b> remained in Ayyubid hands until the Mongols under their general Kitbuqa captured Damascus in 1260, thereby ending Ayyubid rule in Syria. After an unsuccessful revolt broke out in <b>the</b> <b>citadel,</b> the Mongols had most of it dismantled. After the defeat of the Mongols in 1260 by the Mamluks, who had succeeded the Ayyubids as rulers of Egypt, Damascus came under Mamluk rule. Except for brief periods in 1300 and 1401, when the Mongols conquered Damascus, the Mamluks controlled <b>the</b> <b>citadel</b> until 1516. In that year, Syria fell into the hands of the Ottoman Empire. Damascus surrendered without a fight and from the 17th century onward <b>the</b> <b>citadel</b> functioned as barracks for the Jannisaries—Ottoman infantry units. <b>The</b> <b>citadel</b> started to fall into disrepair in the 19th century and its last military use was in 1925, when French soldiers shelled the old city from <b>the</b> <b>citadel</b> {{in response to}} the Great Syrian Revolt against the French Mandate of Syria. <b>The</b> <b>citadel</b> continued to serve as a barracks and prison until 1986, when excavations and restorations started.

5|$|Sovereign {{reveals that}} the Reapers remain outside the Milky Way waiting for organic life to develop and {{discover}} the Mass Relays, before harvesting them when they reach their peak. Afterwards, with the bomb about to explode, Shepard hears that Ashley and Kaidan have both been pinned down, and must choose which one to rescue. Shepard also finds Saren, who claims that his allegiance to Sovereign will save organic life forms by demonstrating their usefulness to the Reapers. Liara is then able to pinpoint the Conduit's location back on the Normandy: a Prothean world known as Ilos. There, Shepard learns that <b>the</b> <b>Citadel</b> Station is actually a huge Mass Relay that the Reapers use to invade the galaxy. During the last extinction cycle, a few Protheans survived on Ilos via cryopreservation and then re-entered <b>the</b> <b>Citadel</b> Station via the Conduit, a reverse-engineered miniature Mass Relay disguised aboard the station as a statue. The Protheans sabotaged <b>the</b> <b>Citadel</b> to prevent the Reapers from remotely activating <b>the</b> <b>Citadel</b> Mass Relay. Saren plans to reach <b>the</b> <b>Citadel</b> by using the Conduit to allow Sovereign to activate <b>the</b> <b>Citadel</b> Mass Relay and trigger the Reaper invasion.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{evidence for}} occupation of <b>the</b> <b>citadel</b> mound {{dates to the}} 5th millennium BC, and possibly earlier. It appears {{for the first time}} in historical sources in the Ebla tablets around 2,300 BC, and gained particular importance during the Neo-Assyrian period. During the Sassanian period and the Abbasid Caliphate, Erbil was an important centre for Christianity. After the Mongols captured <b>the</b> <b>citadel</b> in 1258, the importance of Erbil declined. During the 20th century, the urban structure was significantly modified, as a result of which a number of houses and public buildings were destroyed. In 2007, the High Commission for Erbil Citadel Revitalization (HCECR) was established to oversee the restoration of <b>the</b> <b>citadel.</b> In the same year, all inhabitants, except one family, were evicted from <b>the</b> <b>citadel</b> as part of a large restoration project. Since then, archaeological research and restoration works have been carried out at and around the tell by various international teams and in cooperation with local specialists. The government plans to have 50 families live in <b>the</b> <b>citadel</b> once it is renovated.|$|E
5|$|The {{perimeter}} wall of <b>the</b> <b>citadel</b> is not {{a continuous}} fortification wall, but consists of the façades of approximately 100 houses that have been built against each other. Because they have been built {{on or near the}} steep slope of <b>the</b> <b>citadel</b> mound, many of these façades were strengthened by buttresses to prevent their collapse or subsidence. There were circa 30 city-palaces; most of them located along the perimeter of <b>the</b> <b>citadel.</b> The oldest surviving house that can be securely dated through an inscription was built in 1893. The oldest houses {{can be found on the}} southeastern side of the mound, whereas houses on the northern perimeter date to the 1930s–1940s. Before the introduction of modern building techniques, most houses on <b>the</b> <b>citadel</b> were built around a courtyard. A raised arcade overlooking the courtyard, a flat roof and a bent-access entrance to prevent views of the courtyard and the interior of the house were characteristic elements of the houses on <b>the</b> <b>citadel.</b>|$|E
