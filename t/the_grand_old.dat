500|$|The {{traditional}} {{folk music}} of England is centuries old and {{has contributed to}} several genres prominently; mostly sea shanties, jigs, hornpipes and dance music. It has its own distinct variations and regional peculiarities. Wynkyn de Worde printed ballads of Robin Hood from the 16th century are an important artefact, as are John Playford's The Dancing Master and Robert Harley's Roxburghe Ballads collections. Some of the best-known songs are Greensleeves, Pastime with Good Company, Maggie May and Spanish Ladies amongst others. Many nursery rhymes are of English origin such as Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, Roses are red, Jack and Jill, London Bridge Is Falling Down, <b>The</b> <b>Grand</b> <b>Old</b> Duke of York, Hey Diddle Diddle and Humpty Dumpty. Traditional English Christmas carols include [...] "We Wish You a Merry Christmas", [...] "The First Noel" [...] and [...] "God Rest You Merry, Gentlemen".|$|E

[...] He designed holes that played straight up the hill, had holes traversing along the crests with second shots to green sites placed below, and even from one hill to the next. [...] He brought you in at an angle and {{off the top of}} hills and slopes depending on what topography he could take advantage of. [...] His course design skills were even more impressive at Fairmont Le Manoir Richelieu where he managed to build a great course on a very severe piece of topography with 400 feet of elevation change.

500|$|Elizabeth Dyke married Sir Thomas Dyke Acland, 7th Baronet (1722–1785) of Killerton in Devon and Petherton Park in Somerset in 1745. A {{prominent}} {{member of}} the West Country gentry, Acland was a famous staghunter who used his wife's Exmoor estates of Holnicote and Pixton as his hunting seats. He built kennels for the North Devon Staghounds and kept his own pack of dogs. He became forester or ranger of Exmoor under grant from the Crown, a title for the king's chief officer of the royal forest. According to the Victorian author, Charle Palk Collyns, he [...] "hunted the country in almost princely style. Respected and beloved by all the countryside, he was solicited {{at the same time}} to allow himself to be returned as member of Parliament for the counties of Devon and Somerset. He preferred, however, the duties and pleasures of life in the country, where he bore without abuse <b>the</b> <b>grand</b> <b>old</b> name of gentleman". Although he had three of his own kennels, he had a further method of keeping hounds at Holnicote, Jury and Highercombe, whereby he made the keeping of one hound a term a stipulation of many of the tenancies he granted. In his manor of Bossington (near Holnicote) alone an estate survey of 1746–7 lists twelve tenements let, either by Acland or Dyke, with the requirement to keep a hound.|$|E
