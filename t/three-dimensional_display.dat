40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a computer graphics method for efficiently rendering images of static geometric scene databases from multiple viewpoints. <b>Three-dimensional</b> <b>displays</b> such as parallax panogramagrams, lenticular panoramagrams, and holographic stereograms require samples of image data captured {{from a large}} number of regularly spaced camera images in order to produce a three-dimensional image. Computer graphics algorithms that render these images sequentially are inefficient because they do not take advantage of the perspective coherence of the scene. A new algorithm, multiple viewpoint rendering (MVR), is described which produces an equivalent set of images one to two orders of magnitude faster than previous approaches by considering the image set as a single spatio-perspective volume. MVR uses a computer graphics camera geometry based on a common model of parallax-based <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>displays.</b> MVR can be implemented using variations of traditional computer graphics algorithms and accelerated using standard computer graphics hardware systems. Details of the algorithm design and implementation are given, including geometric transformation, shading, texture mapping and reflection mapping. Performance of a hardware-based prototype implementation and comparison of MVR-rendered and conventionally rendered images are included. Applications of MVR to holographic video and other <b>display</b> systems, to <b>three-dimensional</b> image compression, and to other camera geometries are also given...|$|R

An X-ray device, an addition to the unit allowing passengers to check their own baggage was being tested in 1999 at Anchorage. This concept, known as [...] "Airport of the Future" [...] by the airline, was first tested in Anchorage and was later brought to its Seattle hub, and it drew attention from other airlines as well.
