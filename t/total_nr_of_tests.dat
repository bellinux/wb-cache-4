5000|$|The two FM audio {{channels}} {{occupied the}} disc spectrum at 2.3 and 2.8 MHz on NTSC formatted discs and each channel had a 100 kHz FM deviation. The FM audio carrier frequencies {{were chosen to}} minimize their visibility in the video image, so that even with a poorly mastered disc, audio carrier beats in the video {{will be at least}} ‑35 dB down, and thus, invisible. Due to the frequencies chosen, the 2.8 MHz audio carrier (Right Channel) and the lower edge of the chroma signal are very close together and if filters are not carefully set during mastering, there can be interference between the two. In addition, high audio levels combined with high chroma levels can cause mutual interference, leading to beats becoming visible in highly saturated areas of the image. To help deal with this, Pioneer decided to implement the CX Noise Reduction System on the analog tracks. By reducing the dynamic range and peak levels of the audio signals stored on the disc, filtering requirements were relaxed and visible beats greatly reduced or eliminated. The CX system gives a <b>total</b> <b>NR</b> effect <b>of</b> 20 dB, but in the interest of better compatibility for non-decoded playback, Pioneer reduced this to only 14 dB of noise reduction (the RCA CED system used the [...] "original" [...] 20 dB CX system). This also relaxed calibration tolerances in players and helped reduce audible pumping if the CX decoder was not calibrated correctly.|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} drought on the {{activity}} <b>of</b> nitrate reductase (<b>NR)</b> were studied in Helianthus annuus L. plants subjected to soil drying and subsequent rewatering. Drought did not negatively affect the activation state <b>of</b> <b>NR,</b> but resulted in linearly correlated decreases {{in the activity}} of the unphosphorilated active form and the <b>total</b> activity <b>of</b> <b>NR,</b> both in roots and leaves. The concentration of nitrate in roots, xylem and leaves also decreased in waterstressed plants, whereas the concentration of total amino acids was only transiently depressed at the leaf level. In contrast, soluble sugars accumulated both in roots and leaves of waterstressed plants. Drought-induced decrease in root NR activity was correlated with the observed changes in root nitrate concentration. A higher percentage of the decrease in foliar NR activity could be explained by the decline in nitrate flux to the leaves than by leaf nitrate content. Following rewatering, the extent <b>of</b> recovery <b>of</b> <b>NR</b> activity was higher in roots than in leaves.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} <b>of</b> {{nitrate reductase}} (<b>NR)</b> regulation under long-term anoxia in roots of whole {{plants and the}} putative role of nitrate in anoxia tolerance have been addressed. NR activity in tomato roots increased significantly after 24 h of anaerobiosis and increased further by 48 h, with a concomitant release of nitrite into the culture medium. Anoxia promoted NR activation through dissociation of the 14 - 3 - 3 protein inhibitor and NR dephosphorylation. After 24 h of anoxia, the <b>total</b> amount <b>of</b> <b>NR</b> increased slightly up to 48 h. However, NR-mRNA levels remained constant between 0 h and 24 h of root anoxia and decreased after 48 h. This is {{probably due to the}} inhibition <b>of</b> <b>NR</b> degradation and the accumulation of its native form. NR was slightly dephosphorylated in the absence of oxygen and nitrate. Under anoxia, NR dephosphorylation was modulated by nitrate-controlled NR activity. In addition, the presence of nitrate prevents anoxic symptoms on leaves and delays wilting by 48 h during root anoxia. In the absence of nitrate, plants withered within 24 h, as they did with tungstate treatment, an inhibitor <b>of</b> <b>NR</b> activity. Thus, anoxia tolerance of tomato roots could be enhanced by nitrate reduction...|$|R
40|$|SYNOPSIS. To gain basic {{understanding}} of the reproductive and developmental effects of endocrine dis-rupting chemicals in invertebrates, we have used C. elegans as an animal model. The completion of the C. elegans genome sequence brings to bear microarray analysis {{as a tool for}} these studies. We previously showed that the C. elegans genome was responsive to vertebrate steroid hormones, and changes in gene expression of traditional biomarkers used in environmental studies were detected; i. e., vitellogenin (vtg), cytochrome P 450 (cyp 450), glutathione-S-transferase (gst) and heat shock proteins (hsp). The data were interpreted to suggest that exogenous lipophilic compounds can be metabolized via cytochrome P 450 pro-teins, and that the resulting metabolites can bind to members of the Nuclear Receptor (<b>NR)</b> class <b>of</b> proteins and regulate gene expression. In the present study, using DNA microarrays, we examined the pattern of gene expression after progesterone (1025, 1027 M), estradiol (1025 M), cholesterol (1029 M) and cadmium (0. 1, 1 and 10 mM) exposure, with special attention to the members <b>of</b> <b>NRs.</b> <b>Of</b> approximately 284 <b>NRs</b> in C. elegans, expression <b>of</b> 25 <b>NR</b> genes (representing 9 % <b>of</b> the <b>total</b> <b>NRs</b> in C. elegans) was altered after exposure to steroids.

These results suggest that NRs respond to a variety of exogenous steroids, which regulate important metabolic and developmental pathways. The response o...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} study, a twenty-mer {{antisense}} oligonucleotide specific for N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor one (ANR 1) {{was applied to}} striatal neurons in primary cell culture. The ANR 1 {{was found to be}} specific and nontoxic. Significant reductions in expression <b>of</b> <b>NR</b> 1 mRNA and proteins were resulted after a single dose of ANR 1 transcripts. Interestingly, there were reductions in <b>total</b> <b>NR</b> 1 proteins but two phosphorylated forms <b>of</b> <b>NR</b> 1 proteins at serine 896 and 897 residues were not reduced. There was also no change in the pattern <b>of</b> distribution <b>of</b> <b>NR</b> 1 immunoreactivity in the striatal neurons. In addition, significant reductions of NMDA-mediated peak inward current were found after application of a higher concentration of ANR 1 (20 - 100 μM) by patch clamp recordings. The present results indicate that ANR 1 is a useful agent in reducing NMDA receptor functions. The present data thus provide detailed cellular and molecular mechanisms to explain our previous findings of amelioration of motor symptoms in a rat model of Parkinson's disease. More importantly, application of ANR 1 was also found to display neuroprotective effects of striatal neurons against NMDA-induced excitotoxic cell death. The findings have implications in development of new approach in prevention of cell death in neurodegenerative diseases and new treatments for these diseases. Copyright © 2005 S.

NR (purified or in crude extracts) in vitro produced NO at saturating NADH and nitrite concentrations at about 1 % of its nitrate reduction capacity. The K-m for nitrite was relatively high (100 muM) compared to nitrite concentrations in illuminated leaves (10 muM). NO production was competitively inhibited by physiological nitrate concentrations (K-i= 50 muM). Importantly, inactivation <b>of</b> <b>NR</b> in crude extracts by protein phosphorylation with MgATP {{in the presence}} of a protein phosphatase inhibitor also inhibited NO production. Nitrate-fertilized plants or leaves emitted NO into purified air. The NO emission was lower in the dark than in the light, but was generally only a small fraction <b>of</b> the <b>total</b> <b>NR</b> activity in the tissue (about 0. 01 - 0. 1 %). In order to check for a modulation of NO production in vivo, NR was artificially activated by treatments such as anoxia, feeding uncouplers or AICAR (a cell permeant 5 '-AMP analogue). Under all these conditions, leaves were accumulating nitrite to concentrations exceeding those in normal illuminated leaves up to 100 -fold, and NO production was drastically increased especially in the dark.

Tyrosine phosphorylation <b>of</b> <b>NR</b> 2 B was measured in two ways: binding of antiphosphotyrosine antibodies (PY 20) to glycoprotein(s) of 180 kDa (GP 180) purified on Con A-Sepharose and binding of anti-NR 2 B antibodies to tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins purified on PY 20 -agarose. Three hours after LTP induction, anti-NR 2 B binding to tyrosine phosphorylated proteins, expressed as a ratio of tetanized to control dentate (Tet/Con), was 2. 21 +/- 0. 50 and PY 20 binding to GP 180 was 1. 68 +/- 0. 16.

State-of-the-art research on nanoscale materials has revealed that electronic, magnetic, phononic, and optical properties may differ dramatically when their one-dimensional forms are synthesized. The present article aims to review the recent advances in synthesis techniques and theoretical studies on <b>NRs.</b> The structure <b>of</b> the review is organized as follows: After a brief introduction to low dimensional materials, we review different experimental techniques for the synthesis of graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) with their advantages and disadvantages. In addition, theoretical investigations on width and edge-shape-dependent electronic and magnetic properties, functionalization effects, and quantum transport properties of GNRs are reviewed. We then devote time to the <b>NRs</b> <b>of</b> the transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) family. First, various synthesis techniques, E-field-tunable electronic and magnetic properties, and edge-dependent thermoelectric performance <b>of</b> <b>NRs</b> <b>of</b> MoS 2 and WS 2 are discussed. Then, strongly anisotropic properties, growth-dependent morphology, and the weakly width-dependent bandgap <b>of</b> ReS 2 <b>NRs</b> are summarized. Next we discuss TMDs having a T-phase morphology such as TiSe 2 and stable single layer <b>NRs</b> <b>of</b> mono-chalcogenides. Strong edge-type dependence on characteristics <b>of</b> GaS <b>NRs,</b> width-dependent Seebeck coefficient <b>of</b> SnSe <b>NRs,</b> and experimental analysis on the stability <b>of</b> ZnSe <b>NRs</b> are reviewed. We then focus on the most recently emerging NRs belonging to the class of transition metal trichalcogenides which provide ultra-high electron mobility and highly anisotropic quasi- 1 D properties. In addition, width-, edge-shape-, and functionalization-dependent electronic and mechanical properties of blackphosphorus, a monoatomic anisotropic material, and studies on <b>NRs</b> <b>of</b> group IV elements (silicene, germanene, and stanene) are reviewed. Observation of substrate-independent quantum well states, edge and width dependent properties, the topological phase <b>of</b> silicene <b>NRs</b> are reviewed. In addition, H 2 concentration-dependent transport properties and anisotropic dielectric function of GeNRs and electric field and strain sensitive I-V characteristics of SnNRs are reviewed. We review both experimental and theoretical studies on the <b>NRs</b> <b>of</b> group III-V compounds.

We report that although each PSD- 95 MAGUK was shown to co-immunoprecipitate with NR 1 /NR 2 A, NR 1 /NR 2 B, NR 1 /NR 2 C and NR 1 /NR 2 D receptor subtypes, they elicited differential effects with regard to the enhancement <b>of</b> <b>total</b> <b>NR</b> 2 subunit expression which then results in an increased cell surface expression of NMDA receptor subtypes. PSD- 95 and chapsyn- 110 enhanced NR 2 A and <b>NR</b> 2 B <b>total</b> expression which resulted in increased NR 1 /NR 2 A and NR 1 /NR 2 B receptor cell surface expression whereas SAP 97 and SAP 102 had no effect on total or cell surface expression of these subtypes. PSD- 95, chapsyn- 110, SAP 97 and SAP 102 had no effect on either <b>total</b> <b>NR</b> 2 C and NR 2 D subunit expression or cell surface NR 1 /NR 2 C and NR 1 /NR 2 D expression.

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, all the rate-pairs {{that are}} {{achievable}} at a Nash equilibrium (NE) in the two-user linear deterministic symmetric decentralized interference channel (LD-S-DIC) with noisy feedback are identified. More specifically, the Nash region (<b>NR)</b> <b>of</b> the LD-S-DIC with noisy feedback is fully characterized. The relevance of these rate-pairs {{is that once}} they are achieved by using NE transmit-receive configurations, none of the transmitter-receiver pairs can increase their individual rates by unilaterally changing their configurations. More importantly, it is shown that the <b>NR</b> <b>of</b> the LD-S-DIC with noisy feedback {{is larger than the}} <b>NR</b> <b>of</b> the LD-S-DIC without feedback only in certain cases. When interference is stronger than the desired signals, a larger NR is observed only if the signal to noise ratios (SNRs) of the feedback links are higher than the SNRs of the direct links. Conversely, when desired signals are stronger than interference, a larger NR is observed only if the SNRs of the feedback links are higher than both the signal to interference ratios (SIRs) and the interference to noise ratios (INRs) of the direct links. Previous results, namely the NE region of the two-user LD-S-DIC without feedback and with perfect output feedback are obtained as special cases of the results presented in this contribution...|$|R

40|$|Nature of {{the problem}} • Observations of {{atmospheric}} reactive nitrogen (Nr) deposition are severely restricted in spatial extent and type. The chain of processes leading to atmospheric deposition emissions, atmospheric dispersion, chemical transformation and eventual loss from the atmosphere is extremely complex and therefore currently, observations can only address part of this chain. Approaches: • Modelling provides a way of estimating atmospheric transport and deposition <b>of</b> <b>Nr</b> at the European scale. A description of the different model types is provided. • Current deposition estimates from models are compared with observations from European air chemistry monitoring networks. • The main focus of the chapter is at the European scale; however, both local variability and and intercontinental Nr transfers are also addressed. Key findings/state of knowledge: • Atmospheric deposition is a major input <b>of</b> <b>Nr</b> for European terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems as well as coastal sea areas. • Models are key tools to integrate our understanding of atmospheric chemistry and transport, and are essential for estimating the spatial distribution of deposition, and to support the formulation of air pollution control strategies. • Our knowledge of the reliability of models for deposition estimates is, however, limited, since we have so few observational constraints on many key parameters. • <b>Total</b> <b>Nr</b> deposition estimates cannot be directly assessed {{because of a lack}} of measurements, especially <b>of</b> the <b>Nr</b> dry deposition component. Differences among European regional models can be significant, however, e. g. 30 % in some areas, and substantially more than this for specific locations. Major uncertainties/challenges • There are very few measurements of many of the key compounds (e. g. gaseous HNO 3, coarse-nitrate, NH 3), which are needed to enable comprehensive model evaluation. Data on all compounds should be available at the same site if the mass-balance <b>of</b> <b>Nr</b> is to be assessed, pointing to the need for integrated site measurements in air monitoring networks. • The main needs for oxidised Nr compounds are to evaluate how well the models capture the partitioning between gaseous HNO 3 and either fine or coarse nitrate aerosol. For reduced Nr compounds, better estimates of NH 3 emissions are needed, and how these are affected by meteorological factors as well as agricultural practices, coupled with an understanding of biosphere–atmosphere exchange. • Dry deposition of particles, sub-grid fluxes of NHx compounds, and effects of topography on wet deposition are especially difficult to parameterise properly. Recommendations • There is a significant need for studies to constrain uncertain model parameters. This includes measurements of both the gas and particle phases <b>of</b> <b>Nr</b> compounds, and <b>of</b> atmosphere–biosphere fluxes <b>of</b> <b>Nr</b> compounds over sensitive ecosystems. • A balanced programme of observations and models is needed and is critical to future understanding of atmospheric transport and deposition <b>of</b> <b>Nr</b> containing pollutants at local to global scales.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the participation of}} cyclin-dependent kinase- 5 (Cdk 5) -mediated N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) NR 2 B subunit phosphorylation in cross-organ reflex sensitization caused by colon irritation, The external urethral sphincter electromyogram (EUSE) reflex activity evoked by the pelvic afferent nerve test stimulation (TS, I stimulation/ 30 s) and protein expression in the spinal cord and dorsal root ganglion tissue (T 13 -L 2 and L 6 -S 2 ipsilateral to the Stimulation) in response to colon mustard oil (MO) instillation were tested in anesthetized rats. When compared with a baseline reflex activity with a single action potential evoked by the TS before the administration <b>of</b> <b>test</b> agents, MO instillation into the descending colon sensitized the evoked activity characterized by elongated firing in the reflex activity in association with increased protein levels of Cdk 5, PSD 95, and phosphorylated NR 2 B (pNR 2 B) but not <b>of</b> <b>total</b> <b>NR</b> 2 B (tNR 2 B) in the spinal cord tissue. Both cross-organ reflex sensitization and increments in protein expression were reversed fly intra-colonic pretreatments with ruthenium red (a non-selective transient receptor potential vanilloid. TRPV, antagonist), capsaizepine (a TRPV(1) -selective antagonist), lidocaine (a nerve conduction blocker) {{as well as by}} the intra-thecal pretreatment with APV (a NRMDR antagonist) Co- 101244 (a NR 2 B-selective antagonist) and roscovitine (a Cdk 5 antagonist). Moreover, compared with the control group, both the increase in pNR 2 B and the cross-organ reflex sensitization were attenuated in the si-RNA <b>of</b> <b>NR</b> 2 B rats. All these results Suggested that Cdk-dependent NMDAR NR 2 B Subunit phosphorylation mediates the development of cross-organ pelvic-urethra reflex sensitization Caused by acute colon irritation which could possibly underlie the high concurrence of pelvic pain syndrome with irritable bowel syndrome.
