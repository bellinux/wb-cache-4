Ivan Sratsimir and his family were captured and taken to the castle of Humnik in Croatia and the region of Vidin was placed under direct Hungarian rule governed [...] through a Ban appointed by the King of Hungary. Ivan Sratsimir spent four years in honorary Hungarian captivity and he and his family were forced to accept Catholicism. The Hungarians also sent Franciscan monks to convert the population of the Vidin Tsardom to Catholicism. Although the Hungarian accounts boasted that the Franciscans converted 200,000 people, or a third of the region's population, this move brought great discontent among the Bulgarian population and eventually failed.

2500|$|Critics of this {{argument}} generally argue that there are morally relevant disanalogies between abortion and the kidney failure scenario.

Some writers defend the analogy against these objections, arguing that the disanalogies are morally irrelevant or do not apply to abortion in the way critics have claimed.|$|R

2500|$|In Taranaki, Māori, {{often with}} the <b>tacit</b> <b>consent</b> of the government, later began {{returning}} to the lands that {{had been taken from}} them. When parts of those lands were subsequently wanted for settlement, compensation payments were made to Māori users [...] in government eyes, a bribe to keep the peace rather than a purchase price [...] and deeds of cession were signed, transferring title to Europeans. In 1880 spiritual leader Te Whiti o Rongomai judged that such payments meant the confiscations were a sham and began to actively claim back confiscated land that had not been used by the government, proceeding on the basis that Māori only had to enter the land and plough it to re-establish their rights. Te Whiti rejected cession payments and bribes and his followers persistently pulled up surveyors' pegs and obstructed road makers, initially in central Taranaki and later throughout New Zealand, with ploughmen's campaigns. Tension led to the armed police raid on Parihaka, Taranaki, in November 1881 and the expulsion of 2000 men, women and children, followed by the destruction of the village.|$|E

The new rules were put into effect in March before formal passage of the bill with the announcement that temporary contracts for up to a year would be awarded by Farley.

2500|$|The {{most common}} {{objection}} is that Thomson's violinist argument can justify abortion only {{in cases of}} rape. In the violinist scenario, the woman was kidnapped: [...] she did not consent to having the violinist plugged in and she did nothing to cause the violinist to be plugged in, just {{as a woman who}} is pregnant due to rape did nothing to cause her pregnancy.

Other common objections turn on the claim that the fetus is the pregnant woman's child, whereas the violinist is a stranger (the stranger versus offspring objection), or that abortion directly and intentionally kills the fetus, whereas unplugging the violinist merely lets him die of natural causes (the killing versus letting die objection).|$|E

5000|$|Protectorate of Missions is a {{term for}} the right of {{protection}} exercised by a Christian power in an 'infidel' (e.g. Muslim) country {{with regard to the}} persons and establishments of the missionaries.
