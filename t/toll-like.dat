25|$|<b>Toll-like</b> receptors (TLRs) {{can also}} {{signal to the}} necrosome, leading to necroptosis. TLRs are a class of receptors that {{function}} in the innate immune system to recognize conserved components of pathogens, such as flagellin.|$|E
25|$|Downregulation of miR-181 family {{contributes}} to aggressive leukemia phenotype through mechanisms {{related to the}} activation pathways of innate immunity mediated by <b>toll-like</b> receptors TLR2, TLR4, TLR7 and TLR8 and interleukin-1β IL1B (humans on chromose 2).|$|E
25|$|Alterations in {{exposure}} to microorganisms is another plausible explanation, at present, {{for the increase}} in atopic allergy. Endotoxin exposure reduces release of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IFNγ, interleukin-10, and interleukin-12 from white blood cells (leukocytes) that circulate in the blood. Certain microbe-sensing proteins, known as <b>Toll-like</b> receptors, found {{on the surface of}} cells in the body are also thought to be involved in these processes.|$|E
25|$|It is {{remarkable}} {{that two of}} the pioneering studies were on malaria. The classical studies on the Toll receptor in Drosophila fruit fly were rapidly extended to <b>Toll-like</b> receptors in mammals and then to other pattern recognition receptors, which play important roles in innate immunity. However, the early contributions on malaria remain as classical examples of innate resistance, which have stood the test of time.|$|E
25|$|When activated, <b>toll-like</b> receptors (TLRs) take adapter {{molecules}} {{within the}} cytoplasm of cells {{in order to}} propagate a signal. Four adaptor molecules {{are known to be}} involved in signaling, which are Myd88, TIRAP, TRIF, and TRAM. These adapters activate other intracellular molecules such as IRAK1, IRAK4, TBK1, and IKKi that amplify the signal, eventually leading to the induction or suppression of genes that cause certain responses. Thousands of genes are activated by TLR signaling, implying that this method constitutes an important gateway for gene modulation.|$|E
25|$|Introduction of {{too much}} siRNA can result in nonspecific events due to {{activation}} of innate immune responses. Most evidence to date suggests that this is probably due to activation of the dsRNA sensor PKR, although retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) may also be involved. The induction of cytokines via <b>toll-like</b> receptor 7 (TLR7) has also been described. One promising method of reducing the nonspecific effects is to convert the siRNA into a microRNA. MicroRNAs occur naturally, and by harnessing this endogenous pathway {{it should be possible}} to achieve similar gene knockdown at comparatively low concentrations of resulting siRNAs. This should minimize nonspecific effects.|$|E
25|$|The organism's {{evolutionary}} {{placement and}} unique embryology with five-fold symmetry were the major {{arguments in the}} proposal to seek the sequencing of its genome. Importantly, urchins act as the closest living relative to chordates and thus may {{shed light on the}} evolution of vertebrates. The genome of Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, was completed in 2006 and established homology between sea urchin and vertebrate immune system-related genes. Sea urchins code for at least 222 <b>Toll-like</b> receptor genes and over 200 genes related to the Nod-like-receptor family found in vertebrates. This increases its usefulness as a valuable model organism for studying the evolution of innate immunity. The sequencing also revealed that while some genes were thought to be limited to vertebrates, there were also innovations that have previously never been seen outside the chordate classification, such as immune transcription factors PU.1 and SPIB.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{release of}} nuclear {{proteins}} and chromatin, antigen presenting cells, such as dendritic cells and macrophages, display these antigens to T helper cells. Although {{the details of}} this process are still controversial, evidence shows that to produce an immune response, DNA must activate an antigen presenting cell to produce type 1 interferons. This cytokine serves to induce maturation of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDCs) so that they can display their antigens to T helper cells. The mechanism in which eukaryotic DNA activates these cells is still as yet unclear; however, immunogenic CpG sequences have been found to either activate PDCs or act as adjuvant in the response to eukaryotic DNA. CpG motif DNA acts via the pattern recognition receptor, <b>toll-like</b> receptor 9, found highly expressed in PDCs and B cells. The T helper cells then activate B cells, which are also in the presence of these antigens, causing the production of autoantibodies.|$|E
25|$|Environmental factors, such as glandular viral infection, could prompt {{epithelial}} cells {{to activate the}} HLA-independent innate immune system through <b>toll-like</b> receptors. Although a number of infectious, exogenous agents have been implicated in the pathogenesis of SS, such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), human T-lymphotropic virus 1, and hepatitis C virus, their association with SS appears weak. While EBV {{is present in the}} salivary glands of normal individuals, a high incidence of EBV reactivation in SS patients has been reported with increased levels of EBV DNA. This indicates viral reactivation and inability of lymphoid infiltrates to control EBV replication in SS, leading to the initiation or perpetuation of an immune response in target organs. Nonetheless, it remains to be clarified exactly how reactivation of EBV is induced in lesions of patients with SS, and which specific molecular mechanisms are involved in the process of viral reactivation.|$|E
25|$|This {{regulation}} of cytokines appear to occur via the p38 MAPKs (mitogen-activated protein kinase)-dependent pathway. Usually, the p38 within the dendritic cell expresses TLR 4 (<b>toll-like</b> receptor 4), which is activated through the ligand LPS (lipopolysaccharide). This causes the p38 MAPK to be phosphorylated. This phosphorylation activates the p38 MAPK to begin producing IL-10 and IL-12. When the dendritic cells are chronically exposed to morphine during their differentiation process then treated with LPS, {{the production of}} cytokines is different. Once treated with morphine, the p38 MAPK does not produce IL-10, instead favoring production of IL-12. The exact mechanism through which the production of one cytokine is increased in favor over another is not known. Most likely, the morphine causes increased phosphorylation of the p38 MAPK. Transcriptional level interactions between IL-10 and IL-12 may further increase the production of IL-12 once IL-10 is not being produced. This increased production of IL-12 causes increased T-cell immune response.|$|E
25|$|Aberrant B cell receptor-mediated {{feedback}} – A {{feature of}} human autoimmune disease {{is that it}} is largely restricted to a small group of antigens, several of which have known signaling roles in the immune response (DNA, C1q, IgGFc, Ro, Con. A receptor, Peanut agglutinin receptor(PNAR)). This fact gave rise to the idea that spontaneous autoimmunity may result when the binding of antibody to certain antigens leads to aberrant signals being fed back to parent B cells through membrane bound ligands. These ligands include B cell receptor (for antigen), IgG Fc receptors, CD21, which binds complement C3d, <b>Toll-like</b> receptors 9 and 7 (which can bind DNA and nucleoproteins) and PNAR. More indirect aberrant activation of B cells can also be envisaged with autoantibodies to acetyl choline receptor (on thymic myoid cells) and hormone and hormone binding proteins. Together with the concept of T-cell-B-cell discordance this idea forms the basis of the hypothesis of self-perpetuating autoreactive B cells. Autoreactive B cells in spontaneous autoimmunity are seen as surviving because of subversion both of the T cell help pathway and of the feedback signal through B cell receptor, thereby overcoming the negative signals responsible for B cell self-tolerance without necessarily requiring loss of T cell self-tolerance.|$|E
25|$|Side effects such as {{hyperalgesia}} and allodynia, sometimes {{accompanied by}} a worsening of neuropathic pain, may be consequences of long-term treatment with opioid analgesics, especially when increasing tolerance has resulted in loss of efficacy and consequent progressive dose escalation over time. This appears to largely {{be a result of}} actions of opioid drugs at targets other than the three classic opioid receptors, including the nociceptin receptor, sigma receptor and <b>Toll-like</b> receptor 4, and can be counteracted in animal models by antagonists at these targets such as J-113,397, BD-1047 or (+)-naloxone respectively. No drugs are currently approved specifically for counteracting opioid-induced hyperalgesia in humans and in severe cases the only solution may be to discontinue use of opioid analgesics and replace them with non-opioid analgesic drugs. However, since individual sensitivity to the development of this side effect is highly dose dependent and may vary depending which opioid analgesic is used, many patients can avoid this side effect simply through dose reduction of the opioid drug (usually accompanied by the addition of a supplemental non-opioid analgesic), rotating between different opioid drugs, or by switching to a milder opioid with a mixed mode of action that also counteracts neuropathic pain, particularly tramadol or tapentadol.|$|E
500|$|A {{phagocyte}} {{has many}} types of receptors on its surface {{that are used to}} bind material. They include [...] opsonin receptors, scavenger receptors, and <b>Toll-like</b> receptors. Opsonin receptors increase the phagocytosis of bacteria that have been coated with immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies or with complement. [...] "Complement" [...] is the name given to a complex series of protein molecules found in the blood that destroy cells or mark them for destruction. Scavenger receptors bind to a large range of molecules on the surface of bacterial cells, and <b>Toll-like</b> receptors—so called because of their similarity to well-studied receptors in fruit flies that are encoded by the Toll gene—bind to more specific molecules. Binding to <b>Toll-like</b> receptors increases phagocytosis and causes the phagocyte to release a group of hormones that cause inflammation.|$|E
500|$|Macrophages {{and related}} cells employ a {{different}} mechanism {{to recognize the}} pathogen. Their receptors recognize certain [...] present on the invading pathogen that are very unlikely to be present on a host cell. Such repeating motifs are recognized by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) like the <b>Toll-like</b> receptors (TLRs) expressed by the macrophages. Since the same receptor could bind to a given motif present on surfaces of widely disparate microorganisms, this mode of recognition is relatively nonspecific, and constitutes an innate immune response.|$|E
500|$|A major {{mechanism}} of acne-related skin inflammation is mediated by P. acnes ability to bind and activate {{a class of}} immune system receptors known as <b>toll-like</b> receptors (TLRs), especially TLR2 and TLR4. Activation of TLR2 and TLR4 by P. acnes leads to increased secretion of [...] IL-1α, IL-8, and TNF-α. Release of these inflammatory signals attracts various immune cells to the hair follicle including neutrophils, macrophages, and Th1 cells. IL-1α stimulates increased skin cell activity and reproduction, which in turn fuels comedo development. Furthermore, sebaceous gland cells produce more antimicrobial peptides, such as HBD1 and HBD2, in response to binding of TLR2 and TLR4.|$|E
500|$|Mast {{cells have}} <b>Toll-like</b> receptors and {{interact}} with dendritic cells, B cells, and T cells to help mediate adaptive immune functions. Mast cells express MHC class II molecules and can participate in antigen presentation; however, the mast cell's role in antigen presentation is not very well understood. Mast cells can consume and kill gram-negative bacteria (e.g., salmonella), and process their antigens. They specialize in processing the fimbrial proteins {{on the surface of}} bacteria, which are involved in adhesion to tissues. In addition to these functions, mast cells produce cytokines that induce an inflammatory response. [...] This is {{a vital part of the}} destruction of microbes because the cytokines attract more phagocytes to the site of infection.|$|E
500|$|Phagocytosis {{is common}} and {{probably}} appeared early in evolution, [...] evolving first in unicellular eukaryotes. Amoebae are unicellular protists that {{separated from the}} tree leading to metazoa shortly after the divergence of plants, and they share many specific functions with mammalian phagocytic cells. [...] Dictyostelium discoideum, for example, is an amoeba that lives in the soil and feeds on bacteria. Like animal phagocytes, it engulfs bacteria by phagocytosis mainly through <b>Toll-like</b> receptors, and it has other biological functions in common with macrophages. [...] Dictyostelium discoideum is social; it aggregates when starved to form a migrating pseudoplasmodium or slug. This multicellular organism eventually will produce a fruiting body with spores that are resistant to environmental dangers. Before the formation of fruiting bodies, the cells will migrate as a slug-like organism for several days. During this time, exposure to toxins or bacterial pathogens {{has the potential to}} compromise survival of the species by limiting spore production. Some of the amoebae engulf bacteria and absorb toxins while circulating within the slug, and these amoebae eventually die. They are genetically identical to the other amoebae in the slug; their self-sacrifice to protect the other amoebae from bacteria is similar to the self-sacrifice of phagocytes seen in the immune system of higher vertebrates. This ancient immune function in social amoebae suggests an evolutionarily conserved cellular foraging mechanism that might have been adapted to defense functions well before the diversification of amoebae into higher forms. However, a common ancestry with mammalian phagocytes has not been proven. Phagocytes occur throughout the animal kingdom, from marine sponges to insects and lower and higher vertebrates. The ability of amoebae to distinguish between self and non-self is a pivotal one, and is the root of the immune system of many species of amoeba.|$|E

2500|$|Type I interferons (IFN), {{secreted}} {{mainly by}} dendritic cells, {{play a central}} role in antiviral host defense and a cell´s antiviral state. Viral components are recognized by different receptors: <b>Toll-like</b> receptors are located in the endosomal membrane and recognize double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), MDA5 and RIG-I receptors are located in the cytoplasm and recognize long dsRNA and phosphate-containing dsRNA respectively. When the cytoplasmic receptors MDA5 and RIG-I recognize a virus the conformation [...] between the caspase-recruitment domain (CARD) and the CARD-containing adaptor MAVS changes. In parallel, when <b>toll-like</b> receptors in the endocytic compartments recognize a virus the activation of the adaptor protein TRIF is induced. Both pathways converge in the recruitment and activation of the IKKε/TBK-1 complex, inducing dimerization of transcription factors IRF3 and IRF7, which are translocated in the nucleus, where they induce IFN production with the presence of a particular transcription factor and activate transcription factor 2. IFN then binds to the IFN receptors, inducing hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes to be expressed. This leads to antiviral protein [...] production, such as protein kinase R, which inhibits viral protein synthesis, or the 2′,5′-oligoadenylate synthetase family, which degrades viral RNA.|$|E
2500|$|Some of the {{strategies}} for bacteria to bypass host defenses include the generation of filamentous structures. As {{it has been observed}} in other organisms (such as fungi), filamentous forms are resistant to phagocytosis. As an example of this, during urinary tract infection, filamentatious structures of uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) start to develop in response to host innate immune response (more exactly in response to <b>Toll-like</b> receptor 4-TLR4). TLR-4 is stimulated by the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and recruits neutrophils (PMN) which are important leukocytes to eliminate these bacteria. Adopting filamentous structures, bacteria resist these phagocytic cells and their neutralizing activity (which include antimicrobial peptides, degradative enzyme and reactive oxygen species).|$|E
2500|$|CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (or CpG ODN) {{are short}} {{single-stranded}} synthetic DNA molecules that contain a cytosine triphosphate deoxynucleotide ("C") {{followed by a}} guanine triphosphate deoxynucleotide ("G"). The [...] "p" [...] refers to the phosphodiester link between consecutive nucleotides, although some ODN have a modified phosphorothioate (PS) backbone instead. When these CpG motifs are unmethylated, they act as immunostimulants. CpG motifs are considered pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) due to their abundance in microbial genomes but their rarity in vertebrate genomes. The CpG PAMP is recognized by the pattern recognition receptor (PRR) <b>Toll-Like</b> Receptor 9 (TLR9), which is constitutively expressed only in B cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) in humans and other higher primates.|$|E
2500|$|Induction of CYP1A1 by {{benzopyrene}} occurs via binding to the {{aryl hydrocarbon}} receptor in the cytosol, leading the transformed receptor to translocate to the nucleus where it dimerises with {{aryl hydrocarbon receptor}} nuclear translocator and then binds xenobiotic response elements in DNA located upstream of certain genes. [...] This process increases transcription of genes including CYP1A1, resulting in increased CYP1A1 protein production. This process is similar to induction of CYP1A1 by certain polychlorinated biphenyls and dioxins. Seemingly, CYP1A1 activity in the intestinal mucosa prevents major amounts of ingested benzopyrene to enter portal blood and systemic circulation. Intestinal, but not hepatic, expression of CYP1A1 depends on <b>TOLL-like</b> receptor 2 (TLR2), which is a eucaryotic receptor for bacterial surface structures such as lipoteichoic acid. Moreover, benzopyrene {{has been found to}} activate a transposon, LINE1, in humans.|$|E
2500|$|Invertebrates do {{not possess}} {{lymphocytes}} or an antibody-based humoral immune system, {{and it is likely}} that a multicomponent, adaptive immune system arose with the first vertebrates. [...] Nevertheless, invertebrates possess mechanisms that appear to be precursors of these aspects of vertebrate immunity. Pattern recognition receptors are proteins used by nearly all organisms to identify molecules associated with microbial pathogens. <b>Toll-like</b> receptors are a major class of pattern recognition receptor, that exists in all coelomates (animals with a body-cavity), including humans. The complement system, as discussed above, is a biochemical cascade of the immune system that helps clear pathogens from an organism, and exists in most forms of life. Some invertebrates, including various insects, crabs, and worms utilize a modified form of the complement response known as the prophenoloxidase (proPO) system.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the most}} {{interesting}} developments in biomedical science during the past few decades has been elucidation of mechanisms mediating innate immunity. [...] One set of innate immune mechanisms is humoral, such as complement activation. [...] Another set comprises pattern recognition receptors such as <b>toll-like</b> receptors, which induce the production of interferons and other cytokines increasing resistance of cells such as monocytes to infections. Cytokines produced during innate immune responses are among the activators of adaptive immune responses. Antibodies exert additive or synergistic effects with mechanisms of innate immunity. Unstable HbS clusters Band-3, a major integral red cell protein; antibodies recognize these clusters and accelerate their removal by phagocytic cells. Clustered Band 3 proteins with attached antibodies activate complement, and complement C3 fragments are opsonins recognized by the CR1 complement receptor on phagocytic cells.|$|E
2500|$|When a cell is {{infected}} by a virus, some {{components of the}} virus, mainly viral nucleic acids, are recognized by specialized cellular molecules such as RIG-I, MDA5 and some <b>toll-like</b> receptors (TLR). This recognition induces the activation of specific serine kinases, enzymes which activate by phosphorylation the IFN regulatory factors (IRF), IRF3 and IRF7. IRF3 and IRF7 are themselves transcription factors that translocate into the nucleus and activate the transcription of type I IFNs genes and thereby initiate the process leading to the secretion of IFN by the infected cells. The [...] "danger" [...] signals carried by viruses were the first IFN inducers described but it is now known that non-viral [...] "danger" [...] signals, such as some types of dead cells, can stimulate the synthesis of type I IFNs.|$|E
2500|$|... "Resistance" [...] (R) {{proteins}}, encoded by R genes, {{are widely}} present in plants and detect pathogens. These proteins contain domains {{similar to the}} NOD Like Receptors and <b>Toll-like</b> receptors utilized in animal innate immunity. Systemic acquired resistance (SAR) {{is a type of}} defensive response that renders the entire plant resistant to a broad spectrum of infectious agents. SAR involves the production of chemical messengers, such as salicylic acid or jasmonic acid. Some of these travel through the plant and signal other cells to produce defensive compounds to protect uninfected parts, e.g., leaves. [...] Salicylic acid itself, although indispensable for expression of SAR, is not the translocated signal responsible for the systemic response. Recent evidence indicates a role for jasmonates in transmission of the signal to distal portions of the plant. RNA silencing mechanisms are also important in the plant systemic response, as they can block virus replication. The jasmonic acid response, is stimulated in leaves damaged by insects, and involves the production of methyl jasmonate.|$|E
2500|$|The VP24 and VP35 [...] {{structural}} proteins of EBOV play a {{key role}} in this interference. When a cell is infected with EBOV, receptors located in the cell's cytosol (such as RIG-I and MDA5) or outside of the cytosol (such as <b>Toll-like</b> receptor 3 (TLR3), TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9), recognize infectious molecules associated with the virus. On TLR activation, proteins including interferon regulatory factor 3 and interferon regulatory factor 7 trigger a signaling cascade that leads to the expression of type 1 interferons. The type 1 interferons are then released and bind to the IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 receptors expressed on the surface of a neighboring cell. Once interferon has bound to its receptors on the neighboring cell, the signaling proteins STAT1 and STAT2 are activated and move to the cell's nucleus. This triggers the expression of interferon-stimulated genes, which code for proteins with antiviral properties. EBOV's V24 protein blocks the production of these antiviral proteins by preventing the STAT1 signaling protein in the neighboring cell from entering the nucleus. The VP35 protein directly inhibits the production of interferon-beta. By inhibiting these immune responses, EBOV may quickly spread throughout the body.|$|E
2500|$|The innate {{immune system}} {{constitutes}} {{the first line of}} defense against invading pathogens and is regarded as the major initiator of inflammatory responses. [...] Its cellular component involves primarily monocyte/macrophages, granulocytes, and dendritic cells (DCs), which are activated upon sensing of conserved pathogen structures (PAMPs) by pattern recognition receptors such as <b>Toll-like</b> receptors ((TLRs)). MIR155HG (i.e. miR-155-5p) expression is greatly enhanced by TLR agonist stimulation of macrophages and dendritic cells. [...] Since microbial lipopolysaccharide (an agonist of TLR4) activates a chain of events that lead to the stimulation of the NF-κB and AP-1 transcription factors, it was hypothesized that endotoxin activation of MIR155HG may be mediated by those transcription factors. [...] Indeed, MIR155HG expression was found to be activated in [...] LPS treated murine macrophage cells (i.e. Raw264.7) by an NF-κB-mediated mechanism. Furthermore, [...] H. pylori infection of primary murine bone marrow-derived macrophages resulted in a NF-κB dependent up-regulation of MIR155HG. In the context of viral infection vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) challenge of murine peritoneal macrophages was reported to result in miR-155-5p over-expression via a retinoic acid-inducible gene I/JNK/NF-κB–dependent pathway. Support for a role of AP-1 in MIR155HG activation comes from studies using stimuli relevant to viral infection such as TLR3 ligand poly(I:C) or interferon beta (IFN-β). [...] Downstream of those stimuli AP-1 seems to play a major role in MIR155HG activation.|$|E
2500|$|Steatohepatitis {{is seen in}} both {{alcoholic}} and non-alcoholic liver disease and {{is the culmination of}} a cascade of events that began with injury. [...] In the case of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, this cascade is initiated by changes in metabolism associated with obesity, insulin resistance, and lipid dysregulation. In alcoholic hepatitis, chronic excess alcohol use is the culprit. [...] Though the inciting event may differ, the progression of events is similar and begins with accumulation of free fatty acids (FFA) and their breakdown products [...] in the liver cells in a process called steatosis. This initially reversible process overwhelms the hepatocyte's ability to maintain lipid homeostasis leading to a toxic effect [...] as fat molecules accumulate and are broken down in the setting of an oxidative stress response. [...] Overtime, this abnormal lipid deposition triggers the immune system via <b>toll-like</b> receptor 4 (TLR4) resulting in the production of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF that cause liver cell injury and death. [...] These events mark the transition to steatohepatitis and in the setting of chronic injury, fibrosis eventually develops setting up events that lead to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Microscopically, changes that can be seen include steatosis with large and swollen hepatocytes (ballooning), evidence of cellular injury and cell death (apoptosis, necrosis), evidence of inflammation in particular in zone 3 of the liver, variable degrees of fibrosis and Mallory bodies.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike mammals, Drosophila flies {{only have}} innate {{immunity}} and lack an adaptive immune response. The D. melanogaster immune {{system can be}} divided into two responses: humoral and cell-mediated. The former is a systemic response mediated through the Toll and imd pathways, which are parallel systems for detecting microbes. The Toll pathway in Drosophila is known as the homologue of <b>Toll-like</b> pathways in mammals. Spatzle, a known ligand for the Toll pathway in flies, is produced in response to Gram-positive bacteria, parasites, and fungal infection. Upon infection, pro-Spatzle will be cleaved by protease SPE (Spatzle processing enzyme) to become active Spatzle, which then binds to the Toll receptor located on the cell surface (Fat body, hemocytes) and dimerise for activation of downstream NF-κB signaling pathways. The imd pathway, though, [...] is triggered by Gram-negative bacteria through soluble and surface receptors (PGRP-LE and LC, respectively). D. melanogaster has a [...] "fat body", which is thought to be homologous to the human liver. It is the primary secretory organ and produces antimicrobial peptides. These peptides are secreted into the hemolymph and bind infectious bacteria, killing them by forming pores in their cell walls. Years ago many drug companies wanted to purify these peptides and use them as antibiotics. Other than the fat body, hemocytes, the blood cells in Drosophila, are known as the homologue of mammalian monocyte/macrophages, possessing a significant role in immune responses. It is known from the literature that in response to immune challenge, hemocytes are able to secrete cytokines, for example Spatzle, to activate downstream signaling pathways in the fat body. However, the mechanism still remains unclear.|$|E
