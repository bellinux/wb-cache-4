5|$|The Oxford English Dictionary derives {{the word}} straightforwardly from Old English butorflēoge, butter-fly; similar names in Old Dutch and Old High German {{show that the}} name is ancient.

5000|$|Before 1900, Peirce treated {{abduction}} {{as the use}} of a known rule {{to explain}} an observation, e.g., it is a known rule that if it rains <b>the</b> <b>grass</b> <b>is</b> wet; so, to explain the fact that <b>the</b> <b>grass</b> <b>is</b> wet; one abduces that it has rained. Abduction can lead to false conclusions if other rules explaining the observation are not taken into account (e.g. if the sprinklers <b>were</b> recently on <b>the</b> <b>grass</b> <b>is</b> wet). This remains the common use of the term [...] "abduction" [...] in the social sciences and in artificial intelligence.|$|R

500|$|At {{the house}} site, <b>the</b> <b>grass</b> <b>was</b> removed. [...] Often, the soil was {{excavated}} {{one to two}} feet (...) below ground level; this reduced {{the height of the}} walls, and thus the amount of sod that had to be cut. [...] The ground that would form the house floor was moistened and then tamped with a fencepost to flatten and harden it. [...] Footings were rarely laid, due to the cost or unavailability of material.|$|E
500|$|The {{blocks for}} the house were cut from {{bluestem}} sod, probably obtained from a site {{very close to the}} house. [...] <b>The</b> <b>grass</b> <b>was</b> mown to a height of 1/4 inch (...) the blocks were then cut with a grasshopper plow, to dimensions of about [...] long by [...] wide by [...] thick. [...] Blocks were laid with the grass side down, in a one-course common bond; the walls were battered, measuring [...] thick at ground level and [...] thick at the top.|$|E

500|$|Before the sod blocks were cut, <b>the</b> <b>grass</b> <b>was</b> mown {{short or}} burned off. [...] At times, the surface was scored with a cutter or disc; the blocks {{could then be}} removed with a spade. [...] This approach, however, tended to produce rough and {{non-uniform}} blocks, which complicated the task of laying them in even courses. [...] Blocks could also be cut with a plow. [...] An ordinary plow could be used, given considerable skill and care {{on the part of}} the operator; however, the mouldboard tended to turn over and break up the blocks; even if intact blocks were produced, they were generally not of uniform thickness. [...] In the late 19th century, a modified plow designed specifically for sod cutting was invented: this [...] "grasshopper plow" [...] replaced the mouldboard with a set of adjustable rods, which allowed the operator to cut a uniform strip of sod three to six inches (...) deep and [...] wide. [...] This strip could then be cut into blocks. [...] The dimensions of these depended, among other things, on the strength of the builderthe blocks were dense, and had to be sized so that the builders could lift them. [...] Typical blocks cut with a grasshopper plow might measure four inches (...) deep by [...] wide by [...] long.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} {{produced}} by Al Jean and Mike Reiss, who had served as showrunners of seasons three and four. They returned to the show to produce this and several other episodes while under contract with The Walt Disney Company. The episode was written by Reid Harrison and directed by Steven Dean Moore. It {{had one of the}} longest episode gaps between its conception to the time it was finished. The idea was first conceived at a story retreat. Jean found a copy of TV Guide while in the bathroom, with The X-Files on the cover. Feeling a crossover would be a good idea, he came back into the room, told Reiss his idea, and the pair pitched it. None of the other staff wanted to do it, so Reiss and Jean decided to do it themselves. Before the episode was produced, the script was sent to Chris Carter, the creator of The X-Files, who said that it was an [...] "honor" [...] to be satirized by The Simpsons. Jean was worried that the episode was not funny, as at the table reading {{there were only a few}} of the writers present and as such, the script got no laughs at all. It took a long time to come up with an ending, and an explanation for the alien. Originally, it was just going to be left as a mystery. Mulder and Scully's office was designed to be exactly the same as the one used in The X-Files. After it had been finished, Fox sent the episode out for a critical review, which was [...] "really great". The scene with the [...] "Homer is a dope" [...] T-shirts originally had an extra line: [...] "I told you, we're sold out!", thus filling in the plot error in the actual episode in which Homer asks for some T-shirts, despite just being told that they were sold out. The scene after Homer's first encounter with the alien, in which he runs through a field writing [...] "Yahhh!" [...] in <b>the</b> <b>grass,</b> <b>was</b> written by David M. Stern, and added in after the original read through.|$|E
2500|$|Traditional hay {{making in}} the Boho was a {{communal}} endeavour. Neighbours of the farmer and his family would gather round to help [...] "win" [...] the hay before any sign of rain. This was a long and arduous job compared to the modern process. Local people might even {{take a day off}} their regular job for this sole purpose. The meadow was cut using a scythe (originally), and then in more modern times by tractor with a side-mounted mower blade. The grass swathes would be turned over by means of a hay rake and if <b>the</b> <b>grass</b> <b>was</b> dry enough it would be [...] with a pitchfork. The person that was tedding would lift as much as he/she could with a pitchfork and then shake it out vigorously over the ground. Once <b>the</b> <b>grass</b> <b>was</b> dry enough, the loose hay would be gathered into rows with hay rakes (this tedding might be repeated depending on how dry <b>the</b> <b>grass</b> <b>was).</b> The rows could also be made into small [...] "laps" [...] or [...] "lappins" [...] which are circularised stacks of dried grass. The invention of a hay-right or tedding machine connected to the power take-off (PTO) of a tractor made tedding a lot less labour-intensive.|$|E

2500|$|The site {{today is}} covered by the Cenchrus Ciliaris grass, {{commonly}} found in Zimbabwe but not in Mozambique. Berger suggests that this may indicate <b>the</b> <b>grass</b> <b>was</b> introduced along with cattle from Zimbabwe. The site is located 350km from Great Zimbabwe, the capital of a large, pre-colonial empire active from at least the 11th through the 14th centuries. Barker (1978) has suggested that only the ruling elite at Manyikeni consumed beef, as cattle bones have been found only in {{the central part of}} the site. The lower classes who lived at the periphery of the site ate meat from [...] The presence of a large number of glass beads and seashells at the site have led to speculation that the settlement traded extensively with the ancient coastal settlement of Chibuene.|$|E
2500|$|To {{accommodate}} these varied events, Giants Stadium sported various playing {{surfaces in}} its history. From its opening {{until the end}} of the 1999 NFL season, Giants Stadium sported an AstroTurf playing surface. This surface was covered by Bermuda grass sod for the World Cup in 1994, identical to that at the Rose Bowl where the other semifinal and the finals were held (so that both teams in the finals would have played on identical surfaces). <b>The</b> <b>grass</b> <b>was</b> removed after the World Cup, as it would have died in the New Jersey winter. The MetroStars installed a grass field with interchangeable trays each spring that was removed prior to football season, forcing the team to play the remainder of its season on the AstroTurf field used by the football teams. (It should be noted that when the New York Cosmos called Giants Stadium home, they played on the stadium's artificial surface and never used a grass field.) ...|$|E
2500|$|In the 1960s, in Tully, Queensland, Australia, and in Canada, {{there were}} many reports of UFO {{sightings}} and circular formations in swamp reeds and sugar cane fields. For example, on 8 August 1967, three circles were found in a field in Duhamel, Alberta, Canada, and the Department of National Defence sent two investigators, who concluded that it was artificially made but couldn't make definite conclusions on who made them or how. The most famous case is the 1966 Tully [...] "saucer nest", when a farmer said he witnessed a saucer-shaped craft rise 30 or [...] up from a swamp and then fly away. When he went to investigate the location where he thought the saucer had landed, he found a nearly circular area 32 feet long by 25 feet wide where <b>the</b> <b>grass</b> <b>was</b> flattened in clockwise curves to water level within the circle, and the reeds had been uprooted from the mud. The local police officer, the Royal Australian Air Force, and the University of Queensland concluded that it was most probably caused by natural causes, like a down draught, a willy-willy (dust devil), or a waterspout. In 1973, G.J. Odgers, Director of Public Relations, Department of Defence (Air Office), wrote to a journalist that the [...] "saucer" [...] was probably debris lifted by the causing willy-willy. Hoaxers Bower and Chorley said they were inspired by this case to start making the modern crop circles that appear today.|$|E
