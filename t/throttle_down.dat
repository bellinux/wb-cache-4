25|$|The Altair descent {{stage was}} to be powered by four RL-10 rocket engines, which are also those used in the Centaur upper stage of the Atlas V rocket. Unlike the current RL-10 engines in use, these newer RL-10s were {{to have the ability}} to <b>throttle</b> <b>down</b> to as low as 10% rated thrust (the older {{specifications}} allow for 20%), thus allowing the use of Altair for both the lunar orbit insertion (LOI) and landing stages of lunar missions. The ascent stage was designed to be powered by a single engine, likely a hypergolic engine similar or identical to the main engine of the Orion CSM, which would use the descent stage as both a launchpad and a platform for future base construction. Alternately, there was a small possibility that the original plan of using LOX/CH4–fueled engines on board the Block II (lunar) Orion CSM and Altair ascent stage would have been adopted.|$|E
500|$|Hamilton {{accepted}} {{responsibility for}} his near stall on the grid: [...] "I hadn't hit the switch early enough and therefore we {{were not in the}} launch map and went straight into anti-stall, and when everyone else was in their launch mode, I wasn't." [...] Renault dismissed suggestions that Alonso had brake tested Hamilton in the incident that led to the McLaren's wing breaking off. Pat Symonds, Renault's head of engineering, said his team's telemetry indicated Alonso was on full <b>throttle</b> <b>down</b> the straight, and had not touched the brakes: [...] "I think all I can say from our side {{is that there is no}} blame attributable to Fernando, which is what some of the speculation might be." [...] McLaren F1 CEO Martin Whitmarsh said that Hamilton's front wing had broken seconds before the impact, and that the resulting downforce reduction had sucked Hamilton into Alonso's slipstream faster than expected. However, photos indicate that the front wing on the McLaren could have broken even earlier when Hamilton nudged a car (believed to be Alonso) on the opening lap. The later incident left Alonso with damage to the back of the car, impairing his attempts to pass Glock late in the race.|$|E

25|$|In 2002, the RS-68 {{became the}} first large liquid-propellant rocket engine {{designed}} in the U.S. since the Space Shuttle main engine (SSME) in the 1970s. The primary goal for the RS-68 was to reduce cost versus the SSME. Some sacrifice in chamber pressure and specific impulse was made, hurting efficiency; however, development time, part count, total cost, and assembly labor were reduced to {{a fraction of the}} SSME, despite the RS-68's significantly larger size. Typically, the RS-68 runs at 102% rated thrust for the first few minutes of flight, and then <b>throttles</b> <b>down</b> to 58% rated thrust before main engine cutoff. On the Heavy variant, the main CBC's engine <b>throttles</b> <b>down</b> to 58% rated thrust around 50 seconds after liftoff, while the strap-on CBCs remain at 102%. This allows the main CBC to conserve propellant and burn after booster separation. After the strap-on CBCs separate, the main CBC's engine throttles back up to 102% before <b>throttling</b> back <b>down</b> to 58% prior to main engine cutoff.|$|R
60|$|He went up {{and also}} went to sleep, and, since the {{telegraph}} stood at full-speed ahead, the young third clung to a greasy rail, all eyes and ears, {{with one hand on}} the gear that would <b>throttle</b> <b>down</b> the steam, while the rolling grew more vicious and the plunges steeper. Quick as he was, there was a thunderous clamor every now and then as the big compound engines, which were twice the size of those of a modern boat of equal tonnage, ran away, and he commenced to long for the close of his watch while the perspiration dripped from him. He had not been very long at sea, and there is a responsibility upon the man on watch when the whirring screw swings clear. At last there was a heavier plunge than usual, and, though the third did all he could, the big engines span and clamored furiously as the stern went up. Then there was a harsh, grinding scream, and a crash. After that came sudden stillness, and the third frantically span the wheel that cut off the steam, while grimy men went sliding and floundering over the slippery plates and platforms toward the high-pressure engine.|$|E

50|$|Continuous descent {{approach}} (CDA) {{also known}} as optimized profile descent (OPD), is a method by which aircraft approach airports prior to landing. It is designed {{to reduce fuel consumption}} and noise compared to other conventional descents. Instead of approaching an airport in a stairstep fashion, <b>throttling</b> <b>down</b> and requesting permission to descend to each new (lower) altitude, CDA allows for a smooth, constant-angle descent to landing.|$|R

5000|$|By December 2013, Blue Origin updated engine {{specifications}} following engine tests {{conducted on}} test stands at ground level, near sea level.

[...] The final engine specifications, released in April 2015 following the full test phase, included a minimum thrust of 20000 lbf kN, an even wider throttling capability by 20 percent than the preliminary numbers, while maintaining the previously released full power thrust spec.|$|E

50|$|The plane {{departed}} from Stockholm at 08:47, {{on the day}} of the crash. Shortly after liftoff, pieces of ice slammed onto the fans of both engines, deforming the fan blades sufficiently to disturb the airflow to the compressors. The disturbed airflow caused the compressors to stall and this in turn caused the engines to surge. Because the engines were not <b>throttled</b> <b>down</b> sufficiently, the surges continued. The high loads from repeated engine surges quickly led to the breakup of both engines.|$|R
50|$|More recently, {{high-end}} hobby systems using Pulse-Code Modulation (PCM) features {{have come}} on the market that provide a digital bit-stream signal to the receiving device instead of analog type pulse modulation. Advantages include bit error checking capabilities of the data stream (good for signal integrity checking) and fail-safe options including motor (if the model has a motor) <b>throttle</b> <b>down</b> and similar automatic actions based on signal loss. However, those systems that use pulse code modulation generally induce more lag due to lesser frames sent per second as bandwidth is needed for error checking bits. PCM devices can only detect errors and thus hold the last verified position or go into failsafe mode. They cannot correct transmission errors.|$|E
5000|$|Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne and Dynetics {{proposed}} a liquid-fueled booster named [...] "Pyrios".

The F-1B would be derived from the F-1 engine, which powered the first stage of the Saturn V. It would have been easier to assemble, with fewer parts and a simplified design, while providing improved efficiency and a thrust increase of 25000 lbf kN. Estimates in 2012 indicated that the Pyrios booster could increase Block 2 low-Earth orbit payload to 150 t, 20 t more than the baseline.|$|E

40|$|During launch countdown, at {{approximately}} T- 7 seconds, the Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSMEs) roar to life. When the controllers indicate normal operation, the solid rocket boosters ignite and the shuttle blasts off.

40|$|Abstract. Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks pose a {{significant}} {{threat to the}} Internet today {{especially if they are}} distributed, i. e., launched simultaneously at a large number of systems. Reactive techniques that try to detect such an attack and <b>throttle</b> <b>down</b> malicious traffic prevail today but usually require an additional infrastructure to be really effective. In this paper we show that preventive mechanisms can be as effective with much less effort: We present an approach to (distributed) DoS attack prevention that is based on the observation that coordinated automated activity by many hosts needs a mechanism to remotely control them. To prevent such attacks, it is therefore possible to identify, infiltrate and analyze this remote control mechanism and to stop it in an automated fashion. We show that this method can be realized in the Internet by describing how we infiltrated and tracked IRC-based botnets which are the main DoS technology used by attackers today. ...|$|E
