He first thought that he should [...] "put the whole <b>thing</b> <b>out</b> of my mind", but he continued because he thought {{the only way to}} prevent Nazi Germany from using a nuclear bomb was if Britain had one to act as a deterrent. He worked with Chadwick on Tube Alloys, the British atomic bomb project.|$|E
500|$|Meeting with Deep Throat again, Deep Throat {{explains}} that Wilczek is being detained {{by the government}} at an undisclosed location. When Mulder asks if the COS survived, Deep Throat assures him the virus left no trace of it, and that scientists from the Defense Department have unsuccessfully examined the machine for any remaining signs of the program. At the Eurisko Building, Peterson directs a team attempting to recover the COS, but is told by his superiors to destroy the machine in six hours. Unbeknownst to Peterson, the COS comes back to life and watches as he says to himself, [...] "I'm going to figure this <b>thing</b> <b>out</b> if it kills me".|$|E
500|$|Vašek expresses his confusions in a short, sad song ("I can't {{get it out}} of my head"), but is {{interrupted}} by the arrival of a travelling circus. The Ringmaster introduces the star attractions: Esmeralda, the Spanish dancer, a [...] "real Indian" [...] sword swallower, and a dancing bear. A rapid folk-dance, the skočná, follows. Vašek is entranced by Esmeralda, but his timid advances are interrupted when the [...] "Indian" [...] rushes in, announcing that the [...] "bear" [...] has collapsed in a drunken stupor. A replacement is required. Vašek is soon persuaded to take the job, egged on by Esmeralda's flattering words ("We'll make a pretty <b>thing</b> <b>out</b> of you").|$|E

500|$|After {{the release}} of Neon Ballroom, Silverchair's three-album {{contract}} with Sony Music had ended. The group eventually signed with Atlantic Records for North and South America, and formed their own label with Watson, [...] (distributed by EMI), for Australia and Asia. In November 2000, after the group had left the label, Sony issued The Best of Volume 1 without the band's involvement. Johns disavowed the compilation, [...] "We thought about putting out ads in the street press to make people aware that we weren't endorsing it, {{but that would have}} blown the whole <b>thing</b> <b>out</b> of proportion ... If people want to buy it, they can buy it but I wouldn't buy it if I was a silverchair fan." ...|$|E
500|$|The filmmakers found {{independently}} {{producing the}} film to have both benefits and challenges. Although {{they were given a}} great amount of creative control by their executive producer Maurice Kanbar, their small budget kept them from making potentially beneficial changes to the story once production was underway. Todd Edwards related that [...] "Money doesn't just buy you more talent and more machinery, it also buys you flexibility on a story level. At Disney, if they don't like the third act, they just throw the whole <b>thing</b> <b>out</b> and re-animate the whole thing, even if it's finished... We had no such luxury, and so in a way, you're watching our first version of the movie." ...|$|E
500|$|James Whale {{lived as}} an openly gay man {{throughout}} {{his career in the}} British theatre and in Hollywood, something that was virtually unheard of in the 1920s and 1930s. He and David Lewis lived together as a couple from around 1930 to 1952. While he did not go {{out of his way to}} publicize his homosexuality, he did not do anything to conceal it either. As filmmaker Curtis Harrington, a friend and confidant of Whale's, put it, [...] "Not in the sense of screaming it from the rooftops or coming out. But yes, he was openly homosexual. Any sophisticated person who knew him knew he was gay." [...] While there have been suggestions that Whale's career was terminated because of homophobia, and Whale was supposedly dubbed [...] "The Queen of Hollywood", Harrington states that [...] "nobody made a <b>thing</b> <b>out</b> of it as far as I could perceive".|$|E

500|$|Creator Tim Schafer {{has said}} that he has been a heavy metal music fan since high school, and roadies have long fascinated him. As Schafer said in 2007, [...] "The name was one of the very first things I thought of, over fifteen years ago. I was riding a bus, {{thinking}} about a game that would be the complete opposite of what we were working on, The Secret of Monkey Island [...] And Brütal Legend leapt into my head. I've been hanging on to that name ever since." [...] The title, which he describes as sounding [...] "like the hardest core fantasy <b>thing</b> <b>out</b> there", makes use of the metal umlaut. The idea behind the game first came to Schafer about fifteen years prior to its release, but its core concepts did not completely come together until after the completion of Psychonauts (2005), when he presented his idea for the game to the team, they became excited at the concept and decided to make that their next title.|$|E
500|$|Chamber pop {{was part}} of a larger trend which {{involved}} musicians who rejected traditional rock conventions, such as Tortoise and Stereolab, although those specific bands are not considered ork-pop. [...] The genre's orchestration is typically more complex than rock music, making extensive use of brass and strings. It drew from the 1990s lounge music revival but avoided any influence from other contemporary styles like grunge, electronica, or alternative music, particularly the lo-fi hiss and distortion of the last. Although modern rock groups like Smashing Pumpkins, Oasis, and R.E.M. occasionally used strings, their approach was considerably less intricate. The High Llamas were one of the first to anticipate the easy-listening fad with their 1993 debut album Gideon Gaye. O'Hagan felt that [...] "There is this whole misconception that American college rock with twisted baseball hats and checked shirts is adventurous, but it's the most conformist, corporate <b>thing</b> <b>out</b> there.... All these bands sound like Nirvana and Pearl Jam. It's a shame that it couldn't be discovered from the get-go for what it is. A lot of it is just very simple dumb-guy rock." ...|$|E
500|$|Treasury Secretary Mellon also {{recommended}} to Congress that {{income tax rates}} be cut. He asked that the excess profits tax on corporations be abolished. The House Ways and Means Committee endorsed Mellon's proposals, but some congressmen, who wanted to raise tax rates on corporations, fought the measure. Harding was unsure what side to endorse, telling a friend, [...] "I can't make a damn <b>thing</b> <b>out</b> of this tax problem. I listen to one side, and they seem right, and then—God!—I talk to the other side, and they seem just as right." [...] Harding tried compromise, and gained passage of the bill in the House {{after the end of}} the excess profits tax was delayed a year. In the Senate, the tax bill became entangled in efforts to vote World War I veterans a soldier's bonus. Frustrated by the delays, on July 12, Harding appeared before the Senate and urged it to pass the tax legislation without the bonus. It was not until November that the revenue bill finally passed, with higher rates than Mellon had proposed.|$|E

500|$|Other reviews {{were more}} mixed. Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club said {{that most of}} [...] "Aubrey" [...] was [...] "fun", {{although}} Tillman was not [...] "particularly interesting". He stated that things got [...] "dicey" [...] for him around the revelation about Thibedeaux's child {{and that he did}} not buy Mulder's genetic impulse theories. He criticised the ending, writing that it [...] " [...] whatever mood and character development the previous thirty had spent establishing for cheesy theatrics, and the whole thing lands with a resounding thud. There are too many problems with the concept; the nature/nurture debate {{has been going on for}} decades, and this ep throws the whole <b>thing</b> <b>out</b> the window in about two minutes. No other cause for BJ's actions is ever given... That's some lazy writing right there." [...] Meghan Deans from Tor.com gave the episode a mixed review and wrote that it was [...] "sort of good [...] sort of a terrible idea". She cited the theme of [...] "breaking the cycle of abuse" [...] as a plus for the entry, noting that it was a [...] "revenge story [...] a woman righting the wrongs of her male ancestors and breaking the cycle of violence outside the family". However, Deans was critical of various elements of the episode, most notably, the genetic theory conceit and the idea of a [...] "activator baby" [...] that caused Morrow's past ancestors to work through her.|$|E

By the time Sullivan turned his head, Elvis was standing motionless. After Presley left the stage, Sullivan stated, [...] "I can’t figure this darn <b>thing</b> <b>out.</b> You know. He just does this [...] and everybody yells." [...] Elvis appeared a second time in the show and sang [...] "Love Me". Later on, he sang a nearly four-minute-long version of [...] "Hound Dog" [...] and was shown in full the entire song.|$|E

2500|$|Doug Moon {{left the}} band {{because of his}} dislike of the band's {{increasing}} experimentation outside his preferred blues genre. Ry Cooder told of Moon's becoming so angered by Van Vliet's unrelenting criticism that {{he walked into the}} room pointing a loaded crossbow at him, only to have Van Vliet tell him, [...] "Get that fucking <b>thing</b> <b>out</b> of here, get out of here and get back in your room", which he did. (Other band members dispute this account, though Moon is likely to have [...] "passed through" [...] the studio with a weapon.) Moon was present during the early demo sessions at Original Sound studio, above the Kama Sutra/Buddah offices. The works Moon laid down did not see the light of day, as he was replaced by Cooder when they continued on material at Sunset Sound with Marker. Marker then fell by the wayside when recording was moved by Krasnow and Perry to RCA Studio. This would {{have a profound effect on}} the quality of the Safe as Milk work, as the former studio was 8-track and the subsequent studio a 4-track.|$|E
2500|$|The mission took a {{diversion}} into investigating a possible coup by ARVN officers when General Dương Văn Minh {{expressed an interest}} in meeting McNamara and Taylor, either alone or together. After an extensive series of discretionary arrangements were made, Taylor joined Minh in a game of doubles on the tennis court of the Saigon Officers Club. McNamara watched on as Taylor played with Minh, waiting anxiously for any signals from Minh to [...] "broad hints of our interest in other subjects which we gave him during breaks in the game". Minh revealed nothing of his thoughts about a possible coup, leaving his guest bewildered to his intentions in inviting them. McNamara later grumbled to Kennedy that [...] "I sat on a sideline two feet from Big Minh for over an hour and I couldn't get a damn <b>thing</b> <b>out</b> of him." [...] Taylor got one of the tennis players, Colonel Raymond Jones, to contact Minh about the situation, to which Minh replied with a complaint about a perceived lack of support from Washington for a coup. Minh claimed that he thought McNamara and Taylor were seeking nothing but a match of tennis and offered to discuss military affairs at any time.|$|E
