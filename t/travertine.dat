The Polish <b>travertines</b> (Holocene) are quarried in the Silesian-Cracow Monocline, and have found their applications in sepulchral-sacral architecture. Their equivalents brought from outside Poland are used as polished decorative stones. The most popular are: the Italian Daino Reale (Neogene) and the Classico Romano (Holocene) and the Iranian Azarshar Red (Pleistocene). All of them display stromatolite structures and oncoides.

5|$|Vigorous {{degassing}} {{of carbon}} dioxide occurs from several vents in two bogs near Nazko Cone. These vents are {{in the form of}} small isolated <b>travertine</b> mounds on the bog surface. A mound with a partially submerged vent had been identified in 2013 with a steady flow {{of carbon dioxide}}. Several new vents with no <b>travertine</b> mound were actively releasing carbon dioxide gas in 2015. Analysis of the carbon-13 isotope in the carbon dioxide gas emissions suggest a magmatic origin. This has led to the possibility of a volcanic geothermal system, the existence of which has been investigated by Geoscience BC as part of their Targeting Resources for Exploration and Knowledge project. The lack of hot springs and geothermal evidence on the surface suggest that the heat source of such a system would be very deep underground.|$|E

5|$|Potassium-argon (K-Ar) dating of the Miri summit {{has yielded}} {{an age of}} 200,000 years, and an older date (5,900,000 ± 2,800,000) has been {{obtained}} from the northwestern centre. Between the two are andesite dates of 5,630,000 ± 90,000 years and 2,390,000 ± 50,000 years. Although the last activity occurred during the Pleistocene (probably a large eruption), volcanism began earlier. The youngest date, obtained from K-Ar dating of pumice, is 90,000 ± 10,000 years.

5|$|Fossil Springs, {{the source}} of about 80percent {{of the water in}} Fossil Creek, issues from several vents in close {{proximity}} to one another {{at the base of the}} Mogollon Rim. The rim is the southern edge of the Colorado Plateau. Water percolating through limestone layers in the rim becomes laden with dissolved carbon dioxide and calcium carbonate. When the water emerges at the springs, it begins to release carbon dioxide as a gas and calcium carbonate as <b>travertine,</b> a porous form of calcite often found around hot springs such as Mammoth Hot Springs in Yellowstone National Park. The release, affected by stream turbulence and other factors, does not occur all at once but continues downstream.|$|E
5|$|The lake formed {{several times}} over during the Holocene when water from the Colorado River was {{diverted}} into the Salton Trough. This tectonic depression forms the northern basin of the Gulf of California, but it was separated from the sea proper by {{the growth of the}} Colorado River Delta. Such changes in river courses may have been caused by earthquakes among the numerous faults that cross the region, such as the San Andreas Fault. Conversely, {{it is possible that the}} weight of the water itself triggered earthquakes. During its existence, Lake Cahuilla formed strandlines and various beach deposits such as gravel bars and <b>travertine</b> deposits.|$|E
40|$|International audienceTravertines can occupy two {{different}} positions, in succession of forms and formations which appear during a morphoclimatic sequence {{on the southern}} side of Aurès mountains (Algerie). <b>Travertines</b> are placed either {{at the base of}} the major accumulation (terrace, alluvial fan), it means, after a major cutting, or, like calcareous crusts, they mould a minor cutting grown hollow at the expense of a pediment, at the end of the accumulation. Studies of paleaofauna and especially palaeoflora (prints of leaves and principally pollen grains) which are present in these <b>travertines</b> permit to imagine that the conditions of their deposition were little more humid than in the present. It seems, with the combination both of morphogenetic and paleoclimatic indications, that the <b>travertines</b> of Aurès mountains had been formed at the end of the small cutting of Catapluvial and particularly at the end of the major cutting of the Arid, during the Anapluvial...|$|R

5|$|The 250-metre {{long and}} 35-metre tall {{building}} has nine floors, but {{the height of}} the ground floor varies (4.6–4.2 m). This variation is reflected in the roof line which looks taller at the wings than the spine. The volume of the building is 280,000 m³, constructed from 4,600tonnes of steel frame with brick infill and floors constructed of hollow blocks to provide over 55740 m² of usable office space". The façade is clad with 33,000 m² Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt <b>Travertine</b> marble, punctuated in bands of windows decreasing in height with each storey. Only at the corners are the glazed strips interrupted for emphasis. The top storey is lit from skylights rather than banded glazing and has a very low ceiling height. It forms a clear building conclusion. Until the 1950s, the building was the largest and most modern office building in Europe.|$|E
5|$|The first {{element in}} the scheme of painted {{architecture}} is a definition of the real architectural elements by accentuating the lines where spandrels and pendentives intersect with the curving vault. Michelangelo painted these as decorative courses that look like sculpted stone moldings. These have two repeating motifs, a formula common in Classical architecture. Here, one motif is the acorn, the symbol of the family of both Pope Sixtus IV, who built the chapel, and Pope Julius II, who commissioned Michelangelo's work. The other motif is the scallop shell, one of the symbols of the Madonna, to whose assumption the chapel was dedicated in 1483. The crown of the wall then rises above the spandrels, to a strongly projecting painted cornice that runs right around the ceiling, separating the pictorial areas of the biblical scenes from the figures of Prophets, Sibyls, and Ancestors, who literally and figuratively support the narratives. Ten broad painted crossribs of <b>travertine</b> cross the ceiling and divide it into alternately wide and narrow pictorial spaces, a grid that gives all the figures their defined place.|$|E

The corresponding cross axis starts with the center point of the circle forming the GRI library garden, then passing {{to the center of the}} entrance rotunda, and aligning with the south wall of the rotunda building.

40|$|Terrestrial CaCO 3 precipitates, {{including}} <b>travertines,</b> tufas, and speleothems, {{are currently}} {{of great interest}} because of their potential as archives of environmental, climatic, and biologic information (e. g., Andrews et al. 1997; Bar-Matthews et al. 1997; Walter and Des Marais 1993). Detailed studies of examples of these terrestrial carbonates therefore provide valuable information to aid interpretation of their records of surface processes, environments, and associated organic influences. The recent paper by Fouke et al. (2000) is a useful contribution in this area, however, some of their comparisons with earlier studies are not wholly accurate and require clarification.

40|$|Waters {{from the}} Trollkjeldene (Troll springs) and Jotunkjeldene (Jotun springs) thermal springs on {{northern}} Svalbard have been analysed by ICP-AES, ICP-MS and IC techniques {{for a wide}} range of major and trace elements. Although it is plausible that the thermal waters originate from a deep reservoir in siliceous rocks, it appears that a significant component of their hydrochemical signature is derived from dissolution of higher-level Hecla Hoek marbles. Rare earth elements (REEs) show some degree of enrichment of heavy REEs in the water phase, relative to the marbles and to the <b>travertines</b> that precipitate from the waters. A strong positive Eu anomaly is also observed in the waters, suggesting preferential mobilisation of Eu under reducing conditions.

Almost all deposits are constituted by several plates located at different heights, from 100 m up to 900 m a. s. l.; their age, estimated through geomorphological analysis and radiometric dating, is comprised between the Middle Pleistocene and the Holocene.
