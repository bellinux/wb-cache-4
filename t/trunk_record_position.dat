40|$|This paper {{develops}} a control algorithm that can autonomously position an electrode {{so as to}} find and then maintain an optimal extracellular <b>recording</b> <b>position.</b> The algorithm was developed and tested in a two-neuron computational model representative of the cells found in cerebral cortex. The algorithm {{is based on a}} stochastic optimization of a suitably defined signal quality metric and is shown capable of finding the optimal <b>recording</b> <b>position</b> along representative sampling directions, as well as maintaining the optimal signal quality in the face of modeled tissue movements. The application of the algorithm to acute neurophysiological recording experiments and its potential implications to chronic recording electrode arrays are discussed...|$|R
