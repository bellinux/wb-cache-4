40|$|Up to {{one million}} antiprotons {{from a single}} LEAR spill have been {{captured}} in a large Penning trap. Surprisingly, when the antiprotons are cooled to energies significantly below 1 eV, the annihilation rate falls below background. Thus, very long storage times for antiprotons have been demonstrated in the trap, even at the compromised vacuum conditions imposed by the experimental set up. The significance for future ultra-low energy experiments, including portable antiproton traps, is discussed. Comment: 12 pages, latex; 4 figures, uufiled.

40|$|We review recent results {{about the}} {{functioning}} of aquatic carnivorous traps from the genus Utricularia. The use of high speed cameras has helped to elucidate the mechanism at {{the origin of the}} ultra fast capture process of Utricularia, at a millisecond time scale. As water is pumped out of the <b>trap,</b> <b>pressure</b> decreases inside the trap and elastic energy is stored due to the change of shape of the trap body. This energy is suddenly released when the trap is fired: the trap door undergoes an elastical instability: buckling, which allows its fast and passive opening and closure. This mechanism is used by Utricularia both to catch preys touching its trigger hairs and to fire spontaneously at regular time intervals. The results leading to this interpretation are reviewed and discussed and suggestions for further work are briefly presented...|$|E
40|$|AbstractExperiments {{examining}} the excitation of the quadrupolar n = 0, K = 1 to 6 resonances for the ion reserpine in a linear ion trap {{have been shown}} to produce resonance shifts that were dependent upon either or both of the excitation amplitude and <b>trap</b> <b>pressure</b> (Collings, B. A.; Douglas, D. J. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom., 2000, 11, 1016 – 1022). The extent of this dependency was determined by {{examining the}} effects of each parameter using an ion trajectory simulator. The simulations indicated that it is the change in excitation amplitude that is mostly responsible for the resonance shifts with a minor dependency upon the trapping pressure. It was found that the higher excitation amplitudes required to observe the higher order resonances resulted in greater shifts relative to the theoretical resonances predicted for an excitation amplitude of zero volts. The nature of these shifts can be understood by examining the equations of motion for an ion trapped in a quadrupolar potential during the excitation process. Rearrangement of the equations of motion lead to a Mathieu stability diagram in which the coordinate and ordinate variables are dependent upon the excitation frequency and amplitude. In such a diagram the resonances occur in the regions of instability. The calculated resonance shifts showed good correlation with the experimental and simulation results...|$|E

40|$|A fluid {{inclusion}} {{study was}} carried out on quartz veins deformed during {{the activity of the}} Munsiari Thrust in the Garhwal Himalaya (India, Western Himalaya). These veins are hosted in mylonitic phyllites, with a greenschist mineral assemblage made of quartz-white mica-biotite-chlorite-epidote and minor calcite and plagioclase. Within the veins two groups of isolated “early fluid” inclusions and trails of small secondary fluid inclusions have been observed. Two types of inclusions preserved in isolated groups have been petrographycally recognized: (i) a two liquids and a vapor phase (L 1 +L 2 +V) that is the most common type and (ii) a less frequent liquid and a vapor phase (L+V). Both types of fluid inclusions were investigated through optical microthermometric experiments. For “early fluid” inclusions, assuming a trapping temperature based on quartz dynamic recrystallization mechanisms and previous P-T estimates, in the range of 500 - 520 °C, a corresponding <b>trapping</b> <b>pressure</b> in the range of c. 0. 50 - 0. 53 GPa is estimated.

In Canada, river otters were present in all major waterways until at least the 18 th century (Toweill and Tabor, 1982).

Presently, river otters are found in every province and territory in Canada with the exception of Prince Edward Island.

River otters are also abundant along both the Pacific and Atlantic coasts where they have adapted to the coastal marine environment.

40|$|Feral cats devastate the Australian {{landscape}} {{and have been}} linked to a number of species extinctions through either predation or spread of diseases. Soft-catch leg-hold traps are routinely used to capture feral cats for research purposes or control, however by-catch is likely. Examination of by-catch data provided for six sites in Western Australia during the period 1997 - 2014 identified variability in by-catch across sites. This was attributed to differences in climate and landscape, the likely abundance of introduced predators prior to trapping and the experience of the trappers affecting when, where and how traps were set. Olfactory lures affected the taxonomy (with the exception of birds) of by-catch; reptiles were attracted to the PONGO lure (mix containing predator urine and faeces) used, but mammals were repelled. Reptiles may associate strong odours with food, while the mammals were cautious of the predatory species’ scent. Non-native by-catch were injured in traps less than the native by-catch most likely because they were generally better able to withstand the pressure from closing jaws. Amongst the native fauna; birds {{were more likely to be}} severely injured due to their morphology, behaviour and weight; amongst non-avian fauna species, the larger the captured individuals, the less likely they were to be injured due to their ability to better withstand the <b>trap</b> <b>pressure.</b> Injury to by-catch species poses animal ethics concerns, as approval to trap may be denied based on frequency and severity of injury to native and target species alike. It also raises concern for species of conservation significance that already have dwindling populations, such as the woylie, and can least afford the added threat from trapping. Future trapping exercises should proceed cautiously, with care taken in the timing of trapping, the placement of traps and the setting of traps (especially the treadle pressure needed to close the trap) to minimise the chance of by-catch and potential mortality. Additionally, by-catch welfare reports should be routinely prepared and examined to ensure best practice and on-going improvement...|$|E

40|$|Quartz-rich xenoliths in lavas (basalts to andesites; 90 - 30 ka) from Alicudi contain {{abundant}} melt {{and fluid}} inclusions. Two generations of CO 2 -rich fluid inclusions {{are present in}} quartz-rich xenolith grains: early (Type I) inclusions related to partial melting of the host xenoliths, and late Type II inclusions related to the fluid trapping during xenolith ascent. Homogenisation temperatures of fluid inclusions correspond to two density intervals: 0. 93 - 0. 68 g/cm 3 (Type I) and 0. 47 - 0. 26 g/cm 3 (Type II).

40|$|One of {{the most}} popular data sets in ecology, that of lynx fur returns, is {{analyzed}} in order to look for evidence for a bifurcation process.

The possibility for such a bifurcation was first proposed by Schaffer in 1985.

40|$|International audienceThe {{effects of}} oil {{cracking}} on fluorescence color, homogenization temperature (Tho) and <b>trapping</b> <b>pressure</b> (Pt) of oil inclusions from deeply buried reservoirs (DBRs) (3672 – 4359 m) {{in the northern}} Dongying Depression were determined based on fluorescence spectroscopy and homogenization temperatures of oil inclusions, kinetic modeling of crude oil cracking, and petroleum inclusion thermodynamics modeling. The modeling results demonstrate that fluorescence color, Tho and predicted Pt have strong relationships with the transformation rate via cracking of oil to gas (Tr), and the formation temperature (Tf) that the inclusions experienced. The fluorescence color is hardly influenced at all during {{the initial stages of}} oil cracking (Tr < 13 %, Tf < 160 °C), but fluorescence color begins to shift toward shorter wavelengths (blue shift) during progressive oil cracking (Tr < 24 %, Tf < 190 °C). With further oil cracking, the fluorescence color may either experience no change or continue its blue shift. Eventually the fluorescence color will disappear as the aromatic compounds are completely cracked. The Tho increases at first (Tr < 24 %, Tf < 190 °C), but then decreases or even becomes negative during major oil cracking. The reconstructed Pt values show a corresponding reverse trend. Oil inclusions from DBRs and other shallow reservoirs in the Dongying Depression show an obvious blue shift in fluorescence color at a depth of approximate 4000 m (Tf = 160 °C) and generally contain solid bitumen below 4000 m, supporting the effect of oil cracking on fluorescence variation, consistent with the modeling result. The Tho from DBRs in the Minfeng area increases with increasing burial depth (Tf < 190 °C), which is also consistent with the modeling results. However, the Tho of oil inclusions with blue-white fluorescence from DBRs in the Shengtuo area did not show such a trend. Recent <b>trapping,</b> high <b>trapping</b> <b>pressure</b> and higher-maturity oil may have led to a low-degree of oil cracking, and thus less modification of Tho in the Shengtuo area. Oil cracking results in consistent volume ratios of pyrobitumen to oil inclusions (Fvpy) in the same fluid inclusion assemblage, and the Fvpy value increases with oil cracking level, which can be used to recognize if oil cracking has occurred in oil inclusions and what level of oil cracking they have experienced. As the oil cracking model used in this study did not account for the role of pressure, it is more applicable for oil inclusions that were <b>trapped</b> under normally <b>pressured</b> conditions.

By performing new two-dimensional and general-relativistic simulations onto a rotating black hole, we point out a novel feature, namely, that quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) are naturally produced in the shock cone that develops in the downstream part of the flow.

We eval-uated a recovering fisher population in Ontario to test two conditions we viewed as necessary to support the hypoth-esis that fisher populations have increased due to an increase in the amount of forested land. First, we tested whether the amount of forested land has increased. Second, we tested whether contemporary fisher abundance (and therefore habitat quality) was related to the amount of forest. Topographic maps showed that the proportion of forested land in the study area had increased by 1. 9 % per decade since 1934 and 3. 3 % per decade since 1959, likely as a result of land conversion from agricultural uses.

40|$|International audienceSubduction of carbonated {{crust is}} widely {{believed}} to generate a flux of carbon into {{the base of the}} continental lithospheric mantle, which in turn is the likely source of widespread volcanic and non-volcanic CO 2 degassing in active tectonic intracontinental settings such as rifts, continental margin arcs and back-arc domains. However, the magnitude of the carbon flux through the lithosphere and the budget of stored carbon held within the lithospheric reservoir are both poorly known. We provide new constraints on the CO 2 budget of the lithospheric mantle below the Pannonian Basin (Central Europe) through the study of a suite of xenoliths from the Bakony-Balaton Highland Volcanic Field. Trails of secondary fluid inclusions, silicate melt inclusions, networks of melt veins, and melt pockets with large and abundant vesicles provide numerous lines of evidence that mantle metasomatism affected the lithosphere beneath this region. We obtain a quantitative estimate of the CO 2 budget of the mantle below the Pannonian Basin using a combination of innovative analytical and modeling approaches: (1) synchrotron X-ray microtomography, (2) NanoSIMS, Raman spectroscopy and microthermometry, and (3) thermodynamic models (Rhyolite-MELTS). The three-dimensional volumes reconstructed from synchrotron X-ray microtomography allow us to quantify the proportions of all petrographic phases in the samples and to visualize their textural relationships. The concentration of CO 2 in glass veins and pockets ranges from 0. 27 to 0. 96 wt. %, higher than in typical arc magmas (0 – 0. 25 wt. % CO 2), whereas the H 2 O concentration ranges from 0. 54 to 4. 25 wt. %, on the low end for estimated primitive arc magmas (1. 9 – 6. 3 wt. % H 2 O). <b>Trapping</b> <b>pressures</b> for vesicles were determined by comparing CO 2 concentrations in glass to CO 2 saturation as a function of pressure in silicate melts, suggesting pressures between 0. 69 to 1. 78 GPa. These values are generally higher than <b>trapping</b> <b>pressures</b> for fluid inclusions determined by Raman spectroscopy and microthermometry (0. 1 – 1. 1 GPa). The CO 2 /silicate melt mass ratios in the metasomatic agent that percolated through the lithospheric mantle below the Pannonian Basin are estimated to be between 9. 0 and 25. 4 wt. %, values consistent with metasomatism either by (1) silicate melts already supersaturated in CO 2 before reaching lithospheric depths or (2) carbonatite melts that interacted with mantle peridotite to generate carbonated silicic melts. Taking the geodynamical context of the Pannonian Basin and our calculations of the CO 2 /silicate melt mass ratios in the metasomatic agent into account, we suggest that slab-derived melts initially containing up to 25 wt. % of CO 2 migrated into the lithospheric mantle and exsolved CO 2 –rich fluid that became trapped in secondary fluid inclusions upon fracturing of the peridotite mineral matrix. We propose a first-order estimate of 2000 ppm as the minimal bulk CO 2 concentration in the lithospheric mantle below the Pannonian Basin. This transient carbon reservoir is believed to be degassed through the Pannonian Basin due to volcanism and tectonic events, mostly focused along the lithospheric-scale regional Mid-Hungarian shear Zone...|$|R

In calcite, {{hosted by the}} hydrothermal alteration zones and in a single recrystallized quartz porphyroblast, four different fluid inclusion assemblages are documented; the composition of these fluid inclusions provide p–T conditions of the fluid flow, and helps to define {{the origin of the}} fluids and evaluate their role in the remobilization and reprecipitation of the primary metamorphic sulfide assemblage. Pure CO 2 fluid inclusions were found as early inclusions in recrystallized quartz porphyroblast. These inclusions may have been trapped during the recrystallization of the quartz during the contact metamorphism of the footwall charnockite in the footwall of the SKI. The estimated <b>trapping</b> <b>pressure</b> (1. 6 – 2. 0 kbar) and temperature (810 – 920 °C) conditions correspond to estimates based on felsic veins in the basal zones of the South Kawishiwi intrusion. Fluid inclusion assemblages with CO 2 –H 2 O–NaCl and CH 4 –N 2 –H 2 O–NaCl compositions found in this study along healed microfractures in the recrystallized quartz porphyroblast establish the heterogeneous state of the fluids during entrapment. The estimated <b>trapping</b> <b>pressure</b> and temperature conditions (240 – 650 bar and 120 – 150 °C for CO 2 –H 2 O–NaCl inclusions and 315 – 360 bar and 145 – 165 °C for CH 4 –N 2 –H 2 O–NaCl inclusions) are significantly lower than the p–T conditions (> 700 °C and 1. 6 – 2 kbar) during the contact metamorphism, indicating that this fluid flow might not be related to the cooling of the Duluth Complex and its contact aureole. The presence of chalcopyrite inclusions in these fluid inclusions and in the trails of these fluid inclusion assemblages confirms that at least on local scale these fluids played a role in base metal remobilization. No evidences have been observed for PGE remobilization and transport in the samples. The source of the carbonic phase in the carbonic assemblages (CO 2; CH 4) could be the graphite, present in the metasedimentary hornfelsed inclusions in the basal zones of the South Kawishiwi intrusion. The hydrothermal veins in the charnockite can be characterized by an actinolite+cummingtonite+chlorite+prehnite+pumpellyite+calcite (I–II) +quartz mineral assemblage. Chlorite thermometry yields temperatures around 276 – 308 °C during the earliest phase of the fluid flow. In the late calcite (II) phase, high salinity (21. 6 – 28. 8 NaCl+CaCl 2 equiv. wt. %), low temperature (90 – 160 °C), primary aqueous inclusions were found. Chalcopyrite (±sphalerite±millerite), replacing and intersecting the early hydrothermal phases, are associated to the late calcite (II) phase. The composition of the formational fluids in the Canadian Shield is comparable with the composition of the studied fluid inclusions. This suggests that the composition of the fluids did not change in the past 2 Ga and base metal remobilization by formational fluids could have taken place any time after the formation of the South Kawishiwi intrusion. Sulfur isotope studies carried out on the primary metamorphic (δ 34 S= 7. 4 – 8. 9 ‰) and the hydrothermal sulfide mineral assemblage (δ 34 S= 5. 5 – 5. 7 ‰) proves, that during the hydrothermal fluid flow the primary metamorphic ores were remobilized...|$|R

Measurements are carried out by monitoring fragmentation efficiency of leucine enkephalin {{as a function of}} irradiation time by an infrared laser after a short excitation and incrementally increasing cooling periods. Cooling rates are observed to be directly related to bath gas pressure and inversely related to bath gas temperature. The cooling rate at typical ion <b>trap</b> operating <b>pressure</b> (1 mTorr) and temperature (room T) is faster than can be measured. At elevated temperature and the lowest pressure used for the studies, the rate of collisional cooling becomes negligible compared to the rate of radiative cooling...|$|R
40|$|River otters (Lontra canadensis) {{were one}} of the first {{resources}} to recover from the impact of the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill (EVOS) in Prince William Sound (PWS). Nonetheless, genetic evidence suggests that the numerical recovery of otters in oiled sites resulted from recolonization from adjacent areas rather than from local reproduction. Because increased <b>trapping</b> <b>pressure</b> on otters in recent years occurs mainly in non-oiled areas of PWS, previously-oiled sites may become important source locations for these animals. Whether otter reproduction has been attained in previously-oiled areas, however, is unknown. In this project we propose to determine whether reproduction was recovered in otter populations inhabiting previously-oiled areas of PWS, using genetic tools and non-invasive fecal sampling. In this project we will: 1. Estimate the abundance of river otters in previously-oiled and non-oiled areas in PWS via fecal DNA analysis and capture re-capture models to demonstrate that otter recovery is persistent. 2. Assess genetic structure of otter populations to determine the degree of gene flow among previously-oiled and non-oiled areas, and compare these estimates with those obtained in 1996 - 1998 (Blundell et al. 2002). 3. Evaluate relatedness of individuals within previously-oiled and non-oiled areas as a measure of local reproduction and compare these estimates with those obtained in 1996 - 1998. 4. Estimate emigration of individual otters from previously-oiled areas to non-oiled areas from fecal DNA analyses and GIS mapping to determine patterns of dispersal on the landscape. 1. Accomplishments to date: Since our previous report (03 / 31 / 2008) we have completed genotyping most of the viable samples (Kodiak (KOD; 2007) – 94; Katmai National Park and Preseve (KATM; 2005) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Packing {{pressure}} directly influences {{quality of}} the plastic part. It is an important stage of plastic injection molding. This paper introduces the packing process. CAE software Moldflow provided the possibility to simulate the flow process of the plastic air intake manifold at different pressure and to predict the position of air <b>traps.</b> Packing <b>pressure</b> is determined by comparing analysis results and avoided mold adjustment and mold repairing. Analytic result shows that packing pressure at 70 MPa can make the maximum injection pressure, melt flow rate, the required maximum clamp force smaller. And at that time, The air traps situation is also better. Practice proves that it is perfect of the finished sample of the plastic air intake manifold on basis of simulation...|$|R
40|$|The field {{stability}} {{of a mass}} spectrometer {{plays a crucial role}} in the accuracy of mass measurements. In the case of mass determination of short-lived nuclides with a Penning trap, major causes of fluctuations are temperature variations in the vicinity of the <b>trap</b> and <b>pressure</b> changes in the liquid helium cryostat of the superconducting magnet. Thus systems for the temperature and pressure stabilization of the Penning trap mass spectrometer ISOLTRAP at the ISOLDE facility at CERN have been installed. A reduction of the temperature and pressure fluctuations by at least an order of magnitude down to and has been achieved, which corresponds to a relative magnetic field change of ΔB/B= 2. 7 × 10 - 9 and 1. 1 × 10 - 10, respectively...|$|R
