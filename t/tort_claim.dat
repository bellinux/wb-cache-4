5|$|In her summation, however, Karros manages an {{effective}} damage control, pointing {{out to the}} jury that the case in question was not the past record of Varrick but solely the effects of Krayoxx, and that Finley & Figg has in no way proven a connection between Krayoxx {{and the death of}} their client's late husband. The jury is convinced and renders a very quick verdict totally rejecting the Krayoxx <b>tort</b> <b>claim</b> and giving Varrick their expected vindication. Still, Zinc's former colleagues of Rogan Rothberg express their grudging respect for his spirited cross-examination, and even help Zinc get even with an obnoxious blogger who had been ceaselessly maligning Zinc and Zinc's wife. Moreover, Karros keeps her promise and agrees to drop all the frivolous lawsuit and legal malpractice proceedings against Finley & Figg. Varrick has no special grudge against this small firm, though they intend to settle accounts with their old foe Alisandros and extract from him big sums on a frivolous lawsuit.|$|E
25|$|In one {{particular}} circumstance physicians, particularly psychiatrists, {{are held to}} a different standard than other defendants in a <b>tort</b> <b>claim.</b> Suicide is legally viewed as an act which terminates a chain of causality. Although the defendant may be held negligent for another's suicide, {{he or she is}} not responsible for damages which occur after the act. An exception is made for physicians. Although there exists no protocol or algorithm for predicting suicidality with any level of certainty, courts throughout the United States have found physicians to be negligent. Furthermore, damages are routinely assessed based on losses which would hypothetically accrue after the act of suicide.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{possible}} {{remedy for}} misrepresentation {{is that the}} misrepresentee may be entitled to rescind the contract. This means that the contract is [...] "taken back", {{as if it had}} never come into existence. The misrepresentee would then be entitled to compensation to put him back in the position as if the contract had not taken place. Rescission is distinct from termination of a contract, whereby a breach of a term cancels future performance, and only extinguishes the contract prospectively. For rescission the claimant may have a restitutionary remedy to recover any enrichment that a defendant has received under the contract (and in return give up any enrichment the claimant has received). The claimant may also have a <b>tort</b> <b>claim</b> for any losses that had arisen. In principle the rescission remedy is available for fraud and negligent misrepresentation as of right. For innocent misrepresentation, however, Misrepresentation Act 1967 s 2(2) gives the court discretion to award damages instead of rescission if undue hardship to the defendant would result. Part rescission is not yet available in England.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} analyzes {{court cases}} involving <b>tort</b> <b>claims</b> filed against Mississippi {{public schools and}} their employees under the Mississippi <b>Tort</b> <b>Claims</b> Act. The question addressed was: How have the Mississippi courts interpreted the Mississippi <b>Tort</b> <b>Claims</b> Act in litigation against Mississippi school districts and their employees? The intent of this dissertation is {{to add to the}} understanding of the legal concept of sovereign immunity as it has been applied to public schools and their employees. This study's focus centers on litigation in the state of Mississippi involving school districts. Chapter 2 provides a historical summary of sovereign immunity (also known as governmental immunity) in the United States and the state of Mississippi up to the enactment of the Mississippi <b>Tort</b> <b>Claims</b> Act as well as an overview of general legal concepts involved in <b>tort</b> <b>claims.</b> Chapter 3 explains the research design and methodology used. This dissertation relied on legal principles of research and document analysis used in the legal profession. Chapter 4 consists of a thorough analysis of published case law brought before the Mississippi courts pertaining to the Mississippi <b>Tort</b> <b>Claims</b> Act and public school systems and their employees. Finally, chapter 5 describes the key findings of the analysis of case law involving Mississippi school districts and their employees under the Mississippi <b>Tort</b> <b>Claims</b> Act...|$|R
2500|$|Counsel for Teo {{also argued}} that the purported {{amendments}} to Article 149 of the Constitution were contrary to the supreme law of the Constitution and thus were not valid amendments. Alternatively, if the Article 149 amendments were valid, the ISA amendments did not come within the legislative powers conferred by Article 149 and were thus void. Under Article 5(1), the Constitution may be amended by a law enacted by the Legislature. However, the purported Article 149 amendments were not a [...] "law" [...] {{within the meaning of}} Article 5(1), as they were an attempt by the Government to cause Teo's pending court proceedings (a <b>tort</b> <b>claim,</b> a judicial review application and the present habeas corpus application) to fail. Therefore, they amounted to judicial rather legislative action. Further, relying on the Indian Supreme Court cases Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala (1973), Minerva Mills Ltd. v. Union of India (1980) and P. Sambamurthy v. State of Andhra Pradesh (1986), Parliament's powers to amend the Constitution were limited by implied limitations derived from the basic structure of the Constitution itself. Since the Constitution was founded on the basis of separation of powers, Parliament was not empowered to amend the Constitution in a manner which acted retrospectively and allowed it to usurp judicial power, which amounted to judicial action.|$|E

40|$|The Supreme Court’s 1950 Feres v. United States {{decision}} {{held that}} when it enacted the Federal <b>Tort</b> <b>Claims</b> Act Congress {{did not intend to}} waive sovereign immunity for injuries to members of the military arising out of activity incident to their service. The Court’s decision was influenced by the long history of efforts to enact a general <b>tort</b> <b>claims</b> bill that would free Congress from the burden of processing claims against the government, as well as the case law, statutes, and procedures pertaining to service-members’ injuries prior to enactment of the Federal <b>Tort</b> <b>Claims</b> Act. This Article examines those influences and the early cases that analyzed the incident to service issue under the Act, including the Court’s Brooks decision that allowed service-member suits for injuries that did not arise incident to service. The Article reviews the lower courts’ decisions in the three cases that were consolidated in Feres and the parties’ briefing in the Supreme Court. The Article addresses arguments that have been raised against Feres’ reasoning, arguments that independently attack its holding, and various characterizations of the opinion. Because of the language of the Federal <b>Tort</b> <b>Claims</b> Act, the historical backdrop to the Court’s decision, and the absence of any indication that Congress intended to waive sovereign immunity for injuries suffered incident to service, Feres correctly decided that the Federal <b>Tort</b> <b>Claims</b> Act did not encompass such injuries...|$|R
