5|$|<b>The</b> <b>debate</b> <b>about</b> whether Tyrannosaurus was a {{predator}} or a pure scavenger {{is as old}} as <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> <b>about</b> its locomotion. Lambe (1917) described a good skeleton of Tyrannosaurus close relative Gorgosaurus and concluded that it and therefore also Tyrannosaurus was a pure scavenger, because the Gorgosaurus teeth showed hardly any wear. This argument is no longer taken seriously, because theropods replaced their teeth quite rapidly. Ever since the first discovery of Tyrannosaurus most scientists have speculated that it was {{a predator}}; like modern large predators it would readily scavenge or steal another predator's kill if it had the opportunity.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two main}} issues {{concerning}} the locomotory abilities of Tyrannosaurus: how well it could turn; and what its maximum straight-line speed was likely to have been. Both are relevant to <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> <b>about</b> {{whether it was a}} hunter or a scavenger.|$|E
5|$|The {{fossils of}} the Burgess Shale were hidden in store rooms until the 1960s. When Whittington {{and his colleagues}} first began to publish their Burgess finds in the early 1970s, the fossils became central to <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> <b>about</b> how quickly animals arose, and were {{interpreted}} as evidence that all the living bilaterian phyla {{had appeared in the}} Early Cambrian, along with many other phyla that had become extinct {{by the end of the}} Cambrian.|$|E

5|$|The hollow {{crest of}} Hypacrosaurus most likely had social functions, {{such as a}} visual signal {{allowing}} individuals to identify sex or species, and providing a resonating chamber for making noises.

5|$|All of McCain's {{family members}} are on good terms with him, and he has defended them {{against some of the}} {{negative}} consequences of his high-profile political lifestyle. His family's military tradition extends to the latest generation: son John Sidney IV ("Jack") graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 2009, becoming the fourth generation John S. McCain to do so, and is a helicopter pilot; son James served two tours with the Marines in the Iraq War; and son Doug flew jets in the navy. His daughter Meghan became a blogging and Twittering presence in <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> <b>about</b> the future of the Republican Party following the 2008 elections, and showed some of his maverick tendencies.|$|E
5|$|As the {{commercial}} application of molecular diagnostics {{has become more}} important, so has <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> <b>about</b> patenting of the genetic discoveries at its heart. In 1998, the European Union's Directive 98/44/ECclarified that patents on DNA sequences were allowable. In 2010 in the US, AMP sued Myriad Genetics to challenge the latter's patents regarding two genes, BRCA1, BRCA2, which are associated with breast cancer. In 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court partially agreed, ruling that a naturally occurring gene sequence could not be patented.|$|E

5|$|For {{many years}} Odontogriphus ("toothed riddle") was known from only one specimen, an almost featureless oval smear on a slab, with hints of tiny conical teeth. However, 189 new finds {{in the years}} {{immediately}} preceding 2006 made a detailed description possible. It had a pair of slightly V-shaped tooth-rows just ahead of the mouth, very like Wiwaxia′s. This pitched Odontogriphus into the middle of <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> <b>about</b> whether Wiwaxia was closer to the mollusc or the annelid lineage, resulting in a frank exchange of views.|$|E
5|$|The Jyllands-Posten Muhammad {{cartoons}} controversy (or Muhammad cartoons crisis) (Danish: Muhammedkrisen) {{began after}} the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten published 12 editorial cartoons on 30 September 2005, {{most of which}} depicted Muhammad, the principal figure of the religion of Islam. The newspaper announced {{that this was an}} attempt to contribute to <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> <b>about</b> criticism of Islam and self-censorship. Muslim groups in Denmark complained, and the issue eventually led to protests around the world, including violent demonstrations and riots in some Muslim countries.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>debate</b> <b>about</b> {{his place}} in the Conservative pantheon has {{continued}} since his death. Disraeli fascinated and divided contemporary opinion; he was seen by many, including some members of his own party, as an adventurer and a charlatan and by others as a far-sighted and patriotic statesman. As an actor on the political stage he played many roles: Byronic hero, man of letters, social critic, parliamentary virtuoso, squire of Hughenden, royal companion, European statesman. His singular and complex personality has provided historians and biographers with a particularly stiff challenge.|$|E

5|$|The {{executive}} {{summary of the}} TRC concluded that the assimilation amounted to cultural genocide. The ambiguity of the phrasing allowed for the interpretation that physical and biological genocide also occurred. The TRC was not authorized to conclude that physical and biological genocide occurred, as such a finding would imply a legal responsibility of the Canadian government that {{would be difficult to}} prove. As a result, <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> <b>about</b> whether the Canadian government also committed physical and biological genocide against Indigenous populations remains open.|$|E
5|$|There are {{numerous}} contemporary, or near-contemporary, {{sources of information}} about the reign of Richard III. These include the Croyland Chronicle, Commines' Mémoires, the report of Dominic Mancini, the Paston Letters, the Chronicles of Robert Fabyan and numerous court and official records, including a few letters by Richard himself. However, <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> <b>about</b> Richard's true character and motives continues, both because of the subjectivity of many of the written sources, reflecting the generally partisan nature of writers of this period, and {{because of the fact that}} none was written by men with an intimate knowledge of Richard, even if they had met him in person.|$|E
5|$|There are {{questions}} about the external validity of the AS diagnosis. That is, {{it is unclear whether}} there is a practical benefit in distinguishing AS from HFA and from PDD-NOS; the same child can receive different diagnoses depending on the screening tool. <b>The</b> <b>debate</b> <b>about</b> distinguishing AS from HFA is partly due to a tautological dilemma where disorders are defined based on severity of impairment, so that studies that appear to confirm differences based on severity are to be expected.|$|E

5|$|As {{a sitting}} president, Reagan {{did not have}} the highest {{approval}} ratings, but his popularity has increased since 1989. Gallup polls in 2001 and 2007 ranked him number one or number two when correspondents were asked for the greatest president in history. Reagan ranked third of post–World War II presidents in a 2007 Rasmussen Reports poll, fifth in an ABC 2000 poll, ninth in another 2007 Rasmussen poll, and eighth in a late 2008 poll by British newspaper The Times. In a Siena College survey of over 200 historians, however, Reagan ranked sixteenth out of 42. While <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> <b>about</b> Reagan's legacy is ongoing, the 2009 Annual C-SPAN Survey of Presidential Leaders ranked Reagan the 10th greatest president. The survey of leading historians rated Reagan number 11 in 2000.|$|E
