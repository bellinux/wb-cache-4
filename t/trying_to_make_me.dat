500|$|After the {{chequered}} flag fell, Lucas di Grassi's car {{stopped on}} the way back to pit lane. Once his car returned to parc fermé, it failed post-race scrutineering, and was found to have a modified front wing, leading to his disqualification. This meant that Jérôme d'Ambrosio was handed his first Formula E victory, moving him into fifth place in the drivers' championship. Nelson Piquet, Jr. recovered from his [...] "dismal" [...] qualifying performance to finish an eventual fourth, taking the championship lead. While e.dams Renault retained their lead in the teams' championship, the strong result for the Dragon Racing squad meant they moved up into second. The Abt team decided not to appeal the decision against Di Grassi, while emphasizing that the front wing did not lead to a performance advantage. Di Grassi himself responded on Twitter, writing: [...] "They are <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>me</b> win this championship in the hard mode. Don't worry, we will be back to kick some Piquet and Buemi ass on track." ...|$|E

2500|$|On a trip in Jerusalem, Rodriguez-Lopez {{purchased}} an archaic ouija-type talking {{board at}} a curio shop {{as a gift}} for Bixler-Zavala. They would return to their tour bus after shows to play with it during their 2006 tour with the Red Hot Chili Peppers, as it quickly became the band's post-show ritual. Dubbed [...] "The Soothsayer", the board revealed stories, gave names and made demands, as the band was contacted by three different people who appeared in the form of one, who was then referred to as [...] "Goliath". The more the band interacted with [...] "The Soothsayer", otherworldly coincidences began plaguing the band's experience writing and recording The Bedlam in Goliath: Blake Fleming, their drummer at the time, quit mid-tour and left the band with financial troubles; Bixler-Zavala wound up needing surgery performed on his foot due to the shoes he had been wearing, forcing him to relearn how to walk post-surgery; audio tracks sporadically disappeared from the studio's harddrives; Rodriguez-Lopez's home studio flooded and was subject to multiple power outages; and the album's original engineer went through a nervous breakdown, leaving behind all previous work with no notes as to where anything was. The engineer who quit stated to Rodriguez-Lopez: [...] "I'm not going to help you make this record. You're trying to do something very bad with this record, you're <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>me</b> crazy and you're trying to make people crazy." ...|$|E
