40|$|Introduction: Early {{excision}} {{and skin}} grafting {{has become the}} standard of good burn management, but it is associated with major blood loss. Aim: To determine the haemostatic effect of <b>terlipressin</b> compared with placebo. Material and methods: Fifty-one patients with bums of 10 - 20 % {{total body surface area}} had early excision and split skin grafting of deep burns. The surface area of the bum wound and of the heated graft were measured by planimetry. The patients were randomly allocated to medication, either <b>terlipressin</b> or placebo. Blood loss and number of transfused units of blood were recorded. Results: Twenty-one patients received <b>terlipressin,</b> 13 received <b>terlipressin</b> late (cross-over) and 17 received placebo. Six out of 21 patients exposed to <b>terlipressin</b> were transfused with eleven units of packed red blood cells. Seven out of 13 patients crossed over from placebo to <b>terlipressin</b> (late <b>terlipressin)</b> were transfused with 17 units of blood.

40|$|Use of <b>terlipressin</b> in {{septic shock}} {{relies on a}} series of European studies {{resulting}} in a better knowledge of this vasopressive agent.

40|$|Background: Controversy exists {{surrounding}} pharmacological {{therapy in}} acute variceal bleeding. Methods: To determine the efficacy {{and safety of}} <b>terlipressin.</b> Methods: Randomized trials were identified and duplicate, independent, review identified 20 randomized trials involving 1609 patients that compared <b>terlipressin</b> with placebo, balloon tamponade, endoscopic treatment, octreotide, somatostatin or vasopressin for treatment of acute oesophageal variceal haemorrhage. Results: Meta-analysis showed that compared to placebo, <b>terlipressin</b> reduced mortality (relative risk 0. 66, 95 % CI 0. 49 - 0. 88), failure of haemostasis (relative risk 0. 63, 95 % CI 0. 45 - 0. 89) {{and the number of}} emergency procedures per patient required for uncontrolled bleeding or rebleeding (relative risk 0. 72, 95 % CI 0. 55 - 0. 93). When used as an adjuvant to endoscopic sclerotherapy, <b>terlipressin</b> reduced failure of haemostasis (relative risk 0. 75, 95 % CI 0. 58 - 0. 96), and had an effect on reducing mortality that approached statistical significance (relative risk 0. 74, 95 % CI 0. 53 - 1. 04). No significant difference was demonstrated between <b>terlipressin</b> and endoscopic sclerotherapy, balloon tamponade, somatostatin or vasopressin. Haemostasis was achieved more frequently with octreotide compared to <b>terlipressin</b> (relative risk 1. 62, 95 % CI 1. 05 - 2. 50), but this result was based on unblinded studies. Adverse events were similar between <b>terlipressin</b> and the other comparison groups except for vasopressin, which caused more withdrawals due to adverse events. Conclusions: <b>Terlipressin</b> is a safe and effective treatment for acute oesophageal variceal bleeding, with or without adjuvant endoscopic sclerotherapy. <b>Terlipressin</b> appears to reduce mortality in acute oesophageal variceal bleeding compared to placebo, and is the only pharmacological agent shown to do so.

40|$|Purpose of review: Vasopressin and <b>terlipressin,</b> a long-acting V 1 a analogue, are {{increasingly}} used in intensive care.

In this review, we summarize {{the effects of these}} drugs on splanchnic hemodynamics and organ function. Recent findings: A recent systematic meta-analysis of randomized trials suggests that <b>terlipressin</b> may improve renal function in hepatorenal syndrome and thereby reduce mortality by 34 %. Moreover, a recent study reported that association of <b>terlipressin</b> and albumin was more effective than <b>terlipressin</b> alone.

Summary: The use of vasopressin and its synthetic analogues has shown beneficial effects in the management of patients with cirrhosis, especially in the context of variceal bleeding, the hepatorenal syndrome or both. In both cases, the use of <b>terlipressin</b> improved survival. Therefore, in these clinical indications, <b>terlipressin</b> is a part of recommendations.

40|$|<b>Terlipressin,</b> a long-acting vasopressinergic V 1 agonist, is {{increasingly}} used to increase mean arterial {{blood pressure in}} the common setting of catecholamine-refractory septic shock.
