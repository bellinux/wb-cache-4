25|$|The use {{of these}} custom {{character}} sets was generally incompatible between manufacturers. Unless a caller was using <b>terminal</b> <b>emulation</b> software written for, and running on, {{the same type of}} system as the BBS, the session would simply fall back to simple ASCII output. For example, a Commodore 64 user calling an Atari BBS would use ASCII rather than the machine's native character set. As time progressed, most terminal programs began using the ANSI standard, but could use their native character set if it was available.|$|E
25|$|Today, most BBS {{software}} {{that is still}} actively supported, such as Worldgroup, Wildcat! BBS and Citadel/UX, is Web-enabled, and the traditional text interface has been replaced (or operates concurrently) with a Web-based user interface. For those more nostalgic for the true BBS experience, one can use NetSerial (Windows) or DOSBox (Windows/*nix) to redirect DOS COM port software to telnet, allowing them to connect to Telnet BBSes using 1980s and 1990s era modem <b>terminal</b> <b>emulation</b> software, like Telix, Terminate, Qmodem and Procomm Plus. Modern 32-bit terminal emulators such as mTelnet and SyncTerm include native telnet support.|$|E

25|$|Monospaced fonts are typefaces {{in which}} every glyph is the same width (as opposed to variable-width fonts, where the w and m are wider than most letters, and the i is narrower). The first {{monospaced}} typefaces were designed for typewriters, which could only move the same distance forward with each letter typed. Their use continued with early computers, which could only display a single font. Although modern computers can display any desired typeface, monospaced fonts are still important for computer programming, <b>terminal</b> <b>emulation,</b> and for laying out tabulated data in plain text documents; {{they may also be}} particularly legible at small sizes due to all characters being quite wide. Examples of monospaced typefaces are Courier, Prestige Elite, Fixedsys, and Monaco. Most monospaced fonts are sans-serif or slab-serif as these designs are easiest to read printed small or display on low-resolution screens, though many exceptions exist.|$|E
2500|$|Since the {{keyboard}} was mechanically connected {{directly with the}} printer mechanism, keyboard character inputs were immediately typed by the printer mechanism, behavior called half-duplex {{by most of the}} computer industry. [...] However, IBM insisted on calling this behavior full duplex, causing much confusion. [...] If the computer system in turn echoed the typed input, having been configured to expect a full-duplex terminal, the echoed output would look something like tthhiiss.

5000|$|The Datapoint 2200 was a mass-produced {{programmable}} terminal, {{designed by}} Computer Terminal Corporation (CTC) founders Phil Ray and Gus Roche [...] and announced by CTC in June 1970 (with units shipping in 1971). It was presented by CTC {{simply as a}} versatile and cost-efficient terminal for connecting {{to a wide variety}} of mainframes by loading various <b>terminal</b> <b>emulations</b> from tape rather than being hardwired as most contemporary terminals, including their earlier Datapoint 3300. However, enterprising users in the business sector (including Pillsbury Foods) realized that this so-called [...] "programmable terminal" [...] was equipped to perform any task a simple computer could and exploited this fact by using their 2200s as standalone computer systems. Its industrial designer John [...] "Jack" [...] Frassanito has later claimed that Ray and Roche always intended the Datapoint 2200 to be a full-blown personal computer, but that they chose to keep quiet about this so as not to concern investors and others. Also significant is the fact that the terminal's multi-chip CPU (processor) became the basis of the x86 architecture used in the original IBM PC and its descendants.|$|R
40|$|Abstract â€” Mobile {{wireless}} emulation {{allows the}} test of real applications and transport protocols over a wired network mimicking {{the behavior of a}} mobile wireless network (nodes mobility, radio signal propagation and specific communication protocols). Two-stage IP-level network emulation consists in using a dedicated offline simulation stage to compute an IPlevel emulation scenario, which is played subsequently in the emulation stage. While this type of emulation allows the use of accurate computation models together with a large number of nodes, it currently does not allow to deal with dynamic changes of the real traffic. This lack of reactivity makes it impossible to emulate specific wireless behaviors such as hidden terminals in a realistic way. In this paper we address the need {{to take into account the}} real traffic during the emulation stage and we introduce a feedback mechanism. During the simulation several emulation scenarios are computed, each scenario corresponding to alternative traffic conditions related to e. g. occurrence or not of hidden <b>terminals.</b> During the <b>emulation</b> stage, the traffic is observed and the currently played emulation scenario can be changed according to specific network conditions. We propose a solution based on multiple scenarios generation, traffic observers and a feedback mechanism to add a trafficbased dynamic behavior to a two-stage emulation platform. The solution will be illustrated with a simple experiment based on hidden terminals. I...|$|R
