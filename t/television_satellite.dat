5|$|Russell Eugene Weston, Jr. (born December 28, 1956), {{also known}} as Rusty, grew up in Valmeyer, Illinois. Weston {{attended}} Valmeyer High School, the only high school in a town of 900 people. Shortly after graduating high school in 1974, Weston moved to Rimini, Montana, rarely returning to Valmeyer. The only attempt his high school classmates made at inviting him to a class reunion was returned with obscenities written across it. Many of Weston's Montana neighbors had disliked him, and often ignored him. They considered him to be unusual, and sometimes eccentric. Weston had once thought that his neighbor was using his <b>television</b> <b>satellite</b> dish to spy on his actions and believed Navy SEALs were hiding in his cornfield.|$|E

5000|$|The term Television receive-only, or TVRO, arose {{during the}} early days of <b>satellite</b> <b>television</b> {{reception}} to differentiate it from commercial <b>satellite</b> <b>television</b> uplink and downlink operations (transmit and receive). This was the primary method of <b>satellite</b> <b>television</b> transmissions before the <b>satellite</b> <b>television</b> industry shifted, with the launch of higher powered DBS satellites in the early 1990s which transmitted their signals on the Ku band frequencies. <b>Satellite</b> <b>television</b> channels at that time were intended to be used by cable television networks rather than received by home viewers. Early <b>satellite</b> <b>television</b> receiver systems were largely constructed by hobbyists and engineers. These early TVRO systems operated mainly on the C-band frequencies and the dishes required were large; typically over 3 meters (10 ft) in diameter. Consequently, TVRO {{is often referred to as}} [...] "big dish" [...] or [...] "Big Ugly Dish" [...] (BUD) <b>satellite</b> <b>television.</b>|$|R
2500|$|In {{the case}} Fullowka et al. v. Royal Oak Ventures Inc, {{held in the}} {{aftermath}} of an 18-month strike at Royal Oak Mines in Yellowknife, the CAW was originally held responsible for 22% of damages at trial, before CAW was successful on appeal. The trial judge found that the union breached its duty of care by doing nothing to stop illegal acts during the strike, paying fines and legal fees for striking miners, providing a person to assist the miners' union who prolonged the strike, and failing to bargain in good faith. At trial, the court ruled that the cumulative effect of these breaches of the duty of care were found to have materially contributed to Roger Warren's bombing of the mine, which killed nine strikebreaking workers. Warren, a union member who had been fired from Royal Oak, testified that he was only capable of the bombing because strike-breakers had been [...] "dehumanized" [...] by the union and was sentenced to life in prison. However, these findings of liability were overturned on appeal by the Northwest Territories Court of Appeal and a decision by the Supreme Court of Canada was dismissed. Furthermore, CAW members Al Shearing and Tim Bettger were sentenced to two and a half and three years in prison, respectively. Both were convicted of painting anti-scab graffiti and setting an explosion in a ventilation shaft on June 29, 1992. Bettger was sentenced to an additional six months in prison for blowing a hole in a <b>television</b> <b>satellite</b> dish September 1 of that year. (The unioned miners were part of the Canadian Association of Smelter and Allied Workers union (CASAW) Local 4 {{at the time of the}} strike, and merged into the CAW on May 1994.) ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the development of}} <b>satellite</b> <b>television</b> in the Asian countries and their policy change.

In response to competition posed by <b>satellite</b> <b>television,</b> policy makers generally choose to deregulate their local television market {{in the hope that the}} quality of local television will improve through competition. The authors suggest that <b>satellite</b> <b>television</b> in Asia is likely to agglomerate the diverse markets into bigger cultural markets to gain the economy of scale. <b>Satellite</b> <b>television</b> will bring about a regional capitalist culture. Professional journalism modelled after the West may also grow. The general trend for Asia is towards further deregulation and greater openness. ...|$|R
