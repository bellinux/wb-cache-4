40|$|Evaluation of university-based {{research}} {{already has}} a reasonably long tradition in the UK, but proposals to revise the framework for national evaluation aroused controversy in the academic community because they envisage assessing more explicitly than before the economic, social and cultural ‘impact’ of research {{as well as its}} scientific quality. Using data from the 2009 public consultation on the proposals for a Research Excellence Framework, this paper identifies three main lines of controversy: the threats to academic autonomy implied in the definition of expert review and the delimitation of reviewers, the scope for boundary-work in the construction of impact narratives and case studies, and <b>the</b> <b>framing</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> translation by the stipulation that impact ‘builds on’ research. Given the behaviour-shaping effects of research evaluation, the paper demonstrates how the proposed changes could help embed impact considerations among the routine reflexive tools of university researchers and enhance rather than restrict academic autonomy at the level of research units. It also argues that the REF could constitute an important dialogical space for negotiating science–society relations in an era of increasing heteronomy between academia, state and industry. But the paper raises doubts about whether the proposed operationalisation of impact is adequate to evaluate the ways that research and knowledge translation are actually carried out...|$|E

There are several perspectives {{and one of them}} is derived form Anthroplogy. In this sense, communication is considered as having holistic character and concern in interpretive activities. In this regards, communication is contextualized by culture. Therefore as well culture is unique, communication is also unique. There are several kinds of contribution of Anthropology in the development of communication theories which can be traced. First, structural linguistic as the branch study of linguistic anthropology contributes in semiotics studies. As well, sociolinguistic contributes to understand the relationsip between social reality and culture. Second, in the area of historical archeology, the contrubition of Anthropology is represented in <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> on unwritten communication activities.

40|$|In {{this essay}} I {{focus on the}} text Creative Evolution (1907) and show that {{although}} Bergson intended {{to make a contribution}} to the science of biology and to the philosophy of life, the primary aim of the text is to show the need for a fundamental reformation of philosophy. Bergson wants to show how, through an appreciation of the evolution of life, philosophy can expand our perception of the universe. I examine in detail the two essential claims he makes in the text: first, that we have to see the theory <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> and the theory of life as deeply related; second, {{that there is a need}} to “think beyond the human condition” or human state. Indeed, Bergson conceives philosophy as the discipline that “raises us above the human condition” and makes the effort to “surpass” it. This reveals itself to be something of an extraordinary endeavour since it means bringing the human intellect into rapport with other kinds of consciousness. Moreover, if we do not place our thinking about the nature, character, and limits <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> within the context of the evolution of life then we risk uncritically accepting the concepts that have been placed at our disposal. It means we think within pre-existing frames. We need, then, to ask two questions: first, how has the human intellect evolved?, and second, how can we enlarge and go beyond <b>the</b> <b>frames</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> available to us...|$|R

The project of the DOL water canal is evaluated with using GIS methods and reference assessment of environmental effects. Biogeographic differentiation of the landscape in a biogeocenological concept have been also utilized in this paper. The presented paper has shown the possibilities of use of the GIS analysis {{for the assessment of}} the assumed effect of the DOL project on the hydrological regime of floodplain forests. It has been proven that this method is much more efficient in objectivizing the presupposed influences of the DOL canal on the water regime of floodplain forests than the previous assessments. The method employed in this paper {{for the purposes of the}} preliminary percentage quantification of the extent of the hydrological in­fluen­ce on individual types of geobiocoenoses of floodplain forests is used generally for the purposes of the environmental assessment of effects on investment plans concerning the landscape (the so-called EIA). It is clear that the assessment of the influences of the DOL project on floodplain forest geobiocoenoses primarily concerns the response of vegetation to changes in the soil moisture regime, which can be compared to the amount of data material (for a summary see PRAX et al., 2008).

In particular some organogold(III) compounds manifested quite attractive pharmacological behaviors in preclinical studies. Here we compare the chemical and biological properties of the novel organogold(III) complex [Au(bipydmb−H) (NH(CO) CH 3) ][PF 6] (Aubipyaa) with those of its parent compounds [Au(bipydmb−H) (OH) ][PF 6] (Aubipyc) and [Au 2 (bipydmb−H) 2) (μ−O) ][PF 6] 2 (Au 2 bipyc), previously synthesized and characterized. The three study compounds were comparatively assessed for their antiproliferative actions against HCT- 116 cancer cells, revealing moderate cytotoxic effects. Proapoptotic and cell cycle effects were also monitored. Afterward, to gain additional mechanistic insight, the three gold compounds were challenged against the model proteins HEWL, RNase A and cytochrome c and reactions investigated through UV–Vis and ESI–MS analysis.

40|$|Platinum-based {{chemotherapy}} is {{the primary}} treatment for human ovarian cancer. Overcoming platinum resistance has become a critical issue in the current chemotherapeutic strategies of ovarian cancer as drug resistance {{is the main reason}} for treatment failure. Cytotoxic gold compounds hold great promise to reach this goal; however, their modes of action are still largely unknown. To shed light on the underlying molecular mechanisms, we performed 2 -DE and MS analysis to identify differential protein expression in a cisplatin-resistant human ovarian cancer cell line (A 2780 /R) following treatment with two representative gold compounds, namely Auranofin and Auoxo 6. It is shown that Auranofin mainly acts by altering the expression of Proteasome proteins while Auoxo 6 mostly modifies proteins related to mRNA splicing, trafficking and stability. We also found that Thioredoxin-like protein 1 expression is greatly reduced after treatment with both gold compounds. These results are highly indicative of the likely sites of action of the two tested gold drugs and of the affected cellular functions.

40|$|The {{designing}} of computer-based artefacts {{to support}} knowledge work {{is far from}} a straightforward rational process. Characteristics <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> work have a bearing upon how developers (or designers), together with users, come to approach and capture the rich and tacit knowing of the practice. As all knowledge work is about the production <b>of</b> <b>knowledge,</b> transforming it, so is the design practice for developing artefacts to occupy space within that same practice. There is a need for providing a conceptual language to better reflect the nature of this design work that goes beyond those dressed in the managerial (or rational) language of planned activities and deliverables. Towards this end, a conceptual frame is presented that makes several important aspects of the design practice visible. <b>The</b> <b>frame</b> brings together both nature of design work and characteristics <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> work to extend <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> in user-developer communication of Kensing and Munk-Madsen. Thereby, providing a means to focus attention and dress debate on what situated designing is. By using explicit concepts, such as types knowledge domains embedded in the design situation, the transitional paths between them, and design engagements, it arms practitioners with specific linguistic constructs to direct attention and efforts in planning and organizing development undertakings. Purpose – the purpose of this work is to present and argue for a perspective on designing of computer-based artefacts supporting knowledge work. This is done to inform practitioners, directing their attention and dressing debate, and providing a conceptual language to better capture design activities in planning and organizing development undertakings. Design/Methodology/Approach – The approach presented in this article is conceptual in so far that a model or frame providing linguistic constructs is constructed and argued, building upon scholarly work <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> communication and drawing upon previous findings from empirical encounters. Findings – A conceptual frame is presented that captures the design situation as a situated knowledge communication process. Research limitations/implications – <b>The</b> conceptual <b>frame</b> presented remains yet to be validated in practical application. This may be achieved either using it as a lens to uncover and explain phenomena in similar design work, thereby putting its explanatory power to the test, or using it to direct future development undertakings, thereby putting its predictive power to the test. Practical implications – The practical implications <b>of</b> <b>the</b> design <b>frame</b> lies in its power to provide linguistic constructs to direct one’s effort in planning and organizing development undertakings, and in extension to provide argument for decision-makers allocating resources. Originality/Value – By extending the model <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> communication <b>of</b> Kensing and Munk-Madsen, and framing it within a situated design context, it better reflects characteristics <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> work, providing practitioners with the means to better organize design activities.

By the application of Bernstein's ideas on <b>the</b> classification and <b>framing</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge,</b> <b>the</b> paper argues that using ICTs at home can support learning that may be formal, informal, quasi-formal or incidental. The final part of the paper identifies some of the 'informal learning practices' that are available to young people when learning enters the home in this way. These informal learning practices, it is argued, increase their sense of agency in relation to their learning and therefore potentially make learning a richer and more fulfilling experience. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC...|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} the early {{results of the}} Frame+Schema project, a project to repre-sent image and force-dynamic schemas in FrameNet. These structures are eventually intended {{to be used in}} leveraging <b>the</b> wealth <b>of</b> <b>frame</b> semantic <b>knowledge</b> available in the FrameNet database for situation-specific reasoning. We detail our image and force-dynamic schemas in the Embodied Construction Grammar formalism and give corre-spondence rules to represent these schemas in FrameNet. We also analyze much of the current force-dynamic structure in the FrameNet database and suggest changes to make it more compatible with image and force-dynamic schema-based inference. We note many of the issues raised by our representation as well as the unsolved problems and also make proposals for future work in the Frame+Schema project. ∗This would be far worse if not for the many suggestions of the others at the Frame+Schema meetings: Jerry Feld...|$|R
