40|$|In {{the last}} 20 years, studies on human {{identified}} skeletal collections have {{revealed a significant}} relationship between new bone formation on the visceral surface of ribs and pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). To improve methods of differential diagnosis of respiratory diseases in archaeological skeletons, an investigation was conducted on 197 individuals from the Human Identified Skeletal Collection of the Museu Bocage (Lisbon, Portugal). This sample included 109 males and 88 females who lived during the 19 th- 20 th centuries, with ages at death ranging from 13 - 88 years. The skeletons were grouped according to cause of death: 1) pulmonary TB (N = 84); 2) pulmonary non-TB diseases (N = 49); and 3) a control group (N = 64) composed of individuals randomly selected among the extrapulmonary non-TB causes of death. The ribs, sterna, scapulae, and clavicles were macroscopically observed. New bone formation on the visceral surface of ribs was recorded in 90. 5 % (76 / 84) of individuals who died from pulmonary TB, in 36. 7 % (18 / 49) with a pulmonary non-TB disease as cause of death, and in 25. 0 % (16 / 64) of the control group. These differences were statistically significant (P < 0. 001). Furthermore, in individuals with pulmonary TB, the bony lesions presented mainly as lamellar bone on the vertebral end of the upper and middle <b>thoracic</b> rib <b>cage.</b> Proliferative alterations also occurred on one sternum and in nine clavicles and eight scapulae. This work strongly supports the results of similar studies performed on other documented collections, suggesting that new bone formation on ribs, although not pathognomonic, is a useful criterion for the differential diagnosis of pulmonary TB.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{efficiency}} of multiplanar reformatted images and threedimensional images created after multidetector computed tomography examination in detecting acute posttraumatic osseous pathology of the skeletal system. METHOD: Between October 2006 and December 2008, 105 patients with a history of acute trauma were referred to our service. Patients were evaluated with multidetector computed tomography using multiplanary reconstructed images initially (R-I), and six months after this initial evaluation, three-dimensional images were assessed of each patient (R-II). Axial images were used for guiding as a reference Data obtained was recorded and graded according to importance levels of the pathologies. RESULTS: The R-II score was higher in the non-articular and highest in periartricular fractures of the extremities, and <b>thoracic</b> and pelvic <b>cage</b> injuries. For the spinal column, while R-I data was more significant In patients referred with polytrauma, R-II data, was more statistically significant, for short processing and adaptation time to acquiring immediate critical information. For all cases it was seen that three dimensional scans were more efficient in providing the orientation, within a short time. CONCLUSION: By dual source multidedector tomography systems trauma patients may be evaluated by multiplanary and three dimensionally reconstructed images. When used correctly, three dimensional imaging is advantageous and can help determine the exact nature and extension and also importance of osseous injuries...|$|R

Additionally, the clavicle takes care of medial forces. In cursorial mammals (for example the horse and other quadrupeds), the scapula is hanging vertically {{on the side of}} the thorax and the clavicle is absent. Therefore, in climbing animals, the serratus anterior supports the scapula against the reaction forces of the free limb and exerts high bending forces on the ribs. To sustain these forces, the ribs have a pronounced curvature and are supported by the clavicle. In cursorial animals, the thorax is hanging between the scapulae at the serratus anterior and pectoralis muscles.|$|E
40|$|Elderly individuals, obese individuals, {{and females}} all have {{greater risk of}} rib {{fractures}} and other associated thoracic injuries than younger mid-sized male adults in motor vehicle crashes. Differences in body morphology between these vulnerable populations and the subjects represented by physical or computational human body models is a potential source for this risk disparity, and efforts are required to quantify these differences {{in order to protect}} a wider population. We present a novel parametric shape model of the human rib centroidal path using logarithmic spirals. It provides a more accurate and efficient fit than previous models of overall rib geometry, and it utilizes direct geometric properties such rib size, aspect ratio, and "skewness" in its parameterization. The model was fitted to 21, 124 ribs from 1000 adult CT scans, and regression analyses produced a flexible rib shape model to build ribs typical for any population of a given age, height, weight, and sex. Significant differences in rib shape were quantified across populations, and a new aging effect was uncovered whereby rib span and rib aspect ratio are seen to increase with age, producing characteristically shallower and flatter overall rib shapes in elderly populations. This effect was more strongly and directly associated with age than previously documented age-related changes in rib angulation. Simulated mechanical loading of ribs showed that the specific changes in shape found with age also had implications on their ability to resist deformation. Stiffness to body-anterior loading was seen to increase with age by up to 30 % across a 70 -year age difference. Finally, we place ribs into their appropriate thoracic context by building a similar parametric model of the surrounding skeleton. A modular approach is used that ensures accuracy in key geometric measures, and results show the accumulated effects on overall chest shape that come from individual variations in the ribs, spine, sternum, and their relative positions. This study can be used to help build population-specific computational models of the <b>thoracic</b> rib <b>cage.</b> Furthermore, results provide quantitative population corridors for rib shape parameters which can be used to improve the assessment and treatment of rib skeletal deformity and disease...|$|R

In {{this work}} we {{have studied the}} relationship between biochemical metabolic parameters (of dogs) and body score, fasting and feeding. In order to evaluate the glycemia values, using a digital (portable) glucometer, it was used 6 &# 956;L of venous and capillary blood. On the other hand, when we evaluated the glycemia, through enzymatic method (laboratory), only venous blood was used. To analyze the metabolic curve we have collected blood samples of fasting dogs and 0 : 30, 1 : 30, 3 : 00, 6 : 00, 9 : 00, and 12 : 00 hours after feeding with premium industrial food. The laboratorial analysis were realized by enzymatic determination through colorimetry. In order to correlate the body scores and dogs morphometry, we have defined the body score, the body mass index (BMI), and the average values of cutaneous fat at the right rib <b>cage,</b> <b>thoracic,</b> and tail base regions. Also, we have measured the thoracic and inguinal circumference ratio. To compare the body scores with the metabolism of carbohydrates and lipids the dogs were classified, according to their weight, as ideal weighted, overweighted and obese. We have measured the glycemia, cholesterol (total and fractions), and triglycerides. The glycemia average values, obtained with the portable glucometer, of capillary and venous blood were similar. The glycemic, VLDL fraction, and triglyceride levels are changed after feeding, while the other analyzed parameters (total cholesterol, HDL and LDL fractions) are not. The obese dogs presented higher BMI and subcutaneous fat values and lower circumference ratio values, {{when compared with the}} ideal weighted and overweighted ones. The VLDL fraction and triglyceride values were higher when measured at the obese dogs.

50|$|The {{rib cage}} is an {{arrangement}} of bones in the thorax of all vertebrates except the lamprey and the frog. It is formed by the vertebral column, ribs, and sternum and encloses the heart and lungs. In humans, the rib cage, {{also known as the}} <b>thoracic</b> <b>cage,</b> is a bony and cartilaginous structure which surrounds the thoracic cavity and supports the pectoral girdle (shoulder girdle), forming a core portion of the human skeleton. A typical human rib cage consists of 24 ribs, the sternum (with xiphoid process), costal cartilages, and the 12 thoracic vertebrae. Together with the skin and associated fascia and muscles, the rib cage makes up the thoracic wall and provides attachments for the muscles of the neck, thorax, upper abdomen, and back.|$|E

On physical examination, the patient {{may have the}} classic “Beck’s triad” - hypotension, raised JVP and distant heart sounds, when complicated by cardiac tamponade. Extension of the mediastinal air to the subcutaneous tissues via the fascial planes may lead to subcutaneous emphysema. When air and fluid mix together in the pericardial sac, a tinkling sound superimposed over a succussion splash is heard. This {{is known as a}} “Bruit de Moulin”, which is French for “Mill-wheel” murmur.

However, as one rises above sea level the density of the air decreases exponentially (see Fig. 14), halving approximately with every 5500 m rise in altitude. Since the composition of the atmospheric air is almost constant below 80 km, {{as a result of the}} continuous mixing effect of the weather, the concentration of oxygen in the air (mmols O2 per liter of ambient air) decreases at the same rate as the fall in air pressure with altitude. Therefore, in order to breathe in the same amount of oxygen per minute, the person has to inhale a proportionately greater volume of air per minute at altitude than at sea level. This is achieved by breathing deeper and faster (i.e. hyperpnea) than at sea level (see below).|$|E

However, this was not compared to the previously established gold standard (CT scan), and there is currently no direct practical application of the EOS® system for pulmonary evaluation of spinal deformity patients. Moreover, 3 D rib cage reconstruction using the EOS® system is still not available for regular EOS® users, as it is still under evaluation and therefore not commercialized.|$|E

40|$|Development of {{the spine}} and <b>thoracic</b> <b>cage</b> {{consists}} of a complex series of events involving multiple metabolic processes, genes and signaling pathways. During growth, complex phenomena occur in rapid succession. This succession of events, this establishment of elements, is programmed according to a hierarchy. These events are well synchronized to maintain harmonious limb, spine and <b>thoracic</b> <b>cage</b> relationships, as growth in the various body segments does not occur simultaneously at the same magnitude or rate. In most severe cases of untreated progressive early-onset spinal deformities, respiratory insufficiency and pulmonary and cardiac hypertension (cor pulmonale), which characterize thoracic insufficiency syndrome (TIS), can develop, sometimes leading to death. TIS is {{the inability of the}} thorax to ensure normal breathing. This clinical condition can be linked to costo-vertebral malformations (e. g., fused ribs, hemivertebrae, congenital bars), neuromuscular diseases (e. g., expiratory congenital hypotonia), Jeune or Jarcho-Levin syndromes or to 50 % to 75 % fusion of the thoracic spine before seven years of age. Complex spinal deformities alter normal growth plate development, and vertebral bodies become progressively distorted, perpetuating the disorder. Therefore, many scoliotic deformities can become growth plate disorders over time.
