40|$|An {{operator}} can {{rapidly and}} automatically produce coded electrical signals by manipulating mechanical <b>thumb</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>switches</b> {{so as to}} instruct a service center to connect any number of telephone lines to the console thus enabling the operator to listen and/or talk over several lines simultaneously. The system includes an on-site console having several mechanically operated <b>thumb</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>switches</b> to which the desired lines to be connected can be dialed in. Electrical coded signals are fed {{to a number of}} banks of line AND gates representing units, tens and hundreds, a group of channel gates, and a command gate. These signals are gated out in a controlled manner to an encoder which generates tones that are transmitted over a single line to a communication service center...|$|R

50|$|The Nikon F70 (or N70 as it {{is known}} in the U.S.) was a SLR camera {{manufactured}} by the Japanese Company Nikon. Introduced in 1994, it is the predecessor to the Nikon F80. This camera is known for its unusual user interface which uses a combination of function and set buttons along with the <b>thumb</b> <b>wheel</b> to navigate the nestled settings. It is quite different compared to other Nikon SLR's of the same era.|$|R
5000|$|Customized App: A step up {{from this}} {{approach}} is to render each (or all) reports and dashboards in device-specific format. In other words, provide information specific to the screen size, optimize usage of screen real estate, and enable device-specific navigation controls. Examples of these include <b>thumb</b> <b>wheel</b> or <b>thumb</b> button for BlackBerry, up/down/left/right arrows for Palm, gestural manipulation for iPhone. This approach requires more effort than the previous but no additional software.|$|R
25|$|Changes include: {{intelligent}} cruise control, lane departure prevention, lane departure warning, forward collision warning, {{front seat}} emergency brake sensing pre-crash seat belt, intelligent brake assist, steering <b>wheel</b> <b>switches</b> (audio navigation, voice command, hands-free phone, intelligent cruise control, lane departure prevention) become standard equipment.|$|R
2500|$|The <b>thumb</b> <b>wheel</b> on {{the ribbon}} {{cartridge}} and the correction tape spools were color-coded {{so they could}} be easily identified and matched with the appropriate correction tapes: Yellow for the correctable film ribbon and Lift-Off tape; gray, pink, and blue for cloth, carbon film, and Tech-3, respectively. Later another type of correctable film ribbon and lift-off tape appeared, both color-coded orange. The yellow meant the ribbon was a higher quality and would produce a better quality type image. [...] Orange was a lower cost ribbon for everyday typing. The yellow and orange coded lift-off tapes would work with either ribbon type.|$|R

5000|$|Upon {{arrival at}} {{a parking lot}} {{requiring}} parking disc, the parking disc is set and put on display behind the front windshield. The disc has a <b>thumb</b> <b>wheel</b> (or knurling wheel) at the upper side that makes the clock face turn around its center point, allowing it to show different clock times. The standard parking clock can show a full twelve hours, with additional marks for each half-hour. The time to be set is rounded up from the actual arrival time, for example a 10:00:01 arrival would be set to 10:30, while a 10:29:59 arrival would also be set to 10:30. The legal requirements are that [...] "parking is allowed when the vehicle shows a parking disc that is easily readable from the outside and whose clockhand points to {{the mark of the}} half hour that follows the time of arrival".|$|R
25|$|The {{guideway}} was uni-directional, {{with all}} vehicles {{traveling around the}} airport in a counter-clockwise direction. The top of guideway walls contained rails that steered the vehicles. Small urethane wheels {{on either side of}} the vehicle engaged the rail and were mechanically linked to a conventional steering suspension on the main <b>wheels.</b> <b>Switching</b> was provided by switching bars {{on either side of the}} guideway that raised or lowered to trap one of the two sets of guidance wheels under them. The switch was adapted from existing fail-safe switches used on railways.|$|R
40|$|A {{microprocessor}} controlled programmable {{pulse generator}} was {{specifically designed to}} interface with the JEOL JNM-FT- 1 A Radio Frequency (RF) section of a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer. The programmable pulse generator was programmed and controlled by an IBM compatible computer. Statis rams were utilized as the programmable pulse generator 2 Ì† 7 s on board memory which were used to store the pulse sequences. Pulse widths can be programmed from 0. 2 microseconds to 14. 3 minutes. The JEOL RF section is unique in that it allows the pulse generator to control the phase of the RF transmitted to the NMR probe and whether the sample will be decoupled. These two items set this programmable pulse generator apart from other pulse generators described in the literature and those systems which are commercially available. This programmable pulse generator was constructed to replace the old JEOL <b>thumb</b> <b>wheel</b> controlled pulse generator. Typical 180 degree pulse lengths for the JEOL NMR are approximately 20 microseconds...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Equiped with an {{electronic}} differential function in double wheel or four wheel electric vehicle drive, it must be driven by motor torque control precisely. Due to the nonlinear characteristics of the motor when the <b>wheels</b> <b>switched</b> reluctance motor drive, {{it is difficult to}} ensure motor torque and phase current relationship by the theoretical approach. This paper puts forward the experimental methods to get the different speed motor torque and given the relationship between the current, so as to make table, according to the rotation of the motor speed and torque requirements, the accurate switched reluctance motor torque control through given the current value in the future of the electric vehicle...|$|R

50|$|Some low floor {{streetcar}} designs use split axles (a separate half-axle for {{the wheel}} {{on each side}} of the car). Such streetcars are unsuitable for use with single-point switches as there would be no mechanism to transfer the force from the inner to outer <b>wheels</b> at <b>switches.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Bohrman's Mill is a water-powered {{gristmill}} {{built in}} 1815 in Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania. The mill was located {{outside the town}} of Orwigsburg, along Mahonney Creek, which flows from Second Mountain. The mill was primarily used for grinding corn meal and hulling oats, using a 20-foot overshot water <b>wheel,</b> later <b>switching</b> to a turbine system.|$|R
40|$|Many {{electronic}} applications require multiple regulated supply voltages {{to cater}} for needs {{from the different}} function modules inside. A new single-inductor multiple-output (SIMO) switching converter is designed to operate in pseudo-continuous conduction mode (PCCM) with free <b>wheel</b> <b>switching,</b> and can efficiently handles such needs. Existing SIMO switching converter work either in continuous conduction mode (CCM) or discontinuous conduction mode (DCM). CCM SIMO converters suffer from cross-regulation problems and possible negative inductor current at light loads. DCM SIMO converters have large peak currents and are not suitable for large loads. By employing freewheel switching control, this new PCCM SIMO converter can handle large stress at heavy loads with a smaller peak current while retaining low cross-regulation. It therefore solves {{the problems associated with}} previous designs. Flexibility to work in DCM at light load is also added to this design to retain high efficiency. The reliability and noise immunity of the system are thus greatly improved...|$|R

When enclosed, the cab may also be equipped with a cab heater for cold climate countries along with a fan or air conditioning for hot weather.|$|R
50|$|Also in 1968, Omega transitioned {{the caliber}} 321 {{movement}} to the new caliber 861, also designed by Albert Piguet, {{with the introduction of}} the reference 145.022 Speedmaster. The 861 was very similar to the 321, but replaced its column <b>wheel</b> <b>switching</b> mechanism with a cam and increased the beat rate from 18,000 to 21,600 vibrations per hour. Most Speedmaster Professional watches from 1968 to the present have used variants of this movement, including the modern rhodium-plated caliber 1861 and decorated exhibition calibers 863 and 1863. A standard Speedmaster Professional model with Plexiglas crystal, solid caseback with anti-vibration and anti-magnetic dust cover, tachymeter scale, without date or day complications, and powered by a caliber 861-based movement has been continuously produced since. The tritium-powered phosphorescent lume on the hands and index markers of the original watches were replaced {{at the end of the}} 1990s with non-radioactive pigments, but the fundamental design, dimensions, and mechanism of these watches have remained unchanged. In this form, the basic Speedmaster line has remained flight-qualified for NASA space missions and EVAs, after re-evaluation by NASA in 1972 and for use in the Space Shuttle program in 1978. The current such model is reference 311.30.42.30.01.005 (since 2014).|$|R
40|$|We have {{designed}} a three dimensional (3 D) fluorescence optical tomography system for small animal imaging {{based on an}} innovative system geometry that uses a truncated conical mirror which permits the entire surface of the animal to be viewed simultaneously by a single CCD camera. Compared with traditional approaches that employ a flat mirror, the conical mirror system has approximately 3 times better measurement sensitivity. By utilizing a fast <b>switching</b> filter <b>wheel</b> (<b>switching</b> time < 100 milliseconds), emission data at multiple wavelengths can be efficiently collected. An array of appropriately shaped neutral density filters, mounted on a linear stage, {{can be used to}} increase the system measurement dynamic range by 3 orders of magnitude. An x-y galvo mirror scanning system makes it possible to scan a collimated laser beam to any location on the mouse surface. A pattern of structured light incident on the animal surface is used to extract the surface geometry. A finite element based algorithm is applied to model photon propagation in the turbid media and a preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) method is used to solve the large linear system matrix. The reconstruction algorithm and the system performance are evaluated by phantom experiments...|$|R

50|$|Rotary gaps also {{altered the}} tone of the transmitter, since {{changing}} either the number of studs or rotational speed changed the spark discharge frequency. This was audible in receivers with detectors that could detect the modulation on the spark signalâ€”which enabled listeners to distinguish between different transmitters that were nominally tuned to the same frequency. A typical high-power multiple spark system (as it was also called) used a 9 to 24 in rotating commutator with six to twelve studs per <b>wheel,</b> typically <b>switching</b> several thousand volts.|$|R
