25|$|The year 342 BC was one {{of crisis}} for the Roman state, with the Roman legions {{stationed}} around Capua, {{as well as the}} surrounding Campanian towns, rebelling and marching on Rome. In this crisis, Corvus was appointed Dictator to deal with the mutineers. He met them at the head of an army some eight miles outside of Rome, but decided to negotiate with the rebels instead of fighting a battle. Using his past association with the army to gain their trust, he was able to reach an agreement with the rebels. He agreed and pushed through laws (the ne cui militum fraudi secessio fuit) which granted the mutinous soldiers immunity from prosecution, prevented the removal of a soldier’s name from the roll of service without his consent, and prohibited any Military Tribune being demoted down to the rank of centurion. He however refused to agree to the lowering of the rate of pay for the cavalrymen, and to the immediate execution of the Decemviri. It was also alleged that, during the troubles that brought about the passage of the Leges Genuciae, Corvus suggested that the Senate agree to the plebeian demands for the abolition of all debts, but this was rejected out of hand. Some historians, such as Gary Forsythe and S. P. Oakley consider the alleged events of the mutiny to be later literary inventions, although the laws passed in <b>this</b> <b>year</b> <b>are</b> accurate.|$|E

500|$|The Children's Television Workshop (CTW, later Sesame Workshop), the {{organization}} {{responsible for the}} production of Sesame Street, considered and discussed addressing the topic of divorce for many years before developing an episode. As early as 1989, writer and director Jon Stone expressed his intention of writing a script about it, stating, [...] "My two projects for <b>this</b> <b>year</b> <b>are</b> drugs and divorce. Divorce is a difficult one. Perhaps we could do it with puppets. I am also writing a script on drugs and peer pressure". Executive producer Dulcy Singer vetoed the idea in 1990, before it reached development. While she felt complex social matters should be discussed on the series, she felt the issue was irrelevant to inner city and financially disadvantaged families, which was the show's target audience. She said that [...] "divorce is a middle-class thing," [...] and suggested instead that an episode focus on a single-parent family, with the child born out of wedlock with an absent father. Singer stated, even after the episode was filmed, [...] "We were really nervous about the show, and we didn't think it was a shoo-in. When you're dealing with something like death, the approach can be universal. But with divorce, it's so personal. People react differently." [...] The topic of divorce was discussed again the following year, after the US Census Bureau released statistics suggesting 40 percent of all children in the United States, not just the middle classes, would soon live in divorced households.|$|E

60|$|With every {{deference}} to you, dearest Sarianna, I cannot {{think that you}} who live, as the English usually do, quite aside and apart from French society, can judge of the interest in France for Italy. I see French letters--letters of French men and women--giving a very contrary impression. The French newspapers give a very contrary impression. And the statistics of books and pamphlets published and circulated in France on the Italian question <b>this</b> <b>year</b> <b>are</b> in most prodigious disaccord with such a conclusion. Compare them with the same statistics in England, and then judge.|$|E

The first number of [...] "Edwin Drood" [...] was to appear before the end of his course of readings in March; and he was at work so long beforehand with a view to sparing himself, and having some numbers ready before the publication of the first one.|$|E
6000|$|From a bush by the {{roadside}} sprang up a fat man who cried aloud in English: [...] "How does Your Honour do? I met Your Honour in Simla <b>this</b> <b>year.</b> <b>Are</b> you quite well? Ya-as, I am here. Your Honour remembers me? I am travelling. Ya-as. Ha! Ha!" [...] and he went on, leaving His Honour bemazed. It was a Babu--a Simla Babu, of {{that there could be}} no doubt; but who he was or what he was doing, thirty miles from anywhere, His Honour could not make out. The native moves about more than most folk, except railway people, imagine. The big banking firms of Upper India naturally keep in close touch with their great change-houses in Ajmir, despatching and receiving messengers regularly. So it comes to pass that the necessitous circumstances of Lieutenant McRannamack, of the Tyneside Tailtwisters, quartered on the Frontier, are thoroughly known and discussed, a thousand miles south of the cantonment where the light-hearted Lieutenant goes to his money-lender.|$|E
