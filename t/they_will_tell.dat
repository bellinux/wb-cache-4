500|$|In 2013, Tony Benn reiterated his {{previous}} opposition to European integration. Speaking to the Oxford Union on the alleged overshadowing of the EU debate by [...] "UKIP and Tory backbenchers", he said:I took {{the view that}} having fought [...] that we should now work with them, and co-operate, {{and that was my}} first thought about it. Then how I saw how the European Union was developing, it was very obvious that what they had in mind was not democratic. ... And the way that Europe has developed is that the bankers and the multinational corporations have got very powerful positions, and if you come in on their terms, <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> you what you can and cannot do. And that is unacceptable. My view about the European Union has always been not that I am hostile to foreigners, but that I am in favour of democracy ... I think they're building an empire there, they want us {{to be a part of}} their empire and I don't want that.|$|E
2500|$|During the {{emerging}} pre-reader stage children will often [...] "read" [...] books and stories. <b>They</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> {{the story as}} they have memorized it and turn the pages appropriately. They call {{what they are doing}} [...] "reading" [...] since they typically don't yet understand that their parents or caregivers are decoding written words. To them, they are doing what they think their parents or caregivers are doing when reciting the story.|$|E
2500|$|Some on {{the left}} have also accused ANSWER of exaggerating protest attendance. [...] An October 2007 Socialist Worker {{editorial}} penned by Todd Chretien and republished on CounterPunch asserted: [...] "Ask anyone {{who has worked with}} ANSWER, and <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> you that its organizers always double the number of people at their marches. More recently, the multiplication factor has increased." [...] Chretien describes this as [...] "disorienting for the movement." ...|$|E

2500|$|Reviews in the {{conservative}} press were more mixed. American economist Mark Skousen praised the film, writing in Human Events, [...] "The script is true to the philosophy of Ayn Rand's novel." [...] The Weekly Standard senior editor Fred Barnes noted that the film [...] "gets Rand's point across forcefully without too much pounding", that it is [...] "fast-paced" [...] {{when compared with the}} original novel's 1200-page length, and that it is [...] "at least as relevant today as it was when the novel was published in 1957." [...] Jack Hunter, contributing editor to The American Conservative, wrote, [...] "If you ask the average film critic about the new movie adaptation of Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> you it is a horrible movie. If you ask the average conservative or libertarian <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> you it is a great movie. Objectively, it is a mediocre movie at best. Subjectively, {{it is one of the}} best mediocre movies you'll ever see." [...] In the National Post, Peter Foster credited the movie for the daunting job of fidelity to the novel, wryly suggested a plot rewrite along the lines of comparable current events, and concluded, [...] "if it sinks without trace, its backers should at least be proud that they lost their own money." ...|$|E

When Amin wakes, he hears the snickering of Al-Rashid [...] from {{inside one of the}} secret chambers, he draws a sword and {{inadvertently}} stabs Al-Rashid, believing he is a demon. Seeing that Al-Rashid is dead, the Sultan's advisers decide <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> everyone that the real Sultan has gone on a pilgrimage to Mecca, and that Amin was chosen as the Sultan's successor, all the while continuing to tell Amin that he is the one and only Sultan Harun Al-Rashid.|$|E
2500|$|Sabyasachi Mukherjee [...] made a {{debut in}} jewelry line with Guzaarish. He had {{designed}} the line {{keeping in mind}} a multicultural element with a nomadic vibe. Omar Siddiqui played by Aditya Roy Kapoor was styled like a struggling French musician. Suhel Seth, who played Ethan's doctor, is presented in stiff suits and Shernaz Patel, Ethan's lawyer is given a look of a Gandhian in cotton saris and three-quarter blouses. The maids are in dumpy dresses. The costume designer says that [...] "..the clothes are nearly theatrical {{and they have a}} mind of their own. If you remove the characters and hang the clothes, <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> a story. It's like Neverland or the reality version of The Magic Faraway Tree!". The entire look of Rai consisted of thirty-seven long frocks, four dumpy shoes, maxis, aprons with motifs of cutlery, quirky glasses and jewelry, surreal hairdos and red lips. For the collection, Sabyasachi used precious and semi-precious stones, minakari and filigree and had to work with about 60 skilled workers from West Bengal to complete the line. The price range of rings and earrings starts from Rs. 40,000 and navratan necklaces are priced at Rs. 510,000. On the look of Ethan Mascarenhas, Mukherjee said that the make up and costume was more organic. On a lighter note he added that he wanted his hero to look like Clark Kent and not James bond.|$|E

60|$|Here in England {{they have}} the oddest ways. They won't tell a spoken lie--nothing can persuade them. Except in a large moral interest, like {{politics}} or religion, I mean. To tell a spoken lie to get even the poorest little personal advantage out {{of it is a}} thing which is impossible to them. They make me ashamed of myself sometimes, they are so bigoted. <b>They</b> <b>will</b> not even <b>tell</b> a lie for the fun of it; <b>they</b> <b>will</b> not <b>tell</b> it when it hasn't even a suggestion of damage or advantage in it for any one. This has a restraining influence upon me in spite of reason, and I am always getting out of practice.|$|R
