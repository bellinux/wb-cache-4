Therefore, Chamberlain was prohibited from joining the NBA for a year, and decided to play for the Harlem Globetrotters in 1958 for a sum of $50,000 (equal to about $ today).|$|E
5|$|During the 1930s Vaughan Williams {{came to be}} {{regarded}} as a leading figure in British music, particularly after the deaths of Elgar, Delius and Holst in 1934. Holst's death was a severe personal and professional blow to Vaughan Williams; the two had been each other's closest friends and musical advisers since <b>their</b> <b>college</b> days. After Holst's death Vaughan Williams was glad of the advice and support of other friends including Boult and the composer Gerald Finzi, but his relationship with Holst was irreplaceable.|$|E
5|$|Dyrwood is cursed by the Hollowborn Plague: {{children}} are being born without souls, leaving them totally unresponsive in a way similar to a permanent vegetative state. Many people blame animancers, the scientists who study and manipulate souls. Investigating the curse, the Watcher discovers that the Hollowborns' souls have in fact been stolen by a cult known as the Leaden Key, led by a priest named Thaos, and that Thaos is framing animancers for the Plague. This eventually leads to a riot {{in the capital city}} where animancers are lynched and <b>their</b> <b>college</b> is destroyed.|$|E

5|$|As the Browns {{climbed to}} the top of the NFL, {{speculation}} began to mount that Brown might return to the Buckeyes. Wes Felser had resigned as the team's coach, and Brown was seen as a possible replacement. But Brown had also alienated many Ohio State alumni by failing to return to the school after World War II and for signing away players including Groza before <b>their</b> <b>college</b> eligibility expired. He interviewed with the university's athletic board on January 27, 1951, but the board unanimously rejected Brown in favor of Woody Hayes, who was unanimously endorsed by the board of trustees.|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} with the Development Program, he {{committed}} to an athletic scholarship with the Michigan State Spartans of the Central Collegiate Hockey Association (CCHA). Joining the Spartans in 2002–03, he recorded 36 points (17 goals and 19 assists) over 39 games, ranking fourth in team scoring and 13th in the CCHA overall. His freshman year included two CCHA Rookie of the Week distinctions and a hat-trick, recorded on January 10, 2003, in a 5–2 win against the Alaska Nanooks. His efforts as a freshman earned him Spartans Rookie of the Year and CCHA All-Rookie Team honors.

5|$|He {{imagined}} {{it as an}} homage to the 1960s comic books and spy films from his boyhood and he initially tried to develop it as a 2D cel animation. When The Iron Giant became a box office bomb, he reconnected with old friend John Lasseter at Pixar in March 2000 and pitched his story idea to him. Bird and Lasseter knew each other from <b>their</b> <b>college</b> years at CalArts in the 1970s. Lasseter was sold on the idea and convinced Bird to come to Pixar, where the film would be done in computer animation. The studio announced a multi-film contract with Bird on May 4, 2000, breaking Pixar's mold of having directors who had all risen through the ranks. The Incredibles was written and directed solely by Brad Bird, a departure from previous Pixar productions which typically had two or three directors and as many screenwriters. In addition, {{it would be the}} company's first film in which all characters are human.|$|E

5|$|Most {{applicants}} {{choose to}} apply {{to one of the}} individual colleges, which work with each other to ensure that the best students gain a place somewhere at the university regardless of <b>their</b> <b>college</b> preferences. Shortlisting is based on achieved and predicted exam results, school references, and, in some subjects, written admission tests or candidate-submitted written work. Approximately 60% of applicants are shortlisted, although this varies by subject. If a large number of shortlisted applicants for a subject choose one college, then students who named that college may be reallocated randomly to under-subscribed colleges for the subject. The colleges then invite shortlisted candidates for interview, where they are provided with food and accommodation for around three days in December. Most applicants will be individually interviewed by academics at more than one college. Students from outside Europe can be interviewed remotely, for example, over the Internet.|$|E

He also was voted one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History in 1996. The United States Basketball Writers Association renamed <b>their</b> <b>College</b> Player of the Year Award the Oscar Robertson Trophy in his honor in 1998, and he was one of five people chosen to represent the inaugural National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame class in 2006.

5|$|The {{importance}} of collegiate life {{is such that}} for many students <b>their</b> <b>college</b> JCR (Junior Common Room, for undergraduates) or MCR (Middle Common Room, for graduates) is seen as more important than OUSU. JCRs and MCRs each have a committee, with a president and other elected students representing their peers to college authorities. Additionally, they organise events and often have significant budgets to spend as they wish (money coming from their colleges and sometimes other sources such as student-run bars). (It {{is worth noting that}} JCR and MCR are terms that are used to refer to rooms for use by members, as well as the student bodies.) Not all colleges use this JCR/MCR structure, for example Wadham College's entire student population is represented by a combined Students' Union and purely graduate colleges have different arrangements.|$|E

Registering 48 points (20 goals and 28 assists) over 38 games as a freshman, Morrison was named the CCHA Rookie of the Year for the 1993–94 season. He played on a line with fellow freshman Jason Botterill; the two played together throughout <b>their</b> <b>college</b> career. In the 1994 playoffs, he helped the Wolverines to a CCHA championship.

5|$|Zappa's {{interest}} in composing and arranging flourished {{in his last}} high-school years. By his final year, he was writing, arranging and conducting avant-garde performance pieces for the school orchestra. He graduated from Antelope Valley High School in 1958, and later acknowledged two of his music teachers on the sleeve of the 1966 album Freak Out! Due to his family's frequent moves, Zappa attended at least six different high schools, and as a student he was often bored and given to distracting {{the rest of the}} class with juvenile antics. In 1959, he attended Chaffey College but left after one semester, and maintained thereafter a disdain for formal education, taking his children out of school at age 15 and refusing to pay for <b>their</b> <b>college.</b>|$|E

Clifford tells the officers during college, Hal was a handsome college football star who competed with Clifford for Virginia's affections. One day, while helping Hal prepare for a chemistry exam, a jealous Clifford deliberately gave him the wrong answers, resulting in Hal being asked by Professor Cushman to remain after class for extra work. While working on a chemistry experiment, Clifford walks by the window with Virginia to boast. Furious, Hal hurls a beaker to the ground, accidentally causing an explosion that disfigures his face. Donnelly speculates that Hal is the Creeper, and that he killed Professor Cushman and Joan because he holds them partially responsible for his accident.|$|E
5|$|The founders' {{hopes that}} <b>their</b> <b>college</b> would produce {{prominent}} Welsh clergy were fulfilled {{in no small}} measure when a former student, A. G. Edwards, was elected the first Archbishop of Wales when the Church in Wales was disestablished in 1920. Two later Archbishops of Wales, Glyn Simon (Archbishop from 1968 to 1971) and Gwilym Owen Williams (Archbishop 1971–1982) were also educated at the college. Celticists associated with the college include Sir John Rhys, Sir John Morris-Jones, and Sir Thomas (T. H.) Parry-Williams, whilst the list of historians includes the college's first graduate, David Powel, who published the first printed history of Wales in 1584, and the Victorian historian J. R. Green. Angus Buchanan won the Victoria Cross during the First World War. Record-breaking quadriplegic solo sailor Hilary Lister was also a student here, whilst from the field of arts and entertainment there are names such as Magnus Magnusson, presenter of Mastermind, the National Poet of Wales Gwyn Thomas, and television weather presenters Kirsty McCabe and Siân Lloyd. Nigel Hitchin, the Savilian Professor of Geometry at Oxford since 1997, studied at the college, as did Edward Hinds (a physicist who won the Rumford Medal in 2008), Chris Rapley (director of the Science Museum), and the zoologists Edward Bagnall Poulton and James Brontë Gatenby.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2005 The {{focus of}} this study is a search for the voice of African American {{community}} college trustees as they work to impact the changes community colleges must make over the next quarter century. It examined the lived experiences and perceptions that selected African American community college trustees have of their roles as trustees and the impact they think they are having on the setting of priorities in the governance of <b>their</b> respective <b>colleges.</b> This topic is significant since, arguably, community colleges are the quintessential democratic institutions in society; their doors are open to everyone. In various ways, community colleges are dynamically responding to the demographic changes that are occurring in American society. Among those changes are an increasing number of African American students entering college, especially community colleges, and an increasing number of African Americans becoming community college trustees. This study found that the elected African American community college trustees who participated in this study are fully integrated into the governance processes of <b>their</b> <b>colleges,</b> but do not think of themselves a being assimilated into the culture of their boards. They believe that they bring a double consciousness to their roles as trustees and that it allows them to perceive governance issues from the perspectives of insiders who are comfortable with the status quo and from the perspective of outsiders who have been traditionally removed from the locus of institutional power. Participants see themselves as representatives of the interests of <b>their</b> <b>colleges</b> as well as representatives of the interests of groups and individuals who have little or no voice in the affairs of <b>their</b> <b>colleges.</b> Participants are long-time community leaders whose influence extends beyond <b>their</b> <b>colleges</b> into <b>their</b> communities; they see themselves as servant leaders dedicated to working for change in society...|$|R
