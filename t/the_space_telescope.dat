5|$|Once <b>the</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Telescope</b> {{project had}} been given the go-ahead, work on the program was divided among many institutions. Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) was given {{responsibility}} for the design, development, and construction of the telescope, while Goddard Space Flight Center was given overall control of the scientific instruments and ground-control center for the mission. MSFC commissioned the optics company Perkin-Elmer to design and build the Optical Telescope Assembly (OTA) and Fine Guidance Sensors for <b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>telescope.</b> Lockheed was commissioned to construct and integrate the spacecraft in which the telescope would be housed.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, {{outreach}} {{efforts are}} coordinated by <b>the</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Telescope</b> Science Institute (STScI) Office for Public Outreach, {{which was established}} in 2000 to ensure that U.S. taxpayers saw the benefits of their investment in <b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>telescope</b> program. To that end, STScI operates the HubbleSite.org website. The Hubble Heritage Project, operating out of the STScI, provides the public with high-quality images {{of the most interesting}} and striking objects observed. The Heritage team is composed of amateur and professional astronomers, as well as people with backgrounds outside astronomy, and emphasizes the aesthetic nature of Hubble images. The Heritage Project is granted a small amount of time to observe objects which, for scientific reasons, may not have images taken at enough wavelengths to construct a full-color image.|$|E
5|$|The Hubble Space Telescope {{celebrated its}} 20th anniversary in space on April 24, 2010. To commemorate the occasion, NASA, ESA, and <b>the</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Telescope</b> Science Institute (STScI) {{released}} an {{image from the}} Carina Nebula.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> Spitzer <b>Space</b> <b>Telescope</b> (SST), {{formerly}} <b>the</b> <b>Space</b> Infrared <b>Telescope</b> Facility (SIRTF), is {{an infrared}} <b>space</b> <b>telescope</b> launched in 2003. It {{is the fourth}} and final of the NASA Great Observatories program.|$|R
50|$|Several {{infrared}} <b>space</b> <b>telescopes</b> {{have continued}} and greatly expanded {{the study of}} the infrared Universe, such as <b>the</b> Infrared <b>Space</b> Observatory launched in 1995, <b>the</b> Spitzer <b>Space</b> <b>Telescope</b> launched in 2003, and <b>the</b> Akari <b>Space</b> <b>Telescope</b> launched in 2006.|$|R
5|$|It {{has always}} been {{important}} for <b>the</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Telescope</b> to capture the public's imagination, given the considerable contribution of taxpayers to its construction and operational costs. After the difficult early years when the faulty mirror severely dented Hubble's reputation with the public, the first servicing mission allowed its rehabilitation as the corrected optics produced numerous remarkable images.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Telescope</b> Science Institute (STScI) is {{responsible}} for the scientific operation of the telescope and the delivery of data products to astronomers. STScI is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA) and is physically located in Baltimore, Maryland on the Homewood campus of Johns Hopkins University, one of the 39 US universities and seven international affiliates that make up the AURA consortium. STScI was established in 1981 after something of a power struggle between NASA and the scientific community at large. NASA had wanted to keep this function in-house, but scientists wanted it to be based in an academic establishment. <b>The</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Telescope</b> European Coordinating Facility (ST-ECF), established at Garching bei München near Munich in 1984, provided similar support for European astronomers until 2011, when these activities were moved to the European Space Astronomy Centre.|$|E
5|$|The new camera {{will allow}} Hubble to take large-scale, {{extremely}} clear and detailed photos over {{a wider range}} of colors than the old camera did. After the installation, controllers at <b>the</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Telescope</b> Operations Control Center at Goddard Space Flight Center sent commands to the camera to perform an aliveness test, which passed, indicating the camera was installed correctly.|$|E
50|$|Chandra {{is one of}} the Great Observatories, {{along with}} <b>the</b> Hubble <b>Space</b> <b>Telescope,</b> Compton Gamma Ray Observatory (1991-2000), and <b>the</b> Spitzer <b>Space</b> <b>Telescope.</b> <b>The</b> {{telescope}} is named after the Nobel Prize-winning Indian-American astrophysicist Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar.|$|R
50|$|Cha 110913-773444 was {{discovered}} in 2004 by Kevin Luhman and others at Pennsylvania State University using <b>the</b> Spitzer <b>Space</b> <b>Telescope</b> and <b>the</b> Hubble <b>Space</b> <b>Telescope,</b> {{as well as two}} Earth-bound telescopes in Chile.|$|R
50|$|GN-108036 is {{a distant}} galaxy {{discovered}} and {{confirmed by the}} Subaru Telescope and the Keck Observatory located in Hawaii; its study was also completed by <b>the</b> Hubble <b>Space</b> <b>Telescope</b> and <b>the</b> Spitzer <b>Space</b> <b>Telescope.</b>|$|R
5|$|After {{discovering}} the burst's X-ray afterglow, the BeppoSAX team provided {{a more accurate}} localization, and what Metzger had {{assumed to be a}} variable star was still present in this smaller error box. Both the Caltech team and the Amsterdam team were hesitant to publish any conclusions on the variable object. On May10 Howard Bond of <b>the</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Telescope</b> Science Institute published his discovery, which was later confirmed to be the burst's optical afterglow.|$|E
5|$|Launched in 1983, <b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>telescope</b> IRAS {{detected}} infrared {{emissions from}} stars {{near to the}} Sun, including an excess infrared emission from Epsilon Eridani. The observations indicated a disk of fine-grained cosmic dust was orbiting the star; this debris disk has since been extensively studied. Evidence for a planetary system was discovered in 1998 by the observation of asymmetries in this dust ring. The clumping in the dust distribution {{could be explained by}} gravitational interactions with a planet orbiting just inside the dust ring.|$|E
5|$|Past {{servicing}} missions have exchanged old {{instruments for}} new ones, both avoiding failure and making possible {{new types of}} science. Without servicing missions, all of the instruments will eventually fail. In August 2004, the power system of <b>the</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Telescope</b> Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) failed, rendering the instrument inoperable. The electronics had originally been fully redundant, but {{the first set of}} electronics failed in May 2001. This power supply was fixed during Servicing Mission 4 in May 2009.|$|E
5000|$|The {{success of}} IRAS lead to {{interest}} in the 1985 Infrared Telescope (IRT) mission on <b>the</b> <b>Space</b> Shuttle, and <b>the</b> planned Shuttle Infrared Telescope Facility which eventually transformed into <b>the</b> <b>Space</b> Infrared <b>Telescope</b> Facility, SIRTF, which in turn was developed into <b>the</b> Spitzer <b>Space</b> <b>Telescope,</b> launched in 2003. [...] The success of early infrared space astronomy led to further missions, such as <b>the</b> Infrared <b>Space</b> Observatory (1990s) and <b>the</b> Hubble <b>Space</b> <b>Telescope</b> NICMOS instrument.|$|R

5|$|An HDF {{counterpart}} {{in the southern}} celestial hemisphere was created in 1998: the HDF-South. Created using a similar observing strategy, the HDF-S was very similar in appearance to the original HDF. This supports the cosmological principle that at its largest scale the Universe is homogeneous. The HDF-S survey used <b>the</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Telescope</b> Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) and the Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS) instruments installed on the HST in 1997; the Hubble Deep Field has since been re-observed several times using WFPC2, {{as well as by}} the NICMOS and STIS instruments. Several supernova events were detected by comparing the first and second epoch observations of the HDF-N.|$|E
5|$|Servicing Mission 2, {{flown by}} Discovery in February 1997, {{replaced}} the GHRS and the FOS with <b>the</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Telescope</b> Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) and the Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS), replaced an Engineering and Science Tape Recorder {{with a new}} Solid State Recorder, and repaired thermal insulation. NICMOS contained a heat sink of solid nitrogen to reduce the thermal noise from the instrument, but shortly after it was installed, an unexpected thermal expansion resulted in part of the heat sink coming into contact with an optical baffle. This led to an increased warming rate for the instrument and reduced its original expected lifetime of 4.5 years to about 2 years.|$|E
5|$|Since 1999, {{the leading}} Hubble {{outreach}} group in Europe {{has been the}} Hubble European Space Agency Information Centre (HEIC). This office was established at <b>the</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Telescope</b> European Coordinating Facility in Munich, Germany. HEIC's mission is to fulfill HST outreach and education tasks for the European Space Agency. The work is centered on the production of news and photo releases that highlight interesting Hubble results and images. These are often European in origin, and so increase awareness of both ESA's Hubble share (15%) and the contribution of European scientists to the observatory. ESA produces educational material, including a videocast series called Hubblecast designed to share world-class scientific news with the public.|$|E
50|$|Mission was {{intended}} to deploy <b>the</b> Hubble <b>Space</b> <b>Telescope</b> into orbit. <b>The</b> Hubble <b>Space</b> <b>Telescope,</b> {{and most of the}} previously assigned crew (except Young, who was replaced by Loren Shriver), would eventually fly on STS-31 in 1990.|$|R

(The {{latter two}} surveys are joining {{together}} observations obtained from <b>space</b> with <b>the</b> Hubble <b>Space</b> <b>Telescope,</b> <b>the</b> Spitzer <b>Space</b> <b>Telescope,</b> <b>the</b> Chandra X-ray Observatory and the XMM-Newton satellite, {{with a large}} set of observations obtained with ground-based telescopes).|$|R
50|$|The Infrared Detector Laboratory {{built the}} Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS) {{instrument}} for <b>the</b> Hubble <b>Space</b> <b>Telescope</b> and <b>the</b> Multiband Imaging Photometer (MIPS) instrument for <b>the</b> Spitzer <b>Space</b> <b>Telescope.</b> For <b>the</b> James Webb <b>Space</b> <b>Telescope,</b> Steward built <b>the</b> Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) and {{helped build the}} Mid-IR Instrument (MIRI). Both instruments have been delivered to NASA; launch is expected in 2017 or 2018.|$|R
5|$|The {{continuing}} {{success of}} the OAO program encouraged increasingly strong consensus within the astronomical community that the LST should be a major goal. In 1970, NASA established two committees, one to plan the engineering side of <b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>telescope</b> project, {{and the other to}} determine the scientific goals of the mission. Once these had been established, the next hurdle for NASA was to obtain funding for the instrument, which would be far more costly than any Earth-based telescope. The U.S. Congress questioned many aspects of the proposed budget for the telescope and forced cuts in the budget for the planning stages, which at the time consisted of very detailed studies of potential instruments and hardware for the telescope. In 1974, public spending cuts led to Congress deleting all funding for the telescope project.|$|E
5|$|Optically, the HST is a Cassegrain {{reflector}} of Ritchey–Chrétien design, as {{are most}} large professional telescopes. This design, with two hyperbolic mirrors, {{is known for}} good imaging performance over a wide field of view, with the disadvantage that the mirrors have shapes {{that are hard to}} fabricate and test. The mirror and optical systems of the telescope determine the final performance, and they were designed to exacting specifications. Optical telescopes typically have mirrors polished to an accuracy of about a tenth of the wavelength of visible light, but <b>the</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Telescope</b> was to be used for observations from the visible through the ultraviolet (shorter wavelengths) and was specified to be diffraction limited {{to take full advantage of}} the space environment. Therefore, its mirror needed to be polished to an accuracy of 10nanometers, or about 1/65 of the wavelength of red light. On the long wavelength end, the OTA was not designed with optimum IR performance in mind—for example, the mirrors are kept at stable (and warm, about 15°C) temperatures by heaters. This limits Hubble's performance as an infrared telescope.|$|E
5|$|Beginning the mission's fourth spacewalk at 13:45 UTC, Massimino and Good {{went to work}} {{repairing}} <b>the</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Telescope</b> Imaging Spectrograph (STIS). The spectrograph {{failed in}} 2004 due to a blown power supply. As with the ACS, the STIS was not designed {{with the intention of}} servicing it while in space, and one of the major challenges was to remove a cover plate held tight with over 100 screws using a specially designed tool called a fastener-capture plate, designed to trap the screws and washers and prevent them from floating into space when removed. While preparing the fastener-capture plate, Massimino encountered issues with a handrail that had to be removed to accommodate the fastener-capture plate. The handrail had a stripped bolt on the bottom, preventing it from being released. After trying multiple options without success, managers on the ground advised Massimino to use brute force to remove the handrail, so he could proceed with the removal of the cover plate. The procedure was tested at Goddard Space Flight Center prior to approving it, showing that the stripped bolt could be broken off safely using force. Working inside the orbiter, Feustel walked Massimino through the procedure slowly, advising him to tape the handrail with Kapton tape to prevent any parts from breaking off or flying loose, {{to be aware of the}} reaction the force would have, as well as to watch for sharp edges on the handrail after removal.|$|E

5|$|The philosopher A. J. Ayer was a pupil at Ascham St Vincent's School in Carlisle Road. The artist Eric Ravilious grew up, {{was educated}} and taught in Eastbourne. In {{addition}} to Orwell, Connolly, Beaton, Maxwell and Longhurst {{listed on the}} St Cyprian's School blue plaque, the writers Alaric Jacob, E. H. W. Meyerstein and Alan Hyman also attended that school. The biographer and historian Philip Ziegler was a pupil as was the music historian Dyneley Hussey and politician, historian and diarist Alan Clark. Other politicians were Richard Wood who had lost both legs in the war, and David Ormsby-Gore later ambassador to the USA. Artists Cedric Morris and David Kindersley also attended the school as did military figures such as General Sir Lashmer Whistler and Major General Henry Foot VC. Pupils with sporting connections include the amateur jockey Anthony Mildmay and Seymour de Lotbiniere Director of Outside Broadcasts at the BBC. Jagaddipendra Narayan was a reigning Maharaja of Cooch Behar while at the school. Other former pupils include the war-blinded life peer Lord Fraser and the submarine commander Rupert Lonsdale. NASA aerospace engineer Bruce Woodgate, who attended Eastbourne Grammar School, was the principal investigator and designer of <b>the</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Telescope</b> Imaging Spectrograph, which was installed on the Hubble Space Telescope in 1997. Modern celebrities who studied in the town include Prunella Scales and Eddie Izzard.|$|E
25|$|Some {{projects}} to equip telescopes with planet-imaging-capable instruments include the ground-based telescopes Gemini Planet Imager, VLT-SPHERE, Subaru-HiCIAO, Palomar Project 1640, and <b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>telescope</b> WFIRST-AFTA.
