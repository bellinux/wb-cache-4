5|$|Into modern times, {{his legacy}} has {{remained}} {{more pronounced in}} Ireland and Scotland than in his native Norway. Among the few domestic developments known during his reign, Norway developed a more centralised rule and {{moved closer to the}} European model of church organisation. Popularly portrayed as a Viking warrior rather than a medieval monarch, Magnus was the last Norwegian king <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>in</b> battle abroad, and he may in some respects be considered the final Viking king.|$|E

O'Reilly's match figures were 11 wickets for 129 runs, and taking seven for 54 in his second innings was to produce his best Test figures.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{systematically}} {{review and}} synthesise {{the research evidence}} linking pain to psychological concerns about <b>falling</b> <b>in</b> community dwelling older adults. Methods: A systematic review was conducted {{in accordance with the}} preferred reporting items of systematic reviews and meta-analysis statement (PRISMA). Major electronic databases were searched from inception until June 2013. Two authors independently conducted the searches, extracted data and completed methodological quality assessments. Articles were included if they measured one of the psychological concerns related <b>to</b> <b>falling</b> <b>in</b> a sample of community dwelling older adults with pain, or explored the association between the two. Results: Of a potential 892 articles, 12 met the eligibility criteria (n[*]=[*] 3398). The methodological quality of the included studies was variable and none of the included studies primary aim was to investigate the relationship between pain and psychological concerns related <b>to</b> <b>falls.</b> Two studies found significant differences in psychological concerns related <b>to</b> <b>falls</b> <b>in</b> older adults with pain and a control group. Nine out of 10 studies reported a significant correlation between pain and psychological concerns related <b>to</b> <b>falls</b> <b>in</b> their sample. Conclusion: This review provides provisional evidence that pain is associated with fear of falling (FOF), avoidance of activities due <b>to</b> FOF and <b>falls</b> efficacy <b>in</b> community dwelling older adult...|$|R

5|$|Anne {{became a}} general {{favourite}} {{with the people}} she met either at The Hague or at the Princess of Orange's country house at Teylingen. She was very attractive and stylish, and attracted many men. One of the first men <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>in</b> love with Anne was Spencer Compton, a son of the Earl of Northampton. However, Anne quickly {{fell in love with}} Henry Jermyn, who returned her feelings. Anne dismissed Jermyn just as quickly when she met James, Duke of York, the son of the deposed king. On 24 November 1659, two or three years after she first met him, James promised he would marry Anne. Charles, James' brother, forced him reluctantly into this, saying that her strong character would be a positive influence on his weak-willed brother.|$|E

5|$|By {{the morning}} of August 1, the Tanana River had begun <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>in</b> Fairbanks, just as the Salcha River had begun to recede in Salcha. Though {{isolated}} roads continued to wash out from heavy water flow and residents {{were not allowed to}} return to their homes, the water level of the river continued to fall. Due to this fact, the opening of Fairbanks' Tanana Valley Fair—scheduled for August 1—was not delayed. Despite the falling water level in the Tanana, the Chena River continued to rise due to the differing water levels in the two rivers. This fact caused the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to close the floodgates of the Chena River Lakes Flood Control Project at 3:30 a.m. on August 1. They remained closed throughout the day before being reopened at 5:30 a.m. on August 2.|$|E

At the same time, Martin begins <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>in</b> love with her, and Angela becomes Caroline's lodger. Elsewhere in the hospital, Alan and Joanna try to hide their relationship {{from the rest of}} the staff, unsuccessfully.

Though most songs originated from a guitar or bass riff from Ballou or Newton, all members had equal input on the writing process, with each member proposing different songs. Vocalist Bannon wrote a few songs for Axe to Fall, but were scrapped because they were slower {{than the rest of the}} songs, and did not fit the energy of the album.|$|E

5|$|Currency war, {{also known}} as {{competitive}} devaluations, is a condition in international affairs where countries seek to gain a trade advantage over other countries by causing the exchange rate of their currency <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>in</b> relation to other currencies. As the exchange rate of a country's currency falls exports become more competitive in other countries, and imports into the country become more expensive. Both effects benefit the domestic industry, and thus employment, which receives a boost in demand from both domestic and foreign markets. However, the price increases for import goods (as {{well as in the}} cost of foreign travel) are unpopular as they harm citizens' purchasing power; and when all countries adopt a similar strategy, it can lead to a general decline in international trade, harming all countries.|$|E

Crime in the categories of forcible rape, aggravated assault, property crime, motor vehicle theft, robbery, burglary, theft and arson all showed declines for 2009. Overall, crime in Dayton dropped 40% over the previous year. The Dayton Police Department reported a total of 39 murders in 2016, which marked a 39.3% increase in homicides from 2015.|$|E
5|$|Despite his meager {{political}} experience—having previously {{served only}} {{three years in the}} Kentucky House of Representatives—Johnson labored vehemently to ensure the success of the shadow government. Kentucky was admitted to the Confederacy on December 10, 1861, but the shadow government's influence in the Commonwealth extended only as far as the Confederate Army advanced. When Albert Sidney Johnston abandoned the Confederate capital of Bowling Green, Governor Johnson and the other government officials accompanied him. Despite his advanced age and a crippled arm, Johnson volunteered for military service in General Johnston's army. Johnson was killed at the Battle of Shiloh, making him the only state governor, Union or Confederate, <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>in</b> battle during the Civil War.

40|$|A macroeconometric {{model is}} used to examine {{possible}} causes of the 2008 - 2009 U. S. recession. The results suggest that about 30 percent of the recession so far (through 2008 : 4) is due to four unexplained shocks to the nondurable and durable consumption equations, 21 percent <b>to</b> the <b>fall</b> <b>in</b> equity wealth, 8 percent <b>to</b> the <b>fall</b> <b>in</b> housing wealth, 19 percent to import price shocks, and 22 percent <b>to</b> the <b>fall</b> <b>in</b> exports.

5|$|During {{the spring}} and summer, {{conditions}} along {{the east coast of}} Australia are highly conducive for the formation of hailstorms. The variation of air temperature in the atmosphere; with warm and humid air close to the ground and colder air above it causes instability, and the cold upper atmosphere temperatures allow the precipitation <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>in</b> solid form as hailstones.
