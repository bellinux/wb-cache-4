5|$|During the reception, Grace learns {{many things}} {{she did not}} know about Leo, {{including}} that his first name is Marvin (revealed by his mother, Eleanor (Judith Ivey)). So many unsettling details about Leo come to light that Grace becomes uneasy and leaves the reception; Leo follows her. The two run into Katie in the lobby who tells them that The Today Show has scrapped the wedding segment because the judge who performed the ceremony was not licensed in New York so their marriage is not valid. Upon learning this, Grace tells Leo that she needs <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> their relationship. Leo returns to the reception and announces to everyone that his marriage to Grace is not legitimate. Grace returns to the reception later, and reveals that she does want to marry Leo.|$|E

In a process overseen by a Royal Fine Art Commission under the presidency of Prince Albert, a Select Committee which included Sir Robert Peel started to take witness accounts from experts in 1841. Those experts included Sir Martin Archer Shee, P.R.A., and Charles Lock Eastlake, painter and acknowledged authority on art history, soon to be first director of the National Gallery and de facto administrator of the whole Westminster decoration project. It was decided that the opportunity should be seized to encourage {{the development of a}} national British school of History Painting, and that the paintings should be done in fresco.|$|E

25|$|Carrie {{asks her}} {{contacts}} {{for information on}} an underground doctor {{in the area where}} Quinn went missing. Following a tip from former Hezbollah commander Al-Amin (George Georgiou), she tracks down one of the cell's supporters, Dr. Hussein (Mehdi Nebbou). Under threat of arrest, he brings her to an apartment belonging to Qasim (Alireza Bayram), one of the terrorists. In the apartment, Carrie finds extensive research on the Hauptbahnhof train station and heads there to investigate. She finds Qasim in the subway, and pleads with him to stop the plan to bomb the station. Qasim tries to reason with his cousin Bibi (René Ifrah), the ringleader, but Bibi kills him. Carrie then shoots and kills Bibi, neutralizing the threat. Back home, Jonas breaks up with Carrie, saying that neither he nor his son will ever be safe around her. Saul asks Carrie to rejoin the CIA, but she declines his offer. Düring essentially proposes to her, giving her a chance to co-head his Foundation. She does not answer him, and he gives her <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> it.|$|E

As she told the writer Gloria Steinem during the 1968 presidential campaign, [...] "I never had <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> things like that—who I wanted to be, or who I admired, or to have ideas. I never had time to dream about being anyone else. I had to work." ...|$|E

The episode was Rosenberg's first for the series and her first on a show written for a premium network. Having had over 10 years' experience in writing for free-to-air commercial networks—which typically have 22–26 episodes per season rather than 12, with a much tighter schedule—she finished writing the script five weeks before it was due for preparation. She said that [...] "There was <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> storytelling. I never had that on any show; it's just wonderful." ...|$|E

The work of each of three generations of locksmiths in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, can be noted by the single change that the son and grandson incorporated into the original pattern that the grandfather brought from Germany. People were just too busy trying to feed {{themselves and their families}} and survive in harsh <b>times</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> changing what was proven to work. Change was considered dangerous (which it is) and disrespectful to the existing and preceding social condition.|$|R

When he later sold it just weeks before Fuchs was unmasked as a spy, the FBI regarded the timing as suspicious enough to interrogate Hamming. Although Hamming described his role at Los Alamos as being that of a [...] "computer janitor", he saw computer simulations of experiments {{that would have been}} impossible to perform in a laboratory. [...] "And when I had <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> it," [...] he later recalled, [...] "I realized that it meant that science was going to be changed".|$|E
500|$|Mark Ruffalo {{began his}} role as Banner / Hulk in The Avengers, after Feige said {{he chose not to}} bring back Norton. In October 2014, Norton claimed he chose never to play Hulk again because he [...] "wanted more diversity" [...] with his career, {{and did not want to}} be {{associated}} with only one character. In April 2012, despite Ruffalo being on board to play the Hulk in the sequel, Feige confirmed to Collider that Marvel had no plans at that time to film another Hulk film. In a Q session, Feige and Ruffalo confirmed that discussions are underway to produce another Hulk film due to the positive audience response to Ruffalo's performance in The Avengers. In September 2012, Feige, while exploring all possible story options for a sequel film, including a film based on the [...] "Planet Hulk" [...] and [...] "World War Hulk" [...] storylines, stated, [...] "everything [...] is on the table. Do I think Hulk can carry a movie and be as entertaining as he was in Avengers? I do believe that. I do believe he absolutely could. We certainly are not even going to attempt that until Avengers 2.

McGregor told Inside Soap that Mark {{did not stop}} loving Kate and that since he had <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> it, the issue was not as [...] "black and white" [...] as he first thought. Mark also noticed that Kyle Canning (Chris Milligan) had taken an interest in Kate {{and he did not}} like the idea of Kate moving on with Kyle. McGregor explained that Mark thought Kyle was an idiot and when he saw him with Kate, it forced Mark {{to come up with a}} plan to get closer to his ex-girlfriend. McGregor said, [...] "He comes up with a reason to summon her to the station - which Kate sees right through!" [...] Mark later asked Lucas for his advice, but Lucas was not much help. Both Kate and Mark wanted to get back together and Brewer said, [...] "They both have a lot of history, such as the lie that Kate told to protect Rebecca and then Mark does something which really hurts Kate, and this prevents them from moving forward." [...] The actress believed Mark was [...] "the one" [...] for Kate as they were both academic and focused.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Many reviews criticized the episode's {{lack of a}} cohesive plot. Myles McNutt from The A.V. Club awarded the episode a C rating, saying, Pool Party' was so loosely structured that it relied heavily on the characters to carry the narrative, {{and the result was}} some languid storytelling which gave me way too much <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> missed opportunities, failed experiments, and the increasing burden of a show without any momentum." [...] Dan Forcella from TVFanatic gave the episode three-and-a-half stars out of five and wrote, [...] "There were bits and pieces of each story that worked in 'Pool Party,' but neither Robert's stroll through parties never had, nor Erin's endeavor to make Andy jealous, came together to make completely funny or interesting tales." [...] The Huffington Post wrote that, [...] "Once , the plot bits were so loose it might have been difficult for casual fans to follow it all." [...] Craig McQuinn from The Faster Times wrote, Pool Party' was one of those episodes where you can tell the writers didn't know what else to do.... This is filler, really, which unfortunately tends to be unavoidable when you do 22-episode seasons and you're eight years in." [...] Many reviews were critical of the continued Erin-Andy romance taking center-stage. McNutt wrote, [...] "I still really do not care about Andy and Erin as a relationship. The show's approach to this storyline... is to have Andy enjoying a fairly normal evening with his girlfriend Jessica while Erin acts like a crazy person {{in an effort to get}} his attention." [...] Forecella noted that, while the Erin and Dwight pairing was funny, their attempts to make Andy jealous were not successful, as Andy's sub-plots were deemed not funny and [...] "boring." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{arrival of}} Chrissie Watts was {{announced}} barely {{a month before}} she was set to first appear on-screen, and {{came at a time}} when EastEnders was undergoing immense media criticism and falling ratings. The rush of casting meant Oberman had little time to process the enormity of the part she had taken on, declaring: [...] "my feet haven't even touched the ground yet. [...] I haven't had <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> what this role is going to do to my life! I'm very excited to be part of such a fantastic show and one I have been a fan of for many years." [...] She admitted, however, to being [...] "slightly intimidated" [...] by the high media profile and press interest surrounding the show at the time. Indeed, joining EastEnders [...] "proved to be something of a baptism of fire for Oberman", as she was playing opposite Leslie Grantham whose recent return to the show had been a highly publicised event. Twenty-four hours after Chrissie's first episode went to air a scandal surrounding Grantham hit the tabloid papers. According to Oberman, the atmosphere on set the next day [...] "was a bit tense" [...] but, she added, [...] "the Watts are pulling together and we're getting on with it and working". However Oberman was also reportedly finding things difficult, having walked into a highly complicated situation: [...] "Tracy-Ann is still really finding her feet on the show... she feels really left out because all the cast are blackballing Grantham and refusing to talk to him. Since most of her scenes are with Grantham, it's really hard for her." [...] Looking back on the incident after she had left EastEnders, Oberman remarked, [...] "I respect Leslie for fronting it out; he emerged from his dressing room and started working. No one mentioned the story. That's life in EastEnders; the machine never stops." ...|$|E
