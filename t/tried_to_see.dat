5|$|McDougal was {{released}} {{at the end}} of the trial and returned home. The following day she went to buy whisky and was confronted by a mob who were angry at the not proven verdict. She was taken to a police building in nearby Fountainbridge for her own protection, but after the mob laid siege to it, she escaped through a back window to the main police station off Edinburgh's High Street. She <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Burke, but permission was refused; she left Edinburgh the next day, and there are no clear accounts of her later life. On 3 January 1829, on the advice of both Catholic priests and Presbyterian clergy, Burke made another confession. This was more detailed than the official one provided prior to his trial; he placed much of the blame for the murders on Hare.|$|E
5|$|More recent historians, such as Michael Hicks and A. J. Pollard, have <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Warwick {{in light}} of the {{standards}} of his own age, rather than holding him up to contemporary constitutional ideals. The insults Warwick suffered at the hands of King Edward – including Edward's secret marriage, and the refusal of the French diplomatic channel – were significant. His claim to prominence in national affairs was not a product of illusions of grandeur; it was confirmed by the high standing he enjoyed among the princes on the continent. Furthermore, Warwick's cause was not considered unjust by his contemporaries, which can be seen by the earl's popularity exceeding that of the king {{at the time of his}} first rebellion in 1469. On the other hand, while Warwick could not easily suffer his treatment by the king, it was equally impossible for Edward to accept the earl's presence on the political scene. As long as Warwick remained as powerful and influential as he was, Edward could not fully assert his royal authority, and eventual confrontation became inevitable.|$|E
5|$|In 1851, the House of Commons was petitioned by Craven Berkeley, who had {{previously}} sat as the member of parliament for Cheltenham. He claimed that his step-daughter, Augusta Talbot, {{had been forced to}} join the Franciscan Convent in Taunton as a postulant (the first stage to become a nun), rather than a pupil. Her father had died in 1839 and then her mother, after remarrying, died in 1841, and with the subsequent death of her brother, she was due to inherit £80,000. After the death of her mother, Talbot had been placed in the care of Francis Talbot, 5th Earl of Shrewsbury, her father's half-brother. Berkeley alleged that the Shrewsburys first attempted to marry her to François VII de La Rochefoucauld, and then when she refused, placed her at the Taunton convent against her will. The allegation followed that when Talbot became a nun, her inheritance, which was due to her in June 1852, would become property of the convent, or the greater Catholic church. Berkeley also protested that he and his daughter were not allowed to communicate with Talbot, though Thomas Wilde, 1st Baron Truro, the Lord Chancellor, noted that Berkeley had not <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Talbot for nine years. Lord Truro contacted Talbot, who stated that she was not a postulant, and she was amenable to his plans to remove her from the convent and place her in the care of a new guardian in London. He duly did so, and rejected Berkeley's petition, upon the basis of his previous lack of contact with Talbot.|$|E

25|$|Although she {{had left}} Smith briefly because of {{arguments}} with him, in November 1995 she was once more living with him at Furnival Road. Her parents had noticed bruising on her, something she explained away as being the results of accidents. She became increasingly withdrawn and in December 1995 resigned from her part-time job. In March 1996 her parents received cards purportedly from her for their anniversary and a birthday, but only Smith had written in them. When Bates' brother <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> her at the house, Smith said she was not at home. When a concerned neighbour asked after her, she was briefly shown at an upstairs window.|$|E
25|$|Exorcism by a Christian priest {{works in}} some tales; {{the bishop of}} Hildesheim managed to exorcise Hödekin from the castle. Even this method is not fool-proof, however; when an exorcist tried to drive away Heinzelmann, the kobold tore up the priest's holy book, strewed it about the room, {{attacked}} the exorcist, and chased him away. Insulting a kobold may drive it away, but not without a curse; when someone <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> his true form, Goldemar left the home and vowed that the house would now be as unlucky {{as it had been}} fortunate under his care. Actions a Hütchen considers insulting include giving him clothing, rushing him in his work, burning the house down, and leaving a wagon wheel in front of it.|$|E

Set had measured Osiris in his sleep and made {{sure that he was}} the only one who could fit the box. Several <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> whether they fit. Once it was Osiris's turn to see if he could fit in the box, Set closed the lid on him so that the box was now a coffin for Osiris. Set flung the box in the Nile so that it would drift far away. Isis went looking for the box so that Osiris could have a proper burial. She found the box in a tree in Byblos, a city along the Phoenician coast, and brought it back to Egypt, hiding it in a swamp. But Set went hunting that night and found the box. Enraged, Set chopped Osiris's body into fourteen pieces and scattered them all over Egypt to ensure that Isis could never find Osiris again for a proper burial.|$|E
500|$|After {{surviving}} the bombardment, the POWs were resettled in a camp near Munich. The Germans {{gave them the}} opportunity to return to Nuremberg as wounded soldiers to obtain treatment; the POWs agreed because it was closer to the American lines. On April 17, American troops secured Nuremberg and subsequently freed the POWs. Juskalian described the event: [...] "When the Germans <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> if we were really wounded, the British erected a sign on the gate saying 'Plague', and that kept them out, three or four days later, the 45th U.S. Infantry Division overran Nuremberg and we were liberated." ...|$|E

For example, Alvarez Borland points out that in the scene where the General responds to the French diplomat, his words closely reflect García Márquez's 1982 Nobel Address. The diplomat is critical of the barbarism in Latin America and the brutal means used in attempting to achieve independence. Bolívar replies by pointing out that Europe had centuries to progress to its current state, and that South America should be left to experience its [...] "Middle Ages in peace".

500|$|Following 2001: A Space Odyssey, Kubrick {{originally}} planned {{to make a}} film about the life of the French emperor Napoleon. Fascinated by his life and own [...] "self-destruction", Kubrick {{spent a great deal of}} time planning the film's development, and had conducted about two years of extensive research into Napoleon's life, reading several hundred books and gaining access to Napoleon's personal memoirs and commentaries. He also <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> every film ever made about Napoleon and found none of them appealing, including Abel Gance's 1927 film which is generally considered to be a masterpiece, but for Kubrick, a [...] "really terrible" [...] movie. Lo Brutto states that Napoleon was an ideal subject for Kubrick, embracing the director's [...] "passion for control, power, obsession, strategy, and the military", while Napoleon's psychological intensity and depth, logistical genius and war, sex, and the evil nature of man were all ingredients which deeply appealed to Kubrick.|$|E
500|$|Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard was {{determined}} to move on from the final after scoring an own goal: [...] "Losing cup finals and scoring an own goal is a bad day for myself, but I'll {{look forward to the}} next game now." [...] He also said that Chelsea deserved the victory: [...] "We scored early on and <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the clock out because we were 15 minutes away from lifting the cup, but credit to Chelsea they came back and deserved the win." [...] Liverpool manager Rafael Benítez believed that Liverpool would have won the match had they scored when they were leading 1–0: [...] "If you have clear chances at 1–0 and you score the second goal you finish the game, but we made some mistakes and at the end we conceded in our own goal." [...] Despite the defeat he was proud of his players' efforts: [...] "I say to the players we must be proud because we played a good game, Chelsea controlled the game when they started playing, but we re-organised the team with three midfielders and had some opportunities." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "We Found Love" [...] was shot on September 26–28, 2011, in County Down, Northern Ireland. It was filmed {{in a field}} {{in the town of}} Bangor, County Down, ahead of Rihanna's embarkment on the European leg of the Loud Tour (2011), and the New Lodge area of North Belfast. It was {{directed}} by Melina Matsoukas, who had previously directed the videos for [...] "Rude Boy" [...] (2010), and the controversial [...] "S" [...] (2011). During the filming, people driving around the location of the set informed the BBC that traffic in the area was congested as drivers <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the singer. Pictures showing Rihanna wearing a red bandana top, long flannel shirt, and [...] "dirty denim", similar to the clothing she wore for the song's artwork, were leaked onto the internet the same day. She filmed scenes while wearing a bikini with the pattern of the US flag, and a denim vest and ripped jeans. The owner of the field, farmer and North Down Borough Council Democratic Unionist Party councillor Alan Graham, expressed distaste after seeing Rihanna topless on his field, saying: [...] "When the filming did become to my mind unacceptable I requested the filming to stop... it became apparent to me that the situation was becoming inappropriate and I requested them to stop and they did". On September 28, 2011, the shoot location was moved to a closed set in Titanic Quarter, Belfast where both photographers and fans were barred from watching the singer.|$|E

VanDerZee sometimes combined several photos in one image, for example by adding a ghostly child to an image of a wedding to suggest the couple's future, or by superimposing a funeral image upon a photograph of a dead woman to give the feeling of her eerie presence. VanDerZee said, [...] "I wanted to make the camera take what I thought should be there." ...|$|E

2500|$|Virgil {{proceeds}} to guide Dante through the nine circles of Hell. The circles are concentric, representing a gradual increase in wickedness, and culminating at {{the centre of}} the earth, where Satan is held in bondage. The sinners of each circle are punished for eternity in a fashion fitting their crimes: each punishment is a contrapasso, a symbolic instance of poetic justice. For example, later in the poem, Dante and Virgil encounter fortune-tellers who must walk forward with their heads on backward, unable to see what is ahead, because they <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the future through forbidden means. Such a contrapasso [...] "functions not merely as a form of divine revenge, but rather as the fulfilment of a destiny freely chosen by each soul during his or her life". People who sinned, but prayed for forgiveness before their deaths are found not in Hell but in Purgatory, where they labour to become free of their sins. Those in Hell are people who tried to justify their sins and are unrepentant. Allegorically, the Inferno represents the Christian soul seeing sin for what it really is.|$|E
2500|$|Pope Pius XII {{approved}} the [...] "Fatima apparitions" [...] in 1940. Four {{times during the}} week that he declared the dogma of the Assumption of Mary (33 years after the actual event said to have occurred in Fatima), Pope Pius XII claimed to have witnessed the same [...] "Miracle of the Sun". At 4:00 pm on 30 October 1950, during {{a walk in the}} Vatican gardens, he arrived at the statue of Our Lady of Lourdes and began to see the miracle. He described himself in his handwritten notes as [...] "awestruck." [...] He saw the same miracle on 31 October, again on 1 November (the date of the definition of the dogma) and then again on 8 November. He wrote that on other days {{at about the same time}} he <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> if he could observe the Miracle of the Sun, but was unable to. He confided this information to a number of Vatican cardinals, to Sr. Pascalina Lehnert (the nun in charge of the papal apartments) and finally to handwritten notes (discovered in 2008) that were later placed on display at the Vatican.|$|E
2500|$|As Emperor Shunzong {{continued}} to be seriously ill and unable to speak, a group of his close associates—the eunuch Li Zhongyan (李忠言), his concubine Consort Niu, the imperial scholars Wang Shuwen and Wang Pi, and the chancellor Wei Zhiyi—became the key decision-makers. [...] It was said that this group of individuals feared Li Chun for his intelligence and decisiveness, and initially, Li Chun was not created crown prince. [...] However, the eunuchs Ju Wenzhen (俱文珍), Liu Guangqi (劉光琦), and Xue Yingzhen (薛盈珍), {{all of whom were}} favored by Emperor Dezong and who lost their power in the new regime, summoned the imperial scholars Zheng, Wei Cigong, Li Cheng, and Wang Ya to the palace to draft an edict for Emperor Shunzong creating Li Chun as crown prince, anyway. [...] Zheng showed a piece of paper to Emperor Shunzong reading, [...] "The Crown Prince should be the oldest son." [...] Emperor Shunzong, who was unable to speak, nodded, and an edict was thereafter issued in late spring 805 creating Li Chun crown prince. [...] The edict also changed Li Chun's name (from 淳 to 純—both rendered [...] "Chun" [...] in modern Mandarin). It was said that Wang Shunwen was so concerned about Li Chun that he was heard reading from Du Fu's poem about the Shu Han regent Zhuge Liang—"He had not even succeeded in his campaigns when he died.

[...] Wang Shuwen and Wei Zhiyi <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> if their group could persuade Li Chun to favor their positions by having their associate Lu Zhi (陸質) serve as the attendant to Li Chun's studies.
