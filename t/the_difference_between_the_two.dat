5|$|Combinatorial {{game theory}} {{provides}} alternative reals as well, with infinite Blue-Red Hackenbush as one particularly relevant example. In 1974, Elwyn Berlekamp described a correspondence between Hackenbush strings and binary expansions of real numbers, {{motivated by the}} idea of data compression. For example, the value of the Hackenbush string LRRLRLRL... is 0.0101012...=. However, the value of LRLLL... (corresponding to 0.111...2) is infinitesimally less than 1. <b>The</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> is the surreal number , where ω is the first infinite ordinal; the relevant game is LRRRR... or 0.000...2. follows directly from Berlekamp's Rule.|$|E
5|$|In the Milky Way it {{has been}} {{discovered}} that {{the large majority of}} the low metallicity clusters are aligned along a plane in the outer part of the galaxy's halo. This result argues in favor of the view that type II clusters in the galaxy were captured from a satellite galaxy, rather than being the oldest members of the Milky Way's globular cluster system as had been previously thought. <b>The</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> cluster types would then be explained by a time delay between when the two galaxies formed their cluster systems.|$|E

In a report published in March 2008 by the Wales Audit Office, the reason for <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> costs were that the original estimate of £12M was not based on any detailed design of the final requirements of the building. Extra costs of the building were due to unforeseen security measures after the 11 September attacks in the United States.|$|E

5|$|By 1878 Warbrick {{had left}} both St Stephen's and Ponsonby and was {{employed}} as a public servant. The work required him to relocate regularly, and he moved throughout the North Island {{for the remainder of}} his rugby career. By 1879 he was living in Wellington, and represented the provincial team three times that season. He played three further matches for Wellington in 1880, including one against his old province of Auckland. The 1880 match, the first in Auckland for Wellington, was won by the visitors 4–0. Warbrick was renowned for his drop-kicking, and his goal in the match was the only score; many Aucklanders claimed that his performance was <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> sides.|$|E
5|$|Mushrooms with an {{appearance}} similar to S.lakei {{can often be}} distinguished by their associations with trees. For example, the eastern North American species S.spraguei grows in association with Eastern White Pine. The cap of S.spraguei has red fibrils on a yellow background. S.cavipes and S.ochraceoroseus always grow with Larch. S.ponderosus, which grows in mixed coniferous forests, has a gelatinous veil. Smith and Thiers note {{that it is difficult}} to tell <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> if S.ponderosus has lost its veil, since the colors of the species intergrade and cannot reliably be used to distinguish them. S.decipiens has a cap that is orangish to pink-orange with hairs or scales. S.caerulescens is a similar species in western North America; it can be distinguished by the strong blue staining that develops when the stem is injured.|$|E
5|$|The 11-century temple-building boom {{continued}} in the 12th century {{with the addition of}} new features. The Mahadeva Temple at Itagi and the Siddhesvara Temple in Haveri are standard constructions incorporating these developments. Based on the general plan of the Amrtesvara Temple at Annigeri, the Mahadeva Temple was built in 1112 CE and has the same architectural components as its predecessor. There are however differences in their articulation; the sala roof (roof under the finial of the superstructure) and the miniature towers on pilasters are chiseled instead of moulded. <b>The</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> temples, built fifty years apart, is the more rigid modelling and decoration found in many components of the Mahadeva Temple. The voluptuous carvings of the 11th century were replaced with a more severe chiselling.|$|E

5|$|On April 27, 2007, ADV Films {{co-founder and}} {{executive}} Matt Greenfield announced {{the acquisition of}} both the anime series and the film during a panel at the anime convention Anime Matsuri; it paid $145,000 for the TV series. The 12 main episodes and two Air in Summer episodes were licensed for North American distribution by ADV Films. The episodes were released on four DVD compilations between August 14 and November 27, 2007. The second DVD volume was sold in two editions, with <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> being a series box all four DVDs could fit inside. In July 2008, the license for the anime series and film was transferred to Funimation, which continued to produce them in North America in English.

5|$|Within {{the scope}} of a popular {{comparison}} that draws parallels between House and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes, Wilson is equivalent to Doctor Watson. In two-parts episodes such as Euphoria, Part 1 and Euphoria, Part 2, and House's Head and Wilson's Heart, Wilson's voice is heard narrating the story, while Dr. Watson is the character who narrates the stories in most of Sherlock Holmes novels. Leonard has said that his character and House were originally intended to play roles similar to Dr. Watson and Sherlock Holmes, respectively, in the series although he believes that House's team has {{assumed the role of}} Watson since the show has begun. Producer Katie Jacobs believes that Wilson and House both hide from mature relationships, which brings the two closer together. She has said that <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> characters is that Wilson finds it hard to say no because he wants to please the other person. The similarities between Dr. Wilson and Dr. Watson {{was also one of the}} reasons that made Leonard choose House over Numb3rs.|$|E
5|$|The {{karyotype}} in T.talamancae is variable. Samples {{from two}} different localities in Venezuela have 34chromosomes and a fundamental number of 64 chromosomal arms (2n=34, FN=64). Four specimens from another Venezuelan locality each have a different karyotype, {{with the number of}} chromosomes ranging from 40 to 42 and the fundamental number from 66 to perhaps 67. The autosomes (non-sex chromosomes) of the 2n=34 karyotype all have two major arms, but the 2n=40–42 karyotypes include several acrocentric autosomes, which only have one major arm. The 2n=34 karyotype includes two large submetacentric pairs, which have two long arms but one distinctly longer than the other, and one pair of subtelocentric chromosomes, with a long and a much shorter arm, but the 2n=40–42 karyotypes lack the submetacentrics and have another pair of subtelocentrics. Both Robertsonian translocations (fusions of the long arm of one chromosome with the long arm of another and the short arm of the one with the short arm of the other) and pericentric inversions (reversals of part of a chromosome that includes the centromere) are needed to explain <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> groups. Musser and colleagues, in discussing these karyotypes, assumed that the 2n=40–42 sample was from within a hybrid zone between two karyotypic morphs.|$|E
