5|$|As a metal, {{titanium}} {{is recognized}} for its high strength-to-weight ratio. It {{is a strong}} metal with low density <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> ductile (especially in an oxygen-free environment), lustrous, and metallic-white in color. The relatively high melting point (more than 1,650°C or 3,000°F) makes it useful as a refractory metal. It is paramagnetic and has fairly low electrical and thermal conductivity.|$|E
5|$|In 1907, Besant {{became the}} {{president}} of the Theosophical Society globally, and set to work with a major expansion of the organisation's headquarters at Adyar, in what was then, Madras. When it was announced that Besant would undertake a speaking tour of Australia in 1908, she was expected to stay with Fuller while in Perth. Some months later in 1908, Fuller left Western Australia and travelled to India, staying at Adyar. Of her time in India, Fuller wrote:I went in search not only of beauty, and light, and colour, and the picturesqueness in general, which delight the eye and emotions of all artists—but of something deeper—something less easily expressed. I spent {{two and a half years}} in a community <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> unique—perhaps the most cosmopolitan settlement in the world—the headquarters of the Theosophical Society... Well, I painted there, of course, but my art was undergoing a change, and I felt that it could not satisfy me unless it became so much greater.|$|E

25|$|Critics {{have been}} divided {{as to the}} {{literary}} merits of Liber Amoris, a deeply personal account of frustrated love <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> unlike anything else Hazlitt ever wrote. Wardle suggests that it was compelling but marred by sickly sentimentality, and also proposes that Hazlitt might even have been anticipating some of the experiments in chronology made by later novelists.|$|E
25|$|More {{recent studies}} of right whales in North Atlantic and the North Pacific suggest a migratory pattern <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> {{different}} than the gray whale example. In the North Atlantic, many right whales remain {{in the northern part}} of their range throughout winter. It appears that while some right whales migrate far south to warmer waters, a substantial percentage of the population either does not migrate as far south or may not migrate at all.|$|E
25|$|There {{is also a}} third {{version of}} the events <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> close to Runciman's, varying only in the minor details. This story {{is part of the}} oral {{tradition}} on the island up to the present time. This oral tradition cannot be verified, but is of interest to sociologists. According to the legend, John of Procida was the mastermind behind the conspiracy. It seems that he was in contact with both Michael VIII Palaiologos and Peter III of Aragon. They were all three later excommunicated by Pope Martin IV in 1282.|$|E

25|$|The {{beginning}} of pregnancy may be detected either based on symptoms {{by the woman}} herself, or by using pregnancy tests. However, an important condition with serious health implications <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> common is the denial of pregnancy by the pregnant woman. About one in 475 denials will last until around the 20th week of pregnancy. The proportion of cases of denial, persisting until delivery is about 1 in 2500. Conversely, some non-pregnant women {{have a very strong}} belief that they are pregnant along with some of the physical changes. This condition is known as a false pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|The general {{movement}} of the EGC is southward along the eastern Greenland continental margin. The currents are quite strong with annual averages of 6–12cm/s in {{the upper part of}} the EGC (<500 m) with inter-annual maximums of 20–30nbsp&cm/s. It was estimated in 1991 by Hopkins et al. that the transport of water southward ranged from 2–32 sverdrups. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> a large variation that they attributed to the widely varying strength of the Atlantic Water flow at intermediate depths. More recent estimations of water transport in the top layers (<800 m) of the EGC is between 3 and 4 sverdrups.|$|E
25|$|Color field, curiously {{enough or}} perhaps not, became a viable way of {{painting}} {{at exactly the}} time that acrylic paint, the new plastic paint, came into being. It {{was as if the}} new paint demanded a new possibility in painting, and the painters arrived at it. Oil paint, which has a medium <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> different, which isn't water-based, always leaves a slick of oil, or puddle of oil, {{around the edge of the}} color. Acrylic paint stops at its own edge. Color field painting came in at the same time as the invention of this new paint.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 13th century, the Seljuq Sultan Kayqubad I (1219–1237) {{built a new}} bridge over {{the remains of the}} late antique structure, which had collapsed, {{probably}} also because of an earthquake. The Seljuq builders followed closely the course of the Roman remains, even in sections where the piers had been partly moved downstream from their original position; as a result, the Seljuq bridge features a quite sharp displacement. This zigzag course, formed by two successive, 90 degree bends, in combination with the pointed arches give the Seljuq-era bridge an appearance <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> distinct from that of its Roman precursor.|$|E
25|$|Race {{board games}} {{involving}} dice have existed for millennia in the Near East and eastern Mediterranean, including the game senet of Ancient Egypt and the Royal Game of Ur in Babylon. The ancient Egyptian game senet was excavated, along with illustrations, from Egyptian royal tombs dating to 3500 BC. Though using a board <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> different from backgammon, {{it may be}} a predecessor. The Royal Game of Ur, originating in ancient Mesopotamia before 2600 BC, may also be an ancestor of modern-day table games like backgammon. It used tetrahedral dice. In the modern Middle East, backgammon is a common feature of coffeehouses.|$|E
25|$|Clayton and Bell {{excelled in}} their use of colour. The {{designing}} of a stained glass window that “works” from a visual point of view is a more complex matter than simply drawing up a cartoon and painting the colours in. What works on paper does not necessarily work when it has the added element of light streaming through it. Some colours are notoriously difficult. Blue glass, frequently used for backgrounds, can create a halo effect that dominates the window. Red and blue together can create a jumping discordant pattern <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> nasty to look at. Faces can bleach out completely. Green can simply turn black.|$|E

25|$|Placing a {{conductive}} {{thick plate}} as a heat transfer interface between a heat source {{and a cold}} flowing fluid (or any other heat sink) may improve the cooling performance. In such arrangement, the heat source is cooled under the thick plate instead of being cooled {{in direct contact with}} the cooling fluid. It is shown that the thick plate can significantly improve the heat transfer between the heat source and the cooling fluid by way of conducting the heat current in an optimal manner. The two most attractive advantages of this method are that no additional pumping power and no extra heat transfer surface area, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> different from fins (extended surfaces).|$|E
25|$|Since monotremes, {{egg-laying}} mammals, {{are considered}} to represent one of the evolutionarily oldest groups of mammals, they {{have been subject to}} special interest in the study of mammalian sleep. As early studies of these animals could not find clear evidence for REM sleep, it was initially assumed that such sleep did not exist in monotremes, but developed after the monotremes branched {{off from the rest of}} the mammalian evolutionary line, and became a separate, distinct group. However, EEG recordings of the brain stem in monotremes show a firing pattern <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> similar to the patterns seen in REM sleep in higher mammals. In fact, the largest amount of REM sleep known in any animal is found in the platypus. REM electrical activation does not extend at all to the forebrain—suggesting that platypods do not dream. The average sleep time in a 24-hour period of a platypus is said to be as long as 14 hours; though this may be because of their high-calorie crustacean diet.|$|E

His researches, initially guided by Meyer-Eppler, have a coherence unlike any other composer then or since" [...] Maconie also compares Stockhausen to Beethoven: [...] "If a genius is someone whose ideas survive all attempts at explanation, then by that definition Stockhausen is the nearest thing to Beethoven this century has produced. Reason? His music lasts" [...] , and [...] "As Stravinsky said, one never thinks of Beethoven as a superb orchestrator because the quality of invention transcends mere craftsmanship. It is the same with Stockhausen: the intensity of imagination gives rise to musical impressions of an elemental and seemingly unfathomable beauty, arising from necessity rather than conscious design" [...]|$|E

500|$|Let Me In: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack is the film's soundtrack album. It was {{released}} by Varèse Sarabande on October 12, 2010. The score was composed by Michael Giacchino. Giacchino stated that scoring the film was a difficult [...] "balancing act" [...] for some scenes. He mentioned, [...] "I {{was always trying to}} say, 'let's take music out!' and Matt [...] was like, 'no, put it in!'" [...] In composing the score, he stated that he also applied certain musical themes to each character for which the audience could respond to as the story progressed. Composing the score to convey the correct emotion was also a challenge for Giacchino who said, [...] "…it was tricky finding the right balance of, well, should this be scary? Or should this be sentimental? Or should it be emotional? Or should it be this? It was a weird balance because you're dealing with a dynamic <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> questionable as far as what everyone's intentions are in the film.|$|E
