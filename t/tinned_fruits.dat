40|$|Several {{studies have}} shown that {{low-cost}} foods have an equivalent nutrient composition compared to high-cost foods, but such information is lacking in Switzerland. Thus, we compared the caloric and nutrient content of "best price" (BPF) and brand name foods (BNF) in Switzerland using the version 5. 0 (April 2015) of the Swiss Food and Nutrient composition database. Over 4000 processed food items were included and 26 food categories were compared regarding total energy, protein, fat and carbohydrates, saturated fatty acids, sugar, fiber and sodium. BPF, namely core food categories like Bread, Red meat, White meat and Fish products, were 42 %, 39 %, 42 % and 46 % less expensive than their BNF equivalents, respectively. No differences were found between BPF and BNF regarding total energy and protein, fat and carbohydrates for most food categories. In the Cheese category, BPF had a lower caloric content than BNF [Median (interquartile range, IQR) : 307 (249 - 355) vs. 365 (308 - 395) kcal/ 100  g, respectively, p <  0. 001]; BPF also had lower fat and saturated fatty acid content but higher carbohydrate content than BNF (both p <  0. 01). In the Creams and puddings group, BPF had lower fat 1. 3 (0. 9 - 1. 7) vs. 6. 0 (3. 5 - 11. 0) g/ 100  g and saturated fatty acid 0. 6 (0. 6 - 0. 8) vs. 2. 9 (2. 3 - 6. 0) g/ 100  g content than BNF (both p <  0. 005). In the <b>Tinned</b> <b>fruits</b> and vegetables group, BPF had lower sodium content than BNF: 175 (0 - 330) vs. 370 (150 - 600) mg/ 100  g, p =  0. 006.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to analyze the {{differences}} between Saudis and resident foreigners in the pattern of expenditure on food commodities in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The economic indicators provided by the study may help decision makers when they decide policies concerning the reduction of foreign labor in the Saudi economy. The study relied on cross sectional data from the family budget survey conducted in the Kingdom. Quantitative analysis and statistical tests were utilized. The results of the study showed that the average expenditures for Saudi household on bread and cereals, meat and poultry, dairy products, cooking oils and fats, and drinks were higher than those for foreign resident households. However, the average expenditures on smoking, food and drinks away from home were higher in foreign households than Saudi households, single and aggregate semi-logarithmic consumption-expenditure functions were estimated for each food commodity for Saudis and foreigners. The test of homogenity of regression was applied. Food commodities were categorized in two main groups according to the results of the test. The first group included the food commodities with consumption-expenditure functions which were different between Saudis and foreigners. These commodities were: bread and cereals, meat and poultry, dairy products, cooking oils and fats, fresh vegetables, pulses, fresh fruits, drinks, tobacco, and food away from home. The second group included the food commodities with consumption-expenditure functions which were homogenous for Saudis and foreigners. These com¬modities were fish and shell, fish, eggs, preserved and tinned vegetables, tubers, preserved and <b>tinned</b> <b>fruits,</b> sugar and sugar products, nuts, and other foods. Even though the consumption-expenditure elasticity on food, drinks, and tobacco for Saudis was equal to 0. 54 which was larger than that for foreigners (0. 49), yet the situation varied between com¬modities. It is expected, according to the results of this study that the reduction of foreign labor in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia would result in a decrease in food consumption as well. The pattern of change would vary according to the commodities. The consumers of restaurants would be highly decreased. The consumption of tobacco - and accordingly its imports - would decrease. The changes in the levels of total expenditures would be accompanied with lower response in the expenditure on cooking oils and fats, and food and drinks away from home. It would also be accompanied with a higher response in the expenditure on bread and cereals, meat and poultry, dairy products, fresh vegetables, pulses, fresh fruits, and drinks...|$|E

40|$|Background:  Dietary {{guidelines}} promote {{good nutrition}} through healthy eating. Chewing deficiencies may hinder food intake while lower socio-economic status (SES) may restrict food purchasing. The {{aim was to}} examine compliance of grocery purchasing behaviour with dietary guidelines by chewing ability and SES. Methods:  Adults aged 60 – 71 years in Adelaide, South Australia were surveyed in 2008. Dietary guideline compliance was measured using 16 grocery purchasing items. Chewing ability {{was based on a}} 5 -item Chewing Index. SES was assessed using a subjective social status rating representing where people stand in society. Results:  Responses were collected from n = 444 persons (response rate = 68. 8 %). Among dentate persons, 10. 3 % were chewing deficient and 21. 3 % were in the lower SES group. Prevalence ratios (PR: 95 %CI) controlling for SES showed chewing deficiency was related to (p < 0. 05) non-compliance with dietary guidelines in relation to bread (1. 7 : 1. 1 – 2. 5), juice (2. 7 : 1. 6 – 4. 5), <b>tinned</b> <b>fruit</b> (2. 9 : 1. 5 – 5. 6), yoghurt (2. 1 : 1. 2 – 3. 7) and tinned fish (1. 5 : 1. 2 – 1. 9).

Chewing deficiency may have a direct effect on diet as well as reflect a clustering of risk in relation to a range of health behaviours. David S. Brennan, Kiran A. Sing...|$|R
