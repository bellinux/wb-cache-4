25|$|A {{stranger}} is {{far enough}} away that he is unknown but close enough {{that it is possible}} to get to know him. In a society there must be a stranger. If everyone is known then there is no person that is able <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>something</b> new to everybody.|$|E
25|$|The main phase occurs {{immediately}} after the draw phase. During the main phase, a player may play any card {{from his or her}} hand unless that card specifies otherwise, and as long as he or she has the mana to pay its casting cost. This means creature, planeswalker, sorcery, instant, land, enchantment, and artifact cards are all acceptable to play. This is a player's chance <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>something</b> onto the field.|$|E

25|$|Wing was set {{to appear}} in a stage play of Adrian Mole, which would have clashed with the filming of EastEnders. Julia Smith refused to offer her any leeway and {{informed}} {{her that she had}} to take a gamble — she could either turn down the play, meaning that if she failed to get the part of Lou she would have lost two jobs, or she could give up the possibility of playing Lou and accept the play. Wing decided to turn down the play and she was subsequently given the role of Lou. An early choice in the casting process, Wing had the face, voice and attitude that Tony Holland had imagined for the character. She was told by producers <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>something</b> from her own background to the role.|$|E
500|$|Santa Claus Conquers the Martians (1964) {{regularly}} {{appears on}} {{lists of the}} worst films ever made. Paul Jacobson, the film's producer and a former unit manager for the television program, Howdy Doody, described his film as a [...] "Yuletide science fiction fantasy", and {{with the best of}} intentions, hoped <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>something</b> to movie theaters at a time of the year when there was a paucity of children's entertainment other than the annual Disney feature.|$|E
500|$|Stefani {{initially}} {{announced the}} tour alongside {{a partnership with}} MasterCard on December 8, 2014; the partnership enabled MasterCard holders to win several different prizes, including handbags, golf getaways, and concert tickets to see Stefani perform live. The collaboration began with a 30-second television commercial announcing the partnership and debuting Stefani's single, [...] "Spark the Fire". In an interview with MasterCard regarding the concert series, Stefani {{said that she was}} [...] "excited {{to be part of a}} collaboration that offers me the opportunity to connect and engage with fans through amazing surprises when they least expect it," [...] further stating that she [...] "look forward to working with them <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>something</b> truly unique to fans.” ...|$|E

500|$|Zara Golden of VH1 {{regarding}} the video commented that, although Usher {{had a lot}} of troubles in his life [...] "he gives the kid a hug, enjoys a dance at the strip club (why not?) and sings out all the rest in a recording booth." [...] Billboards David Greenwald praised the choreography and noted that Usher shows no signs of sickness as he performs the compound choreography, [...] "which ends with a forceful escape". Sam Lansky of Idolator was divided on the video and wrote that the singer [...] "could have dug a little deeper to tap into some of that very real personal pain <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>something</b> more emotionally charged to this video; as it stands, it’s a little too polished to feel anything but contrived." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{releasing}} Stripped (2002) and {{collaborating with}} many different artists, Aguilera decided to record new old-school style materials for her upcoming album. She later {{explained that the}} lengthy break allowed her to write {{a lot about what}} she had experienced during that time. Aguilera also explained that she wanted <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>something</b> novel to her album, which has 24 songs on it. She wanted to try to evolve as an artist and a visionary. As a result, Back to Basics, Aguilera's fifth studio album, is made up of two discs. On the first disc, she worked with [...] "more beat-driven" [...] producers, such as DJ Premier and Mark Ronson, who included samples in the production. The second one was written and produced solely by longtime producer Linda Perry. Aguilera sent letters to different producers that she hoped could help her with the direction she was taking for the project, encouraging them to experiment, re-invent and create a modern soul feel. She described the first disc as [...] "kind of a throwback with elements of jazz, blues and soul music combined with a modern-day twist, like hard-hitting beats".|$|E
500|$|Reflecting on the serial, Nigel Kneale said, [...] "Frankly, I {{was never}} {{happy with the}} whole idea in the first place. The central idea was too ordinary". Although Kneale {{was pleased with the}} high {{production}} values, he was dissatisfied with the casting, believing that John Mills [...] "didn't have the authority for Quatermass". He was similarly unimpressed with Simon MacCorkindale, noting that [...] "We had him in Beasts playing an idiot and he was very good at that". Kneale disliked the depiction of the Planet People, as his inspiration had been angry punks rather than hippies (as evidenced by his portrayal of Kickalong as a gun-toting lunatic who commits multiple motiveless murders). Producer Ted Childs thinks that [...] "the primary problems with it were (a) it was perhaps too depressing a story for a popular television audience and (b) the punters were used to a fairly high standard of technical presentation from American television... And we just couldn't afford that". Executive producer Verity Lambert's opinion is that it [...] "didn't have the staying power of the originals, but then that's almost inevitable when you try <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>something</b> back in a slightly different form".|$|E
6000|$|... “Thanks, I’m afraid not,” Jimmy answered. “Perhaps I {{had better}} get my {{business}} done. I really came because Clay asked it; he made me promise <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> you <b>something.</b> I left it in the hall.” ...|$|R

6000|$|... "You are right," [...] {{answered}} Snap. [...] "And {{that proves}} that the deer have been here since that heavy rain. Now, boys, if we follow this trail with care {{we may be able}} <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> down <b>something</b> worth while." ...|$|R
500|$|Windsor's final episode on 10 September 2010 did not {{end with}} the usual EastEnders theme tune. Instead the {{occasionally}} used [...] "Julia's Theme", a piano version of the theme, was reworked specially for the broadcast, and given the name [...] "Peggy's Theme". The theme {{was created by the}} original theme tune composer, Simon May, who was reportedly thrilled to write the theme tune for Windsor. He added more piano to the theme and gave it a [...] "more melancholy feel". May composed the theme not knowing what would happen on screen, but when Kirkwood brought a rough edit of the episode, May noted that the music fitted perfectly first time, saying it was [...] "remarkable and very moving." [...] The theme features as the lead track on the album The Simon May Collection and was also released as an EP available to download immediately after the episode. He revealed: [...] "All the actors and crew had made a really special couple of shows. My main purpose was <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>something</b> to the table, and I didn't {{think it would be a}} single. [...] But when everybody heard the track they said 'you've got to release that as the single because it's something special'." ...|$|E
2500|$|IGN critic Eric Goldman {{scored the}} film at 9.0/10 upon {{his review of}} the Blu-ray release. He praised the film as [...] "one {{of the best of}} 2009" [...] and {{particularly}} complimented the innovative nature of the story in an often clichéd genre; [...] "500 Days of Summer proved there is a way <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>something</b> fresh and new {{to one of the most}} cliché and often frustrating genres – the romantic comedy".|$|E
2500|$|Moffat {{felt that}} it was {{important}} <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>something</b> different to the return of Billie Piper, as she had returned as Rose Tyler in various cameo appearances throughout series 4, most prominently in the finale [...] "The Stolen Earth"/"Journey's End", in which she had a central role, and The End of Time. This {{led to the development of}} the Moment, which had previously been referenced in The End of Time. Piper agreed with Moffat's sentiments, despite loving the character of Rose.|$|E
5000|$|While touring Portugal {{from north}} to south, the band—along with its management, NZ Produções—decided <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> in <b>something</b> new <b>to</b> their concerts. This took the girls back to studio {{recording}} to do a cover of the Patti LaBelle song, [...] "Lady Marmalade".|$|R
5000|$|On Stern's show, Melendez's {{primary role}} was {{answering}} phones and screening listener calls {{before they were}} allowed on the air. That often entailed intentionally [...] "stirring the pot" [...] by putting through callers willing to say <b>something</b> outrageous or <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> up <b>something</b> that would get a reaction from the guest that's on the air.|$|R
60|$|But Frank was well; both {{in health}} and spirits. He also felt as Mary did, that the day was <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> forth <b>something</b> which should end his present troubles; {{and he could not}} but be happy to think that he could now tell Dr Thorne that his father's consent to his {{marriage}} had been given.|$|R
2500|$|Gregory James Jenkins {{composed}} {{the music for}} the film, having previously written the music for two of Strauss-Schulson's short films and debut feature A Very Harold & Kumar 3D Christmas (2011). Jenkins stated, [...] "One {{of the biggest challenges}} was trying to create a score that was heavily steeped in 1980's while still trying <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>something</b> new to the table... This is not your typical film score, as it's mostly electronic based... A lot of analog synths were used." ...|$|E
2500|$|Pauline Kieman makes a {{very good}} case that the first quatrain in Sonnet 59 is dealing {{primarily}} with the theme of biological birth and pregnancy. [...] She makes many claims supporting this idea, but the main points are as follows: 1. Invention becomes an image of pregnancy, and imaginative creation is now the dominating sense of invention so that we are made to picture to ourselves an embryo growing in the womb. [...] 2. At line 4 {{the sense of the}} pain of a heavily pregnant womb is doubled by the word [...] "second". 3. The poet tries <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>something</b> into being for the first time, but before it can get born it is crushed under the weight of previous creations. [...] e.g. [...] "which for labouring invention bear amiss." ...|$|E
2500|$|Plants vs. Zombies {{director}} George Fan intended on {{balancing the}} game between a [...] "gritty" [...] {{game and a}} [...] "sickeningly cute" [...] game. Strong strategic elements were included to appeal to more experienced gamers, while keeping it simple to appeal to casual gamers, without many tutorials. He was inspired {{to make it a}} tower defense game after both thinking of a more defense-oriented version of a previous title of his, Insaniquarium, and playing some Warcraft III tower defense mods. While he was looking at the towers in Warcraft III, he felt that plants would make good towers. He wanted <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>something</b> new to the genre with Plants vs. Zombies, and he found common tower defense game play elements such as mazing and juggling to be too awkward, causing him to use the five- and six-lane set-ups that were used in the final version. The game was initially going to be called Weedlings, but as the tower defense concept took off and the personality of the game as a whole evolved, the title was later changed.|$|E

60|$|I'll {{make this}} boys' book {{business}} pay; but I {{have to make}} a beginning. When I'm done with YOUNG FOLKS, I'll try Routledge or some one. I feel pretty sure the 'Sea Cook' will do <b>to</b> reprint, and <b>bring</b> <b>something</b> decent at that.|$|R
60|$|But Rectus did worry. I {{must have}} looked frightened when I came up, and I believe he had caught the scare. Boys will do that. The captain tried {{to keep me from}} going in again, but I knew it was all {{nonsense}} to be frightened. I was going <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> up <b>something</b> from the bottom, if it was only a pebble.|$|R
2500|$|Commenting on theatre {{fires in}} his December 1905 {{address to the}} American Society of Mechanical Engineers, Society President John R. Freeman found {{significant}} antecedents in the Brooklyn Theatre fire to the then-recent Iroquois Theatre fire, the 1881 Vienna Ringtheater fire and the 1887 Exeter Theatre Fire: stages crowded with scenery, an onrush of air from opening doors or windows, scant smoke vents over the stage, this giving rise to an outburst of smoke from under the proscenium arch with concomitant deadly effects upon upper gallery occupants. These observations, made twenty-nine years after the fact, resonate with those made {{on the night of}} the Brooklyn Theatre fire. Engineer Fred J. Manning, Engine Number 5, arriving at 11:22pm, testified that the [...] scene doors were about two-thirds open, with [...] "one or two men attempting <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>something</b> out of these doors." [...] Abner C. Keeny, part owner and contractor of the building, commenting on the fire the following morning, believed that the sudden inrush of air from the scenic entrance fanned the fire and triggered its spread from the stage to the theatre at large, leading to the rapid advance of smoke onto the family circle.|$|E
2500|$|Intention (1957) is {{also the}} classic source for {{the idea that there}} is a {{difference}} in [...] "direction of fit" [...] between cognitive states like beliefs and conative states like desire. Cognitive states describe the world and are causally derived from the facts or objects they depict. Conative states do not describe the world, but aim <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>something</b> about in the world. Anscombe used the example of a shopping list to illustrate the difference. The list can be a straightforward observational report of what is actually bought (thereby acting like a cognitive state), or it can function as a conative state such as a command or desire, dictating what the agent should buy. If the agent fails to buy what is listed, we do not say that the list is untrue or incorrect; we say that the mistake is in the action, not the desire. According to Anscombe, this difference in direction of fit is a major difference between speculative knowledge (theoretical, empirical knowledge) and practical knowledge (knowledge of actions and morals). Whereas [...] "speculative knowledge" [...] is [...] "derived from the objects known", practical knowledge is – in a phrase Anscombe lifts from Aquinas – [...] "the cause of what it understands".|$|E
2500|$|Following the {{aggressive}} focus on musical instruction within Rock Band 3, Rock Band 4 instead puts a larger {{focus on the}} franchise's core gameplay, multiplayer, and the overall feeling of the experience; Rigopulos felt that the franchise had become too [...] "sprawling" [...] in functionality, and that [...] "there is an existing gameplay core that is very powerful and very fun, and we don't want to tamper with that core. At the same time, we need <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>something</b> new to the experience." [...] Owing to this renewed focus, the Pro Guitar and piano keyboard modes were dropped from the game. Rigopulos stated that Ubisoft's competing Rocksmith series [...] "is serving the audience that wants actual guitar instrumental instruction very well." [...] The new Freestyle Guitar Solo feature was something that Harmonix had built a prototype for in early 2014; {{at the time they}} did not have a clear concept of its use but found the mechanic to have potential and built up parts of Rock Band 4 around it. Rigopulos also noted that they were not trying to develop Rock Band 4 with competition from Guitar Hero Live in mind; that competition had caused the original over-saturation of the rhythm game market in 2009. With Rock Band 4, Harmonix' goal is a smaller but known fraction of the market of both old Rock Band players and new ones, such that meeting those numbers would make the game financially viable even if it does not outsell Guitar Hero Live. This goal also helps to manage the costs of the game as {{they do not have to}} manufacture as many instrument sets as they had done previously.|$|E

50|$|In {{technology}} terms, downscaling means <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> down <b>something,</b> usually {{referring to}} the resolution. In video games downscaling is a method used to improve image quality. What happens is that the computer renders a higher resolution image than the monitor displaying it. An example of downscaling would be the computer rendering a 4096 x 2160 (4k) image, and then displaying it on a 1920X1080 monitor.|$|R
