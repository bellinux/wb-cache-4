5|$|His {{first major}} task was the {{creation}} of the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). The government established a joint Army–Navy board to provide recommendations on <b>the</b> <b>matter,</b> <b>with</b> Blamey and Lieutenant Colonel Richard Williams as the Army representatives. Blamey supported the creation of a separate air force, albeit one still subordinate to the Army and Navy. He refused to yield, however, on his opposition to the Navy's demand that Lieutenant Colonel Stanley Goble become its first chief.|$|E
5|$|Hughes {{insisted that}} there was nothing more they could do to deter Rhodesia directly; they had already {{threatened}} to expel Rhodesia's representative from the British Embassy in Washington, with no effect. The only open course therefore had to be to take a firmer line with Portugal. Two days later, on 7 September, Wilson discussed <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>with</b> Hughes and Stewart, and agreed with their conclusions, telling them to proceed.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, the ACLU {{sued the}} federal {{government}} in American Civil Liberties Union v. Ashcroft on behalf of Nicholas Merrill, owner of an Internet service provider. Under the provisions of the Patriot Act, the government had issued national security letters to Merrill to compel him to provide private Internet access information from some of his customers. In addition, the government placed a gag order on Merrill, forbidding him from discussing <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>with</b> anyone.|$|E

5|$|Alan Brooke, {{commander}} of the British II Corps sought to put the matter of cooperation right with King Leopold. The King discussed <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>with</b> Brooke, who felt a compromise could be reached. Van Overstraeten, the King's military aide, stepped in {{and said that the}} 10th Belgian Infantry Division could not be moved. Instead, the British should move further south and remain completely clear of Brussels. Brooke told the King that the 10th Belgian Division was {{on the wrong side of}} the Gamelin line and was exposed. Leopold deferred to his advisor and chief of staff. Brooke found Overstaeten to be ignorant of the situation and the dispositions of the BEF. Given that the left flank of the BEF rested on its Belgian ally, the British were now unsure about Belgian military capabilities.|$|E
5|$|As Captain Picard and Commander Data (Brent Spiner) discuss <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>with</b> the Ventaxian leader (Marcelo Tubert), a woman {{appears in}} the chamber, announcing herself as Ardra. She proves her {{identity}} by starting an earthquake at will, and transforming into both the Christian and then the Klingon devil. Ardra states that {{she has come to}} claim the planet. Picard is instantly suspicious and orders Data to examine the contract that supposedly was signed by Ardra and the leaders of the planet a thousand years ago. Picard returns to the Enterprise afterwards, and Ardra appears on the bridge sitting in the Captain's chair. Security Chief Worf (Michael Dorn) tries to remove her without success, Data returns just then and confirms the language of the contract as well as Ardra's claim to the planet, including anything in orbit, including the Enterprise.|$|E

5|$|Collins {{discussed}} the possible {{use of nuclear}} weapons in Korea with MacArthur in December, and later asked him for a list of targets in the Soviet Union in case it entered the war. MacArthur testified before the Congress in 1951 that he had never recommended the {{use of nuclear weapons}}. He did at one point consider a plan to cut off North Korea with radioactive poisons; he did not recommend it at the time, although he later broached <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>with</b> Eisenhower, then president-elect, in 1952. In 1954, in an interview published after his death, he stated he had wanted to drop atomic bombs on enemy bases, but in 1960, he challenged a statement by Truman that he had advocated using atomic bombs. Truman issued a retraction, stating that he had no evidence of the claim; it was merely his personal opinion.|$|E
5|$|Guido Forti, after {{discussing}} <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>with</b> commercial rights-owner Bernie Ecclestone, {{had decided}} to withdraw the team from the German GP as negotiations over the team's ownership between himself and Shannon continued, despite {{the threat of the}} FIA (F1's governing body) imposing a fine on the outfit for missing the race. Following the failure of these negotiations, he then announced that Shannon's deal had fallen through and that he was back in charge of the team. He hoped to finalise some more sponsorship deals which would allow Forti to compete in the Hungarian GP. Shannon responded by claiming it still owned 51% of the team, and that it intended to solve Forti's financial problems itself, in addition to replacing Guido Forti as Team Principal. He duly took the company to court over the matter, an arduous process in the Italian legal system.|$|E
5|$|Having taken {{office in}} 1805, Shaw {{determined}} to re-establish the tradition whereby the Lord Mayor took precedence in public processions within the City of London over all except the reigning monarch, {{and took the}} opportunity of the funeral of Lord Nelson in 1806 to do so. According to one account, Shaw discussed <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>with</b> the Prime Minister, Lord Liverpool, who was aware that the Prince Regent would be attending the funeral, but did not seem willing to take action. Shaw then offered to visit the King himself at Windsor Castle to resolve the matter, and Liverpool {{said that he would}} see what could be done. By the following day, the Royal Warrant of Precedence had been granted, and Shaw duly led the procession.|$|E

40|$|The {{physical}} {{aspect of}} a general perturbation theory is explored. Its role as a physical principle for understanding the interaction among <b>the</b> <b>matters</b> <b>with</b> different levels of hierarchy is appreciated. It is shown that the general perturbation theory can not only be used for understanding the various electronic phenomena including the nature of chemical bonds but {{also serve as a}} unified theme for constructing general electronic structure theories and calculation schemes. Perturbation theory is {{regarded as one of the}} two major approaches for approximately solving quantum many-body problems. However, its deeper physical aspect is far more than it is currently being used just as a mathematical tool for solving the complicated issues. All the fundamental laws in physics are variational in nature, including the Schrödinger equation in 1 quantum mechanics. Nevertheless, the perturbation theory provides a principle that governs how <b>the</b> <b>matters</b> <b>with</b> different levels of hierarchy interact...|$|R
5|$|In 1826, {{shortly after}} the death of his father, Meyerbeer married his cousin, Minna Mosson (1804–1886). The {{marriage}} which may have been 'dynastic' in its origins proved to be stable and devoted; the couple were to have five children, of whom the three youngest (all daughters) survived to adulthood. In the same year, following the death of Carl Maria von Weber, Weber's widow asked Meyerbeer to complete her husband's unfinished comic opera Die drei Pintos. This was to cause him much trouble over future years, as he found the material insufficient to work on. Eventually in 1852 he settled <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>with</b> Weber's heirs by handing them Weber's drafts and a cash compensation. (The opera was later completed by Gustav Mahler).|$|E
5|$|In September 1943, the Los Alamos Laboratory's director, Robert Oppenheimer, {{arranged}} for von Neumann to visit Los Alamos and investigate implosion {{with a fresh}} set of eyes. After reviewing Neddermeyer's studies, and discussing <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>with</b> Edward Teller, von Neumann suggested the use of high explosive in shaped charges to implode a sphere, which he showed could not only result in a faster assembly of fissile material than was possible with the gun method, but which could greatly {{reduce the amount of}} material required. The prospect of more efficient nuclear weapons impressed Oppenheimer, Teller and Hans Bethe, but they decided that an expert on explosives was required. Kistiakowsky's name was immediately suggested, and he was brought into the project as a consultant in October 1943.|$|E
5|$|In early 1944, Smyth {{raised the}} {{possibility}} of producing an unclassified report for the general public on the achievements of the Manhattan Project. The director of the Metallurgical Laboratory, Arthur Compton, supported the idea. He arranged a meeting with James B. Conant, the President of Harvard University and one of the senior administrators of the Manhattan Project, who had similar thoughts. Conant took up <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>with</b> the Manhattan Project's director, Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr.. In April, Smyth received a formal letter from Groves asking him to write such a report. Both the report and the choice of Smyth as its author were approved by the Manhattan Project’s governing body, the Military Policy Committee, in May 1944.|$|E

5|$|Northcott {{spent much}} of his time from 1943 on in a long battle with the {{government}} over the number of men and women allocated to the Army. He attempted to do so without Blamey being dragged into a political fight but this proved to be impossible. In September 1944, the government reduced the Army's monthly intake of women from 925 to 500, while it only received 420 out of 4,020 men allocated to the three services. Such a meagre allocation was below what the Army needed to maintain its strength, and formations had to be disbanded. Blamey took up <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>with</b> Prime Minister John Curtin, and managed to get a more satisfactory monthly allocation of 1,500 men per month out of 3,000 allocated to the three services.|$|E
5|$|The Harlem Globetrotters invited Russell to {{join their}} {{exhibition}} basketball squad.

While Saperstein spoke to Woolpert in a meeting, Globetrotters assistant coach Harry Hanna tried to entertain Russell with jokes. The USF center was livid after this snub and declined the offer: he reasoned that if Saperstein was too smart to speak with him, then he was too smart to play for Saperstein. Instead, Russell made himself eligible for the 1956 NBA draft.|$|E

On 19 February 1942, MacDonald, Thomson and Wallace Akers, the director of Tube Alloys, met with C. J. Mackenzie, the president of the NRC, who enthusiastically supported the proposal. The following day he took them to see C. D. Howe, the Minister of Munitions and Supply.|$|E

5|$|Though Thomas Higgins's {{death by}} {{apparent}} dysentery raised no {{questions for the}} attending doctor, Higgins's brother Patrick was {{surprised to hear that}} his brother, who had been strong and in good general health, could have succumbed so easily to illness. When he also discovered that his brother has been insured with five different burial societies, which left his widow with a profit of around £100, he pursued <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>with</b> the authorities. A postmortem examination was ordered on Higgins's body. To the surprise of mourners, the coroner arrived at the home to perform the examination during the wake being held there for Higgins. Catherine Flannagan, upon hearing that a full autopsy was to be performed, fled the home.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of England's second innings, Washbrook took a single from Lindwall, who {{promptly}} removed Emmett for a duck. Lindwall pitched an outswinger on the line of off stump and Emmett edged it to wicket-keeper Tallon, who dived and took it in his right hand. This brought Lindwall’s tormentor Edrich to the crease. Bradman advised Lindwall not to bounce Edrich, fearing this would be interpreted as retaliation and generate negative media attention. However, Miller retaliated with four consecutive bouncers, angering the crowd. He struck Edrich on the body before Bradman and ordered him to stop; the Australian captain apologised to Edrich for the hostile bowling. Lindwall bounced Washbrook and was no balled by umpire Dai Davies for dragging his foot beyond the line. After a disagreement, Davies threw Lindwall his jumper, but the tension faded away and the paceman was not no balled again after discussing <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>with</b> Bradman. Lindwall bounced Washbrook again {{and this time the}} England opener went for the hook shot. The ball flew off the top edge in the air, straight towards Hassett at fine leg, who dropped the catch after juggling three times. Having received a reprieve on 21, Washbrook settled down and reached 50 in only 70 minutes with England at 1/80.|$|E
