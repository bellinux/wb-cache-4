This led to escalated fighting until a cease-fire agreement later that year that allowed for the stationing of Syrian troops within Lebanon. The Syrian presence in Lebanon quickly changed sides; soon after they entered Lebanon they had flip-flopped and began to fight the Christian nationalists in Lebanon they allegedly entered the country to protect. The Kateab Party and the Lebanese Forces under Bachir Gemayel strongly resisted the Syrians in Lebanon. In 1989, 40,000 Syrian troops remained {{in central and eastern}} Lebanon {{under the supervision of the}} Syrian government.

500|$|Observers {{were posted}} to Spanish ports and borders, and both Ribbentrop and Grandi {{were told to}} agree to the plan, {{significant}} shipments already having taken place. Portugal would not accept observers, although it did agree to personnel attached to the British Embassy in Lisbon. The cost of the scheme was put at £898,000; Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Russia would each pay 16%; the other 20% would be met by the other 22 countries. Zones of patrol were assigned to each of the four nations; an International Board was set up to administer the scheme. The setting up of the scheme took until April. For the Republicans, this seemed like adding insult to injury – the wholesale <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>arms</b> to the Nationalists would now be policed by the very countries supplying them. Despite accusations that 60,000 Italians were now in Spain, and Grandi's announcement that he hoped no Italian volunteer would leave until the war was over, the German delegation appears to have hoped the control plan was effective. There were Italian assurances that Italy would not break up non-intervention.|$|E

50|$|Passage <b>of</b> <b>Arms</b> (1959), by Eric Ambler, is a fast-paced thriller {{about the}} {{discovery}} of a cache <b>of</b> <b>arms,</b> abandoned by Communist insurgents in the Malayan jungle, and the later <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> the <b>arms</b> via Singapore to Indonesia. The novel is structured as three connected stories.

Krishnan′s story of business ambition leads to the story of an entrepreneurial Chinese trading family who arrange the <b>transferring</b> <b>of</b> the <b>arms.</b> The central, third story features an American couple, Greg and Dorothy Nilsen, who are tourists of the Far East used to legitimize the transaction, and so find themselves in great danger — the recurrent theme of ″innocents abroad″ that characterizes the novels of Eric Ambler.|$|R

40|$|Arm {{movements}} after perturbations like {{tripping over}} an obstacle {{have been suggested}} to be aspecific startle responses, serve a protective function or contribute to balance recovery. This study aimed at determining if and how arm movements play a functional role in balance recovery after a perturbation. We tripped young subjects using an obstacle that suddenly appeared from the floor at exactly mid-swing. We measured arm muscle EMG, quantified body rotations after tripping, and established the effects <b>of</b> <b>arm</b> movements by calculating how the body would have rotated without arms. Strong asymmetric shoulder muscle responses were observed within 100 ms after trip initiation. Significantly faster and larger responses {{were found in the}} contralateral arm abductors on the non-tripped (right) side. Mean amplitudes were larger in the ipsilateral retroflexors and contralateral anteflexors. The resulting asymmetric arm movements had a small effect on body rotation in the sagittal and frontal planes, but substantially affected the body orientation in the transverse plane. With the enlargement <b>of</b> the ongoing <b>arm</b> swing, the arms contributed to balance recovery by postponing the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>arm</b> angular momentum to the trunk. This resulted in an axial rotation of the lower segments of the body towards the non-tripped side, which increases the length of the recovery step in the sagittal plane, and therefore facilitates braking the impending fall. © 2009 Springer-Verlag...|$|R
