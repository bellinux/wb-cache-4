25|$|Ben Goldacre {{has argued}} that {{regulators}} – such as the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the UK, or the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States – advance the interests of <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> <b>companies</b> rather than {{the interests of the}} public due to revolving door exchange of employees between the regulator and the companies and friendships develop between regulator and company employees. He argues that regulators do not require that new drugs offer an improvement over what is already available, or even that they be particularly effective.|$|E
500|$|Chapter three {{describes}} {{the concept of}} [...] "regulatory capture," [...] whereby a regulator– such as the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the UK, or the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States– ends up advancing the interests of <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> <b>companies</b> rather than {{the interests of the}} public. Goldacre writes that this happens for a number of reasons, including the revolving door of employees between the regulator and the companies, and the fact that friendships develop between regulator and company employees simply because they have knowledge and interests in common. The chapter also discusses surrogate outcomes and accelerated approval, and the difficulty of having ineffective drugs removed from the market once they have been approved. He argues that regulators do not require that new drugs offer an improvement over what is already available, or even that they be particularly effective.|$|E
50|$|A {{request for}} Priority Review {{must be made}} by <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> <b>company.</b> It {{does not affect the}} length of the {{clinical}} trial period. FDA determines within 45 days of <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> <b>company’s</b> request whether a priority or standard review designation will be assigned. Designation of a drug as “priority” does not alter the scientific/medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary. Safety requirements for a priority review are equal to that of a standard review.|$|R

2500|$|Critics have {{disputed the}} claim that the Prescription Drug User Fee Amendment has {{improved}} the speed of drug approvals. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act allows the FDA to augment its budget by charging fees to pharmaceutical firms. [...] Over $800 million was collected from 1993 to 2001 and rising each year. [...] It also has been shown that oftentimes, the FDA expert advisory panels had direct financial interests in the drugs or products being evaluated. [...] Former Editor of The New England Journal of Medicine, Marcia Angell, [...] has stated that [...] "It's time to take the Food and Drug Administration back from <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> <b>companies....</b> In effect, the user fee act put the FDA on the payroll of the industry it regulates. Last year, the fees came to about $300 million, which the companies recoup many times over by getting their drugs to market faster." ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{has also}} been alleged that the way the {{categories}} of the DSM are structured, {{as well as the}} substantial expansion of the number of categories, are representative of an increasing medicalization of human nature, which may be attributed to disease mongering by psychiatrists and pharmaceutical companies, the power and influence of the latter having grown dramatically in recent decades. Of the authors who selected and defined the DSM-IV psychiatric disorders, roughly half have had financial relationships with the pharmaceutical industry at one time, raising the prospect of a direct conflict of interest. The same article concludes that the connections between panel members and <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> <b>companies</b> were particularly strong in those diagnoses where drugs are the first line of treatment, such as schizophrenia and mood disorders, where 100% of the panel members had financial ties with the pharmaceutical industry.

2500|$|The FDA {{has been}} criticized by advocates for the {{supplement}} industry for prohibiting dietary supplement manufacturers from making research supported claims of effectiveness on the labels of their products. Manufacturers of supplements, which are considered foods for regulatory purposes, are allowed to make only limited [...] "structure/function claims" [...] and are prohibited from claiming that the supplement can prevent, cure, or mitigate a disease or condition {{regardless of whether or}} not the supplement undergoes actual testing of its safety and efficacy. Ron Paul (R-TX) opined: [...] "But the FDA and <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> <b>companies</b> are in bed together and they squeeze out competitions and build up their monopolies and they love government medicine because they make more money." [...] Ron Paul also introduced a bill on November 10, 2005 titled the [...] "Health Freedom Protection Act" [...] (H.R. 4282), which proposed to stop [...] "the FDA from censoring truthful claims about the curative, mitigative, or preventative effects of dietary supplements, and adopts the federal court’s suggested use of disclaimers as an alternative to censorship." ...|$|E
2500|$|Paul proposes sharply {{reducing}} the government's regulation of medications and health supplements by {{reducing the}} role of, and ultimately eliminating, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In a 2011 interview, Paul said, [...] "Well, the FDA just serves <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> <b>companies...</b> they also prevent drugs from coming on the market [...] 10, 15 years later than other countries have it. So, yes, government just {{gets in the way}} on so many of those things." [...] He favors allowing FDA-approved prescription drugs to be imported from foreign countries and sold at a lower cost than the same drugs otherwise sell for in the US – thereby allowing international markets to set drug prices in the US market – a practice that has been prohibited by the FDA. In the interest, as he sees it, of fighting for greater freedom of choice for consumers, he has also introduced bills that would significantly reduce the government's ability to prevent manufacturers or sellers of dietary supplements and certain other health products from making what government regulators believe to be false or misleading claims about the health effects of the products. He essentially feels that consumers should be able to buy whatever health aids they want from whomever they want, without the need for guidance by the government.|$|E
