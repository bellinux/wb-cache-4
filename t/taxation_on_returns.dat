40|$|In recent years, some European {{countries}} {{have relied on}} elements of an allow-ance for corporate equity (ACE) {{in the design of}} their tax systems. We analyse the effects of ACE-based <b>taxation</b> <b>on</b> rates of <b>return</b> and effective tax rates. In-vestment neutrality is lost if the imputed interest rate deviates from the market interest rate. With increasing profitability, the relative importance of the ACE compared with the statutory tax rate decreases. This might induce disadvantages for countries that compete for profitable, multinational companies. Revenue ef-fects indicate that tax rates under an ACE-based tax system should not exceed those in competing countries by much.

5000|$|St Neots parish {{church was}} rebuilt in the 15th century, {{as was the}} church at Eaton Socon. This last revival of gothic architecture, which left almost nothing of the {{previous}} church, {{was made possible by}} Edward IV's policy of reducing <b>taxation</b> <b>on</b> his <b>returns</b> from exile in Flanders in 1471. It resulted in the town having a uniformly Perpendicular building with a prominent 130 ft tower, built in the Somerset style, which is still visible from miles around. Like many churches of the period it was supported by a local gild, which had a chapel within the building and because of its size and grandeur, it became known as [...] "the cathedral of Huntingdonshire". Eynesbury church had already been rebuilt in the 13th century. All three suffered from the depredations of government legislation when their interiors were shorn of their stone altars, rood screens and statuary as part of the Reformation agenda. Eaton Socon church suffered a severe fire in the 1930s and was rebuilt in the same style.|$|R

40|$|The {{impact of}} <b>taxation</b> <b>on</b> total <b>return</b> <b>on</b> shares and share price {{behavior}} around ex-dividend day {{is an ongoing}} problem {{in the field of}} Corporate Finance. Several groups of theoretical approaches have evolved since 1950 s. Proponents of tax impact argue that share prices decline around ex-dividend day. The extent of decline is also a subject of academic discussions. Moreover, they also claim that shares with higher dividend yield must amount to higher total <b>return</b> <b>on</b> shares before tax {{in order to keep the}} total <b>return</b> <b>on</b> shares after tax equal for all kinds of shares. On the contrary, proponents of signalling effect insist on rising share prices around ex-dividend day. This dissertation is mainly aimed at empirical evaluation of the most significant findings mentioned above; based on tests of statistical hypothesis and regression and correlation analysis. The empirical study uses relevant data of German Stock Exchange in Frankfurt upon Main from 2001 till 2009. Additionally, the changes in taxation of dividends and capital gains in 2001 and 2008 are thoroughly explained and analysed with regard to <b>return</b> <b>on</b> shares and share price behavior. The dissertation is divided into 3 main parts including an analysis of current findings, explanation of main elements of tax reforms in 2001 and 2009 and, finally, an empirical analysis. The analysis of current findings includes a review of significant research on share price behavior around ex-dividend day, signalling effect and relationship between dividend yield and total <b>return</b> <b>on</b> shares before and after tax. Moreover, the verified hypotheses in this dissertation were deduced from revailing conclusions of the review. The explanation of main elements of tax reforms in 2001 and 2008 is focused on description of changes in taxation of dividends and capital gains. In 2001, the full imputation method eliminating double axation of dividends was removed and replaced by half-income method taxing only a half of dividend. In 2008, the half-income method was replaced by withholding tax; under defined circumstances by the 60 %-income method taxing 60 % of dividends. In an empirical analysis, the hypothesis about decline of share price around ex-dividend day and the hypothesis about decline of share price equal to dividend after tax were tested. Additionally, existence of positive relationship between total <b>return</b> <b>on</b> shares before tax and dividend yield and existence of no significant relationship between total <b>return</b> <b>on</b> shares after tax and dividend yield were verified. The decline of share prices was proved in every year. The existence of positive relationship between total <b>return</b> <b>on</b> shares before tax and dividend yield was confirmed in every year except 2006 and 2008...|$|R
40|$|The highest {{priority}} over <b>taxation</b> <b>on</b> personal trusts {{is to establish}} a distinction between revocable trusts and irrevocable trusts. A beneficiary at the time of creating a trust, however, is not necessarily the beneficiary even in the future. In this regard, it is possible to make good use of personal trusts in Japan, and prevent tax evasion. It seems appropriate that the tax on a trust estate at the time of creating the trust should be borne by the trust or entity by itself, otherwise on the settler by himself. In addition, the beneficiaries should be taxed because they actually obtain the benefit. Most of the relationships between the settler and beneficiary in a personal trust agreement are family relationships. What is more, most <b>taxation</b> <b>on</b> trust beneficiaries and on trusts without beneficiaries is supposed to be regarded as personal trusts settled for personal property management. Thus we should not include <b>taxation</b> <b>on</b> trusts without beneficiaries among <b>taxation</b> <b>on</b> corporation trusts, and unify it among taxation of the beneficiaries of trusts. That is to say, there should be a division between <b>taxation</b> <b>on</b> trusts with beneficiaries and <b>taxation</b> <b>on</b> trusts without beneficiaries...|$|R
