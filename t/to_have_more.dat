5|$|A son, Geoffrey Bruce Oliphant, {{was born}} 6 October 1930, but {{he died of}} {{meningitis}} on 5 September 1933, and was interred in an unmarked grave in the Ascension Parish Burial Ground in Cambridge alongside Timothy Cockcroft, the infant son of Sir John and Lady Elizabeth Cockcroft, who had died the year before. Unable <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> children, the Oliphants adopted a four-month-old boy, Michael John, in 1936, and a daughter, Vivian, in 1938.|$|E
5|$|BSkyB's {{continued}} {{partnership with}} the Premier League {{has led to an}} increase in the value of broadcasting rights and matches televised. Managers however have voiced their concerns about the latter and the excessive cost of live rights is partly a reason why top-flight football has not returned to the BBC or ITV. In 2005 BSkyB's monopoly on live rights ended after the European Commission ruled that the Premier League needed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> than one holder.|$|E

5|$|Frigatebirds are unusual among seabirds in {{that they}} often carry blood parasites. Blood-borne {{protozoa}} of the genus Haemoproteus have been recovered from {{four of the five}} species. Bird lice of the ischnoceran genus Pectinopygus and amblyceran genus Colpocephalum and species Fregatiella aurifasciata have been recovered from magnificent and great frigatebirds of the Galapagos Islands. Frigatebirds tended <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> parasitic lice than did boobies analysed in the same study.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the pelvis}} {{is not always}} present, so {{forensic}} anthropologists {{must be aware of}} other areas on the skeleton that have distinct characteristics between sexes. The skull also contains multiple markers {{that can be used to}} determine sex. Specific markers on the skull include the temporal line, the eye sockets, the supraorbital ridge, as well as the nuchal lines, and the mastoid process. In general, male skulls tend to be larger and thicker than female skulls, and <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> pronounced ridges.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{intended}} to be a spin-off featuring a different protagonist, Resident Evil 3 was designed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> action-oriented gameplay than previous Resident Evil games. It features a larger number of enemies for the player to defeat and introduces the eponymous Nemesis creature, which periodically pursues the player from one area to the next {{until the end of the}} game. The game uses the same engine as its predecessors and features 3D models over pre-rendered backgrounds with fixed camera angles.|$|E

5|$|The film {{contains}} no dialogue {{for the first}} and last 20 minutes or so.

5|$|The {{spacecraft}} verified {{the existence}} of a magnetic field surrounding the planet and discovered that the field was offset from the centre and tilted {{in a manner similar to}} the field around Uranus. Neptune's rotation period was determined using measurements of radio emissions and Voyager 2 also showed that Neptune had a surprisingly active weather system. Six new moons were discovered, and the planet was shown <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> than one ring.|$|E
5|$|Visual {{differentiation}} {{from the}} fish crow (C. ossifragus) {{is extremely difficult}} and often inaccurate. Nonetheless, differences apart from size do exist. Fish crows tend <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> slender bills and feet. There {{may also be a}} small sharp hook {{at the end of the}} upper bill. Fish crows also appear as if they have shorter legs when walking. More dramatically, when calling, fish crows tend to hunch and fluff their throat feathers.|$|E
5|$|Abnormalities in the ARH gene, {{also known}} as LDLRAP1, were first {{reported}} in a family in 1973. In contrast to the other causes, two abnormal copies of the gene are required for FH to develop (autosomal recessive). The mutations in the protein tend to cause {{the production of a}} shortened protein. Its real function is unclear, but it seems {{to play a role in}} the relation between the LDL receptor and clathrin-coated pits. People with autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia tend <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> severe disease than LDLR-heterozygotes but less severe than LDLR-homozygotes.|$|E

5|$|All five {{songs on}} the {{extended}} play (EP) were written and produced by Chana and Chan. The pair worked on Manos Arriba for roughly two years and recorded it in Chan's recording studio in the garage of his home in Echo Park, Los Angeles. They initially created the material {{as a way to}} secure a record deal, but later decided to release it independently. Chana later said that the decision allowed her <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> creative input on her music and image. They completed eighteen tracks and chose five for the EP.|$|E
5|$|Another {{difference}} between older and newer studies {{is that the}} type of patients treated with the ketogenic diet has changed over time. When first developed and used, the ketogenic diet was not a treatment of last resort; in contrast, the children in modern studies have already tried and failed a number of anticonvulsant drugs, so may be assumed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> difficult-to-treat epilepsy. Early and modern studies also differ because the treatment protocol has changed. In older protocols, the diet was initiated with a prolonged fast, designed to lose 5–10% body weight, and heavily restricted the calorie intake. Concerns over child health and growth led to a relaxation of the diet's restrictions. Fluid restriction was once a feature of the diet, but this led to increased risk of constipation and kidney stones, and is no longer considered beneficial.|$|E
5|$|As with Georgia, Virginia Tech's {{kicking and}} special teams proved <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> success than either {{aspect of the}} offense. Virginia Tech kicker Brandon Pace scored a single 28-yard field goal late in the fourth quarter, and punter Nic Schmitt blasted four punts {{for a total of}} 195yards, {{averaging}} 48.8yards a punt. Pace's field goal helped to trigger a late-game rally by Virginia Tech, which had been stunned by a Georgia onside kick and several interceptions thrown by Glennon. Schmitt's long punts, meanwhile, denied Georgia good field position {{in the first half of}} the game. Only in the second half, when Glennon's interceptions allowed Georgia to start on the Tech side of the field, was the Georgia offense able to reach the end zone. In the first and second quarters, Georgia's average starting position was their own 19-yard line and own 26-yard line, respectively.|$|E
50|$|Huston {{started his}} film career {{with a small}} screen {{adaptation}} of Spartacus, where he played Flavius.

50|$|Modesty doesn't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> {{be related}} <b>to</b> <b>having</b> <b>more</b> clothes {{especially}} in the case of natives tribes. Some feel exposed when seen in certain clothes even though normal attire is much <b>more</b> revealing. <b>Having</b> ear or lip stoppers is seen as modest with the opposite being true as well.|$|R
5|$|Details of {{the fruit}} bodies' appearance, color in particular, are {{somewhat}} variable and dependent on growing conditions. For example, specimens growing on logs in oak and hickory forests in the spring tend <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> yellowish-white, depressed caps than {{those found in the}} same location in autumn, which are light yellow brown and more convex in shape. The fruit body development of M.rotula is hemiangiocarpous, with an hymenium that is only partially enclosed by basidiocarp tissues. Robert Kühner showed that a -like tissue covers the young gills before the expanding cap breaks away from the stem. In unfavorable weather conditions, however, the mushrooms may fail to develop normally and instead produce semi-gasteroid basidiocarps.|$|E
5|$|Docter {{recruited}} a story crew to {{help develop}} the film's plot line. Although animation as an industry had been dominated by men, half of the story crew were women, in an attempt <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> diverse input. The choice to focus the film on a girl came from research that claimed that females age 11 to 17 are more attuned to expressions and emotions than others. The idea to have Riley play hockey came from Del Carmen, who observed that the sport is very popular in Minnesota. They tried to stray away from stereotypically feminine interests, such as the color pink or dresses. Initial ideas for the film found the main character, Riley, falling into a deep depression: Docter later felt they were inappropriate and scrapped them, although in the final film Riley does sink into a depression.|$|E
5|$|Doom 3 {{was also}} {{intended}} to be more storyline focused than previous id titles, as was demonstrated by the developers' conscious effort <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> professional voice acting. Late in 2002, two employees at ATI Technologies leaked a development version of Doom 3 onto the Internet. One year later, a new trailer was shown at E3 2003 and soon afterwards id Software's website was updated to showcase Doom 3 as an upcoming project, although it was also announced that Doom 3 would not {{be ready for the}} 2003 holiday season. According to John Carmack, the development took longer than expected.|$|E
