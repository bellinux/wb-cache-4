5000|$|During {{the time}} of the Qin (221-206 BC) and Han Dynasties (206 BC-220 AD) kuai made from the meat of land fauna became less popular with the term used to refer more and more to <b>thinly</b> <b>slice</b> raw fish. The dish was widely {{consumed}} by all classes and coincides with the appearance of the character [...] "鱠" [...] (kuai) with its fish radical (魚) during this period (alongside the character 膾 with the [...] "" [...] meat radical). In addition, characters such as [...] "燴" [...] (kuai) with the fire radical were introduced to indicate fish that has grilled to the rare stage and then thinly sliced, similar to Japanese Tataki. Indeed, kuai and raw fish were so commonly consumed that Ying Shao(應劭) in his Fengsu TongYi (風俗通義), a manuscript that described the odd and exotic practices of various cultures and peoples, stated that [...] "In Zhu-A, raw fish is not consumed" [...] (祝、阿不食生魚, chap. 釋忌), alluding to the perceived oddity of not eating fish raw. It is also during this period that the renowned dish jinji yukuai (金齏玉膾) along its accompanying baheji sauce (八和齏) was created (齊民要術 Qi Min Yao Shu, scroll 8).|$|E
