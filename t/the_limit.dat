40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{two prominent}} institutional {{rules in the}} international trading system: a lim- ited cross-retaliation rule characterized by the Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes (DSU) Article 22. 3 and a limited punishment rule characterized by the General Agreement on Taris and Trade (GATT) Article XXVIII. In general, both rules are designed to <b>limit</b> <b>the</b> countermeasures upon a violation; however, the former rule species <b>the</b> <b>limits</b> of composition in retaliation, whereas the latter one designates <b>the</b> <b>limits</b> of retaliation magnitude. We show that, albeit seemingly unrelated, <b>the</b> <b>limited</b> cross-retaliation rule complements <b>the</b> <b>limited</b> punishment rule in per- mitting greater trade liberalization. Specically, we show how <b>the</b> <b>limited</b> cross-retaliation rule also helps <b>limit</b> <b>the</b> incentives to violate the trade agreement when <b>the</b> <b>limited</b> punishment rule prevails. ...|$|R

5|$|One {{can form}} a 2-satisfiability {{instance}} at random, {{for a given}} number n of variables and m of clauses, by choosing each clause uniformly at random from the set of all possible two-variable clauses. When m is small relative to n, such an instance will likely be satisfiable, but larger values of m have smaller probabilities of being satisfiable. More precisely, if m/n is fixed as a constant α ≠ 1, the probability of satisfiability tends to a limit as n goes to infinity: if α<1, <b>the</b> <b>limit</b> is one, while if α>1, <b>the</b> <b>limit</b> is zero.

40|$|Multi–constrained Quality of Service (QoS) routing finds a {{route in}} the network that {{satisfies}} multiple independent quality of service constraints. This problem is NP–hard {{and a number of}} heuristic algorithms have been proposed to solve the problem. This paper studies two heuristics, <b>the</b> <b>limited</b> granularity heuristic and <b>the</b> <b>limited</b> path heuristic, for solving general –constrained problems. Analytical and simulation studies are conducted to compare the time/space requirements of the heuristics and the effectiveness of the heuristics in finding the paths that satisfy the QoS constraints. We prove analytically that for an nodes and edges network with (a small constant) independent QoS constraints, <b>the</b> <b>limited</b> granularity heuristic must maintain a table of size in each node to be effective, which results in a time complexity of. We also prove that <b>the</b> <b>limited</b> path heuristic can achieve very high performance by maintaining entries in each node, which indicates that the performance of <b>the</b> <b>limited</b> path heuristic is not sensitive to the number of constraints. We conclude that although both <b>the</b> <b>limited</b> granularity heuristic and <b>the</b> <b>limited</b> path heuristic can efficiently solve –constrained QoS routing problems, <b>the</b> <b>limited</b> path heuristic is superior to <b>the</b> <b>limited</b> granularity heuristic in solving –constrained QoS routing problems "!$ # when.
