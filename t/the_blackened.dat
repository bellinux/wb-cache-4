His American co-driver, Sergio Cresto, also died when the Lancia plunged down a ravine and exploded. The fatal crash had no close {{witnesses}} and the only remains of the car were <b>the</b> <b>blackened</b> spaceframe, {{making it impossible to}} determine the cause of the crash. Within hours of the crash, Jean-Marie Balestre, then President of the FISA, had banned the powerful Group B rally cars from competing the following season, ending rallying's popular supercar era.|$|E
25|$|The {{temple of}} Edfu fell into disuse as a {{religious}} monument following Theodosius I's edict banning non-Christian worship within the Roman Empire in 391. As elsewhere, many of the temple's carved reliefs were razed by followers of the Christian faith which came to dominate Egypt. <b>The</b> <b>blackened</b> ceiling of the hypostyle hall, visible today, {{is believed to be}} the result of arson intended to destroy religious imagery that was then considered pagan.|$|E

25|$|As the {{men were}} {{returning}} to the vehicle, the signal was given for the arrest. An 18-wheel New York City Police Department vehicle blocked {{the end of the}} street. The FBI informer also served as the driver of the suspects' vehicle. Another armored vehicle arrived, and officers from the department's Emergency Service Unit smashed <b>the</b> <b>blackened</b> windows of the S.U.V., removed the men from the vehicle, and handcuffed them on the ground. None offered resistance.|$|E
25|$|The hall {{they built}} used modernism’s {{favourite}} material, reinforced concrete, alongside more luxurious elements including beautiful woods and Derbyshire fossilised limestone. The {{exterior of the}} building was bright white, intended to contrast with <b>the</b> <b>blackened</b> city surrounding it. Large areas of glass on its façade meant that light coursed freely throughout the interior, and at night, the glass let the light from inside flood out onto the river, {{in contrast to the}} darkness which befell the rest of London after dusk.|$|E
25|$|A {{man named}} Sabbath, an {{eighteenth-century}} secret agent gifted with time travel abilities, excised <b>the</b> <b>blackened</b> organ, both saving the Doctor's life and robbing the Doctor {{of some of}} his higher Time Lord abilities (his respiratory bypass system and his ability to metabolise toxins). It transpired that Sabbath was actually after the heart for his own purposes: when implanted into Sabbath's own chest, it imparted upon him those same Time Lord powers. An unexpected side effect of this experiment was that so long as the Doctor's heart remained within Sabbath's chest, the Doctor himself remained practically invulnerable to harm (though any injury sustained by the Doctor would weaken Sabbath).|$|E
500|$|Three {{years after}} the release of <b>The</b> <b>Blackening,</b> Machine Head wrapped their touring cycle for the album, {{finishing}} in Sydney, Australia on 28 March.

On October 8, 2011, the album was voted Roadrunner Records [...] "Album of the Century" [...] in a poll.|$|R
50|$|It {{soon became}} clear that <b>the</b> <b>blackening</b> of <b>the</b> plate {{had nothing to do with}} phosphorescence, as <b>the</b> <b>blackening</b> was also {{produced}} by non-phosphorescent salts of uranium and metallic uranium.

500|$|An {{aerial survey}} of the crash site {{immediately}} afterwards showed only six engines, a tire and small items of debris on <b>the</b> <b>blackened</b> surface of the ice. The accident was designated a [...] "Broken Arrow"—a United States military term that describes an accident involving a nuclear weapon but which does not present a risk of war.|$|E
500|$|The USAF {{worked with}} Danish nuclear {{scientists}} {{to consider the}} clean-up options. The spilled fuel in <b>the</b> <b>blackened</b> area carried the weapons material very well, raising concerns that when the ice melted in the summer, the radioactive fuel would float on the sea and subsequently contaminate the shore—the Danes thus insisted on the removal of <b>the</b> <b>blackened</b> area to avoid this possibility. [...] The Danes also requested that the nuclear material not be left in Greenland after the cleanup operation was complete, therefore requiring General Hunziker to remove the contaminated ice and wreckage to the United States for disposal. USAF personnel used graders to collect the contaminated snow and ice, which was loaded into wooden boxes at the crash site. The boxes were moved to a holding area near Thule Air Base known as the [...] "Tank Farm". There, contaminated material was loaded into steel tanks prior to being loaded onto ships. Debris from the weapons {{was sent to the}} Pantex plant in Texas for evaluation, and the tanks were shipped to Savannah River in South Carolina. [...] According to General Hunziker, 93 percent of the contaminated material was removed from the accident site.|$|E
500|$|Because of its {{occurrence}} on {{the fruit}} bodies of other agarics, V.surrecta {{is unlikely to}} be confused with other mushrooms. Other parasitic mushrooms include Asterophora species, but these have thick gills compared to the thin gills of V.surrecta. Collybia species, including C.cookei, C.cirrhata and C.tuberosa are saprobic, and grow on <b>the</b> <b>blackened,</b> decayed remains of other agarics.

[...] In February, it was reported that Israel would officially ask the Palestinian Authority to carry out repairs at the tomb, but in response, vandals set tires on fire inside the tomb.

500|$|Herriman {{was born}} to mixed-race parents, and his birth {{certificate}} lists Herriman as [...] "colored". [...] In the post- Plessy v. Ferguson U.S., in which [...] "separate but equal" [...] racial segregation was enshrined, people of mixed race had to choose to identify themselves as either black or white. [...] Herriman seems to have identified himself as white. According to comics academic Jeet Heer, his early work is [...] "replete with black caricatures", such as Musical Mose, in which the lead character, an African-American musician, wishes his [...] "color would fade". [...] Racial ambivalence crept into Krazy Kat, such as on two occasions where Krazy's black fur was dyed white. [...] Ignatz {{falls in love with}} the whitened Krazy, only to return to hatred and brick-throwing when the truth is revealed. [...] Similarly, in an oft-repeated joke, Ignatz would accidentally become covered with coal dust and would be spurned by the normally love-struck Krazy. [...] In one such episode, a brick thrown by <b>the</b> <b>blackened</b> Ignatz hits Krazy, who declares, [...] "A lil Eetiopium Mice, black like a month from midnights. [...] Fuwi!" [...] Once Ignatz reverts to his white self, Krazy loves him again.|$|E
500|$|On {{the same}} day that Crawford was executed, at least six American prisoners were taken in two {{different}} groups to the Shawnee town of Wapatomica on the Mad River, in present Logan County, Ohio. These prisoners included Major John B. McClelland, who had been fourth in command of the expedition, as well as William Harrison (Crawford's son-in-law) and Private William Crawford (Colonel Crawford's nephew). Four of the six, including McClelland, Harrison, and Crawford, were painted black. The villagers, made aware of the coming of prisoners by a messenger, formed two lines. The prisoners were made to run the gauntlet towards the council house, about [...] distance. As the prisoners ran by, the villagers beat them with clubs, concentrating on those who had been painted black. <b>The</b> <b>blackened</b> prisoners were then hacked to death with tomahawks and cut into pieces. Their heads and limbs were stuck on poles outside the town. One of the prisoners, a scout named John Slover, was taken to Mac-a-chack (near present West Liberty, Ohio), but escaped before he could be burnt. Still naked, he stole a horse and rode it until it gave out, then ran on foot, reaching Fort Pitt on July 10, one of the last survivors to return.|$|E

500|$|Drosera regia {{plants are}} fairly large herbs that produce {{horizontal}} woody rhizomes and {{a crown of}} large, linear leaves up to [...] long and [...] wide. The leaves possess stalked glands (tentacles) on the upper surface of the lamina along nearly {{the entire length of}} the leaf. The leaves lack petioles and stipules, emerging by circinate vernation (uncurling) and tapering to a filiform point. The tentacles and the leaf itself are capable of responding to prey by bending toward insects trapped in the sticky mucilage produced by the glands. Leaves are even capable of folding over themselves several times. Each leaf can possess thousands of tentacles, which can aid in the retention of larger prey when combined with the leaf wrapping tightly around captured insects. In its native habitat, D.regia has been known to capture large beetles, moths and butterflies. Plants go dormant during the colder season and form a dormant bud, consisting of a tight cluster of short, immature leaves. Plants begin to break dormancy in mid-July with a typical growing season lasting from October to April, though this is variable and plants can continue growing year-round without dormancy. Individual leaves die back but remain attached to the short stem, clothing the bottom portion of the plant in <b>the</b> <b>blackened</b> dead leaves of former years.|$|E
500|$|That {{afternoon}} over 1,500 Bogside residents built barricades, armed {{themselves with}} steel bars, wooden clubs and hurleys, {{and told the}} police {{that they would not}} be allowed into the area. DCAC chairman John Hume told a meeting of residents that they were to defend the area and no-one was to come in. [...] Groups of men wearing armbands patrolled the streets in shifts. [...] A local activist painted [...] "You are now entering Free Derry" [...] in light-coloured paint on <b>the</b> <b>blackened</b> gable wall of a house on the corner of Lecky Road and Fahan Street. For many years, it was believed that it was John 'Caker' Casey that painted it, but after Casey's death it emerged that it might have been another young activist, Liam Hillen. The corner where the slogan was painted, which was a popular venue for meetings, later became known as [...] "Free Derry Corner". On 7 January, the barricaded area was extended to include the Creggan, another nationalist area on a hill overlooking the Bogside. [...] A clandestine radio station calling itself [...] "Radio Free Derry" [...] began broadcasting to residents, playing rebel songs and encouraging resistance. [...] On a small number of occasions law-breakers attempted crimes, but were dealt with by the patrols. Despite all this, the Irish Times reported that [...] "the infrastructure of revolutionary control in the area has not been developed beyond the maintenance of patrols." [...] Following some acts of destruction and of violence late in the week, members of the DCAC including Ivan Cooper addressed residents on Friday, 10 January and called on them to dismantle the barricades. The barricades were taken down the following morning.|$|E

40|$|The {{ability of}} streptomycetes to produce {{hydrogen}} sulfide is generally used for taxonomic purposes. It {{was found that}} the previously used method, <b>the</b> <b>blackening</b> of Peptone Iron Agar, does not clearly indicate formation of hydrogen sulfide. It was shown that <b>the</b> <b>blackening</b> of a lead acetate strip is the most accurate indicator for H 2 S-producing streptomycetes. A great variety of organic and inorganic sulfur compounds were examined and compared, and the choice of the most suitable sulfur source and method for the detection of hydrogen sulfide is discussed...|$|R

2500|$|During {{the early}} decades of the Industrial Revolution in England, the {{countryside}} between London and Manchester became blanketed with soot from the new coal-burning factories. Many of the light-bodied lichens died from sulphur dioxide emissions, and the trees became darkened. This led to an increase in bird predation for light-coloured moths, as they no longer blended in as well in their polluted ecosystem: indeed, their bodies now dramatically contrasted with the colour of the bark. Dark-coloured moths, on the other hand, were camouflaged very well by <b>the</b> <b>blackened</b> trees. The population of dark-coloured moth rapidly increased. By the mid-19th century, the number of dark-coloured moths had risen noticeably, and by 1895, the percentage of dark-coloured moths in Manchester was reported at 98%, a dramatic change (of almost 100%) from the original frequency. This effect of industrialization in body colour led to the coining of the term [...] "industrial melanism".|$|E
2500|$|Fires {{continued}} {{to break out}} in Alexandria {{over the next few}} days and the city was chaotic and lawless which permitted Bedouins, among others, to loot the city. British sailors and marines landed and attempted to take control of <b>the</b> <b>blackened</b> ruins of the city and prevent the looting, while propping up the Khedive's shaky government. Eventually order was restored and a month later, General Garnet Wolseley landed a large force of British troops in Alexandria as a staging location for attacking ‘Urabi near the Suez Canal at the Battle of Tell El Kebir. Photographer [...] created an album of fifty pages showing the changes in Alexandria from start to finish of this attack.

This digital library was established in the fall of 2011 and the photographs of the Bombardment of Alexandria were compiled between June and August 2012.|$|E
2500|$|The Susquehannock (an Algonquian name meaning [...] "people of {{the muddy}} river" [...] {{adopted by the}} English of Maryland and Virginia) were known {{by a variety of}} ethnonyms such as the Andastes by the French (adapted from the Huron name Andastoerrhonon, meaning [...] "people of <b>the</b> <b>blackened</b> ridge pole,) the Minquas by the Dutch and Swedes (adapted from the Lenape name for their {{traditional}} enemy, which meant [...] "treacherous"), and the Conestogas by the English of Pennsylvania (adapted from Kanastoge or [...] "place of the immersed pole", the name of a Susquehanna village in Pennsylvania), although their Iroquoian autonym is unknown. The Susquehannock were separated into two groups known as the White Minquas and the Black Minquas. The White Minquas were located in villages along the Susquehanna River and its tributaries from Pennsylvania to southern New York. The Black Minqua were located in the West Virginia (Grant, Hampshire and Hardy counties) and Maryland (Allegany County) areas that share the Potomac River as a border. They may {{have been part of the}} Erie people, and were bitter enemies of the Iroquois Confederacy for control of the fur trade like their Erie and Huron allies.
