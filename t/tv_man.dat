5000|$|Director and Screenwriter of this film; Nishikawa, {{with the}} help of {{distribution}} companies: Bandai Visual, Eisei Gekijo, Engine Film and <b>TV</b> <b>Man</b> Union, presents her second feature film. Sway is representative of Nishikawa's likeness of the pre-straight-to-video salad days of Japanese Cinema. The Japanese film, which stars Odagiri Jo and opened on only six screens in South Korea in August 2006, set the record for an [...] "independent" [...] movie by pulling 300,000 admissions in only fifteen days. Playboy Photographer Yakeru Hayakawa reluctantly returns to his family's rural home for his mother's funeral. Barely anything has changed; he is still the spoiled brat, the father is still a bully, the pushover brother Minoru is still working at the gas station and Hayakawa's Ex, Chieko, is still available. The short-lived reunion sparks the affection of the brothers creating a romantic rivalry. Visiting their childhood romping ground of Hasumi Gorge, the tension gives way to confrontation on an old rickety rope bridge. Chieko favours the glitzy Hayakawa over Minoru, who pleads with her to reconsider. Chieko falters in her footing, not in her resolve. It is unclear if Chieko fell to her death or if she was pushed. In the following court case, the innocence and character of each brother stands trial leaving only one behind bars.|$|E
