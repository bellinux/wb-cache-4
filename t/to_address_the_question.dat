The pseudoscience of phrenology attempted to localise personality attributes to regions of the cortex in the 19th century. In science fiction, brain transplants are imagined in tales such as the 1942 Donovan's Brain.|$|E

The question was brought to a vote but failed and Chana students continued to go to Oregon schools after eighth grade.|$|E
5|$|Three {{days before}} {{the signing of the}} 1890 act, Barber wrote to the {{superintendent}} of the Philadelphia Mint, Oliver Bosbyshell, setting forth proposed terms of a competition to select new coin designs. Barber suggested that entrants be required to submit models, as opposed to drawings, and that the designs be in low relief, which was used for coins. He proposed that the entries include the lettering and denomination, as submissions without them would not adequately show the appearance of the finished coin. He received a reply that due to other work, the Mint would not be able <b>to</b> <b>address</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> until the spring of 1891.|$|E

25|$|After carbon, {{nitrogen}} {{is arguably}} the most important element needed for life. Thus, measurements of nitrate over the range of 0.1% to 5% are required <b>to</b> <b>address</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> of its occurrence and distribution. There is nitrogen (as N2) in the atmosphere at low levels, but this is not adequate to support nitrogen fixation for biological incorporation. Nitrogen in the form of nitrate could be a resource for human exploration both as a nutrient for plant growth and for use in chemical processes. On Earth, nitrates correlate with perchlorates in desert environments, and this may also be true on Mars. Nitrate is expected to be stable on Mars and to have formed by thermal shock from impact or volcanic plume lightning on ancient Mars.|$|E
25|$|<b>To</b> <b>address</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> {{whether the}} {{initiative}} proponents had particularized standing (that is, standing either via personal interest, or standing {{to represent the}} State's interest), the Ninth Circuit certified a question to the California Supreme Court on January 4, 2011, asking that court to rule whether, under the California Constitution or otherwise under California law, non-governmental proponents of an initiative have standing to appeal when the State is no longer willing to defend it. On February 16, 2011, the California Supreme Court unanimously agreed to address the Ninth Circuit's request. The court set an expedited schedule for the hearing and heard oral arguments on September 6, 2011. On November 17, 2011, the California Supreme Court issued an advisory opinion that the proponents of Proposition 8 did have standing, and could defend it.|$|E

25|$|The court later decided <b>to</b> <b>address</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> of {{copyright}} infringement. According to German law, only copying {{of the source}} code would constitute copyright infringement. But that there are similarities in the design, structure and function of the two networks could equally derive from a conscious imitation of the other website without directly accessing and copying of the source code of Facebook. The reference to Facebook's web appearance could have simply happened by using the publicly available HTML texts and stylesheets when programming StudiVZ. Even if the programmer of StudiVZ was given the concrete task to create a website {{in the style of}} Facebook, this does not constitute copyright infringement according to German Copyright law, see §69a German Copyright Act Mere similarities between the two websites are not enough to demonstrate with sufficient probability a copying of the source code.|$|E

The emperor arrived in Venice in February 1438 where he was met by Niccolò III d'Este, Marquis of Ferrara. Niccolò, with his sons Leonello and Borso, accompanied the emperor as they rode into Ferrara on the 4 March. Following its first magnificent opening public session on 9 April 1438, the Council was repeatedly postponed until the 8 October to allow the many different representatives of the European rulers to arrive.|$|E
25|$|Due to the Quebec Act of 1774, Michigan was governed {{during the}} Revolution {{as part of}} the Province of Quebec. Although the 1783 Treaty of Paris gave the fledgling United States a claim to what is now Michigan, British policy was to hold on to Detroit and its {{dependencies}} at all costs. In 1784, Baron von Steuben would be sent to Canada by the Congress of the Confederation in a diplomatic capacity <b>to</b> <b>address</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> of Detroit and the Great Lakes, but Frederick Haldimand, the Governor of Quebec, refused to provide a passport, and negotiations collapsed before they had begun.

The Center arranges fora for scholars, members of academe, and political and business leaders. Its lectures and fora focus on rule of law issues involving ethics and the legal profession, economic development and constitutional principles, judicial history, and legal theory. It also holds the collection of legal and private papers of Chief Justice Teehankee. The Center seeks to build on the collection through the contribution of leading lawyers and academicians as ably assisted by various research volunteers in fields such as the Rule of Law and Legal Theory, Constitutional Law, E-commerce, International Law, Development Law, and other legal issues.|$|E
