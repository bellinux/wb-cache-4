40|$|Through {{the work}} of {{researchers}} {{and the development of}} commercially available products, automated guidance has become a viable option for agricultural producers. Some of the limitations of commercially available technologies are that they only automate one function of the agricultural vehicle and that the systems are proprietary to a single machine model. The objective of this project was to evaluate a controller area network (CAN bus) as the basis of an automated guidance system. The prototype system utilized several microcontroller-driven nodes to act as control points along a system wide CAN bus. Messages were transferred to <b>the</b> <b>steering,</b> <b>transmission,</b> and hitch control nodes from a task computer. The task computer utilized global positioning system data to determine the appropriate control commands. Infield testing demonstrated that each of the control nodes could be controlled simultaneously over the CAN bus. Results showed that the task computer adequately applied a feedback control model to the system and achieved guidance accuracy levels well within the range sought. Testing also demonstrated the system’s ability t...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{order to}} satisfy the {{agricultural}} demond of rice transplanting, the transplanter work should guarantee the escapement even in straight line transplanting that is convenient for field management and harvest later. Because of variable soil conditions and hard work environment, the driver driving level and the long boring driving to follow line is a big influence {{to the accuracy of}} the rice transplant. It is easy to produce overline, leak line and cause losses in yield. Aimed at above problem, this text introduces an automatic navigation system developed on PZ 60 rice transplanter based on global navigation satellite system (GNSS). <b>The</b> <b>steering,</b> <b>transmission</b> and transplanting control system of the rice transplanter were modified from manual control system to electro-hydraulic control system using electro-hydraulic proportional valve. According to the position information of the rice transplanter acquired from GNSS receiver and vehicle sensors, the close-loop feedback control system of steering was builded. The system can accurately control rice transplanter to follow row navigating and turn around at the end of field by the self-adaptive fuzzy control method. The road and field experiment results indicated that the lateral tracking error could be kept within 100 mm when the speed of the rice transplant is not greater than 1. 0 m/s. The control system can satisfy the requirment of rice transplanting...|$|E
40|$|The main {{target of}} a {{steering}} system is that the driver can change vehicle trajectory {{in accordance with the}} desired direction.  Power steering has become a standard feature in automobile.   It provides assisting power when the driver turns the steering wheel. The well-known power steering types include; Hydraulic Power Steering (HPS), Electro - Hydraulic Power Steering (EHPS), and Electric Power Steering (EPS). EHPS or EPS uses an Electronic Control Unit (ECU) which is specific for each vehicle. The ECU should be able to regulate power of electric motor to provide corresponding assisting power for the steering wheel. Therefore ECU requires input signals, one of which is vehicle wheel angle that can be indicated from the vehicle steering wheel angle. Incremental type of Rotary Encoder (RE) is used in steering angle sensor on a minibus. RE specification used was 60 pulses per rotation and the minibus steering transmission specification is 3. 5 round of right wheel off angle to the left wheel off angle. So we get the RE angular resolution 6 ºper pulse and 105 number of pulses to half of <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>transmission</b> ratio. Repeatability then tested against to a steering angle counter module. Testing is done with a test cycle consisting of 3 repetitions: condition center of the steering wheel, the steering wheel is turned to full right, then to the full left, then back to the right up to the steering wheel center. The results obtained 2 pulses deviation, or equivalent to 12 º of steering angle. </p...|$|E
