5|$|Winter service {{vehicles}} are usually {{based on a}} dump <b>truck</b> <b>chassis,</b> which are then converted into winter {{service vehicles}} either by the manufacturer or an aftermarket third-party. A typical modification involves the replacement of steel components of the vehicle with corrosion resistant aluminium or fibreglass, waterproofing any exposed electronic components, replacement of the stock hopper with a specially designed gritting body, {{the addition of a}} plow frame, reinforcement of the wheels, bumpers to support the heavy blade, and the addition of extra headlamps, a light bar, and retroreflectors for visibility.|$|E
5|$|In the US, {{there are}} four types of ambulances. There are Type I, Type II, Type III and Type IV. Type I is based upon a heavy <b>truck</b> <b>chassis</b> and is used {{primarily}} for Advanced Life Support and rescue work. Type II is a van based ambulance with little modifications except for a raised roof. Its use is for basic life support and transfer of patients. The Type III is a van chassis but with a custom made rear compartment and has the same use as Type I ambulances. Type IV's are nomenclature for smaller ad hoc patient transfer using smaller utility vehicles where passenger vehicles and trucks would have difficulty in traversing, such as large industrial complexes, commercial venues, and special events with large crowds. These do not, generally, fall under Federal Regulations.|$|E

25|$|When {{they first}} {{appeared}} in the 1920s, colectivos were small buses built out of smaller vehicle chassis (cars, vans, etc.) and, later, out of <b>truck</b> <b>chassis</b> (19501990, by Mercedes-Benz Argentina), not specifically designed for the transportation of people, and were decorated with unique hand-painted drawings (fileteado) that gave each unit a distinct flavor.|$|E
25|$|Chevrolet started {{manufacturing}} a <b>truck</b> <b>chassis</b> {{adaptable to}} passenger transport. By the 1930s {{the size of}} the colectivo had increased from five to up to a dozen seats, and the Chevrolet line had become widely used, with bodies made by local companies. This style was kept until the 1970s and 1980s, by which time the units had twenty seats plus cramped room for many standing passengers.|$|E
25|$|The {{ambulances}} used by FDNY EMS {{are usually}} manufactured by Horton Ambulance, and the modules are generally mounted on Ford F-350 light <b>truck</b> <b>chassis.</b> When NYC EMS {{merged with the}} FDNY in 1996, the ambulances had their orange stripe replaced with a red, and they were manufactured by Wheeled Coach, again on Ford F-350 chassis. Some of the older ambulances were built by Southern Ambulance Builders and mounted on Chevrolet 3500 chassis.|$|E

25|$|The crane {{is driven}} by an {{operator}} who sits in a cabin suspended from the trolley. The trolley runs along rails located on the top or sides of the boom and girder. The operator runs the trolley over the ship to lift the cargo, usually containers. Once the spreader locks onto the container, the container is lifted, moved over the dock, and placed on a <b>truck</b> <b>chassis</b> (trailer) {{to be taken to}} the storage yard. The crane also lifts containers from chassis on the dock to load them onto the ship.|$|E
25|$|After 1994, the Mamba {{utilised}} a Unimog <b>truck</b> <b>chassis</b> {{for better}} off-road performance and ground clearance. The first units {{were derived from}} surplus Buffel vehicles. Its V-shaped hull is designed to deflect a mine blast away from the occupants. It {{is powered by a}} 352N Mercedes Benz 6-cylinder diesel engine. The Mamba entered service in 1995, and is still in use with the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) and several other countries. The SANDF now uses the Mamba Mk2 and Mamba Mk3 versions, with 600 Mk2s upgraded to Mk3 configuration.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} {{history for}} the OA vz. 30 {{is difficult to}} sort out, but the Czech Army had been evaluating various Tatra <b>truck</b> <b>chassis</b> for use as armored cars since 1926 {{with a number of}} prototypes built over the years with both wooden and metal bodies to test vehicle layouts. An order was finally placed on 6 March 1933 for fifty-one for delivery in December. Tatra was late and only delivered the first six on 29 January 1934 followed by sixteen more in February and the rest in July because their garages in Milovice were not yet complete.|$|E
50|$|After World War II {{civilian}} production resumed with 5-tonne {{and later}} 7-tonne trucks.In 1950, {{the company name}} became Büssing Nutzkraftwagen GmbH and production was concentrated on underfloor-engined trucks which were to become the firm's speciality. Most tractor units and all normal-control trucks had vertical engines, but in the mid 1960s there was a version of their Commodore maximum-weight tractor unit, the 16-210, which had a horizontal diesel mounted under the cab ahead of the front axle, the gearbox being mounted halfway along the <b>truck's</b> <b>chassis.</b>|$|R

25|$|A {{turntable}} ladder (TL) {{is perhaps the}} best-known form of special purpose aerial apparatus, and is used {{to gain access to}} fires occurring at height using a large telescopic ladder, where conventional ladders carried on conventional appliances might not reach. The name is derived {{from the fact that the}} large ladder is mounted on a turntable on the back of a <b>truck</b> <b>chassis,</b> allowing it to pivot around a stable base. To increase its length, the ladder is telescopic. Modern telescopic ladders are either hydraulic or pneumatic. These mechanical features allow the use of ladders which are longer, sturdier, and more stable. They may also have pre-attached hoses or other equipment.|$|E
25|$|LMEMS {{utilizes}} a {{fleet of}} modular ambulances manufactured by Lifeline Emergency Vehicles from Sumner, Iowa and Ford Explorer response vehicles called chase-cars. Currently three styles of ambulances are in use. Specimens of the former LFD and JCEMS (slant-sided) ambulance types remain in use until retirement with new paint and striping. The newest (post-merger) ambulances retain the straight-side feature of the former LFD type and are taller, longer, and heavier. In 2012, Ford Motor Company announced they would no longer manufacture the Econoline van ambulance prep package and subsequently LMEMS has opted to begin procuring Type I vehicles based on the F-450 pickup <b>truck</b> <b>chassis.</b> The first delivery of Type I ambulances occurred in 2013.|$|E
25|$|On August 9, 1921, the Orange Bus Line began service along Merrick Road from Freeport in Nassau County to Rosedale in Queens {{near the}} county border. On September 15, 1921, the route was {{extended}} west and {{north to the}} Jamaica business district. In 1922, Republic Motor Truck Company dealer Henry B. Carter sold two <b>truck</b> <b>chassis</b> fitted with bus bodies to the operators of the Orange Line. On February 13, 1922, the Orange Line ceased operations, and the buses reverted to Carter's ownership. Carter's new Bee-Line Bus Company operated its first bus, without a franchise, on February 19, between the Rosedale station and Jamaica. This was the predecessor to the Q5. With only two buses, the route originally operated on half-hour headways. In addition to Jamaica-Rosedale service, on April 3, 1926, Bee-Line began operating service along Merrick Road between Jamaica and Freeport, Long Island, replacing the eastern portion of the Brooklyn-Freeport Line streetcar. Bee Line originally operated from 163rd Street and Jamaica Avenue in the Jamaica business district. On October 1, 1930, the Bee Line routes began terminating at the newly constructed Jamaica Union Bus Terminal near its former terminus. The new bus terminal was located at Jamaica Avenue and New York Boulevard (now Guy R. Brewer Boulevard), adjacent to the now-closed Union Hall Street Long Island Rail Road station.|$|E

500|$|A winter {{service vehicle}} (WSV), or snow removal vehicle, {{is used to}} clear {{thoroughfares}} of ice and snow. Winter service vehicles are usually based on a dump <b>truck</b> <b>chassis,</b> with adaptations allowing them to carry specially designed snow removal equipment. Many authorities also use smaller vehicles on sidewalks, footpaths, and cycleways. Road maintenance agencies and contractors in temperate or polar areas often own several winter service vehicles, using them to keep the roads clear of snow and ice and safe for driving during winter. [...] Airports use winter service vehicles to keep both aircraft surfaces, and runways and taxiways free of snow and ice, which, besides endangering aircraft takeoff and landing, can interfere with the aerodynamics of the craft.|$|E

[...] Accordingly, when he left New York [...] in August 1928 on another journey, planning to sell half dollars along the way, he headed directly for Michigan. He arrived ill, and was hospitalized, almost dying there. [...] He was able to return home, disgruntled at having missed voting in the election (he supported the successful Republican candidate, Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover, for president) {{for the first time since}} 1853. [...] At his home in Washington state, Meeker again became ill in November, and died December 3, 1928, three and a half weeks before his 98th birthday. [...] He was buried in a cemetery in Puyallup, a place he had helped settle. [...] Meeker's headstone bears a plaque reproducing the wagon side of the half dollar.|$|E
