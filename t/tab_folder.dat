40|$|This master thesis {{provides}} {{a set of}} principles, or guidelines, which aim to give practical and useful information {{in the process of}} developing user interfaces on mobile devices. When talking about mobile devices the main focus is on PDAs and Smartphones, but it also incorporates portable PCs (including ultra portable PCs), tablet PCs and other mobile phones. The commonly used platforms, or operating systems, on these devices are Windows Mobile, Palm, Symbian, Linux and the new mobile adapted OS X. The guidelines aim to be platform independent, but most of the examples and illustrations are from the Windows Mobile environment. The problem scope is found in the space between three main axes: user interface categories, user interface challenges and design approaches. The first two have been emphasized more than the latter. Five user interface categories have been defined: form based, icon based, document based, graphic based and repetition based user interfaces. These categories are on an abstraction level above simple components and mechanisms but within the graphical user interface paradigm. As user interface challenges go, a selection of six relatively common and often encountered challenges has been selected: switching between portrait and landscape screen orientation, software keyboard showing/hidden, content larger than its display container, finger optimized user interface, switching between stylus and finger optimized user interface and user interface able to run on equipment with different screen size. These challenges are found within the problems of utilizing screen space, flexible layout at run-time and flexible layout at design-time. For designing and developing user interface four design approaches has been selected: programming, drawing, modeling and marking up a user interface. Each of these has differing pros and cons, which are dependent on the task at hand and where in the development process one might be. Current mobile device applications have been examined. These were grouped under user interface categories and paired up against one or two selected challenges. The challenges where in most case handled in a relatively basic way. In some cases these solutions maintained usability, but far from always. Some challenges were rarely handled at all. The guidelines found and presented conform to some main principles, which are: Facilitating scrolling functionality in one form or another (e. g. Panning and Borders Facilitate Scrolling), adjust or adapt components which the user interface consists of (e. g. Struts and Straps and Simple Adaptation of Existing Components), group content differently (e. g. Group Similar Components in <b>Tab</b> <b>Folders</b> and Partial <b>Tab</b> <b>Folders)</b> and do nothing, or lock the user interface (e. g. Lock User Interface in One Orientation) ...|$|R

40|$|In Government of paper, Matthew Hull {{has given}} us {{one of the most}} finely grained, ethnographically rich {{analyses}} of the role of material artifacts in the working of states. His focus on files, maps, the parchi and the petition, and lists and land records, is a sorely needed addition to the ethnographic record. As a linguistic anthropologist, he is uniquely positioned to reflect on the linguistic properties of such documents; as a broadly-trained sociocultural anthropologist, he is able to tease out the social and political implications of how these inscriptions function in the social world, what they enable people to do, and how their materiality limits their possible uses and their possible users. This book also sets up very interesting comparative possibilities for research about the state in South Asia. For example, although Hullâ€™s concerns are not identical to those raised in my recent book on Indian bureaucracy, Red tape (2012), it is interesting to read both books to ask the question of how much difference the postcolonial histories of India and Pakistan have made to their respective bureaucracies. On the one hand, the continuities exhibited by the two bureaucracies in the wake of colonial rule are truly astonishing. It has been more than sixty years since the subcontinent achieved Independence. In that time, a minirevolution has taken place in organizing and running offices. Handwriting was first replaced by typewritten documents, and then computers substituted typewriters. Techniques of filing moved from tying bundles of paper within a cardboard cover secured by tape and stored horizontally, to papers being stored in <b>tabbed</b> <b>folders</b> open on one side and stored vertically in filing cabinets, to electronic files being stored on computers and backed up in the cloud and on hard drives.

50|$|Using this <b>folder</b> <b>tab,</b> you {{are able}} to do {{evolution}} analysis of coding SNPs. You must enter a protein sequence in the first box and the substitutions relative to this protein sequence in the second box; this substitutions should be entered in the standard amino acid substitution format, e.g. L46P. PANTHER will use an alignment of evolutionarily related proteins, calculate the substitution position-specific evolutionary conservation (subPSEC) and estimate the likelihood of this nonsynonymous coding SNP to lead a functional effect on the protein. This tool uses data from PANTHER version 6.1 for technical reasons. One of the new features of PANTHER is {{that if you want to}} analyze a lot of SNPs, you can go to the download page and download the PANTHER Coding Snp Analysis tool.|$|R

This cleverly designed fact sheet set not only describes {{what to do}} if your septic system fails, but also contains all the necessary information to understand how a septic system works, how to properly maintain a septic system [...] to prevent emergencies, and how to keep maintenance records [...] all in a tidy, clearly marked and easy to find, <b>tabbed</b> <b>folder</b> that fits in a filing cabinet or notebook. This resource is inexpensive, informative, practical, and it supports the concept and value of clean water quality standards and human health. A septic system is a critical component of a home, treating liquid waste in order to prevent contamination of drinking water and nearby lakes and streams. The folder itself not only acts as an organizational device to hold vital septic system information, but also doubles as a quick-tip guide, and a maintenance record worksheet. Each of the five fact sheets inside the folder speaks to a unique topic revolving around septic systems. Fact Sheet # 1, titled "What to Do if Your Septic System Fails", describes what a failure is, why failures happen, symptoms of a failure, immediate steps to take in case of a failure, long-term options, and prevention tips. Fact Sheet # 2, "Maintaining Your Septic System: Special Considerations for Shoreline Property Owners" addresses unique issues associated with homes built near lakes, streams, or ponds, including how to identify signs that contaminants are reaching the water, and how to prevent problems. Fact Sheet # 3, "How to Conserve Water in Your Home and Yard" offers 17 water saving tips that help reduce the risk of damaging your septic system, while saving money and protecting your health. Fact Sheet # 4, "What You Need to Know When Buying or Selling a House" provides a list and description of minimum evaluation criteria, as well as an easy-to-use worksheet to aid in your home-buying or selling decision. Fact Sheet # 5, "Considerations When Building or Remodeling a Home" covers siting your septic system, codes and permits, percolation tests, design and installation, and also includes a handy table for determining minimum septic tank capacities. "Your Septic System" was developed by Cornell Cooperative Extension Project Team members Martha G. Shortlidge, Westchester County; Jo Ellen Saumier, Rockland County; Marjorie L.

40|$|Background: Electronic {{medical records}} (EMRs) provide {{universal}} {{access to health}} care information across multidisciplinary lines. In pathology departments, transfusion and apheresis medicine services (TAMS) involved in direct patient care activities produce data and documentation that typically do not enter the EMR. Taking advantage of our institutionâ€²s initiative for implementation of a paperless medical record, our TAMS division set out to develop an electronic charting (e-charting) strategy within the EMR. Methods: A focus group of our hospitalâ€²s transfusion committee consisting of transfusion medicine specialists, pathologists, residents, nurses, hemapheresis specialists, and information technologists was constituted and charged with the project. The group met periodically to implement e-charting TAMS workflow and produced electronic documents within the EMR (Cerner Millenium) for various service line functions. Results: The interdisciplinary working group developed and implemented electronic versions of various paper-based clinical documentation used by these services. All electronic notes collectively gather and reside within a unique Transfusion Medicine <b>Folder</b> <b>tab</b> in the EMR, available to staff with access to patient charts. E-charting eliminated illegible handwritten notes, resulted in more consistent clinical documentation among staff, and provided greater real-time review/access of hemotherapy practices. No major impediments to workflow or inefficiencies have been encountered. However, minor updates and corrections to documents as well as select work re-designs were required for optimal use of e-charting by these services. Conclusion: Documentation of pathology subspecialty activities such as TAMS can be successfully incorporated into the EMR. E-charting by staff enhances communication and helps promote standardized documentation of patient care within and across service lines. Well-constructed electronic documents in the EMR may also enhance data mining, quality improvement, and biovigilance monitoring activities...|$|R
