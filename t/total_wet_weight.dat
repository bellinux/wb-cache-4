First, a literature survey was conducted to collect information on the proportion of chla in phytoplankton biomass. As a result of this study (n= 21) a mean value of 0. 505 %± 0. 197 S. D. chla per unit <b>wet</b> <b>weight</b> of phytoplankton was calculated. Second, analyses were performed on 756 paired measurements from an unpublished database where the specific chla content of phytoplankton biomass was regressed against phytoplankton standing stocks and chla concentration. Within an interval of 0. 1 – 50 gm− 3 of phytoplankton <b>wet</b> <b>weight,</b> a substantial decrease in chla proportion from approximately 2. 5 % to 0. 18 % was found. Likewise, the proportion in phytoplankton <b>wet</b> <b>weight</b> decreased from 0. 7 % to 0. 15 % across a chla concentration interval of 0. 001 – 0. 150 gm− 3. These results had a significant impact both on chla-based biomass calculations and the subsequent comparison with phytoplankton biomasses resulting from microscopic counts. Assuming the microscopic method was a measure of the “true” phytoplankton standing stocks, then the precision by which phytoplankton biomass might be predicted based on chla measurements is clearly better when using variable proportions as compared to a constant conversion factor. The same holds for temporal coherence between annual records of phytoplankton biomass. The temporal fit was apparently better when relating the results of microscopic counts and biomass estimation based on variable proportions of chla in phytoplankton biomass. Nevertheless, this effect diminished as the tropic status of the lakes increased. Because of their variable specific chla content, separate taxonomic groups of phytoplankton differently affected the proportion of chla in <b>total</b> phytoplankton <b>wet</b> <b>weight.</b> Chlorophyceae, Cryptophyceae and cyanobacteria had a high impact, while Bacillariophyceae, Dinophyceae and Chrysophyceae were of lesser importance...|$|R

Estimation of individual <b>wet</b> <b>weight</b> in seabed photographs has been achieved using equations obtained from measured trawl-caught specimens for {{a limited number of}} taxa. However, a lack of appropriate conversion factors has limited estimation across taxa encompassing whole communities. Here we compile relationships between measured body dimensions and preserved <b>wet</b> <b>weights</b> for a comprehensive catalogue of abyssal epibenthic megafauna, using ~ 47, 000 specimens from the Porcupine Abyssal Plain (NE Atlantic) housed in the Discovery Collections. The practical application of the method is demonstrated using an extremely large dataset of specimen measurements from seabed photographs taken in the same location. We also collate corresponding field data on fresh <b>wet</b> <b>weight,</b> to estimate the impact of fixation in formalin and preservation in industrial denatured alcohol on the apparent biomass. Taxa with substantial proportions of soft tissues lose 35 to 60 % of their <b>wet</b> <b>weight</b> during preservation, while those with greater proportions of hard tissues lose 10 to 20 %. Our <b>total</b> estimated fresh <b>wet</b> <b>weight</b> biomass of holothurians and cnidarians in the photographic survey was ~ 20 times the previous estimates of total invertebrate biomass based on trawl catches. This dramatic uplift in megabenthic biomass has significant implications for studies of standing stocks, community metabolism, and numerical modelling of benthic carbon flows...|$|R
