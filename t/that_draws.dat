50|$|The Campaign for <b>Drawing</b> {{believes}} <b>that</b> <b>drawing</b> can be {{an enjoyable}} public activity {{as well as a}} private passion. It is inspired by the Victorian artist and writer, John Ruskin, whose mission was not to teach people how to draw, but how to see. An arts educational charity, the Campaign demonstrates <b>that</b> <b>drawing</b> is a life skill: an essential tool for thinking, inventing and communicating. Its publications for teachers and other educators provide comprehensive evidence <b>that</b> <b>drawing</b> supports formal and informal learning.|$|R

5|$|A {{metalloid}} is {{an element}} with properties in between, or that are a mixture of, those of metals and nonmetals, and which is therefore hard to classify as either a metal or a nonmetal. This is a generic definition <b>that</b> <b>draws</b> on metalloid attributes consistently cited in the literature. Difficulty of categorisation is a key attribute. Most elements have a mixture of metallic and nonmetallic properties, and can be classified according to which set of properties is more pronounced. Only the elements {{at or near the}} margins, lacking a sufficiently clear preponderance of either metallic or nonmetallic properties, are classified as metalloids.|$|E

5|$|As one of {{the major}} herbivores of {{southern}} and eastern Africa, the blue wildebeest {{plays an important role in}} the ecosystem and is a main prey item for large predators such as the lion. It is {{one of the}} animals <b>that</b> <b>draws</b> tourists to the area to observe big game and as such it is of major economic importance to the region. Traditionally blue wildebeest have been hunted for their hides and meat, the skin making good quality leather though the flesh is coarse, dry and rather hard.|$|E
5|$|CSF is {{produced}} by the choroid plexus in two steps. Firstly, a filtered form of plasma moves from fenestrated capillaries in the choroid plexus into an interstitial space, with movement guided by a difference in pressure between the blood in the capillaries and the interstitial fluid. This fluid then needs {{to pass through the}} epithelium cells lining the choroid plexus into the ventricles, an active process requiring the transport of sodium, potassium and chloride <b>that</b> <b>draws</b> water into the CSF by creating osmotic pressure. Unlike blood passing from the capillaries into the choroid plexus, the epithelial cells lining the choroid plexus contain tight junctions between cells, which act to prevent most substances flowing freely into the CSF.|$|E
5|$|In a loose, {{unstructured}} modernist narrative style <b>that</b> <b>draws</b> from Christian allegory {{and oral}} storytelling, Faulkner explores themes of race, sex, class and {{religion in the}} American South. By focusing on characters that are misfits, outcasts, or are otherwise marginalized in their community, he portrays the clash of alienated individuals against a Puritanical, prejudiced rural society. Early reception of the novel was mixed, with some reviewers critical of Faulkner's style and subject matter. However, over time, the novel {{has come to be}} {{considered one of the most}} important literary works by Faulkner and one of the best English-language novels of the 20th century.|$|E

However, Cedar Point revealed on September 18, 2014, that Mantis wouldn't be removed, but instead would be converted into a floorless roller coaster complete with new trains, new colors, and a new theme.

5|$|Saint-Saëns wrote {{more than}} forty chamber works between the 1840s and his last years. One {{of the first of}} his major works in the genre was the Piano Quintet (1855). It is a straightforward, {{confident}} piece, in a conventional structure with lively outer movements and a central movement containing two slow themes, one chorale-like and the other cantabile. The Septet (1880), for the unusual combination of trumpet, two violins, viola, cello, double bass and piano, is a neoclassical work <b>that</b> <b>draws</b> on 17th-century French dance forms. At the time of its composition Saint-Saëns was preparing new editions of the works of baroque composers including Rameau and Lully.|$|E
5|$|TY Coronae Borealis is a {{pulsating}} {{white dwarf}} (of ZZ Ceti) type, which is around 70% as massive as the Sun, yet has only 1.1% of its diameter. Discovered in 1990, UW Coronae Borealis is a low-mass X-ray binary system {{composed of a}} star less massive than the Sun and a neutron star surrounded by an accretion disk <b>that</b> <b>draws</b> material from the companion star. It varies in brightness in an unusually complex manner: the two stars orbit each other every 111 minutes, yet there is another cycle of 112.6 minutes, which corresponds to the orbit of the disk around the degenerate star. The beat period of 5.5 days indicates the time the accretion disk—which is asymmetrical—takes to precess around the star.|$|E
