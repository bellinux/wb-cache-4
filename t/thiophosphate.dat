40|$|Nucleophilic {{displacement}} {{reactions of}} monosubstituted <b>thiophosphate</b> esters have been studied. A general synthesis of isotopically chiral O-substituted [16 O, 18 O] <b>thiophosphate</b> monoesters has been developed. A new and general method for the configurational {{analysis of these}} labelled thiophosphates using high-field 31 P n. m. r. spectroscopy has been developed. The <b>thiophosphate</b> is S-alkylated with myrtenyl bromide (10 -bromopin- 2 -ene) followed by O-derivatisation either with dimethyl sulphate, diphenyldiazomethane or benzoyl chloride. Using the above analysis, {{it was found that}} the ethanolysis of the monoanion of (Rp) - 4 - nitrophenyl [16 O, 18 O] <b>thiophosphate</b> proceeds with a high degree of racemisation (ca. 80 %) and the dianion with complete racemisation, the corresponding solvolysis of the monoanion in aqueous ethanol gives ethyl <b>thiophosphate</b> with ca. 70 % racemisation; these data provide the first direct support of a freely-solvated monomeric thiometaphosphate intermediate in the case of the solvolysis of the dianion in ethanol and a relatively long-lived intermediate for the monoanion in ethanol and in aqueous ethanol. A kinetic study has also been undertaken to investigate the nature of thiophosphoryl transfer reactions in aqueous solution. The rate of hydrolysis of 2, 4 -dinitrophenyl <b>thiophosphate</b> was observed to be reduced by increased pressure with a volume of activation (?V+) of + 11 cm 3 mol- 1.

40|$|Cysteine (Cys) is {{inserted}} into proteins {{in response to}} UGC and UGU codons. Herein, we show that supplementation of mammalian cells with <b>thiophosphate</b> led to targeted insertion of Cys at the UGA codon of thioredoxin reductase 1 (TR 1). This Cys was synthesized by selenocysteine (Sec) synthase on tRNA[Ser]Sec and its insertion was dependent on the Sec insertion sequence element in the 3 ′ UTR of TR 1 mRNA. The substrate for this reaction, <b>thiophosphate,</b> was synthesized by selenophosphate synthetase 2 from ATP and sulfide and reacted with phosphoseryl-tRNA[Ser]Sec to generate Cys-tRNA[Ser]Sec. Cys was inserted in vivo at UGA codons in natural mammalian TRs, and this process was regulated by dietary selenium and availability of <b>thiophosphate.</b> Cys occurred at 10 % of the Sec levels in liver TR 1 of mice maintained on a diet with normal amounts of selenium and at 50 % in liver TR 1 of mice maintained on a selenium deficient diet.

40|$|Nucleophilic {{substitution}} reactions involving phosphate monoesters {{have been}} investigated. Two general syntheses of O-alkyl or O-aryl [16 O, 18 O] <b>thiophosphate</b> monoesters are reported. An independent and general method for {{the determination of}} the enantiomeric excess of isotopically chiral <b>thiophosphate</b> monoesters has been developed and the absolute configurations of the diastereoisomers of (2 R) -O-(O-ethyl thiophosphoryl) - 3, 4 S-dimethyl- 5 S-phenyl-l, 3, 2 -oxazaphos- pholidin- 2 -one have been assigned. The solvolysis of p-nitrophenyl [R- 16 O, 18 O] <b>thiophosphate</b> in ethanol gives rise to ethyl [16 O, 18 O] <b>thiophosphate</b> with a large degree of racemisation of configuration (~ 80 %). This observation is consistent with the formation of a thiometaphosphate intermediate of finite life-time which is then trapped by ethanol with accompanying loss of stereochemical integrity. This study provides the first direct evidence for a monomeric thiometaphosphate in protic solvent. During the course of developing the stereochemical analysis, it was noted that O-ethyl <b>thiophosphate</b> reacts with cis- 2 -chloro- 3, 4 -dimethyl- 5 -phenyl-l, 3, 2 -oxazaphospholidin- 2 -one with ca. 10 % inversion and 90 % retention of configuration.

These reactions require an in-line exocyclic displacement at a phosphorus centre held in a five-membered ring. Nucleophilic substitution at di- and tri-esters have also been studied. The stereochemical course of the hydrolysis of the 1, 3, 2 -dioxaphosphor- inan- 2 -one system involving good leaving groups such as chloride and fluoride occur with inversion of configuration via an in-line mechanism, whereas hydrolysis of this system involving poor leaving groups occurs with retention of configuration via a pseudorotation mechanism...|$|E

40|$|Apoptosis {{is a form}} of {{self-regulated}} {{cell death}} which differs from necrosis (1). The characteristic morphological changes of apoptosis include membrane blebbing, chromatin condensation and the formation of apoptotic bodies. In addition, apoptotic cells undergo DNA double strand cleavage into fragments of multiples of about 185 – 200 bp resulting in a characteristic laddering pattern on agarose gel electrophoresis (2 – 4). Apoptosis is necessary for normal embryonic and tissue differentiation (3, 5, 6). Cell death in tumors, whether spontaneous or treatment-induced, occurs predominantly via apoptosis rather than necrosis (7, 8). <b>Thiophosphate</b> is a sulfur-substituted analog of orthophosphate that is an essential component of commonly used hydrolysis-resistant nucleotide analogs such as ATPgS and GTPgS as well as thiophosphorylated forms of DNA that are popular in antisense transfection studies.

Whereas only four lithium per formula unit (Li/f. u.) can be inserted reversibly into the phosphates, up to 7 and 10 Li/f. u. can be inserted reversibly in the <b>thiophosphates</b> with A = Li and Ag. Moreover, the Ag+ to Ag 0 reduction in AgTi 2 (PO 4) 3 is not reversible, but in AgTi 2 (PS 4) 3 it is reversible.
