5|$|In Liverpool, at 8:30 am on 17 May, Saturday, {{the twins}} went into St Anne Street Police Station to report {{concerns}} over Sabina's children. At midday the pair boarded a National Express coach to London. A police report {{stated that the}} twins suddenly disembarked from the coach at Keele services, a motorway service station, as they were not feeling well. The driver of the coach, however, said he left them at Keele services after becoming suspicious of their behaviour. He noticed the twins clinging tightly to <b>their</b> <b>bags</b> and did not let them re-board because they refused to let him search <b>their</b> <b>bags</b> for illegal items. The manager of the service station was informed and, also feeling suspicious of the pair, called the police. Officers arrived {{to talk to them}} but left after deeming the women harmless.|$|E
5|$|Leslie (Amy Poehler) and the Pawnee parks {{department}} {{prepares for}} a visit by park department officials from Boraqua, Pawnee's Sister City in Venezuela. Leslie warns her co-workers the Venezuelan government officials will likely be poor, simple people. Later, the Venezuelan delegation arrives, headed by their parks department vice director Raul Alejandro Bastilla Pedro de Veloso de Morana, the Vice-director Ejecutivo del Diputado del Departmento de Parques, L.G.V. (Fred Armisen), Antonio, Jhonny and Elvis. There are cultural clashes right away, like when they mistake Tom (Aziz Ansari) for a servant and order him to get <b>their</b> <b>bags.</b> They also mistakenly believe they can choose any woman to have sex with; they all favor Donna (Retta). Raul and Leslie exchange gifts during a meet-and-greet party, where Raul and the Venezuelans act condescending toward the Pawnee residents, making offensive remarks about the town and mocking the gifts Leslie gives them. They continue to give orders to Tom, who follows along because they give him large cash tips.|$|E
5|$|The Cooper {{hijacking}} {{marked the}} beginning of the end for unfettered and unscrutinized airline travel. Despite the initiation of the federal sky marshal program the previous year, 31 hijackings were committed in U.S. airspace in 1972; 19 of them were for the specific purpose of extorting money and most of the rest were attempts to reach Cuba. In 15 of the extortion cases the hijackers also demanded parachutes. In early 1973 the FAA began requiring airlines to search all passengers and <b>their</b> <b>bags.</b> Amid multiple lawsuits charging that such searches violated Fourth Amendment protections against search and seizure, federal courts ruled that they were acceptable when applied universally, and when limited to searches for weapons and explosives. In contrast to the 31 hijackings in 1972, only two were attempted in 1973, both by psychiatric patients, one of whom intended to crash the airliner into the White House to kill President Nixon.|$|E

Reverend Sampson (Howard Bell) then invites {{everyone}} to stand as Charlene and Henry begin their walk up the aisle. Scott and Charlene exchange vows and Reverend Sampson pronounces them man and wife. At the reception, Jim tells Scott that he is proud of him and welcomes Charlene to the family. Harold Bishop (Ian Smith) finds Madge crying in the kitchen and he comforts her. They are interrupted by Mrs. Mangel (Vivean Gray) who informs them that the telegrams from Max and Maria, Clive and Rosemary, who all are unable to attend, are being read out. Dan Ramsay (Syd Conabere) spots a mouse and tries to pick it up, but hits Mrs. Mangel's foot. She accuses Dan of groping her and as he protests his innocence, an argument breaks out among the guests. Scott and Charlene go to his bedroom and Gail brings them a gift from her father. Jane comes to tell Charlene {{that it is time to}} get changed for the honeymoon, while Paul takes <b>their</b> <b>bags</b> out to the car.

Bradley and Stacey quickly pack <b>their</b> <b>bags</b> at home. Max Branning (Jake Wood) says an emotional goodbye to his son and Jack agrees to help them escape. They leave via the back door as Max delays the police at the front, and hide a few streets away. Jack also leaves by the back door but Marsden sees him and he is unable to meet Bradley and Stacey, who are nervously waiting. Bradley says they should go without Jack, but when they go to get a taxi to St Pancras railway station, Bradley realises he has left the passports at home and goes back to get them, leaving Stacey to wait. However, Stacey grows impatient and phones him. The police notice him when his phone rings, and in a bid to escape them, he runs up a fire escape and crawls across the roof of The Queen Victoria with an officer following him. He shouts at Stacey to run, but stumbles and falls backwards from the roof to the ground, dying instantly. Max and Stacey are devastated, and he pulls her away from the body. She tells him it is her fault, as Bradley did not kill Archie, she did. The following day, Marsden says the police will no longer be pursuing the investigation. Stacey then goes missing, and on the day of Bradley's funeral, Jack receives news that a court has found Bradley guilty of Archie's murder.|$|E

25|$|In 2001, {{when the}} Changi Airport Line was opened, {{some of these}} trains plying the East West Line had luggage racks {{installed}}.

25|$|In U.S. seasons five through nine, {{the last}} team {{to check in}} was {{stripped}} of all their money and was not given any money {{at the start of}} the next leg, forcing that team to literally beg for money from the local population of the city they were in for such expenses as cab, bus, or train fare. In addition, from seasons seven through nine, these teams would also be forced to give up all <b>their</b> <b>bags</b> and possessions therein, leaving them with only the clothes on their backs and the fanny pack teams use to carry their passports and Race documentation; this latter penalty caused many teams, thinking themselves to be in last place, to wear as much clothing as possible before checking in.|$|E
25|$|However, these luggage racks {{were always}} underutilised. Travellers {{preferred}} {{holding on to}} <b>their</b> <b>bags</b> where they were standing or sitting, as opposed to placing them on the luggage racks, probably due to convenience and fear of theft. Some commuters were also complaining that these racks took up critically needed space which could be occupied by other passengers which often filled the train. Furthermore, the service to Changi Airport was cancelled and replaced by a shuttle service to and from Tanah Merah station, dismissing {{the need to provide}} these racks for non-airport bound train services. Therefore, in 2003, trains with the luggage racks had them removed, and replaced with an empty standing area, with a dual purpose of serving as a wheelchair area.|$|E

Upon hearing this, Den becomes wracked with guilt, and so decides to revise his plans and stay with Angie. He sets about organising a second honeymoon for them in Venice. However, their holiday is ruined when Jan arrives, and upon seeing her and Den together, Angie starts drinking again having not long given up. On the way home from Venice on the Orient Express, a drunk Angie tells the barman all about her big lie. Unfortunately for Angie, Den overhears every word, and from that moment on he reverts to his original plan to leave her, although he decides to wait a while before letting Angie know that he knows about her lie. On Christmas Day that year, Den decides to get his revenge. Thinking that her marriage is safe, Angie is happier than ever - until Den informs her that he'd overheard her conversation with the barman, and he then serves her divorce papers as a Christmas present. This episode had the highest number of viewers the show has ever seen - with more than 30 million viewers (more than half of the British population) tuning in to see it.

30|$|In Experiment 3, {{observers}} {{were asked to}} detect an event where an agent would “pass” <b>their</b> <b>bag</b> to another, empty-handed agent. In Experiment 4, {{observers were}} asked to detect the event where the agent holding a blue <b>bag</b> would “exchange” <b>their</b> <b>bag</b> with another agent holding a black bag. As in the previous two experiments, both experiments consisted of four blocks of 50 trials, each with a different tracking set size (N) 2, 4, 6 or 8. Note {{that the number of}} items shown in each display was twice as big as the effective tracking set sizes because observers only needed to track half of the items in order to detect the event. For instance, if the tracking set size was 4 in Experiment 3, there would be four items holding a black bag and another four items without a bag. To detect the event, observers only need to monitor those four items with/without a bag rather than track all the items on the screen.|$|R

Initially it was to be released as the third single from the album. However, the song [...] "Get Together" [...] was chosen as the third single from the album to coincide with the start of Madonna's 2006 Confessions Tour. The decision was also spurred by the fact that [...] "Get Together" [...] was the third best selling digital single from the Confessions on a Dance Floor album. Its digital sales stood at 20,000 at that time, whereas digital sales for [...] "Jump" [...] was only 9,000. Hence, [...] "Get Together" [...] was finally chosen as the third single.

At the first checkpoint, each team has to run outside of buoys, through the water, to the second checkpoint, which is a [...] "peg-jumping" [...] puzzle station. There are four sandbags that weigh 25 pounds each next to an empty duffle bag. Each team will be given three attempts to correctly solve a puzzle. If a team solves the puzzle on the first attempt, they {{will be allowed to}} continue to the next checkpoint without having to carry any sandbags into <b>their</b> designated duffle <b>bag.</b> After the second unsuccessful attempt, a team will be required to add 50 pounds to <b>their</b> designated duffle <b>bag.</b> If a team does not correctly solve a puzzle after the third attempt, that team will be required to add all four sandbags to <b>their</b> duffle <b>bag,</b> and carry it to the next checkpoint. Darrell & Aviv solved the puzzle after the third attempt, in which they were required to add 50 pounds to <b>their</b> duffle <b>bag,</b> while Tina & Kenny and Wes Casey each failed to solve the puzzles after three attempts. The third checkpoint is [...] "Military Crawl," [...] in which each team has to crawl under military-style posts, but have to drag <b>their</b> duffle <b>bags</b> under the posts, and are not allowed to throw <b>their</b> duffle <b>bags</b> over the posts. After the military crawl, each team must still carry the weight of <b>their</b> designated duffle <b>bags</b> to the fourth checkpoint, [...] "Carry Your Partner," [...] in which the male partners carry their female partners to the next checkpoint while continuing to carry <b>their</b> duffle <b>bags</b> until they reach a sign that says [...] "continue to your next checkpoint." [...] The fifth checkpoint is [...] "Stick Squares" [...] puzzle station, in which teams must make two equal squares by moving four sticks.
