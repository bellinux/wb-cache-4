25|$|A {{significant}} portion of the Board's business was derived from the evening fares of people going out to social functions or events at places such as cinemas, dance halls, clubs, and the like.

First, it helped them focus on positive life experiences, relieving their ongoing preoccupation with cancer. Second, it enhanced their self-worth and identity by providing them with opportunities to demonstrate continuity, challenge, and achievement.

25|$|On September 6, 2006, News Feed was announced, {{which appears}} on every user's {{homepage}} and highlights information including profile changes, upcoming events, and birthdays of the user's friends. This enabled spammers and other users to manipulate these features by creating illegitimate events or posting fake birthdays {{to attract attention}} to their profile or cause. Initially, the News Feed caused dissatisfaction among Facebook users; some complained it was too cluttered and full of undesired information, others were concerned that it made it too easy for others to track individual activities (such as relationship status changes, events, and conversations with other users). In response, Zuckerberg issued an apology for the site's failure to include appropriate customizable privacy features.

2500|$|Richards and Rogers' 1982 {{approach}} expanded on Anthony's three-level framework; however, {{instead of}} approach, method and technique, they chose the terms approach, design, and procedure. Their concept of approach {{was similar to}} Anthony's, but their design and procedure were of broader scope than Anthony's method and technique. Their design referred to all major practical implications in the classroom, such as syllabus design, <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>activities</b> {{to be used in}} the classroom, and student and teacher roles; procedure referred to different behaviors, practices and techniques observed in the classroom. These new terms were intended to address limitations in Anthony's framework, and also gave them specific criteria by which they could evaluate different [...] "methods".

2500|$|The CIA {{officer in}} charge of the covert war, Duane [...] "Dewey" [...] Clarridge, {{admitted}} to the House Intelligence Committee staff in a secret briefing in 1984 that the Contras were routinely murdering [...] "civilians and Sandinista officials in the provinces, as well as heads of cooperatives, nurses, doctors and judges". But he claimed that this did not violate President Reagan's executive order prohibiting assassinations because the agency defined it as just 'killing'. [...] "After all, this is war—a paramilitary operation," [...] Clarridge said in conclusion. Edgar Chamorro explained the rationale behind this to a U.S. reporter. [...] "Sometimes terror is very productive. This is the policy, to keep putting pressure until the people cry 'uncle'". The CIA manual for the Contras, Tayacan, actually states that the aim of targeting Sandinstas and their collaborators was to [...] "reduce their influence" [...] as well as to intimidate the population at large. These <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>activities</b> continued throughout the war. After the signing of the Central American Peace Accord in August 1987, the year war related deaths and economic destruction reached its peak, the Contras eventually entered negotiations with the Sandinista government (1988), and the war began to deescalate.|$|E
40|$|M-dwarfs {{demonstrate}} two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> activity: 1) strong (kilogauss) almost axisymmetric poloidal magnetic fields; and 2) considerably weaker nonaxisymmetric fields, sometimes {{including a}} substantial toroidal component.

On the other hand, the solar magnetic dipole at times of magnetic field inversion becomes transverse to the rotation axis, while the magnetic field becomes weaker at times far from that of inversion. Thus the Sun resembles a star with the second <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity.</b> We suggest that M-dwarfs can have magnetic cycles, and that M-dwarfs with the second <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> can just be stars observed at times of magnetic field inversion.
