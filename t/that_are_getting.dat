There's an offer made to you that will put your family on a footing quite genteel,--no gentlefolks in the county more so; and you, too, <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> past your work!" ...|$|E

Three or four new carts are going to be put on instead of some of the old ones, and there are ten first-rate horses coming in place of some of those <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> past work. The stables are all being done up, and the thing is going to be done tip-top. Curiously enough his name is the same as yours, John Holl." ...|$|E

60|$|At {{that time}} very little was {{written about the}} great fallacy of the present day, Free Trade; which is an {{illusion}} about which men now talk, and dispute, and almost fight, while no living mortal can tell what it really is. It is wise for us in America, who never had anything but free trade, according to modern doctrines, {{to look a little}} closely into the sophisms <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> to be so much in vogue; and which, whenever they come from our illustrious ancestors in Great Britain, have some such effect on the imaginations of a portion of our people, as purling rills and wooded cascades are known to posses over those of certain young ladies of fifteen.|$|E
6000|$|They {{were buying}} their Maine tackle at Ijams Brothers', the Sporting Goods Mart, {{with the help}} of Willis Ijams, fellow member of the Boosters' Club. Babbitt was {{completely}} mad. He trumpeted and danced. He muttered to Paul, [...] "Say, this is pretty good, eh? To be buying the stuff, eh? And good old Willis Ijams himself coming down on the floor to wait on us! Say, if those fellows <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> their kit for the North Lakes knew we were going clear up to Maine, they'd have a fit, eh? [...] . Well, come on, Brother Ijams--Willis, I mean. Here's your chance! We're a couple of easy marks! Whee! Let me at it! I'm going to buy out the store!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I see, brother, you are {{offended}} that I followed your motions, though, in so doing, I did no {{more than}} obey a signal of your own setting. Did you expect an old sea-dog like me, who has stood his watch so long in a flag-ship, to confess ignorance in any matter that of right belongs to blue water? How the devil was I {{to know that there}} is not some sort of craft, among the thousands <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> into fashion, which sails best stern foremost? They say a ship is modelled from a fish; and, if such be the case, it is only to make one after the fashion of a crab, or an oyster, to have the very thing you named." ...|$|E

60|$|The Hook and the Five Points are {{two pieces}} of tabooed {{territory}} {{within the limits of}} the good town of Manhattan, <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> to be renowned for their rascality and orgies. They probably want nothing but the proclamation of a governor in vindication of their principles, annexed to a pardon of some of their unfortunate children, to render both classical. If we continue to make much further progress in political logic, and {{in the same direction as}} that in which we have already proceeded so far, neither will probably long be in want of this illustration. Votes can be given by the virtuous citizens of both these purlieus, as well as by the virtuous citizens of the anti-rent districts, and votes contain the essence of all such principles, as well as of their glorification.|$|E
