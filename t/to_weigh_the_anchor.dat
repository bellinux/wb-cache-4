[...] During the course of the trial Duncan objected several times to stop the prosecutor in irrelevant and in leading questions, or in perversions of answers. The admiralty was therefore desirous that he should not sit on the court-martial of Sir Hugh Palliser for failure to obey orders during the same battle. The court-martial was set for April. [...] The day before the assembling of the court the admiralty sent down orders for the Monarch to go to St. Helens. Her crew, however, refused <b>to</b> <b>weigh</b> <b>the</b> <b>anchor</b> until they were paid their advance; and as this could not be done in time, the Monarch was still in Portsmouth harbour when the signal for the court-martial was made; so that, sorely against the wishes of the admiralty, Duncan sat on this court-martial also.|$|E

These orders were obeyed with three cheers; and ere the sun went down full many a hornpipe had been danced on deck by the uncouth though agile William.|$|E

[...] (It was the other way about really.) [...] "This morning before the dawn, when he thought that {{everybody}} was asleep, the Portuguese captain and some of his Arabs began <b>to</b> <b>weigh</b> <b>the</b> <b>anchor</b> quite quietly; also to hoist the sails. But Mr. Somers and I, being very much awake, came out of the cabin and he sat upon the capstan with a revolver in his hand, saying--well, sir, I will not repeat what he said." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{evening before}} he was to sail for the Downs, where the Middlesex lay ready <b>to</b> <b>weigh</b> <b>anchor,</b> <b>the</b> new {{lieutenant}} was summoned by Winter to attend him to the General's residence, {{for the purpose of}} being introduced to his patron, to thank him at once, and to bid him farewell. On the road, the old man took the liberty of schooling his companion concerning the respect which he ought to pay to his master, [...] "who was, though a kind and generous man as ever came from Northumberland, extremely rigid in punctiliously exacting the degree of honour which was his due." ...|$|R
60|$|Rendered desperate, they at last {{determined}} to mutiny, {{and the first}} outbreak occurred on the 15th April in the Channel fleet, which was at <b>the</b> time <b>anchored</b> at Spithead. On Admiral Lord Bridport giving <b>the</b> signal <b>to</b> <b>weigh</b> <b>anchor,</b> <b>the</b> seamen of the flagship, instead of proceeding to their stations, ran up the rigging and gave three cheers, and the crews {{of the rest of}} the ships at once did the same. The officers attempted to induce the men to return to their duty, but in vain. The next day two delegates from each ship met on the Queen Charlotte, the flagship, to deliberate, and the day after all the men swore to stand by their leaders, and such officers as had rendered themselves obnoxious to the men were put on shore.|$|R
60|$|When Mr. M'Kay {{returned}} on board, {{the interpreter}} related what had passed, and {{begged him to}} prevail upon the captain to make sail, as from {{his knowledge of the}} temper and pride {{of the people of the}} place, he was sure they would resent the indignity offered to one of their chiefs. Mr. M'Kay, who himself possessed some experience of Indian character, went to the captain, who was still pacing the deck in moody humor, represented the danger to which his hasty act had exposed the vessel, and urged him <b>to</b> <b>weigh</b> <b>anchor.</b> <b>The</b> captain made light of his counsels, and pointed to his cannon and fire-arms as sufficient safeguard against naked savages. Further remonstrances only provoked taunting replies and sharp altercations. The day passed away without any signs of hostility, and at night the captain retired as usual to his cabin, taking no more than the usual precautions.|$|R
60|$|Xury was dreadfully frighted, {{and indeed}} so was I too; {{but we were}} both more frighted when we heard one of these mighty creatures come {{swimming}} towards our boat; we could not see him, but we might hear him by his blowing to be a monstrous huge and furious beast. Xury {{said it was a}} lion, and it might be so for aught I know; but poor Xury cried to me <b>to</b> <b>weigh</b> <b>the</b> <b>anchor</b> and row away; “No,” says I, “Xury; we can slip our cable, with the buoy to it, and go off to sea; they cannot follow us far.” I had no sooner said so, but I perceived the creature (whatever it was) within two oars’ length, which something surprised me; however, I immediately stepped to the cabin door, and taking up my gun, fired at him; upon which he immediately turned about and swam towards the shore again.|$|E
