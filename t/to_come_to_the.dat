Previously, in 227 BC, two ambassadors from Megalopolis {{had been sent to}} Macedon to request help. Antigonus showed little interest at the time, and these efforts failed. Aratus wanted the Macedonian king <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Peloponnese and defeat Cleomenes, but Antigonus asked control of Acrocorinth in return. This was a sacrifice that the League was not willing to make, however, and they declined to seek help from Macedon.|$|E

Commentators suggested at the time that they represented the possibility of a change in the way in which new bands are promoted and marketed.

Relations between the two were further strained when, upon asking for a private interview with Buchanan, Breckinridge was told <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> White House and ask for Harriet Lane, who acted as the mansion's host for the unmarried president. Feeling slighted by the response, Breckinridge refused to carry out these instructions; later, three of Buchanan's intimates informed Breckinridge that requesting to speak to Miss Lane was actually a secret instruction to White House staff to usher the requestor into a private audience with the president. They also conveyed Buchanan's apologies for the misunderstanding.|$|E

5|$|However, {{war with}} England {{continued}} {{for several decades}} {{after the death of}} Bruce. A civil war between the Bruce dynasty and their long-term Comyn-Balliol rivals lasted until the middle of the 14th century.

The Stewarts ruled Scotland {{for the remainder of the}} Middle Ages. The country they ruled experienced greater prosperity from the end of the 14th century through the Scottish Renaissance to the Reformation. This was despite continual warfare with England, the increasing division between Highlands and Lowlands, and a large number of royal minorities.|$|E

By March 1908 both had work exhibited at the Newlyn Art Gallery and Harold Knight was an established professional portrait painter, while Laura Knight was still developing her art.
