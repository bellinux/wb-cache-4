5|$|While {{working at}} the {{hardware}} store, Gardiner first played organised sports {{as a member of}} the store's baseball team. Gardiner quickly started playing ice hockey, with the same passion as the children who were born in Canada. As he didn't learn to skate until he was eight-years-old, he couldn't skate very fast and was forced <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>as</b> the goaltender. He had tried <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>as</b> a forward and defenceman, but was too slow for either position. Playing on Winnipeg's frozen ponds, Gardiner employed an acrobatic style, instead of the nearly-universal stand-up style played in that era, to avoid having his hands and feet frostbitten. He joined the Victorias, a team in the Winnipeg City League, at the age of 13. He recorded a shutout in his first game, but the team was shut out in their following game, so Gardiner was cut. By the age of 14, Gardiner made the intermediate team of the Selkirk Fishermen.|$|E
