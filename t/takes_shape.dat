25|$|Unlike the American {{version of}} The Thing {{released}} on Blu-ray, the European version features {{most of the}} extras from the 1998 and 2005 DVD releases. These extras include the documentary The Thing: Terror <b>Takes</b> <b>Shape</b> although several extras, most notably the alternate ending, were not included. The Blu-ray version also includes various Blu-ray-only features, such as a HD version of the film (although the extras are still presented in 480i/p, depending on the extra) {{as well as a}} picture-in-picture mode that pops up at various points of the film. Although the feature is new, the footage included in the picture-in-picture mode is all taken from The Thing: Terror <b>Takes</b> <b>Shape</b> documentary.|$|E

As it dangles, its {{exoskeleton}} hardens and <b>takes</b> <b>shape.</b> The process may take minutes in small spiders, or some hours in the larger Mygalomorphs. Some spiders, such as some Synema species, members of the Thomisidae (crab spiders), mate while the female is still callow, during which time she is unable to eat the male.|$|E
25|$|Some {{examples}} {{of social and}} religious transition ceremonies {{that can be found}} in the U.S., as well as in other cultures around the world, are Confirmation, Bar and Bat Mitzvahs, Quinceañeras, sweet sixteens, cotillions, and débutante balls. In other countries, initiation ceremonies play an important role, marking the transition into adulthood or the entrance into adolescence. This transition may be accompanied by obvious physical changes, which can vary from a change in clothing to tattoos and scarification. Furthermore, transitions into adulthood may also vary by gender, and specific rituals may be more common for males or for females. This illuminates the extent to which adolescence is, at least in part, a social construction; it <b>takes</b> <b>shape</b> differently depending on the cultural context, and may be enforced more by cultural practices or transitions than by universal chemical or biological physical changes.|$|E
25|$|The Thing has {{subsequently}} {{been released}} twice on DVD by Universal in 1998 and 2005. The 1998 edition was a Universal Collector's Edition, featuring The Thing: Terror <b>Takes</b> <b>Shape,</b> an extensive 83-minute documentary. It details {{all aspects of}} the film and features interviews from many of the people involved. There are detailed stories from the cast and crew concerning the adapted screenplay, the special effects, the post-production, the critical reception, and more. Other features include deleted scenes, the alternative ending shown in the television version, a theatrical trailer and production notes. Additionally, John Carpenter and Kurt Russell provide commentary throughout the film. An anamorphic widescreen transfer was not included, but this omission was remedied with the second DVD/HD DVD release in October 2004, which featured identical supplements to the 1998 release, {{with the exception of the}} isolated score track from the documentary. The film was released on Blu-ray Disc in Europe on October 6, 2008.|$|E

2500|$|In the {{documentary}} Terror <b>Takes</b> <b>Shape</b> on the DVD, film editor Todd C. Ramsay {{states that he}} made the suggestion to Carpenter to film a [...] "happy" [...] ending for the film, purely for protective reasons, while they had Russell available. Carpenter agreed and shot {{a scene in which}} MacReady has been rescued and administered a blood test, proving that he is still human. Ramsay follows this by saying that The Thing had two test screenings, but Carpenter did not use the sequence in either of them, as the director felt that the film worked better with its eventual nihilistic conclusion. The alternate ending with MacReady definitively proven to be human has yet to be released.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout {{the twentieth}} century, a trend towards larger store {{footprints}} became discernible. The average {{size of a}} U.S. supermarket grew from 31,000 square feet in 1991 to 44,000 square feet in 2000. In 1963, Carrefour opened the first hypermarket in St Genevieve-de-Bois, near Paris, France. By {{the end of the}} twentieth century, stores were using labels such as [...] "mega-stores" [...] and [...] "warehouse" [...] stores to reflect their growing size. In Australia, for example, the popular hardware chain, Bunnings has shifted from smaller [...] "home centres" [...] (retail floor space under 5,000 square metres) to [...] "warehouse" [...] stores (retail floor space between 5,000 and 21,000 square metres) in order to accommodate a wider range of goods and in response to population growth and changing consumer preferences. The upward trend of increasing retail space was not consistent across nations, and led in the early 21st century to a 2-fold difference in square footage per capita between the United States and Europe. As the 21st century <b>takes</b> <b>shape,</b> some indications suggest that large retail stores have come under increasing pressure from online sales models and that reductions in store size are evident.|$|E
2500|$|The {{crown of}} the tooth, which is {{influenced}} by the shape of the inner enamel epithelium, also <b>takes</b> <b>shape</b> during this stage. Throughout the mouth, all teeth undergo this same process; it is still uncertain why teeth form various crown shapes—for instance, incisors versus canines. There are two dominant hypotheses. The [...] "field model" [...] proposes there are components for each type of tooth shape found in the ectomesenchyme during tooth development. The components for particular types of teeth, such as incisors, are localized in one area and dissipate rapidly {{in different parts of the}} mouth. Thus, for example, the [...] "incisor field" [...] has factors that develop teeth into incisor shape, and this field is concentrated in the central incisor area, but decreases rapidly in the canine area. The other dominant hypothesis, the [...] "clone model", proposes that the epithelium programs a group of ectomesenchymal cells to generate teeth of particular shapes. This group of cells, called a clone, coaxes the dental lamina into tooth development, causing a tooth bud to form. Growth of the dental lamina continues in an area called the [...] "progress zone". Once the progress zone travels a certain distance from the first tooth bud, a second tooth bud will start to develop. These two models are not necessarily mutually exclusive, nor does widely accepted dental science consider them to be so: it is postulated that both models influence tooth development at different times.|$|E
