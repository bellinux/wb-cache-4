5|$|Dams, weirs {{and other}} instream {{barriers}} block {{the migration of}} adult and juvenile Murray cod and prevent recolonisation of habitats and maintenance of isolated populations. Additionally, recent study has proven approximately 50% of Murray cod larvae are killed when <b>they</b> <b>pass</b> <b>through</b> undershot weirs.|$|E
5|$|Like all ants, banded sugar ants begin life as eggs. If the egg is fertilised, the ant {{becomes a}} female; if not, {{it will become}} a male. They develop through {{complete}} metamorphosis, meaning that <b>they</b> <b>pass</b> <b>through</b> a larval and pupal stage before emerging as adults.|$|E
5|$|Like other ants, Myrmecia ants {{begin as}} an egg. If the egg is fertilised, the ant becomes a diploid female; if not, {{it becomes a}} haploid male. They develop through {{complete}} metamorphosis, meaning that <b>they</b> <b>pass</b> <b>through</b> larval and pupal stages before emerging as adults.|$|E

5|$|As the {{trunkline}} heads {{away from}} Bay City, it runs {{parallel to the}} Lake State Railway again. M-13 intersects {{the northern end of}} its connector route before Huron Road crosses the Kawkawlin River. The highway runs through the community of the same name {{on the north side of}} the river. M-13 and Huron Road continue north across mixed agricultural and forest land as <b>they</b> <b>pass</b> <b>through</b> the communities of Linwood and Pinconning. South of Standish in Arenac County, M-13 meets the northern end of the US23 freeway and terminates.|$|E
5|$|The low-lying damp ground {{can produce}} a visual effect known as a Fata Morgana when the Tor appears to rise out of the mist. This optical {{phenomenon}} occurs because rays of light are strongly bent when <b>they</b> <b>pass</b> <b>through</b> air layers of different temperatures in a steep thermal inversion where an atmospheric duct has formed. The Italian term Fata Morgana {{is derived from the}} name of Morgan le Fay, a powerful sorceress in Arthurian legend.|$|E

5|$|The toll {{portion of}} SR 133 employs a barrier toll system, where drivers are charged {{flat-rate}} tolls {{based on what}} particular toll booths <b>they</b> <b>pass</b> <b>through.</b> Tolls are collected at selected on- and off-ramps; and at the Orange Grove Toll Plaza, which spans the on-and off-ramps to Northbound SR 241 (traffic to and from Southbound SR 241 instead pay at the Tomato Springs Toll Plaza located on SR 241 immediately south of the 133/241 interchange).|$|E
5|$|Tourette's {{is defined}} {{as part of a}} {{spectrum}} of tic disorders, which includes provisional, transient and persistent (chronic) tics. While the exact cause is unknown, it is believed to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors. There are no specific tests for diagnosing Tourette's; it is not always correctly identified because most cases are mild and the severity of tics decreases for most children as <b>they</b> <b>pass</b> <b>through</b> adolescence. Extreme Tourette's in adulthood, though sensationalized in the media, is a rarity; tics are often unnoticed by casual observers.|$|E

5|$|When {{operating}} a full circle route, trains start through the Common Tunnel. If running clockwise, <b>they</b> <b>pass</b> <b>through</b> all the common stations (Tøyen, Grønland, Jernbanetorget, Stortinget, Nationaltheatret and Majorstuen). They head {{north on the}} Sognsvann Line, stopping at Blindern, Forskningsparken and Ullevål stadion. The Ring Line proper then splits off, and the trains serve Nydalen, Storo and Sinsen, before Carl Berners plass on the Grorud Line. After that, the trains again enter the Common Tunnel at Tøyen.|$|E
5|$|According to FN, the 5.7×28mm {{cartridge}} has {{an effective}} range of 200m (219yd) {{and a maximum}} range of 1,800m (1,969yd) when fired from the P90, and an effective range of 50m (55yd) and a maximum range of 1,510m (1,651yd) when fired from the Five-seven. In testing, the SS190 and similar 5.7×28mm projectiles consistently turn base over point ("tumble") as <b>they</b> <b>pass</b> <b>through</b> ballistic gelatin and other media, using the 21.6-mm (.85in) projectile length to create a larger wound cavity. However, some are skeptical of the bullet's terminal performance, {{and it is a}} subject of debate among civilian shooters in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Data {{collected}} in the North Sea {{have shown that the}} overall incidence of decompression sickness for in-water and surface decompression is similar, but surface decompression tends to produce ten times more type II (neurological) DCS than in-water decompression. A possible explanation is that during the final stage of ascent, bubbles are produced that are stopped in the lung capillaries. During recompression of the diver in the deck chamber, the diameter of some of these bubbles is reduced sufficiently that <b>they</b> <b>pass</b> <b>through</b> the pulmonary capillaries and reach the systemic circulation on the arterial side, later lodging in systemic capillaries and causing neurological symptoms. The same scenario was proposed for type II DCS recorded after sawtooth profile diving or multiple repetitive diving.|$|E

5|$|In testing {{conducted}} by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) in 1999, the SS190 fired from the P90 {{at a distance of}} 25m (27yd) exhibited an average penetration depth of 25cm (9.85in) in ballistic gelatin covered with a Level II vest. The SS190 exhibited penetration depths ranging from 28 to 34cm (11 to 13.5in) when fired from the P90 into bare ballistic gelatin, in tests {{conducted by}} Houston Police Department SWAT. In testing, the SS190 and similar 5.7×28mm projectiles consistently turn base over point ("tumble") as <b>they</b> <b>pass</b> <b>through</b> ballistic gelatin and other media, using the 21.6-mm (.85in) projectile length to create a larger wound cavity.

5|$|Like every ant, {{the life}} of a jack jumper ant starts from an egg. If the egg is fertilised, the ant will be a female (diploid); if not, it will become a male (haploid). They develop through {{complete}} metamorphosis, meaning that <b>they</b> <b>pass</b> <b>through</b> a larva and pupa stage before emerging as an adult. Cocoons that are isolated from the colony are able to shed their pupal skin before hatching, allowing themselves to advance to full pigmentation. Newborns can also eclose (emerge from their pupa stage) without assistance from other ants. Once born, jack jumper ants can identify distinct tasks, an obvious primitive trait Myrmecia ants are known for.|$|E
5|$|Minka, Didi, and Stu {{arrive in}} the attic to find the group enthralled {{by the end of}} Boris' story: Moses, cornered, calls down the power of God to part the Red Sea, which the Hebrews are approaching. <b>They</b> <b>pass</b> <b>through</b> the parted waters, which then crash back {{together}} behind them, engulfing the Pharaoh and her army. With the story over, the family gets up to finish the Seder only to see the wind blow the door shut, locking them all in. Boris decides to tell them another story, which Chas at first thinks is about how the Hebrews wandered the desert for forty years before finally reaching the Promised Land. Boris explains that it's actually a story about how an aunt and uncle of his met at Passover Seder back in Russia.|$|E

5|$|Other seeds, such as apple pips and plum stones, have fleshy {{receptacles}} {{and smaller}} fruits like hawthorns have seeds enclosed in edible tissue; animals including mammals and birds eat the fruits and either discard the seeds, or swallow them so <b>they</b> <b>pass</b> <b>through</b> the gut to be {{deposited in the}} animal's droppings {{well away from the}} parent tree. The germination of some seeds is improved when they are processed in this way. Nuts may be gathered by animals such as squirrels that cache any not immediately consumed. Many of these caches are never revisited, the nut-casing softens with rain and frost, and the seed germinates in the spring. Pine cones may similarly be hoarded by red squirrels, and grizzly bears may help to disperse the seed by raiding squirrel caches.|$|E
5|$|The path {{originated}} as a {{route for}} the Coastguard to walk from lighthouse to lighthouse patrolling for smugglers. They {{needed to be}} able to look down into every bay and cove: as a result, the path closely hugs the coast providing excellent views but rarely the most direct path between two points. The South West Coast Path is no longer used by the Coastguard but it has been transformed from a practical defence system into a resource for recreational walkers. The path is covered by England's right-of-way laws, as amended by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000, which keep historic footpaths open to the public even when <b>they</b> <b>pass</b> <b>through</b> private property. Sections of the path are maintained by the National Trust, which owns parts of the coast.|$|E
5|$|Toll plazas {{are located}} along the South Bay Expressway at all {{northbound}} onramps and southbound offramps; {{there is also}} a mainline Otay Mesa Toll Plaza {{at the southern end of}} the facility just north of Otay Mesa Road. The toll road is equipped with the FasTrak electronic toll collection system, with drivers being charged a prorated toll based on the distance traveled. Those paying by cash or credit card are instead charged a more expensive flat rate depending on which toll booth <b>they</b> <b>pass</b> <b>through,</b> using a barrier toll system. For example, any cash- or credit-paying driver that passes through the Otay Mesa Toll Plaza ends up paying $3.50 regardless of the distance they actually traveled.|$|E
