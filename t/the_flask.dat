Revisions during the final painting included the enlargement of the Virgin's sleeves and the repositioning of Gabriel's staff. Incisions were made to indicate the floor tiles and the dove's position.|$|E
25|$|In {{the solid}} state the {{hydrogen}} is located {{closer to the}} oxygen {{so it could be}} considered to be right to call the colourless crystals in <b>the</b> <b>flask</b> 2-pyridone.|$|E
25|$|Pasteur {{performed}} {{several experiments}} to disprove spontaneous generation. He placed boiled liquid in a flask and let hot air enter <b>the</b> <b>flask.</b> Then he closed <b>the</b> <b>flask,</b> and no organisms grew in it. In another experiment, {{when he opened}} flasks containing boiled liquid, dust entered the flasks, causing organisms to grow in some of them. The number of flasks in which organisms grew was lower at higher altitudes, showing that air at high altitudes contained less dust and fewer organisms. Pasteur also used swan neck flasks containing a fermentable liquid. Air was allowed to enter <b>the</b> <b>flask</b> via a long curving tube that made dust particles stick to it. Nothing grew in the broths unless the flasks were tilted, making the liquid touch the contaminated walls of the neck. This showed that the living organisms that grew in such broths came from outside, on dust, rather than spontaneously generating within the liquid or from the action of pure air.|$|E
50|$|By {{flowing through}} the aspirator, water will suck out the air {{contained}} in <b>the</b> vacuum <b>flask</b> and <b>the</b> Büchner <b>flask.</b> There is therefore a difference in pressure between the exterior and the interior of <b>the</b> <b>flasks</b> : <b>the</b> contents of the Büchner funnel are sucked towards <b>the</b> vacuum <b>flask.</b> <b>The</b> filter, which is placed {{at the bottom of}} the Büchner funnel, separates the solids from the liquids.|$|R

50|$|The two {{ends of the}} cannula are {{connected}} similarly. <b>The</b> receiving <b>flask</b> is connected to its own gas bubbler, while <b>the</b> donating <b>flask</b> is connected to a source of inert gas. By increasing the inert gas pressure, the pressure within <b>the</b> donating <b>flask</b> is raised higher than <b>the</b> receiving <b>flask,</b> and <b>the</b> fluid is forced through the cannula.|$|R
25|$|The casting {{is allowed}} to cool and then dumped out of <b>the</b> <b>flask</b> (5) ready to use. The sand {{does not need to}} be {{reprocessed}} so it can be directly reused.|$|E
25|$|Finally, {{the molten}} metal (1) is {{poured into the}} mold, which vaporizes the foam (3) {{allowing}} the metal to fill the entire mold. The vapor is simultaneously extracted from <b>the</b> <b>flask</b> through the sand.|$|E
25|$|When HCl {{is mixed}} with metal sulfides in the sediment, a {{reaction}} occurs that generates H2S and liberates the metal ion into aqueous form, as shown in Equation 4. The gas formed by this process accumulates in the trap connected to <b>the</b> <b>flask.</b> By weighing the trap {{before and after the}} extraction process, the amount of H2S produced by the reaction can be calculated.|$|E
50|$|The teams {{begin this}} {{challenge}} {{working together to}} fasten the base on to a structure to stop it leaking. Once this is done water will flow up four pipes onto of the structure causing <b>the</b> <b>flasks</b> to float up. Each pipe has a series of holes that must be plugged; the corks provided however are very long and will physically prevent <b>the</b> <b>flasks</b> from rising.|$|R
30|$|Although R 7 {{growth on}} n-alkanes ranging in length from C 20 to C 36 was {{difficult}} to determine, due to the low solubility of solid n-alkanes in water, a certain growth was observed around the solid n-alkane agglomerates formed and {{on the wall of}} <b>the</b> <b>flasks.</b> Before <b>the</b> growth measurement, a strong agitation of <b>the</b> <b>flasks</b> was necessary to observe a homogeneous cells suspension (van Beilen et al., [2002]).|$|R
50|$|Increasing quality {{requirements}} made {{it necessary to}} increase the mold stability by applying steadily higher squeeze pressure and modern compaction methods for the sand in <b>the</b> <b>flasks.</b> In early fifties the high pressure molding was developed and applied in mechanical and later automatic <b>flask</b> lines. <b>The</b> first lines were using jolting and vibrations to pre-compact the sand in <b>the</b> <b>flasks</b> and compressed air powered pistons to compact the molds.|$|R
25|$|Since {{liquid ammonia}} {{has to be}} {{condensed}} into <b>the</b> <b>flask</b> and has to evaporate overnight after the reaction is complete, the whole procedure can be quite troublesome and time-consuming. However, alternative solvents have been employed, such as THF {{as well as a}} mixture of n-propylamine and ethylenediamine, both with comparable results. The latter one actually is a modification of the Benkeser reaction, which in its original forms tends to reduce naphthalene all the way to octahydro- and decahydronaphthalene.|$|E
25|$|When {{casting a}} {{reentrant}} angle, {{instead of using}} a core a cheek can be used. This is a third segment in <b>the</b> <b>flask,</b> {{in addition to the}} cope and drag. This allows the entire mold to be made from green sand and from removable patterns. The disadvantage of this is more mold-making operations are required, but it is usually advantageous when the quantities are low. However, if large quantities of casting are required, it is usually more cost effective to simply use a core.|$|E
25|$|Poirot gets himself {{invited to}} a party at Mrs Larkin's home where he meets Sheila's sister Pamela. Hawker arrives with Sheila in tow, having just come from a hunt, wanting to fill up his liquor flask. Sheila has heard {{from one of the}} house {{servants}} that Poirot visited her father the day before. He tells her of the threat she is under from her drug taking; as he leaves he hears Pam whisper to Sheila about <b>the</b> <b>flask.</b> Poirot sees the abandoned flask and finds it full of white powder.|$|E
40|$|The {{thing which}} makes <b>the</b> vacuum <b>flask</b> system useful is the vacuum {{between the two}} bottles. Producers of <b>the</b> vacuum <b>flask</b> {{try to create a}} perfect vacuum between the two bottles, but it is impossible. Little air goes inside, too. This {{situation}} creates my experiment and research question. There are many heat isolators so can there be any material that can be more successful in conserving the temperature of the liquid added than <b>the</b> vacuum <b>flask</b> system? To find an answer to my question, I chose 3 heat isolators (perlite, fire brick and silicone) and put them into <b>the</b> <b>flasks</b> instead of <b>the</b> vacuum. In order to investigate their performance and compare with <b>the</b> vacuum <b>flask</b> system, I planned four experiments. I added to <b>the</b> <b>flasks</b> different liquids, water at the different temperature and water at different amounts and measured the temperatures of the added liquids in different times. According to the results from these 4 experiments, I reach to a conclusion that these isolators couldn’t perform a better performance than vacuum in conserving the temperature of the liquid...|$|R

The solutions of <b>the</b> <b>flasks</b> were then filtered at predetermined time intervals (5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 120  min) and the concentration of the supernatant solution from each flask was then determined.|$|R
30|$|MES cells, {{originally}} {{derived from}} Joyner’s laboratory (Auerbach et al. 2000), were cultured on gelatin-coated flasks in standard ES cell medium with leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) according to Joyner AL without a feeder layer (Matise et al. 2000). Cells were seeded in culture flasks (Becton–Dickinson) and were maintained under 1 G for 18  h {{so that the}} cells could adhere to <b>the</b> <b>flasks.</b> Then <b>the</b> <b>flasks</b> were filled with fresh medium and the air bubbles were eliminated in order to diminish turbulence and shear forces. The 3 D-clinostat was placed in an incubator with an atmosphere of 95 % air/ 5 % CO 2 at 37  °C. The day on which <b>the</b> <b>flasks</b> {{were placed on the}} clinostat was designated as Day 0. We did not change the culture medium during the experimental period.|$|R
500|$|The three {{objects on}} the bedside cabinet {{represent}} the Virgin's purity: the water flask, the candleholder, and the ropewick light. [...] The light passing through {{the glass of the}} womb-shaped flask symbolizes her flesh, pierced by divine light, its clear and undisturbed water represents her purity at the moment of conception, a device also found in the earlier paintings as a metaphor of the Virgin's sanctity. <b>The</b> <b>flask</b> shows a reflection of the window's crossbar as a cross, a symbol of the Crucifixion, another small detail in which Memling [...] "lays one translucent symbolic form upon another".|$|E

Scully takes <b>the</b> <b>flask</b> to Georgetown University, where Dr. Anne Carpenter (Anne De Salvo) helps her analyze its contents. Meanwhile, Mulder heads to Berube's home and finds keys for a storage facility. Secare calls Berube's home office and Mulder answers, {{pretending to be}} Berube. Secare tells whom he believes to be Berube that he's been in the water for three days, and is hurt. Meanwhile, the Crew Cut Man eavesdrops on the conversation. Secare collapses due to blood loss before he can tell Mulder where he is. While he is driven away in an ambulance, a poisonous gas is emitted from Secare's body when the paramedics perform a needle decompression. Secare recovers and flees from the ambulance.|$|E
500|$|In [...] "Of Grave Importance", the {{audience}} is fully aware of Bobby's ghostly existence and the episode revolves around his own parallel investigation with the Winchesters of a haunted house. When Annie Hawkins, a hunter friend of the three, calls for assistance before being killed by the house's ghost, Bobby follows the Winchesters via <b>the</b> <b>flask</b> and discovers Annie dead with a myriad of other ghosts unable to move on from their place of death. Determined to get out information, Bobby learns to manipulate physical objects and points Dean and Sam in the right direction, and {{they are able to}} destroy the ghost haunting the house before the ghost could destroy Bobby. At the end of the episode, having accepted Bobby's return, Bobby is now fully visible to the Winchesters and explains to them how he chose to remain behind; a choice Dean finds hard to accept.|$|E

500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from September 3, 1910. It states: [...] "Jim, an expert chauffeur, is discharged from a garage, for insobriety. Penniless and being unable to obtain a new situation, he takes to the road, a common tramp. At one house where he applies for food, he is harshly refused, {{and is about to}} turn away and try his luck elsewhere, when little Marie, the daughter of the house, comes to his assistance and orders the butler to at once give him the food he requires. She also picks a rose for him from the garden. Jim strolls into a nearby park and sits on a bench to enjoy his lunch. He is about to take a drink from the ever-present flask, which he takes from his pocket, when the sight of the rose, which the sweet-faced little girl gave him, inspires him with a desire to reform. He throws <b>the</b> <b>flask</b> from him, and refreshed by the lunch, he starts out with a new ambition to face the world." ...|$|E
500|$|Irish-American actor Brian Donlevy {{was brought}} in by Robert L. Lippert to play the title role of Quatermass to provide an {{interest}} for American audiences. Donlevy, in his own words, specialised in [...] "he-men roles – rough, tough and realistic". Nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for Beau Geste (1939), he was also known for his appearances in The Great McGinty (1940) and The Glass Key (1942). At the time he appeared as Quatermass his career was in decline, however. Donlevy's no-nonsense portrayal of Quatermass {{is very different from}} that of Reginald Tate in the television version and was not to Nigel Kneale's liking, who said, [...] "I may have picked Quatermass's surname out of a phone book, but his first name was carefully chosen: Bernard, after Bernard Lovell, the creator of Jodrell Bank. Pioneer, ultimate questing man. Donlevy played him as a mechanic, a creature with a completely closed mind”. Responding to Kneale's criticisms, Val Guest said, [...] "Nigel Kneale was expecting to find Quatermass like he was on television, a sensitive British scientist, not some American stomping around, but to me Donlevy gave it absolute reality". By this stage in his career, Donlevy was suffering from alcoholism; it was some weeks into the shoot before Guest became aware that <b>the</b> <b>flask</b> of coffee he always carried on set was laced with brandy. Guest found, however, that [...] "Brian was all right, no problem at all once you kept him sober". He reprised the role of Quatermass in Quatermass 2 (1957) but was replaced by Andrew Keir in the third film, Quatermass and the Pit (1967).|$|E
2500|$|Here the thymocytes and {{epithelium}} {{meet and}} join with connective tissue. [...] The pharyngeal opening of each diverticulum is soon obliterated, but {{the neck of}} <b>the</b> <b>flask</b> persists for some time as a cellular cord.

[...] Additional portions of thymus tissue are sometimes developed from the fourth pharyngeal pouch.|$|E
50|$|Erlenmeyer flasks {{are also}} used in {{microbiology}} for the preparation of microbial cultures. Erlenmeyer flasks used in cell culture are sterilized and may feature vented closures to enhance gas exchange during incubation and shaking. The use of minimal liquid volumes, typically {{no more than one}} fifth of <b>the</b> total <b>flask</b> volume, and baffles molded into <b>the</b> <b>flask's</b> internal surface both serve to maximize gas transfer and promote chaotic mixing when <b>the</b> <b>flasks</b> are orbitally shaken. The oxygen transfer rate in Erlenmeyer <b>flasks</b> depends on <b>the</b> agitation speed, the liquid volume, and the shake-flask design. The shaking frequency has the most significant impact on oxygen transfer.|$|R

50|$|A {{vacuum flask}} (also {{known as a}} Dewar flask, Dewar bottle or thermos) is an {{insulating}} storage vessel that greatly lengthens the time over which its contents remain hotter or cooler than <b>the</b> <b>flask's</b> surroundings.
