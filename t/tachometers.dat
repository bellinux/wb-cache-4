2500|$|The {{standard}} machine gun of the Austro-Hungarian {{armed forces in}} 1914 was the Schwarzlose gun, which operated on a [...] "delayed blow back" [...] system and was not ideally suited to synchronization. Unlike the French and Italians, who were eventually able to acquire supplies of Vickers guns, the Austrians were unable to obtain sufficient quantities of [...] "Spandaus" [...] from their German allies and were forced to use the Schwarzlose in an application {{for which it was}} not really suited. Although the problem of synchronizing the Schwarzlose was eventually partially solved, it was not until late 1916 that gears were available. Even then, at high engine revolutions Austrian synchronizer gears tended to behave very erratically. Austrian fighters were fitted with large <b>tachometers</b> to ensure that a pilot could check that his [...] "revs" [...] were within the required range before firing his guns, and propeller blades were fitted with an electrical warning system that alerted a pilot if his propeller was being hit. There were never enough gears available, due to a chronic shortage of precision tools; so that production fighters, even the excellent Austrian versions of the Albatros D.III, often had to be sent to the front in an unarmed state, for squadron armourers to fit such guns and gears as could be scrounged, salvaged or improvised.|$|E
2500|$|The 1975 {{model was}} advertised as [...] "a more {{efficient}} Corvette," [...] as service intervals were extended and electronic ignition and the federally mandated catalytic converter were introduced with [...] "unleaded fuel only" [...] warnings on the fuel gauge and filler door. Dual exhaust pipes were routed {{to a single}} converter, then split again leading to dual mufflers and tailpipes. Starting this year, <b>tachometers</b> were electronically driven. The Corvette began {{to be influenced by}} the metric system as speedometers now displayed small subfaces indicating kilometers-per-hour. 75's featured revised inner bumper systems with molded front and rear simulated bumper guards. The urethane rear bumper, now in its second year, reappeared as a one-piece seamless unit. This was the final year for Astro Ventilation. Power bottomed out this year — the base engine produced only [...] and the only remaining optional motor, the L-82, dropped an astonishing , managing to deliver [...] With no larger engine available, L-82 hood emblems began to appear on cars so equipped. Unchanged was the standard rear axle ratio for the base engine, which remained at 3.08 with automatic and 3.36 with manual transmission. This was the last convertible for the 1968-82 third-generation and only 12% of the cars were ordered as such. As in previous years, a folding top came standard with roadsters and a body color or vinyl covered hardtop was optional at additional cost. Anticipating further federal safety restrictions, Chevrolet believed it would be Corvette's last soft-top model ever but the convertible returned in 1986. Due to the state’s strict emissions standards, this was the last year Chevrolet installed the L-82 engine in a Corvette destined for California.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} an accurate <b>tachometer</b> model {{that takes into}} account the effect of magnetic coupling in a DC motor-tachometer assembly. Magnetic coupling arises due to the presence of mutual inductance between the <b>tachometer</b> winding and the motor winding (a weak transformer effect). <b>Tachometer</b> feedback is widely used for servo-control of DC motors, which can suffer from closed-loop instability due to the presence of compliant components in the drive system. It is essential to have an accurate sensor model to predict and address these resonance related problems. The inadequacy of the conventional <b>tachometer</b> model, which treats the DC <b>tachometer</b> as a ‘gain’, is pointed out. The exact <b>tachometer</b> model identified in this paper is incorporated in the modeling of a system that has multiple flexible elements, and is used for parameter identification and feedback motion cont rol. The effect of the <b>tachometer</b> dynamics on controller design is discussed in terms of system poles and zeros. 1...|$|R

In many countries, tractors are required to have a speedometer for use on a road. To save fitting a second dial, the vehicle's tachometer is often marked with a second scale in units of speed. This scale is only accurate in a certain gear, but since many tractors only have one gear that is practical for use on-road, this is sufficient. Tractors with multiple 'road gears' often have <b>tachometers</b> {{with more than one}} speed scale.

5000|$|<b>Tachometers</b> or {{revolution}} counters on cars, aircraft, and other vehicles show {{the rate of}} rotation of the engine's crankshaft, and typically have markings indicating a safe range of rotation speeds. This can assist the driver in selecting appropriate throttle and gear settings for the driving conditions. Prolonged use at high speeds may cause inadequate lubrication, overheating (exceeding capability of the cooling system), exceeding speed capability of sub-parts of the engine (for example spring retracted valves) thus causing excessive wear or permanent damage or failure of engines. This is more applicable to manual transmissions than to automatics. On analogue <b>tachometers,</b> speeds above maximum safe operating speed are typically indicated by {{an area of the}} gauge marked in red, giving rise to the expression of [...] "redlining" [...] an engine — revving the engine up to the maximum safe limit. The red zone is superfluous on most modern cars, since their engines typically have a revolution limiter which electronically limits engine speed to prevent damage. Diesel engines with traditional mechanical injector systems have an integral governor which prevents over-speeding the engine, so the <b>tachometers</b> in vehicles and machinery fitted with such engines sometimes lack a redline.|$|E
