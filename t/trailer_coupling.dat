50|$|Production of the 3-wheeled Mechanical Horse {{commenced}} in 1934. The design {{had been}} refined in 1933 by Oliver Danson North, who modified the original prototype. This featured automatic <b>trailer</b> <b>coupling</b> {{and the single}} front wheel could be steered through 360 degrees. This was a very simple and sturdy vehicle which was constructed on a steel channel frame and fitted with a wooden cab, the early versions having canvas doors. The Mechanical Horse came in two sizes, capable of carrying loads of three tons and six tons, {{each of the two}} sizes had a corresponding coupling size, which became known as the 3-ton and the 6-ton coupling. The tractor units were powered by Scammell's own side valve petrol engine of 1125cc in the 3 ton version and 2043cc in the larger 6 tonner. The engine was offset {{to the left of the}} cab, which could cause stability problems in some circumstances. The vehicles had manoeuvrability which was unmatched; it was possible to turn through 360 degrees in under 20 feet with a 16-foot trailer. The road speed of about 20 mph suited the vehicle to local deliveries, and fuel consumption of 10 to 20 mpg was acceptable. Railway companies were the primary customers for the Mechanical Horse, but they were also used by a number of private companies, particularly breweries, who valued the nimble little lorries. The British armed forces used them in stores and on aircraft carriers. The 6-ton coupling equipment was also fitted to popular makes of lorry such as Bedford, Thornycroft and Austin. Bedford tractor units so equipped were sold under the Bedford-Scammell brand. Such was the popularity and success of the Mechanical Horse that there was a separate sales department using dealers for this unique machine. During the difficult trading years of the 1930s the threewheeler was the saviour of Scammell Lorries Ltd.|$|E
40|$|A loading {{standard}} called CARLOS TC BC (CAR LOading Standard for <b>Trailer</b> <b>Coupling</b> devices with Bike Carriers) {{is derived}} with focus on <b>trailer</b> <b>coupling</b> devices during bike carrier service. Based {{on this new}} standard a comparison with available loading standards for <b>trailer</b> <b>coupling</b> devices is performed and an optimized design of a <b>trailer</b> <b>coupling</b> device is proposed. The derived loading standard is based on results of a public opinion poll in 2005 with 1200 <b>trailer</b> <b>coupling</b> device users. Furthermore service load measurements at <b>trailer</b> <b>coupling</b> devices on proving grounds and public roads are used to derive the loading standard. The scatter bands caused by the track mixture (T), the way of driving (F) and the loading conditions (B) {{are taken into account}} to carry out the standardization process. Comparisons between loading standards CARLOS TC BC, CARLOS TC and 94 / 20 /EC are performed. The regulation 94 / 20 /EC covers fictitious damage sums of CARLOS TC BC and CARLOS TC for large sections of the <b>trailer</b> <b>coupling</b> device. However the regulation 94 / 20 /EC does not lead to service load oriented stresses and strains, so that it is not used within the derivation of an optimized <b>trailer</b> <b>coupling</b> device...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Even for {{experienced}} drivers {{handling a}} roll trailer with a passenger {{car is a}} difficult and often tedious task. Moreover, the driver needs {{to keep track of}} the trailer’s driving stability on unsteady roads. There are driver assistance systems that can simplify trajectory planning and observe the oscillation amplitude, but they require additional hardware. In this paper, we present a method for trailer detection and articulation angle measurement based on video data from a rear end wide-angle camera. It consists of two stages: to decide whether or not a <b>trailer</b> is <b>coupled</b> to the vehicle and to estimate its articulation angle. These calculations work on single video frames. The vehicle is therefore not required to be in motion. However, we stabilize the single frame estimations by temporal integration. We perform training and parameter optimization and eval-uate the accuracy of our approach by comparing the results to those of an articulation measurement unit attached to a test vehicle’s hitch. Results show that it can very reliably be determined whether or not a <b>trailer</b> is <b>coupled</b> to the vehicle. Furthermore, its articulation can be estimated with a mean error of less than two degrees. I...|$|R

50|$|The train {{consisted}} of three motor cars and two trailer cars. The motor cars were about twice as heavy as the trailer cars, and the trailers were significantly more top-heavy, especially with a passenger load. Standard procedure was to never <b>couple</b> two <b>trailer</b> cars together, but to always have a single trailer between two motor cars. The heavier motor cars provided stability for the lighter trailers. In the Malbone Street wreck train, two <b>trailers</b> were <b>coupled</b> together, and it was these two cars, in order numbers 80 and 100, that sustained {{the bulk of the}} damage, both to the cars and to the passengers.|$|R
50|$|Expeditions {{were offered}} with an {{adaptive}} pneumatic air-ride suspension system with self leveling, payload leveling and trailer load leveling capability from 1997 to 2013.

These were either new; rebuilt from steam stock inherited from the LSWR, the London Brighton and South Coast Railway (LBSCR) and the South Eastern and Chatham Railway; or rebuilt from LBSCR AC multiple units. Some rebuilt units has ‘torpedo style’ front ends, others had the newer, flatter, front ends used on the main-line stock introduced during the early 1930s. They were designated ‘3-Car Suburban Sets’ to differentiate them from main-line units, and were numbered between 1201 and 1800.

50|$|When using a dolly, which {{generally}} {{has to be}} equipped with lights and a license plate, rigid trucks {{can be used to}} pull semi-trailers. The dolly is equipped with a fifth wheel to which the <b>trailer</b> is <b>coupled.</b> Because the dolly attaches to a pintle hitch on the truck, maneuvering a trailer hooked to a dolly is different from maneuvering a fifth wheel trailer. Backing the vehicle requires same technique as backing an ordinary truck/full trailer combination, though the dolly/semi setup is probably longer, thus requiring more space for maneuvering. The tractor/semi-trailer configuration is rarely used on timber trucks, since these will use the two big advantages of having the weight of the load on the drive wheels, and the loader crane used to lift the logs from the ground can be mounted on the rear of the truck behind the load, allowing a short (lightweight) crane to reach both ends of the vehicle without uncoupling. Also construction trucks are more often seen in a rigid + midaxle trailer configuration instead of the tractor/semi-trailer setup.|$|R
50|$|The {{parking brake}} of the tractor unit and the {{emergency}} brake {{of the trailer}} are spring brakes that require air pressure {{in order to be}} released. They are applied when air pressure is released from the system, and disengaged when air pressure is supplied. This is a fail-safe design feature which ensures that if air pressure to either unit is lost, the vehicle will stop to a grinding halt, instead of continuing without brakes and becoming uncontrollable. The <b>trailer</b> controls are <b>coupled</b> to the tractor through two gladhand connectors, which provide air pressure, and an electrical cable, which provides power to the lights and any specialized features of the trailer.|$|R
