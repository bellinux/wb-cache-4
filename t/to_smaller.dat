5|$|According to the nebular hypothesis, stars form {{in massive}} and dense clouds of {{molecular}} hydrogen—giant molecular clouds (GMC). These clouds are gravitationally unstable, and matter coalesces within them <b>to</b> <b>smaller</b> denser clumps, which then rotate, collapse, and form stars. Star formation {{is a complex}} process, which always produces a gaseous protoplanetary disk, proplyd, around the young star. This may give birth to planets in certain circumstances, which are not well known. Thus the formation of planetary systems {{is thought to be}} a natural result of star formation. A Sun-like star usually takes approximately 1million years to form, with the protoplanetary disk evolving into a planetary system over the next10–100 million years.|$|E
5|$|Anthropogenic ecology {{refers to}} the human impact on animals and plants in an ecosystem. A shift from medium and large game animals, such as deer, bighorn sheep, and antelope, <b>to</b> <b>smaller</b> ones like rabbits and turkey during the mid-10th to mid-13th centuries might {{indicate}} that Mesa Verdean subsistence hunting had dramatically altered faunal populations on the mesa. Analysis of pack rat midden indicates that, {{with the exception of}} invasive species such as tumbleweed and clover, the flora and fauna in the area have remained relatively consistent for the past 4,000 years.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} lending by <b>small</b> banks <b>to</b> <b>small</b> farms. We find that relationships, as {{measured}} by the length of tenure of farm operators, are positively related to bank lending. We also find that denovo banks have a positive tendency <b>to</b> lend <b>to</b> <b>small</b> farms, similar <b>to</b> the tendency of denovo banks <b>to</b> lend <b>to</b> <b>small</b> businesses generally. When existing relationships between borrowers and incumbent lenders are stronger, however, denovo banks have greater difficulties in lending <b>to</b> <b>small</b> farms. Finally, we find that, even within the category of <b>small</b> banks, lending <b>to</b> <b>small</b> farms (as a percentage of a bank's assets) tends to decrease as the bank increases in size. We believe that small farms are a category of small enterprises that have been underresearched in the lending literature and that further study of these relationships would yield new and interesting results. ...|$|R

5|$|Because {{of their}} great size, supertankers often cannot enter port fully loaded. These ships {{can take on}} their cargo at {{off-shore}} platforms and single-point moorings. On {{the other end of}} the journey, they often pump their cargo off <b>to</b> <b>smaller</b> tankers at designated lightering points off-coast. A supertanker's routes are generally long, requiring it to stay at sea for extended periods, up to and beyond seventy days at a time.|$|E

5|$|During the mid 1990s, Ramiz Sadiku was docked {{for a major}} {{overhaul}} and reconstruction. However, {{due to the lack}} of funds the work was never completed and the boat was decommissioned and eventually sold for scrap. The boat's superstructure, propulsion, sensors and weapon systems were dismantled, after which the new owner moved the boat to an underground naval dock on the Luštica peninsula. The boat remained there for several years, before its deteriorating condition caused it to sink inside the dock. The wreck was raised in 2014 and towed to Zelenika where it was broken up <b>to</b> <b>smaller</b> segments which were then transported to the Nikšić steel factory.|$|E
5|$|In 2008 the Center for Nanostructure Characterization at the Georgia Institute of Technology {{reported}} {{producing an}} electricity generating device (called flexible charge pump generator) delivering alternating current by stretching and releasing zinc oxide nanowires.

30|$|This {{negative}} cross-country {{association between}} productivity and {{the share of}} employment allocated <b>to</b> <b>small</b> plants {{is consistent with previous}} works. There is a large literature that shows that low income countries tend to allocate more employment <b>to</b> <b>small</b> production units, see Tybout (2000). Using recent data, Poschke (2014) documents a positive correlation between firms’ average employment and per capita GDP, a fact that is also present in our data. 15 Given the strong positive cross-country association between income per capita and productivity, it is then expected productivity and the share of employment allocated <b>to</b> <b>small</b> plants <b>to</b> be negatively correlated. In the next section, we emphasize that economic distortions can significantly explain why some countries allocate more resources <b>to</b> <b>small</b> plants.|$|R

5|$|Like other parrots, {{cockatoos}} can be {{afflicted by}} psittacine beak and feather disease (PBFD). The viral infection causes feather loss and beak malformation {{and reduces the}} bird's overall immunity. Particularly prevalent in sulphur-crested cockatoos, little corellas and galahs, it has been recorded in 14 species of cockatoo to date. Although unlikely to significantly impact on large, healthy populations of birds in the wild, PBFD may pose a high risk <b>to</b> <b>smaller</b> stressed populations.|$|E

5|$|The {{cause of}} the war stems from the {{increasing}} numbers of English colonists and their demand for land. As more land was purchased from the Native Americans, they were restricted <b>to</b> <b>smaller</b> territories for themselves. Native American leaders such as King Philip resented the loss of land and looked for a means to slow or reverse it. Of specific concern was {{the founding of the}} town of Swansea, which was located only {{a few miles from the}} Wampanoag capital at Mount Hope. The General Court of Plymouth began using military force to coerce the sale of Wampanoag land to the settlers of the town.|$|E
5|$|The first {{confirmed}} {{discovery of}} an extrasolar planet orbiting an ordinary main-sequence star occurred on 6 October 1995, when Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz of the University of Geneva announced {{the detection of}} an exoplanet around 51 Pegasi.

5|$|The {{most common}} set of catabolic {{reactions}} in animals can be separated into three main stages. In the first stage, large organic molecules, such as proteins, polysaccharides or lipids, are digested into their smaller components outside cells. Next, these smaller molecules are taken up by cells and converted <b>to</b> <b>smaller</b> molecules, usually acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA), which releases some energy. Finally, the acetyl group on the CoA is oxidised to water and {{carbon dioxide in the}} citric acid cycle and electron transport chain, releasing the energy that is stored by reducing the coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) into NADH.|$|E
40|$|In this study, we use firm-level {{data from}} the 1993 National Survey of <b>Small</b> Business Finances <b>to</b> test the {{hypothesis}} that banking consolidation has reduced the availability of credit <b>to</b> <b>small</b> businesses. We find that banks in markets where mergers have occurred {{are more likely than}} other banks to deny credit <b>to</b> <b>small</b> business loan applicants. However, this relationship disappears after we control for characteristics of the small business firm and its principal owner, the economic environment of the market where the firm is located, and the financial condition of the prospective lender. Moreover, we find that one set of banks, those in the process of acquiring other banks, are less likely to deny credit <b>to</b> <b>small</b> businesses. These results suggest that consolidation in the banking industry may have enhanced rather than restricted the availability of credit <b>to</b> <b>small</b> businesses. However, the data reflect credit availability during 1991 - 94, and may not be representative of subsequent credit conditions. Nor does the analysis rule out possible changes in the terms of credit available <b>to</b> <b>small</b> businesses. ...|$|R
