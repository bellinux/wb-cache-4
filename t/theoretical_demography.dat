5000|$|Dr. Romaniuk {{has written}} {{extensively}} {{in the areas of}} substantive, methodological and <b>theoretical</b> <b>demography</b> as well as in political demography. His work has made significant contributions to the literature on human population, fertility in Africa, particularly in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the demography of Canada’s Aboriginal peoples. He {{is best known for his}} studies of human sterility in what was known as the “sterility belt” in central Africa ...|$|E
50|$|In {{the realm}} of <b>theoretical</b> <b>demography,</b> some of his work has helped to expand the {{literature}} on the theory of demographic transition in connection with the dynamics of fertility changes during the early stages of societal modernization as well as in connection with the emergence of a post-transitional demographic regime, what he calls the regime of demographic maturity. He has also contributed to the epistemology of forecasting. With regard to population policies, he advocates for a stationary population.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The work {{is devoted}} to the {{development}} of methods of a <b>theoretical</b> <b>demography</b> being a missing link between the biology and the mathematical history. The <b>theoretical</b> <b>demography</b> allows to consider the evolution of human beings as a species, the whole historical process and specific historical events from the uniform point of view. The explanation of the quadratic dependence of the population growth rate on the population size during almost all the human history and of the stabilization of the population size at the demographic transition is given. Based on the introduced conception of life-saving technologies model of the global demographic process is created and theoretical estimates for all its parameters are obtained. Semi-heuristic model of the demographic transition is also proposed and some its characteristics are found. Note: Publication language:russia...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{contributes to}} the <b>theoretical</b> foundation of <b>demography</b> by developing a framework of concepts and causal mechanisms that are required to attain a comprehensive understanding of demographic phenomena and demographic change, especially to the conceptually tools {{for the design of}} effective reproductive health programs. It develops a comprehensive framework for fertility behaviour and includes a case study in which the model is applied to family planning and reproductive health in India. Bron:DutchESS...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the {{demographic}} development in the southeast region of France called Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur. The demographic development is focusing on the period from 2004 to 2014. The thesis deals with demographic structure of the region, demographic processes such as death rate, birth rate, nuptality and divorce rate. The <b>theoretical</b> part describes <b>demography</b> as a science, explains demographical sources and more characterised demographical processes. The practical part analyzes demographic events and compares them with metropolitan France. Finally it predicts indicators till 2016 using method of equalization of time series and the trend line...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The world {{population}} growth is considered. Based {{on the concept of}} life-saving technologies we explain the squared relationship of the growth rate on the population. We derive a master equation of the <b>theoretical</b> <b>demography</b> determining the balance between the level of life-saving technologies and the number of people. Mechanisms of this equation stabilization in fast time, especially a crisis emerging under demographic overheating, are considered. The demographic transition results from life-saving technologies verging towards their natural limit. In this connection the intensive technological development come in the stead to the extensive one. Such approach allows constructing a phenomenological model of the demographic transition being in a good agreement with the demographic data. Note: Publication language:russia...|$|E
40|$|S. P. Kapitza {{achievements}} in <b>theoretical</b> <b>demography</b> are analysed, especially {{his idea of}} global demographic transition as final superfast hyperbolic growth of the world population. Heuristic paradoxes of Kapitza theoretical constructions are discussed and variants of possible solutions are considered. Surviving rural population of predominantly poor countries and urban population of predominantly developed countries are proposed as initial and final phases of the demographic phase transition respectively. Territorial units with a characteristic radius of the circle equal area of 20 - 30 km are considered as local populations which are actual subjects of hyperbolic growth of humanity. Worldwide depopulation which begins immediately {{upon completion of the}} demographic transition is suggested as a working hypothesis...|$|E
40|$|Every advance {{carries with}} it {{potential}} problems, and longitudinal analysis is no exception. This paper focuses on the problems related to the massive amounts of data generated by longitudinal surveys. It is argued that a proliferation of data may be to the good {{but it will not}} necessarily lead to better scientific knowledge. Most demographers think the logical positivist way that theory arises out of empirical generalisations, but massive empirical investigations have only led to disappointing <b>theoretical</b> outcomes in <b>demography.</b> This paper discusses one way out of this impasse - to adopt a different view of theory, a model-based view of science. Theoretical models based on empirical generalisation should become the main representational device in science...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} the work experiences of men, a traditional workplace majority, as minority members of a female-dominated occupation. We used tokenism and social categorization theories to propose and test a set of hypotheses that link token status (a less than 15 % minority) with male flight attendants' work attitudes through intervening psychological and job factors. Survey data from a sample of 236 male and female flight attendants supported a model in which a negative relationship between token status and the work attitudes of job satisfaction and organizational attachment was mediated by low self-esteem, increased role ambiguity, and poor job fit. The uncovering of these previously unmeasured intervening variables strengthens <b>theoretical</b> connections between <b>demography</b> and work outcomes and suggests leverage points for improving the work attitudes of individuals in the minority...|$|R
40|$|The {{thesis is}} focused on {{municipal}} waste characterization, sampling and analysis. It presents the methodology, techniques, and practice of sampling {{and analysis of the}} mixed municipal waste in a selected area of Novo mesto and its surroundings. The first part of the thesis contains the <b>theoretical</b> background with <b>demography</b> and waste statistics from the selected area. Legislation of the characterization of mixed municipal waste focused on sorting analysis in European Union and the Republic of Slovenia is presented. The thesis also presents the sustainable development of the Republic of Slovenia in the field of waste treatment, which should comply with the European union criteria. The second part presents experimental work where the results of sorting analysis are shown and discussed. Also, the comparisons of individual fractions of municipal waste with emphasis on the biodegradable fraction are presented. Measures for reduction of the mixed municipal waste and biodegradable waste in landfills are proposed, with specific examples of successful good practices in some other countries...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{work has}} {{proposed}} that computational modelling of social systems {{is composed of}} two primary streams of research: systems sociology, which {{is focused on the}} generation of social theory; and social simulation, which focuses on the study of real-world social systems. Here we argue that the social simulation stream stands to benefit from recent methodological and <b>theoretical</b> advances in <b>demography.</b> Demography has long been an empirically focused discipline focused primarily on mathematical modelling; however, agentbased simulation have proven influential of late as demographers seek to link individual-level behaviours to macro-level patterns. Here we characterise this shift as a move toward system-based modelling, a paradigm in which the scientific object of interest is neither the individual nor the population, but rather the interactions between them. We first describe the four successive paradigms of demography: the period, cohort, event-history and multilevel perspectives. Then we examine how system-based modelling can assist demographers with several major challenges: overcoming complexity in social research; reducing uncertainty; and enhancing theoretical foundations. We propose that this new paradigm can enhance the broader study of populations via social simulation...|$|R
