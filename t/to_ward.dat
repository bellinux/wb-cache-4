5|$|Birds {{sometimes}} use plumage {{to assess}} and assert social dominance, to display breeding condition in sexually selected species, or to make threatening displays, as in the sunbittern's mimicry of a large predator <b>to</b> <b>ward</b> off hawks and protect young chicks. Variation in plumage also allows for the identification of birds, particularly between species.|$|E
5|$|Defensive {{structures}} such as spines may be {{used both}} <b>to</b> <b>ward</b> off attack as already mentioned, and if need be to fight back against a predator. Methods of fighting back include chemical defences, mobbing, defensive regurgitation, and suicidal altruism.|$|E
5|$|Inari's kitsune are white, a {{color of}} good omen. They possess the power <b>to</b> <b>ward</b> off evil, and they {{sometimes}} serve as guardian spirits. In addition to protecting Inari shrines, they are petitioned to intervene {{on behalf of}} the locals and particularly to aid against troublesome nogitsune, those spirit foxes who do not serve Inari. Black foxes and nine-tailed foxes are likewise considered good omens.|$|E

5|$|Like many ancient {{medicinal}} plants (Pliny the Elder describes {{it in his}} Naturalis Historia), great mullein was linked to witches, although the relationship remained generally ambiguous, and the plant was also widely held <b>to</b> <b>ward</b> off curses and evil spirits. The seeds contain several compounds (saponins, glycosides, coumarin, rotenone) that are toxic to fish, and {{have been widely used}} as piscicide for fishing.|$|E
5|$|Some caterpillars, {{especially}} {{members of}} Papilionidae, contain an osmeterium, a Y-shaped protrusible gland {{found in the}} prothoracic segment of the larvae. When threatened, the caterpillar emits unpleasant smells from the organ <b>to</b> <b>ward</b> off the predators.|$|E

5|$|A meter {{in length}} canes, dated between 1850 and 1920, {{are used to}} make an entry into a village or in dance ceremonies. The canes were fired to give black patina over the {{engraved}} parts; the engraving designs consist of geometrical real images from the pilou dance, agricultural motifs and village scenes of fishing or building a Grand Hut or case. These were also stuffed with magic herbs <b>to</b> <b>ward</b> off evil spirits.|$|E
5|$|Although not {{traditionally}} {{regarded as}} an apotropaic, mirrors have been used <b>to</b> <b>ward</b> off vampires when placed, facing outwards, on a door (in some cultures, vampires {{do not have a}} reflection and sometimes do not cast a shadow, perhaps as a manifestation of the vampire's lack of a soul). This attribute is not universal (the Greek vrykolakas/tympanios was capable of both reflection and shadow), but was used by Bram Stoker in Dracula and has remained popular with subsequent authors and filmmakers.|$|E
5|$|Although {{sometimes}} {{regarded as}} foreign elements in Roman culture, {{music and dance}} had existed in Rome from earliest times. Music was customary at funerals, and the tibia (Greek aulos), a woodwind instrument, was played at sacrifices <b>to</b> <b>ward</b> off ill influences. Song (carmen) {{was an integral part}} of almost every social occasion. The Secular Ode of Horace, commissioned by Augustus, was performed publicly in 17 BC by a mixed children's choir. Music was thought to reflect the orderliness of the cosmos, and was associated particularly with mathematics and knowledge.|$|E

5|$|Apotropaics—items able <b>to</b> <b>ward</b> off revenants—are {{common in}} vampire folklore. Garlic {{is a common}} example, a branch of wild rose and {{hawthorn}} plant are said to harm vampires, and in Europe, sprinkling mustard seeds {{on the roof of}} a house was said to keep them away. Other apotropaics include sacred items, for example a crucifix, rosary, or holy water. Vampires are said to be unable to walk on consecrated ground, such as that of churches or temples, or cross running water.|$|E
5|$|City at the End of Time is a 2008 {{science fiction}} novel by American writer Greg Bear. It was {{published}} in August 2008 by Del Rey in the United States, and Gollancz in the United Kingdom.

Ludovico Maria Sinistrari, a Catholic priest who wrote about methods of {{exorcism}} in the late 17th century, includes cubeb as an ingredient in an incense <b>to</b> <b>ward</b> off incubus.

5|$|During the American Civil War, {{in which}} Texas seceded from the United States, the area served a limited {{role in the}} {{conflict}} though no major battles were fought on the mainland shoreline. New fortifications, like Fort Chambers near Anahuac, were constructed <b>to</b> <b>ward</b> off a mainland invasion by Union forces and to protect supply routes to and from Galveston. The GH Railroad {{was used in the}} recapture of Galveston by Confederate forces in 1863. Makeshift hospitals, such as the Nolan home in Dickinson, were established in the bayside communities.|$|E
5|$|Fairly {{inactive}} in nature, the Japanese sleeper ray {{spends much}} of its time lying buried on the sea floor. It can produce an electric shock of 30–80 volts <b>to</b> <b>ward</b> off predators, which include the blotchy swell shark (Cephaloscyllium umbratile). Its electric organs are composed of electrocytes, which are specialized cells derived from muscle fibers that are filled with a jelly-like substance. These electrocytes are stacked in vertical columns, with many columns making up each electric organ; this arrangement functions essentially like batteries connected in parallel. The diet of the Japanese sleeper ray includes benthic invertebrates. A parasite of this species is the tapeworm Anteropora japonica (Yamaguti, 1934) Subhapradha, 1955.|$|E

5|$|Female vampire-like monsters are the Soucouyant of Trinidad, and the Tunda and Patasola of Colombian folklore, {{while the}} Mapuche of {{southern}} Chile have the bloodsucking snake {{known as the}} Peuchen. Aloe vera hung backwards behind or near a door was thought <b>to</b> <b>ward</b> off vampiric beings in South American superstition. Aztec mythology described tales of the Cihuateteo, skeletal-faced spirits {{of those who died}} in childbirth who stole children and entered into sexual liaisons with the living, driving them mad.|$|E
5|$|From an {{ecological}} perspective, raptor populations {{in urban areas}} are highly beneficial. Compared with Europe where pigeon populations have exploded to the point they are both a tourist attraction and a public nuisance. Their faeces are highly acidic causing damage to historic buildings and statues made of soft stone. They nest in bridges where it compiles and damages iron work causing rust and corrosion. In the United States, falcon and other raptors are in numbers high enough <b>to</b> <b>ward</b> off pigeon nest building in major highrises.|$|E
5|$|Herodotus, {{the ancient}} Greek historian, {{documented}} women carrying large phallic shaped monuments and ornaments {{the size of}} a human body in villages in ancient Dionysia. On the island of Delos a pillar supports a colossal phallus, the symbol of Dionysus. Phallus reliefs on buildings on such sites are also believed to have been apotropaic devices <b>to</b> <b>ward</b> off evil. The elaborate use of phallic architecture and sculpture in ancient Greek society can also be seen in sites such as Nea Nikomedeia in northern Greece. Archaeologists excavating the ancient town discovered clay sculptures of plump women with phallic heads and folded arms.|$|E
