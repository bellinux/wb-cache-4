Zeolite, an inorganic ion-exchanger, {{may be used}} as a suitable technical-economical solution for water treatment in many regions of Iran. In this study, the characterization of natural zeolite natrolite and the feasibility of removing hardness, cations, and anions were investigated. Methods: First, zeolite composition and type were determined using X-ray Fluorescence (XRF), thermal analysis, and infrared spectrometer. Also, cation exchange capacity (CEC) and its impact on water hardness reduction evaluated. Then, isotherm curves for Fe, Cr, Al, Bi, Cd, Mn, Ca, Mg, Ag, Ni, Zn, Cu, Pb, and their disposition to zeolite phase besides removal rate of the mentioned cations in analyzed water samples identified.

The Piper trilinear diagram {{can be used to}} illustrate the similarities and differences in the composition of waters and to classify them into certain chemical types, while Chadha’s plot can demonstrate the hydrochemical processes like recharging, reverse ion exchange, seawater mixing and base ion exchange chiefly acting in an aquifer. In the present study, piper trilinear diagram classified 93.48  % of the samples under Ca 2 +–Mg 2 +–Cl−–SO 4 2 − type indicating the permanent hardness and remaining 6.52  % samples under Ca 2 +–Mg 2 +–HCO 3 − type demonstrating <b>temporary</b> <b>hardness.</b> The piper plots further confirmed the existence of mixed type of water with no one cation–anion pair exceeding 50  % in majority of the analyzed samples. Chadha’s plot also demonstrated the dominance of reverse ion exchange water having permanent hardness (viz., Ca–Mg–Cl type) in majority of the samples over recharging water with <b>temporary</b> <b>hardness</b> (i.e., Ca–Mg–HCO 3 type). It is therefore evident that primary salinity and secondary alkalinity were dominant in majority of samples as indicated by permanent (non-carbonate) hardness. In contrast, secondary salinity and primary alkalinity were limited to only few samples as specified by temporary (carbonate) hardness. No typical seawater mixing or base ion exchange was observed in the study area as none of the samples belong to Na–Cl and Na–HCO 3 water types. Both the plots highlighted the contribution from the reverse ion-exchange processes besides the dominance of alkaline earth metals (Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +) over the alkalis (Na+, K+), and strong acidic anions (Cl−, SO 4 2 −) over the weak acidic anions (CO 3 2 −, HCO 3 −) in the study area. Further, PCA analysis established that water quality parameters under PC 1 and PC 2 (viz., 65.55 and 10.17  % of total variance) having strong loading (> 0.75) was considered to govern the groundwater quality in the study area. While water quality parameters under PC 3 and PC 4 though exhibited strong and positive loading by one parameter each, were considered insignificant due to a lesser percentage of variance (i.e., 6.88 and 6.52  %). Overall the groundwater quality was suitable for drinking and domestic purposes and permissible for irrigation activities.|$|E

The result of piper trillinear and Chadha’s diagram classified majority of surface water samples for both seasons fall in the fields of Ca 2 +–Mg 2 +–HCO 3 − water type indicating <b>temporary</b> <b>hardness.</b> PCA and CA reveal that the surface water chemistry is influenced by natural factors such as weathering of minerals, ion exchange processes and anthropogenic factors. Thus, the present paper illustrates the importance of multivariate techniques for reliable quality characterization of surface water quality to develop effective pollution reduction strategies and maintain a fine balance between the industrialization and ecological integrity.|$|E
40|$|The {{supply of}} {{drinking}} water in Gundlupet town (Lat. 11 ° 47 ' 55 ' to 11 ° 48 ' 30 'N and Lon. 76 ° 41 ' to 76 ° 42 ' E) is entirely based on the available groundwater extracted through borewells. The study was aimed at demarcating the potable groundwater zones unaffected by pollution. The general topography of the area is gently undulating and it is situated on the left bank of the Gundal river which is a tributary of Kabini. The area is occupied with red soil and the basement Is composed of mainly metamorphic gneisses. Groundwater occurs mainly under unconfined and rarely under semi confined conditons. The aquifer occurs with in the weathered and fractured zones. Groundwater is extracted through borewells with a variable depth of 50 - 75 m. Forty one groundwater samples have been collected and analysed. A BASIC computer program, developed for hydrochemical classification {{has been used to}} determine the CaCO 3. saturation, hardness, salinity and sodium hazard indices. Individual character of all the samples with important quality parameters and ratios were determined. The water has been classified into 3 categories as, i) desirable, Ii) permissible and iii) not permissible according to I. S. I specification for drinking purpose. The individual ion character maps have been prepared. These maps help in the study and identification of the variation in different constituents within the concentration. CaCO 3. saturation indices indicated a longer time of stay of water in the aquifer and possibility of a retrograded rock contributing more carbonate also into the groundwater. Based on Handa's classification the western and southern parts of the town was found to belong to <b>temporary</b> <b>hardness</b> zone and central and remaining part belongs to a permanent hardness zone. Among the other constituents, nitrate is found to be more than the permissible limit. The average NO 3 concentration is 83 ppm. Higher concentration of NO 3 indicates the pollution of groundwater. The groundwater of non-residential area was less than 50 ppm and the residential area which has no proper sewerage system has NO 3 in excess of 5 Oppm. More than 100 ppm of NO 3 exists {{in that part of the}} town where the population is very high and dense sewerage is extremely poor and latrine pits are in abundance. ...|$|E
40|$|Water {{is a major}} {{requirement}} for life on Earth. Currently, the availability of water, especially clean water decreased quite dramatically due to deforestation, pollution from industrial activity waste, global warming, excessive water consumption, etc., so many ways continue {{to be taken to}} obtain clean water sources. Further water treatment is also needed for water containing hardness. One way to eliminate the hardness is to use ion exchange resins, namely Ion Exchanger. Hardness or hardness is one of the chemical properties owned by the water that is caused due to ions Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, or may also be due to other ions of polyvalent metal (metal-valent many) such as Al, Fe, Mn, Sr and Zn in the form of sulfate salts, chloride and bicarbonate in small quantities. There are 2 types of hardness, the hardness permanent and <b>temporary</b> <b>hardness.</b> Ion exchangers or ion exchange resins are compounds hidrokarbonterpolimerisasi up to a high level yangmengandung crosslinking bonds (cross-linking) and mengandungion-ion clusters that can be exchanged. The series of ion exchangers tool consists of three tanks, the tank cation exchanger, anion exchanger tank, and activated carbon tanks, each of which is made of FRP. At the top of the tank there is a way valve to the filter, fast rinse and back wash. The method used in the analysis of the levels of Ca and Mg is complexometry titration is the method in which the titrant and titratnya each other to form neutral complexes that dissociate in solution. In this study to test the hardness is done by means of Ion Exchanger dengankombinasi addition of activated carbon and zeolite, with a total of 110 liters of water 10 ml samples were taken every 10 minutes for 6 times. Results of observations obtained for impairment hardness using a combination of activated carbon without the addition of zeolite at 1. 2 ppm; 0. 4 ppm; 0. 3 ppm; 0. 3 ppm; 0. 2 ppm; and 0. 2 PMM. As for the results of the impairment hardness with ion exchangers combination of activated carbon and zeolite obtained addition of 1. 2 ppm; 0. 4 ppm; 0, 3 ppm; 0. 2 ppm, 0. 2 ppm; 0. 2 ppm. It can be concluded the use of Ion Exchanger combination of activated carbon and zeolite addition of more effective, because the activated carbon and zeolite functions as an adsorbent that is able to absorb Ca and Mg ions contained in the water.
