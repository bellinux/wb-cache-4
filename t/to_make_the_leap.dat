Fitch did recruit Jim Brewer before he left, laying the first seed for the 1972 Big Ten title. George Hanson, a longtime assistant coach at the school, was hired as his replacement, but resigned after only one season.|$|E

Following Maurice Clarett's {{unsuccessful}} attempt to sue the NFL over its age limit in 2004, there was considerable debate over whether any high school football player might be able <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>leap</b> from the preps to the pro game.

2500|$|The {{following}} week, he travelled to Bristol {{to attempt}} to be the second person to survive a jump from the 250 foot Clifton Suspension Bridge, after the survived suicide attempt of Sarah Ann Henley in May 1885. He later declared [...] "it was my great ambition to be introduced to [...] after I jumped off Clifton Bridge in honour of her Jubilee". On the morning of June 21, he prepared <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>leap</b> but was prevented by a toll collector on the bridge. The following evening, at 7 PM, the same toll collector recognised him and alerted police, who argued that allowing him <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>leap</b> would be akin to standing idly by as someone threw themselves {{in front of a}} tram-car. They then arrested him on a charge of attempted suicide. Although accompanied by friends willing to pay a bail, this was refused and he remained imprisoned in Horfield Prison until the 30th, then [...] "discharged...upon furnishing sureties that he would make no further effort to jump from the bridge". Unable to raise both a ₤200 bail and two [...] "sureties" [...] of ₤100, he spent a month in prison and planned to attempt the bridge again after a six-month good behaviour bond expired in December.|$|E

2500|$|In 1984, Lloyd Webber {{contacted}} Cameron Mackintosh, the co-producer of Cats and Song and Dance, {{to propose}} a new musical. He was aiming for a romantic piece, and suggested Gaston Leroux's book The Phantom of the Opera as a basis. They screened both the 1925 Lon Chaney and the 1943 Claude Rains motion picture versions, but neither saw an effective way <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>leap</b> from film to stage. Later, in New York, Lloyd Webber found a second-hand copy of the original, long-out-of-print Leroux novel, which supplied the necessary inspiration to develop a musical: [...] "I was actually writing something else at the time, and I realised that the reason I was hung up was because I was trying to write a major romantic story, and I {{had been trying to}} do that ever since I started my career. Then with the Phantom, it was there!" ...|$|E
2500|$|In this battle, the {{two factors}} {{combined}} {{to give a}} glimpse of what would end the Plains Indians way of life since horses had made them true nomads. [...] Although the “Comanche” had always been a nomadic people, it was the horse that transformed them into a true nomad culture, and a very warlike one. [...] In the Journal of American History Pekka Hämäläinen [...] estimates, as do most military historians and cultural anthropologists, that it was around 1700 that the Comanche got access to a sufficient number of Spanish horses that they were able <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>leap</b> from dog and human assisted nomadic hunter-gatherer to a true nomad culture. [...] The effects of this transformation were radical. [...] Because they were the first Plains tribe to fully incorporate the horse into their way of life, and into their way of making war, they were far and away the best at it [...] [...] Though it was rare, the only successes the Spanish ever had in battle with the Comanche were on occasions {{that they were able to}} take them by surprise. [...] However, since the Comanche became classic horse nomads, this was never easy to do. [...] It was only when the Rangers had adopted classic Comanche tactics of cold camps, forced marches, and use of scouts were they able to alter the dynamic of nomad cavalry attacking fixed settlements. [...] At Little Robe Creek, they in large part succeeded in surprising the Comanche.|$|E

60|$|It was {{a little}} after midnight when they moved forward again. Their pace was now little better than a walk, for the trail was a {{dangerous}} one, and in many spots they had to leap down and lead their horses.

He {{crouched}} down with his bands below his hips, where the big guns swung. From his distorted lips issued that which was combined roar and bellow and Indian war-whoop, and, more than all, a horrible warning cry. He resembled a hunchback about <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>leap</b> of a demon. He was quivering, vibrating. His eyes, black and hot, were fastened with most piercing intentness upon Hawe and Sneed.|$|E

40|$|Beginning {{the formal}} study of music theory well into mid-life has {{enabled me to}} focus with new clarity on a gnawing concern. This concern, which has pursued me as I have walked with my {{undergraduate}} majors into the era of whole language, has two dimensions — both young children and novice teachers. The first concern is those particular young children, who when immersed in a print rich environment, fail <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> inductive <b>leaps</b> which allow them to become emergent readers (O 2 ̆ 7 Donnell and Wood, 1992). My second concern is the early childhood and elementary preservice teachers who are so indoctrinated {{in the practice of}} whole language that they have few alternatives when this approach fails to provide success for every child...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine how and why outsiders, rather than incumbents, are able to take {{advantage}} of technological discontinuities. Design/ methodology/approach – The paper employs a case study of a single innovation that transformed the technology of Formula 1 motor racing. Findings – The findings show how social capital made up of ‘weak ties’ in the form of informal personal networks, enabled an outsider <b>to</b> successfully <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>leap</b> <b>to</b> a new technological regime. Practical implications – The findings show that where new product development involves a shift to new technologies, social capital can have an important part to play. Originality/value – It is widely accepted that radical innovations are often competence destroying, making it difficult for incumbents <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> transition <b>to</b> a new technology. The findings show how the social capital of outsiders can place them at a particular advantage in utilizing new technologies...|$|R
