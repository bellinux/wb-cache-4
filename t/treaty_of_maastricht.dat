The Provisional Government of Belgium, led by Charles Rogier, was formed on 24 September and Belgian independence was officially proclaimed on 4 October while work began on creating a constitution. In December, international governments at the Conference of London recognized the independence of Belgium and guaranteed its neutrality.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the question of}} whether European integration results in convergence in the domestic politics of EU member states. Some recent studies claim {{that as a result of}} European integration the national policies of member states are becoming more alike. The introduction of various exemptions and ‘flexibility’ arrangements in the <b>Treaties</b> <b>of</b> <b>Maastricht</b> and Amsterdam and ever growing problems with implementation seem to contradict this view. In this paper we offer a model based on insights from public choice, game theory and analytical politics, which aims to explain the conditions under which convergence may occur and the limitations to this process at the legislative and implementation stage of European policy making. At the legislative stage, our model highlights the difficulty for the Council, deciding by unanimity, in setting a uniform policy, particularly when current policies in the member states differ considerably. At the implementation stage, we account for implementation problems by focusing on the differences in view held by national political actors with regard to EU legislation. We conclude that convergence will occur only when the Union is able to set a common policy without any exemptions, which is then fully implemented by national political actors...|$|R

40|$|From the introduction]. On 22 November 2004, consul general Raymond Loretan gave {{a speech}} on Switzerland and the European Union at the European Union Studies Center in New York. He started with the words, ‘Switzerland is European’, {{followed}} by {{a long list of}} specifications on Switzerland’s Europeanness (Loretan, 2004). Some years ago no Swiss ambassador or scholar invited to an institution that had the word Europe in its name would have had to defend or even clarify Switzerland being European. There was no doubt the little Alpine country was the heart of Europe. But with the evolving political momentum of the European Union beginning with the Single European Act (1986) and especially the <b>Treaties</b> <b>of</b> <b>Maastricht</b> (1992) and Amsterdam (1997) and the accompanying enlargement of the Community the notion of European became subject to change, became appropriated by the EU. 2 Since Switzerland is {{not a member of the}} European Union and does not plan entry in foreseeable time neither it constantly has to explicate its Europeanness. Although most of us can agree on Switzerland being European simply by the geographical fact, we face frictions calling the country Europeanised.

Among other criteria spelled out under the Maastricht treaty, the Belgian Government had to attain a budget deficit of no greater than 3% of GDP by the end of 1997; Belgium achieved this, with a total budget deficit in 2001 (just prior to implementation of the Euro) that amounted to 0.2% of GDP. The government has balanced the budget every year since, until 2009 where it ran a deficit of about $25 billion. Belgium's accumulated public debt remains high at 99% of 2009 GDP. A slight decrease in the accumulated public debt compared to GDP has been seen, however, thanks to a higher economic growth rate compared to the budget growth rate, which pushed the percentage from 99% of GDP in 2009 to 95% of GDP in 2011, a four-point decrease in two years, a feat rare enough to mention in the Western World.|$|E

While it has issued a number of directives in non-labour areas, the same cannot be said for matters concerning social policy and labour.

40|$|Social {{policy has}} become an {{increasingly}} prominent component of the European Union's policy-making responsibilities. Today, for example, a highly developed body of law regulates equal treatment in social security and co-ordinates national security schemes; national health services have opened up to patients and service providers from other states; and rules govern the translation of educational and vocational certificates across member states. This state of affairs {{is all the more}} remarkable given the relatively limited resources at the EU's disposal and the initial intentions of its founders. During negotiations for the <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> Rome in the 1950 s, social policy was viewed as the exclusive provenance of the member states. There were to be provisions to facilitate labour mobility within the common market, but until the 1970 s social policy making at the EU-level was modest. However, plans for the internal market moved social policy on the EU's decision-making agenda. The Social Chapter was adopted in 1989, and the Single European Act expanded EU competencies in social policy. The <b>Treaties</b> <b>of</b> <b>Maastricht,</b> Amsterdam and Nice all expanded competencies further, so that by the time the heads of government met in Lisbon in 2007 to sign the EU's latest <b>treaty,</b> the extent <b>of</b> supranational control over important aspects of social policy making was quite impressive. This important book provides a full account of the evolution of social policy in the EU and of its current reach. It examines the reasons for the increased role of the EU in the area, in spite of formidable obstacles, and details its effects in member states, where social provision is often the biggest item in government budgets and a crucial issue in national elections. Drawing on research done on welfare states around the world and on European integration, this book provides a distinctive and sophisticated account of social policy in Europe, showing how it must now be understood in the context of multi-level governance in which EU institutions play a pivotal role...|$|R
2500|$|While free {{movement}} of workers was central to the first European Economic Community agreement, the development of European labour law has been a gradual process. Originally, the Ohlin Report of 1956 recommended that labour standards {{did not need to}} be harmonised, although a general principle of anti-discrimination between men and women was included in the early Treaties. Increasingly, the absence of labour rights was seen as inadequate given the capacity for a [...] "race to the bottom" [...] in international trade if corporations can shift jobs and production to countries with low wages. Today, the EU is required under TFEU article 147 to contribute to a [...] "high level of employment by encouraging cooperation between Member States". This has not resulted in legislation, which usually requires taxation and fiscal stimulus for significant change, while the European Central Bank's monetary policy has been acutely controversial during the Eurozone crisis. Under article 153(1), the EU is able to use the ordinary legislation procedure on a list of labour law fields. This notably excludes wage regulation and collective bargaining. Generally, four main fields of EU regulation of labour rights touch (1) individual labour rights, (2) anti-discrimination regulations, (3) rights to information, consultation, and participation at work, and (4) rights to job security. In virtually all cases, the EU follows the principle that member states can always create rights more beneficial to workers. This is because the fundamental principle of labour law is that employees' unequal bargaining power justifies substitution of rules in property and contract with positive social rights so that people may earn a living to fully participate in a democratic society. The EU's competences generally follow principles codified in the Community Charter of the Fundamental Social Rights of Workers 1989, introduced in the [...] "social chapter" [...] of the <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> <b>Maastricht.</b> Initially the UK had opted-out, because of opposition by the Conservative Party, but was acceded to when the Labour Party won the 1997 general election in the Treaty of Amsterdam.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> <b>Maastricht</b> 1992 {{renamed the}} EEC as the [...] "European Union", and {{expanded}} its powers {{to include a}} social chapter, set up a European Exchange Rate Mechanism, and limit government spending. The UK initially opted out of the social provisions, and then monetary union after the Black Wednesday crisis where speculators bet against the pound. Sweden, Finland and Austria joined in 1995, but Norway again chose not to after a 1994 referendum, instead remaining part of the European Economic Area, abiding by most EU law, but without any voting rights. At the Treaty of Amsterdam 1997, with a new Labour government, the UK joined the social chapter. A newly confident EU then sought to expand. First, the Treaty of Nice 2001 made voting weight more proportionate to population (two Irish referenda rejected, but then accepted this). Second, the Euro currency went into circulation in 2002. Third came the accession of Malta, Cyprus, Slovenia, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania. Fourth, in 2005 a Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe was proposed. This [...] "Constitution" [...] was largely symbolic, but was rejected by referenda in France and the Netherlands. Most of its technical provisions were inserted into the Treaty of Lisbon 2007, without the emotive symbols of federalism or the word [...] "constitution". Also in 2007, Bulgaria and Romania joined. Over 2007 to 2008, because of the subprime mortgage crisis in the United States, and the developing global financial crisis European banks that had invested in derivatives were put under severe pressure. British, French, German and other governments were forced to nationalise or guarantee their banks' debts. In turn, the Eurozone crisis developed when international investment withdrew and Greece, Spain, Portugal, and Ireland saw international bond markets charge unsustainably high interest rates on government debt. Eurozone governments and staff of the European Central Bank {{believed that it was}} necessary to save their banks by taking over Greek debt, and impose [...] "austerity" [...] and [...] "structural adjustment" [...] measures on debtor countries. This exacerbated further contraction in the economies. In 2011 two new treaties, the European Fiscal Compact and European Stability Mechanism were signed among Eurozone countries. In 2013, Croatia entered the EU. However a further crisis was triggered after the UK's Conservative government chose to hold a referendum in 2016, and campaigners for [...] "leave" [...] won 51.89 per cent of votes.|$|E
2500|$|Free {{movement}} of capital was traditionally {{seen as the}} fourth freedom, after goods, workers and persons, services and establishment. The original Treaty of Rome required that restrictions on free capital flows only be removed {{to the extent necessary}} for the common market. From the <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> <b>Maastricht,</b> now in TFEU article 63, [...] "all restrictions on the {{movement of}} capital between Member States and between Member States and third countries shall be prohibited". This means capital controls of various kinds are prohibited, including limits on buying currency, limits on buying company shares or financial assets, or government approval requirements for foreign investment. By contrast, taxation of capital, including corporate tax, capital gains tax and Financial transaction tax are not affected so long as they do not discriminate by nationality. According to the Capital Movement Directive 1988, Annex I, 13 categories of capital which must move free are covered. In Baars v Inspecteur der Belastingen Particulieren the Court of Justice held that for investments in companies, the capital rules, rather than freedom of establishment rules, were engaged if an investment did not enable a [...] "definite influence" [...] through shareholder voting or other rights by the investor. That case held a Dutch Wealth Tax Act 1964 unjustifiably exempted Dutch investments, but not Mr Baars' investments in an Irish company, from the tax: the wealth tax, or exemptions, had to be applied equally. On the other hand, TFEU article 65(1) does not prevent taxes that distinguish taxpayers based on their residence or the location of an investment (as taxes commonly focus on a person's actual source of profit) or any measures to prevent tax evasion. Apart from tax cases, largely following from the opinions of Advocate General Maduro, a series of cases held that government owned golden shares were unlawful. In Commission v Germany the Commission claimed the German Volkswagen Act 1960 violated article 63, in that §2(1) restricted any party having voting rights exceeding 20% of the company, and §4(3) allowed a minority of 20% of shares held by the Lower Saxony government to block any decisions. Although this was not an impediment to actual purchase of shares, or receipt of dividends by any shareholder, the Court of Justice's Grand Chamber agreed that it was disproportionate for the government's stated aim of protecting workers or minority shareholders. Similarly, in Commission v Portugal the Court of Justice held that Portugal infringed free movement of capital by retaining golden shares in Portugal Telecom that enabled disproportionate voting rights, by creating a [...] "deterrent effect on portfolio investments" [...] and reduing [...] "the attractiveness of an investment". This suggested the Court's preference that a government, if it sought public ownership or control, should nationalise in full the desired proportion of a company in line with TFEU article 345.|$|E
40|$|From the Introduction]. According to the European Council’s Declaration on "the {{strengthening}} of the Common European Policy on Security and Defence" issued at Cologne on June 4 th 1999, which follows the direction given by the "British- French Joint Declaration on European Defence", adopted at St. Malo on December 4 th 1998, the European Union is to provide the institutional framework for a future "autonomous" European military contribution to international security. The essential legal basis for such "action" in international crisis and conflict situations, which would not correspond to "article 5 contingencies" of the North Atlantic alliance treaty and therefore would not constitute a case for NATO "collective defence" with the commitment of all the allies including the US and Canada, {{is to be the}} Union <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> Amsterdam, effective as of 19993. The common security and defence policy is to be set into the framework of the CFSP as defined by the union <b>treaties</b> <b>of</b> <b>Maastricht</b> and Amsterdam and accordingly limited to the "Petersberg Tasks" agreed upon in 1992 by the partners of the WEU and inscribed into the Amsterdam treaty. It should be conceived {{as a part of the}} latter. In the wording of the Cologne decisions and the report of the German presidency, adopted by the Council as expression of the agreement between the member-states, the "development of a common European security and defence policy" is meant to "strengthen the CFSP". To this end "capacity for autonomous action, backed up by credible military forces, the means to decide to use them, and the readiness to do so" and "appropriate" organisms and procedures for decision-making are deemed necessary by the Chiefs of State and Government assembled at Cologne, "in order to respond to international crises". In the "Declaration of the European Council" on the "Common European Policy on Security and Defence" the "intention" is expressed to provide the EU with "the necessary means and capabilities" for "conflict prevention and crisis management" in order to "contribute to international peace and security in accordance with the principles of the UN Charter without prejudice to actions by NATO". The "measures" to be taken in such contingencies by the EU "irrespectively" of NATO require "military as well as political and economic" means...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{years have}} seen very {{significant}} developments in the 'youth sector' at European level. There are two major institutional contexts for these (and other) European developments, and not surprisingly people sometimes get the two mixed up. The first is the European Union (EU) which {{grew out of the}} European Economic Community (EEC, or 'Common Market') established in 1957 when six member states signed the <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> Rome. The membership has grown over the years to its current figure of 27 (Ireland joined in 1973) and a succession <b>of</b> further <b>treaties</b> have amended and expanded the competences of the 'community' or 'union'; these include the <b>Treaties</b> <b>of</b> <b>Maastricht</b> (1993), Amsterdam (1999), Nice (2003) and, most recently, Lisbon (2009). While the term 'economic' is no longer included in the EU's name, economic matters remain absolutely central to its purpose. The Council of Europe (CoE) is a different organisation. It was established in 1949, {{in the aftermath of the}} Second World War, by ten founding members (including Ireland) with the purpose of promoting democracy, the rule of law, human rights and cultural cooperation across the continent. Its most important and best known instrument is the European Convention on Human Rights which established (and is enforced by) the European Court of Human Rights. For several decades the CoE's membership was confined to the countries of western Europe but in the years following the collapse of the Berlin Wall in 1989 (and the associated political transformations) it grew into a genuinely pan-European organisation. It currently has 47 member states. Both the European Union and the Council of Europe have relevance for youth, youth work and youth policy. The CoE has played a pioneering role in these matters, and has had a significant influence on the approach adopted by the EU. In fact the two work closely together and in more recent years have formalised their collaboration through the EU-CoE Youth Partnership. Keeping up to date with recent and current developments in youth policy at European level means knowing what each organisation is doing separately and also what they are doing jointly through the Youth Partnership. Below is an outline of developments under each of these three headings...|$|R
40|$|The {{idea of an}} {{inevitable}} process of centralization in the European Community (EC) /European Union (EU) is a myth. Also, the metaphor of creeping competences, with its suggestion of a surreptitious but continuous growth of {{the powers of the}} Commission, can be misleading. It is true that the functional scope of EC/EU competences has steadily increased, but the nature of new competences has changed dramatically, as may be seen from the evolution of the methods of harmonization. The original emphasis on total harmonization, which gives the Community exclusive competence over a given policy area, has been largely replaced by more flexible but less communitarian methods such as optional and minimum harmonization, reference to nonbinding technical standards, and mutual recognition. Finally, the <b>treaties</b> <b>of</b> <b>Maastricht</b> and Amsterdam explicitly excluded harmonization for most new competences. Thus, the expansion of the jurisdiction of the EC/EU has not automatically increased the powers of the Commission, but has actually weakened them in several respects. In addition, the progressive parliamentarization of the Commission risks compromising its credibility as an independent regulator, without necessarily enhancing its democratic legitimacy. Since the member states continue to oppose any centralization of regulatory powers, even in areas essential to the functioning of the internal market, the task of implementing Community policies should be entrusted to networks of independent national and European regulators, roughly modeled on the European System of Central Banks. The Commission would coordinate and monitor the activities of these networks in order to ensure the coherence of EC regulatory policies. More generally, it should bring its distinctive competence more clearly into focus by concentrating on the core business of ensuring the development and proper functioning of the single European market. This is a more modest role than that of the kernel of a future government of Europe, but it is essential to the credibility of the integration process and does not overstrain the limited financial and legitimacy resources available to the Commission...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} I have {{discussed}} the common foreign and security policy in the European Union, and it's development in the 1990 's. My theoretical framework is a continuum between two theories: intergovernmentalism and supranationalism. My aim {{is to find out}} which of these theories better describes the development, current situation and the foreseeable future of the CFSP. I also explore the structural possibilities for working foreign policy and contemplate its meaning for the whole integration process. My method is purely analytical, using the findings of my material and previously done research. I have used as material <b>Treaties</b> <b>of</b> <b>Maastricht,</b> Amsterdam and the European Council Declarations of Cologne and Helsinki. Theories have been presented using the prominent writers of each theoretical tradition, e. g. Andrew Moravcsik, Michael Smith and Paul Pierson. My case study is Yugoslavian conflict in the 1990 's, beginning from Bosnia and ending to Kosovo. My intention has been to use it as an example of functioning of the CFSP, and analyse the reasons for its failure. I also present the current security situation in Europe as a context in which the CFSP is supposed to work. The question of European security brings up the need and the obstacles in the way of security co-operation. I have emphasised the relationship between the EU and the NATO, as they create the balance in Western security hemisphere. Here I am using the new framework for security by Barry Buzan and his colleagues. My conclusions show that although the CFSP has been unable to fulfil the expectations <b>of</b> the <b>Maastricht</b> <b>Treaty,</b> and has faced difficulties in overcoming the intergovernmentalist practises, it has over the past year taken a step towards supranationalism somewhat unexpectedly. The leaders of the EU have found the need of developing common defense policy along with the deepening integration. Endast sammandrag.

40|$|Madame Guigou 2 ̆ 7 s {{prediction}} that a 2 ̆ 2 single judicial space 2 ̆ 2 {{might be in}} place by the year 2020 signals a brave new horizon {{for the rule of law}} in the European Union. Yet even her dramatic claim fails to convey the range, depth, and momentum of changes wrought by the <b>Treaties</b> <b>of</b> <b>Maastricht</b> and Amsterdam in the realm of justice. The European Union is installing new infrastructure upon which to build a 2 ̆ 2 genuine European area of justice. 2 ̆ 2 This 2 ̆ 2 European judicial area 2 ̆ 2 constitutes a key component of the 2 ̆ 2 area of freedom, security and justice 2 ̆ 2 (2 ̆ 2 AFSJ 2 ̆ 2). The Amsterdam Treaty added the AFSJ as a dimension of the Union, in order to promote the free movement of persons. 2 ̆ 2 EUstitia 2 ̆ 2 is a neologism that aims to capture both pragmatic and aspirational aspects of this new European governance project. The term is used here to refer solely to the civil law component of the AFSJ. This article both examines EUstitia 2 ̆ 7 s key features, and explores the implications of institutionalizing civil justice in the European Union. In particular, it contextualizes and examines measures that have been taken, proposed, or planned to establish the 2 ̆ 2 genuine European area of justice 2 ̆ 2 since the Amsterdam Treaty entered into effect in May 1999. EUstitia comprises the 2 ̆ 2 communitarization 2 ̆ 2 of private international law, together with other measures related to 2 ̆ 2 judicial cooperation in civil matters. 2 ̆ 2 The European Union 2 ̆ 7 s efforts to create a 2 ̆ 2 genuine area of justice... based on the principles of transparency and democratic control 2 ̆ 2 have been rapid and dramatic. Yet, however remarkable the initial burst of activity, the European Union has just crossed the threshold of this burgeoning field of law- and policy-making. The developments surveyed in this article are the leading edge of a wave that will alter the European legal landscape in the years ahead...|$|R
