5|$|Initially, <b>the</b> <b>typewriter</b> {{received}} an unenthusiastic reception from the public. Lack of an established market, high cost, {{and the need}} for trained operators slowed its adoption. Additionally, recipients of typewritten messages found the mechanical, all upper-case writing to be impersonal and even insulting. The new communication technologies and expanding businesses of the late 19th century, however, had created a need for expedient, legible correspondence, and so the Sholes and Glidden and its contemporaries soon became common office fixtures. <b>The</b> <b>typewriter</b> is credited with assisting the entrance of women into the clerical workplace, as many were hired to operate the new devices.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} popular {{arguments}} against wider sentence spacing is that it was created for monospaced fonts of <b>the</b> <b>typewriter,</b> and is no longer needed with modern proportional fonts.|$|E
5|$|The Sholes and Glidden was {{the first}} commercially {{successful}} typewriter. Industrialization and corporate growth in the late 19th century produced a business environment for which the device was well suited. New communications technologies, such as the telegraph and telephone, facilitated geographic expansion and increased {{the speed with which}} business was conducted. The resulting increase in the volume of correspondence required messages to be produced quickly and legibly. Before <b>the</b> <b>typewriter,</b> clerks and copyists could write relatively quickly in shorthand or longhand. The comprehension of these scripts, however, required either special training or close concentration. Typesetting was used when legibility was important, but it was a slow and expensive process. <b>The</b> <b>typewriter</b> succeeded because it simultaneously addressed both issues.|$|E
50|$|It is also {{possible}} to connect some machines to certain electric typewriters {{for use as a}} printer (<b>the</b> <b>typewriters</b> are also able to be connected to PCs for this purpose, and the interface tends to be a standard RS-232 and/or DIN plug), and in some cases to access <b>the</b> <b>typewriter's</b> floppy or micro floppy drives.|$|R

5|$|Following a {{demonstration}} at Remington's offices in New York, the company contracted on March1, 1873, to manufacture 1,000machines, with {{the option to}} produce an additional 24,000. Although the agreement required Densmore to give Remington $10,000 and royalty rights, a marketing firm to be formed by Densmore and Yost was allowed {{to serve as the}} exclusive sales agent. Remington dedicated a wing of its factory to <b>the</b> <b>typewriter,</b> and spent several months retooling and re-engineering the device; production began in September and the machine entered the market on July1, 1874. Typewriter production was largely overseen by Jefferson Clough and William K. Jenne, manager of Remington's sewing machine division. The redesigned machine was sturdier and more reliable than Sholes' model, but it had taken on some of the characteristics of a sewing machine, including a japanned case with floral ornamentation and a stand with a treadle to operate the carriage return. <b>The</b> <b>typewriter,</b> however, had been rushed into production with insufficient testing, and early models were soon returned for adjustments and repair.|$|E

A few days later, Nemo goes to Elise's house but sees her with her 22-year-old boyfriend. Frustrated, he speeds away on his motorcycle, has an {{accident}} and is hospitalized in a vegetative state. Though he can perceive the world through his senses, Nemo cannot move or speak. He detects his parents' reunion at his bedside.

5|$|One of {{the reasons}} for the {{increase}} in the numbers of skyscrapers during the period was the growth in demand for office workers. In part this demand was fuelled by many U.S firms becoming larger and more complex, and white-collar sectors such as insurance and banking grew in scale. It was also driven by changing technology. <b>The</b> <b>typewriter</b> was joined in the office by the adding machine, the telephone and filing cabinets, all adding to the demand for office space and requiring increasingly specialised workers.|$|E

The user would attach a piece of white paper and a sheet of coloring paper onto the cylinder by way of several clips. These models also included an electro-magnet for the Ball which controlled both <b>the</b> <b>typewriter's</b> movement and manipulation, thus making Malling-Hansen's machine <b>the</b> first electric <b>typewriter.</b> This electro-magnet was powered by a 10 or 12-cell battery, and controlled a mechanical escapement in <b>the</b> <b>typewriter's</b> clockwork, moving <b>the</b> carriage a fixed amount each time one of the pistons was depressed.|$|R

25|$|A {{number of}} {{typographical}} conventions originate from {{the widespread use}} of <b>the</b> <b>typewriter,</b> based on the characteristics and limitations of <b>the</b> <b>typewriter</b> itself. For example, the QWERTY keyboard typewriter did not include keys for the en dash and the em dash. To overcome this limitation, users typically typed more than one adjacent hyphen to approximate these symbols. This typewriter convention is still sometimes used today, even though modern computer word processing applications can input the correct en and em dashes for each font type.|$|E

500|$|An {{improved}} model, the Remington No.2, {{was also}} introduced in 1878. The new machine {{was able to}} type upper and lowercase characters, thus remedying a significant drawback of its predecessor. As <b>the</b> only <b>typewriter</b> manufacturer, Remington maintained a monopoly position until the American Writing Machine Company introduced a typewriter {{to compete with the}} Remington machines in 1881. In response to the new competition, Remington lowered the price of the Sholes and Glidden (referred to in sales literature as the Remington No.1) to $80, and negotiated an agreement with the marketing firm Wyckoff, Seamans & Benedict to take all the machines produced. The arrangement marked the beginning of <b>the</b> <b>typewriter's</b> commercial success, as the agency's marketing prowess led to the sale of 1,200machines in its first year. By 1884, more competitors had appeared, including <b>the</b> Hammond <b>Typewriter</b> Company, <b>the</b> Crandall Type-Writer Company and <b>the</b> Hall <b>Typewriter</b> Company; in <b>the</b> decade since the introduction of the Sholes and Glidden, a [...] "thriving typewriter industry" [...] had developed.|$|R
25|$|Although {{ubiquitous}} in typeset material, the typographic apostrophe (â€™) is rather difficult to enter on a computer, since {{it does not}} have its own key on a standard keyboard. Outside the world of professional typesetting and graphic design, many people {{do not know how to}} enter this character and instead use <b>the</b> <b>typewriter</b> apostrophe ('). <b>The</b> <b>typewriter</b> apostrophe has always been considered tolerable on Web pages because of the egalitarian nature of Web publishing, the low resolution of computer monitors in comparison to print, and legacy limitations provided by ASCII.|$|E

25|$|Historical style guides {{before the}} 20th century {{typically}} indicated that wider spaces {{were to be}} used between sentences. Standard word spaces were about one-third of an em space, but sentences were to be divided by a full em-space. With the arrival of <b>the</b> <b>typewriter</b> in the late 19th century, style guides for writers began diverging from printer's manuals, indicating that writers should double-space between sentences. This held {{for most of the}} 20th century until the computer began replacing <b>the</b> <b>typewriter</b> as the primary means of creating text. In the 1990s, style guides reverted to recommending a single-space between sentences. However, instead of a slightly larger sentence space, style guides simply indicated a standard word space. This is now the convention for publishers.|$|E
