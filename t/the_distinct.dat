5|$|Based on {{studies of}} morphology, the bluebuck has {{historically}} been classified as either a distinct species or as a subspecies of the roan antelope. After its extinction, some 19th-century naturalists began to doubt its validity as a species, with some believing the museum specimens to be small or immature roan antelopes, and both species were lumped together under the name A.leucophaeus by the English zoologist George Robert Gray in 1821. The Austrian zoologist Franz Friedrich Kohl pointed out <b>the</b> <b>distinct</b> features of the bluebuck in 1866, followed by Sclater and Thomas, who rejected the synonymy in 1899.|$|E

5|$|Another {{method to}} isolate {{mendelevium}} exploits <b>the</b> <b>distinct</b> elution properties of Md2+ {{from those of}} Es3+ and Fm3+. The initial steps {{are the same as}} above, and employs HDEHP for extraction chromatography, but coprecipitates the mendelevium with terbium fluoride instead of lanthanum fluoride. Then, 50mg of chromium is added to the mendelevium to reduce it to the +2 state in 0.1Mhydrochloric acid with zinc or mercury. The solvent extraction then proceeds, and while the trivalent and tetravalent lanthanides and actinides remain on the column, mendelevium(II) does not and stays in the hydrochloric acid. It is then reoxidized to the +3 state using hydrogen peroxide and then isolated by selective elution with 2Mhydrochloric acid (to remove impurities, including chromium) and finally 6Mhydrochloric acid (to remove the mendelevium). It is also possible to use a column of cationite and zinc amalgam, using 1Mhydrochloric acid as an eluant, reducing Md(III) to Md(II) where it behaves like the alkaline earth metals. Thermochromatographic chemical isolation could be achieved using the volatile mendelevium hexafluoroacetylacetonate: the analogous fermium compound is also known and is also volatile.|$|E
5|$|As the Osiris myth first {{appears in}} the Pyramid Texts, most of its {{essential}} features must have taken shape sometime before the texts were written down. <b>The</b> <b>distinct</b> segments of the story—Osiris's death and restoration, Horus's childhood, and Horus's conflict with Set—may originally have been independent mythic episodes. If so, they must have begun to coalesce into a single story {{by the time of}} the Pyramid Texts, which loosely connect those segments. In any case, the myth was inspired by a variety of influences. Much of the story is based in religious ideas and the general nature of Egyptian society: the divine nature of kingship, the succession from one king to another, the struggle to maintain maat, and the effort to overcome death. For instance, the lamentations of Isis and Nephthys for their dead brother may represent an early tradition of ritualized mourning.|$|E
