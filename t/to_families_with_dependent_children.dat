40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} cash transfers and food stamp benefits on family labor supply and welfare participation among two-parent <b>families.</b> The Aid <b>to</b> <b>Families</b> <b>with</b> <b>Dependent</b> Children-Unemployed Parent Program has been providing cash benefits to two-parent households since 1961 and recent congressional action has increased its importance. In this model, the husband's and wife's labor supply decisions are constrained by a family budget constraint which is non-convex due to features of the AFDC-UP program. The husband's and wife's labor supply decisions are restricted to no work, part-time work and full-time work. Features of the tax and transfer programs are modeled formally using kinked budget restraints. Maximum likelihood techniques are used to estimate parameters of the underlying hours of work and welfare participation equations. The estimates from the model are {{used to determine the}} magnitude of the work disincentive effects of the AFDC-UP program, and to simulate the effects of changes in AFDC-UP benefit and eligibility rules on family labor supply and welfare participation. The results suggest that labor supply and welfare participation among two-parent families are highly responsive to changes in the benefit structure under the AFDC-UP program. ...|$|R
2500|$|In 1992, {{the state}} of California enacted a statute {{limiting}} the maximum welfare benefits available to newly arrived residents. At the time, California was paying the sixth-largest welfare benefits in the United States. In a move to reduce the state welfare budget, the California State Legislature enacted a statute (Cal. Welf. & Inst. Code Ann. §11450.03) to limit new residents, {{for the first year}} they live in the state, to the benefits they would have received in {{the state of}} their prior residence. [...] For the state to comply with the then-existent Aid <b>to</b> <b>Families</b> <b>with</b> <b>Dependent</b> <b>Children</b> program, it needed a waiver from the United States Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) in order to qualify for federal reimbursement. Louis Wade Sullivan, who was HHS Secretary at that point, granted his approval in October 1992.|$|E
2500|$|In writings, {{speeches and}} interviews, Gingrich {{has argued that}} Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security, and other {{entitlement}} programs are fiscally unsustainable. Without reform, according to Gingrich, this will cause major financial problems, such as large benefit reductions or massive tax increases. In order to avoid these outcomes, Gingrich supports {{what he calls a}} [...] "replacement approach" [...] to entitlement reform. He argues that entitlement programs need fundamental restructuring in order to strengthen incentives for work and productivity. Gingrich cites the reform of Aid <b>to</b> <b>Families</b> <b>with</b> <b>Dependent</b> <b>Children</b> passed in the 1990s as a model for future policymaking. Gingrich has argued that the current welfare and unemployment insurance system continues to create work disincentives that trap people in poverty. He has proposed replacing these systems with an offer of guaranteed employment for the able-bodied, preferably in the private sector to save taxpayer money, or retraining. Beneficiaries who work enough hours would receive Medicare vouchers and housing assistance.|$|E

5000|$|Family {{support is}} one of the main issues that most social {{policies}} in Ireland try <b>to</b> address. <b>Family</b> policies in Ireland are at a higher percentage rate than other liberal democracies; 2.5 percent of all policies or 1.6 percent of GDP. [...] The typical family unit in Ireland is the nuclear <b>family</b> <b>with</b> children at 49 percent, <b>with</b> <b>families</b> without children, 21 percent, and single mothers, 15 percent, being the next two common family types. [...] In Babies and Bosses, it states that [...] "the main Irish support for families is the universal non-taxable Child Benefit (paid for children under the age 16 or 16-19 and in full time education), which trebled in value between 1997 and 2002. The Irish in-work benefit, the Family Income Supplement (FIS) is paid <b>to</b> low-income <b>families</b> <b>with</b> <b>dependent</b> children, where parents work at least 19 hours per week between them, to provide financial incentives for low-skill jobless <b>families</b> <b>to</b> enter work and because of the lower hours limit ensures that it is paid to those who are more than marginally attached to the labor market". [...] As Millar, Coen, Bradley and Rau state in their article on parenting, work, and family policies, [...] "the growing number of Irish women engaged in paid work contributed significantly to economic growth and the so-called [...] "Celtic Tiger" [...] boom, from only 7.5 percent in 1971 to 48.8 percent in 2004". They also state that because of the increase of female labor participation, most Irish women suffer from [...] "dual burden", which is because family policies have lagged, leaving no support for child care services. [...] Even though family policies are a bigger concern in Ireland compared to other liberal democracies, the Irish female labor participation is much lower. There is still plenty of improvements that need to be made in Irish family policies.|$|R

2500|$|Recent debates have {{centered}} {{on the need for}} policies that focus on both [...] "income poverty" [...] and [...] "asset poverty." [...] Advocates for the approach argue that traditional governmental poverty policies focus solely on supplementing the income of the poor through programs such as Aid <b>to</b> <b>Families</b> <b>with</b> <b>Dependent</b> <b>Children</b> (AFDC) and Food Stamps. According to the CFED , 27 percent of households – nearly double the percentage that are income poor – are living in [...] "asset poverty." [...] These families do not have the savings or other assets to cover basic expenses (equivalent to what could be purchased with a poverty level income) for three months if a layoff or other emergency leads to loss of income. Since 2009, the number of asset poor families has increased by 21 percent from about one in five families to one in four families. In order to provide assistance to such asset poor families, Congress appropriated $24 million to administer the Assets for Independence Program {{under the supervision of the}} US Department for Health and Human Services. The program enables community-based nonprofits and government agencies to implement Individual Development Account or IDA programs, which are an asset-based development initiative. Every dollar accumulated in IDA savings is matched by federal and non-federal funds to enable households to add to their assets portfolio by buying their first home, acquiring a post-secondary education, or starting or expanding a small business.|$|E

30|$|The {{governments in}} all the four {{countries}} examined in this paper — Canada, Australia, Japan and South Korea — have adopted the idea and {{the language of the}} social investment since the 1990 s. In Canada, the social investment idea was publicly articulated by the federal Liberal government through the Throne Speech {{at the beginning of the}} Parliamentary Session in 1997. Over the next decade, the social investment discourses developed at both federal and provincial levels. The emergence of the social investment approach in Canada can be observed by the various policy experimentations at different levels of governments. These include the highly successful implementation of the $ 5 -a-day child care program in Quebec, the introduction of the Canada Child Tax Benefit in 1998 extending financial support <b>to</b> low income <b>families</b> <b>with</b> <b>dependent</b> children, and which expanded over the next decade, and the failed federal attempt to develop a national day care strategy in 2004. Despite the local and provincial variations, observers argue that the social investment perspective in Canada gradually led to a redesigning of “welfare architecture” over the next decade and a half as ideas and slogans such as “invest in children” became mainstreamed and social policies became increasingly oriented towards early education and learning and other forms of skills and human capital development (Jenson & St-Martin, 2003; Jenson, 2010).|$|R
