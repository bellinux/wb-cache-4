5|$|In 1932, the two cart sheds {{on either}} side of the lane leading into the farm were removed. That year, Councillor T. R. Parker {{purchased}} a plot of land on the site from King's College. Manor Farm continued as a working farm until the following year, when the local council began to sell off much of the land surrounding the buildings for housing developments. Councillor Parker presented his land to the Ruislip Village Trust as the site of a future public hall, and the Trust passed it to the urban district council in 1964 stipulating <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> the sole use.

25|$|In {{explaining}} why neutral Britain {{went to war}} with Germany, Kennedy (1980) recognised it was critical for war that Germany become economically more powerful than Britain, but he downplays the disputes over economic trade imperialism, the Baghdad Railway, confrontations in Eastern Europe, high-charged political rhetoric and domestic pressure-groups. Germany's reliance time and again on sheer power, while Britain increasingly appealed to moral sensibilities, played a role, especially in seeing the invasion of Belgium as a necessary military tactic or a profound moral crime. The German invasion of neutral Belgium was not important because the British decision had already been made and the British were {{more concerned with the}} fate of France (pp.457–62). Kennedy argues that by far the main reason was London's fear that a repeat of 1870, when Prussia and the German states smashed France, would mean that Germany, with a powerful army and navy, would control the English Channel and northwest France. British policy-makers insisted <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a catastrophe for British security.|$|E

25|$|The {{siege of}} Jerusalem in 597BCE {{led to the}} city being {{overcome}} by the Babylonians, who then took the young King Jehoiachin into Babylonian captivity, together {{with most of the}} aristocracy. Zedekiah, who had been placed on the throne by Nebuchadnezzar (the Babylonian king), rebelled, and Nebuchadnezzar, who at the time (587/586BCE) was ruler of a most powerful empire, recaptured the city, killed Zedekiah's descendants in front of him, and plucked out Zedekiah's eyes so <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> the last thing he ever saw. The Babylonians then took Zedekiah into captivity, along with prominent members of Judah. The Babylonians then burnt the temple, destroyed the city's walls, and appointed Gedaliah son of Achikam as governor of Judah. After 52 days of rule, Yishmael, son of Netaniah, a surviving descendant of Zedekiah, assassinated Gedaliah after encouragement by Baalis, the king of Ammon. Some of the remaining population of Judah, fearing the vengeance of Nebuchadnezzar, fled to Egypt.|$|E

500|$|At the BFI London Film Festival, Nagy {{said she}} titled the film Carol, not The Price of Salt, because Highsmith herself {{had changed the}} title to Carol when the novel was republished, and she also [...] "liked the sort of strange, obsessive nature of calling it by someone's name." [...] There were later other discussions with Haynes. Haynes said that the film is called Carol because the novel [...] "is locked into the {{subjectivity}} of the younger woman" [...] and Carol is [...] "really the object of desire in the story." [...] "There's an element of, something aloof ... something unsettled about , that puts Therese and these new feelings ... on edge {{throughout much of the}} film. That relationship of who's the object and who's the subject does shift in the story, but it made sense ultimately <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> the name for the film." [...] On the universal theme of the story, Haynes said [...] "the real determining question is not whether society will accept [...] feelings or not; it's, will this person return her love or not? ... That is what transcends the class of love, or the period in which it's occurring, and makes it something that just humbles us all and levels us all in the throes of those experiences that most of us have." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{introduction}} {{is followed}} by a transcript of Chomsky's Howard Zinn Memorial Lecture, originally given to Occupy Boston in Dewey Square on October 22, 2011. Contrasting the hope of the working classes in the Great Depression of the 1930s with the pessimism of their contemporaries in the current recession, Chomsky discusses the changes to the U.S. economy that have occurred since the 1970s: de-industrialization, de-development {{and the rise of the}} financial sector at the expense of other parts of the economy. He notes how both Adam Smith and David Ricardo partly foresaw this situation. Highlighting the work of Tom Ferguson, he discusses how the political parties have come under the increasing control of the corporate sector. Proceeding to look at corruption among the 1%, he makes reference to both Citigroup and Alan Greenspan, before discussing the role that worker sit-ins and industry takeovers could play in democratizing the U.S. economy, as well as the threat posed by both nuclear war and environmental catastrophe, both problems exacerbated by the current capitalist system. Finally, he responds to questions posed by the audience, discussing the concept of corporate personhood, rejecting the idea that the U.S. elite could resort to fascism, and discussing the possibility of a general strike, arguing <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> [...] "a possible idea at a time when the population is ready for it." ...|$|E
500|$|The Green Goblin {{debuted in}} The Amazing Spider-Man #14. At this time his {{identity}} was unknown, but he proved popular and reappeared in later issues, which {{made a point}} of his secret identity. According to both Stan Lee and John Romita, Sr., who replaced Ditko as the title's artist, Lee always wanted the Green Goblin to be someone Peter Parker knew, while Ditko wanted his civilian identity to be someone who hadn't yet been introduced. Lee elaborated: [...] "Steve wanted him to turn out to be just some character that we had never seen before. Because, he said, in real life, very often a villain turns out to be somebody that you never knew. And I felt <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> wrong. I felt, in a sense, it would be like cheating the reader. ... if it's somebody you didn't know and had never seen, then {{what was the point of}} following all the clues? I think that frustrates the reader." [...] However, Lee prefaced this statement by admitting that, due to his self-professed poor memory, he may have been confusing the Green Goblin with a different character, and in an earlier essay he had said that he could not remember whether Norman Osborn being the Green Goblin was his idea or Ditko's. Ditko has maintained that it was his idea, even claiming that he had decided on it before the first Green Goblin story was finished, and that a character he drew in the background of a single panel of Amazing Spider-Man #23 was meant to be Norman Osborn (who is not introduced until issue #37).|$|E
500|$|The {{financial}} operations made in dollars {{were subject to}} a strong currency substitution to pesos, the [...] "pesification". There were disputes over the exchange rate of such substitution, as the current price of the dollar in the open market would force most firms and individual debtor to bankruptcy. The initial policy was to make 1 to 1 substitutions to the operations below 100,000 dollars. Another conflict was the corralito, imposed by De la Rúa, which attempted to stop the bank run by forbidding the withdrawal of money from bank accounts. Duhalde promised in his oath of office speech that [...] "The one who deposited dollars will receive dollars". The minister of economy Jorge Remes Lenicov pointed out <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> impossible, {{as the amount of}} dollars required was higher than even the foreign-exchange reserves of the Central Bank. Duhalde acknowledged two weeks later that he was mistaken. The bank accounts in dollars would be [...] "pesified" [...] at a 1.4 exchange rate, and the state financed the banks for the different rates with other operations. The taxes of public services were [...] "pesified" [...] and fixed at their current values. Most industries benefited from the [...] "pesification" [...] and the devaluation, as they could now export at higher prices, and the economy started to improve. The jump in the international price of soybean in July 2002 also proved highly beneficial. The devaluation also increased the price of imported products, which allowed import substitution industrialization. As the local prices became cheap in dollars, international tourism to the country was increased. The national state absorbed the debts of the provinces and the bonds used as alternative currency, on the condition that they transferred the power to issue bonds.|$|E
