On some statistical aspects of {{the interval}} mapping for QTL detection. Statist. Sinica 15, 909 - 925] show that the limiting null distribution of the likelihood ratio test (LRT) statistic for testing existence of a QTL flanked by two markers {{is that of the}} supremum of a [chi] 2 -process. In this note, an explicit representation of the supremum in terms of the recombination fraction between two markers of the [chi] 2 -process is presented.

By focusing on the Pacific Northwest, I examined the ramifications of increased likelihood for extreme warm anomalies for a particular region as opposed to a global scale and see when this should be expected to happen. Data from observations, climate models and projections were used to create a picture of the region’s SST history. The highest temperature reached in the historical data was averaged at 17. 5 oC, so I used this historical maximum as a <b>threshold</b> <b>marker</b> for the observational and projection data. I concluded that the advent of climate change can be viewed through the combination of past, present, and future data as the climate threshold of 17. 5 oC is passed more frequently as the CO 2 concentration increases in the atmosphere. As we move forward, anthropogenic sources will cause the global effects of climate change to only get worse...|$|E

Poor discrimination between ZAP- 70 {{positive and negative}} cells hampers routine application of flow cytometry. We examined the usefulness of FACS Lysing Solution. Methods: ZAP- 70 expression in 65 healthy volunteers was measured by four-color flow cytometry, comparing FACS Lysing Solution for fixation and permeabilization with the Fix & Perm kit. Separation between ZAP- 70 positive T cells and negative B cells {{was based on a}} ratio of median ZAP- 70 staining of T cells to B cells. In 25 B-CLL patients, ZAP- 70 expression was estimated using the lower limit of the fluorescence range corresponding with 98 % of ZAP- 70 positive T cells as <b>threshold</b> <b>marker</b> as well as a ratio of B-CLL cell to internal T-cell median ZAP- 70 staining. Results: Use of FACS Lysing Solution resulted in approximately fourfold increased separation between ZAP- 70 positive T cells and negative B cells, when compared with the Fix & Perm kit. In B-CLL samples, ZAP- 70 negative and positive B-cell expression could be clearly discerned.

Treadmill speed, oxygen uptake (V O 2), heartrate (HR), rating of perceived exertion (RPE) and plasma lactate were measured for each stage, and calculated at: fixed blood lactate accumulation (FBLA) 4. 0 mmol/L, an initial 1 mmol/L rise, deviation maximum (D max), lactate threshold (LT) and log-log LT. There was no effect (p> 0. 05) of stage duration on speed, V O 2, HR and RPE at fixed markers. For 8 min stages, speed was lower at modelled markers: D max (- 1. 1 km/h; p= 0. 001), LT (- 0. 9 km/h; p= 0. 008) and log-log LT (- 0. 8 km/h; p= 0. 006), yet RPE was higher and V O 2 lower for LT (1. 1, p= 0. 02; - 0. 27 L/min, p= 0. 01) and log-log LT (1. 4, p= 0. 03; - 0. 29 L/min, p= 0. 002).

Nonlinear mixed-effects models were {{used to describe the}} lactation patterns and were extended to include marker information following single-marker and interval mapping models. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) affecting the shape and scale of lactation curves for production and health traits in dairy cattle were mapped in three U. S. Holstein families (Dairy Bull DNA Repository families one, four, and five) using the granddaughter design. Information on 81 informative markers on six Bos taurus autosomes (BTA) was combined with milk yield, fat, and protein percentage and somatic cell score (SCS) test-day records. Six percent of the single-marker tests surpassed the experiment-wise significance <b>threshold.</b> <b>Marker</b> BL 41 on BTA 3 was associated with decrease in milk yield during mid-lactation in family one. The scale and shape of the protein percentage lactation curve in family four varied with BMC 4203 (BTA 6) allele that the son received from the grandsire. Some map locations were associated with variation in the lactation pattern of multiple traits. In family four, the marker HUJI 177 (BTA 3) was associated with changes in the milk yield and protein percentage curves suggesting a QTL with pleiotropic effects or multiple QTL in the region. The interval mapping model uncovered a QTL on BTA 7 associated with variation in milk-yield pattern in family four and a QTL on BTA 21 affecting SCS in family five. The developed approach can be extended to random regressions, covariance functions, spline, gametic and variance component models. The results from the longitudinal-QTL approach will help to understand the genetic factors acting at different stages of lactation and will assist in positional candidate gene research.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a study of perception-driven {{automatic}} segmentation of colour images. Despite immediate practical interest for this task, there exist very few reliable algorithms suitable for unsupervised processing. Most of the results presented in this thesis are based on mathematical morphology. This {{is a relatively new}} field which explores topological and geometrical properties of images and which has proven to be useful for image processing. The overview of morphological techniques can be found in chapter 2. A brief overview of segmentation methods is presented in, chapter 3. Only a small proportion of the vast number of publications on the subject is reviewed, namely those that are papers directly relevant to the subject of the thesis. Two novel non-parametric algorithms have been developed by the author for processing colour images. The first one is for processing randomly textured images. It uses a bottom-up segmentation algorithm which takes into consideration both colour and texture properties of the image. An "LUV gradient" is introduced which provides both a colour similarity measure and a basis for applying the watershed transform. The patches of watershed mosaic are merged according to their colour contrast until a termination criterion is met. This criterion is based on the topology of a typical processed image. The resulting algorithm does not require any additional information, be it various <b>thresholds,</b> <b>marker</b> extraction rules and suchlike, thus being suitable for automatic processing. The second algorithm deals with non-textured images and takes into consideration the noise that is present during the image acquisition. The watershed algorithm is used to segment either the 2 - or 3 -dimensional colour histogram of an image. To comply with the way humans perceive colour, this segmentation has to take place in a perceptually uniform colour space such as the Luv space. To avoid over segmentation, the watershed algorithm has to be applied to a smoothed-out histogram. The noise, however, is inhomogeneous in the Luv space and noise analysis for this space based on experimentally justified assumptions is presented. Both algorithms have been extensively tested on real data and were found to give stable results that are in good accord with human perception...|$|R
40|$|The {{demand for}} cloud {{computing}} usage is speedily increasing {{day by day}} due to the facilities and advantages it offers. Such rapid growth of the large-scale computing systems usage will lead to an instant increase of Power consumption and emission of carbon by cloud platforms. In this context, a major concern of cloud computing operation is in achieving a load balanced system which can improve the platform for more efficient operations towards realizing a green cloud computing environment. The load balancing process normally emphasizes on optimal resource utilization, maximum response time, maximum throughput, and prevention of overload. In this scope of research, our study explores on the integration of load balancing process with virtual machine migration across multiple hosts which were determined by CPU utilization was implemented in this paper. There are {{two different types of}} resources, specifically low-powered and high-powered resources, which are based on Million Instructions per Second (MIPS) metrics. The minimal process execution time can be achieved if both types of resources are being evenly and efficiently matched and deploy onto suitable types of processing; i. e. low-powered or high-powered. Besides that, for a more efficient load balancing, the migration of virtual machines can be determined based on the current CPU utilization by following the thresholds where when the CPU usage reaches its 90 % and 10 % <b>thresholds</b> <b>marker.</b> Based on this idea, an algorithm in activating and deciding on the virtual machine migration operation is proposed, in which the overall load balancing process could be improved. Besides that, the performance of this technique is analyzed by using a Cloudsim simulator. Based on the analysis, positive results of the proposed algorithm are demonstrated, which shows the load balancing process is shown to have improved based on the distribution of virtual machines onto matching-type of resources, while a more efficient migration of virtual machines can be seen based on the defined CPU usage thresholds. Having a combination of these load balancing and migration techniques offers benefits that can avoid a long wait, make full use of resources and avoid idle resources. Minimal power consumption throughout the cloud platform will definitely lead to an efficient green cloud computing system...|$|R

Although using markers introduces knowledge about the buildings and their surroundings, how to automatically set the <b>thresholds</b> for <b>marker</b> extraction is still a problem. The relation between these thresholds and the knowledge of images (e.g., resolution) {{as well as the}} knowledge of the objects in the real world (e.g., the distribution rules of the objects) can be considered to improve threshold setting. For example, if the knowledge of interested buildings such as sizes and spacing is available, building sizes in the real world can be transformed to pixels in the image space, since resolutions of SAR images are usually provided. Thus, some parameters such as window sizes of detectors, area threshold to remove false alarms can adaptively be set. Moreover, this article provides a general framework for building detection. So far, we mainly apply it in detecting buildings with simple shapes. More complicated scenes may require more complex rules. How to extend the framework to detecting buildings with more complex shapes and how to solve building detection problem in environment with much disturbance, e.g., tree clutters, also need further research.|$|R

In this chapter, I make the case for the integral relationship between this engagement with girlhood and the political potency and feminist bravado of her novels.

40|$|URL] The goal of {{this study}} was to present a new {{perspective}} on the relationship between lipid metabolism and the intensity/duration of exercise and energy expenditure. The idea was to use the second lactate <b>threshold</b> as a <b>marker</b> of the best ratio between energy expenditure and duration of exercise. From the literature review and analyses of experimental data, it was demonstrated that the second lactate threshold mark is the point at which the best ratio occurs between substrate oxidation rate and duration of effort. This means that any low intensity exercise performed below the second lactate threshold will require more time to achieve the same energy expenditure as exercise performed at the second lactate threshold. On the other hand, exercise performed above the second lactate threshold has a higher substrate oxidation rate, but, due to the shorter time for which the effort can be sustained, the total energy expenditure is less. These considerations have important practical applications in training schedules for reducing body fat...|$|R

After the distance transform image was obtained (shown in Figure  6 e), another binary image can be generated by the threshold operations.

Therefore, {{the area of the}} cells in the binary image generated by the threshold operations (shown in Figure  6 f) was smaller than the area of the cells in the distance transform image (shown in Figure  6 e). These smaller foreground regions represent the markers of the cells as shown in Figure  6 f.

In the watershed transformation, the lighter gray maker spreads over all pixels of the upper cell while the darker gray marker spreads over all pixels of the bottom cell.

The surface detector array of the Pierre Auger Observatory can detect these types of cascades. The distinguishing signature for neutrino events {{is the presence of}} very inclined showers produced close to the ground (i. e., after having traversed a large amount of atmosphere). Up to now, the Pierre Auger Observatory did not find any candidate for a neutrino event. A very low rate of events potentially generated by neutrinos is a significant challenge for a detection technique and requires both sophisticated algorithms and high-resolution hardware. We present a trigger based on a pipeline artificial neural network (ANN) implemented in a large FPGA which after learning can recognize traces corresponding to special types of events.

In {{this study we}} proposed several approaches to estimate {{the total number of}} variants underlying these diseases. We assume that the variance explained by genetic markers (Vg) follow an exponential distribution, which is justified by previous studies on theories of adaptation. Our aim is to fit the observed distribution of Vg from GWAS to its theoretical distribution. The number of variants is obtained by the heritability divided by the estimated mean of the exponential distribution. In practice, due to limited sample sizes, there is insufficient power to detect variants with small effects. Therefore the power was taken into account in fitting. Besides considering the most significant variants, we also tried to relax the significance <b>threshold,</b> allowing more <b>markers</b> to be fitted. The effects of false positive variants were removed by considering the local false discovery rates. In addition, we developed an alternative approach by directly fitting the z-statistics from GWAS to its theoretical distribution. In all cases, the "winner's curse" effect was corrected analytically. Confidence intervals were also derived. Simulations were performed to compare and verify the performance of different estimators (which incorporates various means of winner's curse correction) and the coverage of the proposed analytic confidence intervals.

To investigate the correlation between the percent-age of metastatic tumor present in lymph nodes resected from patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC) and level of expression of 3 marker genes: pemphigus vulgaris antigen (PVA), parathyroid hormone– related peptide (PTHrP), and tumor-associated calcium signal transducer 1 (TACSTD 1). In addition, we investigated whether the level of expression of these 3 markers was associated with clinical outcomes for patients with HNSCC. Study Design. Retrospective analysis of previously harvested patient samples. Setting. The University of Pittsburgh. Subjects and Methods. A total of 448 lymph nodes from 92 patients with HNSCC were evaluated for expression of the gene markers PVA, PTHrP, and TACSTD 1 using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Confirmation of metastasis was determined by histologic examination. The expression level of these markers versus tumor percentage was analyzed. Results. All 3 markers were studied independently and were associated with tumor percentage in metastatic lymph nodes. PVA had the strongest correlation, followed by PTHrP and then TACSTD 1. PVA levels had a trend toward association with clinical outcome, specifically time to death caused by cancer, but this was confounded by tumor stage. Conclusion. All 3 tumor gene markers were associated with percentage of tumor cells in metastatic lymph nodes. PVA had the strongest correlation.

40|$|Fragile X {{syndrome}} (FXS) is {{the most}} common single gene cause of intellectual disability and autism worldwide. FXS is caused by a long (> 200) trinucleotide CGG-repeat expansion on the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR 1) gene located on the long arm of the X chromosome, and through epigenetic gene silencing and alterations to the production of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), leads to a distinct neurological profile of abnormal synaptic structure and neuroplasticity. While FXS itself affects ~ 4000 individuals, it is estimated that as many as 1 in 209 females and 1 in 400 males are premutation (PM) ‘carriers’ of the FXS. For PM-carriers, the expanded CGG-repeat expansion (55 - 199) can lead to neurotoxic effects and progress to a late onset neurodegenerative disorder associated with executive dysfunction, dementia, tremor and ataxia, called fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). Furthermore, female PM-carriers are at increased risk of developing premature menopause associated with fragile X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI). While much of the research to date has focussed on male PM-carriers and late-onset neurodegenerative disorders, the presence of neurocognitive and neurobehavioural manifestations among asymptomatic female PM-carriers is less well understood, but has been controversial. Although recent studies have reported difficulties in executive function, visuospatial processing and psychiatric functioning, and greater than hitherto expected prevalence of later dementia and parkinsonism-related symptoms, it remains unclear the extent to which subtle cognitive and motor manifestations are a forme fruste for later onset of more severe neurodegenerative decline, or a stable developmental phenotype. The overarching aim of this thesis was to investigate neurobehavioural profiles in adult female PM-carriers using hypothesis-driven neuromotor and neurocognitive measures that are known to be sensitive to subtle signs of dysfunction in prefrontal and cerebellar neural networks. Chapter 3 presented the first investigation of the effects of cognitive dual-task interference (counting backward by 3 s or 7 s) on spatiotemporal gait characteristics in female PM-carriers (22 - 55 years old) and age-matched controls with normal alleles, and explored relationships between dual-task gait interference and age and CGG-repeat length. The findings from Chapter 3 on gait control revealed significant dual-task costs on spatiotemporal gait characteristics in female PM-carriers compared to controls, and an interaction between age and CGG-repeat length for dual-task related gait variability. These findings indicated CGG-dose dependent effects on gait automaticity during dual-task performance, suggestive of dysfunction in cerebellar cognitive and motor networks in female PM-carriers. In Chapter 4, {{the extent to which these}} neuromotor at-risk profiles extended to postural control were investigated using hypothesis-driven measures of postural stability in response to manipulation of visual, proprioceptive and cognitive input. The results from Chapter 4 revealed significantly increased medio-lateral sway during concurrent performance of an excluded-letter-verbal-fluency task in female PM-carriers compared to controls, with CGG repeat length moderating the relationship between age and postural instability. Together, these findings suggest that measures of gait and postural control under dual-task interference may show clinical utility as outcome measures in future pharmaceutical interventions in the female PM. To further explore the role of cerebellar-cortico involvement in cognitive and psychiatric symptoms in female PM-carriers, the next section of the thesis (Chapter 5) examined the extent to which female PM-carriers showed deficits in specific subdomains of executive function, and their interrelationships with symptoms of ADHD, anxiety and depression. These findings demonstrated a core deficit in response inhibition alongside elevated symptoms of ADHD and social anxiety in females with the PM. Importantly, measures of response inhibition and working memory were significantly associated with self-reported psychiatric symptoms, and a large proportion of female carriers with poor executive functioning exceeded <b>threshold</b> <b>markers</b> for probable caseness of a mental disorder. While these findings raised the possibility that female PM-carriers may be at-risk of developing a cognitive-affective disorder, the range of cognitive, visuospatial and affective impairments is most consistent with cerebellar-cognitive affective syndrome. Chapter 6 explored implicit sequence learning impairments that may tie in a range of cognitive, visuospatial and affective symptoms. Although female PM-carriers showed preserved implicit learning, the slowed reaction time and poorer awareness of the repeating sequence were suggestive of reduced automaticity. Importantly, there were several important associations between sequence learning performance and a range of executive function, visuospatial and affective symptoms suggestive of cerebellar-cognitive affective syndrome in some females with the PM allele. The lack of age- or CGG-repeat length dependent associations with sequencing performance and cognitive-affective profiles suggests that this profile may arise from other developmental, molecular (e. g., FMRP, epigenetics) and/or environmental (psychosocial stress, carer burden) factors. The findings from this thesis converge to suggest at least two pathways, one in which developmental mechanisms may lead to a subtle cognitive-affective profile associated with disruption to cortico-cerebellar pathways, and the other to neurotoxic and ageing effects in those with long CGG-repeat lengths on neural regions underpinning stepping automaticity and postural stability. This novel hypothesis-driven approach to teasing apart cerebellar cognitive and motor profiles offers potential in identifying those PM-carrier women who are at increased risk for neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative involvement. It will be important for future longitudinal studies to begin to isolate distinct subgroups and identify sensitive risk biomarkers in the female PM that might portend more severe neurological and neuropsychiatric impairments across the lifespan.

40|$|Background: Total {{lymphocyte}} count (TLC) {{has been proposed}} {{as an alternative to}} CD 4 percent for deciding when to initiate antiretroviral therapy (ART) in HIV-infected children in resource-limited settings. However, few studies have evaluated TLC thresholds at which ART should be considered or compared TLC with CD 4 percent monitoring. Methods: Longitudinal data on 3917 HIV-infected children were pooled from observational and randomised studies conducted in Europe and the USA. The 12 -month risks of death and AIDS by most recent TLC and age were estimated by parametric survival models, based on measurements before ART initiation or during zidovudine monotherapy. Risks were derived and compared at TLC and CD 4 percent thresholds for starting ART recommended in WHO (2003) guidelines. Findings: TLC was a powerful predictor of the risk of disease progression despite a weak correlation with CD 4 percent (r= 0. 08 - 0. 19 dependent on age). For children> 2 years, the 12 -month risk of death and AIDS increased sharply at TLC values < 1, 500 - 2, 000 cells/mm, with little trend at higher values. Younger children had higher risks and TLC was less prognostic. Mortality risk at TLC thresholds recommended by WHO was substantially higher than at corresponding CD 4 percent <b>thresholds.</b> Comparing the <b>markers</b> at <b>threshold</b> values at which mortality risks are approximately equal, TLC was as effective as CD 4 percent in identifying children prior to death but resulted in starting ART slightly earlier. Interpretation: In this population, TLC was a strong predictor of short-term disease progression, being only marginally less predictive than CD 4 percent. Confirmatory studies in resource-limited settings are required to identify the most cost-effective markers to guide ART initiation. Last updated: 02 - 08 - 2005...|$|R
40|$|Background. The {{occurrence}} of microalbuminuria in {{type 1 diabetes}} is strongly predictive of renal and cardiovascular disease and is still likely to occur despite improvements in glycemic control. A better understanding of microalbuminuria is required to inform new interventions. We determined the incidence and risk factors for microalbuminuria [albumin excretion rate (AER) 20 to 200 mug/min] in the EURODIAB Prospective Complications Study. Methods. This is a seven-year follow-up (between 1988 and 1991) of 1134 normoalbuminuric men and women (aged 15 to 60) with type I diabetes from 31 European centers. Risk factors and AER were measured centrally. Results. The incidence of microalbuminuria was 12. 6 % over 7. 3 years. Independent baseline risk factors were HbA(lc) (7. 1 vs. 6. 2 %. P = 0. 0001) and AER (9. 6 vs. 7. 8 mug/min, P = 0. 0001) and, independent of these, fasting triglyceride (0. 99 vs. 0. 88 mmol/L, P = 0. 01), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (3. 5 vs. 3. 2 mmol/L, P = 0. 02). body mass index (24. 0 vs. 23. 4 kg/m(2), P = 0. 01), and waist to hip ratio (WHR; 0. 85 vs. 0. 83, P = 0. 009). Triglyceride and WHR risk factors were nearly as strong as AER in predicting microalbuminuria (standardized regression effects of 1. 3 for triglyceride and WHR and 1. 5 for AER). Blood pressure at follow-up, but not at baseline, was also raised in those who progressed. There {{was no evidence of}} a threshold of HbA(lc) on microalbuminuria risk. Conclusions. The incidence of microalbuminuria in patients with type 1 diabetes remains high, and there is no apparent glycemic <b>threshold</b> for it. <b>Markers</b> of insulin resistance, such as triglyceride and WHR, are strong risk factors.

40|$|Aims: Markers of {{subclinical}} {{target organ}} damage (TOD) increase cardiovascular (CV) risk prediction beyond traditional risk factors. We wanted to establish <b>thresholds</b> for three <b>markers</b> of TOD based on absolute CV risk in different risk chart categories. Methods and results: In {{a cohort of}} 1968 healthy patients, we measured urine albumin creatine ratio (UACR), pulse wave velocity (PWV), left ventricular mass index (LVMI) and traditional risk factors. Patients were categorized according to Systemic Coronary Evaluation (SCORE), European Society of Hypertension/European Society of Cardiology (ESH/ESC) risk chart and Framingham risk score (FRS) and three corresponding endpoints were recorded: CV death (SCORE-endpoint), a composite of CV death and nonfatal myocardial infarction and stroke (ESH/ESC-endpoint), and a composite that also included hospital admissions for ischemic heart disease, heart failure, peripheral arterial disease and transient cerebral ischemic attack (FRS-endpoint). During a median follow of 12. 8 years events totaled 81 SCORE-, 153 ESH/ESC-endpoints and 280 FRS-endpoints. Thresholds for UACR, PWV and LVMI are presented using 10 -year risk threshold of more than 5 % (SCORE-endpoint), more than 10 %(ESH/ESC-endpoint) and more than 20 %(FRS-endpoint), which indicated high risk and eligibility for primary prevention. As an example, the threshold was 0. 83  mg/mmol, 13. 7  m/s and 119  g/m 2 for UACR, PWV and LVMI, respectively, for patients at moderate added risk according to ESH/ESC risk chart. Conclusion: Thresholds for UACR, PVW and LVMI based on absolute risk have primarily impact on risk stratification in patients with intermediate risk. The thresholds for PWV and LVMI in patients with moderate risk according to the ESH/ESC risk chart were similar to currently applied thresholds whereas the threshold for UACR was considerable lower than the threshold for microalbuminuria...|$|R

Vibration treatment {{has been used in}} physiotherapy to reduce pain and oedema, and to facilitate the repair of injured tissue. This study tested the hypothesis that vibration treatment would reduce the symptoms of muscle damage such as DOMS and swelling and enhance recovery from muscle damage induced by eccentric exercise. Each arm of 15 young men (24 +/- 3. 8 yrs) performed 10 sets of 6 maximal eccentric contractions of the elbow flexors separated by 4 weeks in a counterbalanced order. One arm received a 30 -minute vibration treatment at 30 minute, 1, 2, 3, and 4 days after exercise, and the other arm did not receive the treatment and was used as the control. Criterion measures consisted of maximal voluntary isometric and isokinetic strength of the elbow flexors, elbow joint angles and range of motion (ROM), upper arm circumference, muscle thickness by B-mode ultrasonography, muscle soreness, pressure pain <b>threshold,</b> and blood <b>markers</b> or muscle damage and inflammation. These measurements except for the blood measures were taken 1 day and immediately prior to exercise, and immediately, 1 hour, and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7 days after exercise.

To examine acute effects of the treatment, changes in the measures before and immediately after each treatment session were analyzed by a Student t-test.

A total of 343 S 2 : 4 lines extracted from those populations were phenotyped for flowering time, plant height, grain yield and panicle weight, and genotyped with an average density of one marker per 44. 8 kb. The relative effect of the linkage disequilibrium (LD) and minor allele frequency (MAF) <b>thresholds</b> for selecting <b>markers,</b> the relative size of the training population (TP) and of the validation population (VP), the selected trait and the genomic prediction models (frequentist and Bayesian) on the accuracy of GEBVs was investigated in 540 cross validation experiments with 100 replicates. The effect of kinship between the training and validation populations was tested in an additional set of 840 cross validation experiments with a single genomic prediction model. LD was high (average r 2 = 0. 59 at 25 kb) and decreased slowly, distribution of allele frequencies at individual loci was markedly skewed toward unbalanced frequencies (MAF average value 15. 2 % and median 9. 6 %), and differentiation between the four synthetic populations was low (FST ≤ 0. 06). The accuracy of GEBV across all cross validation experiments ranged from 0. 12 to 0. 54 {{with an average of}} 0. 30. Significant differences in accuracy were observed among the different levels of each factor investigated. Phenotypic traits had the biggest effect, {{and the size of the}} incidence matrix had the smallest. Significant first degree interaction was observed for GEBV accuracy between traits and all the other factors studied, and between prediction models and LD, MAF and composition of the TP.

An investigational POC test based on a multiplexed immunoassay was developed by Meso Scale Diagnostics, LLC (MSD), with the objective to make a more sensitive rapid test that can also subtype influenza A viruses (1977 H 1, H 3, and H 5). Between February and November 2010, we conducted a prospective multicenter study at four hospitals in Vietnam and compared the performance of this test {{to that of the}} WHO/CDC real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) on nasal and throat swab specimens from patients presenting with influenza-like illness. Five hundred sixty-three adults and children with a median age of 25 months were enrolled. Sensitivity and specificity of the test with combined results from nasal and throat swab samples were 74. 0 % (131 / 177) and 99. 7 % (351 / 352), respectively, compared to RT-PCR. The POC test was as sensitive for influenza virus B as for influenza virus A (74. 4 % [64 / 86] versus 73. 6 % [67 / 91]). The positivity rate was associated with lower cycle <b>threshold</b> values (a <b>marker</b> for higher viral loads), sample type (73. 6 % for nasal swab versus 52. 4 % for throat swab), and younger age. A total of 210 (18. 7 %) out of 1, 126 MSD tests failed, and for 34 (6 %) of patients, both test samples failed (these were excluded from the performance analysis). Subtyping could be assessed only for influenza virus A/H 3 N 2, as 1977 H 1 N 1 was not circulating at the time and no H 5 N 1 -infected patients were enrolled, and was successful only in 9 / 54 patients infected with H 3 influenza virus who had a positive POC test result for influenza virus A. This novel POC test provided highly sensitive detection of influenza viruses A and B compared to the reported sensitivities of other rapid tests. However, 18. 7 % of tests failed for technical reasons and subtyping for H 3 was poor. Drawbacks to the technology include the requirement for a dedicated reader instrument and the need for continual updating of subtyping antibodies within the test arra...|$|R
40|$|Automatic tongue, velum (i. e., soft palate), and {{pharyngeal}} movement {{tracking systems}} provide a significant {{benefit for the}} analysis of dynamic speech movements. Studies have been conducted using ultrasound, x-ray, and Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) to examine the dynamic nature of the articulators during speech. Simulating the movement of the tongue, velum, and pharynx is often limited by image segmentation obstacles, where, movements of the velar structures are segmented through manual tracking. These methods are extremely time-consuming, coupled with inherent noise, motion artifacts, air interfaces, and refractions often complicate the process of computer-based automatic tracking. Furthermore, image segmentation and processing techniques of velopharyngeal structures often suffer from leakage issues related to the poor image quality of the MRI and the lack of recognizable boundaries between the velum and pharynx during contact moments. Computer-based tracking algorithms are developed to overcome these disadvantages by utilizing machine learning techniques and corresponding speech signals that may be considered prior information. The {{purpose of this study is}} to illustrate a methodology to track the velum and pharynx from a MRI sequence using the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) by analyzing the corresponding audio signals. Auditory models such as MFCC have been widely used in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems. Our method uses customized version of the traditional approach for audio feature extraction in order to extract visual feature from the outer boundaries of the velum and the pharynx marked (selected pixel) by a novel method, The reduced audio features helps to shrink the search space of HMM and improve the system performance.   Three hundred consecutive images were tagged by the researcher. Two hundred of these images and the corresponding audio features (5 seconds) were used to train the HMM and a 2. 5 second long audio file was used to test the model. The error rate was measured by calculating minimum distance between predicted and actual markers. Our model was able to track and animate dynamic articulators during the speech process in real-time with an overall accuracy of 81 % considering one pixel <b>threshold.</b> The predicted <b>markers</b> (pixels) indicated the segmented structures, even though the contours of contacted areas were fuzzy and unrecognizable.   M.

40|$|Aims: To {{assess the}} {{diagnostic}} value of CEA and CYFRA 21 - 1 (cytokeratin 19 fragments) in serum and pleural fluid in non small cell lung cancer with malignant pleural effusion (MPE). Settings and Design: Two subsets of patients were recruited with lymphocytic exudative effusion, one subset constituted diagnosed patients of NSCLC with malignant pleural effusion {{and the other}} subset of constituted with Tubercular pleural effusion. Methods and Material : CYFRA 21 - 1 and CEA levels were measured using Electrochemilumiscence Immunoassay (ECLIA). The test principle used the Sandwich method. For both the tests, results are determined via a calibration curve which is instrument specifically generated by 2 - point calibration and a master curve provided via reagent barcode. Statistical Analysis Used: All data are expressed as means ± SD and percentage. All the parametric variables were analysed by student-t test where as non parametric variables were compared by Mann-Whitney U-test Statistical significance was accepted for P values < 0. 05. Software used were SPSS 11. 5, and MS excel 2007. In order to compare {{the performance of the}} tumor markers, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed and compared with area under the curve (AUC). The <b>threshold</b> for each <b>marker</b> was selected based on the best diagnostic efficacy having achieved equilibrium between sensitivity and specificity. Results: In cases serum CYFRA 21 - 1 levels had mean value of 34. 1 ± 29. 9 with a range of 1. 6 - 128. 3 where as in controls serum CYFRA 21 - 1 levels had mean value of 1. 9 ± 1. 0 with a range of 0. 5 - 4. 7. In cases serum CEA levels had mean value of 24. 9 ± 47. 3 with a range of 1. 0, 267. 9 where as in controls serum CEA levels had mean value of 1. 9 ± 1. 4 with a range of 0. 2 - 6. 8. The difference in the means of serum CYFRA 21 -l (P = 0. 000) and CEA (P = 0. 046) were statistically significant. In cases pleural fluid CYFRA 21 - 1 levels had mean value of 160. 1 ± 177. 1 with a range of 5. 4 - 517. 2 where as in controls pleural fluid CYFRA 21 - 1 levels had mean value of 15. 9 ± 5. 7 with a range of 7. 2 - 29. 6. In cases CEA pleural fluid levels had mean value of 89. 8 ± 207. 4 with a range of 1. 0 - 861. 2 where as in controls CEA levels had mean value of 2. 5 ± 2. 3 with a range of 1 - 8. 9. The difference in the means of CYERA 21 - 1 (P = 0. 001) between cases and controls is statistically significant.
