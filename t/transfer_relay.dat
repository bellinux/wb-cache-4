EPR spectroscopy indicates that FS 0 has a high spin ground state (S = 32) in its reduced form, resulting in an EPR spectrum with a peak at g ∼ 5. 0. The cluster is predicted to be in close proximity to the molybdo-bis(pyranopterin guanine dinucleotide) (Mo-bisPGD) cofactor, which provides the site of dimethyl sulfoxide reduction. Comparison with nitrate reductase A (NarGHI) indicates that a sequence of residues (18 CTVNC 22) plays a role in both FS 0 and Mo-bisPGD coordination. A DmsAΔN 21 mutant prevented Mo-bisPGD binding and resulted in a degenerate [3 Fe- 4 S] cluster form of FS 0 being assembled. DmsA belongs to the Type II subclass of Mo-bisPGD-containing catalytic subunits that is distinguished from the Type I subclass by having three rather than two residues between the first two Cys residues coordinating FS 0 and a conserved Arg residue rather than a Lys residue following the fourth cluster coordinating Cys.

The [NiFe] hydrogenases use an {{electron}} <b>transfer</b> <b>relay</b> of three FeS clusters - proximal, medial and distal - {{to release the}} electrons from the principal reaction, H 2 → 2 H + + 2 e -, that occurs at the Ni-Fe catalytic site. This site is normally inactivated by O 2, but the subclass of O 2 -tolerant [NiFe] hydrogenases are able to counter this inactivation {{through the agency of}} an unusual and unprecedented proximal cluster, with composition [Fe 4 S 3 (S cys) 6], that is able to transfer two electrons back to the Ni-Fe site and effect crucial reduction of O 2 -derived species and thereby reactivate the Ni-Fe site. This proximal cluster gates both the direction and the number of electrons flowing through it, and can reverse the normal flow during O 2 attack. The unusual structures and redox potentials of the proximal cluster are known: a structural change in the proximal cluster causes changes in its electron-transfer potentials. Using protein structure analysis and density functional simulations, this paper identifies a closed protonic system comprising the proximal cluster, some contiguous residues, and a proton reservoir, and proposes that it is activated by O 2 -induced conformational change at the Ni-Fe site. This change is linked to a key histidine residue which then causes protonation of the proximal cluster, and migration of this proton to a key μ 3 -S atom. The resulting SH group causes the required structural change at the proximal cluster, modifying its redox potentials, and leads to the reversed electron flow back to the Ni-Fe site. This cycle is reversible, and the protons involved are independent of those used or produced in reactions at the active site. Existing experimental support for this model is cited, and new testing experiments are suggested...|$|E

40|$|A TiO 2 /VIS {{system was}} {{developed}} to photobleach 15 organic dyes with varying chemical structures using visible light. Triphenylmethane dyes were observed to be easier to bleach than anthraquinone dyes. Compounds with ionized groups had a faster photobleaching rate, possibly because of a higher affinity for the TiO 2 surface. Photobleaching kinetics of the dyes could be approximated as a pseudo-first-order reaction. The TiO 2 /VIS method was ineffective {{for the treatment of}} poorly water-soluble solvent dyes. The TiO 2 /VIS method also suffered from retardation by the presence of acetonitrile, alcohols, HCl, H 3 PO 4, humic substances and dissolved organic matter. Similar retardation was also observed in the TiO 2 /O 2 /UV system for the treatment of toxic organochlorines. When applied to a mixture of compounds, the TiO 2 /O 2 /UV system selectively favored the decomposition of methylene blue. For example, 4 -chlorophenol was barely degraded until the methylene blue was consumed. ^ Another innovative technique, the photosensitized reduction method, degraded 2, 3 -dichlorodioxin, DDT and toxaphene effectively via an electron <b>transfer</b> <b>relay</b> mechanism which involved 2 ̆ 2 visible light 2 ̆ 2, a reductant and a photosensitizer. When sunlight was used, photodechlorination of perchloroethylene was about 14 times faster than when a 150 -watt spotlight was used. Sodium borohydride was found to be a superior sacrificial reductant to triethylamine. Humic substances, though retardants in TiO 2 catalyzed photo-oxidation, became effective reductants in the dye-photosensitized approach. Some nontoxic natural dyes were good photosensitizers, with about the same efficiency as methylene green. Riboflavin was about 10 times faster. When Chlorofresh (copper chlorophyllin) was used as the photosensitizer and triethanolamine was used as the reductant, the relative photoreduction rates decreased in correspondence with the order of electronegativity of the following compounds: hexachloroethane 3 ̆e carbon tetrachloride 3 ̆e bromoform 3 ̆e perchloroethene 3 ̆e 1, 2 -dibromoethane. Moreover, glycerin accelerated the reaction, perhaps by dissociation of chlorophyll (the photosensitizer) aggregates. Simple dechlorinated products were observed. A sequential dechlorination mechanistic pathway was proposed. Overall, this research has proven the feasibility of utilizing sunlight, humic substances and nontoxic dyes to render a toxic compound less toxic and to enhance the natural carbon regeneration rates. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{photooxidation}} {{of toxic}} organic chemicals to {{carbon dioxide and}} dilute mineral acids using sunlight as an energy source and nanosize semiconductors to catalyze the process. The authors efforts {{in the first year}} of this program focused on demonstration of three important attributes of nanosize: MoS{sub 2 } as used to photocatalyze the oxidation of organics in solution: (1) Ability to utilize visible light to initiate photo-redox reactions in solution. (2) Successful oxidative destruc-tion of organic pollutants. (3) Structural and chemical integrity during and after the removal of organic pollutants (i. e. no photochemical degradation of the catalyst). To these ends the authors have used nanosize MoS{sub 2 } of three dif-ferent sizes and associated band gaps, and studied photoredox reactions catalyzed with nanosize MoS{sub 2 } that had been both dispersed in solution and supported on a macroscopic powder. The latter would be the method of choice for use in practical photocatalytic applications. As they emphasized in the original proposal, MoS{sub 2 } in nanosize form can be tuned to absorb various amounts of the solar spectrum. In figure 1 they show the relationship of the absorption edge of the various materials studied as photocatalysts relative to the natural solar spectrum. Their have demonstrated electron and hole transfer from nanosize MoS{sub 2 } using visible light. In order to oxidize organic impurities using this part of the spectrum they needed to add an agent, bypyridine (bpy), which could accept an electron and be reduced. In actual applications they anticipate the de of sacrificial electron acceptor played by the byp could be played by soluble heavy metal ion pollutants, (e. g. Pb, Cd) which, when reduced, would precipitate out of solution, thus purifying the water and driving the reaction. Using liquid chromatography analysis they have demonstrated that bypridine binds strongly to nanosize MoS{sub 2 } and acts like an electron <b>transfer</b> <b>relay</b> to effect charge separation. The hole left behind on MoS{sub 2 } is then used to oxidize the organic im-purities. In its reduced form bypridine complexes to the oxidized organic impurity and precipitates out of solution. The authors studied the chemistry of this process by high pressure liquid chromatography which separates each of the chemicals in the solution from the MoS{sub 2 } photocatalyst. The results of this experiment are shown in figure 2. The initially present organic impurity peak at t- 5. 2 minutes (an organic chloride) is destroyed as more bypridine is added until it cannot be detected. However, the amount of nanosize MoS{sub 2 } remains un-changed, as measured by the area under the MoS{sub 2 } elation peak. Another, broader, organic peak observed in this figure at t 4. 7 minutes also is destroyed by the MoS{sub 2 } as additional bpy is added, and, at higher levels of bpy (not shown) this chemical is completely oxidized and precipitated out of solution as well. The white precipitate which forms can be removed from the solvent. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} outage {{probability}} and the throughput of relay networks with joint information and energy <b>transfer</b> where the <b>relay</b> harvests energy from transmitted radio-frequency (RF) signal of the source. Considering different power consumption models, we derive the outage probability {{of the systems}} for both adaptive and non-adaptive power allocations at the relay. With a total energy consumption constraint at the source, we provide closed-form expressions for the optimal time sharing and power allocation between the source energy and information transfer signals. The analytical and simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of joint energy and information transfer systems in different condition...|$|R
40|$|Although Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is {{a widely}} {{deployed}} and successful protocol, it shows some limitations in present-day environments. In particular, it is unable to exploit multiple (physical or logical) paths between two hosts. This paper presents PATTHEL, a session-layer solution designed for parallelizing stream data transfers. Parallelization is achieved by striping the data flow among multiple TCP channels. This solution does not require invasive changes to the networking stack and can be implemented entirely in user space. Moreover, it is flexible enough to suit several scenarios - e. g. {{it can be used}} to split a data <b>transfer</b> among multiple <b>relays</b> within a peer-to-peer overlay networ...|$|R
40|$|We {{assume that}} the {{entanglement}} passes from a given pair of particles to another one thus establishing the <b>relay</b> <b>transfer</b> of entanglement along the chain. Therefore we introduce the relay entanglement as a sum of all pairwise entanglements in a spin chain. For more detailed {{study the effects of}} different pairwise entanglements, we use the partial sums collecting entanglements between the spins separated by up to a certain number of nodes. The problem of entangled cluster formation is considered and the geometric mean entanglement is introduced as a measure of quantum correlations in a cluster. Generally, the life-time of a cluster decreases with an increase in its size. Comment: 18 pages, 9 figure...|$|R

The saddles and mochilas were {{standardised}} {{and made the}} same so they would work from one horse to another. When full of mail and telegrams it weighed about 20 pounds. The rider would carry additionally a canteen of water, a gun, and a small bible which included the solemn loyalty oath {{he had to take}} as a precondition to becoming a rider. If a horse became injured beyond use or was killed, the rider would strip the mochila with its mail from the saddle and walk to the next <b>relay</b> <b>transfer</b> station.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In energy {{harvesting}} communications, users transmit messages using energy harvested from nature {{during the course}} of communication. With an optimum transmit policy, the performance of the system depends only on the energy arrival profiles. In this paper, we introduce the concept of energy cooperation, where a user wirelessly transmits a portion of its energy to another {{energy harvesting}} user. This enables shaping and optimization of the energy arrivals at the energy-receiving node, and improves the overall system performance, despite the loss incurred in energy transfer. We consider several basic multiuser network structures with energy harvesting and wireless energy <b>transfer</b> capabilities: <b>relay</b> channel, two-way channel and multiple access channel. We determine energy management policies that maximize the system throughput within a given duration using a Lagrangian formulation and the resulting KKT optimality conditions. We develop a two-dimensional directional water-filling algorithm which optimally controls the flow of harvested energy in two dimensions: in time (from past to future) and among users (from energy-transferring to energy-receiving) and show that a generalized version of this algorithm achieves the boundary of the capacity region of the two-way channel.
