5|$|While {{the key to}} Albany's {{economic}} prosperity in the 19th century was <b>transportation,</b> <b>industry</b> and business also played a role. Largely thanks to the city's Dutch and German roots, beer was one of its biggest commodities. Beverwyck Brewery, originally known as Quinn and Nolan (Nolan being mayor of Albany 1878â€“1883), was the last remaining brewer from that time when it closed in 1972. The city's location at {{the east end of}} the Erie Canal gave it unparalleled access to both raw products and a captive customer base in the west. Albany was known for its publishing houses, and to some extent, still is. Albany was second only to Boston in the number of books produced for most of the 19th century. Iron foundries in both the north and south ends of the city brought thousands of immigrants to the city. To this day, one can see many intricate wrought-iron details on older buildings. The iron industry waned by the 1890s due to increased costs associated with a newly unionized workforce and the opening of mines in the Mesabi Range in Minnesota.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} value {{relevance}} of earnings in four <b>transportation</b> <b>industries</b> (railroad, <b>transportation</b> by land, shipping, and warehouse). The business environments in those industries {{are not the}} same as those in manufacturing industry, since a part of transportation business in influenced by the industrial regulation. Moreover, the <b>transportation</b> <b>industries</b> have a characteristic of the network industry. This paper especially focuses on the issue whether the value relevance of earnings in <b>transportation</b> <b>industries</b> is different from those in the manufacturing industry. First, by adopting various regression models and by examining across industries and among periods, we find some distinctive results in the <b>transportation</b> <b>industries.</b> In the railroad industry, earnings is valued as if investors expect that earnings will be smoothed by the rate-regulation. On the other hand, although earnings is not so highly relevant in the shipping industry, earnings is value relevant in recent period. Second, the value relevance of earnings in <b>transportation</b> <b>industries</b> does not depend on the relative performance compared with that of the manufacturing industry. We cannot detect the evidence that the performance of <b>transportation</b> <b>industries</b> is evaluated in comparison with the manufacturing industry. Third, in railroad and transportation-by-land industries, the value relevance of earnings differs in the size of network, which is measured by sales volume. In some industry-periods, while earnings for the larger firms is value relevant, earnings for the smaller firms is not relevant. The observed results in this paper re-confirm that the value relevance of earnings considerably differs in industries and period. ...|$|R
