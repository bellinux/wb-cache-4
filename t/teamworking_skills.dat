40|$|Resuscitation is {{the process}} medical teams use {{in an attempt to}} save a patient’s life when they have {{suffered}} a cardiopulmonary arrest. It is a stressful, time-pressured procedure, and unfortunately is often futile. Care of a patient in the emergency setting is particularly prone to errors and adverse events for a variety of reasons. These include the time-pressured decision making, increased rate of patient interventions, and the fact that teams are “assembled” by the emergency call that may have never worked together, or even met each other, before. Recent analysis of incident reports specifically from resuscitation attempts suggests that the majority of incidents relate to issues with the resuscitation team, problems related to human performance, and incidents relating to malfunctioning or absent equipment. One of the aims of this thesis is to look at ways to address these issues, and reduce rates of adverse events and critical incidents at resuscitation attempts. I will specifically look at the areas of non-technical <b>teamworking</b> <b>skills,</b> team training with environmental risk assessment, and the design of ergonomic equipment. In Chapter 4 I will describe the process of development and evaluation of a tool to assess non-technical <b>teamworking</b> <b>skills</b> in resuscitation teams. When this tool was initially developed, no other tools had been published. However, another tool has subsequently been made available, therefore in Chapter 5 I will compare our tool, OSCAR, with this other tool, called TEAM. In Chapter 6 I describe the process of in situ simulation for resuscitation training. I organised resuscitation team simulations as part of a training programme, and gathered participant feedback on the training. I also describe some of the unanticipated benefits of this training, such as risk assessment of the ward environment. In Chapters 7 and 8 I describe two studies that were undertaken to evaluate the newly designed Resus:Station. Specifically I assessed its use during simulated cardiac arrest scenarios, and when nursing staff performed a stock check of the trolley. Imperial Users onl...|$|E
40|$|The UK {{government}} {{is not alone in}} recognising the growing demands of the labour market for graduates with enhanced <b>teamworking</b> <b>skills</b> who can think on their feet and be innovative in a global economic environment (QAA, 2012). As a result the growth of enterprise and entrepreneurship initiatives in Higher Education has seen a rapid rise, initially in the USA and subsequently across Europe and Asia (Katz, 2003). The assumption being that a primary value of Higher Education lies in the provision of a clear route to employment or self-employment for its graduates. Distinct measurement of the impact of Entrepreneurship initiatives to satisfy requirements for accountability can be problematic however, as impact on business start-up rates may lag graduation by some considerable period, entrepreneurial intent may be actually diminished, and enterprising skills may be conflated with employability.

To date, the regulatory documents for healthcare education in the United Kingdom have not been examined for common learning outcomes; information {{that could be used to}} inform such a statement and to identify opportunities for interprofessional learning. Methods: A mapping of the outcomes/standards required by five, UK, health profession regulatory bodies was undertaken. This involved the identification of common outcomes, a keyword search and classification of common outcomes/standards; presented as themes and subthemes. Results: Seven themes were identified: knowledge for practice, skills for practice, ethical approach, professionalism, continuing professional development (CPD), patient-centered approach and <b>teamworking</b> <b>skills,</b> representing 22 subthemes. Each subtheme links back to the outcomes/standards in the regulatory documents. Conclusions: This study identifies the key areas of overlap in outcomes/standards expected of selected healthcare graduates in the United Kingdom. The mapping provides a framework for informing prequalifying IPE curricula, for example, identifying possible foci for interprofessional education outcomes and associated learning opportunities. It allows reference back to the standards set by regulatory bodies, a requirement for all institutions involved in health profession education. NHS Education for Scotlan...|$|E

The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the attitudes towards shared learning of undergraduate dental students and trainee dental technicians in a university dental school/hospital in the United Kingdom. Twenty-five trainee dental technicians and 75 undergraduate dental students took part in the study over five academic years. Data were collected using structured questionnaires. A 100 % response rate was achieved from the questionnaires.

40|$|Mobile instant {{messaging}} (MIM) {{has become an}} essential part of everyday life in this digital era. This current trend has been widespread among young adults in developed and developing nations as a result of overwhelming smartphone penetration. Therefore, it is not surprising to find students at tertiary level, whose lives revolve around gadgets and devices hence often referred to as ‘digital natives’, to be particularly influenced by technology in the way they communicate. For a discipline such as engineering which places an emphasis on communication and <b>teamworking</b> <b>skills,</b> greater social connectedness and positive attitude towards group may promote ‘situated learning’ where learning occurs outside the classroom. However, the language teacher often has little knowledge of the frequency of communication students engage in, how they connect among peers in the same group and students’ attitude towards their group because most of this kind of communication takes place outside of the classroom. Thus, it is imperative that English language practitioners, who teach language and communication skills to technical students, study how elements of social connectedness and attitude towards group among students are related to the way students communicate in a mobile environment using {{instant messaging}}.

In {{this area of}} clinical care, collective responsibility, team working and communication between health professionals {{have been identified as}} key elements in safe clinical practice. To date, there is limited research evidence as to how best to deliver teaching and learning of these competencies to practitioners of the future. An interprofessional workshop to facilitate learning of knowledge, core competencies, communication and team working skills in paediatric drug prescribing and administration at undergraduate level was developed and evaluated. The practical, ward-based workshop was delivered to 4 th year medical and 3 rd year nursing students and evaluated using a pre and post workshop questionnaire with open-ended response questions.

40|$|Abstract- University {{professors are}} {{expected}} to hold down (at least) two main jobs- teaching and research, sometimes {{at the expense of}} performing less than optimally on one or the other. In this work-in-progress, we are exploring the concept of combining teaching and research activities in the classroom to improve quality and productivity in both areas. The combination is being addressed by incorporating research tasks and results into a product design course. The evolution of such courses is overviewed and references to web resources are provided for those interested in exploring the subject in more depth. Index Terms- teaching, teamwork, product design, research Over the past three years, the author has developed several courses designed to expose students to teamworking as well as the technical skills needed in developing sophisticated electronic products. Beginning in the Fall of 1997, he co-taught an advanced VLSI course in which different students designed different parts of a biomedical telemetry IC with baseband filtering, temperature sensing, and on-chip radio transmitter circuits. Several lessons were learned in this effort, including the realization that such large-scale, team-oriented projects are difficult to complete without meticulous planning and oversight {{on the part of the}} instructor. In the Fall of 1998, a new course was developed to teach <b>teamworking</b> <b>skills</b> through the design, construction, and testing of a complete 900 MHz digital cordless telephone in a single semester [1]. A class of 14 seniors and 5 graduates was divided into two competing ‘companies’, with each divided into four teams responsible for design of RF/frequency-synthesis circuits, digital PLD circuits, microprocessor software, and PC boards/packaging, respectively. Heeding lessons learned in the previous course, lectures and homework/project assignments were carefully planned and timed to keep the project on schedule, and students were assigned individualized, but coordinated and interdependent tasks. Although highly successful (both ‘companies ’ produced working designs, and student and employer critiques of the course were overwhelmingly positive [2]), course management and homework/project assignment creation consumed nearly all of the instructors’ time, leaving little available for research that semester...|$|E
40|$|Rapid {{advances}} {{in science and}} new technologies are transforming the way people in both developed and developing countries live, interact, learn, think, and work. As a result, the workforce needs to be flexible, self-reliant, knowledgeable, skilful, and equipped with generic skills {{in order to be}} able to meet the demands of changing technologies and the shift towards knowledge-based and service economies worldwide. Calls for institutions to demonstrate the quality of their training, globalisation, and education reforms have prompted the need to examine graduate attributes. This inevitably calls for the evaluation of the efficacy of training programs, technical and vocational education and training (TVET) included. The aim of this study was to investigate, from the perspectives of graduates and employers, the efficacy of selected courses in relation to their effectiveness in preparing graduates for employment, further education, and the acquisition of generic skills. This was achieved by an evaluative case study of the efficacy of two courses conducted by a polytechnic in Malaysia. A mixed methods research design was employed for data collection. Two instruments were developed. After a pilot study was conducted, the questionnaires were mailed to the participants. Twelve graduates and ten employers were subsequently interviewed. Data from the surveys were analysed using a predominantly nonparametric statistical approach while data from the interviews were transcribed and then analysed by content analysis. Employers and graduates were agreed and positive about the overall efficacy of the courses. Their perceptions of the generic skills graduates need to possess when entering the workplace also concurred. These generic skills were identified as communication skills, <b>teamworking</b> <b>skills,</b> problem solving skills, and time management skills. This finding suggests that the generic skills needed in the workplace were similar for graduates in developed as well as developing countries. Employers indicated they value the capacity to learn new skills and the ability to apply knowledge. Overall, both graduates and employers found graduates were adequate in knowledge but lacked technical, communication, problem solving, and critical thinking skills. Employers perceived diploma graduates as more work-ready compared to certificate graduates. Graduates identified group work, projects, and industrial training as useful. This study additionally fostered a deeper understanding of the elements that shaped and explained stakeholders’ perspectives which will help educators better understand and respond to the needs of employers as their learners, particularly in the context of TVET in a developing country...|$|E

Each student was involved as part of a small team in one long high-fidelity scenario 2 with 3 - 4 disciplines and using actors, simulated patients and SimMan. Students also remotely observed another scenario tackled by their peers and were asked to document their observations based on CRM principles on a white board so it {{could be used as a}} discussion basis during the debriefing. Students filled in a pre and post-simulation questionnaire about the session using a 5 -point Likert scale. Results: Most students (77. 78 %) were not familiar with the concepts of simulation and were quite anxious about the simulation (3. 6 / 5). Being constantly observed can be distressing. Over three quarters of the students said the scenarios were realistic (3. 99 / 5), which helped them to forget the cameras, instructors and their peers. They reported their performance was not really affected by the fact they were being observed (2. 29 / 5). Concerning the difficulty to treat the mannequin as a real patient, the answers are very spread because it relies to a certain degree on the students??? sense of imagination. In general students thought the mannequin???s response to treatment was realistic (3. 81 / 5). Even if students??? perception of knowledge of their own discipline role and skills was very high (4. 73 / 5) and poorer about other disciplines (2. 68 / 5), they reported simulation allowed them to learn more about their own discipline (3. 82 / 5) and the other disciplines (3. 91 / 5). Students said they leant from the debriefing sessions (4. 39 / 5) and that it enhanced their technical knowledge (4. 25 / 5). 80. 16 % of the students thought that seeing themselves on video would allow them to reflect better. They requested that 3 - 4 multiprofessional simulation sessions per year should be part of the Interprofessional Education module. Discussion: Simulation sessions are always enjoyed by students but on this occasion the feedback was even more positive (4. 59 / 5) because it was multidisciplinary. Patient simulators are reported as being very useful in addition to learning from real patients. Students thought the simulation improved their clinical skills and knowledge. A supportive atmosphere, a realistic scenario and environment are important factors to fully immerse the participants. Introducing multiprofessional simulation pre-qualification was a valuable experience and could help students develop <b>teamworking</b> <b>skills</b> and feel more confident in a crisis situation...|$|E
