500|$|The book {{states that}} Seitz, Singer, Nierenberg and Robert Jastrow were all {{fiercely}} anti-communist and they viewed government regulation {{as a step}} towards socialism and communism. The authors argue that, {{with the collapse of}} the Soviet Union, they looked for another great threat to free market capitalism and found it in environmentalism. They feared that an over-reaction to environmental problems would lead to heavy-handed government intervention in the marketplace and intrusion into people's lives. Oreskes and Conway state that the longer the delay the worse these problems get, and the more likely it is that governments will need to take the draconian measures that conservatives and market fundamentalists most fear. They say that Seitz, Singer, Nierenberg and Jastrow denied <b>the</b> <b>scientific</b> <b>evidence,</b> contributed to a strategy of delay, and thereby helped to bring about the situation they most dreaded. The authors have a strong doubt about the ability of the media to differentiate between false truth and the actual science in question; however, they stop short of endorsing censorship in the name of science. The journalistic norm of balanced reporting has helped, according to the authors, to amplify the misleading messages of the contrarians. Oreskes and Conway state: [...] "small numbers of people can have large, negative impacts, especially if they are organised, determined and have access to power".|$|E
500|$|In 1991, Congress {{enacted the}} Agent Orange Act, giving the Department of Veterans Affairs the {{authority}} to declare certain conditions 'presumptive' to exposure to Agent Orange/dioxin, making these veterans who served in Vietnam eligible to receive treatment and compensation for these conditions. The same law required the National Academy of Sciences to periodically review the science on dioxin and herbicides used in Vietnam to inform the Secretary of Veterans Affairs about the strength of <b>the</b> <b>scientific</b> <b>evidence</b> showing association between exposure to Agent Orange/dioxin and certain conditions. The authority for the National Academy of Sciences reviews and addition of any new diseases to the presumptive list by the VA is expiring in 2015 under the sunset clause of the Agent Orange Act of 1991. [...] Through this process, the list of 'presumptive' conditions has grown since 1991, and currently the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs has listed prostate cancer, respiratory cancers, multiple myeloma, type II diabetes mellitus, Hodgkin's disease, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, soft tissue sarcoma, chloracne, porphyria cutanea tarda, peripheral neuropathy, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and spina bifida in children of veterans exposed to Agent Orange as conditions associated with exposure to the herbicide. This list now includes B cell leukemias, such as hairy cell leukemia, Parkinson's disease and ischemic heart disease, these last three having been added on August 31, 2010. Several highly placed individuals in government are voicing concerns about whether some of the diseases on the list should, in fact, actually have been included.|$|E

500|$|For {{decades the}} Roman Catholic Church avoided {{official}} refutation of evolution. However, it would rein in Catholics who proposed that evolution could {{be reconciled with}} the Bible, as this conflicted with the First Vatican Council's (1869–70) finding that everything was created out of nothing by God, and to deny that finding could lead to excommunication. In 1950, the encyclical Humani generis of Pope Pius XII first mentioned evolution directly and officially. It allowed one to enquire into the concept of humans coming from pre-existing living matter, but not to question Adam and Eve or {{the creation of the}} soul. In 1996, Pope John Paul II said that evolution is [...] "more than a hypothesis" [...] and acknowledged the large body of work accumulated in its support, but reiterated that any attempt to give a material explanation of the human soul is [...] "incompatible with the truth about man." [...] Pope Benedict XVI has reiterated the conviction that human beings [...] "are not some casual and meaningless product of evolution. Each of us {{is the result of a}} thought of God. Each of us is willed, each of us is loved, each of us is necessary." [...] At the same time, he has promoted the study of the relationship between the concepts of creation and evolution, based on the conviction that there cannot be a contradiction between faith and reason. Along these lines, the research project Thomistic Evolution, run by a team of Dominican scholars, endeavours to reconcile <b>the</b> <b>scientific</b> <b>evidence</b> on evolution with the teaching of Thomas Aquinas.|$|E
