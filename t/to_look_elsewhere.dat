5|$|The massive Islamic {{invasions of}} the mid-7th century began a long {{struggle}} between Christianity and Islam throughout the Mediterranean Basin. The Byzantine Empire soon lost {{the lands of}} the eastern patriarchates of Jerusalem, Alexandria and Antioch and was reduced to that of Constantinople, the empire's capital. As a result of Islamic domination of the Mediterranean, the Frankish state, centred away from that sea, was able to evolve as the dominant power that shaped the Western Europe of the Middle Ages. The battles of Toulouse and Poitiers halted the Islamic advance in the West and the failed Siege of Constantinople halted it in the East. Two or three decades later, in 751, the Byzantine Empire lost to the Lombards the city of Ravenna from which it governed the small fragments of Italy, including Rome, that acknowledged its sovereignty. The fall of Ravenna meant that confirmation by a no longer existent exarch was not asked for during the election in 752 of Pope Stephen II and that the papacy was forced <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>elsewhere</b> for a civil power to protect it. In 754, at the urgent request of Pope Stephen, the Frankish king Pepin the Short conquered the Lombards. He then gifted the lands of the former exarchate to the pope, thus initiating the Papal States. Rome and the Byzantine East would delve into further conflict during the Photian schism of the 860s, when Photius criticised the Latin west of adding of the filioque clause after being excommunicated by Nicholas I. Though the schism was reconciled, unresolved issues would lead to further division.|$|E

25|$|After the Chinese Exclusion Act {{was passed}} in 1882, American {{industrialists}} began <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>elsewhere</b> for reliable sources of cheap labor. The Japanese government had forbidden emigration since 1868, but in the 1880s it relaxed some of its restrictions. In 1884, the government of Hawaii offered to subsidize the transport of Japanese labourers to its territory, and advertised a set of conditions under which the migrants would be employed on its sugar plantations.|$|E
25|$|Allaire had {{up until}} {{this point in his}} career been able to borrow to meet cash shortfalls, but with the {{recession}} affecting demand for his products, he was obliged <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>elsewhere</b> for working capital. In 1842, he sold shares in the Allaire Iron Works, which was incorporated for the sum of $300,000. Shipping magnate Cornelius Vanderbilt and Allaire's brother-in-law John Haggerty were thus able to eventually gain a controlling interest in the company.|$|E
50|$|In {{the year}} 2000, the United States {{classified}} the Bantu {{as a priority}} and began preparations to resettle an estimated 12,000 Bantu refugees in select cities throughout the U.S. Most of the early arrivals in the United States settled in Clarkston, Georgia, a city adjacent to Atlanta. However, they were mostly assigned to low rent, poverty-stricken inner city areas, so many began <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>to</b> resettle <b>elsewhere</b> in the US, including Maine.|$|R

As negotiations with Sandline continued, in July the PNGDF launched a new offensive on Bougainville. However, the attack failed, suffering from poor logistical planning, a lack of intelligence on BRA locations and mounting casualties.|$|E

25|$|The {{quantity}} and quality of jobs in the cigar industry would continue to fall as Tampa's manufacturers underwent a near-universal shift to mechanization. Replacing traditional hand-rolled cigars with machine-made varieties allowed cigar firms to employ fewer workers and pay them less. Even when demand quickly increased to record levels during American's post-war boom, the number of workers employed in Ybor City's factories continued to decrease due to more efficient machines. By then, Tampa's economy was buoyed by other industries such as shipping and tourism. However, little new activity had replaced cigar manufacturing in Ybor City, and job seekers often had <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>elsewhere</b> for employment.|$|E

Albert finished his first season with Nancy as the top scorer and scored two goals in each cup game, which were all won 2-1.|$|R

Compton started the season by qualifying on the outside pole next to Bill Elliott in the Daytona 500 {{and went on to}} score a 10th-place finish. At the next restrictor-plate race at Talladega Superspeedway, he won his first career Cup pole position, but finished last due to mechanical issues. After winning a second career pole at Talladega, he was only able to improve his points position by five spots. At the end of the year, sponsorship problems at Melling forced him <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>elsewhere</b> for a job.|$|E
25|$|According to Lewis, this {{reduction}} {{resulted in}} Arabs who wanted slaves having <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>elsewhere</b> {{to avoid the}} restrictions in the Qur'an, meaning an increase of importing of slaves from non-Muslim lands, primarily from Africa. These slaves suffered a high death toll. Patrick Manning states that Islamic legislations against the abuse of the slaves convincingly limited the extent of enslavement in Arabian Peninsula {{and to a lesser}} degree for the whole area of the whole Umayyad Caliphate where slavery had existed since the most ancient times. He however notes that {{with the passage of time}} and the extension of Islam, Islam by recognizing and codifying slavery seems to have done more to protect and expand slavery than the reverse.|$|E
25|$|Campbell {{continued}} to play for England after Euro 2004, although {{his place in the}} international team had become less secure since the emergence of the central defensive partnership of Terry and Ferdinand, which blossomed during Campbell's period of absence with injury in 2005. He was named in England's squad for the 2006 World Cup, but was third-choice centre back, with coach Sven-Göran Eriksson preferring the partnership of Ferdinand and Terry. However, after a knock to Ferdinand, Campbell came on as a substitute in England's group match against Sweden, which made him the first player to represent England on the pitch at six consecutive international tournaments. After Eriksson's resignation, new coach Steve McClaren choose <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>elsewhere</b> for central defensive strength and Campbell was dropped for his first match in charge against Greece in August 2006.|$|E

25|$|When the Great Smoky Mountains National Park {{was opened}} in 1934, the Tennessee Valley Authority {{reported}} {{that there were no}} tourism-oriented businesses in Pigeon Forge. By the 1950s, improvements to US-441 led to the establishment of a few campgrounds and lodges, but little that would generate major revenue. During this period, however, two factors in nearby Gatlinburg would lead to the commercial boom Pigeon Forge would experience {{in the latter half of}} the 20th century. First, Gatlinburg, itself surrounded by high mountain ridges, had limited land resources. Second, the land resources it did have were largely controlled by a few local families who thwarted attempts by outside businesses to take advantage of the town's prime location. Thus, outside entrepreneurs were forced <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>elsewhere.</b> Pigeon Forge, being just north of Gatlinburg along US-441, was a target.|$|E
25|$|After losing Brian Conklin to Puerto Rico, the Sharks {{were forced}} <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>elsewhere</b> {{to rebuild their}} roster for the 2015 season. Having {{retained}} guard Kevin Braswell as their import for another season, the Sharks looked to the Townsville Crocodiles again {{as a source for}} their second import. 2014–15 Australian NBL Most Improved Player Todd Blanchfield, a teammate of Conklin's, was signed by the Sharks as the team's second import for the 2015 season. A strong starting line-up for the Sharks was built with the additions of Duane Bailey and Adrian Majstrovich, and the re-signing of forward Tai Wesley. Shea Ili was also retained by the Sharks after being given a life line by the team following his incident in New Plymouth the year before. With Ili playing a sixth man role, the Sharks now had a number of scoring options and depth.|$|E
25|$|Lucasfilm hired Charles Lippincott as {{marketing}} director for Star Wars. As 20th Century Fox gave little support for marketing beyond licensing T-shirts and posters, Lippincott was forced <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>elsewhere.</b> He secured deals with Marvel Comics for a comic book adaptation, and with Del Rey Books for a novelization. A fan of science fiction, he used his contacts to promote the film at the San Diego Comic-Con and elsewhere within science fiction fandom. Worried that Star Wars would be beaten out by other summer films, such as Smokey and the Bandit, 20th Century Fox moved the release date to May 25, the Wednesday before Memorial Day. However, fewer than 40 theaters ordered the film to be shown. In response, the studio demanded that theaters order Star Wars if they wanted the eagerly anticipated The Other Side of Midnight {{based on the novel}} by the same name.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, the United States {{government}} began preparations to resettle an estimated 12,000 {{refugees from the}} Bantu minority ethnic group in Somalia to select cities throughout the United States. Most of the early arrivals in the United States settled in Clarkston, Georgia, a city adjacent to Atlanta. However, they were mostly assigned to low rent, poverty-stricken inner city areas, so many began <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>to</b> resettle <b>elsewhere</b> in the U.S.Word soon spread that Lewiston had a low crime rate, good schools and cheap housing.

25|$|For 2003, McRae {{signed for}} Citroën, {{a team of}} winning {{pedigree}} due to its successes {{of the previous year}} with young Frenchman Sébastien Loeb but otherwise undertaking its first complete campaign at World Rally Championship level. McRae's second-place finish on his début in Monte Carlo alongside Loeb and Carlos Sainz whom, aboard the Xsara WRC, helped complete a 1–2–3 finish, transpired to be the finest result he would achieve for the team, for the season was to end with seventh in the drivers' championship, with no victories. Rule changes that were to be brought in for the 2004 season changed the previous practice of having three nominated points-scorers within a team to two. With Loeb partway through a multiple year contract, this meant the Citroën factory team, under Guy Frequelin's leadership, were forced to choose between dropping McRae or Sainz. With Sainz being the more successful of the two during the 2003 season, it was McRae who had <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>elsewhere</b> for 2004. David Richards, McRae's former boss at Subaru, who had by now taken over WRC's commercial rights holders ISC and worried that the loss of a character like McRae would damage his ability to market the sport, set about trying to help McRae find a drive for 2004. McRae was unable to find a team, {{and for the first time}} in over ten years he would not be competing in the World Rally Championship.|$|E
500|$|At the convention's {{final day}} on July 14, 1972, presidential nominee McGovern {{selected}} and announced Senator Thomas Eagleton of Missouri as his vice-presidential choice. Eagleton was unknown to many delegates {{and the choice}} seemed to smack of traditional ticket balancing considerations. Thus, there were delegates willing <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>elsewhere.</b> Gravel was nominated by Bettye Fahrenkamp, the Democratic National Committeewoman from Alaska. He then seconded his own nomination, breaking down in tears at his own words and maybe trying to withdraw his nomination.

500|$|Notre Dame offered Lavelli a scholarship, and he {{committed}} {{to attend the}} school.

Lavelli enrolled at Ohio State University in 1941 after learning that Paul Brown was appointed the football team's new head coach. Brown had developed a sterling reputation as the high school coach at Massillon Washington High School in Massillon, Ohio, losing only eight games in nine years there. Lavelli's catching ability had made him a star infielder in high school, and the Detroit Tigers of Major League Baseball recruited him to play second base in the low minor leagues. He refused the invitation, opting to concentrate on football.|$|E
