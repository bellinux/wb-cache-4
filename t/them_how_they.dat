He surveyed 100 of the leading physicists of the day (approximately 1900), asking <b>them</b> <b>how</b> <b>they</b> did their work.|$|E

25|$|In this battle, Charles set {{a pattern}} for the {{remainder}} of his military career. He appeared where his enemies least expected him, while they were marching triumphantly home and far outnumbered him. He also attacked when least expected, at midday, when armies of that era traditionally were resting. Finally, he attacked <b>them</b> <b>how</b> <b>they</b> least expected it, by feigning a retreat to draw his opponents into a trap. The feigned retreat, next to unknown in Western Europe at that time—it was a traditionally eastern tactic—required both extraordinary discipline {{on the part of the}} troops and exact timing on the part of their commander. The result was an unbroken victory streak that lasted until his death.|$|E

25|$|Abu Bakr's {{strategy}} was to give his generals their mission, the geographical area in which that mission would be carried out, and the resources that, could be made available for that purpose. He would then leave it to his generals to accomplish their missions in whatever manner they chose. On the other hand, Caliph Umar {{in the latter part}} of his Caliphate used to direct his generals as to where they would stay and when to move to the next target and who was to be commanding the left and right wing of the army in each particular battle. This made the phase of conquest comparatively slower but provided well-organized campaigns. Caliph Uthman used the same method as Abu Bakr: he would give missions to his generals and then leave it to <b>them</b> <b>how</b> <b>they</b> should accomplish it. Caliph Ali also followed the same method.|$|E

500|$|Several critics {{wrote that}} [...] Portal 2 excels in {{teaching}} the player to solve puzzles; {{in a review}} for the New York Times, Seth Schiesel wrote, [...] "Somewhere out there an innovative, dynamic high school physics teacher will use Portal 2 as the linchpin of an entire series of lessons and will immediately {{become the most important}} science teacher those lucky students have ever had." [...] Mathematics and science teachers wrote e-mails to Valve to tell <b>them</b> <b>how</b> <b>they</b> had included Portal in their classroom lessons as part of a project to promote the [...] "gamification of learning". Portal developers Joshua Weier and Yasser Malaika led a team within Valve to explore ways of using Portal 2 for education. This {{led to the development of}} Puzzle Maker, a level editor for Portal 2 players, built from the professional tools used to develop the game. Weier and Malaika did not want to design curricula themselves, but wanted to provide educators with tools for creating lesson plans. Hammer, the only tool freely available before the release of the built-in level editor in 2012, was difficult for educators to learn and understand. Valve gave Puzzle Maker an easy-to-learn interface and the ability to share puzzles and lesson plans. The tools were developed with a mathematics teacher and her students. This formed the basis of a new [...] "Steam for Schools" [...] initiative launched in June 2012, under which educators could acquire Portal 2 and the Puzzle Maker software free of charge for classroom use through its [...] "Teach with Portals" [...] program. , Valve estimates that over 2,500 educators are using the [...] "Teach with Portals" [...] software within their lesson plans.|$|E
500|$|The first {{message to}} reach Bonaparte {{regarding}} the disaster that had overtaken his fleet arrived on 14 August at his {{camp on the}} road between Salahieh and Cairo. The messenger was a staff officer sent by the Governor of Alexandria General Jean Baptiste Kléber, and the report had been hastily written by Admiral Ganteaume, who had subsequently rejoined Villeneuve's ships at sea. One account reports {{that when he was}} handed the message, Bonaparte read it without emotion before calling the messenger to him and demanding further details. When the messenger had finished, the French general reportedly announced [...] "Nous n'avons plus de flotte: eh bien. Il faut rester en ces contrées, ou en sortir grands comme les anciens" [...] ("We no longer have a fleet: well, we must either remain in this country or quit it as great as the ancients"). Another story, as told by the general's secretary, Bourienne, claims that Bonaparte was almost overcome by the news and exclaimed [...] "Unfortunate Brueys, what have you done!" [...] Bonaparte later placed much of the blame for the defeat on the wounded Admiral Blanquet, falsely accusing him of surrendering Franklin while his ship was undamaged. Protestations from Ganteaume and Minister Étienne Eustache Bruix later reduced the degree of criticism Blanquet faced, but he never again served in a command capacity. Bonaparte's most immediate concern however was with his own officers, who began to question the wisdom of the entire expedition. Inviting his most senior officers to dinner, Bonaparte asked <b>them</b> <b>how</b> <b>they</b> were. When they replied that they were [...] "marvellous," [...] Bonaparte responded that it was just as well, since he would have them shot if they continued [...] "fostering mutinies and preaching revolt." [...] To quell any uprising among the native inhabitants, Egyptians overheard discussing the battle were threatened with having their tongues cut out.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, on 1 March, {{five people}} who were {{picketing}} next to the Federation Council building against the invasion of Ukraine were arrested. The next day about 200 people protested at {{the building of the}} Russian Ministry of Defence in Moscow against Russian military involvement. About 500 people also gathered to protest on the Manezhnaya Square in Moscow and the same number of people on the Saint Isaac's Square in Saint Petersburg. On 2 March, about eleven protesters demonstrated in Yekaterinburg against Russian involvement, with some wrapped in the Ukrainian flag. Protests were also held in Chelyabinsk on the same day. The opposition to the military intervention was also expressed by rock musician Andrey Makarevich, who wrote in particular: [...] "You want war with Ukraine? It will not be the way it was with Abkhazia: the folks on the Maidan have been hardened and know what they are fighting for – for their country, their independence. [...] We have to live with them. Still neighborly. And preferably in friendship. But it's up to <b>them</b> <b>how</b> <b>they</b> want to live".

2500|$|The Basilica is {{sometimes}} referred to as Our Lady of the Snows, a name given to it in the Roman Missal from 1568 to 1969 in connection with the liturgical feast of the anniversary of its dedication on 5 August, a feast that was then denominated Dedicatio Sanctae Mariae ad Nives (Dedication of Saint Mary of the Snows). This name for the basilica had become popular in the 14th century in connection with a legend that the 1911 Catholic Encyclopedia reports thus: [...] "During the pontificate of Liberius, the Roman patrician John and his wife, who were without heirs, made a vow to donate their possessions to the Virgin Mary. They prayed that she might make known to <b>them</b> <b>how</b> <b>they</b> were to dispose of their property in her honour. On 5 August, {{at the height of the}} Roman summer, snow fell during the night on the summit of the Esquiline Hill. In obedience to a vision of the Virgin Mary which they had the same night, the couple built a basilica in honour of Mary on the very spot which was covered with snow. From the fact that no mention whatever is made of this alleged miracle until a few hundred years later, not even by Sixtus III in his eight-line dedicatory inscription ... it would seem that the legend has no historical basis." ...|$|E
2500|$|One character, a slave {{companion}} for the Sith Warrior named Vette, drew controversy. Writing for Kotaku, Mike Fahey, {{after playing}} the game, recalled players boasting of their torturing of Vette and her low affection rating for them. The Daily Mail ran {{an article about}} Fahey's story on their Mail Online website, remarking on how the option to treat Vette decently did not seem popular, and while noting Star Wars was [...] "no stranger to slavery" [...] said [...] "the idea of playing 'master' yourself is unsavoury". The Mail was criticised for its lack of evidence for its statements and its selective information. Forbes's Erik Kain criticised gaming as overly focused on [...] "teenage boys", calling {{the inclusion of a}} shock-collar-wearing slave [...] "not so much surprising as it is disappointing" [...] and [...] "really creepy". Kain commented how it enforced how gaming could be a [...] "hostile environment" [...] for girls and felt that the inclusion of choice failed to make the situation better. The Mary Sue contributor Becky Chambers felt Vette's inclusion was less [...] "sexist" [...] than [...] "shortsighted". Religion Dispatches researched the matter, surveying 369 players to ask <b>them</b> <b>how</b> <b>they</b> acted. The survey's findings suggested that most players chose the good options and felt uncomfortable doing any evil ones. They suggested that the presence of characters like Vette influenced the player's actions, making them want to take choices that would gain Affection.|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{receiving}} orders, General Scott {{traveled all}} the way from his post in Virginia City to Bluff, in order to negotiate an end to the war. Scott was genuinely uninterested in fighting the hostile Utes and Paiutes, so on March 10, 1915 he left Bluff, unarmed, with just a few of his men, to meet Polk and Posey at a place called Mexican Hat, near Navajo Mountain. General Scott described the journey; [...] "We reached Bluff on March 10 and learned that the Indians had gone to the Navajo Mountains, 125 miles southwest of Bluff. We stayed a day in Bluff and then went on to Mexican Hat. Some friendly Navajos met me at Mexican Hat and went ahead of me to tell Poke's [...] band of my coming. Among them was Bzoshe, the old Navajo chief with whom the government had so much trouble with a year ago and who is now our fast friend. I had sent for him to meet me at Bluff. Mr. Jenkins, Indian agent at Navajo Springs, Mr. Creel, Colonel Michie, and my orderly accompanied me to Mexican Hat. None of us had a gun. Jim Boy, a friendly Paiute, was sent out to tell the Paiutes that I wanted to see them. Some of them came near where I was camped, but it wasn't until the third day that anyone dared to come to the camp. Posey and four other Indians then came in. We talked a little through a Navajo interpreter. It was in the evening, and I just asked <b>them</b> <b>how</b> <b>they</b> were. I told them I did not feel very well {{and did not want to}} talk to them until the next day. They helped us kill a beef and we gave them a good meal, the first they'd had in weeks. We also gave them some blankets. Posey and his men didn't have any weapons, but I have reason to suspect that they had hidden them nearby. The next day, Poke and Hatch [...] and about 25 others came to see me. I asked them to tell me their troubles. I said that I didn't think they would like to have their children chased by soldiers and cowboys all over the mountains and killed and that I wanted to help them. I didn't try to push the matter with them, but asked them what they wanted to do. After they had talked among themselves, they said they would do anything I wanted them to do." ...|$|E
