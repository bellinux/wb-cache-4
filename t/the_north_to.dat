5|$|Although {{contemporary}} {{sources are}} {{silent on the}} matter, {{it is more than}} likely that on Somairle's demise, his territory was divided amongst his surviving sons. The precise allotment of lands is unknown; even though the division of lands amongst later generations of meic Somairle can be readily discerned, such boundaries are unlikely to have existed during the chaotic twelfth century. It is possible that the territory of the first generation of meic Somairle may have stretched from Glenelg in <b>the</b> <b>north,</b> <b>to</b> the Mull of Kintyre in the south; with Áengus ruling in the north, Dubgall centred in Lorne (with possibly the bulk of the inheritance), and Ragnall in Kintyre and the southern islands.|$|E

5|$|At its height, the Mongolian empire {{stretched}} from Shanhaiguan {{in the east}} to Budapest in the west, from Rus' in <b>the</b> <b>north</b> <b>to</b> Tibet in the south.

Thus, the Pax Mongolica greatly influenced many civilizations in Eurasia during the 13th and 14th centuries.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 1926, the American Association of State Highway Officials {{formally}} {{established the}} U.S. Highway System {{and many of the}} New England inter-state routes were redesignated as U.S. Routes.

In 1935, the portion of US 2 between Montpelier and St. Johnsbury was relocated to a more northerly alignment using a section of then Vermont Route 18.
