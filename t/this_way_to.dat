5|$|Interested {{in using}} sources other than archaeology, Grinsell {{made use of}} documents, place-names, folklore, and the {{accounts}} of antiquarians {{as part of his}} research. According to later archaeologists Amy Gazin-Schwartz and Cornelius Holtfdorf, Grinsell {{was one of the few}} archaeologists of his generation who was interested in the relationship between folklore and archaeology, comparing him in <b>this</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> continental European scholars Paul Saintyves, Horst Ohlhaver, and Karel C.

5|$|The {{symmetry}} {{on earth}} mirrors the symmetric perfection of heaven. The purpose {{of art at}} this time—in architecture, the visual arts, and music—was not to create something entirely new, but to reflect this divine perfection, and in <b>this</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> praise God. We find such a symmetric outline in many pieces by Johann Sebastian Bach,19 but only {{in a few cases}} is this outline as consequent as in the B Minor Mass. The parts Kyrie, Gloria and Credo are all designed with choral sections as the outer movements, framing an intimate center of theological significance.|$|E
5|$|Animals {{that feed}} on the spiny scallop include starfish, {{particularly}} the ochre star (Pisaster ochraceus) and the sunflower star (Pycnopodia helianthoides), octopuses and sea otters. The scallop can swim and does so to escape from predators, repeatedly opening and shutting its valves in a clapping action. Each time the valves close, water is expelled through {{a gap in the}} mantle on the dorsal side of the hinge and the animal moves margin first, a form of jet propulsion. It has chemoreceptors on the mantle margins which detect the approach of a starfish and enable it to take evasive action. It also responds in <b>this</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> predators that feed on sponges, such as nudibranchs of the genus Archidoris spp..|$|E

5|$|Defying the king, between 12February and 20April 1642, each county {{delegation}} of England in Commons chose two divines, {{in addition to}} two for each county of Wales, four for London, and two for each University (Oxford and Cambridge). County delegations often chose divines from their own county, but not always. Commons chose the members in <b>this</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> ensure that their local constituencies were represented in the decision. The House of Lords, Parliament's upper house, added another fourteen names on 14May, to which Commons agreed. Meanwhile, relations continued to deteriorate between the king and Parliament. Charles raised the royal standard at Nottingham on 22August, marking {{the beginning of the}} First English Civil War. The start of the war lent support to the cause of the Assembly in Parliament, because holding it would convince the Scots that Parliament was serious about reforming the church and induce the Scots to come to their aid. On the other hand, the war added strain to the already busy Parliament.|$|E
5|$|In June 1943, {{decreased}} {{demand from}} the Admiralty meant the PRU supported RAF Bomber Command more frequently. In the Battle of the Ruhr, {{extensive use of}} PR Spitfires to identify and report the effects of air attacks. Spitfires of No. 542 Squadron RAF were used in <b>this</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> record the results of Operation Chastise. PRU was also instrumental in locating German missile testing sites on the Baltic Sea, near Peenemünde, allowing Bomber Command to attack them. In September 1943, the Admiralty asked for the PRU's help in Operation Source, to cripple German heavy units in Norway. No. 544 Squadron RAF contributed {{to the success of}} the operation. After this success, all PR units were standardised at strength of 20 aircraft.|$|E

25|$|Diodes {{will prevent}} {{currents}} in unintended directions. To supply power to an electrical circuit during a power failure, the circuit can draw current from a battery. An {{uninterruptible power supply}} may use diodes in <b>this</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> ensure that current is only drawn from the battery when necessary. Likewise, small boats typically have two circuits each with their own battery/batteries: one used for engine starting; one used for domestics. Normally, both are charged from a single alternator, and a heavy-duty split-charge diode is used to prevent the higher-charge battery (typically the engine battery) from discharging through the lower-charge battery when the alternator is not running.|$|E

25|$|One {{of several}} methods the IRA used to counter British body armour {{was the use}} of high {{velocity}} Barrett Light 50 and Belgian FN sniper rifles, several of which the Provisionals imported from the USA. Two snipers teams of the South Armagh Brigade killed nine members of the security forces in <b>this</b> <b>way.</b> <b>To</b> avoid the jamming of wireless-triggered detonators, the organisation began to employ radar beacons to prime their explosive devices, improving dramatically the effectiveness of the attacks. By 1992, the use of long-range weapons like mortars and heavy machine guns by the IRA had forced the British Army to build its checkpoints one to five miles from the border in order to avoid attacks launched from the Republic.|$|E
