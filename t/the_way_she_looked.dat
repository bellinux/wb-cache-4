500|$|Toyah's image {{eventually}} {{began to}} change and she became more aware of <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> when she got a boyfriend and started college. Toyah also took extra English lessons from Ken Barlow (William Roache) {{in a bid to}} better herself. Taylor later commented that her character got on her nerves due to her naivety. She also thought that Toyah had a romantic view of love, was too trusting and occasionally needed to be [...] "a bit more clued up". The actress added that Toyah was [...] "a very decent person", who was loyal to her friends. Digital Spy's Kris Green described Toyah as [...] "the more mellow of the Battersbys" [...] and thought that was due to Les (Bruce Jones) not being her biological father. The Daily Mirror's Charlie Catchpole commented that Toyah went [...] "from lumpy, sulky schoolgirl to confident, radiant young woman".|$|E
2500|$|In 1953 Maksakova {{received}} the notification of her 'retirement'. This came as an unpleasant surprise for the singer {{felt she was}} in superb shape, both physically and artistically. Rumours had it, some people at the Bolshoi decided to settle some old scores this way, now that Stalin, her much-feared patron, was now dead, {{and the name of}} Vera Davydova, another famous Soviet soprano, has been mentioned in this context. Lyudmila Maksakova refused to believe this, remembering the times when Davydova, who lived in a neighbouring dacha, helped her mother in difficult times. Davydova herself remembered her great rival with warmth. [...] "Maria Petrovna paid great attention to <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked.</b> She was beautiful and had excellent figure. Yet she kept herself perfectly fit, with strict diet and regular gymnastics ... Our relations were pure and friendly, each respected and valued what the other was doing on stage," [...] Davydova maintained.|$|E
60|$|The {{moment she}} was in their room, with the bellboy safely out of <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> {{critically}} at Kennicott. For {{the first time in}} months she really saw him.|$|E
5000|$|... "I {{imagined}} {{someone who}} could move {{through the streets of}} Stockholm almost invisibly even though <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> ... it's almost like a forcefield" [...] Steven Zaillian ...|$|R
50|$|The narrator {{states that}} he can't grow up and settle down but he can {{appreciate}} <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> when <b>she</b> has a red bandana tied around her hair.|$|R
50|$|In the episode, Steve {{falls for}} an {{overweight}} girl, and the appearance-obsessed Stan is so appalled by <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> that he develops anorexia. Roger, however, falls for her, too, {{and attempts to}} sabotage her relationship with Steve.|$|R
60|$|I {{said that}} Mr. Storer had {{included}} me. I am sure, from <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> at me, {{that she did}} not heed my answer. She appeared to hesitate {{on the verge of a}} speech, and glanced once or twice at the doors.|$|E
60|$|He {{went down}} to dinner rather early and found Alice in the hall. There was nobody else about, and by <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> up as he {{advanced}} he thought she {{had been waiting for}} him. Alice had beauty, but it was her proud reserve he felt most. She did not give her friendship lightly, but he believed it was worth winning.|$|E
6000|$|... "If I had {{a sister}} who persisted in talking in that aggravatingly edifying fashion, I should feel tempted to shake her," [...] he said. [...] "Still, one could forgive {{her a good}} deal if only for <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> at the West-coast boat. It {{suggested}} that she has as much humanity in her {{as there is in}} the rest of us, after all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's gammon," [...] said Poppins. [...] "When once she's married she'll go {{straight}} enough. I believe that of her, for she knows which side her bread's buttered. But till the splice is made she's {{a right to}} please herself; that's <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> at it." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "She's {{from a very}} {{traditional}} small town where everyone seems to think and act differently from her. ... She's {{been through a lot}} in her life so far, a lot of personal tragedy, and it's certainly done a great deal to shape <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> at <b>the</b> people around her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{are rather}} a puzzle," [...] I admitted. [...] "I suppose they {{might very well}} be father and daughter. It is certain that she is fresh from some convent boarding-school. I don't like <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> at <b>the</b> man, do you? It is as though she were terrified to death. I wonder if he is her father?" ...|$|R
60|$|Then the {{daughter}} said to Elsa, 'Fear nothing, my mother {{will be your}} friend. I saw by <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> that she would grant your request when she had thought over it,' and, telling Elsa to wait, she entered the house to seek her mother. Elsa meanwhile was tossed about between hope and fear, and {{felt as if the}} girl would never come.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{recognize}} that!" [...] said Miss Willoughby, evidently pleased. [...] "You {{see that}} light-colored {{spot in the}} portico? That's Mrs. Chester; she stood there when I was making the drawing. It is nothing but two or three little dabs, but that is <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> at a distance. Around on this side is {{the corner of the}} yard where the bear tried to eat up the tire of your bicycle." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{know that}} sort of friend. D'you think I didn't see <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> at you, and how she {{followed}} you with her eyes? She simply hung on every word you said. When you smiled, she smiled. When you laughed, she laughed. Oh, I should think {{she was in love}} with you; I know what love is, and I felt it. And when she looked at me I know she hated me because I'd robbed her of you.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ground? Why {{the ground}} that she is fond of you. Any man with half an eye could see that, by <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> at and speaks to you. Of course you have not {{observed}} that. I trust, my boy, you are too honourable to have encouraged it. Nevertheless, it is a fact--a miserable, tantalising, exasperating fact--a maddening fact, now that that hideous red-Indian--Hottentot stands in the way." ...|$|R
5000|$|This term is {{also used}} in the novel The Color Purple by Alice Walker. There, the main {{character}} Celie describes that patting Harpo feels [...] "like patting another piece of wood. Not a living tree, but a table, a chifferobe." [...] Later in the book, Celie is not happy about <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks,</b> and in that context she contemplates: [...] "Nothing but churchgoing clothes in my chifferobe." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh," [...] he responded, [...] "I guess {{quite a few}} done no {{more than}} make their folks {{on the other side}} tired of them, and that's why they sent them out to you. Some of them get paid so much on {{condition}} that they don't come back again. Say"--and he glanced toward the dancers--"Dick Creighton's Sally seems quite stuck on Hawtrey by <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she's</b> <b>looking</b> at him." ...|$|R
60|$|Mary and I {{got along}} {{together}} splendidly. We don't now, but we'll {{come to that}} later. I'm speaking of the past. She seemed to think Bobbie the greatest thing on earth, judging by <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> at him when she thought I wasn't noticing. And Bobbie seemed to think the same about her. So that I {{came to the conclusion}} that, if only dear old Bobbie didn't forget to go to the wedding, they had a sporting chance of being quite happy.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, sir, {{sitting at}} the desk was the kind of a young woman that can catch any man in the world as easy as lifting a finger. There's a way of doing it. She knew. I saw her working it. She was healthy-looking and plain dressed. She had her hair drawn back from her {{forehead}} and face--no curls or frizzes; that's <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked.</b> Now I'll tell you the way they work the game; it's simple. When she wants a man, she manages it so that every time he looks at her he finds her looking at him. That's all.|$|E
60|$|The {{girl had}} {{slipped out of}} the fur coat, and Barker cast a swift glance of {{approval}} at her. He had the valet's unerring eye for a thoroughbred, and Jill Mariner was manifestly that. It showed in her walk, in every move of her small, active body, in <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> at you, in the way she talked to you, in the little tilt of her resolute chin. Her hair was pale gold, and had the brightness of colouring of a child's. Her face glowed, and her grey eyes sparkled. She looked very much alive.|$|E
50|$|It's {{the first}} workout {{with the new}} teams, {{and some people are}} {{adjusting}} to the change better than others. Scott welcomes new beginnings, but Sonya is having a really hard time. Dolvett sits down and helps her work on seeing change as a positive thing. She has struggled with self-esteem her whole life, and while she did a lot of emotional work with Jen, with Dolvett she's focusing on being proud of <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks.</b>|$|R

50|$|Morgan {{is always}} {{made fun of}} because of her long nose, so she wishes for a magic wand to make it shorter. Gruzzlebeard makes a fake magic wand out of the wrong wood under the full moon and gives it to her, pretending it’s from Santa.

6000|$|... "How d'ye do again?" [...] Lady Wantridge {{replied with}} an equanimity {{striking}} to her hostess. It {{was as if}} Scott's own had been contagious; it was almost indeed {{as if she had}} seen him before. Had she ever so seen him--before the previous day? While Miss Cutter put to herself this question her visitor at all events met the one she had previously uttered. [...] "Ever 'forgive'?" [...] this personage echoed in a tone that made as little account as possible of the interruption. [...] "Dear yes! The people I HAVE forgiven!"

[...] "The people I can!" ...|$|E
60|$|He {{slipped from}} the door. The little side {{corridor}} was as yet empty. For {{a second or}} two he listened intently. There were no footsteps as yet audible in the main corridor. In half-a-dozen swift strides he reached the door of his own room, turned the handle, and passed inside. Almost immediately there were footsteps in the corridor outside. The bell of the room opposite was answered. Again silence! The seconds grew into minutes, and the minutes passed away. Then his door was suddenly opened from the outside, softly and silently. Winifred Rowan stood there on the threshold of his room, with the handle of the door still in her hand, and to his fancy there was something ominous in <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> at him.|$|E
60|$|On {{the evening}} of the second day men came to the house from sea. They told of the {{merchandise}} in the ship, which was well enough and to be had at easy rates, and of a waif woman that sailed in her, no one could tell why, and had chests of clothes beyond comparison, fine coloured stuffs, finely woven, the best that ever came into that island, and gewgaws for a queen. At the hearing of that Aud's eyes began to glisten. She went early to bed; and the day was not yet red before she was on the beach, had a boat launched, and was pulling to the ship. By <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> closely at all boats, but there was no woman in any; and at that she was better pleased, for she had no fear of the men.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, Scott {{teaches the}} Red Team {{how to play}} football. As a former NFL quarterback, {{he knows how to}} bring a team {{together}} and make them stronger. His teammates are appreciative of his leadership skills, and they're truly growing into a family. While everything seems to be going swimmingly for the White Team, Sonya admits that her struggle with self-doubt has had a crippling effect on her personal life. She has never been in a relationship because she is ashamed of <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> and can't imagine someone else finding her attractive. She reveals that as of October, she will be a real-life 40-year-old virgin, and is desperate to overcome the insecurities that are holding her back.|$|R
50|$|Pearl (Valerie Concepcion) is a {{beautiful}} college student who loves to party, obsessed with <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> and is very self-centered. Because she is also so possessive of her boyfriend Alvin (Geoff Eigenmann), she gets jealous {{when it comes to}} other girls in the campus. She is also jealous of her sister, who had died, unlike her sister, she thinks that she can never meet up to her mother's expectations, and that her mother will never like her as much. Her maid Rina (Tess Antonio) is the exact opposite of Pearl — she is not very pretty, and she always wanted to be like Pearl and envied her, but she can also be a kind person.|$|R
5000|$|Sorokko's {{distinct}} {{personal style}} has earned her {{a reputation as}} a [...] "style icon," [...] a fashion visionary, and [...] "the queen of vintage couture," [...] but it was Vogue that over a decade ago, first recognized her style's influence on fashion and touted Sorokko as an [...] "eagle-eyed iconoclast," [...] a [...] "reluctant trend-setter," [...] and a [...] "fad-making model." [...] Among the trends she has been credited for starting or popularizing, are the widespread today vintage clothing and [...] "skull" [...] jewelry, particularly that of the cult Italian designer Attilio Codognato, whose memento mori jewelry she has been wearing and championing since the early 1990s. According to Style.com, Sorokko's style can at times be [...] "subversive ... I'm wearing my blouse upside down and backward", she told the reporter, referring to her Yves Saint Laurent haute couture blouse. On another occasion, Sorokko was asked by Jim Shi of the Daily Front Row about the oversized Donna Karan coat she was wearing. “This is her trench from the last collection”, she informed him. “You may not recognize it because I am wearing it inside out. You know me - wearing it <b>the</b> normal <b>way</b> would be too ordinary.” More often, however, Sorokko's style is described as [...] "timeless". [...] "Tatiana's timeless wardrobe reflects her individual point of view," [...] fashion curator Dennita Sewell told ArtDaily. Her [...] "inborn sense of style and extensive modeling experience shape her selections which transcend current fashion trends." [...] According to Glenda Bailey, [...] "Tatiana is an icon for <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> in fashion, but also for <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> at fashion. It makes her a great fashion collaborator." [...] Ralph Rucci agrees: “Tatiana's style is not only flawless, it is also highly influential. She has absolutely inspired me.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So I {{bought a}} new outfit of clothes and a book on {{etiquette}} and made a dead set for Mrs. De Clinton. She was a fine-looking woman, cheerful and gay. At first, I almost had to hobble her {{to keep her from}} loping around at George's heels; but finally I got her so she seemed glad to go riding with me and sailing on the lake; and she seemed real hurt on the mornings when I forgot to send her a bunch of flowers. Still, I didn't like <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> at George, sometimes, {{out of the corner of}} her eye. George was having a fine time now, going with the whole bunch just as he pleased. Yes'm," [...] continued Bell, [...] "she certainly was a fine-looking woman at that time. She's changed some since, as you might have noticed at the supper table." ...|$|E
60|$|She stood silent {{a moment}} or two, hesitating, and he watched her unobtrusively. He saw a jaded girl in a badly creased and {{somewhat}} shabby dress who nevertheless had an air of refinement about her which he immediately recognized. Her face was delicately pretty and cleanly cut, though it was weary and a little anxious then, and she had fine hazel eyes. Still, the red-lipped mouth was somehow determined {{and there was a}} hint of decision of character in <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> at him from under straight-drawn brows. Her hair, {{as much as he could}} see of it, was neither brown nor golden, but of a shade between, and he decided that the contrast between the warm color in her cheeks and the creamy whiteness of the rest of her face was a little more marked than usual, as indeed it was, for Alison was troubled with a very natural embarrassment just then.|$|E
6000|$|... "I like Miss Lavendar," [...] {{announced}} Paul, as {{they walked}} through the beech woods. [...] "I like <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> at me, and I like her stone house, and I like Charlotta the Fourth. I wish Grandma Irving had a Charlotta the Fourth instead of a Mary Joe. I feel sure Charlotta the Fourth wouldn't think I was wrong in my upper story when I told her what I think about things. Wasn't that a splendid tea we had, teacher? Grandma says a boy shouldn't be thinking about what he gets to eat, but he can't help it sometimes when he is real hungry. YOU know, teacher. I don't think Miss Lavendar would make a boy eat porridge for breakfast if he didn't like it. She'd get things for him he did like. But of course" [...] . Paul was nothing if not fair-minded [...] "that mightn't be very good for him. It's very nice for a change though, teacher. YOU know." ...|$|E
60|$|Freddie {{glanced at}} her anxiously. He {{was not at all}} sure now that he liked <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> was <b>looking</b> or <b>the</b> tone in which she spoke. He was not a keenly observant young man, but there did begin at this point to seep through to his brain-centres a {{suspicion}} that all was not well.|$|R
6000|$|She was at {{the hotel}} before eight next morning. Fern longed to go to school, to face the tittering, {{but she was too}} shaky. Carol read to her all day and, by reassuring her, {{convinced}} her own self that the school-board would be just. She was less sure of it that evening when, at the motion pictures, she heard Mrs. Gougerling exclaim to Mrs. Howland, [...] "She may be so innocent and all, and I suppose she probably is, but still, if she drank a whole bottle of whisky at that dance, <b>the</b> <b>way</b> everybody says <b>she</b> did, she may have forgotten she was so innocent! Hee, hee, hee!" [...] Maud Dyer, leaning back from her seat, put in, [...] "That's what I've said all along.

50|$|Gloria (Sofia Vergara) {{notices that}} Jay (Ed O'Neill) does not {{put a lot}} of effort into <b>the</b> <b>way</b> he looks lately and is hurt by that. Given that she always tries her best to look good for her husband, she expects the same from him. After confronting him, Jay {{explains}} that he does not really care for <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> and finds her beautiful no matter what. To prove him wrong, Gloria goes out with him on a business lunch looking hideous. Jay realizes that looks are important and confronts Gloria, telling her that {{he does not want to}} be the old guy that tries too hard. Gloria, saddened by such a thing, tells Jay that she married him for <b>the</b> <b>way</b> he looks, not his money, and does not want him to change for anybody.|$|R
