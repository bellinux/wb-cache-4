40|$|AbstractThe CO 2 -laser {{drilling}} in Schott D 263 Teco thin glass having a thickness of 500 μm is intensively studied. The nearly cylindrical holes having diameters smaller 100 μm could be drilled in 0. 25 seconds per hole. Reliability investigations by performing temperature cycling show cracks in 51 % of the drilled {{holes in the}} glass substrate. The reason is thermally induced stress during thermal CO 2 -laser ablation. Different thermal pre- and post-treatments have been successfully studied avoiding such cracks (98. 4 % crack-free holes) and show the high potential of CO 2 -laser drilling for <b>through</b> <b>glass</b> <b>via</b> (TGV) processing in glass substrates for micro-system applications...|$|E
40|$|Glass as a {{substrate}} material for interposer application has many benefits compared to conventional packaging materials like silicon, ceramic or polymer based laminates because of its excellent dielectric and transparent properties. Furthermore, the integration potential of glass is superior because of the dimensional stability under thermal load and the {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} (CTE) matching to that of silicon ICs. A small pitch size of conductor traces, small scale through-vias and high alignment accuracy are the key requirements that will be achieved from glass based packaging. Also the transparency of glass has benefits for photonic packaging. Glass substrates are available in wafer and large scale panel formats. Very fast CO 2 -laser drilling of holes and thermal post-treatments for reducing mechanical stress are very promising for fast processing and high reliability. Holes with a diameter smaller 100 μm in different glasses with thicknesses between 145 and 500 μm have been achieved by CO 2 -laser drilling. The holes have been metallized by sputtering a seed layer and galvanic copper platting. The CO 2 -laser drilling in combination with copper metallization has high potential for <b>through</b> <b>glass</b> <b>via</b> forming in glass substrates for interposer applications...|$|E
40|$|Glass is well {{established}} as wafer or panel substrate for applications like capping of image sensors or as low loss carrier for integrated passive devices. Glass substrates with higher functionality becomes more attractive for the advanced packaging due the improvement of glass processing and the increased implementation of photonic packaging which is demanded for higher data transfer rates. The <b>through</b> <b>glass</b> <b>vias</b> are therefore essential for the SiP and 3 -D integration...|$|R

40|$|Integration of IC chips vertically, named 3 -D integration, is an {{important}} technology direction to increase packing density, reduce route for signal propagation and hence increase the functionality and clock rate. Current technologies use through-silicon-via to achieve 3 -D integration. The high cost of Si, processing and the poor electrical isolation are main problems restricting the realization of 3 -D technology. With the use of through-glass-via (TGV) could potentially solve those problems. Besides, optical transparent and chemical-resistant of glass enable the possibility of 3 -D ICs having optical modulation and chemical sensing function. However, formation of through-glass-via by dry etching needs high-cost equipment at a long etching time. Drill holes by high energy laser looks a suitable method. The formation of micro-cracks at the surface of glass via and along with via by the laser will cause the electrical fail that limit the application of TGV. In this work, we utilize a photo-chemical etching (PCE) method to form through-glass-via. The PCE is a low cost, damage-free and potentially large-area method for TGV formation. An ultra-violet (355 nm) pulse laser was used to illuminate the glass surface. The illuminated region will crystallize after thermal annealing in a furnace. The crystalized glass shows much faster etching rate than the amorphous region in HF solution. For a relatively thick (600 nm) glass, a via-hole with diameter of around 50 μm was demonstrated in laser energy of 6 J/cm 2. In comparison, at least 120 J/cm 2 was required to drill a glass directly. In addition, a 40 selectivity was achieved to the crystallized and amorphous region. 為了提升大型積體電路晶片的性能，同時限制他們的功率消耗，將晶片(chip) 視為一個電晶體所引發的三維大型積體電路結構（ 3 D IC），是一種較可靠且能從基本解決問題的方法。矽穿孔(Through silicon via, TSV) 是 3 D IC的一支，並是其中一種技術的統稱。將晶片連接在一起的載板，可以是矽晶片、高分子薄膜、金屬、甚至是玻璃。Silicon 的確比organic及Metal優秀，但是也有電訊號隔離及成本上的大問題。相對來說，玻璃在各方面都極為優秀，只有在製作深溝上有製程的困難性，主要是蝕刻方式太慢。數種方式最近被驗證來製作玻璃導通孔（Through Glass Via, TGV) 。包含CO 2 Laser、UV Laser、Excimer Laser及Mechanical Drilling。但是，不是尺寸太大、速度太慢就是會造成材料毀損。在此一計畫中，我們發展利用紫外光雷射照射後，加熱使玻璃結晶性變化的方式來達成局部蝕刻率變化。在HF中，結晶部份濕蝕刻率增加，達到高選擇比 40 : 1 以上。致謝	i 中文摘要	ii Abstract	iii 目錄	iv 圖目錄	viii 表目錄	xvii 第一章 緒論	 1 1. 1 前言	 1 1. 2 3 D 整合系統的發展	 3 1. 3 研究動機	 7 第二章 3 D IC研究理論及發展方法	 8 2. 1 3 D IC 整合技術	 8 2. 2 3 D IC的基本結構及Interposer	 11 2. 3 TSVs (Through silicon via) 	 15 2. 3. 1 TSV簡介	 15 2. 3. 2 TSV製程	 16 2. 4 TGVs (<b>Through</b> <b>Glass</b> <b>Via)</b> 	 18 2. 4. 1 TGV 架構	 18 2. 4. 2 TGV 製程	 19 2. 5 TGVs with FOTURAN	 25 2. 5. 1 FOTURAN 材質介紹	 26 2. 5. 2 FOTURAN 標準製程	 26 2. 5. 3 飛秒雷射在FOTURAN上的應用	 30 第三章 實驗方法與步驟	 34 3. 1 實驗材料	 34 3. 1. 1 Glass	 34 3. 1. 2 化學藥劑	 37 3. 1. 3 光罩	 38 3. 2 實驗設備及量測儀器	 38 3. 2. 1 UV Laser	 38 3. 2. 2 雷射功率量測計	 40 3. 2. 3 爐管(Furnace) 	 41 3. 2. 4 超音波震盪器	 42 3. 2. 5 旋轉塗佈機(Spin Coater) 	 43 3. 2. 6 加熱台(hot plate) 	 44 3. 2. 7 螺旋測微器	 45 3. 2. 8 場發射掃描式電子顯微鏡(UltraPlus) 	 45 3. 2. 9 冷場發射掃描電子顯微鏡	 47 3. 2. 10 正立式金相顯微鏡	 48 3. 3 前置作業:試片清洗	 48 3. 4 一般玻璃製程	 49 3. 4. 1 Polymer Coating	 51 3. 4. 2 UV Laser Drilling	 52 3. 4. 3 Polymer remove	 53 3. 5 FOTURAN glass 製程	 53 3. 5. 1 UV laser exposure	 54 3. 5. 2 Annealing	 56 3. 5. 3 Wet etching	 58 3. 6 FOTURAN with hard mask 製程	 59 第四章 實驗結果與討論	 61 4. 1 雷射參數的測試	 61 4. 1. 1 規格與參數	 61 4. 1. 2 結果與分析	 62 4. 2 雷射對光罩的影響	 67 4. 2. 1 規格與參數	 67 4. 2. 3 結果與分析	 67 4. 3 0. 63 mm Eagle XG 玻璃single laser shot試驗	 69 4. 3. 1 規格與參數	 69 4. 3. 2 結果與分析	 70 4. 4 0. 21 mm D 263 T 玻璃laser single shot試驗	 75 4. 4. 1 規格與參數	 75 4. 4. 2 結果與分析	 76 4. 5 0. 63 mm Eagle XG 玻璃multi laser shot試驗	 81 4. 5. 1 規格與參數	 81 4. 5. 2 結果與分析	 81 4. 6 0. 21 mm D 263 T 玻璃multi laser shot試驗	 87 4. 6. 1 規格與參數	 87 4. 6. 2 結果與分析	 87 4. 7 0. 3 mm FOTURAN glass	 91 4. 7. 1 規格與參數	 91 4. 7. 2 結果與分析	 93 4. 8 0. 6 mm FOTURAN glass	 107 4. 8. 1 規格與參數	 107 4. 8. 2 結果與分析	 109 4. 9 0. 6 mm FOTURAN laser MarkingMate patterning	 116 4. 9. 1 規格與參數	 116 4. 9. 2 結果與分析	 117 4. 10 FOTURAN with hard mask	 122 第五章 結論與未來展望	 124 參考文獻	 12...|$|E

The TGVs were manufactured by adapting technique based on magnetic assembly developed at KTH for creating through silicon vias (TSVs). TGVs were fabricated by introducing nickel wires in via-holes that were pre-made on a glass substrate and applying a spin-on polymer {{to isolate the}} nickel wires from {{the walls of the}} via-holes. Another focus of this work was improving the TGV and TSV manufacturing process. This was done by investigating the inuence of the assembly speeds on the yield of the assembly process.

Also the inuence the pitch between the via-holes has on the yield of the process was investigated...|$|R

The integration of optical and electrical components is a particular challenge since the module is miniaturized {{in order to be}} integrated into any metallic workpieces.

40|$|As {{a result}} of their myriad of {{advantages}} over silicon and other conventional substrate technologies, glass substrates have received significant attention from the electronic packaging and system integration community worldwide. So far, most of the research effort on glass has concentrated on developing methods for fabricating cylindrical <b>through</b> <b>glass</b> <b>vias</b> (TGVs). However, to fully evaluate the potential of glass as an interposer material for microelectronic systems with computing and communication functions, an extensive characterization of interconnects and RF components on these substrates must be carried out. In this contribution, we go beyond state-of-the-art research and present an in-depth characterization of TGVs, coplanar lines and 60 GHz coplanar excited patch antennas on two glass substrates. One of these substrates has a low alkaline content (Borofloat 33 ®) and the other is alkaline-free (AF 32 ®). The effects of these glass materials on the RF performance of TGVs, coplanar lines and 60 GHz antennas are extensively studied, and recommendations for performance optimization are proposed. For experimental verification, test samples are fabricated and measured. Very good correlation is obtained between the measurement and simulation results from 100 MHz to 100 GHz...|$|R
40|$|Electrical-optical {{integration}} {{on board}} and module level is a rapidly growing field with a strong potential for applications in data and telecom. The driving forces are bandwidth demand, power efficiency and increased channel density. For higher degrees of integration thin glass substrates provide very promising options. The platform technology called "glassPack" relies on the realization of passive single mode and multi mode optical waveguides within the thin glass substrates and benefits of the excellent optical, chemical, and thermal properties of glass. Suitable technologies like ion-exchange and direct optical fiber butt coupling are used. The resulting waveguides are characterized by a graded refractive index profile. For electrical wiring thin film technologies can be applied and <b>through</b> <b>glass</b> <b>vias</b> have been demonstrated to address high frequency and high bandwidth applications. Furthermore planar waveguide array coupling elements of very flexible design can be a pplied for optical coupling and 90 degree light deflection.

40|$|Interposers for SiP {{will become}} more and more {{important}} for advanced electronic systems. But through substrate vias are essential for the 3 -D integration. Being a standard for laminate based materials this is much more complex for Si-wafers: High speed etching has to be combined with complex electrical isolation, diffusion barriers and void-free Cu-filling. Without doubt this can be solved in lab-scale but for high production scale cost is a tremendous barrier. Glass wafers with W-plugs have been intensively investigated in this paper. A new acronym has been posted to high-light this technology: TGV for <b>Through</b> <b>Glass</b> <b>Vias.</b> The results of modeling and simulation of TGV at RF/Microwave frequencies showed a very good compromise between wafer thickness, TGV-shape and via diameter for vertical metal plugs with 100 m diameters in 500 m thick glass wafer still very stable for thin film wafer processing without costly temporary wafer bonding processes. Therefore the HermeS® fro m Schott was chosen as the basis for a prototype of a bidirectional 4 × 10 Gbps electro-optical transceiver module. Thin film RDL and bumping of these wafers was possible without any modifications to Si-wafer. First thermal cycles showed very promising results for the reliability of this concept...|$|R
40|$|Electrical-optical {{integration}} is {{a rapidly growing}} field with a strong potential for applications in a wide spectrum covering optical sensors, data & telecom, respectively. The driving forces are bandwidth demand, power efficiency and increased channel density. For higher degrees of integration thin glass substrates provide very suitable properties. The technology of the "glassPack" concept relies on {{the realization of the}} passive single mode and multi mode optical waveguides within the thin glass substrates and benefits of the excellent optical, electrical, and thermal properties of glass itself. Suitable technologies are ion-exchange and direct optical butt coupling by laser fusion. The planar integrated single- or multi-mode waveguide is characterized by a graded refractive index profile. The laser fused fiber interconnect shows a determinate coupling loss. Also, planar waveguide array coupling elements of very flexible design can be applied for optical coupling and 90 degree light deflection. Novel innovative features are added to this packaging technique to leverage its generic usage. For electrical wiring thin film technologies and <b>through</b> <b>glass</b> <b>vias</b> have been demonstrated to address high integrate photonic System-in-packaging solutions. All together makes glass to the perfect platform for optical as well as electrical interconnects on board and module level. Multi-mode interconnects in thin glass layers of an EOCB as well as a glass based transceiver module show the integration potential of that approach. The demonstrated development {{goes hand in hand with}} ongoing trends in the area of silicon photonics to provide a suitable packaging and interconnection platform. Also the gap between single mode fiber interconnects and single mode SoI (silicon-on-insulator) waveguides in ICs (integrated circuit) can be bridged by the glass based interconnects on board and module level.
