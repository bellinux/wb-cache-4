5|$|Comet Hale–Bopp was {{observed}} intensively by astronomers during its perihelion passage, and several important advances in cometary science resulted from these observations. <b>The</b> <b>dust</b> production {{rate of the}} comet was very high (up to 2.0 kg/s), which may have made the inner coma optically thick. Based on the properties of <b>the</b> <b>dust</b> grains—high temperature, high albedo and strong 10μm silicate emission feature—the astronomers concluded <b>the</b> <b>dust</b> grains are smaller than observed in any other comet.|$|E

5|$|By 2005, the Spitzer Space Telescope had {{produced}} high-resolution infrared images of <b>the</b> <b>dust</b> around Vega. It {{was shown to}} extend out to 43″ (330AU) at a wavelength of 24μm, 70″ (543AU) at 70μm and 105″ (815AU) at 160μm. These much wider disks {{were found to be}} circular and free of clumps, with dust particles ranging from 1–50μm in size. The estimated total mass of this dust is 3 times the mass of the Earth. Production of <b>the</b> <b>dust</b> would require collisions between asteroids in a population corresponding to the Kuiper Belt around the Sun. Thus <b>the</b> <b>dust</b> is more likely created by a debris disk around Vega, rather than from a protoplanetary disk as was earlier thought.|$|E

5|$|In an {{alternative}} scenario, the exozodiacal dust may be generated in an outer belt that is orbiting between 55 and 90AU from Epsilon Eridani {{and has an}} assumed mass of 10−3 times the mass of Earth. This dust is then transported inward past the orbit of Epsilon Eridani b. When collisions between <b>the</b> <b>dust</b> grains are taken into account, <b>the</b> <b>dust</b> will reproduce the observed infrared spectrum and brightness. Outside the radius of ice sublimation, located beyond 10AU from Epsilon Eridani where the temperatures fall below 100K, the best fit to the observations occurs when a mix of ice and silicate dust is assumed. Inside this radius, <b>the</b> <b>dust</b> must consist of silicate grains that lack volatiles.|$|E
5|$|It was {{formerly}} thought that <b>the</b> <b>dust</b> was {{left over from}} the formation of the cluster, but at the age of about 100 million years generally accepted for the cluster, almost all <b>the</b> <b>dust</b> originally present would have been dispersed by radiation pressure.

5|$|Launched in 1983, {{the space}} {{telescope}} IRAS detected infrared emissions from stars near to the Sun, including an excess infrared emission from Epsilon Eridani.

Evidence for a planetary system was discovered in 1998 by the observation of asymmetries in this dust ring. The clumping in <b>the</b> <b>dust</b> distribution {{could be explained by}} gravitational interactions with a planet orbiting just inside <b>the</b> <b>dust</b> ring.|$|E

5|$|The {{detection}} of the Amalthea gossamer ring from the ground, in Galileo images and the direct dust measurements {{have allowed the}} determination of the particle size distribution, which appears to follow the same power law as <b>the</b> <b>dust</b> in the main ring with q=2 ± 0.5.

40|$|In {{order to}} qualify {{products}} {{with regard to the}} demands placed on them by environment-specific particular materials, the property profile of <b>the</b> <b>dusts</b> present in <b>the</b> product's surroundings must be known.

5|$|The {{origin of}} <b>the</b> <b>dust</b> bands is less problematic. <b>The</b> <b>dust</b> {{has a very}} short lifetime, 100–1000 years, and should be {{continuously}} replenished by collisions between larger ring particles, moonlets and meteoroids from outside the Uranian system. The belts of the parent moonlets and particles are themselves invisible due to their low optical depth, while <b>the</b> <b>dust</b> reveals itself in forward-scattered light. The narrow main rings and the moonlet belts that create dust bands are expected to differ in particle size distribution. The main rings have more centimeter to meter-sized bodies. Such a distribution increases the surface area of the material in the rings, leading to high optical density in back-scattered light. In contrast, <b>the</b> <b>dust</b> bands have relatively few large particles, which results in low optical depth.|$|E
