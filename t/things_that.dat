5|$|Damien Leith {{chose to}} name the album Where We Land as it {{described}} all the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> happened {{to him in the}} past year individually and professionally, and also illustrated his journey to Australia in various ways.|$|E
5|$|Due to the series' popularity, {{people who}} {{constantly}} complain and are irritated by minor things are often compared to Victor Meldrew by the British media. Renwick disputes this usage however, claiming that Victor's reactions are entirely {{in proportion to}} the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> happen to him.|$|E
5|$|The KCET 1997 {{documentary}} More <b>Things</b> <b>That</b> Aren't Here Anymore has {{a segment}} on Muntz and is broadcast by the station regularly during pledge periods.|$|E
5000|$|The major {{difference}} between a <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> might go wrong and a <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> cannot possibly go wrong is <b>that</b> when a <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> cannot possibly go wrong goes wrong it usually {{turns out to be}} impossible to get at or repair.|$|R

5|$|After a {{disastrous}} helicopter crash in 1999 {{resulting in the}} deaths of six Marines and one sailor, the US Navy performed an assessment of their equipment and decided among other <b>things</b> <b>that</b> they needed a new search and rescue knife. The KA-BAR knives issued to the SBUs (Special Boat Units) had catastrophically failed to cut the Marines free from their webbing.|$|E
5|$|As I {{look back}} on it today, I see the whole picture very differently. It's true that I hated missing out on Sexton. And the first few months, I was miserable at Everett. But being bused to Everett {{turned out to be one}} of the best <b>things</b> <b>that</b> ever {{happened}} to me. It got me out of my own little world and taught me how to understand white people, how to communicate and deal with them.|$|E
5|$|As The World Ends with You {{focuses on}} the {{character}} of Neku Sakuraba, {{in order to create a}} believable story the developers put a lot of focus on his development, such as how he would feel, what thoughts lie behind his actions, how he interacted with other characters, and how the people around him feel about him. The developers included aspects and daily concerns, hoping that they could be <b>things</b> <b>that</b> players would have to deal with their personal lives and therefore would let them relate with Neku.|$|E

60|$|The chief <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> {{makes life}} a failure from the artistic {{point of view}} is the <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> lends to life its sordid security--the fact that one can never repeat exactly the same emotion.|$|R
5|$|Coker {{grew up in}} Linden, New Jersey {{and became}} an Eagle Scout in Troop 32 of Saint Elizabeth's Catholic Church in Linden on January 27, 1959. He has stated that his passion for Scouting {{is one of the}} <b>things</b> <b>that</b> got him through his 6.5years as a POW in North Vietnam, to the point that at times all he could {{remember}} was the Scout Oath, but not the names of his family members.|$|E
5|$|I {{think it}} was really special to have behind-the-scenes photos, you know, {{pictures}} that the fans haven't seen before, all together of a very specific moment of my life, an album of my life. They just get {{to see all the}} <b>things</b> <b>that</b> they hadn't seen that were going on behind the scenes; really cool stuff, not typical. They're really fun photos. And even for me, when I look at them, they say so much. Photos really tell a thousand words.|$|E
5|$|If {{there is}} {{anything}} that humanity cannot produce, the being who produces it is better than humanity. But humanity cannot produce the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> are in the universe – the heavenly bodies, etc. The being, therefore, who produces them is superior to humanity. But who is there that is superior to humanity, except God? Therefore, God exists.|$|E
60|$|But, after all, {{there is}} no {{teaching}} any thing to wise men of good Mr. Lindsey's stamp. They know every thing--oh, to be sure!--every <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> has been, and every <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> is, and every <b>thing</b> <b>that,</b> by any future possibility, can be. And, should some phenomenon of nature or providence transcend their system, they will not recognize it, even if it come to pass under their very noses.|$|R

5000|$|A {{subject of}} {{information}} is the <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> is identified or described by a given instance or piece of information. (Most generally, a <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> is a subject of information could be either abstract or concrete; either mathematical or physical.) ...|$|R
5|$|In 1482, Leonardo, who {{according}} to Vasari was a talented musician, created a silver lyre {{in the shape}} of a horse's head. Lorenzo de' Medici sent Leonardo to Milan, bearing the lyre as a gift, to secure peace with Ludovico Sforza, Duke of Milan. At this time Leonardo wrote an often-quoted letter describing the many marvellous and diverse <b>things</b> <b>that</b> he could achieve in the field of engineering and informing Ludovico that he could also paint.|$|E
5|$|In 1818 the 49th {{parallel}} {{was established}} as {{the boundary between}} the United States and British North America. However, the point where the Red River crossed this line was not marked until 1823, when Stephen Long conducted a survey expedition. The expedition determined, among other <b>things,</b> <b>that</b> the fur trading post of Pembina lay just inside the U.S. border.|$|E
5|$|In September 1992, Woon was {{appointed}} to the select committee to review the Companies (Amendment) Bill (Bill No. 33/92) which proposed, among other <b>things,</b> <b>that</b> scripless trading in securities listed on the Stock Exchange of Singapore be authorised so that share transfers can be made through computerised book entries. He was a director of Intraco Ltd. (1989–2000) and Natsteel Ltd. (1997–2001), both listed on the Stock Exchange.|$|E
6000|$|... "On {{the subject}} of his {{religious}} scruples," [...] added John Effingham, [...] "he is so fastidiously exact, that I hear he 'says grace' over every <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> goes from his press, and 'returns thanks' for every <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> comes to it." ...|$|R
5000|$|Tagliani added: [...] "I said he (Tracy) {{should wear}} a straitjacket because <b>that's</b> the only <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> could keep him under control. And Sébastien (Bourdais) said he can't drive with that on, so maybe it's the only <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> could {{keep him out}} of trouble".|$|R
6000|$|... 'His faith,' said Erskine, 'was {{fixed in}} a <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> was false, in a <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> was unsound, in a <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> no Shakespearean scholar would accept for a moment. The theory would be laughed at. Don't {{make a fool}} of yourself, and don't follow a trail that leads nowhere. You start by {{assuming}} the existence of the very person whose existence is the thing to be proved. Besides, everybody knows that the Sonnets were addressed to Lord Pembroke. The matter is settled once for all.' ...|$|R
5|$|In captivity {{the green}} and golden bell frog is known to feed on crickets, fruit flies, maggots, silkworms, {{domestic}} flies, beetles, mealworms, larvae, slaters, cockroaches, molluscs, plague locusts, spiders, water snails, earthworms, and mice. A case of a small tiger snake being eaten has also been reported. Captive frogs have a habit of not responding to stationary food items, which has helped to form {{the belief that the}} frog will eat most <b>things</b> <b>that</b> move.|$|E
5|$|In word learning, {{the mapping}} problem {{refers to the}} {{question}} of how infants attach the forms of language to the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> they experience in the world. There are infinite objects, concepts, and actions in the world that words could be mapped onto. Many theories have been proposed to account for the way in which the language learner successfully maps words onto the correct objects, concepts, and actions.|$|E
5|$|It {{became a}} game, with Feiffer {{trying to draw}} things the way he wanted, and Juster trying to {{describe}} <b>things</b> <b>that</b> were impossible to sketch. These included the Triple Demons of Compromise—one short and fat, one tall and thin, and the third exactly like the first two. Feiffer got his revenge by depicting the author as the Whether Man, clad in a toga.|$|E
50|$|In Chile, {{there is}} a giant sea monster named Cuero, or Hide. It is a vast and flat <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> looks like {{stretched}} out animal hide that devours every living <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> it comes in contact with. It is also known to lure sailors to their death.|$|R
5000|$|Prus defines [...] "discovery" [...] as [...] "the {{finding out}} of a <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> has existed and exists in nature, but which was {{previously}} unknown to people"; and [...] "invention" [...] as [...] "the making of a <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> has not previously existed, and which nature itself cannot make." ...|$|R

5|$|It {{has also}} been argued against folk {{psychology}} that the intentionality of mental states like belief imply that they have semantic qualities. Specifically, their meaning {{is determined by the}} <b>things</b> <b>that</b> they are about in the external world. This makes it difficult to explain how they can play the causal roles that they are supposed to in cognitive processes.|$|E
5|$|It {{just seems}} like a feel-good record but when you really listen to the lyrics, it's about me growing up. In my household, I didn't go all of the parties and I didn't do all the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> {{a lot of the}} other teenage girls did because I was so in love with my radio and my music. I was so in love with this radio and my parents were happy that I was into {{something}} positive.|$|E
5|$|It's {{definitely}} riskier {{than something}} a bit more... simple. I {{just heard the}} track and loved {{that it was so}} different: it felt a bit African, a bit electronic and futuristic. It reminded me of what I love, which is mixing different cultures and eras — <b>things</b> <b>that</b> typically don't go together — to create a new sound. I can never be safe; I always try and go against the grain. As soon as I accomplish one thing, I just set a higher goal. That's how I've gotten to where I am.|$|E
60|$|But, {{to return}} to the more {{immediate}} subject of our lucubrations: It seems almost like a fatality, that Lord Byron has hardly ever praised any <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> he has not at some other period censured, or censured any <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> he has not, by and bye, praised or practised.|$|R
