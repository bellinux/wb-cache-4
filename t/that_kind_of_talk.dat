[...] He had ignored German economic naysayers, and told Hermann Göring [...] "that everyone on all sides was always raising economic misgivings against a threatening war with Russia. From now onwards he wasn't going to listen to any more of <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>talk</b> and from now on he was going to stop up his ears in order to get his peace of mind." [...] This was passed on to General Georg Thomas, who had been preparing reports on the negative economic consequences of a Soviet invasion—that it would be a net economic drain unless it was captured intact. Given Hitler's latest demands regarding negative advice, Thomas revised his report. [...] Reich Finance Minister Schwerin-Krosigk also opposed an invasion, arguing that Germany would lose grain because of Soviet scorched-earth policies, lack of effective Soviet transport and the loss of production labor with a German attack in the East. [...] Schnurre agreed with the economic loss assessment.|$|E

Nations control the impact of international regulation on domestic business interests by implementing legislation to preserve fundamental rights. Thus, the sovereignty-based legal harmonization model better explains the baseline characteristics of national sovereignty while recognizing that global cooperation in business is a necessary and positive feature of multilateralism. Critics dismiss sovereignty as irrelevant, claiming instead that a "new world order" has emerged in its place. <b>That</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> deconstructionist <b>talk</b> typically injects fear of multilateralism into the global business community.

We {{are all in the}} business of communication, and yet {{there is reason to believe}} that much of the interaction that takes place in language classrooms has little or nothing to do with real communication and that some of it tends to infantilise learners. I suggest some possible reasons for this and look at some ways in which the problem can be addressed, with reference to questioning, thinking skills, language awareness work and cross-curricular links in teaching and materials.

This course determines the students’ success in joining and {{finishing}} other English {{courses in the}} following semester. Since the classroom {{is the place where}} comprehensible input and modified interaction are available, what goes on inside the language classroom is very important. This situation challenges the writer to observe the IC classrooms. So far, there has never been done to see what actually happens in IC classrooms in terms <b>of</b> student <b>talk.</b> The objectives <b>of</b> this study are to know various <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> student <b>talk</b> <b>that</b> are found in IC classes and a <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> student <b>talk</b> is commonly xx used in IC classes. This study based on the theory Seventeen-Category System by Tsui Bik May, theory of Acquisition-Learning Hypothesis, and the Monitor Hypothesis by Stephen Krashen. An observation has been applied as the research design of this study since it is a qualitative research. Three voice recorders, a set of video camera, observation tally sheets, interview sheets, and the writer itself are the instruments of this study. Eighty students of IC classes who consist of three classes, IC A with thirty students, IC B twenty three students, IC C with twenty seven students, and four teachers who consist of two males and two females are chosen as the subject of this study. In analyzing the data, the writer has transcribed the spoken data using an application named “Transcriber 1. 5. 1 ” and has classified the data based on the theory Seventeen- Category System by Tsui Bik May. This observation has discovered <b>that</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> student <b>talk</b> are found in IC classes are students’ response restricted reply, students’response expanded reply, students’ response apologize, students’ initiate elicit, and students’ initiate interrupt. Students’ response restricted reply takes up the major portion <b>of</b> student <b>talk</b> in IC classes. It is suggested that the students’ initiate and students’ response are balance in IC classes.

In order to reveal the host's manipulations, we have examined the verbal interactions between host and guests on the following issues: topic choice, turn-taking mechanisms and identity construction <b>of</b> the <b>talk</b> show's guests. In the perspective <b>that</b> this <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>talk</b> show presents itself as a public space where direct democracy can be exercised, the analysis of the discursive strategies <b>of</b> the <b>talk</b> show host reveals the impact of a mediatic participation framework.

Sendo a principal característica do talk show a desestabilização das regras implícitas e o framework de participação, observamos como o tal direito democrático de expressão é interpretado pelo apresentador para manter a dinâmica do programa. Para revelar suas manipulações, examinamos as interações verbais entre apresentador e convidados nos seguintes temas: escolha do tópico, mecanismos de tomada de turno e construção de identidade dos convidados. É nessa perspectiva que este tipo de programa se apresenta como um espaço público onde a democracia direta pode ser exercitada; a análise das estratégias discursivas do apresentador do talk show revela o impacto de um framework de participação mediada...|$|R

The movement of a wave, the colour of a stone, anything, was enough for Knight's drowsy thoughts of that day to precipitate themselves upon. Even the sermonizing platitudes the vicar had delivered himself of--chiefly because something seemed to be professionally required of him {{in the presence of a}} man of Knight's proclivities--were swallowed whole.

She was always scattering her profanities around, and they were such a satisfaction to me that I never dreamed {{of such a thing}} as modifying her. For my own sake, I had no disposition to tell on her. Indeed I took pains to keep her from being found out. I told her to confine her religious exercises to the children's quarters, and urged her to remember that Mrs. Clemens was prejudiced against pieties on week-days. To the children, the little maid's profanities sounded natural and proper and right, because they had been used to <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>talk</b> in Germany, and they attached no evil importance to it. It grieves me that I have forgotten those vigorous remarks. I long hoarded them in my memory as a treasure. But I remember one of them still, because I heard it so many times. The trial of that little creature's life was the children's hair. She would tug and strain with her comb, accompanying her work with her misplaced pieties. And when finally she was through with her triple job she always fired up and exploded her thanks toward the sky, where they belonged, in this form: [...] "Gott sei Dank ich bin fertig mit'm Gott verdammtes Haar!"
