40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Torque measurement of a rotating shaft is a method of monitoring machine performance. Steady transmission of mechanical power from the prime mover to the load is vital to avoid gear and bearing wear, shaft fatigue failure, bearing and coupling failure and noise. Mean and fluctuating torque are fundamental quantities of interest. The laser <b>torquemeter</b> is capable of providing a non-contact measurement of time-resolved torque through a driven system. The laser <b>torquemeter</b> depends upon laser speckle produced from coherent light illuminating a diffuse object and the speckle pattern {{may be used in}} determining the angular position of a rotating object. When the object rotates the backscattered speckle pattern, which changes continuously but repeats exactly with every revolution, is sampled by a suitably positioned photo detector. The photo detector output signal is periodic and one period is recorded in memory as a reference and the angular position of a shaft can then be determined by a comparison of this recorded reference signal with the current photo detector output signal. The speckle pattern from two axially separated points on the shaft are monitored and under low or, ideally, zero torque the photo detector outputs are recorded into the laser <b>torquemeter</b> electronics. The laser <b>torquemeter</b> then tracks the live photo detector output and determines the angle at the two points on the shaft. Relative angular displacement in the two angle outputs appears when torque is applied and the shaft twists. When the shaft is displaced, for example by vibration, the backscattered speckle pattern changes on the photo detector and the similarity between the recorded, reference signal and the live, current signal is reduced. In this thesis, the cross-correlation of the real-time photodetector output signal and the recorded reference signal as a function of shaft position is examined. The effects of various shaft motions - rotation, axial translation, pitch and yaw, and radial translation are theoretically and experimentally examined and the results can then be used in the design of an optical head for the laser <b>torquemeter.</b> A review of the current <b>torquemeter</b> technology allows for discussion of the broad spectrum of typical <b>torquemeter</b> operating conditions. The optical head of the laser <b>torquemeter</b> may vary significantly for various torque measurement scenarios. A design procedure for the optical head of the laser <b>torquemeter</b> is summarised. The holy grail of <b>torquemeter</b> manufacturers is to produce a cheap, easy to use, robust, accurate, reliable and non-contacting <b>torquemeter.</b> The laser torque meter has great potential to meet these requirements...|$|E

40|$|Background: Robot-assisted ankle {{assessment}} {{could potentially}} be conducted using sensor-based and model-based methods. Existing ankle rehabilitation robots usually use <b>torquemeters</b> and multiaxis load cells for measuring joint dynamics. These measurements are accurate, but the contribution {{as a result of}} muscles and ligaments is not taken into account. Some computational ankle models have been developed to evaluate ligament strain and joint torque. These models do not include muscles and, thus, are not suitable for an overall ankle assessment in robot-assisted therapy. Methods: This study proposed a computational ankle model for use in robot-assisted therapy with three rotational degrees of freedom, 12 muscles, and seven ligaments. This model is driven by robotics, uses three independent position variables as inputs, and outputs an overall ankle assessment. Subject-specific adaptations by geometric and strength scaling were also made to allow for a universal model. Results: This model was evaluated using published results and experimental data from 11 participants. Results show a high accuracy in the evaluation of ligament neutral length and passive joint torque. The subject-specific adaptation performance is high, with each normalized root-mean-square deviation value less than 10 %. Conclusion: This model could be used for ankle assessment, especially in evaluating passive ankle torque, for a specific individual. The characteristic that is unique to this model is the use of three independent position variables that can be measured in real time as inputs, which makes it advantageous over other models when combined with robot-assisted therapy...|$|R

30|$|Fastening screws {{with the}} {{appropriate}} torque {{is very important for}} the success of an implant. First, fastening is done with a hand driver, and then final fastening must be done at a certain torque with a torque wrench. It is very important that to know whether we can exert a torque of how much with hand driver in advance. However, dentists may not have the same torque wrench that is used in the implant system of another dental clinic. There are also implant systems that do not have a torque wrench, and it is important for each dentist to know what torque can be exerted with the hand driver. Doing so requires the use of a <b>torquemeter</b> (Shiigai 2007), but it is not realistic for a general-practice dentist to be equipped with a <b>torquemeter.</b> Therefore, we have developed and introduce here a simple adapter that makes it possible to use a standard torque wrench already in one’s possession to measure the torque that can be exerted with a hand driver.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} initiates a {{study of}} the mechanics of four roll plate bending and provides a methodology to investigate the process experimentally. To carry out the research a suitable model bender was designed and constructed. The model bender was comprehensively instrumented with ten load cells, three <b>torquemeters</b> and a tachometer. A rudimentary analysis of the four roll pre-bending mode considered the three critical bending operations. The analysis also gave an assessment of the model bender capacity for the design stage. The analysis indicated that an increase in the coefficient of friction in the contact region of the pinch rolls and the plate would reduce the pinch resultant force required to end a plate to a particular bend radius. The mechanisms involved in the four roll plate bending process were investigated and a mathematical model evolved to determine the mechanics of four roll thin plate bending. A theoretical and experimental investigation was conducted for the bending of HP 30 aluminium plates in both single and multipass bending modes. The study indicated that the multipass plate bending mechanics of the process varied according to the number of bending passes executed and the step decrement of the anticipated finished bend radius in any two successive passes (i. e. the bending route). Experimental results for single pass bending indicated that the rollers normally exert a higher bending load for the steady-continous bending with the pre-inactive side roll oper?tive. For the pre-bending mode and the steady-continous bending mode with the pre-active side roll operative, the former exerted the higher loads. The single pass results also indicated that the force on the side roll, the torque and power steadily increased as the anticipated bend radius decreased. Theoretical predictions for the plate internal resistance to accomplish finished bend radii of between 2500 mm and 500 mm for multipass bending HP 30 aluminium plates, suggested that there was a certain bending route which would effectively optimise the bender capacity...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an experimental investigation of the power input of pitched blade impellers and standard Rushton turbine impellers in a cylindrical vessel provided with four radial baffles at its wall under a turbulent regime of flow of an agitated liquid. The influence of the geometry of the pitched blade impellers (pitch angle, number of blades) and the off-bottom impeller clearance of both high-speed impellers tested on the impeller power input is determined in two sizes of the cylindrical vessel (0. 3 m and 0. 8 m diameter of vessel). A strain gauge <b>torquemeter</b> is used in the small vessel and a phase shift mechanical <b>torquemeter</b> is used in the large vessel. All results of the experiments correspond to the condition that the Reynolds number modified for the impeller exceeds ten thousand. The results of this study show that the significant influence of the separating disk thickness of the turbine impeller corresponds fairly well to the empirical equations presented in the literature. Both the influence of the number of impeller blades and the blade pitch angle of the pitched blade impeller were expressed quantitatively by means of the power dependence of the recently published correlations: the higher the pitch angle and the number of blades, the higher the values of the impeller power input. Finally, it follows from results of this study that the impeller off-bottom clearance has a weak influence on the power input of the Rushton turbine impeller, but with decreasing impeller off-bottom clearance the power input of the pitched blade impeller increases significantly...|$|E

40|$|NASA Glenn Research Center's Single-Stage Axial Compressor Facility was {{upgraded}} {{in fiscal}} year 2003 to expand and improve its research capabilities for testing high-speed fans and compressors. The old 3000 -hp drive motor and gearbox were removed and replaced with a refurbished 7000 -hp drive motor and gearbox, with a maximum output speed of 21, 240 rpm. The higher horsepower rating permits testing of fans and compressors with higher pressure ratio or higher flow. A new inline <b>torquemeter</b> was installed to provide an alternate measurement of fan and compressor efficiency, along with the standard pressure and temperature measurements. A refurbished compressor bearing housing was also installed with bidirectional rotation capability, so {{that a variety of}} existing hardware could be tested. Four new lubrication modules with backup capability were installed for the motor, gearbox, <b>torquemeter,</b> and compressor bearing housing, so that in case the primary pump fails, the backup will prevent damage to the rotating hardware. The combustion air supply line for the facility inlet air system was activated to provide dry air for repeatable inlet conditions. New flow conditioning hardware was installed in the facility inlet plenum tank, which greatly reduced the inlet turbulence. The new inlet can also be easily modified to accommodate 20 - or 22 -in. -diameter fans and compressors, so a variety of existing hardware from other facilities (such as Glenn's 9 - by 15 -Foot Low-Speed Wind Tunnel) can be tested in the Single-Stage Axial Compressor Facility. An exhaust line was also installed to provide bleed capability to remove the inlet boundary layer. To improve the operation and control of the facility, a new programmable logic controller (PLC) was installed to upgrade from hardwired relay logic to software logic. The PLC also enabled the usage of human-machine interface software to allow for easier operation of the facility and easier reconfiguration of the facility controls when necessary.

The application of wake models that assume a constant axial velocity profile in the wake based on the measured hub-height velocity can lead to errors in Annual Energy Production predictions of the order of 5 % for typical wind farms. The application of wake models that assume an axisymmetric Gaussian velocity profile could lead to prediction errors of the order of 20 %.

When the object rotates the backscattered speckle pattern, which changes continuously but repeats exactly with every revolution, is sampled by a suitably positioned photodetector. The photodetector output signal is periodic, and one period is stored in the memory as a reference. Shaft position can then be determined by the comparison of this stored reference signal with the current photodetector output signal. When the shaft is axially displaced, for example, by vibration, the backscattered speckle pattern changes on the photodetector and the similarity between the reference signal and the current signal is reduced. We examine the cross correlation of the real-time photodetector output signal and the stored reference signal as a function of axial shaft position. Use of a rotating shaft when collecting data is shown to be an efficient means by which to make effectively several thousand independent estimates of the maximum axial displacement tolerable before decorrelation of the photodetector output. Theoretical results and experiments conducted show that the decorrelation displacement varies, according to optical configuration, to a maximum value of 0. 7 of the beam diameter. This has important implications for a proposed laser <b>torquemeter</b> as well as additional applications in which changes to the sampled speckle pattern, including decorrelation, are either desirable or undesirable...|$|E

A hundred and forty-four files were submitted to the bending test in a <b>torquemeter</b> with a scale. The results made evident that the recrystallizing thermal treatment was able to cause a decrease on the bending resistance of the K type files between 56. 78 and 82. 06 % (alpha = 0. 05 %). The Flexofile® files presented a decrease on the bending resistance between 1. 94 and 50. 60 % (alpha = 0. 05 %), in comparison with non-treated Flexofile® files, except for number 25. In conclusion, the recrystallizing thermal treatment, as proposed, reduces the bending resistance of K type files in a significant way, and of Flexofile® files in a less marked way...|$|E
40|$|Surface {{treatment}} {{interferes with}} the primary stability of dental implants because it promotes a chemical and micromorphological change {{on the surface and}} thus stimulates osseointegration. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of different surface treatments on primary stability by analyzing insertion torque (IT) and pullout force (PF). Eight samples of implants with different surface treatments (TS - external hexagon with acid surface treatment; and MS - external hexagon, machined surface), all 3. 75 mm in diameter x 11. 5 mm in length, were inserted into segments of artificial bones. The IT of each sample was measured by an electronic <b>torquemeter,</b> and then the pullout test was done with a universal testing machine. The results were subjected to ANOVA (p < 0. 05), followed by Tukey's test (p < 0. 05). The IT results showed no statistically significant difference, since the sizes of the implants used were very similar, and the bone used was not highly resistant. The PF values (N) were, respectively, TS = 403. 75 +/- 189. 80 and MS = 276. 38 +/- 110. 05. The implants were shown to be different in terms of the variables of maximum force (F = 4. 401, p = 0. 0120), elasticity in maximum flexion (F = 3. 672, p = 0. 024), and relative stiffness (F = 4. 60, p = 0. 01). In this study, external hexagonal implants with acid surface treatment showed the highest values of pullout strength and better stability, which provide greater indication for their use.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} through strain gauge the strain distribution occurred around 3 Morse taper implants with positioning offset, by varying the types of copings: plastic and machined. Microunit prosthetic abutments were connected onto the implant platforms. Ten frameworks composed of 3 copings were casted in cobalt-chromium alloy as single block (Co-Cr). Half of the copings were machined (n= 5) and half were made of plastics (n= 5). Four strain gauges were placed into the polyurethane block tangential to the 3 implants. The frameworks were fixed at their respective sites with the aid of a retaining screw with torque of 20 N. cm, achieve with a mechanical <b>torquemeter.</b> The vertical load of 30 Kg was applied through a spherical point of 2 mm diameter for 10 s, onto each one of the 3 screws of the framework through a device for load application The records of the strain reading were submitted to ANOVA and Tukey tests (5 %). There were statistically significant differences (p= 0. 0174) between the coping type used (machined and plastic). The micro strain mean values were: point C at the machined coping 282. 5 μm (± 120. 8), point B at the machined coping 229. 5 μm (± 76. 1), point A at the machined coping 209. 8 μm (± 55. 0), point C at the plastic coping 155. 0 μm (± 30. 5), point B at the plastic coping 146. 2 μm (± 25. 8) and point A at the plastic coping 130. 36 μm (± 21. 83). It was concluded that there was a significant difference between the coping types, once the plastic coping exerted smaller micro strain on Morse taper implants than the machined copings...|$|E
40|$|LectureA new {{technology}} challenge in centrifugal compressor design and operation is the condensate phase management. End users (especially in offshore and subsea operations) {{are more and}} more interested to have a Wet Gas Compression system which is able to tolerate liquid in the process gas. Authors? Company has initiated for several years a research program aiming to investigate the impact of the liquid phase on centrifugal compressor operability (mainly thermodynamics, rotordynamics, erosion, axial thrust). As an introduction, the Authors? Company past experiences and more recent experimental tests [Ransom D. et al. 2011], [Bertoneri M. et al. 2012], are reviewed in order to show how the rotordynamic behaviour of a centrifugal compressor may be affected by the wet gas. However in the core, this paper is focused on the novel rotordynamic experimental outcomes of a wet gas single stage compressor test campaign. The machine was equipped with the following special instrumentation: Pressure and temperature probes along the flow path and internal seals; Magnetic lamination installed on the shaft end to allow for stability test through a magnetic exciter; Load cells installed in the thrust bearing; <b>Torquemeter</b> installed at the compressor coupling. The explored test conditions were: Wet gas = Air and Water mixture up to 3 % of Liquid Volume Fraction (LVF); Suction pressure levels = 10, 15, 20 bar-a; Maximum Continuous Speed = 13500 rpm. The compressor went through an extensive test campaign where the following aspects were thoroughly investigated: Rotordynamic behaviour during steady state wet operation; Rotordynamic stability (through magnetic exciter); Transient phenomena: response to liquid load variations (LVF up to 8 %), start-up/shutdown from wet conditions, start-up with stratified flow into suction pipe. The compressor dynamic behaviour was monitored both from lateral viewpoint (using no contact probes located close to bearing locations) and axial/torsional viewpoint (through the special instrumentation described above). Overall the compressor was able to withstand a huge amount of liquid phase, with an increased vibration level with respect to dry conditions but still in the safe area, both in steady and transient tests. Finally, major differences were found only at high flow ? high liquid/gas density ratio conditions where an unexpected subsynchronous vibration (SSV) was showing up. The nature of this SSV was deeply investigated and finally it was fixed through a balance piston seal geometry change...|$|E
40|$|OBJETIVO: Desenvolver uma porca para fixação óssea (PFO) com o objetivo de aumentar a estabilidade da osteossíntese interna. MÉTODOS: Foram utilizados 16 cadáveres frescos (32 extremidades proximais do úmero), sendo oito masculinos e oito femininos, com média de idade de 60, 56 anos. Em cada um dos 16 cadáveres, o úmero de um dos braços foi fixado com sistema de placa-parafuso-PFO e o contralateral, com o sistema placa-parafuso-porca de metal convencional. Foi aplicada uma força sobre os sistemas, medida por meio de torquímetro, até que um dos elementos falhasse (porca de polietileno, porca convencional ou osso). Depois, foi medida a força usada individualmente por 20 ortopedistas para apertar parafusos até que acreditassem que o sistema podia ser considerado como estável. Todos os resultados foram anotados e avaliados estatisticamente. RESULTADOS: Na avaliação da força média utilizada para aperto de parafusos, nas fixações rotineiras, individualmente, por 20 ortopedistas experientes, registrou-se a força média de 3, 18 N. m, força esta {{inferior}} à resistência do sistema placa-parafuso-PFO, que foi de 6, 37 N. m. A falha do sistema no osso com a PFO ocorreu em três casos e do sistema no osso com a porca de metal, em 10. CONCLUSÃO: A porca PFO mostrou-se menos agressiva ao osso que a porca metálica convencional, apresentando menor índice de fratura no osso. A força média aplicada pelo ortopedista não é capaz de quebrar a porca e levar a falha do sistema. OBJECTIVE: To {{develop a}} bone fixation nut (PFO) {{for the purpose}} of increasing the internal osteosynthesis stability. METHODS: 16 fresh cadavers were used (32 proximal humeral extremities), eight male and eight female, mean age of 60. 56 years. In each of the 16 cadavers, the humerus of one of the arms was fixated with a PFO-plate-screw system, and the contralateral was fixated with the plate-screw-nut system made of conventional metal. A load was applied on the system and measured by a <b>torquemeter</b> till one of the elements failed (polyethylene nut, conventional nut, or bone). The load individually used by 20 orthopedists to tighten the screws till the point they believed that the system was stable was measured. All of the results were noted down and statistically evaluated. RESULTS: In the evaluation of the mean load used to tighten the screws, in routine fixations, individually, by 20 experienced orthopedists, a mean load of 3. 18 N. m was found, this load being lower than the strength of the PFO-plate-screw system, that was 6. 37 N. m. Failure of the system in the bone with the PFO occurred in three cases and failure of the system with the metal nut occurred in 10 cases. CONCLUSION: The PFO nut showed to be less aggressive to the bone than the conventional metal nut, and presented a lower incidence of bone fracture. The mean load applied by the orthopedist is not sufficient to break the nut and lead to a system failure...|$|E
