However,multiple equilibria typically exist and the second-best outcome is never a stable equilibrium. Other properties of the different possible equilibria are studied, as well as the impact ofsupra-national policies aimed at encouraging the development of international services.

40|$|Infrastructure {{managers}} outsource {{maintenance activities}} to maintenance service contractors. This {{gives rise to}} misalignment between a contractor's short-term objectives and an infrastructure manager's long-term objectives. Infrastructure managers have started to explore various forms of contracts in which they incentivize contractors {{to work in the}} infrastructure managers' best interest. In this master thesis, a game-theoretical approach is taken for the design of new contracts. In order to align their objectives, <b>the</b> <b>infrastructure</b> <b>manager</b> announces a policy to the contractor, in which he specifies which decisions he will make as a reaction to the contractor's decisions. This problem is formulated as a dynamic reverse Stackelberg game. The payment scheme the leader pays to the follower is considered the leader function. This payment scheme is dependent on the infrastructure's failure rate. The resulting game allows both parties to achieve the best possible result, while taking into account the hierarchical and the sequential aspects of an infrastructure maintenance contract. In the resulting dynamic reverse Stackelberg game, both players maximize their utility over their planning window by adapting to each other's decisions at each consecutive decision stage. The utility of the leader is dependent on the infrastructure's failure rate, that in turn is dependent on the infrastructure's deterioration dynamics and all maintenance actions. <b>The</b> <b>infrastructure</b> <b>manager</b> gives the contractor incentives to perform the maintenance actions that are optimal for <b>the</b> <b>infrastructure</b> <b>manager,</b> at stages that are optimal for <b>the</b> <b>infrastructure</b> <b>manager.</b> This results in a leader function for <b>the</b> <b>infrastructure</b> <b>manager</b> and a set of maintenance actions for the contractor that maximize each player's utility. Two scenarios have been examined: one with complete information and one with incomplete information. Two models have been constructed based on this game: a general model and a replacement threshold model that restricts the follower to apply a threshold to the condition of the infrastructure; replacements are then performed at the stage that the condition of the infrastructure passes a threshold. The first model achieves the best possible result, while the second model is more realistic and more computationally efficient. The models can be used by infrastructure managers to design contracts to optimize their utility. Mechanical, Maritime and Materials EngineeringDelft Center for Systems and Contro...|$|E

Either this outcome is not an equilibrium, however, or the two countries could end up by choosing either the subsidy or the no-subsidy system, depending on the magnitude of the fixed costs of the networks and the characteristics of the final demand for services; moreover, in the latter case, the second-best outcome is not a stable equilibrium. Other properties of these equilibria are studied, as well as the impact of supra-national policies aimed at alleviating the excessive pricing of access on international services.

As a consequence, <b>the</b> <b>infrastructure</b> <b>manager</b> Jernbaneverket (now Bane NOR) has invested in their own weather monitoring stations, located at prioritized positions along the railway line. Eight of these are located on the Nordland Line [42]. One major reason for setting up these weather monitoring stations is the expected increase in extreme weather due to climatic change [43]. In relation to extreme weather, punctuality is important, but it is even more important to avoid major damages on the railway line, which may cause that the line closes for longer periods. Such closings are particularly damaging to the railway’s reputation. For example, at the time of writing, the Nordland Line was closed for 5  days from April 22 because large amounts of water from melted snow washed away several metres of the railway substructure in the north of Mosjøen. The snow melting season in the spring is exposed for such long-lasting disruptions.
