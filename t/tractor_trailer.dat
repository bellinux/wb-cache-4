5|$|Although {{no longer}} a {{tropical}} cyclone, remnant moisture from Rick enhanced a strong cold front over the Great Plains of the United States. Severe thunderstorms occurred over parts of the southern states, with at least three tornadoes touching down in Louisiana. Further north, the complex brought heavy rainfall to the northeast and parts of southern Canada. In Louisiana, the storm system spawned seven tornadoes, two of which were ranked as EF-1. One of these tornadoes damaged more than 10structures, destroyed a grain silo, flipped a <b>tractor</b> <b>trailer</b> and left numerous residents without power. In all, the tornadoes left nearly $1million in losses and injured one person.|$|E
5|$|Barry dropped {{moderate}} to heavy rainfall across Florida, peaking at 6.99inches (178mm) at Palm Beach International Airport; several other locations reported over 3inches (75mm). The rainfall alleviated persistent drought conditions and assisted in combating severe wildfires across the state. In Brevard County, the rainfall closed {{a portion of}} Eau Gallie Boulevard after a large sinkhole developed. Several other roads across the area were flooded, and on Interstate 95 near Lake Worth, a sinkhole closed two lanes of traffic. Wet roads caused several traffic accidents across the state; in both Brevard and Volusia counties, a motorist was killed from an accident. On Interstate 4, a <b>tractor</b> <b>trailer</b> led to disruptions near Orlando after it crashed into a guardrail.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{completion}} of I-287's New Jersey portion in 1993, more out-of-state <b>tractor</b> <b>trailer</b> drivers began to use the alignment of Route31 as a toll-free alternative to the New Jersey Turnpike. On July 16, 1999, oversize trucks were banned from using Route31 {{as part of a}} larger statewide ban imposed on New Jersey roads not a part of the National Highway System by then-governor Christine Todd Whitman. The legislation had a significant effect on trucks that followed Route31 as it forced them to use I-287 and the New Jersey Turnpike instead. In themid-2000s, the portion of Route31 was widened during extensive construction between Flemington and Clinton that widened the road to four lanes.|$|E

5|$|Rainfall reached 1inch (25mm) in {{portions}} of western Connecticut and Massachusetts. Strong surf from Isabel caused {{a man to}} drown after losing his footing along the beach near Narragansett, Rhode Island, and being swept out to sea. Officials in Connecticut contacted a water company in Watertown and a grocer in Cheshire for donations to assist the residents affected in North Carolina. A few days after Isabel moved ashore, the officials sent a <b>tractor</b> <b>trailer</b> truck with 2,000gallons (7570l) of water and 25,000pounds (11,340kg) of ice to North Carolina. In Vermont, the strong pressure gradient produced a peak wind gust of 55mph (89km/h) in Pleasant Valley, causing sporadic downed trees and power lines throughout the state. In Richmond, trees fell on and damaged threetrucks, and in Salisbury a falling tree damaged a car. Damage in the state totaled about $100,000 (2003USD, $117,000 in 2008USD).

500|$|As {{the company}} grew, it split its {{production}} operations, with the Harrisburg location mixing {{the ice cream}} and a new facility in Lower Swatara Township used for the actual hardening and packaging of the product. While local orders continued to be delivered in small Hershey's Ice Cream refrigerated trucks, the company shifted to transporting most of its ice cream to refrigerated <b>tractor</b> <b>trailer</b> trucks, enabling it to stretch its market beyond the state of Pennsylvania. It expanded its distribution facilities, eventually occupying 22 co-owned distribution centers. This enabled the company to ship products out more quickly after orders are received and resulted in less travel time for the products, ensuring freshness and quality were maintained. In the summer months, the company greatly increased its workforce and leased additional cold-storage space to help meet the seasonal orders, as the orders were prepared by hand. In 1998, operations were modernized and automated when the company purchased [...] in nearby Middletown where it constructed a modern 1.3 million cubic foot warehouse, enabling it to boost its efficiency, reducing the need to increase its summer workforce, and reducing the frequent product loss caused by hand orders and inefficient packing systems. The modernization of its warehouse also improved inventory management, order accuracy, and has helped the company continue its growth.|$|E

500|$|Filming {{moved to}} the Los Angeles area, where some sets were built on a Warner Bros. sound stage, {{including}} the interior rooms of Saito's Japanese castle (the exterior was done on a small set built in Malibu beach). The dining room {{was inspired by the}} Nijo Castle built around 1603. These sets were inspired by a mix of Japanese architecture and Western influences. The production also staged a multi-vehicle car chase on the streets of downtown Los Angeles, which involved a freight train crashing down the middle of a street. To do this, the filmmakers configured a train engine on the chassis of a <b>tractor</b> <b>trailer.</b> The replica was made from fiberglass molds taken from authentic train parts and then matched in terms of color and design. Also, the car chase was supposed to be set {{in the midst of a}} downpour but the L.A. weather stayed typically sunny. The filmmakers were forced to set up elaborate effects (e.g., rooftop water cannons) to give the audience the impression that the weather was overcast and soggy. L.A. was also the site of the climactic scene where a Ford Econoline van flies off the Schuyler Heim Bridge in slow motion. This sequence was filmed on and off for months with the van being shot out of a cannon, according to actor Dileep Rao. Capturing the actors suspended within the van in slow motion took a whole day to film. Once the van landed in the water, the challenge for the actors was not to panic. [...] "And when they ask you to act, it's a bit of an ask," [...] explained Cillian Murphy. The actors had to be underwater for four to five minutes while drawing air from scuba tanks; underwater buddy breathing is shown in this sequence. Cobb's house was in Pasadena. The hotel lobby was filmed at the CAA building in Century City. Limbo was made on location in Los Angeles and Morocco with the beach scene filmed at Palos Verdes beach with CGI buildings. N Hope St. in Los Angeles was the primary filming location for Limbo, with green screen and CGI being used to create the dream landscape.|$|E
