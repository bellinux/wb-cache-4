5|$|During Team Canada's stay in Moscow, the team's {{treatment}} {{was the source}} of numerous complaints by the players. When leaving Sweden, the team was informed that the players would stay at one hotel, <b>their</b> <b>wives</b> at another. The players threatened not to go, and the arrangements were changed to keep the players and wives together at the Intourist Hotel. The players' wives were fed sub-standard food and the players would smuggle some of their food to <b>their</b> <b>wives.</b> The team had contracted to have Canadian beer and steaks delivered to them in Moscow. The beer was lost at the airport, while the steaks were cut in half. At a practice after game six, the Soviets tried to cut short the Canadians' practice.|$|E
5|$|In social circles, Aspasia {{was noted}} for her {{ability as a}} conversationalist and adviser rather than merely an object of {{physical}} beauty. Plutarch writes that despite her immoral life, friends of Socrates brought <b>their</b> <b>wives</b> to hear her converse.|$|E

The king decreed that they should inhabit the countryside south of the capital extending from Ambavahadimitafo southward to Ambatolampy. Outside of Antananarivo, the Zana-tompo lived {{in the village of}} Ambohimalaza.|$|E
5|$|After Tiku's death, {{the colonial}} powers hoped {{that he would}} be forgotten, a hope which was not realised; Tandibua' rebelled in 1917, and other local rebellions arose in {{different}} areas of Sulawesi until the Dutch withdrawal following the Japanese occupation. During the occupation, the Japanese forces used Tiku as a symbol of Torajan struggle against colonial aggression, working to unite the people against Europeans. However, this was poorly received in conquered areas such as Baruppu' and Sesean, where Tiku was remembered as a man who killed others to steal <b>their</b> <b>wives.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although naval aviators were, at that time, {{prohibited}} from marriage {{within two years}} of getting their wings, having left the navy, the marriage could go ahead.

After a two-day honeymoon in a Houston hotel, they flew to San Francisco {{to meet up with}} other AVG recruits and <b>their</b> <b>wives.</b> They parted company on 10 July 1941 at the docks, where Newkirk boarded the M.V.

5000|$|In {{criminal}} cases, {{however, the}} common law long held that wives were not in general competent to give evidence against their husbands (i.e. for the prosecution). This derived from a view of husbands and wives as one person, which extended the defendant's protection against self-incrimination to <b>their</b> <b>wife.</b> A wife could however give evidence for the prosecution where their husband was accused of personal violence against them.|$|R

5|$|Although {{the custom}} had {{no basis in}} law and {{frequently}} resulted in prosecution, particularly from the mid-19th century onwards, {{the attitude of the}} authorities was equivocal. At least one early 19th-century magistrate is on record as stating that he did not believe he had the right to prevent wife sales, and there were cases of local Poor Law Commissioners forcing husbands to sell <b>their</b> <b>wives,</b> rather than having to maintain the family in workhouses.|$|E
5|$|Being well-educated themselves, the Ayyubid rulers became munificent {{patrons of}} {{learning}} and educational activity. Different madrasa-type schools were built by them throughout the empire, not only for education, but also to popularize knowledge of Sunni Islam. According to Ibn Jubayr, under Saladin, Damascus had 20 schools, 100 baths, {{and a large number}} of Sufi dervish monasteries. He also built several schools in Aleppo, Jerusalem, Cairo, Alexandria, and in various cities in the Hejaz. Similarly, many schools were built by his successors also. <b>Their</b> <b>wives</b> and daughters, commanders, and nobles established and financed numerous educational institutions as well.|$|E
5|$|By early 1844, a rift {{developed}} between Smith {{and a half}} dozen of his closest associates. Most notably, William Law, Smith's trusted counselor, and Robert Foster, a general of the Nauvoo Legion, disagreed with Smith about how to manage Nauvoo's economy. Both also said that Smith had proposed marriage to <b>their</b> <b>wives.</b> Believing the dissidents were plotting against his life, Smith excommunicated them on April 18, 1844. These dissidents formed a competing church and the following month, at Carthage, the county seat, they procured indictments against Smith for perjury and polygamy.|$|E

5|$|Emperors of the {{proceeding}} Song dynasty (960–1279) {{tended to}} marry from {{within their own}} borders. Tang emperors, mainly took <b>their</b> <b>wives</b> from high-ranking bureaucratic families, but the Song dynasty did not consider rank important {{when it came to}} selecting their consorts. It has been estimated that only a quarter of Song consorts were from such families, with the rest being from lower status backgrounds. For example, Liu, consort of Emperor Zhenzong, had been a street performer and consort Miao, wife of Emperor Renzong was the daughter of his own wet nurse.|$|E
5|$|Female {{sexuality}} {{is often not}} adequately represented in texts and documents. Until very recently, much {{of what has been}} documented about women's sexuality has been written by men, in the context of male understanding, and relevant to women's associations to men—as <b>their</b> <b>wives,</b> daughters, or mothers, for example. Often artistic representations of female sexuality suggest trends or ideas on broad scales, giving historians clues as to how widespread or accepted erotic relationships between women were.|$|E
5|$|Fielding's ninth play, the {{unsuccessful}} The Letter Writers Or, a New Way to Keep a Wife at Home, ran {{for four}} nights as a companion piece to The Tragedy of Tragedies but was soon after replaced by The Welsh Opera on 22 April 1731. The play followed two characters whose wives are busy having affairs {{and how they}} attempt to keep <b>their</b> <b>wives</b> faithful. The immoral characters are forgiven within the play {{and there is a}} lack of moral commentary within the plot.|$|E
5000|$|Ghayrah (Arabic: غيرة) (sometimes transliterated Gheera, Ghirah, or Ghayra) is an Arabic word {{which means}} [...] "protective jealousy" [...] or [...] "justifiable jealousy."
