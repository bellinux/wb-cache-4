40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a palaeoenvironmental {{study of the}} Gulf of Carpentaria, northern Australia, from around the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) to the present. Foraminifers, microscopic unicellular aquatic organisms, occur throughout the sediment in the time frame studied. Data on the species composition and preservation of the microfossils found in the Gulf of Carpentaria cores are utilised to reconstruct past environments by comparison to the known assemblages of living foraminifers in various modern environments. The Gulf of Carpentaria is a shallow epicontinental sea, situated between Australia and Papua New Guinea, and is a maximum of 70 m deep. It is separated from the Pacific Ocean to the east by Torres Strait, which is 12 m deep at its shallowest, and from the Indian Ocean and Arafura Sea to the west by the Arafura Sill, which is 53 m below sea-level (bpsl) at its shallowest. For at least ten thousand years in the lead up to the LGM (which reached its peak about twenty thousand years ago), and for about ten thousand years after, sea levels were lower than the 53 m-deep Arafura Sill. The continental shelf in the Gulf of Carpentaria area between Australia and Papua New Guinea was exposed, creating a land bridge between the two islands, and a lake developed in the Carpentaria Basin. This palaeolake is termed Lake Carpentaria (named by Torgersen et al., 1983). Documentation of the timing in fluctuations in the extent and salinity of Lake Carpentaria provides information on local and regional climatic systems, such as the Australian summer monsoon. Constraining the nature and timing of the postglacial rise in sea-level which flooded the lake provides evidence for global eustatic sea-level reconstructions. Analysis of sediment cores from the Gulf of Carpentaria, beginning around 40 ka cal BP (forty thousand calendar years before present), shows the existence of Lake Carpentaria (a large, non-marine water body of fluctuating extent) until sealevel rose over the Arafura Sill and inundated the palaeolake around 10. 5 ka cal BP. The earliest studied phase dates to around 40 ka cal BP which is a marineinfluenced brackish water lacustrine facies where Lake Carpentaria is briefly at its maximum extent: 12 m deep in its deepest section. The existence of such {{a large body of}} water (around 150, 000 km 2) supports the existence of a strong Walker Circulation in the region enhancing precipitation. Between 40 ka and 18. 8 ka cal BP the non-marine, increasingly saline, Lake Carpentaria decreased to 7 m maximum water depth, adding to the evidence of aridity around the LGM in northern Australia. At 18. 8 ka cal BP the lake freshened and monospecific bivalve, foraminiferal and ostracod populations dominated the still shallow (around 8 m deep) lake. The lake was expanding, and from around 15 ± 2 ka cal BP, fluctuations are noted in the general trend of increasing precipitation. The recorded variations in precipitation intensity may result from stronger seasonality (i. e. monsoons) and/or interdecadal variability (e. g. El Niño Southern Oscillation). At 12. 7 ka cal BP Lake Carpentaria was at around 12 m maximum water depth – the maximum documented extent in the studied period. At this stage there was some exchange of waters with the Arafura Sea via <b>tidal</b> <b>outlet</b> channels in the Arafura Sill (indicating sea-level around 60 m below present), seen as a marine influence beginning in the western margins at 12. 7 ka cal BP. At 12. 4 ka cal BP the sealevel had risen to the same height as water levels within the lake (58 m bpsl). By 12. 2. ka cal BP sea-level was up to 2 m higher than the previous lake level, and flowed into the lagoonal Lake Carpentaria via channels in the Arafura Sill. By 10. 5 ka cal BP the sea-level had overtopped the highest surface of the 53 m-deep Arafura Sill and the transition to marine conditions began in the Gulf of Carpentaria, confirming the accepted models of sea-level rise...|$|E
40|$|Coastal lagoon {{systems are}} complex and dynamic environments that respond rapidly to the changes of fluvial, marine, climatic and {{anthropogenic}} influences. The purpose {{of this research was}} to investigate the morphology and dynamics of the New River Lagoon before and after the implementation of engineering outlet management using a methodological framework to analyse active process environments. This information was then used to determine the functional effectiveness of engineering management at reducing the risk of flooding and erosion to the local community and imposing minimal impacts on the environmental integrity of the lagoon system. This investigation used a multidisciplinary approach to investigate the morphology and dynamics of the New River Lagoon in relation to active process environments. Outlet dynamics, lagoon channel structure and adjacent shoreline stability were assessed over a decadal timescale prior to engineering management by analysing temporal aerial photographs. Following engineering management, the hydrology of the lagoon was investigated, along with the relationship between morphological changes to the artificial lagoon outlet and changes in lagoon hydrology, local wave climate and local precipitation levels. Water depth, conductivity and temperature records were used to explain lagoon hydrology and Global Navigation Satellite Surveying (GNSS) and weekly oblique photographs were used to explain and document changes in outlet morphology. Wave and rainfall data were used to explain the balances between marine and fluvial environments and their affects on outlet dynamics. Significant changes in lagoon morphology and dynamics were observed at the New River Lagoon between pre- and post-management periods, with the former considered more stable in terms of outlet migration patterns and hydrodynamics. The lagoon outlet prior to engineering management showed morphological characteristics similar to hapua-type systems, migrating along the coastline and forming shore-parallel outlet channels in response to the dominance of a strong longshore drift of sediment. Current outlet dynamics are restricted by artificial outlet management and typically cycle intermittently between open/closed phases in response to variable levels of rainfall and marine sediment supply; characteristics similar to Intermittently Open/Closed Lagoons (ICOLs) found in areas of Australia and South Africa. Hydrologically, the lagoon is considered to be located on a continuum between hapua and estuaries during pre- and post-management periods due to intermittent tidal influences. However, artificial outlet management has significantly increased the frequency and duration of tidal exchange, which now classifies the New River lagoon closer to an estuarine environment. The artificial lagoon outlet and associated breakwater were effective at flushing high flows of water during the study period. However, the outlet was prone to blockage and migration; two morphological states capable of causing flooding. Currently, the greatest risks to flooding at the lagoon are flash floods, following dry periods where marine sediment has established a solid barrier across the outlet, during which water levels are already elevated. Increases in tidal influences, lower lagoon water levels and an increase in lagoon salinity are a direct result of engineering management intervention. An increase in freshwater flushing through the lagoon outlet and deepened of the outlet channel to below sea level, allows for pronounced <b>tidal</b> influences during <b>outlet</b> opening. Restriction of the lagoon outlet from forming a natural migration outlet channel in the direction of littoral drift has meant the outlet is most often oriented perpendicular to the sea, as appose to at an angle away from the direction of incoming waves and currents, further increasing tidal influences. In order to make sustainable management decisions, future management of the lagoon system must weight-up the effects of a high energy coastline to the integrity of the engineering structure, the impact of the structure on the lagoons environmental integrity and the outlets ability to become unstable and cause a flood risk. The findings of this research have improved the understanding of the New River Lagoon system, and its response to engineering management intervention, while adding to the understanding of river-mouth lagoon systems both nationally and internationally...|$|R
