2500|$|Opposition to the TRT {{government}} rose in Bangkok after Thaksin's family {{announced their}} <b>tax-free</b> <b>sale</b> of their 49.6% stake in Shin Corp to Temasek for almost 73.3 billion Baht on January 23, 2006. The People's Alliance for Democracy {{began a series}} of anti-government protests. Several Democrat Party leaders also joined the PAD, which accused Thaksin of disloyalty to the throne and asked King Bhumibol to appoint a replacement Prime Minister. Thaksin Shinawatra dissolved the House of Representatives on February 24, 2006 and called for an election. On March 24, 2006, Abhisit Vejjajiva publicly backed the People's Alliance for Democracy's call for a royally-appointed government. Bhumibol, in a speech on 26 April 2006, responded, [...] "Asking for a Royally-appointed prime minister is undemocratic. It is, pardon me, a mess. It is irrational".|$|E

Sondhi's movement was based on accusations of Thaksin's abuse of power, corruption, human right violation, and immorality. Accusations included the improper handling of privatization of PTT and EGAT, the unfairness of the U.S.-Thailand free trade agreement, the corruption in the Suvarnabhumi Airport project, and conflicts of interest due to the Shinawatra family's continued ownership of Shin Corporation.. In January 2006, the Shinawatra family sold its shares in Shin Corporation, but due to a condition in Thai law, {{they did not have to}} pay capital gains tax. Although legal, Sonthi, his Peoples Alliance for Democracy, and the opposition claimed that the <b>tax-free</b> <b>sale</b> was immoral. Sonthi and the PAD held mass protests for months. In February 2006 Thaksin responded by calling a snap election in April. The opposition boycotted the elections, causing the Constitutional Court to later nullify the election results.

40|$|Tax {{certificates}} are {{an example}} of successful incentive regulation. Prior to its repeal in 1995, section 1071 of the Internal Revenue Code permitted the <b>tax-free</b> <b>sale</b> or exchange of media properties to effectuate policies of the Federal Communications Commission. Enacted by Congress in 1943, this provision was originally used to soften the hardship created by involuntary sales of broadcast properties made necessary to reduce ownership concentration in the radio industry.

In 1998 the traffic from Kokkola was again discontinued (this time for good), but Fennia continued to traffic on the Vaasa-Umeå, Jakobstad-Umeå and Jakobstad-Skellefteå routes. A special Jakobstand-Luleå cruise was also made during the summer. In May and June 1999 Fennia trafficked from Jakobstad for the last time, the end of <b>tax-free</b> <b>sales</b> in intra-EU traffic in July 1999 meant that the traffic from Jakobstad was no longer profitable.

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} {{packaging}} of real estate’s; an approach concerning tax benefits {{with the purpose}} to sell real estates in a more beneficial process than what is doable in direct sales. The proceeding can be beneficial because of the rules in Inkomstskattelagen (19999 : 1229) regarding underpriced transfers and selling of business related shares.   The real estate owner initiates the procedure through an establishment of an affiliate to a previously wholly owned parent company, where the real estate is the solitary asset of the affiliate. In order to fulfill the rules of underpriced transfers the transfer from the parent company shall be valued {{in regards to the}} tax value, else it will be taxed. Once packaged the affiliate containing the property can be sold tax free, made possible by the rules regarding business related shares.   The vendor can therefore achieve a <b>tax-free</b> <b>sale</b> while the buyer does not have to pay stamp duty, since the affiliate remains the owner of the property. Consequently, both parties can in the selling attain benefits by having a transaction with a packaged real estate. Still there exist numerous regulations and ones whom do not possess sufficient knowledge of the risks could encounter issues, causing a default in the intended benefits. The thesis has found that acquisitions of a packaged property set higher requirements on the seller’s and the buyer’s knowledge than direct sales would. In greater extent the benefits accrue the selling part. The buyer’s most important mean to control before the acquisition of a packaged real estate is that the purchase price is equal to the performance. This because packaged real estate’s often contains deferred tax liabilities because the depreciation is not reintroduced at the realization...|$|E

40|$|Ãƒâ€¦land, a small {{autonomous}} island {{province of}} Finland with 28, 000 inhabitants, is base for commercial shipping employing - {{in and outside}} Ãƒâ€¦land - about 6 100 people, onboard and ashore, with an annual gross salary volume of 243 million euros and capital income of 275 million euros (2009). In the same year, gross sales of the shipping sector amounted to more than 870 million euros. These are impressive figures {{in relation to the}} total labour market and economy of Ãƒâ€¦land. Ãƒâ€¦land {{is one of the few}} places within EU, where <b>tax-free</b> <b>sales</b> onboard are still allowed. The right to tax-free was enabled by Ãƒâ€¦land's permanent exemption from the EU tax rules written in the Finland's EU-accession treaty. Another important factor for shipping is the EU-sanctioned system of subsidies for crewing costs that decreases the manning cost of domestic seafarers. Apart from measuring the size and effects of the Ãƒâ€¦land shipping cluster, we analyse the outcome of different scenarios for the shipping industries and the society of Ãƒâ€¦land using a dynamic one-region computable general equilibrium model. We the following scenarios are studied: i) Increasing number of passengers in the Baltic Sea. ii) Growth in the demand for shipping of goods. ii) The EU-sanctioned system of subsidies for crewing costs is abolished iv) Increased bunker costs (IMO-decision on low sulphur fuel) v) The Ãƒâ€¦land tax exemption within EU and, therefore, <b>tax-free</b> <b>sales</b> onboard are abolished It is shown that the manning subsidies mainly benefit the seafarers, but seen from the point of the macro economy, shipping companies or all households, abolition of manning subsidies could have positive impacts as well, depending on the manner of adjustment of shipping to new conditions. We show that from the point of view of the Ãƒâ€¦land economy and society, the first two scenarios are positive for almost everybody. The negative consequences of iv) are widespread, but the abolition of the Ãƒâ€¦land tax exemption would have disastrous consequences for the passenger ferry industry and for the economy as whole. ...|$|R
50|$|Viking Line {{decided to}} {{withdraw}} Cinderella from the Helsinki-Tallinn route {{after the end}} of the 2003 summer seasons, due to increased competition from Tallink's newer MS Romantika and the fact <b>tax-free</b> <b>sales</b> on the route would end in 2004 when Estonia joined the EU. Cinderella was extensively rebuilt in Naantali, and emerged as the all-white Swedish-flagged Viking Cinderella for the Stockholm-Mariehamn 22-hour cruise market.

In 2003 the Viking Cinderella was declared the most environmentally friendly ship of her size in the world by the Swedish maritime authorities. From 2004 onwards Viking Cinderella made cruises to Riga (via Mariehamn in order to sell tax-free goods) during the summer season in addition to the 22-hour cruises.

The study used an annual data series of a number of key variables including border trade and <b>sales</b> in <b>tax-free</b> shops to pursue an Ordinary Least Square (OLS) method. The results reveals that a 10 % increase in domestic prices leads to a reduction in sales of about 9. 6 %.

40|$|At {{the end of}} June 1999 the intra-EU {{duty free}} {{shopping}} was abolished among the fifteen member nations. The opponents of this resolution argued that such a <b>tax-free</b> <b>sales</b> sector created jobs EU-wide and hardly reduced the value added and excise tax revenue of individual countries. In their opinion, duty free trade not only contributed to the reduction of travel fare within the EU but could also be characterised {{as a supplement to}} the normal retail trade for some products. Such ‘old’ ideas are increasingly popular in some Eastern European EU candidates where they are preparing for the introduction of the Single Market and EU membership in the near future. This study primarily shows that the arguments mentioned above were neither significant enough nor conclusive to maintain the intra-EU duty free shopping. Furthermore, the abolition of such tax free sales was approved in the EU in order to ensure the allocation efficiency of the VAT and excise tax system within a single market. Several arguments against the intra-EU tax free shop-ping examined in the study provide some helpful policy orientations for EU membership candidates. ...|$|R

40|$|On September 27, 2010, President Barack Obama {{signed the}} Creating Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 (“SBJA”) that {{contains}} a temporary amendment to Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”) § 1202. The amendment permits original shareholders of eligible corporation stock to sell the stock without being taxed on the sale. The temporary amendment initially only applied to certain stock acquired after {{the enactment of the}} SBJA and before January 1, 2011, but the amendment was extended on December 17, 2010 for another year ending January 1, 2012. With the impending sunset of the 15 % capital gains rate at the end of 2012, this 100 % exclusion from both capital gains taxes and the alternative minimum tax (“AMT”), would be a very big financial windfall to business owners with qualified small business stock (“QSBS”). A qualified small business (“QSB”) is a C corporation with assets of $ 50 million or less where at least 80 % of its assets are used in the active conduct of a trade or business other than certain professional, entertainment, and hospitality services. In general, each QSB C corporation may exclude gain in the amount of the greater of $ 10 million or 10 times the adjusted basis in the corporation. Victor Fleischer stated that the main purpose for enhancing the IRC § 1202 exclusion is to encourage investment in certain new C corporation ventures and small businesses. Manufacturing, construction, and retail wholesaling industries appear to be some of the main areas promoted by the expanded exclusion, since the definition of “qualified trade or business” excludes many other major areas of industry. This Article provides an overview of the IRC Section § 1202 <b>tax-free</b> business <b>sale</b> provision, the history behind the development of the IRC amendments, the apparent intent for enactment, the likelihood the Act will achieve its purposes, the statute’s ambiguities, and some policy implications of creating a <b>tax-free</b> business <b>sale</b> provision...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{studies the}} issues and problems of the Åland Islands related to European integration and globalisation. These are migration (essay 1), competition in the domestic (local) market of Åland (essays 2 and 3), and the economy-wide consequences of changes in shipping and alcohol policy in the Nordic countries and in the European Union (essay 4). The analyses are conducted with an econometric examination of micro level data (essays 1 and 2) and with a dynamic applied general equilibrium model (essays 3 and 4) that was constructed {{during the course of}} this study. Essay 1 examines the characteristics of migration flows to and from the Åland Islands. Estimated migration equations are well in line with the current theories and earlier empirical results. In addition, it is shown that the local unemployment rate affects mainly the migration tendency of non-natives. However, the probability of living in Åland has a decreasing time trend for native Ålanders, while the opposite is true for the persons born in mainland Finland. Essay 2 tries to explain the high price level of groceries in Åland by comparing individual price observations in Åland to those in the southwestern part of mainland Finland. Lack of scale economies, as well as high concentration levels in retailing and in the food processing industry, are some of the suggested explanations. In addition, transport costs and VAT border administration are Åland-specific, yet minor factors in raising prices. There are not many policy options available for rectifying the situation, but added competition in the local market through relaxed entry barriers could be one measure. Essay 3 introduces a dynamic imperfect competition CGE model. One of the major contributions of the model is the introduction of migration that makes economic growth endogenous in the model. An increase in the threat of entry from outside the home region is simulated with the model. This would increase the concentration of local industries, but also would increase consumer welfare. Essay 4 studies the economy-wide consequences of changes in shipping and alcohol policy of the EU and the Nordic countries. The Finnish Government’s decision to increase subsidies to shipping from 2005 onward seems to compensate quite well for the decreased profitability of <b>tax-free</b> <b>sales</b> onboard. New subsidies increase two-fold the budgetary net transfers from Finland to Åland...|$|R

50|$|Delano {{remained}} {{active in}} politics and supported Grant for president in 1868. When Grant became president in March 1869, he appointed Delano Commissioner of Internal Revenue; Delano served from March 11, 1869 to October 31, 1870. As commissioner, Delano tried with mixed success to collect federal revenue on alcohol and tobacco products manufactured in Indian Territory; these items could be produced for <b>sale</b> <b>tax-free</b> within the territory, but manufacturers routinely sold them in adjacent states without paying the taxes. He also proved {{unwilling or unable to}} cope with the frauds of the Whiskey Ring; despite having received warnings of corruption including bribery of federal officials and failure to pay taxes, Delano took little or no action. The department did attempt to prevent the illegal manufacture and sale of whiskey in other areas; on January 31, 1870 an Internal Revenue raid in Georgia captured 18 illicit whiskey stills and their operators. The Whiskey Ring was finally stopped in 1875 during Grant's second term by Secretary of Treasury Benjamin Bristow. The ring leader, John McDonald had received a political appointment as superintending inspector of internal revenue in St. Louis; he had been recommended to Delano by several prominent residents of Missouri, and in turn Delano had recommended him to Grant. McDonald was convicted of fraud and theft, and served 17 months in prison. In all, the investigation of the Whiskey Ring resulted in 110 convictions. Grant's private secretary, Orville E. Babcock was implicated, but acquitted at trial after Grant provided written testimony on his behalf. Additionally, Delano was cleared of involvement in another scandal in which Babcock was implicated, the Gold Ring, which was triggered when two New York financiers attempted to corner the gold market on September 24, 1869. Daniel Butterfield, the Assistant Treasurer of the United States, and Grant's brother in law Abel Corbin were also implicated; Butterfield was forced to resign in October. Delano's reputation for personal honesty was not in question, which was an asset when Grant needed to nominate a new Secretary of the Interior in 1870.|$|R
