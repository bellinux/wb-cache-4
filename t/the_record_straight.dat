25|$|South Australian Family First Member of the Legislative Council Dennis Hood, the party's state {{parliamentary}} leader, is {{a member}} of the Rostrevor Baptist Church. When Sunday Mail columnist Peter Goers stated that Hood was an anti-evolution Creationist, Hood did not deny this in his response, while he did attempt to set <b>the</b> <b>record</b> <b>straight</b> on issues of policy.|$|E
25|$|He {{knew that}} another {{way he could}} share his wealth was by having biographies written that would both set <b>the</b> <b>record</b> <b>straight</b> on him and teach young players how to play. John McCallum {{spent some time with}} Cobb to write a {{combination}} how-to and biography titled The Tiger Wore Spikes: An Informal Biography of Ty Cobb that was published in 1956. In December 1959, he was diagnosed with prostate cancer, diabetes, high blood pressure, and Bright's disease.|$|E
40|$|IT IS DIFFICULT to {{describe}} events and struggles with which {{one has been}} intimately associated. The memory can be very selective even with ‘neutral’ incidents. Nevertheless it seems worth trying to outline how my own thinking developed in the CPA in the 2 ̆ 760 ’s, even if only to provide a point of reference (or a chopping block) for others who {{may be able to}} set <b>the</b> <b>record</b> <b>straighter...</b>|$|R

25|$|Though Symmes himself {{never wrote}} a book about his ideas, several authors {{published}} works discussing his ideas. McBride wrote Symmes' Theory of Concentric Spheres in 1826. It appears that Reynolds has an article that appeared as a separate booklet in 1827: Remarks of Symmes' Theory Which Appeared in the American Quarterly Review. In 1868, a professor W.F. Lyons published The Hollow Globe which put forth a Symmes-like Hollow Earth hypothesis, but failed to mention Symmes himself. Symmes's son Americus then published The Symmes' Theory of Concentric Spheres in 1878 to set <b>the</b> <b>record</b> <b>straight.</b>|$|E
25|$|As he aged, Jackson {{began to}} suffer from heart trouble. In 1951, {{at the age of}} 64, Jackson died of a heart attack. He {{was the first of the}} eight banned players to die, and is buried at Woodlawn Memorial Park in Greenville. Prior to his death, he was {{scheduled}} to be interviewed on television to set <b>the</b> <b>record</b> <b>straight</b> about reports that he was living in poverty, but died before the interview could take place. He had no children, but he and his wife raised two of his nephews.|$|E
25|$|Several {{months later}} when Scheherezade {{gives birth to}} a litter of white puppies with black patches, it is obvious they were sired by Buttons and not, as {{everyone}} thought, by the Emperor's poodle. Fearing the Emperor's reaction, Baron Holenia tells the Emperor they were stillborn, and secretly orders them drowned. However, Virgil, who has sneaked into the palace to see Johanna one last time and set <b>the</b> <b>record</b> <b>straight</b> before he leaves for America, rescues the puppies and confronts the Emperor, who he thinks has ordered the drowning. The Emperor demands an explanation from Holenia, chastises him severely, and asks Virgil {{to give him the}} puppies.|$|E

2500|$|... "Perhaps a bit {{irritated by}} {{the flood of}} experts on the scene, the most noted {{historian}} football has ever known, Parke H. Davis, decided to set all <b>the</b> <b>records</b> <b>straight</b> in <b>the</b> 1933 edition of Spalding's Football Guide," [...] reported Dan Jenkins in the September 11, 1967 edition of Sports Illustrated. [...] "Davis {{went all the way}} back to the first inflated pig bladder to pick the national champions for every season. He used no special formula. He simply looked at the schedules and the results and chose his teams." [...] Davis' list was titled, [...] "Outstanding Nationwide and Sectional Teams," [...] compiled for the seasons from 1869 onward. Davis died months after his selection of the outstanding 1933 teams for the 1934 Guide.|$|R

25|$|Films which {{followed}} included Pandæmonium (2001), a critically acclaimed {{film about the}} friendship between Romantic poets Samuel Taylor Coleridge and William Wordsworth, and The Filth and the Fury (2000), another documentary about The Sex Pistols. This time the film was made with the full cooperation of the surviving members of the band and {{told the story of}} the band from their viewpoint. This film also mixed newly shot footage and interviews as well as footage culled from The Great Rock and Roll Swindle, as well as previously unseen interviews. The film was a critical success and was seen as setting <b>the</b> <b>record</b> <b>straight</b> in regard to the history of The Sex Pistols.|$|E
25|$|In May 1915 a {{full-blown}} controversy was erupting, with the angels {{being used as}} proof of the action of divine providence {{on the side of}} the Allies in sermons across Britain, and then spreading into newspaper reports published widely across the world. Machen, bemused by all this, attempted to end the rumours by republishing the story in August in book form, with a long preface stating the rumours were false and originated in his story. It became a bestseller, and resulted in a vast series of other publications claiming to provide evidence of the Angels' existence. Machen tried to set <b>the</b> <b>record</b> <b>straight,</b> but any attempt to lessen the impact of such an inspiring story was seen as bordering on treason by some. These new publications included popular songs and artists' renderings of the angels. There were more reports of angels and apparitions from the front including Joan of Arc.|$|E
25|$|While the Japanese fight media rejoiced and {{elevated}} Sakuraba to superstar status, the Gracie family took great umbrage over the incident, {{feeling that they}} had been cheated by Pride. Despite Sakuraba challenging Royler's older brother Rickson Gracie after the match, it was his younger brother and former UFC Champion Royce Gracie who, compelled to set <b>the</b> <b>record</b> <b>straight</b> and re-assert the dominance of his family, returned to the sport of mixed martial arts in 2000 and entered the 16-Man Pride Grand Prix alongside Sakuraba and several other top fighters of the era. Placed {{on the same side of}} the bracket, a special set of rules were requested by the Gracies in the event of a Sakuraba-Royce match, including no referee stoppages and no time-limits, the fight ending only in the event of a submission or knock-out (something prohibited in modern MMA because of the widely adopted Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts limiting matches to 25 minutes overall, 5 x 5 minute rounds). In his first fight of the 2000 Pride tournament Sakuraba once again found himself matched up against a heavier opponent, this time the well-regarded 205 pound fighter, former King of Pancrase Guy Mezger. After a closely fought 15 minutes the judges requested an overtime round, and the fight ended in controversy when Mezger's coach Ken Shamrock forced his fighter back to the locker room claiming that no additional rounds were agreed upon in the contract. Sakuraba ended up winning the match by forfeit. Meanwhile, Royce defeated Nobuhiko Takada by unanimous decision and thus set the stage for their much anticipated showdown.|$|E

25|$|The {{other main}} match {{on the card}} was Randy Orton versus Rey Mysterio for Mysterio's world {{championship}} match at WrestleMania 22. Their match stemmed from the Royal Rumble, the pay-per-view three weeks before No Way Out. At the Royal Rumble, Mysterio won the 2006 Royal Rumble match and a world championship match at WrestleMania 22 by last eliminating Randy Orton. On the February 3 episode of SmackDown!, Orton claimed that there's {{no way he could}} beat him in a normal match and that he won the match because of some divine intervention. Orton then challenged Mysterio to a match at No Way Out for his title match at WrestleMania 22, and claimed that Eddie Guerrero was not in heaven, but in hell. Later that night, Orton along with Mark Henry defeated Mysterio and Kurt Angle. Midway through the match, Davari confronted Angle and was chased outside the ring and into the crowd. Henry followed, leaving Mysterio and Orton on their own. Orton gained the pinfall after sitting on Mysterio. After the match, Orton claimed that Mysterio had as much chance of defeating him as Guerrero did of coming back to life. Mysterio responded by accepting Orton's challenge on behalf of Guerrero. The next week on SmackDown!, Orton set <b>the</b> <b>record</b> <b>straight</b> about the comments he made about Eddie Guerrero. Backstage, he said that he only made the comments to get inside Mysterio's head, and {{that he did not know}} or care if Guerrero was in Hell. Orton later entered the arena in a lowrider to further explain his actions, and read an excerpt from Guerrero's book, Cheating Death, Stealing Life – The Eddie Guerrero Story, but Mysterio attacked him, dropkicking his head into the steel ringpost. On the February 17 episode of SmackDown!, Mysterio faced off against Sylvan, which Mysterio won after a West Coast Pop. After the match, Orton came out and said that Mysterio would never main event WrestleMania, he would never become World Champion and that he could never beat him.|$|E

500|$|The {{reception}} to {{the novel}} {{was so bad that}} Fleming wrote to Michael Howard at Jonathan Cape, to explain why he wrote the book: [...] "I had become increasingly surprised to find my thrillers, which were designed for an adult audience, being read in schools, and that young people were making a hero out of James Bond... So it crossed my mind to write a cautionary tale about Bond, to put <b>the</b> <b>record</b> <b>straight</b> in the minds particularly of younger readers... the experiment has obviously gone very much awry".|$|E
