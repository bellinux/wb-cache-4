5|$|After implantation, around <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>to</b> {{third week}} the {{developing}} embryo {{consists of three}} layers: endoderm, mesoderm and ectoderm. The {{first part of the}} ear to develop is the inner ear, which begins to form from the ectoderm around the 22nd day of the embryo’s development. Specifically, the inner ear derives from two thickenings called otic placodes {{on either side of the}} head. Each otic placode recedes below the ectoderm, forms an otic pit and then an otic vesicle. This entire mass will eventually become surrounded by mesenchyme to form the bony labyrinth.|$|E

5|$|An {{alternative}} systematic scheme exists using gill morphology. This {{distinguishes between}} Protobranchia, Filibranchia and Eulamellibranchia.

In addition, Franc separated the Septibranchia from his eulamellibranchs because of the morphological differences between them. The septibranchs belong to the superfamily Poromyoidea and are carnivorous, having a muscular septum instead of filamentous gills.|$|E

5|$|Henry was by now fully {{determined}} {{to take the}} throne, but presenting a rationale for this action proved a dilemma. It was argued that Richard, through his tyranny and misgovernment, had rendered himself unworthy of being king. However, Henry was not next in line to the throne; the heir presumptive was Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March, who was descended from Edward III's third son, <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>to</b> survive to adulthood, Lionel of Antwerp. Bolingbroke's father, John of Gaunt, was Edward's fourth son, the third to survive to adulthood. The problem was solved by emphasising Henry's descent in a direct male line, whereas March's descent was through his grandmother.|$|E

5|$|In 1915, Walter Sydney Adams, using a 60-inch (1.5m) {{reflector}} at Mount Wilson Observatory, {{observed the}} spectrum of Sirius B and determined {{that it was a}} faint whitish star. This led astronomers to conclude that it was a white dwarf, <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>to</b> be discovered. The diameter of Sirius A was first measured by Robert Hanbury Brown and Richard Q. Twiss in 1959 at Jodrell Bank using their stellar intensity interferometer. In 2005, using the Hubble Space Telescope, astronomers determined that Sirius B has nearly the diameter of the Earth, , with a mass 102% of the Sun's.|$|E
