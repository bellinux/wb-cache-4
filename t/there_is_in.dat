5|$|In {{contrast}} to the intuition stemming from vectors in the plane and higher-dimensional cases, <b>there</b> <b>is,</b> <b>in</b> general vector spaces, no notion of nearness, angles or distances. To deal with such matters, particular types of vector spaces are introduced; see below.|$|E
5|$|The more matter <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> the Universe, the {{stronger}} the mutual gravitational pull of the matter. If the Universe were too dense then it would re-collapse into a gravitational singularity. However, if the Universe contained too little matter then the expansion would accelerate too rapidly for planets and planetary systems to form. Since the Big Bang, the universe has expanded monotonically. Perhaps unsurprisingly, our universe has just the right mass density of about 5 protons per cubic meter which has allowed it to expand for the last 13.8 billion years, giving time to form the universe as observed today.|$|E

5|$|Within the conch fisheries, one of {{the threats}} to {{sustainability}} {{stems from the fact}} that there is almost as much meat in large juveniles as <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> adults, but only adult conchs can reproduce, and thus sustain a population. In many places where adult conchs have become rare due to overfishing, larger juveniles and subadults are taken before they ever mate. On a number of islands, subadults provide the majority of the harvest.|$|E
5|$|However, {{there is}} no {{contemporary}} Byzantine account of the Tabuk expedition, {{and many of the}} details come from much later Muslim sources. It has been argued that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> one Byzantine source possibly referencing the Battle of Mu´tah traditionally dated 629, but this is not certain. The first engagements may have started as conflicts with the Arab client states of the Byzantine and Sassanid empires: the Ghassanids and the Lakhmids of Al-Hirah. In any case, Muslim Arabs after 634 certainly pursued a full-blown invasion of both empires, resulting in the conquest of the Levant, Egypt and Persia for Islam. The most successful generals were Khalid ibn al-Walid and 'Amr ibn al-'As.|$|E

5|$|Once granted, {{a coat of}} arms {{becomes the}} {{hereditary}} and inheritable property of the owner and his descendants. However, this can only be so if the inheritor is a legitimate male-line descendent of the person originally granted with the arms. To establish the right to arms by descent, one {{must be able to}} prove that an ancestor had his arms recorded in the registers of the College. If there is a possibility of such an inheritance, one must first make contact with an officer-in-waiting at the College, who could then advise on the course of action and the cost of such a search. The research into a descent of arms requires details of paternal ancestry, which will involve the examination of genealogical records. The first step involve a search of the family name in the College's archives, as coats of arms and family name has no connection, the officer could prove, through this method, that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> fact no descent. However, if a connection is found a genealogical research outside of the College's archives would then be undertaken to provide definitive evidence of descent from an armigerous individual.|$|E
