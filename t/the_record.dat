40|$|Koristeći bogatu arhivsku građu matičnih knjiga grada Pule, autor je u ovome članku analizirao relativno malobrojne slučajeve koji se odnose na spominjanje pripadnika nekih posebnih skupina, poput Cigana, ali i pojedinaca s različitim tjelesnim i psihičkim nedostatcima, kao što su slijepe, kljaste, šepave, nijeme i mentalno zaostale osobe.

In <b>the</b> <b>records</b> of <b>the</b> marriages {{one of them is}} mentioned two times {{at the beginning of the}} eighteenth century. In <b>the</b> <b>records</b> of <b>the</b> baptisms Gipsies are mentioned 10 times: two times in the seventeenth century and eight times in the eighteenth century.

Similarly, in <b>the</b> <b>records</b> of <b>the</b> holy confi rmation only one blind person is <b>recorded.</b> By <b>the</b> same token, only one physically disabled person is <b>recorded</b> in <b>the</b> <b>records</b> of <b>the</b> deceased (in the mid eighteenth century), and only one limping person is mentioned in <b>the</b> <b>records</b> of <b>the</b> holy confi rmation (in the nineteenth century).
