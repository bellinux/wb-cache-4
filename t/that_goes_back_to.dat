5|$|His view (part of a {{tradition}} <b>that</b> <b>goes</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> J. J. Müller, who advanced Marius' claims as early as 1870, and supported by modern scholars such as André Chastagnol) was vigorously contested by Ronald Syme, who theorized that virtually all the identifiable citations from Marius Maximus are essentially frivolous interpolations into the main narrative source, which he postulated was a different Latin author whom he styled 'Ignotus ("the unknown one"), the good biographer'. His theory argued, firstly, that as Marius wrote a sequel to the Lives of the Twelve Caesars, his work covered the reigns from Nerva to Elagabalus; consequently, this would not have included a biography of Lucius Verus, even though the biography of that Princeps in the History is mainly of good quality. Secondly, that 'Ignotus' only went up to Caracalla, as is revealed by the inferior and mostly fictitious biography of Macrinus. Finally, that the composer of the Historia Augusta wrote {{the lives of the}} emperors through to the Life of Caracalla (including Lucius Verus) using Ignotus as his main source, and supplementing with Marius Maximus on occasion. It was only when the source failed that he turned to other less reliable sources (such as Herodian and Maximus), as well as his own fertile imagination, and it was at this juncture that he composed the first five minor lives, through to the Life of Geta.|$|E

Traditionally, the bark was cut and scraped by men, but the making the paper itself was done by women. The process begins by washing the bark, then boiling it with ashes. It is then rinsed and beaten until the fibers knit together, then dried in the sun. Banderolas, or cut-paper banners, are hung in the streets for special occasions.|$|E
25|$|Although {{reflection}} {{from the}} rings increases Saturn's brightness, {{they are not}} visible from Earth with unaided vision. In 1610, the year after Galileo Galilei turned a telescope to the sky, {{he became the first}} person to observe Saturn's rings, though he could not see them well enough to discern their true nature. In 1655, Christiaan Huygens {{was the first person to}} describe them as a disk surrounding Saturn. Although many people think of Saturn's rings as being made up of a series of tiny ringlets (a concept <b>that</b> <b>goes</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Laplace), true gaps are few. It is more correct to think of the rings as an annular disk with concentric local maxima and minima in density and brightness. On the scale of the clumps within the rings there is much empty space.|$|E

25|$|Porto {{started the}} 2014–15 season with their biggest budget ever, hiring Spanish head coach Julen Lopetegui. Despite {{the signing of}} many new players, they failed to win any silverware, {{contributing}} to the biggest hiatus during Pinto da Costa's presidency, <b>that</b> <b>goes</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> 2013. They also equalized, in terms of goals conceded, their biggest defeat in European competitions (6–1 against AEK Athens) and suffered their biggest defeat in the UEFA Champions League (6–1 against Bayern Munich, after the 5–0 loss against Arsenal in 2010). Porto continued their losing trend in the 2015–16 season, making it the third consecutive trophyless season, with the contribution of José Peseiro, who had replaced Julen Lopetegui in January 2016. After the season was over, Peseiro was replaced by Nuno Espírito Santo. 2016–17 season was Porto's fourth trophyless season.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the turn}} of the millennium, the most notable success among newly minted midnight movies has been Donnie Darko (2001). Older films are also popular on the circuit, {{appreciated}} largely in an imposed camp fashion—a midnight movie tradition <b>that</b> <b>goes</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the 1972 revival of the hectoring anti-drug movie Reefer Madness (1938). (Tod Browning's 1932 horror classic Freaks, the original midnight movie revival, is both too dark and too sociologically acute to readily consume as camp.) Where the irony with which Reefer Madness was adopted as a midnight favorite had its roots in a countercultural sensibility, in the latter's place there is now the parodoxical element of nostalgia: the leading revivals on the circuit currently include the crème de la crème of the John Hughes oeuvre—The Breakfast Club (1985), Pretty in Pink (1986), and Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986)—and the preteen adventure film The Goonies (1985).

25|$|The {{immediate}} and specific source for his romances are uncertain. He speaks in the vaguest {{way of the}} materials he used, and though Celtic influence is detectable in the stories, {{there is no direct}} evidence that he had Celtic written sources. Geoffrey of Monmouth or Wace might have supplied some of the names, but neither author mentioned Erec, Lancelot, Gornemant and many others who {{play an important role in}} Chrétien's narratives. One is left to guess about Latin or French literary originals which are now lost, or upon continental lore <b>that</b> <b>goes</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> a Celtic source in the case of Béroul, an Anglo-Norman who wrote around 1150. However, Chrétien found his sources immediately at hand, without much understanding of its primitive spirit, but appreciating it as a setting for the ideal society dreamed of, although not realized, in his own day. And Chrétien's five romances together form the most complete expression from a single author of the ideals of French chivalry. Though so far there has been little critical attention paid to the subject, it is not inaccurate to say that Chrétien was influenced by the changing face of secular and canonical law in the 12th century. This is particularly relevant for his Lancelot, the Knight of the Cart which makes repeated use of the customary law prevalent in Chrétien's day.|$|E

[...] The rivalry was so intense that their coaches had to coach around it, sometimes choosing to keep one off the floor when the other was on.

500|$|The Constitution of the Anglican Church of Australia [...] "commit Anglicans to {{mainstream}} Christian orthodoxy", but its ruling principles direct {{it to that}} particular tradition within as [...] "represented by the Church of England". The Australian church had {{to work out the}} meaning of its common heritage [...] "in the context of the different cultures of the separate colonies" [...] but [...] "the way in which that faith pedigree was appealed to and interpreted... has highlighted differences." [...] Peter Carnley, former primate of the Anglican Church of Australia, has described Anglicanism's [...] "unique or essential identity" [...] as having [...] "not so much a body of theological teaching, as a style of theological reflection" [...] <b>that</b> <b>goes</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the Elizabethan theologian Richard Hooker. St James' conforms to this Anglican tradition, part of which is a general dislike {{of what used to be}} referred to as 'Enthusiasm': that is, a dislike of [...] "pious individualism and emotional exuberance". St James' theological position in the liturgy is evidently consistent with Carnley's explanation that incarnational reality [...] "might be experienced with the aid of aesthetic, symbolic or sacramental aids to worship." [...] Such an adherence to the importance of the sacred and the sublime in worship remains in sharp contradistinction to practice in the surrounding mostly evangelical diocese, which typically eschews beauty and holds to an [...] "ultra-low ecclesiastical aesthetic" [...] that is combined with [...] "ultra-conservative social values". Teaching at St James' takes account of both the Biblical and contemporary historical context. In the Sydney diocese, St James's differing view has therefore been controversial since the 19th century as the various rectors led the church towards and away from Anglo-Catholicism. Micklem, for example, renewed Anglo-Catholic churchmanship and Davidson [...] "returned it firmly to a moderate position".|$|E
