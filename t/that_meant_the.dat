5|$|Atlético de Kolkata {{qualified}} for the play-offs after they drew Goa at the Salt Lake Stadium 1–1 on 10 December 2014. Edgar Marcelino scored first to give Goa the lead before Fikru scored the equalizer for Kolkata. In the semi-finals, Atlético de Kolkata once again took on Goa. The first leg at the Salt Lake Stadium ended in a 0–0 draw. The second leg at the Fatorda Stadium also ended 0–0 and after the tie could not be settled in extra-time <b>that</b> <b>meant</b> <b>the</b> game went into penalty-kicks. Atlético de Kolkata won the shoot-out 4–2 after André Santos and Zohib Islam Amiri missed their penalties for Goa and Kolkata converted all four of theirs.|$|E
5|$|Barcelona {{ended their}} refusal of {{corporate}} sponsorship {{prior to the}} commencement of the 2011–12 season, signing a five-year, €150 million deal with Qatar Sports Investments, <b>that</b> <b>meant</b> <b>the</b> Qatar Foundation was on the club's shirt for the 2011–12 and 2012–13 seasons, then replaced by Qatar Airways for the 2013–14 season, the deal allowing for a commercial sponsor logo to replace the charity logo, two years into the six-year deal. The deal with Qatar Airways was extended for one more year in 2016.|$|E
5|$|When {{the great}} expeditions were over, the old trade routes closed, and the Viking ships no longer made ready each spring for voyages to east and west, then <b>that</b> <b>meant</b> <b>the</b> {{end of the}} carving and setting up of rune stones in the proper sense of the term. They may be called the monuments of the Viking voyages, and the {{sensitive}} reader may catch in many of their inscriptions the Viking's love of adventure and exploits of boisterous daring.|$|E

50|$|The {{relatively}} {{sparsely populated}} areas crossed by {{the line and}} the absence of significant long-distance freight traffic <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Vogelsberg railway was mainly limited to regional traffic. <b>That</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> line was built as a single track line, although various engineering structures were prepared for the building of a second track.|$|R

5|$|At the 1963 World Championships in Stockholm, the Soviet Union won {{the gold}} medal, {{beginning}} a streak of nine consecutive World Championship golds. The 1964 Winter Olympics in Innsbruck, Austria {{marked the first time}} that Canada failed to win an Olympic medal in hockey. The Soviet Union won all seven of their games and the gold medal, but Canada finished the tournament with five wins and two losses, putting them in a three-way tie for second place with Sweden and Czechoslovakia. Prior to 1964, the tie-breaking procedure was based on goal difference from games against teams in the medal round and under that system, Canada would have placed third ahead of the Czechoslovaks. The procedure had been changed to count all games and <b>that</b> <b>meant</b> <b>the</b> Canadians finished fourth. However, the Olympics also counted as the World Championships, and under IIHF rules, Canada should have won a bronze. In April 2005, the IIHF admitted that a mistake had occurred and announced that they had reviewed the decision and would award the 1964 Canadian team a World Championship bronze medal. However, two months later, the IIHF over-turned their decision and rejected an appeal in September.|$|E
5|$|The {{palace of}} Saint-Maur-des-Fossés, south east of Paris, was another of Catherine's {{unfinished}} projects. She bought this building, on which Philibert de l'Orme had worked, from the heirs of Cardinal Jean du Bellay, after the latter's death in 1560. She then commissioned de l'Orme {{to finish the}} work he had begun there. Drawings by Jacques Androuet du Cerceau in the British Museum may shed light on Catherine's intentions for Saint-Maur. They show a plan to enlarge each wing by doubling {{the size of the}} pavilions next to the main block of the house. The house was to stay as one storey, with a flat roof and rusticated pilasters. <b>That</b> <b>meant</b> <b>the</b> extensions would not unbalance the masses of the building as seen from the side.|$|E
25|$|Reading played Charlton Athletic, at home, next. Reading drew 2–2 {{with two}} goals from young Irish striker Shane Long. However the Royals were denied victory by a last gasp equaliser. Reading next lost to Ipswich Town 1–0. The Royals went 1–0 down just 1 minute after the break. <b>That</b> <b>meant</b> <b>the</b> Royals {{went into a}} three match winless run with renewed purpose.|$|E

Licence fees remained until 1973 when they were abolished by the Whitlam Labor government, {{on the basis that}} the near-universality of television and radio services meant that public funding was a fairer method of providing revenue for government-owned radio and television broadcasters.|$|E
25|$|A longer list of his {{favourite}} singles {{was revealed}} in 2005 when {{the contents of}} a wooden box in which he stored the records <b>that</b> <b>meant</b> <b>the</b> most to him were made public. The box {{was the subject of a}} television documentary, John Peel's Record Box. Out of 130 vinyl singles in the box, 11 of them were by The White Stripes, more than any other band in the box.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} began heavy military spending in 1940, and started drafting millions {{of young men}} that year. By 1945, 17 million had entered service to their country, {{but that was not}} enough to absorb all the unemployed. During the war, the government subsidized wages through cost-plus contracts. Government contractors were paid in full for their costs, plus a certain percentage profit margin. <b>That</b> <b>meant</b> <b>the</b> more wages a person was paid the higher the company profits since the government would cover them plus a percentage.|$|E

25|$|Until Ocean Grove's {{municipal}} authority was folded into Neptune Township in 1981, it boasted {{a set of}} unique laws, including one that made it illegal on Sundays to have cars {{on the streets of}} Ocean Grove. This had a significant effect on the development of a close-knit community. People looking to get away for the weekend typically avoided the Grove (the beach was closed on Sunday, too). <b>That</b> <b>meant</b> <b>the</b> visitors were likely to be coming for a week-long visit or more. Most came to attend programs sponsored by the Camp Meeting.|$|E
25|$|ARPA {{was asked}} to {{consider}} the problem of using the technology in a cost-effective way, and noticed one possible application. As Soviet warheads were accurate to within only a few kilometers, {{and they had to}} fall within less than a kilometer to kill a missile silo, <b>that</b> <b>meant</b> <b>the</b> Soviets would have to launch several warheads at every US silo in a counterforce attack. The defender had a significant advantage here; they could watch the incoming warheads, see if any were going to come within the lethal range of a silo, and then shoot just those ones. This meant a small number of ABMs would be effective against a huge number of Soviet warheads.|$|E
25|$|In December 1991 the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (CODESA) {{was held}} {{with the aim}} of {{establishing}} an interim government. However, a few months later in June 1992 the Boipatong massacre occurred and all negotiations crumbled as the ANC pulled out. After this negotiations proceeded between two agents, Cyril Ramaphosa of the ANC, and Roelf Meyer of the National Party. In over 40 sessions the two men discussed and negotiated over many issues including the nature of the future political system, the fate of over 40,000 government employees and if/how the country would be divided. The result of these negotiations was an interim constitution <b>that</b> <b>meant</b> <b>the</b> transition from apartheid to democracy was a constitutional continuation and that {{the rule of law and}} state sovereignty remained intact during the transition, which was vital for stability within the country. A date was set for the first democratic elections on 27 April 1994. The ANC won 62.5% of the votes and has been in power ever since.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to develop the mathematical ability in the children of group B of TK Aisyiyah Kratonan in the academic year of 2014 / 2015 through pictorial number card. Kind of this research was a Classroom Action Research. Subjects of this research were the children of Group B of TK Aisyiyah, Kratonan urban village, Serengan sub district, Surakarta municipality, with the amount of 20 children. The data needed in this research were the mathematical ability and the learning used the method of playing the pictorial number card. The technique of data collection was observation. The instrument used was the guidance of observation. The techniques of data analysis were the technique of comparative analysis and the technique of interactive analysis. Based on the results of the research, it could be concluded that the method of playing the pictorial number card could develop the mathematical ability of the children of group B in TK Aisyiyah Kratonan in the Academic Year of 2014 / 2015. It could be seen from the percentage average of every cicle in which in the pre-cycle was 35 % <b>that</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> children had not been developed, the cycle I was 58. 47 % <b>that</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> children began to develop, and the cycle II was 90. 42 % <b>that</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> children developed very well...|$|R

25|$|Since {{the early}} 1980s, Domingo has {{released}} several Latin albums, including two featuring {{the music of}} Mexican songwriter, Agustín Lara. He devoted two more of his albums, Adoro (1982) and 100 años de Mariachi (1999), solely to Mexican music. 100 años de Mariachi, a rancheras collection, went platinum in the United States and gold in Mexico. He later recalled that, as a fan of mariachi music since boyhood, the Grammy he won for 100 años de Mariachi was the award <b>that</b> <b>meant</b> <b>the</b> most to him of all he has received. Other of his albums have incorporated music from across Latin America (including Brazil) and Spain. He has also recorded some sacred music, a collection of Argentine tangos, an album of Broadway show tunes, selections from Viennese operettas, and several zarzuelas, as well as zarzuela romanzas and duets. Domingo has appeared as a guest artist on albums by Michael Bolton, Yanni, Santana, Il Volo, Sissel, Jennifer Rush and Katherine Jenkins.|$|E
25|$|Problems also arose between Diogo and the Portuguese {{settlers}} at Sao Tome {{known as}} Tomistas. According to a treaty between Kongo and Portugal, the former were only to trade within the latter's realm for slaves. <b>That</b> <b>meant</b> <b>the</b> Portuguese were {{restricted to the}} slaves offered by King Diogo or those he authorized to sell slaves. Every year the Tomistas would come with 12 to 15 ships to carry back between 400 and 700 slaves (5,000–10,000 slaves a year). This {{was not enough to}} take advantage of Kongo's ever-growing supply of slaves thanks to wars on its eastern frontier. The captains would try to overload their cargos, resulting in revolts. However, the factor that actually broke the deal was the Tomista habit of sailing upriver to the Malebo Pool to purchase slaves from BaTeke traders who were increasingly taken with European goods over the nzimbu shells the manikongo offered them. Enraged by this breach of contract, King Diogo broke off relations in 1555 and expelled 70 or so Portuguese living in his realm (many of whom had lived {{there for a long time}} with African wives and mixed-race children).|$|E
500|$|According to President Kennedy's [...] "Country Team" [...] {{directive}} of 29 May 1961, all U.S. {{government agencies}} {{operating in a}} foreign nation were to be placed under the direct supervision of the ambassador. Within Laos <b>that</b> <b>meant</b> <b>the</b> U.S. military was under civilian control, since according to the neutralization agreement, there could never be a senior U.S. military commander within the country. The covert war was, therefore, going to be planned and directed by a civilian {{within the walls of}} the embassy.|$|E

The Gemara noted that in [...] God told Moses to tell the Israelites who were about to leave Egypt, [...] "And I will give it you for a heritage; I am the Lord," [...] and <b>that</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Land was the inheritance from the fathers of those who left Egypt.|$|R

500|$|Scholars {{who study}} Chinese Indonesians often {{distinguish}} {{members of the}} group according to their racial and sociocultural background: the [...] "totok" [...] and the [...] "peranakan". The two terms were initially used to racially distinguish the pure-blooded Chinese from those with mixed ancestry. A secondary meaning to the terms later arose <b>that</b> <b>meant</b> <b>the</b> [...] "totok" [...] were born in China, and anyone born in Indonesia was considered [...] "peranakan". Segmentation within [...] "totok" [...] communities occurs through division in speech groups, a pattern that has become less apparent {{since the turn of the}} 20th century. Among the indigenized [...] "peranakan" [...] segmentation occurs through social class, which is graded according to education and family standing rather than wealth.|$|E
500|$|In remand status, Kenyatta and {{the others}} were {{returned}} to Lokitaung, where they resided in huts while awaiting the results of the appeal process. Pritt pointed out that Thacker had been appointed magistrate for the wrong district, a technicality <b>that</b> <b>meant</b> <b>the</b> whole trial was void; the Supreme Court of Kenya concurred and Kenyatta {{and the others}} were freed in July 1953, although immediately re-arrested. [...] The government then took the case the East African Court of Appeal, which reversed the Supreme Court's decision in August. The appeals process resumed in October 1953, and in January 1954 the Supreme Court upheld the convictions against all but Oneko. Pritt finally took the case to the Privy Council in London, but they refused his petition without providing an explanation. He later noted that this was despite the fact his case was one of the strongest he had ever presented during his career. It is likely that political, rather than legal considerations, informed their decision to reject the case.|$|E
500|$|In 1903, {{with the}} design now confirmed, the MDHB {{requested}} {{that a number of}} builders submit a tender document for the construction of the building to the revised design. Over 30 builders were contacted, with William Brown & Son of Manchester winning the contract to construct the new building. Work began in 1904, with {{the first nine months of}} construction focusing on laying the building's foundations, which were dug to a depth of [...] below ground level. The building's frame was built from reinforced concrete, which was then clad in Portland Stone, a design <b>that</b> <b>meant</b> <b>the</b> building was more fire resistant than with other structural forms. It was completed in 1907 at a cost of approximately £250,000, although when the cost of furniture, fittings and professional fees was taken into account, the total cost was nearer £350,000. Staff from the MDHB headquarters officially moved into the building on 15 July 1907, with staff from departments located in other areas of the city moving in throughout the rest of the year.|$|E
