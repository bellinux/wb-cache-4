40|$|AbstractObjectivesThe National Hospital of Saint Maurice (HNSM) for Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation aims at {{strengthening}} {{its position}} as a pivot rehabilitation and physical therapy center. The opening in 2011 of a new unit for the evaluation and treatment of motor disabilities meets this objective. This project includes several parts: clinical, financial, architectural, organizational, applied clinical research as well as dealing with medical equipments and information system. This study focuses on the risk assessment of this future <b>technical</b> <b>unit.</b> MethodsThis study was conducted {{by a group of}} professionals working for the hospital. It started with the design of a functional model to better comprehend the system to be analyzed. Risk assessment consists in confronting this functional model to a list of dangers {{in order to determine the}} vulnerable areas of the system. Then the team designed some scenarios to identify the causes, securities barriers and consequences in order to rank the risks. ResultsThe analysis targeted various dangers, e. g. political, strategic, financial, economical, marketing, clinical and operational. The team identified more than 70 risky scenarios. For 75 % of them the criticality level was deemed initially tolerable and under control or unacceptable. The implementation of an action plan for reducing the level of risks before opening this <b>technical</b> <b>unit</b> brought the <b>system</b> down to an acceptable level at 66 %. ConclusionA year prior to opening this <b>technical</b> <b>unit</b> for the evaluation and treatment of motor disabilities, conducting this preliminary risk assessment, with its exhaustive and rigorous methodology, enabled the concerned professionals to work together around an action plan for reducing the risks...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} the mathematical structure of <b>unit</b> <b>systems</b> and {{the relations between}} them. Looking over the entire set of <b>unit</b> <b>systems,</b> {{we can find a}} mathematical structure that is called preorder (or quasi-order). For some pair of <b>unit</b> <b>systems,</b> there exists a relation of preorder such that one <b>unit</b> <b>system</b> is transferable to the other <b>unit</b> <b>system.</b> The transfer (or conversion) is possible only when all of the quantities distinguishable in the latter system are always distinguishable in the former system. By utilizing this structure, we can systematically compare the representations in different <b>unit</b> <b>systems.</b> Especially, the equivalence class of <b>unit</b> <b>systems</b> (EUS) plays an important role because the representations of physical quantities and equations are of the same form in <b>unit</b> <b>systems</b> belonging to an EUS. The dimension of quantities is uniquely defined in each EUS. The EUS's form a partially ordered set. Using these mathematical structures, <b>unit</b> <b>systems</b> and EUS's are systematically classified and organized as a hierarchical tree. Comment: 27 pages, 3 figure...|$|R

40|$|Feedback is {{certainly}} among {{essential elements of}} a learning environment and developing an effective feedback process is highly desirable. Evidence from literature (e. g. Walker 2009; Ferguson 2011; Orsmond & Merry 2011; Bailey & Garner 2010) show that detailed feedback to students could enhance their learning. Moreover, early informative feedback is an essential requirement for encouraging students to change their performance in future (Brown et al. 1997). Feedback can take many shapes and forms. It can be simply a final grade or a comprehensive descriptive response for an assessment. Nevertheless, it should be designed and provided {{in a way that}} it could manage students' expectations, learning process need and be consistent and supportive of course material. There are challenges, however, when engineering students carry out a course in management where content and feedback processes are somewhat different from other scientific and <b>technical</b> <b>units</b> they often have. These <b>technical</b> <b>units</b> unlike management units seem to provide more objective, measurable often linear understanding of a knowledge area. Therefore, education process in general and feedback mechanism specifically should help students to deal with this disparity between management and <b>technical</b> <b>units...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how the international NGO WaterAid supports decentralised local governments in Mali to fulfil their role of service authorities within a service delivery approach for rural water services. WaterAid provides capacity support to local governments by creating and financing municipal WASH <b>Technical</b> <b>Units</b> that, in turn, provide direct support to community management of rural water supply. The paper compares this model to another approach for supporting rural water service providers in Mali {{in terms of}} the activities, scale and costs of direct support provided through each model. The paper finds that the model of WASH <b>Technical</b> <b>Units</b> promoted by WaterAid provides a more comprehensive set of support activities than the alternative approach suggested in national policy. The costs of the <b>Technical</b> <b>Units</b> are within international benchmarks for the expenditure on direct support suggested to be necessary for basic sustainable rural water services, but it is not yet clear how local governments in Mali can finance the costs of such an approach in the long term. Therefore, greater debate is needed in the national water sector about which aspects of support to rural water service providers are most important and what combination of actors can provide and finance this support...|$|R
