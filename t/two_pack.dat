2500|$|One {{particular}} trip in 1895 to Yosemite's Hetch Hetchy Valley was for {{the sole}} purpose of meeting the famed conservationist John Muir, who was reported to be roaming the valley. Lukens outfitted himself at Crocker's Station, a stagecoach stop and resort, with food, <b>two</b> <b>pack</b> animals and Elwell the guide. A few miles south of the valley, he came across a [...] man wearing a rumpled suit, vest, white shirt; without food, pack animals or companions.|$|E
2500|$|During 1897 Both Lukens and Muir {{were active}} in {{different}} areas of the evolving conservation movement. [...] "I've been writing about the forests, doing what little I can to save them," [...] Muir wrote to a colleague, Henry Fairfield Osborne. Lukens that year began his campaign for watershed protection of the San Gabriel Reserve. He advocated fire protection, tree planting and removal of stockmen from the reserve. He and others undertook <b>two</b> <b>pack</b> trips into the reserve in 1897 and one expedition in 1998. Lukens wrote little, but was a prolific photographer, documenting trees, rocks and conditions during the pack trips. Lukens was often quoted in newspapers, because he gave talks to community groups about his ideas for preserving the watersheds. In an 1898 article in the Los Angeles Times, Lukens was quoted terming the driving of stock in the mountains as [...] "Hoofed Locusts." [...] His argument (and Muir's) was that sheep destroyed the mountain meadows by grazing away all vegetation and that stockman were guilty of setting wildfires {{at the end of the}} season to create more meadow for the following year.|$|E

I am not given to needless worrying, but the more I tried to convince myself that all was well with Powell, and that the dots I had seen on his trail were antelope or wild horses, the less I was able to assure myself.|$|E
60|$|At {{a little}} village (Ozumba) {{near the base}} of Popocatapetl, where we purposed to {{commence}} the ascent, we procured guides and <b>two</b> <b>pack</b> mules with forage for our horses. High up on the mountain there was a deserted house of one room, called the Vaqueria, which had been occupied years before by men in charge of cattle ranging on the mountain. The pasturage up there was very fine when we saw it, and there were still some cattle, descendants of the former domestic herd, which had now become wild. It was possible to go on horseback {{as far as the}} Vaqueria, though the road was somewhat hazardous in places. Sometimes it was very narrow with a yawning precipice on one side, hundreds of feet down to a roaring mountain torrent below, and almost perpendicular walls on the other side. At one of these places one of our mules loaded with two sacks of barley, one on each side, the two about as big as he was, struck his load against the mountain-side and was precipitated to the bottom. The descent was steep but not perpendicular. The mule rolled over and over until the bottom was reached, and we supposed of course the poor animal was dashed to pieces. What was our surprise, not long after we had gone into bivouac, to see the lost mule, cargo and owner coming up the ascent. The load had protected the animal from serious injury; and his owner had gone after him and found a way back to the path leading up to the hut where we were to stay.|$|E
