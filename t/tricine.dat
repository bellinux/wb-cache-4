We speculated {{that this was}} due to coordination of a neighbouring histidine (His) or glutamate (Glu). To investigate this possibility, several short peptides incorporating lysine (HYNIC), with and without His and Glu at different positions in the sequence, were radiolabelled with 99 mTc, using <b>tricine,</b> ethylenediaminediacetic acid (EDDA) and nicotinic acid as co-ligands. The products were examined by HPLC-ESMS, cysteine challenge and bovine serum albumin (BSA) challenge. Peptides with His nearby on either side of lysine (HYNIC) contained only one <b>tricine</b> and showed markedly enhanced structural homogeneity and stability to cysteine challenge and BSA binding, except those with His located at the N-terminus. Peptides without His, or with neighbouring N-terminal His, contained two tricines and were less stable to cysteine challenge and BSA binding. Glu participated in Tc-binding but did not enhance stability. We conclude that neighbouring His or Glu side chains coordinate to Tc and this could alter peptide or protein conformation. Inclusion of His in a neighbouring position to lysine (HYNIC) enhances stability, improves homogeneity and reduces the demand of the metal center for binding to additional co-ligands.

Electrophoresis controls all assay stages, affording purely electronic operation with no pumps or valves needed for fluid control. Electrophoretic introduction of antibody into and along the molecular sieving gel requires that the probe must traverse through (i) a discontinuous gel interface central to the transient isotachophoresis used to achieve high-performance separations and (ii) the full axial length of the separation gel.

An improved technique {{has been designed to}} extract and isolate phytoglycogen from the grain and leaves of su- 1 maize with minimal degradation for structural characterisation. The structures of extracted phytoglycogen samples were analysed using size-exclusion chromatography (SEC, also termed GPC) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and compared with the structure of pig liver glycogen. The SEC weight molecular size distributions indicate that the extraction procedure with protease is most effective in obtaining pure phytoglycogen from grain, whereas that without protease at cold temperature followed by purification using a sucrose gradient is more effective for leaf material. The extracted and purified phytoglycogen samples from both grain and leaf contain wide distributions of molecular sizes (analysed by SEC and TEM), with the smallest being "individual" β particles, which collectively form larger α particles; the latter are dominant in the phytoglycogen samples examined here. The results show that phytoglycogen is similar to liver glycogen in both the range of molecular size distribution and in the presence of α particles.

40|$|Recently, phosphoglucose {{isomerase}} with a lysyl aminopeptidase (PGI-LysAP) {{activity was}} identified in Vibrio vulnificus. In this paper, we demonstrate the proteolytic cleavage of human-derived peptides by PGI-LysAP of V. vulnificus using three approaches: (i) a quantitative fluorescent ninhydrin assay for free lysine, (ii) matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-two-stage {{time of flight}} mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-TOF), and (iii) <b>Tricine</b> gel electrophoresis. PGI-LysAP hydrolyzed bradykinin, Lys-bradykinin, Lys-(des-Arg 9) -bradykinin, neurokinin A, Met-Lys-bradykinin, histatin 8, and a myosin light chain fragment. We detected the proteolytic release of free l-lysine from peptide digests using a rapid, simple, sensitive, and quantitative fluorescent ninhydrin assay, and results were confirmed by MALDI-TOF-TOF. The use of the fluorescent ninhydrin assay to quantitatively detect free lysine hydrolyzed from peptides is the first application of its kind {{and serves as a}} paradigm for future studies. The visualization of peptide hydrolysis was accomplished by <b>Tricine</b> gel electrophoresis. Proteolytic processing of kinins alters their affinities toward specific cellular receptors and initiates signal transduction mechanisms responsible for inflammation, vasodilation, and enhanced vascular permeability. By applying novel approaches to determine the proteolytic potential of bacterial enzymes, we demonstrate that PGI-LysAP has broad exopeptidase activity which may enhance V. vulnificus invasiveness by altering peptides involved in signal transduction pathways...|$|E
40|$|An Arabidopsis {{mitochondrial}} proteome {{project was}} started {{for a comprehensive}} investigation of mitochondrial functions in plants. Mitochondria were prepared from Arabidopsis stems and leaves or from Arabidopsis suspension cell cultures, and {{the purity of the}} generated fractions was tested by the resolution of organellar protein complexes applying two-dimensional blue-native/N-[2 -hydroxy- 1, 1 -bis(hydroxymethyl) ethyl]glycine (<b>Tricine)</b> sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The Arabidopsis mitochondrial proteome was analyzed by two-dimensional isoelectric focusing/ <b>Tricine</b> sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and 650 different proteins in a pI range of pH 3 to 10 were separated on single gels. Solubilization conditions, pH gradients for isoelectric focusing, and gel staining procedures were varied, and the number of separable proteins increased to about 800. Fifty-two protein spots were identified by immunoblotting, direct protein sequencing, and mass spectrometry. The characterized proteins cooperate in various processes, such as respiration, citric acid cycle, amino acid and nucleotide metabolism, protection against O 2, mitochondrial assembly, molecular transport, and protein biosynthesis. More than 20 % of the identified proteins were not described previously for plant mitochondria, indicating novel mitochondrial functions. The map of the Arabidopsis mitochondrial proteome should be useful for the analysis of knockout mutants concerning nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes. Considerations of the total complexity of the Arabidopsis mitochondrial proteome are discussed. The data from this investigation will be made available at [URL]...|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} the effects of changes in pHo and pHi on currents contributing to the medium and slow afterhyperpolarizations (mIAHP and sIAHP, respectively) in rat CA 1 neurones. Reducing pHo from 7. 4 to 6. 7 inhibited mIAHP and sIAHP whereas increasing pHo to 7. 7 augmented mIAHP and, to a greater extent, sIAHP. The ability of changes in pHo to modulate mIAHP reflected changes in the Ca 2 +-activated K+ current, IAHP, and a Co 2 +- and XE 991 -resistant component of mIAHP, but not the muscarine-sensitive current, IM. In the presence of 1 μm TTX and 5 mm TEA, low pHo-evoked reductions in sIAHP were associated with reductions in Ca 2 +-dependent depolarizing potentials; because neither effect was attenuated when internal H+ buffering power was raised by including 100 mm <b>tricine</b> in the patch pipette, the actions of reductions in pHo to inhibit sIAHP and, possibly, IAHP in large part appear to reflect a low pHo-dependent decrease in Ca 2 + influx. In contrast, the effects of high pHo to augment mIAHP and sIAHP were associated with relatively small increases in Ca 2 + potentials but were significantly attenuated by 100 mm internal <b>tricine,</b> indicating that a rise in pHi consequent upon the rise in pHo was largely responsible. The possibility that changes in pHi could act to modulate mIAHP and sIAHP, independently of changes in Ca 2 + influx, was also suggested by experiments in which pHi was lowered at a constant pHo by the external application of propionate or by the withdrawal of HCO 3 − from the perfusing medium. Lowering pHi at a constant pHo had little effect on Ca 2 + potentials but inhibited mIAHP and, to a greater extent, sIAHP, effects that were attenuated by 100 mm internal <b>tricine.</b> Together, the results indicate that changes in pHo and pHi modulate mIAHP and sIAHP in rat CA 1 neurones and suggest that, depending on the direction of the pHo change, the sensitivities of the underlying currents to changes in Ca 2 + influx and/or pHi may contribute to the effects of changes in pHo to modulate mIAHP and sIAHP...|$|E
