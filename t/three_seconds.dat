At the Victorian Championships, she showed her potential by setting a state record of 17.4 seconds (s) for the 25-yard freestyle in the under-8 division. The following year, she covered 25 yards in 15.7 seconds, <b>three</b> <b>seconds</b> faster than Davies had {{done at the}} same age. She progressed steadily, sweeping the state age titles from nine to 13, setting records that were often faster than those by boys of the same age.|$|E
5|$|After {{the rest}} day came the race's {{individual}} time trial. It was won by Dumoulin, {{who was more}} than a minute ahead of all the other riders in the race. His time was good enough to put him into the overall race lead. Aru rode strongly, and was only <b>three</b> <b>seconds</b> behind Dumoulin in the general classification after the stage. Rodríguez lost over three minutes to Dumoulin. Majka also lost significant time to Aru and Dumoulin and fell to fourth place.|$|E

5|$|Netball Australia {{also runs}} a {{modified}} game called Netta aimed at 8- to 11-year-olds. The goal height and ball size {{are the same}} as for adults, but players rotate positions during the game, permitting each player to play each position. Netta was created to develop passing and catching skills. Its rules permit six seconds between catching and passing the ball, instead of the <b>three</b> <b>seconds</b> permitted in the adult game. Most players under 11 play this version at netball clubs.|$|E
5|$|The Packers {{lost to the}} San Francisco 49ers in a Wild Card Round {{playoff game}} in 1998.

5|$|The lane is a {{restricted}} {{area in which}} players can stay for only {{a limited amount of}} time.

5|$|The song {{at the end}} of the show, {{written by}} Ken Keeler, is a parody of various Bond themes. Keeler {{originally}} wrote it to be <b>three</b> <b>seconds</b> longer and sound more like the Goldfinger theme, but the final version was shorter and the lyrics were sped up. The writers wanted the song to be sung by Shirley Bassey, who sang several Bond themes, but they could not get her to record the part.|$|E

5|$|The team of Eric Young and Kaz were {{pitted against}} {{the team of}} Black Reign and Rellik in the third match. The {{duration}} of the encounter was ten minutes and <b>three</b> <b>seconds.</b> During the contest, Young left the ring, leaving Kaz to fight off both Reign and Rellik by himself. Later, Young returned to the ring dressed as a superhero, where he performed a double Death Valley Driver on Reign and Rellik slamming them both into the mat, thus winning the match.|$|E
5|$|As {{they had}} been {{compromised}} by the first lap pileup and were {{at the back of}} the field, Dillmann and Coletti chose to make their mandatory pit stops when the window opened at the end of the seventh lap for rear soft compound tyres. Haryanto and Abt made their stops on the next lap and Calado and Lancaster did the same on lap nine. Coletti's early pit stop resulted in him lapping faster than any other driver by two seconds. Other drivers became aware of the significance and Nasr went into the pit lane to keep his position from Calado and Ceccon and Richelmi did the same on the eleventh lap. This placed pressure on race leader Evans who was at this point <b>three</b> <b>seconds</b> a lap slower than Ceccon. Evans made his own pit stop on lap 12 for four soft compound tyres but did not retain first place as Ceccon made up enough time to move in front of him. Evans could not keep close to Ceccon and was <b>three</b> <b>seconds</b> behind the driver after one lap and his diminishing pace hurt the delayed Bird who became the leader when Evans made his pit stop. On lap 15, De Jong made a problematic pit stop: his rear jack failed which delayed him and then crossed the yellow line at the pit lane exit twice, earning him a drive-through penalty.|$|E
5|$|Brooks then {{won gold}} {{as part of}} the winning 4100m {{freestyle}} relay, anchoring the team of Fasala, Delany and Graeme Brewer to a victory by almost <b>three</b> <b>seconds,</b> putting in a split of 50.56s. The shaven-headed quartet was dubbed the Mean Machine. He collected another gold in the medley relay, combining with David Orbell, Evans and Jon Sieben, this time completing his freestyle anchor leg in 50.44s. Canada had finished the race far ahead of the Australians, but were disqualified for an early changeover. After the games, Brooks completed the American college season before returning to Australia. He was named as Western Australia's Sportsman of the Year.|$|E
