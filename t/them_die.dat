During the summer, Linnaeus met a friend from Uppsala, Peter Artedi. Before their departure from Uppsala, Artedi and Linnaeus had decided should one of <b>them</b> <b>die,</b> the survivor would finish the other's work. Ten weeks later, Artedi drowned in one of the canals of Amsterdam, and his unfinished manuscript on the classification of fish was left to Linnaeus to complete.|$|E
5|$|The game {{featured}} advanced {{artificial intelligence}} {{due to the}} inclusion of the game's squad command system. Adams and Lugo will assist Walker in battles and react to the battle situation accordingly even if they are not given any orders. They will also analyse the situation when instructed and decide the best approach to defeat enemies. The battle command system was designed to be accessible and easy to use, so that players would not have {{to spend a lot of}} time managing the squad. Lugo and Adams may get severely injured and if both of <b>them</b> <b>die,</b> the game ends. This mechanic prompts the player to rescue them as quickly as possible, and the system is designed to create tense situations. The AI for enemies is affected by various factors, including visibility and hearing.|$|E

25|$|It is {{recommended}} to buy captive bred box turtles (in areas {{where this is}} allowed) to reduce the pressure put on the wild populations. A 3-year study in Texas indicated that over 7,000 box turtles {{were taken from the}} wild for commercial trade. A similar study in Louisiana found that in a 41-month period, nearly 30,000 box turtles were taken from the wild for resale, many for export to Europe. Once captured, turtles are often kept in poor conditions where up to half of <b>them</b> <b>die.</b> Those living long enough to be sold may suffer from conditions such as malnutrition, dehydration, and infection.|$|E
25|$|Wastewater {{may contain}} {{high levels of}} the {{nutrients}} nitrogen and phosphorus. Excessive release to the environment {{can lead to a}} buildup of nutrients, called eutrophication, which can in turn encourage the overgrowth of weeds, algae, and cyanobacteria (blue-green algae). This may cause an algal bloom, a rapid growth in the population of algae. The algae numbers are unsustainable and eventually most of <b>them</b> <b>die.</b> The decomposition of the algae by bacteria uses up so much of the oxygen in the water that most or all of the animals die, which creates more organic matter for the bacteria to decompose. In addition to causing deoxygenation, some algal species produce toxins that contaminate drinking water supplies. Different treatment processes are required to remove nitrogen and phosphorus.|$|E

500|$|The {{substantia nigra}} {{is a small}} {{midbrain}} area that forms {{a component of the}} basal ganglia. This has two parts—an input area called the pars compacta and an output area the pars reticulata. The dopaminergic neurons are found mainly in the pars compacta (cell group A8) and nearby (group A9). [...] In humans, the projection of dopaminergic neurons from the substantia nigra pars compacta to the dorsal striatum, termed the nigrostriatal pathway, plays {{a significant role in the}} control of motor function and in learning new motor skills. [...] These neurons are especially vulnerable to damage, and when a large number of <b>them</b> <b>die,</b> the result is a parkinsonian syndrome.|$|E
500|$|At {{some point}} on the mission, Bond meets the {{principal}} Bond girl, a character portraying Bond's love interest {{or one of his}} main sex objects. There is always one Bond girl central to the plot, and often one or two others who cross his path, helpful or not. They may be victims rescued by Bond, or else ally agents, villainesses, or henchwomen. Many partner with Bond on the assignment, while others such as Honey Ryder are solely passive participants in the mission. More generally, the degree to which Bond girls are pivotal to propelling the plot forward varies from one film to the next. Five of the Bond girls are [...] "bad" [...] girls (or at least working for the villain) who turn [...] "good" [...] (or switch sides) usually due to Bond's influence. Bond has fallen in love with only Tracy di Vicenzo in On Her Majesty's Secret Service and Vesper Lynd in Casino Royale, but both of <b>them</b> <b>die</b> at or {{near the end of the}} respective films.|$|E
500|$|In Gorgona, Seacole briefly ran a woman-only hotel. In late 1852, she {{travelled}} home to Jamaica.

[...] In 1853, soon after arriving home, Seacole was asked by the Jamaican medical authorities to minister to victims of a severe outbreak of yellow fever. [...] She found that she could do little, because the epidemic was so severe.

After being involved with BWMT three years, he began the San Francisco BWMT's AIDS task force in 1984. He invited representatives of many AIDS organizations to his home a week after a presentation held by BWMT. This was the first meeting of the task force where they talked about AIDS-related concerns of gay men of color.|$|E
2500|$|If {{you desire}} long life, {{the first thing}} you must do is to expel the three corpses.

2500|$|As {{the first}} Grand Lodge {{gathered}} momentum the Rev. James Anderson was commissioned to digest the [...] "gothic constitutions" [...] {{into a more}} palatable form. The result, in 1723, was the first printed constitutions. While manuscript constitutions continued {{to be used in}} unaffiliated lodges, their condensation into print saw <b>them</b> <b>die</b> out {{by the end of the}} century. Anderson's introduction advertised a history of Freemasonry from the beginning of the world. The York legend was therefore still employed, and persisted through reprints, pocket editions, and Preston's Illustrations of Freemasonry. Anderson's regulations, the second part of the book, followed on a set of charges devised by George Payne during his second term as Grand Master. Both charges and regulations were geared to the needs of a Grand Lodge, necessarily moving away from the simplicity of the originals. When a new Grand Lodge sprang up to carry the older rite, which they saw as abandoned by the [...] "Moderns", their constitutions had a different approach to history. Ahiman Rezon parodied the old history of the craft, and Anderson's research. The charges and regulations of the Antients were derived from Anderson by way of Pratt's Irish Constitutions. Almost inevitably, the legendary history disappeared after the union of the two Grand Lodges in 1813.|$|E
