500|$|Relatively small (5 foot 7, 180 pounds (82kg)), Rogan was solidly {{built and}} strong, with thin legs and a narrow waist but broad shoulders. He threw and batted right-handed, and used an unusually heavy bat. [...] "You saw Ernie Banks hit in his prime, then you saw Rogan", said Buck O'Neil. [...] "He could hit that ball...He was <b>the</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>guy</b> that stood {{a long way}} from the plate. Not too close, because they'd jam you." [...] According to his {{longtime}} teammate Frank Duncan, [...] "Rogan was one of the best low-ball hitters I ever saw, and one of the best curve-ball hitters. Rogan taught Bob and Irish Meusel how to hit curve balls." [...] While not extremely fast, he ran the bases well and stole when necessary.|$|E
500|$|Speedie had a {{brief and}} cold reunion with Brown in 1977, when the two met at the annual East–West Shrine Game, a college all-star game. Speedie {{introduced}} himself to Brown, only to be told, [...] "Yes, I know. You're the one who went to Canada." [...] Speedie's friends and former teammates lobbied repeatedly for his inclusion in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, but Speedie believed that his conflict with Brown was keeping him out even as numerous former teammates, including Otto Graham, Dante Lavelli and Marion Motley were inducted. He was placed on an old-timers' list of nominees for induction into the hall in the mid-1980s, but ultimately was passed over. [...] "Quite honestly, I think Paul Brown is the reason" [...] for Speedie's exclusion, Graham said in 1991. [...] "Paul wasn't <b>the</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>guy</b> you crossed. He would never forget it." ...|$|E

50|$|Matt Riddlehoover wrote, directed, {{edited and}} stars in this seriocomic feature about a gay playwright who feeds off his {{stubborn}} attraction to <b>the</b> wrong <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>guy</b> (played in multiple roles by Jonas Brandon). When he attracts {{the attention of}} a newspaper columnist (Lindsey Hancock) who will champion his work, success seems guaranteed until he meets her boyfriend - played by Brandon. The film excels in Riddlehoover's delivery as the self-absorbed, flawed hero. His timing is impressive, given that he was also directing himself. Winner of the MySpace Film User's Choice Award.|$|R
500|$|The Capitals did {{not give}} Hunter his first NHL win until his third game, a 3–2 win over the Ottawa Senators that broke a four-game losing streak. Brooks Laich scored the game-winning goal just 12 seconds into the {{overtime}} period. The goal {{would prove to be}} the fastest overtime goal scored during the 2011–12 NHL regular season. In the rematch four days later, Ovechkin appeared to spear Senators forward Chris Neil. Following a Neil hit on Ovechkin, the pair skated up the ice, whereupon Neil fell to the ice following the alleged spear. Neil was given an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty for diving. A spearing penalty, if called, would have resulted in a five-minute major penalty and a game misconduct. Later in the game, Ovechkin scored the eventual game-winning goal, his first goal in six games. When asked about the incident after the game, Neil described it as a [...] "pitchfork in the gut," [...] while Ovechkin stated he was [...] "not <b>the</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>guy</b> who spears players." [...] The following day, a league spokesman stated that Ovechkin would not be suspended or fined for the incident.|$|E
2500|$|On April 19, 2016, during Game 4 of the Chicago Blackhawks' first-round {{series against}} the St. Louis Blues, Andrew Shaw was penalized for {{interference}} with 2:04 remaining {{in the third period}} while the Blackhawks down by a goal. He was recorded using an anti-gay slur during a tirade in the penalty box, and the recording circulated widely on social media. As a result, the NHL suspended him for Game 5, fined him $5,000 for related hand gestures, and ordered him to undergo sensitivity training. The following day Shaw apologized to the gay and lesbian community saying [...] "That's not <b>the</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>guy</b> I am" [...] and that [...] "I have no excuses for ..." [...] getting caught up {{in the heat of the}} competition. After the press conference, Shaw personally apologized to Chicago Tribune reporter Chris Hine, who is gay. Blackhawks captain Jonathan Toews, who had previously recorded a You Can Play video, said the incident was a learning experience for Shaw. After being traded to the Montreal Canadiens during the off-season, Shaw volunteered to be the team's ambassador to You Can Play as “a leader in the locker room and in the community on diversity, equality and inclusion." [...] The announcement was met by skepticism by some.|$|E
2500|$|Carl is Kirsty's ex-boyfriend, and Coonan {{explained}} {{that they were in}} a relationship [...] before he went to prison. Carl was in his early 20s and Kirsty was 16 when they met and he became obsessive of her. Their relationship was based on hedonism and excess, rather than tenderness. When he went to prison, Kirsty promised to wait for him to be released, but she realised their relationship was toxic and ceased all contact. She then went on to marry Max. Carl is still in love with Kirsty, believing her to be [...] "the only woman for him" [...] and his second mission in Walford is to get her back. Coonan said this would cause problems between Carl and Max. He later said that [...] "In Carl's head, he's coming in on a white horse to save Kirsty from a bad marriage", and {{explained that}} while Carl was in prison he focussed on Kirsty, and she [...] "become an object of this freedom he was dreaming about. [...] Now he sees she's poodling after Max and that he isn't treating her right." [...] However, he thought that Kirsty may not want to reunite with Carl because [...] "he's not <b>the</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>guy</b> who's just going to change overnight" [...] and he is probably not [...] "the knight in shining armour" [...] he thinks he is. Coonan {{went on to say that}} Carl would treat Kirsty [...] "like a goddess" [...] but would probably have a problem with her independence, and he would want to provide for her, being [...] "old-fashioned and a bit misguided", and they would have a [...] "fiery" [...] relationship because they are both [...] "strong-willed". Kierston Wareing, who plays Kirsty, opined that her character is more suited to Carl than to Max, and hoped they could be a [...] "manipulative, power couple".|$|E

Fellow Bremen player Christian Schulz, who bears no relationship to him, is regularly celebrated like this because of him.

However, after Luke skips town with a comatose Laura, Scott charged him with kidnapping; {{in order to get the}} charges dropped, and her older brother Nikolas Cassadine (Tyler Christopher) reinstated as Laura's guardian, Lulu promised to give Logan a second chance. Despite Logan's betrayal, Lulu still cared for him and tried to maintain their friendship. Also, seeing Scott willing to give up Laura for Logan to be happy, caused Lulu to see Scott in a different light, much to her father's dismay. Johnny enters the picture at a very convenient time as Lulu ran off with him to avoid facing Logan. Berman describes Lulu as being attracted to people with [...] "baggage," [...] as she can relate to them, due to her own chaotic life.

The danger Johnny brings is very familiar to Lulu. At times, he scared her, and was very unpredictable, but Lulu seemed to have a calming effect on him, which only strengthened their attraction. When the duo break into a cabin, Johnny pulls a gun on the owner, threatening to kill him, and Lulu is able to talk him out of it.

5000|$|In late June 1945, Hank Greenberg {{returned}} from World War II, creating a coaching dilemma for manager O'Neill.

O'Neill considered moving Outlaw to right field, {{where he had}} played for {{the latter half of}} the 1944 season (after Wakefield returned), but that would have required benching Roy Cullenbine. O'Neill opted instead to move Outlaw to third base, where Outlaw had played earlier in his career. At the time, Detroit sports writer Sam Greene wrote that [...] "Outlaw's gift of speed and recent batting consistency have made him one of the most valuable Tigers." [...] Outlaw played 21 games at third base in the regular season and started all seven games of the 1945 World Series at third base.
