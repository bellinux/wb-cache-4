5|$|Soon afterward, Alan Ray {{came back}} into the picture, {{claiming}} that he had proof the card had been doctored by Mastro at one point after the initial $25,000 trade in 1985. He had a photograph of the card taken before the transaction with Mastro and claimed that the card in the photo looked significantly different from <b>the</b> <b>photo</b> <b>of</b> Gretzky's card. He sent the comparison of the two photos to both McNall and Sotheby's, but never received a response back. Some memorabilia collectors have dismissed Ray's claims, saying that the photo hardly proves any doctoring was ever done on the card.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, MacArthur had {{attacked}} the imperial mystique when his staff released the famous {{picture of his}} first meeting with the Emperor, whose impact on the Japanese public was electric as the Japanese people for the first time saw the Emperor as a mere man overshadowed by the much taller MacArthur instead of the living god he had always been portrayed as. Up to 1945, the Emperor had been a remote, mysterious figure to his people, rarely seen in public and always silent, whose photographs were always taken from a certain angle to make him look taller and more impressive than he really was. No Japanese photographer would have taken such a photo of the Emperor being overshadowed by MacArthur. The Japanese government immediately banned <b>the</b> <b>photo</b> <b>of</b> the Emperor with MacArthur {{on the grounds that it}} damaged the imperial mystique, but MacArthur rescinded the ban and ordered all of the Japanese newspapers to print it. The photo was intended as a message to the Emperor about who was going to be the senior partner in their relationship.|$|E
5|$|Forgotten {{for nearly}} 13 years, the Changi Murals were accidentally rediscovered in 1958 by {{servicemen}} of the Royal Air Force (RAF) occupying the Roberts Barracks. The Chapel was again {{used as a}} store, and later as accommodation by the RAF. Once rediscovered, the distemper coating covering the murals was carefully removed – four complete murals and the top-quarter of a fifth were revealed. As there was no signature {{on any of the}} murals, a search for the artist was undertaken but failed after initial investigations. By a stroke of luck, the artist's name came to light in the RAF Changi Education Library of all places. A reader came across a book titled The Churches of the Captivity in Malaya, mentioning about the Chapel of St Luke in Roberts Barracks and the artist's name – Bombardier Stanley Warren. The Daily Mirror was notified and again went to work looking for the known artist. In February 1959, he was found living in London with his wife and son. He was shocked when he saw <b>the</b> <b>photo</b> <b>of</b> his mural of the Crucifixion, when a keen-eyed colleague of his showed him the papers.|$|E

However, before he leaves, Deep Throat {{approaches}} Mulder at his apartment, offering <b>the</b> <b>photo</b> <b>of</b> a purported UFO at Fort Benning, Georgia. Mulder initially believes that Druce's truck is a decoy meant to distract him from the UFO, but discovers that Deep Throat's photo is a fake. When Mulder confronts Deep Throat, he admits his deception and confirms that the earlier transmission was genuine. He also divulges that the truck is being used to transport an extraterrestrial biological entity, or E.B.E., that was recovered from the Iraqi crash site. Mulder and Scully escape their pursuers and head towards Las Vegas, the last known location of the truck.|$|E
5|$|The figure {{arrives at}} Valestra's house but finds the gangster dead by Joker's hands. Joker has {{strapped}} a camera to Valestra's corpse {{and sees the}} murderer is not Batman. The figure escapes as the house explodes. Batman pursues the killer, but is interrupted {{by the police and}} rescued from arrest by Andrea. Andrea later explains that she and her father had been hiding in Europe from Valestra's mob, from whom he had embezzled money; her father repaid, but they put out a hit on him. Bruce now believes her father is the killer. Bruce ponders resuming his relationship with Andrea and giving up Batman. He notices a familiar-looking man in the background of <b>the</b> <b>photo</b> <b>of</b> Bronski, Valestra, Sol and Beaumont: the man who would become the Joker. Joker visits Reeves and presses him for information; Reeves insists that Batman is the cloaked killer. He professes his ignorance but Joker believes Reeves needs to protect his reputation and poisons him. Reeves is taken to the hospital where Batman later breaks in and interrogates him. Reeves confesses he helped the Beaumonts escape and told Valestra's mob their location.|$|E
5|$|Veronica shows one of {{the rape}} victims (Krista Kalmus) <b>the</b> <b>photo</b> <b>of</b> a suspect, but she doesn’t {{recognize}} him. In criminology class, Veronica does {{a case study of}} Weevil (Francis Capra), and the class enjoys it. After the study, Veronica tells Weevil that she’s dating Logan (Jason Dohring), and he reacts negatively. Veronica then walks into Mars Investigations and finds Cyrus O’Dell and his wife (Jaime Ray Newman) talking with Keith, while Veronica herself does some detective work. Keith informs Veronica that Dean O’Dell’s stepson is dying and that he wants Keith to find the boy’s biological father. At Mercer's (Ryan Devlin) party, two masked men enter and steal everyone’s valuables, including the necklace that Lilly gave Veronica. Wallace (Percy Daggs III) is failing his mechanical engineering class, a subject in which he wanted to major. Meanwhile, Keith tracks down the husband, and Veronica accuses Weevil of robbing the party.|$|E

5|$|Hines was traumatised by his {{experiences}} during World War I. For 40 years afterwards {{he lived in}} a humpy made of cloth bags near Mount Druitt on the outskirts of Sydney, and never married. The humpy was surrounded by a fence on which he hung helmets taken from German soldiers; he became well known to locals, though school children were afraid of him. Hines was unable to find consistent work, and lived on his Army pension as well as income from odd jobs and selling his souvenirs. He gained renewed fame when <b>the</b> <b>photo</b> <b>of</b> him at Polygon Wood was displayed at the temporary Australian War Museum in Sydney (the predecessor of the Australian War Memorial) from 1933, and several newspapers and magazines aimed at former servicemen published profiles of him. An article in the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia's magazine Reveille in 1934 highlighted Hines' desperate living conditions and stated that he had been unemployed for four years. Several former soldiers sent money to him in response to this article. Hines' pension was also doubled, though this income made him ineligible for relief work during the Great Depression. Despite his poverty, Hines travelled to Concord Repatriation Hospital each week to donate a suitcase of vegetables from his garden to the former soldiers being treated there.|$|E
5|$|Mansfield's {{publicity}} antics {{are another}} recurring theme in popular culture. On the season 32 episode of Saturday Night Live hosted by Alec Baldwin (with musical guest Christina Aguilera), {{one of the}} commercial bumpers has Alec Baldwin PhotoShopped into the famous picture of Sophia Loren staring at Mansfield's chest at Romanoff's in Beverly Hills. It was a direct reference to publicity stunt of Mansfield in April 1957 intended to deflect attention from Loren during a dinner party in the Italian star's honor. Photographs of the encounter were published around the world. The most famous image showed Loren raising a contemptuous eyebrow at the American actress who, sitting between Loren and her dinner companion, Clifton Webb, had leaned over the table, allowing her breasts to spill over her low neckline and exposing one nipple. <b>The</b> <b>photo</b> <b>of</b> Sophia Loren sitting next to Jayne Mansfield and regarding her cleavage inspired other photographers too. In 1993, Daniela Federici created an homage with Anna Nicole Smith as Mansfield and New York City DJ Sky Nellor as Loren for a Guess Jeans campaign. Later, Mark Seliger took a picture named Heidi Klum at Romanoff's with Heidi Klum in a reproduction of the restaurant set. The meeting between Mansfield and Anton LaVey, the founder and high priest of the Church of Satan, was a much publicized and oft quoted event of her life, {{as well as the}} history of the Church.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} sets of {{the boats}} were not built specifically for the programme, but were pulled together from stock items from various prop warehouses. Cumming had originally hoped to simulate the rocking of the ships by mounting the sets on rollers but the idea was dropped due to costs, with the effect achieved by moving the cameras instead. <b>The</b> <b>photo</b> <b>of</b> Tegan's Aunt Vanessa, one of the items created by Marriner from the contents of her mind, was shot specifically for the filming, requiring Dolore Whiteman (who had played the character in Logopolis) to be contracted for a one-day photoshoot. The models {{of the boats}}, used in the racing sequences, were props sourced by visual effects designer Mike Kelt following extensive research at the National Maritime Museum. The ships were mounted on rods for filming, while the oars were battery operated. The model of Davey's ship remained intact, with explosion being a filmed effect that was edited into the sequence. Kelt {{was shocked by the}} dilapidated state of the TARDIS console prop, and was worried about damaging it while filming the explosion from Part One, and asked producer John Nathan-Turner if he could replace it but was told there was no money available.|$|E

25|$|In February 2009, Fairey filed {{a federal}} {{lawsuit against the}} Associated Press, seeking a declaratory {{judgment}} that {{his use of the}} AP photograph was protected by the fair use doctrine and so did not infringe their copyright. At first, Fairey claimed that he used <b>the</b> <b>photo</b> <b>of</b> Clooney and Obama, cropped the actor out of the shot, and made other changes. In October 2009, Shepard Fairey admitted he had tried to deceive the Court by destroying evidence that he had instead used the photograph alleged by the AP. Fairey admitted he had used a close-up shot of Obama, also taken by Mannie Garcia, as the AP had long alleged.

Police recognized <b>the</b> <b>photos</b> <b>of</b> Miller as [...] "Jane Doe #60" [...] and arrested Bradford on suspicion of murder; using a rock formation visible in one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>photos</b> <b>of</b> Miller, police were able to locate the camp site in the desert where the murders had occurred.
