Each dynamic system calculates the output values that reflect the personality, by being used as system matrices, input matrices, and output matrices. These responses are reflected in <b>the</b> final <b>emotional</b> behavior through a behavior dynamic system as with humans. <b>The</b> final <b>emotional</b> behavior includes multiple emotional values, and a social robot shows various emotional expressions.

5|$|The author Rupert Christiansen {{points out}} that the {{painting}} depicts more figures than had been on the raft {{at the time of the}} rescue—including corpses which were not recorded by the rescuers.

5|$|A feature {{already present}} in the {{treatments}} of the love story by Chaucer, Henryson, Shakespeare and Dryden is the repeated reinvention of its conclusion. Boitani sees this as a continuing struggle by authors to find a satisfying resolution to the love triangle. The major difficulty is <b>the</b> <b>emotional</b> dissatisfaction resulting from how the tale, as originally invented by Benoît, is embedded into the pre-existing narrative of the Trojan War with its demands for the characters to meet their traditional fates. This narrative has Troilus, the sympathetic protagonist of the love story, killed by Achilles, a character totally disconnected from the love triangle, Diomedes survive to return to Greece victorious, and Cressida disappear from consideration {{as soon as it}} is known that she has fallen for the Greek. Modern authors continue to invent their own resolutions.|$|E
5|$|According to flashbacks {{during the}} game, Squall {{grew up in}} an orphanage with the other playable {{characters}} (except Rinoa).

He gradually warms, and it is later revealed that his detachment from his companions is a defensive mechanism to protect himself from <b>the</b> <b>emotional</b> pain he suffered when he and his older sister were separated.|$|E

5|$|After the play's initial run, Kooman {{revised the}} script, making {{prominent}} {{changes in the}} scenes involving Jason and Marta. In the version performed at the premiere, the two characters debate issues of human rights on a solely philosophical level, while in the new version, Marta makes real demands of Jason, making their interactions more dynamic. Kooman made Jason's wife Ali more patient and understanding in dealing with Jason's lengthy absences from home and removed the intermission. According to reviewer Lana Michelin of the Red Deer Advocate, Kooman's changes strengthened <b>the</b> <b>emotional</b> pull of the play. Because {{of the amount of}} interest in She Has a Name in 2011, not enough tickets were available for the initial run, and a second run was planned for the end of 2011. To finance a tour of the play, Burnt Thicket Theatre raised money through fundraisers, which included the 2011 Calgary Ride for Refuge.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in {{the seventeenth}} century, composers began {{creating}} works of a more emotional style. They felt that a monophonic style better suited <b>the</b> <b>emotional</b> music and wrote musical parts for instruments that would complement the singing human voice. As a result, many instruments that were incapable of larger ranges and dynamics, and therefore were seen as unemotional, fell out of favor. One such instrument was the shawm. Bowed instruments such as the violin, viola, baryton, and various lutes dominated popular music. Beginning in around 1750, however, the lute disappeared from musical compositions {{in favor of the}} rising popularity of the guitar. As the prevalence of string orchestras rose, wind instruments such as the flute, oboe, and bassoon were readmitted to counteract the monotony of hearing only strings.|$|E
5|$|Cameron's {{inspiration}} for the film came from his fascination with shipwrecks; he felt a love story interspersed with the human loss would be essential to convey <b>the</b> <b>emotional</b> impact of the disaster. Production began in 1995, when Cameron shot footage of the actual Titanic wreck. The modern scenes on the research vessel were shot on board the Akademik Mstislav Keldysh, which Cameron had used as a base when filming the wreck. Scale models, computer-generated imagery, and a reconstruction of the Titanic built at Playas de Rosarito in Baja California were used to re-create the sinking. The film was partially funded by Paramount Pictures and 20th Century Fox. It was the most expensive film ever made at the time, with a production budget of $200million.|$|E
