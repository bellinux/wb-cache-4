5|$|Rushing {{to assist}} Murakumo, Asagumo and Natsugumo were {{attacked}} by another group of 11 CAF SBDs and TBFs escorted by 12 fighters at 15:45. An SBD placed its bomb almost directly amidships on Natsugumo while two more near misses contributed to her severe damage. After Asagumo <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>her</b> survivors, Natsugumo sank at 16:27. The CAF aircraft also scored several more hits on the stationary Murakumo, setting her afire. After her crew abandoned ship, Shirayuki scuttled her with a torpedo, picked up her survivors, and joined {{the rest of the}} Japanese warships for the remainder of their return trip to the Shortland Islands.|$|E
5|$|Warrior {{was heavily}} {{damaged by the}} German shells, which caused large fires and heavy flooding, {{although}} the engine room crew - of whom only three survived - kept the engines running for long enough {{to allow her to}} withdraw to the west. She was taken in tow by the seaplane tender HMS Engadine who <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>her</b> surviving crew of 743. She was abandoned in a rising sea at 8:25a.m. on 1 June when her upper deck was only 4feet (1.2m) above the water, and subsequently foundered.|$|E
5|$|House {{was filmed}} {{on one of}} Toho's largest sets, where Obayashi shot the film without a {{storyboard}} {{over a period of}} about two months. Obayashi described the attitude on the set as very upbeat as he often skipped, sang and played quiz games with the younger actresses on the set. Despite having fun on the set, members of the Toho crew felt the film was nonsense. Obayashi found the acting of the seven girls to be poor while trying to direct them verbally. He began playing the film's soundtrack on set, which changed the way the girls were acting in the film as they got into the spirit of the music. Actress Kimiko Ikegami was uncomfortable about a nude scene in the film. To make her more comfortable, Yoko Minamida also <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>her</b> clothes. After Obayashi saw Minamida nude, he included a nude scene for her in the film which was not in the original script.|$|E

25|$|One {{persistent}} rumor {{was especially}} prevalent in Europe; fake news circulated that Shirley {{was not a}} child but a 30-year-old dwarf {{due in part to}} her stocky body type. The rumor was so prevalent that the Vatican dispatched Father Silvio Massante to investigate if she were indeed a child. The fact that she never seemed to miss any teeth led some people to conclude that she had all her adult teeth. Temple was actually losing her teeth regularly through her days with 20th Century Fox, most notably during the sidewalk ceremony in front of Grauman's Theatre, where she <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>her</b> shoes and placed her bare feet in the cement to take attention away from her face. When acting, she wore dental plates and caps to hide the gaps in her teeth. Another rumor pertaining to her teeth was the idea that they were filed to make them appear like baby teeth.|$|E

The flooding disabled her engines and electricity generators, which cut off power to the pumps that were trying {{to keep pace with the}} progressively worsening flooding. With the pumps shut off, there was no hope to save Karlsruhe, and so her commander, Friedrich Rieve issued the order to abandon her two hours after the attack.
