5|$|SJS has {{roots in}} {{criminal}} trials during the Vietnam War era, but {{in modern times}} is usually employed in high-stakes civil litigation (where only money is usually at issue, in contrast to criminal trials, where the defendant can go to prison). SJS practitioners determine what background characteristics and attitudes predict favorable results, and then coordinate with attorneys in choosing the jury. Studies are mixed as {{to the effectiveness of}} the practice, though {{it is clear that the}} evidence presented at trial is the most important determiner of verdicts (the trial result) and that SJS is more likely to have an impact where that evidence is ambiguous. SJS's potential to unfairly skew <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>has</b> led to some reform proposals, but none have yet been implemented. The limited fictional portrayals of SJS have been negative towards the practice.|$|E
25|$|Every death {{sentence}} involves first an eligibility determination {{and then a}} selection of an eligible defendant {{for the death penalty}}. A defendant is eligible for the death penalty once <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>has</b> concluded that {{he is a member of}} that narrow class of criminal defendants who have committed the most morally outrageous of crimes. An eligible defendant is then selected for the death penalty after the sentencer takes into account mitigating evidence about the character and record of the defendant in order to decide whether that individual is worthy of a {{death sentence}}.|$|E
25|$|In medieval England, {{the penalty}} for {{a vast number of}} serious crimes, {{including}} murder, was death. This rule traveled with the colonists to America, and was the law in all states at the time the Eighth Amendment was adopted in 1791. By then, however, a problem with the common-law mandatory death penalty had crept into the legal system. If <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>has</b> only two options—convicting a defendant of murder, where the penalty is death, or acquitting the defendant outright—it has no vehicle to express the sentiment that the defendant should be punished somehow, but not executed. Faced with this dilemma, some juries would acquit the defendant in order to spare his life. Of course, this meant that an obviously guilty person would go free.|$|E

500|$|The actual {{efficacy}} of jury consultants {{may not be}} very important because the demographic composition of <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>has</b> {{little effect on the}} verdict it renders, usually causing only a 5%–15% variance in verdicts. The evidence presented at trial has far more impact on what the verdict will be. As Kressel and Kressel indicate, [...] "when the evidence is strong, nothing else matters much" [...] and even when the evidence is ambiguous, demographic characteristics of jurors are a relatively minor influence. Some researchers argue that a significant improvement in jury selection, however small, may be worthwhile when the stakes are high, like for a defendant accused of a capital crime or a corporation that stands to lose millions of dollars in a civil suit.|$|E
500|$|That Robert Dudley {{might have}} {{influenced}} <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>has</b> been argued by George Bernard, Susan Doran, and by Chris Skidmore. The foreman, Sir Richard Smith (mayor of Abingdon in 1564/1565), {{had been a}} household servant of Princess Elizabeth and {{is described as a}} former [...] "Queen's man" [...] and a [...] "lewd" [...] person in Hales' 1563 chronicle, while Dudley gave a [...] "Mr. Smith", also a [...] "Queen's man", a present of some stuffs to make a gown from in 1566; six years after the inquest. It has, however, not been established that Sir Richard Smith and the [...] "Mr. Smith" [...] of 1566 {{are one and the same}} person, Smith being a [...] "very common" [...] name. Susan Doran has pointed out that any interference with the jury could be as easily explained by the desire to cover up a suicide rather than a murder.|$|E

Previously, <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>had</b> asked questions of the judge, including clarifications of [...] "reasonable doubt" [...] and whether they were permitted {{to come to a}} verdict [...] "based on a reason that was not presented in court". The judge commented that <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>had</b> an 'absolutely fundamental deficit in understanding'. The retrial ended on 7 March with Pryce's conviction by a unanimous jury, and sentencing was adjourned.|$|R
2500|$|In July 2010, Lucas {{expressed}} {{her support}} for seven campaigners of the Smash EDO campaign who had caused approximately £180,000 damage to an EDO MBM arms factory and were acquitted of conspiring to cause criminal damage. The jury accepted their defence of lawful excuse – action undertaken {{to prevent a}} much worse crime – because the company manufactured and sold certain components used by the Israeli military, notably in its assault on Gaza. Lucas stated that: [...] "I am absolutely delighted <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>has</b> recognised that {{the actions of the}} decommissioners were a legitimate response to the atrocities being committed in Gaza. I do not advocate non-violent direct action lightly ... their actions were driven by the responsibility to prevent further suffering in Gaza." ...|$|E
2500|$|In United States v. Moylan, , Fourth Circuit Court of Appeal {{unanimously}} ruled: [...] "If {{the jury}} {{feels that the}} law under which the defendant is accused is unjust, or exigent circumstances justified {{the actions of the}} accused, or for any reason which appeals to their logic or passion, <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>has</b> the right to acquit, and the courts must abide that decision." [...] The Fully Informed Jury Association is a non-profit educational organization dedicated to informing jurors of their rights and seeking the passage of laws to require judges to inform jurors that they can and should judge the law. [...] In Sparf v. United States, , the Supreme Court, in a 5-4 decision, held that a trial judge has no responsibility to inform the jury of the right to nullify laws.|$|E
2500|$|There was {{a gender}} gap in {{perceptions}} to the case. According to a USA Today/Gallup Poll of 1,010 respondents, {{about two-thirds of}} Americans (64 percent) believed Casey Anthony [...] "definitely" [...] or [...] "probably" [...] murdered her daughter; however, women {{were much more likely}} than men to believe the murder charges against Anthony and to be upset by the not-guilty verdict. The poll reported that women were more than twice as likely as men, 28 percent versus 11 percent, to think Anthony [...] "definitely" [...] committed murder. Twenty-seven percent of women said they were angry about the verdict, compared with nine percent of men. On the day Casey Anthony was sentenced for lying to investigators in the death of her daughter, supporters and protesters gathered outside the Orange County Courthouse, with one man who displayed a sign asking Anthony to marry him. Two men who drove overnight from West Virginia held signs that said, [...] "We love and support you Casey Anthony," [...] and [...] "Nancy Grace, stop trying to ruin innocent lives. <b>The</b> <b>jury</b> <b>has</b> spoken. P.S. Our legal system still works!" [...] The gender gap has partly been explained by [...] "the maternal instinct". The idea of a mother murdering her own child is a threat to the ideal of motherhood. For example, the trial was compared to the 1960s trial of Alice Crimmins, who was accused of murdering her two small children.|$|E

5000|$|... "The {{mere fact}} that a <b>jury</b> <b>has</b> been without sleep will not vitiate its verdict if its {{agreement}} was deliberate and voluntary and not due to fatigue and exhaustion," [...] Moore wrote. He found it significant that <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>had,</b> when finally offered the real possibility of sleep in the early morning, instead chosen to continue deliberations and made some progress. [...] "It might well be that, figuratively speaking, <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>had</b> gotten its second wind."

2500|$|His {{ability to}} {{correctly}} identify the biggest goats {{of a game}} is also widely admired, particularly when contrasted to archrival Russell Hantz's inability to not only keep the respect of a jury as Rob can, but to accurately judge the weakest opponents {{to bring to the}} end as Rob does. [...] However, many fans criticize Rob for his huge advantage in being a four-time player and having no real competition the entire season, giving him perhaps the easiest win in Survivor history. His tribemates were criticized for being too starstruck to act against Rob. Some fans also criticize him for probably having been unable to beat anyone other than his 2 ultimate goats (based upon cast interviews, amongst other indicators). [...] <b>The</b> <b>jury</b> <b>has</b> even indicated Phillip Sheppard could have beaten him had he followed through with his plan to [...] "own his game" [...] and reveal that he had purposely played the villain role to get taken to the end by Rob, and in doing so had duped Rob and his entire alliance. Instead Sheppard was rude, lashed out at Julie Wolfe after she had asked him if his son would be proud of the way he played the game, and gave all the credit to Rob, thus receiving only 1 vote (from Ralph Kiser, the one jury member Phillip showed respect towards at Final Tribal and throughout the game) and giving Rob the easy finish glove side.|$|E

60|$|This is {{only the}} long panel. Now <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>has</b> to be formed.

Then he can object to as many more as he chooses, on showing cause, and you may be sure Mr. O'Laugher has a great many causes to show. One man has lived near young Macdermot all his life, has been a friend of his, must have formed an opinion on the case, and is therefore not fit: another man has been his enemy, and is therefore not fit; a third man used to drive with Captain Ussher twice a week; a fourth lived in Mohill; a fifth at Drumsna; a sixth did not live in the county at all; a seventh had not a house of his own, and so on. Why, it appeared there was not a proper juror in the county! On all these objections Mr. O'Laugher was beaten; and as he was beaten on each, he indefatigably prepared for the next.|$|E

The Court is a father, and has been at a loss to understand the relations existing between father and son in this case. The Court thinks he understands them better now.

The plea of the father has enlightened the Court on one or two most vital points. Nothing is further from the mind of the Court than the desire to do injury to a handsome and talented boy. Believing that the father and son are about to become more closely united, the Court here transmutes the sentence to one hundred dollars fine and six months in the county jail. This will make it possible for the son and father to meet often, and the father can continue his duties to the church. This the Court decides upon as the final disposition of the accused. The case is closed. Call the next case." ...|$|E
6000|$|Thus the Squire was gained, and {{the younger}} daughter. But Mr. Smirkie was as obdurate as ever.

Mr. Smirkie did indeed cling to his doctrine that your real drunkard never drinks at his meals; but when Dick, on being pressed in regard to wine, apologised by {{saying that he had}} become so used to tea in the colonies as {{not to be able to}} take anything else at dinner, the peculiarity was discussed till he was driven to own that he had drank nothing stronger for the last two years. Then it became plain that delirium tremens was not written on his face quite so plainly as Mr. Smirkie had at first thought, and there was nothing left but his trousers to condemn him. But Mr. Smirkie was still confident. 'I don't think you can go beyond the verdict,' he said. 'There may be a pardon, of course;--though I shall never believe it till I see it. But though there were twenty pardons she ought not to go back to him. The pardon does not alter the crime,--and whether he was married in Australia, or whether he was not, she ought to think that he was, because <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>has</b> said so.
