By 1934, industrial employment was reduced by half. In 1935, Westinghouse located a Small Motor Division in Lima to build fractional horsepower electric motors. The Ohio Steel Foundry <b>turned</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> and grew, eventually expanding its successes in its industry. The thirties were a decade for organizing labor in Lima. By 1940 {{there were at least}} fifty labor unions representing local workers.|$|E

500|$|... "Office Olympics" [...] {{received}} mostly positive reviews. Michael Sciannamea of TV Squad {{wrote that}} [...] "The Office has <b>turned</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> into separating {{itself from the}} [...] British version." [...] Sciannamea {{went on to say}} that [...] "although Michael still garners the most attention, the other characters are beginning to break out." [...] His only criticism of the episode was that [...] "Dwight is too creepy", Sciannamea suggested that the writers [...] "tone down his insanity a bit". [...] "Miss Alli" [...] of Television Without Pity graded the episode with a [...] "A-". Erik Adams of The A.V. Club awarded the episode an [...] "A" [...] and called it the show's [...] "first truly classic episode", due to the added [...] "verve" [...] of both plots. Adams praised the way the main story and Jim and Pam's stories were intercut with each other, so that both could play off of each other; he wrote that [...] "Michael Schur’s a great writer, and Paul Feig knows how to let superb comedic performances flow from his actors, but the stitch-up job here makes the two halves of the episodes complementary when they could’ve rocketed in opposite directions and ripped 'Office Olympics' apart." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{finishing}} with a 6-10 record in 1996, the Buccaneers finished strong and {{showed signs of}} developing into a winning team. After a home win versus the Raiders, the Buccaneers fell to a quick 140 hole to the Chargers in San Diego. Instead of folding, the team fought to a hard win, their first win on the West Coast in 15 years. [...] Many Bucs fans {{believe that this was}} where the long-beleaguered franchise finally <b>turned</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner.</b> [...] It {{turned out to be the}} only losing season Dungy would suffer as a head coach.|$|E

In his last two first class matches for New South Wales in the 2010/11 season he scored 54, 115, 138 and 93. Australia's chairman of selectors, Andrew Hilditch, said [...] "I was thrilled for Phil, I think he <b>turned</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> the last game. I spent a bit of time with him before the last Shield game and he seemed to be in a really good place. Having had a tough season, to emerge like he has is a credit to him." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Guardian {{published}} on 30 March 2007 a story detailing inconsistencies between an account Blair gave of {{his involvement in}} the Balcombe Street Siege on the night of 6 December 1975, and the recollections of others involved at the time. In a 2006 interview, Blair had stated: [...] "We <b>turned</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner,</b> and there is the car ... It was a very defining moment. I think I spent the next half an hour pretending to be a bush. They {{got out of the car}} and started firing at us. It is an interesting experience being fired at when you have absolutely nothing to fire back with ... I loved it. I loved the job." ...|$|E
2500|$|After the {{motorcade}} <b>turned</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> onto Elm Street in Dealey Plaza, the First Lady heard {{what she thought}} to be a motorcycle backfiring and did not realize that it was a gunshot until she heard Governor Connally scream. Within 8.4 seconds, two more shots had rung out, and one of the shots struck her husband in the head. Almost immediately, she began to climb onto the back of the limousine; Secret Service agent Clint Hill later told the Warren Commission that he thought she had been reaching across the trunk for a piece of her husband's skull that had been blown off. Hill ran to the car and leapt onto it, directing her back to her seat. As Hill stood on the back bumper, Associated Press photographer Ike Altgens snapped a photograph that was featured on the front pages of newspapers around the world. She would later testify that she saw pictures [...] "of me climbing out the back. But I don't remember that at all".|$|E
