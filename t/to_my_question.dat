60|$|In {{the brief}} {{interval}} of silence, Miss Meadowcroft replied <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>question</b> {{from the other}} end of the hall.|$|E
60|$|I {{thanked him}} {{and made my}} way thither across the {{reception}} hall. The answer <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>question</b> was given at once.|$|E
60|$|Well and good! On {{that issue}} every Socialist is with them. But their answer <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>question</b> is none the less wrong.|$|E
5000|$|Instructor Support (Scale I, {{consisting}} of 8 items), (e.g. The instructor responds promptly <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>questions).</b>|$|R
6000|$|LADY BROCKLEHURST. Yes, I am. (Pointedly.) George, watch whether Crichton begins any of {{his answers}} <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>questions</b> with 'The fact is.' ...|$|R
60|$|When I came rightly <b>to</b> <b>my</b> remembrance, they <b>questioned</b> me {{as to what}} I {{had seen}} and heard in the Red Room. And I told them as best I could, though much aggrieved that <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>questions</b> they would answer nothing save to bid me to stay still and think not of the matter.|$|R
60|$|The guide looks slowly {{all round}} him, and {{then looks at}} me. That is his answer <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>question.</b> And that is enough.|$|E
60|$|The old fellow's eyes twinkled, {{while the}} other men ceased talking, {{and looked at him}} as if anticipating {{something}} good in reply <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>question.</b>|$|E
60|$|An Englishwoman {{would have}} felt, or {{would at least}} have assumed, some little {{hesitation}} at replying <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>question.</b> Naomi did not hesitate for an instant.|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps," [...] she said; [...] "but I ask for {{no answer}} <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>questions.</b> If {{you have your}} secrets, why may I not have mine? Now will you {{meet me at the}} Kaims?" ...|$|R
30|$|I {{employed}} the tourist guide technique while {{taking pictures of}} signs in the school buildings. The principals of the six schools accompanied me, guided me through the corridors, classrooms, and other public spaces, and responded <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>questions.</b>|$|R
60|$|Those words {{seemed to}} awaken in her {{something}} of the hope which I felt myself when I uttered them. She replied <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>questions</b> with more than docility--she exerted her intelligence; she willingly opened her whole mind to me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Clara," [...] said Conway, [...] "I do {{not know}} when I may have another chance of asking for an answer <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>question.</b> You heard my question?" ...|$|E
60|$|Instead of {{replying}} <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>question,</b> he eyed me {{for some}} time in silence with sullen, yellow-shot eyes, and then closed his knife with a loud snick.|$|E
6000|$|... "All this, my dear," [...] {{said the}} Lord Keeper, [...] "is no answer <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>question,</b> who this woman is, {{and what is}} her {{connexion}} with the former proprietor's family?" ...|$|E
6000|$|PEW. Stash your patter, damn you. (ARETHUSA gives in.) Ah, I thought it: Pew's way, Pew's way. Now {{look you}} here, my lovely woman. If you sling in another word that isn't in answer <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>questions,</b> I'll pull your j'ints out one by one. Where's the Commander? ...|$|R
60|$|For {{ten years}} I have waited {{and prayed for}} an answer <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>questions.</b> For ten years I have waited and prayed to be taken {{back to the world}} of my lost love. I would rather lie dead beside her there than live on Earth all those {{millions}} of terrible miles from her.|$|R
40|$|O. L. Griffith, 4929 Chestnut Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA, letter, [1920 s?], to Hamlin Garland (The Century Association), 7 West 43 rd Street, New York, New York, USA. "I cannot {{thank you}} {{appropriately}} for your very kind assistance, both in your answers <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>questions,</b> {{and in the}} references you gave me. " [...] first li...|$|R
60|$|Before many moments passed Sergeant Corney {{hit upon}} what I firmly {{believed}} {{was the true}} answer <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>question</b> of why an assault was to be made at this time.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I quite {{understand}} and respect your feeling, Miss Headworth,' returned the lady; 'but may I return <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>question</b> {{whether you think}} your niece has any doubt of her husband being dead.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{exceedingly}} {{obliged to}} you for your answer <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>question,</b> sir," [...] he said, saluting. [...] "I hope {{that in a few}} days we shall have some news for you." ...|$|E
6000|$|There was a {{crowd of}} such men around the land-office tents and many filings were made. Nearly every man had his little phial of gold to show. No one was loud, but every one seemed to be quietly {{confident}} and replied <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>questions</b> in a low voice, [...] "Well, you can safely say the country is all right." ...|$|R
6000|$|She laughed, {{a curious}} broken laugh, in answer <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>questions.</b> [...] "It was a silly dream I had," [...] she {{explained}} [...] "I {{must have been}} thinking of the conjurer we saw. I dreamt that a wicked Magician had spirited you away from me. I could not find you and was all alone in the world." ...|$|R
40|$|I {{have done}} a {{theoretical}} essay {{and to find out}} the answer <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>questions</b> I used literature study as my method. You can kind of say that I have used the literature as my empirical material, so my essay is in one way a qualitative study. I choose to have a social psychologist perspective <b>to</b> approach <b>my</b> <b>questions.</b> <b>To</b> answer the questions I have used a couple of researchers who a find relevant <b>to</b> answer <b>my</b> <b>questions.</b> I found Meads symbolic interactionism together with Goffmans theatremeatphor as an important theory to explain the social interaction. To explain why the destructive groups get barred from the community I have used Backers stampletheory. To describe what I think is good social work I have used Antonovskys KASAM-concept and his salutogenes-conduct. By writing this essay I have learned that groups have a great influence on the individual and destructive groups in special. The work of this essay has giving me knowledge how much theses destructive group's means to the individual and how different processes influence them...|$|R
60|$|As if {{in answer}} <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>question,</b> the lad entered at that moment, and upon seeing me sitting up, talking to Michelot, he uttered an exclamation of joy, and hurried forward to my bedside.|$|E
6000|$|... "Got a rifle?" [...] he demanded, {{with a rich}} Irish burr in his voice, paying no heed <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>question.</b> When I nodded he bolted for my canoe, {{grabbed my}} rifle, and ran away into the woods.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Bathalda; {{but that}} is no answer <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>question.</b> You know the ways of your people, and I do not. We have had a sharp fight with them today. What is likely to come of it?" ...|$|E
40|$|<b>My</b> thanks go <b>to</b> all the {{individuals}} who took time <b>to</b> answer <b>my</b> <b>questions</b> during interviews in the UK and Pakistan and to explain and demonstrate their mapping methodologies and outputs to me. Iâ€™m especially grateful to OPP-RTI and ASB in Pakistan. This report {{would not have been}} possible without their professional and dedicated organisation of my itinerary in Karachi and in Faisalabad and Jaranwala and their openness <b>to</b> all <b>my</b> <b>questions</b> and comprehensive explanation of their work...|$|R
5000|$|Knowing and {{understanding}} your rights as I have explained them to you, {{are you willing}} <b>to</b> answer <b>my</b> <b>questions</b> without an attorney present? ...|$|R
6000|$|In reply <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>questions</b> Dr. Fuhlrott {{writes that}} the {{occipital}} bone [...] "is {{in a state of}} perfect preservation as far as the upper semicircular line, which is a very strong ridge, linear at its extremities, but enlarging towards the middle, where it forms two ridges (bourrelets), united by a linear continuation, which is slightly depressed in the middle." ...|$|R
6000|$|She was not {{listening}} to me, I saw: she had risen from the grass and seated herself again on the stone. For only answer <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>question</b> {{she pointed to the}} west with her hand, saying: [...] "Look there, Smith." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Coppet is off," [...] said Lumley {{in reply}} <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>question,</b> [...] "to get some timber for oars, {{as well as}} birch-bark to make a canoe or two; we must also set about making a new boat some day or other." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good-night, Macumazahn, good-night. When {{you return}} from visiting the white Queen, that Great One beneath those feet I, Zikali, who am also great in my way, am but {{a grain of}} dust, come and tell me her answer <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>question.</b>|$|E
60|$|She paused, {{either for}} breath or for fresh ideas, and I took {{advantage}} of the lull in the rain of bouquets <b>to</b> repeat <b>my</b> <b>question.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "The first {{evidence}} of 'the force' came in steady tappings upon Mrs. Towne's chair. The young man said: 'This {{is my friend}} [...] "Evans,"' and thereupon I began to direct the sitting through 'Evans.' In answer <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>questions,</b> {{he said that he}} would do what he could do for us. I asked him if he would write, and he answered by tapping that he would try.|$|R
6000|$|... "No. She {{is rather}} worse than better, {{and we are}} {{distinctly}} uneasy about her to-night," [...] he said. [...] "Dr. Gilmour was here an hour ago, looking rather more owl-like than usual, but I could get no opinion out of him. In fact, the man puzzled me. He appeared dazed, and either would not listen <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>questions</b> or was incapable of understanding plain English." ...|$|R
