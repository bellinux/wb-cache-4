50|$|In this context, MOSE, {{together}} with reinforcement of the barrier island, {{has been designed}} to provide protection from tides of up to 3 m in height. MOSE will therefore effectively protect the lagoon, even if the most pessimistic hypotheses are proven true, such as a rise in sea level of at least 60 cm (recent estimates from the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) predict a rise in sea level of between 18 and 59 cm over the next 100 years).MOSE is flexible and can be operated in different ways according to the characteristics and height of the tide. Given that the gates are independent and can be operated separately, all three inlets can be closed {{in the case of an}} exceptional event, the inlets can be closed one at a time according to the winds, atmospheric pressure and height of <b>tide</b> <b>forecast,</b> or again, each inlet can be partially closed.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThrough {{analysis}} of operational evaluation factors for <b>tide</b> <b>forecasting,</b> {{the relationship between}} the evaluation factors and the weights of forecasters was examined. A <b>tide</b> <b>forecasting</b> method based on dynamic weight distribution for operational evaluation was developed, and multiple-forecaster synchronous forecasting was realized while avoiding the instability cased by only one forecaster. Weights were distributed to the forecasters according to each one's forecast precision. An evaluation criterion for the professional level of the forecasters was also built. The eligibility rates of forecast results demonstrate the skill of the forecasters and the stability of their forecasts. With the developed <b>tide</b> <b>forecasting</b> method, the precision and reasonableness of <b>tide</b> <b>forecasting</b> are improved.

40|$|Proceeding of: 8 th International Conference in Parallel Problem Solving from Nature - PPSN VIII, Birmingham, UK, September 18 - 22, 2004. The {{time series}} {{forecast}} {{is a very}} complex problem, consisting in predicting the behaviour of a data series with only the information of the previous sequence. There is many physical and artificial phenomenon that can be described by time series. The prediction of such phenomenon could be very complex. For instance, in the case of <b>tide</b> <b>forecast,</b> unusually high tides, or sea surges, result from a combination of chaotic climatic elements in conjunction with the more normal, periodic, tidal systems associated with a particular area. Too much variables influence the behaviour of the water level. Our problem is not only to find prediction rules, we also need to discard the noise and select the representative data. Our objective is to generate a set of prediction rules. There are many methods tying to achieve good predictions. In most of the cases this methods look for general rules that are able to predict the whole series. The problem is that usually the time series has local behaviours that dont allow a good level of prediction when using general rules. In this work we present a method for finding local rules able to predict only some zones of the series but achieving better level prediction. This method is based on the evolution of set of rules genetically codified, and following the Michigan approach. For evaluating the proposal, two different domains have been used: an artificial domain widely use in the bibliography (Mackey-Glass series) and a time series corresponding to a natural phenomenon, the water level in Venice Lagoon.

40|$|Whilst {{evacuation}} {{arrangements for}} the large storm tide experienced during Tropical Cyclone (TC) Yasi in North Queensland, Australia, in 2011 were successful with no deaths from this hazard, post-event assessment of the current storm tide warning system suggested that improvements are possible. Workshopping with emergency managers identified the translation of storm tide warning levels into onshore estimates of inundation, refinement of {{the timing of the}} peak surge with regards to high tide and also understanding the underlying uncertainties currently unexpressed by the deterministic forecast as potential areas for development. Here, the potential for probabilistic real-time storm <b>tide</b> inundation <b>forecasting</b> is explored via an options analysis for each component of the storm <b>tide</b> <b>forecasting</b> process: TC tracks, wind fields, hydrodynamic modeling and post-processing of outputs for use in risk assessment. We identify the high degree of uncertainty in the forecast TC track as the key factor governing the development of a probabilistic system. This uncertainty requires simulation of a large ensemble, necessitating run-time optimization of the wind field and hydrodynamic modeling processes. Taking into account the results of the options analysis, we propose a feasible real-time storm <b>tide</b> <b>forecasting</b> system.

50|$|Thanks to {{the work}} of Doodson and other {{scientists}} in Liverpool, the tide can be predicted at any location around the UK with several centimetre accuracy. Superimposed upon the ‘astronomical tide’, which is caused by the gravitational attraction of the Moon and Sun, is the ‘storm surge’ caused by strong winds and low air pressures. The major flood at Sea Palling {{and other parts of the}} north Norfolk coast in 1953 resulted from a large storm surge occurring at high tide. This disaster led to the development of the UK National Tide Gauge Network and the UK Storm <b>Tide</b> <b>Forecasting</b> System. POL led the development of computer models to predict UK storm surges several days ahead based on forecast weather information. Routine surge forecasts are now produced by the Met Office and result in Flood Warnings issued by the Environment Agency.|$|R

50|$|A Thames Barrier flood defence closure is {{triggered}} when {{a combination}} of high <b>tides</b> <b>forecast</b> in the North Sea and high river flows at the tidal limit at Teddington weir indicate that water levels would exceed 4.87 m in central London. Though Teddington marks the Normal Tidal Limit, in periods of very high fluvial flow the tidal influence {{can be seen as}} far upstream as East Molesey, location of the second lock on the Thames. Forecast sea levels {{at the mouth of the}} Thames Estuary are generated by Met Office computers and also by models run on the Thames Barrier's own forecasting and telemetry computer systems. About 9 hours before the high tide reaches the barrier a flood defence closure begins with messages to stop river traffic, close subsidiary gates and alert other river users. As well as the Thames Barrier, the smaller gates along the Thames Tideway include Barking Barrier, King George V Lock gate, Dartford Barrier and gates at Tilbury Docks and Canvey Island must also be closed. Once river navigation has been stopped and all subsidiary gates closed, then the Thames Barrier itself can be closed. The smaller gates are closed first, then the main navigable spans in succession. The gates remain closed until the tide downstream of the barrier falls to the same level as the water level upstream.|$|R
