6000|$|Besides those {{numerous}} insects which obtain protection {{through their}} {{resemblance to the}} natural objects among which they live, there are some whose disguise is not used for concealment, but as a direct means of securing their prey by attracting them within the enemy's reach. Only a few cases {{of this kind of}} coloration have yet been observed, chiefly among spiders and mantidae; but, no doubt, if attention were given to the subject in tropical countries, many more would be discovered. Mr. H.O. Forbes has described a most interesting example of this kind of simulation in Java. While pursuing a large butterfly through the jungle, he was stopped by a dense bush, on a leaf of which he observed one of the skipper butterflies sitting on a bird's dropping. [...] "I had often," [...] he says, [...] "observed small Blues at rest on similar spots on the ground, and have wondered what such a refined and beautiful family as the Lycaenidae could find to enjoy, in food apparently so incongruous for a butterfly. I approached with gentle steps, but ready net, to see if possible how the present species was engaged. It permitted me to get quite close, and even to seize it between my fingers; to my surprise, however, part of the body remained behind, adhering as I thought to the excreta. I looked closely, and finally touched with my finger the excreta to find if it were glutinous. To my delighted astonishment I found that my eyes had been most perfectly deceived, and that what seemed to be the excreta was a most artfully coloured spider, lying on its back with its feet crossed over and closely adpressed to the body." [...] Mr. Forbes then goes on to describe the exact appearance of such excreta, and how the various parts of the spider are coloured to produce the imitation, even to the liquid portion which usually runs a little down the leaf. This is exactly imitated by a portion of the <b>thin</b> <b>web</b> which the spider first spins to secure himself firmly to the leaf; thus producing, as Mr. Forbes remarks, a living bait for butterflies and other insects so artfully contrived as to deceive a pair of human eyes, even when intently examining it.[79] ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Pockets {{are widely}} {{applied in the}} design of the {{aircraft}} structural parts. For achieving aggressive weight targets, pockets are always designed by <b>thin</b> walls and <b>webs.</b> When machining a pocket, the web is created at the face of the end mill, as opposed to ribs, which are created at the periphery of the end mill. However, difficulty exists for control the thickness tolerance when machining these thin-webs.

40|$|Steel plate girders of {{bridges and}} {{industrial}} structures are usually subjected to dynamic fatigue loading. Their thin-slender webs under dynamic fatigue loading are laterally buckling and vibrating. The consequence of {{that can be}} arising and successive development of fatigue cracks along the welded connections of the <b>thin</b> <b>webs</b> with flanges and stiffeners. Therefore, the fatigue strength and life/time of thin-walled plate girders depend beside of usual material-technological and structural influences also on stability aspects. Basic knowledge about fatigue failure mechanisms of thin-walled hybrid plate girders is presented with the regard for their local stability, obtained and by theoretical an experimental analyses. The outcome of obtained results is that the fatigue consequences of <b>thin</b> <b>webs</b> vibration can be effectively reduced by appropriate reduction of their slenderness. Therefore, the empirical formula for the limitation of web slenderness has been proposed and recommended for plate girders subjected to dynamic fatigue loading...|$|R
40|$|Plate girder structure, {{which is}} {{constructed}} from welded steel plate, is well recognized. Economical design of girders and beams normally requires <b>thin</b> <b>webs.</b> But if the <b>web</b> is extremely <b>thin</b> {{the problem of}} plate buckling may arise. Possible ways to reduce this risk consist of using thicker plates, web stiffeners or strengthening the web by making it corrugation. The conventional provision of stiffeners to allow the use of <b>thin</b> <b>webs</b> has two disadvantages, i. e. high fabrication cost and a possible reduced life due to fatigue cracking that may initiate at them stiffener weld. The use of corrugated plates (Fig. 1. 1) to replace the flat stiffened plates as the web can eliminate both disadvantages. The uses of corrugated webs have been increasingly used in many diverse engineering structures from structural engineering to aerospace and marine engineering. The corrugation of the webs acts as transverse stiffeners that allows {{for the use of}} thin plates. Because of the high slenderness ratio, web stability against shear buckling is of prime importance...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to study the fatigue behavior of <b>thin</b> <b>web</b> girders. The investigation was directed primarily toward the determination of the effects of flange rigidity and vertical stiffener rigidity on the fatigue behavior of individual panels of <b>thin</b> <b>web</b> girders. A considerable amount of attention was also devoted to the initial lateral web deflections in the webs of the girders. A qualitative ana 1 ysis was made of the fatigue behavior of individual <b>thin</b> <b>web</b> girder panels with initial lateral web deflections. Two types of loading were considered: pure shear and combined shear and bending. The analysis was based on theoretical and experimental data on the post buckling behavior of girder web panels which {{have been reported in the}} literature. In the experimental part of the investigation twenty fatigue tests were conducted on scale model <b>thin</b> <b>web</b> all-welded girders. Fifteen of these tests were conducted on girders in which the only geometric variab 1 e was the size of the flanges. Nine of the fifteen tests were carried out under conditions approximating pure shear and the remaining six tests were conducted under the condition of combined shear and flexure. Five additional tests were completed on girders in which the only variable was the rigidity of the vertica 1 stiffeners. The investigation revealed the manner in which <b>thin</b> <b>web</b> girder panels fail in fatigue.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} geometric {{process planning}} in four-axis rough machining. A {{review of existing literature}} provides {{a foundation for}} process planning in machining; efficiency (tool path length) is identified as a primary concern. Emergent structures (<b>thin</b> <b>webs</b> and strings) are proposed as a new metric of process robustness. Previous research efforts are contrasted to establish motivation for improvements in these areas in four-axis rough machining. The original research is presented as a journal article. This research develops a new methodology for quickly estimating the remaining stock during a plurality of 2 y D cuts defined by their depth and orientation relative to a rotary fourth axis. Unlike existing tool path simulators, this method can be performed independently of (and thus prior to) tool path generation. The algorithms presented use polyhedral mesh surface input to create and analyze polygonal slices, which are again reconstructed into polyhedral surfaces. At the slice level, nearly all operations are Boolean in nature, allowing simple implementation. A novel heuristic for polyhedral reconstruction for this application is presented. Results are shown for sample components, showing a significant reduction in overall rough machining tool path length. The discussion of future work provides a brief discussion of how this new methodology can be applied to detecting <b>thin</b> <b>webs</b> and strings prior to tool path planning or machining. The methodology presented in this work provides a novel method of calculating remaining stock such that it can be performed during process planning, prior to committing to tool path generation...|$|R

As this mode is more complicated than the local or global buckling, analytical expressions take empirical forms and vary in between different proposals. This paper has two main objectives. The first objective is to propose a complex finite strip method for distortional buckling analysis of I-section beams with slender webs and check the suitability for such analysis by comparing its accuracy with other methods and the second objective is to propose a simple method for predicting the distortional buckling loads of I-beams. The latter objective is superior to current methods with respect to the weight of the sections...|$|R
40|$|Trapezoid {{web beam}} {{is a type}} of steel I-section in which the web is made {{corrugated}} in a trapezoidal profile form.

Trapezoid web beam is a built up section that able to support vertical loads over long spans. The higher bending capacity is achieved by increasing the depth of the section. Increasing the depth will increase the slenderness of web and hence reducing the shear buckling capacity. Ordinarily, the economic design of steel web I-beam requires <b>thin</b> <b>web.</b> To avoid shear buckling, intermediate stiffener has to be used, or alternatively, the web can be made corrugated in trapezoidal profile.
