5|$|In February 1992, European Union {{countries}} signed <b>the</b> <b>Maastricht</b> <b>Treaty</b> which {{outlined a}} three-stage plan to accelerate progress toward an Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). The first stage centered on liberalizing capital mobility and aligning macroeconomic policies between countries. The second stage established the European Monetary Institute which was ultimately dissolved {{in tandem with}} the establishment in 1998 of the European Central Bank (ECB) and European System of Central Banks. Key to <b>the</b> <b>Maastricht</b> <b>Treaty</b> was the outlining of convergence criteria that EU members would need to satisfy before being permitted to proceed. The third and final stage introduced a common currency for circulation known as the Euro, adopted by eleven of then-fifteen members of the European Union in January 1999. In doing so, they disaggregated their sovereignty in matters of monetary policy. These countries continued to circulate their national legal tenders, exchangeable for euros at fixed rates, until 2002 when the ECB began issuing official Euro coins and notes. , the EMU comprises 17 nations which have issued the Euro, and 11 non-Euro states.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of the 1997 general election, polls {{suggested}} that Eurosceptic sentiment was running high in the UK, and the question of the country's ongoing membership of the EU was a topic of regular discussion in the media. Much of this press coverage took a negative stance toward the EU, mainstream newspapers like the Daily Mail, The Telegraph and The Times promoting Eurosceptic sentiment. Such debates were influenced by the UK's recent signing of <b>the</b> <b>Maastricht</b> <b>Treaty</b> and the looming possibility that the country would adopt the euro currency.|$|E
5|$|Since reunification, Germany {{has taken}} {{a more active role}} in the European Union. Together with its European {{partners}} Germany signed <b>the</b> <b>Maastricht</b> <b>Treaty</b> in 1992, established the Eurozone in 1999, and signed the Lisbon Treaty in 2007. Germany sent a peacekeeping force to secure stability in the Balkans and sent a force of German troops to Afghanistan as part of a NATO effort to provide security in that country after the ousting of the Taliban. These deployments were controversial since Germany is bound by domestic law only to deploy troops for defence roles.|$|E

5|$|The 1992 Maastricht Treaty obliges most EU {{member states}} to adopt the euro upon meeting certain {{monetary}} and budgetary convergence criteria, although not all states have done so. The United Kingdom and Denmark negotiated exemptions, while Sweden (which joined the EU in 1995, after <b>the</b> <b>Maastricht</b> <b>Treaty</b> was signed) turned down the euro in a 2003 referendum, and has circumvented the obligation to adopt the euro by not meeting the monetary and budgetary requirements. All nations that have joined the EU since 1993 have pledged to adopt the euro in due course.|$|E
5|$|The Anglo-French {{businessman}} James Goldsmith {{announced the}} formation of the Referendum Party on 27 November 1994. Goldsmith had once been a strong supporter of the EEC but had grown disenchanted with it during the early 1990s, becoming particularly concerned that it was forming into a superstate governed by centralised institutions in Brussels. He opposed <b>the</b> <b>Maastricht</b> <b>Treaty,</b> believing that it resulted in increased German dominance in Europe. As an economic protectionist, he was also critical of the EU's signing of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, believing that global free trade would damage both the EU's economy and his own business interests.|$|E
5|$|The euro was {{established}} by the provisions in the 1992 Maastricht Treaty. To participate in the currency, member states are meant to meet strict criteria, such as a budget deficit of less than three percent of their GDP, a debt ratio of less than sixty percent of GDP (both of which were ultimately widely flouted after introduction), low inflation, and interest rates close to the EU average. In <b>the</b> <b>Maastricht</b> <b>Treaty,</b> the United Kingdom and Denmark were granted exemptions per their request from moving to the stage of monetary union {{which resulted in the}} introduction of the euro.|$|E

5|$|In 1992, {{members of}} the European Union signed an {{agreement}} known as <b>the</b> <b>Maastricht</b> <b>Treaty,</b> under which they pledged to limit their deficit spending and debt levels. Some EU member states, including Greece and Italy, were able to circumvent these rules and mask their deficit and debt levels {{through the use of}} complex currency and credit derivatives structures. The structures were designed by prominent US investment banks, who received substantial fees in return for their services and who took on little credit risk themselves thanks to special legal protections for derivatives counterparties. Financial reforms within the U.S. since the financial crisis have only served to reinforce special protections for derivatives—including greater access to government guarantees—while minimising disclosure to broader financial markets.|$|E
5|$|The Parliament {{also has}} other powers of general supervision, mainly granted by <b>the</b> <b>Maastricht</b> <b>Treaty.</b> The Parliament {{has the power}} to set up a Committee of Inquiry, for example over mad cow disease or CIA {{detention}} flights—the former {{led to the creation of}} the European veterinary agency. The Parliament can call other institutions to answer questions and if necessary to take them to court if they break EU law or treaties. Furthermore, it has powers over the appointment of the members of the Court of Auditors and the president and executive board of the European Central Bank. The ECB president is also obliged to present an annual report to the parliament.|$|E
5|$|The three {{communities}} were later merged in 1967, by the Merger Treaty, into the European Communities. The institutions were carried {{over from the}} European Economic Community (making the Commission of that community the direct ancestor of the current Commission). Under the Treaties of Rome, the Common Assembly (which renamed itself the Parliamentary Assembly, and then the European Parliament) was supposed to become elected. However this was delayed by the Council until 1979. Since then it gained more powers via successive treaties. <b>The</b> <b>Maastricht</b> <b>Treaty</b> also gave further powers to the Council by giving it {{a key role in}} the two new pillars of the EU which were based on intergovernmental principles.|$|E
40|$|The {{problems}} {{around the}} Euro are {{still far from}} being set-tled. The trouble started with the rumor around a possible Greek insolvency in early 2010 which triggered {{a series of meetings}} of the European Governments. At the end, the principles of <b>the</b> <b>Maastricht</b> <b>treaties</b> were revised in two major points: First, a joint rescue fund, called “European financial stability facility ” (EFSF), was created in order to help member states to refinance themselves at acceptable conditions. In practice this meant that the “no bail-out” principle of <b>the</b> <b>Maastricht</b> <b>treaties</b> was abandoned – at least until the scheduled termination of the program in 2013. Second, the European central bank abandoned her sacred principle of not buying state bonds and intervened in favor of Greece. At that time it had been already clear that Greece would not remain the only country having problems with refinancing its public debt; further candi...|$|R

5|$|Under the Merger Treaty of 1967, the ECSC's Special Council of Ministers and the Council of the EAEC (together {{with their}} other {{independent}} institutions) were merged into the Council of the EEC, which {{would act as}} a single Council of the European Communities. In 1993, the Council adopted the name 'Council of the European Union', following {{the establishment of the}} European Union by <b>the</b> <b>Maastricht</b> <b>Treaty.</b> That treaty strengthened the Council, with the addition of more intergovernmental elements in the three pillars system. However, {{at the same time the}} Parliament and Commission had been strengthened inside the Community pillar, curtailing the ability of the Council to act independently.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, {{members of}} the European Union signed <b>the</b> <b>Maastricht</b> <b>Treaty,</b> under which they pledged to limit their deficit {{spending}} and debt levels. However, in the early 2000s, some EU member states were failing {{to stay within the}} confines of the Maastricht criteria and turned to securitising future government revenues to reduce their debts and/or deficits, sidestepping best practice and ignoring international standards. This allowed the sovereigns to mask their deficit and debt levels through a combination of techniques, including inconsistent accounting, off-balance-sheet transactions, and the use of complex currency and credit derivatives structures. From late 2009 on, after Greece's newly elected, PASOK government stopped masking its true indebtedness and budget deficit, fears of sovereign defaults in certain European states developed in the public, and the government debt of several states was downgraded. The crisis subsequently spread to Ireland and Portugal, while raising concerns about Italy, Spain, and the European banking system, and more fundamental imbalances within the eurozone.|$|E

25|$|Most {{of these}} territories seceded before the {{implementation}} of <b>the</b> <b>Maastricht</b> <b>treaty</b> in 1993 and the following years, meaning that cooperation like the EU citizenship, the VAT union or the Eurozone did not exist, so it made less difference to be a special territory then.|$|E
