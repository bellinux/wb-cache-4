5|$|On 6 September 2012, the ECB {{announced}} to offer additional financial {{support in the}} form of some yield-lowering bond purchases (OMT), for all eurozone countries involved in a sovereign state bailout program from EFSF/ESM. A eurozone country can benefit from the program if -and for as long as- it is found to suffer from stressed bond yields at excessive levels; but only at the point of time where the country possesses/regains a complete market access -and only if the country still complies with all terms in the signed Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) agreement. Countries receiving a precautionary programme rather than a sovereign bailout will, by definition, have complete market access and thus qualify for OMT support if also suffering from stressed interest rates on its government bonds. In regards of countries receiving a sovereign bailout (Ireland, Portugal and Greece), they will on the other hand not qualify for OMT support before they have regained complete market access, which will normally only happen after having received the last scheduled bailout disbursement. Despite none OMT programmes were ready to start in September/October, the financial markets straight away took notice of the additionally planned OMT packages from ECB, and started slowly to price-in a decline of both short-term and long-term interest rates in all European countries previously suffering from stressed and elevated interest levels (as OMTs were regarded as an extra potential back-stop to counter the frozen liquidity and highly stressed rates; and just the knowledge about their potential existence in <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>near</b> <b>future</b> helped to calm the markets).|$|E

40|$|In this manuscript, we {{analyze the}} {{structural}} properties of Z= 119 superheavy nuclei {{in the mass}} range of 284 < A < 375 {{within the framework of}} deformed relativistic mean field theory (RMF) and calculate the binding energy, radii, quadrupole deformation parameter, separation energies and density profile. Further, a competition between possible decay modes such as α-decay, β-decay and spontaneous fission (SF) of the isotopic chain of Z= 119 superheavy nuclei under study is systematically analyzed within self-consistent relativistic mean field model. Moreover, our analysis confirmed that α-decay is restricted within the mass range 284 ≤ A ≤ 296 and thus being the dominant decay channel in this mass range. However, for the mass range 297 ≤ A ≤ 375 the nuclei are unable to survive fission and hence SF is the principal mode of decay for these isotopes. There is no possibility of β-decay for the considered isotopic chain. In addition, we forecasted the mode of decay ^ 284 - 296119 as one α chain from ^ 284119 and ^ 296119, two consistent α chains from ^ 285119 and ^ 295119, three consistent α chains from ^ 286119 and ^ 294119, four consistent alpha chains from ^ 287119, six consistent alpha chains from ^ 288 - 293119. Also from our analysis we inferred that for the isotopes ^ 264 - 266, 269 Bh both α decay and SF are equally competent and can decay via either of these two modes. Thus, such studies can be of great significance to <b>the</b> experimentalists in <b>very</b> <b>near</b> <b>future</b> for synthesizing Z= 119 superheavy nuclei.

It had been leased to Queens Surface Corporation before the lease was taken over by MTA Bus. Many buses under Queens Surface used compressed natural gas, and all local bus service from this depot operates using CNG provided by Trillium CNG.

The five-story {{structure}} is steel-framed with a brick exterior, with two stories for bus storage and repair shops. The facility was built to perform heavy maintenance, and served as New York City Bus' central maintenance facility until the opening of the Zerega and Grand Avenue facilities. Buses enter and exit the complex via numerous doors on Jamaica Avenue, with an additional vehicle entrance {{at the north end of}} the complex at Bushwick Avenue. The depot was built to house over 300 buses. It currently has space for around 280 buses, including two additional outdoor parking lots south of the depot: Havens Lot at Havens Place between Herkimer Street and Atlantic Avenue, and Herkimer Lot at Herkimer Street and Williams Place underneath the BMT Canarsie Line. The depot also features a paint shop, which is decommissioned and has been used to store buses at times. The north end of the depot (1720 Bushwick Avenue) is used to maintain the museum bus fleet along with Amsterdam Depot, and contains a repair shop for MTA Bus.

25|$|U.S. {{civil and}} {{military}} intelligence had, amongst them, good information suggesting additional Japanese aggression {{throughout the summer}} and fall before the attack. At the time, no reports specifically indicated an attack against Pearl Harbor. Public press reports during summer and fall, including Hawaiian newspapers, contained extensive reports on the growing tension in the Pacific. Late in November, all Pacific commands, including both the Navy and Army in Hawaii, were separately and explicitly warned war with Japan was expected in <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>near</b> <b>future,</b> and it was preferred Japan make the first hostile act. It was felt war would most probably start with attacks in the Far East: the Philippines, Indochina, Thailand, or the Russian Far East; Pearl Harbor was never mentioned as a potential target. The warnings were not specific to any area, noting only that war with Japan was expected in the near future and all commands should act accordingly. Had any of these warnings produced an active alert status in Hawaii, the attack might have been resisted more effectively, and perhaps resulted in less death and damage. On the other hand, recall of men on shore leave to the ships in harbor might have led to still more being casualties from bombs and torpedoes, or trapped in capsized ships by shut watertight doors (as the attack alert status would have required), or killed (in their obsolete aircraft) by more experienced Japanese aviators. When the attack actually arrived, Pearl Harbor was effectively unprepared: anti-aircraft weapons not manned, most ammunition locked down, anti-submarine measures not implemented (e.g., no torpedo nets in the harbor), combat air patrol not flying, available scouting aircraft not in the air at first light, Air Corps aircraft parked wingtip to wingtip to reduce sabotage risks (not ready to fly at a moment's warning), and so on.|$|E

The court considered that the legal context is a conflict [...] "of an international character (international armed conflict). Therefore, the law that applies to the armed conflict between Israel and the terrorist organizations is the international law of armed conflicts." [...] The court decided that [...] "members of the terrorist organizations are not combatants [...] They do not fulfill the conditions for combatants under international law" [...] and that [...] "they do not comply with the international laws of war." [...] They concluded that [...] "members of terrorist organizations have the status of civilians" [...] but that [...] "the protection accorded by international law to civilians does not apply at the time during which civilians take direct part in hostilities." [...] They ruled that they could not determine whether targeted killings are always legal or always illegal, but the legality must be established on a case by case basis. Their ruling stated [...] "it cannot be determined in advance that every targeted killing is prohibited according to customary international law, just as it cannot be determined in advance that every targeted killing is permissible according to customary international law. The law of targeted killing is determined in the customary international law, and the legality of each individual such act must be determined in light of it."
