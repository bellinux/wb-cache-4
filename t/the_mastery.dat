The earliest reference to meditation is in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, {{one of the oldest}} Upanishads. Chandogya Upanishad describes the five kinds of vital energies (prana). Concepts used later in many yoga traditions such as internal sound and veins (nadis) are also described in the Upanishad.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{validate}} <b>the</b> Caregiver <b>Mastery</b> Scale for {{partners of}} patients with acquired brain injury. DESIGN: The score distributions, internal consistency and convergent validity of <b>the</b> Caregiver <b>Mastery</b> Scale were determined. SUBJECTS: A total of 92 partners (53 % male, age 62 years) {{of patients with}} acquired brain injury (91 % stroke) discharged from inpatient rehabilitation (time since injury 32 months). MAIN MEASURES: Outcome measure: Caregiver Mastery Scale. Reference measures: Caregiver Strain Index, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and CarerQoL. RESULTS: <b>The</b> Caregiver <b>Mastery</b> Scale has a normal distribution, with no floor or ceiling effects. Its internal consistency is acceptable (Cronbach's alpha: 0. 75). The convergent validity analyses confirmed our hypothesis that higher scores on <b>the</b> Caregiver <b>Mastery</b> Scale correlate with less burden, lower levels of anxiety and depression and greater well-being. Furthermore, partners scoring high on <b>the</b> Caregiver <b>Mastery</b> Scale mostly scored below the clinical cut-off scores on the Caregiver Strain Index and the anxiety and depression subscales of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, whereas partners scoring low on <b>the</b> Caregiver <b>Mastery</b> Scale {{were more likely to}} score above the cut-off points. CONCLUSION: <b>The</b> Caregiver <b>Mastery</b> Scale is a valid instrument to assess <b>the</b> caregiver <b>mastery</b> of partners of patients with acquired brain injury...|$|R
