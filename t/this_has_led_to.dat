5|$|The term aiki {{does not}} readily {{appear in the}} Japanese {{language}} {{outside the scope of}} budō. <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> many possible interpretations of the word.|$|E
5|$|During some Christmases of {{the first}} decade of the 21st century, the Baby Jesus statue was often stolen from the outdoor nativity scene in Jönköping in Sweden, once thrown into the nearby lake of Vättern. <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> the nativity scene, {{resembling}} a wooden stable, being closed by nights.|$|E
5|$|In 1800 {{there were}} three red deer on the island, later {{replaced}} by goats and then by a small herd of black cattle. Subsequently the summer grazing was used for sheep by crofters from Iona, but in 1997 all livestock was removed. <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> a regeneration of the island's vegetation.|$|E
50|$|Much of Carlin's {{career has}} dealt with the {{politics}} of South Africa. <b>This</b> <b>had</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> {{a relationship with the}} former South African president, Nelson Mandela.|$|R
50|$|The earth of Verzy is poor for agriculture. Could <b>this</b> <b>have</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> a {{lineage of}} a {{distinct}} phenotype? No, because many beeches {{there are not}} dwarf beeches.|$|R
25|$|<b>This</b> <b>had</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> the {{formulation}} of Moore's second law, also called Rock's law, {{which is that the}} capital cost of a semiconductor fab also increases exponentially over time.|$|R
5|$|The {{area was}} notorious for its deep poverty, {{overcrowding}} and associated social problems. <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> the East End’s history of intense political activism and association {{with some of}} the country’s most influential social reformers.|$|E
5|$|A {{study of}} 27 Milky Way neighbors {{found that in}} all dwarf galaxies, the central mass is {{approximately}} 10 million solar masses, {{regardless of whether the}} galaxy has thousands or millions of stars. <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> the suggestion that galaxies are largely formed by dark matter, and that the minimum size may indicate a form of warm dark matter incapable of gravitational coalescence on a smaller scale.|$|E
5|$|Asser's prose {{style has}} been criticised for weak syntax, stylistic pretensions, and garbled exposition. His {{frequent}} use of archaic and unusual words gives his prose a baroque flavour that is common in Insular Latin authors of the period. He uses several words that are peculiar to Frankish Latin sources. <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> speculation that he was educated at least partly in Francia, {{but it is also}} possible that he acquired this vocabulary from Frankish scholars he associated with at court, such as Grimbald.|$|E
50|$|The Ministry of Health is {{mandated}} {{to provide a}} functioning healthcare system to benefit all citizens. <b>This</b> <b>had</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> the reforming of the entire healthcare system in the country.|$|R
50|$|It is now {{understood}} that {{the tail of the}} sperm, which contains additional mtDNA, may also enter the egg. <b>This</b> <b>had</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> increased controversy about the fate of paternal mtDNA.|$|R
50|$|Allegations of {{political}} corruption arose when pictures were found of Galician premier Alberto Núñez Feijóo vacationing with convicted smuggler Marcial Dorado. <b>This</b> <b>had</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> local belief that certain Galician crime clans have infiltrated local politics.|$|R
5|$|Carbohydrates are {{classified}} {{according to their}} glycemic index, a system for measuring how quickly a food that is eaten raises blood sugar levels, and glycemic load, which takes into account both the glycemic index {{and the amount of}} carbohydrate in the food. <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> carbohydrate counting, a method used by diabetics for planning their meals.|$|E
5|$|DNA {{nanotechnology}} {{uses the}} unique molecular recognition properties of DNA and other nucleic acids to create self-assembling branched DNA complexes with useful properties. DNA is thus {{used as a}} structural material {{rather than as a}} carrier of biological information. <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> the creation of two-dimensional periodic lattices (both tile-based and using the DNA origami method) and three-dimensional structures in the shapes of polyhedra. Nanomechanical devices and algorithmic self-assembly have also been demonstrated, and these DNA structures have been used to template the arrangement of other molecules such as gold nanoparticles and streptavidin proteins.|$|E
5|$|Great white {{pelicans}} on Dyer Island, in the Western Cape {{region of}} South Africa, were culled during the 19th century because their predation {{of the eggs}} and chicks of guano-producing seabirds was seen to threaten the livelihood of the guano collectors. More recently, such predation at South African seabird colonies has impacted on the conservation of threatened seabird populations, especially crowned cormorants, Cape cormorants and bank cormorants. <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> suggestions that pelican numbers should be controlled at vulnerable colonies.|$|E
50|$|On March 25, 2014 activists of Young Front visited an {{demonstration}} with {{a transparent}} featuring controversial personalities Stanisław Bułak-Bałachowicz, Stepan Bandera, Michał Vituška, Roman Shukhevych and Vincent Hadleŭski. <b>This</b> <b>had</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> {{excitement of the}} Russian ambassador.|$|R
50|$|In 2006 {{he accused}} {{the city of}} {{ignoring}} the aging infrastructure of the city's sewer system and that <b>this</b> <b>had</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> several raw sewage overflows due to intense rain events for which the city was sued by an environmental group.|$|R
50|$|This genus {{was named}} Mangelia by Leach and {{accepted}} by Risso in 1826. Later, some authors, such as Lovén in 1846, spelled it inadvertently as Mangilia, {{to honor the}} Italian malacologist Mangili Guiseppe (1767-1829). <b>This</b> <b>had</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> some confusion.|$|R
5|$|In the Archaic period (before 2000 BCE), {{a number}} of loanwords from Mixe–Zoquean {{languages}} seem to have entered the proto-Mayan language. <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> hypotheses that the early Maya were dominated by speakers of Mixe–Zoquean languages, possibly the Olmec. In {{the case of the}} Xincan and Lencan languages, on the other hand, Mayan languages are more often the source than the receiver of loanwords. Mayan language specialists such as Campbell believe this suggests a period of intense contact between Maya and the Lencan and Xinca people, possibly during the Classic period (250–900).|$|E
5|$|In the United States and the European Union, {{since the}} early 1990s {{regulations}} {{have been in place}} that are designed to prevent shellfish from contaminated waters entering the food chain. This has meant that there is sometimes a shortage of regulated shellfish, with consequent higher prices. <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> illegal harvesting and sale of shellfish on the black market, which can be a health hazard.|$|E
5|$|Ned is a {{genuinely}} well-meaning good-natured person {{and is one}} of the few in Springfield to whom that description applies. Firmly religious, he can be timid and something of a pushover. He is a Republican and a devout Evangelical Christian who strictly follows the Bible literally and is easily shocked when challenged on any point of dogma. <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> his frequent calls to Reverend Lovejoy, who has become increasingly frustrated with and uninterested in Flanders.|$|E
50|$|<b>This</b> <b>had</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> armed {{clashes between}} factions, both factions state {{that they are}} being betrayed by their former colleagues, or that some member of the {{opposite}} faction has ties with the cartels, this in an attempt to legitimize their actions.|$|R
25|$|<b>This</b> <b>had</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> the {{development}} of underwater treadmills to relieve stress on the animals joints whilst building strength. These have been {{a turning point in}} the rehabilitation of dogs as they can be placed in smaller areas, but offer a controlled treatment.|$|R
50|$|In 2015, NRT sales {{fell for}} the first time since 2008 while sales for e-cigarettes {{continued}} to increase at a substantial rate. <b>This</b> <b>had</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> speculation that UK smokers are trying to quit with e-cigarettes rather than traditional, pharma-backed NRT methods.|$|R
5|$|Nuclear weapons {{manufacture}} and other nuclear physics applications {{are a major}} source of artificial lithium fractionation, with the light isotope 6Li being retained by industry and military stockpiles {{to such an extent that}} it has caused slight but measurable change in the 6Li to 7Li ratios in natural sources, such as rivers. <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> unusual uncertainty in the standardized atomic weight of lithium, since this quantity depends on the natural abundance ratios of these naturally-occurring stable lithium isotopes, as they are available in commercial lithium mineral sources.|$|E
5|$|The Hammond organ {{has also}} been {{emulated}} in software. The most prominent emulator in this field has been the Native Instruments B4 series, which has been praised for its attention to detail and choice of features. Emagic (now part of Apple) has also produced a software emulation, the EVB3. <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> a Hammond organ module with all controls and features of the original instrument in the Logic Pro audio production suite.|$|E
5|$|The {{common eland}} is {{sometimes}} farmed and hunted for its meat, {{and in some}} cases can be better used than cattle because it is more suited to African climates. <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> some Southern African farmers switching from cattle to eland. Common elands are also pictured as supporters in the coat of arms of Grootfontein, Namibia.|$|E
5000|$|Advocating Britart, {{she is on}} the {{opposite}} side of the fence from the traditionally oriented critic, Brian Sewell. <b>This</b> <b>had</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> personal comments in the media.

50|$|All of Paisley's {{sewage and}} {{industrial}} effluent had been discharged untreated into the River Cart via its tributaries: the St Mirin Burn, the Lady Burn, the Sneddon Burn, the Espedair Burn, etc. By 1870 <b>this</b> <b>had</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> many complaints about smells and epidemics.|$|R
5|$|During the German {{occupation}} of Belgium in World War I, many Belgian workers {{had refused to}} work for the German administration as a form of passive resistance. <b>This</b> <b>had</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> large-scale reprisals against civilians as the occupiers had attempted to enforce their policies by armed force.|$|R
5|$|The {{species has}} a long history of use in {{traditional}} medicine in its native range, where it is employed as a treatment for a variety of ailments. <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> the investigation of its phytochemistry. Its flowers can be eaten in salads or crushed for dyemaking, and the plant has been considered for potential use in the phytoremediation of contaminated soil.|$|E
5|$|The {{work has}} {{developed}} a reputation as an essential one for aspiring violin virtuosi to conquer. <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> its becoming virtually ubiquitous in the discography of concert violinists, even including those who were only active at the very dawn of recorded sound and of whom very little recorded music exists, such as Eugène Ysaÿe. Even so, it remains technically challenging and is {{generally considered to be}} as difficult as many other famous counterparts.|$|E
5|$|There are extant liturgical vestments {{containing}} embroidered figures, {{including that}} of St. Barbara, in Lochner's style and with similar facial types. <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> some speculation whether Lochner provided the models. In addition a number of contemporary stained glass panels are similar in style, {{and there has been}} debate whether he might have been responsible for church murals; the over-life size figures of the Dombild and Virgin with the Violet indicate his ability to work on a monumental scale.|$|E
50|$|Large {{numbers of}} {{metallic}} fragments {{have been found}} in samples taken from within the crater area. Analysis has proved they were pieces from exploded ordnance such as bombs and grenades. <b>This</b> <b>had</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> the theory that wartime bombing could also be the cause of the crater.|$|R
50|$|The way {{companies}} {{hunt for}} talent is changing and <b>this</b> <b>had</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> sites that freelancers {{can sign up}} to and get to bid on jobs advertised; they are normally free to join but the agency will take between 10% and 25% of what applicants earn.|$|R

"At the inquest a few {{certainly}} {{very curious}} facts connected with Mrs. Owen's life had come <b>to</b> light, and <b>this</b> <b>had</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> the apprehension {{of a young}} man of very respectable parentage on a charge of being concerned in the tragic death of the unfortunate caretaker.|$|R
