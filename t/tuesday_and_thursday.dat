5|$|Beginning on December 11, 1945, Stafford {{hosted the}} <b>Tuesday</b> <b>and</b> <b>Thursday</b> {{broadcasts}} of NBC musical variety radio program The Chesterfield Supper Club. On April 5, 1946, the entire cast, including Stafford and Perry Como, {{participated in the}} first commercial radio broadcast from an airplane. The initial plan was to use the stand-held microphones used in studios but when these proved to be problematic, the cast switched to hand-held microphones, which because of the plane's cabin pressure became difficult to hold. Three flights were made that day; a rehearsal in the afternoon, then two in the eveningone for the initial 6:00 pm broadcast and another at 10:00 pm for the West Coast broadcast.|$|E

25|$|On weekdays of {{the first}} week of Great Lent, fasting is {{particularly}} severe, and many observe it by abstaining from all food for some period of time. According to strict observance, on the first five days (Monday through Friday) there are only two meals eaten, one on Wednesday and the other on Friday, both after the Presanctified Liturgy. Those who are unable to follow the strict observance may eat on <b>Tuesday</b> <b>and</b> <b>Thursday</b> (but not, if possible, on Monday) in the evening after Vespers, when they may take bread and water, or perhaps tea or fruit juice, but not a cooked meal. The same strict abstention is observed during Holy Week, except that a vegan meal with wine and oil is allowed on Great Thursday.|$|E
25|$|The bulk of Tyne Tees' output {{has been}} its {{regional}} programming, consisting of news, current affairs and local interest. Its longest running news programme was Northern Life, which ran from 1976 to 1992. The main news show has been rebranded several times; the current version is ITV News Tyne Tees. Until December 2008, local-interest programming was usually broadcast at 19:30 on Thursdays, which are low-profile slots due to the high-rating EastEnders being broadcast at those times on BBC One. Local non-news programming was also broadcast on early Sunday evenings and various late slots following News at Ten on <b>Tuesday</b> <b>and</b> <b>Thursday</b> nights. Such documentaries concentrate upon local history, landscape and architecture, such as the various shows by John Grundy. A monthly political programme, Around the House, continues to be produced for the Tyne Tees and Border regions.|$|E
25|$|To {{be listed}} on the first-round ballot, {{candidates}} must secure 500 signatures (often referred to as parrainages) from national or local elected officials from at least 30 different departments or overseas collectivities, {{with no more than}} a tenth of these signatories from any single department. The official signature collection period followed the publication of the Journal officiel on 25 February to 17 March. The collection period had initially been scheduled to begin on 23 February, but a visit by Prime Minister Bernard Cazeneuve to China on that date forced a delay. French prefectures mailed sponsorship forms to the 42,000 elected officials eligible to give their signature to a candidate, which must then be delivered to the Constitutional Council for validation. Unlike in previous years, a list of validated signatures was posted on <b>Tuesday</b> <b>and</b> <b>Thursday</b> of every week on the Council's website; in the past, signatories were published only after the official candidate list had been verified {{after the end of the}} collection period. The end of the signature collection period also marked the deadline for the declaration of personal assets required of prospective candidates. The final list of candidates was proclaimed on 21 March.|$|E

No move materialised, and he continued to progress through the youth system at Home Park, and was offered a professional contract {{at the age of}} 17 by manager Tony Pulis in February 2006. During his time as an apprentice, Laird lived in a hotel [...] "just for apprentices" [...] with Luke Summerfield, Reuben Reid, and Chris Zebroski, and described the experience as a [...] "great way to grow into football".|$|E
500|$|For {{its first}} fifty years, Kirkpatrick Chapel {{was used for}} daily worship {{services}} by the Rutgers College student body. By 1926, the increasing size {{of the student body}} had forced Rutgers to stop daily mandatory chapel services and hold services for underclassmen on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday; and for upperclassman on <b>Tuesday</b> <b>and</b> <b>Thursday.</b> Within a few years, continued growth in the student body reduced that schedule to each class meeting in chapel only one day per week. [...] Sunday chapel services were attended by all students who chose to remain on campus for the weekend. Kirkpatrick Chapel is one of two college chapels on Rutgers' New Brunswick campuses. [...] The other, Voorhees Chapel, was built in 1925 after a donation from Elizabeth Rodman Voorhees to the New Jersey College for Women, later Douglass College, which was later merged into Rutgers.|$|E
