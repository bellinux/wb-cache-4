40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to provide some {{information}} about the hydraulic performance of mattresses protecting slopes of low head hydraulic structures. The flow resistance as well as stability of slope were investigated. The experimental programme was conducted in the Chilworth Hydraulics Laboratory, Department of Civil Engineering. Two models were constructed and tested. The inpermeable model (first) had a slope of 1 : 7 (V;H) with mattress dimensions of 320 x 350 mm and a height of 40 mm. The permeable model (second) was built with the same slope except that <b>the</b> <b>mattresses</b> were protecting a sand core. The flow resistance of <b>the</b> <b>mattresses</b> was studied which included Manning's roughness coefficient, Chezy's resistance factor and Darcy-Weisbach friction factor. Velocity distribution above <b>the</b> <b>mattresses</b> was evaluated and found well describing the flow. The stability of <b>the</b> <b>mattresses</b> and their ability to resist failure when exposed to higher discharges were also examined and found stable under the discharges tried. Detailed measurement of pressures were conducted in the permeable model in order to study their effects on the stability of the mattresses; such as; pressure distribution above <b>the</b> <b>mattresses,</b> uplift pressures and seepage forces. Shear stresses due to seepage forces were found very small and could be neglected. Comparison with the results of smooth board simulating a reinforced concrete structure, favours <b>the</b> <b>mattresses</b> as a means to control erosion and dissipate energy efficiently. Measures were suggested in terms of installation to reduce the drag and uplift forces. A design procedure for a slope protected by mattresses was set up and followed by a numerical example implementing the results obtained in this study. —<br/...|$|R

5|$|The {{funds from}} the robbery were {{originally}} kept {{at the house of}} Stalin's friends in Tiflis, Mikha and Maro Bochoridze. The money was sewn into a mattress so that it could be moved and stored easily without arousing suspicion. <b>The</b> <b>mattress</b> was moved to another safe house, then later put on the director's couch at the Tiflis Meteorological Observatory, possibly because Stalin had worked there. Some sources claim that Stalin himself helped put the money in the observatory. The director stated that he never knew that the stolen money had been stored under his roof.|$|E
5|$|Myles' Mary Collins {{prosthetic}} {{took six}} hours to accomplish, and the shot where she morphs into the younger Lady Helen took seven hours to complete because it required three stages of make-up. Her first {{performance at the}} beheading scene was met with applause by the extras; Head requested that he redo {{his part of the}} scene because he felt that it was not good enough. Gaius' fall from the balcony was done by a stuntman and filmed with a high-speed camera. <b>The</b> <b>mattress</b> that Merlin magically moves across the floor was achieved with rigging it up to hidden wires and pulleys under the set. The knives Arthur throws were actually shot out of a nitrogen gun; James did throw them in a separate shot, but against a cloth that he still missed. Fake fruit was made for the stocks scene, but it was deemed too fake-looking and was replaced with real tomatoes. The mace fight was originally filmed with plastic maces, but they were not believable as they did not have enough weight. The scene was then shot with real steel maces; {{it was one of the}} most complex and hardest scenes to execute. The climax, where the guests all fall asleep and are covered by cobwebs, took many days to complete. The chandelier falling was also considered difficult.|$|E
5|$|As {{the gang}} exited the {{property}} and made to escape up the cul-de-sac, other police intervened. Sergeant Charles Tucker from Bishopsgate police station was hit twice, once in the hip and once in the heart by Peters: he died instantly. Choate grabbed Gardstein and wrestled for his gun, but the Russian managed to shoot him in the leg. Other members of the gang ran to Gardstein's assistance, shooting Choate twelve times in the process, but Gardstein was also wounded; as the policeman collapsed, Gardstein was carried away by his accomplices, who included Peters. As these men, aided by an unknown woman, made their escape with Gardstein they were accosted by Isaac Levy, a passer-by, whom they threatened at pistol-point. He was the only witness to the escape {{who was able to}} provide firm details; other witnesses confirmed they saw a group of three men and a woman, and thought one of the men was drunk as he was being helped by his friends. The group, which included Peters, went to Svaars' and Peter the Painter's lodgings at 59 Grove Street (now Goldring Street), off Commercial Road, where Gardstein was tended by two of the gang's associates, Luba Milstein (Svaars' mistress) and Sara Trassjonsky. As they left Gardstein on the bed, Peters left his Dreyse pistol under <b>the</b> <b>mattress,</b> either to make it seem the wounded man {{was the one who had}} killed Tucker, or to enable him to defend himself against a possible arrest.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{describe}} the opinions of ambulance personnel regarding differences between using a heated mattress and a standard ambulance mattress. This study was an intervention study with pre- and post-evaluation. Evaluations of the opinions of personnel regarding <b>the</b> standard unheated <b>mattress</b> were conducted initially. After the intervention with new heated mattresses, follow-up evaluations were conducted. Ambulance personnel (n= 64) from an ambulance station in northern Sweden took part in the study, which ran from October 2014 until February 2016. There were differences in opinions regarding <b>the</b> standard unheated <b>mattress</b> and <b>the</b> new heated <b>mattress.</b> <b>The</b> evaluation of the proxy ratings by the personnel showed that <b>the</b> heated <b>mattress</b> was warmer than <b>the</b> standard <b>mattress,</b> more pleasant to lie on and that patients were happier and more relaxed than when <b>the</b> standard <b>mattress</b> was used. <b>The</b> ambulance personnel in this study rated the experience of working with <b>the</b> heated <b>mattress</b> as very positive and proxy rated that it had a good effect on patient comfort. A heated mattress can be recommended for patients in ambulance care, even if more research is needed to receive sufficient evidence...|$|R

25|$|From then on, {{whenever}} she ran short of money (which generally happened {{every three or}} four years), she went on tour, performing both her classics and new plays. In 1888, she toured Italy, Egypt, Turkey, Sweden, Norway, and Russia. She returned to Paris in early 1889 with an enormous owl given to her by the Grand Duke Alexis Alexandrovich, the brother of the Czar. Her 1891–92 tour was her most extensive, including much of Europe, Russia, North and South America, Australia, New Zealand, Hawaii, and Samoa. Her personal luggage consisted of 45 costume crates for her 15 different productions, and 75 crates for her off-stage clothing, including her 250 pairs of shoes. She carried a trunk for her perfumes, cosmetics and makeup, and another for her sheets and tablecloths and her five pillows. After the tour, she brought back a trunk filled with 3,500,000 francs, but she also suffered a painful injury to her knee when she leaped off the parapet of the Castello Sant' Angelo in La Tosca. <b>The</b> <b>mattress</b> on which she was supposed to land was misplaced, and she landed on the boards.|$|E
25|$|Phillips {{was arrested}} {{that day at}} his school. He was held in maximum {{security}} {{as he made his}} first court appearance. It was determined that Clifton's cause of death was due to stabbing and clubbing with a baseball bat. Phillips claimed the event happened one afternoon when he was home alone, Maddie came to his house asking him to come outside and play baseball, Phillips agreed even though he was not allowed to have friends over while his parents were not home. As the two were playing baseball, Maddie threw the ball at him and he hit it, which caused the ball to strike the 8-year-old's eye, causing her to bleed, leading Clifton to cry and scream. Phillips panicked, fearing the reaction that his father would give when he got home and saw the aftermath. Phillips proceeded to drag Clifton into his home and then into his room and strangle her with a phone cord for approximately 15 minutes. Soon after, he hit her again with the baseball bat and stashed her under his bed, not long after Josh's father entered the house, Phillips went to interact with his father for a short moment and then went back to his room and found that Clifton was still alive moaning under his bed, he took off <b>the</b> <b>mattress</b> and stabbed her 11 times, killing the 8-year-old.|$|E

25|$|Bernhardt {{made her}} first American Farewell Tour in 1905–1906, {{the first of}} four {{farewell}} tours she made to the U.S., Canada, and Latin America, with her new managers, the Shubert brothers. She attracted controversy and press attention when, during her 1905 visit to Montreal, the Roman Catholic bishop encouraged his followers to throw eggs at Bernhardt, because she portrayed prostitutes as sympathetic characters. The U.S. portion of the tour was complicated due to the Shuberts' competition with the powerful syndicate of theater owners which controlled nearly all the major theaters and opera houses in the United States. The syndicate did not allow outside producers to use their stages. As a result, in Texas and Kansas City, Bernhardt and her company performed under an enormous circus tent, seating 4,500 spectators, and in skating rinks in Atlanta, Savannah, Tampa, and other cities. Her private train took her to Knoxville, Dallas, Denver, Tampa, Chattanooga, and Salt Lake City, then on to the West Coast. She could not play in San Francisco because of the recent 1906 San Francisco earthquake, but she performed across the bay in the Greek Theater at the University of California at Berkeley, and gave a recital, titled A Christmas Night during the Terror, for inmates at San Quentin penitentiary. Her tour continued into South America, where it was marred by a more serious event: at the conclusion of La Tosca in Rio de Janeiro, she leaped, as always, from the wall of the fortress to plunge to her death in the Tiber. This time, however, <b>the</b> <b>mattress</b> on which she was supposed to land had been positioned incorrectly. She landed on her right knee, which had already been damaged in earlier tours. She fainted and was taken from the theater on a stretcher, but refused to be treated in a local hospital. She later sailed the few hours by ship from Rio to New York. When she arrived, her leg had swollen, and she was immobilized in her hotel for 15 days before returning to France.|$|E
