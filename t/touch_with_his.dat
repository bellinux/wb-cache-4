5|$|During {{the course}} of the {{execution}} of a commission for the Hospital de Tavera, El Greco fell seriously ill, and a month later, on 7 April 1614, he died. A few days earlier, on 31 March, he had directed that his son should have the power to make his will. Two Greeks, friends of the painter, witnessed this last will and testament (El Greco never lost <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> Greek origins). He was buried in the Church of Santo Domingo el Antiguo, aged 73.|$|E
5|$|Salant later {{pulled the}} episode from the {{schedule}} and assigned producer Harry Morgan to re-edit it. According to Wallace, Salant found the piece sensationalistic; however, C. A. Tripp, {{a psychologist who}} had put CBS in <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> patient Larson, claimed that Salant felt the piece was pro-homosexuality. Morgan scrapped all but about 10 minutes of Peters' final cut. CBS felt that the self-accepting gay men made too favorable of an impression, so Morgan edited two of the interviews to make the men seem unhappier. According to Wallace, no sponsor would buy time during the episode because of the taboo nature of the subject matter. Commercial spots were filled by public service announcements for the Peace Corps and the Internal Revenue Service.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after his}} {{graduation}} in 1968, Kikai worked {{for two years}} as a truck driver and for two in a shipyard. Meanwhile, he stayed in <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> philosophy professor from his university days, Sadayoshi Fukuda, whose interests extended to writing a regular column for the magazine Camera Mainichi; he introduced Kikai to its editor, Shōji Yamagishi, who showed him photographs by Diane Arbus that made {{a great impact on}} Kikai. Kikai started to take photographs in 1969. At that time (when somebody fresh out of university could expect to earn ¥40,000 per month), a Hasselblad SLR camera normally cost ¥600,000; Kikai heard of an opportunity to buy one for ¥320,000 and mentioned this to Fukuda, who immediately lent him the money, with no interest, and no date or pressure for repayment. (The loan was eventually repaid.) This Hasselblad 500CM, with its 80mm lens, is what Kikai has used for his portraits ever since.|$|E

5|$|As a cosmopolitan, mercantile city Trieste was a {{probable}} hub of illicit trade, and Francesco {{was forced to}} leave after he killed Josephus Steffani on July 31, 1778. Although Steffani's death is commonly attributed to a duel, given their acquaintanceship (both worked at a criminal court) it may have been related to illegal activity. Francesco's name and those of four sailors soon became linked to the murder. Convicted in absentia, the fugitive remained in <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> family. Francesco went to Barcelona, reportedly learning Spanish there. By 1784 he had settled in Cabo Rojo, Puerto Rico, a harbor town in the municipality of San Germán, where he was accepted by the local aristocracy with the Spanish honorific Don ("of noble origin"). Francesco's name was Hispanicized to Francisco Cofresí, which was easier for his neighbors to pronounce. Since he was linked to illegal commerce in his homeland, he probably relocated to Cabo Rojo for strategic reasons; its harbor was far from San Juan, the capital. Francisco soon met María Germana Ramírez de Arellano, and they married. His wife was born to Clemente Ramírez de Arellano y del Toro, a noble and first cousin of town founder Nicolás Ramírez de Arellano. Her family, descended from the aristocracy of Navarre, owned a significant amount of land in Cabo Rojo. After their marriage the couple settled in El Tujao (or El Tujado), near the coast. Francisco's father Giovanni died in 1789, and a petition pardoning him for Steffani's murder a decade before was granted two years later (enabling him to return to Trieste). However, no evidence exists that Francisco ever returned to the city.|$|E

25|$|Although Nolde gained {{tremendous}} wealth, {{there is}} evidence that he never lost <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> working class roots.

Gabriel himself was awarded the style of Grand Duke by Kirill's son Vladimir Kirillovich on 15 May 1939. He was the only Romanov prince to be elevated to this style.|$|E
25|$|Dane's first {{marriage}} was to Carla Dagmar Hagen. The couple married 10 September 1910 at Saint Paul’s Church in Copenhagen. Dane's only living {{children were born}} during this union; son Ejlert Carl, in 1911 and daughter Ingeborg Helene in 1912. When Dane immigrated to the US, in 1916, he intended to send for his family later. However, {{by the time his}} career became successful, Dane had begun to lose <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> family. Carla no longer wanted to join him, as she was suffering from ill health. The pair separated in 1918 and divorced in 1919.|$|E

25|$|During {{the bitter}} contest between Mayor McClellan and Tammany Hall leader Charles Francis Murphy, which came near to disrupting Tammany Hall, Hayes {{managed to keep}} good {{relations}} with both political bosses. Due to his lucrative political offices and skilful investments he made {{a good deal of}} money. The revolt against his leadership in 1910 by Lazarus and Cottilo was {{based on the belief that}} Hayes had grown so well-to-do that he had lost <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> constituency in the poor district. They accused him of having a butler and of being addicted to the game of golf.|$|E
25|$|The {{mission of}} the 1st Aero Squadron during the Punitive Expedition was {{primarily}} one of communications and observation, and during {{the first phase of}} the Punitive Expedition the 1st Aero Squadron was of considerable help in enabling Pershing to keep in <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> thinly spread, fast-moving troopers. The squadron also performed several reconnaissance missions, and although these failed to locate enemy forces, that information in itself was important for the commander to know. The second phase of the Punitive Expedition was probably most important for the squadron, because the officers and men gained experience and knowledge by experimenting with a variety of airplanes and aviation equipment.|$|E
25|$|Although Alexander was {{initially}} {{thought to be}} vulnerable to a primary challenge from the right, he worked to avoid this and ultimately did not face a high-profile challenger. He declared his intention to run early, quickly won the endorsement of Governor Bill Haslam, every living former Tennessee Republican Party Chairman and the state's entire Republican congressional delegation (except scandal-hit Scott DesJarlais). He also raised {{a large amount of}} money and worked to avoid the mistakes of ousted Senators Bob Bennett and Richard Lugar by trying to stay in <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> constituents, especially in East Tennessee. Moreover, out-of-state conservative organizations such as the Senate Conservatives Fund made little effort to defeat Alexander.|$|E

Even in his eighties he continued the supervision of his stations, and he died at Mackay, Queensland, on 13 September 1911, when returning from a visit to one of them. He left a widow, five sons, and five daughters.|$|E
25|$|At the 1951 general election, Johnson {{found his}} Labour {{opponent}} was his friend Lewis Cohen. He increased his majority to over 5,000.

Johnson claimed that the flies were advancing on London and urged the use of troops with powerful flame-throwers.

25|$|Between 1526 and 1528, Leland {{proceeded}} to Paris, studying {{along with many}} fellow expatriates, both English and German. His original plan to study in Italy, too, never succeeded. Leland honed his skills at composing Latin poetry and sought the acquaintance of humanist scholars whom he much admired, such as Guillaume Budé and Jacques Lefèvre d'Étaples. A scholar of particular importance for Leland was François Dubois (Silvius), professor at the Collège de Tournai, who {{had a profound effect}} on his poetic as well as antiquarian interests. While in France, Leland kept in <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> friends and sponsors in England, probably including Thomas Wolsey (d. 1530), Cardinal and Lord Chancellor, who made him rector at Laverstoke, Hampshire.|$|E
