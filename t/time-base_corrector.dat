50|$|The Toaster {{hardware}} requires {{very stable}} input signals, and therefore {{is often used}} along with a separate video sync <b>time-base</b> <b>corrector</b> to stabilize the video sources. Third-party low-cost time-base correctors (TBCs) specifically designed {{to work with the}} Toaster quickly came to market, most of which were designed as standard ISA bus cards, taking advantage of the typically unused Bridgeboard slots. The cards do not use the Bridgeboard to communicate, but simply as a convenient power supply and physical location.|$|E
5000|$|Copying {{video from}} one VCR to another VCR {{displayed}} compromised playback reliability, and exponential levels of head-switching noise, chroma smearing and noise, compounded with every generation. These technical challenges motivated videotape editors and engineers to plan work around minimising generational degradation. Use of a <b>time-base</b> <b>corrector</b> (TBC) or [...] "dub" [...] cable were methods of minimising multi-generational quality loss. The TBC regenerates the sync tip {{portion of the}} video signal, improving playback reliability. The dub, demodulated (or [...] "demod") cable was a multi-conductor cable that circumvented a portion of video circuitry, minimising amplification noise.|$|E
50|$|Drivers for single-frame video {{recorders}} allow users {{to save on}} tape the 3D animations created on the Amiga using Ampex and Betacam devices. Also available are <b>time-base</b> <b>correctors</b> (TBCs), a family of devices correcting timing errors; one was the Personal TBC series.|$|R
