5|$|Due to the {{numerous}} road disconnections <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> {{place as a}} result of the Welland Bypass, a new highway was proposed to link Welland with Port Colborne.|$|E
5|$|In June 2013, Maloney {{voted against}} the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act. The purpose of the bill is to ban abortions <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> place 20 or more weeks after fertilization.|$|E
5|$|On October 22, 2016, the University of Tasmania {{bought the}} naming {{rights to the}} stadium for a five-year {{contract}} <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> effect on January 1 as the university campus would sit next to York Park, bringing an end to a 12-year partnership with Aurora Energy.|$|E
2500|$|Sasseville flew his {{aircraft}} {{alongside the}} aircraft of Lt. Penney. They agreed <b>that</b> he <b>would</b> <b>take</b> out {{the cockpit and}} <b>that</b> she <b>would</b> <b>take</b> the tail. Later, Sasseville explained: [...] "We don’t train to bring down airliners. If you just hit the engine, it could still glide and you could guide it to a target." ...|$|R

5|$|Although the {{resolution}} {{was not as}} strong as Mason had liked—he wanted Virginia to threaten to cut off tobacco—Mason worked in the following years for non-importation. The repeal of most of the Townshend duties (excepting that on tea) made his task more difficult. In March 1773, his wife Ann died of illness contracted after another pregnancy. Mason was the sole parent to nine children, and his commitments made him even more reluctant to accept political office <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> him from Gunston Hall.|$|E
5|$|At Paramount, {{the crew}} filmed all the scenes <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> place on soundstages, {{including}} the Enterprise and Bird-of-Prey sets, the Paradise City interiors, and the campfire location. Production was smoother on set, {{and the crew}} shot scenes ahead of schedule. The crew fabricated a stand-in set for the God planet location, where additional scenes were filmed to combine with the location footage. Spock's catching of Kirk as the captain falls off El Capitan was filmed against a set that replicated the forest floor and was rotated ninety degrees.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, by 1795, {{the army}} had already made itself odious, by both rumor and action, {{throughout}} France through its dependence upon the countryside of material support and its general lawlessness and undisciplined behavior. After April 1796, the military was paid in metallic value, not the worthless paper, but pay was still well in arrears. The French Directory believed that war should pay for itself and did not budget to pay, feed, and equip its troops. Thus, a campaign <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> the army out of France became increasingly urgent for both budgetary and internal security reasons.|$|E

5|$|An {{alternative}} design {{completed by}} McDonnell Aircraft in 1965 is usually {{considered part of}} Project Isinglass, however some documents refer to the aircraft as having been codenamed Project Rheinberry. McDonnell's proposed boost-glide aircraft, submitted to the CIA independently of the Convair Isinglass proposals, featured a small, manned, rocket-powered craft with a high lift-to-drag ratio that would be air-launched by a B-52 bomber while flying over the Atlantic Ocean. The aircraft would ignite its rocket engine and adopt a trajectory <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> it over the Soviet Union at speeds of Mach 20 and {{at an altitude of}} over , before descending over the Pacific Ocean to a landing at Groom Lake, Nevada, as a glider, landing on the lake bed using a skid landing gear.|$|E
5|$|By {{the start}} of the Second World War in 1939, around 250,000 of Germany's 437,000 Jews had emigrated to the United States, Palestine, Great Britain, and other countries. By 1938 it was {{becoming}} almost impossible for potential Jewish emigrants to find a country <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> them. After the 1936–39 Arab revolt, the British were disinclined to accept any more Jews into Palestine for fear it would further destabilise the region. Nationalistic and xenophobic people in other countries pressured their governments not to accept waves of Jewish immigrants, especially poverty-stricken ones. The Madagascar Plan, a proposed mass deportation of European Jews to Madagascar, proved to be impossible to carry out. Starting in mid-1941, the German government started mass exterminations of the Jews of Europe. The total number of Jews murdered during the resulting Holocaust is estimated at 5.5 to 6 million people. Estimates of the death toll of Romani people in the Porajmos range from 150,000 to 1,500,000.|$|E
5|$|Development of {{the fourth}} Silent Hill game by Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo's {{development}} group Team Silent began shortly {{after the release of}} Silent Hill 2 and alongside Silent Hill 3, with the intentions of creating a new style of game <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> the series in a different direction than the previous games. Despite what has been popularized around the Internet, Silent Hill 4 was always meant to be connected to Silent Hill and not an unrelated separate horror game that later became a Silent Hill title, although different gameplay mechanics and change were intended. News of the game's development was made public by October 2003, and official announcements by Konami followed at Gamers' Day 2004. The game was produced by the series' recurring sound designer and composer Akira Yamaoka. Its working title, prior to its incorporation into the rest of the series, was simply Room 302.|$|E

50|$|Before the Mahabharata war began, Lord Krishna {{asked all}} the Pandavas {{how many days}} they <b>would</b> <b>take</b> to finish Mahabharata war alone. Bhishma {{answered}} <b>that</b> he <b>would</b> <b>take</b> 20 days to finish the war. Dronacharya replied <b>that</b> it <b>would</b> <b>take</b> him 25 days. When Karna was asked, he said he <b>would</b> <b>take</b> 24 days. Arjuna told Krishna it <b>would</b> <b>take</b> 28 days for him to complete the battle by himself. In this manner, Lord Krishna asked each warrior and received an answer.|$|R
50|$|In 2006, the {{building}} was still incomplete, with estimates <b>that</b> completion <b>would</b> <b>take</b> another 10 years.|$|R
5|$|During {{his term}} as praetor in the Iberian Peninsula (modern Portugal and Spain), Pompey's {{contemporary}} Julius Caesar defeated two local tribes in battle. After his term as consul in 59 BC, {{he was appointed}} to a five-year term as the proconsular Governor of Cisalpine Gaul (part of current northern Italy), Transalpine Gaul (current southern France) and Illyria (part of the modern Balkans). Not content with an idle governorship, Caesar strove to find reason to invade Gaul (modern France and Belgium), which would give him the dramatic military success he sought. When two local tribes began to migrate on a route <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> them near (not into) the Roman province of Transalpine Gaul, Caesar had the barely sufficient excuse he needed for his Gallic Wars, fought between 58 BC and 49 BC.|$|E
5|$|Early in the storm's development, {{forecasting}} Erika's {{motion was}} difficult, with a persistent leftward bias in official forecasts. In response to Erika's threat, {{the government of}} Saint Martin first issued a tropical storm warning late on September 4. The next day, the respective governments of Antigua, Montserrat, Barbuda, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Anguilla, Dominica, Guadeloupe, and Saint Barthélemy issued tropical storm warnings for their islands. When Erika's motion resulted in a path <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> it closer to the islands, all of the aforementioned islands excluding Guadeloupe upgraded the tropical storm warning to a hurricane warning. In addition, a hurricane watch was issued for the British and United States Virgin Islands, as well as Puerto Rico. In public advisories, the National Hurricane Center stated tropical storm conditions {{were likely to be}} experienced in the Azores. Early forecasts anticipated a threat to the island of Bermuda.|$|E
5|$|George's mother, the Electress Sophia, died on 28 May 1714 {{at the age}} of 83. She had {{collapsed}} in the gardens at Herrenhausen after rushing to shelter from a shower of rain. George was now Queen Anne's direct heir. He swiftly revised the membership of the Regency Council <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> power after Anne's death, as it was known that Anne's health was failing and politicians in Britain were jostling for power. She suffered a stroke, which left her unable to speak, and died on 1 August 1714. The list of regents was opened, the members sworn in, and George was proclaimed King of Great Britain and Ireland. Partly due to contrary winds, which kept him in The Hague awaiting passage, he did not arrive in Britain until 18 September. George was crowned at Westminster Abbey on 20 October. His coronation was accompanied by rioting in over twenty towns in England.|$|E

50|$|On Dec. 23, 2014, the Atlanta Silverbacks, {{a team in}} the second-tier North American Soccer league, {{announced}} <b>that</b> Smith <b>would</b> <b>take</b> over as the team's {{head coach}} for the 2015 season. The announcement came only weeks after the league announced <b>that</b> it <b>would</b> <b>take</b> over the ownership of the team {{to prevent it from}} folding when the previous owners could not find buyers for the team.|$|R
5|$|In 1856, while Tchaikovsky {{was still}} at the School of Jurisprudence and Anton Rubinstein lobbied aristocrats to form the RMS, critic Vladimir Stasov and an 18-year-old pianist, Mily Balakirev, met and agreed upon a {{nationalist}} agenda for Russian music, one <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> the operas of Mikhail Glinka as a model and incorporate elements from folk music, reject traditional Western practices and use exotic harmonic devices such as the whole tone and octatonic scales. They saw Western-style conservatories as unnecessary and antipathetic to fostering native talent. Eventually, Balakirev, César Cui, Modest Mussorgsky, Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov and Alexander Borodin {{became known as the}} moguchaya kuchka, translated into English as the Mighty Handful or The Five. Rubinstein criticized their emphasis on amateur efforts in musical composition; Balakirev and later Mussorgsky attacked Rubinstein for his musical conservatism and his belief in professional music training. Tchaikovsky and his fellow conservatory students were caught in the middle.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of this failure, the Belgians were asked to fall back to the Yser river and protect the Allied left flank and rear areas. The King's aide, General Overstraten said that such a move could not be made and {{would lead to the}} Belgian Army disintegrating. Another plan for further offensives was suggested. The French requested the Belgians withdraw to the Leie and the British to the French frontier between Maulde and Halluin, the Belgians were then to extend their front to free further parts of the BEF for the attack. The French 1st Army would relieve two more divisions on the right flank. Leopold was reluctant to undertake such a move because it would abandon all but a small portion of Belgium. The Belgian Army was exhausted and it was an enormous technical task <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> too long to complete.|$|E
5|$|The {{accident}} <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> {{the life}} of Samuel Collyer came in July 1884. While responding to the fire alarm, hose carriage number one struck an upright stone post on the corner on Mineral Spring and Lonsdale Avenue and tipped over. All six firefighters were injured in the accident, those less seriously were on the step and seat of the carriage, but Collyer who rode on the reel was crushed underneath. Collyer sustained a punctured lung and broken ribs, but managed to survive for almost three weeks before succumbing to his injuries. Contemporary accounts state that the funeral service and procession were the most elaborate of any in the town's history. Collyer's home, known as the Potter-Collyer House, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.|$|E

5|$|The entire freeway was {{designated}} {{as part of}} Interstate 80 in the late 1950s. However, two bypasses were planned — a realignment of Route 6 <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> I-80 over a new bridge and around {{the south side of}} downtown, and a northern bypass of the entire city (I-880). Since the southerly bypass had not been completed in time for the 1964 renumbering, the route over the Tower Bridge — and along downtown streets — became Route 80, but US 99W signage remained (initially following Capitol Mall to near the State Capitol, later turning south onto 3rd and 5th Streets east of the bridge) until the late 1960s, before I-5 had finished replacing old US 99W north of Woodland.|$|E
5|$|The family then {{initiated}} {{a long journey}} in exile <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> them first to Mexico, then to Canada, where they went to pick up Arabella (the Árbenzs' oldest daughter), and then to Switzerland via the Netherlands and Paris. They hoped to obtain citizenship in Switzerland based on Árbenz's Swiss heritage. However, the former president {{did not wish to}} renounce his Guatemalan nationality, as he felt that such gesture would have marked the end of his political career. Árbenz and his family were the victims of a CIA-orchestrated and intense defamation campaign that lasted from 1954 to 1960. A close friend of Árbenz, Carlos Manuel Pellecer, {{turned out to be a}} spy working for the CIA.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} February, {{the warring}} parties reached a compromise. Under its terms, Modell {{would be allowed}} to take his personnel to Baltimore, but would leave Cleveland the Browns' colors, logos and heritage for a reactivated Browns franchise <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> the field no later than 1999. The $175 million earmarked for stadium improvements was to be used instead build a new stadium, with up to $48 million of additional financial assistance from the NFL. Further, Modell was ordered to pay Cleveland $9.3 million to compensate for lost revenues and taxes during the Browns' three years of inactivity, plus up to $2.25 million of the city's legal fees. As a result of the deal Modell's team was technically an expansion franchise, called the Baltimore Ravens.|$|E
