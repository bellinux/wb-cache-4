There, he systematically besieged and took the cities of Dardanus, Abydos, Percote, Lampsacus and Paesus, each in a single day according to Herodotus. However, when he heard that the Carians were revolting, he moved his army southwards to attempt to crush this new rebellion.

5|$|Dinosaurs are {{a diverse}} group of {{reptiles}} of the clade Dinosauria that first appeared during the Triassic period. Although the exact origin and <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> evolution of dinosaurs is the subject of active research, the current scientific consensus places their origin between 231 and 243 million years ago. They became the dominant terrestrial vertebrates after the Triassic–Jurassic extinction event 201 million years ago. Their dominance continued through the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods and ended when the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event led to the extinction of most dinosaur groups 66 million years ago.|$|E

5|$|Galileo {{was able}} to develop a method of {{determining}} longitude based on the <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> orbits of the Galilean moons. The times of the eclipses of the moons could be precisely calculated in advance, and compared with local observations on land or on ship to determine the local time and hence longitude. The main problem with the technique {{was that it was}} difficult to observe the Galilean moons through a telescope on a moving ship; a problem that Galileo tried to solve with the invention of the celatone. The method was used by Cassini and Picard to re-map France.|$|E
5|$|Golden jackals are monogamous {{and will}} remain with the one partner until death. Female jackals have only one {{breeding}} cycle each year. Breeding occurs from October to March in Israel and from February to March in India, Turkmenistan, Bulgaria, and Transcaucasia, with the mating period lasting up to 26–28 days. Females undergoing their first estrus are often pursued by several males that may quarrel among themselves. Mating results in a copulatory tie that lasts for several minutes, as it does with all other canids. Gestation lasts 63 days, and the <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> births coincides with the annual abundance of food.|$|E
5|$|Hogg's mother Prudentia died in 1839. As a {{condition}} of his father's will, upon {{the death of his}} mother, Thomas Jefferson Hogg could purchase his brother's share of Norton House. He decided not to, because of the potential cost of maintaining the house and the hostility Jane could face there. Instead, he allowed his brother to buy his interest in the house, a decision that led to conflict between the two brothers regarding the price and <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sale. They eventually worked out the details, and their relationship became friendlier once the sale was completed.|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} an energy harvesting transmitter sending status updates regarding a physical phenomenon it observes to a receiver. Different {{from the existing}} literature, we consider a scenario where the status updates carry information about an independent message. The transmitter encodes this message into <b>the</b> <b>timings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> status updates. The receiver needs to extract this encoded information, as well as update <b>the</b> status <b>of</b> <b>the</b> observed phenomenon. <b>The</b> <b>timings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> status updates, therefore, determine both <b>the</b> age <b>of</b> information (AoI) and the message rate (rate).

In 1975, Isaac Asimov noted that the <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Moon's orbit is in tandem with the Earth's own orbit around the Sun—looking down on the ecliptic, the Moon never actually loops back on itself, and in essence it orbits the Sun in its own right.|$|E
5|$|Polacanthids {{are known}} from pre-Aptian fauna from both Europe and North America. The <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{appearance}} of nodosaurids on both continents indicates {{the origins of}} the clade preceded the isolation of North America and Europe, thereby pushing the group's date of evolution back to at least the middle Aptian. The separation of Nodosauridae into European Struthiosaurinae and North American Nodosaurinae {{by the end of the}} Aptian provides a revised date for the isolation of the continents from each other with rising sealevel.|$|E

5|$|The {{trailing}} {{edge of the}} transmitter pulse was not perfectly sharp and caused the receiver signals to ring {{for a short time}} even if they were turned on after the pulse was ostensibly complete. This leftover signal caused a large permanent blip known as the transmitter break through which appeared at the short-range end of the tubes (left and bottom). A control known as the Oscillator Bias allowed the exact <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> receiver's activation relative to the transmitter pulse to be adjusted, normally so the remains of the pulse were just visible.|$|E
5|$|After hatching, the {{offspring}} {{feed on the}} tissue of the cicadas provided by their mother. Males emerge before females and both genders are sexually receptive from emergence in July to early August, when they mate and brood. English naturalist Charles Darwin postulated that the pattern of male emergence before females evolved by natural selection to improve the chances of the male mating. The <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> emergence of females has evolved to correspond with the similar emergence of the cicada species of the area, Tibicen duryi and T.parallela, which they hunt for the provisioning of their nests. Many have yellow markings located on their tergites (dorsal portion), although some have been found only from the first to fifth tergites.|$|E
