50|$|Radio France put {{in place}} a vaste re-organisation of its {{frequencies}} for the year 2000. In its Plan Bleu it outlined, amongst other things, that Le Mouv' would be heard in larger markets, with significant university populations. Le Mouv's coverage area in the smaller towns of France were to be handed over to the France Bleu network of local stations, whilst FIP stations in the bigger cities were to be closed for Le Mouv'. Le Mouv' thus appeared in Marseille, Lille, Lyon, Nantes, as well as Ajaccio, Brest, Rennes and Valence. This suscitied a number of protests in the cities concerned. Audience share in Toulouse reached 3.4% by 2001. A new frequency for Clermont-Ferrand came on-air in November 2001, followed by strong protests from private radio groups. However Radio France announced the arrival of Le Mouv' in Paris, backed up by a visible marketing campaign. TDF Transmitter work aimed at improving Radio France network stations on FM made it possible <b>to</b> <b>re-utilise</b> a frequency already used by France Musiques. Le Mouv' started broadcasts in the Paris region on 6 December 2001 with its first private concert held in March 2002. This gave the station a potential coverage of 16 million people, with 100,000 listeners in its first set of results in 2003.|$|E

40|$|This study {{experimentally}} {{investigates the}} gasification of nickel-preloaded oil palm biomass {{as an alternative}} catalytic approach to produce clean syngas. To eliminate the use of catalyst support, nickel was added directly to the oil palm mesocarp fiber via ion-exchange using an aqueous solution of nickel nitrate. Nickel species was found to disperse very well on the biomass at a nano-scale dispersion. The presence of the finely dispersed nickels on biomass enhanced syngas production and reduced tar content in the producer gas during the air gasification of biomass. It is believed that nickel particles attached on the biomass and its char promote the catalytic cracking of tar on their surface and supply free radicals to the gas phase to enhance the radical-driven gas-phase reactions for the reforming of high molecular weight hydrocarbons. The unconsumed nickel-containing char shows great potential <b>to</b> be <b>re-utilised</b> as a catalyst to further enhance the destruction of tar components in the secondary tar reduction process.

40|$|This {{research}} experimentally {{investigates the}} air gasification of nickel-loaded oil palm mesocarp fiber (OPMF) as a low environmental impact catalytic approach to produce clean syngas. The biomass gasification approach {{used in this}} study simplifies the catalyst preparation steps and eliminates the use o f additional support materials. In this research, nickel was added directly onto OPMF by soaking with nickel nitrate anhydrate solution, with different initial nickel concentration, initial nickel pH and soaking time. Then, the nickel loaded and unloaded OPMF being gasified to investigate the difference at temperature 750 - 900 °C. The by-product of this process which is nickel containing char being used as a catalyst in the steam reforming of benzene and toluene at 850 °C. The presence of nickel enhanced syngas and reduced tar content in the producer gas with tar yield of 0. 2 % compared with 0. 8 % of tar yield from gasification of unloaded OPMF. It is believed that nickel particles attached on OPMF and its char promote the catalytic cracking o f tar on their surface and supply radicals to the gas phase to enhance the radical-driven gas-phase reactions for the reforming o f high molecular weight hydrocarbons. The unconsumed nickel-containing char shows great potential <b>to</b> be <b>re-utilised</b> as a catalyst to further enhance tar destruction in the secondary tar reduction process by showing higher composition of CO and H 2 compared with the unloaded OPMF char. Overall, this research shows the potential o f using the abundantly available oil palm waste as a renewable energy sources in the gasification process...|$|R
40|$|A preconcentration {{system for}} the {{determination}} of cobalt in water was developed. The studied system uses a glass column packed with Amberlyst A- 26 resin modified with ammonium morpholinedithiocarbamate. The metal was quantitatively retained in the column containing 1. 30 g of resin modified with 6 % (m/m) of chelating reagent, at pH 5. 5, resulting in a coloured complex which was eluted with 10. 0 mL of ethanol. The final solution was analysed by flame atomic absorption spectrometry at 240. 7 nm. Using these conditions a preconcentration factor of 25 was obtained and depending on the concentration of cobalt present in the solution it was possible <b>to</b> <b>re-utilise</b> the packed column several times. The limit of quantification was 2. 0 µg L- 1 with RSD of 2. 9 %. The foreign ions effect was studied and only Cd(II) and Ni(II) showed interference. The proposed method showed to be simple, of low cost, easy to handle and has been applied for the determination of cobalt in natural water samples...|$|E
40|$|The {{reduction}} of EOL concrete disposal in landfills, {{together with a}} lower exploitation of primary raw materials, generates a strong interest to develop, set-up and apply innovative technologies to maximize Construction and Demolition Waste (C&DW) conversion into useful secondary raw materials. Such a goal can be reached starting from a punctual in-situ efficient characterization of the objects to dismantle {{in order to develop}} demolition actions aimed to set up innovative mechanical-physical processes to recover the different materials and products to recycle. In this paper an innovative recycling-oriented characterization strategy based on HyperSpectral Imaging (HSI) is described in order to identify aggregates and mortar in drill core samples from end-of-life concrete. To reach this goal, concrete drill cores from a demolition site were systematically investigated by HSI in the short wave infrared field (1000 - 2500 nm). Results obtained by the adoption of the HSI approach showed as this technology can be successfully applied to analyze quality and characteristics of C& DW before dismantling and as final product <b>to</b> <b>re-utilise</b> after demolition-milling-classification actions. The proposed technique and the related recognition logics, through the spectral signature detection of finite physical domains (i. e. concrete slice and/or particle) of different nature and composition, allows; i) to develop characterization procedures able to quantitatively assess end-of-life concrete compositional/textural characteristics and ii) to set up innovative sorting strategies to qualify the different materials constituting drill core samples...|$|E
30|$|Most {{steps of}} the SLS process {{are similar to those}} of SLA, but the former enables the {{processing}} of powder-based materials by melting or sintering and does not use organic solvents or any toxic chemicals. The SLS technique also eliminates the requirement of an additional supporting structure for the model during processing because unprocessed powders serve as a supporting material. However, SLS has an inherent shortcoming (i.e. heat transfer reactions by radiation, convection and conduction in the feeders and in the powder bed) and as a result, the biodegradable polymer powder is likely to degrade (Pham et al. 2008). Nevertheless, the investigation by Pereira et al. (2012) on both processed P 3 HB powder and unprocessed P 3 HB powder has clearly shown that there were no significant differences between the two groups of P 3 HB in thermal values and chemical shift peaks obtained from DSC and 1 H-NMR, respectively, indicating that the P 3 HB powder which underwent printing sets can be <b>re-utilised</b> <b>to</b> print additional structures without affecting the reproducibility of the process. Although the heat generated by the laser beam may not affect the material property at a short time, SLS processing of complex-shaped prototypes or large prototypes typically needs enough time to expose polymers to a high temperature. Another problem of this technique is associated with the almost-impossible removal of powder trapped inside the small hole, which may block cellular ingrowth and induce an adverse inflammatory reaction. Similar to SLA, the shrinkage of the parts during melting or sintering is another principal problem.|$|R
40|$|From the pre-industrial period {{till now}} fossil fuel has played an {{important}} role for fulfilling the demand of energy for cooking and heating. At present about 40 % of global electricity is being produced by burning different quality and type of coal and this is predicted to increase by 5 % in 2030. Coal contains a high amount of carbon and emits large quantities of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere during combustion. It is predicted that burning fossil fuel alone for generating electricity is emitting about 25. 9 % of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases has increased from pre-industrial level, leading to a global temperature increase of 0. 7 degree centigrade. Coal being highly rich in carbon content compared to other fossil fuels such as natural gas and petroleum, emits relatively higher carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. According to IEA, coal and gas comprised of 41. 5 % and 20. 9 % of electricity generated worldwide. There are different ways of generating electricity using coal and gas such as converting coal into fine powder or into gaseous form before combustion. In the case of gas fired power plants combined cycle power plant is regarded as a more efficient method of generating electricity as waste heat is also <b>re-utilised</b> <b>to</b> generate electricity. In comparison between coal and gas, gas is regarded as less carbon intensive fuel, emitting 55 % less CO 2 per MWh of energy produced. Many non-carbon technologies are already in commercial use to reduce emissions from industries and power plants to atmosphere. One of the alternatives is switching from carbon to non-carbon sources of energy such as solar, wind, hydro and nuclear powers or to less carbon intensive sources of energy. However, switching to non-carbon sources of energy is not easy for all countries globally. Therefore one of the possibilities would be to implement new technology in power plants called Carbon Capture and Storage technology. With Carbon Capture and Storage technology it is possible to capture 80 - 90 % of carbon dioxide from the power plants. In this thesis, I have compared the cost of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) using different fossil fuel power plants for generating the power. Three types of power plants, Pulverized coal (PC), Intergraded gasification combined cycle (IGCC) and Natural gas combined cycle (NGCC), are considered when analysing the cost of electricity with and without the carbon capture facility installed. Cost comparisons between renewable and CCS implemented plant is also discussed. Using Carbon Capture and Storage Technology reduces the net efficiency of power plants and increases the cost per unit of power production. Analysis and comparison shows that with and without capture technology installed, pulverized coal plant emitted higher carbon dioxide compared to natural gas power plant. Without capture facility installed 78. 29 US$/MWh of electricity produced by a PC plant was found to be cheaper compared to 89, 81 US$/ MWh by NGCC power plant. At the same it was also found that with capture facility installed cost of electricity increased by 47. 01 US$/MWh for PC plant, 28. 04 US$/MWh for IGCC plant and 68. 88 US$/MWh for NGCC plant, with capturing efficiency of approximately 90 %. Transportation and storage also {{play an important role in}} per unit cost of the power produced. Review of the literature showed that transportation costs for same distances varied with capacity of the power plant, the higher the capacity lower the cost. Further a simple optimisation model is presented to analyse the optimal path of Carbon Capture and Storage technology compared to plants without carbon capture and renewable energy. Four phases of the model are discussed and the outcome starts in phase I and moves to phase II or starts directly from phase II if tax rates on carbon dioxide are sufficiently high. As a result the outcome will asymptotically approach phase III if s'(v) = 0 and phase IV if s'(v) > 0. Cost of fossil fuel power with CCS technology is compared with hydro power, nuclear energy, solar energy and wind energy. The comparison showed that the cost of electricity production is lower for non carbon emitting power plants compared to capture power plants. Finally, the marginal cost of electricity production is calculated with different levels of tax rates. From the results it can be seen that with substantially high emission penalties CCS technology would become competitive in the market with plants without capture. However, with abundant availability of fossil fuels and large scale deployment of CCS technology a fraction of total carbon dioxide produced during electricity production will still be released back into the atmosphere...|$|R
