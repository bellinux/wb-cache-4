5|$|In November 1993, David Hale—the {{source of}} {{criminal}} allegations against Bill Clinton in <b>the</b> <b>Whitewater</b> controversy—alleged {{that while he}} was governor of Arkansas, Clinton pressured him to provide an illegal $300,000 loan to Susan McDougal, the Clintons' partner in <b>the</b> <b>Whitewater</b> land deal. A U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation resulted in convictions against the McDougals for their role in <b>the</b> <b>Whitewater</b> project, but the Clintons themselves were never charged, and Clinton maintains his and his wife's innocence in the affair.|$|E

Mussie is referenced in travel pamphlets for <b>the</b> <b>Whitewater</b> Region area; one suggests {{that it can be}} caught by a fishing rod.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> American <b>Whitewater</b> started {{publishing}} a journal in 1955. <b>The</b> American <b>Whitewater</b> Journal was considered <b>the</b> first <b>whitewater</b> magazine in <b>the</b> United States.

5|$|At first <b>the</b> <b>Whitewater</b> River {{and local}} washes were {{considered}} {{the primary source}} of these sands, which would have been transported to the Algodones area by longshore drift. This would imply a minimum age of 160,000 years. Later the Colorado River was identified as the main source of these sediments, potentially with some contribution from local drainages. At prevailing winds, most of the sediments from the Colorado would have been transported to the Cerro Prieto area and possibly carried by wind to the Gran Desierto de Altar.|$|E

5|$|In 1979, Rodham {{became the}} first woman to be made a full partner of Rose Law Firm. From 1978 until they entered the White House, she had a higher salary than her husband. During 1978 and 1979, while looking to {{supplement}} their income, Rodham engaged in the trading of cattle futures contracts; an initial $1,000 investment generated nearly $100,000 when she stopped trading after ten months. At this time, the couple also began their ill-fated investment in <b>the</b> <b>Whitewater</b> Development Corporation real estate venture with Jim and Susan McDougal. Both of these became subjects of controversy in the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Whitewater</b> {{controversy}} was {{the focus}} of media attention from the publication of a New York Times report during the 1992 presidential campaign and throughout her time as first lady. The Clintons had lost their late-1970s investment in <b>the</b> <b>Whitewater</b> Development Corporation; at the same time, their partners in that investment, Jim and Susan McDougal, operated Madison Guaranty, a savings and loan institution that retained the legal services of Rose Law Firm and may have been improperly subsidizing Whitewater losses. Madison Guaranty later failed and Clinton's work at Rose was scrutinized for a possible conflict of interest in representing the bank before state regulators that her husband had appointed. She said she had done minimal work for the bank. Independent counsels Robert Fiske and Kenneth Starr subpoenaed Clinton's legal billing records; she said she did not know where they were. The records were found in the First Lady's White House book room after a two-year search and delivered to investigators in early 1996. The delayed appearance of the records sparked intense interest and another investigation concerning how they surfaced and where they had been. Clinton's staff attributed the problem to continual changes in White House storage areas since the move from the Arkansas Governor's Mansion. On January 26, 1996, Clinton became the first first lady to be subpoenaed to testify before a federal grand jury. After several Independent Counsels had investigated, a final report was issued in 2000 that stated there was insufficient evidence that either Clinton had engaged in criminal wrongdoing.|$|E

5|$|Mathews {{began her}} career in 1990 as an {{associate}} at the New York consulting firm McKinsey & Company. In 1992 Mathews joined Bill Clinton's presidential campaign and led the economic team for the president-elect. Following Clinton's inauguration, Mathews, with Robert Rubin, helped set up the National Economic Council (NEC). She served as Staff Director of the NEC from 1993 to 1995. While Mathews was at NEC, the White House pushed for healthcare reform. Mathews was among those in the administration who advocated for finding ways, apart from legislation, to curb healthcare costs. When Rubin became Secretary of the Treasury in 1995, Mathews became his Chief of Staff. She testified before a Senate Committee during <b>the</b> <b>Whitewater</b> investigations regarding her search of Vince Foster's garbage {{and the fate of}} the documents she discovered. Mathews told the committee she had been looking for an indication as to why Foster had committed suicide and denied ordering any documents destroyed.|$|E
