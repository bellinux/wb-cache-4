5|$|During the 1930s, {{and again}} during the 1950s, the {{relationship}} between the loanable funds doctrine and the liquidity preference theory were discussed at length. Some authors considered <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>approaches</b> as largely equivalent but this issue is still unresolved.|$|E
5|$|During the eight-month period, Beyoncé {{recorded}} over seventy {{songs and}} decided during the editing process {{that she did}} not want to reconcile <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>approaches</b> into one disc. If a song was meaningless to her, she cut them off during the process of elimination for the final track listing. After a process of elimination, twelve tracks were selected to be placed on the standard edition of the album, while five additional tracks were chosen to make the final cut for the deluxe edition of the album. Beyoncé later revealed that songs from established producers like The Neptunes and Danja were not able to make the final cut.|$|E
5|$|Main {{memory in}} a {{parallel}} computer is either shared memory (shared between all processing elements in a single address space), or distributed memory (in which each processing element has its own local address space). Distributed memory refers {{to the fact that}} the memory is logically distributed, but often implies that it is physically distributed as well. Distributed shared memory and memory virtualization combine <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>approaches,</b> where the processing element has its own local memory and access to the memory on non-local processors. Accesses to local memory are typically faster than accesses to non-local memory.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, the US 1st Marine Division {{was holding}} firm against the Chinese 39th Army to the east, and the {{withdrawal}} of the South Koreans had left their flank exposed. However, with the Chinese 39th and 40th Armies only tasked with protecting the eastern flank of the 9th Army Group against possible counterattacks from the 1st Marine Division, the Chinese did not exploit this opportunity and the Americans remained relatively unmolested. Yet with the forward UN positions in both the US I Corps and US IX Corps sectors increasingly untenable as the Chinese exploited gaps between formations, Van Fleet ordered a withdrawal to the Kansas Line in the mid-morning. Hoge subsequently ordered the US Marines to form a new defensive position beyond the Pukhan River, between the Hwachon Reservoir and the new position to be occupied by the South Korean 6th Division. Hoge's plan relied on the South Koreans reforming and offering some resistance, and although a rearguard of 2,500 men was belatedly established it was in no condition to fight. Fearing a breakthrough, Hoge ordered the 27th Brigade, as the corps' reserve, to establish defensive positions north of Kapyong on the afternoon of 23 April as a precaution in the event the South Koreans were unable to hold, tasking them with blocking <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>approaches</b> to the village and to prevent the Chinese from cutting Route 17, a key route south to Seoul and an important main supply route.|$|E
25|$|A {{significant}} difference between Twelve Step work and cognitive-behavioral therapy is the acceptance of a Higher Power and providing peer support. A large study, known as Project Match, compared <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>approaches</b> as well as motivational enhancement therapy in treating alcoholics. The Twelve Step programs {{were found to be}} more effective in promoting abstinence. However, some researchers have found that cognitive-behavioral therapy is the most effective treatment for bulimics. <b>The</b> <b>two</b> <b>approaches</b> are not mutually exclusive.|$|E
25|$|Australian {{troops from}} 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (3RAR), and Canadian troops from 2PPCLI {{were ordered to}} halt this Chinese advance.

50|$|The central span of {{the current}} bridge is formed by two {{cantilevered}} sections, with <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>approach</b> spans acting as counterweights. This model represented the first use in reinforced concrete of a cantilevered and counterweight construction in either Britain or Ireland.|$|R
25|$|This overall {{process is}} {{referred}} to as affine shape adaptation (Lindeberg and Garding 1997; Baumberg 2000; Mikolajczyk and Schmid 2004; Tuytelaars and van Gool 2004; Lindeberg 2008). In the ideal continuous case, <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>approaches</b> are mathematically equivalent. In practical implementations, however, the first filter-based approach is usually more accurate in the presence of noise while the second warping-based approach is usually faster.|$|E
25|$|For instance, C-star algebra {{provides}} an alternative axiomatization to probability theory. In {{this case the}} method {{goes by the name}} of Gelfand–Naimark–Segal construction. This is analogous to <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>approaches</b> to measure and integration, where one has the choice to construct measures of sets first and define integrals later, or construct integrals first and define set measures as integrals of characteristic functions.|$|E
25|$|The {{connection}} between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>approaches</b> is as follows. The coefficients of the polynomial in question should be chosen {{from the base}} field K. The top field L should be the field obtained by adjoining {{the roots of the}} polynomial in question to the base field. Any permutation of the roots which respects algebraic equations as described above gives rise to an automorphism of L/K, and vice versa.|$|E

25|$|These {{results also}} can be {{obtained}} directly by two time differentiations of rB (t). Agreement of <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>approaches</b> demonstrates that one could start from the general expression for fictitious acceleration above and derive the trajectories shown here.

25|$|The {{surgical}} procedure {{most often used}} to implant the device is called mastoidectomy with facial recess approach (MFRA). If a person's individual anatomy prevents MFRA, other approaches, such as through the suprameatal triangle are used. A systematic literature review published in 2016 found that studies comparing <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>approaches</b> were generally small, not randomized, and retrospective so were not useful for making generalizations; {{it is not known}} which approach is safer or more effective.|$|E
25|$|The Farris Engineering Company, a Pittsburgh company {{located in}} the Empire Building, {{performed}} {{a great deal of}} work on the bridge at its new location. The original approved contract for their work had a price total of $271,811.50. They built portions of the substructure that the Foundation Company had not done. Farris also erected the two pony truss approach spans, repaired and painted the main superstructure, and paved the bridge deck and <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>approaches.</b>|$|E

25|$|Here a {{slightly}} more rigorous approach is taken {{in order to address}} potential problems that were disregarded in the interaction picture approach of above. The final outcome is, of course, the same as when taking the quicker route. For this, the notions of in and out states are needed. These will be developed in two ways, from vacua, and from free particle states. Needless to say, <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>approaches</b> are equivalent, but they illuminate matters from different angles.|$|E
25|$|Pearce's {{formulation}} {{looks very}} different from the original definition of a stable model. Instead of reducts, it refers to equilibrium logic— a system of nonmonotonic logic based on Kripke models. Ferraris's formulation, on the other hand, is based on reducts, although the process of constructing the reduct that it uses differs from the one described above. <b>The</b> <b>two</b> <b>approaches</b> to defining stable models for sets of propositional formulas are equivalent to each other.|$|E
25|$|Which style use in {{teaching}} reading has divided educators for years. It {{is now known}} that using <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>approaches</b> together is more powerful than either program alone. The technical skills learned through phonics are important for many children when learning to read, spell, and general language comprehension and engagement {{of children in the}} whole-language approach is also important to keep the children motivated and excited to learn. Many teachers and schools acknowledge this and say that they use multiple methods to teach children to read.|$|E

40|$|Revision {{programming}} is a formalism {{to describe and}} enforce constraints on belief sets, databases, and more generally, on arbitrary sets. In this paper we describe four approaches to defining well-founded semantics of revision programming and approximating justified revisions. <b>The</b> first <b>two</b> <b>approaches</b> are obtained via embeddings of revision programs into logic programs. <b>The</b> other <b>two</b> <b>approaches</b> are specific to revision programming and provide approximations for justified revisions. ...|$|R

25|$|Whatever the causes, however, psychoticism marks <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>approaches</b> apart, as {{the five}} factor model {{contains}} no such trait. Moreover, psychoticism, unlike {{any of the}} other factors in either approach, does not fit a normal distribution curve. Indeed, scores are rarely high, thus skewing a normal distribution. However, when they are high, there is considerable overlap with psychiatric conditions such as antisocial and schizoid personality disorders. Similarly, high scorers on neuroticism are more susceptible to sleep and psychosomatic disorders. Five factor approaches can also predict future mental disorders.|$|E
25|$|Sex {{education}} in the United States is taught in two main forms: comprehensive sex education and abstinence-only. Comprehensive sex education covers abstinence as a choice option, but also informs adolescents about human sexuality, age of consent {{and the availability of}} contraception and techniques to avoid contraction of sexually transmitted infections. Abstinence-only sex education emphasizes abstinence from sexual activity prior to marriage and rejects methods such as contraception. The difference between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>approaches,</b> and their impact on the behavior of adolescents, remains a controversial subject in the United States.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>two</b> <b>approaches</b> are {{complementary}} {{rather than}} competitive, {{but they do}} result in different perspectives, and occasionally conflicts of opinion about matters of substance. In addition, {{for most of the}} twentieth century, comparative psychology developed most strongly in North America, while ethology was stronger in Europe. From a practical standpoint, early comparative psychologists concentrated on gaining extensive knowledge of the behaviour of very few species. Ethologists were more interested in understanding behaviour across a wide range of species to facilitate principled comparisons across taxonomic groups. Ethologists have made much more use of such cross-species comparisons than comparative psychologists have.|$|E
