5|$|Army <b>trousers</b> were {{of similar}} pattern to the U.S. Army <b>trousers,</b> or {{civilian}} designs, {{depending on the}} area in which they were made. They were typically a shade of gray or brown, with a variety of medium blues also produced. The individual could also have them trimmed to reflect his militia unit, his Non-commissioned officer status, or as a personal flare, to the ubiquitous service pants. Noncommissioned officers were to wear on their outer seams a one and one-quarter inch cotton stripe or braid of colors appropriate to their army branch.|$|E

5|$|The Confederate <b>trousers</b> {{were very}} {{similar to those of the}} Union forces. Early on, the <b>trousers</b> were sky blue in color. They were most often made of wool, and were easily worn during long marches. If <b>trousers</b> did not arrive for the troops the {{soldiers}} would have to use their own pants to wear.

5|$|In {{the sport}} of ferret-legging, {{competitors}} tie their <b>trousers</b> at the ankles before placing two ferrets inside and securely fastening their belts to prevent the ferrets from escaping. Each competitor then {{stands in front of}} the judges for as long as he can. Competitors cannot be drunk or drugged, nor can the ferrets be sedated. In addition, competitors are not allowed to wear underwear beneath their <b>trousers,</b> which must allow the ferrets free access from one leg to the other, and the ferrets must have a full set of teeth that must not have been filed or otherwise blunted. The winner is the person who lasts the longest.|$|E
5|$|Most aikido systems add {{a pair of}} wide pleated {{black or}} indigo <b>trousers</b> called a hakama (used also in kendo and iaido). In many schools, its use is {{reserved}} for practitioners with (dan) ranks or for instructors, while others allow all practitioners to wear a hakama regardless of rank.|$|E
5|$|Putting on socks {{resembles a}} {{commutative}} operation since which sock {{is put on}} first is unimportant. Either way, the result (having both socks on), is the same. In contrast, putting on underwear and <b>trousers</b> is not commutative.|$|E
5|$|St George's can admit up to 380 pupils annually. Upon admission, pupils are {{allocated}} a mixed ability form, {{where they}} are registered, taught Life Skills and have access to pastoral support from their tutors. For all the other lessons, the pupils are set by ability. Each year group has a progress manager with responsibility for the students in that year. Since the Education Act 2002, years 7, 8 and 9 have been grouped into Key Stage 3 and years 10 and 11 into Key Stage 4, which co-ordinates how the National Curriculum is taught. At St George's, a manager is assigned to each Key Stage for pastoral support. Before the conversion to Academy status, the school uniform consisted of a navy-blue blazer with the school emblem sewn on, a white shirt, navy-blue tie and dark-grey <b>trousers</b> (girls could wear plain-blue skirts) for all pupils in years 7–10; year 11 pupils could wear a dark-blue jumper, shirt and grey <b>trousers.</b> Since 2010, girls no longer wear ties, and must wear a revere collar blouse. Dark-grey <b>trousers</b> or a pleated dark-grey skirt are available for girls to wear; boys have dark-grey <b>trousers.</b> All pupils wear a blue blazer, but those in Key Stage 3 have bright blue piping on their lapels; shirts are white until Year 11, when thin blue stripes are worn.|$|E
5|$|The ferrets are {{occasionally}} put {{inside the}} contestants' shirts {{in addition to}} their <b>trousers.</b> An attempt to introduce a female version of the sport—ferret busting, in which female contestants introduced ferrets down their blouses—proved unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|The uniform worn for {{practicing}} aikido (aikidōgi) {{is similar}} to the training uniform (keikogi) used in most other modern martial arts; simple <b>trousers</b> and a wraparound jacket, usually white. Both thick ("judo-style"), and thin ("karate-style") cotton tops are used. Aikido-specific tops are available with shorter sleeves which reach to just below the elbow.|$|E
5|$|To keep up {{with current}} trends and appeal to {{audience}} new generation, a new uniform, designed by Meg Andrew, was introduced in 2001. The uniform included a variety of bold exciting colours, with the younger sections wearing sweatshirts and activity <b>trousers.</b>|$|E
5|$|Traditional attire in Faisalabad is Punjabi {{clothing}} {{such as the}} dhoti, kurta and pagri. Faisalabadi men wear white shalwar kameez as {{do women}} but also with a dupatta (scarf). The more conservative women wear burqas {{that may or may}} not cover the face. Combinations of Pakistani and Western attire are worn by women, such as an embroidered kurta worn with jeans or <b>trousers,</b> and half sleeve or sleeveless shirts with Capri pants. Men have adopted some of the modern Western styles for both casual and formal business dress such as dress pants, <b>trousers,</b> T-shirts and jeans.|$|E
5|$|Whale tail is the Y-shaped {{waistband}} of a thong or G-string when visible above the waistline of low-rise jeans, shorts, or a skirt {{that resembles a}} whale's tail. Intentionally or unintentionally, a whale tail is exposed above the <b>trousers</b> mostly when sitting or bending, or even while standing. The frequency or occasion depends on the style of <b>trousers,</b> the style of underwear, {{and the way they}} are worn. Displaying whale tails became popular in the early 2000s, together with the rise of low-rise jeans and thong underwear. The trend, popularized by a number of female celebrities including Christina Aguilera, Victoria Beckham, Mariah Carey, Paris Hilton and Britney Spears, waned within the decade.|$|E
5|$|After dawn, Les accidentally wakes Maxwell, but {{sees that}} Kath is absent. The train brakes, waking everyone, and Hugo and the corpse {{fall to the}} floor. Maxwell guesses that Kath has stopped the train as Jorg stands, {{dropping}} his <b>trousers.</b> Maxwell next guesses that Kath has jumped {{in front of the}} train, and Les repeatedly hits him with a pillow as Jorg defecates into Kath's shoebox, which is held by Hugo. Shona sees that the train has hit a deer, and Kath re-enters.|$|E

5|$|Dundas {{subsequently}} {{became a}} journalist for the Yorkshire Post and its editorial staff. Another {{who worked on}} the paper at the time, Richard Pape, recalled him as a man indifferent to his personal appearance, who wore frayed <b>trousers,</b> frequently had ink-stained hands and would spill beer over himself when drinking, yet who was also popular with the newspaper's younger, female staff members.|$|E
5|$|Ezra... would {{approach}} with the step of a dancer, making passes {{with a cane}} at an imaginary opponent.

5|$|Ferret-legging was an {{endurance}} test or stunt in which ferrets {{were trapped in}} <b>trousers</b> worn by a participant. Also known as put 'em down and ferret-down-trousers, {{it seems to have}} been popular among coal miners in Yorkshire, England. Contestants put live ferrets inside their trousers; the winner is the one who is the last to release the animals. The world record is five hours and thirty minutes.|$|E
5|$|His {{body was}} cut down {{after an hour}} by the hangman, John Foxton, who claimed Corder's <b>trousers</b> and {{stockings}} according to his rights. The body was taken back to the courtroom at Shire Hall, where it was slit open along the abdomen to expose the muscles. The crowds were allowed to file past until six o'clock, when the doors were shut. According to the Norwich and Bury Post, over 5,000 people queued to see the body.|$|E
5|$|In the 1st and 2nd centuries, a Roman soldier's clothes {{consisted}} of a single-piece, short-sleeved tunic the hem of which reached the knees and special hobnailed sandals (caligae). This attire, which left the arms and legs bare, had evolved in a Mediterranean climate and was not suitable for northern Europe in cold weather. In northern Europe, long-sleeved tunics, <b>trousers</b> (bracae), socks (worn inside the caligae) and laced boots were commonly worn in winter from the 1st century. During the 3rd century, these items of clothing became much more widespread, apparently common in Mediterranean provinces also. However, {{it is likely that}} in warmer weather, <b>trousers</b> were dispensed with and caligae worn instead of socks and boots. Late Roman clothing was often highly decorated, with woven or embroidered strips, clavi, circular roundels, orbiculi, or square panels, tabulae, added to tunics and cloaks. These colourful decorative elements usually {{consisted of}} geometrical patterns and stylised plant motifs, but could include human or animal figures. A distinctive part of a soldier's costume, though it seems to have also been worn by non-military bureaucrats, was a type of round, brimless hat known as the pannonian cap (pileus pannonicus).|$|E
5|$|Saree is the {{traditional}} dress of women in Karnataka. Women in Kodagu have a distinct style of wearing the saree, {{different from the rest}} of Karnataka.

Cadet ranks are shown by shoulder marks or pin-on insignia.|$|E
5|$|The {{guidelines}} set by Judah Benjamin in 1861 {{soon became}} {{the choice of}} the clothing depots across the South as the war went into its second year. This easier-to-produce jacket, with the loosened hat and trouser regulations, made it easier to clothe Confederate infantrymen. The typical uniform by the end of 1861 and beginning of 1862 was a slouch hat or kepi, a shell-jacket, and a pair of sky-blue or gray cloth <b>trousers,</b> with brogans.|$|E
5|$|The {{people of}} Uttar Pradesh dress {{in a variety}} of {{traditional}} and Western styles. Traditional styles of dress include colourful draped garments—such as sari for women and dhoti or lungi for men—and tailored clothes such as salwar kameez for women and kurta-pyjama for men. Men often sport head-gear like topi or pagri. Sherwani is a more formal male dress and is frequently worn along with chooridar on festive occasions. European-style <b>trousers</b> and shirts are also common among the men.|$|E
5|$|The typical Parthian riding outfit is {{exemplified}} by the famous bronze statue of a Parthian nobleman found at Shami, Elymais. Standing 1.9m (6ft), the figure wears a V-shaped jacket, a V-shaped tunic fastened in place with a belt, loose-fitting and many-folded <b>trousers</b> held by garters, and a diadem or band over his coiffed, bobbed hair. His outfit is commonly seen in relief images of Parthian coins by the mid-1st century BC.|$|E
5|$|After the war, he {{commanded}} the 92nd Gordon Highlanders at Jamaica—where he scandalised his regiment by ordering them to adopt <b>trousers</b> {{instead of the}} kilt—and the 90th Light Infantry in the Ionian Islands, before retiring from active duty in 1829. He then held a number of administrative roles in Ireland, including the state secretary to the Lord-Lieutenant and the commissioner of police in Ulster, and after the accession of Queen Victoria in 1837 became a palace courtier. His final military role was the (ceremonial) colonelcy of the 83rd (County of Dublin) Regiment, which he held from 1848 until his death.|$|E
5|$|Before daybreak on February 15, 1916, between 100 and 300 Vietnamese {{wearing white}} headbands, white <b>trousers</b> and black tops, armed with sticks, farm {{implements}} and knives, sailed along the Arroyo Chinoise waterway and disembarked near {{the centre of}} Saigon. They had pretended to be working the transport industry, delivering fruit, vegetables and building materials. The plan was that this advance party would give signals to a larger party of rebels, who were waiting {{on the outskirts of}} Saigon with the majority of the weapons, to move into the city for {{the main part of the}} uprising.|$|E
5|$|Cotton was domesticated in India by 4000 BCE. Traditional Indian dress {{varies in}} colour and style across regions and depends on various factors, {{including}} climate and faith. Popular styles of dress include draped garments {{such as the}} sari for women and the dhoti or lungi for men. Stitched clothes, such as the shalwar kameez for women and kurta–pyjama combinations or European-style <b>trousers</b> and shirts for men, are also popular. Use of delicate jewellery, modelled on real flowers worn in ancient India, {{is part of a}} tradition dating back some 5,000 years; gemstones are also worn in India as talismans.|$|E
5|$|Examples of {{clothing}} in Parthian inspired sculptures {{have been found}} in excavations at Hatra, in northwestern Iraq. Statues erected there feature the typical Parthian shirt (qamis), combined with <b>trousers</b> and made with fine, ornamented materials. The aristocratic elite of Hatra adopted the bobbed hairstyles, headdresses, and belted tunics worn by the nobility belonging to the central Arsacid court. The trouser-suit was even worn by the Arsacid kings, as shown on the reverse images of coins. The Parthian trouser-suit was also adopted in Palmyra, Syria, along with the use of Parthian frontality in art.|$|E
5|$|From 1967 onwards, prison {{conditions}} improved; black prisoners were given <b>trousers</b> rather than shorts, games were permitted, {{and the standard}} of their food was raised. In 1969, an escape plan for Mandela was developed by Gordon Bruce, but it was abandoned after the conspiracy was infiltrated by {{an agent of the}} South African Bureau of State Security (BOSS), who hoped to see Mandela shot during the escape. In 1970, Commander Piet Badenhorst became commanding officer. Mandela, seeing an increase in the physical and mental abuse of prisoners, complained to visiting judges, who had Badenhorst reassigned. He was replaced by Commander Willie Willemse, who developed a co-operative relationship with Mandela and was keen to improve prison standards.|$|E
5|$|Hartmann patiently {{waited for}} the right moment to escape, then, using the {{distraction}} of the Stukas attack, he attacked the single guard. Hartmann jumped {{out of the back of}} the truck and ran into a large field of giant sunflowers. Evading the pursuing soldiers, Hartmann hid and waited for nightfall. In the dark, Hartmann followed a Soviet patrol heading west to the front. As he approached the German position, he was challenged by a sentry who fired a shot which passed through his <b>trousers.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1972, the ferret-legging record {{stood at}} 40 seconds. A few years later, the record {{had risen to}} over one minute, and {{eventually}} to 90 minutes. In 1977, Edward Simpkins from the Isle of Wight set the new world record of five hours and ten minutes, although he only had one ferret in his <b>trousers</b> during the first four hours and two for the last seventy minutes. Simpkins sustained two large bites during his record-breaking attempt, but continued {{to play a game}} of darts undeterred.|$|E
5|$|In the series' story, the Nemesis is {{the result}} of infecting a Tyrant — a {{humanoid}} bio-weapon created to be the ultimate lifeform—with a parasitic organism designed to increase its intelligence. Upon infection, the parasite takes control of the Tyrant's nervous system, forming its own brain and enabling it to follow precise instructions and make decisions without a need for constant direction. Clothed in black <b>trousers,</b> an overcoat, boots, and gloves, the Nemesis is armed with a rocket launcher mounted on its left arm. To emphasize its design as a prototype, the game developers left exposed muscles on its body and added stitches to cover the right eye. Upon spotting its target, it says the target's name out loud and attacks.|$|E
