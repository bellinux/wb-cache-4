5|$|Baltimore's early jazz pioneers {{included}} Blanche Calloway, one of {{the first}} female jazz bandleaders in the United States, and sister to jazz legend Cab Calloway. Both the Calloways, like many of Baltimore's prominent black musicians, studied at Frederick Douglass High School with William Llewellyn Wilson, himself a renowned performer and conductor for the first African American symphony in Baltimore. Baltimore was also home <b>to</b> <b>Chick</b> Webb, one of jazz's most heralded drummers, who became a musical star despite being born hunchbacked and crippled at the age of five years. Later Baltimoreans in jazz include Elmer Snowden, and Ethel Ennis. After Pennsylvania Avenue declined in the 1950s, Baltimore's jazz scene changed. The Left Bank Jazz Society, an organization dedicated to promoting live jazz, began holding a weekly series of concerts in 1965, featuring the biggest names in the field, including Duke Ellington and John Coltrane. The tapes from these recordings became legendary within the jazz aficionados, but they did not begin to be released until 2000, due to legal complications.|$|E

40|$|Artigo a {{publicar}} na revista AiroWe compared chick food provisioning between Roseate Tern (Sterna dougallii) and Common Tern (Sterna hirundo) on Vila, an islet offshore Santa Maria Island (36. 9 ºN, 25 ºW), Azores in 1996. Twelve nests of {{each species}} were fenced and prey deliveries <b>to</b> <b>chicks</b> of both species were observed during three diurnal periods {{each day for}} 35 days. We identified all prey offered <b>to</b> <b>chicks,</b> registered whether chicks ingested prey or not and weighed chicks daily. Blue jack mackerel (Trachurus picturatus) and Atlantic sauri (Scomberosox sauri and Nanicthys simulans) were the main prey items offered <b>to</b> <b>chicks</b> by Roseate Terns, whereas Common Terns offered mainly blue jack mackerel and boarfish (Capros aper). The number of Atlantic sauri offered <b>to</b> <b>chicks</b> with more than 6 days old by both tern species decreased markedly, and the inverse occurred for blue jack mackerel and boarfish. Overall, non-ingested prey items were larger than those that were ingested, especially for chicks aged 1 - 12 days. Roseate Tern chicks showed a higher acceptance rate (frequency of prey ingested/frequency of prey offered) than did the Common Tern chicks. Acceptance rate of the chicks increased with chick age for both tern species but, overall, Roseate Tern adults made a better adjustment of prey delivered <b>to</b> <b>chicks</b> (in particular those aged 1 - 12 days) than did the Common Terns. The breeding strategy of the Roseate Tern might reflect a greater specialization on favourable marine fish species...|$|R

25|$|The American coot has a mixed {{reproductive}} strategy, and conspecific brood parasitism is {{a common}} alternative reproductive method. In one 4-year study, researchers found that 40% of nests were parasitized, and that 13% of all eggs were laid by females in nests that were not their own. Increasing reproductive success under social and ecological constraints is {{the primary reason for}} brood parasitism. Floater females without territories or nests use brood parasitism as their primary method of reproduction, if they breed at all. Other females may engage in brood parasitism if their partially complete clutches are destroyed. Conspecific brood parasitic behavior is most common among females trying to increase their total number of offspring. Food supply is the limiting factor <b>to</b> <b>chick</b> survival and starvation is {{the most common cause of}} chick morbidity. Parasitic females bypass the parental care constraint of feeding by laying additional parasitic eggs in addition to their normal nest.|$|E

He is a skilled cook, musician and graphic designer, and is also an all around friendly guy. He was originally quite crazy and uninhibited, exhibiting nudist tendencies in early Achewood strips, though {{he seems to have}} calmed down a bit over the years. While talented and intelligent, Téodor is also portrayed as lacking motivation and direction. A large exception to this is the considerable amount of time he is shown exercising or cooking, of which he is especially fond (every Achewood character has at least a slight interest in cooking, but Téodor's talent in this area is the most proficient). He had an online relationship with a girl named Penny, but it is not shown how the relationship ended up. Penny made Téodor the T-emblazoned sweater he wears, leaving it as a gift for him in the April 18, 2002, comic. While the other stuffed animals of the house treat Phillipe as a roommate, Téodor instead fills the role of Phillipe's guardian while the young otter is separated from his mother; he goes as far as to buy numerous child-care books, and, after being forced to expose the boy <b>to</b> <b>Chick</b> Tracts, diffused the effect of the prejudiced papers by making his own, nonsensical tracts to mix in with them.

40|$|We used stable {{isotopes}} (δ 15 N and δ 13 C) {{and conventional}} chick-diet sampling methods to evaluate seasonal shifts in diets of adult {{male and female}} rhinoceros auklets (Cerorhinca monocerata) and prey provided <b>to</b> <b>chicks</b> by each sex in California during 2012 - 2013. Rhinoceros auklet isotope values underwent similar shifts in both years, which differed in environmental and prey conditions. Mixing models indicated that northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax) were important prey for adults during fall/winter and juvenile rockfish spp. were important prey during incubation in both years. Adult trophic level increased between the incubation and chick-rearing periods, and mixing models indicated that adults likely ate similar prey species as those fed <b>to</b> <b>chicks</b> during both years. δ 15 N and δ 13 C {{of males and females}} were similar (P = 3 ̆e 0. 05) during most seasons. During the 2012 chick-rearing period, however, adult female diet and meals delivered <b>to</b> <b>chicks</b> by females contained more Pacific saury (Cololabis saira) and less market squid (Doryteuthis opalescens) than male diet and meals delivered <b>to</b> <b>chicks</b> by males. Chick growth and survival to fledging were less during 2012 than during 2013, likely because chicks were fed lesser quality prey or fed less frequently in 2012. Lesser body condition of females but not males during incubation in 2012 indicated that sex-specific diet and chick provisioning differences during the 2012 chick-rearing period may have been related to energetic constraints on females...|$|R

40|$|The {{relationships}} among chick feeding, size {{and type of}} prey item, and foraging {{time away from the}} brood have not been well studied in seabirds. This study investigated spatial and temporal patterns of foraging and chick-provisioning among 23 radio-tagged male common terns nesting at Hamilton Harbour, Lake Ontario during 1991 and 1992. Telemetry data were collected concurrently with behavioural observations from an elevated blind. Terns fitted with transmitters did not differ from controls with respect to either brood attendance, patterns of chick mortality, species and size distributions of prey delivered to offspring, or chick-provisioning rates. There was a clear separation of parental roles: males were primarily responsible for feeding chicks while females allocated more time to brood attendance. The prey species most commonly delivered <b>to</b> <b>chicks</b> by adults were rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax) and alewife (A/osa pseudoharengus), followed in importance by larval fish, emerald shiner (Notropis antherinoides), salmonids, and fathead minnows (Pimepha/es prome/as). The relative proportions of various fish speCies delivered <b>to</b> <b>chicks</b> by males differed over the course of each breeding season, and there was also much variability in species composition of prey between years. Sizes of prey delivered <b>to</b> <b>chicks</b> also differed between sampling periods. The modal size of fish brought <b>to</b> <b>chicks</b> during Peak 1991 was 1. 5 bill lengths, while the majority of prey in Late 1991 were small larval fish. The reverse trend occurred in 1992 when small fish were delivered <b>to</b> <b>chicks</b> predominantly during the Peak nesting period. During periods when predominantly small fish were delivered <b>to</b> <b>chicks,</b> the foraging activity of radio-tagged males was concentrated within a two kilometer radius of the colony. The observed variation in prey composition and foraging locations during the study likely reflects temporal variation in the availability of prey {{in the vicinity of the}} colony. Males delivered fish <b>to</b> <b>chicks</b> at a constant rate, while females 4 increased their feeding frequency over the first six to ten brood days. The mean length of fish delivered <b>to</b> <b>chicks</b> by adults increased significantly with increasing chick age. As a group, within each nesting period, transmittered males either foraged predominantly in the same directional bearing (north during Peak 1991, south during Late 1992), or concentrated foraging activity in the immediate vicinity of the colony (Late 1991, Peak 1992). However, individual radio-tagged males exhibited unique and predictable foraging patterns, often favouring specific locations within these areas and differing in their secondary foraging patterns. Overall, the Lake Ontario shoreline between NCB Bay" (3. 5 km south of colony) and the lift bridge canal (4 km north of colony) was the foraging area used most frequently by radiotagged males during the chick-rearing period. Foraging patterns of transmittered males at Windermere Basin are similar to patterns of peak-nesting common terns, but differ from those of late-nesters, at a nearby colony (Port Colborne, Lake Erie). Differences between the foraging patterns of late-nesting terns at these colonies likely reflect differences in annual patterns of fish availability between the two locations. No relationship was found between foraging proficiency of adults and survival of offspring. Stochastic factors, such as predation by black-crowned nightherons (Nycticorax nycticorax) and adverse weather conditions during the early stages of chick rearing, may be more important determinants of common tern breeding success than parental quality or fish availability...|$|R
