5|$|Fear of {{the loss}} of one's purpose in life is a theme in Vonnegut's works. The Great Depression forced Vonnegut to witness the devastation many people felt when they lost their jobs, and while at General Electric, Vonnegut {{witnessed}} machines being built {{to take the place of}} human labor. He confronts these <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> works through references to the growing use of automation and its effects on human society. This is most starkly represented in his first novel, Player Piano, where many Americans are left purposeless and unable to find work as machines replace human workers. Loss of purpose is also depicted in Galápagos, where a florist rages at her spouse for creating a robot able to do her job, and in Timequake, where an architect kills himself when replaced by computer software.|$|E

He claims his most difficult challenge while helping others is his ego and himself and has never accepted a dime for his efforts. Kershaw {{has said he will}} dance around anyone blocking the basic human right of clean drinking water.|$|E
25|$|After a short European tour in 2001 (which only {{consisted}} of 5 dates), {{they started to}} work on a new album. Honour - Valour - Pride was released in late 2001 on Metal Blade, and shows a progression from the direction taken on Mercenary. It contains nine tracks; the digipak includes one bonus track. Martin Kearns is now back with the band after he settled his <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> life.|$|E

25|$|The Emperor of China {{learns that}} one of the most {{beautiful}} <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> empire is the song of the nightingale. When he orders the nightingale brought to him, a kitchen maid (the only one at court who knows of its whereabouts) leads the court to a nearby forest, where the nightingale agrees to appear at court, where it remains as the Emperor's favorite. When the Emperor is given a bejeweled mechanical bird he loses interest in the real nightingale, who returns to the forest. The mechanical bird eventually breaks down; and the Emperor is taken deathly ill a few years later. The real nightingale learns of the Emperor's condition and returns to the palace; whereupon Death is so moved by the nightingale's song that he allows the Emperor to live.|$|E
25|$|But {{this time}} on the {{frontier}} was after Martin had bought a large plot of land in Henry County with his earnings working for three years as an overseer for an uncle. Martin also gained 20,000 acres of land from Patrick Henry in a surveying contest at Powell Valley. Martin's youthful adventures on the frontier were grist for later stories... {{some of which were}} written by Martin's political foes and were slanted to paint a picture of him in an unkind light. One writer, a fan of Martin's political enemy, called him lazy and refused to describe him by his military ranking. General Joseph Martin may have been many <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> lifetime, but a quick study of his history and his accomplishments show that he was far from lazy. Eventually the soldiering, trapping and Indian fighting transformed the young Martin into a fearsome explorer.|$|E
25|$|Harris was {{replaced}} by Howard S. McDonald, who had received a doctorate from the University of California. McDonald was used to an organization which placed the president {{at the head of}} decision-making, rather than a Board of Trustees. Because of this, {{he had a lot of}} trouble working with the Board, who at BYU had more power than he was accustomed to. However, he achieved several valuable <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> four-year tenure. When he first received the position, the Second World War had just ended, and thousands of students were flooding into BYU. By the end of his stay, the school had grown nearly five times to an enrollment of 5,440 students. The university did not have the facilities to handle such a large influx, so he bought part of an Air Force Base in Ogden, Utah, and rebuilt it to house some of the students. McDonald also did several other things. When asked by church leaders whether support for the college be dropped, he answered an adamant no, putting an end to the last real question of the school's survival. He also began a significant building program which was continued by his successors. McDonald resigned in 1949 in order to work at a Los Angeles College fitting his administrative style better.|$|E

500|$|Ernest Hemingway, another writer {{influenced}} by Chekhov, was more grudging: [...] "Chekhov wrote about six good stories. But {{he was an}} amateur writer." [...] And Vladimir Nabokov criticised Chekhov's [...] "medley of dreadful prosaisms, ready-made epithets, repetitions." [...] But he also declared The Lady with the Dog [...] "one of the greatest stories ever written" [...] in its depiction of a problematic relationship, and described Chekhov as writing [...] "the way one person relates to another the most important <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> life, slowly and yet without a break, in a slightly subdued voice." ...|$|E
500|$|Madgwick {{was born}} on 10 May 1905 in North Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. He was the second of three sons of Australian-born parents Richard Charlton Madgwick and Annie Jane Elston. Madgwick's father was a tram-driver in Sydney and his mother a dressmaker. Both were active members of an Anglican church. Madgwick stated later that his parents taught him that, [...] "all {{men and women were}} sacred, and poverty and {{injustice}} were in some way contrary to God's teaching." [...] Madgwick described the most important <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> young life as family, church, and school.|$|E
500|$|While at Charterhouse Vaughan Williams {{found that}} {{religion}} meant {{less and less}} to him, {{and for a while}} he was an atheist. This softened into [...] "a cheerful agnosticism", and he continued to attend church regularly to avoid upsetting the family. His views on religion did not affect his love of the Authorised Version of the Bible, the beauty of which, in the words of Ursula Vaughan Williams in her 1964 biography of the composer, remained [...] "one of his essential companions through life." [...] In this, as in many other <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> life, he was, according to his biographer Michael Kennedy, [...] "that extremely English product the natural nonconformist with a conservative regard for the best tradition".|$|E

500|$|According to Mills, his housemate in 1946–47, [...] "Dodo was {{the most}} {{dedicated}} of players. He practiced {{an incredible amount of}} hours, often all day long. He wouldn't stop to eat. He would eat at the piano with one hand and keep playing with the other. He had no other interests that I was aware of. He could play forever." [...] At this time, Marmarosa did not drink or take hard drugs, but his behavior was often eccentric. Mills reported that [...] "Dodo was just a big kid [...] He never really grew up because he never allowed anything but the piano to be important to him. The piano was his life. He heard <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> head that he wasn't able to play and it frustrated him. Once, he got mad at the old upright piano we had and chopped it up with an axe." ...|$|E
500|$|Assistant state {{attorney}} general Tom Brunker argued against clemency, stating: [...] "Mr. Gardner {{was sentenced to death}} and earned that death penalty because of his unflagging history of violent crime." [...] The family of the late George [...] "Nick" [...] Kirk recounted how his being shot by Gardner affected their lives and ultimately shortened Kirk's life. Kirk's daughter Barb Webb said, [...] "He's done a lot of horrific <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> past and I think, given the chance, he would do them all again." [...] Jason Otterstrom, whose father Melvyn was murdered by Gardner, struggled to describe the impact upon his family. After listening to the testimony from the families of the victims, the Utah Board of Pardons and Parole declined Gardner's commutation request, stating that the jury's verdict and sentence were [...] "not inappropriate." [...] The board members cited his violent record during incarceration and questioned his effort to reform as being [...] "too little, too late." [...] Gardner revealed at the hearing that it was Darcy Perry McCoy who provided him the gun with which he murdered Michael Burdell. Deputy Salt Lake County attorney Bob Stott said that McCoy would not be prosecuted because Gardner, the only witness, was going to be executed.|$|E
500|$|Another {{suggestion}} is that the Cheyenne warriors, pressed to recount details of the Custer battle, were still reluctant to admit to killing soldiers for fear of punishment. A simple {{way out of this}} dilemma was to say when questioned by non-Indians that most of the soldiers died at their own hands. Researchers Fox and Thom Hatch say that Wooden Leg retracted the claim in later life; this would have been in extreme old age, as he had still not recanted at the age of 73 when the book was written, other than to say it was whisky that was the cause rather than prayer. In his book Cheyenne Memories, John Stands In Timber, tribal historian for the Northern Cheyenne, agrees: [...] "Wooden Leg said some other <b>things</b> (<b>in</b> <b>his</b> book) he took back later. One was that the soldiers were drunk, and many killed themselves. I went with two army men to see him one time. They wanted to find out about it. I interpreted... and we asked him if it were true that the Indians said the soldiers did that. He laughed and said there were just too many Indians. The soldiers did their best. He said if they had been drunk they would not have killed as many as they did. But it was in the book." ...|$|E

2500|$|David Suzuki - Suzuki's {{appearance}} on Air Farce is memorable, as he appeared nude in the sketch (although the nudity {{was covered by}} a briefcase and later a desk), a parody of an ad campaign Suzuki participated in for his show The Nature of <b>Things.</b> <b>In</b> <b>his</b> sketch, he is interviewed, where the interviewer (Goy), aware of his nudity, is taken aback by Suzuki's apparent use of double entendres, and later faints when Suzuki asks her {{if she wanted to}} see his [...] "genetically altered banana". Suzuki, clueless to the ordeal, then produces a slightly larger-than-normal banana.|$|E
2500|$|The lockout {{also gave}} Stamkos an {{opportunity}} to do <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> hometown of Toronto he normally would not get to do. That included playing in his father's pick-up hockey league every Thursday night, when he and former Lightning forward Steve Downie would mix it up with a group that varied as much in age (22–65) as ability. On playing in his father's pick-up league, Stamkos stated, [...] "It was a blast, those guys loved it they don't get a chance to play with NHL guys very often." [...] He additionally added, [...] "It {{was a lot of fun}} and something I'll cherish forever." ...|$|E

2500|$|Another {{influence}} lay in Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. A September 1900 {{review in}} the Grand Rapids Herald called The Wonderful Wizard of Oz a [...] "veritable Alice in Wonderland brought {{up to the present}} day standard of juvenile literature". Baum found Carroll's plots incoherent, but he identified the books' source of popularity as Alice herself, a child with whom the child readers could identify; this influenced his choice of a protagonist. Baum was also influenced by Carroll's belief that children's books should have many pictures and be pleasurable to read. Carroll rejected the Victorian-era ideology that children's books should be saturated with morals, instead believing that children should be allowed to be children. Building on Carroll's style of numerous images accompanying the text, Baum combined the conventional features of a fairy tale (witches and wizards) with the well-known <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> readers' lives (scarecrows and cornfields).|$|E
2500|$|... 1989 {{proved to}} be a {{turnaround}} year for WCW, with Ric Flair on top for most of the year as both World Champion and head booker. Flair helped bring in Ricky Steamboat and Terry Funk, and his pay-per-view matches with Steamboat were financially and critically successful. Young stars such as Sid Vicious, Sting, Scott Steiner, The Road Warriors, Brian Pillman, The Great Muta and Lex Luger were given major storylines and championship opportunities. 1990, however, would be an entirely different story, as Flair would be fired from being head booker in March 1990 after WCW talent began to argue that Flair was booking <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> favor. One of these examples was Flair's refusal to drop the WCW World title to Lex Luger, as he had already promised to drop it to Sting, who himself had been injured earlier in the year. Flair was eventually replaced by Ole Anderson.|$|E
2500|$|The hygiene {{hypothesis}} {{states that}} {{infants and children}} who lack exposure to infectious agents {{are more susceptible to}} allergic diseases via modulation of immune system development. As Mary Ruebush writes in her book Why Dirt is Good, “what a child is doing when he puts <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> mouth is allowing his immune response to explore his environment. Not only does this allow for ‘practice’ of immune responses, which will be necessary for protection, but it also plays a critical role in teaching the immature immune response what is best ignored.” [...] The theory was first proposed by David P. Strachan who noted that hay fever and eczema were less common in children who belonged to large families. [...] Since then, studies have noted the effect of gastrointestinal worms on the development of allergies in the developing world. For example, a study in Gambia found that eradication of worms in some villages led to increased skin reactions to allergies among children.|$|E
