40|$|<b>Telomeres</b> prevent {{chromosome}} fusions {{and degradation}} by exonucleases and are implicated in DNA repair, homologous recombination, chromosome pairing and segregation. All these functions of <b>telomeres</b> require {{the integrity of}} their chromatin structure, which has been traditionally considered as heterochromatic. In agreement with this idea, different studies have reported that <b>telomeres</b> associate with heterochromatic marks. However, these studies addressed simultaneously the chromatin structures of <b>telomeres</b> and subtelomeric regions or the chromatin structure of <b>telomeres</b> and Interstitial Telomeric Sequences (ITSs). The independent analysis of Arabidopsis <b>telomeres,</b> subtelomeric regions and ITSs has allowed the discovery of euchromatic <b>telomeres.</b> In Arabidopsis, whereas subtelomeric regions and ITSs associate with heterochromatic marks, <b>telomeres</b> exhibit euchromatic features.

5000|$|Since shorter <b>telomeres</b> {{are thought}} {{by some to}} be a cause of aging, this raises the {{question}} of why longer <b>telomeres</b> are not selected for to ameliorate these effects. A prominent explanation suggests that inheriting longer <b>telomeres</b> would cause increased cancer rates (e.g. Weinstein and Ciszek, 2002). However, a recent literature review and analysis [...] suggests this is unlikely, because shorter <b>telomeres</b> and telomerase inactivation is more often associated with increased cancer rates, and the mortality from cancer occurs late in life when the force of natural selection is very low. An alternative explanation to the hypothesis that long <b>telomeres</b> are selected against due to their cancer promoting effects is the [...] "thrifty telomere" [...] hypothesis, which suggests that the cellular proliferation effects of longer <b>telomeres</b> causes increased energy expenditures.

5|$|Barbara McClintock (June 16, 1902 – September 2, 1992) was an American {{scientist}} and cytogeneticist who {{was awarded the}} 1983 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. McClintock received her PhD in botany from Cornell University in 1927. There she started her career as the leader {{in the development of}} maize cytogenetics, the focus of her research {{for the rest of her}} life. From the late 1920s, McClintock studied chromosomes and how they change during reproduction in maize. She developed the technique for visualizing maize chromosomes and used microscopic analysis to demonstrate many fundamental genetic ideas. One of those ideas was the notion of genetic recombination by crossing-over during meiosis—a mechanism by which chromosomes exchange information. She produced the first genetic map for maize, linking regions of the chromosome to physical traits. She demonstrated the role of the <b>telomere</b> and centromere, regions of the chromosome that are important in the conservation of genetic information. She was recognized among the best in the field, awarded prestigious fellowships, and elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1944.|$|E

40|$|Drosophila <b>telomeres</b> are sequence-independent {{structures}} {{maintained by}} transposition to chromosome ends of three specialized retroelements {{rather than by}} telomerase activity. Fly <b>telomeres</b> are protected by the terminin complex that includes the HOAP, HipHop, Moi and Ver proteins. These are fast evolving, non-conserved proteins that localize and function exclusively at <b>telomeres,</b> protecting them from fusion events. We have previously suggested that terminin is the functional analogue of shelterin, the multi-protein complex that protects human <b>telomeres.</b> Here, we use electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) to show that Ver preferentially binds single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) with no sequence specificity. We also show that Moi and Ver form a complex in vivo. Although these two proteins are mutually dependent for their localization at <b>telomeres,</b> Moi neither binds ssDNA nor facilitates Ver binding to ssDNA. Consistent with these results, we found that Ver-depleted <b>telomeres</b> form RPA and γH 2 AX foci, like the human <b>telomeres</b> lacking the ssDNA-binding POT 1 protein.

25|$|A mega-telomere (also {{known as}} an ultra-long <b>telomere</b> or a class III <b>telomere),</b> is an {{extremely}} long <b>telomere</b> sequence that sits {{on the end of}} chromosomes and prevents the loss of genetic information during cell replication.
