5|$|Allen's men marched southward {{from the}} base, with the {{intention}} of entering the enemy base camp from a slightly different direction to the west. Preceded by marching artillery fire, the 2nd Battalion stopped periodically to conduct cloverleaf patrols to their front, rear and both flanks. At 9:56am the lead element of Alpha Company stumbled upon a northeast-southwest trail, which appeared to have been used within the last hour. The 1st Platoon Leader then requested and received permission to make cloverleaf patrols to the east and west of the trail. Almost immediately, the 1st Platoon sighted a Viet Cong soldier while scouting west of the trail and another group of Viet Cong soldiers soon appeared. George then ordered the 1st Platoon to set up a hasty ambush across the trail, but {{by the time they were}} in position the Viet Cong soldiers had disappeared and everything was quiet. About 10–15 minutes later, the 1st Platoon Leader reported that trees were moving, in addition to the sound of weapons clicking and <b>the</b> <b>rattle</b> <b>of</b> ammunition.|$|E
500|$|The most {{distinctive}} {{modification of the}} snake scale is <b>the</b> <b>rattle</b> <b>of</b> rattlesnakes, {{such as those of}} the genera Crotalus and Sistrurus. The rattle is made up of a series of loosely linked, interlocking chambers that when shaken, vibrate against one another to create the warning signal of a rattlesnake. Only the bottom is firmly attached to the tip of the tail.|$|E

500|$|In 2008 Trygve Nordwall, {{the manager}} of the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, invoked new EU rules forbidding more than 85 {{decibels}} in the workplace, as a reason for dropping the planned world premiere of Dror Feiler's composition Halat Hisar (State of Siege) because it was [...] "adverse to the health" [...] of the musicians. The twenty-minute composition [...] "starts with <b>the</b> <b>rattle</b> <b>of</b> machine-gun fire and gets louder" [...] ("Das Stück beginnt mit Schüssen aus Maschinengewehren, die vom Band zugespielt werden, und das ist noch die leiseste Stelle.") Orchestra manager Trygve Nordwall reported that [...] "readings were taken during rehearsals and even when toned down, Halat Hisar measured about 130 decibels, equivalent to hearing a jet aircraft taking off", and one member of the orchestra reported suffering headaches and permanent tinnitis after sustained exposure for three hours during rehearsals ("Ein Orchestermusiker habe nach der Probe des Stückes drei Stunden lang permanente Ohrgeräusche (Tinnitus) gehabt"). Headphones for the musicians were suggested, but they objected they could not hear each other and the composer also rejected the idea, adding that his composition was [...] "no louder than anything by Shostakovich or Wagner".|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "shanty-man"—the chorister {{of the old}} packet ship—has left no successors. In {{the place}} of a rousing [...] "pulling song," [...] we now hear <b>the</b> <b>rattle</b> <b>of</b> the steam-winch; and the modern {{windlass}} worked by steam, or the modern steam-pump, gives us the clatter of cogwheels and the hiss of steam in place of the wild choruses of other days. Singing and steam are irreconcilable. The hoarse steam-whistle is the nearest approach to music that can exist in the hot, greasy atmosphere of the steam-engine.|$|E
2500|$|Though {{initially}} operant {{behavior is}} emitted without an identified {{reference to a}} particular stimulus, during operant conditioning operants come {{under the control of}} stimuli that are present when behavior is reinforced. Such stimuli are called [...] "discriminative stimuli." [...] A so-called [...] "three-term contingency" [...] is the result. That is, discriminative stimuli set the occasion for responses that produce reward or punishment. Thus, a rat may be trained to press a lever only when a light comes on; a dog rushes to the kitchen when it hears <b>the</b> <b>rattle</b> <b>of</b> its food bag; a child reaches for candy when she sees it on a table.|$|E
6000|$|After {{five minutes}} or more had passed, during which time the silence had been broken only by <b>the</b> <b>rattling</b> <b>of</b> dishes, aunt Dorcas asked, abruptly: ...|$|R

2500|$|Three former Michigan {{football}} players {{were killed in}} the war. One of the casualties was Curtis Redden, star end of Fielding Yost's [...] "Point-a-Minute" [...] teams. In April 1918, newspapers published a letter from Redden to a friend back home describing his unit's [...] "baptism of fire":"And so it went from day to day, but oftimes the nights were very bad. At night, when the infantry launched its raids, or the enemy his, or the infantry became nervous and called for help, the guns stamped like stallions and snorted their breaths of fire. The blackness of the night became a series of dots and dashes, until the world resembled a vast radio station, spelling hell, hell, and hell again. To this must be added the shriek of shells, the whistle of fragments, the automatic hammer effect of the machine gun, <b>the</b> <b>rattle</b> <b>of</b> the rifle fire, the rockets and star shells out over No Man's land—all combined to make the night weird, hideous, fascinating, sublime." ...|$|E
2500|$|Redden {{enlisted in}} the U.S. Army during World War I. [...] He served as a {{lieutenant}} colonel of the 149th Field Artillery with the Rainbow Division in France. [...] His unit {{was among the first}} to leave for France. [...] In April 1918, newspapers published a letter from Redden to a friend back home describing the Illinois artillery unit's [...] "baptism of fire."

2500|$|Only 16 {{editions of}} The United Irishman had been {{produced}} when Mitchel was arrested, {{and the paper}} suppressed. Mitchel concluded his last article in The United Irishman, from Newgate prison, entitled [...] "A Letter to Farmers", [...] "For me, I abide my fate joyfully; for I know that whatever betide me, my work is nearly done. Yes; Moral Force and 'Patience and Perseverance' are scattered to the wild winds of heaven. The music my countrymen now love best to hear is <b>the</b> <b>rattle</b> <b>of</b> arms and the ring of the rifle. As I sit here, and write in my lonely cell, I hear, just dying away, the measured tramp of ten thousand marching men—my gallant Confederates, unarmed and silent, but with hearts like bended bow, waiting till the time comes. They have marched past my prison windows {{to let me know}} that there are ten thousand fighting men in Dublin— 'felons' in heart and soul. I thank God for it. The game is afoot, at last. The liberty of Ireland may come sooner or come later, by peaceful negotiation or bloody conflict— but it is sure; and wherever between the poles I may chance to be, I will hear the crash of the down fall of the thrice-accursed British Empire." ...|$|E

50|$|The Central Catholic mascot is the Buttons {{which are}} hard, round {{protrusions}} found anterior to <b>the</b> <b>rattles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rattle</b> snake. <b>The</b> mascot {{pays tribute to}} St. Mary's University, of which the high school was originally a part of, whose mascot is <b>the</b> <b>Rattler.</b>|$|R
60|$|A heavy plunge, {{followed}} by <b>the</b> <b>rattling</b> <b>of</b> chains and swinging {{round of the}} brig, told that {{they had come to}} an anchor in the lagoon of the Cocos-Keeling Islands.|$|R

50|$|The most {{commonly}} shared theory {{says that the}} dance {{was inspired by the}} sufferings of the African slaves brought to Bolivia in order to work in the Silver Mines of Potosí. The enormous tongue of the dark masks is meant to represent the physical state of these mines workers and <b>the</b> <b>rattling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Matracas are frequently associated with <b>the</b> <b>rattling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> slaves' chains. However, {{there is no evidence that}} these African slaves actually worked in the mines, although there is much evidence that they worked in the Casa de la Moneda (mint) in the production of coins and in domestic service.|$|R
60|$|The Goth {{started from}} his reverie {{and looked up}} hastily. At that instant <b>the</b> <b>rattling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> latch recommenced as {{suddenly}} as it had ceased, and {{the air of the}} room recovered its former tranquillity.|$|R
60|$|He {{was brought}} back to himself by <b>the</b> <b>rattle</b> <b>of</b> the door-knob. Ruth was at the door.|$|E
60|$|I did {{not speak}} for a while, and <b>the</b> <b>rattle</b> <b>of</b> the plates and knives {{continued}} undisturbed.|$|E

6000|$|Now do you {{remember}} that riddle which I put to you the other day?--"What had <b>the</b> <b>rattling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lid of the kettle to do with Hartford Bridge Flat being lifted out of the ancient sea?" ...|$|R
60|$|Soon the {{schooner}} swept {{round the}} point that had hitherto shut out the view of Sandy Cove, {{and a few minutes}} later <b>the</b> <b>rattling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chain announced that the voyage of the Foam had terminated.|$|R
60|$|Jac. Now I am {{altogether}} of {{the other}} side; I can love no where but above me: Methinks <b>the</b> <b>rattling</b> <b>of</b> a coach and six sounds more eloquently than the best harangue a wit could make me.|$|R
