40|$|The goal of {{the project}} is to enhance the {{performance}} of the Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV) at the Tour de Sol race through various improvements. Although the basic structure of the HEV was unchanged, many systems in the vehicle had undergone certain degrees of modifications. The vehicle components modified included the electrical vehicle (EV) group, alignment parts for the DC motor and transmission, power steering, TV and transmission cables, Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) ignition key, transmission cooler mount, and the CNG Tank and CNG transport system. The transmission cooler mount, new brakes and drums were also installed Modifications to the EV were completed by March 2000. The EV was tested for several weeks before completing the installation of <b>the</b> <b>CNG</b> <b>system.</b> Once <b>the</b> <b>CNG</b> <b>system</b> was operation, tests were done on the HEV. Problems were encountered with virtually every system implemented by the 1998 - 1999 team. These problems were solved as they arose, and by mid-April 2000 the HEV was running and the team was taking energy usage data. This data was critical in helping to determine how the vehicle would perform in the Tour de Sol race, as the winner of the race is determined by measuring vehicle energy usage per mile driven. Barring any unforeseen catastrophes, the 1999 - 2000 team will meet its goals...|$|E
40|$|Driving on CNG is {{preferable}} to conventional fuels because of diversification of the energy mix, local availability of natural gas, the financial benefit and the transition function towards (sustain-able) biogas and emission reduction. Furthermore, the CNG technology {{is expected to be}} safer than conventional fuels, mainly because of the physical properties of natural gas. Compared to conventional fuels, driving on natural gas emits less CO 2 (compared to gasoline), NOx and PM (compared to diesel). Differences are declining due to technological improvements. The report and research is based on the differentiation of levels of scale. By enquiring the relevant factors on the different levels of scale, more insight inside the level of scale can be achieved. By observing the levels of scale all together, interactions between the different levels of scale will be clarified. For development of a CNG market, the government plays an important role. First, the government should initiate a demand by involving the use of natural gas vehicles in their own fleets. By intro-ducing long term financial incentives and environmental policies, the market should be able to evolve. According to case studies, the best-case potential CNG market penetration in the Nether-lands is estimated on 14 %, resulting in significant emission reductions. Besides this emission re-duction, the introduction of CNG as a transport fuel will pave the road for the introduction of sus-tainable produced biogas. The development of CNG is mainly dependent on the fuel costs; currently 50 % of diesel and 35 % of gasoline. But since there is no long-term tax guarantee given by the government, price of CNG may become as high as the current diesel price, eventually resulting in extinction of the CNG mar-ket. <b>The</b> <b>CNG</b> <b>system</b> discussion shows that the government fulfils an essential role in the CNG market development. This underlines the conclusion of the case studies. The government forms an essen-tial link within the cycle that is decisive for positive or negative characteristics of the cycle. With this fact taken into consideration, the CNG market formation can be positively influenced by gov-ernmental incentives and stimulating initiatives. ...|$|E

40|$|This report {{evaluates the}} hazards that {{are unique to}} a compressed-natural-gas (CNG) -fueled heavy hybrid {{electric}} vehicle (HEV) design compared with a conventional heavy vehicle. The unique design features of the heavy HEV are <b>the</b> <b>CNG</b> fuel <b>system</b> for <b>the</b> internal-combustion engine (ICE) and the electric drive system. This report addresses safety issues with <b>the</b> <b>CNG</b> fuel <b>system</b> and <b>the</b> electric drive system. Vehicles on U. S. highways have been propelled by ICEs for several decades. Heavy-duty vehicles have typically been fueled by diesel fuel, and light-duty vehicles have been fueled by gasoline. The hazards and risks posed by ICE vehicles are well understood and have been generally accepted by the public. The economy, durability, and safety of ICE vehicles have established a standard for other types of vehicles. Heavy-duty (i. e., heavy) HEVs have recently been introduced to U. S. roadways, and the hazards posed by these heavy HEVs can {{be compared with the}} hazards posed by ICE vehicles. The benefits of heavy HEV technology are based on their potential for reduced fuel consumption and lower exhaust emissions, while the disadvantages are the higher acquisition cost and the expected higher maintenance costs (i. e., battery packs). The heavy HEV is more suited for an urban drive cycle with stop-and-go driving conditions than for steady expressway speeds. With increasing highway congestion and the resulting increased idle time, the fuel consumption advantage for heavy HEVs (compared with conventional heavy vehicles) is enhanced by the HEVs' ability to shut down. Any increase in fuel cost obviously improves the economics of a heavy HEV. The propulsion system for a heavy HEV is more complex than the propulsion system for a conventional heavy vehicle. The heavy HEV evaluated in this study has in effect two propulsion systems: an ICE fueled by CNG and an electric drive system with additional complexity and failure modes. This additional equipment will result in a less reliable vehicle with a lower availability than a conventional heavy vehicle. Experience with heavy HEVs to date supports this observation. The key safety concern for the electric drive system is the higher voltages and currents that are required in the electric drive system. Faults that could expose personnel to these electric hazards must be considered, addressed, and minimized. The key issue for the CNG-fueled ICE is containment of the high-pressure natural gas. Events that can result in a release of natural gas with the possibility of subsequent ignition are of concern. These safety issues are discussed. The heavy HEV has the potential to have a safety record that is comparable to that of the conventional vehicle, but adequate attention to detail will be required...|$|R

40|$|This article aims at {{describing}} the opportunity deriving from {{the substitution of}} conventional fuels, as gasoline and diesel, with the Compressed Natural Gas (CNG), frequently indicated as methane. <b>The</b> use of <b>CNG</b> <b>systems</b> in vehicles cannot be considered the ultimate {{solution to the problem}} of pollution generated by road transport, but the advantages of this fuel are: a) 	relevant, as it concerns consumer’s expenses and ecological aspect; b) rapidly achievable, waiting for availability of new technologies capable of more relevant advantages; c) 	close to hand for several countries: Europe and U.

In fact, such countries in take-off stage on the one hand have extensive reserves of methane, and on the other hand need to cut emission urgently, specifically in areas with a high density of population. From the economic point of view CNG results a viable solution with few contraindication. The most important bottleneck is represented by a possible shortage in the distribution network. If a country is crossed by a gas pipeline this shortage could be overcome rapidly and without relevant costs. In the others the solution could be achieved either through gas carriers ships or through local production of biomethane by the exploitation of biomasses. ...|$|R
