5|$|After the {{skirmish}} was over, {{men from}} the Lampasas landed on <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> <b>to</b> secure the area and to build a landing dock. 3,300 American soldiers {{under the command of}} General Miles landed. The units that landed were the 6th Volunteer Regiments of Illinois and Massachusetts, an Artillery battalion, five battery companies, two engineer companies and a medical unit. The men who had not abandoned the barrio of Guanica swore allegiance to the United States. Garretson named Agustín Barrenechea mayor of Guanica and Simón Mejil the chief of police. On the afternoon of the 25th, Garretson left Guánica with seven companies of the 6th Massachusetts and one company of the 6th Illinois and headed towards Yauco.|$|E
5|$|Bayside: The dark, bearded Peter Fisk {{walks along}} the wooded paths {{of the island}} until {{reaching}} a beach. He strips and sunbathes on a blanket. Suddenly, out in the water, the blond naked Donovan appears and runs up onto <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> <b>to</b> Fisk. Fisk performs oral sex on Donovan, who then leads Fisk into the woods. Fisk grabs the blanket and follows, catching up to Donovan in a clearing. They kiss and touch each other, then Donovan takes a studded leather strap from Fisk's wrist and attaches it around Fisk's genitalia. They continue the scene, with each performing oral sex on the other and Donovan penetrating Fisk. Following Donovan's climax he returns to servicing Fisk orally and, as Fisk is climaxing, momentary flashes of previous scenes are intercut. The scene ends with Fisk taking the strap from his genitals and attaching it around Donovan's wrist. Fisk runs into the ocean and vanishes, mirroring Donovan's entrance. Donovan dons Fisk's abandoned clothes and heads off down the beach.|$|E
5|$|Cley {{and nearby}} Blakeney had been prosperous and {{important}} ports in the Middle Ages, but land reclamation schemes, especially those by Henry Calthorpe in 1640 {{just to the}} west of Cley, led to the silting up of the shipping channel and relocation of the wharf. Further enclosure in the mid-1820s aggravated the problem, and also allowed the shingle ridge at <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> <b>to</b> block the former tidal channel to the Salthouse marshes to the east of Cley. In an attempt to halt the decline, Thomas Telford was consulted in 1822, but his recommendations for reducing the silting were not implemented, and by 1840 almost all of Cley's trade had been lost to Blakeney and other Norfolk ports. The population stagnated, and the value of all property decreased sharply. In the mid-nineteenth century, the Lord of the Manor constructed the present road to the beach in exchange for closing the ancient right of way across the marshes.|$|E

5|$|During the Napoleonic Wars, {{the castle}} was armed with nine 36-pounder guns, {{supported}} by further artillery batteries placed along <b>the</b> <b>beach.</b> <b>To</b> protect Deal, units of infantry and cavalry, called fencibles, were formed in 1794 by William Pitt the Younger– then both the Prime Minister and the Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports– and in 1802 units of bombardiers recruited by Pitt carried out military exercises at the castle. The politician and banker Lord Carrington carried out {{improvements to the}} castle in 1802, apparently as a rival project to his friend Pitt's work at Walmer. According to Samuel Wilberforce, Carrington had hoped to charge {{the cost of the}} work to the Treasury, but when he attempted to submit the claims, they were rejected by Pitt and he had to pay for the improvements himself.|$|E
5|$|Land {{reclamation}} schemes, {{especially those}} by Henry Calthorpe in 1640 {{just to the}} west of Cley, led to the silting up of the Glaven shipping channel and relocation of Cley's wharf. Further enclosure in the mid-1820s aggravated the problem, and also allowed the shingle ridge at <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> <b>to</b> block the former tidal channel to the Salthouse marshes to the east of Cley. In an attempt to halt the decline, Thomas Telford was consulted in 1822, but his recommendations for reducing the silting were not implemented, and by 1840 almost all of Cley's trade had been lost. The population stagnated, and the value of all property decreased sharply. Blakeney's shipping trade benefited from the silting up of its nearby rival, and in 1817 the channel to the Haven was deepened to improve access. Packet ships ran to Hull and London from 1840, but this trade declined as ships became too large for the harbour.|$|E
5|$|Lara {{returns to}} the {{survivors}} on <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> <b>to</b> find that Whitman has betrayed them, abducting Sam and handing her over to Mathias. Lara, Jonah, and Reyes give chase, heading up a river in the fixed boat to the monastery, with Lara arriving {{just in time to}} see Mathias trick Whitman into approaching and speaking to some of Stormguards, who kill him. After fighting her way through both the Solarii and the Stormguard, Lara arrives at the top of the monastery where Mathias is performing the Ascension ritual. Lara fights her way to the central platform, and after a struggle, shoots Mathias off the platform to his death using both his pistol and her own in her signature dual-wielding style. Despite Mathias' death, the ritual is already underway, with Himiko's soul starting to pour into Sam. Lara then destroys Himiko's ancient remains, saving Sam and dispersing the storms.|$|E

5|$|The New Zealand Brigade {{commander}} {{had been}} taken ill, so Birdwood appointed Brigadier-General Harold Walker, a staff officer already ashore, as commander. The Auckland Battalion had landed by 12:00, and were being sent north along <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> <b>to</b> Walker's Ridge {{on their way to}} Russell's Top. Seeing that the only way along the ridge was in single file along a goat track, Walker ordered them to take the route over Plugge's Plateau. As each New Zealand unit landed they were directed the same way to Baby 700. However, in trying to avoid Turkish fire, they became split up in Monash Valley and Rest Gully, and it was after midday that two of the Auckland companies reached Baby 700.|$|E
5|$|The {{coastline}} of Normandy {{was divided}} into seventeen sectors, with codenames using a spelling alphabet—from Able, west of Omaha, to Roger on the east flank of Sword. Eight further sectors were added when the invasion was extended to include Utah. Sectors were further subdivided into beaches identified by the colors Green, Red, and White. Utah, the westernmost of the five landing beaches, is on the Cotentin Peninsula, west of the mouths of the Douve and Vire rivers. The terrain between Utah and the neighboring Omaha was swampy and difficult to cross, which meant that the troops landing at Utah would be isolated. The Germans had flooded the farmland behind Utah, restricting travel off <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> <b>to</b> a few narrow causeways. To help secure the terrain inland of the landing zone, rapidly seal off the Cotentin Peninsula, and prevent the Germans from reinforcing the port at Cherbourg, two airborne divisions were assigned to airdrop into German territory {{in the early hours}} of the invasion.|$|E
5|$|Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt, overall {{commander}} on the Western Front, {{reported to}} Hitler in October 1943 regarding the weak defences in France. This {{led to the}} appointment of Field Marshal Erwin Rommel to oversee the construction of enhanced fortifications along the Atlantic Wall, with special emphasis on the most likely invasion front, which stretched from the Netherlands to Cherbourg. Rommel believed that the Normandy coast could be a possible landing point for the invasion, so he ordered the construction of extensive defensive works along that shore. In addition to concrete gun emplacements at strategic points along the coast, he ordered wooden stakes, metal tripods, mines, and large anti-tank obstacles {{to be placed on}} <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> <b>to</b> delay the approach of landing craft and impede the movement of tanks. Expecting the Allies to land at high tide so that the infantry would spend less time exposed on the beach, he ordered many of these obstacles to be placed at the high-tide mark. The terrain at Utah is flat, offering no high ground on which to place fortifications. The shallow beach varies in depth from almost nothing to , depending on the tides. The Germans flooded the flat land behind the beach by damming up streams and opening the floodgates {{at the mouth of the}} Douve to admit seawater.|$|E

5|$|In late 1943, Hitler placed Field Marshal Erwin Rommel {{in charge}} of {{improving}} the coastal defences along the Atlantic Wall in anticipation of an Allied invasion, expected to take place sometime in 1944. Rommel believed that the Normandy coast could be a possible landing point for the invasion, so he ordered the construction of extensive defensive works along that shore. In the immediate area of Gold, between Le Hamel and La Rivière, seven defensive strongpoints designed to hold 50 men apiece were constructed. Two major concrete-reinforced coastal artillery emplacements (a battery of four 122mm guns at Mont Fleury and the Longues-sur-Mer battery, with four 150mm guns) were only partially completed by D-Day. Rommel ordered wooden stakes, metal tripods, mines, and large anti-tank obstacles {{to be placed on}} <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> <b>to</b> delay the approach of landing craft and impede the movement of tanks. Expecting the Allies to land at high tide so that the infantry would spend less time exposed on the beach, he ordered many of these obstacles to be placed at the high tide mark. Tangles of barbed wire, booby traps, and the removal of ground cover made the approach hazardous for infantry.|$|E
5|$|On September 22, 2004, Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) awakens disoriented in {{the jungle}} and notices a yellow Labrador {{retriever}} (Madison) darting through the bamboo forest. Following the path it came from, Jack runs haphazardly through the jungle to a beach, where he is confronted by the carnage of the airplane crash of Oceanic Flight 815. Jack, a surgeon, administers medical aid to the survivors, assisting the pregnant Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin), enlisting Hurley (Jorge Garcia) to watch her, and administering CPR to Rose Henderson (L. Scott Caldwell), saving her life. After the initial shock passes, Jack retreats to a quiet area beyond <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> <b>to</b> tend to his own injuries, when he notices Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) passing through the jungle. He asks her for assistance, which she gives by helping suture a wound on his back. Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) organizes a clean-up crew, while Hurley salvages meals from the plane's galley and distributes them to the survivors. Shannon Rutherford (Maggie Grace) refuses chocolate offered by her brother Boone Carlyle (Ian Somerhalder), believing that rescue is imminent. A Korean man, Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim), tells his wife, Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim), in Korean that she should remain close to him at all times.|$|E

Tangles of barbed wire, booby traps, and the removal of ground cover made the approach hazardous for infantry. On Rommel's order, the number of mines along the coast was tripled. Given the Allied air supremacy (4,029 Allied aircraft assigned to operations in Normandy plus 5,514 aircraft assigned to bombing and defence, versus 570 Luftwaffe planes stationed in France and the Low Countries), booby-trapped stakes known as Rommelspargel (Rommel's asparagus) were set up in meadows and fields to deter airborne landings.|$|E

5|$|The {{mating system}} of {{pinnipeds}} varies from extreme polygyny to serial monogamy. Of the 33 species, 20 breed on land, {{and the remaining}} 13 breed on ice. Species that breed on land are usually polygynous, as females gather in large aggregations and males are able to mate with {{them as well as}} defend them from rivals. Polygynous species include elephant seals, grey seals and most otariids. Land-breeding pinnipeds tend to mate on islands where there are fewer terrestrial predators. Few islands are favorable for breeding, and those that are tend to be crowded. Since the land they breed on is fixed, females return to the same sites for many years. The males arrive earlier in the season and wait for them. The males stay on land and try to mate with as many females as they can; some of them will even fast. If a male leaves <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> <b>to</b> feed, he will likely lose mating opportunities and his dominance. Polygynous species also tend to be extremely sexual dimorphic in favor of males. This dimorphism manifests itself in larger chests and necks, longer canines and denser fur—all traits that help males in fights for females. Increased body weight in males increases the length of time they can fast due to the ample energy reserves stored in the blubber. Larger males also likely enjoy access to feeding grounds that smaller ones are unable to access due to their lower thermoregulatory ability and decreased energy stores. In some instances, only the largest males are able to reach the furthest deepest foraging grounds where they enjoy maximum energetic yields that are unavailable to smaller males and females.|$|E
5|$|The next morning, Ashley {{plays on}} the beach and builds sand castles. When Ashley's drunken mother phones, {{demanding}} to know where her son is, Uncle David feigns ignorance, telling her that he himself is not in Sheppey but in Manchester. Taking Ashley to an abandoned military bunker, he injects an unknown substance into his nephew's vein as they kiss. Ashley enters an altered state of consciousness, and David guides him back to the caravan as they smoke marijuana. Once there, David gives Ashley a second injection, as they sit and look out at the shore. After dark, David places his near-catatonic nephew in a dog bed, showing him a copy of a picture book titled Is Britain Great?. He proceeds to give him a third and final injection, which he remarks will make Ashley lose consciousness and suffer organ failure. As Ashley dies, David professes that he has never loved anyone else as much before. The next morning, he goes onto <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> <b>to</b> place his nephew's body in a shallow grave, tearfully kissing the body goodbye before it is swept away by the sea.|$|E
5|$|Upon moving inland in east-central Florida, the {{hurricane}} produced a storm tide {{of up to}} 10feet (3m) in St. Lucie County. In New Smyrna Beach, the storm tide washed away much of <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> <b>to</b> {{the east of the}} city seawall. Overall impact from the storm tide was less than expected, due to the storm hitting at low tide. Jeanne produced peak winds of 120mph (195km/h) in a very small north of the center near Sebastian, though the National Hurricane Center noted the possibility of the strongest winds remaining over water. The National Weather Service office in Melbourne recorded sustained winds of 91mph (147km/h), which was the strongest official sustained wind reading; stronger readings were not available due to widespread power outages along its track. Wind gusts peaked at 128mph (206km/h) in Fort Pierce. In addition to the winds, {{the hurricane}} dropped heavy rainfall in the vicinity of its eyewall, peaking at 11.97inches (304mm) in Kenansville. The rainfall caused freshwater flooding, as well as increased levels along the St. Johns River. The hurricane also produced several eyewall mesovortices and tornadoes near where it moved ashore.|$|E
