5|$|Jacques I {{assumed the}} name and arms of the Grimaldi, but the French {{aristocracy}} showed scant respect towards the new prince who had risen from their ranks and chose to spend his <b>time</b> <b>absent</b> from Monaco.

5|$|Following {{the liberation}} of Monaco by the Allied forces, the 75-year-old Prince Louis did little for his principality and it began to fall into severe neglect. By 1946 he was {{spending}} {{most of his time}} in Paris, and on 27 July of that year, he married for the first <b>time.</b> <b>Absent</b> from Monaco during most of the final years of his reign, he and his wife lived on their estate in France. Prince Louis died in 1949 and was succeeded by his grandson, Prince Rainier III.|$|E
500|$|Edwards' {{political}} {{rivalry with}} Jesse B. Thomas continued {{for the rest}} of his time as governor. [...] Edwards, along with much of the legislature, criticized the territory's judges for their inactivity. Among their complaints were that the judges did not hold court often enough and spent too much <b>time</b> <b>absent</b> from the territory. The legislature passed a bill in 1814 to reform the territory's judicial system. The judges refused to acknowledge the act, claiming that they were outside the jurisdiction of the legislature. In 1815 the issue was resolved by Congress, which passed a law supporting Edwards and the legislature.|$|E
50|$|Communication between {{opposition}} members faltered and palace {{leadership was}} at <b>times</b> <b>absent,</b> leaving {{local governments to}} deal with the protests as they saw fit. Some even joined the movement in absence of central government. These protests escalated from the countryside until they reached the capital, Kathmandu. After the army killed protesters in Patan in early April, the movement gathered some 2,00,000 people who marched in protest of the monarchy in the capital.|$|R
60|$|Third and last, was Yoomy, or the Warbler. A youthful, long-haired, blue-eyed minstrel; all {{fits and}} starts; at <b>times,</b> <b>absent</b> of mind, and wan of cheek; but always very neat and pretty in his apparel; wearing the most {{becoming}} of turbans, a Bird of Paradise feather its plume, and sporting the gayest of sashes. Most given was Yoomy to amorous melodies, and rondos, and roundelays, very witching to hear. But at times disdaining the oaten reed, like a clarion he burst forth with lusty lays {{of arms and}} battle; or, in mournful strains, sounded elegies for departed bards and heroes.|$|R

50|$|In {{the history}} of sex, the social {{construction}} of sexual behavior—its taboos, regulation and social and political effects—has {{had a profound effect on}} women in the world since prehistoric <b>times.</b> <b>Absent</b> assured ways of controlling reproduction, women have practised abortion since ancient times; many societies have also practise infanticide to ensure the survival of older children. Historically, it is unclear how often the ethics of abortion (induced abortion) was discussed in societies. In the later half of the 20th century, some nations began to legalize abortion. This controversial subject has sparked heated debate and in some cases violence, as different parts of society have differing social and religious ideas about its meaning.|$|R

60|$|Well, my {{grandfather}} had been for some <b>time</b> <b>absent</b> from his room, and was returning, perfectly cool, when just {{as he reached the}} door he heard a strange noise within.

60|$|However, no {{sign from}} Colonel Grau was {{received}} that day. Patsy {{went to bed}} with a nervous headache and left Uncle John and the captain to smoke more than was good for them. Both the men had now come to regard their situation as serious and as the American consul was at this <b>time</b> <b>absent</b> in Brussels they {{could think of no}} way to secure their freedom. No one knew when the consul would return; Mr. Merrick had been refused the privilege of using the telegraph or mails. During one of their strolls they had met the correspondent of an American newspaper, but when the man learned they were suspects he got away from them as soon as possible. He did not know Mr. Merrick and his own liberty was too precarious for him to argue with Colonel Grau.|$|E
6000|$|On his father's death Florac went to Paris, {{to settle}} {{the affairs of the}} {{paternal}} succession; and, having been for some <b>time</b> <b>absent</b> in his native country, returned to Rosebury for the winter, to resume that sport of which he was a distinguished amateur. He hunted in black during the ensuing season; and, indeed, henceforth laid aside his splendid attire and his allurements as a young man. His waist expanded, or was no longer confined by the cestus which had given it a shape. When he laid aside his black, his whiskers, too, went into a sort of half-mourning, and appeared in grey. [...] "I make myself old, my friend," [...] he said, pathetically; [...] "I have no more neither twenty years nor forty." [...] He went to Rosebury Church no more; but, with great order and sobriety, drove every Sunday to the neighbouring Catholic chapel at C---- Castle. We had an ecclesiastic or two to dine with us at Rosebury, one of whom I inclined to think was Florac's director.|$|E

40|$|Moral issues {{greet the}} {{business}} community constantly, confronting us with problems on handling accounting rules that can determine a company’s future. We are bombarded with news regarding fraudulent activities in companies that mishandled accounting rules leading to undermining the confidence of customers, employees, suppliers, shareholders and the community. Dealing with ethical issues is often perplexing and without {{the benefits of a}} decision making model underlined by ethical positions we may be apt to repeat our old ways. Further, value and belief systems are often <b>times</b> <b>absent</b> and not connected to a decision making model in a useful manner. We argue for a modification of decision-making models that has been accepted in companies with stronger links with ethics and morality. With this aim we propose a return to the base values of Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Judaism, and Islam by scriptures, underlying six dominant ethical approaches that drive practices in organizations. ...|$|R

6000|$|The {{consciousness}} of the unworthy part he was acting toward these ladies had come at last to poison the pleasure of Tonelli's wooing, even in Carlotta's presence; yet I suppose he would still have let his wedding-day come and go, and been married beyond hope of atonement, so loath was he to inflict upon himself and them the pain of an explanation, if one day, {{within a week of}} that time, the notary had not bade his clerk dine with him on the morrow. It was a holiday, and as Carlotta was at home, making ready for the marriage, Tonelli consented to take his place at the table from which he had been a long <b>time</b> <b>absent.</b> But it turned out such a frigid and melancholy banquet as never was known before. The old notary, to whom all things came dimly, finally missed the accustomed warmth of Tonelli's fun, and said, with a little shiver, [...] "Why, what ails you, Tonelli?

60|$|Now {{although}} all these learned men were filing {{out of the}} lecture-room {{under the impression that}} they had seen nothing of note, {{as a matter of fact}} one of the most wonderful things in the whole history of the world had just occurred before their very eyes Professor von Baumgarten had been so far correct in his theory that both his spirit and that of his pupil had been for a <b>time</b> <b>absent</b> from his body. But here a strange and unforeseen complication had occurred. In their return the spirit of Fritz von Hartmann had entered into the body of Alexis von Baumgarten, and that of Alexis von Baumgarten had taken up its abode in the frame of Fritz von Hartmann. Hence the slang and scurrility which issued from the lips of the serious Professor, and hence also the weighty words and grave statements which fell from the careless student. It was an unprecedented event, yet no one knew of it, least of all those whom it concerned.|$|E
60|$|Hannibal began now to form his plans, {{in a very}} {{deliberate}} and cautious manner, for a march into Italy. He knew well {{that this was an}} expedition of such magnitude and duration as to require beforehand the most careful and well-considered arrangements, both for the forces which were to go, and for the states and communities which were to remain. The winter was coming on. His first measure was to dismiss a large portion of his forces, that they might visit their homes. He told them that he was intending some great designs for the ensuing spring, which might take them to a great distance, and keep them for a long <b>time</b> <b>absent</b> from Spain, and he would, accordingly, give them the intervening time to visit their families and their homes, and to arrange their affairs. This act of kind consideration and confidence renewed the attachment of the soldiers to their commander, and they returned to his camp in the spring not only with new strength and vigor, but with redoubled attachment to the service in which they were engaged.|$|E

40|$|Northern auroral {{regions of}} Earth were imaged using the High-Resolution Camera (HRC- 1) aboard the Chandra X-Ray Observatory (CXO) at 10 epochs (each approx. 20 min duration) between mid-December 2003 and mid-April 2004.

60|$|They {{continued}} their hunting, shifting their camp occasionally {{until it was}} time to rejoin the Ostjaks, and then travelled east. They struck the river some thirty miles below the camp, crossed at once and travelled up the other side until they arrived at the huts. They were heartily welcomed by the natives, and remained there for three days to rest the dogs. They were very glad of getting a supply of fish again. These the Ostjaks had in abundance, as they kept their frozen piles for food when the keenness of the wind rendered the cold so bitter that they were forced to remain in their huts. At other times they fished by torch-light at holes that they kept broken in the ice, spearing the fish, which were attracted by the light. The Ostjaks were surprised at the large number of skins, some of them of the most valuable kind, that Godfrey had brought back, and were impatient for a fresh start. They were this <b>time</b> <b>absent</b> for only six weeks, returning at the beginning of May. The hunt was marked by no adventure. They did fairly well, but were not fortunate in securing any skins of the black fox and but few of the sable.|$|E
60|$|Cambyses and {{his friends}} had been right in their conjectures that it was Smerdis the magian who had usurped the Persian throne. This Smerdis resembled, it was said, the son of Cyrus in his {{personal}} appearance {{as well as in}} name. The other magian who had been associated with him in the regency when Cambyses set out from Persia on his Egyptian campaign was his brother. His name was Patizithes. When Cyrus had been some <b>time</b> <b>absent,</b> these magians, having in the mean time, perhaps, heard unfavorable accounts of his conduct and character, and knowing the effect which such wanton tyranny must have in alienating from him the allegiance of his subjects, conceived the design of taking possession of the empire in their own name. The great distance of Cambyses and his army from home, and his long-continued absence, favored this plan. Their own position, too, as they were already in possession of the capitals and the fortresses of the country, aided them; and then the name of Smerdis, being the same with that of the brother of Cambyses, was a circumstance that greatly promoted the success of the undertaking. In addition to all these general advantages, the cruelty of Cambyses was the means of furnishing them with a most opportune occasion for putting their plans into execution.|$|E
60|$|About this Time my Company, {{with the}} rest of the Regiment, was order'd down into Flanders, and having been a {{considerable}} <b>Time</b> <b>absent</b> I was commanded to attend there. My Brother-in-law who was one of the Robe in his own Country, and unacquainted with the Wars, yet was moved with a certain Curiosity to see a Campaign, and tho' much against my Sister's Will, resolv'd to accompany me into Flanders; yet his Principal Motive was to make a Halt at Doway, whither he had been invited some time before by a near Relation belonging to the Scotch College in that University. We went together in the Cambray Coach, and after a short stay at Doway, we proceeded on to the Army, which then was under that expert and resolute General the Duke of Luxembourg. It was certainly a kind impulse of Heaven that gave me my Brother for a Companion upon this Occasion; for an Action happening soon after, viz. the famous Battle of Launden, where it was my Misfortune to be dangerously wounded. I had the Satisfaction of my Brother's Company and Assistance during a tedious Sickness, which was the Consequence of my Wounds. The French were no great Gainers by this Battle, though they at long run routed the Enemy, and kept the Field; for besides the great loss they sustain'd during the Attack, which far exceeded that of the Allies, the Victory was not well pursu'd. It was my Post to reinforce a Party of French Fusiliers, who were order'd to Storm the Intrenchmenent, in which Service a Bullet was lodg'd in my Shoulder, which besides disabling me on one Side, the loss of Blood I suffer'd was so great, that I was not able to support my self, but drop'd down and had been trampled to Death under my own Mens Feet, had not a strong Body'd Drummer hurried me out of the Croud upon his Back; but he carried me off with such Precipitation, that one of the Enemies Troopers seeing me at a Distance, and thinking me to be somebody of Consequence, sprung after me upon his Gelding, and carried both me and the Drummer into a Village on the left Hand of the Attack, where several Squadrons were posted. The commanding Officer who was a Colonel of the English Guards, finding, I was of the British Nation, order'd me to be laid in a Barn with a Centinel to guard me, and the Surgeon of the Regiment was immediately call'd for to dress and tie up my Wounds. I had not been in that Lodging above an Hour, but the Village was attack'd by the French Gens d'Arms, and there was a Tryal of Skill between the Flower of both the Armies, in which Action the French at last were Superior, so I was releas'd, but it was equal to me in the Condition I was in whose Hands I fell into, for I had so many fainting Fits which succeeded one another, that I expected not to survive any of 'em. My Brother, whom I desired to go to Loraine during the Action had a Mind to be a little nearer, so remain'd with the Baggage, but met not with me till the next Day, that we both went in a Waggon to his Lodgings in Loraine, where I was confin'd three Months before I was able to Travel.|$|E
500|$|Pretorius {{stepped down}} as President in November 1871. In the 1872 {{election}} Kruger's preferred candidate, William Robinson, was decisively defeated by the Reverend Thomas François Burgers, a church minister from the Cape who was noted for his eloquent preaching but controversial for some because of his liberal interpretation of the scriptures. He {{did not believe in}} the Devil, for example. Kruger publicly accepted Burgers's election, announcing at his inauguration that [...] "as a good republican" [...] he submitted to the vote of the majority, but he had grave personal reservations regarding the new President. He particularly disliked Burgers's new education law, which restricted children's religious instruction to outside school hours—in Kruger's view an affront to God. This, coupled with the sickness of Gezina and their children with malaria, caused Kruger to lose interest in his office. In May 1873 he requested an honourable discharge from his post, which Burgers promptly granted. The office of Commandant-General was abolished the following week. Kruger moved his main residence to Boekenhoutfontein, near Rustenburg, and for a <b>time</b> <b>absented</b> himself from public affairs.|$|R
