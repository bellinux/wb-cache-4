5|$|Bates {{put forward}} the {{hypothesis}} that the close resemblance between unrelated species was an antipredator adaptation. He noted that some species showed very striking coloration, and flew in a leisurely manner, almost as if taunting predators to eat them. He reasoned that these butterflies were unpalatable to birds and other insectivores, and were thus avoided by them. He extended <b>this</b> <b>logic</b> to forms that closely resembled such protected species, mimicking their warning coloration but not their toxicity.|$|E
5|$|Gasking {{asserted}} {{that the creation of}} the world is the most marvellous achievement imaginable. The merit of such an achievement is the product of its quality and the creator's disability: the greater the disability of the creator, the more impressive the achievement. Non-existence, Gasking asserts, would be the greatest handicap. Therefore, if the universe is the product of an existent creator, we could conceive of a greater being—one which does not exist. A non-existent creator is greater than one which exists, so God does not exist. Gasking's proposition that the greatest disability would be non-existence is a response to Anselm's assumption that existence is a predicate and perfection. Gasking uses <b>this</b> <b>logic</b> to assume that non-existence must be a disability.|$|E
5|$|The thorax is a tagma {{composed}} of three sections, the prothorax, mesothorax and the metathorax. The anterior segment, {{closest to the}} head, is the prothorax, with the major features being the first pair of legs and the pronotum. The middle segment is the mesothorax, with the major features being the second pair of legs and the anterior wings. The third and most posterior segment, abutting the abdomen, is the metathorax, which features the third pair of legs and the posterior wings. Each segment is dilineated by an intersegmental suture. Each segment has four basic regions. The dorsal surface is called the tergum (or notum) to distinguish it from the abdominal terga. The two lateral regions are called the pleura (singular: pleuron) and the ventral aspect is called the sternum. In turn, the notum of the prothorax is called the pronotum, the notum for the mesothorax is called the mesonotum and the notum for the metathorax is called the metanotum. Continuing with <b>this</b> <b>logic,</b> the mesopleura and metapleura, {{as well as the}} mesosternum and metasternum, are used.|$|E

25|$|A {{major force}} behind {{intuitionism}} was L.E.J. Brouwer, who rejected {{the usefulness of}} formalized logic of any sort for mathematics.

25|$|While it {{has been}} argued by Westerners that the reforms {{introduced}} by the CPC under Deng were a rejection of the party's Marxist heritage and ideology, the CPC does not view it as such. The rationale behind the reforms was that the productive forces of China lagged behind the advanced culture and ideology developed by the party-state. In 1986, to end this deficiency, the party {{came to the conclusion that}} the main contradiction in Chinese society was that between the backward productive forces and the advanced culture and ideology of China. By doing this, they deemphasized class struggle, and contradicted both Mao and Karl Marx, who both considered that class struggle was the main focus of the communist movement. According to <b>this</b> <b>logic,</b> thwarting the CPC's goal of advancing productive forces was synonymous with class struggle. The classical goal of class struggle was declared by Deng to have been achieved in 1976. While Mao had also emphasized the need to develop productive forces, under Deng it became paramount.|$|E

25|$|Prior to Krugman's work, trade theory (see David Ricardo and Heckscher–Ohlin model) {{emphasized}} trade {{based on}} the comparative advantage of countries with very different characteristics, such as {{a country with a}} high agricultural productivity trading agricultural products for industrial products from a country with a high industrial productivity. However, in the 20th century, an ever-larger share of trade occurred between countries with similar characteristics, which is difficult to explain by comparative advantage. Krugman's explanation of trade between similar countries was proposed in a 1979 paper in the Journal of International Economics, and involves two key assumptions: that consumers prefer a diverse choice of brands, and that production favors economies of scale. Consumers' preference for diversity explains the survival of different versions of cars like Volvo and BMW. However, because of economies of scale, it is not profitable to spread the production of Volvos all over the world; instead, it is concentrated in a few factories and therefore in a few countries (or maybe just one). <b>This</b> <b>logic</b> explains how each country may specialize in producing a few brands of any given type of product, instead of specializing in different types of products.|$|E

First, he argues that such necessary propositions are necessarily true only if such a being exists: If a triangle exists, it must have three angles. The necessary proposition, he argues, does not make the existence of a triangle necessary. Thus he argues that, if the proposition [...] "X exists" [...] is posited, it would follow that, if X exists, it exists necessarily; {{this does not mean that}} X exists in reality. Second, he argues that contradictions arise only when the subject and predicate are maintained and, therefore, a judgement of non-existence cannot be a contradiction, as it denies the predicate.|$|E
500|$|A {{result of}} the enshrinement debate was that the Ministry of the Interior {{concentrated}} on distinctions of [...] "religion" [...] and [...] "doctrine", stating that [...] "Shinto rituals (shinsai) are performed by the state whereas religious doctrines (kyōhō) are {{to be followed by}} individuals and families." [...] Through <b>this</b> <b>logic,</b> Shinto rituals were a civic responsibility which all Japanese subjects were expected to participate in, whereas [...] "religious" [...] Shinto was a matter of personal faith and subject to freedom of religion. This debate marked an early failure in crafting of a unified national Shinto practice, and led to a sharp decline in both state grants to Shinto shrines and to the appointment of Shinto priests to government positions. The Ministry of Home Affairs took responsibility for shrines in 1877, and began to separate Shinto religious practices from indoctrination. In 1887, the Ministry stopped financial support for most shrines, aside from select Imperial shrines tied to state functions.|$|E
