During the late 1980s, Hogg formed <b>The</b> <b>Rhythm</b> Snakes with Clayton Black on drums, Howie Smallman on harmonica, and Bob Thorne on guitar. In 1989, Hogg assembled a studio band to record a solo album with Thorne, Mark Alderman on harmonica, Ian Ironside on drums, Bob Patient on piano, and Bernie Payne on saxophone. Steve Hogg died on 20 July 1990 and his album, Various Fools & Vices, was released in 1992.|$|E

5|$|Davis led a septet at the concert; saxophonist Sonny Fortune, bassist Michael Henderson, and guitarist Pete Cosey {{were given}} space to improvise against a dense {{backdrop}} of riffs, electronic effects, cross-beats, and funk grooves from <b>the</b> <b>rhythm</b> section—drummer Al Foster, guitarist Reggie Lucas, and percussionist James Mtume. Davis controlled their rhythmic and musical direction with hand and head gestures, phrases played on his wah-wah processed trumpet, and drones from an accompanying electronic organ. The evolving {{nature of the}} performance led to the widespread misunderstanding {{that it had no}} compositional basis, while its dark, angry, and somber musical qualities were seen as a reflection of the musician's emotional and spiritual state at the time.|$|E
5|$|Despite these setbacks, <b>the</b> <b>rhythm</b> game market {{continues}} to expand, introducing {{a number of}} danced-based games like Ubisoft's Just Dance and Harmonix's Dance Central that incorporate the use of motion controllers and camera-based controls like the Kinect.

5|$|Hard rock {{is a form}} of loud, {{aggressive}} rock music. The {{electric guitar}} is often emphasised, used with distortion and other effects, both as a rhythm instrument using repetitive riffs with a varying degree of complexity, and as a solo lead instrument. Drumming characteristically focuses on driving rhythms, strong bass drum and a backbeat on snare, sometimes using cymbals for emphasis. The bass guitar works in conjunction with the drums, occasionally playing riffs, but usually providing a backing for <b>the</b> <b>rhythm</b> and lead guitars. Vocals are often growling, raspy, or involve screaming or wailing, sometimes in a high range, or even falsetto voice.|$|E

5|$|In the US {{the song}} was {{released}} as a radio-only single, and was therefore ineligible to chart on the Billboard Hot 100 and Hot R/Hip-Hop Songs. However, it peaked at number five on the US Billboard Hot 100 Airplay and number nine on the Hot Dance Club Songs charts. Author Fred Bronson noted it likely {{would have been the}} album's eighth top ten hit if a commercial product had been distributed. In Australia, the song received a commercial release, and peaked at number 94 on the ARIA Singles Chart in July 1991.

When the band was first being signed to CBS Records, they refused to sign the band unless Mullen was fired. He was not, and as a result, his drumming became more integrated into the song structures. His experiences in the Artane Boys Band reportedly heavily contributed to the martial beat featured in many of U2's songs, helping to evoke military imagery.|$|E

5|$|Later in the game's development, Chahi added laser pistols, {{including}} the one that Lester carries for several effects.

Chahi would later add in the plasma ball that increased the available strategy to players. Several points in the game use elevators or teleporters to move Lester between levels; Chahi had used these instead of stairways, as it was difficult to produce proper animation for these.|$|E
5|$|Moman {{moved away}} from the usual Presley pop {{recordings}} aimed at an established audience. A developer of the Stax Records sound, he incorporated a Memphis sound integrating soul, country, gospel and rural and electric blues. Many arrangements lean heavily on <b>the</b> <b>rhythm</b> section, with lesser contributions from strings, brass and woodwinds. Arrangers Green Spreen and Mike Leech changed Presley's image on the tracks with the addition of violas, cellos and French horns. The arrangers intended to blend the tracks for a distinctive sound; the strings are used in counterpoint, rising when the track fades and vice versa. The violas play the same lines as the French horns, with cello used for darker tones. Syncopation was incorporated by bowing.|$|E

40|$|A {{method has}} been devised for observing both {{circadian}} and noncircadian rhythms {{in a single}} wild type strain of Neurospora crassa. This method allows a direct comparison of {{the properties of the}} two types of <b>rhythm.</b> <b>The</b> circadian <b>rhythm</b> of conidiation always entrains to a light-dark cycle, damps out in constant light, and has a temperature-compensated period length. <b>The</b> noncircadian <b>rhythm</b> of hyphal branching, expressed by the same strain under different environmental conditions, does not entrain to a light-dark cycle, persists in constant light, and its period length is temperature-dependent. These results suggest that <b>the</b> two <b>rhythms</b> have different underlying mechanisms and demonstrate that the differences in <b>the</b> <b>rhythms</b> previously observed in different strains (patch, band, and clock) are not due to genetic differences between these strains but rather are inherent properties of <b>the</b> <b>rhythms</b> themselves...|$|R

5|$|Over the {{instrumental}} passage, the tabla rhythm switches to a 10-beat jhaptal cycle. A musical dialogue ensues in 5/4 time, first between the dilruba and sitar, then between a Western string section and sitar. The interplay between these lead instruments adheres to the call-and-response tradition of Indian classical music, known as jawab-sawal. The passage resolves in melodic unison as the instruments together state a rhythmic cadence, or tihai, {{to close the}} middle segment. After this, the drone is again prominent as <b>the</b> <b>rhythm</b> returns to 16-beat tintal for the final verse and chorus. On the finished recording, the tonal and spiritual tension is relieved by the inclusion of muted canned laughter.|$|E

Although the game's sales were considered respectable, with {{more than half a million}} units sold during its first month of release in the United States, analysts had projected larger sales volumes and attributed the lower sales to waning interest in <b>the</b> <b>rhythm</b> game genre and the video game industry recovery from the late-2000s recession.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Circadian {{rhythms of}} {{flashing}} and glow were recorded simultaneously in Gonyaulax polyedra by determining maximum and minimum light emission at each measured interval of 28 sec. In constant light, <b>the</b> two <b>rhythms</b> {{in some cases}} showed different period lengths (&tau;), <b>the</b> glow <b>rhythm</b> being up to 1 hr shorter than <b>the</b> flashing <b>rhythm.</b> Lower temperatures shortened the &tau; of <b>the</b> glow <b>rhythm</b> more than that of <b>the</b> flashing <b>rhythm.</b> <b>The</b> amplitude of <b>the</b> flashing <b>rhythm</b> decreased when <b>the</b> temperature was increased from 15 &deg;C to 25 &deg;C, whereas that of <b>the</b> glow <b>rhythm</b> was increased.

5|$|The kulintang player’s {{ability to}} improvise within the {{parameters}} of a rhythmic mode is a must.

This occurs at the discretion of the kulintang player. Therefore, the kulintang player functions not only as the one carrying the melody, but also as the conductor of the entire ensemble.
