40|$|A {{two-stage}} {{general population}} study of affective disorder {{and problems of}} eating control in 15 - 19 -year-old girls is in progress, the sample being identified {{by the use of}} general practitioners' age-sex registers. So far, 244 girls and their mothers have been interviewed and have independently completed questionnaires relating to mood and appetite control. The girls completed questionnaires both <b>on</b> <b>themselves</b> and <b>on</b> their mothers, and their mothers <b>on</b> <b>themselves</b> and <b>on</b> their daughters. Significant correlations between self-rating and rating of the other person were obtained in all cases, with agreement on the daughters' mood being higher in non-manual couples...|$|R

5000|$|The Third-person effect [...] {{hypothesis}} {{predicts that}} {{people tend to}} perceive that mass media messages have a greater effect on others than <b>on</b> <b>themselves,</b> based <b>on</b> personal biases. Because of this perception, people tend {{to take action to}} counteract the messages’ influence. The Third-person effect manifests itself through an individual’s overestimation of the effect of a mass communicated message on the generalized other, or an underestimation of the effect of a mass communicated message <b>on</b> <b>themselves.</b>|$|R
5|$|However, in 2005 Katja Seipel and Volker Schmid {{suggested}} that cnidarians and ctenophores are simplified descendants of triploblastic animals, since ctenophores and the medusa stage of some cnidarians have striated muscle, which in bilaterians {{arises from the}} mesoderm. They did not commit <b>themselves</b> <b>on</b> whether bilaterians evolved from early cnidarians or from the hypothesized triploblastic ancestors of cnidarians.|$|E

5|$|Life for the {{ordinary}} {{soldiers of the}} garrison was tedious and harsh, with corporal punishment administered {{for even the most}} trivial offences.

5|$|The {{development}} of autonomous robots capable of constructing intricate structures without human assistance has {{been inspired by}} the complex mounds that termites build. These robots work independently and can move by <b>themselves</b> <b>on</b> a tracked grid, capable of climbing and lifting up bricks.
