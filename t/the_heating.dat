25|$|Another {{parameter}} {{that concerns}} the thermal conductivity of <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> sink material is spreading resistance. Spreading resistance occurs when thermal energy {{is transferred from}} a small area to a larger area in a substance with finite thermal conductivity. In a heat sink, this means that heat does not distribute uniformly through <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> sink base. <b>The</b> spreading resistance phenomenon is shown by how <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> travels from <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> source location and causes a large temperature gradient between <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> source and <b>the</b> edges of <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> sink. This means that some fins are at a lower temperature than if <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> source were uniform across the base of <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> sink. This nonuniformity increases <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> sink's effective thermal resistance.|$|R

5|$|Because {{glass is}} very brittle in its solid state, {{it is often}} prone to {{cracking}} upon heating and cooling, especially if <b>the</b> <b>heating</b> and cooling are uneven. This is because the brittleness of glass {{does not allow for}} uneven thermal expansion. Glass that has been welded will usually need to be cooled very slowly and evenly through the glass transition, in a process called annealing, to relieve any internal stresses created by a temperature gradient.|$|E

40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a method and a device for recovering heat from an internal combustion engine, in particular of a motor vehicle, and for converting <b>the</b> recovered <b>heat</b> into mechanical energy {{by means of}} a rankine cycle-type expansion machine.

5|$|Inside, the {{building}} held a two-story balconied main sanctuary and dining room, {{in addition to}} the basement kitchen and bathrooms. <b>The</b> <b>heating</b> system was in a sub-basement.

5|$|While some 19th-century {{experiments}} {{suggested that}} the underlying premise is true if <b>the</b> <b>heating</b> is sufficiently gradual, according to contemporary biologists the premise is false: a frog that is gradually heated will jump out.

5|$|All major moons {{comprise}} {{approximately equal}} amounts rock and ice, except Miranda, {{which is made}} primarily of ice. The ice component may include ammonia and carbon dioxide. Their surfaces are heavily cratered, though all of them (except Umbriel) show signs of endogenic resurfacing {{in the form of}} lineaments (canyons) and, in the case of Miranda, ovoid race-track like structures called coronae. Extensional processes associated with upwelling diapirs are likely responsible for the origin of the coronae. Ariel appears to have the youngest surface with the fewest impact craters, while Umbriel's appears oldest. A past 3:1 orbital resonance between Miranda and Umbriel and a past 4:1 resonance between Ariel and Titania are thought to be responsible for <b>the</b> <b>heating</b> that caused substantial endogenic activity on Miranda and Ariel.|$|E
40|$|The system {{eliminates}} {{the necessity of}} shielding an aircraft airframe constructed of material such as aluminum.

5|$|Along with {{carnotite}} and roscoelite, vanadinite {{is one of}} {{the main}} industrial ores of the element vanadium, which can be extracted by roasting and smelting. Vanadinite is also occasionally used as a source of lead. A common process for extracting the vanadium begins with <b>the</b> <b>heating</b> of vanadinite with salt (NaCl) or sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) at about 850°C to produce sodium vanadate (NaVO3). This is dissolved in water and then treated with ammonium chloride to give an orange-coloured precipitate of ammonium metavanadate. This is then melted to form a crude form of vanadium pentoxide (V2O5). Reduction of vanadium pentoxide with calcium gives pure vanadium.|$|E

As the team regroups, Walter fully admits to killing Hoffman, a crime in itself, but Broyles (Lance Reddick) decides to let Walter go.

5|$|Because of its low {{atomic number}} and very low {{absorption}} for X-rays, {{the oldest and}} {{still one of the}} most important applications of beryllium is in radiation windows for X-ray tubes. Extreme demands are placed on purity and cleanliness of beryllium to avoid artifacts in the X-ray images. Thin beryllium foils are used as radiation windows for X-ray detectors, and the extremely low absorption minimizes <b>the</b> <b>heating</b> effects caused by high intensity, low energy X-rays typical of synchrotron radiation. Vacuum-tight windows and beam-tubes for radiation experiments on synchrotrons are manufactured exclusively from beryllium. In scientific setups for various X-ray emission studies (e.g., energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy) the sample holder is usually made of beryllium because its emitted X-rays have much lower energies (~100eV) than X-rays from most studied materials.|$|E
40|$|A new top-heat-type heat {{transport}} loop has been constructed. It {{consists of a}} heated section, a cooled section, a reservoir, two valves and tubes connecting these components.

5|$|Currently Ariel is not {{involved}} in any orbital resonance with other Uranian satellites. In the past, however, it may have been in a 5:3 resonance with Miranda, which could have been partially responsible for <b>the</b> <b>heating</b> of that moon (although the maximum heating attributable to a former 1:3 resonance of Umbriel with Miranda was likely about three times greater). Ariel may have once been locked in the 4:1 resonance with Titania, from which it later escaped. Escape from a mean motion resonance is much easier for the moons of Uranus than for those of Jupiter or Saturn, due to Uranus's lesser degree of oblateness. This resonance, which was likely encountered about 3.8 billion years ago, would have increased Ariel's orbital eccentricity, resulting in tidal friction due to time-varying tidal forces from Uranus. This would have caused warming of the moon's interior by as much as 20K.|$|E
5|$|McLamore and Edgerton {{acquired}} {{a license to}} operate an Insta-Burger King franchise and opened their first location on 4 December 1954 at 3090 NW 36th Street in Miami. By 1959, the pair had stores at several locations within the Miami-Dade area, and operations were growing at a fast rate. However, the partners discovered that the insta-broiler units' heating elements were prone to degradation from the drippings of the beef patties. The pair eventually created a mechanized gas grill that avoided the problems by cooking the meat patties a different way inside the unit. The new cooking appliance, which they called a flame broiler, moved the patties over the flame vertically on a chain link conveyor over <b>the</b> <b>heating</b> elements, a design that imparted grill lines on the patties similar to those made on a charcoal grill. The new unit worked so well that they {{made the decision to}} replace all of their Insta-Broilers with the newly designed unit.|$|E
5|$|Over {{elevated}} surfaces, heating of {{the ground}} exceeds <b>the</b> <b>heating</b> of the surrounding air at the same altitude above sea level, creating an associated thermal low over the terrain and enhancing any thermal lows that would have otherwise existed, and changing the wind circulation of the region. In areas where there is rugged topography that significantly interrupts the environmental wind flow, the wind circulation between mountains and valleys {{is the most important}} contributor to the prevailing winds. Hills and valleys substantially distort the airflow by increasing friction between the atmosphere and landmass by acting as a physical block to the flow, deflecting the wind parallel to the range just upstream of the topography, which is known as a barrier jet. This barrier jet can increase the low level wind by 45%. Wind direction also changes because of the contour of the land.|$|E

30|$|As {{industrial}} and technological products demand higher standards of function and capacity, <b>the</b> problem of <b>heat</b> dissipation from electrical appliances becomes a significant issue.
