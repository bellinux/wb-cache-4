2500|$|The {{purpose of}} that {{project is to}} {{assemble}} descriptions {{of the range of}} conceptual approaches which are considered integrative and which are held by some international constituencies to provide a key for strategic response to the global problematique. Buzzwords like [...] "global", [...] "networking" [...] and [...] "systematic" [...] are often used as magical [...] "words-of-power". Nevertheless, in a society characterized by specialization, fragmentation, disparateness, or opposition, integrative approaches until now have proved inadequate or too difficult to implement. In order to go beyond that difficulty, it seems necessary to creatively introduce novelties, such as a science or art of disagreement that could clarify how to disagree intelligently rather than do so in a mindless manner requiring some form of violent or repressive reaction to eliminate the disagreement as soon as possible. There is a wide variety of initiatives pertaining to integrative knowledge and <b>transdisciplinarity,</b> and a page like Significance: previous, parallel or related initiatives presents several of them. With regard to interdisciplinary relationships between organizations, problems, strategies, values and human development, there is the Integrative Matrix of Human Preoccupations which has been developed by the editors and which allows to deal with all those elements in an exploratory fashion.|$|E

50|$|According to Nicolescu, <b>transdisciplinarity</b> is {{nevertheless}} radically distinct from multidisciplinarity and interdisciplinarity {{because of its}} goal, {{the understanding of the}} present world, which cannot be accomplished in the framework of disciplinary research. The goal of multidisciplinarity and interdisciplinarity always remains within the framework of disciplinary research. If <b>transdisciplinarity</b> is often confused with interdisciplinarity or multidisciplinarity (and by the same token, we note that interdisciplinarity is often confused with multidisciplinarity) this is explained in large part by the fact that all three overflow disciplinary boundaries. Advocates maintain this confusion hides the huge potential of <b>transdisciplinarity.</b>|$|E

5000|$|<b>Transdisciplinarity</b> {{is defined}} by Basarab Nicolescu through three methodological postulates: the {{existence}} of levels of Reality, {{the logic of the}} included middle, and complexity. In the presence of several levels of Reality the space between disciplines and beyond disciplines is full of information. Disciplinary research concerns, at most, one and the same level of Reality moreover, in most cases, it only concerns fragments of one level of Reality. On the contrary, <b>transdisciplinarity</b> concerns the dynamics engendered by the action of several levels of Reality at once. The discovery of these dynamics necessarily passes through disciplinary knowledge. While not a new discipline or a new superdiscipline, <b>transdisciplinarity</b> is nourished by disciplinary research; in turn, disciplinary research is clarified by transdisciplinary knowledge in a new, fertile way. In this sense, disciplinary and transdisciplinary research are not antagonistic but complementary. As in the case of disciplinarity, transdisciplinary research is not antagonistic but complementary to multidisciplinarity and interdisciplinarity research.|$|E

50|$|When {{the very}} nature of a problem is under dispute, <b>transdisciplinarity</b> can help {{determine}} the most relevant problems and research questions involved. A first type of question concerns the cause of the present problems and their future development (system knowledge). Another concerns which values and norms can be used to form goals of the problem-solving process (target knowledge). A third relates to how a problematic situation can be transformed and improved (transformation knowledge). <b>Transdisciplinarity</b> requires adequate addressing of the complexity of problems and the diversity of perceptions of them, that abstract and case-specific knowledge are linked, and that practices promote the common good.|$|E

50|$|In the CIRET approach, <b>transdisciplinarity</b> is radically {{distinct}} from interdisciplinarity.

50|$|EcoHealth studies {{differ from}} traditional, single {{discipline}} studies. A traditional epidemiological study may show increasing rates of malaria in a region, but not address {{how or why}} the rate is increasing. An environmental health study may recommend the spraying of a pesticide in certain amounts in certain areas to reduce spread. An economic analysis may calculate the cost and effectiveness per dollar spent on such a program.An EcoHealth study uses a different approach. It brings the multiple specialist disciplines together {{with members of the}} affected community before the study begins. Through pre-study meetings the group shares knowledge and adopts a common language. These pre-study meetings often lead to creative and novel approaches and can lead to a more “socially robust” solution. EcoHealth practitioners term this synergy <b>transdisciplinarity,</b> and differentiate it from multidiscipline studies.EcoHealth studies also value participation of all involved groups, including decision makers and believe issues of equity (between gender, socioeconomic classes, age and even species) are important to fully understand the problem to be studied.Jean Lebel (2003) phrased <b>transdisciplinarity,</b> participation and equity the three pillars of EcoHealth.The IDRC now speaks of six principles, instead of three pillars, namely <b>transdisciplinarity,</b> participation, gender and social equity, system-thinking, sustainability and research-to-action (Charron, 2011).|$|E

50|$|Scholz {{is one of}} {{the pioneers}} of the theory and {{practice}} of transdisciplinary research and processes. According to his work, which manifested itself as part of the Zurich 2000 definition, <b>transdisciplinarity</b> is different from interdisciplinarity, since, as a core characteristic, knowledge integration and mutual learning among science and society together with co-leadership are crucial elements when striving towards socially robust orientations for sustainable development. From a methodological and didactic perspective, the embedded case study became a powerful method for supporting transdisciplinary processes. Since 1993, he has been an innovator and scientific leader of the first <b>transdisciplinarity</b> laboratory and initiated large-scale transdisciplinary projects on sustainable transitions of urban, agricultural, ecological, technological, economic, and political systems. He was co-leader of the Global TraPs International Fertilizer Development Center#Global Transdisciplinary Processes for Sustainable Phosphorus Management (Global TraPs) project - the first global project on sustainable resources management in regard to phosphorus - which included representatives of all key stakeholder groups of the supply-demand chain.|$|E
