50|$|RhoA as well {{as several}} other members of the Rho family are {{identified}} as having roles in the regulation of the cytoskeleton and cell division. RhoA plays a pivotal role in G1 cell cycle progression, primarily through regulation of cyclin D1 and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (p21 and p27) expression. These regulation pathways activate protein kinases, which subsequently modulate transcription factor activity. RhoA specifically suppresses p21 levels in normal and transformed cell lines via a p53-independent <b>transcriptional</b> <b>mechanism</b> while p27 levels are regulated using effector Rho-associated kinases.Cytokinesis is defined by actomyosin-based contraction. RhoA-dependent diaphanous-related formins (DRFs) localize to the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis while stimulating local actin polymerization by coordinating microtubules with actin filaments {{at the site of the}} myosin contractile ring.Differences in effector binding distinguish RhoA amongst other related Ras homologs GTPases. Integrins can modulate RhoA activity depending on the extracellular matrix composition and other relevant factors. Similarly, RhoA’s stimulation of PKN2 kinase activity regulates cell-cell adhesion through apical junction formation and disassembly.Though RhoA is most notably recognized from its unique contributions in actin-myosin contractility and stress fiber formation, new research has also identified it as a key factor in the mediation of membrane ruffling, lamellae formation and membrane blebbing. A majority of this activity occurs in the leading edge of cells during migration in coordination with membrane protrusions of breast carcinoma.|$|E

Unlike the other CTRPs characterized to date, myonectin (CTRP15) is expressed and secreted predominantly by skeletal muscle.... (Our) results suggest that myonectin is a nutrient-responsive metabolic regulator secreted by skeletal muscle in response to changes in cellular energy state resulting from glucose or fatty acid fluxes. Many metabolically relevant secreted proteins (e.g. adiponectin, leptin, resistin, and RBP) and the signaling pathways they regulate in tissues are known to be dysregulated in the condition of obesity. The reduction in expression and circulating levels of myonectin in the obese state may represent yet another component of the complex metabolic circuitry dysregulated by excess caloric intake. Although exercise has long been known to have profound positive impacts on systemic insulin sensitivity and energy balance, the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. That voluntary exercise dramatically increases the expression and circulating levels of myonectin to promote fatty acid uptake into cells may underlie one of the beneficial effects of physical exercise.... A modest rise in the circulating levels of myonectin resulting from recombinant protein administration is sufficient to lower serum NEFA without altering serum triglyceride levels. Unlike CTRP1, CTRP3 and CTRP12, injection of recombinant myonectin into mice appears to have no glucose-lowering effect. Reduction in circulating NEFA is not due to suppression of adipose tissue lipolysis; rather, it results from increased fatty acid uptake by adipocytes and hepatocytes. Although the myonectin-mediated enhancement of lipid uptake in vitro appears modest (25-50%), in fact, the magnitude of this effect is comparable with cells stimulated with 50 nM insulin, a saturating dose that leads to maximum increase in fatty acid uptake.... In accordance with myonectin mediating its metabolic effect through a <b>transcriptional</b> <b>mechanism,</b> a reduction in circulating NEFA in mice occurred only 2 h after recombinant protein injection, a lag period presumably required for mRNA and protein synthesis." ...|$|E

30|$|Despite {{extensive}} studies, one of {{the central}} aspects of microglia biology, i.e., the regulation of microglial activation, has been largely uncharacterized. In particular, the <b>transcriptional</b> <b>mechanism</b> governing the transition of resting microglia to their activated state remains to be better understood. In this study, we investigated the microglial response to the traumatic injury-induced neurodegeneration. We exploited the iDISCO (immunolabeling-enabled three-dimensional imaging of solvent-cleared organs) for the 3 D fluorescence imaging of microglial activation on the whole-tissue level. We showed that transcription factors IRF 8 and PU. 1 are both essential for microglial activation, as their specific post-developmental deletion abolishes this process. To explore the underlying <b>transcriptional</b> <b>mechanism,</b> we profiled the genomic landscapes of IRF 8 and PU. 1 in activated microglia. We revealed that IRF 8 and PU. 1 directly target the gene transcription of each other, which establishes positive feedback to sustain their highly enhanced expression during microglial activation. Moreover, IRF 8 and PU. 1 dictate the microglial response by cooperatively acting through the composite IRF-ETS motifs that are specifically enriched on microglial activation-related genes. We further verify such cooperative transcription by demonstrating the synergetic assembly of IRF 8 and PU. 1 proteins to the composite-motif DNA in the biochemical assays. Altogether, our study has elucidated the central <b>transcriptional</b> <b>mechanism</b> of microglial activation in response to neurodegeneration.|$|E

However, the <b>transcriptional</b> <b>mechanism</b> governing microglial activation remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate the microglial response to traumatic injury-induced neurodegeneration by the 3 D fluorescence imaging technique. We show that transcription factors IRF 8 and PU. 1 are both indispensible for microglial activation, as their specific post-developmental deletion in microglia abolishes the process. Mechanistically, we reveal that IRF 8 and PU. 1 directly target the gene transcription {{of each other in}} a positive feedback to sustain their highly enhanced expression during microglial activation. Moreover, IRF 8 and PU. 1 dictate the microglial response by cooperatively acting through the composite IRF-ETS motifs that are specifically enriched on microglial activation-related genes. This action of cooperative transcription can be further verified biochemically by the synergetic binding of IRF 8 and PU. 1 proteins to the composite-motif DNA. Our study has therefore elucidated the central <b>transcriptional</b> <b>mechanism</b> of microglial activation in response to neurodegenerative condition.|$|E

HIF- 1 α is also regulated by NF-kB mediated transcription mechanism. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) {{act as an}} important regulator of HIF- 1 either by affecting prolyl hydroxylase activity, the critical determinant of HIF- 1 α stabilization or by activating NF-kB to promote HIF- 1 α transcription. Insulin is known to activate HIF- 1 by a ROS dependent mechanism but the molecular mechanism of HIF- 1 α regulation is not known so far. Here we show that insulin regulates HIF- 1 α by a novel <b>transcriptional</b> <b>mechanism</b> by a ROS-sensitive activation of Sp 1 in 3 T 3 -L 1 preadipocyte. Insulin shows little effect on HIF- 1 α protein stability, but increases HIF- 1 α promoter activity.

We further demonstrate that insulin-induced ROS generation initiates signaling pathway involving phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase and protein kinase C for Sp 1 mediated HIF- 1 α transcription.

Glucocorticoids are first line antiinflammatory therapy in the treatment of asthma and are effective inhibitors of inflammatory cytokines. Clinical data demonstrate that granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) production by airway epithelial cells may be an important target of inhaled glucocorticoid therapy. In this study, the regulatory mechanisms of GM-CSF expression by interleukin- 1 β (IL- 1 β) and the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone (DEX) were examined in the BEAS- 2 B human bronchial epithelial cell line. It is hypothesized that glucocorticoids inhibit GM-CSF production in these cells through <b>transcriptional</b> <b>mechanisms</b> involving induction of the NF-κB inhibitory protein, IκB-α. Treatment of the BEAS- 2 B cells with IL- 1 β induced GM-CSF protein and mRNA levels, and further investigation showed this induction was mediated through <b>transcriptional</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> DEX treatment of BEAS- 2 B cells inhibited IL- 1 β-induced GM-CSF protein and mRNA production. GM-CSF mRNA was rapidly degraded in these cells, and DEX treatment did not significantly affect this decay rate. These data suggest that dexamethasone repression of GM-CSF expression is mediated predominantly through <b>transcriptional</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> This study then examined expression of IκB-α in the BEAS- 2 B cells as a possible mechanism of glucocorticoid repression of GM-CSF. IκB-α RNA levels were minimally induced by DEX in these cells, but this did not result in concurrent induction of IκB-α protein. Additional analysis showed that DEX treatment of BEAS- 2 B cells did not prevent nuclear translocation of the NF-κB subunit p 65, or IL- 1 β-induced degradation of IκB-α protein. From these data, this study concludes that induction of IκB-α is not a significant mechanism of glucocorticoid-mediated repression of GM-CSF in the BEAS- 2 B cells...|$|R

This challenge is particularly acute for polar arthropods that face near-constant desiccating conditions, as water is frozen and thus unavailable {{for much of}} the year. The molecular mechanisms that govern extreme dehydration tolerance in insects remain largely undefined. In this study, we used RNA sequencing to quantify <b>transcriptional</b> <b>mechanisms</b> of extreme dehydration tolerance in the Antarctic midge, Belgica antarctica, the world's southernmost insect and only insect endemic to Antarctica. Larvae of B. antarctica are remarkably tolerant of dehydration, surviving losses up to 70 % of their body water. Gene expression changes in response to dehydration indicated up-regulation of cellular recycling pathways including the ubiquitin-mediated proteasome and autophagy, with concurrent down-regulation of genes involved in general metabolism and ATP production. Metabolomics results revealed shifts in metabolite pools that correlated closely with changes in gene expression, indicating that coordinated changes in gene expression and metabolism are a critical component of the dehydration response. Finally, using comparative genomics, we compared our gene expression results with a transcriptomic dataset for the Arctic collembolan, Megaphorura arctica. Although B. antarctica and M. arctica are adapted to similar environments, our analysis indicated very little overlap in expression profiles between these two arthropods. Whereas several orthologous genes showed similar expression patterns, transcriptional changes were largely species specific, indicating these polar arthropods have developed distinct <b>transcriptional</b> <b>mechanisms</b> to cope with similar desiccating conditions...|$|R
40|$|The cAMP {{responsive}} element modulator alpha (CREMα) {{plays a role}} in autoimmunity and {{in particular}} in systemic lupus erythematosus. CREMα negatively regulates IL- 2 transcription and activates IL- 17 expression by direct <b>transcriptional</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> To understand the role of CREM in autoimmunity we recently generated a mouse with a transgenic overexpression of CREMα selectively in T cells. This mouse is characterized by enhanced IL- 17 and IL- 21 expression. We herein dissect the <b>transcriptional</b> <b>mechanisms</b> of enhanced IL- 21 transcription in these mice. T cells of CREMα transgenic mice display an enhanced binding of CREMα to the CD 3 ζ chain promoter resulting in decreased CD 3 ζ chain expression. This is accompanied by a decreased excitation threshold and enhanced Ca 2 + influx resulting in Il- 21 promoter activation upon T cell stimulation. Furthermore, CREMα directly binds to a CRE half-site within the Il- 21 promoter which also results in enhanced promoter activity shown by promoter reporter assays. IL- 21 transcription is critical for IL- 17 generation in these mice, since IL- 21 receptor blockade downregulates IL- 17 transcription to wildtype levels. Finally, this is of functional relevance since CREMα transgenic mice display enhanced disease activity in dextrane sodium sulfate induced colitis accompanied by higher local IL- 21 expression. Thus we describe 2 novel mechanisms of CREMα dependent IL- 21 transcription. Since T cells of SLE patients are characterized by enhanced IL- 21 transcription this might also be of functional relevance in humans...|$|R
