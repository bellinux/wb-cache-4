25|$|The sub-plot intertwines {{with the}} main plot in two places:- Colin's reasons for helping Sheila are fueled by a deep regret for failing to assist Fiona when she {{discovered}} Annabel's involvement in the smuggling, and thus not being <b>there</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> was killed; {{the investigation into the}} initial murder causes an argument to happen between Mabbutt and Pebmarsh that is misheard by Mrs Hemmings, but which Poirot realises was in regards to the documents they had copied that they needed to get past the police before they were discovered.|$|E
25|$|The {{lyrics and}} storyline {{of the musical}} are based on Mary Main's biography, , which drew heavily upon the {{accounts}} of anti-Perónist Argentines. Shortly after the musical appeared, Nicholas Fraser and Marysa Navarro published a more neutral account of Eva Perón's life, Evita: The Real Lives of Eva Perón, in which they claim that many of Main's assertions (which had influenced Rice's lyrics) were false, such as the suggestion that Eva had first gone to Buenos Aires as the mistress of a married musician, Agustín Magaldi. Instead, they wrote, Eva's mother Doña Juana had taken her <b>there</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> aspired to become a radio actress. Some critics also suggested that Rice's lyrics disparaged Evita's achievements unnecessarily, particularly her charity work. According to Navarro and Fraser, was based {{for the most part}} on the earliest and seamiest versions of Evita's life, something happened to the tale in its retelling and the Evita who emerged each evening, dressed first as a teenager, then a hooker, and finally, in tulle and silver foil, as First Lady, was far from being unsympathetic.|$|E

Through the first half of the game, Kefka leads the charge for the city-state of Vector to conquer the world, one kingdom at a time, using their magic weapons.

At five years she was unable to sit and walk properly, and took up horse riding at the Diamond Centre for Disabled Riders in London as a form of physiotherapy.

The couple took the opportunity to escape Scientology when the staff member went inside to get breakfast; Cook jumped into the driver's seat, drove with her husband to the nearest car rental outlet and hired a car to drive up to her father's house in North Carolina. Before they got there, they were intercepted by Church officials and ordered to return to Clearwater.

His death came unexpectedly, and only a week earlier he had said farewell to his Queen.
