500|$|Manson {{stated that}} {{eliminating}} the corporate pressure and indifference, {{as well as}} the band having a relaxed approach to the making of the record was pivotal for a healthy regroup, writing and recording process. [...] "We didn't put any pressure on ourselves to finish an album... We just took our time and got together in two-week blocks of time - any longer than that I'm sure we would have started getting on each others' nerves. So we did two weeks and then we'd take some time off and then when everybody felt ready we'd get back in [...] again. As a result, I <b>think</b> <b>everybody</b> really enjoyed our time together and really plugged in", she remarked. Never much enjoying being in a studio, Manson relished the record-making process this time around.|$|E
500|$|... "Lovely" [...] {{introduced}} an ongoing storyline of Katherine Mayfair exploring her sexuality. Actress Dana Delany, who previously played a lesbian {{character in the}} Showtime series The L Word, said she felt the subplot was an excellent idea: [...] "A lot of the ladies on the set have said, 'Why has this not happened before?' I <b>think</b> <b>everybody</b> {{wanted to be the}} one who got to do it." [...] In an interview with E! Online, actress Marcia Cross jokingly said of the kiss scene, [...] "I'm a little jealous that I'm not involved. What is going on?" [...] Delany said she did not know if the character would become a lesbian permanently, because the story lines change so often in Desperate Housewives, but that series creator Marc Cherry [...] "is interested in playing the complexity of that". The pairing between Robin and Katherine was the first lesbian relationship in Desperate Housewives.|$|E
500|$|The Pistols {{were soon}} playing other {{important}} venues, debuting at Oxford Street's 100 Club on 30 March. On 3 April, they {{played for the}} first time at the Nashville, supporting the 101ers. The pub rock group's lead singer, Joe Strummer, saw the Pistols {{for the first time}} that night—and recognised punk rock as the future. A return gig at the Nashville on 23 April demonstrated the band's growing musical competence, but by all accounts lacked a spark. Westwood provided that by instigating a fight with another audience member; McLaren and Rotten were soon involved in the melee. Cook later said, [...] "That fight at the Nashville: that's when all the publicity got hold of it and the violence started creeping in.... I <b>think</b> <b>everybody</b> was ready to go and we were the catalyst." [...] The Pistols were soon banned from both the Nashville and the Marquee.|$|E

500|$|Following The Inside, Nichols {{found work}} on the fifth season of the serial action series Alias in 2005, being cast that July. Nichols starred as Rachel Gibson, a {{computer}} expert who thought she {{was working for the}} CIA when in fact she was working for a dangerous terrorist organization—a situation {{similar to that of the}} series' main character Sydney Bristow (Jennifer Garner) in the first season. Discovering the truth, Gibson joins the real CIA and becomes Bristow's protégée. Of working on Alias, Nichols said that [...] "to say it's the nicest set on the planet is an understatement". Her role involved multiple fight sequences, as did Garner's. Nichols worked with Garner's personal trainer; she said she [...] "already knew that [...] job was extremely hard. But I didn't know how difficult it was until I started training for just one fight." [...] Nichols was being groomed to replace Garner as the main character due to the latter's pregnancy, which had been written into the storyline. But Alias was canceled in November 2005, making its fifth season its final. [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>everybody</b> knew that the show wouldn't work without Jennifer", Nichols said, [...] "But still, they were grooming me, so it was heartbreaking when it happened." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Zebras" [...] {{was written}} by Amanda Green and Daniel Truly, and {{directed}} by Peter Leto. The surprise twist in the episode, in which forensics technician Ryan O'Halloran is killed by fellow technician Dale Stuckey, was conceived by Neal Baer, the series executive producer and showrunner. Baer said the decision to kill the character in the story [...] "just came to [...] one day" [...] and thought that [...] "this may be a really interesting way to bring [...] cast together and deal with this story point". In particular, Baer {{said he wanted to}} kill a long-recurring character so the show could [...] "explore characters' reactions to a death in an interesting way". Mike Doyle, the actor who played O'Halloran, was notified about the decision by Baer in a phone call {{a few weeks before the}} episode was filmed in May 2009. Baer said Doyle and the rest of the cast took the news well because, in his words, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>everybody</b> knew that somebody was going, so they weren't shocked." [...] During a May 2009 interview, Baer hinted at the twist by telling media outlets that the season finale would include a surprise ending: [...] "One of our own is murdered." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite some {{moderate}} critical praise {{including a}} glowing review from AllMusic, {{who called the}} album's [...] "impressively surprising" [...] array of sounds [...] "refreshing coming from a band who {{was assumed to be}} generic retro swing", Soul Caddy failed to achieve the chart success or commercial attention of its predecessor. The Daddies' accompanying national tour fared just as poorly, showing a marked decline in attendance and negative audience reactions towards the band's decreased focus on playing swing music. Speaking retrospectively in a 2002 interview, Perry recalled [...] "we went out on tour and most people saw us as a swing band because of the success of Zoot Suit Riot...we felt this tension to be something we weren't". Facing low ticket sales and their own dissatisfaction over the tour's outcome, the Daddies brought their scheduled tour to an early close, eventually reaching a mutual decision upon taking an indefinite hiatus in December 2000. [...] "A lot of it was just fatigue", Perry explained, [...] "We'd be on the road {{for a long time and}} we had no life outside of Cherry Poppin' Daddies. [...] I <b>think</b> <b>everybody</b> was interested in doing other things". The Daddies were released from Mojo shortly thereafter, though Jason Moss would later comment that the band were kicked [...] "to the curb" [...] after Soul Caddys poor commercial performance.|$|E

500|$|On Friday, November 23, 2007, Heinz Field hosted four WPIAL {{championship}} {{football games}} which were followed {{the day after}} with a game between Pitt and South Florida. After discussion with the NFL, Steelers ownership {{made the decision to}} re-surface the field for their nationally televised game against the Miami Dolphins. A layer of sod was laid overtop the [...] Desso GrassMaster surface. The field's condition was exacerbated by 1½inches of rain after the new sod had been laid, which did not allow the tarp to be removed from the field until 70 minutes before the game began. The field conditions during the game ended up being so bad that at one point during the game, a punt by Dolphins punter Brandon Fields ended up sticking into the turf without bouncing. The Steelers won the game 3–0, with a field goal by Jeff Reed with 17seconds remaining in regulation; it was the NFL's first 3-0 game since 1993 and the longest two teams went without scoring since the New York Giants and Detroit Lions played to a scoreless tie on November 11, 1943. Scott Brown, of the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, called the field a [...] "veritable mud pit". While Gene Upshaw, head of the National Football League Players' Association, also criticized the field citing a 2006 survey of NFL players that ranked Heinz Field as the second worst field in the league. Steelers receiver Hines Ward called the playing conditions [...] "horrendous" [...] after the game. However, the following day Ward and other Pittsburgh players lobbied to keep the natural surface stating, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>everybody</b> wants to keep the grass." [...] Since that season, the Steelers have played their game on the weekend following Thanksgiving on the road at the team's request.|$|E

Drummer Aaron Harris felt that the band pushed themselves too far musically, too; having learned a wealth of new techniques prior to its recording, he says he “grew so much as a drummer [...] that it was overwhelming even for me.” He continues: “I think I was trying to show off a little bit [...] I <b>think</b> <b>everybody</b> was.” The eventual record proved dissatisfactory, with him opining that “some of it sounded a bit jumbled.
