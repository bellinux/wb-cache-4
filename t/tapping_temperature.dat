The main factors of fading are process time and temperature including rest time between tapping and pouring. This research conducted to see the effect of time rest between tapping and pouring process to the completion of inoculation and nodulation process. Analysis was done on 1 mm plates of TWDI casting process. The liquid metal came from 1 bath. Variations of casting condition were presented. The <b>Tapping</b> <b>temperature</b> was 1550 OC. The pouring temperature varied of the first bath was 1399 OC, 1389 OC, 1385 OC and 1381 OC.

Induction There are lots of magnesite resources in the south of LiaoNing province in our country. But in the process of exploiting magnesite resources, the main minerals were exploited in traditional patterns. In such patterns, lean magnesite minerals were piled up as abandon and the rich were obtained, which caused a great waste of resources, formation of white pollution.

40|$|Thesis (MTech (Chemical Engineering)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2006 Better {{metallurgical}} {{accounting practices}} are achieved through implementation of robust and accurate analytical techniques, {{in particular the}} sample preparation techniques involved, as well as characterization of all possible errors associated with such techniques and those associated with {{the characteristics of the}} materials to be analyzed. As a contribution to the AMIRA P 754 project which aims at developing standards and tools for metal balancing, reconciliation and reporting from mine resource to final product, this thesis presents best practices for the characterization of ferrochrome smelter slag. The characterization ofthe slag is also essential for process control, and thus its implications to the performance of the smelting process are also discussed in this thesis. Slag samples from a ferrochrome smelter were analyzed using an XRF powder pellet analytical technique in contrast to the rep technique used at the plant laboratory, to determine their composition. This was done to evaluate the possibility of using XRF as an alternative technique to improve the turnaround times at the plant laboratory. It was found that the XRF analysis of the composite slag by pressed powder pellets could be performed rapidly, but because of the grain size effects resulted from the entrained alloy particles which could not pulverize well, the results were not accurate. This then led to the introduction of an extra stage (oxidation of the entrained alloy particles) in the sample preparation procedure, which prolonged the turnaround time by about 16 hours. However, an important achievement was that the entrained alloy particles could be oxidized into their oxides to obtain homogeneous samples and therefore representative sub-samples. This is an important improvement in the practices at the plant laboratory which involved excluding some of the entrained alloy particles and thus analyzing biased, non-representative samples. A rapid estimation of the percentage of the entrained alloy in slag was proven to be possible using a simple model (which relates density and the mass fraction of the entrained alloy), in conjunction with a density measuring device (a pycnometer). This ability serves as a significant improvement in the mass balancing and metallurgical accounting practices at ferrochrome producers. This thesis also describes the manner in which heterogeneity can be quantified as well as the errors associated with heterogeneity and their implications to the analysis results. Heterogeneity in ferrochrome slag has been found to depend significantly on the amount of alloy entrainment in slag, and therefore the slag viscosity, <b>tapping</b> <b>temperature</b> and chemical composition. One can therefore conclude that the sampling constant and therefore sample mass is dependent on furnace operating conditions...|$|E

40|$|An iron {{silicate}} (fayalite) based slag {{is formed}} in the secondary copper smelting process. This slag contains substantial amount of ZnO, CaO and Al 2 O 3 and minor components such as Na 2 O, PbO, MgO and Cr 2 O 3. This slag is of great importance to the copper smelting process and the entire production loop. The phase relations and the viscosity of the slag system at the smelting condition influences the process in both kinetic and thermodynamic ways. The cooling process has {{a great impact on}} the final microstructure of the solidified slag and further affects the following slag valorization applications. It is reported by the copper recycling industry that the copper smelting slag often has a high viscosity which may lead to problems in slag tapping. In the present study, the copper slag was observed in-situ with confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). It was found that solid precipitation at the <b>tapping</b> <b>temperature</b> is the main reason of the increasing viscosity. In order to solve this problem, the phase relations in the industrial slag system ZnO-“FeO”-SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 -CaO (CaO/SiO 2 = 0. 05, Al 2 O 3 /SiO 2 = 0. 15) were investigated by quenching samples after reaching equilibrium at 1423 K (1150 °C) under iron saturation. The equilibrium composition of the phases was determined with electron probe micro-analysis (EPMA). The effect of individual components, such as FeO, ZnO and CaO on the phase equilibrium of the slag system has been quantitatively studied. A high temperature rheometer system has been employed to study the rheological behavior of the industrial slag with iron saturation. Non-Newtonian behavior has been observed and the effect of the major components (FeO, ZnO and CaO) on the rheological property of the slag system has been investigated. The crystallization behavior of both ZnO containing slag (FeO-ZnO-SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 -CaO, FeO/SiO 2 = 2, ZnO = 9 wt. %, Al 2 O 3 = 5 wt. %, CaO = 1 wt. %) and ZnO free slag (FeO-SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 -CaO, FeO/SiO 2 = 1. 6, Al 2 O 3 = 5 wt. %, CaO = 1 wt. %) under various cooling rates was observed in-situ by CLSM. Continuous cooling transformation (CCT) diagrams were constructed. The influence of the individual components of the slag, e. g. FeO, CaO and Al 2 O 3 on the crystallization behavior of the fayalite slag was systematically studied via water quenching experiments followed by a detailed EPMA-WDS micro-chemical analysis. Industrial scale experiments were carried out to study the cooling process of the copper smelting slag. The slag was cooled in an iron pot, a copper mold, a steel plate and quenched with water flow. XRF, XRD and EPMA were employed to characterize the slag. The cooling process was simulated with the software COMSOL, the temperature profile and the cooling rate were calculated. The relation between the cooling history and the microstructure of the solidified slag was investigated. Based on the experimental data, suggestions were given to the industry, including the modification of the slag chemical composition and the cooling process, in order to decrease the risk of problematic operation and to adapt the slag in higher added value utilizations. status: publishe...|$|E

During the low-pressure, high-temperature process of steelmaking inhomogeneous blast furnace burden consisting of pre- and untreated iron ore, iron silicates and coke is reduced to oxygen fugacities near the C-CO buffer, resulting in the segregation of a metal phase containing only ~ 0. 3 wt% Si.

40|$|Abstract Background Each {{year in the}} UK 2000 {{children}} attend emergency departments and 500 are admitted to hospital following a bath water scald. The long term effects can include disability, disfigurement or psychological harm and repeated skin grafts may be required as the child grows. The costs of treating a severe scald are estimated at 250, 000 GBP. Children living in the most deprived wards are at greatest risk of thermal injuries; hospital admission rates are three times that for children living in the least deprived wards. Domestic hot water, which is usually stored at around 60 degrees Celsius, {{can result in a}} second-degree burn after 3 seconds and a third-degree burn after 5 seconds. Educational strategies to encourage testing of <b>tap</b> water <b>temperature</b> and reduction of hot water thermostat settings have largely proved unsuccessful. Legislation in the USA mandating pre-setting hot water heater thermostats at 49 degrees Celsius was effective in reducing scald injuries, suggesting passive measures may have a greater impact. Thermostatic mixer valves (TMVs), recently developed for the domestic market, fitted across the hot and cold water supply pipes of the bath, allow delivery of water set at a fixed temperature from the hot bath tap. These valves therefore offer the potential to reduce scald injuries. Design/Methods A pragmatic, randomised controlled trial to assess the effectiveness of TMVs in reducing bath hot <b>tap</b> water <b>temperatures</b> in the homes of families with young children in rented social housing. Two parallel arms include an intervention group and a control group where the intervention will be deferred. The intervention will consist of fitting a TMV (set at 44 degrees Celsius) by a qualified plumber and provision of educational materials. The control arm will not receive a TMV or the educational materials for the study duration but will be offered the intervention after collection of follow-up data 12 months post randomisation. The primary outcome measure will be the bath hot <b>tap</b> water <b>temperature.</b> Fifteen families per arm are required to detect a reduction in the mean bath hot <b>tap</b> water <b>temperature</b> from 60. 4 degrees Celsius (SD 9. 1) in the control group to 46 degrees Celsius in the intervention group, with 90 % power and a 5 % significance level (2 sided). Secondary outcome measures including acceptability will require a sample size of 120 participants.

The pilot plant was operated continuously for 8 days, during which about 30 tons of magnesium producing recipe was smelted in a dc (direct-current) arc furnace at {{a feed rate}} of 525 kg/h. The furnace was operated at power levels of 700 to 850 kW resulting in slag <b>tapping</b> <b>temperatures</b> of 1600 to 1700 °C. Magnesium extraction averaged 77 per cent and was as high as 85 per cent during good extraction periods. The furnace generated 70 to 85 kg/h magnesium vapour that was delivered to the condenser where the temperature was controlled at 680 to 720 °C. The novel condenser captured the magnesium in a liquid state, which was tapped periodically as required. In total, 15 magnesium-tapping operations were carried out, proving that on-line magnesium tapping can be consistently performed without any major difficulty. About 3500 kg of crude magnesium was produced with a quality that was similar to, if not better than, that of the Magnetherm’s crude metal. The condensation efficiency averaged 85 per cent, and peaked at 87 per cent, which exceeded the target of 80 per cent set for the pilot scale. A brief magnesium market study was also carried out. Magnesium demand is expected to keep on growing by 6 to 8 per cent over the next 10 years and could reach 2 million ton by the year 2020.

40|$|Injury is {{the leading}} cause of death and {{disability}} of Australian children, greater than any illness or disease, yet it is rarely at the forefront of child health programs. Part of the reason the childhood injury problem has not been brought to the public’s attention is that it is hidden behind the global success in reducing deaths from illness and diseases. In some cases this has made the childhood injury problem more pronounced which in turn has stimulated the momentum in childhood injury prevention. Strategies to reduce childhood injuries generally have focused programs and policies that target discrete specific risk factors and safety. Initiatives that involve making physical changes such as hot water <b>tap</b> <b>temperature</b> regulators, stair guards and fencing around swimming pools have been effective. However, approaches viewed by issue rather than holistically tend to be independent of strategies that provide children with a sense of agency in their safety learning. There appears to be an absence of studies examining a “collective risk intelligence” as a form of safety capacity building. In drawing upon cultural-historical theory, this study sought to examine the effect on preschool children’s behaviour and reasoning about safety as a result of participation in a program called “SeeMore Safety”. This study addresses a notable gap in the literature on this important issue. Early childhood education has the potential to play an important role in shaping a child’s sense of safety. However, injury prevention approaches at the preschool level have generally targeted parents in the education process where the child is a passive recipient. Findings from this study suggest that when children are given the right learning opportunities and experiences, they can build safety risk intelligence that equips them with capabilities they need to become competent risk-takers and manage their safety in everyday life and activities. When considered together, the papers demonstrate the important role children play in their safety learning, where the term safety risk intelligence is introduced to capture children’s agency, and through this concept make a significant contribution to the uncharted terrain within the field of child safety...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{quantify}} the effectiveness of the Queensland "Hot Water Burns Like Fire" campaign. Cross-section temperature sampling of households 2 ̆ 7 bathroom hot water taps was conducted in Brisbane in 1990 before the intervention (n = 872) and in 2002 to 2003 after the intervention (n = 871). In both surveys, temperature was measured with thermometers held under running water from the bathroom hot tap until the reading stabilized (2 minutes). In 2002 to 2003 the interviewer also recorded whether or not the householder believed a tempering valve was installed in the home. The main injury outcome measure was all scald injury-related admissions at hospitals in Queensland from July 1990 to June 2003. The difference between the mean hot water <b>tap</b> <b>temperature</b> in 1990 and in 2002 to 2003 was determined with independent sample t-tests (P <. 05). Rates of hospital admissions were grouped into two categories: scald injuries per year prior to the introduction of the hot water tempering valve legislation (April 1998) and scald injuries per year post-legislation. The difference between the preintervention and postintervention mean rates was determined with Ptests (P <. 05). Additionally, the rates were plotted on a scatter plot by year, and a linear regression analysis was used to quantify the relationship with rates of scald-related injuries and year. The temperature in homes where the occupants reported having a tempering valve (mean = 55. 5 degrees C) was significantly lower than in homes whose occupants reported not having a tempering valve (mean = 60. 1 degrees C) or did not know whether they had a tempering valve (mean = 61. 8 degrees C) (P <. 01). However, the comparison of the hot water temperature between 1990 and 2002 to 2003 showed a significantly higher mean hot water temperature in 2002 to 2003 (P <. 01). There was a significantly higher mean scald injury rate after the introduction of the "Hot Water Burns Like Fire" campaign (170. 36 / 100, 000) than before (113. 41 / 100, 000; P =. 01). The linear regression line of best fit of these data has a slope of 10. 43 (P <. 01) and an r(2) of 0. 79. The results of this study suggest that the Queensland "Hot Water Burns Like Fire" campaign has not led to a significant reduction in hot water temperature or scald injury rates.

The main {{aim is to}} check and complement the knowledge about manufacture of heavy castings from austenitic nickel cast irons {{in a field of}} control of <b>tapping</b> and casting <b>temperature,</b> carbon content control with regard to the prediction of eutectic composition and in a field of setting a suitable chemical composition of cast iron with regard to the formation of chunky graphite and stability of the austenitic matrix and further on also possibilities of cast iron filtration during pouring the castings. Based on done experiments the formulae were determined that enable to calculate eutectic and liquidus temperatures on the basis of chemical composition of the cast iron. The use of several formulae given in the literature for calculating the carbon equivalent of austenitic nickel cast irons was compared and evaluated. For utilization of determined results in practice a calculating programme has been compiled making possible to be used in operational practice. This programme is named Calculation of casting temperature of Ni-resist cast irons. After the entry of the melt chemical composition the programme calculates the all important parameters necessary to know and to be controlled for manufacture of high quality castings from austenitic nickel cast irons. Eutectic temperature, liquidus temperature and then based on it the <b>tapping</b> and casting <b>temperatures</b> are included among those parameters. Further on there are eutectic concentration of carbon, carbon equivalent, nickel equivalent, and a criterion evaluating a danger of chunky graphite formation...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{synthesise}} {{and evaluate}} {{the evidence of the}} effectiveness of interventions to prevent scalds in children. Methods: An overview of systematic reviews (SR) and a SR of primary studies were performed evaluating interventions to prevent scalds in children. A comprehensive literature search was conducted covering various resources up to October 2012. Experimental and controlled observational studies reporting scald injuries, safety practices and safety equipment use were included. Results: Fourteen systematic reviews and 39 primary studies were included. There is little evidence that interventions are effective in reducing the incidence of scalds in children. More evidence was found that inventions are effective in promoting safe hot <b>tap</b> water <b>temperature,</b> especially when home safety education, home safety checks and discounted or free safety equipment including thermometers and thermostatic mixing valves were provided. No consistent evidence was found for the effectiveness of interventions on the safe handling of hot food or drinks nor improving kitchen safety practices. Conclusion: Education, home safety checks along with thermometers or thermostatic mixing valves should be promoted to reduce tap water scalds. Further research is needed {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} interventions on scald injuries and to disentangle the effects of multifaceted interventions on scald injuries and safety practices...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the proposed research is to detect transformer internal faults or transformer overheating and trip the transformer, with immunity to external faults for which tripping of the transformer is not required. A new transformer protection scheme based on dynamic state estimation has been proposed. Specifically, the proposed scheme continuously monitors transformer terminal voltages and currents and other measurable quantities such as <b>tap</b> settings, <b>temperatures,</b> etc. The measurement data are utilized in a dynamic state estimator of the transformer protection zone. The dynamic state estimation simply determines how well the measured data fit the dynamic model of the transformer. When the fit is within {{the accuracy of the}} meters by which the measurements are taking, the dynamic state estimator provides the true operating condition of the transformer. Discrepancies indicate an internal abnormality. The scheme takes decisions based on the operating conditions of the transformer. This scheme does not require any coordination with other protection functions. Several protection gaps, such as the coordination and settings of relays, have been resolved with proposed new method. The proposed method is secure, reliable, more sensitive and faster than legacy protection functions. The applications of the proposed protection method for future research are discussed. Ph. D...|$|R
40|$|The overall {{objective}} {{of the program was}} to optimize refractory materials and foundry processing used in casting steel. This objective was to be met by completing the following: (1) Surveying the steel foundries both through paper/electronic surveys sent to North American steel foundries as well as plant visits to participants. Information concerning refractory selection and performance as well as refractory and steelmaking practices provides a baseline for future comparison and to identify opportunities for substantial improvement in energy efficiency. (2) Conducting post-mortem analysis of materials from existing refractory/steelmaking practices to determine wear/failure mechanisms. (3) Identify areas for research on developing refractories for use in steel foundry furnaces, adjusting steelmaking practices to improve efficiency and modifying slag practices to improve refractory performance. The {{overall objective}} of the steel foundry refractory lining optimization program was to review established refractory and steelmaking practices to identify opportunities for improvements that would yield substantial energy savings for steel foundries. Energy savings were expected to arise from improved efficiency of the electric arc furnaces and from reductions in the post-casting welding and grinding that are normally required. Ancillary energy savings related to a reduction in the amount of refractories currently produced {{to meet the needs of}} the steel foundry industry, and a shift from pre-fired materials (shaped refractories) to monolithic refractories that are heat treated ''in situ'' were anticipated. A review of the complete program results indicates that techniques for achieving the overall goal were demonstrated. The main difference between the predicted and the actual achievements relates to the areas from which actual energy savings could be realized. Although reductions in furnace <b>tap</b> <b>temperature</b> would result in a reduction in the power required for melting, such reductions are realized through changes within the ladle transfer portion of the process, through modified ladle pre-heat and refractory insulation. Reductions in clean room energy usage proved very difficult to track, and some questions as to just how much impact refractory related inclusions have on the degree of welding and grinding required for completion of a casting, remain. Post-mortem analysis of casting defects did identify refractory derived inclusions but the greatest concentration of inclusions related to steel reoxidation issue. In almost every instance, the suggested refractory/process modifications were proven to be both technically and economically feasible. The difficulty in implementation of the proposed changes relates to the ''up front'' expense and the learning curve associated with any process modification. These two issues were compounded by production slow downs that are too common in the current market. Such slow downs normally result in less energy efficient processing coupled with reductions in capital or ''up front'' expenditures. A return to historical norms should allow foundries to implement the suggested modifications and then evaluate the overall benefit...|$|R
40|$|Tap hole {{refractories}} constitute critical {{parts of}} the refractory lining in submerged arc furnaces. For several hours every day, molten slag and metal flow through the tap hole calling for thorough selection of refractory materials able to withstand the intense thermal, corrosive and erosive conditions present in this area. Carbon-based refractories have shown excellent thermal properties and high strength, as well as low wettability towards process materials, and are therefore utilized in silicomanganese production furnaces both as side lining, in the hearth, and in the tap hole area. The aim {{of this investigation was}} to determine the compatibility of five refractory materials utilized in the tap hole area of an industrial silicomanganese furnace with two industrial silicomanganese slags: 	Investigate the suitability of the selected refractory materials for confining the process materials during industrial production of silicomanganese alloys. 	Identify critical refractory wear mechanisms upon slag-refractory interaction at industrial <b>tapping</b> <b>temperatures.</b> Compatibilities were investigated through 12 static crucible tests and two static plate tests in a vertical tube furnace redesigned during this investigation. Slag-refractory interaction was studied after two and four hours holding time at 1367 °C ± 1. 8 °C, 1464 °C ± 2. 1 °C and 1600 °C - 0. 6 °C /+ 0. 2 °C. Holding temperatures were verified through the wire-bridge method at the melting points of gold and palladium. Visual inspection, as well as optical microscopy and SEM, were utilized to examine the samples after heat treatment. During compatibility experiments, dissolution of refractory matrix due to solubility of oxide refractory binder phases in silicomanganese slags was observed, as well as disintegration of refractory particles due to gas formation at slag-refractory interface, or expansion as a result of phase transformations in refractory material. Direct reduction of manganese oxide from slags and iron oxide present in refractories by carbon and silicon carbide was also observed. Establishment of partial slag-metal equilibriums between iron oxide and silicon metal originally present in slag was observed, as well as formation of silicon carbide at the slag-refractory interfaces. The latter may serve to protect the refractory from wear caused by slags. Based on observations of extensive interaction between silicomanganese slag sample I and ramming paste at 1600 °C, the ramming paste investigated cannot be recommended for usage during tap block repair in an industrial silicomanganese furnace. Incipient electrode paste disintegration by slags and silicon carbide tap block slag interaction were observed after compatibility tests at 1464 °C, calling for further investigations of these refractory materials. Tap hole clay and carbon tap block showed minimal signs of interaction with process materials at 1464 °C. Refractory porosity seemed to have a larger effect on refractory wear than refractory ash content. Contrary to industrial observations, silicomanganese slag sample I was more corrosive towards the ramming paste and electrode paste investigated than silicomanganese slag sample II...|$|R
40|$|An {{analytical}} method to evaluate propionylpromazine hydrochloride (PPZHCl) in tranquilizer formulations was developed using {{high-performance liquid chromatography}} (HPLC). During analysis of aged quality-control samples, a previously unreported chromatographic response was observed at a shorter retention time than PPZHCl. Further investigation of formulations stored in trap <b>tap</b> devices at <b>temperatures</b> ranging from 5 to 40 ◦C during field trials at four different locations confirmed the degradation of the active ingredient. Further investigation using HPLC/tandem mass spectrometry revealed two to five degradates, with the major degradates being oxidation products of the active ingredient, PPZHCl. As PPZHCl formulations must be stable when stored at 5 to 40 ◦C for 6 to 12 months, reformulation with the anti-oxidant ascorbic acid was utilized to achieve the required PPZHCl stability.

Renewable energy electrical systems from solar to wind to even local hydro-power in some cases, are some of the many types of renewable energy systems available locally. Additionally, for those interested in heating and cooling their dwelling via renewable energy, geothermal heat pump systems that <b>tap</b> the constant <b>temperature</b> of the earth, which is around 7 to 15 degrees Celsius a few feet underground and increases dramatically at greater depths, are an option over conventional natural gas and petroleum-fueled heat approaches. Also, in geographic locations where the Earth's Crust is especially thin, or near volcanoes (as is the case in Iceland) there exists the potential to generate even more electricity than would be possible at other sites, thanks to a more significant temperature gradient at these locales.|$|R

On {{the basis of this}} color reaction, FIA of nitrate was established. Nitrate ion could be reduced to nitrite ion by passing through the reduction column(2 mm× 30 cm) packed with copperized cadmium {Cu(Cd) : particle size, about 0. 5 mm}, which was installed just behind the sample injection valve. The carrier solution(10 (- 3) M EDTA, pH 8) and the reagent solution (8 × 10 (- 4) M BHPA, 0. 35 M HCl, 0. 15 M H(3) PO(4)) were propelled at the flow rate of 0. 7 ml/min by using a double-plunger pump.
