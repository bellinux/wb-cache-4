500|$|Robinson {{was born}} Walker Smith Jr. in Ailey, Georgia, to Walker Smith Sr. and Leila Hurst. Robinson was the {{youngest}} of three children; his eldest sister Marie was born in 1917 and his other sister Evelyn was born in 1919. His father was a cotton, peanut, and corn farmer in Georgia, who moved the family to Detroit where he initially found work in construction. According to Robinson, Smith Sr. later worked two jobs to support his family—cement mixer and sewer worker. [...] "He had <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> six in the morning and he'd get home close to midnight. Six days a week. The only day I really saw him was Sunday...I always wanted to be with him more." ...|$|E
500|$|The new {{schedule}} {{resulted in}} a conflict for Anthony Quinn, who was signed to play the title role in Attila, a 1954 epic, also produced by De Laurentiis and directed by Pietro Francisci. At first, Quinn considered withdrawing from La Strada, but Fellini convinced him to work on both films simultaneously, shooting La Strada {{in the morning and}} Attila in the afternoon and evening. The plan often required the actor <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> 3:30a.m. in order to capture the [...] "bleak early light" [...] on which Fellini insisted, and then leave at 10:30 to drive to Rome in his Zampanò outfit in order to be on the set in time to be transformed into Attila the Hun for afternoon shooting. Quinn recalled: [...] "This schedule accounted for the haggard look I had in both films, a look that was perfect for Zampanò but scarcely OK for Attila the Hun." ...|$|E
500|$|Emperor Shah Jahan {{maintained}} a rigorous schedule during his entire thirty years rule and used <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> 4 AM and, after ablutions and prayers, religiously {{appeared at the}} jharokha window to show himself to his subjects. During his stay in Agra or Delhi, huge crowds used to assemble to receive his darshan below the balcony. He would appear before the public 45 minutes after sunrise. His subjects would bow before him which he would reciprocate with his imperial salute. There was one particular group of people known as darshaniyas (akin to the guilds of Augustales of the Roman Empire) who were [...] "servile" [...] to the king and who would take their food only after they had {{a look at the}} face of the emperor which they considered as auspicious. More than half an hour had to be spent by the King at the balcony as {{it was the only time}} people could submit petitions to the king directly through the chain let down for the purpose (which was drawn up by attendants) of receiving such petitions by passing the nobles of the court. At one time in 1657 when Shah Jahan was sick he could not appear for the Jharokha Darshan which spread speculations of his death.|$|E
6000|$|... "I expect you'll {{be ready}} for your bed," [...] said Mrs. Athelny to Philip. [...] "You're not used <b>to</b> <b>getting</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> five and staying {{in the open air}} all day." ...|$|R
60|$|Day {{after day}} George {{set out on}} his quest, but all was without success. He and Bill still slept in the loft, and after the first day he took <b>to</b> <b>getting</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> {{the same time as}} his companion, and going out with him to try and pick up a few pence from the men with the market-carts. Every other morning they were able to lie later, as there were only regular marketdays three mornings a week.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have come}} to call Captain Lefaux," [...] he said. [...] "A {{messenger}} has just brought an order, from Bordeaux, that he is <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> anchor <b>at</b> daylight." ...|$|R
500|$|As [...] "Kenny", {{as he was}} {{sometimes}} known, grew, he did an increasing share of the farm work, later stating, [...] "I did my share—and it was a substantial share—in {{taking care of the}} 13acres... I do not remember that I particularly liked <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> 3:30 in the morning." [...] Kenesaw began his off-farm career at age ten as a news delivery boy. [...] He left school at 15 after an unsuccessful attempt to master algebra; he then worked at the local general store. He left that job for a position as errand boy with the Vandalia Railroad. Landis applied for a job as a brakeman, but was laughingly dismissed as too small. He then worked for the Logansport Journal, and taught himself shorthand reporting, becoming in 1883 official court reporter for the Cass County Circuit Court. [...] Landis later wrote, [...] "I may not have been much of a judge, nor baseball official, but I do pride myself on having been a real shorthand reporter." [...] He served in that capacity until 1886. In his spare time, he became a prize-winning bicycle racer and played on and managed a baseball team. Offered a professional contract as a ballplayer, he turned it down, stating that he preferred to play for the love of the game.|$|E
500|$|Entering {{his fourth}} season, Washington knew {{the only thing}} keeping him in the league was his {{guaranteed}} contract and that the Lakers had essentially written him off. The organization felt he had the requisite physical skills, so they ascribed his failure to excel to mental deficiencies. Washington was particularly disturbed when {{in a game against}} Golden State, he got into an awkward collision with Rick Barry, upon which Barry remarked: [...] "Listen, you better learn how to play this game." [...] The criticism especially bothered Washington because he felt Barry's rebuke was correct. Desperate to improve, he contacted Pete Newell at the recommendation of an agent. Newell was a retired pro and college coach who worked in a front office position with the Lakers, and had drafted Washington when he was then the team's GM. In truth, while Newell says he felt some responsibility considering he drafted him, he was involved in many player transactions {{over the course of his}} long career, and was not especially attached to Washington. He was surprised by this request, however, and unhappy with his new highly marginalized job within the organization, so Newell agreed to meet Washington for individual drills. He scheduled the practices very early in the morning to test Washington's dedication, thinking a professional athlete would not bother <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> that hour every day. Washington showed up without complaint and Newell put him through intense training sessions. Newell is often seen as a kind, gentlemanly person, who is considered one of the most important figures in the history of the game of basketball. In private practice, however, he could be an intense, unforgiving teacher, and he was even more unforgiving than usual with Washington as he felt that if he were to offer his services for free he would only do so if the player was willing to train maniacally.|$|E
2500|$|Even though Butler's {{mother wanted}} her to become a {{secretary}} with a steady income, Butler continued {{to work at a}} series of temporary jobs, preferring the kind of mindless work that would allow her <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> two or three in the morning to write. [...] Success continued to elude her, as an absence of useful criticism led her to style her stories after the white-and-male-dominated science fiction she had grown up reading. She enrolled at California State University, Los Angeles, but then switched to taking writing courses through UCLA Extension.|$|E
5000|$|Nocturia, a {{frequent}} need <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> and urinate <b>at</b> night. It differs from enuresis, or bed-wetting, {{in which the}} person does not arouse from sleep, but the bladder nevertheless empties.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Isaac,' said Jackson, as Mrs. Bardell {{prepared}} <b>to</b> <b>get</b> in, looking <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the {{man with}} the ash stick, who was seated on the box, smoking a cigar.|$|R
5000|$|A severe {{backlash}} against Iranians in the United States developed. One Iranian American later complained, “I {{had to hide}} my Iranian identity not <b>to</b> <b>get</b> beaten <b>up,</b> even <b>at</b> university.” ...|$|R
2500|$|Herbert Appel – a stock {{boy at the}} {{hardware}} store, his character is distinguished by his odd speech patterns. By putting non-standard emphasis on syllables and sounds, his sentences can be confusing and/or humorous (what would now be considered mondegreen). For example, [...] "I had <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> eight o'clock" [...] is heard by Fibber and Molly as [...] "I {{had to get a}} potato clock", [...] "I got up too early" [...] comes out as [...] "I got up twirly", and his own name sounds like [...] "Herber Tapple" [...] (in [...] "Fibber Puts Up Christmas Lights", 12/20/49).|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank {{him very}} much; say I've <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> an unnatural hour." [...] To this Peter added: [...] "I think I ought {{to tell you}} {{she may not be}} there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “How could I wake you, {{when you}} didn’t wake me?” he retorted. “Now we shan’t {{get on the}} water till after twelve. I wonder you take the trouble <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> all.” ...|$|E
60|$|Burning with indignation, Larry {{felt himself}} {{go down in}} a heap, and <b>at</b> once tried <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> again. <b>At</b> {{the same time the}} soldier beneath him gave him a shove which pitched him several feet forward. He landed up against the {{lieutenant}} with considerable force, and in a twinkle the officer went overboard, head first, into the water and mud where the casco had stuck fast.|$|R
6000|$|... "Richard," [...] said Ethel, [...] "I'll {{tell you}} what. Suppose we were <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> a Sunday-school <b>at</b> Cocksmoor. We {{could get a}} room, and walk there every Sunday afternoon, and go to church in the evening instead." ...|$|R
60|$|Whether Bob {{were really}} {{capable of doing}} this, Cynthia could not tell. She {{believed}} he was. Perhaps she really {{did not intend to}} go upstairs just then. To his intense relief she seated herself on a straight-backed chair near the door, although she had the air of being about <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> again <b>at</b> any minute. It was not a surrender, not at all--but a parley, at least.|$|R
6000|$|... "Just <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> {{nine o'clock}} to-morrow, {{and go to}} church as though nothing had happened. Then, when Dr Crofts came in the evening, you would tell him I was down at the school." ...|$|E
60|$|The plan being thus formed, {{the party}} {{separated}} for the night. Rollo {{said that he}} meant <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> half past five; or {{as soon as it}} was light, and go up to the top of the house, and see which way the smoke of Vesuvius was going.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'd gie {{her a good}} shaking if {{she were}} my maid; pretending {{to go out in}} the garden, and leading folk a twelve-mile traipse that have got <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> five o'clock to morrow," [...] said a bark-ripper; who, not working {{regularly}} for Melbury, could afford to indulge in strong opinions.|$|E
5000|$|The Hintner Youth's uniform, {{with its}} blue shirt, gray {{trousers}} and red scarf {{are reminiscent of}} East Germany's Pioneer Organization and the Free German Youth (FDJ). The Hintner Youth organizes an annual summer camp at the Helmut Kohl memorial camp site near Waldhambach {{as well as a}} number of other events, among them climbing the Watzmann in the name of, [...] "heaping <b>up</b> the summit <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>at</b> least 3,001 meters".|$|R
6000|$|They let {{the matter}} drop, and Festing {{presently}} remarked: [...] "The rain makes things difficult, but it's lucky the frost keeps off. I must try <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the frames <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the awkward places before it begins." ...|$|R
60|$|He remade {{his bed and}} {{returned}} to it. He was still dreadfully wakeful. It was suddenly clear {{to him that he}} need never trouble <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> punctually <b>at</b> seven again. That fact shone out upon him like a star through clouds. He was free to lie in bed as long as he liked, <b>get</b> <b>up</b> when he liked, go where he liked, have eggs every morning for breakfast or rashers or bloater paste or.... Also he was going to astonish Miss Walshingham....|$|R
60|$|On this Wednesday morning, George, it seems, clamoured <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> a quarter-past five, {{and persuaded}} {{them to let}} him teach them cycling tricks round the {{cucumber}} frames on Harris's new wheel. Even Mrs. Harris, however, did not blame George on this occasion; she felt intuitively the idea {{could not have been}} entirely his.|$|E
60|$|At {{five o'clock}} {{he would take}} an early morning snack with young Hollis, an engineer's pupil, who had <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> half-past four and make his own coffee, {{so as to be}} down at the works by six. At eight-thirty he would breakfast in a more {{sensible}} fashion with Mr. Blair, on the first floor, and on occasions would join Jack Gadbut, who was a late riser, in a devilled kidney at eleven.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, you're {{likely to}} have a chance if that case goes to court," [...] Upton remarked. [...] "For my part, I hope you can do it. I'd like to see those fellows get what's coming to 'em. I move we turn in now, for we've got <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> an unearthly hour. It's bad enough to turn out before {{daylight}} in the summer, but it makes me shiver to think what it will be at this time of year. Br-r-r-r." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was not so}} {{easy for}} Hans <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> and Tom <b>at</b> the top and Dick at the bottom had to aid him. Then Sam went up like a monkey, and the eldest Rover followed, and the crates and boxes, with the campstool, were allowed to drift away.|$|R
50|$|This new station, branch MP 18.5, {{looked like}} the Tannersville Station, but it didn't have the portico {{sticking}} out of the back. It was a full season passenger station until the New York Central purchased the U&D in 1932. This was when it became a summer-only station, with it being a flagstop in the other seasons. If a passenger were <b>to</b> <b>get</b> picked <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the station in another season, the business and income would be handled by the station agent at Tannersville.|$|R
5000|$|He {{left that}} role in 1989 {{to become a}} host for Montreal talk radio station CJAD, {{remaining}} with that station until joining Cross Country Checkup in 1992. He left Checkup in 1994 to become host of Daybreak, the local morning program on the network's Montreal station CBM. He left the show in 1996, attributing his decision {{to the fact that}} as a resident of Hatley, the job required him <b>to</b> either <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> 2:30 a.m. or stay in Montreal away from his family for most of the week.|$|R
60|$|The editor did {{not look}} up until he had {{finished}} revising a difficult paragraph. By that time Mr. Hamlin had comfortably settled himself on a cane sofa, and, possibly out of deference to his surroundings, had subdued his song to a peculiarly low, soft, and heartbreaking whistle as he unfolded a newspaper. Clean and faultless in his appearance, he had the rare gift of being able <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> two in the afternoon with much of the dewy freshness and all of the moral superiority of an early riser.|$|E
60|$|There is no {{use in a}} {{young man}} who hopes to make a million dollars {{thinking}} he's entitled <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> 7.30, eat force and poached eggs, drink cold water at lunch, and go to bed at 10 p.m. You can't do it. I've seen too many millionaires for that. If {{you want to be a}} millionaire you mustn't get up till ten in the morning. They never do. They daren't. It would be as much as their business is worth if they were seen on the street at half-past nine.|$|E
6000|$|In London, then, for a {{considerable}} time, I used <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> eight o'clock in the morning, and pass an hour alone with Mr. Wilkinson, of the Theatres Royal, in Golden Square;--an hour alone. It was [...] "one, two, three; one, two, three--now jump--right foot more out, Mr. Smith; and if you COULD try and look a little more cheerful; your partner, sir, would like you hall the better." [...] Wilkinson called me Smith, for the fact is, I did not tell him my real name, nor (thank heaven!) does he know it to this day.|$|E
60|$|At this Stiger was silent. He wanted <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> {{and rush}} <b>at</b> Dan, despite the {{levelled}} pistol, but the wounded knee held him back. Had he been a full-blooded Indian {{he would have}} suffered in silence, but, being only a half-breed, and of poor Indian and white blood at that, he groaned dismally.|$|R
6000|$|... "I jest wish I know'd whar to find Him," [...] {{said the}} woman. [...] "I would go; 'pears like I never should get rested again.
