5|$|BLEU’s {{output is}} always a number between 0 and 1. This value {{indicates}} how similar the candidate text is to the reference texts, with values closer to 1 representing more similar texts.

For this reason, it is not necessary <b>to</b> <b>attain</b> <b>a</b> score of 1. Because there are more opportunities to match, adding additional reference translations will increase the BLEU score.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{his success}} as a producer, West's true {{aspiration}} {{was to be a}} rapper.

Multiple record companies ignored him because he did not portray the 'gangsta image' prominent in mainstream hip hop at the time.

5|$|Although he had {{attained}} {{success as}} a producer, Kanye West aspired to be a rapper, but had struggled <b>to</b> <b>attain</b> <b>a</b> record deal. Record companies ignored him {{because he did not}} portray the gangsta image prominent in mainstream hip hop at the time. After a series of meetings with Capitol Records, West was ultimately denied an artist deal. According to Capitol Record's A, Joe Weinberger, he was approached by West and almost signed a deal with him, but another person in the company convinced Capitol's president not to. Desperate to keep West from defecting to another label, then-label head Damon Dash reluctantly signed West to Roc-A-Fella Records. Jay-Z, West's colleague, later admitted that Roc-A-Fella was initially reluctant to support West as a rapper, claiming that many saw him as a producer first and foremost, and that his background contrasted with that of his labelmates.|$|E
5|$|Bonnie {{continued}} to the west-northwest; late on August 9, the storm presented a 9-mile (15-km) wide eyewall, {{a very unusual}} occurrence in a small and weak tropical storm. Bonnie quickly strengthened while turning to the north, a directional shift caused by {{a break in the}} mid-level ridge. The storm briefly weakened late on August 10; it re-strengthened again the following day <b>to</b> <b>attain</b> <b>a</b> peak intensity of 65mph (100km/h). Soon after, strong southwesterly wind shear disrupted the storm, causing Bonnie to weaken again. On August 12, Bonnie made landfall just south of Apalachicola as a 45mph (75km/h) tropical storm. It quickly weakened to a tropical depression, and accelerated northeastward through the southeastern United States. After paralleling the Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina coastlines, Bonnie lost its tropical characteristics on August 14 to the east of New Jersey. Its remnant low continued northeastward, making landfall in Massachusetts and Maine and continuing into Atlantic Canada.|$|E

5|$|Following the 1991 Gulf War and the {{subsequent}} dissolution of the Soviet Union, the United States Navy began to decommission and mothball many of the ships it had brought out of its reserve fleet in the drive <b>to</b> <b>attain</b> <b>a</b> 600-ship Navy. At the height of Navy Secretary John F. Lehman's 600-ship Navy plan, nearly 600ships of all types were active within the Navy. This included fifteen aircraft carriers, four battleships and over 100submarines, along with various other types of ships the overall plan specified. When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991 the Navy sought to return to its traditional, 313-ship composition.

5|$|Initially, Fefa was {{forecast}} {{to intensify}} slightly after reaching hurricane status to reach peak winds of 80mph (130km/h). However, it quickly intensified after a large, ragged eye developed early on August 1.

Based on higher Dvorak numbers, the hurricane could have peaked with winds stronger than 120mph (195km/h). Fefa encountered cooler waters shortly after peaking in intensity, and subsequently began to weaken. The hurricane gradually weakened {{as it turned}} more to the west, a change in motion due to building high pressures to its north, and on August 3 the winds of Fefa dropped to 85mph (135km/h) due to cooler water and dry air.|$|E

5|$|On February 8, 1992, the Ulysses solar probe flew past Jupiter's {{north pole}} at a {{distance}} of 451,000km. This swing-by maneuver was required for Ulysses <b>to</b> <b>attain</b> <b>a</b> very high-inclination orbit around the Sun, increasing its inclination to the ecliptic to 80.2 degrees. The giant planet's gravity bent the spacecraft's flightpath downward and away from the ecliptic plane, placing it into a final orbit around the Sun's north and south poles. The size and shape of the probe's orbit were adjusted to a much smaller degree, so that its aphelion remained at approximately 5AU (Jupiter's distance from the Sun), while its perihelion lay somewhat beyond 1AU (Earth's distance from the Sun). During its Jupiter encounter, the probe made measurements of the planet's magnetosphere. Since the probe had no cameras, no images were taken. In February 2004, the probe arrived again at the vicinity of Jupiter. This time the distance from the planet was much greater—about 240 million km—but it made further observations of Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|Players {{control a}} monocle- and pith helmet–wearing Velociraptor driving a jeep. The {{aim of the}} game is <b>to</b> <b>attain</b> <b>a</b> high score by {{performing}} stunts, damaging the jeep during collisions, collecting orbs, and killing the other Velociraptor which run around the area. The vehicle is equipped with a spiked ball and chain which can be deployed from the tailgate as many times as the player wishes. Deploying the spiked ball increases the difficulty of maneuvering the vehicle. The ball can be released from the chain at any time, if done so during a turn the weapon is launched forward. Players kill other Velociraptor by ramming them with the jeep or crushing them with the spiked ball which is dragged behind the vehicle. Slain dinosaurs can be dragged to exporters by the spiked ball and chain to gain extra points. Exporters are teleporting devices which transport the slain dinosaurs to the future.|$|E
