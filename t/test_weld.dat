5000|$|A Welding Procedure Specification (WPS) is {{the formal}} written {{document}} describing welding procedures, which provides direction to the welder or welding operators for making sound and quality production welds as per the code requirements [...] The {{purpose of the}} document is to guide welders to the accepted procedures so that repeatable and trusted welding techniques are used. A WPS is developed for each material alloy and for each welding type used. Specific codes and/or engineering societies are often {{the driving force behind}} the development of a company's WPS. A WPS is supported by a Procedure Qualification Record (PQR or WPQR). A PQR is a record of a <b>test</b> <b>weld</b> performed and tested (more rigorously) to ensure that the procedure will produce a good weld. Individual welders are certified with a qualification test documented in a Welder Qualification Test Record (WQTR) that shows they have the understanding and demonstrated ability to work within the specified WPS.|$|E
40|$|In my {{bachelor}} thesis I elaborated {{an overview}} of suitable materials for the manufacturing of bicycle frames. Most preferred materials for mass production of bicycle frames are cured aluminum alloys. The best method for joining aluminum tubular frame construction is fusion welding at robot lines in a protective atmosphere of inert gas. We measured the hardness of the welded metal, heat affected zone and base material at the weld of the bicycle frame. Values are very similar in all areas, so the whole frame structure was cured. We welded a <b>test</b> <b>weld,</b> using TIG method. Hardness of the <b>test</b> <b>weld</b> is about 24. 5 % lower, than hardness of the weld from manufacturer. Hardness of the heat affected zone is even lower. The curing of the whole frame construction is therefore very important. There is a concentration cavity in the cut of the weld from manufacturer and {{the root of the}} weld is not welded all over. The same defects are in the cuts of our test welds, there is also porosity in one of the test welds. But the <b>test</b> <b>weld</b> is satisfying, despite the defects...|$|E

40|$|Friction Stir Welding (FSW) is a {{relatively}} new joining technique and the application of the technique is still limited. Among the advantages of this method compared to the conventional welding techniques is that it reduces problem associated to metal re-solidification as the technique involves no melting stages. Such advantages are especially applicable for joining high strength aerospace material such as aluminium Metal Matrix Composite (MMC). In this study, the physical and mechanical properties of Friction Stir Welding (FSW) on aluminium 6092 /SiC 25 p /T 6 was discussed and established. Weld characteristic was analyzed using SEM, EDX and XRD, while mechanical properties were analyzed using Vickers hardness and tensile <b>test.</b> <b>Weld</b> microstructure observation shows distribution of fine and coarse particle cross the weld area. Microstructure analysis reveals difference in redistribution of particles between the zones in the weld area, which consist of the weld centre, advancing and retreating side of the tool. XRD results depict insignificant difference of post weld stresses as well as maintained material phases. The weld centre shows increase in hardness and an adequate retainment of the material strength. In conclusion FSW causes changes in the material microstructure due to the onset of plastic deformation and the post weld result shows it does retain or even improve some of the material properties...|$|E

Während der Erstellung der Schweißnaht mittels der WIG-Orbital-Schweißtechnik wurden im Nahtbereich Temperaturen und Verformungen gemessen. Nach Fertigstellung der Schweißverbindung wurden die Schweißeigenspannungen auf der Rohrinnenoberfläche experimentell ermittelt. Die schweißbegleitenden Messungen lieferten eine breite Datenbasis zur Validierung von Berechnungsmodellen. Zur Beschreibung des Werkstoffverhaltens unter schweißtypischer Beanspruchung wurden Werkstoffuntersuchungen bis zu einer Prüftemperatur von 1300 °C durchgeführt. Auf der Basis der Werkstoffversuche wurde ein aus der Literatur bekanntes phänomenologisches Stoffgesetz zur Beschreibung von gemischter nichtlinearer kinematischer und isotroper Verfestigung modifiziert und in den FE-Code ABAQUS implementiert. Eine Finite Elemente Analyse der Versuchsschweißung zeigte, dass die thermische Beanspruchung der Nahtumgebung sowie die Verformungsmechanismen im nahtnahen Bereich numerisch sehr gut wiedergegeben werden können. Crack {{growth in}} {{stainless}} steel pipes {{can be caused}} by inter-granular stress corrosion cracking (IGSCC). This damage mechanism requires the simultaneous occurrence of high oxygen content in the fluid, sensitized material and tensile stresses. Both sensitization and tensile stresses can be the result of the thermo-mechanical loading due to welding. The loading of the circumferential pipe welds depends on many factors, like the pipe geometry, welding techniques or welding velocity. The influence of these parameters on the thermo-mechanical loading allows the risk of IGSCC to be investigated using computational methods. The aim {{of this study was to}} develop and validate a qualified computational model for welding simulation. Within the framework of this study four multi-pass pipe welds were fabricated. The thin walled, austenitic pipes were welded by Orbital Gas Tungsen Arc Welding. During the welding process, temperatures and displacements were monitored. When welding was complete residual stress measurements were performed using X-ray diffraction techniques. The measurements during welding generated the database for the validation of the computational calculations. In doing so they enable the understanding of the thermo- mechanical effects of the welding process. An important part of the computational weld analysis is the description of the temperature-dependent elastic-plastic material behavior. Therefore, stress-strain curves were determined for different loading histories and temperatures up to 1300 °C. The investigations corroborate the combined isotropic and nonlinear kinematic hardening of stainless steel. A finite element analysis of the <b>test</b> <b>weld</b> showed corresponding results between the measured and the calculated loading of the root region...|$|E

40|$|Crack {{arrest of}} fast running cracks is an {{important}} issue for the safety of steel structures. Crack arrest design can prevent fatal damage of large structures by restricting the influence of the incidents. Therefore crack arrest design is important especially for very large structure, where accidents may cause huge economical and social losses. Propagating shear fracture, long running ductile crack propagation in pipelines and brittle crack propagation in heavy thick shipbuilding steels have been investigated. For the propagating shear fracture issue, a new HLP simulation model, applicable to various backfill conditions, including underwater backfill, was developed. The proposed backfill model {{can be applied to the}} prediction of the crack arrest of propagating shear fracture under various backfill conditions. The new HLP simulation was successful in estimating full-scale burst tests with various backfill depths. The new HLP simulation for underwater pipelines indicated that propagating shear cracks are easily arrested in offshore pipelines compared to onshore pipeline. The toughness requirement of the line pipe for preventing propagating shear fracture can be significantly smaller in underwater pipelines compared to onshore pipelines. The margin of the underwater pipeline for propagating shear fracture was clarified by the new model developed in this thesis. For brittle crack arrest, an empirical approach for long crack propagation has been conducted. Several large-scale crack arrest tests were carried out in order to investigate the long crack arrestability of heavy-thick shipbuilding steel plates. All plates and their welded joints used in this study satisfied the Charpy toughness requirement for EH-grade shipbuilding steels and welded joints. A brittle crack ran along a welded joint and penetrated through the test plate under a stress exceeding 200 MPa, despite the presence of longitudinal stiffeners across the <b>test</b> <b>weld.</b> A brittle crack in a base plate model test with longitudinal stiffeners propagated through the specimen under the maximum design stress. These results suggest that EH-grade cannot ensure arrestability even in the base plate, in case of heavy thick shipbuilding steel. Two crack arrest tests were conducted in order to demonstrate the possibility of long crack arrest using high arrestability steels. The test results indicated that the crack arrest concept could be achieved by a combination of high arrest toughness materials and a special fabrication method which can derive a brittle crack into the base plate of high arrestability plate. The crack arrest design can be used in practice even for large-scale structures using heavy thick steel plates. The effective K concept, as proposed by Machida, et al. 31), provides the boundary of the “arrest” and “propagate” data in the large-scale tests conducted in this work. The effective K concept was found to be valid even for long crack propagation of such a heavy thick steel plate as investigated in this paper.
