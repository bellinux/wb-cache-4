40|$|Disparities {{in health}} {{exist between the}} three main {{population}} groups in Israel, non-immigrant Jews, immigrants from the former Soviet Union (arriving in Israel since 1990) and Arabs. This study examines the relationship between health and socioeconomic status in this multicultural population and assesses to what extent subjective and objective socioeconomic measures may explain <b>the</b> <b>disparities</b> in health. AÂ random cross sectional telephone survey of 1004 Israelis aged 35 - 65 was performed. The questionnaire measured physical and mental health-related quality of life using the Short Form 12. Information regarding subjective socioeconomic status (SSS) and objective socioeconomic status (SES) was collected. Arabs and immigrant women from the former Soviet Union had worse physical health compared to non-immigrant Jews. Immigrant and Arab men and women had worse mental health compared to non-immigrant Jews. Multivariable log-linear regression analysis adjusting for age, SSS or SES explained <b>the</b> <b>disparities</b> in physical health between Arab and non-immigrant Jewish men. However, SSS and SES did not explain <b>the</b> <b>disparities</b> in physical health between the three groups of women. <b>The</b> <b>disparities</b> in mental health between immigrants and non-immigrant Jews {{can be explained by}} SSS for both men and women, whereas <b>the</b> <b>disparities</b> between Arabs and Jews can be explained by objective SES only among women. Employed men reported better physical and mental health. Part of <b>the</b> <b>disparities</b> in mental health in Israel can be attributed to differences in SSS and SES in the different groups.

In comparison, Kampuchea had an army of 70,000, only a few heavy tanks, 200 armoured vehicles, and limited air capability. Despite facing such heavy odds, Kampuchea showed no signs of hesitation as its military continued to assault Vietnam’s border regions. In January 1978, Kampuchean forces still held portions of Vietnamese territory and began overrunning Vietnamese outposts in Hà Tiên Province.

5|$|For {{stationary}} shots where Superman is seen flying toward or {{away from}} the camera, blue screen matte techniques were used. Reeve would be photographed suspended against a blue screen. While a special device made his cape flap to give the illusion of movement, the actor himself would remain stationary (save for banking his body). Instead, the camera would use a mixture of long zoom-ins and zoom-outs and dolly in/dolly outs to cause him to become larger or smaller in the frame. The blue background would then be photochemically removed and Reeve's isolated image would be 'inserted' into a matted area of a background plate shot. The zoom-ins or zoom-outs would {{give the appearance of}} flying away or toward the contents of the background plate. <b>The</b> <b>disparity</b> in lighting and color between the matted image and the background plate, the occasional presence of black matte lines (where the matte area and the matted image—in this case, Superman—do not exactly match up), and the slightly unconvincing impression of movement achieved through the use of zoom lenses is characteristic of these shots.|$|E
