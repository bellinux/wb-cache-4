500|$|The Lovas killings ( [...] , , [...] ) {{involved}} {{the killing of}} 70 Croat civilian residents of the village of Lovas between 10–18 October 1991, during the Croatian War of Independence. The killings took place during and {{in the immediate aftermath}} of the occupation of the village by the Yugoslav People's Army (Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija – JNA) supported by Croatian Serb forces and Dušan Silni paramilitaries on 10 October, two days after Croatia declared independence from Yugoslavia. The occupation occurred during the Battle of Vukovar, as the JNA sought to consolidate its control over the area surrounding the city of Vukovar.

500|$|Despite Cain's disability, author Andersen Gabrych {{describes}} the character's unique form of language {{as the key}} factor in what makes Cain an excellent detective; the ability <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> room and [...] "know" [...] something is wrong based on body language. During the first arc of the Batgirl comic book series entitled [...] "Silent Running", Cassandra Cain encounters a psychic who [...] "reprograms" [...] her brain, enabling her to comprehend verbal language, while simultaneously losing the ability to predict movements. This issue is resolved during the second arc of the series, [...] "A Knight Alone", when Batgirl encounters the assassin Lady Shiva who agrees to teach her how to predict movement once again. Six years after its debut, DC Comics canceled the Batgirl comic book series with issue #73 (2006), ending with Cain relinquishing her role as Batgirl.|$|E

He finds her with Walter, possessed and about <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> deathtrap, and a fight {{between the two men}} ensues. There are four possible endings, determined by whether or not Eileen survived the fight and on the condition of Henry's apartment. The [...] "21 Sacraments" [...] ending sees Walter and his child manifestation in his apartment, while the radio reveals that Henry and Eileen have died, along with the superintendent Frank Sunderland and several others. In [...] "Eileen's Death," [...] Henry awakens in his apartment, and learns from his radio that Eileen has died, to his sorrow. In [...] "Mother," [...] Henry escapes from his apartment building, and brings flowers to Eileen, who plans to return to the apartment building.

He has plastered the walls of the elevator with MRI scans of all of the successful surgeries they have had together. He points out certain surgeries, like the first one they scrubbed in on together, or the one when he first realized she would become a great surgeon, and the one he just performed on Izzie for which Meredith believed in him. He tells her that she doesn't freeze. She's seen the worst and has been through the worst, but that is how she has the strength to help everyone through their times of hardship. Her dark and twistiness is a virtue, not a flaw. He doesn't get down on one knee. He doesn't ask any questions. He simply says that he loves her and wants to spend the rest of his life with her. Meredith kisses him.|$|R

2500|$|Dennett makes a {{distinction}} between the presence of representation, and the representation of presence. The example he gives regarding this distinction is this: if you were <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> room covered in identical portraits of Marilyn Monroe, you would see that there are many of them, but you would not really be seeing them all at once. There would be no detailed representation of each individual portrait just the knowledge that they are present. Dennet's theory raises two relevant questions: 1) How does the visual system detect change in the environment? 2) How much information is retained in each saccade? The proposed answer to these questions lies in several mechanisms that support a high sensitivity to change in each visual fixation. These mechanisms are: retinal adaptation, [...] "pop-out" [...] systems, and motion detectors. The implication of this view is that little information is needed to be retained between each saccade.|$|E
2500|$|Both Kiem and Hong {{claimed the}} plan {{had been to}} mortar Nui Dat to draw a {{reaction}} force into an ambush, not to attack the base. They confirmed the dual military and political aim, emphasising the disruption caused by 1 ATF lodging at Nui Dat and the intention to affect Australian public opinion. The forced evacuation of Long Tan and Long Phuoc had curtailed the Viet Cong who regarded it as a liberated area, and it {{was chosen as the}} ambush site to demonstrate to the local population that they were still able to operate despite the Australian presence. Hong explained the ambush was sprung within range of the artillery at Nui Dat because they correctly assumed no reaction force would move outside the cover it provided, and instead planned on rapidly closing with and destroying it before artillery or air support could be brought in. They planned to occupy prepared positions in the rubber plantation and destroy whatever force was sent to locate the mortars following the attack on Nui Dat. A stop force had been placed to the east, while another was to the south to hold the Australians in place, reasoning that the thick undergrowth to the north would force them between the two. D445 Battalion was then to close the rear of the ambush, attacking from the north-west. A larger ambush would then have been staged outside artillery range along the withdrawal route subsequently used by the 275th Regiment. Meanwhile, the 274th Regiment was positioned north of Binh Ba astride Route 2 to ambush US forces should they try to relieve 1 ATF. Hong later asked: [...] "How can you claim a victory when you allowed yourselves <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> trap that we had set? Admittedly we did not finish the job, but that was only because time beat us and your reinforcements arrived. I mean you did not even attempt to follow us up. How can you claim a significant victory from that sort of behaviour?" ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{the casting}} team had {{successfully}} cast the actors who were playing Sam's brothers, {{they already knew}} what facial attributes they needed for Sam to create a similar family resemblance. Producer Corinne Hollingworth has commented, [...] "we'd decided on Steve [...] and Ross [...] and we knew the sort of round, open face we needed. We saw Danniella (Westbrook) first and liked her, then saw some others, but came back to her." [...] The actress, {{a graduate of the}} Sylvia Young Theatre School, had already appeared in the soap aged 11, as an extra who rollerskated across the soap's fictional setting of Albert Square in front of the characters Den and Angie Watts. At the time, Westbrook's local paper ran a story on her with the punchline, [...] "who knows, one day she might be the show's star". Eighty girls auditioned for the part of Sam, but these eighty were eventually whittled down to four. On her final casting callback, Westbrook bumped into actors Michelle Gayle and Sid Owen, who were already on the EastEnders cast as Hattie Tavernier and Ricky Butcher respectively. Westbrook already knew Gayle, whose character was to be Sam's screen best friend, and she introduced her to Owen, whose character was scripted to be Sam's boyfriend. According to Westbrook, she liked Owen right from the start and was amused by his response of [...] "You're a bit of alright. You can be Sam!". On Westbrook's last audition, she and the other hopefuls were forced to stand for a lengthy period in front of a panel of the show's producers, directors and writers while they continuously compared images of the auditionees to images of Kemp and McFadden, looking for a resemblance. Westbrook was given the part. She has commented, [...] "they told me they were looking for someone bright and bubbly, who could be the sister of Phil and Grant, and my round face fitted." [...] In the character's first scene, Sam walked past Ricky Butcher and gave him a [...] "flirty backward glance", causing him <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> lamp-post. Westbrook was initially given a three-month contract with the soap, but halfway through her contract the producers extended it as they felt [...] "the character of Sam had gelled well with the others and they wanted to include her in more storylines".|$|E

2500|$|Although Susan Harris {{had planned}} for five seasons of Soap, {{the program was}} {{abruptly}} canceled by ABC after its fourth season. Therefore, the final one-hour episode, which originally aired on April 20, 1981, did not serve as a series finale and instead ended with several unresolved cliffhangers. These involve a suicidal Chester preparing to kill Danny and Annie (his son and wife) after catching them in bed together, an irreversibly hypnotized Jodie believing {{himself to be a}} 90-year-old Jewish man, Burt preparing <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>into</b> <b>an</b> ambush orchestrated by his political enemies, and Jessica about to be executed by a Communist firing squad. Vlasic Foods pulled their sponsorship of the program shortly after this episode aired and ABC announced that the program was not picked up for its planned fifth season. The official reason given by the network was its declining ratings. However, according to the Museum of Broadcast Communications, Soap [...] "ended under suspicion that resistance from ad agencies may have caused ABC to cancel [...] at that point" [...] because its still controversial content was negatively affecting its relationship with sponsors.|$|R
