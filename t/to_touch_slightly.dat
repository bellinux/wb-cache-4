"As I am {{speaking}} of poetry, {{it will not}} be amiss <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>slightly</b> upon the most singular heresy in its modern history--the heresy of what is called, very foolishly, the Lake School. Some years ago I might have been induced, by an occasion like the present, to attempt a formal refutation of their doctrine; at present it would be a work of supererogation. The wise must bow to the wisdom of such men as Coleridge and Southey, but being wise, have laughed at poetical theories so prosaically exemplified.|$|E

The amount of bias created from this misjudgment fluctuates according to the target’s position on the screen. Additionally, the percentage of touches that activate a specific target varies according {{to the size of the}} tactual recognition field. This study sought to match three square tactual recognition field sizes with the amount of touch bias occurring in each location. The results showed that although bias differed according to location, the tactual recognition fields did not vary enough in size, nor were they large enough to find a significant difference between them in the number of touches captured according to the location of the target. The tactual recognition field that optimally captures responses varies in size over display position and is non-square in shape...|$|E

Some archaic features of Slavic word formation in comparison with Baltic one are distinguished: 1) nomina agentis with old Indo-European suffix *-tel- were left whale in Slavic, but they were completly pushed out by the corresponding derivatives with new suffixes   *-tāi̯o- (<* -tā- +* -i̯o-),  *- ē i̯o- (<*ē + *-i̯o-) in Baltic; 2) the adjectives with suffix *-(i) i̯o - kept their produktivity in Slavic, but they were replaced by the corresponding derivatives with suffixes *-in o-, *-ini̯o(<* -ino- +*-i̯o*) in Baltic; 3) the substantives with old Indo-European suffix *-mo- were also productive in Common Slavic, but they were changed by the derivatives with new suffixes * -i-mo-, *-u-mo- in Baltic. There are some mor old differences in Baltic and Slavic word formation. The suffix * -(i) i̯o - was often used on the formation of nomina collectiva in Slavic and in many other Indo-European languages (cf. Slav, s ъ n ь je, Skt. svapn(i) yam, Lat. so mni um, Gk. έν-υχνιον, Lith. sapnỹs “dream”), but this type of derivatives is almost unknow in Baltic. Nomina deminutiva with suffix * -iko- (<i + * -ko-) are very productive in Slavic, but they become extinct in Baltic (especialy in East Baltic). On the other hand the related suffix *-uko- (< u+*-ko-) is mor frequently used in this case in Baltic than in Slavic is. Some suffixes have a different form but a similar function in Baltic than in Slavic, cf. Balt. *-ībā- (< ī +*-bhā-) and Slav. * -iba (<i + -bhā-), Balt. *-ūno-(<ū + * -no-) and Slav. -uns (<u/ou + *-no-). Thees and other differences shows that the Proto-Slavic system of the word formation can be hardly derived direct from Proto-Baltic one. They could be better explained on the base of well known devergence theory, accor­ding to which the Baltic and the Slavic languages were descended from the different dialects of the north area of Indo-European parent language and only a bit later the period of close contacts of Proto-Baltic and Proto-Slavic came. There are some inovations in Baltic, Slavic and Germanic, which came of on the period, when thees three groups of languages were not separated from the north dialect area of Indo-European. One of thees inovations is sugested to be the suffix * - ī t i̯o - (<*- īto- + - i̯o -), the oldest function of which is the formation of nomina atributiva (cf. Lith. ausỹtė “wintry cap with ear-tabs"”, Latv. lēnītis “warm south or west wind”, South Slav. golit’ ь “naked, poor man”). Through the process of the meaning specialization the derivatives with suffix * - ī t i̯o - got the meaning of nomina deminutiva in Baltic (cf. Lith. sūn ỹ tis, Latv. sūnītis “a little son”), the meaning of nomina patronimica and originis in Slavic (cf. Slav, bratit' ь “a brothes son”, slob o dit’ ь   “countryman from a free land”) and the meaning of nomina collectiva in Germanic (cf. MHG. geveter ī de “parents”). Later on the period of close contacts of Proto-Baltic and Proto-Slavic languages some derivatives with this suffix got also the meaning of nomina patroninica and nomina originis in Baltic dialects (especialy in West Baltic, cf. Lith. dial, vókytis, Latv. vācītis “German”) from Proto-Slavic and some of them got the meaning of nomina deminutiva in South Slavic languages (cf. vl̥’čit’ ь „a little wolf-cub”) from Proto-Baltic. There are some old inovations which came of in Proto-Baltic and later feld under the Proto-Slavic language. In this way the development of nomina agentis with suffixes * - tā i̯o - (cf. Lith. artójas, OPruss. artoys E 236, Slav rataj ь “ploughman, fanner”), * -ē i̯o - (cf. Lith. siuvė́jas, Latv. šuvējs, ORuss. š ь vej “tailor”), * -iko- (cf. Lith. siuvìkas, OPruss schuwikis (Schuwert) E 496, Slav. š ь v ь c ь “tailor”) which is very productive in Baltic and very rare in Slavic, could be explained. The process of a substitution of old suffixes with o stem for corresponding suffixes with (i) i̯o stem is sugested to come of in Baltic and <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>slightly</b> Slavic languages too. The result of this process is the formation of Common Baltic and Slavic suffixes * -el i̯o - (from *- elo-), *-ēl i̯o - (from *-ēlo-), *-ōl i̯o - (from *-ōlo-), * -ik i̯o - (from * -iko-). </p...|$|E

6000|$|In this {{proposal}} {{there was much}} that pleased old David,--there was bed, board, and bountith--it was a decent situation--the lassie would be under Mrs. Saddletree's eye, who had an upright walk, and lived close by the Tolbooth Kirk, in which might still be heard the comforting doctrines {{of one of those}} few ministers of the Kirk of Scotland who had not bent the knee unto Baal, according to David's expression, or become accessory to the course of national defections,--union, toleration, patronages, and a bundle of prelatical Erastian oaths which had been imposed on the church since the Revolution, and particularly in the reign of [...] "the late woman" [...] (as he called Queen Anne), the last of that unhappy race of Stuarts. In the good man's security concerning the soundness of the theological doctrine which his daughter was to hear, he was nothing disturbed on account of the snares of a different kind, to which a creature so beautiful, young, and wilful, might be exposed in the centre of a populous and corrupted city. The fact is, that he thought with so much horror on all approaches to irregularities of the nature most to be dreaded in such cases, that he would as soon have suspected and guarded against Effie's being induced to become guilty of the crime of murder. He only regretted that she should live under the same roof with such a worldly-wise man as Bartoline Saddletree, whom David never suspected of being an ass as he was, but considered as one really endowed with all the legal knowledge to which he made pretension, and only liked him the worse for possessing it. The lawyers, especially those amongst them who sate as ruling elders in the General Assembly of the Kirk, had been forward in promoting the measures of patronage, of the abjuration oath, and others, which, in the opinion of David Deans, were a breaking down of the carved work of the sanctuary, and an intrusion upon the liberties of the kirk. Upon the dangers of listening to the doctrines of a legalised formalist, such as Saddletree, David gave his daughter many lectures; so much so, that he had time <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> but <b>slightly</b> on the dangers of chambering, company-keeping, and promiscuous dancing, to which, at her time of life, most people would have thought Effie more exposed, than to the risk of theoretical error in her religious faith.|$|R
