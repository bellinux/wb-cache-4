5|$|During Reagan's presidency, {{federal income}} tax rates were lowered {{significantly}} with {{the signing of the}} Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981, which lowered the top marginal tax bracket from 70% to 50% and the lowest bracket from 14% to 11%. Other tax increases passed by Congress and signed by Reagan ensured however <b>that</b> <b>tax</b> revenues over his two terms were 18.2% of GDP as compared to 18.1% over the 40-year period of 1970–2010. Then, in 1982 the Job Training Partnership Act of 1982 was signed into law, initiating one of the United States' first public–private partnerships and {{a major part of the}} president's job creation program. Reagan's Assistant Secretary of Labor and Chief of Staff, Al Angrisani, was a primary architect of the bill.|$|E
5|$|Vinícius Segalla from UOL said {{tax credits}} and BNDES {{resources}} are public money and that the concession of those resources to Corinthians are unclear. The federal government dismissed the notion, saying <b>that</b> <b>tax</b> credits are intended to encourage economical growth and work opportunities for the areas surrounding the stadia. The city government said tax credits are not subsidies and the stadium will {{be a boon to}} the city, especially the east zone. They also said subsidies given to the Brazilian Grand Prix and Carnaval among others also bring benefits to the city. Public Prosecutor Marcelo Milani contested the validity of tax credits issued by the city and sued then-mayor Gilberto Kassab for R$1.74billion; the judges said Milani's case was without merit and dismissed it.|$|E

25|$|There is {{debate between}} {{politicians}} and economists {{over the role}} of tax policy in mitigating or exacerbating wealth inequality.

25|$|The {{higher costs}} to labour and capital imposed by income tax causes {{deadweight}} loss in an economy, being {{the loss of}} economic activity from people deciding not to invest capital or use time productively because of the burden <b>that</b> <b>tax</b> would impose on those activities. There is also a loss from individuals and professional advisors devoting time to tax-avoiding behaviour instead of economically-productive activities.|$|E

25|$|For the 2015-16 budget year, Lakeland School Board {{applied for}} two {{exceptions}} to exceed their Act 1 Index limit: {{for special education}} cost and for its rapidly rising teacher pension costs.

Another 187 school districts adopted a preliminary budget leaving open the option of exceeding the Index limit.|$|E
5000|$|Franklin {{drafted the}} Assembly's response, {{the gist of}} which was <b>that</b> <b>taxing</b> the {{proprietary}} estates, {{along with all the}} other estates in the province, was [...] "perfectly equitable and just." [...] Eventually, Morris admitted that the terms of his commission prohibited his accepting any measure <b>that</b> <b>taxed</b> the proprietary estates. This prompted Franklin to bypass Morris and take on the proprietors themselves, which led to Franklin's removal to London in 1757 to argue the Assembly's side in the dispute with the proprietors.|$|R
50|$|From these observations, Layard concludes <b>that</b> <b>taxes</b> serve another purpose besides {{paying for}} public {{services}} (usually for public goods) and redistributing income.

40|$|In {{a recent}} review of the literature, Wasylenko (1981) {{concluded}} <b>that</b> <b>taxes</b> have very little effect on interregional business location decisions. The present study examines the impact of state taxes and incentive programs on the spatial distribution of inward foreign direct investment in manufacturing. The results reveal <b>that</b> <b>taxes,</b> which were measured in various ways, deter foreign direct investment. Conversely, states providing tax incentives, financial assistance, and employment assistance tended to have larger numbers of foreign direct investments.

25|$|The tax-protester {{phenomenon}} is {{not restricted to}} the United States.

25|$|Gross {{domestic}} product growth of 3.6% in 2000 {{was expected to}} have fallen to around 1.5% in 2001, and only a minor recovery was forecast for 2002.

25|$|Necker {{realised}} {{that the}} country's extremely regressive tax system subjected {{the lower classes}} to a heavy burden, while numerous exemptions existed for the nobility and clergy. He argued that the country could not be taxed higher; <b>that</b> <b>tax</b> exemptions for the nobility and clergy must be reduced; and proposed that borrowing more money would solve the country's fiscal shortages. Necker published a report to support this claim that underestimated the deficit by roughly 36million livres, and proposed restricting {{the power of the}} parlements.|$|E
25|$|Laffer {{assumes that}} the {{government}} would collect no income tax at a 100% tax rate because there would be no incentive to earn income.
