5|$|In the {{subsequent}} years, successive waves of explorers and traders would introduce epidemics of cholera and smallpox, which {{would take a}} heavy <b>toll</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> native peoples and contributed to a substantial reduction in population.|$|E
5|$|Tourism and {{deforestation}} in {{the surroundings}} {{have taken a}} heavy <b>toll</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lake, adversely affecting its water quality, reducing the water levels and destroying the fish population. As part of conservation measures, the government is undertaking de-silting, de-weeding, water treatment, and afforestation as well as mass awareness programme.|$|E
5|$|After World War II, the {{military}} {{continued to play}} a major role in the local economy, but post-Cold War cutbacks took a heavy <b>toll</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> local defense and aerospace industries. The resulting downturn led San Diego leaders to seek to diversify the city's economy by focusing on research and science, as well as tourism.|$|E

5000|$|The Government's tolling {{strategy}} is based <b>on</b> distance-based charging. <b>Tolling</b> <b>on</b> new sections of WestConnex (the M4 East, the New M5 and the M4-M5 Link) will begin as each section opens. <b>Tolling</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> existing M4 (widened section between Parramatta and Homebush) {{will begin in}} 2017. [...] <b>Tolling</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> existing M5 East will begin in 2020. <b>Tolling</b> (by WestConnex) <b>on</b> <b>the</b> M5 South-West will begin in 2026, when the current concession was due to end. Tolling will continue until 2060.|$|R

5|$|After {{the initial}} boom had ended, {{explicitly}} anti-foreign and racist attacks, laws and confiscatory taxes sought {{to drive out}} foreigners—not just Native Americans—from the mines, especially the Chinese and Latin American immigrants mostly from Sonora, Mexico and Chile. The <b>toll</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> American immigrants was severe as well: one in twelve forty-niners perished, as the death and crime rates during the Gold Rush were extraordinarily high, and the resulting vigilantism also took its toll.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 20th century, Michigan's harsh winters {{had taken a}} <b>toll</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> terra cotta statue, as had {{vandalism}} by fans of MSU's rival school, the University of Michigan. While annual repair work helped stem {{the damage done by}} precipitation, extreme cold, and vandalism, the statue needed more intensive repair.|$|E
5|$|His {{primary focus}} was gay-themed writing, though {{he also wrote}} about the {{entertainment}} industry. Mostly satirical, his writing was filled with increasingly clear anger and disdain for the Republican neo-con agenda, especially after the AIDS pandemic began to take a large <b>toll</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> gay community. A very strong voice in gay literature, Baker had admirers and detractors for his gay radical stance, both in the mainstream literary {{community as well as}} the gay community itself.|$|E

25|$|The {{proposal}} {{planned to}} put <b>tolls</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> new roadway {{to pay for}} the cost of building it.|$|R
50|$|<b>Tolls</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> section from Takaido Interchange to Hachiōji Interchange {{are charged}} at a flat rate. As of April 2008 <b>the</b> <b>toll</b> <b>on</b> this section is 600 yen for a regular {{passenger}} car. <b>Tolls</b> <b>on</b> all other {{sections of the}} expressway are assessed according to distance travelled {{in the same manner}} as most other national expressways. Also, <b>tolls</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> section from Sonohara Interchange to Nakatsugawa Interchange are assessed at 1.6 times the normal rate to account for the high cost of constructing the Enasan Tunnel. Vehicles carrying dangerous materials are forbidden from using this tunnel and must use alternate routes.|$|R
5|$|In 1975, the Jones Beach Parkway Authority {{raised the}} <b>toll</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Southern State Parkway from to 25cents, while the Loop Parkway {{retained}} its 25cent toll. The change faced immediate {{criticism from the}} New York State Legislature, and the Democratic members tried to rescind the toll hike. The power Robert Moses still had in {{a deal with the}} State of New York made sure that only his authority could choose when to raise and rollback tolls. However, the deals never prohibited the state from buying out the bonds the authority had themselves and thus take over the roads maintained by the Jones Beach Parkway Authority. Governor Hugh Carey had yet to craft the $12billion state budget for 1978, and he proposed a deal to forgo the $24 million (1978USD) debt that the agency had accumulated and eliminate the <b>toll</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Loop Parkway by taking over the roads.|$|E
5|$|In April, Austrian forces {{approached}} Mantua {{and started}} their siege. At first, the Austrians were content to simply blockade the fortress, {{but with the}} artillery duels and occasional skirmishes, attrition began taking its <b>toll</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> defenders. The defenders were also weakened by diminishing food supplies, and their morale was undermined by lack of payment.|$|E
5|$|In July 1934, {{as part of}} a depression-relief effort, the Carrying Place Trail through Prince Edward County and the United Counties of Lennox and Addington {{was assumed}} as an {{extension}} of Highway33. (The section between Trenton and Glenora was assumed on July4, 1934, the section between Adolphustown and Kingston on July11.) The provincially operated ferries, as the first to operate without a <b>toll</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> route, entered service after 1936.|$|E

5|$|The Great Depression {{took its}} <b>toll</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> congregation, and {{membership}} dropped. In order {{to cope with}} the financial burdens, dues were raised, teachers were given endorsed notes rather than paychecks, the Executive Secretary was laid off, pews were sold, and individual members provided mortgage guarantees. The synagogue survived, and membership recovered; by 1934 there were 300 members, and by 1944 there were 1,100.|$|E
5|$|The {{losses at}} Fort Lee and Washington placed a heavy <b>toll</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Patriots. When they {{evacuated}} their forts, {{they were forced}} to leave behind critical supplies and munitions. Many troops had been killed or taken prisoner, and the morale of the remaining troops was low. Few believed that they could win the war and gain independence.|$|E
5|$|A third {{attempt was}} planned for September 13; bad weather delayed {{attempts}} until September 16. However, General Schuyler was {{by this time}} so ill that he thought it necessary to withdraw to Ticonderoga. He left that day, turning full command of the invasion over to Montgomery. Schuyler {{was not the only}} one falling ill; the bad weather, and the swampy, malaria-infested terrain of Île-aux-Noix was also taking a <b>toll</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> troops, as more of them became ill as well. The bad news was tempered by good; an additional 250 troops, in the form of a company of Green Mountain Boys under Seth Warner, and another company of New Hampshire men under Colonel Timothy Bedel, arrived at Île-aux-Noix.|$|E

5000|$|... 1806-1813 - The Napoleonic Grand Duchy of Berg is in {{existence}} from October 1806 until 18 November 1813. Its departements include the Ruhr département, whose prefecture {{was based in}} Dortmund, and the Rhine département with prefecture in Düsseldorf. Freiherr Gisbert of Romberg zu Brünninghausen was appointed as prefect of the Ruhr département. The first ruler of Berg is Joachim Murat, Napoleon's brother-in-law. <b>The</b> French abolished <b>tolls</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> River Ruhr, {{just as they had}} previously abolished <b>tolls</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Rhine (<b>on</b> <b>the</b> Rhine <b>tolls</b> extracted at Cologne had previously been a severe barrier to river traffic).|$|R
25|$|In 1851 the Lancaster Canal leased <b>the</b> <b>tolls</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{southern}} {{end to the}} Leeds and Liverpool Canal in return for an annual rent, and this agreement was made permanent in 1864.|$|R
5|$|Concerts and boxing matches {{eventually}} {{took their}} <b>toll</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> pitch. In 2008, late post-concert pitch renovation, {{combined with an}} early start to the football season, led to the pitch not being ready for the first home fixture, causing the club to play its UEFA Cup first round qualifying match at Barnsley's Oakwell Stadium and a moratorium to be imposed on the staging of non-football events at Eastlands. In May 2010, the club invested in a new pitch and summer concerts resumed in 2011 when Take That played eight nights, with ticket sales totalling approximately 400,000.|$|E
5|$|During the Battle of Pasir Panjang, Bukit Chandu was {{the last}} bastion of the 1st and 2nd Battalion Malay Regiment who, {{together}} with the 2nd Loyals Regiment, defended the western and southern parts of Singapore from 8–14 February 1942. Despite running low on ammunition and food, the Malay Regiments put up strong resistance, inflicting a heavy <b>toll</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Japanese invaders. Outnumbered, the defenders were finally overrun and massacred by reinforced Japanese forces. A Malay officer, Second Lieutenant Adnan Bin Saidi, was captured alive and tortured by the Japanese, before being executed. The story of his heroism became well known throughout Singapore.|$|E
5|$|Food is {{essential}} to life. Feeding more than seven billion human bodies takes a heavy <b>toll</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Earth's resources. This begins with the appropriation of about 38% of the Earth's land surface and about 20% of its net primary productivity. Added to this are the resource-hungry activities of industrial agribusiness—everything from the crop need for irrigation water, synthetic fertilizers and pesticides to the resource costs of food packaging, transport (now {{a major part of}} global trade) and retail. Environmental problems associated with industrial agriculture and agribusiness are now being addressed through such movements as sustainable agriculture, organic farming and more sustainable business practices.|$|E

50|$|Possibly {{because of}} high <b>tolls</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> privately owned bridge, in the {{beginning}} there were few users. In 1900, the prefectural government took {{over control of the}} bridge's finances and made it toll-free.|$|R
5|$|In 1778, the British Army {{burned the}} city in {{retaliation}} for the acts of local privateers. The fire destroyed 34 ships, 76 shops, 26 storehouses and 11 homes. After independence, the city concentrated on rebuilding its major industry, and in 1791, the Rebecca set sail, becoming the first American whaler to harvest oil from the Pacific. Two decades later, the War of 1812 again took a <b>toll</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> industry, which recovered again and by 1823, New Bedford's fleet equalled Nantucket's in tonnage. Four years later the city's whaling industry had surpassed the island's in barrels produced.|$|E
5|$|In 1900 {{a massive}} {{hurricane}} devastated {{the city of}} Galveston and heavily damaged communities around the bay. According to some estimates the death <b>toll</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> coast outside of Galveston may have been over one thousand. Bridges between Galveston and the mainland were destroyed. Communities along the shoreline declined for some time as economic growth moved inland and Houston became the dominant economic center in Southeast Texas. The region received a population boost from some Galveston refugees who relocated to the mainland following the catastrophe.|$|E
5|$|In 1941, the German night fighter intruders began {{achieving}} substantial successes. British ground defences, {{which had}} taken their <b>toll</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> German units in 1940, were now side-stepped by a decision to shift the area of operations to the North Sea, by the English coast. In June German night fighter units claimed 22 RAF aircraft; 18 over the sea. In July 19 British aircraft were claimed for four losses. By October 1941 British loss records listed 54 aircraft of all types destroyed and a further 44 damaged in these operations to all causes. German losses amounted to 27 destroyed and 31 damaged to all causes.|$|E
