5|$|Brock felt {{he needed}} to go further. He was {{hampered}} by Governor General George Prevost, who had replaced Craig in late 1811. Prevost's orders from the government, and his own inclinations, were to emphasise defence. Prevost kept {{the bulk of his}} forces in Lower Canada to protect Quebec, and opposed any attack into United States. Brock also believed that he was handicapped by inertia and defeatism among <b>the</b> <b>Legislature</b> <b>and</b> other officials.|$|E

5|$|The Legislature of Singapore {{consists}} of the President and the Parliament. The concept of representative democracy is embodied in <b>the</b> <b>Legislature</b> <b>and</b> is given effect in part through various parliamentary innovations that have been introduced over the years, such as Group Representation Constituencies, Non-constituency Members of Parliament and Nominated Members of Parliament.|$|E
5|$|The delegates {{also agreed}} with Madison that the {{executive}} function {{had to be}} independent of the legislature. In their aversion to kingly power, American legislatures had created state governments where the executive was beholden to <b>the</b> <b>legislature,</b> <b>and</b> by the late 1780s this was widely seen as being a source of paralysis. The Confederation government was the ultimate example of this.|$|E
50|$|The Government of India Act 1919 {{expanded}} the membership to <b>the</b> <b>legislatures.</b> <b>The</b> Liberals entered <b>the</b> new <b>legislatures</b> <b>and</b> {{attempted to make}} the reforms succeed so as to advance India far toward full self-government. They tried to persuade the British that Indians were a loyal opposition and well prepared for self-government, and trying also to build Indian self-respect and prove that revolutionary upheaval was unnecessary as well as dangerous. They urged for further constitutional reform, asking for an expanded Indian role in both provincial and central government. However, they had a minority position in <b>the</b> <b>legislatures</b> <b>and</b> hence were weakened.|$|R

On rare occasions a Senator resigned rather than follow instructions.|$|R

5|$|English and French are the {{official}} languages of <b>the</b> <b>legislature</b> <b>and</b> courts of Manitoba, according to §23 of the Manitoba Act, 1870 (part of the Constitution of Canada). In April 1890, the Manitoba legislature attempted to abolish {{the official}} status of French, and ceased to publish bilingual legislation. However, in 1985 the Supreme Court of Canada ruled in the Reference re Manitoba Language Rights that §23 still applied, and that legislation published only in English was invalid (unilingual legislation was declared valid for a temporary period to allow time for translation).|$|E
5|$|Following these decisions, the General Assembly {{attempted}} {{to remove all}} three justices from their positions, but lacked the two-thirds majority required for impeachment. The Assembly then {{attempted to}} abolish the Court of Appeals and create a new one, beginning the Old Court-New Court controversy. The members of the existing court – Owsley, John Boyle, and Benjamin Mills – continued functioning in that role, while a new court of four pro-relief justices was organized by the legislature. For a time, both courts {{claimed to be the}} court of last resort in Kentucky, but by 1826, supporters of the Old Court won control of <b>the</b> <b>legislature</b> <b>and</b> abolished the New Court.|$|E
5|$|Hanna, {{a wealthy}} industrialist, had {{successfully}} managed McKinley's 1896 presidential campaign. The Ohio Republican Party was bitterly {{divided between the}} faction led by McKinley, Hanna and Sherman, and one led by Ohio's other senator, Joseph B. Foraker. Bushnell was a Foraker ally, {{and it was only}} under pressure from McKinley and others that he agreed to appoint Hanna to fill Sherman's Senate seat. After Hanna gained the appointment, Republican legislators kept their majority in the November 1897 election, apparently ensuring Hanna's election once the new body met in January 1898. However, before the legislative session, the Democrats allied with a number of Republicans, mostly from the Foraker faction, hoping to take control of <b>the</b> <b>legislature</b> <b>and</b> defeat Hanna.|$|E

5|$|Madison's plan {{operated}} on several assumptions {{that were not}} seriously challenged. During the deliberations, few raised serious objections to the planned bicameral congress, nor the separate executive function, nor the separate judicial function. As English law had typically recognized government as having two separate functions, law making embodied in <b>the</b> <b>legislature,</b> <b>and</b> law executing embodied in the king and his courts, {{the division of the}} legislature from the executive and judiciary was a natural and uncontested point.|$|E
5|$|Owsley studied law under John Boyle. After briefly {{serving in}} the state legislature, he was {{appointed}} by Governor Charles Scott to serve alongside Boyle on the Kentucky Court of Appeals. During his service on the court, Owsley {{was involved in the}} Old Court-New Court controversy. In 1824, the state legislature, unhappy with the court's rulings against debt relief legislation, attempted to abolish the court {{and replace it with a}} new court. For a time, both courts operated simultaneously, and both claimed to be the court of last resort in the state. Supporters of the old court won control of <b>the</b> <b>legislature</b> <b>and</b> abolished the new court in 1826. Owsley resigned from the Court of Appeals two years later.|$|E

The judges of national courts are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Council of the Republic. For criminal cases, the highest court of appeal is the Supreme Court. The Belarusian Constitution forbids the use of special extrajudicial courts.|$|E
5|$|The midterm congressional {{elections}} of 1854 and 1855 were devastating to the Democrats (as {{well as to}} the Whig Party, which was on its last legs). The Democrats lost almost every state outside the South. The administration's opponents in the North worked together to return opposition members to Congress, though only a few northern Whigs gained election. In Pierce's New Hampshire, hitherto loyal to the Democratic Party, the Know-Nothings elected the governor, all three representatives, dominated <b>the</b> <b>legislature,</b> <b>and</b> returned John P. Hale to the Senate. Anti-immigrant fervor brought the Know-Nothings their highest numbers to that point, and some northerners were elected {{under the auspices of the}} new Republican Party.|$|E
5|$|The modern routing of NY317 was {{originally}} {{the northern part}} of the Jordan and Skaneateles Plank Road. Chartered in 1855, the Jordan and Skaneateles Plank Road Company was set to provide a plank road from Jordan southward to Skaneateles. This plank road was constructed in the 1850s in place of the Syracuse and Auburn Railroad and a small railroad from Skaneateles to Skaneateles Junction, two crude railroads that were in the area which had ended service in 1836 and 1850 respectively. On March25, 1853, the New York State Assembly proposed an additional toll gate to be constructed in Elbridge along the plank road. On June15, 1853, the bill was passed by <b>the</b> <b>Legislature</b> <b>and</b> went into effect.|$|E
