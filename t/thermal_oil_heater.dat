40|$|Due to {{the wide}} {{interest}} in organic Rankine cycles (ORCs) as a sustainable technology {{and the importance of}} numerical analyses and optimization procedures while considering such systems, we created a dedicated open-source library named “ORC modelling Kit” (ORCmKit). The comprehensive library includes single com-ponents and overall models for subcritical, transcritical and supercritical ORCs. Three main programming environments are currently supported: Matlab, Python and EES (Engineering Equation Solver). A detailed steady-state cycle model of a small-scale regenerative ORC with a single-screw expander is used to evalu-ate the performance influence of R 1234 ze(Z) as a drop-in replacement of R 245 fa currently used in the installation. The ORC system is used to recover low-grade waste heat with a temperature range between 90 °C and 120 °C. A <b>thermal</b> <b>oil</b> <b>heater</b> is used to simulate the heat source. A parametric study is carried out to in-vestigate the performance of the system throughout the range of interest in order to optimize the ORC with R 1234 ze(Z) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} a plant-wide {{assessment}} of the manufacturing facilities of Neville Chemical Company, a manufacturer of hydrocarbon resins will be presented in this paper. The project was co-funded by US Department of Energy under its Plant-Wide Opportunity Assessment Program. Resin manufacturing is a highly energy intensive process. The process needs extensive heating accomplished through steam boilers and <b>thermal</b> <b>oil</b> <b>heaters,</b> and cooling which is accomplished through refrigeration as well as process cooling water systems. Detailed energy assessment of Neville Chemical plants has shown significant energy conservation opportunities. For the less capital-intensive measures, energy cost savings of 20 % to 30 % with paybacks of {{less than two years}} were identified. The identified measures can be easily replicated in similar facilities. In this paper, details of the processes in hydrocarbon resin production from an energy consumption viewpoint will be discussed, current prevalent practices in the industry will be elaborated, and potential measures for energy use and cost savings will be outlined. ...|$|R

50|$|From {{a safety}} standpoint, {{it is best}} to avoid having any object within three feet of an <b>oil</b> <b>heater.</b> Using an <b>oil</b> <b>heater</b> to dry clothes is not {{recommended}} by any modern manufacturer. There is a substantial fire risk if flammable materials such as clothing or bedding are left near a heater, especially synthetic fabrics such as polyester, which can melt or burn. Even though the surface temperature of the heater in normal operation is quite low, the extra thermal resistance of the clothing on the heater can cause its surface temperature to rise to the material's autoignition temperature. It {{should also be noted that}} some <b>oil</b> <b>heaters</b> contain strong warnings to avoid operation in damp areas (such as bathrooms or laundry rooms) because the moisture and humidity can damage components of the heater itself.|$|R
50|$|Although <b>oil</b> <b>heaters</b> {{are more}} {{expensive}} to run and provide far less spatial heating than gas heaters, they are still commonly used in bedrooms and other small-to-medium-sized enclosed areas. This is because gas heaters, especially when unflued, are not suitable for bedroom use - gas heaters cannot be used in confined spaces due to the reduced oxygen, and the emissions produced. This leaves electrically powered <b>heaters,</b> such as <b>oil</b> <b>heaters</b> and fan heaters, as the only alternative.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to examine the {{efficiency}} of the thermal wave type adsorption refrigerating equipment working on a pair of activated carbon and methanol. Adsorption units can work in trigeneration systems and in applications driven by waste heat.

The device examined in this study operates in a special mode called thermal wave. This mode allows to achieve higher efficiency rates than the normal mode of operation, as a significant contributor to transport heat from one to the other adsorber. To carry out the experiment a test bench was built, consisting of two cylindrical adsorbers filled with activated carbon, condenser, evaporator, <b>oil</b> <b>heater</b> and two <b>oil</b> coolers. <b>Thermal</b> <b>oil</b> circulation was responsible for providing and receiving heat from adsorbers.

50|$|Several {{efficiencies}} can {{be measured}} in regards to heaters, such as the efficiency of heating a room with a given amount of power, and the efficiency of the electrical generator which powers the heater and power loss from transporting the electricity over power lines. Measures may also consider how well a heater keeps the temperature of a space above a certain point. Such a measure would find inefficiencies in heating an already warm room. Many heaters (the majority of available models) are equipped with a thermostat to prevent this inefficient heating, which in turn reduces running costs. This feature was much more common in <b>oil</b> <b>heaters</b> than in the cheaper fan heaters until recently; thus many older <b>oil</b> <b>heaters</b> will be cheaper and more efficient to run than their contemporary fan heaters that lack the thermostat.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} recent {{findings about}} the influence of oil-soaked mineral wool insulation material on the thermal heat loss of the insulated pipe. <b>Thermal</b> <b>oil</b> is a popular heat transfer fluid in high-temperature solar cooling applications using concentrating collectors, eg parabolic trough or linear Fresnel collectors. Leaks in <b>thermal</b> <b>oil</b> pipes or components thereof, eg. fittings, valves etc., result in <b>thermal</b> <b>oil</b> saturating the surrounding insulation layer. Mineral wool soaked with <b>thermal</b> <b>oil</b> has a higher heat conductivity than pure dry mineral wool. The influence of oil content on the heat loss has been investigated using a test stand with a heated section of insulated pipe. Simulated leaks have been applied and the temperature changes {{on the outside of the}} insulation have been observed. Different grades of saturation (0 %, 33 % and 50 %) have been investigated in the work presented, as well as different temperature levels (175 °C/ 347 °F and 250 °C/ 482 °F) of the <b>thermal</b> <b>oil</b> within the pipe. Thermal conductivity and heat loss are calculated and presented for these. The results show that an oil content of 33 % in mineral wool insulation increases thermal conductivity by a factor of 2. 5 to 3, compared to dry, oil-free insulation. An oil content of 50 % increases thermal conductivity by a factor of up to 3. 3. It was observed that the difference in thermal conductivity between 175 °C/ 347 °F and 250 °C/ 482 °F of bulk oil temperature inside the pipe is rather negligible, both at 33 % and 50 % oil content...|$|R
