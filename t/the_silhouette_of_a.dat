5|$|During the {{original}} era the Panthers {{did not have}} a logo, instead using stylised lettering on the front of their shirts. The club's current logo was adopted in 2003 and is the fifth to be used since the Panthers were reformed. The first was used between 1980 and 1994 and was <b>the</b> <b>silhouette</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Panthers' head in a red circle. The second logo, adopted in 1994, was similar to the first but used a more detailed Panthers' head. The third logo, introduced in 1998, featured a keyhole shaped like the head of a cat with a Panther reaching through it. The fourth logo was adopted following the move to the National Ice Centre and was similar to the logo of German side Augsburger Panther. The stylised lettering used during {{the original}} era was used again on special shirts made to mark the sixtieth anniversary of the club in 2006.|$|E
5|$|Set {{apart from}} the glowing underside, the darker, nonluminescent collar tapers at {{both sides of the}} throat, and has been {{hypothesized}} to serve as a lure by mimicking <b>the</b> <b>silhouette</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> small fish from below. The appeal of the lure would be multiplied in a school of sharks. If the collar does function in this way, the cookiecutter shark would be the only known case of bioluminescence in which the absence of light attracts prey, while its photophores serve to prevent premature detection by incoming would-be predators. As the shark can only match a limited range of light intensities, its vertical movements likely serve to preserve the effectiveness of its disguise across various times of day and weather conditions.|$|E
25|$|The {{bombs were}} painted sky-blue {{with a yellow}} stripe in the tail cone, unless filled with Trialen in which case it was {{replaced}} by <b>the</b> <b>silhouette</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sinking ship in yellow, and the warning nur gegen handelschiffe ("only against merchant ships") was stencilled on the bomb casing.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} a method is {{presented}} {{which allows the}} measurement of deflections and torsion by means <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>silhouette</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> object in images. The method {{is based on a}} finite element description <b>of</b> <b>a</b> beam. The benefit of this method is the determination of the deformation out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>silhouette</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> object in images without the need of signalization. The presented method is tested against simulated data as well as against real objects in laboratory tests. As an outlook the presented method can be further modified. By combination with a laser scanner it seems to be possible to replace the CAD model <b>of</b> <b>an</b> object with the point clouds of one or more kinematic laser scans...|$|R
50|$|The {{fact that}} the sky is not {{completely}} dark at night, {{even in the absence}} of moonlight and city lights, can be easily observed, since if the sky were absolutely dark, one would not be able to see <b>the</b> <b>silhouette</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> object against <b>the</b> sky.|$|R
25|$|In some apparitions {{an image}} is {{reported}} absent any verbal interaction. An {{example is the}} reported apparitions at Our Lady of Assiut in which many people reported a bright image atop a building. Photographs at times suggest <b>the</b> <b>silhouette</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> statue of the Virgin Mary but the images are subject to varying interpretations, and critics suggest that they may just be due to various visual effects. However, such image-like appearances are hardly ever reported for visions of Jesus and Mary. In most cases these involve some form of reported communication.|$|E
25|$|At dawn on the 17th, Forsyth sensed {{trouble and}} spotted <b>the</b> <b>silhouette</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{feathered}} {{head against the}} skyline. He fired his weapon, instantly killing the Indian warrior. Simultaneously, other Indians, who, having moved nearer to where the scouts' horses were tied up, attempted to stampede them, but the scouts immediately responded {{to the sound of}} Forsyth's gunshot and only the pack mules were lost. Roman Nose, war leader of the Cheyenne, had planned a dawn raid to overrun the camp of 50 U.S. scouts, but the element of surprise was lost when a few eager warriors rushed the camp before the order to attack was given.|$|E
25|$|The picture below {{shows the}} Shrimp device, detonated on March 1, 1954 at Bikini, as the Castle Bravo test. Its 15-megaton {{explosion}} {{was the largest}} ever by the United States. <b>The</b> <b>silhouette</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> man is shown for scale. The device is supported from below, at the ends. The pipes going into the shot cab ceiling, which appear to be supports, are actually diagnostic light pipes. The eight pipes at the right end (1) sent information about the detonation of the primary. Two in the middle (2) marked the time when x-radiation from the primary reached the radiation channel around the secondary. The last two pipes (3) noted the time radiation reached {{the far end of}} the radiation channel, the difference between (2) and (3) being the radiation transit time for the channel.|$|E
50|$|The state seal is {{displayed}} in stained {{glass in the}} ceilings of both the Wyoming's House of Representatives Chamber and the Wyoming Senate Chamber in the state capital. The seal is also incorporated into {{the design of the}} state flag, which prominently features the seal set against <b>the</b> <b>silhouette</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> American Bison.|$|R
50|$|Most governments use {{envelopes}} with an indicia indicating {{its official}} status; the United Kingdom's official mail most often shows, O.H.M.S. or On His/Her Majesty's Service, the United States uses <b>the</b> <b>silhouette</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> eagle, Ethiopia shows a hand holding a cleft {{stick with a}} letter is wedged into it, while Ireland uses a harp.|$|R
50|$|In a post-credits scene, Will and Elizabeth {{are asleep}} when their bedroom is entered by <b>the</b> <b>silhouette</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> {{apparently}} resurrected Davy Jones. Just as Jones raises his clawed arm {{to strike at}} the couple, Will awakens and assumes {{this to be a}} nightmare, oblivious to the presence of barnacles on the floor amid <b>a</b> small puddle <b>of</b> seawater.|$|R
25|$|Saul Bass {{designed}} emblematic movie posters {{that transformed}} the visuals of film advertising. Before Bass’s seminal poster for The Man with the Golden Arm (1955), movie posters {{were dominated by}} depictions of key scenes or characters from the film, often both juxtaposed with each other. Bass’s posters, however, typically developed simplified, symbolic designs that visually communicated key essential elements of the film. For example, his poster for The Man with the Golden Arm, with a jagged arm and off-kilter typography, starkly communicates the protagonist's struggle with heroin addiction. Bass's iconic Vertigo (1958) poster, with its stylized figures sucked down into the nucleus of a spiral vortex, captures the anxiety and disorientation central to the film. His poster for Anatomy of a Murder (1959), featuring <b>the</b> <b>silhouette</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> corpse jarringly dissected into seven pieces, makes both a pun on the film’s title and captures the moral ambiguities within which this court room drama is immersed.|$|E
25|$|The footage {{was shot}} by Eric Saarinen, who was on stage taking {{pictures}} of the crowd, and Baird Bryant, who climbed atop a bus. Saarinen was unaware of having caught the killing on film. This was discovered {{more than a week}} later when raw footage was screened in the New York offices of the Maysles Brothers. In the film sequence, lasting about two seconds, a two-meter (six foot) opening in the crowd appears, leaving Bredehoft in the center. Hunter enters the opening from the left. His hand rises toward the stage, and <b>the</b> <b>silhouette</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> revolver is clearly seen against Bredehoft's light-colored dress. Passaro is seen entering from the right and delivering two stabs with his knife as he parries Hunter's revolver and pushes him off-screen; the opening then closes around Bredehoft. Passaro was reported to have stabbed Hunter five times in the upper back, although only two stabs are visible in the footage. Witnesses also reported Hunter was stomped on by several Hells Angels while he was on the ground. The gun was recovered and turned over to police. Hunter's autopsy confirmed he was high on methamphetamine when he died. Passaro was arrested and tried for murder in the summer of 1971, but was acquitted after a jury viewed concert footage showing Hunter brandishing the revolver and concluded that Passaro had acted in self-defense.|$|E
500|$|In 1988 Ecclestone sold Motor Racing Developments to Alfa Romeo. The Formula One {{team did}} not compete that year, but Alfa Romeo put {{the company to}} use {{designing}} and building a prototype [...] "Procar"—a racing car with <b>the</b> <b>silhouette</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> large saloon (the Alfa Romeo 164) covering a composite racing car chassis and mid mounted race engine. This was intended for a racing series for major manufacturers to support Formula One Grands Prix, and was designated the Brabham BT57.|$|E

50|$|The flag of {{the state}} of Wyoming {{consists}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>silhouette</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> American bison. <b>The</b> red symbolizes the Native Americans and the blood of pioneers who gave their lives. The white is <b>a</b> symbol <b>of</b> purity and uprightness. The blue is the color of the skies and distant mountains. It is also <b>a</b> symbol <b>of</b> fidelity, justice and virility. The bison represents the local fauna, while the seal on it symbolizes the custom of branding livestock.|$|R
50|$|Roberto Feleo made a 1987 {{assemblage}} entitled Darna’s Fortress of Solitude, which depicted <b>the</b> red <b>silhouette</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> woman kneeling by {{an ethnic}} banig and some santo figures.|$|R
500|$|In the past, the convex {{section of}} the emblem had a blue colour (another symbol of Turin) and, furthermore, its shape was concave. The old French shield and the mural crown, also in the lower {{section of the}} emblem, had a {{considerably}} greater size {{with respect to the}} present. The two [...] "Golden Stars for Sport Excellence" [...] were located above the convex and concave section of Juventus' emblem. During the 1980s, the club emblem was <b>the</b> <b>silhouette</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> zebra, to both sides of the equide's head, the two golden stars and, above this badge, forming an arc, the club's name.|$|E
500|$|The name [...] "cookiecutter shark" [...] {{refers to}} its feeding habit of gouging round plugs, as if cut {{out with a}} cookie cutter, out of larger animals. Marks made by cookiecutter sharks have been found {{on a wide variety}} of marine mammals and fishes, as well as on submarines, undersea cables, and even human bodies. It also consumes whole smaller prey such as squid. Cookiecutter sharks have adaptations for {{hovering}} in the water column and likely rely on stealth and subterfuge to capture more active prey. Its dark collar seems to mimic <b>the</b> <b>silhouette</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> small fish, while the rest of its body blends into the downwelling light via its ventral photophores. When a would-be predator approaches the lure, the shark attaches itself using its suctorial lips and specialized pharynx and neatly excises a chunk of flesh using its bandsaw-like set of lower teeth. This species has been known to travel in schools.|$|E
500|$|On June 10, 2013 Timberlake {{introduced}} the artwork for the [...] "Tunnel Vision" [...] single, a black-and-white close-up of the singer's face in <b>the</b> <b>silhouette</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> nude woman. Kia Macarechi of The Huffington Post found the artwork unpleasant and unusual; according to Justin Myers of the Official Charts Company, Timberlake [...] "seems {{to be playing}} up to his naughty nickname of Trousersnake with the cover". Zach Dionne of New Yorks Vulture website called the cover [...] "awful boobnose single art", committing to [...] "the smoky naked woman vibe". [...] "Tunnel Vision" [...] and its radio edit were digitally released in France and Italy on June 14 on Amazon. That day, the single was also released in Australia, Belgium, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, New Zealand and Sweden on 7 Digital and the iTunes Store. It was released on June 17 in Norway, the following day in Spain and on June 21 in Switzerland.|$|E

A {{short distance from}} the main station is a memorial, including a large sculpture made by Chilean sculptor José Balcells featuring <b>the</b> <b>silhouette</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> albatross, in remembrance of the sailors who died while attempting to [...] "round the Horn". It was erected in 1992 through the initiative of the Chilean Section of the Cape Horn Captains Brotherhood.|$|R
50|$|In 1971, a {{truck driver}} Thomas (Luke Ford) arrives in Dampier, Western Australia late one night, having transported a {{previously}} ordered statue of William Dampier to the town. Upon entering the town pub he sees <b>the</b> <b>silhouettes</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> group <b>of</b> men, {{one of whom is}} holding a gun. Believing it is a murder, he rushes into the next room, where he sees that the men are trying to put down an apparently sick dog (played by Koko). Unable to bring themselves to carry out the euthanasia, the men, with Thomas, retreat to the bar.|$|R
2500|$|White Whale Records was an American {{record company}} that {{operated}} between 1965 and 1971 in Los Angeles, California, {{it was the}} record company of The Turtles.

2500|$|The PPD {{used as a}} logo <b>the</b> <b>silhouette</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> rural farm worker, jibaro, {{wearing a}} straw hat, with the words [...] "pan, tierra, libertad" [...] (bread, land, freedom). The party logo was {{designed}} by Antonio Colorado, Sr., one of Muñoz's party staff members and an eventual cabinet member. [...] In 2016, the logo was updated to include a woman and the words [...] "pan, tierra, libertad' were substituted with [...] "unidad, trabajo, prosperidad" [...] ("unity, work, prosperity") ...|$|E
2500|$|The logo depicts both {{a forest}} {{landscape}} and <b>the</b> <b>silhouette</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> wild animal. The [...] "eye" [...] of the [...] "Wild Animal" [...] is the north star, {{in tribute to}} the departed Minnesota North Stars {{as well as the}} states motto L'Étoile du Nord, meaning [...] "The Star of the North". The questions surrounding the identity of the animal depicted has sparked debate amongst logo enthusiasts, earning it recognition {{as one of the best}} logos in sports according to The Good Point.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Tracking {{people using}} movie {{sequences}} is not straightforward {{because of the}} human body's articulation and the complexity <b>of</b> <b>a</b> person's movements. In this paper we show how a person's 3 D pose can be reconstructed by using corresponding <b>silhouettes</b> <b>of</b> video sequences from a monocular view. Currently, a virtual avatar is used to train the model for inferring the pose and a di erent avatar is used to produce novel examples not in the training set in order to evaluate the approach. The approach was subsequently tested using <b>the</b> <b>silhouettes</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> walking person. 1...|$|R

2500|$|Webb began researching [...] "Dark Alliance" [...] in July 1995. The {{series was}} {{published}} in The Mercury News in three parts, from August 18–20, 1996, with one long article {{and one or two}} shorter articles appearing each day. It was also posted on The Mercury News website with additional information, including documents cited in the series and audio recordings of people quoted in the articles. The website artwork showed <b>the</b> <b>silhouette</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> man smoking a crack pipe superimposed over the CIA seal.

2500|$|The {{aerodynamic}} {{properties of}} light bars can {{be important for}} police applications, as fuel efficiency and drag are concerns in patrol and pursuit. [...] Because of this, some police cars do not have roof mounted lightbars. These ‘slick-top’ cars mount their emergency lights within the cruiser, generally around {{the periphery of the}} windshield or into the leading or trailing edge of the roof. [...] Slick-top police cars also lack <b>the</b> <b>silhouette</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> lightbar or beacon, making the car harder to identify as a police vehicle from a distance, especially fore and aft. [...] Because of these visual advantages, these vehicles are sometimes referred to as ‘stealth’ vehicles.|$|E

50|$|The term {{night sky}} {{refers to the}} sky as seen at night. The term is usually {{associated}} with skygazing and astronomy, with reference to views of celestial bodies such as stars, the Moon, and planets that become visible on a clear night after the Sun has set. Natural light sources in a night sky include moonlight, starlight, and airglow, depending on location and timing. The fact that the sky is not completely dark at night can be easily observed.
