40|$|This paper {{reports on}} {{observational}} approaches developed within a UK study to {{the identification and}} assessment of metacognition and self-regulation in young children in the 3 – 5 year age range. It is argued that <b>the</b> development of <b>observational</b> <b>tools,</b> although containing methodological difficulties, allows us to make more valid assessments of children’s metacognitive and self-regulatory abilities in this age group. The analysis of 582 metacognitive or self-regulatory videotaped ‘events’ is described, including {{the development of a}} coding framework identifying verbal and non-verbal indicators. The construction of an <b>observational</b> instrument, <b>the</b> Children’s Independent Learning Development (CHILD 3 – 5) checklist, is also reported together with evidence of the reliability with which it can be used by classroom teachers and early indications of its external validity as a measure of metacognition and self-regulation in young children. Given the educational significance of children’s development of metacognitive and self-regulatory skills, it is argued that the development of such an instrument is potentially highly beneficial. The establishment of the metacognitive and self-regulatory capabilities of young children by means of <b>the</b> kinds of <b>observational</b> <b>tools</b> <b>developed</b> within this study also has clear and significant implications for models and theories of metacognition and self-regulation.

30|$|The {{quality of}} the results and whether policy makers take them into account also depend on the {{validity}} and reliability of the measures used. As Anders and colleagues (2016) describe, {{it is a great}} challenge to measure the development of very young children since existing measures only cover some domains and often are designed for younger children or other cultural contexts. The researchers point out that the employed battery of validated sub-scales initially developed to assess pedagogical processes in the US context were not fully able to capture the special nature of interactions that occur when the pedagogical approach of embedded language education is applied. Yet, the urgent need for timely results did not allow the researchers to pilot and validate <b>the</b> adapted <b>observational</b> <b>tool</b> for <b>the</b> German ECEC context. According to Anders and colleagues (2016), it therefore remains an open question whether rather low correlations between two measurement points (ranging between 0.11 and 0.18) show that the language-related quality in the observed settings tends to be very unpredictable or that relevant aspects of the pedagogical approach might not have been adequately captured by <b>the</b> <b>observational</b> <b>tool,</b> implying that <b>the</b> tool might need to be improved. Therefore, besides aiming at the alignment of research questions and current policy needs, room for innovative explorations is essential. ‘Knowledge gaps’ are not always evident from the start but emerge in the process of researching. Thus, on the one hand, there is a strong need for innovative measures and on the other hand, developing new instruments requires careful checking for validity and reliability in elaborate and costly pilot and validation studies.|$|R
30|$|For example, {{when the}} {{evaluation}} {{study of the}} programme “core daycare centres” was designed, no validated measure to capture the process quality of the specific pedagogical approach of early language education embedded into daily preschool routines existed. As has been described above, the evaluation team chose to {{use a combination of}} subscales of validated instruments that tapped relevant aspects, but which were also not specifically designed to assess the quality of language education embedded into daily routines. Although the observations of language-related preschool quality generated important and fruitful information, not all relevant characteristics of the specific pedagogical approach were tapped. We also experienced a surprisingly low stability of the process observations {{over the course of the}} study. The correlations between two measurement points ranged between 0.11 and 0.18 for different scales.

Lee, Grigg, and Donahue (2007) found that approximately two-thirds of both eighth- and twelfth-graders read below proficiency and lack the reading skills needed to succeed in school. With the national movement towards a Response to Intervention (RTI) context of identifying and intervening with struggling learners, the Tier I general education classroom is {{the first line of}} defense in preventing and intervening with literacy difficulties. Proponents of RTI believe that comprehensive and coordinated instruction that is implemented with fidelity can improve outcomes for all students. However, fidelity has not been clearly defined in the literature, and has historically received less attention in the K- 12 education literature (Ruiz-Primo, 2005; Summerfelt, 2003).

40|$|Objective: To {{develop a}} brief {{standardised}} observational schedule for Reactive Attachment Disorder (RAD) in school-age children to aid clinician recognition of these behaviours. Design: A new structured observational schedule for symptoms of RAD was developed using unstructured observation {{of children in}} a clinic waiting room setting. The measure's ability to discriminate between a sample of children with RAD and a normative sample was established by comparing scores in these two groups. Method: Children aged 5 - 8 years (n = 77 [38 RAD cases and 39 controls]) were observed with their primary caregiver in a standardised waiting room setting. A structured <b>observational</b> <b>tool</b> was <b>developed</b> that tested the reliability, sensitivity and specificity of each item. Results: The schedule has good internal consistency (0. 75).

40|$|AbstractThe {{variations}} in glaciers are the important indicators of regional climate change. The glaciers {{play an important}} role in the regulation of water balance. In the conditions of global warming they recede and degrade that is expressed in the related changes in glacier runoff. The research of glacier melting is important for studies of sea/ocean level changes. The Caucasian glacial dimensions (area, volume, length) have been changed over the centuries. The scientific study of glaciers in the Caucasus was started during the first half of 18 th century. In the last century the terrestrial observations on glaciers were carried out. Due to the difficulties of organization and conducting of field works <b>the</b> received <b>observational</b> data sets consists from different series of various temporal duration characteristics of glaciers. The data received contain uncertainties. From another hand carrying out of such field works are expensive. With the launch of the Earth’s satellites it was determined that satellite remote sensing is the best technology allowing to receive data with needed regularity in terms of both time and space resolution. Some uncertainties remain in the data as <b>the</b> <b>observational</b> <b>tool</b> is too far away from the Earth’s surface. So, the necessity for the strong quality assessment/quality control (QA/QC) remains.

40|$|Several {{studies suggest}} that pragmatic skills (PS) (i. e. social communication) deficits {{may be linked to}} {{executive}} dysfunction (i. e. cognitive processes required for the regulation of new and complex behaviors) in patients with frontal brain injuries. If impairment of executive functions (EF) causes PS deficits in otherwise healthy adults, could this mean that EF are necessary for the normal functioning of PS, even more so than cognitive maturation? If so, children with highly developed EF should exhibit higher levels of PS. This study aimed to examine the link between EF and PS among normally developing children. A secondary goal was to compare this relationship to that between intellectual quotient (IQ) and PS in order to determine which predictor explained the most variance. Participants were 70 French-speaking preschool children (3; 10 to 5; 7 years old). The PS coding system, an <b>observational</b> <b>tool</b> <b>developed</b> for this study, was used to codify the children’s PS during a semi-structured conversation with a research assistant. Five types of EF processes were evaluated: self-control, inhibition, flexibility, working memory and planning. IQ was estimated by tallying the scores on a receptive vocabulary test and a visuoconstructive abilities test. The results of the test of differences between correlation coefficients suggest that EF contributed significantly more than IQ to the PS exhibited by preschoolers during conversation. More specifically, higher inhibition skills were correlated with a decrease in talkativeness and assertiveness. EF also appeared to foster quality of speech by promoting the ability to produce fluid utterances, free of unnecessary repetition or hesitation. Moreover, children with a high working memory capacity were more likely to formulate contingent answers and produce utterances that could be clearly understood by the interlocutor.

40|$|Abstract Background In young {{children}} with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T 1 DM) parents have full responsibility for the diabetes-management of their child (e. g. blood glucose monitoring, and administering insulin). Behavioral tasks in childhood, such as developing autonomy, and oppositional behavior (e. g. refusing food) may interfere with the diabetes-management to achieve an optimal blood glucose control. Furthermore, higher blood glucose levels are related to more behavioral problems. So parents might need to negotiate with their child on the diabetes-management to avoid this direct negative effect. This interference, the negotiations, and the parent's responsibility for diabetes may negatively {{affect the quality of}} parent-child interaction. Nevertheless, there is little knowledge about the quality of interaction between parents and {{young children}} with T 1 DM, and the possible impact this may have on glycemic control and psychosocial functioning of the child. While widely used global parent-child interaction observational methods are available, {{there is a need for}} an <b>observational</b> <b>tool</b> specifically tailored to the interaction patterns of parents and children with T 1 DM. The main aim of this study is to construct a disease-specific observational method to assess diabetes-specific parent-child interaction. Additional aim is to explore whether the quality of parent-child interactions is associated with the glycemic control, and psychosocial functioning (resilience, behavioral problems, and quality of life). Methods/Design First, we will examine which situations are most suitable for observing diabetes-specific interactions. Then, these situations will be video-taped in a pilot study (N = 15). Observed behaviors are described into rating scales, with each scale describing characteristics of parent-child interactional behaviors. Next, we apply <b>the</b> <b>observational</b> <b>tool</b> on a larger scale for further evaluation of the instrument (N = 120). The parents are asked twice (with two years in between) to fill out questionnaires about psychosocial functioning of their child with T 1 DM. Furthermore, glycemic control (HbA 1 c) will be obtained from their medical records. Discussion A disease-specific <b>observational</b> <b>tool</b> will enable <b>the</b> detailed assessment of the quality of diabetes-specific parent-child interactions. The availability of such a tool will facilitate future (intervention) studies that will yield more knowledge about impact of parent-child interactions on psychosocial functioning, and glycemic control of children with T 1 DM. </p...|$|R

Welding in shipyards can be particularly hazardous due dynamic conditions and work in enclosed and confined spaces.

Using an <b>observational</b> <b>tool</b> based on those guidelines, a baseline characterization of the work practices and use of ventilation in enclosed and confined space welding tasks was performed at a Seattle shipyard. To assess ventilation effectiveness, a scoring system was developed to compare actual and recommended ventilation practices.

On the other hand, a large number of specific applications of close-up imaging to study the giant planets are suggested by experience in photography from Earth and Mars orbit, and by ground-based telescopic studies of Jupiter and Saturn. The satellites of the outer planets actually constitute three distinct classes: lunar-sized objects, asteroidal-sized objects, and particulate rings. Imaging promises to be <b>the</b> primary <b>observational</b> <b>tool</b> for each category with results that could impact scientific thinking in the late 70 's and 80 's as significantly as has close-up photography of Mars and the Moon in the last 10 yr...|$|R
40|$|Sitting at {{work for}} a long time in the office can cause {{musculoskeletal}} disorders (MSDs). Sustaining any static posture, such as sitting can affect the human body in terms of increasing pressure on the muscles, ligaments and other soft tissues of the musculoskeletal system. This research clarifies the development of a new assessment tool for ergonomic office chair evaluation checklist to investigate the risk factor of office workers at the office. The purpose of this study is to propose and develop an ergonomic assessment tool capable of quantifying subjective occupant sitting discomfort during office work and to evaluate the proposed ergonomic assessment tool in terms of validity test and reliability test. The initial development of the new tool involved the following procedures. Firstly, the new assessment <b>tool</b> was <b>developed</b> based on literature review. This is followed by the identification of office chair parameters, questionnaire design, grand score and action level development and the development of <b>the</b> <b>observational</b> <b>tool</b> office ergonomic chair assessment (OFFECA) prototype. Secondly, the psychometric properties were evaluated by administering the questionnaire to 50 office workers in ten offices around UTHM. The reliability of the observation was assessed through internal consistency. Construct validity was analyzed by content validity, which is by obtaining the opinion of expert judges in the ergonomic field. Concurrent validity was also used in this prototype to find out the relationship between existing tools and the new assessment tool. Reliability was determined based on the internal consistency of the prototype verified using Cronbach’s alpha that is 0. 832 and the range Cronbach’s alpha values was 0. 814 to 0. 839. The construct validity analysis using Pearson’s Correlation shows correlations are significant at (p< 0. 01) and (p< 0. 05) between the existing tools and the prototype of the office ergonomic chair assessment. To conclude, results indicated that the new assessment tool had good psychometric properties for use in studies involving office workers...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} the cosmological evolution predicted by three distinct f(R) theories, {{with emphasis on}} the evolution of linear perturbations. <b>The</b> most promising <b>observational</b> <b>tools</b> for distinguishing f(R) theories from ΛCDM are those intrinsically related to the growth of structure, such as weak lensing. At the linear level, the enhancement in the gravitational potential provided by the additional f(R) `fifth force' can separate the theories, whereas at the background level they can be indistinguishable. Under the stringent constraints imposed on the models by Solar System tests and galaxy-formation criteria, we show that the relative difference between the models' linear evolution of the lensing potential will be extremely hard to detect even with future space-based experiments such as Euclid, with a maximum value of approximately 4...|$|R
40|$|Background/Objective: In a {{previous}} study, the Child Behavior Rating Scales (CBRSs) {{were found to}} assess interpersonal social skills (IPS) and learning-related social skills (LRSS) in young Singaporean children. This study aimed to evaluate the convergent validity of the IPS scale within the CBRS and the discriminant validity of the LRSS scale within the CBRS with a dynamic occupational therapist assessment, the Evaluation of Social Interaction (ESI). Methods: Teachers of 117 Singaporean children completed the CBRS. An occupational therapist assessed these children using <b>the</b> naturalistic <b>observational</b> <b>tool</b> ESI. <b>The</b> Rasch-derived scores from the two CBRS scales were correlated with the ESI scores. Results: The IPS scale within the CBRS demonstrated moderate correlation with ESI, indicating convergent validity. The LRSS scale within the CBRS demonstrated low correlation with ESI, indicating discriminant validity. Conclusion: This study provides additional validity evidence for the two newly identified CBRS scales. Results {{of this study suggest}} the potential of these scales for use by occupational therapists to measure different types of young children 2 ̆ 7 s social skills. Copyrigh...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{addresses the}} 45 th Weather Squadron's (45 WS) need for improved guidance regarding lightning cessation at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station and Kennedy Space Center (KSC). KSC's Lightning Detection and Ranging (LDAR) network was <b>the</b> primary <b>observational</b> <b>tool</b> to investigate both cloud-to-ground and intracloud lightning. Five statistical and empirical schemes were created from LDAR, sounding, and radar parameters derived from 116 storms. Four {{of the five}} schemes were unsuitable for operational use since lightning advisories would be canceled prematurely, leading to safety risks to personnel. These include a correlation and regression tree analysis, three variants of multiple linear regression, event time trending, and the time delay between the greatest height of the maximum dBZ value to the last flash. These schemes failed to adequately forecast the maximum interval, the greatest time between any two flashes in the storm. The majority of storms had a maximum interval less than 10 min, which biased the schemes toward small values. Success was achieved with the percentile method (PM) by separating the maximum interval into percentiles for the 100 dependent storms...|$|R

40|$|National Science Foundation. – 2 – Supernovae are {{essential}} to understanding the chemical evolution of the Universe. Type Ia supernovae also provide <b>the</b> most powerful <b>observational</b> <b>tool</b> currently available for studying the expansion history of the Universe {{and the nature of}} dark energy. Our basic knowledge of supernovae comes from the study of their photometric and spectroscopic properties. However, the presently available data sets of optical and near-infrared light curves of supernovae are rather small and/or heterogeneous, and employ photometric systems that are poorly characterized. Similarly, there are relatively few supernovae whose spectral evolution has been well sampled, both in wavelength and phase, with precise spectrophotometric observations. The low-redshift portion of the Carnegie Supernova Project (CSP) seeks to remedy this situation by providing photometry and spectrophotometry of a large sample of supernovae taken on telescope/filter/detector systems tha...|$|R

Space-based photometry has recently enabled the systematic detection of oscillations in exoplanet host stars, allowing {{a combination of}} asteroseismology with transit and radial-velocity measurements to characterize planetary systems. In this contribution I will review the key synergies between asteroseismology and exoplanet science such as the precise determination of radii and ages of exoplanet host stars, as well as applications of asteroseismology to measure spin-orbit inclinations in multiplanet systems and orbital eccentricities of small planets. Finally I will give a brief outlook on asteroseismic studies of exoplanet hosts with current and future space-based missions such as K 2 and TESS. Comment: 8 pages, 5 figures.
