The fossils at Punta Alta included a pachyderm tooth which was thought probably came from Macrauchenia.|$|E

500|$|Ruse concludes his {{detailed}} analysis of the idea of Progress, meaning a progressionist philosophy, in evolutionary biology by stating that evolutionary <b>thought</b> <b>came</b> out of that philosophy. Before Darwin, Ruse argues, evolution was just a pseudoscience; Darwin made it respectable, but [...] "only as popular science". [...] "There it remained frozen, for nearly another hundred years", until mathematicians such as Fisher provided [...] "both models and status", enabling evolutionary biologists to construct the modern synthesis of the 1930s and 1940s. That made biology a professional science, at the price of ejecting the notion of progress. That, Ruse argues, was a significant cost to [...] "people [...] still firmly committed to Progress" [...] as a philosophy.|$|E
500|$|Donop, who despised Rall, was {{reluctant}} to give command of Trenton to him. Rall {{was known to be}} loud and unacquainted with the English language, but he was also a 36-year soldier {{with a great deal of}} battle experience. His request for reinforcements had been turned down by British commander General James Grant, who disdained the American rebels and thought them poor soldiers. [...] Despite Rall's experience, the Hessians at Trenton did not admire their commander. They believed that he was too nice, and not ruthless enough to be successful. His officers complained, [...] "His love of life was too great, a <b>thought</b> <b>came</b> to him, then another, so he could not settle on a firm decision..." [...] Rall avoided hard work and had little concern for his troops' comfort.|$|E

2500|$|Raised as a Baptist, Stassen {{was active}} with {{regional}} Baptist associations {{as well as}} many other religious organizations. [...] During the 1960s, he gained a reputation as a liberal, particularly when, as president of the American Baptist Convention in 1963, he joined Martin Luther King in his march on Washington, D.C. Much of Stassen's political <b>thought</b> <b>came</b> from his religious beliefs. He held important positions in his denomination and in local and national councils of churches. [...] In the latter 1960s and early 1970s, Stassen also participated with the U.S. Inter-religious Committee on Peace, which sponsored a series of conferences on religion and peace. [...] Baptists writing memorials remembered him as much as a church figure as a political candidate. [...] His son Glen Stassen was a prominent Baptist theologian.|$|E

It was while speaking to a West Indian Negro who was a passenger with me from Southampton, who was returning home to the East Indies from Basutoland with his Basuto wife, I further learned of the horrors of native life in Africa. He related to me in conversation such horrible and pitiable tales that my heart bled within me. Retiring from the conversation to my cabin, all day and the following night I pondered over the subject matter of that conversation, and at midnight, lying flat on my back, the vision and <b>thought</b> <b>came</b> to me that I should name the organization the Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities (Imperial) League.

2500|$|The Maoist {{vision of}} modernity never [...] "enjoyed entire hegemony" [...] within the Party, {{and was always}} contested even {{at the height of}} Mao's power. Zhou Enlai's {{launching}} of the Four Modernizations in 1965 (and again 1975) are an example of this. When Mao died, the Four Modernizations replaced class struggle as the Party's key objective. This vision eventually led to the enfranchisement of the private market economy and the establishment of new institutions, and became Deng Xiaoping's [...] "socialism with Chinese characteristics". This in turn led to the adoption of alternative visions of modernity popular in the Western world. Ideological change led to factional strife, with many leading members of the party calling for a return to the classical socialist model of development. From the outside world these changes may seem odd: a society which looks more capitalist by the day is still ruled by a Party that claims [...] "fidelity to socialism". However, there is [...] "less understanding of how this looks from within". A break with the basic tenets of Maoist <b>thought</b> <b>came</b> in the 1990s, when Jiang Zemin talked of the need to let private entrepreneurs join the Party. This decision had a stronger connection to realpolitik then to ideological conviction. By the 16th National Congress, the private sector {{was one of the most}} dominant forces in society, a constituency the party could not ignore if it wished to hold on to power.|$|E

2500|$|On April 2, 2010, Badu {{was charged}} with disorderly conduct for her public nudity, a class C {{misdemeanor}} indicating a $500 fine, when a witness came forward. According to Dallas Deputy Police Chief Mike Genovesi, the witness [...] "had two small children with her and was offended". In an interview for the Dallas Morning News, Badu said that her part in the video foreshadowed the controversy and reaction to the video, stating [...] "I knew that would happen, {{so as soon as}} the <b>thought</b> <b>came</b> to my mind, I decided to assassinate myself as a gesture. Because {{it was going to happen}} anyway. The video is a prediction of what is happening now". In an April 3, 2010 interview on The Wanda Sykes Show, she explained in response to critics of the video that she did not intend to disrespect the memory of John F. Kennedy with its allusion to his assassination, stating [...] "My point was grossly misunderstood all over America. JFK is one of my heroes, one of the nation's heroes. John F. Kennedy was a revolutionary; he was not afraid to butt heads with America, and I was not afraid to show America my butt-naked truth." [...] On April 28, 2010, Badu challenged the disorderly conduct charge by pleading not guilty rather than paying the fee by mail. On August 13, she paid the $500 fine and agreed to serve six months probation through February 11, 2011.|$|E
2500|$|There {{was only}} time for two overs before stumps and Brian Statham made the ball lift outside the off-stump, {{which might have}} {{produced}} a wicket given another quarter of an hour, but Colin McDonald and Jim Burke survived the day on 8/0. The first day had produced only 142 runs and although the Saturday was bright and clear and good for batting, only 148 runs were made as an excellent England bowling attack regained the initiative and the Australian batsmen eked out the runs. Burke edged a catch to gully, but Trevor Bailey was too deep to catch it and after a slow start—and much to everybody's surprise—he peeled off a couple of cover-drives off Peter Loader. Loader was repeatedly no-balled {{and was replaced by}} Bailey and the openers took their partnership past fifty when the sightsreen was laboriously moved and Loader returned round the wicket to have Burke caught behind for 20. The teams went off for lunch at the fall of the wicket and returned on 55/1 with Neil Harvey coming in instead of Ken Mackay as announced by the scoreboard, indicating that Benaud wanted the runs to flow. Bailey had McDonald caught in slip for 42 in two hours and Norm O'Neill (who had not broken his finger as first <b>thought)</b> <b>came</b> in with the hopes of Australia hanging on his shoulders. May set a defensive field to limit his runmaking, but he hit his first ball for four before the runs dried up and he was outpaced by [...] "Slasher" [...] Mackay. Loader (4/56 with 19 no balls) caught Harvey l.b.w. after he had spent an hour making 14. Bailey (3/35) accounted for the out of form Peter Burge and had O'Neill was caught by a spectacular diving catch by Tom Graveney for 34 in 151 minutes, Jim Laker (2/15) had Mackay (16) caught behind, much to his displeasure and Australia ended the day on 156/6, 22 runs ahead. After the rest day Australia did not long survive the fall of Benaud (16) on the Monday morning, l.b.w. to Loader and the tail collapsed to 186 all out despite the best efforts of Alan Davidson (25), last man out to Laker.|$|E
