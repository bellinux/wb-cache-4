Typically a potential customer just {{walked into the}} main office in Helsinki or factory in Hämeenlinna and described what kind of vehicle he wanted. The enthusiastic engineers listened carefully to every individual customer's wishes and designed vehicles accordingly, with two or <b>three</b> <b>axles,</b> desired layout, wheelbase and with conventional or forward control cabin. Many vehicle types were only produced {{for one or two}} units. The volume model, however, was a nine-tonne variant of the VAK series.|$|E
25|$|Four-by-four (4×4) {{refers to}} the general class of vehicles. The first figure {{represents}} the total wheels (more precisely, axle ends), and the second, the number that are powered. Syntactically, 4×2 means a four-wheel vehicle that transmits engine torque to only two axle-ends: the front two in front-wheel drive or the rear two in rear-wheel drive. Alternatively, a 6×4 vehicle has <b>three</b> <b>axles,</b> two of which provide torque to two wheel ends each.|$|E

25|$|Having {{decided to}} use trolley buses on the North Beach route, six chassis were ordered from English Electric through local agent Cory-Wright and Salmon in February 1930. Boon and Company won the {{contract}} to build the bodies for the six vehicles at £719 each. As with the body they had constructed for the Walker electric bus, their design for the trolley buses was influenced by their experience as tram builders, giving the vehicles a rather utilitarian appearance. They were the first vehicles in the Board's fleet to have <b>three</b> <b>axles.</b>|$|E
25|$|As {{the bridge}} and its {{approaches}} have only one lane in each direction, traffic backups and delays often occurred in more recent years. The Jordan Bridge was the oldest drawbridge in Virginia. Formerly operated by the City of Chesapeake's Department of Public Works, it had a restricted weight limit of 3 tons. Daily toll revenue was approximately $5,000. The toll (collected on the Chesapeake side) for both direction was 50 cents for motorcycles, 75 cents for two axle vehicles, $1.00 for <b>three</b> <b>axles</b> and $1.25 for four axles. There were no facilities for electronic toll collection.|$|E

2500|$|Twelve [...] GEA-627-A1 {{traction}} motors drove the GG1's [...] diameter driving wheels on six axles using a quill drive. Four unpowered leading/trailing wheels were mounted on {{each end of}} the locomotive. The {{traction motors}} were six-pole, 400 volts, 25Hz rated at , with the 12 motors mounted in pairs over each of the six driving axles. Each motor was geared to what is called a [...] "quill," [...] a shroud around the axle itself, and the quill was connected to the drivers by means of a spring and cup arrangement. The motors were mounted on each frame which provided a flexible suspension system to provide full and equal traction for each of the drivers regardless of track condition.
