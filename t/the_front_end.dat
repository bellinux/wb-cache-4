5|$|Deinosuchus had a {{secondary}} bony palate, {{which would have}} permitted it to breathe through its nostrils {{while the rest of}} the head remained submerged underwater. The vertebrae were articulated in a procoelous manner, meaning they had a concave hollow on <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>end</b> and a convex bulge on the rear; these would have fit together to produce a ball and socket joint. The secondary palate and procoelous vertebrae are advanced features also found in modern eusuchian crocodilians.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of a front suspension, {{especially}} telescoping fork tubes, the increase in downward force on the front wheel during braking may cause the suspension to compress and <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>end</b> to lower. This is known as brake diving. A riding technique that takes advantage of how braking increases the downward force on the front wheel is known as trail braking.|$|E
5|$|Of course, {{the angle}} of the terrain can {{influence}} all of the calculations above.

5|$|One {{specimen}} {{discovered at}} the Cifelli #2 quarry, a right dentary catalogued as CEUM 34447, is unusual {{compared to other}} Eolambia specimens, including both adults and juveniles. While the ratio between the mid-point depth and overall length of the dentaries in other individuals generally ranges from 0.19 to 0.24, the same value in CEUM 34447 is 0.31, making it unusually deep. The dentary also does not deepen substantially at <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>end,</b> and thus lacks one of the distinguishing traits of Eolambia dentaries. However, the other distinguishing trait, which is the expansion of <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>end</b> of the coronoid process, {{is present in the}} specimen. Although it is possible that this individual represents an unusual Eolambia specimen, McDonald and colleagues cautioned that it may represent a distinct hadrosauroid that differs in the morphology of the dentary from Eolambia (albeit one that is not suggested by any of the other materials at the quarry). Thus, they regarded it as an indeterminate basal hadrosauroid.|$|E

5|$|All {{vertebrate}} brains share {{a common}} underlying form, which appears most clearly during early stages of embryonic development. In its earliest form, the brain appears as three swellings at <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>end</b> of the neural tube; these swellings eventually become the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain (the prosencephalon, mesencephalon, and rhombencephalon, respectively). At the earliest stages of brain development, the three areas are roughly equal in size. In many classes of vertebrates, such as fish and amphibians, the three parts remain similar in size in the adult, but in mammals the forebrain becomes {{much larger than the}} other parts, and the midbrain becomes very small.|$|E

40|$|This is a {{study on}} the {{importance}} of including sustainability at <b>the</b> fuzzy <b>front</b> <b>end</b> (FFE) stage in new product development process. Sustainable design is a design philosophy that seeks to minimize or eliminate negative impact to the natural environment through skillful and sensitive design. The importance of including sustainability at <b>the</b> fuzzy <b>front</b> <b>end</b> includes but is not limited to early tackling of barriers, enabling doing the right things versus doing things right and providing a platform to tackle sustainability problems at a higher system level. This study also analyzed tools for implementing sustainability at <b>the</b> fuzzy <b>front</b> <b>end.</b> They include, decision matrix, Eco compass, strategy list, cost analysis, creativity techniques, rules of thumb, expert rules etc. A survey was carried out to understand how organizations’ perceive sustainability; if these organizations include sustainability in their new product development process and most importantly if this implementation is done at <b>the</b> fuzzy <b>front</b> <b>end.</b> <b>The</b> survey results suggests that organizations are {{aware of the importance of}} including sustainability in the new product development process; however, implementing sustainability at <b>the</b> fuzzy <b>front</b> <b>end</b> is moderate.

5|$|Bus chassis {{production}} {{began in}} 1950. VAT {{made the first}} prototypes of rear-engined buses in 1956. The company made two prototype chassis, which were designated model VAT-4800; the superstructures were made by coach builders Ajokki Oy and Nummela Oy. The solution caused several technical problems, including proper cooling and transfer of heating to <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>end</b> of the body. The cooling problem was finally solved by a large air scoop located {{at the back of}} the roof; this was not regarded as an aesthetically pleasing arrangement. As the solution was found, VAT produced ten more rear-engined chassis called type VAT-5200.|$|E
5|$|Each train {{runs with}} a three-person crew: two {{operators}} control the train {{from the cab}} at <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>end</b> of the train and handle related operations, while a third crew member is the Customer Service Ambassador.

5|$|Wobble, shimmy, tank-slapper, speed wobble, {{and death}} wobble are all {{words and phrases}} used to {{describe}} a rapid (410Hz) oscillation of primarily just <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>end</b> (front wheel, fork, and handlebars). Also involved is the yawing of the rear frame which {{may contribute to the}} wobble when too flexible. This instability occurs mostly at high speed and is similar to that experienced by shopping cart wheels, airplane landing gear, and automobile front wheels. While wobble or shimmy can be easily remedied by adjusting speed, position, or grip on the handlebar, it can be fatal if left uncontrolled.|$|E

5|$|As {{with the}} premaxilla, the predentary of Eolambia bore denticles. There is a {{prominent}} dorsomedial process, a tab-like structure also seen in Probactrosaurus and other hadrosauriforms. Several additional tab-like denticles were present {{on either side}} of the dorsomedial process, which are likewise present in Probactrosaurus. The predentary is joined at the back by the dentary, which constitutes most of the lower jaw. There is a short recess, or diastema, between the articulation of the predentary with the dentary and the first tooth position on the dentary, which is observed in Equijubus, Probactrosaurus, and other hadrosauroids. The front of the dentary characteristically deepens, as in Protohadros, Ouranosaurus, and Bactrosaurus. Two bulges are present on the outer surface of the dentary, one of them representing the coronoid process as in Probactrosaurus and other hadrosauroids. Like Protohadros and several other hadrosauriforms but unlike Probactrosaurus, only <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>end</b> of this process is thickened. As in Equijubus, Probactrosaurus, and various other iguanodonts, a small foramen (or opening) is present on the side of the surangular, which is located behind the dentary.|$|E
5|$|In {{his sophomore}} season, Moore played 34games, {{starting}} five, and averaged 7.6points and 3.0rebounds per game. In the November17 game against Georgetown, with Temple maintaining a one point lead with 23seconds left, Moore missed <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>end</b> of a one-and-one foul shot. Afterwards, Greg Monroe of Georgetown hit a layup {{to give the}} Hoyas a 46–45 victory. The following game against Siena, Moore was at the foul line with a one-point lead and, with 22seconds left, hit both free throws to hand Temple a 73–69 victory. He increased his scoring average to 9.8points per game in conference play, receiving more minutes due to a head injury to teammate Juan Fernandez. On February20,2010, he scored a season-high 24points in an overtime victory over city rival Saint Joseph's, and made a critical fullcourt layup with 1.5seconds left to send the game into overtime. Moore helped Temple to a 29–5 record and a third consecutive Atlantic 10 conference tournament title and an automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament. He was named Atlantic 10 Sixth Man of the Year.|$|E
5|$|In the {{original}} description of Dinocephalosaurus, Li recognized the postorbital {{region and the}} elongated cervical centra as being indicative of {{a close relationship with}} Tanystropheus, which led him to assign it to the Tanystropheidae. However, Rieppel and colleagues subsequently noted characteristics that distinguished Dinocephalosaurus from derived protorosaurs such as Tanystropheus, Macrocnemus, Langobardisaurus, and Tanytrachelos; these include the lack of tapering at <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>end</b> of the nasal and an unreduced contribution of the ilium to the acetabulum. This led Rieppel and colleagues to consider Dinocephalosaurus as an indeterminate protorosaur, with its neck elongation been convergent upon that of Tanystropheus.
