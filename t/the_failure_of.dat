5|$|One of Lem's major {{recurring}} themes, beginning {{from his}} very first novel, The Man from Mars, was the impossibility of communication between profoundly alien beings, which may have no common ground with human intelligence, and humans. The best known example is the living planetary ocean in Lem's novel Solaris. Other examples include swarms of mechanical insects (in The Invincible), and strangely ordered societies of more human-like beings in Fiasco and Eden, describing <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> the first contact. In His Master's Voice, Lem describes <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> humanity's intelligence to decipher and truly comprehend an apparent message from space.|$|E
40|$|For years, {{scholars}} {{have focused on}} the serious narrative of Samuel Johnson’s Rasselas and have been unable to reconcile the episodes of ironic humor within the larger serious narrative. By reading Rasselas as an imitation of Ecclesiastes rather than an Oriental tale, critics can begin to identify the humor in Rasselas through the embellishment of the story <b>of</b> Ecclesiastes. <b>The</b> <b>failures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> character Koheleth in Ecclesiastes become the genesis for <b>the</b> <b>failures</b> <b>of</b> Rasselas and his companions; however, <b>the</b> <b>failures</b> <b>of</b> Rasselas and more elaborate and comedic. How Johnson embellishes these failures to create humorous irony in Rasselas becomes clearer for the reader through this new categorization of genre, which can hopefully unite the two opposing views of criticism surrounding this book...|$|R
