500|$|Several estate cottages near Weston Lodge were {{designed}} by W. E. Nesfield between 1860 and 1866, and are among his earliest works. They include Stowford and Magnolia Cottages (1864–65), which Nikolaus Pevsner describes as [...] "cheerful and just a little Kate Greenaway", Smithy Cottage (around 1865) and Fir Tree Cottage (1865), all listed at grade II, {{as well as a}} half-timbered farmhouse on Weston Road. Rather than either the Jacobean mansion or its High Victorian interiors, their style derives from buildings of the Home Counties, with <b>tile</b> <b>hanging,</b> incised pargetting, half-hipped gables and high chimneys. Pevsner credits Nesfield with introducing these features to Cheshire.|$|E
5000|$|Llwynbarried Hall, Nantmel, Radnorshire. Remodelled {{and much}} {{enlarged}} in 1886-89. Originally a 16th-century house. Bargeboarded gables and some <b>tile</b> <b>hanging.</b> Neo-Jacobean staircase.|$|E
50|$|The Pendulum - In {{the first}} round, players must launch {{themselves}} with a rope swing to grab one of ten <b>tiles</b> <b>hanging</b> {{in front of a}} suspended wooden board. Each player is able to have 20 swings to try to get all of the ten tiles. Five of the tiles have a hidden map piece inside, and the player must try to get the most pieces of the map inside them. In the second round, one player has a hammer and must smash open the correct target drums with the rope swing. Another player has the map pieces from the first round showing where the targets are and is to call out where the swinger is supposed to hit. The team that smashes the most targets wins.|$|R

5000|$|Only a {{few dozen}} {{traditional}} Bing Sutts are still operating now, with some others opened by the younger generation fascinated by the nostalgic atmosphere of the Hong Kong style restaurant. Realizing consumers’ desire to take a glimpse of past memories, {{quite a number of}} fast food chains set up and adorn their unique experimental concept stores like Bing Sutts to attract customers. These newly established Bing Sutts are usually decorated with characterized furniture and settings such as the small <b>tile</b> floors, <b>hanging</b> fans, folding chairs and so on, all that remind people of the old days. [...] Some of them have become iconic tourist attractions as well. Those riding the new wave of Bing Sutts are seeking to stay up to the true spirit of simplicity and community.|$|R
5000|$|Grand Hotel Cirta or Hotel Cirta is a {{hotel in}} Constantine, Algeria, located in a white colonial {{building}} at 1 Ave Achour Rachmani, {{on the edge of}} Place des Martyrs. The hotel is the property of the Societe de l'Hotel Cirta, owned by Mr Mohand Tiar, an Algerian businessman and philanthropist. The hotel has 76 rooms, including 30 double rooms, 33 single rooms, 1 triple room and 4 suites and 1 apartment room. Lonely Planet describes it as a [...] "grand old hotel" [...] and [...] "another remnant of the colonial era". In 1972 one publication said of the hotel, [...] "The grandeur of its mosque-like domed lobby, with its light blue <b>tiles</b> and <b>hanging</b> brass lanterns, may be fading somewhat in these post-colonial days of the Peoples' Democratic Republic of Algeria." [...] The hotel contains a cinema.|$|R
5000|$|Shaw's early country houses avoided Neo-Gothic and the {{academic}} styles, reviving vernacular materials like half timber and <b>hanging</b> <b>tiles,</b> with projecting gables and tall massive chimneys with [...] "inglenooks" [...] for warm seating. Shaw's houses soon attracted the misnomer the [...] "Queen Anne style". As his skills developed, he dropped some of the mannered detailing, his buildings gained in dignity, and acquired an air of serenity and a quiet homely charm which were less conspicuous in his earlier works; half timber construction was more sparingly used, and finally disappeared entirely.|$|R
50|$|Pier Terrace {{is one of}} Prior’s most {{important}} early buildings. The influence of Norman Shaw, particularly his Sisters of Bethany Convent, is still apparent in the double pitched tiled roof, stepped rhythm, <b>tile</b> <b>hanging</b> and bay windows of the terrace. However the terrace’s design had much derived from West Country vernacular architecture by comparison to Prior’s initial unexecuted designs for cottages and an hotel at West Bay.|$|E

50|$|The two {{southern}} houses burnt down in 1929 {{and were}} reconstructed as flats with four storey bays {{to the western}} elevation. In 1973 the next four houses were badly damaged by fire but were sympathetically restored. An extension was constructed to the north in the 1970s with vaguely sympathetic <b>tile</b> <b>hanging,</b> though the general design is not good. Some partial re-roofing has now been carried out in smaller red tiles that break up the surface effect of the roof.|$|E
50|$|The {{last major}} alteration, in 1896, focused {{mainly on the}} {{interior}} decoration. The original pine benches were replaced with oak, and the pews arranged so {{that they had a}} single center aisle rather than just the two on the sides. All the new furnishing boasted carved wooden elements such as trefoil piercings that enhanced the Gothic feel of the church. They were complemented by the stenciled walls, polychrome <b>tile</b> floor and <b>hanging</b> brass lanterns. While this primarily reflects the ascendancy of Aestheticism in popular design at the time, the lingering Ecclesiological influence shows in the center aisle, which puts the nave and chancel along a single axis.|$|R
5000|$|Charlwood has two {{hotels in}} {{imposing}} buildings and numerous Bed and Breakfasts on its outskirts.Stanhill Court {{was built in}} 1881 {{as the home of}} William Young, one of the six signatories to the formation of Lloyd's of London by virtue of The Lloyds Act 1871. The exterior is classic Sussex brick and <b>hanging</b> <b>tile,</b> while the interior is in Scots' Baronial style using pitch pine. The fireplace surrounds are of polished Charlwood stone ( [...] Paludina Limestone / Sussex Marble) quarried on the grounds. In 1986 the great grand daughter of Wm Young converted the building into an 11 bedroom hotel. In 1992 Stanhill Court Hotel was leased to Colas who purchased it in 1994 and subsequently increased the bedroom and function room capacity with an additional wing. The hotel has been awarded AA Most Romantic Hotel award.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} has three bays. The left bay (at {{the east of}} the building, numbered 29) has three storeys and a gable. The other two bays have two storeys, and the bay on the right (at the east, originally numbered 33) also has a gable, smaller than that of the left bay. In the ground floor of the left bay is a modern shop front. In the middle storey is a casement window over which is an oriel window. The gable contains <b>hanging</b> <b>tiles</b> in bands. The shop front {{on the ground floor of}} the left bay extends into the middle bay. Over this is a casement window. The right bay has a separate modern shop front in the ground floor. The upper storey is timber-framed and it contains another casement window. The gable contains a row of quatrefoil panels over the window, and above this are curved braces.|$|R
50|$|Examples {{from the}} great Edwardian architects, Charles Rennie Macintosh, Edwin Lutyens and Charles Voysey became a major {{influence}} in domestic design. Macintosh had made sketches in Hever and Chiddingstone during a bicycle tour in the 1890s, noting particularly the Dower House at Chiddingstone (now demolished). The tradition of Kentish oak mullioned and leaded windows, <b>tile</b> <b>hanging</b> and elaborate roofs was assimilated into the ‘Arts & Crafts style producing a series of country houses admired by discerning patrons. The houses, mostly built in the Edwardian period, were known as ‘Butterfly’ houses.|$|E
50|$|Arts and Crafts {{architecture}} {{can be seen}} as {{an extension}} of the Tudorbethan Style in Wales. It is seen as starting c. 1887 under the influence of William Morris and was introduced into Wales by architects such as William Eden Nesfield who was responsible for the rebuilding of Kinmel Hall and the designer W.A.S Benson who was the architect for Clochfaen at Llangurig in Montgomeryshire. These architects very much favoured the use of half-timbered decoration, red brickworks, roof tiles and <b>tile</b> <b>hanging</b> on walls. A notable architect in this tradition was Frank Shayler who had set up offices in Oswestry and Shrewsbury and developed an extensive practice particularly in Montgomeryshire. Shayler, together with other architects in his practice were patronised by Lord Davies of Llandinam and were responsible for a series of Institute buildings as well as restoring a number of half timbered buildings such as the Mermaid in Welshpool and Glyndŵr's Parliament House in Machynlleth. In Radnorshire the architect Stephen W. Williams also worked in this style and built the Offices in Rhayader for the supervision of the Elan Valley Reservoir project. A good example of this style providing domestic housing is the Lodge at Chepstow, built between 1902 and 1908 by an unknown architect. Newman describes this as a witty, if rather belated essay in Norman Shaw style with stone, <b>tile</b> <b>hanging</b> and half-timbered gables.|$|E
50|$|Few {{significant}} external alterations {{were subsequently}} {{made to the}} building. The <b>tile</b> <b>hanging</b> {{on the east side}} of the house and the horizontal sliding sash windows of the kitchen (east wing) are of 19th century origin, as are the French doors in the ground floor north room at the west side of the house. The glazing of the French doors is consistent with an Arts and Crafts era and this may be attributable to Arthur Weekes and his wife Jessie Nelson Weekes, resident together from the date of their marriage in 1888 until Arthur’s death in 1917.|$|E
50|$|The {{house is}} {{built in a}} T-plan with 1½ storeys in Jacobethan style. It is {{constructed}} in red brick with scattered sandstone blocks; the hipped roofs are tiled and have terracotta finials. The upper storey of {{the main part of}} the house is timber framed and jettied with pargeting in the panels; the gable end contains a four-light window and above this is <b>tile</b> <b>hanging.</b> Under the gable is a carved bressumer. To the west is an oak-framed porch on a sandstone plinth. The doorway has a Tudor arch above which is a pargeted panel. The rear wing is single-storeyed.|$|E

50|$|Upper Pengelli is {{a farm in}} the {{township}} of Pengelli in Kerry in the historic county of Montgomeryshire, which {{is now part of}} Powys. The farmhouse is a timber framed house of Lobby entry type probably dating from the earlier part of 17th Century. A gabled wing was added at a right angles to the main house in the mid-19th century, when it was partly brick faced. The <b>tile</b> <b>hanging</b> on the house which imitates slate is mid-20th century. The farm buildings are an example of a small model or Industrial farm by the architects Poundley and Walker. It was part of the Brynllywarch Estates owned by the Naylor Family. It was sold in 1931 to Montgomeryshire County Council and after 1974 became a Powys County Council Smallholding. In the 1980s it was designated for conversion into a Rural Life Museum. It subsequently became derelict and in 2014 offered for sale by Powys County Council.|$|E
40|$|The Oxford Archaeological Unit (OAU) was {{commissioned}} {{to carry out}} an archaeological investigation of the footprint and the curtilage of the Grade II Listed building at 2 Boys Hall Road, Willesborough, Kent (NGR TR 0258 / 4112). The work was undertaken on behalf of Union Railways (South) Limited, {{as part of the}} recording of listed buildings in North East Kent, due to be demolished in advance of CTRL construction. Structurally, No. 2 Boys Hall Road was not fully investigated prior to its dismantling, since much of the historic fabric was visible within the building, and its interest was clearly apparent. Consequently there is no detailed information about some aspects of the buildings construction, but it was inspected at the time of rebuilding (at Romden Road, Smarden, Kent) where it can still be seen. The building is thought to have been constructed around 1600 and reused some medieval timbers. The plan is of two bays, of interest as an unusual small version of the new postmedieval plan type of lobby-entrance house. It has rubble stone walling in the ground floor and gable ends with clay <b>tile</b> <b>hanging</b> over timber framing in the first floor. There is a modern rendered brick outshot on the north side which conceals an earlier timber framed jetty with original wattle and daub panels. The roof is pitched, clad in clay peg tiles with two hipped dormers...|$|E
