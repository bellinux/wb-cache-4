5|$|Research {{work on the}} Book of the Dead {{has always}} posed {{technical}} difficulties thanks {{to the need to}} copy very long hieroglyphic texts. Initially, these were copied out by hand, with the assistance either of <b>tracing</b> <b>paper</b> or a camera lucida. In the mid-19th century, hieroglyphic fonts became available and made lithographic reproduction of manuscripts more feasible. In the present day, hieroglyphics can be rendered in desktop publishing software and this, combined with digital print technology, means that the costs of publishing a Book of the Dead may be considerably reduced. However, a very large amount of the source material in museums around the world remains unpublished.|$|E
25|$|These were {{initially}} {{drawn by hand}} on <b>tracing</b> <b>paper</b> using one sheet {{for each of the}} five colours; the various dot or line screens being added using dry transfer screens, for example Letratone manufactured by Letraset in the UK. The map was drawn at twice final map scale, and photographically reduced to produce the five film positives for printing. This was a simple process that required very few specialist tools. Draughting film has replaced <b>tracing</b> <b>paper.</b> This is a plastic waterproof material etched on one side so that the ink will hold.|$|E

40|$|Museums, libraries, and {{archives}} contain large {{collections of}} pigment-coated and <b>tracing</b> <b>papers.</b> These papers {{are produced by}} specially formulated compositions and manufacturing procedures that make them particularly vulnerable to damage as well as reactive to solvents used in conservation treatments. In order to evaluate the effects of solvents on such papers, several research projects were designed to consider the variables of paper composition, properties, and aging, as well as type of solvent and technique of solvent application. This paper summarizes findings for materials characterization, degradative effects of aging, and some effects of solvents used for stain reduction, and humidification and flattening, of pigment-coated and modern <b>tracing</b> <b>papers.</b> Pigment-coated papers have been used, virtually {{since the beginning of}} papermaking history, for their special properties of gloss and brightness. These properties, however, may render coated papers more susceptible to certain types of damage (surface marring, embedded grime, and stains) and more reactive to certai...|$|R
50|$|Originally, {{designs and}} motifs were not {{drawn on the}} cloth. The design was first {{outlined}} with needle and thread, followed by focal points, and then the filling motifs were done. In a kantha with a predominant central motif the centre was done first, followed by corner designs and the other details. In some types of kanthas (carpet, lik and sujni, etc.) wooden blocks were used to print the outline. The blocks are replaced today by patterns drawn in <b>tracing</b> <b>papers.</b>|$|R

While this version of the frontispiece was not used for Condemned Building, those four artists/architects and the works contained within their respective books were influential to the frontispiece that was ultimately published in Condemned Building.|$|E

500|$|Gertie was McCay's {{first piece}} of {{animation}} with detailed backgrounds. [...] McCay drew the foreground characters, while art student neighbor John A. Fitzsimmons traced the backgrounds. [...] McCay pioneered the [...] "McCay Split System" [...] of inbetweening, in which major poses or positions were drawn first, and the intervening frames drawn after. [...] This relieved tedium and improved {{the timing of the}} film's actions. [...] McCay refused to patent his system, and was sued in 1914 by animator John Randolph Bray, who took advantage of McCay's lapse by patenting many of McCay's techniques, including the use of registration marks, <b>tracing</b> <b>paper,</b> the Mutoscope action viewer, and the cycling of drawings to create repetitive action. [...] The lawsuit was unsuccessful, and there is evidence that McCay may have countersued — he thereafter received royalty payments from Bray for licensing the techniques.|$|E

500|$|Although Gertie is popularly {{thought to}} be the {{earliest}} animated film, McCay had earlier made Little Nemo(1911) and How a Mosquito Operates(1912). The American J. Stuart Blackton and the French Émile Cohl had experimented with animation even earlier; Gertie being a character with an appealing personality distinguished McCay's film from these earlier [...] "trick films". [...] Gertie was the first film to use animation techniques such as keyframes, registration marks, <b>tracing</b> <b>paper,</b> the Mutoscope action viewer, and animation loops. [...] It influenced the next generation of animators such as the Fleischer brothers, Otto Messmer, Paul Terry, and Walt Disney. [...] John Randolph Bray unsuccessfully tried to patent many of McCay's animation techniques and {{is said to have been}} behind a plagiarized version of Gertie that appeared a year or two after the original. [...] Gertie is the best preserved of McCay's films—some of which have been lost or survive only in fragments—and has been preserved in the U.S. Library of Congress' National Film Registry as being [...] "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".|$|E
500|$|McCay {{pioneered the}} [...] "McCay Split System" [...] of animation, in which major poses or {{positions}} were drawn {{first and the}} intervening frames drawn after. [...] This relieved tedium and improved {{the timing of the}} film's actions. [...] McCay was open about the techniques that he developed, and refused to patent his system, reportedly saying, [...] "Any idiot that wants to make a couple of thousand drawings for a hundred feet of film is welcome to join the club." [...] During production of Gertie, he showed the details to a visitor who claimed to be writing an article about animation. The visitor was animator John Randolph Bray, who sued McCay in 1914 after taking advantage of McCay's lapse to patent many of the techniques, including the use of registration marks, <b>tracing</b> <b>paper,</b> and the Mutoscope action viewer, and the cycling of drawings to create repetitive action.

2500|$|Warhol was {{an early}} adopter of the silk screen printmaking process as a {{technique}} for making paintings. While working in the shoe industry, Warhol developed his [...] "blotted line" [...] technique, [...] applying ink to paper and then blotting the ink while still wet, which was akin to a printmaking process on the most rudimentary scale. His use of <b>tracing</b> <b>paper</b> and ink allowed him to repeat the basic image and also to create endless variations on the theme, a method that prefigures his 1960s silk-screen canvas. In his book , Warhol writes, [...] "When you do something exactly wrong, you always turn up something." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2007, to {{coincide}} with the 50th anniversary of On the Roads publishing, Viking issued two new editions: On the Road: The Original Scroll, and On the Road: 50th Anniversary Edition. By far the more significant is Scroll, a transcription of the original draft typed as one long paragraph on sheets of <b>tracing</b> <b>paper</b> which Kerouac taped together to form a [...] scroll. The text is more sexually explicit than Viking allowed to be published in 1957, and also uses the real names of Kerouac's friends rather than the fictional names he later substituted. Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay paid $2.43 million for the original scroll and allowed an exhibition tour that concluded at the end of 2009. The other new issue, 50th Anniversary Edition, is a reissue of the 40th anniversary issue under an updated title.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first draft}} {{of what was to}} become the {{published}} novel was written in three weeks in April 1951, while Kerouac lived with Joan Haverty, his second wife, at 454 West 20th Street in New York City's Manhattan. The manuscript was typed on what he called [...] "the scroll"—a continuous, 120-foot scroll of <b>tracing</b> <b>paper</b> sheets that he cut to size and taped together. The roll was typed single-spaced, without margins or paragraph breaks. In the following years, Kerouac continued to revise this manuscript, deleting some sections (including some sexual depictions deemed pornographic in the 1950s) and adding smaller literary passages. Kerouac wrote a number of inserts intended for On the Road between 1951 and 1952, before eventually omitting them from the manuscript and using them to form the basis of another work, Visions of Cody (1951–1952). On the Road was championed within Viking Press by Malcolm Cowley and was published by Viking in 1957, based on revisions of the 1951 manuscript. Besides differences in formatting, the published novel was shorter than the original scroll manuscript and used pseudonyms for all of the major characters.|$|E
2500|$|While the {{technical}} {{principles of the}} camera obscura have been known since antiquity, the broad use of {{the technical}} concept in producing images with a linear perspective in paintings, maps, theatre setups and architectural and later photographic images and movies started in the Western Renaissance and the scientific revolution. While e.g. Alhazen (Ibn al-Haytham) had already observed an optical effect and developed {{a state of the}} art theory of the refraction of light, he was less interested to produce images with it (compare Hans Belting 2005); the society he lived in was even hostile (compare Aniconism in Islam) towards personal images. Western artists and philosophers used the Arab findings in new frameworks of epistemic relevance. [...] E.g. Leonardo da Vinci used the camera obscura as a model of the eye, René Descartes for eye and mind and John Locke started to use the camera obscura as a metaphor of human understanding per se. The modern use of the camera obscura as an epistemic machine had important side effects for science.While the use of the camera obscura has dwindled away, for those who are interested in making one it only requires a few items including: a box, <b>tracing</b> <b>paper,</b> tape, foil, a box cutter, a pencil and a blanket to keep out the light.|$|E

2500|$|For {{the next}} six years, Kerouac {{continued}} to write regularly. Building upon previous drafts tentatively titled [...] "The Beat Generation" [...] and [...] "Gone on the Road," [...] Kerouac completed what {{is now known as}} On the Road in April 1951, while living at 454 West 20th Street in Manhattan with his second wife, Joan Haverty. [...] The book was largely autobiographical and describes Kerouac's road-trip adventures across the United States and Mexico with Neal Cassady in the late 40s and early 50s, as well as his relationships with other Beat writers and friends. [...] He completed the first version of the novel during a three-week extended session of spontaneous confessional prose. [...] Kerouac wrote the final draft in 20 days, with Joan, his wife, supplying him with benzedrine, cigarettes, bowls of pea soup and mugs of coffee to keep him going. [...] Before beginning, Kerouac cut sheets of <b>tracing</b> <b>paper</b> into long strips, wide enough for a typewriter, and taped them together into a [...] long roll which he then fed into the machine. This allowed him to type continuously without the interruption of reloading pages. The resulting manuscript contained no chapter or paragraph breaks and was much more explicit than the version which would eventually be published. [...] Though [...] "spontaneous," [...] Kerouac had prepared long in advance before beginning to write. [...] In fact, according to his Columbia professor and mentor Mark Van Doren, he had outlined much of the work in his journals over the several preceding years.|$|E
