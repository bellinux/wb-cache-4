Tudik and Valuev (1980) were able to measure the EMR frequency during tensile fracture of iron and aluminum in the region 1014¬¬ Hz by using photomultipliers. Srilakshmi and Misra (2005a) also reported an additional phenomenon of secondary electromagnetic radiation in uncoated and metal-coated metals and alloys. If a solid material is subjected to stresses of large amplitudes, which can cause plastic deformation and fracture, emissions such as thermal, acoustic, ions, exo-emissions occur. With the discovery of new materials and advancement in instrumentation to measure effects of EMR, crack formation and fracture; the EMR emissions effect becomes important.|$|E

These <b>transient</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> events are observed in the L= 6. 0 - 9. 4 and 0700 - 1600 magnetic local time (MLT) sector. It is found that the detection rate and the magnitude of magnetic field perturbation increase as {{the distance from the}} magnetopause decreases, which suggests that the <b>transient</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> events are the phenomena near the magnetopause. In northern latitudes the radial component of the magnetic field shows a positive perturbation followed by a negative perturbation, while in southern latitudes the reversed sequence is seen. This tendency is the same as FTE 2 ̆ 7 s. Examination of the simultaneously obtained IMP- 8 and ISEE- 1 magnetic field data indicates that the <b>transient</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> events occur mainly in association with southward orientation of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF). This tendency is also the same as FTE 2 ̆ 7 s. These similarities in statistical characteristics suggest that the <b>transient</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> events are caused by the same generation mechanism as FTE 2 ̆ 7 s. One of the interesting features revealed in this study is the MLT-dependence of the rotational polarity of the transverse magnetic field perturbation. The rotation is predominantly left-handed (with respect to the ambient magnetic field) in the forenoon sector, while it is right-handed in the afternoon sector. This suggests that the source of the magnetic field perturbation, presumably located near the magnetopause, moves azimuthally tailward...|$|E

40|$|In <b>transient</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> computation, it {{is highly}} {{desirable}} if the stray capacitances among all conductors can be computed and their effects addressed conveniently. Because {{of the existence of}} floating conductors, the general finite element (FE) solver of Poisson's equation, which is a commonly used magnetic field solver, cannot be used to extract the capacitance matrix directly. In this paper, methods to deal with floating conductors in the electrostatic field for field solution, and capacitance matrix extraction using finite element method (FEM) are compared; their merits and shortcomings are discussed. A method to compute the electric field and extract the capacitance matrix to include the effect of floating conductors inside the solution domain is put forward. The merit of the proposed algorithm is that the general FE solver can be used without the need for any special program modification. A FE formulation to automatically include the capacitances in <b>transient</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> is presented.

40|$|Pulsed <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> {{gradients}} {{are fundamental}} to spatial encoding and diffusion weighting in magnetic resonance. The ideal pulsed <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> gradient should have negligible {{rise and fall}} times, however, there are physical limits to how fast the <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> gradient may change with time. Finite gradient switching times, and <b>transient,</b> secondary, induced <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> gradients (eddy currents) alter the ideal gradient waveform and may introduce a variety of undesirable image artifacts. We have developed a new method to measure the complete <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> gradient waveform. The measurement employs a heavily doped test sample with short MR relaxation times (T- 1, T- 2, and T- 2 * < 100 mus) {{and a series of}} closely spaced broadband radiofrequency excitations, combined with single point data acquisition. This technique, a measure of evolving signal phase, directly determines the <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> gradient waveform experienced by the test sample. The measurement is sensitive to low level <b>transient</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> produced by eddy currents and other short and long time constant non-ideal gradient waveform behaviors. Data analysis is particularly facile permitting a very ready experimental check of gradient performance. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved...|$|R
