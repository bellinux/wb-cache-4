5|$|Dominican {{popular music}} history {{can be traced}} back to the 1940s and '50s, when dance bands like the Casimir Brothers and, later, The Swinging Stars, became famous across the island. Their music was a dance-oriented version of many kinds of Caribbean and Latin popular music, such as Cuban bolero, Brazilian samba, the merengue from the Dominican Republic, <b>Trinidadian</b> calypso, and American funk.|$|E
5|$|On 29 August 2007, it was {{confirmed}} {{that he had}} joined Sunderland in a deal valued at £6 million with fellow-Trinidadian Stern John moving to Southampton. The <b>Trinidadian</b> striker made his debut for Sunderland on 1 September in a 1–0 defeat to Manchester United and scored his first goal for the club in a 2–1 home win over Reading on 15 September.|$|E
5|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 1960s, calypso and <b>Trinidadian</b> steelpan became the most popular styles of music on Dominica, replacing traditional Carnival music like chanté mas and lapo kabwit. Early recording stars from this era included Swinging Busters, The Gaylords, De Boys an Dem and Los Caballeros, while chorale groups also gained fans, especially Lajenne Etwal, Siflé Montan'y and the Dominica Folk singers. These early popular musicians were aided by the spread of radio broadcasting, beginning with WIDBS and later Radio Dominica.|$|E

50|$|Afro-Trinidadians and Tobagonians {{accounted}} for 35.4 per {{cent of the}} population of Trinidad and Tobago according to the 2011 Census. However, the classification is primarily a superficial description based on phenotypical (physical) description opposed to genotypical (genetic) classification. It is not uncommon for <b>Trinidadians</b> of both Indian and African descent to be considered Afro-Trinidadian solely based on appearance. An additional 22.8 per cent of <b>Trinidadians</b> described themselves as being multiracial, of whom 7.7 per cent were dougla (mixed African and Indian ethnicity).|$|R

Baptiste placed 22nd out of the 40 quarterfinal-qualifying athletes, ranking the highest out of all <b>Trinidadian</b> athletes in the quarterfinal round. She did not progress to semifinals.|$|E
5|$|Following the ALP's {{victory in}} the 1999 general election, Bird was again {{appointed}} to the Cabinet, this time as Minister of Trade, Industry and Business Development. By July 2000, he had become Minister of Agriculture, Lands and Fisheries; in this role, he held talks with fishermen over the dumping of dredged material in the ocean and signed a trade agreement with Trinidad and Tobago to end a year-long ban on the import of <b>Trinidadian</b> produce.|$|E
5|$|George Alric R. Dewhurst (31 October 1894 – 4 January 1954) was a <b>Trinidadian</b> cricketer {{who played}} for West Indies before the team {{attained}} Test match status. A highly regarded wicket-keeper, Dewhurst was an influential and popular member of the Trinidad and West Indian sides. In his later career, he improved substantially as a batsman. He toured England with the West Indies team in 1923 but missed the 1928 tour of England in controversial circumstances. Despite continued speculation {{that he would be}} recalled, he did not play representative cricket again.|$|E

5|$|In {{the context}} of Anglophone music, the term Antillean music most {{commonly}} refers to Trinidad and Tobago, home to the well-known calypso style. Music author Peter Manuel, for example, treats all the Anglophone islands as a subject of <b>Trinidadian</b> calypso traditions, while using the title Music of the Lesser Antilles for Francophone Antillean music. Manuel also, like many authors, treats Suriname and Guyana as integral aspects of Caribbean music; due to the Dutch colonial history of both countries, they are often grouped with Aruba and the Netherlands Antilles.|$|E
5|$|Indo-Caribbean {{people in}} the Lesser Antillean music area are {{clustered}} in Guyana, Suriname, and Trinidad and Tobago. Indo-Caribbean folk traditions include the chowtal songs from the springtime festival phagwa, and Hindi bhajans which are still sung at temples despite there being few people who understand Hindi. Guyanese and <b>Trinidadian</b> Indo-Caribbeans developed a tradition that fused elements of calypso with the folk music of North India, a style that {{was referred to as}} local music.|$|E
5|$|Italian naturalist Camillo Ranzani {{published}} the first scientific {{description of the}} smalltail shark, in an 1839 volume of Novi Commentarii Academiae Scientiarum Instituti Bononiensis. He named the new shark Carcharias porosus from the Greek porus ("pore"), referring to the prominent pores behind its eyes. The type specimen, a -long male from Brazil, has since been lost. This species {{was moved to the}} genus Carcharhinus by later authors. Its <b>Trinidadian</b> name is puppy shark.|$|E

50|$|Callaloo {{is widely}} known {{throughout}} the Caribbean {{and has a}} distinctively Caribbean origin, created by enslaved Africans using ideas of the indigenous people along with both African (okra) and indigenous (Xanthosoma) plants. (See Palaver sauce for the West African dish.) African Americans invented {{a version of the}} original West African dish known as collard greens. <b>Trinidadians</b> have embraced this dish from their ancestors and over time have added ingredients such as coconut milk to modify its flavour. Callaloo is mostly served as a side dish, for <b>Trinidadians,</b> Bajans, and Grenadians it usually accompanies rice, macaroni pie, and a meat of choice. In Guyana it is made in various ways without okra.|$|R

5|$|Steel drums are a distinctively <b>Trinidadian</b> {{ensemble}} {{that evolved}} from improvised percussion instruments used in Carnival processions. By the late 1930s, bamboo tubes, a traditional instrumental, were supplemented by {{pieces of metal}} used percussively; over time, these metal percussion instruments were pitched to produce as many as twenty-some tones. Steel bands were large orchestras of these drums, and were banned by the British colonial authorities. Nevertheless, steel drums spread across the Caribbean, and are now an entrenched {{part of the culture}} of Trinidad and Tobago.|$|E
5|$|Ten athletes {{composed}} Trinidad and Tobago's female {{track and}} field team. Of those, three participated only in individual track events (Sasha Springer-Jones, Aleesha Barber, Josanne Lucas); three participated in individual field events (Rhonda Watkins, Cleopatra Borel-Brown, and Candice Scott); two participated in only team track events (Wanda Hutson and Ayanna Hutchinson); and two participated in both individual and team track events (Kelly-Ann Baptiste and Semoy Hackett). No medalists came from the <b>Trinidadian</b> female {{track and field}} team in Beijing, although all 100meters sprinters progressed to quarterfinals.|$|E
5|$|During the 1980s, cadence-lypso’s {{popularity}} declined greatly. Some Dominican performers remained famous, such as Ophelia, a very renowned {{singer of}} the period. Popular music during this time was mostly zouk, a style pioneered by the French Antillean band Kassav, who used styles of folk music of Martinique and Guadeloupe. Soca, a kind of <b>Trinidadian</b> music, was also popular at the time, producing bands like Windward Caribbean Kulture. The '80s also saw a rise in popular for jazz {{and the formation of}} several jazz bands, while groups like Exile One began exploring tradition rhythms from jing ping and lapo kabwit.|$|E

5|$|Spouge is a {{style of}} Barbadian popular music created by Jackie Opel in the 1960s. It is {{primarily}} a fusion of Jamaican ska with <b>Trinidadian</b> calypso, but is also influenced by {{a wide variety of}} musics from the British Isles and United States, include sea shanties, hymns and spirituals. Spouge instrumentation originally consisted of cowbell, bass guitar, trap set and various other electronic and percussion instruments, later augmented by saxophone, trombone and trumpets. Of these, the cowbell and the guitar are widely seen as the most integral part of the instrumentation, and are said to reflect the African origin of much of Barbadian music.|$|E
5|$|The calypso song {{complex is}} {{characterized}} by satirical, political, risque and humorous lyricism, a competitive and celebratory nature and its function in social organization and informal communication. Jamaican mento {{is perhaps the most}} well-known form of calypso-like music. The island of Carriacou is home to a calypso-like song style, as well as canboulay feasts, calinda songs and steel bands, all similar to though distinct from the related <b>Trinidadian</b> traditions. Modern influences from Trinidad have organized the Carriacou song style, and there are competitions similar to calypso tents on the island. The Antiguan benna is part of the same song complex, featuring news-oriented and ribald, often satirical lyrics and a rhythmic, uptempo style.|$|E
5|$|Then 20-year-old University of California, Los Angeles long jumper Rhonda Watkins competed on Trinidad and Tobago's behalf as {{the only}} <b>Trinidadian</b> long jumper in Beijing. Watkins had not {{previously}} competed in any Olympic event. During the qualification round, which took place on August 18, Watkins participated in the first heat. She completed a jump of 5.88meters, placing 18th out of a heat that included 21 athletes; of that group, 19 ranked. She ranked ahead of Belize's Tricia Flores (5.25meters) and behind the Republic of the Congo's Pamela Mouele-Mboussi (6.06meters). The heat leaders were Brazil's Maurren Higa Maggi (6.79meters) and Sweden's Carolina Klüft (6.70meters). Overall, Watkins ranked 37th out of the 38 ranking athletes (and 42 involved athletes). She did not advance to the final round.|$|E
50|$|Although people {{migrated}} {{from all over}} the country, the population in 1931 was less than 500. There were very few houses, no schools, and recreational and other facilities. As a result, <b>Trinidadians</b> who went to work in Point Fortin never took their families with them.|$|R
