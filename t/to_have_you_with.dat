2500|$|Johnson {{attempted}} in vain {{to capitalize}} on Kennedy's youth, poor health, and failure {{to take a position}} regarding Joseph McCarthy. He had formed a [...] "Stop Kennedy" [...] coalition with Adlai Stevenson, Stuart Symington, and Hubert Humphrey, but it proved a failure. Johnson received 409 votes on the only ballot at the Democratic convention, which nominated John F. Kennedy. Tip O'Neill was a representative from Kennedy's home state of Massachusetts at that time, and he recalled that Johnson approached him at the convention and said, [...] "Tip, I know you have to support Kennedy at the start, but I'd like <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>with</b> me on the second ballot." [...] O'Neill replied, [...] "Senator, there's {{not going to be any}} second ballot." ...|$|E
6000|$|Henry turned submissively away; but Bedford tarried {{an instant}} to say, 'Fair sister, he is sore distressed. It would comfort him <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>with</b> him. He has longed for you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why {{not stay}} behind with us until your father returns? You {{know that you}} would be most welcome, and that it would gladden all our hearts <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>with</b> us." ...|$|E
6000|$|Constance {{shook her}} head. [...] "I do not think, Ned, that our father {{would give you}} leave, at any rate not until <b>you</b> <b>have</b> grown up into a man. He looks <b>to</b> <b>having</b> <b>you</b> <b>with</b> him, and <b>to</b> your {{succeeding}} him some day in the command of the Good Venture, while he remains quietly at home with our mother." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I'll {{come down}} <b>with</b> <b>you</b> and <b>have</b> a {{shakedown}} on your sofa. Good-night, Smith. I {{am so sorry}} <b>to</b> <b>have</b> disturbed <b>you</b> <b>with</b> my foolishness." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Even so," [...] said Eleanor. [...] "And thus didst thou win the esteem of thy kinsman. 'The {{stripling}} is {{loyal and}} trustworthy,' he <b>has</b> said <b>to</b> me; 'pity {{that such a}} heart should be pierced in an inglorious field. Would that I could find him, and strive to return to him something of what his father's care hath wrought for me.' Richard, trust me, {{it would be a}} real joy and lightening of his grief <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>thee</b> <b>with</b> him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This noon. It's all arranged, daddy, and you'll {{just have}} a glorious time with the old colonel. Bless his dear heart, he'll be overjoyed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>with</b> him, at last." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{are glad}} <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>with</b> us on any terms, and I {{take it as}} {{particularly}} kind, {{that you did not}} pass my door. You have been here some days?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How can I {{talk about}} it, Ayala? There isn't such a thing. But yet,--but yet; oh, Ayala, {{do you not}} know that <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>with</b> me {{would be better than}} anything?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{is still}} feeling the shock," [...] Draconmeyer said. [...] "I {{think that she}} is {{inclined}} to be hysterical. It would do her good <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> talk <b>with</b> her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'd like first rate <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> come <b>with</b> me, Rover," [...] {{said the}} cadet, Frank Newberry by name; [...] "and if your cousin Fred {{wants to come}} along, he can do so." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course, I should <b>have</b> liked <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>you</b> <b>with</b> me, {{but in no}} {{case would}} <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>you</b> {{sacrifice}} yourself; still less now, when I have met with such kind friends, and am happy and comfortable in my life. Therefore, my boy, let us set aside at once all idea of your becoming a doctor. There is no occasion for you to choose, immediately, what you will do. You are too old now to enter the royal navy, and it is well that, before you finally decide on a profession, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> the opportunity of seeing something of the world.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{hope you}} won't like, Ralph. In {{the first place}} I want <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>with</b> me; and in the second, {{you will be a}} large landowner, and {{property}} has its duties." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{conductor}} came in. He {{had once}} called at Babbitt's office, {{to ask about}} houses. [...] "H' are you, Mr. Babbitt! We going <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>with</b> us to Chicago? This your boy?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It's so ungrateful of me, but--but, though I {{know you}} care for me, and I like <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>with</b> me, I'd--I'd even {{sacrifice}} you, if that would bring me what I want.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We must try," [...] said Marian, [...] "we can't be {{as useful}} and ready as she was, {{but we will}} do our very best. I am sure Mrs. Lyddell likes <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> sit <b>with</b> her." ...|$|R
60|$|Bel. I am {{infinitely}} happy <b>to</b> <b>have</b> met <b>you</b> <b>with</b> Donna Aurelia, {{that you}} may do me the favour to satisfy this lady of a truth, which I can scarce persuade her to believe.|$|R
6000|$|... 'SIR,--I regret <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> trouble <b>you</b> <b>with</b> {{a second}} communication, [...] but my former letter was posted before a change {{occurred}} in the [...] circumstances. You will be pleased to hear that I have no longer the [...] affliction of speaking of your noble kinsman as [...] "the late Marquis of [...] Restalrig."' ...|$|R
60|$|LORD ILLINGWORTH. My dear boy, if I didn't {{like you}} I wouldn't have made you the offer. It is because I like {{you so much}} that I want <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>with</b> me.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's so ungrateful of me, but--but, though I {{know you}} care for me, and I like <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>with</b> me, I'd--I"d even {{sacrifice}} you, if that would bring me what I want." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Much more useful, major; and indeed, I am glad <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>with</b> me. You have {{youth and}} good spirits, and good spirits are very scarce here. Have {{you heard the}} last news?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thankee," [...] said he; [...] "then we'll {{consider}} that it's to come off, when convenient <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> dined <b>with</b> Mr. Jaggers yet?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you!" [...] {{said the}} girl. [...] "That {{was not what}} I asked you. I know what my father meant to do, and I didn't need any reassurance. I'm sorry <b>to</b> <b>have</b> troubled <b>you</b> <b>with</b> all these {{irrelevant}} questions; and I {{thank you very much}} for the kind advice <b>you</b> <b>have</b> given me." ...|$|R
60|$|MRS GEORGE. I shall {{get rid of}} you if the beadle <b>has</b> <b>to</b> brain <b>you</b> <b>with</b> the mace for it [she {{makes for}} the tower].|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{will be so}} nice! And then I {{shall be}} sure <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>with</b> me the first moment I see them. I shall think it very awful when I first meet your father." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What! Sir Oliver Buttesthorn!" [...] cried Sir Nigel. [...] "I {{had heard}} that you were come into camp, and had hoped to see you. Glad and proud shall I be <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>with</b> me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is right, Dicky. If we {{win this}} {{campaign}} I will certainly ask {{for you as}} adjutant. I shall be awfully glad <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>with</b> me, and I really do want an adjutant for each battalion.|$|E
6000|$|... "Glad am I," [...] {{continued}} Caligula, {{when the}} excitement had calmed down momentarily, [...] "that my efforts <b>to</b> please <b>you</b> <b>have</b> met <b>with</b> success." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank {{goodness}} I've {{found you}} at last. I've been hunting for you an hour, and began <b>to</b> fear <b>you</b> <b>had</b> met <b>with</b> some misfortune." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I hear <b>you</b> <b>have</b> been <b>to</b> Torquay," [...] he said, {{looking at}} her critically, [...] "it seems <b>to</b> <b>have</b> agreed <b>with</b> <b>you.</b> You are looking well!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{shall be}} glad <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>with</b> me again, for I have {{conceived}} a strong friendship for you, and think none the worse {{of you for}} your showing your gratitude to the family in whom you are interested." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, nonsense!" [...] George said. [...] "I {{should like}} <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>with</b> me, Bill; I should really. Besides, what's the {{difference}} between us? We have both got to work for ourselves and make our way in the world." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Cynthy and I was thinkin' of takin' {{a little}} trip," [...] said Jethro, almost apologetically, [...] "and {{we kind of}} thought we'd like <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>with</b> us. Didn't we, Cynthy? Er--we might see General Grant," [...] he added meaningly.|$|E
6000|$|... "I told {{my mother}} that I was going <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> breakfast <b>with</b> me; and I believe she was well {{satisfied}} that I should, for a time, be out of her way." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Eugene, dear, {{you made}} me go out, but I ought <b>to</b> <b>have</b> stayed <b>with</b> <b>you.</b> You are more flushed than <b>you</b> <b>have</b> been for many days. What <b>have</b> <b>you</b> been doing?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is only fear, sir," [...] said Albert, {{stepping}} forward, [...] "that whereas {{we thought}} <b>to</b> <b>have</b> stayed <b>with</b> <b>you</b> till to-morrow, we must now take farewell of you to-night." ...|$|R
