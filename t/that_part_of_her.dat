5|$|Asher {{broke off}} the {{engagement}} in early 1968, after {{coming back from}} an acting assignment in Bristol to find McCartney in bed with another woman, Francie Schwartz. McCartney and Asher later attempted to mend their relationship, but finally broke up in July1968. Asher has consistently refused to publicly discuss <b>that</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> life. Schwartz, a twenty three year old New York scriptwriter, had travelled to London trying to interest Apple Corps in a film script. Schwartz was then asked by McCartney to move into his Cavendish Avenue house, and was given a job working for Derek Taylor at Apple, which was then based in Wigmore Street, London.

5|$|The {{mutilated}} body of {{the fourth}} woman, prostitute Annie Chapman, was discovered at about 6:00am on Saturday 8 September on the ground near a doorway {{in the back yard}} of 29 Hanbury Street, Spitalfields. Chapman had left her lodgings at 2am on the day she was murdered, with the intention of getting money from a client to pay her rent. Her throat was cut from left to right. She had been disembowelled, and her intestines had been thrown out of her abdomen over each of her shoulders. The morgue examination revealed <b>that</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> uterus was missing. The pathologist, George Bagster Phillips, was of the opinion that the murderer must have possessed anatomical knowledge to have sliced out the reproductive organs in a single movement with a blade about 6–8inches (15–20cm) long. However, the idea that the murderer possessed surgical skill was dismissed by other experts. As the bodies were not examined extensively at the scene, it has also been suggested that the organs were actually removed by mortuary staff, who took advantage of bodies that had already been opened to extract organs that they could sell as surgical specimens.|$|E

2500|$|Another biography, The Real Bettie Page: The Truth {{about the}} Queen of Pinups (1997) {{was written by}} Richard Foster.

2500|$|During [...] "The Callas Debate", Italian critic Rodolfo Celletti stated, [...] "The timbre of Callas's voice, {{considered}} purely as sound, {{was essentially}} ugly: {{it was a}} thick sound, which {{gave the impression of}} dryness, of aridity. It lacked those elements which, in a singer's jargon, are described as velvet and varnish... yet I really believe <b>that</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> appeal was precisely due to this fact. Why? Because for all its natural lack of varnish, velvet and richness, this voice could acquire such distinctive colours and timbres as to be unforgettable." [...] However, in his review of Callas's 1951 live recording of I vespri siciliani, Ira Siff writes, [...] "Accepted wisdom tells us that Callas possessed, even early on, a flawed voice, unattractive by conventional standards—an instrument that signaled from the beginning vocal problems to come. Yet listen to her entrance in this performance and one encounters a rich, spinning sound, ravishing by any standard, capable of delicate dynamic nuance. High notes are free of wobble, chest tones unforced, and the middle register displays none of the [...] "bottled" [...] quality that became more and more pronounced as Callas matured." ...|$|E
