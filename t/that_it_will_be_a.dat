He did not have any dialogue in the film and the actor's acting muscles were stretched as he had to use body language and facial expressions to convey his feelings and thoughts, with Vikram also applying the make up for the character himself.

500|$|Michael G. Wilson {{decided on}} the film's title Quantum of Solace only [...] "a few days" [...] before its {{announcement}} on 24 January 2008. It {{was the name of}} a short story in Ian Fleming's anthology For Your Eyes Only (1960). The film is related to the title in one of its thematic elements: [...] "when the 'Quantum of Solace' drops to zero, humanity and consideration of one human for another is gone." [...] Daniel Craig admitted, [...] "I was unsure at first. Bond is looking for his quantum of solace and that's what he wants, he wants his closure. Ian Fleming says that if you don't have a quantum of solace in your relationship then the relationship is over. It's that spark of niceness in a relationship that if you don't have you might as well give up." [...] He said that [...] "Bond doesn't have that because his girlfriend [...] has been killed," [...] and therefore, [...] " [...] looking for revenge... to make himself happy with the world again." [...] Afterwards, Quantum was made the name of the organisation introduced in Casino Royale. Craig noted the letter Q itself looks rather odd. Near the end of the film, the Camille Montes character and Bond have a discussion about their individual quests to avenge the deaths of their loved ones. Montes asks Bond to [...] "let me know what it feels like" [...] when he succeeds, the implication of the title being <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> small amount of solace compared to his despair. Bond's lack of emotion when he does exact revenge shows this to be the case.|$|E

[...] The following day, during a formal dinner at Statler Hotel that the finalists and the media attended, Wurster pronounced Saarinen the winner of the competition and awarded the checks—$40,000 to his team and $50,000 to Saarinen. The competition was the first major architectural design that Saarinen developed unaided by his father.|$|E

Later in 1899, Winn took over publication of Free Society and discontinued Coming Era and Winn's Freelance. In 1902, he announced a new paper called Winn's Firebrand. It's likely he fancied the name of the then-defunct weekly. His vision was for a paper that would appeal to people of all classes. According to Winn, it would be [...] "just the kind of literature for missionary work among the masses". Winn considered the printed word as the most effective tool for social awakening, and saw the dissemination of anti-authoritarian ideals, especially in the conservative South, as his distinct calling. Tennessee became his base of operation: [...] "In establishing the magazine (in Mt. Juliet), as an independent publication, the flag of revolutionary thought is planted on Southern soil, and a residence of a lifetime in this section convinces me <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> fruitful field for libertarian ideas, if the right methods are used to present them." ...|$|E

2500|$|Some {{scholars}} {{have concluded that}} Melville composed Moby-Dick in two or even three stages. Reasoning {{from a series of}} inconsistencies and structural developments in the final version, they hypothesize that the work he mentioned to Dana was, in the words of Lawrence Buell, a [...] "relatively straightforward" [...] whaling adventure, but that reading Shakespeare and his encounters with Hawthorne inspired him to rewrite it as [...] "an epic of cosmic encyclopedic proportions". Bezanson objects that the letter contains too many ambiguities to assume [...] "that Dana's 'suggestion' would obviously be that Melville do for whaling what he had done for life on a man-of-war in White-Jacket". In addition, Dana had experienced how incomparable Melville was in dramatic story telling when he met him in Boston, so perhaps [...] "his 'suggestion' was that Melville do a book that captured that gift". And the long sentence {{in the middle of the}} above quotation simply acknowledges that Melville is struggling with the problem, not of choosing between fact and fancy but of how to interrelate them. The most positive statements are <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> strange sort of a book and that Melville means to give the truth of the thing, but what thing exactly is not clear.|$|E
