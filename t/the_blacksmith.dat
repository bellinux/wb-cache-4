5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>blacksmith's</b> {{work was}} one of the most popular crafts in many regions of Azerbaijan, {{including}} Baku. According to the intended purpose of <b>the</b> products, <b>the</b> <b>blacksmith’s</b> production was subdivided into three parts: - agricultural tools;- household utensils;- tools for using in other crafts. There were specialized craftsmen involved in each of these three sectors. As a rule, 3-4 men worked in <b>the</b> <b>blacksmith’s</b> shop: a master, journeyman or journeymen-in-training. Their products were sold in the town and country markets. Among <b>the</b> <b>blacksmith’s</b> shops, those specialized in making horse-shoes were widely spread. Mainly located along roadsides, they were engaged in horseshoeing and minor repairs. Horseshoes were divided in three types: a local horseshoe - Lagij nali, a Russian horseshoe - Gazakh nail and Garabagh nali.|$|R

5|$|A {{sedentary}} ambush predator, the Pacific angelshark feeds {{mainly on}} bony fishes, including kelp bass, croakers, flatfishes, damselfishes, mackerels, and sardines. During {{the winter and}} early spring, spawning squid are abundant and become {{the primary source of}} food. In the southern Gulf of California, the most important prey species are, in descending order, the mackerel Decapterus macrosoma, the toadfish Porichthys analis, the lizardfish Synodus evermann, the soldierfish Myripristis leiognathus, and the shrimp Sicyonia penicillata.

5|$|The layers {{are then}} left to dry under the sun, {{after which the}} entire mold is heated in a furnace to melt away the wax and {{hardening}} the coal/mud mixture, leaving behind a hollowed shell. With this hardened mold, molten bronze is poured down the mold’s mouth cavity, cooled to a certain degree, then the coal/mud is broken apart, revealing a new gong. The gong is then refined, cleaned, and properly identified by <b>the</b> <b>blacksmith</b> (pandáy). Finally, the gongs are refined using the tongkol process, tuning these either by hammering the boss from the inside to slightly raise its pitch, or by hammering the boss from the outside to lower the pitch. The correct tuning is found by ear, with players striking a sequence of gongs, looking for a melodic contour they are familiar with.|$|E

40|$|Blacksmithing in Benin City, Nigeria is of {{significant}} antiquity. The popularity {{and importance of}} the practice in the city is reinforced in <b>the</b> <b>blacksmiths</b> guild's attachment to the palace of the Oba, the traditional ruler of Benin people and their kingdom. This study examined the shift in paradigms and emerging trends in the practice. Based {{on the study of}} <b>the</b> <b>blacksmiths</b> and their products over a period of fourteen years, the study determined how <b>the</b> <b>blacksmiths</b> have responded to modern challenges. Findings indicate that a good number of <b>the</b> <b>blacksmiths</b> are multi-skilled in metal working and that they work with metals, other than iron, and employ modern tools and methodologies which were originally not traditional to blacksmithing.   The study also classified the blacksmiths’ products, most of which were also not traditional to their craft, into five categories: household utensils, farming implements, musical instruments, religious artefacts and decorative objects. </p...|$|R

5|$|Kratos {{continues}} his ascent, murdering powerful foes {{that include the}} Titan Perses and the god Helios, which causes the sun to disappear, plunging the world into eternal darkness.

Kratos discovers that Pandora's Box is in the Flame of Olympus and {{is key to the}} success of his quest, as it was in God of War. Athena appears, telling Kratos that the flames around the box can only be quelled by Pandora. Kratos then continues after the overconfident Hermes, whom he catches and kills, releasing a plague. At the Forum, he has an audience with the drunken Hera, who ignores his request for Pandora's location and summons Hercules. After discussing his jealousy of his half-brother, Hercules attacks Kratos and is killed. Kratos then encounters Aphrodite, who is indifferent to his war on Olympus. She then leads him to her estranged husband Hephaestus through Hyperion's Gate, a teleportation device. In a suicide mission, <b>the</b> <b>blacksmith</b> sends Kratos to Tartarus to retrieve the Omphalos Stone so he can forge a new weapon for the Spartan. Kratos finds Cronos, kills the Titan for the stone, and returns to Hephaestus. After forging the weapon, the god tries to kill Kratos himself. Instead, the Spartan kills Hephaestus, who claims {{that he was trying to}} protect his daughter Pandora, who was imprisoned in the Labyrinth after Kratos opened her box. Reusing the Hyperion Gate, the Spartan travels through Hera's Gardens where he kills the taunting goddess, ending all plant life, and makes his way to the Labyrinth to find Pandora.|$|E
