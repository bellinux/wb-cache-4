25|$|Barbiturates {{induce a}} number of hepatic CYP enzymes (most notably CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4), leading to exaggerated effects from many prodrugs and {{decreased}} effects from drugs which are metabolized by these enzymes to inactive metabolites. This can result in fatal overdoses from drugs such as codeine, tramadol, and carisoprodol, which become considerably more potent after being metabolized by CYP enzymes. Although all known {{members of the class}} possess relevant enzyme induction capabilities the degree of inhibition overall as well as the impact on each specific enzyme span a broad range with phenobarbital and secobarbital being the most potent enzyme inducers and butalbital and <b>talbutal</b> being among the weakest enzyme inducers in the class.|$|E
50|$|<b>Talbutal</b> (Lotusate) is a {{barbiturate}} with a {{short to}} intermediate duration of action. It is a structural isomer of butalbital. <b>Talbutal</b> is a schedule III drug in the U.S.|$|E

50|$|<b>Talbutal</b> binds at a {{distinct}} binding site {{associated with a}} Cl− ionopore at the GABAA receptor, increasing the duration of time for which the Cl− ionopore is open. The post-synaptic inhibitory effect of GABA in the thalamus is, therefore, prolonged.|$|E
50|$|<b>Talbutal</b> is a {{short to}} intermediate-acting barbiturate. Barbiturates act as nonselective {{depressants}} of {{the central nervous system}} (CNS), capable of producing all levels of CNS mood alteration from excitation to mild sedation, hypnosis, and deep coma. In sufficiently high therapeutic doses, barbiturates induce anesthesia.|$|E
50|$|Butalbital is a {{barbiturate}} with {{an intermediate}} duration of action. Butalbital is often {{combined with other}} medications, such as acetaminophen (paracetamol) or aspirin, and is commonly prescribed {{for the treatment of}} pain and headache. The various formulations combined with codeine are FDA-approved for the treatment of tension headaches. Butalbital has the same chemical formula as <b>talbutal</b> but a different structure—one that presents as 5-allyl-5-isobutylbarbituric acid.|$|E

40|$|A {{high-performance}} liquid chromatographic (HPLC) assay for {{the identification}} and quantification of barbiturates in blood at therapeutic levels has been developed. An ODS-silica column is used with an eluent of 40 % methanol at pH 8. 5. The barbiturates are detected at 240 nm. The sample preparation procedure involves extraction of unfractionated blood (100 1) with hexane—diethyl ether (50 : 50, v/v) and is very rapid. <b>Talbutal</b> is used as an internal standard. The method {{has been applied to}} the determination of five barbiturates (amylobarbitone, butobarbitone, cyclobarbitone, pentobarbitone and quinalbarbitone) in blood after therapeutic doses of the drugs. An application of the HPLC assay to forensic casework is demonstrated. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E
