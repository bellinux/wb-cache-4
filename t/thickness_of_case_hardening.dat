40|$|The {{development}} of an effective ceramic conversion treatment of TIMETAL LCB (Ti- 6. 8 Mo- 4. 5 Fe- 1. 5 Al) has been investigated. Various characterisation methods were used to analyse samples {{in order to identify}} the best process conditions including SEM, EDX, XRD, GDS, micro-indentation and scratch testing. A solution treatment temperature of 850 °C was used as this is the appropriate temperature for the mechanism of solution treatment according to the β-transus temperature of this alloy. The results show that a solution treatment of 0. 5 hours produces an acceptable <b>thickness</b> <b>of</b> oxygen <b>hardened</b> <b>case,</b> an almost equal hardness to that of a longer treatment and a far better oxide layer, than a longer treatment time did, in terms of adherence to the substrate. An aging temperature of 500 °C was found to be the best as a lower temperature than this produced too thin an oxide layer and a higher temperature meant the oxide layer became exceedingly brittle. An aging time of 8 hours was found to be best as this gave good hardness, good performance in both static and dynamic loading and good wear resistance. The wear testing results show that the tribological properties of the TIMETAL LCB alloy have been significantly enhanced by the new ceramic conversion treatment specifically developed for beta alloys.

40|$|The overall aim of {{this study}} is to {{establish}} knowledge about how the material specification <b>of</b> <b>case</b> <b>hardening</b> steel should be modified in order to create a robust and predictable production process with focus on machinability. In this study, emphasis is laid on studying microstructure variations produced by changing holding time and temperature in the annealing process. A standardized milling test was used to assess machinability (with respect to tool wear) as this method has the advantage of only needing small diametrical samples and low material volumes. From the results of the test, it can be concluded that machinability is more influenced by pearlite nodular size than by pearlite morphology.

Applications range from simple mild steel pressings to heavy-duty alloy-steel transmission components. The characteristics <b>of</b> <b>case</b> <b>hardening</b> are the surface hardness, effective case depth, and depth profile of the residual stress.

The <b>case</b> <b>hardening</b> process produces a change in the electromagnetic properties of the steel components in the near surface region. Consequently, the electrical conductivity and magnetic permeability have different values near the surface compared with those of the substrate. It is assumed that the conductivity and permeability variation with depth is indicative of the hardness profile allowing the case depth to be estimated from electromagnetic measurements. A two-layer model is adopted to approximate the <b>case</b> <b>hardened</b> steel parts as a homogeneous substrate layer surrounded by a homogeneous surface layer with uniform thickness.

However, material batches showing a decreased machinability often have properties within the material specification. Thus, for an increased machinability and a more robust production <b>of</b> <b>case</b> <b>hardening</b> steel parts, the relationship between microstructure and machinability needs to be further investigated. In this study, machinability has been evaluated for a specific <b>case</b> <b>hardening</b> steel with respect to pearlite nodular size, phase distribution and interlamellar spacing of pearlite.

Furthermore, a comparison of cutting forces and surface integrity for the tested microstructures will be presented. The results from tests show a difference between material with larger pearlite nodules and a material with smaller pearlite nodules.

40|$|Considering the {{processing}} <b>of</b> <b>case</b> <b>hardening</b> steel components, the machining {{as well as}} the heat treatment offer great capability for cost savings. By increasing the carburising temperature from today approximately 940 °C up to e. g. 1050 °C significant process time reductions are achievable due to the acceleration of diffusion and absorption processes. While increasing the carburising temperature, the appearance of prohibited coarse austenite grains has to be avoided. However the former austenite grain size is an attribute of the overall process chain from steel melting to <b>case</b> <b>hardening.</b> In this work, the influence of the manufacturing process on grain size stability <b>of</b> <b>case</b> <b>hardening</b> steels has been investigated. To simulate the hot forming process in laboratory scale compression tests (Rastegaev samples) have been performed to different standard steel grades (16 MnCr 5 / 20 NiCrMo 2) as well as two micro-alloyed (16 MnCr 5 Nb / 20 NiCrMo 2 Nb) steel grades. An increase in grain size stability during carburising simply depends on the size of precipitates.

The reason is the overall good properties of steels, with its high strength and hardness, high ductility, high formability and relatively low cost compared to other materials. Even though armour steels are affordable, work is done to limit expenses from production or {{come up with new}} and less expensive alloys. <b>Case</b> <b>hardening</b> is a technique for production of steel with a very hard and durable surface while still maintaining a tough and ductile core. <b>Case</b> <b>hardened</b> products have hard, durable and fatigue resistant surfaces and tough and durable cores. <b>Case</b> <b>hardening</b> is typically applied to machine parts that are exposed to heavy wear and high loads such as gears, bearings, screws and nuts, shafts, etc	In 2010, Lou et al. managed to significantly increase the penetration resistance of a low-cost steel (NVE 36) by <b>case</b> <b>hardening.</b> Encouraged by this, Hans Magne Thorseth wrote his master s thesis Optimalisering av stål i beskyttelseskonstruksjoner in 2010. His attempt to improve the ballistic strength of Hardox 450 steel by <b>case</b> <b>hardening</b> did not have the desired results. The ballistic limit velocity was reduced from approximately 800 m/s for the original Hardox 450 to approximately 770 m/s for the <b>case</b> <b>hardened</b> steel. The probable reasons for the reduction of the ballistic limit velocity was a too low carbon content increase from the carburizing and thus a too low hardness increase, in addition to deterioration of the metal core properties from the heat treatment. The objective of this master s thesis was to improve the <b>case</b> <b>hardening</b> process used by Hans Magne Thorseth in his master s thesis. The improvement work was divided into two parts, a preliminary project work and this master thesis. The project was carried out in the autumn of 2010, and the aim was to find the optimum <b>case</b> <b>hardening</b> process to produce steel with improved ballistic properties. This involved testing of different carburizing potentials to increase the surface carbon content of the metal and to find carburizing heat treatments that would retain the core properties of the carburized steel. Based on the results from the preliminary project it seemed possible to produce <b>case</b> <b>hardened</b> steel with surface hardness over 1000 HV, but a slight reduction of core hardness was difficult to avoid. The present master s thesis was written during the spring of 2011. The key results from the preliminary project work were used to determine a range <b>of</b> <b>case</b> <b>hardening</b> courses. A total <b>of</b> 11 <b>case</b> <b>hardening</b> courses were tested, of which six courses employed carbon potential of 0. 9 % and five courses employed a carbon potential of 1. 1 %. Different hardening courses were tested, including direct hardening, a modified single hardening process and traditional and modified versions of double and triple <b>hardening.</b> Before the <b>case</b> <b>hardening</b> the plates were sandblasted to remove a corrosion-resistant primer that was applied to the plates. The primer was believed to limit the diffusion of carbon into the steel. In the preliminary project the primer was ground away and grinding was the preferred solution in this work as well, however, due to capacity issues sandblasting was employed. The ballistic limit velocity <b>of</b> the <b>case</b> <b>hardened</b> and the original Hardox 450 target plates were calculated from results obtained by ballistic experiments. The ballistic limit velocities <b>of</b> the <b>case</b> <b>hardened</b> samples, with approximately 787 m/s as the highest, were lower than that of the original Hardox 450, being approximately 800 m/s. 	Surface hardness measurements of the steel revealed a poor effect from the carburization, the hardest surface was measured at 735 HV. This could be explained by a probable surface decarburization of the original Hardox 450, which was discovered by microstructure examinations and hardness measurements. In contrary to in the preliminary project where this layer was ground away, the sandblasting did not remove the decarburized layer. Due to this, the <b>case</b> <b>hardening</b> did not have the desired effect on the steel surface, resulting in a too low surface hardness. 	The core hardness proved difficult to retain, the highest core hardness value obtained was below 460 HV, compared to the original Hardox 450 with core hardness of 475 HV. This could be another reason for the lower ballistic limit velocity of the carburized steel plates. However, the original Hardox 450 did not have the highest cross-sectional hardness integral value, so the ballistic properties probably also depend to some degree on ductility. A main reason for the superior ballistic limit velocity of the original Hardox 450 was therefore believed to be related to cracking of the rear side <b>of</b> the <b>case</b> <b>hardened</b> target plates during projectile penetration. The cracking seemed to be a result of the harder, and thus more brittle, outer surface layer...|$|R

In this study, emphasis is laid on studying the effect of microstructure variations on machinability in <b>case</b> <b>hardening</b> steels. Different microstructures have been produced by changing holding time and temperature in the annealing process. The microstructure was altered {{as much as possible}} with respect to pearlite nodular size, pearlite morphology and amount of pro-eutectoid ferrite.

Also, the influence of manganese sulfide on machinability has been investigated. The microstructural investigation of the chips has shown that there is a clear difference in the deformation behavior between a <b>case</b> <b>hardening</b> steel with larger and smaller pearlite nodular structure. Chips from the material with larger pearlite nodular size and lower amount of pro-eutectoid ferrite are by far more segmented as compared to chips from materials with smaller pearlite nodular size...|$|R
40|$|For <b>case</b> <b>hardening</b> steel, the {{relationship}} between microstructure and machinability is investigated. To {{be able to determine}} the influence of morphology, i. e. grain size, phase distribution and interlamellar spacing in pearlite, homogeneous material is required. However, a homogeneous microstructure can only be guaranteed when small material volumes are used. For that reason the Volvo Standard Machinability Test has been applied, as it allows ranking of materials with respect to their machinability by removing only small amounts of material (~ 800 mm of a bar with 50 mm diameter for each material). In addition to what is described in the standard of the test, a number of observations and experiences have been made. In this article the observations in connection with the Volvo Standard Machinability Test are critically discussed. Furthermore, the results of the machinability test <b>of</b> the <b>case</b> <b>hardening</b> steels are presented...|$|R
