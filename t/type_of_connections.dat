It {{is possible to}} obtain the IP addresses of all current and possibly previous participants in a swarm from the tracker. This may expose users with insecure systems to attacks. It may also, in rare cases, expose users {{to the risk of}} being sued, if they are distributing files without permission from the copyright holder(s). However, there are ways to promote anonymity; for example, the OneSwarm project layers privacy-preserving sharing mechanisms on top of the original BitTorrent protocol. A moderate degree of anonymity, enough to keep ISPs from giving the user trouble at least, can be achieved with seedboxes such as Bitport, put.io, or Seedr, which download the torrent files first to the companies' servers, followed by a direct download to the user. Torrents can be downloaded {{with a high degree of}} anonymity by using services such as i2p. Tor does not provide anonymity on BitTorrent, and its use is also discouraged (by blocking this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>connections)</b> for performance reasons. Unlike Tor, i2p is designed to work with BitTorrent However, with i2p, torrents can only be downloaded from within the i2p network. This can be useful for users trying to avoid copyright complaints from their ISPs, maintaining privacy, or avoiding censorship.|$|E

Understanding the viability of these connections in practice, AISC (2001, 2010) adopted top- and seat-angle connections into the design specifications to transfer only the beam-shear force to the column. However, experimental evidences and the author’s past studies on the connections exposed that besides transferring beam-shear force, this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>connections</b> transferred fairly significant beam-end-moment to the column. When transferring the moment through the top angle to the column, an increase in tensile force occurred in the bolts due to local deformation of the top angle’s vertical leg. This additional tensile force {{is commonly known as}} prying force. A few researchers have paid serious attention to this additional force in their mathematical representation of connection behaviour. The most recent stiffness modelling technique that includes individual elements behaviour reformed in equivalent T-stub connection model for both extended end plate connections and angle <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>connections</b> following the modelling technique of Weynand et al. (1995) has been adopted in Eurocode 3 (CEN 2005). However, the T-stub model is somehow different in respect to interaction with the actual deformation pattern of true angle <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>connections</b> at failure and may loose its efficiency in estimation of connection strength. So, precise understanding about interaction among connection components on moment–rotation behaviour is required to represent a straightforward and accurate mechanical model of the connection.|$|E

The proposed method determines the <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>connections</b> by examining the nodes' interaction. Determination inaccuracy caused by different reactive time scales between nodes is addressed by using wavelet analysis. After the network signals are decomposed into signals at different scales, the most prominent scale of each signal is obtained through energy comparison, and then is utilized to calculate connectivity indices which determine the existence and <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>connections</b> between nodes. The algorithm developed from the method is tested by applying to a simulated ErbB signaling cascade model...|$|R
30|$|In the AISC-ASD specifications, top- and seat-angle {{connections}} {{are treated as}} connections intended only for transferring beam shear force. However, experimental evidence and the present study on the connections show that besides transferring beam shear force, this type of connection transfers fairly considerable beam end moment to the column. When transferring this moment through the top angle to the column, an increase in tensile force is incurred in the bolts due to local deformation of the top angle’s vertical leg. This additional tensile force {{is commonly known as}} the prying force (Q in Fig.  4). Recently, researchers have paid serious attention to this additional force in their mathematical representation of connection behavior. Initially, the T-stub modeling concept has been used for designing extended end plate connections and modified for use to design angle <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>connections</b> (Faella et al. 1996; CEN 1997). However, the T-stub model is not accurate enough to represent actual deformation pattern of true angle <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>connections</b> at failure, and may not correctly estimate the connection strength.|$|E
