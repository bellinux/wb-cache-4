500|$|<b>The</b> <b>canvassing</b> {{is largely}} unsuccessful. [...] Most of the {{supporters}} of the park say {{they will not be}} able to attend the meeting. [...] Mark, April and Tom speak with one seemingly interested resident, who is implied to be a pedophile. [...] Leslie becomes frustrated with the lack of success and attempts to push poll the community residents. [...] She suggests phrasing the question, [...] "Wouldn't you rather have a park than a storage facility for nuclear waste?" [...] Tom leaves <b>the</b> <b>canvassing</b> group to call prospective contractors about the park project, hinting at accepting bribes and making corrupt deals. [...] Several residents express a lack of support for the park. [...] Resident Kate Speevak (Lennon Parham) vows to attend the public meeting and voice her disapproval after a frustrated Leslie says, [...] "You don't care about your kids if you don't support this park". [...] <b>The</b> <b>canvassing</b> ends with an angry Leslie finding Mark and April playing Rock Band with Ann's boyfriend, Andy Dwyer (Chris Pratt) at Ann's house.|$|E
500|$|During <b>the</b> <b>canvassing,</b> Leslie {{says she}} may {{resort to the}} tactics of Karl Rove, advisor to former President George W. Bush, in phrasing her {{questions}} to guarantee positive responses. Leslie refers to Andy as [...] "a cute FDR", a reference to former President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Leslie says her mother is as respected as charity worker Mother Teresa, as powerful as Soviet Union dictator Joseph Stalin and as beautiful as British politician Margaret Thatcher. A PDF copy of the town hall meeting flyer was posted on NBC's official Parks and Recreation website about Pawnee, Indiana; it included before-and-after pictures of the proposed park.|$|E
500|$|Leslie {{tries to}} get her boss Ron Swanson (Nick Offerman) to {{postpone}} the town hall meeting, but Ron says he cannot because the town manager Paul Iaresco (Phil Reeves) has [...] "fast-tracked" [...] the project. [...] As the meeting begins, Leslie notices her mother has attended after all, along {{with many of the}} people critical of the project. [...] Led by Kate Speevak, the crowd says they do not support the proposal and are angry an environmental study has not been conducted. [...] Leslie tries to pretend April is a supportive resident, but one of the audience members recognizes her from <b>the</b> <b>canvassing.</b>|$|E

Almost all election canvassing includes asking how a person plans to vote. Supporters will then be asked themselves to volunteer, or to take a lawn sign. Those who are wavering or undecided may be given a message of persuasion. If foot <b>canvassing,</b> <b>the</b> <b>canvasser</b> will also distribute flyers.|$|R
500|$|In 1892, {{following}} <b>the</b> <b>canvassing</b> {{of provincial}} administrators by Ernest Hoben, the New Zealand Rugby Football Union (NZRFU) {{was formed by}} the majority of New Zealand's provincial unions, but did not include Canterbury, Otago or Southland. The first officially sanctioned New Zealand side toured New South Wales in 1893, where the Thomas Ellison captained team won nine of their ten matches. The following year New Zealand played its first home [...] "international" [...] game, losing 8–6 to New South Wales. The team's first true test match occurred against Australia on 15 August 1903 at the Sydney Cricket Ground in front of over 30,000 spectators, and resulted in a 22–3 victory.|$|E
500|$|All outdoor {{canvassing}} {{scenes were}} {{shot in a}} neighborhood of Los Angeles, California, outside the Parks and Recreation studio. Michael Schur {{said they wanted to}} establish the type of groundwork public servants often had to conduct in a small town. Seth Gordon sought to make <b>the</b> <b>canvassing</b> scenes as realistic as possible, so he allowed a large amount of improvisation among the actors. The Pawnee residents who are vocally opposed to parks were based on real-life California residents the Parks and Recreation producers encountered who opposed the construction of parks in their hometown. One such group, [...] "The Committee for a Better Park", was actually a group of residents opposed to parks in general, and the deceptiveness of their name and mission inspired the Parks producers while writing [...] "Canvassing".|$|E
500|$|Lennon Parham, {{an actress}} and comedian {{who worked with}} Amy Poehler on the Upright Citizens Brigade sketch comedy troupe, made a guest {{appearance}} in [...] "Canvassing" [...] as Kate Speevak. Michael Schur said {{early on in the}} brainstorming process, the Parks and Recreation producers decided to establish an antagonist for Leslie named Kate Speevak, simply because they thought the name was funny. Seth Gordon said Poehler and Parham worked especially well together during their largely improvised scenes, which he attributed to their past work together on the Upright Citizens Brigade. [...] The resident who appeared to be a sex offender during <b>the</b> <b>canvassing</b> was played by Brian Huskey, who Schur called a [...] "fantastic improviser". Eric Edelstein portrayed Lawrence, a resident who antagonizes Leslie and Andy during the public meeting. Edelstein was not originally the actor assigned the [...] "Hey parks lady, you suck" [...] line, but the Parks and Recreation producers like Edelstein so much they gave it to him. Leslie's response line, [...] "Hear that? He called me park lady", was improvised by Poehler.|$|E
6000|$|The {{neighbours}} cut up rough, {{and made}} complaints; but Mr. Magsman don't {{know what they}} would have had. It was a lovely thing. First of all, there was <b>the</b> <b>canvass,</b> representin <b>the</b> picter of the Giant, in Spanish trunks and a ruff, who was himself half the heighth of the house, and was run up with a line and pulley to a pole on the roof, so that his Ed was coeval with the parapet. Then, there was <b>the</b> <b>canvass,</b> representin <b>the</b> picter of the Albina lady, showing her white air to the Army and Navy in correct uniform. Then, there was <b>the</b> <b>canvass,</b> representin <b>the</b> picter of the Wild Indian a scalpin a member of some foreign nation. Then, there was <b>the</b> <b>canvass,</b> representin <b>the</b> picter of a child of a British Planter, seized by two Boa Constrictors--not that we never had no child, nor no Constrictors neither. Similarly, there was <b>the</b> <b>canvass,</b> representin <b>the</b> picter of the Wild Ass of the Prairies--not that we never had no wild asses, nor wouldn't have had 'em at a gift. Last, there was <b>the</b> <b>canvass,</b> representin <b>the</b> picter of the Dwarf, and like him too (considerin), with George the Fourth in such a state of astonishment at him as His Majesty couldn't with his utmost politeness and stoutness express. The front of the House was so covered with canvasses, that there wasn't a spark of daylight ever visible on that side. [...] "MAGSMAN'S AMUSEMENTS," [...] fifteen foot long by two foot high, ran over the front door and parlour winders. The passage was a Arbour of green baize and gardenstuff. A barrel-organ performed there unceasing. And as to respectability,--if threepence ain't respectable, what is? ...|$|R

2500|$|Councillor Jane Pitfield, who {{was running}} for Mayor, criticized the proposal, stating that [...] "From <b>the</b> <b>canvassing</b> I have done all over the city, the {{majority}} of people say they want the Gardiner to stay where it is." [...] Suburban councillors Gloria Lindsay Luby and Doug Holyday came out opposed while inner-city councillor Kyle Rae fought for the proposal. Mayor David Miller did not favour the proposal either, stating that there were other, higher priorities. The proposal did not come to Council for discussion and vote.|$|E
2500|$|With the Labour Party in power, {{and many}} Labour members {{becoming}} disillusioned, IS started doing more {{work that was}} external to the Labour Party; it ceased to practise 'entryism' as a tactic around 1965. After 1967, few IS members were active in that party. In 1965, an article in Labour Worker said [...] "Obviously Marxists should take those positions which give access to the direct workers’ organisations. But in the wards and GMCs the practice of buying the right to discuss politics by over-fulfilling <b>the</b> <b>canvassing</b> norms, should cease or be reduced to the minimum." ...|$|E

50|$|The party affiliations {{follow the}} vote on the contested {{election}} of John Livingston. The Democratic-Republicans voted to seat Livingston, affirming that the decision of <b>the</b> <b>Canvass</b> Committee was final for both the governor's and the senators' vote. The Federalists voted against this, supporting the claim of Thomas Jenkins, the Federalist candidate who had lost the election after {{the rejection of the}} ballots from Clinton County, affirming that under the Constitution it was the right and duty of the Senate to revise the decision of <b>the</b> <b>Canvass</b> Committee concerning <b>the</b> election of senators.|$|R
60|$|There was a sorrowful {{scene when}} the Judge read {{for the first}} time Bradley's letter of {{withdrawal}} from <b>the</b> <b>canvass.</b> <b>The</b> Judge was deeply hurt because he had not been consulted, and was depressed by Bradley's despair. He tried to reason with him, but Bradley was in no mood to reason.|$|R
2500|$|The main crux of {{contention}} during <b>the</b> <b>canvassing</b> for the COCs transmitted electronically {{was the issue}} of null votes, i.e. overvotes, undervotes, abstentions, and votes were not tallied in CoCs because of incomplete transmission. The Aquino-Roxas Bantay Balota (ARBB, [...] "Aquino-Roxas ballot watch") said that 3 million votes were considered null votes, and 10-15% of votes from Roxas' strongholds in Western Visayas and Central Visayas were wasted. In addition, according to them, if to 50-60% of the votes were for Roxas, he would've lost 250,000-300,000 votes. ARBB did not question null votes for the presidential election, where Aquino is leading. The commission, however, said that the nullified votes are the equivalent of [...] "stray votes" [...] before automation, and that rules on stray or null votes would apply even if votes were manually counted in an electoral protest, chairman Jose Melo said.|$|E
2500|$|On May 26, all Commission on Elections commissioners, Smartmatic {{executives}} {{and information technology}} experts where present before the joint canvassing committee. The Congressmen asked the commissioners {{on the matter of}} [...] "two" [...] separate certificates of canvass (COC) for the positions of president and vice president. Dilangalen remarked that in the 2004 election, there was only one COC for both positions; Commissioner Larrazabal replied that each COC, although printed in several pages, is one document, with Chairman Jose Melo adding that there is a separate COC per position per province. Arthur Defensor asked if this meant Congress should canvass the COCs separately, with Nograles replying that will be up for <b>the</b> <b>canvassing</b> committee to decide that. Other issues tackled the lack of digital signatures in the election returns, and the erroneous number of registered voters in the Smartmatic database ("256, 733, 195") when Enrile opened the server. Smartmatic president for Asia-Pacific Cesar Flores replied to Enrile that the erroneous figure was an error in the application [...] "that was adding the number of registered voters from the PCOS [...] from the precinct level and it was adding the number of registered voters from the municipal level…and from the province…Therefore, multiplying the number of registered voters", and that only voter turnout and not the results for all positions will be affected.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>canvass</b> {{committee}} disagreed {{on whether}} to allow these ballots to be counted or not. The question was referred to the United States Senators from New York, Federalist Rufus King and Democratic-Republican Aaron Burr, for arbitration. King said all votes ought to be canvassed, Burr said that the ballots from Clinton County ought to be allowed, the ones from Otsego and Tioga counties should be rejected. Thereupon, a majority of <b>the</b> <b>canvass</b> committee (Gelston, Tillotson, Smith, Graham, Van Cortlandt, McCarty, Havens) rejected the ballots from all three counties and declared George Clinton duly elected governor {{by a majority of}} 108 votes.|$|R
