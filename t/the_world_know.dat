Although Milk had not come out to his mother before her death many years before, in his final statement during his taped prediction of his assassination, he urged others to do so: I cannot prevent anyone from getting angry, or mad, or frustrated. I can only hope that they'll turn that anger and frustration and madness into something positive, so that two, three, four, five hundred will step forward, so the gay doctors will come out, the gay lawyers, the gay judges, gay bankers, gay architects... I hope that every professional gay will say 'enough', come forward and tell everybody, wear a sign, let <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>know.</b> Maybe that will help.|$|E

25|$|When a young Roman {{inadvertently}} {{fell through}} a cleft in the Esquiline hillside {{at the end}} of the 15th century, he found himself in a strange cave or grotta filled with painted figures. Soon the young artists of Rome were having themselves let down on boards knotted to ropes to see for themselves. The fourth style frescoes that were uncovered then have faded to pale gray stains on the plaster now, but the effect of these freshly rediscovered grottesche decorations was electrifying in the early Renaissance, which was just arriving in Rome. When Pinturicchio, Raphael and Michelangelo crawled underground and were let down shafts to study them, carving their names on the walls to let <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>know</b> they had been there, the paintings were a revelation of the true world of antiquity. Beside the graffiti signatures of later tourists, like Casanova and the Marquis de Sade scratched into a fresco inches apart (British Archaeology June 1999), are the autographs of Domenico Ghirlandaio, Martin van Heemskerck, and Filippino Lippi.|$|E

500|$|Colt {{historian}} William Edwards {{wrote that}} Caroline Henshaw married Samuel Colt in Scotland when Colt {{met her in}} Europe and that the son she bore was Samuel Colt's and not John Colt's. In a 1953 biography about Samuel Colt based largely on family letters, Edwards wrote that John's marriage to Caroline {{was a way to}} legitimize her son, Sammy. [...] Samuel Colt had abandoned her because he felt she was not fit to be the wife of an industrialist and divorce was a social stigma at the time. [...] Samuel Colt took care of the child named Samuel Caldwell Colt financially with a large allowance and paid for his tuition in what was described as [...] "the finest private schools". [...] In correspondence with and about his namesake, Samuel Colt referred to him as his [...] "nephew" [...] in quotes. [...] Historians such as Edwards and Harold Schechter have said this was the elder Colt's way of letting <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>know</b> that the boy was his own son without directly saying so. After Samuel Colt's death in 1862, he left the boy $2 million by 2010 standards. [...] Colt's widow, Elizabeth Jarvis Colt, and her brother contested this. [...] In probate Caroline's son Sam produced a valid marriage license showing that Caroline and Samuel Colt were married in Scotland in 1838 and that this document made him a rightful heir to part of Colt's estate, if not to the Colt Manufacturing Company.|$|E

500|$|On Janet, Jackson began {{focusing}} on sexual themes. Shayne Lee, author of Erotic Revolutionaries: Black Women, Sexuality, and Popular Culture (2010), wrote that her music {{over the following}} decade [...] "brand her {{as one of the}} most sexually stimulating vocalists of the 1990s." [...] In You've Come A Long Way, Baby: Women, Politics, and Popular Culture (1996), Lilly J. Goren observed [...] "Jackson's evolution from politically aware musician to sexy diva marked the direction that society and the music industry were encouraging the dance-rock divas to pursue." [...] The Washington Post declared Jackson's public image over the course of her career had shifted [...] "from innocence to experience, inspiring such carnal albums as 1993's 'Janet' and 1997's 'The Velvet Rope', the latter of which explored the bonds—figuratively and literally—of love and lust." [...] The song [...] "Free Xone" [...] from The Velvet Rope, which portrays same-sex relationships in a positive light, is described by sociologist Shayne Lee as [...] "a rare incident in which a popular black vocalist explores romantic or sensual energy outside the contours of heteronormativity, making it a significant song in black sexual politics." [...] During promotion for Janet, she stated [...] "I love feeling deeply sexual—and don't mind letting <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>know.</b> For me, sex has become a celebration, a joyful part of the creative process." [...] Upon the release of Damita Jo, Jackon stated [...] "Beginning with the earlier albums, exploring—and liberating—my sexuality has been an ongoing discovery and theme," [...] adding [...] "As an artist, that's not only my passion, it's my obligation." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine has found Jackson's consistent inclusion of sex in her music lacking ingenuity, especially in comparisons to other artists such as Prince, stating [...] "while sex indisputably fuels much great pop music, it isn't an inherently fascinating topic for pop music—as with anything, it all depends on the artist." ...|$|E

The only two survivors were Ambassador Máximo Cajal López and peasant Gregorio Yuja Xona, who were taken to the Private Hospital Herrera Llerandi. Yuja was kidnapped there and a group tried to kidnap the ambassador, but he was taken from the hospital just in time by the Ambassador of Costa Rica in Guatemala; Cajal left the country that night. Yuja, meanwhile, was tortured and his body thrown off the premises of the President mansion at the University of San Carlos. His body was buried in the Heroes and Martyrs Plaza on Central Campus.|$|E
