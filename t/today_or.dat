5|$|In a 2006 Icelandic Radio interview, Fischer {{explained}} {{his reasons for}} advocating Fischerandom Chess:In chess so much depends on opening theory, so the champions before the last century did not {{know as much as}} I do and other players do about opening theory. So if you just brought them back from the dead they wouldn't do well. They'd get bad openings. You cannot compare the playing strength, you can only talk about natural ability. Memorisation is enormously powerful. Some kid of fourteen <b>today,</b> <b>or</b> even younger, could get an opening advantage against Capablanca, and especially against the players of the previous century, like Morphy and Steinitz. Maybe they would still be able to outplay the young kid of <b>today.</b> <b>Or</b> maybe not, because nowadays when you get the opening advantage not only do you get the opening advantage, you know how to play, they have so many examples of what to do from this position... and that is why I don't like chess any more... It is all just memorization and prearrangement...|$|E

25|$|Spiridonov was {{the first}} to begin {{referring}} to the new system with a name similar to 'sambo'. He eventually developed a softer style called Samoz that could be used by smaller, weaker practitioners or even wounded soldiers and secret agents. Spiridonov's inspiration to develop 'Samoz' stemmed from his World War I bayonet injury, which greatly restricted his (left arm and thus his) ability to practice wrestle. Refined versions of sambo are still used <b>today</b> <b>or</b> fused with specific sambo applications {{to meet the needs of}} Russian commandos today.|$|E
25|$|It {{follows that}} if one has to choose between {{receiving}} $100 today and $100 in one year, the rational decision is to cash the $100 today. If the money is to be received in one year and assuming the savings account interest rate is 5%, the person has to be offered at least $105 in one year so that two options are equivalent (either receiving $100 <b>today</b> <b>or</b> receiving $105 in one year). This is because if you have cash of $100 today and deposit in your savings account, you will have $105 in one year.|$|E

25|$|Fifth, {{the holders}} of a {{floating}} charge holders must be paid. Like a fixed charge, a floating charge {{can be created}} by a contract with a company before insolvency. Like with a fixed charge, this is usually done {{in return for a}} loan from a bank. But unlike a fixed charge, a floating charge need not refer to a specific asset of the company. It can cover the entire business, including a fluctuating body of assets that is traded with day <b>today,</b> <b>or</b> assets that a company will receive in future. The preferential categories were created by statute to prevent secured creditors taking all assets away. This reflected the view that the power of freedom of contract should be limited to protect employees, small businesses or consumers who have unequal bargaining power. After funds are taken away to pay all preferential groups and the holder of a floating charge, the remaining money due to unsecured creditors. In 2001 recovery rates were found to be 53% of one's debt for secured lenders, 35% for preferential creditors but only 7% for unsecured creditors on average. Seventh comes any money due for interest on debts proven in the winding up process. In eighth place is money due to company members under a share redemption contract. Ninth are debts due to members who hold preferential rights. And tenth, ordinary shareholders, have the right to residual assets.|$|E

500|$|However, in R v. Hill and Hall (1989), the Court of Appeal {{introduced}} an objective element to part (b) of the defence. The defendants {{had been convicted}} of possession of a hacksaw blade outside a US naval base in Wales, having admitted an intention to use the blade to cut through the base's perimeter fence. They claimed a lawful excuse in that they had acted to protect their own property located near the base; their reasoning was that the base would {{at some point in the}} future attract a nuclear attack by the Soviet Union. Given that Hill was [...] "forced to admit that she did not expect a nuclear bomb to fall <b>today</b> <b>or</b> tomorrow", the Court concluded that this threat to property was too remote and thus the defence had not been made out, however honest the belief had been.|$|E
500|$|On September 2, 2008, {{a record}} store in France began selling copies of Death Magnetic {{nearly two weeks}} before its {{scheduled}} worldwide release date, {{which resulted in the}} album being made available on peer-to-peer clients. This prompted the band's UK distributor Vertigo Records to officially release the album on September 10, 2008. Rumors of Metallica or Warner Bros. taking legal action against the French retailer were unconfirmed, though drummer Lars Ulrich [...] responded to the leak by saying, [...] "...We're ten days from release.

500|$|Discussion has {{centered}} on such themes as the conflict between modern human and nature, and the film's treatment of imperialism, racism, militarism and patriotism, corporate greed, property rights, spirituality and religion. [...] Commentators have debated whether the film's treatment of the human aggression against the native Na'vi is a message of support for indigenous peoples <b>today,</b> <b>or</b> is, instead, a tired retelling of the racist myth of the noble savage. [...] Right-wing critics accused Cameron of pushing an [...] "anti-American" [...] message in the film's depiction of a private military contractor that used ex-Marines to attack the natives, while Cameron and others argued that it is pro-American to question the propriety of the current wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. [...] The visual similarity between {{the destruction of the}} World Trade Center and the felling of Home Tree in the film caused some filmgoers to further identify with the Na'vi and to identify the human military contractors as terrorists. [...] Critics asked whether this comparison was intended to encourage audiences to empathize with the position of Muslims under military occupation today.|$|E

500|$|Hutchinson {{described}} Steiger's {{mother as}} [...] "plump, energetic and small, with long auburn hair". She {{had a good}} singing voice and nearly became a Hollywood actress, but after a leg surgery permanently impaired her walking ability, she gave up acting and turned to alcohol. As a result, she quit show business and moved away from Westhampton to raise her son. They moved through several towns, including Irvington and Bloomfield, before settling in Newark, New Jersey. Her alcoholism caused Steiger much embarrassment, and the family was frequently mocked by other {{children and their parents}} within the community. At the age of five he was sexually abused by a pedophile who lured him in with a butterfly collection. Steiger said of his troubled family background: [...] "If you had the choice of having the childhood you experienced, with your alcoholic mother and being the famous actor you are <b>today,</b> <b>or</b> having a loving, secure childhood and not being famous, which would you take? A loving, secure childhood in a New York minute". During the last 11 years of her life, Steiger's mother stayed sober and regularly attended Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. Steiger recalled: [...] "I was so proud of her. She turned herself around. She came alive again".|$|E
500|$|The play {{had a good}} initial run, {{although}} Horner's trick and {{the notorious}} china scene immediately raised offence. Wycherley laughed off such criticisms in his next play, The Plain Dealer (1676), where he has the hypocritical Olivia exclaim that the china scene in The Country Wife [...] "has quite taken away the reputation of poor china itself, and sullied the most innocent and pretty furniture of a lady's chamber". Olivia's sensible cousin Eliza insists that she'll go see The Country Wife anyway: [...] "All this will not put me out of conceit with china, nor the play, which is acted <b>today,</b> <b>or</b> another of the same beastly author's, as you call him, which I'll go see." [...] Writing himself into The Plain Dealer as the [...] "beastly author" [...] of the china scene, Wycherley seems more amused than repentant. The Country Wife did in fact survive the complaints to become a dependable repertory play from 1675 till the mid-1740s, but by then public taste had changed too much {{to put up with}} the sex jokes any longer. Its last eighteenth century performance in 1753 was followed by a hiatus of 171 years, until the successful Phoenix Society production in 1924 at the Regent Theatre in London. The first-ever American performance of Wycherley's original Country Wife took place in 1931.|$|E
