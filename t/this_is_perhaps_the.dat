In 864 the King of West Francia, Charles the Bald, prohibited the construction of castella without his permission and ordered them all to be destroyed. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> earliest reference to castles, though military historian R. Allen Brown points out that the word castella may have applied to any fortification at the time.|$|E
5|$|In close {{proximity}} is the burial of Tutankhamun. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> most famous discovery of modern Western archaeology. It was discovered here by Howard Carter on November 4, 1922, with clearance and conservation work continuing until 1932. This {{was the first}} royal tomb to be discovered that was still largely intact, although tomb robbers had entered. And until the excavation of KV63 on 10 March 2005, it considered the last major discovery in the valley. The opulence of his grave goods notwithstanding, Tutankhamun was a relatively minor king, and other burials probably had more numerous treasures.|$|E

25|$|Intuitively {{one would}} want an h {{very close to}} zero, however when using floating-point operations, the {{smallest}} number won't give the best approximation of a derivative. As h grows smaller the difference between f (a + h) and f(a) grows smaller, cancelling out the most significant and least erroneous digits and making the most erroneous digits more important. As a result the smallest number of h possible will give a more erroneous approximation of a derivative than a somewhat larger number. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> most common and serious accuracy problem.|$|E

25|$|Richard Bartle, {{author of}} Designing Virtual Worlds, {{classified}} multiplayer RPG-players into four primary psychological groups. His classifications were then expanded upon by Erwin Andreasen, {{who developed the}} concept into the thirty-question Bartle Test that helps players determine which category they are associated with. With over 650,000 test responses as of 2011, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> largest ongoing survey of multiplayer game players. Based on Bartle and Yee's research, Jon Radoff has published an updated model of player motivation that focuses on immersion, competition, cooperation and achievement. These elements may be found not only in MMORPGs, but many other types of games and within the emerging field of gamification.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} by some that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> most interesting of all the series events, including the race itself. In this event there are heats of 5–8 riders, depending {{on the number of}} riders signed up for the day. These heats are seeded according to the results of each rider's ITT. Riders are placed along the starting line in order from fastest (on the inside) to slowest (on the outside) and are then given one lap to get the position they want in the pack and to gain some speed. Once they cross the start/finish line again, the race begins. The riders race around the track and every time the pack crosses the start/finish line, the last one to cross is out and must leave the track. Riders keep racing until there are only three riders left. These three riders {{move on to the next}} round. This process continues until the final heat of 8. In this heat, riders continue to race and get out until you have the last three and then they commence a one lap full out sprint and the first, second, and third-place winners are determined by the order in which the riders cross the start/finish line. This is a great event because it really measures the skill of a rider, because in order to win, a rider must be more than just fast. If a rider hopes to win, she must also have good drafting skills, the ability to find good positioning, the intuition to know when to get out of the pack and sprint around the outside, and the endurance to be able to do this all day.|$|E

500|$|Sergio Angelini {{writes about}} A Warning to the Curious: [...] "Of Clark's many adaptations of James's stories, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> most varied {{in its use}} of {{landscape}} and the most visually arresting {{in its attempt to}} create an otherworldly atmosphere. ... Using long lenses to flatten the scenery and make the ghost indistinct in the background, John McGlashan's fine cinematography brilliantly conveys the ageless, ritualistic determinism of Ager's pursuit and signposts the inevitability of Paxton's demise." [...] Angelini is less appreciative of The Ash Tree, noting that the literal adaptation of the story's ending loses the atmosphere of earlier instalments: [...] "While the creatures are certainly grotesque and threatening, compared with some of the other adaptations of the series, The Ash Tree does lose some power through this lack of ambiguity. The result overall remains satisfyingly unsettling, however, thanks also to Petherbridge's restrained, psychologically acute performance." ...|$|E

[...] Bovberg described the set as [...] "annoying" [...] for missing the episode. Bill Treadway of the DVD Verdict, on {{the exclusion of the}} episode on the DVD, said [...] "It's a small flaw in an otherwise top notch package." [...] In a DVD {{review of the}} third season, Bryan Pope of the DVD Verdict, on the episode as a bonus feature, said [...] "The most intriguing extra is the series' pilot episode, 'Help Wanted'."

500|$|Osborne {{describes}} the scenes that follow—Cavaradossi's interrogation, his torture, Scarpia's sadistic tormenting of Tosca—as Puccini's musical equivalent of grand guignol to which Cavaradossi's brief [...] "Vittoria! Vittoria!" [...] {{on the news}} of Napoleon's victory gives only partial relief. Scarpia's aria [...] "Già, mi dicon venal" [...] ("Yes, they say I am venal") is closely followed by Tosca's [...] "Vissi d'arte". A lyrical andante based on Tosca's act 1 motif, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> opera's best-known aria, yet was regarded by Puccini as a mistake; he considered eliminating it since it held up the action. Fisher calls it [...] "a Job-like prayer questioning God for punishing {{a woman who has}} lived unselfishly and righteously". In the act's finale, Newman likens the orchestral turmoil which follows Tosca's stabbing of Scarpia to the sudden outburst after the slow movement of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. After Tosca's contemptuous [...] "E avanti a lui tremava tutta Roma!" [...] ("All Rome trembled before him"), sung on a middle C monotone [...] (sometimes spoken), the music gradually fades, ending what Newman calls [...] "the most impressively macabre scene in all opera." [...] The final notes in the act are those of the Scarpia motif, softly, in a minor key.|$|E

500|$|Alkan's {{earliest}} works indicate, {{according to}} Smith, {{that in his}} early teens he [...] "was a formidable musician but as yet... industrious rather than... creative". Only with his 12 Caprices (Opp.12–13 and 15–16, 1837) did his compositions begin to attract serious critical attention. The op. 15 set, Souvenirs: Trois morceaux dans le genre pathétique, dedicated to Liszt, contains Le vent (The Wind), which was at one time the only piece by the composer to figure regularly in recitals. These works, however, did not meet {{with the approval of}} Robert Schumann, who wrote: [...] "One is startled by such false, such unnatural art... the last [...] a crabbed waste, overgrown with brush and weeds... nothing is to be found but black on black". Ronald Smith, however, finds in this latter work, which cites the Dies Irae theme also used by Berlioz, Liszt and others, foreshadowings of Maurice Ravel, Modest Mussorgsky and Charles Ives. Schumann did, however, respond positively to the pieces of Les mois (originally part published as Op.8 in 1838, later published as a complete set in 1840 as Op. 74): [...] " [...] we find such an excellent jest on operatic music in no.6 [...] that a better one could scarcely be imagined... The composer... well understands the rarer effects of his instrument." [...] Alkan's technical mastery of the keyboard was asserted by the publication in 1838 of the Trois grandes études (originally without opus number, later republished as Op.76), the first for the left hand alone, the second for the right hand alone, the third for both hands; and all of great difficulty, described by Smith as [...] "a peak of pianistic transcendentalism". <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> earliest example of writing for a single hand as [...] "an entity in its own right, capable of covering all registers of the piano, of rendering itself as accompanied soloist or polyphonist." ...|$|E

2500|$|Pope Leo XIII {{had sought}} to revive the {{inheritance}} of Thomas Aquinas, 'the marriage of reason and revelation', {{as a response to}} secular 'enlightenment'.

He also encouraged the formation and efforts of Sodalitium Pianum (or League of Pius V), an anti-Modernist network of informants, which was seen negatively by many people due to its accusations of heresy against people on the flimsiest evidence. This campaign against Modernism was run by Umberto Benigni in the Department of Extraordinary Affairs in the Secretariat of State, distributing anti-Modernist propaganda and gathering information on [...] "culprits".
