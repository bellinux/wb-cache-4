500|$|May Opera Evenings is {{a festival}} that has {{occurred}} annually in Skopje since 1972 and is dedicated to promoting opera among the general public. Over the years, it {{has evolved into a}} stage on which artists from some 50 countries have performed. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>other</b> major international theater festival that takes place each year at the end of month September, the Young Open Theater Festival (MOT), which was organized {{for the first time in}} May 1976 by the Youth Cultural Center – Skopje. More than 700 theatrical performances have been presented at this festival so far, most of them being alternative, experimental theatre groups engaging young writers and actors. [...] The MOT International theater festival is also a member of the International Network for Contemporary Performing Arts or IETM. Within the framework of the MOT Festival, the Macedonian National Center of the International Theater Institute (ITI) was established, and at the 25th ITI World Congress in Munich in 1993, it became a regular member of this theater association. The festival has an international character, always representing theaters from all over the world that present and enhance exchange and circulation of young-fresh-experimental-avant guard theatrical energy and experience between its participants on one side and the audience on the other.|$|E
500|$|The verso of the folio {{containing}} the Arrest of Christ contains a full page of decorated text which begins [...] "". Facing the miniature of the Temptation is another full page of decorated text (folio 203r [...] "Iesus autem plenus"). In {{addition to this}} page, five other full pages also receive elaborate treatment. In Matthew, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>other</b> full-page treatment ( [...] , [...] "Tunc crucifixerant Xpi cum eo duos latrones"). In the Gospel of Mark, there are also two pages of decorated text ( [...] , [...] "Erat autem hora tercia", and folio 187v, [...] " [...] quidem [...] postquam"). The Gospel of Luke contains two pages of fully decorated text (folio 188v, [...] "Fuit in diebus Herodis [...] ", and , [...] "Una autem sabbati valde"). Although these texts do not have miniatures associated with them, {{it is probable that}} miniatures were planned to accompany each of these texts and have either been lost or were never completed. There is no surviving full page of text in the Gospel of John other than the Incipit. However, in the other three Gospels, all the full pages of decorated text, except for folio 188c, which begins the Nativity narration, occur within the Passion narrative. However, since the missing folios of John contain the Passion narrative, it is likely that John contained full pages of decorated text that have been lost.|$|E

2500|$|<b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>other</b> {{way for a}} spell to be [...] "countered". If {{the spell}} targets {{something}} (such as Giant Growth or Shock), then the target must be legal both when the spell is cast and when it resolves. A spell can't be cast without a legal target; if the target becomes illegal while the spell is on the stack, then the spell is countered by the game rules (for having an illegal target) just before it would start to resolve. If a spell is countered this way, then {{no part of the}} spell— even a non-targeting part of the spell's effect— takes place. This is referred to as 'Countered Upon Resolution' (formerly [...] "Fizzling").|$|E

Sevmash is the only shipyard in Russia producing nuclear submarines. The next to last nuclear submarine produced at the shipyard is the nuclear-powered attack submarine Severodvinsk, which was launched in 2010 and is currently fitting out. Its completion had been delayed due to financial issues. [...] The second Borei class submarine Aleksandr Nevskiy was launched later in 2010 and delivered to the Navy on 23 December 2013, becoming the 130th nuclear-powered submarine delivered by Sevmash. [...] <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>other</b> [...] Kazan and one Borei class submarine Vladimir Monomakh currently under construction at the shipyard.

According to residents of the area, it still exists. Based on a comparison of contemporary and historic maps, the Receiving Station and the present day Sydney South electricity substation share the same footprint, with the latter apparently situated directly above the former. The substation is bounded on its southwestern and southeastern sides by Henry Lawson Drive, in the Georges River National Park. It is alleged that {{there are several other}} bunkers in the Bankstown area, such as under an electricity block house on the corner of Milperra Road and Henry Lawson Drive, and a demolished bunker under Condell Park High School.|$|E
2500|$|Southern Pacific 4449 is {{the only}} {{surviving}} example of Southern Pacific Railroad's (SP) (today Union Pacific) GS-4 class of steam locomotives. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>other</b> GS-class locomotive surviving, {{but it is a}} GS-6. The locomotive is a streamlined 4-8-4 (Northern) type steam locomotive. GS is abbreviated from [...] "Golden State", a nickname for California (where the locomotive was operated in regular service), or [...] "General Service". The locomotive was built by Lima Locomotive Works in Lima, Ohio, for SP in May 1941; it received the red-and-orange [...] "Daylight" [...] paint scheme for the passenger trains of the same name which it hauled for most of its service career. No. 4449 was retired from revenue service in 1956 and put into storage. In 1958 it was donated, by the railroad, to the City of Portland, who then put it on static display in Oaks Amusement Park, where it remained until 1974. It was restored to operation for use in the American Freedom Train, which toured the 48 contiguous United States for the American Bicentennial celebrations. [...] Since then, 4449 has been operated in excursion service throughout the continental US; its operations are based at the Oregon Rail Heritage Center in Portland, where it is maintained by a group of dedicated volunteers called Friends of SP 4449. In 1983, a poll of Trains magazine readers chose the 4449 as the most popular locomotive in the nation.|$|E
2500|$|Los Chivos {{is another}} dance {{performed}} in Guerrero. It is dancers perform movements {{related to that}} of goats (chivos) accompanies by wood boxes used as drums and an instruments made from a donkey’s jaw, which is rubbed on the side with a wooden stick. The dancers wear red wooden masks with deer antlers covered in streamers and paper flowers, along with skirts that reach the knees. Machomula refers to a wooden horse’s head which {{is central to the}} dance performed in the Costa Chica of Guerrero. The night before a festival, this head is carried on beams all night while the men sing and sometimes perform parodies. On the day of the festival, they form a procession with the guardian of the horse’s head in front on a wooden horse. Pescados (Fish) is performed mostly in Guerrero by participants acting as fishermen with nets and with those that play the part of fish who are identified by small wooden fish that hang from their shoulders. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>other</b> character which is a lizard, who is covered with a wooden frame that opens and closes its mouth. It also carries some barbed wire which it used to try to hit the fishermen. It is similar to the Tortuga (turtle) dance. [...] comes from Nahuatl which means jaguars or tigers. This dance is the only which features this animal. In this dance, the animal chases children and is in turned pursued by men, who wear masks, boots or chaps and very large sombreros. They carry whips which they use to hit the tiger who wears padding. The dance is very similar to Tlacololeros in its movements. Both are performed in Guerrero.|$|E
