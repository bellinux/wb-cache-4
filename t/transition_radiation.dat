2500|$|The <b>Transition</b> <b>Radiation</b> Tracker (TRT), the {{outermost}} {{component of the}} inner detector, {{is a combination of}} a straw tracker and a <b>transition</b> <b>radiation</b> detector. The detecting elements are drift tubes (straws), each four millimetres in diameter and up to 144 centimetres long. [...] The uncertainty of track position measurements (position resolution) is about 200micrometres. This is not as precise as those for the other two detectors, but it was necessary to reduce the cost of covering a larger volume and to have <b>transition</b> <b>radiation</b> detection capability. [...] Each straw is filled with gas that becomes ionized when a charged particle passes through. [...] The straws are held at about −1,500V, driving the negative ions to a fine wire down the centre of each straw, producing a current pulse (signal) in the wire. [...] The wires with signals create a pattern of 'hit' straws that allow the path of the particle to be determined. [...] Between the straws, materials with widely varying indices of refraction cause ultra-relativistic charged particles to produce <b>transition</b> <b>radiation</b> and leave much stronger signals in some straws. [...] Xenon and argon gas is used {{to increase the number of}} straws with strong signals. [...] Since the amount of <b>transition</b> <b>radiation</b> is greatest for highly relativistic particles (those with a speed very near the speed of light), and because particles of a particular energy have a higher speed the lighter they are, particle paths with many very strong signals can be identified as belonging to the lightest charged particles: electrons and their antiparticles, positrons. The TRT has about 298,000 straws in total.|$|E

The new type of radiation appearing {{as a result of}} charged particle passing through the boundary between two layers of matter. Eventually, in 1959, Garibian together with K.A. Barsukov from the Lebedev Physical Institute, discovered X-Ray <b>Transition</b> <b>Radiation</b> (as a part of <b>Transition</b> <b>Radiation),</b> the intensity of which had a linear dependence on the Lorentz factor of the particle.

40|$|We {{present a}} method for the {{numerical}} solution of the Boltzmann equation (BE) describing plasma electrons. We apply the method to a capacitively-coupled, radio-frequency-driven He discharge in parallel-plate (quasi- 1 D) geometry which contains time scales for physical processes spanning six orders of magnitude. Our BE solution procedure uses the method of characteristics for the Vlasov operator with interpolation in phase space at early time, allowing storage of the distribution function on a fixed phase-space grid. By alternating this BE method with a fluid description of the electrons, or with a novel time-cycle-average equation method, we compute the periodic steady state of a He plasma by time evolution from startup conditions. We find that the results compare favorably with measured current-voltage, plasma density, and ``cited state densities in the ``GEC`` Reference Cell.

The governing equations of the problem are solved by the normal-mode analysis. The solution is expressed in a form of infinite sum of orthogonal natural modes multiplied by the generalized coordinate of displacement. The natural frequencies are obtained numerically exploiting the concept of the global dynamic stiffness matrix. This ensures that the frequencies obtained are exact. The methodology has restrictions neither on velocity nor on damping. The approach looks simple, though, the numerical expression of the results is not straightforward. A general procedure for numerical implementation is presented and verified. To illustrate the utility of the methodology parametric optimization is presented and influence of the load mass is studied.
