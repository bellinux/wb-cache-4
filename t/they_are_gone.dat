5|$|Chris hates {{being in}} the Youth Scouts and wants to quit, but is afraid to tell his father Peter. Chris is finally kicked out when he runs over the troop leader during a Soap Box Derby. Peter insists on driving Chris {{and the rest of}} the family (Peter's wife Lois, their {{daughter}} Meg and their infant Stewie) to the Youth Scout headquarters, in Manhattan, to get Chris readmitted. While <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>gone,</b> their talking dog Brian is watching Nova just as the show is interrupted to show several episodes of the sitcom One Day at a Time. He tries to change the channel, but is unable to do so (nor he can turn the TV off), losing his intelligence shortly after watching a few episodes.|$|E
5|$|Leslie asks April (Aubrey Plaza) {{to check}} on a {{budgeting}} request while <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>gone.</b> What should be a simple chore, however, has April waiting on hold at the phone for hours. When she desperately has to use the restroom, Andy agrees to wait by the phone. When she returns, the two start to bond by making up their own lyrics to the hold music, playing a non-water game of Marco Polo around the office, and seeing who can make the best spit-take. When Andy says he is jealous that his ex-girlfriend Ann (Rashida Jones) {{is going to the}} hunting trip with Mark, April offers to give him a hickey to make Ann jealous, which Andy accepts.|$|E
25|$|Controls in The Bouncer {{are similar}} to those in the Tobal series. Certain buttons denote high, middle, and low attacks, whilst others are used for jumping attacks, blocking, and special moves. Players have a health meter during gameplay, which, if depleted, means the player dies. Players also have a limited amount of guard points {{available}} to them, although this is not represented by an onscreen meter. As the player blocks, the amount of guard points diminish. When <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>gone</b> completely, the player can no longer block.|$|E

25|$|To counter Katherina's shrewish nature, Petruchio pretends {{that any}} harsh things she says or does are {{actually}} kind and gentle. Katherina agrees to marry Petruchio after seeing {{he is the}} only man willing to counter her quick remarks; however, at the ceremony Petruchio makes an embarrassing scene when he strikes the priest and drinks the communion wine. After the wedding, Petruchio takes Katherina to his home against her will. Once <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>gone,</b> Gremio and Tranio (disguised as Lucentio) formally bid for Bianca, with Tranio easily outbidding Gremio. However, in his zeal to win, he promises much more than Lucentio actually possesses. When Baptista determines that once Lucentio's father confirms the dowry, Bianca and Tranio (i.e. Lucentio) can marry, Tranio decides they will need someone to pretend to be Vincentio, Lucentio's father. Meanwhile, Tranio persuades Hortensio that Bianca is not worthy of his attentions, thus removing Lucentio's remaining rival.|$|E
500|$|Mitsui was a {{guest at}} the {{ceremony}} to relight the lamp on the Japanese Canadian War Memorial in Vancouver's Stanley Park on 2 August 1985; the lamp had been extinguished in 1942. [...] The 98-year-old Mitsui stated in an interview: [...] "I've done my last duty to my comrades. [...] <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>gone</b> but not forgotten." [...] He was the last surviving member of the 228 Japanese-Canadian veterans of World WarI when he died on 22 April 1987.|$|E
500|$|Rastignac's family, off-stage, also sacrifices {{extensively}} for him. Convinced that he cannot {{achieve a}} decent status in Paris without a considerable display of wealth, he writes {{to his family}} and asks them to send him money: [...] "Sell some of your old jewelry, my kind mother; I will give you other jewels very soon." [...] They do send him the money he requests, and– although it is not described directly in the novel– endure significant hardship for themselves as a result. His family, absent while he is in Paris, becomes even more distant despite this sacrifice. Although Goriot and Vautrin offer themselves as father figures to him, {{by the end of the}} novel <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>gone</b> and he is alone.|$|E

2500|$|Shakespeare's use of {{this line}} may have been {{influenced}} by the Greek playwright Euripides (c. 480-406 BC), who wrote, [...] "When good men die their goodness does not perish, but lives though <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>gone.</b> As for the bad, all that was theirs dies and is buried with them." ...|$|E
2500|$|Earth {{visitors}} to Narnia typically {{find that a}} visit to Narnia lasts longer in Narnia (sometimes much longer) than the corresponding period of their absence from Earth. How much longer appears to be arbitrary. For example, in The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe, Lucy's first visit to Narnia lasts hours and the four children's main adventure there lasts perhaps several decades [...] long {{enough for them to}} grow into adults and almost forget their childhood on Earth. Each time, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>gone</b> from Earth for just a few seconds. Visiting Narnia one always finds that more time passed there than on Earth, but there does not seem a fixed rate: between The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe and Prince Caspian about a thousand years passed in Narnia, but between that and The Voyage of the Dawn Treader only three years, and to The Silver Chair several decades.|$|E
2500|$|Cosgrave's {{determination}} to support government anti-terrorist legislation in {{votes in the}} Dáil, {{in the face of}} outright opposition from his party, almost cost him his leadership. The growing liberal wing in Fine Gael was opposing the Government's stringent laws on civil liberty grounds. Cosgrave put the security of the State and its institutions first. At the Fine Gael Ard Fheis in May 1972, Cosgrave faced down his political opponents in spectacular style. 1972 marked the fiftieth anniversary of the foundation of the Irish Free State and so was an important milestone in the history of Fine Gael. However, the FF government ignored the anniversary while liberals in Fine Gael were plotting to remove Cosgrave as leader. In a speech littered with references to Fine Gael's founding fathers, he contrasted the difficulties posed by the IRA in Northern Ireland with those faced by the first Free State government in dealing with the anti-treatyites. Departing from his script Cosgrave rounded on his leadership rivals. Asking delegates if they did any hunting Cosgrave declared that [...] "... some of these commentators and critics are now like mongrel foxes; <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>gone</b> to ground but I'll dig them out, and the pack will chop them when they get them". Despite being criticised for taking a [...] "partionist" [...] or unionist stance in his speech, Cosgrave was leading Fine Gael back into power a year later. Cosgrave supported the Government's Offences Against the State (Amendment) Bill in November 1972, despite the position taken by Fine Gael to oppose the Bill.|$|E
