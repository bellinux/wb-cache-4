5000|$|TYLCV {{is found}} in {{tropical}} and subtropical regions, {{and it is the}} {{one of the most important}} pathogens against tomato crops around the world. This virus was first detected in Israel around 1930, and now it affects more than 30 countries around the world that grow tomatoes. TYLCV has been found in different countries from Africa, Asia, Australia, and Central and North America. The two isolates of TYLCV that are most commonly found in affected countries are tomato yellow leaf curl Sardinia virus (TYLCSV) and tomato yellow leaf curl virus-Israel (TYLCV-Isr). The first detection of TYLCV was confirmed <b>through</b> <b>blot</b> hybridization, PCR, and genome sequencing in the Dominic Republic in 1994. From here, it was then found in Jamaica and Cuba. One of the most effective techniques to detect geminiviruses in tomato is the visualization of inclusion bodies using a light microscope, as well as the immunological detection with antibodies. [...] Not only has the virus spread over the last few decades, but its insect vector has a wide distribution range as well. Bemisia tabaci has a wide geographical distribution, and it can be found in Asia, Africa, North, Central, and South America, and Australia. Since the insect vector has a wide distribution range, the virus can be spread to new areas where it has not been found but the insect is present.|$|E
40|$|A bovine {{fibronectin}} (FN) cDNA clone (pFB 1) {{was isolated}} by screening a cDNA library of calf testis fibroblasts with a synthetic oligonucleotide probe.

E., Thøgersen, H. C., Skorstengaard, K., Vibe-Pedersen, K., Sahl, P., Sottrup-Jensen, L. & Magnusson. S. (1983) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 80. 137 - 141]. pFB 1 contained a 1, 000 base-pair (bp) insert comprising the complete 3 ' noncoding sequence (690 bp) and approximately equal to 300 bp of the coding region. The clone pFB 1 was used as a radioactive probe in the screening of a human cell line (Hs 578 T) cDNA library. Eleven positive cDNA clones were detected, one of which, named pFH 1, contained a 2, 000 -bp insert comprising the complete 3 ' noncoding region (693 bp) and approximately equal to 1, 300 bp of the coding region of human FN. The sequences of the clone pFB 1 insert and of the homologous region in clone pFH 1 were determined. The nucleotide sequences are 90 % homologous. Six amino acid changes were found, clustered in an area connecting two structural domains described in bovine plasma FN. Furthermore, the 204 COOH-terminal amino acid sequence of bovine FN was completed by overlapping two peptide fragments (MrS 3, 000 and 23, 000).

40|$|Abstract Background: Cisplatin is {{the main}} {{chemotherapeutic}} drug {{for the treatment of}} cervical cancers, however resistance to cisplatin is increasingly common and therefore has limited the efficacy and use of this drug in the clinic. Dosedependent toxicity poses an additional challenge since patients suffer long-term and often permanent side-effects after treatment. Bcl- 2 up-regulation has been implicated in the resistance to cisplatin in a variety of cancer cell lines, however its role in cervical cancer is confounding. Methods: A low, non-cytotoxic concentration of cisplatin was used in the treatment of HeLa and CaSki cells. Bcl- 2 expression was determined <b>through</b> Western <b>blotting</b> and immunocytochemistry before and after treatment with cisplatin. To assess the reliance of the cervical cancer cells on Bcl- 2 in the presence of cisplatin, Bcl- 2 knock-down was achieved through RNA interference, where after apoptosis was assessed through PARP cleavage (Western blotting), Caspase activity (Caspase-Glo©) and PI inclusion analysis (Flow cytometry). Finally, pre-malignant and malignant cervi‑ cal tissue was analysed for the presence of Bcl- 2 <b>through</b> Western <b>blotting</b> and immunofluorescence. Results: Cervical cancer cells upregulate Bcl- 2 when treated with a non-cytotoxic concentration of cisplatin, which when silenced, effectively enhanced cisplatin sensitivity, and therefore significantly induced apoptosis. Analysis of the expression profile of Bcl- 2 in cervical tissue revealed its up-regulation in cervical carcinoma, which agrees with results obtained from the in vitro data. Conclusions: Our data strongly suggest that utilising a lower dose of cisplatin is feasible when combined with Bcl- 2 silencing as an adjuvant treatment, thereby improving both the dose-dependent toxicity, as well as cervical cancer resistance.

40|$|Pentraxin 3 (PTX 3) is a soluble pattern {{recognition}} receptor that binds with high affinity and selectivity to fibroblast growth factor- 2 (FGF 2), thus inhibiting its pro-angiogenic activity. Here we investigated {{the effects of}} PTX 3 on monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and multiple myeloma (MM) patient-derived bone marrow (BM) plasma cells (PCs), endothelial cells (ECs), and fibroblasts (FBs), and assessed whether PTX 3 can modulate the cross-talk between PCs and those microenvironment cells. PTX 3 and FGF 2 expression was evaluated by ELISA. Functional studies, including cell viability, wound healing, chemotaxis, and Matrigel(®) assays, were performed on MGUS and MM ECs and FBs upon the PTX 3 treatment. <b>Through</b> western <b>blot</b> PTX 3 -induced modulation in FGF 2 /FGF receptor signalling pathways was evaluated in MGUS and MM ECs and FBs <b>through</b> western <b>blot.</b> Co-cultures between MM ECs/FBs and human PC lines were used to evaluate possible PTX 3 indirect effects on MM PCs. Adhesion molecules were studied by flow cytometry. PTX 3 provides a direct time- and dose-dependent apoptotic effect on MM ECs and FBs, but not on either MM primary PCs or human PC lines. PTX 3 inhibits migration of MM ECs and FBs in a dose-dependent manner, and impacts in vitro and in vivo FGF 2 -mediated MM angiogenesis. Co-cultures of PCs and ECs/FBs show that PTX 3 treatment indirectly impairs PC viability and adhesion.
