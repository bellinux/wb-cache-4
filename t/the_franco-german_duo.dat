40|$|In {{spite of}} a {{traditionally}} different approach towards European integration in Britain and Germany, under New Labour and the red-green coalition British and German European policy positions have moved closer than ever before. In a European Union which is increasingly characterised by a multiplicity of shifting alliances, a British-German working partnership could potentially provide leadership {{on a number of}} issues. The British government's failure to balance European and American interests over Iraq has, however, seriously damaged the basis for future British-German co-operation. Tony Blair's choice to sacrifice the domestic political campaign on the euro and to focus instead on supporting the Bush administration over Iraq has once again pushed Britain to the sidelines in the EU. The result is a renewed dominance of <b>the</b> <b>Franco-German</b> <b>duo,</b> with an economically weakened Germany once again diminished to a junior role alongside France...|$|E
40|$|The ePublication ‘The “Franco-German duo” and Europe {{as seen in}} {{cartoons}} (1945 – 2013) ’ uses French and German press illustrations {{to explore}} the joint action of successive French Presidents and German Chancellors as {{the driving force of}} European integration. The rapprochement that began in the early years after the Second World War between France and Germany, two countries that had been long-standing enemies, followed a unique path. The image of a ‘Franco-German duo’ and the pair’s actions have proved an unending source of inspiration for French and German Press cartoonists. It shows how they have experienced, perceived and illustrated this Franco-German partnership, which has continued to evolve during the turbulent history of European integration. This comparative analysis reflects the convergences and divergences within this unique pairing and demonstrates the ever-changing balance of power within the partnership. The cartoons also reveal {{the fact that there is}} often a discrepancy between official photos and the reality of the Franco-German relationship. Although <b>the</b> <b>Franco-German</b> <b>duo</b> and its ability to act for the organisation of Europe have at times proved fragile, with periods of tension but also of continuity, the relationship between the various West German Chancellors and French Presidents has made an often decisive contribution to the pursuit and revival of European integration. Over 400 cartoons published in the French and German press reflect the key moments in Franco-German relations and emphasise how this ‘marriage of convenience’ between two leaders has influenced the European integration process, illustrating both the successes and failures of the duo. The selected cartoons provide an often cheeky, sarcastic interpretation of <b>the</b> <b>Franco-German</b> <b>duo,</b> that special relationship, which, despite its periods of tension and crisis, has always bounced back and has often served as a driving force for European unification. The cartoons reflect the two leaders’ attitudes to the challenges of the European integration process, painting an often humorous but at times openly critical picture of this bilateral relationship...|$|E
