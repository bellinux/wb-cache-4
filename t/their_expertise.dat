5|$|In the 1830s, the 10th Earl of Home and his nephews the 5th Duke of Buccleuch and Lord John Scott, had {{imported}} progenitors of {{the breed}} from Newfoundland to Europe {{for use as}} gundogs. Another early advocate of these Newfoundland dogs, or Labrador Retrievers as they later became known, was the 2nd Earl of Malmesbury who bred them for <b>their</b> <b>expertise</b> in waterfowling.|$|E
5|$|Compounding {{these issues}} was the one-year {{rotation}} policy {{adopted by the}} Pentagon in Southeast Asia. Although the first aircrews arriving in-theater were highly experienced, the rapidly growing tempo and ever-expanding length of the operation demanded more personnel. This exacerbated a growing lack of experienced aircrews. This dilemma was further compounded by an Air Force policy which dictated universal pilot training while proscribing involuntary second combat tours, which combined, {{had the effect of}} rotating personnel to different aircraft. Conversely, the Navy tended to maintain its aircrews within the same community for the duration of their careers, thereby retaining <b>their</b> <b>expertise,</b> but also incurring greater losses among experienced crews undergoing multiple combat tours.|$|E
5|$|He {{served on}} the boards of the Electricity Trust and the Housing Trust, among others. Here, unused to not being in {{absolute}} control, and having little specific scientific knowledge, he occasionally stumbled in his decisions. This also created difficulties with the other board members, who were reluctant to disagree with their former boss, regardless of <b>their</b> <b>expertise.</b> But his thrift, a theme throughout his Premiership, did not abate; he was constantly forcing the trusts to use cost-saving methods and old vehicles for their work. This extended to his family property; he vigorously opposed his son's desire to install a new irrigation system in the orchard.|$|E

5|$|In many respects, Ranavalona's {{rule was}} a {{continuation}} of precedent established under Radama I. Both monarchs encouraged {{the introduction of new}} technologies and forms of knowledge from abroad, supported the establishment of an industrialized economy, and adopted measures to professionalize the army. Both viewed foreigners with ambivalence, establishing close personal relationships and drawing upon <b>their</b> <b>expertise</b> while enforcing restrictions on their activities to avert destabilizing changes to existing cultural and political systems.

The plans were adapted, and became Operation Market Garden. This operation would involve three airborne divisions, however the coup-de-main assault plans were not carried out.|$|E
5|$|From January to June 2016, {{the city}} bought 4 boats for the {{proposed}} ferry service for a combined total of $6 million, with plans {{for a total of}} 30 boats over the coming years. Hornblower Cruises requested 13 boats for the first routes, each costing $4 million each. The total combined cost of the boats is more than $70 million. In addition, the city was building 13 ferry landings at a cost of $85 million, as well as a boat depot. One of these docks, in Astoria, was built privately as part of the Astoria Cove development. In September 2016, construction on 19 ferries began at two shipyards in Bayou La Batre, Alabama, and Jeanerette, Louisiana, with 200 full-time employees working on the boats. The contract with the two shipyards is unusual because shipbuilding contracts are usually with only one company. However, NYC Ferry executives had purposely chosen these two companies because of <b>their</b> <b>expertise</b> and because of the unlikeliness that both shipyards would be destroyed by hurricanes.|$|E
