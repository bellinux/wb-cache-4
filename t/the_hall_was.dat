5|$|Braidwood {{regarded}} Westminster Hall as {{safe from}} destruction by 1:45am, {{partly because of}} the actions of the floating fire engine, but also because a change {{in the direction of the}} wind kept the flames away from the Hall. Once the crowd realised that <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>was</b> safe they began to disperse, and had left by around 3:00am, by which time the fire near <b>the</b> <b>Hall</b> <b>was</b> nearly out, although it continued to burn towards the south of the complex. The firemen remained in place until about 5:00am, when they had extinguished the last remaining flames and the police and soldiers had been replaced by new shifts.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, Channel 4's Time Team {{undertook}} excavations on the Eastern Terrace. Their investigations revealed {{evidence of}} a medieval hall {{to the east of}} the castle; {{it has been suggested that}} <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>was</b> used as a dining area.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Hall</b> <b>is</b> {{no longer}} {{open to the}} public but the new owners hope to re-open it to the public as soon as <b>the</b> <b>Hall</b> <b>is</b> restored. <b>The</b> <b>Hall</b> <b>is</b> {{currently}} on Historic England's Buildings at Risk Register. Pitchford Church (CofE), opposite <b>the</b> <b>Hall,</b> <b>is</b> open to <b>the</b> public and holds services once or twice a month.|$|R
50|$|Associated with <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>are</b> two Grade II listed buildings. Leading up to {{the garden}} of <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>is</b> a flight of stone steps that are dated 1653.

5|$|Worsley New Hall, {{designed}} by Edward Blore, {{was built in}} 1846 for Francis Egerton the First Earl of Ellesmere. The plans are held at the Victoria and Albert Museum. Queen Victoria visited the hall in 1851 and 1857; Edward VII and Queen Alexandra visited when Edward was Prince of Wales in 1869, and on 6 July 1909. <b>The</b> <b>hall</b> <b>was</b> used as a hospital in World War I and in World War II housed Dunkirk evacuees, American soldiers preparing for D-Day and the Lancashire Fusiliers. In 1943 <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>was</b> badly damaged by fire and demolished in 1949.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>hall</b> <b>is</b> built only 30 m from {{a covered}} railway line. To prevent the {{transmission}} of vibrations, <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>is</b> mounted on rubber cushions, as is the railway track. <b>The</b> <b>hall</b> <b>is</b> also shielded from heavy traffic on Broad Street by double skins of concrete. Large, low-speed air ducting cuts the ventilation noise.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>hall</b> <b>is</b> now {{located at}} the Invista Centre, a four-pad arena located at 1350 Gardiners Road. <b>The</b> <b>hall</b> <b>is</b> on <b>the</b> {{second floor of the}} facility.|$|R
5000|$|The maximum {{ceiling height}} at <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>is</b> 30.78 m. <b>The</b> <b>hall</b> has <b>been</b> {{constructed}} in levels: basement, arena, ground floor, 1st gallery, 2nd gallery and the connecting part toward the West Wing.

5|$|In {{contrast}} to the Diwan-i-Aam, the Diwan-i-Khas served as a hall where the Emperor would attend to matters of the state, and where courtiers and state guests were received. <b>The</b> <b>hall</b> <b>was</b> site of elaborate pageantry, with processions of up to one hour long occurring before each audience session.|$|E
5|$|Many {{events at}} the Queen's Hall were not {{presented}} by Newman. <b>The</b> <b>hall</b> <b>was</b> frequently let to organisations such as the Bach Choir and the Philharmonic Society (from 1903 the Royal Philharmonic Society), and later the London Choral Society and Royal Choral Society. <b>The</b> <b>hall</b> <b>was</b> used {{for a wide range}} of other activities, including balls, military band concerts under Sousa, lectures, public meetings, Morris dancing, Eurythmics and religious services. On 14 January 1896, the UK's first public film show was presented at the Queen's Hall to members and wives of the Royal Photographic Society by the maker of the Kineopticon and Fellow of the society, Birt Acres, and his colleague, Arthur Melbourne-Cooper. This was an improved version of the early Kinetoscope.|$|E

5|$|The Phra Thinang Dusit Maha Prasat (พระที่นั่งดุสิตมหาปราสาท) {{dominates the}} Maha Prasat group. <b>The</b> throne <b>hall</b> <b>was</b> {{built on a}} {{symmetrical}} cruciform plan, the roof is topped with a tall gilded spire. <b>The</b> <b>hall</b> <b>is</b> considered an ideal archetype of Thai traditional architecture. Every aspect of the exterior decoration of <b>the</b> throne <b>hall</b> <b>is</b> imbuded with symbolism. <b>The</b> <b>hall</b> <b>is</b> built in <b>the</b> shape of a tall mountain to represent Mount Meru, the mythological centre of the universe.|$|R
5|$|Middleton Hall on Town Street {{was built}} in the 18th century for the Brandlings but they chose to live mainly in Durham. Charles John Brandling of Gosforth House, the Member of Parliament for Newcastle between 1798 and 1812 and for Northumberland from 1820 until 1826, married Henrietta Armitage of Middleton. The Brandlings {{appointed}} John Blenkinsop to manage their collieries in Middleton and he was the hall's occupant in 1809. <b>The</b> <b>hall</b> <b>was</b> destroyed in a fire in 1962.|$|E
5|$|Substantial {{alterations}} {{appear to}} have taken place {{during the early years of}} Samuel Egerton's ownership in the mid-18th century. The canopy at the dais end of the Great Hall was destroyed– although part of it can still be seen in the north wall– when a floor was inserted and new rooms were formed with lath and plaster partitions. The east wing of <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>was</b> probably demolished at about the same time, but certainly before 1812, the date of the earliest estate map.|$|E
5|$|The {{ceremonial}} {{and residential}} part was divided between two new halls, the Dusit Maha Prasat and the Phiman Rattaya. Ever since then no coronations were held inside the hall. Upon the king's death, <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>was</b> used for his official lying-in-state. It {{has since become}} a custom that the remains of kings, queens and other high-ranking {{members of the royal}} family are to be placed with the hall for an official mourning period.|$|E

5|$|The {{first major}} {{international}} tournament in <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>was</b> some matches of the 1993 World Women's Handball Championship. Lillehammer IK plays its home matches at Kristins Hall, but in 1995 the play-off match {{between it and}} neighbor town rivals Storhamar Dragons was played at Håkons Hall. The match saw more than 5,000 spectators, the record for Lillehammer IK. In 1995, the award ceremony for Spellemannsprisen, Norwegian music's highest award, was held at Håkons Hall.|$|E
5|$|The house {{shows the}} {{transition}} from medieval architecture, in which <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>was</b> the main living and entertaining room, to the more modern plan, where the hall became a reception room. Somerhill {{is one of the}} earliest examples of this. When built, this was an innovative design.|$|E
5|$|The main {{contractor}} was Veidekke and construction cost NOK238 million. Grants were given from the Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate and SINTEF for energy economization. The work on <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>was</b> concluded on 1 February 1993. It was the 27th indoor {{ice hockey rink}} in Norway.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> village <b>hall</b> <b>was</b> {{built in}} remembrance of local men {{who died in}} WW1. <b>The</b> <b>Hall</b> <b>is</b> used {{for a wide range}} of {{activities}} and events.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>halls</b> <b>are</b> adjoining. <b>The</b> closed <b>hall</b> <b>is</b> {{complete}} in design but <b>the</b> open <b>hall</b> <b>is</b> not. It has no structure above its eaves (due to the missing tower) and provides two side entrances into the temple, the southern entrance being {{flanked by two}} small elephant balustrades. The outer wall of <b>the</b> closed <b>hall</b> has, in addition to usual Hindu iconography, some unusual reliefs, depicting animals devouring animals. The ceiling art in <b>the</b> open <b>hall</b> <b>is</b> of fine quality and the pillars have a glossy finish. The pillars of <b>the</b> mantapa (<b>hall)</b> <b>are</b> bell shaped, a design achieved by turning with lathes.|$|R
50|$|The ward {{office is}} located at 6 Nishimisono. <b>The</b> <b>hall</b> <b>is</b> split into north and south <b>halls</b> and <b>the</b> south <b>hall</b> <b>was</b> {{previously}} used as Kitahama Village <b>Hall.</b> <b>The</b> north <b>hall</b> <b>was</b> built {{as a result of}} five municipalities merged to form the town of Hamakita and later become the city of Hamakita.|$|R
5|$|A {{water mill}} and Mill Hill were {{mentioned}} in a grant in 1544. Water power was in general use in Rivington and many houses including the hall had water-mills. The one at <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>was</b> once used to churn butter. The foundations {{of what could}} have been a mill opposite Mill Hill Cottages on Rivington Lane, mill ponds, and a smithy were shown on the 1848 first edition Ordnance Survey map. Names such as Mill Hill and Mill Dam Wood also provide evidence of the former mill.|$|E
5|$|By the 1960s, the Aldeburgh Festival was {{outgrowing}} its customary venues, {{and plans}} to build a new concert hall in Aldeburgh were not progressing. When redundant Victorian maltings buildings in the village of Snape, six miles inland, became available for hire, Britten realised that the largest of them could be converted into a concert hall and opera house. The 830-seat Snape Maltings hall was opened by the Queen {{at the start of the}} twentieth Aldeburgh Festival on 2 June 1967; it was immediately hailed as one of the best concert halls in the country. <b>The</b> <b>hall</b> <b>was</b> destroyed by fire in 1969, but Britten was determined that it would be rebuilt in time for the following year's festival, which it was. The Queen again attended the opening performance in 1970.|$|E
5|$|By the Elizabeth period, Dunham Massey Castle {{had been}} demolished. Probably during the medieval period, Dunham Massey Hall became {{the home of}} the manorial lord, and a centre of power in the area. <b>The</b> <b>hall</b> <b>was</b> rebuilt in 1616, leaving no remains of the old medieval manor house. A mill at Dunham was {{documented}} in 1353, although the its present structure dates to the 1860s. It lies on the River Bollin, opposite Little Bollington. The first record of Dunham's deer park was also in 1353. The settlement at Dunham Woodhouse (named after an outlying lodge on the estate) dates from the 15th century. During the medieval period, the primary source of employment was agriculture, mainly arable farming.|$|E
