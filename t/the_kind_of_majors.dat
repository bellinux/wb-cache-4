Thomas Warner had spearheaded the drive to equip the Springfield Armory with a set of new, more precise machines and a system of gauging that made it possible for the first time to achieve, in the late 1840s, the long-desired goal of interchangeability of parts in military small arms. Under his tutelage, Eli Whitney, Jr. equipped the Whitney Armory to do likewise.|$|R
40|$|In this report, {{we examine}} twelve digital-born news media organisations across four {{different}} European markets: France, Germany, Spain, and the UK. The organisations covered include {{a mixture of}} domestic for-profit, domestic non-profit, and international players. We find that [...] . First, that European digital-born news media are clearly rooted in the profession of journalism. The organisations we cover are generally launched by journalists, often senior ones with experience of legacy media, and not businesspeople or technologists (and generally operating without <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>major</b> investment that has fuelled the expansion of some US-based international brands). Producing quality journalism or having social impact are more prominent goals than delivering digital innovation or building lucrative new media businesses. Second, that digital-born news media are generally more prominent in Spain and France, with relatively weak legacy news media, than in Germany and the UK where legacy media remain strong. In every market, they are significantly smaller in terms of reach, revenue, and editorial resources than major legacy news media. New journalistic ventures seem to have found the most success where old ones are weak, rather than where digital media are most widely used or where the online advertising market is most developed. Third, while different in some important ways, we find that European digital-born news media organisations are similar in many respects to legacy media. Some interesting journalism is being done, but the cases covered are generally not necessarily more innovative than leading legacy media {{in terms of their}} funding models, distribution strategies, or editorial priorities. This reflects their focus on journalism over business and technology. Fourth, digital-born and legacy news media face very similar challenges online, especially around funding and distribution. In terms of funding, the online advertising market remains difficult for all content producers and progress with signing up subscribers is generally gradual. As a result, digital-born organisations are trying many of the same approaches – video, native advertising, various pay models, and commercial diversification – as their legacy counterparts. Firm figures are hard to come by, but the available evidence suggests most digital-born media are at best financially stable and not highly profitable. In terms of distribution, the shift from a direct relation between producer and users to one increasingly intermediated by search engines and social media represents the same combination of challenges and opportunities to digital-born news media as for legacy media. Our more detailed analysis covers three related areas: funding models, distribution strategies, and editorial priorities...|$|R
40|$|The most {{successful}} example of large lattice-mismatched epitaxial growth of semiconductors is {{the growth of}} III-nitrides on sapphire, leading to the award of the Nobel Prize in 2014 and great success in developing InGaN-based blue emitters. However, the majority of achievements {{in the field of}} III-nitride optoelectronics are mainly limited to polar GaN grown on c-plane (0001) sapphire. This polar orientation poses a number of fundamental issues, such as reduced quantum efficiency, efficiency droop, green and yellow gap in wavelength coverage, etc. To date, it is still a great challenge to develop longer wavelength devices such as green and yellow emitters. One clear way forward would be to grow III-nitride device structures along a semi-/non-polar direction, in particular, a semi-polar orientation, which potentially leads to both enhanced indium incorporation into GaN and reduced quantum confined Stark effects. This review presents recent progress on developing semi-polar GaN overgrowth technologies on sapphire or Si substrates, <b>the</b> two <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>major</b> substrates which are cost-effective and thus industry-compatible, and also demonstrates the latest achievements on electrically injected InGaN emitters with long emission wavelengths up to and including amber on overgrown semi-polar GaN.

New York City's Department of Environmental Protection insisted that any new roads over the aqueduct bridge it to protect the aging pipeline from damage that vibrations from trucks passing overhead could cause.Since Drury crosses the aqueduct north of the interstate on relatively level ground, a bridge would have added considerable expense to the project. However, a federally required 1999 value engineering study recommended instead rerouting Drury to make a four-way intersection at Stone Castle Road and Route 17K. While at the time there were some other issues seen as holding this up, eventually this was the option chosen.|$|R
30|$|At present {{conventional}} bipolar resectoscopy {{is widely}} recognized as first choice procedure for major hysteroscopic operations [1, 2]. We have proposed an alternative approach to operative hysteroscopy called IBS® Integrated Bigatti Shaver [3] that improving the visualization during the procedure, as the tissue chips are removed from the uterine cavity {{at the same time}} of resection, reduces several problems of conventional resectoscopy such as fluid overload and water intoxication with a lower risk of uterine perforation. In cooperation with Karl Storz GmbH & Co., we have created a new shaving system that, introduced through a straight operative channel of a panoramic 90 ° optic, allows performing all <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>major</b> hysteroscopic operations. We have recently published the first randomized comparative study [4], designed in order to compare 50 cases performed with conventional bipolar resectoscope with 50 cases performed with <b>the</b> IBS®. All <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>major</b> intrauterine pathologies such as polyps up to 6  cm and G 0, G 1 and G 2 sub-mucosal myomas, classified according to the ESGE guidelines, up to 3  cm in diameter were included in the study [5].

40|$|We examine <b>the</b> two <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>major</b> {{energetic}} {{phenomena that}} occur in the solar atmosphere: eruptive and confined events. The former describes flares with associated coronal mass ejections (CMEs), while the latter denotes flares without associated CMEs. We find that about 90 % of X-class flares are eruptive, but the remaining 10 % are confined. To probe why the largest energy releases could be either eruptive or confined, we investigate four X-class events from each of the two types. Both sets of events are selected to have very similar intensities (X 1. 0 to X 3. 6) and duration (rise time under 13 minutes and decay time not over 9 minutes) in soft X-ray observations, to reduce any bias due to flare size on CME occurrence. We find that the occurrence of eruption (or confinement) is sensitive to the displacement of the location of the energy release, defined as the distance between the flare site and the flux-weighted magnetic center of the source active region. The displacement is 6 - 17 Mm for confined events but as large as 22 - 37 Mm for eruptive events. This means that confined events occur closer to the magnetic center, while the eruptive events tend to occur close to the edge of active regions. We use the potential field source-surface model to infer the coronal magnetic field above the source active regions and calculate the flux ratio of low (1. 1 Rs) corona. We find that the confined events have a lower ratio ( 7. 1). These results imply that a stronger overlying arcade field may prevent energy releases in the low corona from being eruptive, resulting in flares, but without CMEs...|$|R

No deleterious effect was observed on two human cells, MRCs (lung normal cell) and CRL- 1539 (colon normal cell) when cells subjected to low concentration of essential oils from 1 - 10 µl mL- 1, while by increasing concentration to 25 µg/ml the number of surviving cells was decreased. At 100 µl mL- 1 the percentages of surviving cells were 37, 44, 46 and 61 % for marjoram, garlic, thyme and cinnamon. Metamorphoses and malformations in bacterial cells structure were shown by using 6 µl mL- 1 of garlic, cinnamon, marjoram and thyme oils...|$|R
