5|$|The 1959 Hebgen Lake {{earthquake}} {{just west}} of Yellowstone at Hebgen Lake damaged roads and some structures in the park. In the northwest section of the park, new geysers were found, and many existing hot springs became <b>turbid.</b> It was the most powerful earthquake to hit the region in recorded history.|$|E
5|$|Various {{types of}} aquatic {{habitats}} {{are used by}} different crocodilians. Some species are relatively more terrestrial and prefer swamps, ponds, and the edges of lakes, where they can bask {{in the sun and}} there is plenty of plant life supporting a diverse fauna. Others spend more time in the water and inhabit the lower stretches of rivers, mangrove swamps, and estuaries. These habitats also have a rich flora and provide plenty of food. The Asian gharials find the fish on which they feed in the pools and backwaters of swift rivers. South American dwarf caimans inhabit cool, fast-flowing streams, often near waterfalls, and other caimans live in warmer, <b>turbid</b> lakes and slow-moving rivers. The crocodiles are mainly river dwellers, and the Chinese alligator is found in slow-moving, <b>turbid</b> rivers flowing across China's floodplains. The American alligator is an adaptable species and inhabits swamps, rivers, or lakes with clear or <b>turbid</b> water. Climatic factors also affect crocodilians' distribution locally. During the dry season, caimans can be restricted to deep pools in rivers for several months; in the rainy season, much of the savannah in the Venezuelan llanos is flooded, and they disperse widely across the plain. Desert crocodiles in Mauritania have adapted to their arid environment by staying in caves or burrows in a state of aestivation during the driest periods. When it rains, the reptiles gather at gueltas.|$|E
5|$|Ninety {{percent or}} more of {{smallpox}} cases among unvaccinated persons were of the ordinary type. In this form of the disease, by {{the second day of the}} rash the macules became raised papules. By the third or fourth day the papules filled with an opalescent fluid to become vesicles. This fluid became opaque and <b>turbid</b> within 24–48 hours, giving them the appearance of pustules; however, the so-called pustules were filled with tissue debris, not pus.|$|E
5|$|Though the Pacific {{electric}} ray will feed at any hour, it responds to prey {{much more quickly}} at night than during the day. Most prey captures occur in darkness or <b>turbid</b> conditions, when its eyes are largely useless. Instead, it relies on electroreception via its ampullae of Lorenzini to locate food. Experiments in the field have shown that it will attack artificially generated electric fields and conductive metal electrodes. Mechanical sensory cues, detected via the lateral line, also play an important role: this species has been observed preferentially attacking faster-moving prey even if a closer food item was available.|$|E
5|$|At {{least five}} hot springs exist in valleys near Mount Cayley, {{providing}} more evidence for magmatic activity. This includes springs found at Shovelnose Creek and <b>Turbid</b> Creek {{on the southern}} flank of Mount Cayley and Brandywine Creek on the eastern flank of the volcanic field. They are generally found in areas of volcanic activity that are geologically young. As the regional surface water percolates downward through rocks below the Mount Cayley field, it reaches areas of high temperatures surrounding an active or recently solidified magma reservoir. Here, the water is heated, becomes less dense and rises {{back to the surface}} along fissures or cracks. These features are sometimes referred to as dying volcanoes because they seem to represent the last stage of volcanic activity as the magma at depth cools and hardens.|$|E
5|$|Occurring {{close to}} shore from the surf zone {{to a depth}} of , the milk shark favors <b>turbid</b> water off sandy beaches and {{occasionally}} enters estuaries. In Shark Bay, Western Australia, juvenile milk sharks inhabit seagrass meadows composed of Amphibolis antarctica and Posidonia australis. Although some sources state this species avoids low salinities, it has been reported several times from fresh water in Cambodia, as far upstream as the Tonlé Sap. Milk sharks may be found anywhere in the water column from the surface to the bottom. Off KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, its numbers fluctuate annually with a peak in summer, suggesting some form of seasonal movement.|$|E
5|$|The {{taxonomy}} of Scleractinia is particularly challenging. Many species were described {{before the advent}} of scuba diving, with little realisation by the authors that coral species could have varying morphologies in different habitats. Collectors were mostly limited to observing corals on reef flats, and were unable to observe the changes in morphology that occurred in more <b>turbid,</b> deeper-water conditions. More than 2,000 nominal species were described in this era, and by the rules of nomenclature, the name given to the first described species has precedence over the rest, even when that description is poor, and the environment and even sometimes the country of the type specimen is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Despite being mostly solitary, {{sirenians}} congregate {{in groups}} while females are in estrus. These groups usually include one female with multiple males. Sirenians are K-selectors, so, despite the longevity, females give birth {{only a few}} times during their life and invest considerable parental care in their young. Dugongs generally gather in groups of less than a dozen individuals for one to two days. Since they congregate in <b>turbid</b> waters, little is known about their reproductive behavior. The males are often seen with scars, and the tusks on dugongs grow in first for males, suggesting they are important in lekking. They have also been known to lunge at each other. The age when a female first gives birth is disputed, ranging anywhere from six to seventeen years. The time between births is unclear, with estimates ranging from 2 to 7 years. Manatees can reach sexual maturity as early as two to five years of age. Manatee gestation length is around one year, and then they lactate for one to two years. West Indian manatees and African manatees can breed year-round, and a female will mate with multiple male partners. Amazonian manatees have a breeding season, usually mating when the river levels begin to rise, which varies from place to place.|$|E

25|$|Giant river prawns live in <b>turbid</b> freshwater, {{but their}} larval stages require {{brackish}} water to survive.|$|E
25|$|<b>Turbid</b> (cloudy) urine may be {{a symptom}} of a {{bacterial}} infection, but can also be caused by crystallization of salts such as calcium phosphate.|$|E
25|$|Gotland gives {{its name}} to the {{traditional}} farmhouse ale Gotlandsdricka, a <b>turbid</b> beer with much in common with Finnish sahti, and related beers from the Baltic states.|$|E
25|$|The Arago point, {{named after}} its discoverer, is customarily located at about 20° above the antisolar point; but it lies at higher altitudes in <b>turbid</b> air. The latter {{property}} makes the Arago distance a useful measure of atmospheric turbidity.|$|E
25|$|Clogging or bioclogging of geotextiles, geonets, geopipe and/or geocomposites is a {{challenging}} design for certain soil types or unusual situations. For example, loess soils, fine cohesionless silts, highly <b>turbid</b> liquids, and microorganism laden liquids (farm runoff) are troublesome and generally require specialized testing evaluations.|$|E
25|$|The small {{teeth of}} the Irrawaddy river shark {{suggests}} that it mainly preys on fish, while its small eyes {{are consistent with the}} extremely <b>turbid</b> water in which it hunts. Reproduction is presumably viviparous, with the young sustained by a placental connection, as in other requiem sharks.|$|E
25|$|P. praelongus is not {{in general}} cultivation, though it is an {{attractive}} plant. Unlike many other pondweeds it remains wintergreen. In common with other pondweeds of this group it roots poorly from stem cuttings and is best propagated by division of the rhizomes. Its preference for relatively deep water and intolerance of <b>turbid</b> conditions may make it unsuitable for many garden ponds. If possible it should be grown in water at least 70cm deep on a sandy, peaty or silty substrate. Good water quality is needed {{to reduce the risk}} of <b>turbid</b> water or growth of blanket weed. Seed can be encouraged to germinate by immersing dried seed in water for at least a month, exposing them to a cold period, or by scarifying them.|$|E
25|$|The species {{lives in}} a variety of inshore habitats, {{generally}} present in waters 30 to 140 m deep on coral and rocky reefs. Juveniles tend to school in shallow sandy bays and are able to tolerate moderately <b>turbid</b> waters. At least one recorded capture from an estuary in Thailand has been reported.|$|E
25|$|The eggs of C. aeneus {{exhibit a}} unique surface pattern with small villi-like protuberances which {{resemble}} attaching-filaments of teleost eggs. These structures allow the eggs to be adhesive {{and stick to}} a specific place or to each other. The presence of these structures {{may be related to}} the <b>turbid</b> habitat in which this species lives.|$|E
25|$|The bumpnose {{trevally}} is an inshore fish, rarely venturing to depths {{greater than}} 50 m. It inhabits sandy bays and beaches, {{and appears to}} be quite tolerant of <b>turbid</b> waters, often living in the dirty waters near river mouths. Despite this, it appears to have a fairly low tolerance to reduced salinities and is not found in estuaries themselves.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the last}} night of {{swimming}} finals, the filtration system broke down and the pool was <b>turbid</b> and murky during the warmup session and the finals; it was described as the least clear ever seen for a swimming competition. A disproportionate number of swimmers fell ill with intestinal complaints, leading to concerns over the cleanliness and sanitation of the pool.|$|E
25|$|The {{euphotic}} depth is {{the depth}} at which light intensity falls to 1% {{of the value}} at the surface. This depth is dependent upon water clarity, being only a few metres underwater in a <b>turbid</b> estuary, but may reach up to 200 metres in the open ocean. At the euphotic depth, plants (such as phytoplankton) have no net energy gain from photosynthesis and thus cannot grow.|$|E
25|$|Ocean {{waters that}} are {{exceptionally}} clear contain little food. Areas of high productivity {{tend to be}} somewhat <b>turbid</b> from plankton blooms. These attract the filter feeding plankton eaters, which in turn attract the higher predators. Tuna fishing tends to be optimum when water turbidity, measured by the maximum depth a secchi disc can be seen during a sunny day, is 15 to 35 metres.|$|E
25|$|The {{torpedo scad}} is a pelagic {{schooling}} species which {{is found in}} both far offshore oceanic environments {{as well as more}} protected inshore environments. The fish commonly are found in the upper water column near the surface waters. It is not found in estuaries and appears to be intolerant of dirty or <b>turbid</b> waters. The range of the species extends to more southern waters in summer as the warm waters push further down the coasts.|$|E
25|$|The longnose {{trevally}} is an inshore fish, normally {{found on}} coastal reefs and occasionally in large protected bays. It {{appears to be}} more tolerant of dirty, <b>turbid</b> waters than most of it relatives, but is not seen in estuaries. Juveniles reportedly inhabit shallow bays close to the coast, and are occasionally seen near beaches. Adults live in much deeper water, normally between 30 and 60 m, although have been recorded at depths of around 90 m.|$|E
25|$|Cell {{suspensions}} are <b>turbid.</b> Cells {{absorb and}} scatter the light. The higher the cell concentration, {{the higher the}} turbidity. Spectrophotometers can measure intensity of light very accurately. The cell culture is placed in a transparent cuvette and the absorption is measured relative to medium alone. Optical density (OD) is directly proportional to the biomass in the cell suspension in a given range that is specific to the cell type. Using spectrophotometry for measuring the turbidity of cultures is known as turbidometry.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{key factors}} {{associated}} with the toxicity of CYN is its stability. Although the toxin {{has been found to}} degrade rapidly in an algal extract when exposed to sunlight, it is resistant to degradation by changes in pH and temperature, and shows no degradation in either the pure solid form or in pure water. As a result, in <b>turbid</b> and unmoving water the toxin can persist for long periods, and although boiling water will kill the cyanobacteria, it may not remove the toxin.|$|E
25|$|The Puyallup River and {{its main}} tributaries {{originate}} in the glaciers of Mount Rainier. These glaciers continually provide sediment such as silt and gravel to the rivers, creating sand and gravel bars. The thick sediment deposits in the stream beds lower water capacity, which causes the river to meander and flood during periods of high streamflow. It also causes the rivers to become braided and meandering. During the summer glacial meltwater dominates the streamflow, turning the Puyallup River <b>turbid.</b> In addition, the glaciers delay the onset of spring-summer runoff, compared to unglaciated river basins.|$|E
25|$|The genuine {{color of}} egg spots is a yellow, red or orange inner circle with a colorless ring {{surrounding}} the shape. Through phylogenetic analysis, using the mitochondrial ND2 gene, {{it was hypothesized}} that the true egg spots evolved in the common ancestor of the Astatoreochromis-lineage and the modern Haplochrominis. This ancestor was most likely riverine in origin, based upon the most parsimonious representation of habitat type in the cichlid family. The presence of egg-spots in a <b>turbid</b> riverine environment, would seem particularly beneficial and necessary for intra-species communication.|$|E
25|$|The {{lionfish}} is {{a predator}} {{native to the}} Indo-Pacific. It aggressively preys on small fish and invertebrates. They can be found around the seaward edge of reefs and coral, in lagoons, and on rocky surfaces commonly to 50 m deep. Though lionfish have on multiple occasions been recorded to 300 m depth. They show a preference for <b>turbid</b> inshore areas and in harbors, and have a generally hostile attitude and are territorial towards other reef fish. Many universities in the Indo-Pacific have documented reports of Pterois aggression towards divers and researchers.|$|E
25|$|Both ASR and aerial {{respiration}} require fish {{to travel}} to the top of water column and this behaviour increases the predation risks by aerial predators or other piscivores inhabiting near the surface of the water. In order to cope with the increased predation risk upon surfacing, some fish perform ASR or aerial respiration in schools in order to ‘dilute’ the predation risk. When fish can visually detect the presence of their aerial predators, they simply refrain from surfacing, or prefer to surface in areas where they can be detected less easily (i.e. <b>turbid,</b> shaded areas).|$|E
25|$|Dolomite in the Darby Formation of Devonian age differs {{greatly from}} the Bighorn Dolomite; {{that in the}} Darby is dark-brown to almost black, has an oily smell, and {{contains}} layers of black, pink, and yellow mudstone and thin sandstone. The sea bottom during deposition of these rocks was foul and frequently the water was <b>turbid.</b> Abundant fossil fragments indicate fishes were common for the first time. Exposures of the Darby Formation are recognizable by their distinctive dull-yellow thin-layered slopes between the prominent gray massive cliffs of formations below and above.|$|E
25|$|Otter {{trawling}} derives {{its name}} from the large rectangular otter boards which are used to keep the mouth of the trawl net open. Otter boards are made of timber or steel and are positioned {{in such a way that}} the hydrodynamic forces, acting on them when the net is towed along the seabed, push them outwards and prevent the mouth of the net from closing. They also act like a plough, digging up to 15cm into the seabed, creating a <b>turbid</b> cloud, and scaring fish towards the net mouth.|$|E
25|$|Jellyfish populations may be {{expanding}} globally as {{a result}} of overfishing of their natural predators and the availability of excessive nutrients due to land runoff. When marine ecosystems become disturbed jellyfish can proliferate. For example, jellyfish reproduce rapidly and have fast growth rates; they predate many species, while few species predate them; and they feed via touch rather than visually, so they can feed effectively at night and in <b>turbid</b> waters. It may become difficult for fish stocks to reestablish themselves in marine ecosystems once they have become dominated by jellyfish, because jellyfish feed on plankton, which includes fish eggs and larvae.|$|E
25|$|Lactic acid {{bacteria}} have {{a useful}} role in winemaking converting malic acid to lactic acid in malolactic fermentation. However, after this function has completed, the bacteria {{may still be}} present within the wine, where they can metabolise other compounds and produce wine faults. Wines that have not undergone malolactic fermentation may be contaminated with lactic acid bacteria, leading to refermentation of the wine with it becoming <b>turbid,</b> swampy, and slightly effervescent or spritzy. This can be avoided by sterile filtering wine directly before bottling. Lactic acid bacteria can also be responsible for other wine faults such as those below.|$|E
25|$|Epipelagic fish {{inhabit the}} epipelagic zone. The epipelagic zone is {{the water from}} the surface of the sea down to 200 metres. It is also {{referred}} to as the surface waters or the sunlit zone, and includes the photic zone. The photic zone is defined as the surface waters down to the point where the sunlight has attenuated to 1% of the surface value. This depth depends on how <b>turbid</b> the water is, but in clear water can extend to 200 metres, coinciding with the epipelagic zone. The photic zone has sufficient light for phytoplankton to photosynthese.|$|E
25|$|With {{increasing}} depth underwater, sunlight is absorbed, and {{the amount}} of visible light diminishes. Because absorption is greater for long wavelengths (red end of the visible spectrum) than for short wavelengths (blue end of the visible spectrum), the colour spectrum is rapidly altered with increasing depth. White objects at the surface appear bluish underwater, and red objects appear dark, even black. Although light penetration will be less if water is <b>turbid,</b> in the very clear water of the open ocean less than 25% of the surface light reaches a depth of 10 m (33feet). At 100m (330ft) the light present from the sun is normally about 0.5% of that at the surface.|$|E
