50|$|Much of the town's {{early history}} {{surrounds}} <b>the</b> <b>bishops</b> <b>of</b> Durham and <b>the</b> {{establishment of a}} hunting lodge, which later became the main residence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bishops</b> <b>of</b> Durham.

5|$|The Reims council also {{condemned}} {{and ordered}} the arrest of Éon de l'Étoile, a Breton heretic. He was eventually tortured into confession and imprisoned {{until his death in}} 1150. Further decrees condemned the Anacletans, supporters of an earlier antipope, who had previously been condemned in 1136. Further side business was the settling of a dispute between two Norman abbots– Eustachius of Jumieges Abbey and Robert of the Abbey of St. Vincent, Le Mans, which was handed to two cardinals to decide. The two prelates reached a decision on 5 April. Other disputes, including ones between abbots, were also handled at the council, although not necessarily during the council deliberations. Also included in the council's business was the confirmation of the excommunication of <b>the</b> <b>Bishop</b> <b>of</b> Dol and <b>the</b> <b>Bishop</b> <b>of</b> Brieux. Although it was reported that <b>the</b> <b>Bishop</b> <b>of</b> Orleans and <b>the</b> <b>Bishop</b> <b>of</b> Troyes were deposed by the council, this is erroneous, and probably stemmed from the number of ecclesiastics who were suspended for non-attendance.|$|E
5|$|The {{church in}} Northumbria {{was one of}} the major landowners, perhaps second only to the king. At the head of the Northumbrian church was the Archbishop of York, an office held by Eanbald I to 796, Eanbald II until some time after 808, and then by Wulfsige to around 830. Immediately below the {{archbishop}} were three bishops: <b>the</b> <b>bishop</b> <b>of</b> Lindisfarne, <b>the</b> <b>bishop</b> <b>of</b> Hexham and <b>the</b> <b>bishop</b> <b>of</b> Whithorn. The typically long term of office of senior clerics meant that kings often had to work with men appointed by their predecessors, with whom their relations might be difficult.|$|E
5|$|A pope is <b>the</b> <b>Bishop</b> <b>of</b> Rome and {{the leader}} of the Catholic Church. Approximately 100 papal tombs are at least {{partially}} extant, representing {{less than half of the}} 264 deceased popes, from Saint Peter to Saint John Paul II.|$|E

5|$|Before Becket {{returned}} to England, on 1 December 1170, he excommunicated Roger, {{as well as}} Gilbert Foliot <b>the</b> <b>Bishop</b> <b>of</b> Lincoln and Josceline de Bohon <b>the</b> <b>Bishop</b> <b>of</b> Salisbury. After Becket landed in England the three excommunicates went to Becket and asked for absolution, but while Becket was willing to absolve Gilbert and Josceline, he insisted that only the pope could absolve an archbishop. Roger persuaded the others that they should stick together, and all three went to King Henry in Normandy, to secure the king's permission for their appeals to Rome.|$|E

5000|$|Justinian was {{the first}} to use (in 531) the title of [...] "patriarch" [...] to {{designate}} exclusively <b>the</b> <b>bishops</b> <b>of</b> Rome, Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem, setting <b>the</b> <b>bishops</b> <b>of</b> these five sees on a level superior to that of metropolitans.|$|R
5|$|Foliot {{supported}} his uncle Robert de Chesney's nomination to become Bishop of Lincoln, lobbying the pope on Robert's behalf, {{and maintaining a}} long correspondence with Robert after his elevation. The letters to this uncle are full of warm sentiments, more than would be expected of a dutiful correspondence. Other episcopal correspondents and friends included Roger de Pont L'Évêque, the Archbishop of York, Josceline de Bohon, <b>the</b> <b>Bishop</b> <b>of</b> Salisbury, and William de Turbeville, <b>the</b> <b>Bishop</b> <b>of</b> Norwich, who became a regular correspondent after Foliot was translated to London.|$|E
5|$|Foliot was a {{canon of}} Lincoln Cathedral by 1147, and an {{official}} of Alexander of Lincoln, <b>the</b> <b>Bishop</b> <b>of</b> Lincoln, who secured Foliot's early promotions in the church. Foliot {{was sent to the}} Council of Reims in 1148 by the Lincoln cathedral chapter to learn Pope Eugene III's wishes regarding the vacant bishopric, as Alexander had died in February 1148. Henry of Blois, <b>the</b> <b>Bishop</b> <b>of</b> Winchester, was attempting to secure Lincoln for one of his nephews, but the pope agreed with the chapter and appointed Robert de Chesney as bishop instead. After his consecration, Chesney continued to employ Foliot as a clerk.|$|E

5|$|In 1189 Coutances held an ecclesiastical synod which legislated, {{among other}} things, that the clergy should not hold secular offices, even though Coutances himself had held and {{continued}} to hold such offices. On 9 November 1189 Richard appointed Coutances to a commission tasked with deciding the dispute between Baldwin of Forde and the monks of his cathedral chapter over Baldwin's plan to create a church dedicated to Thomas Becket, the murdered Archbishop of Canterbury, and to staff this church not with monks, but with canons. The monks of Canterbury Cathedral objected to Baldwin's plan, fearing that {{it was part of}} a plot to transfer the right of election from the monastic cathedral chapter to the new church's canons. Sitting on the commission with Coutances were Hugh de Puiset, <b>the</b> <b>Bishop</b> <b>of</b> Durham, Godfrey de Lucy, <b>the</b> <b>Bishop</b> <b>of</b> Winchester, Hubert Walter, <b>the</b> <b>Bishop</b> <b>of</b> Salisbury, Peter de Leia, <b>the</b> <b>Bishop</b> <b>of</b> St David's, Richard fitzNigel, the Bishop-elect of London, William Longchamp, the Bishop-elect of Ely, and some abbots. The commission travelled to Canterbury, and on 29 November 1189, managed to secure a compromise between the parties, which lasted until Hubert Walter, by then Archbishop of Canterbury, revived the plan. In the compromise, Baldwin agreed to give up the idea of a new monastic foundation around Canterbury and the monks agreed to submit to the archbishop's authority.|$|E
5|$|In 1201 Walter {{went on a}} {{diplomatic}} mission to Philip II of France, which was unsuccessful, and in 1202 he returned to England as regent while John was abroad. In April 1204 Walter returned to France with John de Gray <b>the</b> <b>Bishop</b> <b>of</b> Norwich, Eustace <b>the</b> <b>Bishop</b> <b>of</b> Ely, William Marshal, and Robert de Beaumont the Earl of Leicester to seek peace with Philip Augustus. Philip insisted that John hand over Arthur of Brittany, Arthur's sister Eleanor, and renounce all of his continental possessions before the French king would make peace. John refused to do this, and the embassy returned to England not long before Philip conquered Normandy.|$|E

5|$|In April 1190 Baldwin left England with Richard on the Third Crusade. Leading the English advance guard, Baldwin left Marseilles {{ahead of}} Richard {{together}} with Hubert Walter and Ranulf de Glanvill. The group sailed directly to Syria on 5 August 1190. Baldwin delegated {{the administration of}} his spiritualities and temporalities to Gilbert Glanvill, <b>the</b> <b>Bishop</b> <b>of</b> Rochester, but entrusted any archiepiscopal authority to Richard FitzNeal, <b>the</b> <b>Bishop</b> <b>of</b> London. The custom of giving the archiepiscopal authority to London had originated in Archbishop Lanfranc's time. Baldwin continued to conduct some ecclesiastical business however, dealing with the suspended Hugh Nonant, <b>the</b> <b>Bishop</b> <b>of</b> Coventry. Baldwin had suspended Nonant in March 1190 for holding secular office as sheriff, but Baldwin wrote to FitzNeal after his departure that Nonant had agreed to relinquish his secular offices.|$|E
5|$|One {{of the new}} {{generation}} of bishops was <b>the</b> <b>bishop</b> <b>of</b> Olinda, Dom Vital. In 1872, he expelled Freemasons from lay brotherhoods. All forms of Freemasonry had long been forbidden to all Catholics under pain of excommunication.|$|E
5|$|Possibly {{related to}} Hugh de Puiset <b>the</b> <b>bishop</b> <b>of</b> Durham, who {{he went on}} to serve later in life, Blois {{probably}} came from Blois in France. His relationship with Puiset reinforces the likelihood of his origins being in Blois, as Puiset was a nephew of King Stephen of England and Stephen's brother Henry of Blois, <b>the</b> <b>Bishop</b> <b>of</b> Winchester, both of whom came from Blois. Nothing else is known of Blois' origins. He was titled magister, implying that he attended a university and was well-educated. He taught at the school of Paris for a while, where at one point a townswoman tried to seduce him, resulting in the medieval writer Gerald of Wales later recounting the humorous story of how Blois resisted the lady's advances.|$|E
