This study (leadership styles, types and students’ academic achievement in Nigeria) examined whether the principal’s leadership styles-types, his gender, highest educational qualification and experience as a principal do play their contributing influence in the school performance as well as students' academic achievement. Finally, the study intends to propose the leadership model for the Nigerian school principals. The research design used is a quantitative descriptive cross-sectional survey research design. Theoretical <b>or</b> <b>educational</b> <b>gap,</b> locational gap, and the approach gap were identified. In the research process, the researcher utilized two inventory questionnaires and the field form that was validated by a panel of experts. Stratified random sampling with 480 teachers and 60 principals employed, but only 380 teachers and 57 principals responded. ANOVA, z-test, correlation, percentage and mean were used. Principals’ experience and his highest qualification are significant. ANOVA produced from principal’s experience (F = 5. 207, p = 0. 031; F = 9. 713, p = 0. 002) and principals’ qualification (F = 7. 607, p = 0. 000). The majority of the principals served for more than five years as a principal, principal’s gender has no significance, except when interacted with his qualification or experience; with p-values 0. 002, 0. 004, and 0. 027 respectively. Furthermore, democratic leadership style and transformational leadership type found mostly practiced for in term of maintaining or improving students’ academic achievement. Majority of principals do not practice authoritarian and laissez-faire leadership styles. Principals practiced four combinations of leaderships: - Authoritarian style combined with transactional type, Democratic style combined with either transformational type, or transactional type, or with instructional type. Both the teachers and the principals have the same perception on the leadership style and type ran by the principals. These are the basis for formulating the Nigerian principal leadership model that was proposed. Conclusively, the leadership styles and types that maintain or raise the academic achievement of students enumerated, principal’s academic qualification and experience are significant, while his gender has no significance except when interacted with either his highest <b>educational</b> qualification <b>or</b> experiences and the Nigerian principals’ leadership model proposed...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effects of divorce on <b>educational</b> <b>gaps</b> in mothers' economic resources. The results shed new light on two opposing theoretical positions that have informed research on social inequality in the consequences of divorce. Recent extensions of the 'diverging destinies' perspective posit that divorce is more consequential among the disadvantaged than among the privileged. The notion of 'divorce as an equalizer' posits the reverse. Based on data from the German SOEP, we estimated correlated random-effects models to examine <b>educational</b> <b>gaps</b> in divorce-related changes of mothers' household income and risk of poverty. The results are inconsistent with the diverging destinies perspective, as <b>educational</b> <b>gaps</b> in mothers' economic resources did not widen after divorce. Instead, we found partial support for the competing notion of divorce as an equalizer, as higher educated mothers experienced larger declines in household income. <b>Educational</b> <b>gaps</b> {{in the risk of}} poverty remained constant...|$|R

To {{characterize}} {{female adolescents}} {{who have been}} pregnant, and to analyze the association between adolescent pregnancy and <b>educational</b> <b>gaps.</b> Materials and methods. A cross-sectional study was conducted. Data come from the Encuesta Nacional de Salud y Nutrición (Ensanut 2012), a Mexican representative survey. The set of data used is related to sociodemographic and reproductive characteristics from 1 790 women from 12 to 19 years who had begun their sexual life and had a pregnancy record. Three statistical models were adjusted to observe the association between variables. The dependent variable of the first model was the condition of previous pregnancy, the second to be pregnant {{at the time of}} data collection, and the third, <b>educational</b> <b>gap.</b> Results. A 74. 9 % of the adolescents with history of pregnancy has <b>educational</b> <b>gap.</b> To have the condition of previous pregnancy is associated with living with sexual partner (OR= 8. 4), <b>educational</b> <b>gap</b> (OR= 2. 4), low socioeconomical level (OR= 2. 0) and school assistance (OR= 0. 5). To be pregnant at the time of data collection has related only to living with sexual partner (OR= 9. 4). The <b>educational</b> <b>gap</b> shows an association with having more than one pregnancy (OR= 2. 4), live with sexual partner (OR= 1. 6), low socioeconomical level (OR= 1. 8), and school assistance as protective factor (OR= 0. 3). Conclusion. It is necessary to implement effective and efficient educational public politics in order to decrease <b>educational</b> <b>gap.</b> At the same time, to guarantee and improve sexual education in the school system to prevent adolescent pregnancy...|$|R

The objective {{of this study was to}} understand the approach to hematologic diseases, common standards of care and best practices, issues that remain controversial <b>or</b> debated, and <b>educational</b> <b>or</b> resource <b>gaps</b> that warrant attention. We used mobile application to disseminate and distribute questionnaires to delegates during the 6 th international hematologic malignancies conference hosted by the APAC Hematology Consortium at Beijing, China. User responses were collected in an anonymous fashion. We report survey results in two ways: the overall responses, and responses as stratified between Chinese physicians and 'Other' represented nationalities. Overall geographical concordance in survey responses was positive and strong. Perhaps more interesting than instances of absolute agreement, these data provide a unique opportunity to identify topics in which physician knowledge or opinions diverge. We assigned questions from all modules to broad categories of: patient information; diagnosis; treatment preference; transplantation; and general knowledge/opinion. On average, we observed a geographic difference of 15 % for any particular answer choice, and this was fairly constant across survey modules. These results reveal utility and need for widespread and ongoing initiatives to assess knowledge and provide evidence-based education in real time. The data will be made more valuable by longitudinal participation, such that we can monitor changes in the state of the art over time. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

We consider individual and contextual influences on the core association between education and health, and assess {{gender differences in the}} process of cumulative advantage. Our overall results support the cumulative advantage hypothesis, as health gaps between higher and lower educated people widen with age. Further analyses reveal that this process is gender specific.

In conjunction with this rise in population is the concern that Hispanics may find limited economic opportunities in the future. One means to evaluate this concern is to understand how {{an increase in the}} Hispanic population effects the growth of Hispanic-‐owned businesses. As with other segments of the population, business ownership is one path toward larger incomes and increased economic security for Hispanic individuals. This study used ordinary least squares regressions to create an econometric model to determine how Hispanic business growth is affected by the economic and demographic characteristics of an area. This study determined that total population, Hispanic population, total average education, and Hispanic average education have a positive relationship with the number and total sales of Hispanic businesses. In addition, it was determined that an <b>educational</b> <b>gap</b> exists between the total population and the Hispanic population in Oregon, and this gap effects Hispanic business growth. To evaluate the effect of this gap {{on the future of the}} number and sales of Hispanic businesses, a forecasting model using future projected population estimates was used while varying the <b>educational</b> attainment <b>gap</b> between the Hispanic population and the total population. It was shown through this forecasting model that the <b>educational</b> attainment <b>gap</b> between the two populations has a dramatic effect on the future number and total sales of Hispanic businesses in Oregon, or Hispanic business growth overall. This demonstrates a need for the enactment of policies geared toward closing the <b>educational</b> <b>gap</b> by increasing the average educational attainment for the Hispanic population in order to help Hispanic businesses flourish in the future...|$|R

Policies supporting child care reduce the level of experienced work-family conflict; family leave policy appears to have no alleviating impact on working parents' work-family conflict. Our findings indicate that family policies appear to be unable to reduce the gender gap in conflict perception and even widen the <b>educational</b> <b>gap</b> in work-family conflict...|$|R
