Some productions (including one planned for June 2002 in Connecticut) have been cancelled because of objections.|$|E

The piece was Gilbert's biggest success to date, running for over 100 nights and being frequently revived and played continuously in the provinces for three years thereafter.|$|E

5|$|At {{about the}} same time as the realignments in Michigan, two-lane {{bypasses}} of Manitowoc and Port Washington in Wisconsin were opened in 1957. The state built a divided-highway segment <b>that</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> following year running from the Milwaukee area northward to the Ozaukee–Milwaukee county line. The highway was rerouted to run further inland, bypassing Haven, Wisconsin, in 1959. In late 1961, the highway in Michigan was rebuilt in northern Iron and southern Baraga counties between Amasa and Covington as the state smoothed out sharp corners in the routing and finished paving US141; a similar project was completed in 1972 south of Amasa to Crystal Falls.|$|E
5|$|Gaveston {{was once}} more forced into exile, but Edward {{recalled}} him {{in less than}} a year. The king had spent the intervening time gathering support, and at the time, the only one to resist the return of Gaveston was Warwick. With time, however, opposition to the king grew. Another source of contention was Edward abandoning his father's Scottish campaigns, a policy <b>that</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> Border region up to devastating raids from the Scots. This affected Warwick greatly, with his extensive landed interest in the north. Tensions grew {{to the point where the}} king in 1310 had to ban Warwick and others from arriving at parliament in arms. They still did, and at the parliament of March 1310, the king was forced to accept the appointment of a commission to draft a set of ordinances towards reform the royal government.|$|E
5|$|In 1967, Alaska celebrated 100 {{years since}} its {{purchase}} by the United States from Russia. To celebrate the event, Fairbanksans built A-67 (later Alaskaland and today Pioneer Park), {{a theme park}} celebrating the history of Fairbanks and Alaska. At a site away from downtown Fairbanks, it features pioneer cabins, historic exhibits, and the steamer SS Nenana, one of the steamboats that traveled Interior Alaska rivers during the gold rush era. The summer exposition <b>that</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> park in July 1967 was attended by U.S. Vice President Hubert Humphrey but was plagued by rain, financial problems, and low attendance.|$|E

5|$|The Committee on Territories again {{rejected}} Weaver's bill, but {{approved a}} compromise measure <b>that</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> Unassigned Lands, Cherokee Outlet, and Neutral Strip to settlement. Congress debated the bill over several months, while the tribes announced their resistance to their lands becoming a territory; {{according to an}} 1884 Supreme Court decision, Elkv. Wilkins, Native Americans were not citizens, and thus would have no voting rights in the new territory. When Weaver returned to Iowa to campaign for re-election, the bill was still in limbo. Running again on a Democratic–Greenback fusion ticket, Weaver was re-elected to the House in 1886 with a 618-vote majority.|$|E
5|$|The James F. Byrnes Bridge {{was built}} in 1956. It was a two-lane toll swing bridge {{constructed}} {{at a cost of}} $1.5 million <b>that</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> island to automobile traffic from the mainland. The swing bridge was hit by a barge in 1974 which shut down all vehicle traffic to the island until the Army Corps of Engineers built and manned a pontoon bridge while the bridge was being repaired. The swing bridge was replaced by the current four-lane bridge in 1982.|$|E
5|$|With {{the defeat}} of these German drives, I Corps {{conducted}} its first offensive mission, participating in the Second Battle of the Marne from 18 July until 6 August, {{which resulted in the}} reduction of the more important salients driven into Allied lines by the German offensives. After a brief period in the defensive sectors of Champagne and Lorraine between 7 August and 11 September, the corps took part in the St. Mihiel attack on 12 September, which reduced the German salient there during the next four days. Then followed another period on the defense in Lorraine as preparations advanced for what was to be the final Allied offensive of the war. On 26 September, I Corps troops began the attack northward <b>that</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> Meuse-Argonne Offensive. From that day until 11 November 1918 when the war ended, I Corps was constantly moving forward.|$|E

5|$|Down {{by three}} {{to start the}} second half, Georgia responded {{with a pair of}} touchdowns and took a 21–10 lead early in the third quarter. The first was scored on a three-yard Todd Gurley run that {{completed}} a 75-yard drive <b>that</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> quarter. The second came on a special teams play on the drive that ensued, when Cornelius Washington blocked a 49-yard Cade Foster field goal attempt that was recovered by Alec Ogletree and returned 55 yards for a touchdown and a 21–10 lead. Alabama responded on their next possession with a four-play, 77-yard drive that was capped by a 10-yard T. J. Yeldon touchdown run followed with Yeldon converting the two-point conversion on a two-yard run and made the score 21–18. After a Georgia three-and-out, Alabama took a 25–21 lead on the first play of the fourth quarter on a one-yard Lacy touchdown run behind the blocking of Jesse Williams.|$|E
5|$|The Tunisia battle {{sequence}} <b>that</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> {{film was}} the last major sequence filmed. The filmmakers wanted to avoid the appearance that von Stauffenberg wanted to kill Hitler because of the injuries he suffered in the battle. They began a rough cut in October 2007, and between then and June 2008, there were several test screenings without the battle sequence. By June 2008, the filmmakers felt that {{they knew how to}} adequately frame the characters when filming the battle sequence. Singer scouted Jordan and Spain for locations, but the candidates did not meet the aesthetic and economic criteria. The Cougar Buttes desert in California was ultimately chosen to represent Tunisia. Since the production budget was adjusted to provide visual effects to make von Stauffenberg's injuries realistic, not enough was left for solely computer-generated fighter planes. Singer instead used two P-40 Warhawks in the battle sequence. The budget increased in the course of production due to the filming in Germany, the rebuilding of sets, and lost shooting days, but German tax rebates tempered the growth. The studio reported its final production budget to be $75 million, but competing studios believed it to be closer to $90 million.|$|E
5|$|The {{first leg}} {{was held at}} the Emile Versé Stadium, the home ground of Anderlecht. It was the home side <b>that</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> scoring in the 17th minute. Striker Rob Rensenbrink {{advanced}} down the right-hand side of the pitch and passed the ball across the Liverpool penalty area towards midfielder Franky Vercauteren who headed the ball into the Liverpool goal. Five minutes later, Anderlecht came close to extending their lead, but Benny Nielsen's shot was saved by Liverpool goalkeeper Ray Clemence. Liverpool started to exert themselves upon the match following this and equalised in the 27th minute when midfielder Jimmy Case scored {{from the edge of the}} Anderlecht penalty area. Five minutes before half-time Anderlecht extended their lead. Defender François Van der Elst found space in the Liverpool defence and his shot beat Clemence in the Liverpool goal to give Anderlecht a 2–1 lead. Anderlecht defender Jean Thissen was shown a yellow card before the end of the half for a late tackle on Liverpool striker Kenny Dalglish.|$|E
