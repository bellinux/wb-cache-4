500|$|The portraits gave Van Gogh {{his best}} {{opportunity}} to earn. He {{believed they were}} [...] "the only thing in painting that moves me deeply and <b>that</b> <b>gives</b> <b>me</b> {{a sense of the}} infinite." [...] He wrote to his sister that he wished to paint portraits that would endure, and that he would use colour to capture their emotions and character rather than aiming for photographic realism. Those closest to Van Gogh are mostly absent from his portraits; he rarely painted Theo, Van Rappard or Bernard. The portraits of his mother were from photographs.|$|E
500|$|Shahrukh Khan {{felt that}} the film possessed {{significant}} commercial potential, {{in addition to being}} a fulfilment of his [...] "childhood dream" [...] to be a superhero and to fly. He stated that he wanted to [...] "make a film <b>that</b> <b>gives</b> <b>me</b> the right to deserve the iconic status that I've got for 20 years." [...] He also said that he wanted to make a film dedicated to father-son relationships, which were, in his opinion, [...] "neglected" [...] in Bollywood. Khan's idea was to make a simple family drama which expanded into an action film. He declined to make the film in English to increase its appeal for Western audiences, feeling that [...] "cracking Hollywood on their terms" [...] was unnecessary. Both Khan and Sinha credited their children for providing encouragement, and regularly [...] "approving" [...] the film's execution.|$|E
500|$|During {{his time}} at Stevenage, Boyd earned the {{nickname}} [...] "The White Pelé" [...] – this was down to his use of tricks, {{as well as the}} amount of flair Boyd brought to the team at such a young age. Stevenage manager Graham Westley, who gave Boyd his first run of matches in the first-team, described Boyd as a [...] "special talent" [...] following his two goals away at Woking in August 2005. Westley proceeded to call Boyd [...] "gifted", and a player with [...] "fantastic technical ability". He has been labelled a creative and flamboyant midfielder, and described as [...] "a player who will create goalscoring opportunities all game long". Boyd has stated that he considers assisting goals a [...] "big part of his game", and says [...] "I try to create chances for other players and <b>that</b> <b>gives</b> <b>me</b> just as much pleasure as scoring". Boyd's creative nature is emphasised {{by the fact that he}} has assisted over 50 goals for Peterborough during {{his time at}} London Road. Peterborough United manager Darren Ferguson has said that Boyd [...] "has the tendency, and ability, to score goals from long distance", talking after Boyd's 35-yard volley against Boston United. This was further highlighted when Boyd scored from just inside the opposition's half in a win against Huddersfield Town in October 2012. Boyd collected a Saido Berahino knock-down, before hitting a dipping volley from the edge of the centre circle. Manager Darren Ferguson stated — [...] "If Lionel Messi had done it you'd be seeing it over again. For vision and execution it was one of the best I have seen". Boyd also scored several long range goals during his time at Stevenage, scoring from outside the area on seven different occasions; most notably on the half-volley from 30 yards in a match against Cambridge United in January 2006.|$|E

2500|$|From an {{interview}} with Louella Parson in 1922: I {{will be out in}} California when Mr. DeMille begins operations. [...] Under my old contract I furnished eight continuities a year; now that I work only for William DeMille I only write four.

[...] It makes it possible for me to go over my script scene by scene with the producer, so he can make the picture with almost no changes.

2500|$|Born in Vienna {{into one}} of Europe's richest families, he {{inherited}} a fortune from his father in 1913. He initially made some donations to artists and writers and then, {{in a period of}} severe personal depression after the First World War, he gave away his entire fortune to his brothers and sisters. Three of his brothers committed suicide, with Wittgenstein contemplating it too. He left academia several times—serving as an officer on the front line during World War I, where he was decorated a number of times for his courage; teaching in schools in remote Austrian villages where he encountered controversy for hitting children when they made mistakes in mathematics; and working as a hospital porter during World War II in London where he told patients not to take the drugs they were prescribed while largely managing to keep secret {{the fact that he was}} one of the world's most famous philosophers. He described philosophy as [...] "the only work <b>that</b> <b>gives</b> <b>me</b> real satisfaction".|$|E
2500|$|In 1961 while {{covering}} {{the trial of}} [...] in Jerusalem, Arendt wrote to [...] a letter that Kirsch described as reflecting [...] "pure racism" [...] towards Sephardic Jews from the Middle East and Ashkenazi Jews from Eastern Europe. She wrote: [...] "On top, the judges, the best of German Jewry. Below them, the prosecuting attorneys, Galicians, but still Europeans. Everything is organized by a police force <b>that</b> <b>gives</b> <b>me</b> the creeps, speaks only Hebrew, and looks Arabic. Some downright brutal types among them. They would obey any order. And outside the doors, the oriental mob, as if one were in Istanbul or some other half-Asiatic country." [...] Though Arendt remained a Zionist activist both during and after World War II, she {{made it clear that}} she favored the creation of a Jewish-Arab federated state in Palestine, rather than a purely Jewish state. She believed that this was a way to address Jewish statelessness and to avoid the pitfalls of nationalism.|$|E

2500|$|Sharapova {{has made}} varying remarks {{on how long}} she intends to {{maintain}} her tennis career. Following the retirement of 25-year-old Justine Henin in 2008, Sharapova said, [...] "If I [...] 25, and I'd won so many Grand Slams, I'd quit too." [...] In an interview after the 2008 Australian Open, she balked {{at the idea of}} playing for another ten years, saying that she hoped to have a [...] "nice husband and a few kids" [...] by then. However, in an interview before her 2012 Australian Open semifinal, Sharapova changed her stance, saying she intended to continue playing tennis {{for as long as she}} enjoyed playing the game. Sharapova stated, [...] "I'm sure when I was 17 years old and someone said, you'll be playing for another eight years, it would be like, you're not going to see me at a press conference at 25 years old. But years go on. I missed a year in my career—I didn't play that year. I've said this, just before the tournament, a few weeks before, I woke up, and I was just so happy to be going back on the court. I felt so fresh, full of energy, just with a really good perspective. Times change, obviously. I see myself playing this sport for many more years because it's something <b>that</b> <b>gives</b> <b>me</b> the most pleasure in my life. I think it helps when you know you're good at something, and you can always improve it. It obviously helps with the encouragement." ...|$|E
2500|$|At the {{previous}} race in Italy, {{the gap between}} Rosberg and Hamilton had closed by seven points. Hamilton had started from pole position ahead of Rosberg, but had a poor start off the line and fell to fourth. He retook the lead after Rosberg braked late and went straight on at the first turn and used the escape road to rejoin the track. Hamilton remained the lead {{for the rest of}} the race to win. With six races left in the season, Hamilton was aware he could not lose any further ground to Rosberg in the championship battle and was pleased to make an improvement after his Monza victory: [...] "Despite the highs and lows, I'm still well and truly in the hunt for the championship and that is something <b>that</b> <b>gives</b> <b>me</b> huge motivation for the final six races - starting in Singapore." [...] Rosberg admitted Hamilton's form and past experience in championship battles could possibly be advantageous but it was something the latter was not concerned over and would focus on himself: [...] "At the moment, I am enjoying the moment more than I ever have in the sport because I get to a race and I have a car where I know I can be on pole and I can win," [...] Ricciardo stated that while he was aware his chances of winning the championship were not realistic, he would take a race-by-race approach, and hoped to win either of the season's next two races to draw closer in the title battle: [...] "All it takes is a couple of wins and a couple of bad races for the championship leader, and all of a sudden everything's possible again. So let's see what happens." ...|$|E
