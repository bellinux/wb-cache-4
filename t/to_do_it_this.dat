Reza becomes {{attached}} to Erik; Erik in turn becomes {{fond of the}} boy, makes beautiful toys for him and tries to ease his suffering. When the boy's suffering worsens to pain and no hope of a recovery, Erik gives him a painless poison that puts Reza to his death because Nadir cannot bear <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> <b>This</b> complicates the relationship between Erik and the Persian.|$|E
25|$|The German air {{operations}} staff, at all levels, also practiced {{the concept of}} Auftragstaktik (or mission command) doctrine. It encouraged the improvisation of tactics {{within the framework of}} set operational goals and advocated by-passing some levels of command under some circumstances. The air units were told what to achieve by high echelons, but not how <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> <b>This</b> form of command was encouraged at the lowest levels to maintain the initiative and operational tempo. The form of warfare was an ad hoc style, but it allowed field commanders to dis-assemble and re-assemble command structures at Air Corps level, and commit them to a crisis, or urgent operations within a short period of time. This gave the Luftwaffe an unmatched degree of tactical and operational flexibility.|$|E
25|$|However, {{historical}} research has presented another version. When John of Beaumont took the monastery {{he had to}} use violence <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> <b>This</b> so enraged the Frisians, they drove him and his men out {{and back to the}} shore, thus preventing him from attacking the main Frisian force from the rear, as had been the plan. Meanwhile, William IV had disembarked on the coast north of Staveren with an army of approximately 500 men. There he proceeded to burn some houses and attack and kill any Frisian in sight. However, the Frisians had seen him coming and assembled an army of their own, outnumbering William's force. William was ambushed and driven back to the sea, where he and most of his men were killed or drowned trying to swim to the ships in their heavy armor. Among Dutch historians this version is usually called the Battle of Staveren, to differentiate it from the traditional Battle of Warns.|$|E

He plays Leo Morrison, a newly-wed photographer visiting modern-day Briarcliff Manor, an insane asylum, on honeymoon with wife Teresa, played by Jenna Dewan Tatum. The scenes were shot around his summer touring schedule. In an interview with E!, {{he said of his}} role: [...] "It sounded like so much fun and that's why I wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> ... <b>this</b> sounds, like, hysterical, funny, dark and cool and right up my alley".

500|$|Del Vecho {{explained}} how the film's animation team was organized: [...] "On this movie {{we do have}} character leads, supervising animators on specific characters. The animators themselves may work on multiple characters but it's always under one lead. I think it was different on Tangled, for example, but we chose <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>this</b> way as we wanted one person to fully understand and develop their own character and {{then be able to}} impart that to the crew. Hyrum Osmond, the supervising animator on Olaf, is quiet but he has a funny, wacky personality so we knew he'd bring a lot of comedy to it; Anna's animator, Becky Bresee, it's her first time leading a character and we wanted her to lead Anna." [...] Acting coach Warner Loughlin was brought in to help the film's animators understand the characters they were creating. In order to get the general feeling of each scene, some animators did their own acting. [...] "I actually film myself acting the scene out, which I find very helpful," [...] said animation supervisor Rebecca Wilson Bresee. This helped her discover elements that made the scene feel real and believable. Elsa's supervising animator was Wayne Unten, who asked for that role because he was fascinated by the complexity of the character. Unten carefully developed Elsa's facial expressions in order to bring out her fear as contrasted against Anna's fearlessness. He also studied videos from Menzel's recording sessions and animated Elsa's breathing to match Menzel's breathing. Head of Animation, Lino DiSalvo, said, [...] "The goal for the film was to animate the most believable CG characters you've ever seen." ...|$|E
500|$|It was {{not clear}} whether the Department of State or Lodge was {{enthusiastic}} about the political change in Saigon at the time, but if they were not, they were handed a fait accompli. A CIA report from Saigon soon after the seizure of power told the State Department that [...] "It {{is safe to say that}} Khánh's group will be essentially pro-American, anti-communist and anti-neutralist in general orientation." [...] As far as Harkins was concerned, with US policy committed to maintaining leadership in the hands of senior military officers, there were no other apparent options; he told General Taylor, [...] "One thing is for sure with this coup. We've gone through all the eligible general officers." [...] For his part, Lodge chose not to warn the junta, to which the embassy had pledged their support, as to the imminent plot, despite being well aware of it. He said in a cable a few days after the coup that [...] "General Khánh's coup was extremely disconcerting at first blush", but that the lack of public reaction to the overthrow of Minh indicated that Khánh's actions were not something to be alarmed about. He wrote that the progress of history was often made in many phases by different individuals or groups, using the analogy that in an American political party, the people who manage the primary campaigns are different from those who run the national elections, while the officer-holders are entirely separate. Lodge speculated that while Minh and his generals were successful in removing Diệm—something Lodge strongly encouraged—they may not be the ideal administrators of a nation themselves. With respect to the prospects of defeating the communists, he said [...] "Our side knows how to do it; we have the means with which to do it; we simply need <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> <b>This</b> requires a tough and ruthless commander. Perhaps Khánh is it." [...] Blair said that Lodge's habit of looking for American parallels to Vietnamese situations hindered his judgment, pointing out that Khánh's rule merely saw more instability and chaos. At the end of February, Lodge was still positive and cabled Washington to say that [...] "I continue to be favorably impressed by him. He is really very much more able than the Minh, Don, Kim group and, of course, he is so far above Diệm and Nhu that there is no comparison." ...|$|E

2500|$|The New Zealand cricket team toured South Africa for cricket {{matches in}} the 2005–06 season. Owing to South Africa's busy schedule, the tour was {{split into two}} legs, one to be played in October 2005 with the six limited overs matches (one Twenty20 International and five One Day Internationals), and the second leg to be played in April and May 2006, {{including}} three Test matches. Before the limited overs series began, New Zealand were ranked third on the ICC ODI Championship table, two places ahead of their hosts South Africa [...] However, New Zealand had never won an ODI series in South Africa before this tour , {{and they were not}} <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>this</b> summer either. In fact, New Zealand did not win a single one of the five matches, and only the rain – which sent the fourth match into a no-result – prevented the Kiwis from going down 0–5. The test series was similarly disappointing for New Zealand, with South Africa claiming it 2-0. After two series losses to Australia it was a satisfying result for the South Africans.|$|E

2500|$|In the Christian view, {{humankind}} {{was made}} in the Image of God and perfect, but the Fall of Man caused the progeny of the first Parents to inherit Original Sin. The sacrifice of Christ's passion, death and resurrection provide the means for transcending that impure state (Romans 6:23). The means for doing so varies between different groups of Christians, but all rely on belief in Jesus, his work on the cross and his resurrection as the fundamental starting point for a relationship with God. Faith in God is found in Ephesians 2:8–9 – [...] "For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not as a result of works, that no one should boast." [...] (New American Standard Bible; 1973). A recent alternative Christian theological discourse interprets Jesus as revealing that the purpose of life is to elevate our compassionate response to human suffering. [...] Nonetheless the conventional Christian position is that people are justified by belief in the propitiatory sacrifice of Jesus' death on the cross. The Gospel maintains that through this belief, the barrier that sin has created between man and God is destroyed, and allows God to change people and instill in them a new heart after his own will, and the ability <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> <b>This</b> is what the terms [...] "reborn" [...] or [...] "saved" [...] almost always refer to.|$|E
