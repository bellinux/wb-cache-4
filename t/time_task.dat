Then, Halsey ordered Task Force 34 south. As Task Force 34 proceeded south they were further delayed when the battle force had to slow to 12 knots so that the battleships could refuel their escorting destroyers. The refueling cost a {{two and a half}} hour further delay. By the <b>time</b> <b>Task</b> Force 34 arrived at the scene {{it was too late to}} assist the Seventh Fleet's escort carrier groups.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} is unlimitedWhen a real time system has a mixed set of <b>time</b> critical <b>tasks,</b> including tasks with hard headlines and tasks with soft deadlines, managing a mixed set of tasks {{in a timely}} manner becomes harder and requires a multi-level architecture. This thesis concentrates on building such an architecture. The proposed architecture is based on the current Computer Aided Prototype System (CAPS) architecture, which only deals with hard real <b>time</b> and non-time-critical <b>tasks.</b> Priority based scheduling techniques are used along with Ada tasking to schedule different levels of tasks. Periodic hard real <b>time</b> polling <b>tasks</b> are used to insert sporadic soft real <b>time</b> <b>tasks</b> into the system. A method is developed to assign deadlines to soft real <b>time</b> <b>tasks</b> dynamically. Two tasking packages are added to the system for scheduling and execution of soft real <b>time</b> <b>tasks.</b> The Earliest Deadline First (EDF) algorithm is used dynamically to schedule soft real <b>time</b> <b>tasks.</b> A pilot prototype is developed to test the proposed architecture via a run time monitoring package. The results show that the proposed system guarantees that all hard real <b>time</b> <b>tasks</b> meet their deadlines and an acceptably small percentage of soft real <b>time</b> <b>tasks</b> miss their deadlines.

40|$|In this paper, we {{proposed}} an effective approach for scheduling of multiprocessor unit <b>time</b> <b>tasks</b> with chain precedence on to large multiprocessor system. The proposed longest chain maximum processor scheduling algorithm is {{proved to be}} optimal for uniform chains and monotone (non-increasing/non-decreasing) chains for both splitable and non-splitable multiprocessor unit <b>time</b> <b>tasks</b> chain. Scheduling arbitrary chains of non-splitable multiprocessor unit <b>time</b> <b>tasks</b> is proved to be NP-complete problem. But scheduling arbitrary chains of splitable multiprocessor unit <b>time</b> <b>tasks</b> is still an open problem to be proved whether it is NP-complete or can be solved in polynomial time. We have used three heuristics (a) maximum criticality first, (b) longest chain maximum criticality first and (c) longest chain maximum processor first for scheduling of arbitrary chains. Also compared performance of all three scheduling heuristics {{and found out that}} the proposed longest chain maximum processor first performs better in most of the cases.

2500|$|The serial {{reaction}} <b>time</b> <b>task</b> (SRT task) {{is a task}} whereby subjects face {{a computer}} screen where several markers are displayed that are spatially related to relevant markers on their keyboard. The subjects are asked to react as fast and accurately {{as possible to the}} appearance of a stimulus below one of the markers. Subjects can be trained on the task with either explicit instructions (e.g. there are colour sequences presented which must be learned) or implicit ones (e.g. the experimentor does not mention colour sequences, thus leaving the subjects to believe that they are taking place in a speed test). [...] When this task is used in sleep studies, after a time delay, subjects are tested for retention.|$|E
2500|$|Previous {{research}} has shown REM sleep to reactivate cortical neural assemblies post-training on a serial reaction <b>time</b> <b>task</b> (SRT), in other words REM sleep replays the processing that occurred while one learnt an implicit task in the previous waking hours. However, control subjects did not complete a SRT task, thus researchers could not assume the reactivation of certain networks to {{be a result of}} the implicitly learned sequence/grammar as it could simply be due to elementary visuomotor processing which was obtained in both groups. [...] To answer this question the experiment was redone and another group was added who also took part in the SRT task. [...] They experienced no sequence to the SRT task (random group), [...] whereas the experimental group did experience a sequence (probabilistic group), although without conscious awareness. [...] Results of [...] PET scans indicate that bilateral cuneus were significantly more activated during SRT practice as well as post-training REM sleep in the Probabilistic group than the Random group. [...] In addition, this activation was significantly increased during REM sleep versus the SRT task. [...] This suggests that specific brain regions are specifically engaged in the post-processing of sequential information. [...] This is further supported by the fact that regional CBF (rCBF) during post-training REM sleep are modulated by the level of high-order, but not low-order learning obtained prior to sleep. [...] Therefore, brain regions that take part in a learning process are modulated by both the sequential structure of the learned material (increased activation in cuneus), and the amount of high-order learning (rCBF).|$|E
