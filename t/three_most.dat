40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} both {{the structure of}} graphs with branchwidth at <b>most</b> <b>three,</b> as well as algorithms to recognise such graphs. We show that a graph has branchwidth at <b>most</b> <b>three</b> {{if and only if}} it has treewidth at <b>most</b> <b>three</b> and does not contain the three-dimensional binary cube graph as a minor. A set of four graphs is shown to be the obstruction set for the class of graphs with branchwidth at <b>most</b> <b>three.</b> Moreover, we give a safe and complete set of reduction rules for the graphs with branchwidth at <b>most</b> <b>three.</b> Using this set, a linear time algorithm is given that verifies if a given graph has branchwidth at <b>most</b> <b>three,</b> and, if so, outputs a minimum width branch decomposition...|$|R

Llanbadarn Fawr is reputed to be close to where the Roman road from North to South Wales (called Sarn Helen) crosses the river Rheidol.
