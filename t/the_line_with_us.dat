30|$|We {{may find}} some liberal intellectuals and {{nationalist}} leaders {{who could be}} consistently anticommunist in their thought and behavior, U.S. educated Christian leaders, some rightist independence activists like Song Jin-u, Cho Pyung-Ok. But the assassination of nationalist leader Song Jin-u {{in the midst of}} anti-trusteeship campaign marked a turning point for the KDP to become more pro-Japanese, pro-landlord party, following <b>the</b> Rheeâ€™s <b>line</b> one-sidedly. <b>With</b> <b>U.S.</b> military occupation, the conflict between the left and right was intensified and there was little room for Korean rightists to be conciliatory to the leftists. But if national division, the Korean War, and de facto war among Koreans did not occur, South Korean liberal and conservatives would not be such stubborn anticommunists. There were some differences between those who embraced anticommunism in order to safeguard class interests, those desperately needing self-preservation, and those who embraced liberalism, nationalism.|$|R
5|$|The 45th Infantry Division {{participated in}} its fourth amphibious assault landing during Operation Dragoon on 15 August 1944, at St. Maxime, in Southern France. The 45th Infantry Division landed its 157th and 180th regimental combat teams and {{captured}} {{the heights of}} the Chaines de Mar before meeting with the 1st Special Service Force. The German Army, reeling from the Battle of Normandy, in which it had suffered a major defeat, pulled back after a short fight, {{part of an overall}} German withdrawal to the east following the landings. Soldiers of the 45th Infantry Division engaged the dispersed forces of German Army Group G, suffering very few casualties. The U.S. Seventh Army, along with Free French forces, were able to advance north quickly. By 12 September, the Seventh Army linked up with Lieutenant General George S. Patton's U.S. Third Army, advancing from Normandy, joining the two forces at Dijon. Against slight opposition, it spearheaded the drive for the Belfort Gap. The 45th Infantry Division took the strongly defended city of Epinal on 24 September. The division was then reassigned to V Corps, under the command of Major General Leonard T. Gerow, for its next advance. On 30 September the division crossed the Moselle River and entered the western foothills of the Vosges, taking Rambervillers. It would remain in the area for a month waiting for other units to catch up before crossing the Mortagne River on 23 October. The division remained on <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>U.S.</b> 6th Army Group the southernmost of three army groups advancing through France.|$|R

The {{bonefish}} {{changed his}} swift, long runs, and took to slow sweeps to and fro, and {{whenever he was}} drawn a few yards closer he would give a solid jerk and get that much line back. There was much danger from other pieces of floating weed. R. C. maneuvered his line to miss them. All the time the bonefish was pulling doggedly. I had little hope we might capture him. At the end of fifteen minutes {{he was still a}} hundred yards from the canoe and neither of us had seen him. Our excitement grew tenser every moment. The fish sheered to and fro, and would not come into shallower water. He would not budge. He took one long run straight up <b>the</b> shore, in <b>line</b> <b>with</b> <b>us,</b> and then circled out. This alarmed me, but he did not increase his lead. He came slowly around, yard by yard. R. C. reeled carefully, not hard enough to antagonize him, and after what seemed a long time got him within a hundred feet, and I had a glimpse of green and silver. Then off he ran again. How unbelievably swift! He had been close--then almost the same instant he was far off.|$|R

In the center of Tilton, the road intersects with NH 132 just feet north of <b>the</b> Northfield town <b>line.</b> NH 132 joins US 3 and NH 11 as the road turns northeast, continuing to parallel the Winnipesaukee River's west side.

Continuing northeast, US 3 and NH 11 cross Winnisquam Lake and skirt {{the northern tip of}} Belmont.
