[...] The day after the shooting, he added, [...] "We must use every legal means to make life for these thugs miserable, to put them behind bars, or to run them out of town. We will not rest until being a gang member is a miserable, undesirable life. Ford called for longer prison sentences and decried [...] "hug a thug" [...] social programs, voting against accepting federal grants worth more than $16million.|$|E

[...] The unemployed left-wing 25-year-old holding up a sign, or the Judeo-capitalist banksters who swindled the American taxpayers out of a trillion dollars in the [...] "bailout" [...] scam and continue to oppress the white working class?!? ... We need to utilize and support every movement of dissent against this evil American empire, regardless of which end of the political spectrum it originates from. ...The fact that it's these [...] "lefties" ... who are picking up the ball and running with it – only shows how much more in tune they are with the fed up masses of white workers, than the fossilized, reactionary [...] "right-wing". ...

Not since that day in the free library in London, when he had dived into that fascinating volume in order to discover Maud's identity, had he undergone such a rain of titles. He now took stock, to ascertain how many of these people he could identify.|$|E
60|$|It {{was plain}} {{to see that}} the human folk of this inner world had not {{advanced}} far in learning, and the thought that the ugly Mahars had so outstripped them was a very pathetic one indeed. I wondered how many ages it would take to lift <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>out</b> of their ignorance even were it given to Perry and me to attempt it. Possibly we would be killed for our pains as were those men of the outer world who dared challenge the dense ignorance and superstitions of the earth's younger days. But it was worth the effort if the opportunity ever presented itself.|$|E

60|$|There was {{an uncomfortable}} silence. Haddo's words {{were out of}} tune {{with the rest of}} the conversation.

6000|$|And {{so we went}} gadding along, {{dropping}} in here and there, pricing things, and gossiping with the shopkeepers about the riot, and now and then running across pathetic reminders of it, in the persons of shunned and tearful and houseless remnants of families whose homes {{had been taken from}} them and their parents butchered or hanged. The raiment of Marco and his wife was of coarse tow-linen and linsey-woolsey respectively, and resembled township maps, it being made up pretty exclusively of patches which had been added, township by township, in the course of five or six years, until hardly a hand's-breadth of the original garments was surviving and present. Now I wanted to fit <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>out</b> with new suits, on account of that swell company, and I didn't know just how to get at it --with delicacy, until at last it struck me that as I had already been liberal in inventing wordy gratitude for the king, it would be just the thing to back it up with evidence of a substantial sort; so I said: ...|$|E
60|$|No one {{has written}} {{anything}} that really conveys {{the quality of}} that repatriation process; the queer business of bringing these suspicious, illiterate, despondent people back to their desolated homes, reuniting swarthy fathers and stockish mothers, witnessing their touchingly inexpressive encounters, doing what one could to put heart into their resumption. Memories {{come back to me}} of great littered heaps of luggage, bundles, blankets, rough boxes, piled newly purchased stores, ready-made doors, window sashes heaped ready for the waggons, slow-moving, apathetic figures sitting and eating, an infernal squawking of parrots, sometimes a wailing of babies. Repatriation went on to a parrot obligato, and I never hear a parrot squawk without a flash of South Africa across my mind. All the prisoners, I believe, brought back parrots--some two or three. I had to spread <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>out,</b> over a country still grassless, with teams of war-worn oxen, mules and horses that died by the dozen on my hands. The end of each individual instance was a handshake, and one went lumbering on, leaving the children one had deposited behind one already playing with old ration-tins or hunting about for cartridge-cases, while adults stared at the work they had to do.|$|E
6000|$|These things--if {{we could}} bring them about--would leave us {{with a sort of}} {{clarified}} Problem of the Unemployed on our hands. Our Minimum Wage would have strained <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>out,</b> and, provided there existed what is already growing up, an intelligent system of employment bureaus, we should have much more reason to conclude than we have at present, that they were mainly unemployed because of a real incapacity in character, strength, or intelligence for efficient citizenship. Our raised standards of housing, our persecution of overcrowding, and our obstruction of employment below the minimum wage, would have swept out the rookeries and hiding-places of these people of the Abyss. They would exist, but they would not multiply--and that is our supreme end. They would be tramping on roads where mendicity laws would prevail, there would be no house-room for them, no squatting-places. The casual wards would catch them and register them, and telephone one to the other about them. It is rare that children come into this world without a parent or so being traceable. Everything would converge to convince these people that to bear children into such an unfavourable atmosphere is an extremely inconvenient and undesirable thing. They would not have many children, and such children as they had would fall easily into our organized net and get the protection of the criticised and improved development of the existing charitable institutions. [Footnote: [...] "I wonder whether there is any legal flaw in the second section of the Prevention of Cruelty to Children Act of 1894, which may have been specially aimed at beggars with offspring. It is specially punishable to beg having an infant in their arms, quite apart from teaching the infant in question to beg. Or is this law insufficiently enforced through popular apathy?"--C. G. STUART MENTEATH.] This is {{the best we can do}} for those poor little creatures. As for that increasing section of the Abyss that will contrive to live childless, these papers have no quarrel with them. A childless wastrel is a terminating evil, and it may be, a picturesque evil. I must confess that a lazy rogue is very much to my taste, provided there is no tragedy of children to smear the joke with misery. And if he or she neither taints nor tempts the children, who are our care, a childless weakling we may freely let our pity and mercy go out to. To go childless is in them a virtue for which they merit our thanks.|$|E

50|$|Each of {{the four}} vignettes that make up People in Cages {{addresses}} different social issues, such as racism, and how people can become trapped by society. Although {{some of these issues}} are weighty, and each play is ultimately quite tragic, the plays themselves are laced with humour and comedy. The humour is typically very surreal in view of the unusual premise of having people locked inside cages for the viewing pleasure of others and that some of <b>these</b> <b>people</b> are <b>out</b> of the ordinary in unexpected ways.|$|R

25|$|The Assemblies of God has {{its roots}} in the Pentecostal revival of the early 20th century. The Pentecostal aspects of the revival were not {{generally}} welcomed by established churches, and participants in the movement soon found themselves forced outside existing religious bodies. <b>These</b> <b>people</b> sought <b>out</b> their own places of worship and founded hundreds of distinctly Pentecostal congregations. By 1914, many ministers and laymen alike began to realize just how far-reaching the spread of the revival and of Pentecostalism had become.
