40|$|The de novo protein DF 1 is {{a minimal}} model for diiron and dimanganese metalloproteins, such as soluble methane monooxygenase. DF 1 is a homodimeric four-helix bundle whose dinuclear center is formed by two {{bridging}} Glu side chains, two chelating Glu side chains, and two monodentate His ligands. Here, we report the di-Mn(II) and di-Co(II) derivatives of variants of this protein. Together with previously solved structures, 23 crystallographically independent four-helix bundle structures of DF 1 variants have been determined, which {{differ in the}} bound metal ions {{and size of the}} active site cavity. For the di-Mn(II) derivatives, as the size of the cavity increases, the number and polarity of exogenous ligands increases. This collection of structures was analyzed to determine the relationship between protein conformation and the geometry of the active site. The primary mode of backbone movement involves a coordinated <b>tilting</b> <b>and</b> <b>sliding</b> of the first helix in the helix-loop-helix motif. Sliding depends on crystal-packing forces, the steric bulk of a critical residue that determines the dimensions of the active site access cavity, and the intermetal distance. Additionally, a torsional motion of the bridging carboxylates modulates the intermetal distance. This analysis provides a critical evaluation of how conformation, flexibility, and active site accessibility affect the geometry and ligand-binding properties of a metal center. The geometric parameters defining the DF structures were compared to natural diiron proteins; DF proteins have a restricted active site cavity, which may have implications for substrate recognition and chemical stability...|$|E
40|$|Laterally loaded {{structures}} such as wind turbines, offshore platforms, {{earth retaining}} structures, bridge abutments and many other structures impose complex loading regimes on the supporting foundations. These foundations are typically subjected to combinations of vertical, horizontal and moment loadings resulting from the vertical self-weight of the foundation system, superstructure, soil fill and surface surcharge, in addition to significant lateral loads and moments due to soil pressures, wind loads, waves and currents. In the case of shallow foundations, the weight and dimensions must be sufficient to resist <b>tilting</b> <b>and</b> <b>sliding,</b> whilst {{at the same time}} preventing failure of the subsoil and satisfying any serviceability conditions. These criteria can be achieved by controlling the width and thickness of the shallow foundation. However, this often requires the use of large and thick footings, which is a problem especially in locations with limited access and in offshore environment, where the presence of gravity bases has a large influence on the movement of the surrounding water and generates significant heave forces. In this study, an innovative technique is proposed to improve the lateral capacity of shallow footings by providing them with a central short monopile. The interaction between the footing and the monopile in the proposed hybrid foundation system has proven to increase the lateral load resistance and decrease the dependency of the lateral resistance on the vertical load component acting on the system. The lateral load resistance of the hybrid system is generated, even at low vertical load ratios, directly by mobilizing passive lateral pressures on the embedded portion and indirectly through the restoring moment resulting by the bearing stresses underneath the footing. The two phenomena together contribute to the resistance of sliding and rotation of the whole system. An extensive 2 D and 3 D numerical modeling program, complemented with physical centrifuge testing have been used to study the behavior of the system under various combinations of vertical, horizontal and moment (V-H-M) loadings and generate detailed information about the failure envelopes in three-dimensional (V-H-M) load space for both drained and undrained loading. The numerical study indicates that the interaction between the structural elements of the hybrid system increased the strength and stiffness of the foundation system and mobilized high lateral load and rocking resistances, even at low strains. The resistance was found to rely mainly on the geometry of the system, especially the pile length-to-footing width ratio...|$|E

40|$|The {{morphology}} of stacked coronene molecules encapsulated in a single-walled {{carbon nanotube}} (SWCNT) is investigated using atomistic simulation. First, the minimum energy configuration of coronene molecules in a SWCNT is sought by means of conjugate gradient (CG) minimization. Secondly, encapsulation of coronene molecules into a SWCNT existing in a coronene atmosphere is simulated by means of molecular dynamics (MD). In both of the simulations, {{the diameter of the}} SWCNT ranges from 1. 35 to 1. 69 nm, and the final configurations of coronene molecules within a SWCNT are examined. In a thin SWCNT, coronene molecules tilt against the radial direction of the SWCNT <b>and</b> <b>slide</b> relative to each other, whereas in a thick SWCNT, they do not tilt but rotate relative to each other. In a SWCNT of the intermediate diameter, they <b>tilt,</b> <b>slide,</b> <b>and</b> rotate. For the SWCNT diameter {{less than or equal to}} 1. 52 nm, the mean tilt angle of the stacked coronene molecules almost linearly decreases with increasing the diameter, whereas for the diameter above 1. 52 nm, it is approximately 0 ∘. To check the validity of the results, the MD simulations are performed changing the density of the coronene atmosphere and the length of the SWCNT; the results prove to be valid. Finally, the effects of temperature on the mean <b>tilt</b> angle <b>and</b> mean intermolecular distance of stacked coronene molecules are examined by a rather simplified simulation, which shows that both of them increase with increasing temperature...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} external loads arising from differential thermal expansion between a substrate and a surface mount component, specimens with a simulated surface mount component (nickel) on a copper substrate having a 1 mm 2 joint area and solder thickness of about 100 µm were prepared to induce extrinsic shear in joints undergoing thermomechanical fatigue (TMF) cycling. The specimens were fabricated stress free and later clamped to a copper block to cause a significant reversal in sign of the shear imposed on the solder joint during TMF cycling for 20 minutes at 150 °C and 3. 5 hr at- 15 °C. The evolution of surface damage and microstructure was examined using SEM and Orientation Imaging Microscopy (OIM). The joints were almost single crystals. However, the orientations of the tin in each joint is different, leading to different resolved stresses on a given slip system. The joint with the largest resolved shear aligned with the crystal c-axis showed the most damage. Low angle <b>tilt</b> boundaries developed, <b>and</b> <b>sliding</b> was observed on boundaries near 7 and 14 ° that have a coincident site lattice.

These properties include: the values of each of the six step parameters (twist roll, <b>tilt,</b> rise, <b>slide</b> <b>and</b> shift), for each step of the sequence; flexibility measures for both decrease and increase in each property value from the minimum energy conformation for the central step; and the deviation from the path of a hypothetical straight octamer.

A more detailed analysis of octamer properties has allowed us to determine the structural preferences of particular sequence elements. GGC and GCC sequences tend to confer bistability, low stability and a predisposition to A-form DNA, whereas AA steps strongly prefer B-DNA and inhibit A-structures. There is no correlation between flexibility and intrinsic curvature, but bent DNA is less stable than straight. The most difficult deformation is undertwisting.
