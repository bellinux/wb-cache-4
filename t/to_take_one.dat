Turk exits with Isabella, and Elliot expresses concern that J.D. thinks he's moving into the house with her. Carla has decided <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>one</b> year parental leave, and Laverne, Ted, and The Worthless Peons wonder how they can go on at the hospital without Carla's help ("Gonna Miss You, Carla"). Carla begins {{to realize that she}} does not want to separate herself from her work for so long.|$|E
5|$|During the Depression I joined Mrs Mac's {{electrical}} {{school in}} Phillip Street. It {{was the first}} time girls were involved with electrical circuits, Morse and making radio sets. Later Mrs Mac {{decided it was time to}} use our skills in industry, so she persuaded Airzone Ltd <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>one</b> of us (me) on trial in their radio section. Soon the others followed from the school, and we started the component parts section, and we were absorbed into many other sections.|$|E
5|$|From the start, all {{subjects}} of the IB Diploma Programme were available in English and French, and it was mandatory for all students to study both a first and a second language. In 1974, bilingual diplomas were introduced that allowed students <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>one</b> {{or more of their}} humanities or science subjects in a language other than their first. The IB Diploma Programme subjects became available in Spanish in 1983.|$|E

5|$|After moving in, Moon began a {{prescribed}} course of Heminevrin (clomethiazole, a sedative) to alleviate his alcohol withdrawal symptoms. He {{wanted to get}} sober, but due to his fear of psychiatric hospitals {{he wanted to do}} it at home. Clomethiazole is discouraged for unsupervised detoxification because of its addictive potential, its tendency to induce tolerance, and its risk of death when mixed with alcohol. The pills were prescribed by Geoffrey Dymond, a physician who was unaware of Moon's lifestyle. Dymond prescribed a bottle of 100 pills, instructing him <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>one</b> pill when he felt a craving for alcohol but not more than three pills per day.|$|E
5|$|Crisis Core is {{an action}} {{role-playing}} {{game in which}} the player controls Zack Fair. The player moves Zack through and between open areas, allowing him to talk with non-player characters, interact with the environment, and engage monsters in battle. At save points, the player may opt <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>one</b> of the available side missions, and if so, Zack is moved to a special area to complete the mission, which usually involves defeating one or more monsters. If the mission is successfully completed, the player is rewarded with beneficial items, and often new missions become available. Whether the player is successful in the side mission or not, upon completion, Zack is returned to the save point in the main game.|$|E
5|$|Despite her injury, McLeod {{returned}} to the pitch quickly, starting in three games at the CONCACAF Women's Olympic Qualifier in February 2016 where she recorded two shutouts. On February 19, McLeod joined the national team for their semifinal match against Costa Rica. In the warmup for the game, she again injured her right knee and left the warmup early. However, she played all 90 minutes of the match. Following the tournament, she {{returned to}} Sweden to play with her club team, FC Rosengård. In March 2016, her knee collapsed after kicking a ball while playing with FC Rosengård. It was revealed that she had torn her ACL in her right knee for the third time. Later, her surgeon stated that the injury had most likely occurred in the warmup before Canada's match against Costa Rica. McLeod has stated that her recovery is expected <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>one</b> to two years and plans {{to be back on}} the field in February or March 2017.|$|E

5|$|Joyce {{returned}} to Dublin in mid-1909 with George, {{to visit his}} father and work on getting Dubliners published. He visited Nora's family in Galway and liked Nora's mother very much. While preparing to return to Trieste he decided <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>one</b> of his sisters, Eva, back with him to help Nora run the home. He spent a month in Trieste before returning to Dublin, this time {{as a representative of}} some cinema owners and businessmen from Trieste. With their backing he launched Ireland's first cinema, the Volta Cinematograph, which was well-received, but fell apart after Joyce left. He {{returned to}} Trieste in January 1910 with another sister, Eileen, in tow. Eva became homesick for Dublin and returned there a few years later, but Eileen spent {{the rest of her life}} on the continent, eventually marrying Czech bank cashier Frantisek Schaurek.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, in Canada, Smith and Mulder's car {{runs out}} of gas. Walking the last few miles on foot, they come across the corpse of the electrician, grossly {{decomposed}} and covered in ants. Jeremiah takes Mulder to a mysterious field where they find a group of identical children; the girls all resemble Samantha at the age when she was abducted. Jeremiah tells Mulder that the cloned children are drones, workers used to tend the fields, incapable of speaking. After retrieving a gasoline can, Mulder tries <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>one</b> of the female clones with him. However, the Bounty Hunter arrives and chases them. As he corners them in a large bee hive, the Bounty Hunter is crushed and stung repeatedly in a trap {{set up by the}} trio.|$|E

At {{the start of the}} trial, the prosecution's case was expected to take around four weeks and the defense was expected <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>one</b> day. On October 25 and 26, Halle Shilling and Christy Wiegand testified about being attacked by Guandique while independently jogging in Rock Creek Park. Wiegand recounted that Guandique grabbed her from behind, dragged her down a ravine and held a knife against her face.|$|E

5|$|Ricardo Carvalho, Frank Lampard and Avram Grant all {{refused to}} point the finger of blame at John Terry, but {{assistant}} manager Henk ten Cate admitted that Terry was not originally due <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>one</b> of the first five penalties (if Drogba had not been sent off, he would have taken the fifth penalty). Chelsea offered Terry counselling {{as a result of}} his devastation following the miss of his penalty, and subsequently, the loss of the final. Terry was later accused of spitting at Manchester United striker Carlos Tevez, but a UEFA report into the video evidence cleared him of any wrongdoing. Terry also wrote an open letter, published on Chelsea's official website, apologising for missing the penalty and costing Chelsea the trophy. Nicolas Anelka, who took the decisive kick, revealed he did not actually want to take a penalty, citing lack of warm-up time.|$|E

5|$|The Delhi Durbar Tiara {{was made}} by Garrard & Co. for Queen Mary, the wife of George V, to wear at the Delhi Durbar in 1911. As British law {{prohibited}} {{the removal of the}} Crown Jewels from the country, George V wore a specially made crown (the Imperial Crown of India) to the Durbar, and his consort Queen Mary wore the tiara. It was part of a set of jewellery made for Queen Mary to use at the event which included a necklace, stomacher, brooch and earrings. Made of gold and platinum, the tiara is 8cm (3in) tall and has the form of a tall circlet of lyres and S-scrolls linked by festoons of diamonds. It was originally set with 10 of the Cambridge emeralds, acquired by Queen Mary in 1910 and first owned by her grandmother, the Duchess of Cambridge. In 1912, the tiara was altered <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>one</b> or both of the Cullinan III and IV diamonds; the pear-shaped diamond was held at the top, and the cushion-shaped stone hung in the oval aperture underneath. Mary lent the tiara to Queen Elizabeth (later the Queen Mother) for the 1947 royal tour of South Africa, and it remained with her until she died in 2002, when it passed to Queen Elizabeth II. In 2005, the Queen lent the tiara to her daughter-in-law, the Duchess of Cornwall.|$|E

5|$|The company's {{latest project}} is Journey, which was {{released}} on March 13, 2012. It was the final game in Thatgamecompany's three-game contract with Sony, and was developed {{by a team of}} fourteen. This team did not include Santiago, who, in order to concentrate on her role as the company's president, was replaced as a producer by Robin Hunicke. The game was in development for three years, despite having been expected <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>one</b> year, and the development team faced several problems in expanding the company from seven employees as they began the game to eighteen, and risked running out of money. Upon release, the game achieved both critical and commercial success. It became the fastest-selling game to date on PlayStation Store in North America and Europe. After the game was released, as the company began work on another project, several employees left for other opportunities. Santiago left the company to pursue other ventures, designer Chris Bell left to form his own studio The Willderness, and Hunicke resigned to work at Tiny Speck. Chen attributes the exodus to the end of Thatgamecompany's three-game contract, and {{to the fact that the}} company had run out of money to pay employees, mandating an unpaid hiatus until the revenue from Journey came in.|$|E
