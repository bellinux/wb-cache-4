The moths have a wingspan ranging from 32 to 45mm, and live over thirty days in optimal conditions. However, the life span ranges from five to fifteen days on average. They are nocturnal and hide in vegetation during the day. Adult moths collect nectar or other plant exudates from {{a large number of}} plants, and live for 12 to 16 days. Females can lay up to 2,500 eggs in their lifetime.|$|E
5|$|The species {{lives in}} families, with {{population}} densities of 10 to 12 individuals per hectare. Family feeding territories do not overlap with each other, and mostly {{remain the same}} each year; however, the home territories of different family groups are larger and do overlap with each other. Both males and females have been observed to mark corners of stones mostly located near <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> home territory, from April to December, by rubbing their neck glands against them.|$|E
5|$|After the {{establishment}} of the Jesuit mission in Bohol, Father Juan de Torres, SJ, moved to the community along the Loboc River in late 1596 to establish a second mission station. The first church, made of wood, was built by the people of the area on a site called Calvario, Sawang, near the location of the present-day church. It was dedicated under the patronage of Saint Michael the Archangel. Loboc officially became a Catholic parish in 1602. Due to pirate attacks on Baclayon and the strategic position of Loboc, the Jesuits chose Loboc to become <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> mission. The Jesuit superior of Bohol later resided in Loboc until the Jesuits' expulsion in 1768. A boarding school for boys, the Seminario de los Indios, was established at Loboc in 1605.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—We {{compare the}} radial {{distributions}} of known localized gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) relative to <b>the</b> <b>centers</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> host galaxies with the distributions of known objects in nearby galaxies (supernovae of various types, X-ray binaries), the hypothetical dark-matter profiles, {{and the distribution}} of luminous matter in galaxies in the model of an exponential disk. By comparing the moments of empirical distributions, we show that the radial distribution of GRBs in galaxies differs significantly from that of other sources. We suggest a new statistical method for comparing empirical samples that is based on estimating the number of objects within a given radius. The exponential disk profile was found to be in best agreement with the radial distribution of GRBs. The distribution of GRBs relative to <b>the</b> <b>centers</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> host galaxies also agrees with the dark matter profile at certain model parameters. c © 2005 Pleiades Publishing, Inc.

25|$|Ibn Khaldun {{argues that}} each dynasty has within itself {{the seeds of}} its own downfall.

As the new rulers establish themselves at <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> empire, they become increasingly lax and more concerned with maintaining their lifestyles.
