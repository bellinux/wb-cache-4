5|$|In late 1758 Brilliant {{joined a}} Royal Navy {{squadron}} supporting amphibious raids along the French coastline. In company with other frigates she protected fleet transports and bomb vessels and assisted with shore bombardment in the Battle of Saint Cast on 11 September 1758. The progenitor of the Royal Geographic Society, James Rennell, was a midshipman aboard Brilliant {{during this period}} and produced his first coastal map while the frigate was stationed off Saint Cast. Brilliant played an undistinguished role in this engagement as her draught was too deep for her to approach the shore. By {{the afternoon of the}} battle she was close enough to the beach for her crew to witness the surrounding and defeat of the British Grenadier Guards, but was too distant <b>to</b> <b>range</b> her guns onto their French assailants.|$|E
5|$|P. lanceolata shrubs {{destroyed}} by bushfire regenerate through seedlings surviving through seedbank in the soil. The Ku-ring-gai Chase {{study found that}} seedlings germinated within two years of a 1994 bushfire, although some appeared up to six years afterwards, while germination {{was not related to}} any particular season. Plants take six years to reach maturity. Thus, more frequent bushfires prevent recruitment and hence endanger populations. However, plants in Lane Cove National Park were recorded maturing three years after an especially intense bushfire. What triggers germination is unknown, and seedlings have also arisen from areas disturbed by sand mining, sometimes growing in higher concentrations than before the disturbance. The natural lifespan of a plant appears <b>to</b> <b>range</b> from 25 to 60 years.|$|E

5|$|Red foxes may prey on {{domestic}} rabbits and guinea pigs {{if they are}} kept in open runs or are allowed <b>to</b> <b>range</b> freely in gardens. This problem is usually averted by housing them in robust hutches and runs. Urban foxes frequently encounter cats and may feed alongside them. In physical confrontations, the cats usually have the upper hand. Authenticated cases of foxes killing cats usually involve kittens. Although most foxes do not prey on cats, some may do so, and may treat them more as competitors rather than food.|$|E

5|$|The {{recognised}} metalloids {{and their}} closer neighbours mostly {{cost less than}} silver; only polonium and astatine are more expensive than gold, on account of their significant radioactivity. As of 5 April 2014, prices for small samples (up to 100 g) of silicon, antimony and tellurium, and graphite, aluminium and selenium, average around one third the cost of silver (US$1.5 per gram or about $45 an ounce). Boron, germanium and arsenic samples average about three-and-a-half times the cost of silver. Polonium is available for about $100 per microgram. Zalutsky and Pruszynski estimate a similar cost for producing astatine. Prices for the applicable elements traded as commodities tend <b>to</b> <b>range</b> from {{two to three times}} cheaper than the sample price (Ge), to nearly three thousand times cheaper (As).|$|E

5|$|Tigers first reached India and {{northern}} Asia {{in the late}} Pleistocene, reaching eastern Beringia (but not the American Continent), Japan, and Sakhalin. As evidenced by Sandra Herrington, some fossil skulls that are morphologically distinct from lion skulls could indicate however that tigers might have been present in Alaska within the last 100,000 years during the last glaciation. Fossils found in Japan indicate the local tigers were, like the surviving island subspecies, smaller than the mainland forms, an example of insular dwarfism. Until the Holocene, tigers also lived in Borneo, {{as well as on}} the island of Palawan in the Philippines. As of the Middle Ages, Caspian tigers were noted <b>to</b> <b>range</b> in the Pontic-Caspian steppes of Ukraine and southern Russia.|$|E

5|$|In {{the top of}} {{the ninth}} inning, Tigers' center fielder Austin Jackson {{executed}} an over-the-shoulder catch on the run to retire Cleveland's Mark Grudzielanek for the first out and preserve the perfect game, a play that has been compared to DeWayne Wise's leaping catch at the wall in the ninth-inning that preserved Mark Buehrle's perfect game in 2009. Mike Redmond grounded out to make the second out of the inning. Jason Donald then hit a soft ground ball that first baseman Miguel Cabrera had <b>to</b> <b>range</b> far to his right to retrieve. Donald was ruled safe, giving him an infield single, but video replay showed that Cabrera's throw to Galarraga, who was covering first base, beat Donald to the bag. Donald advanced to second and third base on defensive indifference during Trevor Crowe's at-bat, until Crowe grounded out to Brandon Inge, ending the game in a 3–0 victory for the Tigers.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 16 June Cornwallis {{returned}} to the region, hunting for Vence, and instead discovered Villaret de Joyeuse with an overwhelming force. This time Cornwallis was forced to retreat, heading into open water with the French fleet in pursuit. Cornwallis was hampered by the poor sailing of two of his squadron, and on {{the morning of}} 17 June the leading French ships were close enough to open fire on his rearguard. Throughout the day the French vanguard kept up a distant but continual fire on the rearmost British ship HMS Mars, until eventually the ship began to fall behind. In an effort to protect Mars, Cornwallis interposed his 100-gun flagship HMS Royal Sovereign between the British squadron and the French force, its massive broadsides driving the French back. At the same time, Cornwallis had ordered the frigate HMS Phaeton <b>to</b> <b>range</b> ahead of his squadron making false signals announcing the imminent arrival of a British fleet. These signals, in combination with the coincidental appearance of unidentified sails to the north, caused Villaret to become so concerned that at 18:40 he called off pursuit and returned to the French coast, allowing Cornwallis to return to Britain without further incident. The engagement was subsequently known as Cornwallis's Retreat.|$|E
5|$|The Buckeye is {{the only}} purely American breed to sport a pea comb, and this, {{combined}} with its stocky build, makes it a supremely cold hardy chicken. Other breeds of fowl developed in the U.S. (such as the Ameraucana) may sport pea combs, but these chickens were primarily created from foreign birds. It also bears some traits of Game fowl in frame and disposition, being assertive in character {{and a very good}} forager. Generally calm, the cock birds in rare cases may become aggressive. Despite its game heritage, it tolerates confinement well, although it will be much happier and produce better if allowed <b>to</b> <b>range</b> on grass. The Buckeye is said by breeders to be disinclined towards feather picking. A good meat producer and layer of between 150 and 200 eggs per year, the Buckeye is a dual purpose chicken wellsuited to small farmyard and backyard flocks.|$|E
