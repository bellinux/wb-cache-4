While methods that can measure <b>transmitting</b> <b>efficiency</b> do exist, most are complicated and prone to high uncertainties. A new method is presented for determining the lower bound of absolute <b>transmitting</b> <b>efficiency</b> by use of a reverberation chamber. This method is able to characterize both the transmitting and receiving efficiency of an antenna. After the method is derived, numerical simulations are presented. These simulations can provide insight into the behavior of the equations and necessary assumptions. Then, by use of measurement data, the method for <b>transmitting</b> <b>efficiency</b> is compared to efficiency data obtained from another reverberation chamber method. Data for this comparison will come from two different types of antennas: a wide band dual-ridged horn, and a narrow-band meta-material inspired antenna.

However, there are few studies of the multilayer membranes. Some analytical models simplify the multilayer membrane as monolayer, which results in inaccuracies. This paper presents a new analytical model for CMUTs with multilayer membranes, which can rapidly and accurately predict static deflection and response frequency of the multilayer membrane under external pressures. The derivation is based on the Ritz method and Hamilton’s principle. The mathematical relationships between the external pressure, static deflection, and response frequency are obtained. Relevant residual stress compensation method is derived. The model has been verified for three-layer and double-layer CMUT membranes by comparing its results with finite element method (FEM) simulations, experimental data, and other monolayer models that treat CMUTs as monolayer plates/membranes. For three-layer CMUT membranes, the relative errors are ranging from 0. 71 %– 3. 51 % for the static deflection profiles, and 0. 35 %– 4. 96 % for the response frequencies, respectively. For the double-layer CMUT membrane, the relative error with residual stress compensation is 4. 14 % for the central deflection, and − 1. 17 % for the response frequencies, respectively.

40|$|Purpose/Introduction: Signal to {{noise ratio}} (SNR) and <b>transmit</b> <b>efficiency</b> {{are the most}} {{important}} considerations in RF coil design. Tight fitting transceiver (TxRx) arrays are often used to optimize the <b>transmit</b> <b>efficiency</b> [1], while large transmit arrays in combination with tight-fitting receive arrays (ToRo) are used for optimum SNR [2]. In this study, a ToRo coil with 8 -transmit elements and 18 -receive elements was constructed with the aim to approach the <b>transmit</b> <b>efficiency</b> of transceiver arrays while retaining the SNR advantage of receive-only arrays. Subjects and Methods: Experiments were performed on a Siemens 9. 4 T whole body scanner. The tight-fitting (20 9 23 cm) 8 -channel TxRx array used in this study was presented previously [1]. In the new ToRo coil, the transmit array consisted of eight evenly spaced gapped loops on a circular tube (outer diameter = 26 cm). Each loop was tuned with 12 -capacitors and actively detuned with a PIN diode in series. Adjacent elements were inductively decoupled. Both transmit arrays had a length of 10 and 4 cm gap to the shield. The receive part consisted of 18 -receive elements arranged in three rows on a helmet (nine in the top row, seven and two in the 2 nd and 3 rd row, respectively). Adjacent elements in the same row were inductively decoupled and each element of the lower row geometrically decoupled with two elements of the upper row. The full setup is shown in Fig. 1. Results: Coupling between adjacent transmit elements was 20 dB and active detuning in transmit and receive array was 30 dB. The measured transmit field closely followed the predicted pattern from simulations whereas the difference in mean B 1 + in the central axial slice (B 1 + avg) was below 9 compared to the numerical model (Fig. 2 a/b). Compared to the TxRx array the B 1 + avg of the ToRo configuration was, however, 18 weaker (Fig. 2 c). This includes additional losses caused by the receive array and active detuning circuits. Nevertheless, the ToRo coil provided substantially higher SNR than the TxRx configuration (Fig. 3). Discussion/Conclusion: The designed ToRo array provided high B 1 + efficiency, but, not to the level of tight fitting TxRx arrays. Since ToRo arrays are loosely coupled to the load, it doesn’t have to be tuned and matched for every experiment. Furthermore, ToRo configuration provides significantly higher SNR and better parallel imaging performance due to smaller coil elements arranged closer to the head. Future studies will include a comparison of B 1 +/sqrt(SAR) for the two coil configurations...|$|R

V_p and V_s measurements {{were made at}} the room temperature and under one atmospheric pressure. Measured V_p and V_s values are fairly smaller than those expected from their mineral compositions except for ALH- 77288. High porosity values (∿ 10 %) of the samples, except for that (∿ 2 %) of ALH- 77288,are consistent with such low elastic-wave velocities. Degree of decrease in velocity is, however, larger than that expected from spherical pores. Thus, V_p and V_s of chondrites may be controlled by the crack porosity. Very low <b>transmitting</b> <b>efficiency</b> of the shear-wave may also support this view. Velocity anisotropy between transmitting directions is observed in almost all samples.

In the power distribution industry, an advanced composites rod has been developed to replace conventional steel cable as the load-bearing core of overhead conductors. Such conductors, called aluminum conductor composite core (ACCC) significantly increases the <b>transmitting</b> <b>efficiency</b> of existing power grid system without extensive rebuilding expenses, while meeting future demand for electricity. In general, the service life of such overhead conductors is required to be at least 30 years. Therefore, the long-term endurance of the composite core in various environments must be well-understood.; Accelerated aging by hygrothermal exposure was conducted to determine the effect of moisture on the glass fiber (GF) /carbon fiber (CF) hybrid composites. The influence of water immersion and humid air exposure on mechanical properties is investigated. Results indicated that immersion in water is the most severe environment for such hybrid GF/CF composites, and results in greater saturation and degradation of properties. When immersed directly in water, the hybrid GF/CF composites exhibit a moisture uptake behavior that is more complex than composite materials reinforced with only one type of fiber. The unusual diffusion behavior is attributed to a higher packing density of fibers at the annular GF/CF interface, which acts as a temporary moisture barrier. Moisture uptake leads to the mechanical and thermal degradation of such hybrid GF/CF composites. Findings presented here indicate that the degradation is a function of exposure temperature, time, and moisture uptake level. Results also indicate that such hybrid GF/CF composites recover short beam shear (SBS) strength and glass transition temperature (Tg) values comparable to pre-aged samples after removal of the absorbed moisture.; In the hygrothermal environment (60 °C/ 85 % R. H. air), the hybrid GF/CF composites exhibit theoretical Fickian behavior before reaching the pseudo-saturation level. However, with continued exposure, the composites then exhibit weight loss, a phenomenon attributed to a combination of a dehydration reaction and a hydrolysis reaction. These reactions resulted in loss of low molecular weight molecules present in the epoxy matrix. Results indicate that a small amount of moisture-induced damage occurred in the hybrid composites, although the mechanical and thermal properties were only slightly diminished. In fact, the retained tensile strength was equivalent to the rated tensile strength.; The influence of thermal exposure on the strength of hybrid GF/CF composites was thoroughly investigated. Results indicate that tensile strength and modulus degrade as a function of temperature and time. When the aging temperature is close to Tg, degradation was increased along with increasing temperature. Results also indicate that storage modulus can be used as an index to predict the temperature dependence of tensile strength and the long-term isothermal aging behavior, at least within specific domains.; The effect of thermal cycling on the hybrid composites was also investigated. Thermal degradation during thermal cycling is attributed to two distinctive mechanisms. The primary degradation results from isothermal aging, while additional thermal fatigue damage occurs at sub-zero temperatures due to increasing residual stress. An empirical normalized tensile strength-storage modulus correlation provides an index of thermal fatigue damage.; Various forms of environmental aging and their effects on mechanical and thermal properties of hybrid GF/CF composites were assessed. The results and analysis provides an insight into fundamental mechanisms of degradation associated with overhead conductors with the hybrid GF/CF composite cores...|$|E

Currently, the micromachining technology has advanced such that vacuum cavities sealed by thin plates, known as Capacitive Micromachined Ultrasonic Transducers (CMUTs), can be fabricated through silicon micromachining processes in a low cost manner. Given the thin plates, a CMUT is able to vibrate with a low mechanical impedance and thus a high coupling efficiency with the ambient atmosphere. Nevertheless, air-coupled applications are still highly limited by the transmit power of air-coupled CMUTs. A circle is the routine geometry in most CMUT cell designs. Even though efforts have been put forward to address the limitations of circular design in terms of sensitivity, more investigation about other cell geometries is prudent. In this work, a novel air-coupled CMUT design with annular cell geometry is proposed. Finite element analysis and experimental studies demonstrated its significant improvement in <b>transmit</b> <b>efficiency</b> over the conventional circular-cell CMUTs.
