5000|$|A <b>turbidostat</b> is a {{continuous}} microbiological culture device, {{similar to a}} chemostat or an auxostat, which has feedback between the turbidity of the culture vessel and the dilution rate. [...] The theoretical relationship between growth in a chemostat and growth in a <b>turbidostat</b> is somewhat complex, {{in part because they}} are similar. A chemostat has a fixed volume and flow rate, and thus a fixed dilution rate. A <b>turbidostat</b> dynamically adjusts the flow rate (and therefore the dilution rate) to make the turbidity constant. At equilibrium, operation of both the chemostat and <b>turbidostat</b> are identical. It is only when classical chemostat assumptions are violated (for instance, out of equilibrium; or the cells are mutating) that a <b>turbidostat</b> is functionally different. One case may be while cells are growing at their maximum growth rate, in which case it is difficult to set a chemostat to the appropriate constant dilution rate.|$|E
50|$|Fermentation setups {{closely related}} to the chemostats are the <b>turbidostat,</b> the auxostat and the retentostat. In retentostats, culture liquid is also removed from the bioreactor, but a filter retains the biomass. In this case, the biomass {{concentration}} increases until the nutrient requirement for biomass maintenance has become equal to the amount of limiting nutrient that can be consumed.|$|E
50|$|Changestat is a {{continuous}} cultivation method {{that is used}} for acquiring quantitative data of a microorganism's metabolism at various environmental conditions within a single experiment. Every changestat always starts as {{a continuous}} cultivation experiment (chemostat, <b>turbidostat),</b> but after reaching steady state, smooth and slow change of an environmental parameter is applied. Two most common changestat techniqies are accelerostat (A-stat) and dilution rate stat (D-stat).In case of A-stat the changing environmental parameter is dilution rate (D, h−1) that causes the increase of specific growth rate (μ, h−1). When the acceleration of dilution (a) is chosen correctly then D = μ as in chemostat. The problem of choosing the correct acceleration of dilution has been studied with Escherichia coli and Lactococcus lactis resulting recommended range of 0.01-0.005 h−2.In D-stat dilution rate is always constant as in chemostat, but after reaching steady state environmental parameter other than dilution rate is changed. For instance temperature, pH or acetate concentration has been smoothly changed in bioreactor.Turbidostat type changestats are called Z-auxoaccelerostats (pH-auxoaccelerostat, CO2-auxoaccelerostat). In similar to D-stat after reaching steady state a selected environmental parameter is changed.|$|E
50|$|While most <b>turbidostats</b> use a spectrophotometer/turbidometer {{to measure}} the optical density for control purposes, there exist other methods, such as {{dielectric}} permittivity.|$|R
40|$|Bacteria are the {{principal}} consumers of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the ocean and predation of bacteria makes organic carbon available to higher trophic levels. The efficiency with which bacteria convert the consumed carbon (C) into biomass (i. e., carbon growth efficiency, Y) determines their ecological as well as biogeochemical role in marine ecosystems. Yet, it is still unclear how changes in temperature will affect Y and, hence, the transfer of consumed C to higher trophic levels. Here, we experimentally investigated the effect of temperature on metabolic functions of coastal microbial communities inoculated in both nutrient-limited chemostats and nutrient–unlimited <b>turbidostats.</b> We inoculated chemostats and <b>turbidostats</b> with coastal microbial communities into seawater culture medium augmented with 20 and 100 μmol L− 1 of glucose respectively and measured CO 2 production, carbon biomass and cell abundance. Chemostats were cultured between 14 and 26 °C and specific growth rates (μ) between 0. 05 and 6. 0 day− 1, <b>turbidostats</b> were cultured between 10 and 26 °C with specific growth rates ranging from 28 to 62 day− 1. In chemostats under substrate limitation, which is common in the ocean, the specific respiration rate (r, day− 1) showed no trend with temperature and was roughly proportional to μ, implying that carbon growth efficiency (Y) displayed no tendency with temperature. The response was very different in <b>turbidostats</b> under temperature-limited, nutrient-repleted growth, here μ increased with temperature but r decreased resulting in an increase of Y with temperature (Q 10 : 2. 6). Comparison of our results with data from {{the literature on the}} respiration rate and cell weight of monospecific bacteria indicates that in general the literature data behaved similar to chemostat data, showing no trend in specific respiration with temperature. We conclude that respiration rates of nutrient-limited bacteria measured at a certain temperature cannot be adjusted to different temperatures with a temperature response function similar to Q 10 or Arrhenius. However, the cellular respiration rate and carbon demand rate (both: mol C cell− 1 day− 1) show statistically significant relations with cellular carbon content (mol C cell− 1) in chemostats, <b>turbidostats,</b> and the literature data...|$|R
50|$|Batch {{culture is}} the most common {{laboratory}} growth method in which bacterial growth is studied, but it is only one of many. It is ideally spatially unstructured and temporally structured. The bacterial culture is incubated in a closed vessel with a single batch of medium. In some experimental regimes, some of the bacterial culture is periodically removed and added to fresh sterile medium. In the extreme case, this leads to the continual renewal of the nutrients. This is a chemostat, also known as continuous culture. It is ideally spatially unstructured and temporally unstructured, in a steady state defined by the rates of nutrient supply and bacterial growth. In comparison to batch culture, bacteria are maintained in exponential growth phase, and the growth rate of the bacteria is known. Related devices include <b>turbidostats</b> and auxostats.|$|R
30|$|From a {{biological}} {{point of view}} and the mechanism of <b>turbidostat,</b> if the wash-out rate (the output constant of <b>turbidostat)</b> is larger than the maximum growth rate (the yield constant of <b>turbidostat),</b> there is no microorganism in the culture vessel. In other words, if the maximum growth rate is smaller than the wash-out rate, the population will be extinct. The proof in this section is based on m>d+kx.|$|E
30|$|In this paper, {{stochastic}} {{factors are}} introduced to the mathematical model of microorganism culture in the <b>turbidostat.</b> The maximum growth rate in system (1.1) is perturbed by stochastic phenomena such as the birth rate and the variation of environment. We show that oscillations may occur for system (1.1) when white noise exists. Under the condition of white noise and the feedback control of the <b>turbidostat,</b> system (1.1) may be persistent (stochastically persistent) as described by Theorem 3.1 (Theorem 3.2), {{and it has a}} stationary distribution. On the contrary, the microorganism x(t) in the <b>turbidostat</b> might be extinct as displayed by Theorem 3.3 because of white noise and the feedback control of the <b>turbidostat.</b> We explicitly discuss those phenomena with the following three examples, respectively.|$|E
30|$|The <b>turbidostat</b> is an {{important}} laboratory apparatus used to culture the microorganisms continuously. It is of both mathematical and ecological interest since its applicability in microbiology and population biology.

40|$|The {{cyanobacterium}} Planktothrix agardhii, {{which is}} dominant in many shallow eutrophic lakes, can produce hepatotoxic microcystins. Currently, more than 70 different microcystin variants have been described, which differ in toxicity. In this study, {{the effect of}} photon irradiance on the production of different microcystin variants by P. agardhii was investigated using light-limited <b>turbidostats.</b> Both {{the amount of the}} mRNA transcript of the mcyA gene and the total microcystin production rate increased with photon irradiance up to 60 µmol m– 2 s– 1, but they started to decrease with irradiance greater than 100 µmol m– 2 s– 1. The cellular content of total microcystin remained constant, independent of the irradiance. However, of the two main microcystin variants detected in P. agardhii, the microcystin-DeRR content decreased twofold with increased photon irradiance, whereas the microcystin-DeLR content increased threefold. Since microcystin-DeLR is considerably more toxic than microcystin-DeRR, this implies that P. agardhii becomes more toxic at high light intensities.

40|$|Increasing salinities in {{freshwater}} ecosystems {{caused by}} agricultural practices, droughts, or rise in sea level {{are likely to}} affect the species composition of phototrophic microorganisms. Cosmopolitan freshwater cyanobacteria of the Microcystis genus can produce the toxin microcystin, and present a potential health risk in many eutrophic lakes. In this study, M. aeruginosa Strain PCC 7806 was grown in semi-continuous <b>turbidostats</b> to investigate the effect of increasing salinity on growth rate, microcystin cell quota, microcystin production and extracellular microcystin concentration. Specific growth rate, microcystin cell quota and microcystin production remained more or less unaffected by salinity levels up to 10 g l– 1. Specific growth rate collapsed when salinity was increased beyond 10 g l– 1 for several weeks. Cell size and microcystin cell quota decreased while extracellular microcystin concentrations increased at salinities above 10 g l– 1, indicating leakage and/or cell lysis. Salt-shock experiments revealed that M. aeruginosa can temporarily endure salinities as high as 17. 5 g l– 1. These results indicate that, for a freshwater species, M. aeruginosa has a high salt tolerance. Rising salinities in freshwater ecosystems are therefore unlikely to suppress M. aeruginosa blooms, and may in fact enhance the exposure of aquatic organisms to elevated concentrations of extracellular microcystins...|$|R
40|$|Temperature and {{elemental}} composition are key {{factors that affect}} life history traits in algae. Climate change is predicted to cause major temperature changes in the ocean that may affect algal populations, seasonal dynamic and stratification patterns with profound ecological impact. The determination of how species specific life history traits in algae may vary depending on bioavailable phosphorus (P) and temperature is therefore of vital importance. The growth rate and cell size is of fundamental importance for phytoplankton ecology and evolution. Theory predicts smaller cell size at increasing temperature, either directly related to temperature or indirectly through nutrient scarcity. To address these issues, a factorial experiment with Emiliania huxleyi, Chrysochromulina rotalis and Prymnesium polylepis was conducted. In order to effectively induce P limitation, the cultures with lower P were cultured as chemostats, while the cultures with elevated P were grown as <b>turbidostats.</b> Responses to temperature and P were studied in terms of cellular RNA content, alkaline phosphatase activity, stoichiometry and genome size, combined with quantitative measurements of density and cell size. In general all parameters responded to P and temperature, yet with somewhat different responses for different algae. The results strongly indicate that temperature is the governing factor of plasticity in cell size as predicted from Temperature-Size Rules. The growth rate was primarily affected by P-treatment. The stoichiometric response show that N:P combined with RNA indicate a strong allocation to rRNA rich ribosomes with increased growth rate. The study of change in genome- to cell size was not conclusive, but the results indicate no significant correlation in the study. These findings may indicate a selection for smaller cell size if the predicted climate change results in further increase in oceanic temperature. An increase in stratification and reduced mixing will also affect growth patterns and stoichiometric responses, and potentially seasonal dynamics with profound ecological impact...|$|R
30|$|The {{continuous}} culture of microorganism, {{such as the}} chemostat and the <b>turbidostat,</b> is a significant way in reality. According to the mechanism of <b>turbidostat,</b> a number of mathematical models were introduced to describe the change rate of microorganism and nutrient. Herbert et al. [1] constructed the basic model with a constant dilution rate, {{but they did not}} give a thorough analysis. Smith et al. [2] completely analyzed the model proposed by [1]. Li [3] introduced a competition <b>turbidostat</b> model with inconstant dilution rate d+k_ 1 x_ 1 (t)+k_ 2 x_ 2 (t) and analyzed dynamic behaviors of the system. The above-mentioned systems are often described by ordinary differential equations.|$|E

Using the Liapunov–LaSalle invariance principle, we show that the washout equilibrium is global asymptotic stability for any time delay. Furthermore, based on some knowledge of limit set, we show the necessary and sufficient conditions of permanent of the <b>turbidostat</b> model. Finally, numerical simulations are offered to support our results.|$|E
40|$|Steady {{states of}} growth were {{established}} in continuous culture, both as chemostats and <b>turbidostats,</b> using a cell suspension of Acer pseudoplatanus L. Stable states were maintained {{over a wide range}} of dilution rates in chemostat cultures. The relationships between stead-state biomass, the concentration of nitrate (the limiting nutrient) and dilution rate were generally that to be expected from chemostat theory although the yield coefficient was not a constant. The size, composition and physiological state of Acer cells depended upon growth rate. There was no significant alteration in the basic growth processes of Acer cells transferred from batch to continuous cultures. The growth of Acer cells in chemostats was not entirely predictable. Furthermore, the specific growth rate of batch cultures of Acer cells was found to vary (mean doubling time = 70 hours; minimum = 20 hours). The rate of cell division in batch cultures of Acer cells was increased by increasing the initial concentration of 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid. Cell division in batch cultures of Acer was readily synchronised by a simple starvation and regrowth treatment. It was possible to follow the growth of cultures through up to five synchronous cell generations, with an average 85 % participation at each cytokinesis. Some basic markers in the cell cycle of Acer cells were established and model cell cycles constructed. DNA synthesis was restricted to a period of ca. 15 hours. G 2 was relatively constant at ca. 16 hours. Nuclear division (1 - 2 hours) was separated from cell division by a 10 -hour lag. G 1 was most variable (13 - 37 hours) producing variation in cell-cycle times coincident with that of specific growth rate in random cultures. S-phase or its initiation was coincident with other periodic, metabolic events...|$|R
40|$|Pseudomonas strains {{have long}} been proven to be {{effective}} in aromatic pollutant conversion. Typically, Pseudomonas strains growth on aromatic species is characterized by substrate inhibition and the kinetic parameters are assessed working out results of batch tests. On the other hand, continuous cultures operated under steady state conditions most closely reflect realistic operational conditions and are, as such, better suited for reliable assessment of kinetic parameters. The peculiar growth kinetics makes the chemostat intrinsically unstable, so that properly tuned control systems are required to counterbalance the inherent process instability. <b>Turbidostats</b> and nutristats {{have been reported in the}} literature as possible configurations of controlled chemostat to accomplish continuously operated cultures. However, it may be difficult to continuously measure state variables like biomass or carbon-source concentrations as compared with dissolved oxygen concentration. The present study addresses the characterization of the kinetics of Pseudomonas sp. OX 1 growth using phenol as carbon and energy source. Tests were carried out in a chemostat equipped with a dilution rate control unit. The dissolved oxygen concentration was adopted as the controlled variable and an ad-hoc proportional-integral control loop was developed. A test procedure was purposely adopted in which the control system forced the chemostat to operate steadily under conditions that would otherwise be inherently unstable. Tests demonstrated that the control strategy was successful in stabilizing steady state continuous cultures at phenol concentration characterized by unstable behaviour. The unstable branch of the growth kinetics was characterized. Moreover, phenol degradation under starving conditions was investigated. The specific growth rate () as a function of pH are well fitted by the Haldane model, data regression yielding max = 0. 26 h- 1, KM = 0. 005 g/L and KI = 0. 2 g/L.

Since actual experiments show that the constant yield cannot explain the oscillatory phenomenon in the chemostat, and the greater the nutrient concentrate is the lower the consuming rate is. However, mostly for the <b>turbidostat</b> model {{we assume that the}} yield term is a constant. Based on the facts, a variable yield should be considered for the <b>turbidostat</b> model and the model with variable yield will have more complicated dynamic behaviors than that with constant yield.|$|E
30|$|From a {{biological}} {{point of view}} and real condition, if the concentration of the microorganism in the culture vessel is large but the wash-out rate is too small, it will affect the growth of the microorganism in the <b>turbidostat.</b> On the contrary, if the concentration of the microorganism is quite small, the fixed wash-out rate will cause the waste of the nutrient. Based on the above phenomenon, we construct a <b>turbidostat</b> model with linear wash-out rate d+kx(t). Due to the stochastic destabilizations, the maximum growth rate, one of the essential parameters in microorganism cultivation, will undergo variations at different times in the <b>turbidostat.</b> That is, if the birth (death) rate increases (decreases) or the temperature and food are sufficient, the maximum growth rate occurs in advance. If the birth (death) rate decreases (increases) or the temperature and food are insufficient in the system, the maximum growth rate delays. Therefore, the maximum growth rate undergoes a random change.|$|E

30|$|To sum {{up all the}} {{analysis}} given above, we have investigated the dynamic behaviors of a <b>turbidostat</b> model with white noise. The importance of the conclusion in the realistic issue can be explained as follows. Since the stochastic perturbation is inevitable, {{it is reasonable to}} investigate the persistence of the stochastic system more than the stability of the deterministic model. Comparing the stochastic model (1.1) and the corresponding deterministic model (α= 0 in model (1.1)) with numerical simulations, we find that stochastic phenomena, either the internal factors or the external phenomena, have negative effect on dynamical behaviors. To begin with, the break-even concentration of persistence for the stochastic model is larger than that for the deterministic model (when α= 0). The condition of extinction is also larger than that in the deterministic model. Moreover, stochastic destabilization may cause the fluctuation centering on the value of deterministic model in the <b>turbidostat</b> as is depicted in Figure  1 (a) and Figure  2 (a), Figure  3 (a) and Figure  4 (a) and Figure  5 (a) and Figure  6 (a), which means the stochastic factors may affect the culture of microorganism in the <b>turbidostat.</b>|$|E
30|$|It {{was shown}} in [17] that the {{coexistence}} of two organisms was achieved in the <b>turbidostat.</b> While it was also shown in [27] that the coexistence was achieved if we consider system (1.1) with the delay on the dilution rate. In this paper, system (1.1) with the time delay of digestion was investigated. By choosing the time delay as the bifurcation parameter and analyzing the characteristic equation, we obtained sufficient conditions for the local stability of the positive equilibrium {{and the existence of}} a Hopf bifurcation. The direction, stability, and the other properties of the bifurcating periodic solutions were determined by the normal form theory and the center manifold theorem.

30|$|Comparing Figure  1 (Figure  3) and Figure  2 (Figure  4), we {{find that}} the {{stochastic}} factors, such as the variation of environment, may cause sustained fluctuation for the microorganism, but the microorganism will also be persistent in the <b>turbidostat</b> because system (1.1) has a stationary distribution described in Theorem 3.2.|$|E
40|$|A {{kinetic model}} is {{presented}} that describes functional biomass, starch and storage lipid (TAG) synthesis in the microalga Neochloris oleoabundans {{as a function}} of nitrogen and light supply rates to a nitrogen-limited <b>turbidostat</b> cultivation system. The model is based on the measured electron distribution in N. oleoabundans, which showed that starch is the primary storage component, whereas TAG was only produced after an excess of electrons was generated, when growth was limited by nitrogen supply. A fixed 8. 6 % of the excess electrons ended up in TAG, suggesting close metabolic interactions between nitrogen assimilation and TAG accumulation, such as a shared electron pool. The proposed model shows that by manipulating the cultivation conditions in a light or nitrogen limited <b>turbidostat,</b> algal biomass composition can be customised and the volumetric productivities and yields of the major biomass constituents can be changed on demand...|$|E

30|$|Since the {{perturbation}} {{is inevitable}} in real conditions, {{an increasing number}} of researchers have realized that some phenomena, such as time delays [4] and stochastic factors [5], could also cause various dynamical behaviors that are different from the conclusions derived from ordinary differential equations. May [5] pointed out that parameters characterizing the natural biological systems have random influence. Mao [6] also emphasized the significant role of stochastic models in many ways of science and industry. Based on the above tendency and real conditions, the effect of stochastic disturbance on population dynamic has received and has been persistently receiving more attention. In microorganism cultivation, the sense of the stochasticity in the <b>turbidostat</b> may be arisen {{as a result of the}} destabilizations such as the uncertainty of the birth rate and the stochastic variations of environmental conditions. In particular, the survival rate is not always equivalent to constant due to the feedback phenomenon in the <b>turbidostat.</b> In order to explain those stochastic phenomena, scholars use white noise to represent destabilization from a biological point of view in generally.

A reciprocating pumping mode of the medium is introduced to obtain more gentle clearance of membranes than that provided by rotation or stirring in other membrane fermentors.
