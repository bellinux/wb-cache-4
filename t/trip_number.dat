The Philippine National Railways {{had their}} Bicol Express and Mayon Limited as their inter-city rail service brands. The Bicol Express leaves Manila and passes through cities of Manila, Pasay, Muntinlupa. The train also passes {{the provinces of}} Laguna, Quezon, and Camarines Sur before arrives at Naga City. The train leaves Manila at 06:30pm PST (UTC+8) and arrives at NAGA at 04:30am PST (UTC+8). The return trip leaves NAGA at 06:30pm PST (UTC+8) and arrives at MANILA at 04:30am PST (UTC+8). The trip clocks 10 hours or 600 minutes. The trip is {{designated}} 611 for southbound and 612 for northbound. Also, The Mayon Limited leaves Manila at 08:30pm PST (UTC+8) and arrives at Ligao at 07:00am PST (UTC+8).

The southbound train operates as <b>trip</b> <b>number</b> 713 (de luxe) or 815 (ordinary) and the northbound train operates as <b>trip</b> <b>number</b> 714 (de luxe) or 816 (ordinary).

30|$|The large {{level of}} intrapersonal {{variability}} in daily <b>trip</b> <b>numbers</b> already {{demonstrated in the}} literature is confirmed. Systematic day-to-day variability is shown to have an extremely low share in intrapersonal variability. The global picture is that intrapersonal variability is large while systematic day-to-day variability is marginal. Moreover, a striking result is that socio-demographic characteristics are mostly unable to explain the level of intrapersonal variability. The results reveal that individual behaviour is neither completely habitual nor completely random. On the one hand, intrapersonal variability {{is more important than}} the interpersonal one as regards daily <b>trip</b> <b>numbers</b> for the realization of mobility needs. On the other hand, activity time allocation and sequencing show an inverse trend, which can be linked with the habitual part of behaviour and the social role of the individual (through e.g. work, childcare and other activities).|$|R
30|$|First, {{the total}} {{variability}} in daily <b>trip</b> <b>numbers</b> (TSS, {{divided by the}} number of days on which this statistic is computed) is roughly the same, whatever the five periods considered (from Monday-Friday to Saturday-Sunday, i.e. five, six and seven days or only the weekend). This indicates that the number and the type of days for which variability is computed have no incidence on TSS level.|$|R

The model consists of three sub-models: road system, car trip generation-attraction and traffic diversion. Network performance is assessed on two criteria; <b>trip</b> <b>number</b> criterion on which the aggregate number of car trips diverted onto expressway is maximized and travel hour criterion on which the travel hours of car trips integrated over the road system; surface and expressway, is minimized. Optimization is tried by numerical calculation for some sets of parameters in the model. The results are summarized as follows; (1) simultaneous optimization of price and spatial formation of the expressway network is possible on each of criteria, (2) <b>trip</b> <b>number</b> criterion produces lower pricing and smaller network while travel hour criterion does higher pricing and larger network, (3) optimum solution lies in a delicate relation of price and spatial network formation {{that comes from the}} balance constraint...|$|E
30|$|Since {{we suspect}} that socio-demographic status might explain the level of intrapersonal variability, linear {{regression}} models are employed to investigate the effects of socio-demographic variables on individual intrapersonal day by day variability, i.e. the <b>number</b> of daily <b>trips,</b> <b>number</b> of home-based tours, time use allocation and daily activity sequence. As shown previously, Saturday and Sunday play a specific role in mobility and activity, so this analysis of variability is performed on the Monday-Friday period.

30|$|A further {{breakdown}} of within person variability (WPSS) into between-day (systematic day-to-day) and within-day variability {{shows that the}} systematic day-to-day variability (BDSS) has an extremely low share of WPSS (about 5  % for the Monday-Sunday period). The intrapersonal variability in <b>trip</b> <b>numbers</b> can hardly {{be related to the}} peculiarities of the days in the week (e.g. alternation of days during the working week or during the weekend).

40|$|Summary. Size {{polymorphism}} is {{an important}} life history trait in bumblebees with strong impact on individual behav-ior and colony organization. Within a colony larger workers tend to serve as foragers, while smaller workers fulfill in-hive tasks. It is often assumed that size-dependent division of labor relates to differences in task performance. In this study we examined size-dependent interindividual variability in foraging, i. e. whether foraging behavior and foraging capa-bility of bumblebee workers are affected by their size. We observed two freely foraging Bombus terrestris colonies and measured i) <b>trip</b> <b>number,</b> ii) trip time, iii) proportion of nectar trips, and iv) nectar foraging rate of different sized foragers. In all observation periods large foragers exhibited a significantly higher foraging rate than small foragers. None {{of the other three}} foraging parameters was affected by worker size. Thus, large foragers contributed disproportionately more to the current nectar influx of their colony. We provide a detailed discussion of the possible proximate mechanisms underlying the differences in foraging rate...|$|E

Each generated carpool alternative was included in a choice task together with the respondent's current car alternative. The choices were analyzed using a mixed multinomial logit model. The model estimation process showed that almost all attributes significantly influence the attractiveness of carpooling in an expected direction. Most influential are the time and costs related attributes. No significant effect was found for the minimum number of persons in the carpool vehicle...|$|E
