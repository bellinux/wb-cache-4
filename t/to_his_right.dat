5|$|It is {{possible}} that Taylor overshot Castaway Cay and instead reached another land mass in southern Abaco Island. He then proceeded northwest as planned. He fully expected to find the Grand Bahama Island lying {{in front of him}} as expected. Instead, he eventually saw a land mass <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>right</b> side, the northern part of Abaco Island. Believing that this landmass <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>right</b> was the Grand Bahama Island and his compass was malfunctioning, he set a course to what he thought was southwest to head straight back to Fort Lauderdale. However, in reality this changed his course farther northwest, toward open ocean.|$|E
5|$|Four {{minutes later}} Ian Callaghan put a high {{ball into the}} penalty area towards Toshack. Rainer Bonhof under {{pressure}} from Toshack handled the ball for a penalty. However, Keegan's penalty was saved by Borussia goalkeeper Wolfgang Kleff diving <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>right.</b> A few minutes later Borussia's Dietmar Danner's shot hit the post.|$|E
5|$|In late 1993, {{in order}} to make Todd look more menacing, he was given a scar <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>right</b> cheek by Marty's friend, Luna Moody, when she hit him in his face with a crowbar while {{preventing}} his attempt to rape Marty for a second time. The camera would often close in on and emphasize Todd's scar, which later became synonymous with the character.|$|E
50|$|He was {{admitted}} <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>rights</b> for retirement after 25 {{years of service}} on March 21, 1968.|$|R
60|$|Arthur {{set off to}} take {{possession}} of his dukedom, and was soon delighted to hear of a fresh disturbance between his uncle and the King of France, hoping that he might thus come <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>rights.</b>|$|R
50|$|Although {{the real}} Tom Driscoll is {{restored}} <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>rights,</b> <b>his</b> life {{changes for the}} worse. Having been raised as a slave, he feels intense unease in white society. At the same time, as a white man, he is essentially excluded from the company of blacks.|$|R
5|$|In {{the group}} of people {{gathered}} below the king, in another acknowledgement of the burghers' importance, is burgher Jan Kiliński (24), {{one of the leaders}} of the Kościuszko Uprising. <b>To</b> <b>his</b> <b>right,</b> at the edge of the crowd, is the priest Clemens Maria Hofbauer (25), who ran an orphanage and a school in Warsaw and is canonized as a saint in the Catholic church.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{decided not}} to seek a third term as governor, with an eye towards {{election}} to the U.S. Senate. In 1857, while returning from Washington, his train derailed, causing serious damage <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>right</b> arm. This injury would trouble him {{in the years to}} come.|$|E
5|$|Shevchenko, who {{had scored}} the decisive penalty against Juventus' Gianluigi Buffon in 2003, {{then had to}} score or Liverpool would win. He hit his penalty {{straight}} {{down the middle of}} the goal. Dudek went down <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>right,</b> but blocked the shot with his left hand. Liverpool thus won the penalty shootout by a score of 3–2.|$|E
50|$|Neely {{accepted}} the Oilers contract offer (which also included rights {{to own a}} Houston gas station), but requested it be kept secret to remain eligible {{to play in the}} Gator Bowl. When he learned that the Colts traded <b>his</b> <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> the Cowboys, he began negotiating with Dallas, and returned <b>his</b> check <b>to</b> the Oilers. Litigation ensued between the Oilers and Cowboys in regards <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>rights.</b>|$|R
5000|$|During his testimony, Todd {{declared}} that he [...] "never knew" [...] the State Department's Alger Hiss, but refused to answer according <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>rights</b> under the Fifth Amendment when asked whether he knew Nathan Gregory Silvermaster or William Ludwig Ullman, two individuals implicated in 1948 for Soviet espionage activity.|$|R
5000|$|The Yorkshire Post {{commented on}} Elgee's work 'The Moorlands of North East Yorkshire': 'Elgee may by his several studies {{historic}} and natural historical be conceded rights of pre-eminent domain over the moorlands of North Eastern Yorkshire, {{and he has}} added <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>rights</b> by this substantial and handsome book.' ...|$|R
5|$|A {{few feet}} <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>right</b> sits his wife, darning {{the clothes on}} her lap and those sprawled on the floor, while a crying infant, who is upset and hungry, goes {{unattended}} in the only bed. Next to the poet's wife, by the open door, an angry milkmaid presents her substantial bill, demanding payment for milk, underlining the poet's refusal to provide for his family by getting himself a proper job. The cupboard stands open and empty, save for a mouse; near the door, a dog steals {{the last of the}} family's food from a plate.|$|E
5|$|Alexander made a {{cautious}} and slow advance, intending to base his strategy {{on the structure}} of the Persian force. He led a flank of his Companion cavalry on the right, while the Thessalian cavalry were dispatched to the left, as a counter to Nabarsanes' mounted unit. Aware {{of the importance of the}} foothills <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>right,</b> Alexander sent a band of light infantry, archers, and cavalry to displace the defence Darius had stationed there. The enterprise was successful – those Persians not killed were forced to seek refuge higher in the mountains.|$|E
5|$|All {{witnesses}} {{generally agreed}} that the first two shots were almost indistinguishable from each other. General firing immediately broke out. Virgil and Wyatt thought Tom was armed. When shooting started, the horse that Tom McLaury held jumped to one side. Wyatt said he also saw Tom throw his hand <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>right</b> hip. Virgil said Tom followed the horse's movement, hiding behind it, and fired once or twice over the horse's back.|$|E
50|$|At trial {{the judge}} {{held that the}} shareholder's {{agreement}} was invalidated because it sought to fetter T.B.L's statutory power to increase its capital. The Court of Appeal, by a majority, upheld this decision. Russell appealed, although now claiming only a declaration as <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>rights</b> and not also an injunction.|$|R
50|$|In {{the same}} year William III died in England. William Hyacinth {{traveled}} to Paris to secure the support of France with regard <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>rights</b> of inheritance. Other claimants were King Frederick I of Prussia and John William Friso of Nassau-Dietz, who was designated as the sole heir in William III's testament.|$|R
50|$|In 1108-1109 a seigneur named Aymon Vaire-Vache {{seized the}} lordship of Bourbon from his nephew, Archambaud, a minor. Louis demanded the boy be {{restored}} <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>rights</b> but Aymon refused the summons. Louis raised his army and besieged Aymon at his castle at Germigny-sur-l'Aubois, forcing its surrender and enforcing {{the rights of}} Archambaud.|$|R
5|$|Anderson {{scored the}} first penalty in sudden death. Kalou then sent Van der Sar {{the wrong way}} to make it 5–5. Giggs was next up and he was also successful. Van der Sar then pulled off the crucial save for United; he pointed to his left to {{indicate}} to Nicolas Anelka that he thought he would kick to that side, as had the six players who had kicked before him, only to correctly dive <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>right</b> to deny Anelka, whose kick was at a good height to be saved, securing European football's top prize for United {{for the third time in}} their history.|$|E
5|$|Another {{feature of}} Wood's {{conducting}} was his insistence on accurate tuning; before each rehearsal and concert he would check {{the instrument of}} {{each member of the}} woodwind and string sections against a tuning fork. He persisted in this practice until 1937, when the excellence of the BBC Symphony Orchestra persuaded him that it was no longer necessary. To improve ensemble, Wood experimented with the layout of the orchestra. His preferred layout was to have the first and second violins grouped together on his left, with the cellos <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>right,</b> a layout that has since become common.|$|E
5|$|Another figure, to {{the right}} of Małachowski, is being carried; he is Kazimierz Nestor Sapieha (5), marshal of the Lithuanian {{confederation}} and the second Sejm marshal. He is dressed in more traditional Polish clothing. Between Małachowski and Sapieha, the head of Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz (6), a well-known writer, is visible. He appears to be carrying Sapieha. The other figure carrying Sapieha, <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>right,</b> is Michał Zabiełło (7).|$|E
2500|$|As cardinal-patriarch, Sarto avoided {{political}} involvement, allocating {{his time}} for social works and strengthening parochial banks. [...] However, {{in his first}} pastoral letter to the Venetians, Cardinal Sarto argued that in matters pertaining to the pope, [...] "There should be no questions, no subtleties, no opposing of personal <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>rights,</b> but only obedience." ...|$|R
50|$|Hugh of Brienne {{himself is}} said to have tried <b>to</b> sell <b>his</b> <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> Alfonso III of Aragon in 1289.|$|R
50|$|As {{a result}} of his injuries, Ota was unable {{thereafter}} <b>to</b> move <b>his</b> <b>right</b> arm, right shoulder and fingers properly, causing an end <b>to</b> <b>his</b> professional race career.|$|R
5|$|Early in the 2009–10 season, Salo {{suffered}} a medial collateral ligament (MCL) sprain <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>right</b> knee {{during a game}} against the Dallas Stars on 11 October 2009. Sidelined for seven games, he returned {{by the end of the}} month. Salo missed additional games during the season to various injuries, ending the campaign with nine goals and 28 points in 68 games. Towards the second half of the season, Salo took on a more defensive role, replacing Willie Mitchell, who was sidelined with a concussion, as the team's primary shutdown defenceman.|$|E
5|$|Embarking for the Western Front, the 12th Battalion {{joined the}} British Expeditionary Force upon arrival in France on 7 April 1916. Eight days later, Whittle was {{promoted}} to lance sergeant. Posted to the Fleurbaix sector of France, the 12th Battalion was engaged in minor operations until July. During this time, Whittle was wounded on 18 June, suffering a gunshot wound <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>right</b> arm. Initially admitted to the 3rd Field Ambulance, the injury necessitated treatment in England and Whittle {{was transferred to the}} 1st Auxiliary Hospital, Harefield. He rejoined the 12th Battalion on 16 September following recuperation.|$|E
5|$|For part of 31 October, Derrick assumed {{command of}} his company after all of the unit's {{officers}} had been killed or wounded in fierce fighting. On 21 November 1942, Derrick was briefly admitted to the 2/3rd Australian Field Ambulance with slight shrapnel wounds <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>right</b> hand and buttock. Twelve days later, the 2/48th Battalion left El Alamein and returned to Gaza in Palestine, where, later that month, Derrick attended a corps patrolling course. In January 1943, the 2/48th Battalion sailed home to Australia, aboard the S.S. Nieuw Amsterdam, {{along with the rest}} of the 9th Division.|$|E
50|$|According <b>to</b> <b>his</b> early biographers, it {{was while}} riding in the forest of Rouvray that William the Conqueror decided <b>to</b> assert <b>his</b> <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> the throne of England.|$|R
25|$|In 1970, Pearson {{underwent}} a surgery <b>to</b> have <b>his</b> <b>right</b> eye removed {{in order to}} remove a tumor in that area.|$|R
50|$|It is {{believed}} that Talbot became a Reformer because of the failed land grant which he considered <b>to</b> be <b>his</b> <b>right.</b>|$|R
5|$|Having joined Marseille's academy {{at the age}} of seven, Stéphane Sparagna {{spent his}} {{formative}} years developing his game in the club's La Commanderie academy. His progression into the first team was halted in September 2013, however, when he was forced to undergo surgery following a meniscus injury <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>right</b> knee which ruled him out for several months. Upon recovery, and following the appointment of former Argentina coach Marcelo Bielsa as manager, Sparagna made his noncompetitive debut for Marseille alongside fellow academy graduate Jérémie Porsan-Clemente in a friendly clash with Benfica in July 2014.|$|E
5|$|In the 37th minute, Bahr took a {{long shot}} from twenty-five yards out, but as Williams moved <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>right</b> to intercept, Gaetjens dived headlong near the penalty spot, and grazed the ball enough to {{put it to the}} left of the English goalkeeper, whose {{momentum}} prevented him from changing direction, and into the back of the net. The crowd exploded as the U.S. improbably led 1–0. As the half drew to a close, Finney had a chance to equalize, but the whistle blew before he could shoot.|$|E
5|$|In {{the week}} {{leading up to}} the race, Coulthard was leasing the Learjet of friend David Murray when the {{aeroplane}} developed engine trouble en route to Côte d'Azur International Airport in Nice, and crashed while attempting an emergency landing at Lyon-Satolas Airport, France. Coulthard, his then-girlfriend the American model Heidi Wichlinski and personal trainer/bodyguard Andy Matthews survived; Murray's personal pilot David Saunders and co-pilot Dan Worley died. Coulthard suffered from bruises <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>right</b> rib cage and severe grazed elbows in the crash. FIA Formula One Safety and Medical Delegate Sid Watkins declared that Coulthard was passed fit to compete in the race.|$|E
50|$|In July 2012, Barcelona decided <b>to</b> trade <b>his</b> <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> Unicaja for {{the rights}} of Álex Abrines, who moved to FC Barcelona.|$|R
40|$|Concurrent Sessions 11 (5) In “The Permissibility of Punishment”, Daniel McDermott {{offered an}} {{original}} version of retributive theory of punishment. According to McDermott, a wrongdoer, through his wrongdoing, denied the victim valuable moral goods {{which he is}} entitled to. Corrective justice requires, therefore, the wrongdoer <b>to</b> forfeit <b>his</b> <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> own moral goods to the victim, and this forfeiture of rights makes punishment permissible. I wish to critically assess McDermott’s theory in my paper. I will argue that, while McDermott’s theory represents an improvement over some existing retributive theories, it should nonetheless be rejected because (1) moral goods are not valuable to a person; (2) even assuming that moral goods are valuable to the victim, {{there is no reason}} to believe that corrective justice requires the wrongdoer <b>to</b> forfeit <b>his</b> <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> moral goods <b>to</b> the victim; (3) even assuming that the wrongdoer is required <b>to</b> forfeit <b>his</b> <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> moral goods <b>to</b> the victim, punishment is still not justified...|$|R
50|$|The {{appellant}} {{bought the}} land himself in order <b>to</b> protect <b>his</b> <b>rights.</b> <b>His</b> appeal <b>to</b> the Full Bench was dismissed, whereupon he {{appealed to the}} Appellate Division.|$|R
