5|$|The Octagon is also {{believed}} {{by some to}} be haunted by the spirits of African American slaves who once lived there. When the house held bells to summon servants, the spirits of the dead slaves would announce their presence by ringing these bells loudly. The ghostly bell ringing first occurred in the 1870s. General George D. Ramsay, Chief of Ordnance for the United States Army and commander of the Washington Arsenal in Washington, D.C., was attending a dinner at The Octagon when all <b>the</b> <b>bells</b> in the house began ringing. As Marian Gouverneur, wife of Samuel Laurence Gouverneur, Jr. (the first American consul in Foo Chow, China), related the story, General Ramsay seized the bell ropes to stop <b>the</b> <b>bells</b> from sounding, but to everyone's shock they did not stop ringing. Although Gouverneur's report was not made until 1911, the mysterious ringing of <b>the</b> <b>bells</b> had been reported in 1874 and again in 1889, each time attributed to the spirits of dead slaves.|$|E

5|$|A Cullompton {{man called}} Chubb {{travelled}} widely to repair bells {{during the reign}} of James I. In 1745 a vestry meeting determined that {{in order to reduce the}} cost of having the church bells repaired, <b>the</b> <b>bells</b> should be cast in some part of the almshouses, and a bell founder be found to work there.|$|E
50|$|In English style ringing <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> is rung up {{such that}} the clapper is resting on the lower edge of <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> when <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> is on <b>the</b> stay. During each swing, the clapper travels faster than <b>the</b> <b>bell,</b> {{eventually}} striking <b>the</b> soundbow and making <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> sound. <b>The</b> <b>bell</b> speaks roughly when horizontal as it rises, thus projecting the sound outwards. The clapper rebounds very slightly, allowing <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> to ring. At the balance point, the clapper passes {{over the top and}} rests against the soundbow.|$|R
50|$|Both wet {{bells and}} closed bells use a bell {{umbilical}} to provide surface supplied gas, electrical power, communications and heating water to <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> and through <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> gas panel to the divers. It may also return reclaimed breathing {{gas from the}} divers to the surface gas system. <b>The</b> <b>bell</b> umbilical is generally not intended for lifting <b>the</b> <b>bell.</b> <b>The</b> <b>bell</b> umbilical is connected to through-hull fittings on a closed bell, which are connected to <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> panel inside, for distribution to the interior of <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> and to <b>the</b> divers via the diver's umbilicals. <b>The</b> <b>bell</b> gas panel is operated by the bellman.|$|R

5|$|As {{part of the}} Liberty Bell Savings Bonds {{drive in}} 1950, 55replicas of the Liberty Bell (one each for the 48states, the District of Columbia, and the territories) were ordered by the United States Department of the Treasury and were cast in France by the Fonderie Paccard. <b>The</b> <b>bells</b> were to be {{displayed}} and rung on patriotic occasions. Many of <b>the</b> <b>bells</b> today are sited near state capitol buildings. Although Wisconsin's bell is now at its state capitol, initially it was sited {{on the grounds of}} the state's Girls Detention Center. Texas' bell is located inside the Academic Building on the campus of Texas A University in College Station. The Texas bell was presented to the university in appreciation of the service of the school's graduates. Walt Disney World has a replica of the Liberty Bell, which is located in Liberty Square in the Magic Kingdom. The replica was cast from the mold of the actual Liberty Bell in 1989.|$|E

5|$|Several of <b>the</b> <b>bells</b> in the {{crossing}} tower were cast in 1887 by John Taylor & Co. However, earlier bells include {{those from the}} 18th century by the Bilbie family and one by William III & Richard II Purdue made in 1658.|$|E
40|$|Abstract − Bell provers {{have a wide}} usage for {{calibrating}} {{various types}} of flow meters by timing <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> ascendance. They are often used as a working standard. Known area of <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> along with measured displacement of <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> produce, with some measurement uncertainty, volume generated by <b>the</b> <b>bell.</b> This volume with measured time gives the flow generated by <b>the</b> <b>bell.</b> <b>The</b> temperature and {{the pressure of the}} gas in <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> are not constant. Further more the temperature and the pressure at the flow meter are not equal to those in <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> due to losses in pipes. Because of that it is imperative to measure all of them. When those measurands are stored in database entire measurement can be analyzed at referent conditions. In order to automate measurements with <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> prover, to improve the measurement uncertainty of the results, and to obtain some additional quantities like velocity and acceleration of <b>the</b> <b>bell,</b> computerized measurement equipment has been installed on <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> prover...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>bell</b> {{that sits}} outside the schoolhouse now {{has not always}} been with the school. After <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> was {{installed}} it stayed with the building until a reconstruction project took place on the building during <b>the</b> 1970s. <b>The</b> <b>bell</b> was dropped from the belfry and york was cracked or broke. <b>The</b> <b>bell</b> could not be reinstalled so it was left sitting on the ground until a local farmer bought <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> from <b>the</b> township, and then sold it to a family member who lived in Wichita, Kansas. Several attempts were made to buy <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> back to restore it with the building. However the owner refused to sell <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> until 1996 when he contacted the township and stated {{that he was willing to}} sell <b>the</b> <b>bell.</b> Two local people went to buy <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> and had <b>the</b> yoke fixed before donating it to the township. After almost 25 years after <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> was sold it was returned to the schoolhouse.|$|R
50|$|The type 1 wet bell {{does not}} have an {{umbilical}} supplying <b>the</b> <b>bell.</b> Umbilicals supply <b>the</b> divers directly from the surface, similar to a diving stage. Divers deploying from a type 1 bell will exit on the opposite side to where the umbilicals enter <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> so that <b>the</b> umbilicals pass through <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> and <b>the</b> divers can find their way back to <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> at all times by following the umbilical. Bailout from a type 1 bell is done by exiting <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> on <b>the</b> side that the umbilicals enter <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> so they no longer pass through <b>the</b> <b>bell,</b> leaving <b>the</b> divers free to surface.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>bells</b> {{that draw}} the knights to the Grail {{ceremony}} at Monsalvat in acts 1 and 3 have often proved problematic to stage. For the earlier performances of Parsifal in Bayreuth, Wagner had the Parsifal bell, a piano frame with four strings, constructed {{as a substitute}} for church bells. For the first performances, <b>the</b> <b>bells</b> were combined with tam-tam and gongs. However, the bell was used with the tuba, four tam-tams tuned to the pitch of the four chime notes and another tam-tam on which a roll is executed by using a drumstick. In modern-day performances, the Parsifal bell has been replaced with tubular bells or synthesizers to produce the desired notes. The thunder machine is used in the moment of the destruction of Klingsor's castle.|$|E
5|$|The {{clock and}} {{carillon}} (bell tower) of 23 bells was erected in 1922, {{the same year}} as Lutyens' memorial, on the corn exchange in the town centre. Three of <b>the</b> <b>bells</b> were inscribed with names of casualties from the war, chosen to represent all of Spalding's war dead, while others were inscribed with names of those involved in the commemorations. The corn exchange was demolished in 1972 and replaced with the South Holland Centre, an arts venue, with the clock and carillon re-housed in a tower on the roof. After refurbishment of the South Holland Centre in 1998, a new glass tower was built to house the clock and carillon after <b>the</b> <b>bells</b> were cleaned. On Armistice Day (11 November) 1998, the Western Front Association unveiled a plaque on the South Holland Centre to explain the significance of the clock tower.|$|E
5|$|A hairy and fiery star having {{then made}} its {{appearance}} for several days, the mathematicians declared {{that there would}} follow grievous pestilence, dearth and some great calamity. Calixtus, to avert the wrath of God, ordered supplications that if evils were impending for the human race He would turn all upon the Turks, the enemies of the Christian name. He likewise ordered, to move God by continual entreaty, that notice should be given by <b>the</b> <b>bells</b> to call the faithful at midday to aid by their prayers those engaged in battle with the Turk.|$|E
50|$|The clapper or {{tongue is}} {{manufactured}} {{in a similar}} process as <b>the</b> <b>bell.</b> Special care is given to cast the clapper at the proper weight, as a clapper that is too light will not bring out the true tones of <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> and a heavy clapper might cause <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> to crack. Holes are drilled {{into the top of}} <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> and <b>the</b> clapper is attached to the inside of <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> either by a metal link or by a leather strap. Finally <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> is installed in the tower.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>bell</b> in <b>the</b> roof turret {{dates from}} 1451 (inscription) {{and is in}} Zürich <b>the</b> oldest church <b>bell</b> at its {{original}} location. <b>The</b> <b>bell</b> is attached with metal bands, which are vertically inserted into the oak basement and into 35 cm horizontal flat iron passes. <b>The</b> <b>bell</b> bearing is remarkable, as <b>the</b> <b>bell's</b> axis protruding from the ridge, unrolling on the hammer-shaped head, and the rolling distance when ringing <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> is only about 7 cm. To produce the transverse force connections to <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> axis, it {{is linked to the}} outlying platings and under the belfry floor fixed with wooden screws.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>bell</b> {{remained}} submerged {{for over}} 40 years before a wealthy resident of Lake Geneva decided to surface <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> in 1960. <b>The</b> resident located <b>the</b> <b>bell,</b> and surfaced it with great difficulty, intent {{on making the}} future Illinois Freedom <b>Bell</b> <b>the</b> focal point of his new home. After <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> was salvaged he decided it did not suit his purposes. A young farmer from Johnsburg purchased <b>the</b> <b>bell,</b> and it was again kept in storage.|$|R
5|$|A {{traditional}} {{definition is}} {{that to be a}} Cockney, one had to be born within the sound of Bow Bells, situated in Cheapside. In general, the sound pattern would cover most of the City, and parts of the near East End such as Aldgate and Whitechapel, but it is unlikely that <b>the</b> <b>bells</b> would have been heard in the docklands. In practice, with Royal London the only maternal hospital nearby, few would today be born within earshot.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{the mayoral}} inaugurations, the {{marketplace}} was also the setting for other public events, particularly mourning processions on the deaths of monarchs, coronation celebrations, royal birthdays and celebrations of military victories. Firework displays and bonfires would be held on these occasions, accompanied by the local militia firing volleys and the ringing of <b>the</b> <b>bells</b> of the surrounding churches, while local residents and shopkeepers would illuminate their windows with lit candles. Often, particularly in the 18thcentury, temporary triumphal arches would be erected beside the Guildhall. Free beer would traditionally be distributed at these events, which would on occasion degenerate into drunken disorder.|$|E
5|$|Christ Church, {{although}} a larger building than St John's, {{is the daughter}} church in Radyr. Designed by the Llandaff diocesan surveyor George Halliday, the nave was ready for use at Easter 1904 and the chancel and tower were completed in November 1910. Also in 1910 John Taylor & Co of Loughborough cast a ring of eight bells for the tower.
