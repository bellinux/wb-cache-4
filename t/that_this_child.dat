5|$|Bree and her husband, Orson (Kyle MacLachlan), find it {{increasingly}} difficult to stage her fake pregnancy. Their hoax is almost revealed at a neighborhood barbecue when a fork stabs her pregnancy stomach pads. Orson suggests coming clean to avoid the humiliation if their lies were to be discovered, but Bree tells him <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>child</b> is her second chance at successfully raising a child. Meanwhile, Susan worries that Mike is dissatisfied with their marriage, especially after Adam, her new gynecologist, reveals that she may be entering menopause. However, Adam later informs Susan that his earlier assessment was a mistake and that she is pregnant.|$|E
25|$|From {{the date}} of the adoption, the child is under the legal {{guardianship}} of the new adopted parent(s) and thus should enjoy all the benefits from those family ties. This also means <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>child,</b> therefore, is cut off from all legal benefits (property, inheritance, etc.) from the family who had given him or her up for adoption.|$|E
25|$|In 1587, {{during a}} spiritual conference in Bohemia, Kelley {{informed}} Dee that the angel Uriel {{had ordered the}} men to share all their possessions, including their wives. By this time, Kelley had gained some renown as an alchemist and in fact was more sought-after than Dee in this regard: this was a line of work that had prospects for serious and long-term financial gain, especially among the royal families of central Europe. Dee, on the other hand, {{was more interested in}} communicating with the angels who he believed would help him solve the mysteries of the heavens through mathematics, optics, astrology, science and navigation. It may be that Kelley in fact wished to end Dee's dependence on him as a scryer for their increasingly lengthy and frequent spiritual conferences. The order for wife-sharing caused Dee great anguish, but he apparently did not doubt its genuineness. They apparently did share wives. However, Dee broke off the conferences immediately afterwards. Dee returned to England in 1589: Kelley went on to be the alchemist for Emperor Rudolf II. Nine months later, on Feb. 28, 1588, a son was born to Dee's wife, whom Dee baptized Theodorus Trebonianus Dee and raised as his own. It is possible <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>child</b> was Kelley's; Dee was 60 at the time, Edward Kelley was 32.|$|E

We're putting the future of humanity in the hands of the dispossessed and creating a new humanity to spring out of that." ...|$|E
2500|$|... 1) One of {{the stories}} talks about an event that {{occurred}} in a past life of Ashoka, {{when he was a}} small child named Jaya. Once when Jaya was playing on the roadside, the Buddha came by. The young child put a handful of earth in the Buddha’s begging bowl as his gift to the saint and declared his wish to one day become a great emperor and follower of the Buddha. The Buddha is said to have smiled a smile that “illuminated the universe with its rays of light”. These rays of light are then said to have re-entered the Buddha’s left palm, signifying <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>child</b> Jaya would, in his next life, become a great emperor. The Buddha is said to have even turned to his disciple Ananda and is said to have predicted <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>child</b> would be “a great, righteous chakravarti king, who would rule his empire from his capital at Pataliputra”.|$|E

[...] Bondi said Anderson died of oxygen deprivation after guards manhandled him and used excessive amounts of ammonia capsules when he became unresponsive while the nurse stood by and watched. [...] Defense attorneys said in opening statements that they would show Anderson's death {{could not have been}} prevented and was caused solely by sickle cell trait.|$|E
60|$|Seven years later--in 1467--he {{became the}} father of a daughter--Girolama de Borja--by a spinster, whose name again does not transpire. Like Pedro Luis she too was openly {{acknowledged}} by Cardinal Roderigo. It was widely believed <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>child's</b> mother was Madonna Giovanna de' Catanei, who soon became quite openly the cardinal's mistress, and was maintained by him in such state as might have become a maîtresse en titre. But, as we shall see later, the fact of that maternity of Girolama is doubtful in the extreme. It was never established, {{and it is difficult to}} understand why not if it were the fact.|$|R

2500|$|Martin Luther, who {{initiated}} the Protestant Reformation, said: [...] "Mother Mary, like us, {{was born in}} sin of sinful parents, but the Holy Spirit covered her, sanctified and purified her so <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>child</b> was born of flesh and blood, but not with sinful flesh and blood. The Holy Spirit permitted the Virgin Mary to remain a true, natural human being of flesh and blood, just as we. However, he warded off sin from her flesh and blood so that she became {{the mother of a}} pure child, not poisoned by sin as we are. For in that moment when she conceived, she was a holy mother filled with the Holy Spirit and her fruit is a holy pure fruit, at once God and truly man, in one person." [...] Some Lutherans, such as the members of the Anglo-Lutheran Catholic Church, support the doctrine.|$|E
2500|$|In Dune, Lady Jessica is {{pregnant}} when she undergoes the spice agony while among the Fremen; her resulting daughter, Alia, is born a full Reverend Mother, {{the mind of}} an adult in a child's body. She pretends to be a child, but others notice that she is different. The Bene Gesserit are eventually outraged and horrified by Alia's existence, but she is out of their control. Mohiam says, [...] "I've said too much, {{but the fact remains}} <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>child</b> who is not a child must be destroyed. Long were we warned against such a one and how to prevent such a birth, but one of our own has betrayed us." [...] In Children of Dune, an adult Alia eventually succumbs to the ancestral ego of her grandfather, the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, who wants nothing more than the destruction of the Atreides, and is given another opportunity, from the inside, to realize it.|$|E

40|$|Motor {{development}} of an infant from 6 to 18 months of age was observed to assess: (A) motor {{development of}} upper extremity in (grasp, reach, hand coordination, and the direction of development (proximal to distal)), (B) the effect of development on, prehension such as: (a) size, form, position of manipulated objects, (b) type of prehension patterns, and (c) relationships between reach patterns. It was found <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>child's</b> development of grasp, reach, and hand coordination agreed with standard developmental theories. However, {{in the direction of}} development (proximal to distal), a discrepancy with standard theories was observed. Prehension patterns partially depended on place, size, and shape of object. Various relationships between reach and prehension were also confirmed. The author believes this study can be helpful in the occupational therapy clinic for the development of treatment goals and to grade therapeutic activities...|$|R
40|$|Evoked otoacoustic {{emissions}} are well {{established as a}} hearing screening technique and are used extensively in paediatric audiology. They are believed to originate from the outer hair cells and can be detected in almost 100 % of normally hearing ears; even a mild hearing loss {{has been shown to}} abolish otoacoustic emissions. Results are presented of a baby boy born at 29 weeks' gestation requiring 77 days of neonatal care, but experiencing no complications following discharge from the neonatal unit. <b>This</b> <b>child</b> had clear bilateral evoked otoacoustic emissions at almost four months of age, but was subsequently found to have a profound bilateral hearing impairment and absent otoacoustic emissions. Radiological investigations revealed bilateral Mondini dysplasia, and <b>this</b> <b>child</b> has now been implanted with a multi-channel MXM Digisonic cochlear implant. He is progressing well and shows awareness of sound. Approximately 10 previous cases of otoacoustic emissions occurring in profoundly deaf ears {{have been reported in the}} literature. Although it is likely <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>child's</b> hearing loss was progressive in nature, the authors believe <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is the first reported case of otoacoustic emissions being recorded in the presence of Mondini dysplasia. This raises concerns about the use of neonatal screening in isolation without adequate mechanisms for later identification of hearing impairment, although it is acknowledged that it represents a rare situation...|$|R

It seemed strange <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>child,</b> so eminently adapted to purposes of rental, was not offered to me, at first, but I suppose the Irish ladies, who had the matter in charge, wanted to benefit themselves, or some of their near friends, before giving the general public of New Dublin a chance.|$|E
