5|$|A {{part of the}} South Downs, Willingdon Down is a {{designated}} Site of Special Scientific Interest. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>of</b> archaeological interest due to a Neolithic camp and burial grounds. The area is also a nationally uncommon tract of chalk grassland rich in species. Another SSSI which partially falls with the Eastbourne district is Seaford to Beachy Head. This site, of biological and geological interest, covers the coastline between Eastbourne and Seaford, plus the Seven Sisters country park and the Cuckmere valley. Several nature trails lead across the Downs to {{areas such as the}} nearby villages of East Dean and Birling Gap, and landmarks like the Seven Sisters, Belle Tout lighthouse and Beachy Head.|$|E
5|$|In general, avian {{influenza}} {{is a disease}} of birds caused by bird-specific influenza A virus that is not normally transferred to people; however, people in contact with live poultry are at the greatest risk of becoming infected with the virus and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>of</b> particular concern {{in areas such as}} Southeast Asia, where the disease is endemic in the wild bird population and domestic poultry can become infected. The virus possibly could mutate to become highly virulent and infectious in humans and cause an influenza pandemic.|$|E
5|$|In many {{recreational}} diving {{settings where}} air and nitrox are the widely used gases, nitrox cylinders are {{identified with a}} green stripe on yellow background. Aluminium diving cylinders may be painted or anodized and when anodized may be coloured or left in their natural silver. Steel diving cylinders are usually painted, to reduce corrosion, often yellow or white to increase visibility. In some industrial cylinder identification colour tables, yellow shoulders means chlorine and more generally within Europe it refers to cylinders with toxic and/or corrosive contents; but <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>of</b> no significance in scuba since gas fittings would not be compatible.|$|E

5|$|Folding@home (FAH or F@h) is a {{distributed}} computing project for disease research that simulates protein folding, computational drug design, {{and other types}} of molecular dynamics. The project uses the idle processing resources of thousands of personal computers owned by volunteers who have installed the software on their systems. Its main purpose is to determine the mechanisms of protein folding, which is the process by which proteins reach their final three-dimensional structure, and to examine the causes of protein misfolding. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>of</b> significant academic interest with major implications for medical research into Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, and many forms of cancer, among other diseases. To a lesser extent, Folding@home also tries to predict a protein's final structure and determine how other molecules may interact with it, which has applications in drug design. Folding@home is developed and operated by the Pande Laboratory at Stanford University, under the direction of Prof. Vijay Pande, and is shared by various scientific institutions and research laboratories across the world.|$|E
5|$|In {{temperate}} areas, {{the male}} owl moults rather {{later in the}} year than the female, {{at a time when there}} is an abundance of food, the female has recommenced hunting and the demands of the chicks are lessening. Unmated males without family responsibilities often start losing feathers earlier in the year. The moult follows a similar prolonged pattern to that of the female and the first sign that the male is moulting is often when a tail feather has been dropped at the roost. A consequence of moulting is the loss of thermal insulation. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>of</b> little importance in the tropics and barn owls here usually moult a complete complement of flight feathers annually. The hot-climate moult may still take place over a long period but is usually concentrated at a particular time of year outside the breeding season.|$|E

5|$|Max Weber was {{a pioneer}} in {{delineating}} a connection between capitalism and exceptionalism. In earlier texts, Maximiliano Korstanje explores the American exceptionalism {{and its effects on}} the current means of productions. This contribution to the existent literature is of paramount importance because of two main reasons. The first and most important, he relates capitalism to Protestantism. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>of</b> course nothing new, since Max Weber did it in the past. However, Korstanje adds, though Weber was in the correct side by confirming the connection of Reform and Capitalism, the key role played by Norse Mythology was left behind. In effect, the concept of predestination as it has been discussed by Weber did not come from Luther alone. It was rather enrooted in the core of Norse Culture. Secondly, this impossibility to understand the future led to English speaking societies to construct a risk-prone culture, which resulted in what Ulrich Beck dubbed the “Risk Society”. The criticism exerted in the uneven distribution of Capitalism should be explained by the “economy of salved peoples” formulated by Weber.|$|E
5|$|The {{difference}} between teleosts and other bony fish lies mainly in their jaw bones; teleosts have a movable premaxilla and corresponding modifications {{in the jaw}} musculature which {{make it possible for}} them to protrude their jaws outwards from the mouth. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>of</b> great advantage, enabling them to grab prey and draw it into the mouth. In more derived teleosts, the enlarged premaxilla is the main tooth-bearing bone, and the maxilla, which is attached to the lower jaw, acts as a lever, pushing and pulling the premaxilla as the mouth is opened and closed. Other bones further back in the mouth serve to grind and swallow food. Another difference is that the upper and lower lobes of the tail (caudal) fin are about equal in size. The spine ends at the caudal peduncle, distinguishing this group from other fish in which the spine extends into the upper lobe of the tail fin.|$|E
5|$|While {{the speech}} {{revolves}} around the life of Neaira, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>of</b> little importance to {{the substance of the}} accusations. The details seem {{to be part of the}} speech in the hope that the salacious accusations will hide the weakness of Apollodorus' case. The accuracy of the evidence given in the speech has been questioned, and is known to contain both lies and inaccuracies. Despite this, the speech tells us much about the life of an accomplished hetaera, and is extremely valuable to historians as a source on women's lives in classical Greece. Indeed, it is our most reliable extant source on prostitution in the classical world, and one of our best sources on women's lives and gender relations in general for the period.|$|E
