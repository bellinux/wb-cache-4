40|$|In <b>test</b> mode <b>test</b> <b>patterns</b> {{are applied}} in random fashion to the circuit under circuit. This {{increases}} switching transition between the consecutive <b>test</b> <b>patterns</b> and thereby increases dynamic power dissipation. The proposed ring counter based ATPG reduces vertical switching transitions by inserting test vectors only between the less correlative <b>test</b> <b>patterns.</b> This paper presents the RC-ATPG with an external circuit. The external circuit consists of XOR gates, full adders, and multiplexers. First {{the total number}} of transitions between the consecutive <b>test</b> <b>patterns</b> is determined. If it is more, then the external circuit generates and inserts test vectors in between the two <b>test</b> <b>patterns.</b> Test vector insertion increases the correlation between the <b>test</b> <b>patterns</b> and reduces dynamic power dissipation.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a framework of}} test methodology to assess spatial domain compression artefacts produced by image and intra-frame coded video codecs. Few researchers have studied this broad range of artefacts. A taxonomy of image and video compression artefacts is proposed. This {{is based on the}} point of origin of the artefact in the image communication model. This thesis presents objective evaluation of distortions known as artefacts due to image and intra-frame coded video compression made using synthetic <b>test</b> <b>patterns.</b> The American National Standard Institute document ANSI T 1 801 qualitatively defines blockiness, blur and ringing artefacts. These definitions have been augmented with quantitative definitions in conjunction with <b>test</b> <b>patterns</b> proposed. A <b>test</b> and measurement environment is proposed in which the codec under test is exercised using a portfolio of <b>test</b> <b>patterns.</b> The <b>test</b> <b>patterns</b> are designed to highlight the artefact under study. Algorithms have been developed to detect and measure individual artefacts based on the characteristics of respective artefacts. Since the spatial contents of the original <b>test</b> <b>patterns</b> form known structural details, the artefact distortion metrics based on the characteristics of those artefacts are clean and swift to calculate. Distortion metrics are validated using a human vision system inspired modern image quality metric. Blockiness, blur and ringing artefacts are evaluated for representative codecs using proposed synthetic <b>test</b> <b>patterns.</b> Colour bleeding due to image and video compression is discussed with both qualitative and quantitative definitions for the colour bleeding artefacts introduced. The image reproduction performance of a few codecs was evaluated to ascertain the utility of proposed metrics and <b>test</b> <b>patterns...</b>|$|R

The ATPG process for a targeted fault consists of two phases: fault activation and fault propagation.
