60|$|COLLINS. Well, my lord, you {{see people}} do persist in talking as if marriages was all of one sort. But theres almost as many {{different}} sorts of marriages as theres different sorts of people. Theres the young things that marry for love, not knowing what <b>theyre</b> <b>doing,</b> and the old things that marry for money and comfort and companionship. Theres the people that marry for children. Theres the people that dont intend to have children and that arnt fit to have them. Theres the people that marry because theyre so much run after by the other sex {{that they have to}} put a stop to it somehow. Theres the people that want to try a new experience, and the people that want to have done with experiences. How are you to please them all? Why, youll want half a dozen different sorts of contract.|$|E
5000|$|Kain is {{very much}} the focus of the series, though. If you remove the melodrama and just look at the human {{elements}} of his character, you can see that hes flawed. Depending on how you look at things you could call him a tragic hero or an anti-hero. In my opinion, characters painted as true villains just arent interesting. Theyre too two-dimensional; no one is ever really so uncomplicated. Everyone always has their motives for what <b>theyre</b> <b>doing</b> - everybody believes <b>theyre</b> <b>doing</b> the right thing within their belief system. Kain is basically screwed by his own character flaws - which is more interesting than the idealized hero figure. —Amy Hennig, Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine, September 2002 ...|$|E
5000|$|Bloomsbury CEO Nigel Newton said, [...] "have {{unleashed}} a very disingenuous, self-interested attack on us.

They try {{to turn it into a}} big deal as though its a moral crusade for them, but its nothing of the kind." ...|$|E
5000|$|According to {{the vessels}} captain, Phil DAcunto, {{the purpose of}} DHSs Port Security Grant Fund is that by {{supplying}} local municipalities with maritime fire-fighting equipment they freed up United States Coast Guard resources for their primary role, by freeing them of a need to fight local fires. [...] "What <b>theyre</b> trying to <b>do</b> overall is take the responsibility off the Coast Guard. Since 9/11 theyre {{trying to get the}} Coast Guard back to guarding the coast." ...|$|R
5000|$|In early June 2016, after {{performing}} as the shows third voice for three years, Eileen Ross got released. Her release was announced by co-hosts Humble and Fred {{midway through the}} 6 June 2016 show without providing any details other than it {{being part of the}} shows [...] "re-positioning". After some negative listener reaction, they further discussed her departure the next day live on air in an 11-minute segment, stating <b>theyre</b> now <b>doing</b> so despite originally not planning on addressing the reasons theyre no longer working with Ross [...] "out of wanting to be discreet, sensitive, and empathetic". Without going into specifics they further stated that a lot went into the decision including [...] "personal issues and circumstances" [...] and [...] "their desire to take the show into a slightly different direction by concentrating on some Humble & Fred hallmarks that involve just Humble and Fred".|$|R
5000|$|The phrase {{was later}} popularized by {{a song of}} the same name in Stephen Sondheims 1970 musical Company. The {{character}} Joanne, played by Elaine Stritch, a rich, cynical, middle-aged woman, makes a drunken toast to her peer group in The Ladies Who Lunch. The lyrics offer a sardonic toast to rich women, including herself, who fill their time with frivolous things like luncheons and parties. The song has given the phrase [...] "ladies who lunch" [...] a negative connotation. Joannes condemnation of women who are [...] "off to the gym, then to a fitting, claiming <b>theyre</b> fat" [...] <b>does</b> not paint these women in a generous light. Ladies who lunch are often seen as lacking substance.|$|R
5000|$|According to Peter Edge of Homeland Security Investigations in an {{interview}} with ABC News: [...] "What we are seeing is that the gangs are becoming a little bit more organized as gang members enter the United States, whether it’s legally or illegally, and <b>theyre</b> <b>doing</b> a wide variety of recruiting... Our hope is that these criminal gang members will be processed through the judicial system, and that we will be ultimately able to deport those who are not citizens of this country." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{scientific}} community remains skeptical and commentators note that no publications containing results which support intelligent design have yet appeared. Reason magazine compared the research efforts at the Biologic Institute {{to those of}} [...] "Big Tobacco" [...] and the 2006 New Scientist editorial noted {{that this sort of}} research is similar to the agenda-driven research of the tobacco and oil industries. University of Minnesota biology professor PZ Myers likens the Biologic Institutes research program to cargo cults, with [...] "Intelligent Design creationists pretending that <b>theyre</b> <b>doing</b> science."

5000|$|The song shares many {{similarities}} with Ursulas [...] "Poor Unfortunate Souls" [...] in The Little Mermaid, both being sung by villains {{who claim}} to do business by helping make the dreams of others come true when in reality, <b>theyre</b> <b>doing</b> what they do for their own benefit and delight, and both are used as means to deceive the protagonists (both, coincidentally, being royals) into making deals with them, and both songs ending with the protagonist undergoing a mystical transformation that will last for nearly most of the film.|$|E
5000|$|After playing 22 {{games for}} the Brewers in 1977, Thomas was demoted on May 20 to the Spokane Indians, the Brewers Triple-A Pacific Coast League farm team in Spokane, Washington, {{although}} his batting average with Milwaukee was a respectable [...]271. A Milwaukee Journal columnist, Bill Dwyer, wrote, [...] "No matter how tolerant and ecumenical Brewers management wants to be, they are irked by having a player sit out two games a week." [...] While playing for the Indians, Thomas agreed to a pay reduction of one day per week due to his missed Saturday games. His batting average declined considerably, however, and the Brewers announced his reassignment to their Eastern League Class AA affiliate in August. [...] Thomas refused the demotion and did not play {{the remainder of the}} season, saying [...] "Its like <b>theyre</b> asking me, <b>Do</b> you want to stay in the minor leagues the rest of your life? Conform or get out." [...] Brewers president Bud Selig said, [...] "Its just a tragic story. I {{know a lot of people}} are mad at us because of what they think weve done to him ... Hes really a nice kid who wants to do the right thing." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Daily Mirror {{opined that}} [...] "the sexual titillation might be {{diverting}} for an 11-year-old boy as the panties flash and the boobs bounce but, {{in terms of}} content, its hard to believe a scenario in which an 18-year-old Japanese girl like Kasumi, whose favourite food is strawberry yoghurt, would take on a 46-year-old American male professional wrestler and hope to win." [...] Shawn Sines of GameFront used the images of Taki from Soulcalibur II and Kasumi from DOAX2 to illustrate the 2007 critical article about [...] "the video game implementation of modeling female breasts" [...] and used the Dead or Alive series as an example. In 2010, David Houghton of GamesRadar chose , Lara Croft and Soulcaliburs Ivy Valentine as examples of the female video game protagonists who are [...] "all festering adolescent wank-fantasies". That same year, Jeff Marchiafava of Game Informer chose Kasumi as a character that Twilight character Edward Cullen would like because she [...] "is underage". Wirtualna Polska also ranked Kasumi from Dead or Alive 4 as second only to Bayonetta among the [...] "most unrealistic and sexist depictions of women in games". Rich Shivener of Joystick Division included [...] "She Kicks High" [...] at number four on his list {{of the most controversial}} video game commercials, writing: [...] "In a way, Tecmo is making fun of itself for including excessive cleavage and the like in Dead or Alive games. At least <b>theyre</b> honestKasumi totally <b>does</b> kick high, and her fellow femme fatales are flashy, too." [...] In 2012, Kotakus Harris OMalley listed [...] "Kasumi, Ayane or Ivy" [...] as examples of objectified female characters in video games. Stephen Crane of Bitmob included Kasumi among [...] "the most iconic female game characters" [...] while arguing that almost all of which [...] "have been incredibly sexualized". Josh Engen of Cheat Code Central used an image of Kasumi to illustrate the [...] "frustrating (and incorrect) preconception" [...] that gamers are sexist. The naked version of Alpha-152 was also included in GamesRadars 2014 list of top seven [...] "uncomfortably sexy video game AI characters".|$|R
5000|$|The {{film was}} {{initially}} a critical and commercial disappointment, but has since received much stronger modern reviews. Film review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a positive score of 75% {{based on a}} sample of 20 reviews, with an average rating of 6.4 out of 10. Siskel & Ebert were split, Siskel giving the film a [...] "thumbs up" [...] and Ebert giving it a [...] "thumbs down," [...] criticizing Allie Fox for being [...] "boring." [...] However, he did compliment Fords performance. Vincent Canby of The New York Times called it [...] "utterly flat." [...] In her review for The Washington Post, Rita Kempley wrote, [...] "Sooner or later a man of invention will pollute paradise, a grand contradiction that gives Mosquito its bite and Ford inspiration for his most complex portrayal to date. As a persona of epic polarities, he animates this muddled, metaphysical journey into the jungle." [...] In her review for the Los Angeles Times, Sheila Benson wrote, [...] "Hes orchestrated The Mosquito Coasts action to match Foxs progressive mental state, from rage to explosion to squalls and finally to hurricane velocity; however, the film leaves us not with an apotheosis, but exhaustion." [...] In his review for The Globe and Mail, Jay Scott wrote, [...] "The Mosquito Coast {{is a work of}} consummate craftsmanship and its spectacularly acted, down to the smallest roles ... but its field of vision is as narrow and eventually as claustrophobic as Allies." [...] The negative reviews the film received prompted Harrison Ford to defend the film in the media: [...] "there have been mixed reviews and I think the film has been very unfairly treated in some quarters. I have never seen a serious film treated so badly by the critics. And I think <b>theyre</b> wrong. I <b>dont</b> mind saying Im here trying to counter those negative reviews ... Im not defensive about the picture, but I want the public to hear another point of view. Critics see a film and then rush to review it. This is the sort of movie that really doesnt sink home for about three days. It is disturbing and makes you think. It stays with you." ...|$|R
5000|$|Meme is the {{youngest}} child of Osamu and Venus, younger sister to Misa and Samatarou. Meme {{is a candidate for}} goddess status and controls some of her powers, despite her young age; like her sister Misa, she is quite skilled at controlling peoples emotions. Meme usually appears emotionless and acts quite mature for her age, but she is a child. Her lack of experience can cause her to join in with the mad antics of her older relatives, possibly because she has no reason to think what <b>theyre</b> <b>doing</b> is in any way unreasonable.|$|E
5000|$|On January 31, 2007, Hunter {{appeared}} on CNNs Paula Zahn Now {{in a piece}} on atheists in America. During the open forum portion she made several controversial comments suggesting: [...] "If they atheists had Hallmark Cards, maybe they wouldnt feel so left out. We have Christmas cards. We have Kwanzaa cards now. Maybe {{they need to get}} some atheist cards and get that whole ball rolling so more people can get involved with what <b>theyre</b> <b>doing.</b> I think they need to shut up and let people do what they do." ...|$|E
5000|$|Roger Ebert of The Chicago Sun Times {{rated the}} film as the best of 2009, writing, [...] "The Hurt Locker is a great film, an {{intelligent}} film, a film shot clearly so that we know exactly who everybody is {{and where they are}} and what <b>theyre</b> <b>doing</b> and why." [...] He applauded how the suspense was built, calling the film [...] "spellbinding." [...] Ebert considered Renner [...] "a leading contender for Academy Awards," [...] writing, [...] "His performance is not built on complex speeches but on a visceral projection of who this man is and what he feels. He is not a hero in a conventional sense." [...] He eventually ranked it the second-best film of the decade, behind only Synecdoche, New York.|$|E

5000|$|Doug Anderson from The Sydney Morning Herald {{was not a}} fan of the nostalgic feel to the episode, saying [...] "Kimberley Davies {{returns to}} the infamous cul de sac {{in the guise of a}} doco filmmaker to present a series of choice cuts from the past - the {{personification}} of white bread Australia, sliced thick. The nostalgia is even thicker and ickier than the wall-to-wall effusion that propels Nines series of opportunistic programs dredged from the Bert Newton vaults. A must for viewers with cast-iron stomachs". Andersons colleague Judy Adamson had a similar view. Of Annalises documentary, she commented [...] "In the shows eyes she is now a respected filmmaker, but her [...] "documentary" [...] is nothing more than grabs with former locals chatting about what <b>theyre</b> <b>doing</b> now, how Ramsay Street changed their lives and then blowing kisses to those who still live there.

[...] Referencing the surprise third wedding when Honey was heavily pregnant, Dent said, [...] "No one said that springing acute stress on Honey, a heavily pregnant woman, was plainly daft ... each 30-minute episode spent with Honey and Billy now felt like an endurance test." [...] She has also described the coupling of Billy and Honey as akin to Billy and his former wife in the serial Little Mo Mitchell, saying [...] "Its Billy and Little Mo all over again.

Because the service these boys are performing is the most horrible Ive ever heard of, since they are simply performing what was called [...] "knacker service" [...] in the Thirty Years War for the Germans.I have constantly heard rumors about what <b>theyre</b> <b>doing</b> up there, and the other day I received confirmation from a man who came from there on leave because he came into my office and said [...] "Heil og sæl, I am a trained killer." [...] He told me that the Serbs they are guarding up there were sentenced to death in Serbia, but for one reason or another were brought up to Finnmark, and from there they will not escape alive; and it is these young Hird members despairing duty to finish off each of these prisoners. From what my informant said, and from what I have also heard from others, the treatment of these men is inhuman. He claimed that in the time he has been there they have had to kill about seven hundred by shooting or hanging. That the Førers young idealistic political soldiers should have to perform this kind of service is impossible and must be completely rejected.

But Cuse defended [...] "Exposé", saying it was [...] "a {{little bit more of}} an anthology episode for the show", and that he felt that [...] "its unrealistic, in a show that is now 72 episodes in, that every episode is gonna be, you know, chock full of plot momentum. I think its entirely reasonable, and we sort of by necessity have to have episodes that arent super-narratively, you know, propelled." [...] Daniel of TMZ.com said that the episode [...] "was a complete waste of time", and that although he [...] "wanted Nikki and Paulo to die", he did not think their deaths warranted an entire episode. Entertainment Weeklys Jeff Jensen wrote that although he liked the cameo appearance of Billy Dee Williams, he did not think [...] "Exposé" [...] "will do much to change anyones minds" [...] about Nikki and Paulo, who were already unpopular characters. Brooke Tarnoff, a writer for UGO.com, wrote that she was [...] "embarrassed" [...] for Lost. New York Magazine put [...] "Exposé" [...] at the top of its list of [...] "Twenty Most Pointless Lost Episodes". However, TV Guides Matt Roush very much praised the episode for [...] "weaving flashbacks that appeared to be posthumous but really werent while providing clever new angles on classic Lost moments from previous seasons", Roush {{went on to say that}} [...] "Exposé" [...] was [...] "a welcome reminder that sometimes these producers really do seem to know what <b>theyre</b> <b>doing</b> after all." [...] Chris Carabott of IGN also gave a positive review, stating that while Nikki and Paulo had no real impact on the overall storyline, [...] "their ultimate end made for an entertaining hour of television". The IGN staff later ranked [...] "Exposé" [...] 58th out of the 113 Lost episodes, describing it as [...] "one of the series darkest and most fun episodes".|$|E
5000|$|Whilst {{the press}} were putting forward ideas of saving and {{preserving}} the monument where it was, something archaeologists noted as being impossible, English Heritages chief archaeologist, Geoffrey Wainright, eventually gave the go ahead {{for a full}} excavation in March 1999. The procedure would cost £500,000, and the timbers would be conserved at the Fenland Archaeological Trusts field centre at Flag Fen in Cambridgeshire. Excavation began on Wednesday 26 May 1999, by a team from Norfolk Archaeological Unit led by Mark Brennand, and once again they {{found it to be}} a particularly daunting and difficult site: they were only able to excavate for a few hours a day due to the tides, and much of that was taken up with removing the water that had built up overnight, alongside the various fish and other animals that had set up residence there. The excavators also had to contend with protests mounted both by locals and by Neopagan groups, which were led by the Chairman of the Parish Council, Geoff Needham, a former fisherman. English Heritage had taken part in meetings with protest groups, but neither had agreed to change their position on the issue. One of the most vocal protestors, the Neopagan and conservationist Buster Nolan, informed a reporter from the Eastern Daily Press that [...] "Seahenge has more meaning and power on the beach here at Holme than it does anywhere else… This is 60 grand being spent by archaeologists who are patting each other on the back, telling each other <b>theyre</b> <b>doing</b> the right thing. Its a farce." [...] Nolan went on to employ some local solicitors in an attempt to get the courts to intercede on the protestors behalf, receiving donations from the Council of British Druid Orders and from a local businessman, Mervyn Lambert, who told reporters that [...] "The people of Norfolk should have more balls… Im amazed theyre allowing it to happen." [...] Nonetheless, the solicitors refused to take up the case, believing that they could not possibly win against English Heritage.|$|E
