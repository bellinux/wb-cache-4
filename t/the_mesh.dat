5|$|At {{the scale}} of living cells, foam {{patterns}} are common; radiolarians, sponge spicules, silicoflagellate exoskeletons and the calcite skeleton of a sea urchin, Cidaris rugosa, all resemble mineral casts of Plateau foam boundaries. The skeleton of the Radiolarian, Aulonia hexagona, a beautiful marine form drawn by Ernst Haeckel, {{looks as if it}} is a sphere composed wholly of hexagons, but this is mathematically impossible. The Euler characteristic states that for any convex polyhedron, the number of faces plus the number of vertices (corners) equals the number of edges plus two. A result of this formula is that any closed polyhedron of hexagons has to include exactly 12 pentagons, like a soccer ball, Buckminster Fuller geodesic dome, or fullerene molecule. This can be visualised by noting that a mesh of hexagons is flat like a sheet of chicken wire, but each pentagon that is added forces <b>the</b> <b>mesh</b> to bend (there are fewer corners, so <b>the</b> <b>mesh</b> is pulled in).|$|E
5|$|In {{computational}} geometry, the duality between Voronoi diagrams and Delaunay triangulations {{implies that}} any algorithm for constructing a Voronoi diagram can be immediately converted into an algorithm for the Delaunay triangulation, and vice versa. The same duality {{can also be}} used in finite element mesh generation. Lloyd's algorithm, a method based on Voronoi diagrams for moving a set of points on a surface to more evenly spaced positions, is commonly used as a way to smooth a finite element mesh described by the dual Delaunay triangulation. This method improves <b>the</b> <b>mesh</b> by making its triangles more uniformly sized and shaped.|$|E
5|$|The Batsuit {{consisted}} of 110 separate pieces, {{each of which}} had to be replicated dozens of times {{over the course of the}} production.

5|$|In Mexico, {{the diamond}} {{stingray}} {{is one of}} the most important components of Pacific artisanal shark and ray fisheries, comprising around a tenth of the total annual catch. Its significance is likely underestimated, as Mexican fishery reports frequently suffer from misidentifications and a lack of species-specific data. It is mainly caught during summer and fall, being the most common ray landed in Bahía Magdalena, and second most common ray landed off Sonora state. Demersal gillnets are the main fishing gear employed; both adult and juvenile rays easily become entangled in <b>the</b> <b>mesh</b> by their tail spines, with juveniles known to have comprised most of the Bahía Magdalena catch in 19982000. This species is also often caught incidentally in bottom trawls, on longlines, and in fish traps. In the future, habitat degradation from increasing numbers of shrimp farms may pose an additional threat to this species in the region. As a result of these pressures, the IUCN has assessed the diamond stingray as Near Threatened in Mexican waters. No management schemes have yet been enacted for this species.|$|E

Numerical solutions using <b>the</b> <b>meshed</b> system are compared with those from uniform coarse and fine grids. One important criterion is that the solution within <b>the</b> fine <b>mesh</b> region of <b>the</b> <b>meshed</b> grid must have nearly the same accuracy as in a system which uses a fine <b>mesh</b> everywhere. <b>The</b> technique is applied to a two-dimensional (y,p) ten-level primitive equation model.

25|$|Polyethylene glycol (PEG) hydrogels are {{biocompatible}} and {{proven to}} be tolerated in many tissue types, including the CNS. Mahoney and Anseth formed PEG hydrogels by photopolymerizing methacrylate groups covalently linked to degradable PEG macromers. Hydrogel degradation was monitored over time by measuring mechanical strength (compressive modulus) and average mesh size from swelling ratio data. Initially, the polymer chains were highly cross-linked, but as degradation proceeded, ester bonds were hydrolyzed, allowing the gel to swell; the compressive modulus decreased as <b>the</b> <b>mesh</b> size increased until the hydrogel was completely dissolved. It was demonstrated that neural precursor cells were able to be photoencapsulated and cultured on the PEG gels with minimal cell death. Because <b>the</b> <b>mesh</b> size is initially small, the hydrogel blocks inflammatory and other inhibitory signals from surrounding tissue. As <b>the</b> <b>mesh</b> size increases, the hydrogel is able {{to serve as a}} scaffold for axon regeneration.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the stability issue of <b>the</b> <b>meshed</b> DC distributed power systems (DPS) with constant power loads (CPLs) and proposes a stability enhancement method based on virtual harmonic resistance. In previous researches, the network dynamics of <b>the</b> <b>meshed</b> DC DPS are often ignored, which affects the derivation {{of the equivalent}} system impendence. In addition, few of them have considered <b>the</b> <b>meshed</b> DC DPS including multiple sources with voltage-controlled converters and CPLs. To tackle the aforementioned challenge, this paper mainly makes the following efforts. The component connection method (CCM) is employed and expanded to derive the stability criterion of <b>the</b> <b>meshed</b> DC DPS with CPLs. This stability criterion can be simplified to relate only with the network node admittance matrix, the output impendences of the sources, and the input admittances of the CPLs. A virtual harmonic resistance through the second-order generalized integrator (SOGI) is added in the source with the voltage-controlled converter to lower {{the peak of the}} source output impendence, which can enhance the stability of <b>the</b> <b>meshed</b> DC DPS. <b>The</b> effectiveness of the proposed stability criterion and stability enhancement method are verified by nonlinear dynamic simulations...|$|R
40|$|Electrospinning is {{a simple}} and {{efficient}} process for producing sub-micron fibres. However, the process has many variables, and their effects on <b>the</b> non-woven <b>mesh</b> of fibres is complex. In particular, the effects on the mechanical properties of <b>the</b> fibre <b>meshes</b> are poorly understood. This paper conducts a parametric study, where the concentration and bloom strength of the gelatin solutions are varied, while all electrospinning process parameters are held constant. The effects on <b>the</b> fibrous <b>meshes</b> are monitored using scanning electron microscopy and mechanical testing under uniaxial tension. Mesh mechanical properties are relatively consistent, despite changes to the solutions, demonstrating the robustness of electrospinning.
