500|$|The song {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. Sophie Bruce of BBC Music, Michael Wood of Los Angeles Times, {{and a writer}} for Rap-Up named the song one of the album's highlights. Quentin B. Huff of PopMatters was positive, writing that the song and [...] "Slow Dance" [...] "tend to provide better matches between the vocals and the music, since the backdrop keeps things simple and the lyrics don’t always fall into slang and unintentional irony". Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine wrote that the album's problem is the slow numbers, including [...] "Make Love". Cinquemani said that the song requires a [...] "much more talented vocalist to elevate it above mere filler". Steve Jones of USA Today named it a track to skip, and Glenn Gamboa of Newsday also dismissed the song, writing that it [...] "seems <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>forever,</b> especially following the similarly too-long, too-drawn-out 'Slow Dance". Tracy Garraud of Vibe wrote that its chords [...] "sound more like a Disney princess' cue than a royal highness' arrival and Hilson's fairy-dusted vocals sound more platonic than carnal".|$|E

It has a huge cast, the series seems <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>forever</b> and Fred Thompson shows up at the end." [...] Romney was making a {{reference}} to Fred Thompson's role on Law & Order. Thompson replied, [...] "And to think I thought I {{was going to be the}} best actor on the stage." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Old Profanity's unusual {{stage in}} the hold of a once timber-carrying cargo ship was less than thirty feet wide but at least sixty feet deep. [...] The ocean, a series of {{continually}} bobbing plywood waves shaped and painted as a Japanese seascape, though not wide, seemed <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>forever.</b> [...] This allowed for scenes [...] "far out at sea," [...] such as Stinkfoot's triumphant arrival on The Ocean Liner and his rescue of Elma when she is attacked by A Giant Squid. [...] As The Angry Sea, the whole cast, under painted cloth, came rolling out at the audience to great effect. [...] The end-of-pier backstage theatre scenes were played out before the darkened sea. [...] A hole was cut through the ship's structural steel bulkhead to provide a space high above the action for Moll's dreadful deeds and for {{the right and left}} sides of Soliquisto's brain to sing to each other.

500|$|Dylan's contemporaries in 1965 {{were both}} startled and {{challenged}} by the single. Paul McCartney remembered going around to John Lennon's house in Weybridge to hear the song. According to McCartney, [...] "It seemed <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> and <b>on</b> <b>forever.</b> It was just beautiful... He showed {{all of us that}} it was possible <b>to</b> <b>go</b> a little further." [...] Frank Zappa had a more extreme reaction: [...] "When I heard 'Like a Rolling Stone', I wanted to quit the music business, because I felt: 'If this wins and it does what it's supposed to do, I don't need to do anything else...' But it didn't do anything. It sold but nobody responded to it {{in the way that they}} should have." [...] Nearly forty years later, in 2003, Elvis Costello commented on the innovative quality of the single. [...] "What a shocking thing to live in a world where there was Manfred Mann and the Supremes and Engelbert Humperdinck and here comes 'Like a Rolling Stone'".|$|R
40|$|This {{essay is}} about what things we can count, and what we can’t. Practicalities won’t concern us. It may be very difficult, for example, to {{count the number of}} grains of sand on a beach, or the number of {{molecules}} in our body, or even the number of quantum states of our brain; but, in principle, these things can be done. We’re also not even concern with whether the number of things to be counted is finite or not. Even if we have <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> counting <b>forever,</b> if each element of a set can be given a number, then we are happy to call that set countable. You would think that most everything would be countable; but unexpected things are provably not. For example, it’s impossible to count the number of provable theorems in a mathematical theory. That’s a theorem. Another thing that can’t be counted is the number of degrees of freedom in a field — like the fields that constitute all our most basic theories of physics. This fact causes headaches (which we will discuss soon) but, surprisingly, it doesn’t prevent us from very accurately describing Nature. Indeed, it would appear that our basic understanding of physics and mathematics relies exclusively on things that cannot be counted. But are we right to think this, or is there something incomplete about our current understanding of physics? Are field theories really fundamental or do we need a new framework for making sense of our world? Another way to phrase this is ask whether the degrees of freedom that mak...|$|R

40|$|We humans {{now have}} a name for our {{survival}} instinct: sustainable development. This means, quite simply, living on this planet as if we intended <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> living here <b>forever.</b> Porritt 2002, p. 75 Abstract: Sustainable mineral resources development {{can be seen as the}} equitable conversion of transient mineral wealth into durable social and environmental capital. In the past, this con-version has not been efficient or equitable, with benefits accruing mainly to First World inves-tors and consumers by externalization f social and environmental costs to local people and places. Modern industry, led by large multinational corporations, isin the process of changing its modus operandi toembrace ideas of corporate and social responsibility. The damage from past practices to the developing world is severe, however, and may require measures b yond voluntary or current legal instruments to reverse degenerative trends. Central among these requirements is Third World debt cancellation. However, the mining industry can also contrib-ute by fully internalizing the costs of mineral production, and paying a fair price for the resources it extracts; these internalized costs should be reflected in higher commodity prices. This can be achieved through a combination of financial instruments and incentives...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{psychology}} {{of all this}} recent insubordination and violence is--curious. Exasperating too.... I don't quite grasp it.... It's the same thing whether {{you look at the}} suffrage business or the labour people or at this Irish muddle. People may be too safe. You see we live {{at the end of a}} series of secure generations in which none of the great things of life have changed materially. We've grown up with no sense of danger--that is to say, with no sense of responsibility. None of us, none of us--for though I talk my actions belie me--really believe that life can change very fundamentally any more forever. All this",--Mr. Britling waved his arm comprehensively--"looks as though it was bound <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> steadily <b>forever.</b> It seems incredible that the system could be smashed. It seems incredible that anything we can do will ever smash the system. Lady Homartyn, for example, is incapable of believing that she won't always be able to have week-end parties at Claverings, and that the letters and the tea won't come to her bedside in the morning. Or if her imagination <b>goes</b> <b>to</b> the point of supposing that some day she won't be there to receive the tea, it means merely that she supposes somebody else will be. Her pleasant butler may fear to lose his 'situation,' but nothing on earth could make him imagine a time when there will not be a 'situation' for him to lose. Old Asquith thinks that we always have got along, and that we always shall get along by being quietly artful and saying, 'Wait and see.' And it's just because we are all convinced that we are so safe against a general breakdown that we are able to be so recklessly violent in our special cases. Why shouldn't women have the vote? they argue. What does it matter? And bang goes a bomb in Westminster Abbey. Why shouldn't Ulster create an impossible position? And off trots some demented Carsonite to Germany to play at treason on some half word of the German Emperor's and buy half a million rifles....|$|R

60|$|In this {{inconclusive}} {{state of}} things the months dragged on and my captivity continued. I wrote to Philip, imploring his mercy, complaining of these unjust delays {{on the part}} of Vasquez, which threatened <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>forever,</b> and begging His Majesty to command the conclusion of the affair. That was in August of '89. You see how time had sped. All that came of my appeal was at first an increased rigour of imprisonment, and then a visit from Vasquez to examine and question me upon the testimony of Enriquez. As you can imagine, the attempt to lure me into self-betrayal was completely fruitless. My enemy withdrew, baffled, to go question my wife, but without any better success.|$|E

Don't you think that ten years out of my life is enough for a thing that I never intended to go as far as it did, and a thing that I was led into, partly, for the sake of others? I have tried to reason it out, and not from my own point of view at all, and that is the way I feel about it.

60|$|He {{might have}} been more patient if he had known that this State Senator was to be President Garfield. But who could know {{anything}} of the tragical history that was so soon to follow that winter of 1859-60? Not I; at least I listened rapt by the poet and the reader, {{and it seemed to me}} as if the making and the reading of poetry were <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>forever,</b> and that was to be all there was of it. To be sure I had my hard little journalistic misgivings that it was not quite the thing for a State Senator to come round reading Tennyson at ten o'clock in the morning, and I dare say I felt myself superior in my point of view, though I could not resist the charm of the verse. I myself did not bring Tennyson to the office at that time. I brought Thackeray, and I remember that one day when I had read half an hour or so in the 'Book of Snobs,' the leading editor said frankly, Well, now, he guessed we had had enough of that. He apologized afterwards as if he were to blame, and not I, but I dare say I was a nuisance with my different literary passions, and must have made many of my acquaintances very tired of my favorite authors. I had some consciousness of the fact, but I could not help it.|$|E
