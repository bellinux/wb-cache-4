50|$|While {{operating}} at reduced power {{in anticipation of}} typhoon Talim, on , the Unit 2 main transformer differential protective relay tripped because a damaged support insulator caused one phase to flash to ground.

When that steam line started to supply steam to the turbine, the slug of water was pushed downstream, causing a water hammer and subsequent low steam pressure, resulting in another reactor trip.|$|E
50|$|The {{electrical}} fault described above also affected unit 2 by causing breakers in the 230kv switchyard to trip cutting off power to RAT 2-B and vital bus B on unit 2. EDG 2-B subsequently started and restored {{power to the}} vital bus. At the same time, the electrical disturbance from the falling line striking the ground was detected by protective safeties on unit 2's main step-up transformer and a protective relay actuated and opened the transformer's output breaker causing a full load rejection to unit 2 {{which led to a}} <b>turbine</b> <b>trip</b> and reactor scram. After the unit tripped, the B non-vital electrical train lost power as it attempted to transfer from UAT 2-B (which is powered by the turbine generator) to the failed RAT 2-B causing two of the reactor coolant pumps and one of the main feedwater pumps to trip, though the plant cool down proceeded safely. At 9:03 p.m., the RAT 2-B breakers in the switchyard were reset and offsite power was restored to the vital and non-vital B electrical trains allowing reactor coolant pumps 2 and 4 to be restarted. EDG 2-B was shutdown. It was later determined that the fault disturbance caused by the line falling was not of significant magnitude to trip the protective relay per design and should not have caused unit 2 to shut down. Further investigation found that current transformers on the main transformer were improperly set. The controls were adjusted to the proper setting. Had the CTs been properly set initially, the unit would have remained online.|$|E

40|$|Boiling water reactor (BWR) {{plants are}} {{equipped}} with safety/relief valves (SRVs) to protect the reactor from overpressurization. Plant operational transients, such as <b>turbine</b> <b>trips,</b> will actuate the SRV.

30|$|To {{avoid the}} power system {{stability}} issue being influenced by the integrated large-scale RECS, independent system operators (ISOs) require the RECS to operate abiding by strict grid codes. One of important requirements in the grid codes is the low-voltage ride-through (LVRT) capability which demands the RECS to stay on-grid and supply the expected reactive current to support the utility during grid faults. Generally, the LVRT code defines steady and dynamic performances of the RECS in three continuous periods after the grid fault occurred, including fault transient, fault continuous, and fault recovery periods [2]. The LVRT capability and strategies of the RECS {{during the first two}} periods have been thoroughly studied in many previous literature [3, 4]. In the fault recovery period, the RECS is required to recover active power output in a defined rate. This is possible, {{for the simple reason that}} the power response of the inverter-coupled RECS can be fast enough to satisfy the requirements. Unfortunately, voltage swells always occur during the voltage recovery period, which may cause shutdown of the RECS and result in failure of the fault ride through [5, 6]. Thus, the swells bring challenges to the RECS in terms of control capability and schemes. Taking wind power plant as an example, a large number of wind <b>turbines</b> <b>tripped</b> for dozens of times during the fault recovery period due to the voltage swells in Northwest wind farms of China in 2011 [7].|$|R

The analysis of the Simplified Boiling Water Reactor (SBVVR) is carried out through the use of the reactor analysis code RAMONA- 4 B in a scenario of an operational transient, a <b>turbine</b> <b>trip</b> with failure of all the bypass valves. This study is divided in three parts. As an introduction, {{a brief description of the}} code RAMONA- 4 B. Later, the implemented SBWR model, based on the General Electric Standard Safety Analysis Report (SSAR), is described and discussed. Finally, the reactor behavior during a <b>turbine</b> <b>trip</b> transient is numerically simulated through the description of nuclear and thermal hydraulic parameters and under the scenario conditions suggested by General Electric. The SBWR model consists of the representation of the vessel internal components through parameters such as areas, diameters and volumes, and the one-quarter-core neutron parameters which were obtained using the transport theory lattice physics code CASMO- 3. The thermohydraulic equations are solved by RAMONA- 4 B in a closed-contour inside the vessel and in a hundred eighty four parallel channels (including bypass) in the core. The tridimensional representation of the reactor core is accomplished through a proposed fuel load which was obtained from a selection of out of three fuel loads and using some standard fuel design parameters.

First, a steady state solution was obtained and the transient solutions were then obtained for the <b>turbine</b> <b>trip</b> test conducted in December 1995.

The aim {{of it is}} to investigate {{the consequences of the}} installation of a wind power plant on the mountain Uljabuouda in the vicinity of Arjeplog. Especially the impacts on voltage and transient stability are examined. Furthermore, the amount of extra strain on the voltage regulation equipment and the needs for increased regulation capabilities are looked into. The wind power plant is planned to be built by Skellefteå Kraft and connected to a 130 kV grid owned by Vattenfall Eldistribution. The work comprehends the following main parts: - Theoretical studies aimed at wind turbines and power system stability issues. - Modelling of the type of wind turbines assumed to be built on Uljabuouda. - Simulations of different operation cases and analysis of the simulation results. The results from the simulations show that, as far as voltage stability and extra workload on tap-changers are concerned, the wind power plant does not, in any significant manner, worsen the present conditions. The problem of overloading the line between Arvidsjaur and Vargfors is also minor. During the worst year for which measurement results have been obtained 7, 4 MWh would have had to be disconnected, which is practically nothing in comparison with the annual hydro power production in the area, 250 - 300 GWh.

The current work is focusing on the simulation of two specific off-normal situations, such as a Load Rejection and a Loss of Normal Feedwater case occurred in 2005. At first, the stand-alone RELAP 5 and PARCS models are presented. All the 157 fuel assemblies are modelled individually in both codes. The coupling between the two codes is touched upon, with emphasis on the mapping between the hydrodynamic/heat structures and the neutronic nodes. The load rejection transient was initiated by disconnection of the electric grid, which resulted in a reduced power generation. The other analysed transient started with a malfunction of the feedwater valve at the 2 nd steam generator. Consequently, the <b>turbines</b> were <b>tripped</b> and the reactor was scrammed. Activation of the auxiliary feedwater provided proper amount of cooling from the secondary side, resulting in safe shutdown conditions.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{development}} and validation of a coupled RELAP 5 /PARCS model of the Swedish Ringhals- 3 pressurized water reactor against a Loss of Feedwater transient, which occurred on August 16, 2005. At first, the stand-alone RELAP 5 and PARCS models are presented. All the 157 fuel assemblies are modeled in individually in both codes. The model is furthermore able to handle possible asymmetrical conditions of the flow velocity and temperature fields between the loops. On the neutronic side, the dependence of the material constants on history effects, burnup, and instantaneous conditions is accounted for, and the full heterogeneity of the core is thus taken into account. The reflectors are also explicitly represented. The coupling between the two codes is touched upon, with emphasis on the mapping between the hydrodynamic/heat structures and the neutronic nodes. The transient was initiated by a malfunction of the feedwater valve at the 2 nd steam generator. Consequently, the <b>turbines</b> were <b>tripped</b> and, because of the low level in the SG- 2 the reactor was scrammed. Activation of the auxiliary feedwater provided proper amount of cooling from the secondary side, resulting in safe shutdown conditions. Capabilities of the RELAP 5 code were more challenged in this transient, where the influences of the feedback from the neutron kinetic side were also {{taken into account in}} the analysis. The calculated values of the parameters show good agreement with the measured data...|$|R
