5|$|Baleen whales have a small, yet functional, vomeronasal organ. This allows baleen whales {{to detect}} {{chemicals}} and pheromones released by their prey. It {{is thought that}} 'tasting' the water is important for finding prey and tracking down other whales. They {{are believed to have}} an impaired sense of smell {{due to the lack of}} the olfactory bulb, but <b>they</b> <b>do</b> have an olfactory tract. Baleen whales have few if any taste buds, suggesting they have lost their sense of taste. <b>They</b> <b>do</b> retain salt-receptor taste-buds suggesting that they can taste saltiness.|$|E

5|$|Habitat destruction, such as forest {{clearing}} {{for commercial}} logging, agriculture space, and residential areas, {{is the most}} detrimental activity {{on the distribution of}} these rabbits. Since they prefer a habitat of both mature and young forests, <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not thrive in only mature forests untouched by destruction, yet <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not thrive in newly growing forests alone, either. There are plans to remove current habitat for these rabbits for the construction of golf courses and resorts, which is allowed because it will not directly be killing the rabbit, just changing the environment where it dwells, which is legal even under the protection of the special natural monument status.|$|E

5|$|Marine mammals are aquatic mammals {{that rely}} on the ocean and other marine {{ecosystems}} for their existence. They include animals such as seals, whales, manatees, sea otters and polar bears. <b>They</b> <b>do</b> not represent a distinct taxon or systematic grouping, but rather have a polyphyletic relation due to convergent evolution, as in <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not have an immediate common ancestor.

5|$|Still other chemists further {{exclude the}} group 3 {{elements}} from {{the definition of}} a transition metal. <b>They</b> <b>do</b> so on the basis that the group 3 elements do not form any ions having a partially occupied d shell and do not therefore exhibit any properties characteristic of transition metal chemistry. In this case, only groups 4–11 are regarded as transition metals. However, though the group 3 elements show few of the characteristic chemical properties of the transition metals, <b>they</b> <b>do</b> show some of their characteristic physical properties (on account of the presence in each atom of a single d electron).|$|E
