Extinguishing concentrations are found to depend on the agent, type of burner, and on the fuel used.

40|$|Detailed {{chemical}} kinetic {{modeling of}} methane planar opposed-jet laminar diffusion flames burning in air {{mixed with a}} variety of <b>thermal</b> <b>agents</b> is used to characterize their effects on maximum flame temperature and extinction behavior. The identification of a well-defined limit temperature allows extinguishing concentrations for buoyancy-dominated methane flames to be predicted. Predicted extinguishing volume fractions are shown to be in good agreement with experimental results for opposed flow methane flames. It is further demonstrated that the calculations provide reliable estimates of relative <b>thermal</b> <b>agent</b> extinguishing effectiveness for both methane coflow flames and liquid-fueled heptane flames burning in a surrounding coflow, even though the required volume fractions of a given agent can differ substantially from those predicted for the opposed flow methane flames. This is the case {{despite the fact that the}} extinction mechanisms for the opposed-flow (global flame extinction due to flame cooling) and coflow (blow off of an edge flame stabilized in the local flow field by a reaction kernel) flames are believed to be different.

Fourteen subjects were randomly assigned to receive either heat or cold treatment and to administer that particular modality to either the right or left hand.

Measurements of the subjects 2 ̆ 7 grip strength, timing of coin count and pegboard functional tests, and ratings of pain and joint stiffness were measured before and after the treatment period. There was a significant difference (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) between the pre and posttest joint stiffness scores indicating that subjects perceived a decrease in joint stiffness when using heat and an increase in joint stiffness when using cold. however, there was not a significant difference (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) between the pre and posttest scores on grip strength, coin count, pegboard, and joint pain for the heat and cold groups.

40|$|Thermal {{transport}} in aqueous suspensions of Au-core polymer-shell nanoparticles is {{investigated by}} time-resolved measurements of optical absorption. The addition of an organic cosolvent to the suspension causes the polystyrene {{component of the}} polymer shell to swell, and this change in the microstructure of the shell increases the effective thermal conductivity of the shell {{by a factor of}} approximately 2. The corresponding time scale for the cooling of the nanoparticle decreases from 200 ps to approximately 100 ps. The threshold concentration of cosolvent that creates the changes in thermal conductivity, 5 vol % tetrahydrofuran in water or 40 vol % N,N-dimethylformamide in water, is identical to the threshold concentrations for producing small shifts in the frequency of the plasmon resonance. Because the maximum fraction of solvent in the polymer shell is less than 20 vol %, the increase in the effective thermal conductivity of the shell cannot be easily explained by contributions to heat transport by the solvent or enhanced alignment of the polystyrene backbone along the radial direction.
