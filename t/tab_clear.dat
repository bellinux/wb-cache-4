5000|$|<b>Tab</b> <b>Clear</b> was a {{variation}} of Tab. It is Coca-Cola's contribution to the short-lived [...] "clear cola" [...] movement during the early 1990s. It {{was introduced in the}} United States on December 14, 1992, in the United Kingdom a month later and in Japan in March 1993 to initially positive results. <b>Tab</b> <b>Clear</b> was, however, discontinued after only a short time of marketing in 1994. Unlike most other [...] "clear" [...] soft drinks, <b>Tab</b> <b>Clear</b> contained caffeine and, according to the company, had the flavor of cola.|$|E
50|$|After {{positive}} consumer {{response in}} its initial 10 markets, {{it was announced}} on February 17, 1993 that <b>Tab</b> <b>Clear</b> would be introduced into an additional 20 American markets the coming March, increasing the drink's availability to 35 percent of the American population. In an article from the Los Angeles Times, {{it was reported that}} Coca-Cola expected to have <b>Tab</b> <b>Clear</b> available nationwide {{by the end of the}} year.|$|E
5000|$|In July 2004, in an {{unrelated}} article, BBC Business News made a mention of how [...] "colourless versions" [...] of Coke [...] "have not been hugely successful". Some have even referred to <b>Tab</b> <b>Clear's</b> marketing as a [...] "born to die" [...] campaign.|$|R
5000|$|During the Kitchener-Waterloo launch day on August 16, 2011, Wind {{introduced}} another subsidy option {{called the}} Windtab+. This increased the subsidy provided on more costly devices {{when combined with}} certain plans. At the same time Wind introduced the [...] "Pay-off Promise": accounts in good standing with devices purchased under the Windtab+ agreement would have any remaining balance on their <b>tab</b> <b>cleared</b> {{after two years of}} service (originally three years prior to aligning to the CRTC Wireless Code in 2013).|$|R
50|$|Challenger Challenge: Swerve and Avoid - The {{challenge}} is themed around avoid avoiding moose on the road. This {{is a particular}} issue for Shirley, who has killed family pets due to not swerving to avoid them. In this year's version, contestants must clear the course at 70 km/h in the Challenger. Tab accelerates to 80 km/h, and in trying to slow down {{she does not have}} enough time to get back down - and hits the barriers, destroying the front bumper. In her second attempt, she swerves too wide... and destroys the back bumper. <b>Tab</b> does, however, <b>clear</b> the course in her third attempt. Aaron passes the challenge on his first try. Shirley swerves too early in her first two runs, and hits the last lane marker. She clears the course in the third attempt. Afiya fails the course, as she goes over-speed and hits the moose in her first run. She swerves too early in the second attempt, and too late in the third. Sly accelerates to 100 km/h, and goes straight ahead and brakes, destroying the centre of the course. The {{challenge is}} aborted then - as Andrew remarks that he could not have done the challenge any worse.|$|R

5000|$|In his 2011 book, Killing Giants: 10 Strategies to Topple the Goliath in Your Industry, Stephen Denny {{published}} {{an interview with}} former Coca-Cola Chief Marketing Officer Sergio Zyman that stated the formation and subsequent failure of <b>Tab</b> <b>Clear</b> was a deliberate move to destroy Crystal Pepsi, capitalizing on the public's {{lack of understanding of}} Pepsi's heavily-marketed product. <b>Tab</b> <b>Clear</b> was marketed as a diet drink, which were less popular than traditional colas, and the Tab brand in general was seen as an inferior product to flagships like Coca-Cola or Pepsi. With <b>Tab</b> <b>Clear</b> being placed in such close proximity to Crystal Pepsi, the image of both brands would be damaged in what Zyman called a [...] "kamikaze" [...] strategy. [...] "This is like a cola," [...] Zyman explained, [...] "but it doesn't have any color. It has all this great taste. And we said, 'No, Crystal Pepsi is actually a diet drink.' Even though it wasn't. Because Tab had the attributes of diet, which was its demise. That was its problem. It was perceived to be a medicinal drink. Within three or five months, <b>Tab</b> <b>Clear</b> was dead. And so was Crystal Pepsi." ...|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 163 - 165) This {{thesis is}} the specification {{and design of}} a portable, full-screen text editor (PED). PED has sufficient text capibilities for the most experienced typist and the most particular programmer. The editor also has the flexibility to be installed for use on any terminal with control and escape keys. The editor capibilities include such features as moving text, copying text, deleting text and changing text [...] all {{with the use of}} cursor control and full-screen display. PED allows scanning a file by moving the window up, down, left, or right, and editing a file by typing changes directly onto the text as it appears in the window. The cursor is positioned by the use of the four ???cursor motion??? keys marked with arrows and by the return and tab keys. In addition, PED provides capabilities used by the experienced typist. Such capabilities include setting of left and right margins and setting and <b>clearing</b> <b>tab</b> stops. Consistent with an electronic typewriter interface, PED will have a displayable columnar ???editor ruler??? as a visual reference for performing these functions. PED is designed for portability. This portability is achieved by designing each task of the editor as a seperate module. It is also important that PED's least portable tasks be isolated as seperate modules. Once these dependent tasks have been isolated, their implementation becomes easier. This makes PED more portable, for use on other computers...|$|R
50|$|Tab (stylized as TaB) is a diet cola {{soft drink}} {{produced}} by The Coca-Cola Company, introduced in 1963. The soda was popular throughout the 1960s and 1970s, and several variations were made, including <b>Tab</b> <b>Clear</b> {{as well as}} caffeine-free versions.|$|E
5000|$|In late December 1992, Coca-Cola Co. {{president}} Doug Ivester told {{a gathering}} of New York reporters that <b>Tab</b> <b>Clear</b> was being positioned {{as part of the}} [...] "mainstream of diet soft drinks" [...] and was [...] "not a new-age beverage". He declared: ...|$|E
5000|$|... means [...] "winter" [...] in Slavic languages. David Placek, at Lexicon Branding, {{working with}} the company's Russian {{linguist}} {{came up with the}} name. It was launched nationally in the United States as Zima Clearmalt in 1993 after being test-marketed two years earlier in the cities of Nashville, Sacramento, and Syracuse. The lemon-lime drink was part of the [...] "clear craze" [...] of the 1990s that produced products such as Crystal Pepsi and <b>Tab</b> <b>Clear.</b> The slogans used in early advertisements for Zima were [...] "a truly unique alcohol beverage" [...] and [...] "Zomething different".|$|E
5000|$|According to Coca-Cola Chief Marketing Officer Sergio Zyman, <b>Tab</b> <b>Clear</b> was an {{intentionally}} [...] "suicidal," [...] "kamikaze" [...] {{effort to}} create an unpopular beverage that was positioned as an analogue of Crystal Pepsi in order to [...] "kill both in the process." [...] The [...] "born to die" [...] strategy included using the poor-performing Tab brand rather than Coke, labeling the product as a [...] "sugar free" [...] diet drink to confuse consumers into thinking Crystal Pepsi had no sugar, and marketing the product {{as if it were}} [...] "medicinal." [...] Zyman said [...] "Pepsi spent an enormous amount of money on the brand and, regardless, we killed it. Both of them were dead within six months." ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Tab</b> <b>Clear</b> went {{international}} {{only two}} weeks after its introduction in the United States. The clear cola with [...] "a mouthful of flavor" [...] was introduced {{at a news conference}} in London on January 18, 1993. The product was made available to the British public from early February that year with a trial price of 23 pence, initially in 330 ml cans and later in 1.5 and 2 litre plastic bottles. The drink was referred to as [...] "a completely new idea in soft drinks and is unlike any other product available". This made Coca-Cola the first of the two rival US soft drink global corporations (Coke and Pepsi) to launch a clear cola into Europe.|$|E
5000|$|Initially tab stops {{were set}} by adding and {{removing}} clips from the tab rack, but Edward Hess {{working for the}} Royal Typewriter Company filed for a patent in 1904 covering a system where the tab stops were permanently mounted on the tab bar. To set or reset a tab for a particular column, the tab stop for that column was simply rotated {{in or out of}} engagement. [...] In 1940, James Koca filed for a patent on a mechanism allowing the tab stops for each column to be set and cleared from the keyboard, eliminating the need for the typist to bend {{over the back of the}} machine to directly manipulate the tab rack. [...] These keys, if present, are typically labeled tab set and <b>tab</b> <b>clear.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In 1992, PepsiCo {{introduced}} Crystal Pepsi to test {{markets in}} Denver, Sacramento, Dallas, Providence, and Grand Rapids, {{and the product}} generated a positive response. Pleased with the results, PepsiCo launched the cola on April 12, 1992, and began to sell it nationwide in 1993. A large marketing campaign was launched, for which the company invented the world's first photo-realistic, computer-generated bus wrap printing. A series of television advertisements featuring Van Halen's hit song [...] "Right Now" [...] premiered on national television on January 31, 1993, during Super Bowl XXVII. Another marketing ploy was to give out full sized sample bottles with the Sunday paper deliveries such as the Boston Globe in Massachusetts. In its first year, Crystal Pepsi captured a full percentage point of U.S. soft drink sales, approximately $474 million. Coca-Cola followed suit by launching <b>Tab</b> <b>Clear</b> on December 14, 1992.|$|E
