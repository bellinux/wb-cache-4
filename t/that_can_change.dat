25|$|It {{is common}} in polytheistic mythologies to find {{characters}} <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>change</b> gender, or have aspects of {{both male and female}} genders at the same time. Sexual activity with both genders is also common within such pantheons, and is compared to modern bisexuality or pansexuality. The creation myths of many traditions involve sexual, bisexual or androgynous motifs, with the world being created by genderless or hermaphrodite beings or through sexual congress between beings of the opposite or same apparent gender.|$|E
25|$|The Martian {{atmosphere}} is very thin and composed mainly of carbon dioxide, with some nitrogen and argon. The average surface pressure on Mars is 0.6-0.9 kPa, compared to about 101 kPa for Earth. This {{results in a}} much lower atmospheric thermal inertia, {{and as a consequence}} Mars is subject to strong thermal tides <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>change</b> total atmospheric pressure by up to 10%. The thin atmosphere also increases the variability of the planet's temperature. Martian surface temperatures vary from lows of approximately −140°C (−220°F) during the polar winters to highs of up to 20°C (70°F) in summers.|$|E
25|$|While Princess Cadence was {{preparing}} {{to be married to}} Shining Armor(the captain of the Royal Guard of Canterlot, and the brother of Twilight Sparkle) in Canterlot, changelings (creatures <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>change</b> their physical form, and feed off the love of others) covertly snuck into the town. The changeling queen, Queen Chrysalises, imprisoned and impersonated Cadence, so she could feed off Shining Armor's love for her. Twilight Sparkle discovered this just before the imposter of Cadence and Shining Armor could be wed. She then freed Cadence, allowing Cadence and Shining Armor to defeat the Changelings with the power of their love, {{with the help of the}} bearers of the Elements of Harmony (the Mane 6 ponies).|$|E

25|$|NF-κB {{activates}} {{the expression}} of numerous genes {{that are involved in}} the transition between inflammation and regeneration, which encode cytokines, adhesion factors, and other molecules <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>change</b> cell fate. This reprogramming of cellular phenotypes normally allows the development of a fully functional intact tissue. NF-κB activity is tightly controlled by multiple proteins, which collectively ensure that only discrete clusters of genes are induced by NF-κB in a given cell and at a given time. This tight regulation of signal exchange between cells, protects the tissue from excessive inflammation, and ensures that different cell types would gradually acquire complementary functions, and specific positions. Failure of this mutual regulation between genetic reprogramming and cell interactions allows cancer cells to give rise to metastasis. Cancer cells respond aberrantly to cytokines, and activate signal cascades that can protect them from the immune system.|$|E
25|$|The lens is a {{transparent}} convex or 'lens' shaped {{body with a}} harder outer layer and a softer inner layer. It focuses {{the light on the}} retina. The shape of the lens can be altered by ciliary muscles which are directly attached to lens capsule by means of the zonular fibres. In addition to these muscles, some birds also have a second set, Crampton’s muscles, <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>change</b> the shape of the cornea, thus giving birds a greater range of accommodation than is possible for mammals. This accommodation can be rapid in some diving water birds such as in the mergansers. The iris is a coloured muscularly operated diaphragm in front of the lens which controls the amount of light entering the eye. At the centre of the iris is the pupil, the variable circular area through which the light passes into the eye.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two factors}} <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>change</b> the {{temperature}} of a fluid during an adiabatic expansion: a change in internal energy or the conversion between potential and kinetic internal energy. Temperature is the measure of thermal kinetic energy (energy associated with molecular motion); so a change in temperature indicates a change in thermal kinetic energy. The internal energy {{is the sum of}} thermal kinetic energy and thermal potential energy. Thus, even if the internal energy does not change, the temperature can change due to conversion between kinetic and potential energy; this is what happens in a free expansion and typically produces a decrease in temperature as the fluid expands. If work is done on or by the fluid as it expands, then the total internal energy changes. This is what happens in a Joule–Thomson expansion and can produce larger heating or cooling than observed in a free expansion.|$|E

25|$|Holoxica has successfuly {{demonstrated}} {{several generations}} of holographic video displays. The technical approach advocates a simplified approach by starting with basic building blocks and scaling towards higher resolution and performance. The first-generation holographic display demonstrator, built in 2010, had up to nine voxels and could show simple numeric information, icons, symbology etc. This technology {{can be used to}} build segmented 3D displays, similar to the early segmented LCDs found in calculators and clocks. The second-generation display was announced in 2013. This is a planar Head-Up Display (HUD) with hundreds of thousands voxels and freeform images floating in mid-air <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>change</b> in real time. Interactivity is added with a Kinect motion sensor that allows you to 'touch' icons in free space and 'draw' in mid-air. The third generation display builds upon the previous generations to create a volumetric display. The images are bright and visible under indoor lighting conditions, and the approach is scalable, leveraging existing manufacturing techniques and components.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. Census Bureau view on {{the future}} of {{longevity}} is that life expectancy in the United States will be in the mid-80s by 2050 (up from 77.85 in 2006) and will top out eventually in the low 90s, barring major scientific advances <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>change</b> the rate of human aging itself, as opposed to merely treating the effects of aging as is done today. The Census Bureau also predicted that the United States would have 5.3 million people aged over 100 in 2100. The United Nations has also made projections far out into the future, up to 2300, at which point it projects that life expectancies in most developed countries will be between 100 and 106 years and still rising, though more and more slowly than before. These projections also suggest that life expectancies in poor countries will still be less than those in rich countries in 2300, in some cases by as much as 20 years. The UN itself mentioned that gaps in life expectancy so far in the future may well not exist, especially since the exchange of technology between rich and poor countries and the industrialization and development of poor countries may cause their life expectancies to converge fully with those of rich countries long before that point, similarly to the way life expectancies between rich and poor countries have already been converging over the last 60 years as better medicine, technology, and living conditions became accessible to many people in poor countries. The UN has warned that these projections are uncertain, and cautions that any change or advancement in medical technology could invalidate such projections.|$|E
