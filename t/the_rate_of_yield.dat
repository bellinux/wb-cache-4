40|$|The nitrogen-driven {{trade-off}} between nitrogen utilisation efficiency (yield {{per unit}} nitrogen uptake) and water use efficiency (yield per unit evapotranspiration) is widespread and results from well established, multiple effects of nitrogen availability on the water, carbon and nitrogen economy of crops. Here {{we used a}} crop model (APSIM) to simulate the yield, evapotranspiration, soil evaporation and nitrogen uptake of wheat, and analysed yield responses to water, nitrogen and climate using a framework analogous to the rate-duration model of determinate growth. The relationship between modelled grain yield (Y) and evapotranspiration (ET) was fitted to a linear-plateau function to derive three parameters: maximum yield (Ymax), the ET break-point when yield reaches its maximum (ET#), and <b>the</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>yield</b> response in the linear phase ([Delta]Y/[Delta]ET). Against this framework, we tested the hypothesis that nitrogen deficit reduces maximum yield by reducing both the rate ([Delta]Y/[Delta]ET) {{and the range of}} yield response to evapotranspiration, i. e. ET# - Es, where Es is modelled median soil evaporation. Modelled data reproduced the nitrogen-driven trade-off between nitrogen utilisation efficiency and water use efficiency in a transect from Horsham (36 °S) to Emerald (23 °S) in eastern Australia. Increasing nitrogen supply from 50 to 250 kg N ha- 1 reduced yield per unit nitrogen uptake from 29 to 12 kg grain kg- 1 N and increased yield per unit evapotranspiration from 6 to 15 kg grain ha- 1 mm- 1 at Emerald. The same increment in nitrogen supply reduced yield per unit nitrogen uptake from 30 to 25 kg grain kg- 1 N and increased yield per unit evapotranspiration from 6 to 25 kg grain ha- 1 mm- 1 at Horsham. Maximum yield ranged from 0. 9 to 6. 4 t ha- 1. Consistent with our working hypothesis, reductions in maximum yield with nitrogen deficit were associated with both reduction in <b>the</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>yield</b> response to ET and compression of the range of yield response to ET. Against the notion of managing crops to maximise water use efficiency in low rainfall environments, we emphasise the trade-off between water use efficiency and nitrogen utilisation efficiency, particularly under conditions of high nitrogen-to-grain price ratio. The rate-range framework to characterise the relationship between yield and evapotranspiration is useful to capture this trade-off as the parameters were responsive to both nitrogen supply and climatic factors...|$|E

In a series of field experiments in Queensland, Australia, {{we found that the}} yield of CIMMYT wheat line SeriM 82 ranged from 6 % to 28 % greater than the current cultivar Hartog. Physiological studies on the adaptive traits revealed that SeriM 82 had a narrower root architecture and extracted more soil moisture, particularly deep in the profile. Results of a simulation analysis of these adaptive root traits with the cropping system model APSIM for a range of rain-fed environments in southern Queensland indicated a mean relative yield benefit of 14. 5 % in water-deficit seasons. Furthermore, each additional millimetre of water extracted during grain filling generated an extra 55 kg ha- 1 of grain yield.

40|$|ABSTRACT This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the effects of soybean hulls (SBH) as a ground corn replacement (0, 50, and 100 % SBH) on {{the parameters of the}} lactation curve and on lactation curves and milk composition. Fourteen multiparous Saanen goats were used during their lactation period, from kidding until the drying of their milk on the 228 th day of lactation, and were distributed in a completely randomised design. The data was analysed using Bayesian methodology to minimise the effect of the low number of animals and to allow for comparison of the curve parameters estimated by Wood's nonlinear model. The SBH had no effect on the initial milk yield; nevertheless, the SBH reduced <b>the</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>yield</b> until lactation peak and accelerated the declining rate of yield after lactation. The treatments did not affect dry matter intake. The inclusion of SBH increased the fat content in the milk, which was also influenced by the lactation stage of the goats. Effects were observed on polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), PUFA/total AG ratio, and the n- 6 :n- 3 ratio of goat milk fat. The lactation stage changed the content of saturated fatty acid, monounsaturated fatty acid, and C 18 : 2 (conjugated linoleic acid). The SBH can therefore be used as a ground corn replacement in the diets of lactating goats, as changes in the lactation curve parameters did not result in changes in total yields. Nevertheless, if the milk fat increases, then as quality rises, so could payment by quality, and thus an increase in profit margins per liter of milk sold...|$|E

As a case study of factors affecting yield in drought-prone areas, we have studied durum wheat yields and their relation to rainfall in Tunisia, where from north to south there is a gradient in severity and frequency of drought. The mid 1960 s delimited two periods: from the early 1900 s to the 60 s the rate of increase was rather low; after the 60 s yields increased at a higher rate. However, yields were quite variable and extremely low in dry years. Recently <b>the</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>yield</b> increase has been slowing clown. In northern Tunisia, yield was highly correlated with autumn rainfall, indicating the importance of the early growth stages, whereas variation in the extent of terminal drought was poorly correlated with yield. In the centre and south, where drought occurs frequently, the area sown was highly variable, because farmers often cancel sowing if the first significant autumn rainfalls do not occur. Wheat production was also diminished through a reduction of harvested areas with respect to sown areas, a consequence of severe drought and crop failure. Water use efficiency (yield/growing season rainfall) was stable for durum wheat in northern Tunisia until the late 60 s and since then has significantly increased. Given the identified sensitivities to drought, the main factors limiting wheat yield are discussed and analysed in order to give way to more genetic and crop management progress...|$|E

However, these properties are irreversibly altered when the sludge is exposed to heat (e. g. either passing through heat exchangers of anaerobic digesters or during thermal pre-treatment process before digesters). Literature showed that thermal pre-treatment of waste activated sludge (WAS) solubilises particulate organic matter in sludge and increases the biodegradability of WAS in anaerobic digesters. This paper reports the similarity between the kinetic of rheological enhancements due to thermal treatment and the rate of organic matter solubilisation in the WAS when it is subjected to cyclic thermal treatment between 20 and 80 °C up to 1 h.

Foresight studies on food security are frequently based on crop yield trends estimated from yield time series provided by national and regional statistical agencies.

50|$|The use of salts of {{cationic}} nitrogen increases <b>the</b> <b>rates</b> and <b>yields</b> <b>of</b> electrophilic fluorination, {{because the}} cationic nitrogen removes electron density from fluorine. N-fluoropyridinium ions and iminium ions {{can also be}} used as electrophilic fluorinating reagents. The counteranions of these salts, although they are not directly involved in the transfer of fluorine to the substrate, influence reactivity in subtle ways and may be adjusted using a variety of methods.|$|R
40|$|Yield-loss {{models were}} {{developed}} for tobacco infected with Meloidogyne incognita grown in microplots under various irrigation regimes. <b>The</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> relative <b>yield</b> loss per initial nematode density (Pi), where relative yield is {{a proportion of}} the value of the harvested leaves in uninfected plants with the same irrigation treatment, was greater under conditions of water stress or with high irrigation than at an intermediate level of soil moisture. <b>The</b> maximum <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> plant growth per degree-day (base 10 C) was reduced as nematode Pi increased when plots contained adequate water. When plants were under water stress, increasing Pi did not luther reduce <b>the</b> maximum <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> plant growth (water stress was the limiting factor). Cumulative soil matric potential values were calculated to describe the relationship between available water in the soil (matric potential) due to the irrigation treatments and subsequent plant growth...|$|R
40|$|GRiSP embarks on {{the most}} {{comprehensive}} attempt ever to deploy rice genetic diversity, while promoting simultaneous revolutions in rice agronomy, processing and policy. In response to rapid population growth that requires production to double {{to keep up with}} demand, GRiSP is designed to boost <b>the</b> current <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>yield</b> growth and improve the management of water and other resources on which production depends. To ensure maximum impact from this program, with a 5 -year budget of nearly US$ 600 million, it will be carried out jointly by three CGIAR Centers: IRRI, the Lead Center which is headquartered in the Philippines, the Africa Rice Center in Benin and CIAT in Colombia: and major advanced agricultural research organizations in France and Japan in collaboration with hundreds of partners. It was approved by the Fund Council in November 2010...|$|R
