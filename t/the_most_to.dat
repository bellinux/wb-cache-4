5|$|After the election, {{rather than}} take a job with Roosevelt's {{administration}} in Albany, Howe remained in New York City to prepare for Roosevelt's 1932 presidential run. During this period, he worked closely with James Farley, chairman of the New York State Democratic Committee and another devoted Roosevelt supporter. Roosevelt would later publicly credit the pair with being {{the two men who}} had done <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>to</b> secure his election.|$|E

In February 2010, Dawkins was named to the Freedom From Religion Foundation's Honorary Board of distinguished achievers.|$|E
5|$|Most of the iodides of the pre-transition metals (groups 1, 2, and 3, {{along with}} the {{lanthanides}} and actinides in the +2 and +3 oxidation states) are mostly ionic, while nonmetals tend to form covalent molecular iodides, as do metals in high oxidation states from +3 and above. Ionic iodides MIn tend to have the lowest melting and boiling points among the halides MXn of the same element, because the electrostatic forces of attraction between the cations and anions are weakest for the large iodide anion. In contrast, covalent iodides tend to instead have the highest melting and boiling points among the halides of the same element, since iodine is the most polarisable of the halogens and, having the most electrons among them, can contribute <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>to</b> van der Waals forces. Naturally, exceptions abound in intermediate iodides where one trend {{gives way to the}} other. Similarly, solubilities in water of predominantly ionic iodides (e.g. potassium and calcium) are the greatest among ionic halides of that element, while those of covalent iodides (e.g. silver) are the lowest of that element. In particular, silver iodide is very insoluble in water and its formation is often used as a qualitative test for iodine.|$|E

5|$|O'Reilly was honoured {{with several}} accolades {{late in his}} life. In 1980, he was awarded an Order of the British Empire for his {{services}} to cricket {{as a player and}} writer. In 1985, the oval in Wingello was renamed in his honour, and in 1988, a grandstand at the SCG was named the Bill O'Reilly Stand. In the same year, the oval in White Cliffs was renamed, and The Sydney Morning Herald renamed the medal they awarded to the best player in grade cricket in O'Reilly's honour. During the celebrations for the Australian Bicentenary, O'Reilly was named among the 200 people, and only 21 living, who had contributed <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>to</b> the country since European settlement.|$|E
5|$|The Nashville {{sound was}} a popular kind of country music that arose in the 1950s, a fusion of popular big band jazz and swing with the lyricism of honky-tonk country. The popular success of Hank Williams' {{recordings}} had convinced record labels that country music could find mainstream audiences. Record companies then tried to strip the rough, honky-tonk elements from country music, removing the unapologetically rural sound that had made Williams famous. Nashville's industry was reacting {{to the rise of}} rockabilly performer Elvis Presley by marketing performers that crossed the divide between country and pop. Chet Atkins, head of RCA's country music division, did <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>to</b> innovate the Nashville sound by abandoning the rougher elements of country, while Owen Bradley used sophisticated production techniques and smooth instrumentation that eventually became standard in the Nashville Sound, which also grew to incorporate strings and vocal choirs. By {{the early part of the}} 1960s, the Nashville sound was perceived as watered-down by many more traditionalist performers and fans, resulting in a number of local scenes like the Lubbock sound and, most influentially, the Bakersfield sound.|$|E

The 107,846 fans in attendance were <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>to</b> ever see an Alabama squad compete on the gridiron, and the victory improved their all-time record against the Nittany Lions to 10â€“5. The outcome was also noted as the final career loss for Joe Paterno as the Nittany Lions' head coach.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} many {{hypotheses}} that have attempted to explain why lemurs exhibit female social dominance while other primates with similar social structures do not, but no consensus has been reached after decades of research. The dominant view in the literature states that female dominance is an advantageous trait given {{the high costs of}} reproduction and the scarcity of resources available. Indeed, female dominance {{has been shown to be}} linked to increased maternal investment. However, when reproductive costs and extreme seasonality of resources were compared across primates, other primates demonstrated male dominance under conditions that were similar to or more challenging than those faced by lemurs. In 2008, a new hypothesis revised this model using simple game theory. It was argued that when two individuals were equally matched in fighting capacity, the one with the most need would win the conflict since it would have <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>to</b> lose. Consequently, the female, with higher resource needs for pregnancy, lactation, and maternal care, was more likely to win in resource conflicts with equally sized males. This, however, assumed monomorphism between sexes. The following year, a new hypothesis was proposed to explain monomorphism, stating that because most female lemurs are only sexually receptive for a day or two each year, males can utilize a more passive form of mate guarding: copulatory plugs, which block the female reproductive tract, preventing other males from successfully mating with her, and thus reducing the need for aggression and the evolutionary drive for sexual dimorphism.|$|E
