5|$|Hundreds of Iowa {{children}} were left homeless by the Civil War. On November 16, 1865, the Iowa Soldiers' Orphans' Home (renamed the Annie Wittenmyer Home in 1949) was opened. The first 150 children arrived from Keokuk, Iowa. Starting in 1876, children from broken homes {{as well as}} orphans from all of Iowa's ninety-nine counties were taken in at <b>the</b> <b>home.</b> <b>The</b> <b>home</b> was a self-contained community, containing residences, a school, tailor shop, and a chapel. <b>The</b> <b>home</b> had three separate fires during its course. On November 9, 1887, at three o’clock in the morning, the third fire started. The building burnt to the ground. The next day’s Morning Democrat Gazette pointed out that if home was not set up with several different buildings as houses, all 350 children at the time would have been homeless, and some may have not survived the fire. After 110 years of service, <b>the</b> <b>home</b> closed in 1975. It is estimated that well over 12,000 {{children were}} helped by <b>the</b> <b>Home</b> during its operation.|$|E

40|$|A 1, 456 ft 2 modular {{home and}} {{conventional}} site built home in Benton Harbor, Michigan are analyzed {{to examine how}} the different construction and design methods of two types of housing influence environmental impact over their 50 year life span. <b>The</b> chosen modular <b>home</b> is fabricated by Redman Homes in Topeka, Indiana and transported to the building site. <b>The</b> conventional <b>home</b> is modeled after <b>the</b> modular <b>home</b> in collaboration with Douglas Construction Company. Many assumptions and simplification were made due to data gaps, so results represent preliminary estimates. The total amount of the materials placed in <b>the</b> conventional <b>home</b> is 9 % less than the amount of <b>the</b> modular <b>home</b> because <b>the</b> modular <b>home</b> is framed with larger 2 X 6 studs and requires additional structural components. <b>The</b> conventional <b>home</b> produces 2. 5 times more construction wastes than <b>the</b> modular <b>home.</b> <b>The</b> lesser material consumption of <b>the</b> conventional <b>home</b> is offset by a larger amount of waste generation. The building use phase dominates more than 93 % {{of the life cycle}} energy consumption and over 95 % of the total greenhouse gas emissions for both <b>homes.</b> <b>The</b> total life cycle energy consumption for modular home is 5 % less than <b>the</b> conventional site <b>home.</b> <b>The</b> total global warming potential for <b>the</b> modular <b>home</b> is 5 % less than the conventional site built <b>home.</b> <b>The</b> use phase energy consumption and greenhouse gas emission differences are attributed to the expected higher air tightness (0. 194 ACH) of <b>the</b> modular <b>home</b> over <b>the</b> conventional <b>home.</b> <b>The</b> conventional <b>home</b> was modeled with 80 % lower air tightness (0. 35 ACH) than <b>the</b> modular <b>home,</b> which results in 7 % more of the natural gas consumption over its service life. <b>The</b> modular <b>home</b> requires additional transportation energy compared to <b>the</b> conventional <b>home</b> for delivering <b>the</b> fabricated modular <b>home</b> to <b>the</b> site. However, 4 ~ 5 days of <b>the</b> modular <b>home’s</b> short fabrication cycle time allows <b>the</b> modular <b>home</b> to significantly reduce the employee’s transportation energy compared to that of <b>the</b> conventional <b>home...</b>|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Home</b> Army was {{intended}} to be representative of the Polish nation, its members being recruited from all parties and social classes (the only notable exception being communists sent by the Soviets, and the Soviet-created People's Army). <b>The</b> <b>Home</b> Army's growth was largely based on integrating, into its ranks, scores of smaller resistance organizations. Most other Polish underground armed organizations were incorporated into <b>the</b> <b>Home</b> Army (though they retained varying degrees of autonomy). The largest organization merged into <b>the</b> <b>Home</b> Army was the leftist Bataliony Chłopskie (Peasants' Battalions), about 1943-44. Parts of the Narodowe Siły Zbrojne (National Armed Forces) also came to be subordinated to <b>the</b> <b>Home</b> Army. As a result, individual Home Army units varied substantially in their political outlooks (notably in their attitudes toward ethnic minorities and toward the Soviets). The largest group that completely refused to join <b>the</b> <b>Home</b> Army was the pro-Soviet, communist People's Army, which at its height in 1944 numbered 30,000 people.|$|E
