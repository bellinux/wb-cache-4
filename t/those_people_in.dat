The government counted all <b>those</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> France who migrated from countries with a dominant Muslim population, or whose parents did. Only 33% of those 5 to 6 million people (2 million) said they were practicing believers. That figure is the same as that obtained by the INED/INSEE study in October 2010.|$|E
25|$|Frankie Laine was {{somebody}} that everybody knew. He {{was a kind}} of a household word like Frank Sinatra or Bobby Darin or Peggy Lee or Ella Fitzgerald—Frankie Laine {{was one of the great}} popular singers and stylists of that time…And his style…he was one of those artists who had such a unique stamp—nobody sounded like he did. You could hear two notes and you knew who it was and you were right on the beam with it right away. And of course that defines a successful popular artist, at least at that time. These people were all uniquely individual and Frank was on the front rank of <b>those</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> his appeal to the public and his success and certainly in his identifiability. — John Williams.|$|E

25|$|During the 1840s, {{the felt}} hat {{industry}} went into depression; the recession affected Denton, with wages {{in the area}} falling by 35% and only 12 hat manufacturers remaining in Denton. The depression was partially due to changes in fashion away from felt towards silk hats. The revitalisation of the felt hat industry came in the 1850s, once again on a whim of fashion but also {{the increased use of}} machinery led to reduced production costs. The resurgence was demonstrated by the doubling of the number of hat manufacturers in the town between 1861 and 1872. At its peak in the Edwardian period, Denton's felt hat industry was the largest felt hat manufacturing centre in Britain. There were 36 firms directly involved in the felt hat making industry. In 1907 the majority of the 16,428,000 felt hats made in England (worth £2,068,000) were made in Denton and Stockport. In 1921, the working population of Denton was 9,653 with about 41% of <b>those</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> occupations related to the hatting industry. The last hat factory in Denton closed in 1980.|$|E

Considered by Bonsu Thompson of Vibe to be [...] "the Thriller of our generation", Damien Scott of Complex said it [...] "became pop culture catnip" [...] because of its theme. Pop music critic, Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker remarks that [...] "For a while, Confessions was pop music" [...] and says it [...] "may {{turn out to have}} been the last true blockbuster in pop". Clay Cane said in 2008 [...] "We didn’t see pop-R artists on pop radio, and Usher is one of <b>those</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> the 90’s who was the catalyst for that; he was kind of the pioneer [...] He’s the greatest example of pure crossover success".

Complex's Justin Charity referred to him as [...] "the greatest male pop singer of the past couple decades" [...] in 2015.

He further rejected the notion that non-Quebecers could not partake in that province's internal debates and stated that he would [...] "do everything I can to better the conditions of <b>those</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> Quebec who have been betrayed by successive governments." [...] He reiterated the intent of the compromise motion by stating that if [...] "the overwhelming majority of the people of Quebec want out of Confederation, it will be time enough to call in the lawyers."

2500|$|There {{are also}} {{several kinds of}} global supervenience relations, which were {{introduced}} to handle cases in which worlds are the same at the base level and also at the supervenient level, but where the ways the properties are connected and distributed in the worlds differ.

[...] To handle this, property-preserving isomorphisms (1-1 and onto functions between the objects of two worlds, whereby an object in one world has a property if and only if the object which that function takes you to in the other world does) are used, and once this is done, several varieties of global supervenience can be defined.|$|E

Even after the reports of Srebrenica were released, Milošević refused to accept that Mladić {{was responsible for the}} crimes he was accused of. Wesley Clark, {{who was a member of}} the US team that helped negotiate the 1995 peace agreement ending the Bosnian War, claimed in his testimony during the trial of Milošević that Milošević had prior knowledge of the Srebrenica massacre and knew of Mladić's plans. During the negotiations, Clark had asked Milošević: 'Mr. President, you say you have so much influence over the Bosnian Serbs, but how is it then, if you have such influence, that you allowed General Mladić to kill all <b>those</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> Srebrenica?' with Milošević answering: 'Well, General Clark...
