5|$|The {{origins of}} the {{survival}} horror game {{can be traced back}} to earlier horror fiction. Archetypes have been linked to <b>the</b> <b>books</b> <b>of</b> H. P. Lovecraft, which include investigative narratives, or journeys through the depths. Comparisons have been made between Lovecraft's Cthulhoid Old Ones and the boss encounters seen in many survival horror games. Themes of survival have also been traced to the slasher film subgenre, where the protagonist endures a confrontation with the ultimate antagonist. Another major influence on the genre is Japanese horror, including classical Noh theatre, <b>the</b> <b>books</b> <b>of</b> Edogawa Rampo, and Japanese cinema. The survival horror genre largely draws from both Western (mainly American) and Asian (mainly Japanese) traditions, with the Western approach to horror generally favouring action-oriented visceral horror while the Japanese approach tends to favour psychological horror.|$|E

5|$|As the 18th century dawned, Sicilian architects were {{employed}} to create the new palazzi and churches. These architects, often local, were able to design in a more sophisticated style {{than those of the}} late 17th century; many had been trained in mainland Italy and had returned with a more detailed understanding of the Baroque idiom. Their work inspired less-travelled Sicilian designers. Very importantly, these architects were also assisted by <b>the</b> <b>books</b> <b>of</b> engravings by Domenico de' Rossi, who for the first time wrote down text with his engravings, giving the precise dimensions and measurements of many of the principal Renaissance and Baroque façades in Rome. In this way, the Renaissance finally came late to Sicily by proxy.|$|E
5|$|Calvin {{produced}} {{commentaries on}} most of <b>the</b> <b>books</b> <b>of</b> the Bible. His first commentary on Romans was published in 1540, and he planned to write commentaries on the entire New Testament. Six years passed before he wrote his second, a commentary on First Epistle to the Corinthians, but after that he devoted more attention to reaching his goal. Within four years he had published commentaries on all the Pauline epistles, and he also revised the commentary on Romans. He then {{turned his attention to}} the general epistles, dedicating them to Edward VI of England. By 1555 he had completed his work on the New Testament, finishing with the Acts and the Gospels (he omitted only the brief second and third Epistles of John and the Book of Revelation). For the Old Testament, he wrote commentaries on Isaiah, <b>the</b> <b>books</b> <b>of</b> the Pentateuch, the Psalms, and Joshua. The material for the commentaries often originated from lectures to students and ministers that he reworked for publication. From 1557 onwards, he could not find the time to continue this method, and he gave permission for his lectures to be published from stenographers' notes. These Praelectiones covered the minor prophets, Daniel, Jeremiah, Lamentations, and part of Ezekiel.|$|E
5|$|In 1802, George hired Reverend Thomas Frognall Dibdin as an {{official}} librarian {{to look after the}} collection and the library contains his many catalogues entitled Aedes Althorpianæ, documenting <b>the</b> <b>books</b> <b>of</b> the library. The collection became so enormous that the massive library became inadequate to hold the contents, and books began being stored along the long picture gallery on the first floor above it. By the time of George John's death in 1834, he had amassed one of the largest private collections in Europe of some 110,000 volumes. Alcoves were added {{to the ends of the}} library during the Holland restoration, creating extra room for the growing collection.|$|E

50|$|Among the {{principal}} relevant prophetic texts are {{those found in}} the Jewish Bible or Old Testament in <b>the</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> Daniel, <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>of</b> Isaiah and <b>the</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> Ezekiel, and {{those found in the}} New Testament in <b>the</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> Revelation.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> Los, {{along with}} <b>The</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> Ahania, {{serves as an}} {{experimental}} revision <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> Urizen. <b>The</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> Los, last of the [...] "Lambeth Books", goes back to <b>The</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> Urizen to analyse both {{the self and the}} nature of the prophet-priest. The story's relationship to <b>The</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> Urizen parallels <b>the</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> Genesis as <b>the</b> second chapter is a retelling of the first under a new perspective. The poem starts at the fourth chapter in <b>The</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> Urizen. Within <b>the</b> work, Los is bound and is forced to watch the world and the fallen Urizen. Los, struggling against desire and his prison, creates only problems for him and he is trapped in a manner similar to Urizen.|$|R
5|$|In Aland's Profile, Kurt and Barbara Aland {{placed the}} codex's Gospels in Category III, meaning it has {{historical}} importance, with {{the profile of}} 1191, 802, 601/2, 69s. This means {{the text of the}} codex agrees with the Byzantine standard text 119 times, with the original text against the Byzantine 80 times, and with both the Byzantine and original text 60 times. There are 69 independent or distinctive readings in the Gospels. While the Gospels are a representative of the Caesarean text-type, the remainder of <b>the</b> <b>books</b> <b>of</b> the New Testament in this codex is a representative of the Byzantine text-type and falls into Category V, the lowest and least important in Aland's Profile.|$|E
5|$|In Zürich, Vermigli succeeded Konrad Pellikan as {{the chair}} of Hebrew, a {{position}} he would hold until his death. He married his second wife, Catarina Merenda of Brescia, Italy, in 1559. Vermigli was able to share his teaching duties with fellow Hebraist Theodor Bibliander, allowing him time to study and prepare the notes from his previous lectures for publication. He began lecturing on <b>the</b> <b>books</b> <b>of</b> Samuel and Kings. While in Zürich, Vermigli declined invitations to desirable positions in Geneva, Heidelberg, and England.|$|E
5|$|In late 1916 Fisher {{and another}} {{prominent}} Bible Student at the Brooklyn headquarters, Clayton J. Woodworth, sought the Executive Committee's approval {{to produce a}} book about the prophecies of <b>the</b> <b>books</b> <b>of</b> Revelation and Ezekiel based primarily on Russell's writings. Work on the book, The Finished Mystery, proceeded without the knowledge of the full Board of Directors and Editorial Committee and was released by Rutherford to headquarters staff on July 17, 1917, the day he announced the appointment of the four replacement directors.|$|E

50|$|He {{was also}} a pioneer of natural science and zoology. He is {{considered}} as the first Muslim scientist to study animals in detail. He wrote many works such as: Kitab al-Khail (<b>The</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Horse), Kitab al-Ibil (<b>The</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Camel), Kitab al-Farq (<b>The</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> Rare Animals), Kitab al-Wuhush (<b>The</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> Wild Animals), Kitab al-Sha (<b>The</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sheep) and Kitab Khalaq al-Insan (<b>The</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> Humanity). He also provides detailed information on human anatomy and was credited with composing an epic {{on the life of}} Antarah ibn Shaddad.|$|R
5|$|Osorkon IV is attested by Assyrian {{documents}} (as Shilkanni {{and other}} epithets) and probably also by <b>the</b> <b>Books</b> <b>of</b> Kings (as King So), while Manetho's epitomes {{seem to have}} ignored him. He is undoubtedly attested by the well-known Victory Stela of Piye on which he is depicted while prostrating {{in front of the}} owner of the stela along with other submitted rulers. Another finding almost certainly referring to him is the aforementioned aegis of Sekhmet, found at Bubastis and mentioning a King Osorkon son of queen Tadibast whoas the name does not coincide with those of any of the other Osorkon kings' motherscan only be Osorkon IV's mother.|$|E
5|$|There are {{differences}} within the material added by Scribe B. The first 23 stanzas of the B material {{shows signs of}} partial modernisation of the orthography, while the remainder show much more retention of Old Welsh features. Jarman explains this by suggesting that Scribe B started by partially modernising the orthography as he copied the stanzas, {{but after a while}} tired of this and copied the remaining stanzas {{as they were in the}} older manuscript. Isaac suggested that Scribe B was using two sources, called B1 and B2. If this is correct, the material in <b>the</b> <b>Books</b> <b>of</b> Aneirin is from three sources.|$|E
5|$|Usermaatre Osorkon IV was {{an ancient}} Egyptian pharaoh {{during the late}} Third Intermediate Period. Traditionally {{considered}} the very last king of the 22nd Dynasty, he was de facto little more than ruler in Tanis and Bubastis, in Lower Egypt. He is generally – though not universally – identified with the King Shilkanni mentioned by Assyrian sources, and with the biblical So, King of Egypt from <b>the</b> <b>Books</b> <b>of</b> Kings.|$|E

5|$|The Satanic Bible is {{composed}} <b>of</b> four books: <b>The</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> Satan, <b>The</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> Lucifer, <b>The</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> Belial, and <b>The</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> Leviathan. <b>The</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> Satan challenges <b>the</b> Ten Commandments and the Golden Rule, and promotes Epicureanism. <b>The</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> Lucifer holds {{most of the}} philosophy in The Satanic Bible, with twelve chapters discussing topics such as indulgence, love, hate, and sex. LaVey also uses <b>the</b> <b>book</b> to dispel rumors surrounding the religion. In <b>The</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> Belial, LaVey details rituals and magic. He discusses the required mindset and focus for performing a ritual, and provides instructions for three rituals: those for sex, compassion, or destruction. <b>The</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> Leviathan provides four invocations for Satan, lust, compassion, and destruction. It also lists the nineteen Enochian Keys (adapted from John Dee's Enochian keys), provided in both Enochian and translated to English.|$|R
60|$|First then, {{there is}} <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> creatures to be opened. Second, <b>The</b> <b>book</b> <b>of</b> God's remembrance. Third, <b>The</b> <b>book</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> law. And fourth, <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>of</b> life. For by {{every one of}} these, that is, out of what is written in them, shall {{the world of the}} ungodly be judged.|$|R
5|$|Claudius {{also wrote}} commentaries on <b>the</b> <b>books</b> <b>of</b> Leviticus, the {{historical}} {{books of the}} Old Testament, the Gospel of Matthew, and all Pauline epistles, of which the commentary on the Epistle to Galatians shows some of his views prefigure those expressed by both the Waldensians and Protestants centuries later. It was once {{thought that he had}} in fact founded the Waldensians, however this was disproved in the 19th century. His epistles on 1 and 2 Corinthians, however, dedicated to Theodemir, abbot of Psalmody, and a possible student of his, were sent to Aachen by the dedicatee to be condemned by the assembled bishops of the realm. The Corinthian commentaries were unpublished, though it was these commentaries that sparked the controversy concerning icons and pilgrimages.|$|E
5|$|During the English Civil War, {{the cathedral}} was overrun by Parliamentarian troops. Along with other destruction, the troops seized <b>the</b> <b>books</b> <b>of</b> the cathedral library, {{taking them to}} Cardiff Castle, where they were burned along with many copies of the Book of Common Prayer. Among those invited to the castle to warm {{themselves}} by the fire on that cold winter day, were the wives of some sequestered clergymen. Also during this time of unrest, a man named Milles, {{who claimed to be}} a practising Puritan, appropriated portions of the cathedral for his own gain. Milles set up a tavern in the cathedral, used part of it as a stable, turned the choir area into a pen for his calves and used the font as a trough for his pigs.|$|E
5|$|Eliab Harvey {{was born}} in Chigwell, Essex to William and Emma Harvey. His father William Harvey was a Member of Parliament for Essex, but died when Harvey was only five years old, in 1763. Until 1768, Harvey was raised at the family estate of Rolls Park in Chigwell, which had passed to his elder brother William {{on the death of}} their father. Harvey then {{attended}} Westminster School for two years before moving to Harrow School in 1770. At the age of thirteen in 1771, Harvey was entered onto <b>the</b> <b>books</b> <b>of</b> the naval schooner HMS Mary, although he did not actually serve aboard the ship. Utilising a standard legal fiction of the time, Harvey's name was entered on the ship's books without his actual presence, a ruse that would provide him with sufficient seniority to gain rapid promotion when he did enter the navy. In his summer holidays from school, Harvey served at sea, joining HMS Orpheus in 1773.|$|E
