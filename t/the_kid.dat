5|$|As {{the game}} wears on, Shooter only deals, {{and then after}} another hand when Howard outplays them, two more players, Yeller and Sokal, drop out. That leaves just Howard and <b>the</b> <b>Kid.</b> After a few {{unlikely}} wins, <b>the</b> <b>Kid</b> calls for a break and confronts Shooter, who admits to being forced into cheating by Slade. <b>The</b> <b>Kid</b> insists he can win {{on his own and}} tells Shooter to deal straight or he will blow the whistle, destroying Shooter's reputation. Before the game resumes, Melba succeeds in seducing <b>the</b> <b>Kid.</b> Christian makes a surprise visit to the room, catches them after the fact and walks out on <b>The</b> <b>Kid.</b>|$|E

40|$|In {{a family}} context with {{endogenous}} timing, multiple public goods and alternative parental instruments, {{we show that}} the optimal timing for the sequential-action game played by rotten kids and a parent depends crucially on whether <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> are homogeneous or heterogeneous. For homogeneous <b>kids,</b> <b>the</b> rotten <b>kid</b> theorem holds irrespective of the parental policy instrument, implying that it is optimal to let <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> to be action leaders. If <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> are heterogeneous, however, parental leadership yields a first best outcome and, hence, it is optimal whenever <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> are economically dependent and agree on the tradeoff between public goods...|$|R
5|$|To repair Zulf's {{damage to}} the Bastion, <b>the</b> <b>Kid</b> starts {{collecting}} Shards, a lesser form of Cores. As he obtains the penultimate shard needed, the Ura attack the Bastion, damaging it and abducting Zia. In the next seven days, <b>The</b> <b>Kid</b> engages in sporadic skirmishes in Ura territory. When he finally blasts through an Ura outpost and meets Zia, she tells him that she had left with the Ura voluntarily to find out their intentions; Rucks had previously told Zia that the Bastion {{had the ability to}} somehow fix the Calamity. <b>The</b> <b>Kid</b> travels to the once-underground Ura homeland to retrieve the last shard. There, he discovers Zulf being attacked by his own people: the battle with <b>the</b> <b>Kid</b> has devastated the Ura forces, and they blame Zulf for bringing <b>the</b> <b>Kid</b> to their home. <b>The</b> <b>Kid</b> can choose to drop his weapon to help Zulf or leave him. If he leaves Zulf behind, <b>the</b> <b>Kid</b> destroys the remnants of the Ura and escapes through a skyway. If he chooses to carry Zulf, Ura archers initially open fire on them but ultimately cease fire and watch silently as <b>the</b> <b>Kid</b> and Zulf take the skyway back to the Bastion.|$|E
5|$|If {{the player}} plays as <b>the</b> <b>Kid,</b> Sara is trapped in LeMU instead of Coco; <b>the</b> <b>Kid</b> {{frequently}} has visions of Coco, {{but no one}} else sees her. The group manages to contact the surface, and open and close doors to various rooms in LeMU to move the water around, allowing them to escape. After having played the game as both Takeshi and <b>the</b> <b>Kid,</b> the player accesses the final route, in which it is revealed that while the events Takeshi experienced took place in 2017, those <b>the</b> <b>Kid</b> experienced were a recreation, and took place in a rebuilt LeMU in 2034. The You of 2017, whose full first name is Yubiseiharukana, had artificially impregnated herself and given birth to Yubiseiakikana, who took the role of You during the recreation. Pipi had escaped LeMU in 2017, carrying with it the disk with Sora's memories and footage of Coco being trapped in IBF. Sara and <b>the</b> <b>Kid</b> are revealed to be Tsugumi and Takeshi's children, and the Kid's real name turns out to be Hokuto. <b>The</b> <b>Kid</b> of 2017, whose name is Ryogo Kaburaki, played the role of Takeshi during the recreation, having stopped aging due to the Cure virus.|$|E
5|$|Jarrett {{used his}} {{strength}} against the 1–2–3 Kid {{in the following}} match. <b>The</b> <b>Kid</b> fought back with a spinning heel kick, but Jarrett regained control. Toward {{the end of the}} match, <b>The</b> <b>Kid</b> sustained a kayfabe injury to his knee. Jarrett tried to use this to his advantage by using the Figure Four leglock, but <b>The</b> <b>Kid</b> blocked the hold by using a small package to pin Jarrett for the victory. Upset at being eliminated from the tournament, Jarrett responded by performing three piledrivers on <b>The</b> <b>Kid</b> after the match.|$|E

50|$|Initially named Hans und Fritz {{after the}} two naughty protagonist brothers, Dirks' feature was called The Captain and <b>the</b> <b>Kids</b> from 1918 on.

Following Ramon's loss to the newcomer, Money Inc. (Ted DiBiase and Irwin R. Schyster) teased Ramon about the match. DiBiase offered Ramon {{a job as a}} servant, which Ramon angrily refused. Ramon began teaming with the 1-2-3 Kid for a series of matches against Money Inc. DiBiase asked for a singles match against <b>the</b> <b>Kid,</b> and <b>the</b> <b>Kid</b> {{accepted}} the challenge. Ramon helped <b>the</b> <b>Kid</b> win the match by distracting DiBiase. It was decided that the feuds would be settled in two singles matches at SummerSlam, with Ramon facing DiBiase and Schyster facing the 1-2-3 Kid.|$|E
5|$|During his quest, <b>the</b> <b>Kid</b> meets {{two more}} survivors: Zulf, an {{ambassador}} from the Ura, underground-dwelling {{people with whom}} Caelondia was once at war; and Zia, an Ura girl {{who was raised in}} Caelondia. Both of them return to the Bastion, but upon reading a journal that <b>the</b> <b>Kid</b> discovers, Zulf intentionally damages parts of the Bastion's central device (the monument) and returns to Ura territory. <b>The</b> <b>Kid</b> learns that the journal belonged to Zia's father, Venn, who had worked for the Caelondians. He had helped Caelondian scientists ("Mancers") build a weapon intended to destroy the Ura completely to prevent another war. Venn rigged the weapon to backfire, so that when he was finally forced to trigger it, the resulting Calamity destroyed most of Caelondia as well.|$|E

They both proclaim they won't fight each other, but Herod tells them he will have them gunned down by his men if they refuse. Herod takes <b>The</b> <b>Kid</b> aside and asks him to withdraw from the contest, telling him his time will come. <b>The</b> <b>Kid</b> refuses and they fight, with <b>The</b> <b>Kid</b> wounding Herod in the neck while Herod delivers a fatal bullet to <b>The</b> <b>Kid</b> who dies in Ellen's arms. Ellen and Cort then face each other, but both refuse to draw their weapons. Herod begins a countdown from ten, declaring that if neither draws by the time he gets to zero he will have them both killed. Cort begs Ellen to kill him but she still refuses. When Herod reaches one Cort draws and fires. Doc Wallace declares Ellen dead, and Cort angrily storms up to Herod and demands they fight immediately. Herod refuses, telling Cort they will meet at dawn. Later that night, one of Herod's men, Ratsy, chains Cort to a table and beats him severely before smashing Cort's gunfighting hand and breaking it.|$|E
