5|$|Hoping {{to obscure}} the truth about Stanley's affair, Michael starts {{spreading}} a variety of false rumors, among them that there is another person physically inside Kevin (Brian Baumgartner), that Kelly is anorexic, that Toby (Paul Lieberstein) is still a virgin, that Pam (Jenna Fischer) is pregnant, and that Andy (Ed Helms) is gay. When Andy hears about this, he realizes that many people have thought this {{about him in the}} past and gets increasingly insecure as he begins to question his sexual orientation. Jim and Pam, who were trying to keep Pam's pregnancy a secret, <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> been found out. The couple then notice that there have been various absurd rumors about office employees being spread. When Jim brings it to everyone's attention, they trace one particular rumor back to Michael, who then tries to slip out of the office.|$|E
5|$|Mozart had a pet common {{starling}} {{which could}} sing {{part of his}} Piano Concerto in G Major (KV. 453). He had bought it from a shop after hearing it sing a phrase from a work he wrote six weeks previously, which {{had not yet been}} performed in public. He became very attached to the bird and arranged an elaborate funeral for it when it died three years later. It has been suggested that his A Musical Joke (K. 522) might be written in the comical, inconsequential style of a starling's vocalisation. Other people who have owned common starlings report how adept they are at picking up phrases and expressions. The words have no meaning for the starling, so they often mix them up or use them on what to humans are inappropriate occasions in their songs. Their ability at mimicry is so great that strangers have looked in vain for the human they <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> just heard speak.|$|E
25|$|Carmen Carlson (Allyn Ann McLerie) is Mr. Carlson's sweet-natured wife. Though happily married, {{they are}} so anxious to avoid hurting each other's {{feelings}} that they rarely tell each other what they really <b>think.</b> <b>They</b> <b>have</b> a son, Arthur Carlson, Jr., whom they've sent off to military school. During the second season Carmen has a surprise pregnancy and during the third season gives birth to a daughter, Melanie.|$|E

25|$|With secession, many Quebec nationalists <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> {{the answer}} to Canada's continual {{constitutional}} debate. Marginalized after the Patriotes rebellion of 1837–38, the secessionist option was resurrected as a credible solution {{in the wake of}} the 1960s Quiet Revolution of Quebec. Some politicians see the independence as the normal conclusion of the Quebec struggle for the conservation of its autonomy within the Canadian federal framework. Some see it in a broader perspective of every people's right to self-determination and what they see as the normal evolution of a 400-year-old former French colony that fell victim to the colonial wars between Great Britain and France.|$|E
25|$|I cannot {{forget that}} ever since I {{was a child}} Fitzwilliam has been, in all situations, my warmest and most affectionate friend, and {{the person in the}} world of whom decidedly I have the best opinion, and so in most respects I have still, but as a {{politician}} I cannot reconcile his conduct with what I (who have known him for more than five-and-thirty years) have always thought to be his character. I <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> all behaved very ill to me, and for most of them, who certainly owe much more to me than I do to them, I feel nothing but contempt, and do not trouble myself about them; but Fitzwilliam is an exception indeed.|$|E

500|$|In the evening, tens of {{thousands}} of government supporters, borrowing the anti-government protesters' slogan [...] "no Sunni, no Shia, only Bahraini", gathered in Al Fateh Mosque in Juffair. [...] One participant interviewed by The New York Times said, [...] "The democracy they have been asking for is already here, but the Shias, they have their ayatollahs, and whatever they say, they will run and do it. If they tell them to burn a house, they will. I <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> a clear intention to disrupt this country".|$|E
500|$|By {{the same}} 8-1 majority, the Court found a {{separate}} and independent {{ground for the}} reversal of Burton's convictions. Burton had requested certain jury instructions, which the trial judge had delivered. But, along with the requested instructions, the trial judge had stated that: [...] " [...] asked by counsel for the defendant to give certain declarations here, and while I <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>have,</b> in the main, been covered by the charge, yet I will give them to you[...] [...] [...] These are abstract propositions of law, which I give {{in connection with the}} charge, as perhaps more fully amplifying it. I am willing to give them, inasmuch as they are asked, and they contain general propositions of law." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Son of a Gun" [...] {{was also}} the first of five Homicide: Life on the Street episodes {{featuring}} Mel Proctor, then the home team sports announcer for the Washington Bullets, as recurring reporter character Grant Besser. Actor Walt MacPherson made a brief appearance as a uniformed police officer who finds an earring at the Adena Watson crime scene and offers it to Bayliss as possible evidence. MacPherson would return in the [...] as the recurring character Detective Roger Gaffney, but there is no indication whether or not the beat cop he played in [...] "Son of a Gun" [...] was the same character. The line spoken by Lewis, [...] "Murderers lie because they have to, witnesses lie because they <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> to, and everyone else lies for the sheer joy of it", is almost a verbatim line from Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets. The line represents a three-rule theorem about police work Simon created after following a Baltimore Police Department homicide unit for one year while writing his book.|$|E

500|$|David Jaffe, {{creator and}} Game Director of the {{original}} God of War, spoke with NowGamer prior to the first press announcement in late April. He {{said that if he}} had worked on Ascension, he would have incorporated three specific elements: different myths, a co-star, and [...] "look to the Zelda structure as a jumping off point". He liked the idea of a cooperative mode, and added [...] "I'd love to see player one be Kratos and player two be this stupid annoying sidekick that—for some to be determined story reason—Kratos is stuck with for the whole adventure and in the end, once the main quest is over, Kratos just snaps the poor kid's neck". In May 2012, Jaffe spoke with IGN about the multiplayer element: [...] "I think it looks cool. It looks like another great, impeccably executed Sony Santa Monica game", and added, [...] "If {{it turns out to be}} the case that the single player is watered down because of , then I <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> some justification. But I don't see any evidence of that, and I don't see evidence of that based on the team they are." ...|$|E
500|$|Milan were {{regarded}} as favourites and their team included many players who had experienced success in the competition. The most notable was captain Paolo Maldini, who had won the competition four times previously, all with Milan, and Clarence Seedorf who had won the competition three times with three different clubs. Liverpool had been considered underdogs throughout the competition, but had beaten more favoured opposition, including Juventus and Chelsea, to reach the final. Liverpool manager Rafael Benítez acknowledged this: [...] "Maybe Milan are favourites, but we have confidence, and we can win". Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger felt Liverpool would win the match: [...] "I fancy Liverpool as Milan look jaded physically and certainly mentally, by losing the [...] title, I <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> never had a better chance than now to beat Milan." [...] Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher was not so optimistic, stating that the Liverpool side were {{not as good as}} the one that had won the 2001 UEFA Cup Final: [...] "No disrespect to the squad we have got now but it is obvious we are not as strong as we were when we won the UEFA Cup in 2001. Back then we had a settled team and that season when we went into games against Barcelona and Roma, we always felt we were as good as them." ...|$|E
500|$|The zombie {{argument}} {{is based on}} a thought experiment proposed by Todd Moody, and developed by David Chalmers in his book The Conscious Mind. The basic idea is that one can imagine one's body, and therefore conceive the existence of one's body, without any conscious states being associated with this body. Chalmers' {{argument is}} that it seems possible that such a being could exist because all that is needed is that all and only the things that the physical sciences describe about a zombie must be true of it. Since none of the concepts involved in these sciences make reference to consciousness or other mental phenomena, and any physical entity can be by definition described scientifically via physics, the move from conceivability to possibility is not such a large one. Others such as Dennett have argued that the notion of a philosophical zombie is an incoherent, or unlikely, concept. It has been argued under physicalism that one must either believe that anyone including oneself might be a zombie, or that no one can be a zombie—following from the assertion that one's own conviction about being (or not being) a zombie {{is a product of the}} physical world and is therefore no different from anyone else's. This argument has been expressed by Dennett who argues that [...] "Zombies think they are conscious, <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> qualia, think they suffer pains—they are just 'wrong' (according to this lamentable tradition) in ways that neither they nor we could ever discover!" ...|$|E

500|$|Another major {{breakthrough}} was developing the plot twist that Prince Hans would be revealed as the film's true villain only near the end. Hans {{was not even}} in the earliest drafts, then at first was not a villain, and after becoming one, was revealed to be evil much earlier in the plot. Del Vecho said, [...] "We realized [...] was most important [...] {{if we were going to}} make the ending so surprising you had to believe at one point that Hans was the answer... he's not the answer, it's Kristoff... f you can get the audience to leap ahead and <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> figured it out you can surprise them by turning it the other way." [...] Lee acknowledged that Hans was written as [...] "sociopathic" [...] and [...] "twisted" [...] throughout the final version. For example, Hans mirrors the behavior of the other characters: [...] "He mirrors [...] and he's goofy with her... he Duke [...] is a jerk, so he's a jerk back. And with Elsa he's a hero." [...] It was difficult to lay the foundation for Anna's belated turn to Kristoff without also making Hans' betrayal of Anna too predictable, in that the audience had to [...] "feel... her feeling something but not quite understanding it... Because the minute it is [...] it deflated." [...] At one point, Anna openly flirted with Kristoff upon first meeting him, but that was changed after Walt Disney Studios chairman Alan Horn pointed out that it would confuse and annoy viewers since Anna was already engaged to Hans.|$|E
