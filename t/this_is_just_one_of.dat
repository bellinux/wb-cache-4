25|$|The third {{generation}} WM was launched alongside the VE Commodore on 16 July 2006 at the Melbourne Exhibition and Convention Centre. With the Statesman's export plans, {{it was decided}} that its launch should be simultaneous with that of the Commodore, rather than months later, as had been the convention. The WM development programme reportedly cost General Motors A$190million with another $1.04billion devoted to the VE Commodore model which the Statesman is based upon. The WM series utilises the GM Zeta platform developed by Holden. Unlike previous models, the WM no longer shares its architecture with an Opel sedan, and has rear doors different from those found on the Commodore. Previously, it had to share the doors, or at least the lower parts, with the lesser Commodore. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the ways Holden has tried to create greater differentiation between the Statesman and the Commodore on which it is based.|$|E

Screen Gems then moved forward with the title Friends with Benefits. At the same time, NBC was developing a sitcom with the same title, but the movie production company stated that due to its production schedule, they didn’t expect an issue to arise. Screen Gems chose to accelerate production fearing that they would lose their title to the competing Paramount project. Director Will Gluck spoke about the frustration of comparing the two films, stating: [...] "I wish there was more space between them. The thing that's irking me now is people are saying we're remaking No Strings Attached. We're not remaking it. The two movies were being made at the same time." [...] Gluck, {{in an interview with}} The New Zealand Herald, said that both films are different. Similar sentiments were expressed by Kunis, stating, [...] "It's just two different movies. There's only [...] so many stories you can tell in the world. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the many." ...|$|E
500|$|Opinions on the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) {{version of}} Mario Bros. have been mostly mixed, but does receive {{positive}} reviews from gamers. However, {{in a review}} of the Virtual Console game, GameSpot criticized the NES version for being a poor port of the arcade version. The Virtual Console version in particular was heavily criticized. GameSpot criticized it, saying that not only is it a port of an inferior version, but it retains all of the technical flaws found in this version. It also criticizes the Mario Bros. ports in general, saying that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> many ports that have been made of it throughout Nintendo's history. IGN complimented the Virtual Console version's gameplay, even though it was critical of Nintendo's decision to release an [...] "inferior" [...] NES port on the Virtual Console. IGN also agreed {{on the issue of the}} number of ports. They said that since most people have Mario Bros. on one of the Super Mario Advance games, this version is not worth 500 Wii Points. The Nintendo e-Reader version of Mario Bros. was slightly more well received by IGN, who praised the gameplay, but criticized it for lack of multiplayer and for not being worth the purchase because of the Super Mario Advance versions.|$|E

500|$|Just before Cassandra leaves town, {{she tells}} Donna that Matt, {{the man who}} raised her, is not her {{biological}} father. Cassandra tells Donna that her real father is a man named Nick. In 2009, {{it was announced that}} Donna's father had been cast and would be introduced the following year. Brian Vriends was given the role of Nick Nixon. Of the introduction of Brian and Nick, executive producer, Susan Bower said [...] "The Freedman family have provided fantastic drama for us so far and we have lots in store for Brian, it's great to have him with us. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> many, many great storylines we have coming up in 2010". Donna discovers that there are two men that could be her father and she contacts them both. Nick Nixon replies first and Donna begins to believe that he is her father. However, Professor Nicholas McKay (Chris Bunworth) later turns up and Donna becomes confused over the situation. Nicholas has just been released from jail and he is keen to do something right. However, he hurts Donna when he tells her that she is just like her mother and that she will run away. Robbie said [...] "He takes a horrible approach". Nicholas' arrival makes Donna more afraid to find out the results of the DNA test she asked Nick to take. On the situation, Robbie said [...] "She's a hopeless romantic and wants the happily ever after – not only with Ringo, but with her family." [...] The DNA test eventually proves that Nick is her real father.|$|E

2500|$|The PIT {{maneuver}} {{was adapted}} from the bump and run technique used in stock car racing, where drivers would bump a competitor to take them out, giving rise to the term, [...] "takeout". [...] This maneuver is illegal in stock car racing because it is very dangerous. [...] The high speed involved in auto racing makes it much easier for drivers to take out another car with a less substantial bump than at lower speeds. [...] When employing the PIT maneuver, {{the speed of the}} two cars involved will determine how far the car will travel once it is bumped. [...] Partially for this reason, the higher the speed, the more unpredictable and dangerous the PIT maneuver becomes. [...] <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the very important factors a police officer must consider before implementing the PIT maneuver. A police officer is trained to wait until conditions are right before attempting a PIT maneuver to avoid the use of deadly force.

[...] "One {{mark of a}} great book" [...] Murray said, [...] "is a thesis so powerful that {{after a few years}} people take it for granted. Thomas Sowell's A Conflict of Visions (1987) is such a book. Its thesis: The policy arguments between liberals and conservatives, socialists and libertarians, do not arise just from differences in priorities regarding freedom, equality, and security. At root, they draw from different conceptions of the nature of man." [...] Murray concluded [...] "A Conflict of Visions gives us an intellectual framework that must shape an attentive reader's {{way of looking at the}} political world forever after.
