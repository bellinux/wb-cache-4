5|$|Leicester City {{started their}} cup run against Barnsley, but {{required}} a replay <b>to</b> <b>overcome</b> <b>their</b> Third Division opponents 2–1. The first Leicester goal was controversial, as the referee overruled his linesman, who had flagged for a foul. Barnsley equalised with a penalty, but Leicester quickly retook the lead. Later {{in the second}} half Leicester claimed a third goal, but the referee adjudged that the ball had not crossed the line. A 1–0 win at Millwall followed.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} protons and {{neutrons}} in the atomic nucleus can be modified, although this can require very high energies {{because of the}} strong force. Nuclear fusion occurs when multiple atomic particles join to form a heavier nucleus, such as through the energetic collision of two nuclei. For example, {{at the core of}} the Sun protons require energies of 3–10 keV <b>to</b> <b>overcome</b> <b>their</b> mutual repulsion—the coulomb barrier—and fuse together into a single nucleus. Nuclear fission is the opposite process, causing a nucleus to split into two smaller nuclei—usually through radioactive decay. The nucleus can also be modified through bombardment by high energy subatomic particles or photons. If this modifies the number of protons in a nucleus, the atom changes to a different chemical element.|$|E
25|$|In general, proton–proton fusion {{can occur}} {{only if the}} kinetic energy (i.e. temperature) of the protons is high enough <b>to</b> <b>overcome</b> <b>their</b> mutual {{electrostatic}} or Coulomb repulsion.|$|E

However, Earthmen would first need <b>to</b> <b>overcome</b> <b>their</b> antagonism of robots. To this end, they have established habitations on Earth through which they hope to introduce humanoid robots to Earth.|$|E
25|$|Shortly after Central America {{declared}} {{independence from}} the Spanish Empire, some of its countries were annexed by the First Mexican Empire in 1821 and then Central America formed the Federal Republic in 1823. From 1838 to 1840 the federation descended into civil war, with conservatives fighting against liberals and separatists fighting to secede. The various political factions were unable <b>to</b> <b>overcome</b> <b>their</b> ideological differences and the federation dissolved {{after a series of}} bloody conflicts.|$|E

25|$|Regional {{cooperation}} in East Asia {{has been greatly}} promoted though some countries such as North Korea remain isolated from the international community. Active discussion in various formats is underway for regional {{cooperation in}} East Asia. In this island of Jeju, many international meetings have been held to promote such cooperation, including summit meetings among Korea, Japan and China and between Korea and ASEAN countries, meetings which help nations <b>to</b> <b>overcome</b> <b>their</b> differences and thus promote reconciliation and cooperation.|$|E

40|$|Diabetes {{mellitus}} {{represents a}} major public health threat worldwide. A serious complication of diabetes {{is the development of}} foot ulcers which, when they become infected, are {{the most common cause of}} diabetes-related hospital admissions and a leading cause of lower extremity amputation. In this review, we will update information on the diabetic foot microbiota together with the factors influencing its composition. We highlight the role of bacteria in the pathogenesis of diabetic foot ulcers. Based on current research evidence, we address the issue of differentiating infection from colonization. Finally, we emphasize the importance of the use of complementary culture and molecular-based methods for describing complex microbiotas, with a view <b>to</b> <b>overcoming</b> <b>their</b> respective limits...|$|R

25|$|High {{temperatures}} {{give the}} nuclei enough energy <b>to</b> <b>overcome</b> <b>their</b> electrostatic repulsion (see Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution). For deuterium and tritium, the optimal reaction rates occur at temperatures {{on the order}} of 100,000,000 K. The plasma is heated to a high temperature by ohmic heating (running a current through the plasma). Additional heating is applied using neutral beam injection (which cross magnetic field lines without a net deflection and will not cause a large electromagnetic disruption) and radio frequency (RF) or microwave heating.|$|E

25|$|The {{significance}} of this NFC Championship Game {{is that it was}} the first, and to date, the only time that any Conference Championship game was played on a Saturday, instead of the usual Sunday. In their regular season meeting, Dallas had handed Washington their only loss of the year, 24–10, holding running back John Riggins to just 26 rushing yards while sacking quarterback Joe Theismann seven times and intercepting three of his passes. But this game, would turn out quite different as the Redskins sealed the victory by converting two turnovers in the final quarter into 10 points. Although Dallas outgained Washington in total yards 340–260, it wasn't enough <b>to</b> <b>overcome</b> <b>their</b> three turnovers versus none for the Redskins.|$|E

Dillon and his roommate Landon are majoring their college courses in applied developmental psychology: variability in teacher-student interactions at East Valley Academy High School. Dillon, an everyday Christ like purposeful male example, must deal with his unemployed roommate crashing on the couch, and being more than just a neighborly influence to his neighbor Jaris, a widowed, pregnant, mother of three children. An ongoing high school feud of girl foes {{is at the top of}} Dillon and Landon’s psychology matters, as the two who aim to bring strong Christian influences <b>to</b> <b>overcoming</b> <b>their</b> principal leader’s Buddhist beliefs into the light of salvation.|$|R
25|$|The Suns {{had their}} home court {{advantage}} quickly taken {{away as the}} Spurs took a tight Game 1, a game that saw Nash missing the final minutes for Phoenix due to a gash to his nose, which bled profusely. Nash and the Suns recovered to take Game 2 but after the game, Suns forward Amar'e Stoudemire accused the Spurs, especially Bruce Bowen and Manu Ginóbili, of being a dirty team. Despite the added scrutiny by the media circles, the Spurs won Game 3. The Suns, trying <b>to</b> <b>overcome</b> <b>their</b> recent failures against Texas teams in the playoffs (the Spurs and the Mavericks both defeated them in the Conference Finals), willed themselves to a come-from-behind victory in Game 4 to tie the series at 2.|$|E
25|$|The {{bitter taste}} is almost universally {{unpleasant}} to humans. This is because many nitrogenous organic molecules {{which have a}} pharmacological effect on humans taste bitter. These include caffeine, nicotine, and strychnine, which respectively compose the stimulant in coffee, addictive agent in cigarettes, and active compound in many pesticides. It appears that some psychological process allows humans <b>to</b> <b>overcome</b> <b>their</b> innate aversion to bitter taste, as caffeinated drinks are widely consumed and enjoyed around the world. It is also {{interesting to note that}} many common medicines have a bitter taste if chewed; the gustatory system apparently interprets these compounds as poisons. In this manner, the unpleasant reaction to the bitter taste is a last-line warning system before the compound is ingested and can do damage.|$|E
25|$|Another famous {{philosophy}} is that formulated by Nachman of Breslov and adhered to by Breslov Hasidim. In contrast {{to most of}} his peers who believed God must be worshiped through joy, Nachman portrayed the corporeal world in grim colors, as a place devoid of God's immediate presence from which the soul yearns to liberate itself. He mocked the attempts to perceive the nature of infinite-finite dialectics {{and the manner in}} which God still occupies the Vacant Void albeit not, stating these were paradoxical, beyond human understanding. Only naive faith in their reality would do. Mortals were in constant struggle <b>to</b> <b>overcome</b> <b>their</b> profane instincts, and had to free themselves from their limited intellects to see the world as it truly is.|$|E

50|$|It is {{suspected}} that the western cicada killer represents more than one species.
