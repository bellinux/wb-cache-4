On the plus side, we find <b>that</b> <b>stronger</b> creditor rights are associated with higher growth. In contrast, we find that the benefits of information sharing among creditors appear to be universally positive. Greater information sharing leads to higher bank profitability, lower bank risk, a reduced likelihood of financial crisis, and higher economic growth.

40|$|Using panel data on 166 countries, {{this paper}} {{analyzes}} {{the effects of}} corporate governance, employment protection, investor protection, and political environments on the exporting performance. Our gravity model predicts <b>that</b> <b>stronger</b> democratic political institutions encourage exports.

We also note <b>that</b> <b>stronger</b> employee protection, and therefore, rigid labor regulations can distort the exporting decision of firms. In addition, a stronger shareholder protection tends to be associated with lower exports, probably attributed to lower innovative activity. We interpret these results as an indication that (i) countries with a higher quality of institution suffer from less formal and informal trade barriers, which make international trade relations easier, and (ii) both the employee protection and the shareholder protection, on the other hand, trivialize the country’s export...|$|R

5|$|In Constantinople, Allied {{military}} representatives {{pushed to}} threaten the Ottoman government for the affair, while the French simultaneously explored the possibility of reaching a modus vivendi with Kemal. The Allied Supreme Council, {{which at the time}} was working out the details to a peace treaty that it would present to the Ottoman government, deliberated on how best to respond. Some of the delegates present, including Prime Minister David Lloyd-George, insisted <b>that</b> <b>strong</b> pressure should be brought to bear against the Ottoman government to prevent new atrocities, but the other diplomats were skeptical of the idea. The officials also agreed that the Ottoman government should dismiss Kemal from office, although they admitted that such a move was impractical, since the Ottoman government held no control over Kemal, who was leading a counter Turkish government in Anatolia. A decision was finally reached on 10 March. British, French and Italian leaders agreed to authorize the formal occupation of Constantinople, which was carried out by the forces under General George F. Milne's command on the morning of 16 March.|$|E
5|$|In December 1943, the Alsos Mission reached Algiers, where Pash {{reported}} to the Chief of Staff at Allied Force Headquarters (AFHQ), Major General Walter B. Smith, and his British Chief of Intelligence, Brigadier Kenneth Strong. This was awkward as Pash's instructions were not to give the British information about the Alsos Mission, {{but it turned out}} <b>that</b> <b>Strong</b> was already fully aware of it. It was arranged that Pash would deal with Strong's American deputy, Colonel Thomas E. Roderick. The Alsos Mission then moved on to Italy, where it was assigned to Major General Kenyon A. Joyce's Allied Control Commission. Pash met with Marshal of Italy Pietro Badoglio, the man who had negotiated Italy's surrender to the Allies, and was now head of the Italian Provisional Military Government, who gave him a letter of introduction addressed to Italian civil and military authorities.|$|E
5|$|Returning to education, Mao {{enrolled}} {{and dropped}} out of a police academy, a soap-production school, a law school and an economics school. His father only approved of the latter, but the lectures were in English, which Mao didn't understand, and so Mao abandoned it for the government-run Changsha Middle School; he soon {{dropped out of}} this too, finding it rooted in Confucianism. Undertaking his studies independently, he spent {{much time in the}} Changsha public library, reading core works of classical liberalism such as Adam Smith's The Wealth of Nations and Montesquieu's The Spirit of the Laws, as well as the works of western scientists and philosophers such as Charles Darwin, J.S. Mill, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and Herbert Spencer. Viewing himself as an intellectual, years later he admitted that at this time he thought himself better than working people. Inspired by the work of Friedrich Paulsen, the liberal emphasis on individualism led Mao to believe <b>that</b> <b>strong</b> individuals were not bound by moral codes but should strive for the greater good; that the end justifies the means. Seeing no use in his son's intellectual pursuits, Mao's father cut off his allowance, forcing Mao to move into a hostel for the destitute.|$|E

5|$|The {{magnitude}} and ferocity of the German Ardennes Offensive {{came as a}} shock and Strong was criticised for failing to predict it. However Smith defended Strong against criticism for failing to sound the alarm, feeling <b>that</b> <b>Strong</b> have given ample warning, which had been discounted or disregarded by himself and others. By 19 December, Strong had become concerned that the Germans were going to split Bradley's armies, and he and Whiteley – who had already received Monty's opinion on the matter – went to Smith, recommending that the armies north of the Ardennes be transferred from Bradley to Montgomery's command. Smith realised the military and political implications of this, and knew that such a recommendation had to come from an American officer. On 20 December, Smith spoke to Eisenhower, who deferred judgement until the morning staff meeting. Eisenhower then phoned Bradley and Montgomery and ordered it. The decision was greatly resented by many Americans, particularly at 12th Army Group.|$|E

Our results thus identify a potentially adverse consequence of strong creditor rights. Bankruptcy code Corporate reorganization Investment Diversification...|$|R

40|$|We {{analyze the}} link between {{creditor}} rights and firms’ investment policy, proposing <b>that</b> <b>stronger</b> creditor rights in bankruptcy reduce corporate risk-taking. Employing country-level data, we find <b>that</b> <b>stronger</b> creditor rights {{are associated with a}} greater propensity of firms to engage in diversifying mergers, and this propensity changes in response to changes in the country creditor rights. Also, in countries with stronger creditor rights, operating risk of firms is lower, and acquirers with low-recovery assets prefer targets with high-recovery assets. These relationships are strongest in countries where management is dismissed in reorganization, suggesting a managerial agency effect. Our results question the value of strong creditor rights, which may have adverse effect on firms by inhibiting them from undertaking risky investments. ...|$|R
