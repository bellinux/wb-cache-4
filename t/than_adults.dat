5|$|Another dromaeosaurid species, Deinonychus antirrhopus, may display partial flight capacities. The {{young of}} this species bore longer arms and more robust {{pectoral}} girdles <b>than</b> <b>adults,</b> and which {{were similar to those}} seen in other flapping theropods, implying that they may have been capable of flight when young and then lost the ability as they grew.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{exposure}} {{is a global}} issue since lead mining and smelting, and battery manufacturing/disposal/recycling, are common in many countries. Lead enters the body via inhalation, ingestion, or skin absorption. Almost all inhaled lead is absorbed into the body; for ingestion, the rate is 20–70%, with children absorbing a higher percentage <b>than</b> <b>adults.</b>|$|E
5|$|Males {{and females}} {{are similar in}} appearance. Juvenile birds are {{slightly}} browner than the adults, with buff or brown edges to the feathers of the wings and back. Juveniles have a duller, less streaked appearance <b>than</b> <b>adults.</b> Juveniles moult into adult plumage at around one year old. There is no seasonal difference in the plumage of breeding birds.|$|E

5|$|Other, unusual {{types of}} MS have been described; these include Devic's disease, Balo {{concentric}} sclerosis, Schilder's diffuse sclerosis, and Marburg multiple sclerosis. There is debate {{on whether they}} are MS variants or different diseases. Multiple sclerosis behaves differently in children, taking more time to reach the progressive stage. Nevertheless, they still reach it at a lower average age <b>than</b> <b>adults</b> usually do.|$|E
5|$|Acquisition {{of second}} and {{additional}} languages can come at any age, through exposure {{in daily life}} or courses. Children learning a second language {{are more likely to}} achieve native-like fluency <b>than</b> <b>adults,</b> but in general, it is very rare for someone speaking a second language to pass completely for a native speaker. An important difference between first language acquisition and additional language acquisition is that the process of additional language acquisition is influenced by languages that the learner already knows.|$|E
5|$|Children {{are less}} likely <b>than</b> <b>adults</b> to clear the infection. More than 95% of people who become {{infected}} as adults or older children will stage a full recovery and develop protective immunity to the virus. However, this drops to 30% for younger children, and only 5% of newborns that acquire the infection from their mother at birth will clear the infection. This population has a 40% lifetime risk of death from cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. Of those infected between the age of one to six, 70% will clear the infection.|$|E

5|$|Hatchlings were {{described}} as grey and downy, but their exact appearance is unknown, since no skins exist today. Juvenile birds had fewer prominent grooves in their beaks <b>than</b> <b>adults</b> and they had mottled white and black necks, while the eye spot found in adults was not present; instead, a grey line ran through the eyes (which still had white eye rings) to just below the ears.|$|E
5|$|Hi-5 {{were formed}} in 1998 in Sydney, Australia as a children's musical group. Television {{producer}} Helena Harris, {{who had worked}} on Bananas in Pyjamas, co-created Hi-5 as a concept for a new television show. She and co-producer Posie Graeme-Evans (The Miraculous Mellops, Mirror, Mirror) developed the series as preschool entertainment, incorporating educational trends with a pop music appeal, using music and movement to capture the attention of children. Featuring five performers, the cast are intended to act as older siblings of viewers, rather <b>than</b> <b>adults</b> teaching children. The name of the group {{was derived from the}} high five gesture.|$|E
5|$|Immature red wattlebirds are {{generally}} less flamboyant. Juveniles have much less prominent wattles, brown irises, a pale crown {{and much less}} yellow on the belly. They moult into first immature plumage {{within a few months}} of leaving the nest. First immature birds are more similar to adults overall, having red irises with brown rings, wattles larger but still smaller <b>than</b> <b>adults,</b> and a greyish pink gape.|$|E

5|$|Like the sassabies, {{hartebeest}} produce quiet quacking and grunting sounds. Juveniles {{tend to be}} {{more vocal}} <b>than</b> <b>adults,</b> and produce a quacking call when alarmed or pursued. The hartebeest uses defecation as an olfactory and visual display. Herds are generally sedentary, and tend to migrate only under adverse conditions such as natural calamities. The hartebeest is the least migratory in the tribe Alcelaphini (which also includes wildebeest and sassabies), and also consumes the least amount of water and has the lowest metabolic rate among the members of the tribe.|$|E
5|$|Marine {{halfbeaks}} are omnivores {{feeding on}} algae; marine {{plants such as}} seagrasses; plankton; invertebrates such as pteropods and crustaceans; and smaller fishes. For some subtropical species at least, juveniles are more predatory <b>than</b> <b>adults.</b> Some tropical species feed on animals {{during the day and}} plants at night, while other species alternate between carnivory in the summer and herbivory in the winter. They are in turn eaten by many ecologically and commercially important fish, such as billfish, mackerel, and sharks, and so are a key link between trophic levels.|$|E
5|$|Nestlings, fledglings, and juveniles have brown plumage and pink-brown {{bills with}} shorter tails <b>than</b> <b>adults.</b> Young males develop blue tail {{feathers}} and darker bills by late summer or autumn (following a spring or summer breeding season), while young females develop light blue tails. By the subsequent spring, all males are fertile and have developed cloacal protuberances, which store sperm. In contrast, during the breeding season, fertile females develop oedematous brood patches, which are bare areas on their bellies.|$|E

50|$|Another major {{component}} of the ECM is hyaluronic acid (HA), a glycosaminoglycan. It is known that fetal skin contains more HA <b>than</b> <b>adult</b> skin due to the expression of more HA receptors. The expression of HA is known to down-regulate the recruitment of inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α); since fetal wounds contain a reduced number of pro-inflammatory mediators <b>than</b> <b>adult</b> wounds {{it is thought that}} the higher levels of HA in the fetal skin aid in scar free healing.|$|R
25|$|Pediatric aneurysms have {{different}} incidences and features <b>than</b> <b>adult</b> aneurysms. Intracranial aneurysms are rare in childhood, with over 95% of all aneurysms occurring in adults.|$|R
5|$|Reactive {{arthritis}} {{occurs in}} 1% of people following infections with Campylobacter species, and Guillain–Barré syndrome occurs in 0.1%. Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) may occur due to infection with Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli or Shigella species, causing low platelet counts, poor kidney function, and low {{red blood cell}} count (due to their breakdown). Children are more predisposed to getting HUS <b>than</b> <b>adults.</b> Some viral infections may produce benign infantile seizures.|$|E
5|$|Some affiliative {{behaviors}} are seasonal or gender-specific, {{such as the}} male squeal approach and anogenital inspections performed during the mating season. Another example is the female greeting behavior, where two females will use their anogenital scent glands to mark each other's backs, jump over one another, writhe together, and emit squealing vocalizations. This behavior is not seen during {{the end of the}} cool, dry season or around gestation. The frequency of other affiliative behaviors can be affected by age. All ruffed lemurs over five months of age allogroom, and, in captivity, subadults participate in play more frequently <b>than</b> <b>adults.</b>|$|E
5|$|The colour of C.maenas varies greatly, {{from green}} to brown, grey or red. This {{variation}} has a genetic component, but is {{largely due to}} local environmental factors. In particular, individuals which delay moulting become red–coloured rather than green. Red individuals are stronger and more aggressive, but are less tolerant of environmental stresses, such as low salinity or hypoxia. Juvenile crabs on average display greater patterning <b>than</b> <b>adults.</b>|$|E
50|$|Immature {{males and}} females are very similar in {{appearance}} to the adult female. However, immature males, much like adult non-breeding males, are slightly larger <b>than</b> <b>adult</b> females.|$|R

The nature of the progenitor cells from which these tumours arise, and their immature tissue environment, allows CSTs to develop with fewer defects in cell regulatory processes <b>than</b> <b>adult</b> cancers. These differences could explain why CSTs {{are more susceptible to}} therapeutic intervention <b>than</b> <b>adult</b> tumours.

5|$|The {{spinner shark}} is a fast, active swimmer that {{sometimes}} forms large schools, segregated {{by age and}} sex. Young individuals prefer cooler water temperatures <b>than</b> <b>adults.</b> Off South Africa, females are found close to shore year-round while males only appear during the summer. Smaller spinner sharks may be preyed upon by larger sharks. Known parasites of the spinner shark include the copepods Kroyeria deetsi, Nemesis pilosus, and N. atlantica, which infest the shark's gills, Alebion carchariae, which infests the skin, Nesippus orientalis, which infests the mouth and gill arches, and Perissopus dentatus, which infests the nares and the rear margins of the fins.|$|E
5|$|When some species, {{including}} Bathyctena chuni, Euplokamis stationis and Eurhamphaea vexilligera, are disturbed, {{they produce}} secretions (ink) that luminesce at {{much the same}} wavelengths as their bodies. Juveniles will luminesce more brightly {{in relation to their}} body size <b>than</b> <b>adults,</b> whose luminescence is diffused over their bodies. Detailed statistical investigation has not suggested the function of ctenophores' bioluminescence nor produced any correlation between its exact color and any aspect of the animals' environments, such as depth or whether they live in coastal or mid-ocean waters.|$|E
5|$|Young {{southern}} boobooks {{are usually}} paler <b>than</b> <b>adults,</b> {{and do not}} attain adult plumage properly until their third or fourth year. Juveniles (up to a year old) have whitish underparts and foreneck, a larger and more prominent pale eyebrow and larger whitish spots on their upperparts. The tips of their feathers are white and fluffy, remnants of the nestlings' down. These are worn away over time, persisting longest on the head. The feathers of the head, neck and underparts are fluffier overall. Immatures in their second and third year have plumage more like adults, though their crowns are paler and more heavily streaked.|$|E

40|$|AbstractXenopus laevis adults mount {{effective}} immune {{responses to}} ranavirus Frog Virus 3 (FV 3) infections and clear the pathogen within 2 – 3 weeks. In contrast, most tadpoles cannot clear FV 3 and succumb to infections within a month. While larval susceptibility has {{been attributed to}} ineffective adaptive immunity, the contribution of innate immune components has not been addressed. Accordingly, we performed a comprehensive gene expression analysis on FV 3 -infected tadpoles and adults. In comparison to adults, leukocytes and tissues of infected tadpoles exhibited modest (10 – 100 time lower <b>than</b> <b>adult)</b> and delayed (3 day later <b>than</b> <b>adult)</b> increase in expression of inflammation-associated (TNF-α, IL- 1 β and IFN-γ) and antiviral (Mx 1) genes. In contrast, these genes were readily and robustly upregulated in tadpoles upon bacterial stimulation. Furthermore, greater proportions of larval <b>than</b> <b>adult</b> PLs were infected by FV 3. Our study suggests that tadpole susceptibility to FV 3 infection is partially due to poor virus-elicited innate immune responses...|$|R
