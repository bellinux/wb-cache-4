5|$|The {{pipe organ}} is a musical {{instrument}} that produces sound by driving pressurized air (called wind) through organ pipes selected via a keyboard. Because each pipe produces a single pitch, the pipes are provided in sets called ranks, {{each of which has}} a common <b>timbre</b> and volume throughout the keyboard compass. Most organs have multiple ranks of pipes of differing <b>timbre,</b> pitch, and volume that the player can employ singly or in combination through the use of controls called stops.|$|E
5|$|Pipes are {{arranged}} by <b>timbre</b> and pitch into ranks. A rank {{is a set}} of pipes of the same <b>timbre</b> but multiple pitches (one for each note on the keyboard), which is mounted (usually vertically) onto a windchest. The stop mechanism admits air to each rank. For a given pipe to sound, the stop governing the pipe's rank must be engaged, and the key corresponding to its pitch must be depressed. Ranks of pipes are organized into groups called divisions. Each division generally is played from its own keyboard and conceptually comprises an individual instrument within the organ.|$|E

2500|$|The West's {{progressive}} {{embrace of}} increasingly dissonant intervals occurred almost entirely {{within the context}} of harmonic <b>timbres,</b> as produced by vibrating strings and columns of air, on which the West's dominant musical instruments are based. By generalizing Helmholtz's notion of consonance (described above as the [...] "coincidence of partials") to embrace non-harmonic <b>timbres</b> and their related tunings, consonance has recently been [...] "emancipated" [...] from harmonic <b>timbres</b> and their related tunings ( [...] , , , [...] ). Using electronically controlled pseudo-harmonic <b>timbres,</b> rather than strictly harmonic acoustic <b>timbres,</b> provides tonality with new structural resources such as Dynamic tonality. These new resources provide musicians with an alternative to pursuing the musical uses of ever-higher partials of harmonic <b>timbres</b> and, in some people's minds, may resolve what Arnold Schoenberg described as the [...] "crisis of tonality" [...] ( [...] , [...] ).|$|R

5|$|He was {{introduced}} to music {{at the age of}} three when his parents offered him lessons in the electronic organ. After studying composition and arrangement at a vocational school, Nakano worked for Konami from 1991 to 1994, where he scored numerous arcade games. Nakano is noted for his ambient style and for using percussion, <b>timbre,</b> and rhythm in his compositions.|$|E
5|$|Leontovych {{arranged}} many Ukrainian folk songs, creating artistically independent choral compositions {{based on}} their melodies and lyrics. He followed the traditions of improvisation of Ukrainian kobzars, who would interpret every new strophe differently. He also employed humming and the variability in <b>timbre</b> of singers' voices as techniques in reaching a desired emotional or sensual effect.|$|E
5|$|Many guitar picks {{employ the}} Reuleaux triangle, as its shape {{combines}} a sharp point to provide strong articulation, {{with a wide}} tip to produce a warm <b>timbre.</b> Because all three points of the shape are usable, {{it is easier to}} orient and wears less quickly compared to a pick with a single tip.|$|E

50|$|One {{solution}} to the problem of temperament is to temper a <b>timbre's</b> partials to align with a tempered tuning's notes. The laws of physics make it difficult for acoustic instruments to temper their partials in real time, but acoustically-produced <b>timbres</b> can be tempered electronically in real time, and electronic music synthesis can be used to generate tempered <b>timbres</b> in real time, too.|$|R
50|$|Synthesizers {{that can}} combine n <b>timbres</b> {{together}} are called n voice multitimbral. For example, a synthesizer capable of playing eight voices or <b>timbres</b> {{at one time}} would be an eight voice multitimbral instrument.|$|R
5|$|One day I chanced {{to see a}} {{performance}} of the Bunraku puppet theater and was very surprised by it. It was in the tone quality, the <b>timbre,</b> of the futazao shamisen, the wide-necked shamisen used in Bunraku, that I first recognized the splendor of traditional Japanese music. I was very moved by it and I wondered why my attention had never been captured before by this Japanese music.|$|E
5|$|Organ pipes {{are divided}} into flue pipes and reed pipes {{according}} to their design and <b>timbre.</b> Flue pipes produce sound by forcing air through a fipple, {{like that of a}} recorder, whereas reed pipes produce sound via a beating reed, like that of a clarinet or saxophone.|$|E
5|$|In music, {{noise is}} {{variously}} described as unpitched, indeterminate, uncontrolled, loud, unmusical, or unwanted sound. Noise {{is an important}} component of the sound of the human voice and all musical instruments, particularly in unpitched percussion instruments and electric guitars (using distortion). Electronic instruments create various colours of noise. Traditional uses of noise are unrestricted, using all the frequencies associated with pitch and <b>timbre,</b> such as the white noise component of a drum roll on a snare drum, or the transients present in the prefix of the sounds of some organ pipes.|$|E

5|$|Many unpitched {{percussion}} instruments, {{such as the}} snare drum or maracas, {{make use}} of the presence of random sounds or noise to produce a sound without any perceived pitch. See <b>timbre.</b> Unpitched percussion is typically used to maintain a rhythm or to provide accents, and its sounds are unrelated to the melody and harmony of the music. Within the orchestra unpitched percussion is termed auxiliary percussion, and this subsection of the percussion section includes all unpitched instruments of the orchestra no matter how they are played, for example the pea whistle and siren.|$|E
5|$|Related to {{this use}} of resonance, Messiaen also {{composed}} music in which the lowest, or fundamental, note is combined with higher notes or chords played much more quietly. These higher notes, far from being perceived as conventional harmony, function as harmonics that alter the <b>timbre</b> of the fundamental note like mixture stops on a pipe organ. An example is {{the song of the}} golden oriole in Le loriot of the Catalogue d'oiseaux for solo piano (Example 4).|$|E
5|$|The Stage Synthesizer {{combines}} wavetables with analog oscillators and FM operators. Featuring {{filter and}} envelope controls, the Synth Section's <b>timbre</b> knob {{allows users to}} move through different sound groups. A number of programs are available to store sounds under three categories – Synth, Pad or Bass. The Synth also includes a 2-band EQ, a glide (portamento) function, and a unison function {{which is used to}} thicken the sound. The Synth Section is 16-note polyphonic.|$|E
40|$|National audienceMultidimensional scaling {{techniques}} {{are used to}} create a geometric representation of mental organization of perceptual or conceptual relations. In this study they are used to explore the perceptual structure among different <b>timbres</b> ("timbre space"). The distance between any two <b>timbres</b> corresponds to their degree of perceptual dissimilarity. 98 listeners, musicians ans nonmusicians of diverses nationalities, were asked to judge the degree of dissimilarity between allpairsof a set of 18 synthesized <b>timbres</b> equalized for pitch, loudness, and subjective duration. A multidimensional scaling analysis with theprogram CLASCAL revealed a space including three common dimensions shared by all <b>timbres</b> as well as a set of weights that indicate the existence of perceptual features specific to certain <b>timbres</b> ("specificities"). Two of these dimensions seem to represent qualitatively the "brightness" and "attack quality" of the tones. Classes of listeners were determined by from the correlational structure of the raw dissimilarity matrices and weights are computed for each class. There was no systematic difference between the five classes associated with the musical training of the subjects...|$|R

5|$|Accompanying {{the changes}} to <b>timbre</b> and volume was {{a shift in the}} typical pitch used to tune instruments. Instruments meant to play together, as in an orchestra, must be tuned to the same {{standard}} lest they produce audibly different sounds while playing the same notes. Beginning in 1762, the average concert pitch began rising from a low of 377 vibrations to a high of 457 in 1880 Vienna. Different regions, countries, and even instrument manufacturers preferred different standards, making orchestral collaboration a challenge. Despite even the efforts of two organized international summits attended by noted composers like Hector Berlioz, no standard could be agreed upon.|$|E
5|$|Each stop usually {{controls}} one rank of pipes, although mixtures and undulating stops (such as the Voix céleste) control multiple ranks. The name of {{the stop}} reflects not only the stop's <b>timbre</b> and construction, but also {{the style of the}} organ in which it resides. For example, the names on an organ built in the north German Baroque style generally will be derived from the German language, while the names of similar stops on an organ in the French Romantic style will usually be French. Most countries tend to use only their own languages for stop nomenclature. English-speaking nations as well as Japan are more receptive to foreign nomenclature. Stop names are not standardized: two otherwise identical stops from different organs may have different names.|$|E
5|$|Liquid helium {{is used in}} {{cryogenics}} (its {{largest single}} use, absorbing {{about a quarter of}} production), particularly in the cooling of superconducting magnets, with the main commercial application being in MRI scanners. Helium's other industrial uses—as a pressurizing and purge gas, as a protective atmosphere for arc welding and in processes such as growing crystals to make silicon wafers—account for half of the gas produced. A well-known but minor use is as a lifting gas in balloons and airships. As with any gas whose density differs from that of air, inhaling a small volume of helium temporarily changes the <b>timbre</b> and quality of the human voice. In scientific research, the behavior of the two fluid phases of helium-4 (heliumI and heliumII) is important to researchers studying quantum mechanics (in particular the property of superfluidity) and to those looking at the phenomena, such as superconductivity, produced in matter near absolute zero.|$|E

5|$|The fixed {{reed and}} fairly uniform {{diameter}} of the clarinet give the instrument an acoustical behavior approximating that of a cylindrical stopped pipe. Recorders use a tapered internal bore to overblow at the octave when the thumb/register hole is pinched open, while the clarinet, with its cylindrical bore, overblows at the 12th. Adjusting {{the angle of the}} bore taper controls the frequencies of the overblown notes (harmonics). Changing the mouthpiece's tip opening and the length of the reed changes aspects of the harmonic <b>timbre</b> or voice of the clarinet because this changes the speed of reed vibrations. Generally, the goal of the clarinetist when producing a sound is to make as much of the reed vibrate as possible, making the sound fuller, warmer, and potentially louder.|$|E
5|$|The {{influence}} of Olivier Messiaen on Takemitsu was already apparent {{in some of}} Takemitsu's earliest published works. By the time he composed Lento in Due Movimenti, (1950), Takemitsu had already come into possession of a copy of Messiaen's 8 Préludes (through Toshi Ichiyanagi), and the {{influence of}} Messiaen is clearly visible in the work, in the use of modes, the suspension of regular metre, and sensitivity to <b>timbre.</b> Throughout his career Takemitsu often made use of modes from which he derived his musical material, both melodic and harmonic among which Messiaen's modes of limited transposition to appear with some frequency. In particular, the use of the octatonic, (modeII, or the 8–28 collection), and modeVI (8–25) is particularly common. However, Takemitsu pointed out that he had used the octatonic collection in his music before ever coming across it in Messiaen's music.|$|E
5|$|The {{sound of}} speech can be {{analyzed}} into a combination of segmental and suprasegmental elements. The segmental elements are those that follow each other in sequences, which are usually represented by distinct letters in alphabetic scripts, such as the Roman script. In free flowing speech, there are no clear boundaries between one segment and the next, nor usually are there any audible pauses between words. Segments therefore are distinguished by their distinct sounds which {{are a result of}} their different articulations, and they can be either vowels or consonants. Suprasegmental phenomena encompass such elements as stress, phonation type, voice <b>timbre,</b> and prosody or intonation, all of which may have effects across multiple segments.|$|E
