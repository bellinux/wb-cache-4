5|$|Slow-tight {{inhibition}} {{occurs when}} the initial enzyme–inhibitor complex EI undergoes isomerisation to a second more tightly held complex, EI*, but the overall inhibition process is reversible. This manifests itself as slowly increasing enzyme inhibition. Under these conditions, traditional Michaelis–Menten kinetics give a false value for Ki, which is <b>time–dependent.</b> The true value of Ki can be obtained through more complex analysis of the on (kon) and off (koff) rate constants for inhibitor association. See irreversible inhibition below for more information.|$|E
5|$|The binding and {{inactivation}} {{steps of}} this reaction are investigated by incubating the enzyme with inhibitor and assaying {{the amount of}} activity remaining over time. The activity will be decreased in a <b>time-dependent</b> manner, usually following exponential decay. Fitting these data to a rate equation gives the rate of inactivation at this concentration of inhibitor. This is done at several different concentrations of inhibitor. If a reversible EI complex is involved the inactivation rate will be saturable and fitting this curve will give kinact and Ki.|$|E
25|$|The {{extension}} of BLFQ to the <b>time-dependent</b> regime, namely, <b>time-dependent</b> BLFQ (tBLFQ) is straightforward {{and is currently}} under active development. The goal of tBLFQ is to solve light-front field theory in real-time (with or without <b>time-dependent</b> background fields). The typical application areas include intense lasers (see Light-front quantization#Intense lasers}) and relativistic heavy-ion collisions.|$|E

25|$|Turbulence is the <b>time-dependent</b> chaotic {{behavior}} seen in many fluid flows. It {{is generally}} {{believed that it}} {{is due to the}} inertia of the fluid as a whole: the culmination of <b>time-dependent</b> and convective acceleration; hence flows where inertial effects are small tend to be laminar (the Reynolds number quantifies how much the flow is affected by inertia). It is believed, though not known with certainty, that the Navier–Stokes equations describe turbulence properly.|$|E
25|$|When {{subjected}} to a step constant stress, viscoelastic materials experience a <b>time-dependent</b> increase in strain. This phenomenon is known as viscoelastic creep.|$|E
25|$|Magueijo's {{proposal}} used {{a different}} set of units, a choice which he justifies with the claim that some equations will be simpler in these new units. In the new units he fixes the fine structure constant, a quantity which some people, using units in which the speed of light is fixed, have claimed is <b>time-dependent.</b> Thus in the system of units in which the fine structure constant is fixed, the observational claim is that the speed of light is <b>time-dependent.</b>|$|E
25|$|Once the {{electronic}} and nuclear variables are separated (within the Born–Oppenheimer representation), in the <b>time-dependent</b> approach, the wave packet {{corresponding to the}} nuclear degrees of freedom is propagated via the time evolution operator (physics) associated to the <b>time-dependent</b> Schrödinger equation (for the full molecular Hamiltonian). In the complementary energy-dependent approach, the time-independent Schrödinger equation is solved using the scattering theory formalism. The potential representing the interatomic interaction is given by the potential energy surfaces. In general, the potential energy surfaces are coupled via the vibronic coupling terms.|$|E

25|$|Molecular {{dynamics}} (MD) {{use either}} quantum mechanics, Newton's laws of motion or a mixed model {{to examine the}} <b>time-dependent</b> behavior of systems, including vibrations or Brownian motion and reactions. MD combined with density functional theory leads to hybrid models.|$|E
25|$|The {{fact that}} the {{integration}} is performed along the entire positive real line might signify that the gamma function describes the cumulation of a <b>time-dependent</b> process that continues indefinitely, or the value might be the total of a distribution in an infinite space.|$|E
25|$|Aluminium isopropoxide is the {{chemical}} compound usually described with the formula Al(O-i-Pr)3, where i-Pr is the isopropyl group (CH(CH3)2).

25|$|The {{first proof}} of this theorem was given by Max Born and Vladimir Fock, in Zeitschrift für Physik 51, 165 (1928).

25|$|Accurately {{computing}} {{the rate}} of Lyman- escape {{and the effect of}} these photons on the 2s-1s transition. This requires solving a <b>time-dependent</b> radiative transfer equation. In addition, one needs to account for higher-order Lyman transitions. These refinements effectively amount to a modification of Peebles' C factor.|$|E
25|$|Here, u(t) is {{an input}} signal and y(t) an output signal. The vector x {{represents}} {{a set of}} n state variables describing the different internal memory states of the device. ẋ is the <b>time-dependent</b> rate of change of the state vector x with time.|$|E
25|$|The {{left side}} of the {{equation}} describes acceleration, and may be composed of <b>time-dependent</b> and convective components (also the effects of non-inertial coordinates if present). The right side of the equation is in effect a summation of body forces (such as gravity), hydrostatic effects, and divergence of deviatoric stress.|$|E
25|$|Dipole {{moments in}} {{molecules}} {{are responsible for}} the behavior of a substance in the presence of external electric fields. The dipoles tend to be aligned to the external field which can be constant or <b>time-dependent.</b> This effect forms the basis of a modern experimental technique called dielectric spectroscopy.|$|E

Bogan, in 2002, {{published}} the derivation of a reciprocal transformation from the Hamilton-Jacobi equation of classical mechanics to the <b>time-dependent</b> Schrödinger equation {{of quantum mechanics}} which arises from a gauge transformation representing spin, under the simple requirement of conservation of probability.

25|$|A {{significant}} {{feature of}} the Cauchy equation and consequently all other continuum equations (including Euler and Navier–Stokes) {{is the presence of}} convective acceleration: the effect of acceleration of a flow with respect to space. While individual fluid particles indeed experience <b>time-dependent</b> acceleration, the convective acceleration of the flow field is a spatial effect, one example being fluid speeding up in a nozzle.|$|E

While the cylindrical contact homology is well-defined and given by the symplectic Floer homologies of powers of the symplectomorphism, (rational) symplectic field theory and contact homology {{can be considered as}} generalized symplectic Floer homologies. In the important case when the symplectomorphism is the time-one map of a <b>time-dependent</b> Hamiltonian, it was however shown that these higher invariants do not contain any further information.|$|E
500|$|The {{treatment}} of turbulent boundary layers {{is far more}} difficult due to the <b>time-dependent</b> variation of the flow properties.

2500|$|These {{are used}} to produce both time-independent and <b>time-dependent</b> {{forecasts}} of earthquake probabilities. [...] The former are based on [...] "stress-renewal" [...] models of seismic stress being released by an earthquake, then renewing (or rebounding; see Elastic-rebound theory) until it triggers another earthquake. In <b>time-dependent</b> models {{the probability of a}} fault rupturing thus depends on how long stress has been accumulating since the last rupture. However, the details of how this happens are not adequately known, so <b>time-dependent</b> methods estimate the periodicity and currently accumulated strain based on observed seismicity. [...] Out of this a time-independent earthquake rate model (ERM) is produced, from which the <b>time-dependent</b> probability model (UCERF) is derived.
