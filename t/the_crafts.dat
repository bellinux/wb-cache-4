5|$|While both {{hunting and}} fishing were common, the peasants mostly hunted to protect their herds and crops. Apiculture, the keeping of bees, was as highly {{developed}} in Byzantium {{as it had been}} in Ancient Greece. Aside from agriculture, the peasants also laboured in <b>the</b> <b>crafts,</b> fiscal inventories mentioning smiths (Greek: χαλκεύς, chalkeus), tailors (Greek: ράπτης, rhaptes), and cobblers (Greek: τζαγγάριος, tzangarios).|$|E
5|$|Bangui’s artisans’ {{market has}} {{traditional}} wares representing the art products from {{different regions of}} the country. Handicrafts include woven mats and baskets, wooden utensils of simple design, carved stools, pottery, musical instruments, tanned skins, and wood products. The balafon, similar to a xylophone, is made out of the horns of animals. Innovative designs include butterfly wings stuck with gum on paper, and ebony and hardwood carvings of wood from the tropical region. Artwork also covers carved animals and human figures. <b>The</b> <b>crafts</b> center in Bangui provides training to about 100 students in artistic crafting in leather, ivory and ebony wares.|$|E

5|$|Swords are {{included}} in <b>the</b> <b>crafts</b> category, and either the sword itself or a sword mounting is designated as a National Treasure. Currently 110 swords and 12 sword mountings are National Treasures. The oldest designated properties date to the seventh century (Asuka period). However, 86 of the items are from the Kamakura period, with the most recent object from the Muromachi period. The designated items are located in Buddhist temples, Shinto shrines, museums, and private collections.|$|E

5|$|The Claremont Chapel was at No.44a Pentonville Road. It {{was named}} after Claremont House, home of the then-recently {{deceased}} Princess Charlotte Augusta of Wales. The chapel was designed by Thomas Wilson, who acquired the 2 acre site in 1818 for £700, spending an additional £6,000 on building works. It opened in October 1819, though a regular pastor was not appointed until 1822. The building was extended in 1847 to accommodate a Sunday school, while sash windows were installed in 1853. In 1860, the building was refurbished and given a Classical facade, but reducing {{the capacity of the}} inside gallery. Attendance declined and the chapel was sold to the London Congregational Union, before closing in 1899. It re-opened in 1902 as Claremont Hall, a mission institute. It was let for commercial purposes in the 1960s, and sub-let to <b>the</b> <b>Crafts</b> Council in 1991. The building is now <b>the</b> <b>Crafts</b> Council Gallery, a public gallery funded by the Arts Council England. It contains a number of exhibition rooms that are available for use.|$|E

50|$|The {{unmanned}} spacecraft was destroyed on its third orbit around Earth. Two ground control stations, one in Klyuchi {{and the other}} in Yelisovo, sent simultaneous commands instructing <b>the</b> <b>craft</b> to depressurize its airlock. <b>The</b> <b>craft</b> interpreted this as an order to begin descent and a propulsion error put <b>the</b> <b>craft</b> into a tumble. Approximately twenty-nine minutes later <b>the</b> <b>craft's</b> automatic self-destruct function activated. <b>The</b> <b>craft</b> was completely destroyed to prevent sensitive information from literally falling into enemy hands. Over 100 pieces of the spacecraft were tracked, falling into the ocean between 31 March and 6 April 1965.|$|R

5|$|After the Fatimid caliphs {{moved to}} Egypt, el-Mansuriya {{remained}} {{the capital of}} the Zirids, who became the local rulers, for the next eighty-five years. The Zirid ruler el-Mansur bin Buluqqin built a palace for himself at el-Mansuriya. There is a record of the lavish marriage in 1022-23 of his grandson, the young Zirid el-Muizz bin Badis. Pavilions were built outside the city, a large array of textiles and manufactured good was displayed and music was provided by a great number of instruments. El-Muizz bin Badis, who ruled Ifriqiya under the Fatimids from 1015 to 1062, rebuilt the Kairouan city wall and built two walls {{on either side of the}} road from Kairouan to el-Mansuriya. He ordered the transfer to el-Mansuriya of <b>the</b> <b>crafts</b> and commerce from Kairouan.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological finds {{from the}} Carpathian Basin provide {{evidence}} of <b>the</b> <b>crafts</b> practiced by the Magyars. 10th-century warriors' graves yielding sabres, arrow-heads, spear-heads, stirrups, and snaffle bits made of iron show that blacksmiths had a pre-eminent role in the militarized Magyar society. Engraved or gilded sabres and sabretache platesoften decorated with precious stonesand golden or silver pectoral disks evidence {{the high levels of}} skills of Magyar gold- and silversmiths. Cemeteries in the Carpathian Basin also yielded scraps of canvas made of flax or hemp. The positioning of metal buttons in the graves shows the Magyars wore clothes that either opened down the front or were fastened at the neck. Ear-rings were the only accessories worn above the belt by Magyar warriors; jewelry on their upper bodies would have hindered them from firing arrows. In contrast, Magyar women wore head jewelry decorated with leaf-like pendants, ear-rings, decorated pectoral disks, and rings with gemstones.|$|E
50|$|An {{effective}} ornithopter {{must have}} wings capable of generating both thrust, {{the force that}} propels <b>the</b> <b>craft</b> forward, and lift, the force (perpendicular to the direction of flight) that keeps <b>the</b> <b>craft</b> airborne. These forces must {{be strong enough to}} counter the effects of drag and the weight of <b>the</b> <b>craft.</b>|$|R

5|$|Aside {{from the}} usual {{tactical}} aspects of racing, Wipeout 2097 (unlike its predecessor) offered the chance to eliminate other drivers from the competition by destroying their craft with weapons. Each craft has a shield energy quota, and when this quota reaches zero—either from damage sustained from weapon attacks, or impact from other craft or {{the edges of the}} circuit—the craft blows up. The craft also blows up if the time limit is reached, though this only applies to human players. The biggest weapon introduced in 2097 was the Quake Disruptor, which has been a series hallmark ever since. This weapon causes a quake to thrust a destructive wave down the track that dunks <b>the</b> <b>crafts</b> it smash into.|$|E
5|$|The {{culture of}} the 15th century Poland can be {{described}} as retaining typical medieval characteristics. Nonetheless, <b>the</b> <b>crafts</b> and industries in existence already in the preceding centuries became more highly developed under favorable social and economic conditions, and their products were much more widely disseminated. Paper production was one of the new industries that appeared, and printing developed during {{the last quarter of the}} century. In 1473, Kasper Straube produced the first Latin print in Kraków, whereas Kasper Elyan printed Polish texts for the first time in Wrocław (Breslau) in 1475. The world's oldest prints in Cyrillic script, namely religious texts in Old Church Slavonic, appeared after 1490 from the press of Schweipolt Fiol in Krakow.|$|E
5|$|The game {{features}} two distinctive {{modes of}} play - a single player campaign and multiplayer matches. In both modes, players {{are put into}} a first-person perspective from within the cockpit of a starfighter and have full control over their craft, but the only visible part is the interface - the head-up display (HUD) - which can be customised with different colours and by what information is displayed. Outside of these modes, the main menu {{of the game is}} designed around the interior of a ship's quarterdeck, with various elements (mostly doors) leading to different options, such as starting a new game, configuring the game, reviewing <b>the</b> <b>crafts</b> featured in the game and various story elements, and replaying completed single player missions.|$|E
50|$|While {{the lander}} was {{stationary}} on the launchpad, moving the mouse (which would normally tilt {{the attitude of}} <b>the</b> <b>craft)</b> would cause it to immediately explode. This bug was fixed in Virus: <b>the</b> <b>craft</b> would not explode while sitting on the launchpad, but only if a landing were attempted while <b>the</b> <b>craft</b> was not level.|$|R
50|$|During space flight, a craft's {{attitude}} must {{be controlled}} for reasons dependent upon <b>the</b> <b>craft's</b> mission. Keeping a spacecraft slewed properly is vital toward ensuring that its high-gain antenna remains oriented toward Earth for sending and receiving data and commands. Additionally with many craft, keeping their solar arrays angled toward the Sun optimizes their power absorption and reduces <b>the</b> <b>craft's</b> reliance on internal power systems. Thermal {{heating and cooling}} of a craft and its subsystems can also be controlled by <b>the</b> <b>craft's</b> orientation. Cameras or other sensing equipment that are fixed into position upon <b>the</b> <b>craft</b> need to be aimed by slewing <b>the</b> <b>craft.</b> A spacecraft can either be spin stabilized or 3-axis stabilized to maintain proper orientation.|$|R

5|$|Vehicles also {{received}} digital enhancement. For {{the scene in}} which the Expendables crash their Canadair CL-215 amphibious plane into a cave, the effects team intended to use Miniature effects, filming using a 1/3 scale model of the 90-feet wing span plane. Production constraints and the limited shooting schedule meant the miniature shoot was abandoned and the entire sequence was rendered digitally. The plane itself was also digitally modified, adding a nose mounted gun which in practice could have stalled the engine with its recoil. A rear hatch door was required for jet skis to drive into the plane but <b>the</b> <b>crafts</b> design made such a door impractical; visual trickery was used to obscure this fact and make the door fit into the existing plane design. A helicopter used in the opening sequence was required to perform more dynamic moves {{and so it was}} digitally removed entirely and replaced with a digital recreation that better fit the scene's requirements. The helicopter which decapitates Hector during his fight with Christmas had no rotors and they were digitally added. WWFX later enhanced it more, modifying lighting and stabilizing the helicopter's body which shook unnaturally when struck during the fight. The Sangs Mi-8 helicopter was a civilian variant, but it was digitally replaced with the gunship variant, the Hip-E, to make it look meaner and more fitting for Van Damme's villainous mercenary, with a black reflective coating and armaments. The T-72 tank used to assault the Expendables would have devastated the set with the resulting concussive wave if it had fired a single shot, so it was replaced in most shots with a digital version that performed the shooting.|$|E

5000|$|... 2. SteeringBy {{dragging}} the quant {{at an angle}} behind the barge or punt upon <b>the</b> water, <b>the</b> <b>craft</b> {{can be made to}} turn. <b>The</b> <b>craft</b> will slow on the side on which the quant is in the water, so <b>the</b> <b>craft</b> will move in that direction. The greater the angle made between the quant and the barge or punt, the greater the turning angle. This effect can be enhanced (greater turning force), by pushing the quant forward through the water on the desired direction side of <b>the</b> <b>craft.</b> Alternatively, placing <b>the</b> quant such that there is an angle between the direction of motion and the line of the quant itself will push the rear of <b>the</b> <b>craft</b> away from <b>the</b> planted end of the quant, and so enable changes of direction.
