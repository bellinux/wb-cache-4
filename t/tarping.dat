25|$|Truck drivers often {{spend their}} nights parked at a truck stop, rest area, {{or on the}} {{shoulder}} of a freeway ramp. Sometimes these are in secluded areas or dangerous neighborhoods, which account for a number of deaths due to drivers being targeted by thieves for their valuable cargo, money, and property, or for the truck and trailer themselves. Drivers of trucks towing flatbed trailers are responsible for securing and strapping down their cargo (which often involves climbing onto the cargo itself), and if the load requires <b>tarping</b> necessitates climbing on the load to spread out tarps. Tarps can weigh up to 200lbs each and the cargo can require up to 3 tarps per load which account for a number of deaths and injuries from falling. Drivers spend long hours behind the wheel, which can cause strain on the back muscles. Some drivers are responsible for unloading their cargo, which can lead to many back strains and sprains due to overexertion and improper lifting techniques. If the cab of the truck is not appropriate for the driver's size, the driver can lose visibility and easy access to the controls and be at higher risk for accidents.|$|E

40|$|SummaryA {{family of}} transmembrane AMPA {{receptor}} regulatory proteins (<b>TARPs)</b> profoundly affects the trafficking and gating of AMPA receptors (AMPARs). Although <b>TARP</b> subtypes are differentially expressed throughout the CNS, {{it is unclear}} whether this imparts functional diversity to AMPARs in distinct neuronal populations. Here, we examine the effects of each <b>TARP</b> subtype on the kinetics of AMPAR gating in heterologous cells and in neurons. We report a striking heterogeneity in the effects of <b>TARP</b> subtypes on AMPAR deactivation and desensitization, which we demonstrate controls the time course of synaptic transmission. In addition, we find that some <b>TARP</b> subtypes dramatically slow AMPAR activation kinetics. Synaptic AMPAR kinetics also depend on <b>TARP</b> expression level, suggesting a variable TARP/AMPAR stoichiometry. Analysis of quantal synaptic transmission in a <b>TARP</b> γ- 4 knockout (KO) mouse corroborates our expression data and demonstrates that <b>TARP</b> subtype-specific gating of AMPARs contributes to the kinetics of native AMPARs at central synapses...|$|R

40|$|AbstractHeterogeneity among AMPA {{receptor}} (AMPAR) subtypes {{is thought}} {{to be one of the}} key postsynaptic factors giving rise to diversity in excitatory synaptic signaling in the CNS. Recently, compelling evidence has emerged that ancillary AMPAR subunits—the so-called transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory proteins (<b>TARPs)</b> —also play a vital role in influencing the variety of postsynaptic signaling. This <b>TARP</b> family of molecules controls both trafficking and functional properties of AMPARs at most, if not all, excitatory central synapses. Furthermore, individual <b>TARPs</b> differ in their effects on the biophysical and pharmacological properties of AMPARs. The critical importance of <b>TARPs</b> in synaptic transmission was first revealed in experiments on cerebellar granule cells from stargazer mice. These lack the prototypic <b>TARP</b> stargazin, present in granule cells from wild-type animals, and consequently lack synaptic transmission at the mossy fibre-to-granule cell synapse. Subsequent work has identified many other members of the stargazin family which act as functional <b>TARPs.</b> It has also provided valuable information about specific <b>TARPs</b> present in many central neurons. Because much of the initial work on <b>TARPs</b> was carried out on stargazer granule cells, the important functional properties of <b>TARPs</b> present throughout the cerebellum have received particular attention. Here we discuss some of these recent findings in relation to the main <b>TARPs</b> and the AMPAR subunits identified in cerebellar neurons and glia...|$|R

40|$|Plastic {{films are}} {{commonly}} used to tarp the soil surface to reduce fumigant volatilization losses.

40|$|An {{evaluation}} {{was made}} of soil solarization to control Macrophomina phaseolina and Sclerotium rolfsii under the climatic conditions of the Sonoran Desert region of Arizona. <b>Tarping</b> of moist soil with clear polyethylene in the summer was most effective in raising soil temperatures, while <b>tarping</b> during the fall and spring were less efficient. In one summer trial, the maximum temperatures achieved were 7 - 8 C higher than control plots at 1, 15, and 30 cm depths. In none of the tests was the application of tarp effective in reducing M. phaseolina populations to non-detectable levels. After a six-week summer solarization treatment, S. rolfsii was controlled at the 15 -cm but not the 30 -cm depth. During a fall treatment control of S. rolfsii was achieved only at the 1 -cm depth. After solarization, seeds of Euphorbia lathyris were planted in solarized and control plots. The incidence of M. phaseolina-associated mortality among seedlings planted in solarized plots {{was always the same}} as the control plot with the highest disease incidence.

40|$|The {{number of}} AMPA-type {{glutamate}} receptors (AMPARs) at synapses {{is the major}} determinant of synaptic strength and varies from synapse to synapse. To clarify the underlying molecular mechanisms, the density of AMPARs, PSD- 95, and transmembrane AMPAR regulatory proteins (<b>TARPs)</b> were compared at Schaffer collateral/commissural (SCC) synapses in the adult mouse hippocampal CA 1 by quantitative immunogold electron microscopy using serial sections. We examined four types of SCC synapses: perforated and nonperforated synapses on pyramidal cells and axodendritic synapses on parvalbumin-positive (PV synapse) and pravalbumin-negative interneurons (non-PV synapse). SCC synapses were categorized into those expressing high-density (perforated and PV synapses) or low-density (nonperforated and non-PV synapses) AMPARs. Although the density of PSD- 95 labeling was fairly constant, the density and composition of <b>TARP</b> isoforms was highly variable depending on the synapse type. Of the three <b>TARPs</b> expressed in hippocampal neurons, the disparity in <b>TARP</b> γ- 2 labeling was closely related to that of AMPAR labeling. Importantly, AMPAR density was significantly reduced at perforated and PV synapses in <b>TARP</b> γ- 2 -knock-out (KO) mice, resulting in a virtual loss of AMPAR disparity among SCC synapses. In comparison, <b>TARP</b> γ- 8 was the only <b>TARP</b> expressed at nonperforated synapses, where AMPAR labeling further decreased to a background level in <b>TARP</b> γ- 8 -KO mice. These results show that synaptic inclusion of <b>TARP</b> γ- 2 potently increases AMPAR expression and transforms low-density synapses into high-density ones, whereas <b>TARP</b> γ- 8 is essential for low-density or basal expression of AMPARs at nonperforated synapses.
