Hands should be rubbed {{together}} with digits interlocking. If there is debris under fingernails, a bristle brush may be used to remove it. Since germs may remain in the water on the hands, it is important to rinse well and wipe dry with a clean towel. After drying, the paper towel should be used to turn off the water (and open any exit door if necessary). This avoids re-contaminating the hands from those surfaces.|$|E

50|$|A hard {{shaving soap}} is {{used with a}} shaving brush <b>to</b> create <b>lather</b> for shaving. For soap {{in the form of}} a puck or bar, the brush is first soaked in water and then swirled vigorously over the surface of the soap, causing moist soap to coat the brush's bristles. The brush is then {{transferred}} either to a separate bowl or to the shaver's face <b>to</b> be <b>lathered.</b>|$|R

60|$|He arose as {{sharply from}} the chair, and, without a word, {{went to the}} sink. It was a greasy, filthy sink. A smell came up from the outlet. He took no notice of it. That a sink should smell was to him {{part of the natural}} order, just as it {{was a part of the}} natural order that the soap should be grimy with dish-water and hard <b>to</b> <b>lather.</b> Nor did he try very hard to make it lather. Several {{splashes}} of the cold water from the running faucet completed the function. He did not wash his teeth. For that matter he had never seen a toothbrush, nor did he know that there existed beings in the world who were guilty of so great a foolishness as tooth washing.|$|E

I said meekly that I {{was in a}} hurry, and it affected him as strongly {{as if he had}} never heard it. He shoved up my head, and put a napkin under it. He plowed his fingers into my collar and fixed a towel there. He explored my hair with his claws and suggested that it needed trimming. I said I did not want it trimmed. He explored again and said it was pretty long for the present style--better have a little taken off; it needed it behind especially. I said I had had it cut only a week before. He yearned over it reflectively a moment, and then asked with a disparaging manner, who cut it? I came back at him promptly with a [...] "You did!" [...] I had him there. Then he fell to stirring up his lather and regarding himself in the glass, stopping now and then to get close and examine his chin critically or inspect a pimple. Then he lathered one side of my face thoroughly, and was about <b>to</b> <b>lather</b> the other, when a dog-fight attracted his attention, and he ran to the window and stayed and saw it out, losing two shillings on the result in bets with the other barbers, a thing which gave me great satisfaction. He finished lathering, and then began to rub in the suds with his hand.|$|E

50|$|Coconut oil is an {{important}} base ingredient for the manufacture of soap. Soap made with coconut oil tends to be hard, though it retains more water than soap made with other oils and therefore increases manufacturer yields. It is more soluble in hard water and salt water than other soaps allowing it <b>to</b> <b>lather</b> more easily. A basic coconut oil soap is clear when melted and a bright white when hardened.|$|E
50|$|Zappa {{managed to}} get an {{agreement}} with Phonogram Inc. <b>to</b> release <b>Läther</b> in its original configuration, and test pressings were made targeted at a Halloween 1977 release, but Warner Bros. prevented the release by claiming rights over the material. Zappa responded by appearing on the Pasadena, California radio station KROQ, allowing them <b>to</b> broadcast <b>Läther</b> and encouraging listeners {{to make their own}} tape recordings. After Warner Bros. censored Zappa in New York to remove references to Angel guitarist Punky Meadows, and demanding four additional albums, a lawsuit between Zappa and Warner Bros. followed, during which no Zappa material was released for more than a year. Eventually, Warner Bros. issued Studio Tan, Sleep Dirt and Orchestral Favorites. The original cover artwork had featured a photograph of Zappa in blackface and holding a mop; this photograph was eventually used as the cover for Joe's Garage, Act I.|$|R
