Understanding reasons why patients STF and what proportion of LTF patients constitute this silent transfer phenomenon is necessary to ensure patient continuity of care. We attempted to identify STF patients using the routine government electronic monitoring systems. Furthermore, we sought to identify potential reasons for the STF phenomenon through patient surveys and healthcare provider interviews, in order to guide policy and improve programmatic outcomes. In this mixed methods approach, we selected patients identified as LTF between 2008 - 2012 in three health facilities from Khayelitsha, Western Cape. Identified patients were subsequently searched for using a combined provincial patient data set. Once consent was obtained, sampling of patients and healthcare providers, using convenience and snowballing methods respectively, were selected for participation. Ninety percent of patients believe it necessary to inform facility staff of the <b>intent</b> to <b>transfer,</b> 56 % of patients interviewed cited fear of negative attitudes from staff regarding transfer request (65 %), family situations (30 %), and long waiting times (11 %) as contributing factors to silently transferring care between facilities. Healthcare providers cited stigma, family obligations and/or support, and migration to the Eastern Cape as main reasons for patients transferring. Healthcare providers cited incomplete or lack of transfer documentation as the biggest barrier to timeous treatment of the transfer patient.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{predictors}} and pre-transfer navigation experiences of community college students enrolled in Associate of Arts (AA), Associate in Science (AS), or Associate in Applied Science (AAS) degrees with <b>transfer</b> <b>intent</b> to Florida’s public universities. The population included adult students aged 26 and above enrolled in Florida state/community college AA, AS, or AAS programs. One hundred and seventy-five students from two community colleges participated in this study with a response rate of 10 %. The valid data set included 101 respondents, AA (n = 17), AS (n = 76), AAS (n = 4), other (n = 4), and missing degree (n = 1). There were more females (n = 75, 74. 3 %) than males (n = 26, 25. 7 %) who participated in this study. The students had a mean age of 34. 09 years. Most respondents (total = 89. 6 %) reported having an <b>intent</b> to <b>transfer</b> to a 4 -year public or private university. Data were collected using the STEM Student Success Literacy Survey (SSLS), a 63 -item questionnaire launched and administered via Qualtrics. The purpose of the instrument was to measure Community College Students Self-Efficacy, Social Capital, and Transfer Knowledge. The SSLS was adapted to a 66 -item questionnaire to include new items regarding transfer experiences, navigation experiences, and <b>intent</b> to <b>transfer.</b> Results indicated that adult students enrolled in non-transfer degree programs had <b>intent</b> to <b>transfer</b> to a four-year college.

5000|$|Wrongfulness {{of intent}} also may vary the {{seriousness}} of an offense and possibly reduce the punishment {{but this is not}} always the case.

40|$|To modify {{product design}} easily, modern CAD systems adopt the feature-based model {{as their primary}} representation. On the other hand, the {{boundary}} representation (B-rep) model is used as their secondary representation. IGES and STEP AP 203 edition 1 are the representative standard formats for the exchange of CAD files. Unfortunately, both of them only support the B-rep model. As a result, feature data are lost during the CAD file exchange based on these stan-dards. Loss of feature data causes the difficulty of CAD model modification and prevents the <b>transfer</b> of design <b>intent.</b> To resolve this problem, a tool for recognizing design features from a B-rep model and then reconstructing a feature-based model with the recognized features should be developed.

5000|$|The key {{difference}} between intentional torts and negligent torts {{is that the}} plaintiff must prove the additional element that the defendant acted with the specific intent to perform (i.e., acted with a mental state of intentionally performing) the act that was the proximate cause of the plaintiff's injuries (so-called malice). [...] "The concept of 'intention' in the intentional torts does not require that defendants know that their acts will result in harm to the plaintiffs.

50|$|Recklessness {{is not a}} {{sufficient}} mens rea. That means that the defendant must have decided to bring about, so far as lay within their powers, the commission of the full offense. However, <b>transferred</b> <b>intent</b> applies so that if Alice intends to murder Bob with a gun, but the shot accidentally misses and kills Carol, then Alice is guilty {{of the murder of}} Carol and the attempted murder of Bob. Alternatively, if Alice intends merely to frighten Bob, and that same shot intentionally misses Bob but accidentally kills Carol, Alice may be guilty of assaulting Bob (among other things), but not attempted murder, unless Alice intended that such fright would kill Bob. Whether Alice would be guilty of murdering Carol would depend on the specific circumstances and what Alice foresaw. The punishment for an attempt is often tied to that of the intended offense (e.g., half the fine, or half the prison time).|$|E
5000|$|In US {{criminal}} law, <b>transferred</b> <b>intent</b> {{is sometimes}} explained {{by stating that}} [...] "the intent follows the bullet." [...] That is, the intent to kill person A with a bullet will apply even when the bullet kills the unintended victim, person B (see mens rea). Thus, the intent is transferred between victims. However, intent only transfers between harms of a similar nature. [...] For example, if the defendant shoots at [...] "Person A" [...] intending to kill [...] "A" [...] but the bullet misses and instead hits a vase, causing it to break, the defendant is not deemed to have intended to break the vase. This is because destruction of property {{is a kind of}} harm different from that contemplated by defendant. The rationale underlying this distinction is that the defendant has only one intent. If the law were to deem that the defendant intended to destroy property, it would be placing on him an intent he never had—he would now have both the intent to kill and the intent to destroy property. In contrast, where the defendant intends to kill one person but ends up killing another, there's still only one intent—the intent to kill.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, the &quot;Activity Chain Model&quot;, a {{new design}} {{information}} model {{necessary for the}} knowledge medium which realizes &quot;Global Design &quot; is proposed. In order to realize &quot;Global Design&quot;, the knowledge medium must provide both intent-capturing and intent-explanation capabilities sufficiently. To provide these capabilities, the &quot;Activity Chain Model &quot; not only integrates both the product and the process based on the activity description, but also introduces a chained structure into the activity. Consequently, this model exceeds the capabilities of conventional media {{in terms of the}} range and methods of handling information. For example, this model can capture design process information, including design intent, according to the level of detail of the process information, and the designer's input overhead can be mitigated. The authors implement the model in a computer system called &quot;POET Knowledge Medium&quot;. From the results of the evaluation of the &quot;POET Knowledge Medium &quot; through design simulation, the effectiveness of the &quot;Activity Chain Model &quot; was confirmed, not only in the case of capturing and <b>transferring</b> the design <b>intent,</b> but also in reminding the designers themselves of the design process. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{preliminary}} excitation {{experiment was}} performed in the near ultraviolet on Gd 3 Sc 2 Ga 3 O 12 :Cr 3 +. The resulting excitation spectra, obtained by monitoring the Cr 3 + fluorescence while exciting the Gd 3 + ions, revealed efficient gadolinium to chromium energy <b>transfer.</b> The <b>intent</b> of this thesis investigation was to elucidate {{the nature of this}} energy transfer process. In the results presented here, we have measured the dynamics of this energy transfer process by pumping the 6 P 7 / 2 and 6 P 5 / 2 levels of the Gd 3 + with a frequency-doubled pulsed dye laser at 312 nm and 307 nm respectively. The resulting Cr 3 + fluorescence was detected using photon counting instrumentation, which yields time-dependent measurements with three orders of magnitude dynamic range. The rise time and decay time of the Cr 3 + fluorescence is exponential in character and the data was fit to N(t) =N e-t/Td(1 -e-t/Tr) where T d is the Cr 3 + decay time and T r is the rise time. The model is consistent with one where the Gd 3 + to Cr 3 + transfer is described by a single transfer rate indicating a single step transfer over a single fixed distance. The temperature dependence of the Gd 3 + to Cr 3 + transfer rate from 10 K to 300 K shows two distinct regions. At temperatures above 100 K the transfer rate increases linearly with temperature which is highly indicative of a one phonon-assisted transfer process. In the region below 100 K a much stronger temperature dependence is observed. The total energy transfer process is a rapid migration among the gadolinium ions followed by an energy transfer step to the chromium ions. The energy migration and transfer are both mediated by exchange interaction. In the temperature region above 100 K the Gd 3 + to Cr 3 + rate dominates the temperature dependence and in the region below 100 K the Gd 3 + to Gd 3 + transfer rate dominates. ^ The temperature dependence of the Gd 3 + to Cr 3 + energy transfer following excitation of the higher lying gadolinium 6 I manifolds was also measured. The transfer rate was temperature independent and significantly faster than the rates observed following excitation of the 6 P manifolds. ...|$|R
40|$|There is {{tremendous}} need in collaborative design {{today for the}} integration of heterogeneous CAx systems. This general practice has serious shortcomings like design discontinuity, limited parallelisation, loss of information, and conversion errors. To overcome these shortcomings, macro-parametric approach (MPA), which is a history-based method of parametric CAD model exchange, has been proposed. The macro-parametric approach {{is a way to}} achieve compatible CAD model exchange amongst a variety of mutually incompatible CAD systems. CAD models can be exchanged {{in the form of a}} macro file that comprises a sequence of modeling commands. A standard macro file that contains a set of event-driven commands can <b>transfer</b> the designer <b>intent</b> such as parameters, features and constraints. Currently, STEP (STandard for the Exchange of Product model data) as an international standard (ISO- 10303, Industrial automation systems and integration - Product data representation and exchange) for the computer-interpretable representation and the exchange of product model data is widely used. STEP is becoming the 'lingua franca' in the area of modelling and exchanging product data. One remaining problem of the using STEP as a neutral format is that it does not retain parametric information such as the designer intent but only the pure boundary representation (B-rep) of the CAD model. The B-rep model without parametric information presents difficulties for engineering changes and it may also lead to an unexpected distortion of shape. This research aims to investigate an exchange method that uses STEP/XML (extensible mark-up) technology to express a set of standard modeling commands extracted from CAD models created by Autodesk InventorTM, to enable the same CAD models are readable and shareable with other CAD application systems...|$|R
