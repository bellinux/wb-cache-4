40|$|The {{effect of}} a {{synthetically}} produced pheromone (PAP) on the well-being of pigs during transport to the slaughter house Even though numerous attempts to reduce stress during the transport of slaughter pigs, the losses due to transportation induced stress are between 0. 03 % and 0. 5 % in the EU and 0. 4 % in Germany. PSE is seen in 10 to 20 % of the animals. A naturally occurring pheromone is secreted by the mammary glands of the sow, which have a calming and stress reducing effect on the piglets {{as well as on}} adult pigs. In this placebo controlled double blind study, the possible stress and aggression reducing potential of the synthetically produced `Porcine Appeasing Pheromone (PAP) ´ (SSNA Sanofi Santé Nutrition Animale) was examined in slaughter pigs during their transport to the slaughter house and the possibility of improved meat quality. Eleven groups, each containing 24 pigs (n= 264 Pigs; Breed Pi x DL) weighing 102 ± 10. 6 kg were observed. Each group was transported in a livestock <b>trailer,</b> <b>traveling</b> the same route with the same driver for 40 to 45 minutes from the finishing barn to the slaughterhouse. Before and after the pigs were transported, a number of parameters were recorded. For the experiment, 6 ml of the PAP was sprayed along {{the back of the neck}} in five of the groups (n= 150 pigs) while in the other six groups (n= 144 pigs) a placebo was applied the same way. The cortisol level in the saliva of the live animals was determined in eight animals of each group (1. base level at the finishing barn, 2. after transport, 3. 30 minutes after arriving at the slaughter house in a holding pen). The animals‘ behavior was also observed using video surveillance in the holding pen for 25 minutes (scan sampling every 30 seconds). The heart rates of eight animals per group were recorded using a Polar® sport tester; the surface body temperature was measured using infrared thermography and the animals were weighed. Post mortem, the pH 1 and pH 24, the ability to conduct in the ham and in the chops were determined and the carcasses were examined for injuries due to fighting. In addition, the air humidity and ambient air temperature on the outside and inside of the livestock trailer was measured. The results show a definite stress- or transport-induced activation of the Hypothalamic-hypophyseal-adrenal axis (HPA) in all animals. A significant increase of the cortisol levels were evident in the saliva samples taken from all the pigs after transport versus the base level samples taken in the finishing barn. The animals treated with the pheromone had a significantly lower saliva cortisol concentration (p= 0. 02) compared to the pigs who were given the placebo (placebo 22. 55 ± 6, 4 nmol/l, pheromone 19, 15 ± 7, 26 nmol/l). Analyzing the heart rates revealed no significant difference between the two groups. The highest heart rates were reached during loading (170 - 173 bpm) and the rate slowly decreased to 118 - 120 bpm while in the holding pen. The severe strain the animals are under becomes evident when one looks at the high heart rates. The body temperature taken at the base of the ear also showed no significant difference between the control and PAP group. The base temperature, although dependent on the ambient air temperature and weather conditions, remained steady in its increase during transport on cold or warm days (4. 5 ± 2. 5 °C on cold and 4. 6 ± 1. 9 °C on warm days). Even the parameters weight loss and behavior showed no differences between the PAP group and the control group. The carcasses had few minor injuries, which were evenly spread between both groups. This can be attributed to the fact that the groups were transported individually by pens without mixing unfamiliar animals. On the other hand, the measurement pertaining to the quality of the meat did show a possible influence by the application of the PAP. The pH 1 in the longissimus dorsi muscle of the pheromone treated pigs is significantly higher 45 minutes after slaughter (p< 0, 01; placebo pH 1 = 6, 13 ± 0, 22; pheromone pH 1 = 6, 26 ± 0, 29) as well as the conductivity of the same muscle is significantly lower 24 hours post mortem (p< 0. 01; placebo conductivity= 7. 22 ± 2. 39; pheromone conductivity= 6. 32 ± 1. 83). An improvement in meat quality is also seen in the PAP-treated animals, which is based on defined meat properties for quality control. The placebo group had a higher percentage of animals under suspicion of having PSE or DFD meat. At the same time, greater carcass meat values and quality ratings of very good and good were seen in the PAP-treated pigs. The results of this study seem to point in the direction that `Porcine Appeasing Pheromone´ influences the physiological and physical state of pigs during transport in form of a stress reducer. This stress reducing effect is recognizable in the significantly lower saliva cortisol levels of the PAP animals after transport. A possible calming effect of PAP is probably not significant based on this data. Additionally, the stress reducing effect of the `Porcine Appeasing Pheromone´ leads to a reduced glycogenolysis in the muscle tissue and with that a lower muscle acidity which leads to a significantly higher pH 1 and a significantly lower conductivity of the longissimus dorsi muscle. The use of PAP, based on the results of this study, is an acceptable method to improve the well being of the pigs during transport, to reduce stress and additionally improve the quality of the meat. Further study is needed to examine and modify the duration and place (holding pen, room spray) of the PAP application. Trotz zahlreicher Versuche die Belastungen waehrend des Transportes von Schlachtschweinen zu reduzieren, liegen die Verluste auf Grund des Transportstresses in der EU bei 0, 03 bis 0, 5 % und in Deutschland bei 0, 4 % verstorbener Tiere sowie bei einer PSE-Rate von 10 bis 20 %. Natuerlicherweise wird von der Muttersau ueber Druesen der Gesaeugeleiste ein Pheromon sezerniert, welches einen beruhigenden und stressreduzierenden Effekt auf Ferkel aber auch adulte Tiere hat. In dieser Placebokontrollierten DoppelblindStudie sollte eine moegliche stress- und aggressionsreduzierende Wirkung des synthetisch ergestellten "porcine appeasing pheromone (PAP) " (SSNA Sanofi Santé Nutrition Animale) bei Schlachtschweinen waehrend des Transportes sowie dadurch bedingt eine moegliche Verbesserung der Fleischqualitaet geprueft werden. Die Beobachtungen erfolgten an 11 Gruppen von jeweils 24 Schweinen (n = 264 Schweine der Rasse Pi x DL) mit einem Koerpergewicht von 102 ± 10, 6 kg. Jede Gruppe wurde in einem Tiertransporter auf jeweils der gleichen Route mit dem gleichen Fahrer fuer ca. 40 bis 45 Minuten vom Maester zum Schlachthof transportiert. Vor und nach dem Transport wurden verschiedene Parameter erhoben. Fuer den Versuch erhielten 5 Gruppen (n = 120 Tiere) vor dem Transport 6 ml des PAP’s als Spray auf die Nackenhaut und 6 Gruppen (n = 144 Tiere) erhielten an der gleichen Stelle ein Placebo. Am lebenden Tier wurde Cortisol im Speichel bei 8 Tieren/Gruppe bestimmt (1. Basalwert beim Maester, 2. nach dem Transport, 3. 30 Minuten nach Ankunft im Schlachthof in der Wartebucht). Weiterhin erfolgten Verhaltensbeobachtungen mittels Video in der Wartebucht fuer 25 Minuten (scan-sampling alle 30 sec), es wurde die Herzfrequenz mittels Polar® Sport Tester bei 8 Tieren/Gruppe gemessen und die Koerperoberflaechentemperatur mittels Infrarot-Thermometrie sowie das Koerpergewicht bestimmt. Post mortem wurde der pH 1 und pH 24, die Leitfaehigkeit im Schinken und im Kotelett 24 h nach der Schlachtung bestimmt und der Schlachtkoerper auf Verletzungen auf Grund von Auseinandersetzungen untersucht. Zusaetzlich wurden ausserhalb und im Transporter Luftfeuchte und Umgebungstemperatur bestimmt. Die Ergebnisse weisen auf eine deutliche stressor- bzw. transportinduzierte Aktivierung der Hypothalamus-Hypophysen-Nebennieren-Achse (HPA) bei allen Tieren. Im Speichel von allen Schweinen ist ein eindeutiger Anstieg der Cortisolkonzentration nach dem Transport im Vergleich zum Basalwert messbar, wobei die mit dem Pheromon behandelten Tiere eine signifikant niedrigere Cortisolkonzentration (p = 0, 02) im Speichel aufwiesen, im Vergleich zu den mit Placebo behandelten Tieren (Placebo 22, 55 ± 6, 4 nmol/l, Pheromon 19, 15 ± 7, 26 nmol/l). Die Auswertung der Herzfrequenzmessungen jedoch ergab keinen signifikanten Unterschied zwischen den zwei Versuchsgruppen. Die hoechsten Werte konnten beim Verladen gemessen werden (170 - 173 S/min.), anschliessend ging die Frequenz allmaehlich zurueck bis sie im zweiten Abschnitt des Wartestallaufenthaltes durchschnittlich einen Wert von 118 - 120 S/min. erreichte. Die hohen Werte lassen auf eine starke Belastung der Tiere schliessen. Die Erhebung der Hauttemperatur am Ohrgrund ergab ebenfalls keinen Unterschied zwischen der Kontrollgruppe und der PAP-Gruppe. Die Ausgangstemperatur war zwar von der Umgebungstemperatur und somit vom Wetter abhaengig, dennoch blieb der Anstieg der Temperatur beim Transport bei kalter sowie warmer Witterung nahezu gleich (4, 5 ± 2, 5 °C an kalten und 4, 6 ± 1, 9 °C an warmen Tagen). Auch bei den Parametern Gewichtsverlust und Verhalten konnte kein Unterschied zwischen den PAP- und Kontrollgruppen festgestellt werden. An den Schlachtkoerpern waren nur wenige leichte Verletzungen zu erkennen, die sich auf beide Gruppen gleich verteilten. Dies kann darauf zurueckgefuehrt werden, dass die Tiere buchtenweise, ohne Vermischen der Gruppen transportiert wurden. Hingegen kann bei den Fleischqualitaetsmerkmalen ein vermutlicher Einfluss der PAP-Applikation festgestellt werden. Der pH 1 im M. longissimus dorsi der Pheromon-Tiere ist 45 Minuten nach der Schlachtung signifikant hoeher (p < 0, 01; Placebo pH 1 = 6, 13 ± 0, 22; Pheromon pH 1 = 6, 26 ± 0, 29) sowie die Leitfaehigkeit im M. longissimus dorsi 24 h post mortem signifikant niedriger (p < 0, 01; Placebo LF = 7, 22 ± 2, 39 mS/cm; Pheromon LF= 6, 32 ± 1, 83 mS/cm). Auch die Bildung von Qualitaetsklassen anhand der Fleischbeschaffenheitsmerkmale deuten auf eine Verbesserung der Fleischqualit aet durch die Applikation von PAP. Bei den Placebogruppen konnte ein prozentual hoeheren Anteil von Schlachtkoerpern in den Klassen "PSE-Verdacht" und "DFD-Verdacht" ermittelt werden. Gleichermassen gab es einen hoeheren Schlachtkoerperanteil in den Klassen "sehr gut" und "gut" bei der PAP-Gruppe. Die Ergebnisse deuten darauf hin, dass das "porcine appeasing pheromone" den physiologischen und koerperlichen Status von Schweinen waehrend des Transportes im Sinne einer Stressreduktion beeinflusst. Dieser stressreduziernde Effekt ist an den signifikant niedrigeren Cortisolkonzentrationen im Speichel der PAP-Tiere nach dem Transport erkennbar. Ob PAP auch einen beruhigenden Effekt hat, ist an Hand vorliegender Ergebnisse eher auszuschliessen. Weiterhin fuehrt die stressreduzierende Wirkung des "porcine appeasing pheromone" zu einer reduzierten Glycogenolyse im Muskel und damit einer verminderten Muskelsaeuerung, welches sich in dem signifikant hoeheren pH 1 und der signifikant niedrigeren Leitfaehigkeit im M. longissimus dorsi ausdrueckt. Die Anwendung von PAP ist an Hand vorliegender Ergebnisse geeignet das Wohlbefinden der Schweine waehrend des Transportes zu verbessern, den Stress zu reduzieren und zusaetzlich dadurch die Fleischqualitaet der Schlachtkoerper zu verbessern. In weiteren Untersuchungen sollten Modifikationen hinsichtlich der Applikationsdauer und der Applikationsorte (Wartebucht, Raumspray) untersucht werden...|$|E

A discrete-event simulation model was developed and utilized to quantify the impacts of controllable and environmental variables on productivity {{in order to determine}} the most cost effective transportation options under steep terrain conditions. Truck-chipper interactions were analyzed to show their effect on truck and chipper standing time. A costing model was developed to account for operating and standing time cost (for the chipper and trucks). The model used information from time studies of each activity in the productive cycle and spatial-temporal information obtained from geographic information system (GIS) devices, and tracking analysis of machine and truck movements. The model was validated in field operations, and proved to be accurate in providing the expected productivity. A cost distribution was elaborated to support operational decisions of forest managers, landowners and risk-averse contractors.

5000|$|Vincent S. Waters {{became the}} third {{bishop of the}} Raleigh Diocese. In 1945, he left the missionary {{territory}} of Virginia where he {{had served as a}} priest and came as bishop to the mission ground of the Raleigh Diocese. He had many goals. Waters wanted the salvation of all people and the conversion of all North Carolinians. To increase conversions, he started the Missionary Apostolate. The Missionary Apostolate was a four-part program that used the energies of his seminarians and priests to spread Catholicism. The first aspect of the Apostolate was the Summer Census. Each summer, the seminarians went to different areas of North Carolina, noting the Catholics and distributing Catholic information. The second aspect of the Apostolate was the Apostolate year, in which the newly ordained priests spent their first priestly year at an older priest's parish, serving at the parish's missions. The third part of the Apostolate was the <b>Trailer</b> Apostolate. <b>Traveling</b> in <b>trailers</b> to rural areas, the two priests remained in one place for two weeks, teaching Catholicism and celebrating the Sacraments. The diocese's two trailers each had a chapel, living space, an area for visiting, and an outdoor altar. The fourth aspect of Missionary Apostolate was the Mission Band. Waters stationed two Raleigh priests at two separate parishes outside of the diocese where they preached and solicited donations for the Raleigh Diocese. Priests who remained within the diocese planned retreats for the North Carolina Catholics. These four aspects comprised Waters' Missionary Apostolate. To convert the entire state, Waters encouraged each Church to convert one North Carolinian for every adult parishioner. This goal was not realized. Waters was more successful in establishing a Catholic church in every county. At his death, seventy-five of the one hundred North Carolina counties contained churches, though many were missions, lacking a resident pastor because of the shortage of priests. Waters also wanted to increase the number and size of parochial schools. Initially successful, schools increased from fifteen to sixty-four, but following the Second Vatican Council, the number declined, though Waters was still bishop. Waters began ending segregation in the diocese in June 1953, despite resistance from the North Carolinians. Holy Redeemer Parish in Newton Grove, run by the Redemptorist priests, became the first Church of any denomination in North Carolina to be integrated. On Memorial Day Weekend of 1953, Waters himself celebrated the first integrated Mass. No riots ensued, but tension abounded and both the church and school suffered such a loss of numbers that both closed and the Redemptorists left. Later, the church reopened as Our Lady of Guadalupe and operates to this day. In 1954, St. Monica, a school for black children, joined the Cathedral School for whites. These two became the first integrated schools in North Carolina. Waters strove to preserve pious Catholic traditions. Unhappy that some religious sisters stopped wearing their habits, Waters wrote a letter in 1971 requesting that the nuns wear their habits or leave the diocese. Some religious sisters kept their habits and continued serving; others left the diocese. Waters also required that his priests wear their clerics in public. Though some people, religious and lay, disliked Waters' rigidity and traditionalism, others supported Waters as he preserved Church traditions. While Waters was bishop, the diocese grew. It increased physically, having received by 1960 the Abbey Nullius as its own property. The diocese covered all of North Carolina except Belmont Abbey, which remained its own diocese under the abbot's supervision. The diocese had three auxiliary bishops during Waters' episcopate: James Johnston Navagh (1952-1957), Charles Borromeo McLaughlin (1964-1968) and George Edward Lynch (1970-1985). [...] The Raleigh Diocese also grew in numbers; by 1972, the diocese contained over 70,000 Catholics. Pope Paul VI granted Waters' petition and split the Raleigh Diocese, establishing the Diocese of Charlotte for the west half of North Carolina. The Raleigh Diocese dropped from about 46,000 miles to its current size of about 32,000 miles, stretching from Burlington, just East of Greensboro, to the Atlantic Coast. After nearly thirty years of being Raleigh's bishop, Waters died from a heart attack in 1974, leaving North Carolina with 78 diocesan priests, 76 religious order priests, and 77,834 Catholics.|$|R
