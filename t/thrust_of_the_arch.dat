50|$|Like many through arch bridges, {{the design}} of the bridge is often {{confused}} with the tied-arch bridge; many bridges have both characteristics. However in this case the bridge is of cast iron, which would be weak in tension. Although the aqueduct channel is in the right position to act in tying the arch, it would have no strength in this direction. At Stanley Ferry, the outward sideways <b>thrust</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>arch</b> is retained by its abutments, as for the simple arch bridge.|$|E
5000|$|The beams {{were cast}} in a [...] "turtle back profile" [...] to give the {{required}} strength, at minimum weight. They were supported by cast iron columns, erected on top <b>of</b> each other. <b>The</b> lateral <b>thrust</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> brick <b>arches</b> was resisted by concealed wrought iron ties between the column tops. The building was 15 bays wide, and the wings six bays wide.|$|R
50|$|From a {{technical}} standpoint, the bridge exemplifies the long-span bridge engineering <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 20th century. Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> growing {{need to provide}} uninterrupted highway passage over large bodies of water, engineers increasingly were called upon to design large cantilevered trusses, suspension bridges, and steel arches. Innovative erection methods, <b>the</b> availability <b>of</b> very large structural components, and special metals all contributed to <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> long-span bridge technology. For example, nearly a third <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Arrigoni Bridge utilized high-strength silicon steel, and the bridge was almost entirely erected by building <b>the</b> <b>arches</b> outward from <b>the</b> center pier, letting them balance {{each other as they}} were extended over the water. Another notable engineering feature are <b>the</b> chains <b>of</b> huge eyebars under the roadway that tie together <b>the</b> ends <b>of</b> each arch; <b>the</b> tied-arch technique resisted <b>the</b> outward horizontal <b>thrust</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>arches</b> and thus allowed the piers to be much smaller and more economical.|$|R

When porches of this kind, {{carried by}} walls, are placed close together, as {{in cases where}} there are many and large entrances to a cathedral front, they would, in their general form, leave deep and uncomfortable intervals, in which damp would lodge and grass grow; {{and there would be}} a painful feeling in {{approaching}} the door in <b>the</b> midst <b>of</b> a crowd, as if some of them might miss the real doors, and be driven into the intervals, and embayed there. Clearly it will be a natural and right expedient, in such cases, to open <b>the</b> walls <b>of</b> <b>the</b> porch wider, so that they may correspond in slope, or nearly so, with <b>the</b> bevel <b>of</b> <b>the</b> doorway, and either meet each other in the intervals, or have the said intervals closed up with an intermediate wall, so that nobody may get embayed in them. The porches will thus be united, and form one range of great open gulphs or caverns, ready to receive all comers, and direct <b>the</b> current <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crowd into the narrower entrances. As <b>the</b> lateral <b>thrust</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>arches</b> is now met by each other, the pinnacles, if there were any, must be removed, and waterspouts placed between each <b>arch</b> to discharge <b>the</b> double drainage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gables. This is <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> noble northern porches, without exception, best represented by that of Rheims.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The rigid-frame tied through {{arch bridge}} is a main form in CFST arch bridge. Most {{of this type}} bridges have a single-span, in which the arch ribs are fixed to the piers to form a rigid frame and high {{strength}} strands are employed as tired bars by pre-stressed to produce horizontal compression forces to balance the <b>thrust</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>arch</b> ribs. Some of them {{have more than one}} spans, three spans are the most popularity.

40|$|TIlls {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} collapse of masonry structures in response to large support displacements and horizontal ground accelerations. There are two main classes of masonry structure: arches that thrust, and supporting elements, such as walls and buttresses, which resist the thrust. This dissertation analyses the safety of arches and buttresses and identifies the resulting collapse mechanisms due to support displacements or horizontal accelerations. In patiicular, this resesarch investigates the stability of a masonry arch supported on buttresses and the conditions necessary for collapse to occur. Engineers are frequently asked to determine the safety of masonry structures that have been severely distorted over the years, often due to subsidence or other long-term movements in the foundations, and this disseliation provides guidance {{in the assessment of}} such structures. The resistance of masonry buttresses to high-level horizontal loads is examined. In the case of failure due to overturning, a fracture will develop in the masonry, significantly reducing the resistance of the buttress. The capacity is further reduced by outward leaning of the buttresses, a common source of distress for masonry structures due to movements in the supporting foundations. Based on these considerations, new measures of safety are proposed for buttresses under horizontal loading. Outward leaning of the buttresses increases the span of the arch or vault. Spreading supports will cause large deformations in the arch, which increase the horizontal <b>thrust</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>arch</b> and may lead to collapse. In addition, lateral ground accelerations can cause {{the collapse of}} arches. The influence of seismic action can be approximated to first order by equivalent static analysis to determine the initial collapse mechanism. These problems are analysed for circular masonry arches, and the collapse conditions are identified for various geometries. The findings are combined to investigate the stability of the masonry arch supported on buttresses. The safety of the system is examined by studying the influence of imposed displacements. As the buttresses lean, the thrust of the vault increases and the resistance of the buttress decreases. The collapse mechanisms are identified for both the static case of leaning buttresses and the dynamic case of horizontal acceleration. This analysis illustrates that the arch will collapse and the buttresses will remain standing in most cases. Based on these considerations, new methods are proposed for assessing the safety of masonry structures and determining the influence of future movements on the stability of existing masonry structures.

30|$|Determination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>arch</b> {{dominance}} has surgical implications since thoracotomy {{is performed}} on the non-dominant side [7].

However, <b>the</b> narrowest portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>arch</b> may not be located at this level. The 3 D volume-rendered or surface shaded displays, especially with a left or right posterior oblique view with cranial angulation, are valuable in depicting the ring and sizes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>arches</b> (Fig.  2 f, g).
