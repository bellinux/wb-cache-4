5|$|After {{stepping}} out of the TARDIS in modern-day Colchester, the Doctor is blown off his feet by a blast of air, and the TARDIS, Amy still inside, dematerialises into the time vortex and refuses to rematerialise. With Amy's help, the Doctor tracks the disturbance to <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>floor</b> of a house. The Doctor opts to take a room for rent offered by the downstairs tenant, Craig Owens, in order to determine what is present on <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>floor</b> without alerting whatever it is to his Time Lord nature. Neither Craig nor the Doctor are aware that people are being lured off the street to <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>floor</b> flat and never leaving again, but the Doctor is conscious of localised time loops and disturbances aboard the TARDIS that coincide with noises from <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>floor.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to Lee, the police arrested {{a friend of}} Phagan's for the crime. Gradually, the police became convinced that these were not the culprits. By Monday, the police had theorized that the murder occurred on <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>floor</b> (the same as Frank's office) based on hair found on a lathe and {{what appeared to be}} blood on the ground of <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>floor.</b>|$|E

5|$|Ascending the {{staircase}} are bronze railings with mahogany banisters. The railings {{are decorated with}} the swastika symbol which, whilst mostly associated with Nazi Germany, has been traced {{back as far as}} the 3rd millennium B.C.E. in Asia. The stairway's newel posts, on the landing between the second and third floors, are a pair of bronze ram's heads, identical newel posts grace {{the bottom of the stairs}} as well. <b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>floor</b> landing offers a view of the stained glass windows, all original, which were fully restored during the 1980s renovation. Elevator access is also located on <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>floor</b> landing, the elevator was a 1950s addition to the courthouse. Originally, to access the third floor, the only option was one of two staircases. Both staircases rose from <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>floor</b> landing to the third floor, one staircase was located to either side of the stairwell leading to the landing. When the elevator was installed {{the staircase}} on the left-hand side of the landing was removed.|$|E
5|$|On <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>floor</b> is {{a bronze}} bust, by Albin Polasek, of {{sculptor}} and muralist Frank Millet, {{who had also}} died on the Titanic.|$|E

5|$|Senator Don Cameron of Pennsylvania {{purchased}} the Benjamin Ogle Tayloe House for $60,000 in 1887, and resided {{there for a}} time. Cameron expanded the home significantly, almost entirely rebuilding its interior. After the renovation, the front entrance opened onto a square entrance hall. A fireplace adorned the hall. Large rooms {{on either side of}} the entrance hall were used as office space. A broad staircase led from the entrance hall up to <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>floor,</b> where there were four large rooms. The rooms opened on to one another, permitting <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>floor</b> to be opened up into something approaching a single large ballroom. The windows on <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>floor</b> reached to the floor. An iron veranda ran around the entire second floor. The home contained a total of 30 rooms after the renovation. Cameron did not, however, renovate the exterior, which remained much the same as it always had. Henry Adams was a frequent guest of the Camerons, playing often with their daughter Martha to alleviate his bouts of depression.|$|E
5|$|The Hampshire Review {{newspaper}} {{occupied the}} building's second floor with its offices and printing plant from 1884 to 1895. John J. Cornwell, {{who later became}} West Virginia's governor, and his brother William B. Cornwell purchased the newspaper in 1890. The newspaper continued to operate from <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>floor</b> of the Wirgman Building until 1895, when the Cornwell brothers relocated the Hampshire Review office and printing plant {{to the first floor}} of their new brick building on West Main Street. In the newspaper's printing plant on <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>floor</b> of the Wirgman Building, the Hampshire Review was printed by a hand-operated Benjamin Franklin printing press.|$|E
5|$|The attic is {{tall and}} embraces <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>floor.</b> It has moulded stone coping and a small {{pediment}} in the centre, which is supported by an entablature decorated with triglyphs and modillions.|$|E
50|$|The facade is {{red brick}} and light colored stone. There is a diagonally placed turret in the mansion's {{southeast}} corner, {{rising above the}} rest of the house. Bays are formed in <b>the</b> first and <b>second</b> <b>floor</b> rooms within <b>the</b> tower. A prominent oriel projects from <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>floor's</b> northeast corner, opposite the tower. Many windows are detailed in stained glass including those in the oriel. The porte-cochere has been remodeled over the years and was originally intended to awe and amaze visitors to the Boynton House.|$|R
50|$|Most of the house's {{finishings}} {{were added}} later. The ceilings {{of the main}} rooms are modern coved plaster. The most significant original elements are the wooden doors and their shouldered surrounds. On <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>floors</b> of <b>the</b> wing the small sash windows slide up into the wall.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>floor's</b> {{walls were}} heightened, ca. 1813, {{to a full}} story from the {{original}} half-story height, using dove-tailed corner timbering. The original, hand-hewn rafters were reused, and a full attic was added, included a Rauchenkammer (smoke room) for smoking meats with smoke from the stovepipe.|$|R
5|$|The entry hall {{is almost}} entirely {{original}} construction. Nearly all the woodwork and decoration in this area dates to the 180005 period, {{with the exception of}} several balusters and newel posts on the spiral staircase, which were Victorian replacements. The major change to the entry hall was the construction of false walls, allowing the conversion of the original hinged doors into sliding doors. <b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>floor</b> central hall and Washington Room (on <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>floor,</b> in the southeast corner) were also changed very little in the renovation.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>floor</b> is a folk museum with scale-model fishing boat, {{and other}} tools and items of {{cultural}} significance to Ikata on display year-round.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>floor's</b> dining area, {{kitchen and}} {{bedrooms}} can be uncomfortable {{for older adults}} to reach. (To be fair, it was designed for young families.) Groceries had to be carried upstairs. A dumbwaiter, laundry and garbage chutes would help. The needed space might be had by using circular stairs.|$|R
5|$|Also {{on campus}} is the Louise and Bernard Palitz Gallery. Located on <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>floor</b> of the Lubin House, the Palitz gallery has a {{rotation}} of exhibitions, including two annual public shows, {{local and regional}} artists, featured items from the university's art collection, and professional artists.|$|E
5|$|Oregon Agricultural College {{opened a}} new library in 1918, marking {{the first time that}} the library had its own building. Prior to 1918 the library had been housed on <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>floor</b> of the college's {{administration}} building, Benton Hall. When the new building was completed, the school built a temporary trellis from neighboring Benton Hall's second floor to <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>floor</b> of the new building in order to more easily transfer the books to their new location. Initially, the new building also housed offices and classrooms, but within a decade the library expanded to occupy all of the structure. John V. Bennes designed the new building, as well as many of the campus buildings constructed during that period. By 1922 the collection had grown to 73,000 volumes, and Lucy M. Lewis served as the school's librarian.|$|E
5|$|Significant {{changes to}} the planetarium were made during this time, {{including}} {{the addition of a}} new spiral staircase that led straight to the Theatre of the Stars, an adjacent elevator for the elderly and disabled, and a larger gallery space on <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>floor.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: The {{art gallery}} on <b>the</b> library's <b>second</b> <b>floor</b> was built with {{influence}} from sculptor Lorado Taft.|$|R
50|$|Four two-story wings contain {{most of the}} school's class rooms. Oddly, <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>floors</b> {{of these}} wings are not {{attached}} to each other. A and B wings are located {{toward the front of}} the school, facing Twelve Mile Road. C and D wings are located toward the rear of the building.|$|R
60|$|Close to {{the east}} wall, beneath the {{overhanging}} balconies of <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>floors,</b> I crept in dense shadows {{the full length of}} the courtyard, until I came to the buildings at the north end. These were lighted for about three floors up, but above the third floor all was dark.|$|R
5|$|The Scelsi ITC houses BRTA offices, {{a waiting}} room, {{concession}} vendors, and other office tenants. <b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>floor</b> {{of the building}} houses two classrooms used by Berkshire Community College and Massachusetts College of Liberal Arts. On May 19, 2013, the Pittsfield Visitor's Center moved into {{the first floor of}} the ITC, to be staffed by local volunteers.|$|E
5|$|The chapel, seating 350 people, {{occupied}} the front {{section of the}} present building. The rear of the building had lecture rooms, {{the office of the}} college president, a meeting room for the trustees on the first floor, and a library on <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>floor.</b>|$|E
5|$|The kitchen, oratory {{and great}} chamber rose two floors, {{therefore}} only the minstrels' gallery was accessed via the main staircase on <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>floor.</b> However, the butlery and pantry was single-storeyed, but held the butler's chamber (with a garderobe) above it, accessed either via a staircase {{in that room}} or via the gallery.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>floor's</b> [...] "Ancient Cultures" [...] {{floor is}} {{separated}} by region with displays for Central Africa and New Guinea, followed by larger sections for ancient Egypt, Mesoamerica, and China which include duplications of King Tutankhamun's tomb, Terracotta Army soldiers, and Chichen Itza's temple of warriors, alongside many authentic artifacts in display cases.|$|R
5000|$|Saks-34th Street {{became a}} part of the New York {{division}} of Gimbels, and a sky bridge across 33rd Street connected <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>floors</b> of both flagship buildings. [...] cannot be correct because the sky bridge does not cross 33rd Street. The sky bridge crosses 32nd Street in the opposite direction to the south.|$|R
50|$|The {{station was}} {{constructed}} {{during the summer}} of 2001 and officially opened on October 8, 2001. This is the first public railway station whose construction was entirely funded by a private enterprise (the adjacent shopping mall). Entrance to the station is possible only through <b>the</b> mall's <b>second</b> <b>floor,</b> where a small station building exists. A bridge connects <b>the</b> mall's <b>second</b> <b>floor</b> with <b>the</b> two platforms on ground level just west of it.|$|R
