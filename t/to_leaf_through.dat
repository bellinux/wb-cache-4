25|$|In a 1939 essay titled When Fiction Lives in Fiction, Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges {{described}} Flann O'Brien's masterpiece as follows, I have enumerated many verbal labyrinths, {{but none}} so complex {{as the recent}} book by Flann O'Brien, At Swim-Two-Birds. A student in Dublin writes a novel about the proprietor of a Dublin public house, who writes a novel about the habitués of his pub (among them, the student), who in their turn write novels in which proprietor and student figure along with other writers about other novelists. The book consists of the extremely diverse manuscripts of these real or imagined persons, copiously annotated by the student. At Swim-Two-Birds {{is not only a}} labyrinth; it is a discussion of the many ways to conceive of the Irish novel and a repertory of exercises in prose and verse which illustrate or parody all the styles of Ireland. The magisterial influence of Joyce (also an architect of labyrinths, also a literary Proteus) is undeniable, but not disproportionate in this manifold book. Arthur Schopenhauer wrote that dreaming and wakefulness are the pages of a single book, and that to read them in order is to live, and <b>to</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>through</b> them at random, is to dream.

The leaf growing stage may also be quantitatively monitored by a normalized EDVI. Since EDVI retrievals from satellite are generally possible during both daytime and nighttime under non-rain conditions, the EDVI technique studied here may provide higher temporal resolution observations for monitoring the onset of spring and the duration of growing season compared to currently operational satellite methods...|$|R

The F (Stage 2) lines were derived or sourced from different geographic origins or hubs of international barley breeding ventures representing two breeding cycles (2009 and 2011 trials) and were evaluated across eight environments for infection type at both seedling and adult plant stages. Association mapping was performed using mean scores for disease reaction, accounting for family effects using the eigenvalues from a matrix of genotype correlations. In this study, 15 QTL were detected; 5 QTL co-located with catalogued leaf rust resistance genes (Rph 1, Rph 3 / 19, Rph 8 / 14 / 15, Rph 20, Rph 21), 6 QTL aligned with previously reported genomic regions and 4 QTL (3 on chromosome 1 H and 1 on 7 H) were novel.

40|$|Abscisic acid (ABA) is {{important}} for mediating abiotic stress responses and also in plant immunity. Its involvement in the resistance of wild tobacco Nicotiana attenuata to the pathogenic fungus Alternaria alternata, tobacco pathotype, was investigated. After infection, many fungal hyphae were observed <b>to</b> enter <b>leaf</b> tissue <b>through</b> stomata within 24 h, and necrotic lesions were formed after 3 – 6 days. Importantly, source–sink transition leaves (leaf 0) were more resistant than all fully expanded ones, and this was correlated with more ABA and ABA-related gene transcripts and lower sto-matal conductance in leaf 0 after infection. When supplied with ABA or incubated {{in the dark for}} 1 day, fully expanded leaves, which accumulated less ABA and showed higher stomatal conductance after infection in comparison <b>to</b> <b>leaf</b> 0, showed increased resistance. Mitogen-activated protein kinase 4 -silenced plants, in which ABA-induced sto-matal closure responses and resistance to A. alternata were highly impaired, did not show stomatal conductance change after infection, and leaf 0 and fully expanded leaves all developed bigger lesions than in wildtype plants. Thus the ABA signalling pathway mediated by NaMPK 4 is required for the resistance of N. attenuata to A. alternata, at least in part through the stomatal closure responses...|$|R
40|$|Transport {{of viruses}} from cell to cell in plants {{typically}} involves {{one or more}} viral proteins that supply dedicated movement functions. Transport from leaf <b>to</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>through</b> phloem, or long-distance transport, is a poorly understood process with requirements differing from those of cell-to-cell movement. Through genetic analysis of tobacco etch virus (TER potyvirus group), a nove 1 long-distance movement factor was identified that facilitates vascular-associated movement in tobacco. A mutation in the central region of the helper component proteinase (HC-Pro), a TEV-encoded protein with previously described activities in aphid-mediated transmission and polyprotein processing, inactivated long-distance movement. This mutant virus exhibited only minor defects in genome amplification and cell-to-cell movement functions. In situ histochemical analysis revealed that the mutant was capable of infecting mesophyll, bundle sheath, and phloem cells within inoculated leaves, suggesting that the long-distance movement block was associated with entry into or exit from sieve elements. The long-distance movement defect was specifically complemented by HC-Pro supplied in trans by a transgenic host. The data indicate that HC-Pro functions {{in one or more}} steps unique to long-distance transport...|$|E
40|$|Come {{back to us}} {{when you}} have {{demonstrated}} this in humans,” said an editor {{to one of my}} postdocs presenting a poster at a recent conference. We use the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei as a model to study Golgi duplication, and the implica-tion was that the results of such studies are only worthy of a wider audience once they have been demonstrated in humans, or {{at least one of the}} other crown eukaryotes, that is, yeast, flies, worms, fish, or mice. It was not always so. One only has <b>to</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>through</b> the early cell biological literature, from the fifties onwards, to appreciate the breadth of organisms under study. This is par-ticularly true of The Journal of Cell Biology (or The Journal of Biophysical and Biochemical Cytology, as it was titled back then). The range was vast: from crickets to crabs, guinea pigs to grasshoppers, limpets to locusts, peas to pigeons, spiders to snails, and termites to turtles. One reason for this, of course, was the invention of the electron microscope and its application to the biological sciences. Almost any cell or tissue could be fixed, embedded in plastic, and sectioned, and then viewed at a resolution far exceeding that of light microscopy, revealing subcellular architecture that had never before been seen. Such studies not only attested to the validity of the cell theory, the basis of all known life on earth, but also showed that many cells were highly specialized, committing a large part of their metabolic energy to a particular cell function. Such studies identified model systems that could be used to pick apart a cell function into its component parts.

40|$|My thesis {{exhibition}} presents {{mixed media}} artist 2 ̆ 7 s books inspired by autobiographical stOlies originating from my family. These stories {{relate to the}} lives of my family and the natural environment of my home in a small-town farming community with deep Appalachian roots. With a sense of humor and solemnity, I make artist 2 ̆ 7 s books about the events and stories related to our religion, work, animals, neighbors, land and superstitions. I mournfully watch the slow disintegration of our way of life. Vital aspects of our lives, such as working on the farm as a family, speaking with an accent, and making much of our own food, clothes, and tools by hand is slowly fading in an homogenized and industlialized world. This nostalgia encouraged me to research my own identity where I learned that Appalachians are famous for their storytelling and oral traditions. My father displayed an obvious talent for storytelling that {{was an integral part of}} the whole family. I tell stories in my own way as I preserve my family 2 ̆ 7 s history by using personal stories as the content for inspiration to create art. My books are the physical embodiment of my continuing research into a variety of book structures using two-dimensional imagery on paper to create three-dimensional objects. Construction of the books has been a major exploration as it suggests possibilities for the book to be viewed as sculpture. Traditional book formats encourage the viewer <b>to</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>through</b> the book and read in a linear fashion from beginning to end, such as in my two books, raisin 2 ̆ 7 baccer and The Tree that Fell on Three Lines. Many of my most recent works, however, are not 2 ̆ 2 read 2 ̆ 2 but function as sculptural bookworks. The materials and processes that I use often have a direct correlation to the stories inspiring the work. Materials familiar to my childhood and farmlife, such as fabric, twine, burlap, thread, and wood recur again and again in the various works. As a child, I came into contact with these materials on a daily basis. As an adult artist, these materials add an essential tactile quality to my work that references the content of the pieces. Also included in the works are the media and methods of the artist, such as drawing, painting, and a variety of plintmaking techniques including relief printing, letterpress, intaglio, xerox lithograpy, and silkscreen. Not only are the materials related to the content of the books, but also the nature of my working process parallels work on the farm. The physical nature of printmaking and bookmaking requires repetitive actions, hand manipulation of mUltiples, and the gathering of numerous palts, all of which are similar to the physical actions of many farm tasks that require intensive manual labor such as planting, cultivating, and harvesting. The nature of these artist 2 ̆ 7 s books is not to recount word-for-word my family 2 ̆ 7 s stories, but to use the stories as inspiration in creating art. I am beginning from the oral stories, which include our memories and experiences, and through artistic 2 ̆ 2 license 2 ̆ 2 choosing to tell parts, change, emphasize, and abstract. In storytelling, incidents that originate in truth become an abstraction through time and transmission. Likewise, my artist 2 ̆ 7 s books are an abstraction of truthful events that have been synthesized into art...|$|E
40|$|The {{characterization}} of biomass and its dynamics provides valuable {{information for the}} assessment of natural and transplanted eelgrass populations. The need for simple, nondestructive assessments has led {{to the use of the}} leaf biomass-to-length ratio for converting leaf-length measurements, which can be easily obtained, <b>to</b> <b>leaf</b> growth rates <b>through</b> the plastochrone method. Using data on leaf biomass and length collected in three natural eelgrass populations and a mesocosm, we evaluated the suitability of a leaf weight-to-length ratio for nondestructive assessments. For the data sets considered, the isometric scaling that sustains the weight-to-length proxy always produced inconsistent fittings, and for leaf-lengths greater than a threshold value, the conversion of <b>leaf</b> length <b>to</b> biomass generated biased estimations. In contrast, an allometric scaling of leaf biomass and length was highly consistent in all the cases considered. And these nondestructive assessments generated reliable levels of reproducibility in leaf biomass for all the ranges of variability in leaf lengths. We argue that the use of allometric scaling for the representation of leaf biomass in terms of length provides a more reliable approach for estimating eelgrass biomass...|$|R

5000|$|Art-historical {{analysis}} {{in the early to}} mid 20th century placed little emphasis on Christ's older age for a [...] "Virgin and Child" [...] work of this period. Nor did it emphasise the significance of the manuscript or the rough manner in which Christ seems <b>to</b> energetically <b>leaf</b> <b>through</b> it, his play watched on by a near-indulgent Mary. More recently, art historians such as Alfred Acres have questioned the significance of the child's freedom of movement and naturalistic portrayal in such a deliberately elegant and poised work—especially in the work of such a self-aware and compositionally involved painter as van der Weyden. Acres believes that the book is central {{to the understanding of the}} painting, and notes its perfect centrality in the panel; it is the focus of both figures' gazes and hands, and Christ is apparently leafing backwards through the pages, towards the beginning. While Christ's right hand holds a number of parchments scrunched together and he pays no attention to them, his more careful left hand is about to open the lower left corner of the open page. If it is reasonably assumed that the book held open on Mary's lap is facing towards her, it seems the child is leafing backwards through the pages. While holy books were often included in 15th-century northern depictions of the Virgin, they were usually associated with the idea of the Virgin as a representation of learning or wisdom; in no other contemporary painting are they turned through with such restless energy, not to mention being turned through from end to beginning. Acres suggests that the infant Christ is leafing back towards Genesis: 3 describing the Fall of Man, citing three other works where van der Weyden similarly articulates the redemptive theme, including the [...] Madonna Standing panel in the Kunsthistorisches Museum where the Madonna is flanked by figures of Adam and Eve.|$|R
