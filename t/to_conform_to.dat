5|$|In a {{surprise}} move, the Argentine naval commission then threw {{out all of}} the opening tenders and called for another round of bidding; they simultaneously updated the specifications to include what were judged to be the best aspects of all the plans. The competitors were given three weeks to come up with new designs and cost estimates. After diplomatic protests, this was modified slightly; the original bids were kept, but alterations to attempt <b>to</b> <b>conform</b> <b>to</b> the new desired characteristics were allowed.|$|E
5|$|The President of the Italian Republic has an {{official}} standard. The current version {{is based on}} the square flag of the Napoleonic Italian Republic, on a field of blue, charged with the coat of arms in gold. Prior to this the field was solid blue. The current coat of arms, more accurately called an emblem as it was not designed <b>to</b> <b>conform</b> <b>to</b> traditional heraldic rules, was adopted in place of the royal arms on 5 May 1948.|$|E

5|$|The {{story begins}} {{on a cold}} and bleak Christmas Eve in London, seven years {{after the death of}} Ebenezer Scrooge's {{business}} partner, Jacob Marley. Scrooge, an old miser, hates Christmas and refuses an invitation to Christmas dinner from his nephew Fred. He turns away two men who seek a donation from him in order to provide food and heating for the poor, and only grudgingly allows his overworked, underpaid clerk, Bob Cratchit, Christmas Day off with pay <b>to</b> <b>conform</b> <b>to</b> the social custom.|$|E
5|$|City {{planning}} and urban lifestyles had {{been influenced by}} the Greeks from an early period, and in the eastern Empire, Roman rule accelerated and shaped the local development of cities that already had a strong Hellenistic character. Cities such as Athens, Aphrodisias, Ephesus and Gerasa altered some aspects of city {{planning and}} architecture <b>to</b> <b>conform</b> <b>to</b> imperial ideals, while also expressing their individual identity and regional preeminence. In the areas of the western Empire inhabited by Celtic-speaking peoples, Rome encouraged the development of urban centres with stone temples, forums, monumental fountains, and amphitheatres, often on or near the sites of the preexisting walled settlements known as oppida. Urbanization in Roman Africa expanded on Greek and Punic cities along the coast.|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{the ships}} began between late 1863 and early 1864 and they were still being built {{when the war ended}} in early 1865. Construction was {{suspended}} on all four on 17 November 1865; they remained on the stocks. The ships were renamed, usually twice, in 1869 <b>to</b> <b>conform</b> <b>to</b> several new ship naming conventions. Vice Admiral David D. Porter ordered that Colossus be rebuilt to carry 10 large broadside guns and fitted with iron masts in a ship rig, but this never happened. The unseasoned wood in their hulls quickly began to rot after construction was suspended and they were broken up beginning in 1874. Unusually, Passaconaway was condemned by an Act of Congress on 5 August 1882 before she was finally broken up in 1884.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{homogeneity}} of ancient Egyptian art, the styles of particular {{times and places}} sometimes reflected changing cultural or political attitudes. After {{the invasion of the}} Hyksos in the Second Intermediate Period, Minoan-style frescoes were found in Avaris. The most striking example of a politically driven change in artistic forms comes from the Amarna period, where figures were radically altered <b>to</b> <b>conform</b> <b>to</b> Akhenaten's revolutionary religious ideas. This style, known as Amarna art, was quickly and thoroughly erased after Akhenaten's death and replaced by the traditional forms.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, after India {{became a}} republic, the Indian Standards Institute (now the BIS) {{brought out the}} first {{official}} specifications for the flag. These were revised in 1964 <b>to</b> <b>conform</b> <b>to</b> the metric system which was adopted in India. The specifications were further amended on 17 August 1968. The specifications cover all the essential requirements of the manufacture of the Indian flag including sizes, dye colour, chromatic values, brightness, thread count and hemp cordage. The guidelines are covered under civil and criminal laws and defects in the manufacturing process can result in punishments that include fines or jail terms.|$|E
5|$|In The Political Demands of Isolated Indian Bands in British Columbia, Thomson {{points out}} the {{benefits}} in some level (albeit small) of separatist policies. He argues the benefits of allowing ethnic groups, like the Amish and the Hutterites in the United States and Canada or the Sami in Norway, {{to live on the}} edges of governance. These are ethnic groups that would prefer to retain their ethnic identity and thus prefer separatist policies for themselves, as they do not require them <b>to</b> <b>conform</b> <b>to</b> policies for all ethnicities of the nation.|$|E

5|$|Lucilla's guardian, Oliver Carleton, visits Bath to {{investigate}} her new living arrangements. Carleton is a rake– a sexually experienced man who refuses <b>to</b> <b>conform</b> <b>to</b> many of society's guidelines. His biting wit has {{earned him the}} label of rudest man in England, but he and Annis soon find mutual enjoyment in lively banter. As Carleton and Annis's friendship develops, they discover deeper feelings for each other. Carleton proposes marriage, but Annis refuses, unwilling to relinquish her independence. Using the excuse that he must find Lucilla a new guardian, Carleton returns to London.|$|E

The station also uses acoustic ceiling tiles to reduce noise, in addition to using indirect lighting. The station is also compliant with National Fire Protection Association standards, despite its extreme depth, {{as it can be}} evacuated in six minutes in case of fire, and the platform can be cleared within four minutes.|$|E
5|$|People {{struggled}} to survive together, and a rich culture based on shebeens (informal and mostly illegal pubs), mbaqanga music and beer-brewing developed. The shebeens {{were one of}} the main forms of entertainment. People came to the shebeens not only for skokiaan or baberton (illegally self-made alcoholic beverages), but to talk about their daily worries, their political ideas and their fears and hopes. In these shebeens the politicians tried to influence others and get them <b>to</b> <b>conform</b> <b>to</b> their form of thinking. If one disagreed he immediately became suspect and was classified as a police informer.|$|E

5|$|Researchers at Farmitalia soon {{discovered}} that changes in biological activity could be made by minor changes {{in the structure of}} the compound. A strain of Streptomyces was mutated using N-nitroso-N-methyl urethane, and this new strain produced a different, red-colored antibiotic. They named this new compound Adriamycin, after the Adriatic Sea, and the name was later changed to doxorubicin <b>to</b> <b>conform</b> <b>to</b> the established naming convention. Doxorubicin showed better activity than daunorubicin against mouse tumors, and especially solid tumors. It also showed a higher therapeutic index, yet the cardiotoxicity remained.|$|E

Additionally, the Virginia Constitution now provides for a General Assembly session following a governor’s veto, and {{the right of the people}} to hunt, fish and harvest game is guaranteed. In 2006, Virginians passed an amendment limiting marriage to “unions between one man and one woman”. That has since been overturned by Obergefell v. Hodges (2015).|$|E

5|$|The World Science Festival {{was founded}} by Brian Greene, a Columbia University physics {{professor}} and author of several popular-science books (such as The Elegant Universe), and his wife, Emmy Award-winning television journalist Tracy Day. Inspired by {{a visit to the}} 2005 Festival della Scienza in Genoa, where Greene had been invited to speak, the two decided that founding a similar festival in New York City would be a unique opportunity to bring science to the wider public. As they envisioned it, such a festival would allow them to combine Greene's skills as a scientist and science communicator with Day's as a journalist and producer: the events were meant to be rooted in science, but also <b>to</b> <b>conform</b> <b>to</b> the production standards of professional TV or theater productions.|$|E
5|$|The most ideal {{food was}} that which most closely matched the humour of human beings, i.e. {{moderately}} warm and moist. Food should preferably also be finely chopped, ground, pounded and strained {{to achieve a}} true mixture of all the ingredients. White wine {{was believed to be}} cooler than red and the same distinction was applied to red and white vinegar. Milk was moderately warm and moist, but the milk of different animals was often believed to differ. Egg yolks were considered to be warm and moist while the whites were cold and moist. Skilled cooks were expected <b>to</b> <b>conform</b> <b>to</b> the regimen of humoral medicine. Even if this limited the combinations of food they could prepare, there was still ample room for artistic variation by the chef.|$|E
5|$|The move to Hafeld {{coincided with}} the onset of intense father-son {{conflicts}} caused by Hitler's refusal <b>to</b> <b>conform</b> <b>to</b> the strict discipline of his school. Alois Hitler's farming efforts at Hafeld ended in failure, and in 1897 the family moved to Lambach. The eight-year-old Hitler took singing lessons, sang in the church choir, and even considered becoming a priest. In 1898 the family returned permanently to Leonding. Hitler was deeply affected by the death of his younger brother Edmund, who died in 1900 from measles. Hitler changed from a confident, outgoing, conscientious student to a morose, detached boy who constantly fought with his father and teachers.|$|E
