5|$|On June 6, 1944, and afterward, {{most of the}} American {{airborne}} landings in Normandy {{were flown}} into areas that were not studded with Rommelspargel. Some flights, however, came up hard against the defense. Accompanying the 82nd Airborne Division, Tito Moruza landed on D-Day with orders to don civilian clothing and make his way to Paris to seize Gestapo papers. His glider hit a wooden pole defense which <b>tore</b> <b>into</b> the three soldiers sitting next to him, mortally wounding them. More casualties were inflicted during delivery of glider infantry reinforcements when some 16–18 gliders landed {{in a field of}} Rommelspargel and the troops that crawled from the wrecked gliders were immediately targeted by German small arms fire. Of 250 troops landing, some 50–60 survived.|$|E
5|$|At this {{juncture}} Richard saw Henry at some distance behind his main force. Seeing this, Richard decided {{to end the}} fight quickly by killing the enemy commander. He led a charge of mounted men around the melee and <b>tore</b> <b>into</b> Henry's group; several accounts state that Richard's force numbered 800–1000knights, but Ross says it was more likely that Richard was accompanied only by his household men and closest friends. Richard killed Henry's standard-bearer Sir William Brandon in the initial charge and unhorsed burly John Cheyne, Edward IV's former standard-bearer, with {{a blow to the}} head from his broken lance. French mercenaries in Henry's retinue related how the attack had caught them off guard and that Henry sought protection by dismounting and concealing himself among them to present less of a target. Henry made no attempt to engage in combat himself.|$|E
5|$|There {{was little}} warning in New Richmond. The tornado was {{completely}} illuminated by lightning, {{but it was}} visible {{for only a few}} minutes before it reached the town, as the view was largely obstructed by buildings and large trees. Initially, several of the town's residents recalled hearing a faint rumble in the distance which many mistook for the sound of a passing train. Before long the tornado became more visible, and those who did come to realize the danger approaching began to alert those around them, and panic ensued in the streets as people scrambled to take shelter. Despite the best efforts of the storm's early spotters, a great many of the town's residents were not fully aware of the oncoming storm until it was almost upon them. Shortly after 6 PM, the tornado <b>tore</b> <b>into</b> the southwest corner of the city. This neighborhood was where many of the town's wealthiest and most influential residents lived, many of them having first come to the area as pioneers from New England in the 1850s. They included the owners of some of New Richmond's most prominent businesses, residing in stately homes built in styles derived from those seen back east. Within a few moments, as many as fifty homes were leveled in this area.|$|E

25|$|Ibn Ishaq {{writes that}} during the siege, the Qurayza readmitted Huyayy ibn Akhtab, {{the chief of the}} Banu Nadir whom Muhammad had exiled and who had instigated the {{alliance}} of his tribe with the besieging Quraysh and Ghatafan tribes. According to Ibn Ishaq, Huyayy persuaded the Qurayza chief Ka'b ibn Asad to help the Meccans conquer Medina. Ka'b was, according to Al-Waqidi's account, initially reluctant to break the contract and argued that Muhammad never broke any contract with them or exposed them to any shame, but decided to support the Meccans after Huyayy had promised to join the Qurayza in Medina if the besieging army would return to Mecca without having killed Muhammad. Ibn Kathir and al-Waqidi report that Huyayy <b>tore</b> <b>into</b> pieces the agreement between Ka'b and Muhammad.|$|E

500|$|On 21 July 1875, Jeanne d'Arc was {{participating}} in a naval exercise involving six ironclads – the broadside ironclad , operating as the flagship, and five [...] central battery ironclads including Jeanne d′Arc – {{and a number of}} smaller ships in the Tyrrhenian Sea off the east coast of Corsica [...] The ironclads were steaming in beautiful weather at [...] in two parallel columns, with Magenta leading one column, followed by Jeanne d′Arc and , and [...] leading the other, followed by [...] and , when at 12:00 noon the admiral commanding the squadron ordered the screw corvette , operating as a dispatch vessel, to pass astern of Magenta to receive orders. Attempting to place his ship in the column between Magenta and Jeanne d′Arc, the commanding officer of Forfait misjudged his turn, and Jeanne d′Arc collided with Forfait. The impact was barely noticeable aboard Jeanne d′Arc, but her ram bow <b>tore</b> <b>into</b> Forfaits side. Forfait sank 14 minutes later, her crew of 160 taking safely to her boats; her commanding officer floated free from the bridge as Forfait sank beneath him, but also was rescued.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the ensuing}} running fight, the PBY fared badly. On one pass, the fighter's cannon shells <b>tore</b> <b>into</b> the plane's {{gasoline}} tank; and the volatile fuel spilled from the ruptured area. On another pass, the fighter's fire ignited the gasoline {{and set the}} Catalina ablaze. Christman headed for the water to land and abandon ship; two men, Radiomen 2 Class Landers and Bangust, bailed out at 300 feet while Christman and his second and third pilots rode the plane down. Waterman, after manning his single [...]30-caliber machine gun with great dexterity, had been mortally wounded, probably in the fighter's last pass.|$|E

Blake was saved from complete annihilation by the self-sacrifice of a lone battalion of regular troops from Navarre which stood its ground against the swarming cavalry, keeping the French at bay while Blake's half of the army made good its escape over the Sequillo river.|$|E

2500|$|Queen Maedbdh's {{army had}} {{set off in}} the same {{direction}} towards Barrooskey but to their surprise they met opposition from small bands of the Gamhanraidh tribes who popped out of every crevice along the way, attacking the retreating troops trying to return to Cruachan. [...] There were so many of these attacks that while the army was still in the Glenamoy hills, the melee turned into a full-scale battle again. [...] The indomitable Gamhanraidh made a grotesque pile of Irish warrior heads on the ground. [...] At this stage, Domhnall from Glencastle arrived on the scene again with a new army which consisted of vicious wolf hounds. [...] Their handlers released the dogs and they <b>tore</b> <b>into</b> Maedbh's amy tearing the soldiers limb from limb. Then Fergus came in face to face combat with Domhnall Duabhuidhe and he died at Glenamoy by the sword of Fergus. [...] More troops to support the Gamhanraidh were coming to the scene from Croagh Patrick. [...] After the death of his grandfather, Muireadhach, known as Muireadhach the Stutterer, became the leader of the Gamhanraidh and continued the attack on Maedbdh's troops until he recovered Flidhais and her Maol. [...] Some versions relate that Muireadhach later married Flidhais, others that she lived out {{the rest of her life}} in obscurity.|$|E
