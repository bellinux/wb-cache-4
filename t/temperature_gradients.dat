5|$|A surface weather {{analysis}} {{is a type}} of weather map that depicts positions for high and low-pressure areas, as well as various types of synoptic scale systems such as frontal zones. Isotherms can be drawn on these maps, which are lines of equal temperature. Isotherms are drawn normally as solid lines at a preferred temperature interval. They show <b>temperature</b> <b>gradients,</b> which can be useful in finding fronts, which are on the warm side of large <b>temperature</b> <b>gradients.</b> By plotting the freezing line, isotherms can be useful in determination of precipitation type. Mesoscale boundaries such as tropical cyclones, outflow boundaries and squall lines also are analyzed on surface weather analyses.|$|E
5|$|In {{the classic}} {{analysis}} by Edward Lorenz (the Lorenz Energy Cycle), extratropical cyclones (so-called atmospheric transients) {{acts as a}} mechanism in converting potential energy that is created by pole to equator <b>temperature</b> <b>gradients</b> to eddy kinetic energy. In the process, the pole-equator temperature gradient is reduced (i.e. energy is transported poleward to warm up the higher latitudes).|$|E
5|$|Weather {{maps are}} used to display {{information}} quickly showing the analysis of various meteorological quantities at various levels of the atmosphere, {{in this case the}} surface layer. Maps containing station models aid in the drawing of isotherms, which more readily identifies <b>temperature</b> <b>gradients,</b> and can help in the location of weather fronts. Two-dimensional streamlines based on wind speeds show areas of convergence and divergence in the wind field, which are helpful in determining the location of features within the wind pattern. A popular type of surface weather map is the surface weather analysis, which plots isobars to depict areas of high pressure and low pressure.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a <b>temperature</b> <b>gradient</b> based method for device state evaluation, taking the insulated Gated Bipolar Transistor (IGBT) modules {{as an example}} investigation. Firstly, theoretical basis of this method is presented and the results from example calculation on <b>temperature</b> <b>gradient</b> indicate that the increased thermal resistance and power loss of IGBT modules would increase the <b>temperature</b> <b>gradient.</b> Then an electrical-thermal- mechanical finite element method (FEM) model of IGBT modules, which takes the material temperature-dependent characteristic into account, is utilized to estimate the <b>temperature</b> <b>gradient</b> distribution for both healthy and fatigue conditions. It is found that the <b>temperature</b> <b>gradient</b> varies with power loss. Furthermore, both the experimental and simulation investigation on the <b>temperature</b> <b>gradient</b> for different conditions were conducted, and it is concluded that the <b>temperature</b> <b>gradient</b> can not only track the change of power loss, but have a better sensitivity compared with temperature distribution. In addition, the <b>temperature</b> <b>gradient</b> can reflect the defects location and distinguish failures degree. In the end the influence on the <b>temperature</b> <b>gradient</b> distribution caused by solder fatigue, void and delamination are discussed...|$|R

5|$|The {{development}} of tropical cyclones in the Mediterranean Sea can usually only occur under somewhat unusual circumstances. Low wind shear and atmospheric instability induced by incursions {{of cold air}} are often required. A majority of medicanes are also accompanied by upper-level troughs, providing energy required for intensifying atmospheric convection—thunderstorms—and heavy precipitation. The baroclinic properties of the Mediterranean region, with high <b>temperature</b> <b>gradients,</b> also provides necessary instability {{for the formation of}} tropical cyclones. Another factor, rising cool air, provides necessary moisture as well. Warm sea surface temperatures (SSTs) are mostly unnecessary, however, as most medicanes' energy is derived from warmer air temperatures. When these favorable circumstances coincide, the genesis of warm-core Mediterranean tropical cyclones, often from within existing cut-off cold-core lows, is possible in a conducive environment for formation.|$|E
5|$|A {{weather map}} {{displays}} various meteorological features across {{a particular area}} at a particular point in time and has various symbols which all have specific meanings. Such maps have been in use since the mid-19th century and are used for research and weather forecasting purposes. Maps using isotherms show <b>temperature</b> <b>gradients,</b> which can help locate weather fronts. Isotach maps, analyzing lines of equal wind speed, on a constant pressure surface of 300 or 250hPa show where the jet stream is located. Use of constant pressure charts at the 700 and 500hPa level can indicate tropical cyclone motion. Two-dimensional streamlines based on wind speeds at various levels show areas of convergence and divergence in the wind field, which are helpful in determining the location of features within the wind pattern. A popular type of surface weather map is the surface weather analysis, which plots isobars to depict areas of high pressure and low pressure. Cloud codes are translated into symbols and plotted on these maps along with other meteorological data that are included in synoptic reports sent by professionally trained observers.|$|E
5|$|After a {{star has}} formed, it generates thermal {{energy in the}} dense core region through nuclear fusion of {{hydrogen}} atoms into helium. During {{this stage of the}} star's lifetime, it is located along the main sequence at a position determined primarily by its mass, but also based upon its chemical composition and other factors. All main-sequence stars are in hydrostatic equilibrium, where outward thermal pressure from the hot core is balanced by the inward pressure of gravitational collapse from the overlying layers. The strong dependence of the rate of energy generation in the core on the temperature and pressure helps to sustain this balance. Energy generated at the core makes its way to the surface and is radiated away at the photosphere. The energy is carried by either radiation or convection, with the latter occurring in regions with steeper <b>temperature</b> <b>gradients,</b> higher opacity or both.|$|E

40|$|The {{relationship}} between eddy heat flux and <b>temperature</b> <b>gradient</b> is studied. Correlations between the vertically-integrated total eddy heat flux and the <b>temperature</b> <b>gradient</b> are calculated {{for both the}} hemispheres using NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data. The results showed that, differently from the Northern Hemisphere (NH), in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) {{there is a large}} difference whether the vertically-integrated eddy heat flux is correlated with the <b>temperature</b> <b>gradient</b> at 1000 hPa, or with the vertically-integrated <b>temperature</b> <b>gradient.</b> The correlations are high and positive in both cases in the NH, as noted in earlier studies. However, in the SH when the vertically-integrated total eddy heat flux is corre-lated with the <b>temperature</b> <b>gradient</b> at 1000 hPa, there is a region in the middle latitudes where the correlations are highly negative. When the vertically-integrated <b>temperature</b> <b>gradient</b> is used, rather than the <b>temperature</b> <b>gradient</b> at 1000 hPa, the correlations are positive in both hemispheres. This in-dicates {{that it is necessary to}} use vertically-integrated temperature for obtaining the relation between eddy heat flux and <b>temperature</b> <b>gradient</b> in the case of the SH.

40|$|Abstract—A stack {{with a small}} {{critical}} <b>temperature</b> <b>gradient</b> {{is desirable}} for a standing wave thermoacoustic engine to obtain a low onset temperature difference (the minimum temperature difference to start engine’s self-oscillation). The viscous and heat relaxation loss in the stack determines the critical <b>temperature</b> <b>gradient.</b> In this work, a dimensionless critical <b>temperature</b> <b>gradient</b> factor is obtained based on the linear thermoacoustic theory. It is indicated that the impedance determines the proportion between the viscous loss, heat relaxation losses and the power production from the heat energy. It reveals {{the effects of the}} channel dimensions, geometrical configuration and the local acoustic impedance on the critical <b>temperature</b> <b>gradient</b> in stacks. The numerical analysis shows that there exists a possible optimum combination of these parameters which leads to the lowest critical <b>temperature</b> <b>gradient.</b> Furthermore, several different geometries have been tested and compared numerically.

5|$|An unusually severe Mediterranean {{tropical}} cyclone developed on 23September 1969 southeast of Malta, producing severe flooding. Steep pressure and <b>temperature</b> <b>gradients</b> above the Atlas mountain range were evident on 19September, {{a result of}} cool sea air attempting to penetrate inland; south of the mountains, a lee depression—a low-pressure area in a mountainous region—developed. Under the influence of mountainous terrain, the low initially meandered northeastward. Following the entry of cool sea air, however, it recurved to the southeast before transitioning into a Saharan depression associated with a distinct cold front by 22September. Along the front's path, desert air moved northward while cold air drifted in the opposite direction, and in northern Libya, warm arid air clashed with the cooler levant of the Mediterranean. The organization of the disturbance improved slightly further before emerging into the Mediterranean Sea on 23September, upon which the system experienced immediate cyclogenesis, rapidly intensifying while southeast of Malta as a cold-core cut-off low, and acquiring tropical characteristics. In western Africa, meanwhile, several disturbances converged toward Mauritania and Algeria, while the medicane recurved southwestward back toward the coast, losing its closed circulation and later dissipating.|$|E

40|$|The {{quark-gluon plasma}} (QGP) is an {{expanding}} fireball, with finite dimensions.

25|$|Hansen et al. 2015 found, {{that the}} {{shutdown}} or substantial slowdown of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), besides possibly contributing to extreme end-Eemian events, {{will cause a}} more general increase of severe weather. Additional surface cooling from ice melt increases surface and lower tropospheric <b>temperature</b> <b>gradients,</b> and causes in model simulations a large increase of mid-latitude eddy energy throughout the midlatitude troposphere.

For this method the special sample holders are designed in our laboratory. MEs are prepared in such a way that one surface is cooled and the other is heated, during the process. With the help of XRD analysis using Type-E orientation pattern and surface charge studies on magnetoelectrets, the two main causes Non uniform magnetic field and <b>temperature</b> <b>gradient</b> for the formation of magnetoelectrets (MEs), are authenticated experimentally...|$|R

25|$|In the kinetic theory, heat is {{explained}} in terms of the microscopic motions and interactions of constituent particles, such as electrons, atoms, and molecules. The immediate meaning of the kinetic energy of the constituent particles is not as heat. It is as a component of internal energy. In microscopic terms, heat is a transfer quantity, and is described by a transport theory, not as steadily localized kinetic energy of particles. Heat transfer arises from <b>temperature</b> <b>gradients</b> or differences, through the diffuse exchange of microscopic kinetic and potential particle energy, by particle collisions and other interactions.

25|$|Undercutting is {{when the}} weld reduces the {{cross-sectional}} thickness of the base metal. This type of defect reduces {{the strength of the}} weld and workpieces. One reason for this defect is excessive current, causing the edges of the joint to melt and drain into the weld; this leaves a drain-like impression {{along the length of the}} weld. Another reason is if a poor technique is used that does not deposit enough filler metal along the edges of the weld. A third reason is using an incorrect filler metal, because it will create greater <b>temperature</b> <b>gradients</b> between the center of the weld and the edges. Other causes include too small of an electrode angle, a dampened electrode, excessive arc length, and slow speed.|$|E
