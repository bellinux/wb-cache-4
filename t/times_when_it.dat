5|$|The {{river is}} known to have been used for {{shipping}} in Roman <b>times,</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> was navigable to Bodiam and possibly further upstream. There are records of small boats reaching Etchingham during Saxon and Norman periods. Stone for building Bodiam Castle was transported along the river in the fourteenth century, and iron was shipped from Newenden or Udiam in the sixteenth century. A century later, an iron store was erected at Udiam. Maytham Wharf served Rolvenden, while Tenterden was served by Small Hythe.|$|E

Debt, like certain vices, such as cigarette-smoking, have experienced <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> was considered sinful, {{and other times}} fashionable. Biblical references, like the Book of Deuteronomy, the Lord's Prayer, and sin-eating, are examined. The growth of debt {{is linked to the}} growth of the written media with the relationship symbolized by the Faustian contract with the devil.|$|E

25|$|The perp walk arose {{incidentally}} {{from the}} need to transport a defendant from a police station to court after arrest, and the general prohibition of prior restraint under the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment.

The nisse is a {{particularly}} well known legendary figure in Danish folklore, apparently dating back to pre-Christian <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> was believed there were household gods. Traditionally each farm had its own nisse living on the loft or in a stable. Dressed in grey with a pointed red cap, he was no taller than a 10-year-old boy. The nisse would be helpful if treated well, for instance by offering him a bowl of porridge with a clump of butter at night, but, failing good treatment, he could become quite troublesome and mean.|$|E

25|$|Unger has {{presented}} {{a number of}} general institutional proposals that aim to restructure the world trade regime and introduce new alternatives in the market economy. For international and global trade, Unger calls for the need to experiment with different property rights regimes, where multiple forms will coexist in the same market system and not be tied to individual property rights and contractual labor. Generally, rather than maximizing the free trade as the goal, Unger sees the need to build and open the world economy in way that reconciles global openness with national and regional diversification, deviation, heresy, and experiment, where {{the idea is to}} support alternatives by making the world safer for them. For national economies, he rejects the need to require the free flow of capital, for there are <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> may be necessary to restrict capital flows. Rather, he puts the emphasis on the free flow of people. Labor should be allowed to move freely throughout the world.|$|E
25|$|The heath and its {{surrounding}} area belong to those regions of the North German Plain in which the hunter culture of the Mesolithic era was superseded quite early on by Neolithic farmers. By about 3000 BC, during the Neolithic, large open areas appeared on the lightly undulating, sandy stretches of geest on Lüneburg Heath. This {{was a result of}} the intensive grazing of the sessile oak woods and the associated destruction of successive new stands of trees. These open areas became dominated by the common heather (Calluna vulgaris), a largely grazing-resistant species of plant. Nevertheless, oak and beech woods succeeded time and again in establishing themselves wherever man left areas of heath untended. Over {{a long period of time}} the region of Lüneburg Heath alternated between periods when the heathlands spread and dominated the scene and <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> was largely covered with forest and only small areas of heath existed. Finally, after the migration period, the wooded areas of the region increased considerably.|$|E

[...] The flood of inflationary greenback currency issued {{during the war}} made Rhodes and Company's dealings in the new confederation of Canada difficult; merchants would accept a dollar in paper money as the equivalent of 35 cents in gold. [...] Hanna hoped that Grant, who was elected, would institute policies which would return full value to the currency. [...] The firm built many vessels and also gained interests {{in a wide variety}} of firms, which in turn used the Rhodes steamers.
