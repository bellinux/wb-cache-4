500|$|The {{earliest}} {{remains of}} Homo sapiens {{date back to}} approximately 195 thousand years ago in eastern Africa. In the archaeological record of both eastern Africa and southern Africa, there is immense variability associated with Homo sapiens sites, and it is during this <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> see evidence {{of the origins of}} modern human behavior. According to McBrearty and Brooks, there are four features that are characteristic of modern human behavior: abstract thinking, the ability to plan and strategize, [...] "behavioral, economic and technological innovativeness," [...] and symbolic behavior. Many of these aspects of modern human behavior can be broken down into more specific categories, including art, personal adornment, technological advancement, yet these four overarching categories allow for a thorough, albeit significantly overlapping, discussion of behavioral modernity.|$|E

500|$|Apart {{from the}} final track, [...] "Mørket's Grøde", and the {{instrumental}} [...] "Tilflukt", all song lyrics are written in English. Zuza Steck of the Polish magazine Musick Magazine noted the [...] "unblack" [...] - Christian - message of the lyrics and how Antestor demonstrates that a band can maintain an extreme atmosphere but take a different lyrical approach. Antestor expounded on the lyrical themes that [...] "at the same <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are Christians, we are also humans. I think almost everyone can relate to parts of our music and lyrics, for absolutely everyone – Christians and non-believers alike – experience hard and terrible times. The Lord does not say we will not meet hard times as Christians, but that He {{will be with us}} and carry us through it, and that {{is a big part of}} the Antestor message." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{theme of}} A Flash Flood of Colour is {{politically}} progressive. The album's treatment of current affairs {{and environmental issues}} takes aim [...] "at the failings of capitalism, the hypocrisy of modern politics and the blatant disregard of human health and happiness" [...] and {{has been compared to}} the calculated approach of the Occupy movement, rather than an ensuing class conflict. Despite its political themes, Reynolds denied that the album was politically motivated: [...] "This album is anti-politics. We say that politics is an outdated system. It is <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> embrace technological developments and no longer have to rely on a rule. Our lives should develop according to scientific findings." [...] He described A Flash Flood of Colours recurring theme as [...] "perspective": [...] "We're not trying to think subjectively." [...] The Real News, Democracy Now! and journalist John Pilger have all influenced Reynolds' political views.|$|E

[...] Despite these doubts, the favorable view of Johnson survived for a time. In 1942, Van Heflin portrayed the former president as a fighter for democracy in the Hollywood film Tennessee Johnson. In 1948, a poll of his colleagues by historian Arthur M. Schlesinger deemed Johnson among the average presidents; in 1956, one by Clinton L. Rossiter named {{him as one of}} the near-great Chief Executives. Foner notes {{that at the time of}} these surveys, [...] "the Reconstruction era that followed the Civil War was regarded as a time of corruption and misgovernment caused by granting black men the right to vote".|$|E

We shall be fighting at our own back door. That {{is what we have}} to prepare for." [...] In August that year he was transferred to the 4th Light Horse Regiment at Warrnambool, Victoria, as adjutant/quartermaster. Garrett was posted to the staff of Army Headquarters, Melbourne, in March 1936, and departed for England in November the following year to attend the Staff College, Camberley. He was promoted to major in July 1938, and returned to Australia upon the outbreak of the Second World War.|$|E
500|$|Heller was {{responsible}} for writing the episode's voice-over, despite his dislike of the task. He said that despite it being his [...] "400th version," [...] he was [...] "still not happy with it." [...] He believed that an early scene in which spoils are distributed from a cart in front of Pompey represented the first real sense of how the series would depict city life. He said, [...] "I {{think this is the}} first <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> get sense of the version of Rome that the show is pushing," [...] which was a very different version than viewers may have been used to. To him, Rome was [...] "colorful and painted" [...] and cosmopolitan. A later scene featuring Cicero the Younger in the Senate proved difficult to film because of the large number of Italian extras who did not speak English. In the DVD audio commentary, he said that [...] "this is one of those scenes where you need really great assistant directors, because all of these Italian extras who have no idea whatsoever what [...] saying, so to keep them interested and focused and concentrated on what's going on is a real trick." ...|$|E

O'Connell called it [...] "powerful" [...] and said it [...] "sets the mood" [...] for the album. One day during rehearsals, Fazzi played a guitar riff, then O'Connell played along, {{resulting}} in [...] "Sink into Me." [...] The song begins with cheerleader-esque [...] "hey!"s that Fazzi came up with. Lazzara referred to it as a [...] "freight train. ... if you were {{to stand in front of}} it, you would get pummeled". Lazzara also mentioned that the music to it was [...] "unlike anything we've ever done before. It's real upbeat." [...] For [...] "Lonely, Lonely," [...] Lazzara said it was the [...] "first <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> just turned it up to ten and went with it". With this song, Fazzi said the group wanted something [...] "short, to the point and just punishing from start to finish". The song's bridge had been suggested by Fazzi during his audition for the band. Rubano said the track was [...] "a freight train of rock & roll" [...] and was inspired by Queens of the Stone Age. [...] "Summer, Man" [...] was one of the first songs written for New Again. It was composed during the Projekt Revolution tour, and consisted originally of a bridge guitar riff by Reyes. Rubano said it was the band's take on a Beach Boys-esque song.|$|E

500|$|Rater {{noted that}} the balance Meredith had just found in her life, finally having a chance at {{happiness}} with the man she loves, is shaken by her mother's unexpected lucidity, which was stated to have been written in the series in order to remind Meredith about the troubled years of her growing up: [...] "If Meredith {{is ever going to}} be happy, she's got to {{deal with the fact that}} she had a really terrible childhood." [...] In addition, Rater explained that Ellis' [...] "awful, raw, ugly and terrible" [...] statements towards her daughter were intended to make everyone realize the reason behind Meredith's alcoholism in college and her continuous one-night stands with inappropriate men. She also deemed Pompeo's performance in the episode [...] "exceptional", describing what she regarded an [...] "exceptional moment" [...] which sees Meredith stand up to her mother. In response to the scene that sees Ellis interacting with Webber, Rater wrote that it is the first time she lets her guard down, exposing the previously hidden vulnerability, which allows her express the desire to be as happy and ordinary as her daughter. She also praised the performances of the cast, by deeming their acting [...] "remarkable". [...] "That is really what it's all about. We have to cherish the <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have here, and love the people who surround and support us, even if they make us crazy, because things happen. Brain surgery, Alzheimer's and weddings. And the worst thing is to come to the end of your life, and realize, like Ellis, that you should have tried harder", stated Rater, putting the emphasis on the main aspects of the episode, characterizing it as [...] "not ordinary".|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} to [...] "Sunshine Days" [...] was mixed. Aaron Kinney from Salon {{magazine was}} critical of the producers' idea to air the entry as the penultimate episode {{leading up to the}} heavily-promoted series finale. Kinney pointed out that the episode {{had little to do with}} the show's overarching storyline, but it was nevertheless touted as part of The X-Files [...] "Endgame" [...] promotion strategy. Jessica Morgan from Television Without Pity gave the episode a mixed review and awarded it a [...] "C" [...] grade. She sarcastically wrote, [...] "nine years of mytharc to start to wrap up. And so the penultimate episode of The X-Files, naturally, is devoted to The Brady Bunch." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode three-and-a-half stars out of five. The two noted that the episode [...] "is not one of Gilligan's very best stories", citing issues with its tone and its characterization of Oliver Martin. The two, however, did praise Gilligan's humanized style, writing, [...] "he gives Scully the proof of the paranormal she's been needing" [...] but shows that the most important [...] "things to care about in life" [...] are [...] "humans". John Keegan from Critical Myth gave the episode a moderately positive review and awarded it a 7 out of 10. He wrote, [...] "Overall, this was a pleasant yet bittersweet episode, one that leaves the characters in relative peace. It is the first <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> get a glimpse of what the writers are thinking as the series comes to a close. Now all that's left is the mythology, which I can only hope will end on a similarly pleasant note." [...] M.A. Crang, in his book Denying the Truth: Revisiting The X-Files after 9/11, said that [...] "the central story falls a bit flat", but the episode worked well as a [...] "paean to medium of television itself" [...] and he felt it was an appropriate vehicle for the series' penultimate installment.|$|E
