5|$|In {{an effort}} to cut costs, the Kentucky State Police {{announced}} in May 2009 that it would only offer the state driving test in English beginning June 1, 2009. The test had previously been offered in 22 foreign languages, but the state police said that the foreign language versions of the test had not been updated to reflect recent changes to driving laws. Two days later, Beshear announced the reversal of the state police's new policy, saying he was not informed of it and believed it was <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> do. He promised the foreign language versions of the test would be updated and {{would continue to be}} offered.|$|E
5|$|The series {{focuses on}} the adventures of the dark-haired Valérian, a spatio-temporal agent, and his redheaded female colleague, Laureline, as they travel the {{universe}} through space and time. Valérian is a classical hero, kind, strong and brave who follows the orders of his superiors even if he feels, deep down, that it is <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> do. On the other hand, his partner Laureline combines her superior intelligence, determination and independence with sex-appeal. Influenced by classic literary science fiction, the series mixes space opera with time travel plots. Christin's scripts are noted for their humour, complexity and strongly humanist and left-wing liberal political ideas while Mézières' art is characterized by its vivid depictions of the alien worlds and species Valérian and Laureline encounter on their adventures. The series is considered a landmark in European comics and pop culture, and influenced other media as well: traces of its concepts, storylines and designs {{can be found in}} science fiction films such as Star Wars and The Fifth Element.|$|E

The {{evidence}} collected by the prosecution did not allow to establish a direct or indirect role of the accused in the crime. The Court concluded, however, that De Mauro most likely had been killed because he knew the secrets of Enrico Mattei's death, rather than the Borghese coup attempt. De Mauro’s disappearance and likely death {{remains one of the}} unsolved mysteries in Italian history.

The incident made Johnson want to exert his anger physically. Johnson later said, [...] "I lost something, a huge part of me....Fighting was my way of not dealing with my dad's passing. Now that I think of it, of course, it was <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> do, especially putting all that burden on my mom having to deal with it."

500|$|In the end, {{none of the}} {{senators}} was charged with any crime. Instead, the Senate Ethics Committee investigated them. [...] Robert S. Bennett, who was the special investigator for the committee, wanted to drop any action against McCain and Senator John Glenn, {{on the grounds of}} insufficient evidence, but the committee disagreed. [...] After public hearings, McCain was mildly rebuked by the committee for exercising [...] "poor judgment" [...] in intervening with the federal regulators on Keating's behalf, but its 1991 report said that McCain's [...] "actions were not improper nor attended with gross negligence and did not reach the level of requiring institutional action against him....Senator McCain has violated no law of the United States or specific Rule of the United States Senate." [...] (In later years, several retrospective accounts of the controversy reiterated a contention that McCain was included in the investigation primarily so that there would be at least one Republican target.) [...] On his Keating Five experience, McCain said: [...] "The appearance of it was wrong.

500|$|McCain became {{embroiled in}} a scandal during the 1980s, as one of five United States {{senators}} comprising the so-called Keating Five. Between 1982 and 1987, McCain had received $112,000 in lawful political contributions from Charles Keating Jr. and his associates at Lincoln Savings and Loan Association, along with trips on Keating's jets that McCain belatedly repaid, in 1989. In 1987, McCain {{was one of the}} five senators whom Keating contacted in order to prevent the government's seizure of Lincoln, and McCain met twice with federal regulators to discuss the government's investigation of Lincoln. In 1999, McCain said: [...] "The appearance of it was wrong. It's a wrong appearance when a group of senators appear in a meeting with a group of regulators, because it conveys the impression of undue and improper influence. And it was <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> do." [...] In the end, McCain was cleared by the Senate Ethics Committee of acting improperly or violating any law or Senate rule, but was mildly rebuked for exercising [...] "poor judgment". In his 1992 re-election bid, the Keating Five affair was not a major issue, and he won handily, gaining 56percent of the vote to defeat Democratic community and civil rights activist Claire Sargent and independent former governor, Evan Mecham.|$|E

It would have been <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> do." [...] The success of Lewis's debut album Spirit ensured that the debut albums of future series winners (such as series 4 winner Leon Jackson) would consist more of new material than of cover versions. Series 10 winner Sam Bailey, however, released her debut album of covers, The Power of Love, in March 2014, just three months after winning - the earliest ever debut album release by an X Factor winner.|$|E
