5|$|The {{conflict}} between Pistrucci and William Wyon {{continued into the}} late 1840s, and sometimes featured in the press, contributing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> that all was not well at the Mint. A Royal Commission on reform of the Royal Mint was appointed in 1848. Pistrucci submitted a report, in which he settled some old scores. The reforms abolished the positions of chief engraver (Wyon died in 1851) and chief medallist, with Pistrucci appointed a modeller and engraver to the Mint, to receive a salary in addition to payment for any work done.|$|E
5|$|The High Middle Ages was {{a period}} of great {{religious}} movements. Besides the Crusades and monastic reforms, people sought to participate in new forms of religious life. New monastic orders were founded, including the Carthusians and the Cistercians. The latter especially expanded rapidly in their early years under the guidance of Bernard of Clairvaux (d. 1153). These new orders were formed in response <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> of the laity that Benedictine monasticism no longer met the needs of the laymen, who along with those wishing to enter the religious life wanted a return to the simpler hermetical monasticism of early Christianity, or to live an Apostolic life. Religious pilgrimages were also encouraged. Old pilgrimage sites such as Rome, Jerusalem, and Compostela received increasing numbers of visitors, and new sites such as Monte Gargano and Bari rose to prominence.|$|E

25|$|In {{common with}} the music traditions of other Asian cultures, such as Persia and India, one strand of {{traditional}} Chinese music consists of a repertoire of traditional melodies, together known as qupai, in which tempo and ornamentation {{vary according to the}} mood of the instrumentalist, the audience, and their reaction to what is being played, the same melody can be used to serve many different roles be it merry, melancholic or martial (this can be glimpsed in the love theme of the Butterfly Lovers' Violin Concerto where the same melody at different points in the lover's story reflects elation, turbulence and dejection). Many modern performers now play pieces by following a score in a standard way rather than in the changeable reflective individual way of tradition, this can at times lead <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> that a performance has been rushed.|$|E
25|$|Many historians {{argue that}} the Compromise {{played a major role}} in postponing the American Civil War for a decade, while the Northwest was growing more wealthy and more populous and was being brought into closer {{relations}} with the Northeast. During that decade, the Whig Party had completely broken down, to be replaced with the new Republican Party dominant in the North and the Democrats in the South. Others {{argue that the}} Compromise only made more obvious the pre-existing sectional divisions and laid the groundwork for future conflict. They view the Fugitive Slave Law ad helping to polarize the US, as shown in the enormous reaction to Harriet Beecher Stowe's novel Uncle Tom's Cabin. The passage of the Fugitive Slave Law aroused feelings of bitterness in the North. Furthermore, the Compromise of 1850 led to a breakdown in the spirit of compromise in the United States in the antebellum period, directly before the Civil War. The Compromise exemplifies that spirit, but the deaths of influential senators who worked on the compromise, primarily Henry Clay and Daniel Webster, contributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> of increasing disparity between the North and South.|$|E
25|$|Every {{emotional}} response has a behavioral component, an autonomic component, and a hormonal component. The hormonal component includes {{the release of}} epinephrine, an adrenomedullary response that occurs in response to stress and that {{is controlled by the}} sympathetic nervous system. The major emotion studied in relation to epinephrine is fear. In an experiment, subjects who were injected with epinephrine expressed more negative and fewer positive facial expressions to fear films compared to a control group. These subjects also reported a more intense fear from the films and greater mean intensity of negative memories than control subjects. The findings from this study demonstrate that there are learned associations between negative feelings and levels of epinephrine. Overall, the greater amount of epinephrine is positively correlated with an arousal state of negative feelings. These findings can be an effect in part that epinephrine elicits physiological sympathetic responses including an increased heart rate and knee shaking, which can be attributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> of fear regardless of the actual level of fear elicited from the video. Although studies have found a definite relation between epinephrine and fear, other emotions have not had such results. In the same study, subjects did not express a greater amusement to an amusement film nor greater anger to an anger film. Similar findings were also supported in a study that involved rodent subjects that either were able or unable to produce epinephrine. Findings support the idea that epinephrine does have a role in facilitating the encoding of emotionally arousing events, contributing to higher levels of arousal due to fear.|$|E

[...] Baker helped to bring down an enemy plane {{for the first time in}} his career on May 21, but due to a complicated system of confirming kills, he was not given credit for it. In a letter home describing the battle, Baker said it was the [...] "biggest thrill I ever had in my life", and compared it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> after a big sports game. Throughout the spring of 1918 Baker continued to lead planes over the front, and continued to see Scott, although he began to have reservations over their future together due to the financial disparity between them. After his first confirmed kill on May 21, 1918, the French government awarded him the Croix de Guerre.|$|E
500|$|The {{stress of}} the project led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> {{there was not enough}} time or money to {{complete}} everything the team wished to, which added to the stress and caused arguments about the design of the game. The developers ended up reducing the overtime they spent on the project to avoid burning out, though it meant further delays and risked the company running out of money as the game neared completion. In a speech at the 16th annual D.I.C.E. Awards in 2013, Chen admitted that the company had indeed been driven to bankruptcy in the final months of development, and that some of the developers had gone unpaid at the time. Hunicke described the solution to finally finishing the game as learning to let go of tensions and ideas that could not make it into the game and be [...] "nice to each other".|$|E

Edge also called the red screen and sound effect that flashes upon the player's death [...] "brash and lo-fi and unexpectedly poignant", for which they noted Rogers's interest in noise rock and credited the effect as [...] "a beguiling personal signature". Alternatively, Paste Joe Bernardi thought the sound did not accomplish what it intended. Joseph Leray of TouchArcade noticed how the guitar sound in Gears of War was reaffirming but the opposite in Ziggurat. Edge noted that nuances such as gravity's influence on the arc of uncharged shots make Ziggurat more of a basketball or golf-like sport skill than a [...] "2D Halo". Edge awarded the game a 9 of 10, adding that it [...] "prized immediacy" [...] {{in a manner that}} matched the iOS platform.|$|E
500|$|The author Sheila Whiteley {{attributes}} Sgt. Pepper underlying philosophy {{not only}} to the drug culture, but also to metaphysics and the non-violent approach of the flower power movement. The musicologist Oliver Julien views the album as an embodiment of [...] "the social, the musical, and more generally, the cultural changes of the 1960s". The American psychologist and counterculture figure Timothy Leary contends that the LP [...] "gave a voice <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> that the old ways were over... it came along at the right time" [...] and stressed the need for cultural change based on a peaceful agenda. The album's primary value, according to Moore, is its ability to [...] "capture, more vividly than almost anything contemporaneous, its own time and place". Whiteley agrees, crediting the album with [...] "provid a historical snapshot of England during the run-up to the Summer of Love". Several scholars have applied a hermeneutic strategy to their analysis of Sgt. Pepper lyrics, identifying loss of innocence and the dangers of overindulgence in fantasies or illusions as the most prominent themes.|$|E
500|$|The {{score for}} the film was {{composed}} and conducted by Michael Kamen. Bird's original temp score, [...] "a collection of Bernard Herrmann cues from 50's and 60's sci-fi films," [...] initially scared Kamen. Believing {{the sound of the}} orchestra is important <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> of the film, Kamen [...] "decided to comb eastern Europe for an [...] "old-fashioned" [...] sounding orchestra and went to Prague to hear Vladimir Ashkenazy conduct the Czech Philharmonic in Strauss's An Alpine Symphony." [...] Eventually, the Czech Philharmonic was the orchestra used for the film's score, with Bird describing the symphony orchestra as [...] "an amazing collection of musicians." [...] The score for The Iron Giant was recorded in a rather unconventional manner, compared to most films: recorded over one week at the Rudolfinum in Prague, the music was recorded without conventional uses of syncing the music, in a method Kamen described in a 1999 interview as [...] " [...] play the music {{as if it were a}} piece of classical repertoire." [...] Kamen's score for The Iron Giant won the Annie Award for Music in an Animated Feature Production on November 6, 1999.|$|E
50|$|Many {{instances}} of interpersonal emotion regulation, {{such as those}} described above, are dyadic; in other words, they involve one person trying <b>to</b> influence <b>the</b> <b>feelings</b> of another person.

500|$|Reviewers commended the game's {{emphasis}} on discovery and freedom, but found {{its reliance on}} backtracking, particularly in the endgame, tedious. Parish of 1UP.com wrote that open-world action games like Metroid Prime all have these issues. Edge compared Fez esoteric tricks to an older age of game development that packed games with Easter eggs, secrets, and codes, citing titles such as Exile and Jet Set Willy. The magazine also came to appreciate the 3D map. IGN's Mitch Dyer contrasted the game's riddles to the Metal Gear Solid codec frequency puzzle. Jeffrey Matulef of Eurogamer related his experience <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> of first playing the 1994 Myst, and The New York Times called Fez [...] "a Finnegans Wake of video games" [...] for its codebreaking that [...] "makes the player feel like John Nash as portrayed by Russell Crowe in A Beautiful Mind". Game Informer recommended Fez for completionists who seek challenges. Polygon Gies was uncertain {{as to whether the}} game's technical frame rate issues were intentional, and described this dilemma as having a [...] "certain genius". Other reviewers noted its technical faults: Game Informer as minor, and 1UP.com as [...] "easily the glitchiest game I've played on my 360".|$|E
500|$|The {{reviewers for}} Famitsu were {{united in their}} opinion that, while not a revolutionary title within the series, it was a {{high-quality}} game. Eurogamer's Kristan Reed regularly noted its similarity to previous entries in the series, praising the atmosphere and gameplay, while criticizing the control scheme and its negative effect on combat and navigation. In {{a preview of the}} game, Richard Eisenbeis of Kotaku praised the game's multiple storylines and settings, but was mixed about its familiar gameplay and again criticized the controls. In closing, he generally cited it as a good entry in the series. Matthew Blundon of Nintendo Life, echoing the criticism of the controls, said that it would please hardcore horror game players. Albert Lichi of Cubed3 again faulted the control set up. In most other respects he was highly positive, praising the story, combat and graphics, calling it a [...] "labor of love" [...] {{on the part of the}} development team. In its import review, Edge Magazine generally enjoyed the unsettling atmosphere that the developers had succeeded in creating by using the dark settings and close-set camera angle. The reviewer also defended the often-criticized control scheme, saying that it added <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> of fear. In closing, the reviewer said that the subtlety of the game showed the flaws other horror franchises such as Silent Hill.|$|E
500|$|He has two {{abilities}} {{that the original}} Spider-Man did not have: the ability to camouflage himself, including his clothing, to match his surroundings, and a [...] "venom strike" [...] that can paralyze almost anyone with just a touch. The venom strike can be conducted through Miles' gloves, {{and can be used}} against an opponent at a distance by conducting it through a material in which both Miles and his opponent are in contact, such as the webbing of the Earth-616's Spider-Man. It can break chains being used to restrain Miles, and even repels non-ferrous objects, such as plastic Lego bricks. The venom strike is powerful enough to render unconscious a person as large as Hank Pym's Giant Man. It is powerful enough to drive away the symbiotic villain Venom during Miles' first encounter with the creature, but by their second encounter, Venom has developed such a tolerance to the strike that Miles has to be completely enveloped by the symbiote before the venom strike can separate the symbiote from its host. The effect of the venom strike manifests itself a few seconds after it is implemented, and is described by Bendis as being comparable <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> of being kicked in the testicles. Miles can effect a more powerful version of the strike, which he calls a [...] "mega venom blast". When Miles employs this ability, his eyes glow with yellow energy, which then explodes outwards in a radiant burst that can destroy thick ropes and chains that have been used to restrain him. This application of the strike cannot be used multiple times in rapid succession without a [...] "recharging" [...] period for Miles, though he can still make use of the conventional strike against people.|$|E
