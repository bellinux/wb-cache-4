Two minutes into the third quarter, Faloney intercepted a Bratkowski pass and returned it for a touchdown. Bratkowski {{was taken out of}} the game after numerous sacks by Stan Jones and Bob Morgan.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effects of natural circadian rhythms on retrieval-induced forgetting (RIF; Anderson et al. in J Exp Psychol Learn Mem Cogn 20 : 1063 - 1087, 1994). Individuals tested at optimal times (i. e., morning persons <b>tested</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning and evening persons <b>tested</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> evening) showed a significantly greater RIF effect than individuals tested at non-optimal times (i. e., morning persons <b>tested</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> evening and evening persons <b>tested</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning). Thus, the limited quantity of resources available to allocate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> inhibitory activity during non-optimal times produced a significant decrement in RIF. These findings are compatible with the inhibitory account of RIF and {{with the notion of}} a resource-demanding process underlying this memory phenomenon. © 2013 Marta Olivetti Belardinelli and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|R

He was the {{youngest}} member of the SA team that won the Sheffield Shield that season. A century against Victoria early the following season resulted in Chappell's selection for a one-off Test against Pakistan at Melbourne in December 1964. He made 11 and took four catches, but was dropped until the Fourth <b>Test</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1965–66 Ashes series. Chappell supplemented his aggressive batting with brilliant fielding in the slips, and he showed promise as a leg-spinner. At this point, the selectors and captain Bob Simpson considered him an all-rounder: he batted at number seven and bowled 26 (eight-ball) overs for the match.|$|E

40|$|Behavioral {{evidence}} suggests that the attention-based ability to regulate distraction varies across <b>the</b> day <b>in</b> synchrony with a circadian arousal rhythm that changes across the life span. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we assessed whether neural activity in an attention control network also varies across the day and with behavioral markers. We <b>tested</b> older adults <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning or afternoon and younger adults <b>tested</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> afternoon using a 1 -back task with superimposed distractors, followed by an implicit test for the distractors. Behavioral results replicated earlier findings with older adults <b>tested</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning better able to ignore distraction than those <b>tested</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> afternoon. Imaging results showed that time of testing modulates task-related fMRI signals in older adults and that age differences were reduced when older adults are tested at peak times of day. In particular, older adults <b>tested</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning activated similar cognitive control regions to those activated by young adults (rostral prefrontal and superior parietal cortex), whereas older adults <b>tested</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> afternoon were reliably different; furthermore, the degree to which participants were able to activate the control regions listed above correlated with the ability to suppress distracting information...|$|R

5|$|After the war, {{he resumed}} with Victoria, but faced {{a lot of}} {{competition}} for a place as an opening batsman in the Australian team. He played his only <b>Test</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1946-47 Ashes series at the Adelaide Oval, filling in for the injured Sid Barnes. Scoring 12 and 31, he partnered Arthur Morris in a second innings opening stand of 116. After a further two first-class seasons, Harvey retired after being dropped from Victoria's first-choice team. He ended with a record of 1,147 first-class runs at 38.23 in 22 matches. This included three centuries, and he captained Victoria five times, winning one matchthe rest were drawn. His career highlight was an innings of 136 in December 1946 against New South Wales, when he hooked a bouncer from Ray Lindwall into the MCG public bar and featured in a partnership of 271 with Keith Miller. His highest score was 163 against South Australia at Adelaide.

5|$|Constantine {{returned}} to the West Indies to face England (represented by the MCC as was usual in those days) in a four-match Test series early in 1930. The first Test was drawn; Constantine scored few runs, but bowled {{for a long time}} and fielded well. After the game, he was awarded a bat for his contribution. Calthorpe, the MCC captain, criticised his use of short-pitched bowling to a leg side field; one such ball struck Andy Sandham, but Constantine only reverted to more conventional tactics after a request from the MCC manager. During the second Test Constantine scored a rapid 58 and took six wickets, but the West Indies lost by 167 runs. In the following match the West Indies recorded their first win in Test matches; after centuries from George Headley and Clifford Roach, Constantine took four for 35 and five for 87 to secure the victory. Constantine was omitted from the final match in Jamaica, because inter-island politics meant that selectors tended to pick players from the island hosting the <b>Test.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> series, 29 players represented the West Indies and the team had a different captain in each match. In the three matches in which he played, Constantine scored 144 runs at 14.40 and took 18 wickets at 27.61.|$|E
5|$|Ex situ {{research}} (or off-site research) is also {{popular among}} researchers looking {{to answer questions}} {{that are difficult to}} <b>test</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> field. For example, efforts to sequence the genome of the gray mouse lemur will help researchers understand which genetic traits set primates apart from other mammals and will ultimately help understand what genomic traits set humans apart from other primates. One of the foremost lemur research facilities is the Duke Lemur Center (DLC) in Durham, North Carolina. It maintains the largest captive lemur population outside of Madagascar, which it maintains for non-invasive research and captive breeding. Many important research projects have been carried out there, including studies of lemur vocalizations, basic locomotor research, the kinematics of bipedalism, the effects of social complexity transitive reasoning, and cognition studies involving a lemur's ability to organize and retrieve sequences from memory. Other facilities, such as the Lemur Conservation Foundation, located near Myakka City, Florida, have also hosted research projects, such as one that looked at lemurs' ability to preferentially select tools based on functional qualities.|$|E
