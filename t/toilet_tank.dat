25|$|The side-float design uses a {{float on}} the end of a lever to control the fill valve. The float is usually shaped like a ball, so the {{mechanism}} is called a ball-valve or a ballcock. Cock is a term for valve; see, for example, stopcock. The float was originally made from copper sheet, but it is now usually plastic. The float is located to one side of the main valve tower at the end of a rod or arm. As the side-float rises, so does the side-float-arm. The arm connects to the fill valve that blocks the water flow into the <b>toilet</b> <b>tank,</b> and thus maintains a constant level in the tank.|$|E

The design proved to be very popular and efficient, and remains so to this day. Flushometer toilet flush valves are still often installed in commercial restrooms, and are frequently used for both toilets and urinals. Since they have no tank, they have zero recharge time, {{and can be used}} immediately by the next user of the toilet. They can be easily identified by their distinctive chrome pipe-work, and by the absence of a <b>toilet</b> <b>tank</b> or cistern, wherever they are employed.|$|E

2500|$|Leave It to Beaver {{is unique}} in 1950s {{television}} sitcom history for its extraordinary number of bathroom scenes. Beaver and Wally have an en-suite bathroom, and many scenes are set in it. One early episode, [...] "Child Care", is set almost entirely in their bathroom. Other episodes include major scenes set in the boys' bathroom. Additionally, in almost every scene set in the boys' bedroom, the bathtub, shower curtain, or vanity can be seen through the open bathroom door. Beaver uses the bathroom several times to escape his brother when angry, slamming the door to express his emotions. At such times, June and Ward {{are called upon to}} order Beaver to vacate his refuge. In [...] "Beaver's Good Deed", a scene is set in Ward and June's bathroom. A tramp takes a bath in their tub and slips away wearing one of Ward's suits and a pair of his shoes.

2500|$|Cheating {{can take}} the form of crib notes, looking over someone's {{shoulder}} during an exam, or any forbidden sharing of information between students regarding an exam or exercise. Many elaborate methods of cheating have been developed over the years. For instance, students have been documented hiding notes in the bathroom <b>toilet</b> <b>tank,</b> in the brims of their baseball caps, or up their sleeves. Also, the storing of information in graphing calculators, pagers, cell phones, and other electronic devices has cropped up since the information revolution began. While students have long surreptitiously scanned the tests of those seated near them, some students actively try to aid those who are trying to cheat. Methods of secretly signaling the right answer to friends are quite varied, ranging from coded sneezes or pencil tapping to high-pitched noises beyond the hearing range of most teachers. Some students have been known to use more elaborate means, such as using a system of repetitive body signals like hand movements or foot jerking to distribute answers (i.e. where a tap of the foot could correspond to answer [...] "A", two taps for answer [...] "B", and so on).|$|E
2500|$|When a user flushes a toilet, a [...] "toilet flapper valve" [...] (not to be {{confused}} with a type of check valve) opens and allows water from a reservoir tank to quickly enter the toilet bowl. This rapid influx from the tank causes the swirling water in the bowl to rapidly rise and fill the U-shaped inverted siphon tube mounted {{in the back of the}} toilet. This full siphon tube starts the toilet's siphonic action. The siphon action quickly (4–7 seconds) “pulls” nearly all of the water and waste in the bowl and the on-rushing tank water down the drain—it flushes. When most of the water has drained out of the bowl, the continuous column of water up and over the bottom of the upside-down U-shaped drain pipe (the siphon) is broken when air enters the siphon tube. The toilet then gives its characteristic gurgle as the siphonic action ceases and no more water flows out of the toilet. After flushing, the flapper valve in the water tank closes; water lines and valves connected to the water supply refill the <b>toilet</b> <b>tank</b> and bowl. Then the toilet is again ready for use.|$|E

2500|$|Legally in the UK, train {{operators}} {{are allowed to}} discharge up to 25 litres of untreated waste at a time on to the track. Most Mk3 carriages have no <b>toilet</b> <b>tanks,</b> discharging directly onto the track. In the 2000s both the RMT trade union and politicians were concerned at {{the environmental impact of}} this legacy issue. The problem was first raised in 2003 after Railtrack staff at [...] abandoned local clean-up and then track maintenance procedures due to an excessive buildup of sewage waste in the area. In 2006 the RMT agreed waste-tank and clean-out developments at Northern Rail's Heaton depot in 2006 with GNER, plus new clean-out procedures at all other depots, to solve an ongoing dispute over the previous 18 months. By 2011, the European Union had started a formal investigation to see whether trains composed of such carriages were breaking EU environmental and health laws, although the Environment Agency confirmed that train companies claimed special exemptions to dump waste along the tracks. In 2013, transport minister Susan Kramer branded the practice [...] "utterly disgusting" [...] and called on the industry to take action. ATOC responded by stating that, as all new vehicles had to be fitted with compliant <b>toilet</b> <b>tanks,</b> with withdrawal of the HSTs by the end of 2017 the problem would be solved. Unless the toilets are modernised, the cascading of stock onto other lines may continue this practice for many years after 2017 (see 'Replacements' section above).|$|R

5000|$|Building codes often contain {{specific}} {{sections on}} back siphonage {{and especially for}} external faucets (See the sample building code quote, below). Backflow prevention devices such as anti-siphon valves are required in such designs. The reason is that external faucets may be attached to hoses which may be immersed in an external body of water, such as a garden pond, swimming pool, aquarium or washing machine. In these situations the flow is not actually a siphon but suction due to reduced pressure on the water supply side. Should the pressure within the water supply system fall, the external water may be returned by back pressure into the drinking water system through the faucet. Another possible contamination point is the water intake in the <b>toilet</b> <b>tank.</b> An anti-siphon valve is also required here to prevent pressure drops in the water supply line from suctioning {{water out of the}} <b>toilet</b> <b>tank</b> (which may contain additives such as [...] "toilet blue") and contaminating the water system. Anti-siphon valves function as a one-direction check valve.|$|E

Research has shown that certain chemicals emanating from bacteria in water containers stimulate the female mosquitoes to lay their eggs. They are particularly motivated to lay eggs in water containers that have the correct amounts of specific fatty acids associated with bacteria involved in the degradation of leaves and other organic matter in water. The chemicals associated with the microbial stew are far more stimulating to discerning female mosquitoes than plain or filtered water in which the bacteria once lived. Once a week, scrub off eggs sticking to wet containers, seal and/or discard them.|$|R
