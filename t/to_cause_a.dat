5|$|A severe {{regression}} {{would have}} greatly reduced the continental shelf area, {{which is the}} most species-rich part of the sea, and therefore could have been enough <b>to</b> <b>cause</b> <b>a</b> marine mass extinction, however, research concludes that this change would have been insufficient to cause the observed level of ammonite extinction. The regression would also have caused climate changes, partly by disrupting winds and ocean currents and partly by reducing the Earth's albedo and therefore, increasing global temperatures.|$|E
5|$|About 20 {{minutes before}} the plane landed, on its final descent, he {{secretly}} ignited a small explosive device consisting of a mix of plastic explosive powder and acid. Abdulmutallab apparently had a packet of the plastic explosive sewn to his underwear, and injected liquid acid from a syringe into the packet <b>to</b> <b>cause</b> <b>a</b> chemical reaction. While {{there was a small}} explosion and fire, the device failed to detonate properly. Passengers heard popping noises resembling firecrackers, smelled an odor, and saw the suspect's pants, leg and the wall of the plane on fire.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{research}} complied by meteorologist and tornado expert Thomas P. Grazulis, the New Richmond Tornado was the first determined F/EF5 in American history <b>to</b> <b>cause</b> <b>a</b> death toll exceeding 100, as the rating for the Natchez tornado has never been officially determined and the St. Louis-East St. Louis tornado ranked as only an F/EF4. In addition, the Amite-Purvis, 1908 Dixie tornado outbreak and Gainesville, 1936 Tupelo–Gainesville tornado outbreak tornadoes have also both been classified as only F/EF4 tornadoes, making the New Richmond Tornado the fifth deadliest F/EF5 in American history.|$|E

5|$|Batista {{was left}} on his own {{as a result of}} The Legacy attacking Shane McMahon, but {{continued}} to challenge Orton for the WWE Championship. Orton and Batista had a match at Judgment Day, but it ended with Orton intentionally slapping the referee <b>to</b> <b>cause</b> <b>a</b> disqualification, which meant that the championship did not change hands. In their rematch, however, which was held inside a steel cage at the Extreme Rules pay-per-view, Batista won the championship.|$|E
5|$|By late December 1899, mining had {{compromised}} Joppenbergh's integrity enough <b>to</b> <b>cause</b> <b>a</b> {{series of}} landslides, {{followed by a}} large cave-in on December19. Four collapses occurred that day, beginning at 8AM, and culminating in the 11:30AM collapse of the Black Smoke Mine shaft network. Though it was initially believed that fifteen workers had been killed, the collapse happened while all 150 men were outside of the mountain, eating lunch.|$|E

He had {{suggested}} that MI6 was monitoring Diana before her death and that her driver on the night she died, Henri Paul, may have been an MI6 informant, and that her death resembled plans he saw during 1992 for the assassination of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milošević, using a bright light <b>to</b> <b>cause</b> <b>a</b> traffic accident.|$|E

5|$|Earth's {{atmosphere}} is very effective at absorbing high energy electromagnetic radiation such as x-rays and gamma rays, so {{these types of}} radiation would not reach any dangerous levels at the surface during the burst event itself. The immediate effect on life on Earth from a GRB within a few parsecs would only be a short increase in ultraviolet radiation at ground level, lasting from {{less than a second}} to tens of seconds. This ultraviolet radiation could potentially reach dangerous levels depending on the exact nature and distance of the burst, but it seems unlikely to be able <b>to</b> <b>cause</b> <b>a</b> global catastrophe for life on Earth.|$|E
5|$|Emma's ghost {{appears to}} Craven {{and tells him}} {{of a time when}} black flowers grew, warming the Earth and {{preventing}} life from becoming extinct. She tells him that the black flowers have returned and will melt the polar icecaps, destroying mankind so that life can continue. Craven goes to dissuade Jedburgh from the next step in his plan, which is <b>to</b> <b>cause</b> <b>a</b> nuclear explosion in Scotland {{with the rest of the}} plutonium. He succeeds, though the secret service follow him and kill Jedburgh. Craven, like Jedburgh and Grogan fatally exposed to radiation, wanders into the mountains to die, calling Emma's name. On the mountains, as Emma predicted, the black flowers are growing, foreshadowing the planet's war against humanity.|$|E
5|$|Even in {{the absence}} of close contact between {{humanity}} and extraterrestrials, high-information messages from an extraterrestrial civilization to humanity have the potential <b>to</b> <b>cause</b> <b>a</b> great cultural shock. Sociologist Donald Tarter has conjectured that knowledge of extraterrestrial culture and theology has the potential to compromise human allegiance to existing organizational structures and institutions. The cultural shock of meeting an extraterrestrial civilization may be spread over decades or even centuries if an extraterrestrial message to humanity is extremely difficult to decipher.|$|E

5|$|Fossil {{evidence}} shows the golden white-eye once also occurred on Tinian and Rota but was extirpated in those locations through {{the impact of}} human activities. Despite its current abundance on Saipan and Aguijan, {{and the fact that}} it has among the highest recorded densities for any bird, it is nevertheless considered to be critically endangered. It is threatened by the invasive brown tree snake, which has become established on nearby Guam, and this predator is expected <b>to</b> <b>cause</b> <b>a</b> rapid decline in the population if it reaches Saipan. Efforts are under way to control the snakes and breed the white-eye in zoos.|$|E

After scoring his 100th career goal, he recorded both his 100th assist and 200th point in a 5–4 victory over the Phoenix Coyotes on February 24, 2013. His season was ended prematurely by a knee injury after Anaheim's Ben Lovejoy stuck his leg out <b>to</b> <b>cause</b> <b>a</b> knee-on-knee collision.

5|$|GoldenEye (1995) is {{the seventeenth}} spy {{film in the}} James Bond series to be {{produced}} by Eon Productions, {{and the first to}} star Pierce Brosnan as the fictional MI6 officer James Bond. The film was directed by Martin Campbell and is the first in the series not to take story elements from the works of novelist Ian Fleming. The story was conceived and written by Michael France, with later collaboration by other writers. In the film, Bond fights to prevent an ex-MI6 agent, gone rogue, from using a satellite against London <b>to</b> <b>cause</b> <b>a</b> global financial meltdown.|$|E
5|$|GoldenEye 007 is a first-person shooter {{video game}} {{developed}} by Rare {{and based on}} the 1995 James Bond film GoldenEye. It was released for the Nintendo 64 video game console in August 1997. The game features a single-player campaign in which players assume the role of British Secret Intelligence Service agent James Bond as he fights to prevent a criminal syndicate from using a satellite weapon against London <b>to</b> <b>cause</b> <b>a</b> global financial meltdown. The game includes a split-screen multiplayer mode in which two, three, or four players can compete in different types of deathmatch games.|$|E

The lack of ship reports and incorrect information received from those that were received further complicated Debra's forecasts. However, due to its formation close to the coast, Debra had inadequate time <b>to</b> <b>cause</b> <b>a</b> greater storm surge. Debra's floods accounted for most of the month's rainfall.|$|E

5|$|In 1949, the Armour Research Foundation (ARF), {{based at}} the Illinois Institute of Technology, began {{studying}} the effects of nuclear explosions on the environment.

The main objective of the program, which ran {{under the auspices of}} the United States Air Force, which had initially proposed it, was <b>to</b> <b>cause</b> <b>a</b> nuclear explosion that would be visible from Earth.
