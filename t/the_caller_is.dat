5|$|Sridhar's {{computer}} data {{reveals a}} code, which when deciphered reveals Bhaskaran's phone number. Vidya calls Bhaskaran {{to tell him}} that she has retrieved sensitive documents from Sridhar's office. She asks Bhaskaran to help find her husband in exchange for the documents, but Bhaskaran tells her to contact the local police. Vidya soon gets a call from an unknown number however, warning her that she should hand over the documents to the caller if she wishes to see her husband alive. Khan thinks <b>the</b> <b>caller</b> <b>is</b> Milan Damji.|$|E
5|$|In a {{telephone}} network, <b>the</b> <b>caller</b> <b>is</b> {{connected to the}} person {{they want to talk}} to by switches at various telephone exchanges. The switches form an electrical connection between the two users and the setting of these switches is determined electronically when the caller dials the number. Once the connection is made, the caller's voice is transformed to an electrical signal using a small microphone in the caller's handset. This electrical signal is then sent through the network to the user at the other end where it is transformed back into sound by a small speaker in that person's handset.|$|E
25|$|The {{telephone}} triage {{system used}} within the communication centres is the internationally regarded Advanced Priority Medical Dispatch System {{also known as}} ProQA whereby <b>the</b> <b>caller</b> <b>is</b> interrogated to determine the most appropriate problem detriment to guide the level of response in terms of speed and clinical capability.|$|E

50|$|In 1992 AT&T {{introduced}} a 700 number service branded as AT&T EasyReach 700. It allowed subscribers to forward calls to their 700 number to any domestic phone number. It allowed either <b>the</b> <b>caller</b> or <b>the</b> subscriber {{to pay for}} the incoming calls. If <b>the</b> <b>caller</b> <b>was</b> calling from a phone not pre-subscribed to AT&T as its IXC, <b>the</b> <b>caller</b> <b>was</b> required to dial 10-ATT prior to dialing the 700 number. This service has since been discontinued.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the second}} call, <b>the</b> <b>caller</b> didn't say anything, but just breathed heavily. Manolo stayed quiet, also saying nothing. <b>The</b> <b>caller</b> then asked, [...] "You stay in silence, old faggot?". Manolo {{replied that he}} thought <b>the</b> <b>caller</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>caller's</b> mother, masturbating him, and then hung up.|$|R
25|$|By {{selecting}} this feature, {{the system}} will connect you to a call center, where a destination {{can be sent to}} your vehicle by an operator, which can be done while the vehicle is moving. Other information available includes current weather information, a search for restaurants as well as other features. If <b>the</b> <b>caller</b> <b>is</b> unsure of some of the details needed, the live operator can make suggestions or offer assistance in numerous categories.|$|E
25|$|Mobile phones {{generate}} additional {{problems for}} emergency operators, as many phones will allow emergency numbers to be dialed {{even while the}} keypad is locked. Since mobile phones are typically carried in pockets and small bags, the keys can easily be depressed accidentally, leading to unintended calls. A system has been developed in the UK to connect calls where <b>the</b> <b>caller</b> <b>is</b> sent to an automated system, leaving more operators free to handle genuine emergency calls.|$|E
25|$|Once a call via {{the local}} {{emergency}} number is placed, a dispatcher will answer {{and ask the}} caller {{about the nature of}} the emergency. Due to dual training in joint dispatch centers, the dispatcher is able to answer calls concerning both the fire department and EMS. While <b>the</b> <b>caller</b> <b>is</b> being interviewed about call specifics, the dispatcher is already working on the computer, which will provide prompt questions, provide advice, and suggest response resources for this emergency. This computer system, while operating in German, is extremely similar to the AMPDS algorithm used by Emergency Medical Dispatchers in the United States.|$|E
50|$|A year later, Maleeha calls a {{happily married}} Zara to wish her birthday. But {{when her husband}} (Humayun Saeed) asks who <b>the</b> <b>caller</b> <b>was,</b> Zara says {{that it was her}} class fellow rather than her best friend.|$|R
50|$|Most systems {{recognize}} {{location and}} listing. If recognition confidence is high, the best result <b>is</b> played to <b>the</b> <b>caller.</b> If confidence <b>is</b> low, <b>the</b> <b>caller's</b> request <b>is</b> played {{back to a}} live operator, who locates the correct listing.|$|R
50|$|Also in July, a Pranknet caller {{informed}} two hotel guests that deadly spiders {{were about}} to infest their room. <b>The</b> <b>caller</b> <b>was</b> able to manipulate the couple into breaking their window with the tank lid from their toilet.|$|R
500|$|On {{the way to}} the airport, Guddu realises that Sweety has faked her stutter. At a petrol station, Lobo and Lele {{notice the}} pair. Mistaking Guddu for Charlie, they arrest him. They assault Guddu, refusing to believe that he is Charlie's twin brother until Guddu's mobile phone rings; <b>the</b> <b>caller</b> <b>is</b> {{revealed}} to be Bhope. Lobo and Lele agree to exchange Charlie for Guddu and Sweety on a train. The policemen take Guddu and Sweety to Bhope's house, where Bhope reveals that a local builder will pay him [...] to marry Sweety to the builder's son. Guddu bargains with Bhopeif he retrieves the cocaine-filled guitar case for Bhope, he will get Sweety. Bhope sends his henchmen with Guddu to retrieve the guitar case from Charlie's house.|$|E

50|$|In January 2017, Ali lodged {{a police}} {{complaint}} for allegedly receiving a death threat {{in a phone}} call. He claimed that <b>the</b> <b>caller</b> <b>was</b> a Bengali from Dubai and had said that Ali would be killed for supporting the Trinamool Congress.|$|R
5000|$|In {{response}} to the complaints, the BBC said: [...] "The {{aim of the programme}} is to discuss and debate issues raised by our listeners. This was a live phone in and <b>the</b> <b>caller</b> <b>was</b> challenged on his views throughout the conversation".|$|R
2500|$|Lyrically, Bono {{described}} the song as [...] "a crank call from Hell... but [...] likes it there." [...] <b>The</b> <b>caller</b> <b>is</b> Bono's eponymous character, telling the listener {{what he learned}} in Hell. Bono sings part of the chorus in a falsetto, utilizing {{what he calls the}} [...] "Fat Lady" [...] voice, which he also uses on the songs [...] "Lemon" [...] and [...] "Numb." ...|$|E
2500|$|Legal scholars' main {{criticism}} of the decision was its failure to define [...] "testimonial". One of the main areas in which lower courts struggled {{to resolve this issue}} was the use of 911 calls during the course of trial where <b>the</b> <b>caller</b> <b>is</b> not available to testify. This was the factual situation in Davis v. Washington, in which the Court laid out a definition of [...] "testimonial." [...] Other cases have dealt with the issue of the previously common practice of admitting certain types of certified documents under the business records or public records exception to the hearsay rule.|$|E
2500|$|Withholding information, {{a form of}} {{tactical}} deception, can be costly to the deceiver. For example, rhesus monkeys discovering food announce their discoveries by calling on 45% of occasions. Discoverers who fail to call, but are detected with food by other group members, receive significantly more aggression than vocal discoverers. Moreover, silent female discoverers eat significantly less food than vocal females. Presumably because of such costs to deceivers, tactical deception occurs rather rarely. It {{is thought to be}} more common in forms and species where the cost of ignoring the possibly deceptive act is even higher than the cost of believing. For example, tufted capuchin monkeys sometimes emit false alarm calls. The cost of ignoring one of these calls could be death, which may lead to a [...] "better safe than sorry" [...] philosophy even when <b>the</b> <b>caller</b> <b>is</b> a known deceiver.|$|E
50|$|The {{precondition}} for any routine defines any constraints on object state which {{are necessary for}} successful execution. From the program developer's viewpoint, this constitutes <b>the</b> routine <b>caller's</b> portion of <b>the</b> contract. <b>The</b> <b>caller</b> then <b>is</b> obligated {{to ensure that the}} precondition holds prior to calling the routine. The reward for <b>the</b> <b>caller's</b> effort <b>is</b> expressed in the called routine's postcondition.|$|R

Alternatively, the player holding the Joker may play the Mighty card instead, {{if he or she}} holds it.|$|R
5000|$|... iPAC is {{the largest}} European event of its kind.

2500|$|For {{landline}} telephony, Australia is now geographically {{divided into}} four large areas, most of which cover more than one State and/or Territory. All [...] "Local" [...] telephone numbers within these four areas are of eight digits, consisting (mainly) of a four digit [...] "Exchange" [...] code plus a four digit number. The [...] "National 'Significant' Number" [...] consists of a single digit [...] "Area" [...] code followed by the [...] "Local" [...] eight digit number - a total of nine digits. Within Australia, to access the [...] "Number" [...] of a landline telephone in an [...] "Area" [...] other than that in which <b>the</b> <b>caller</b> <b>is</b> located (including a caller using a [...] "Mobile" [...] 'phone), firstly {{it is necessary to}} dial the Australian [...] "Trunk Access Code" [...] of 0 plus the [...] "Area" [...] code, followed by the [...] "Local" [...] Number.

6000|$|... "Suppose {{he calls}} on you to-morrow, and sends up his name with {{a request for}} an interview.

Suppose the servant knows him, and, sharing your professed opinion {{of the meaning of}} the word, replies 'He is a gentleman!' On the strength of that you will order him to be shewn in; and the moment you see him you will feel angry with your servant for deceiving you completely as to the sort of man you were to expect by using the word gentleman in what you call its true sense. Or reverse the case. Suppose <b>the</b> <b>caller</b> <b>is</b> your cousin, Mr. Marmaduke Lind, and your high-principled servant by mistaking the name or how not, causes you to ask the same question with respect to him. The answer will be that Mr. Marmaduke--being a scamp--is not a gentleman. You would be just as completely deceived as in the other case. No, Mr. Lind, you might as well say that this workman of mine is a true lord or a true prince as a true gentleman. A gentleman may be a rogue; and a knifegrinder may be a philosopher and philanthropist. But they dont change their ranks for all that." ...|$|E

However, Manolo quickly noticed that <b>the</b> <b>caller</b> wasn't his son, so the call and the next ones were different, unconnected jokes.|$|R
