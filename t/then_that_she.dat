25|$|Seah was {{informed}} by the Singapore Symphony Orchestra's management that they will nominate her for the Cultural Medallion in January 2006. She didn't know <b>then</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> will be receiving this prestigious award. In June, while having lunch with her Malaysian student and his parents in Kuala Lumpur, she {{received a phone call}} by her SSO's general manager, Mr Chng Kai Jin, and {{was informed}} that she is the recipient of the Cultural Medallion for Music of 2006. Then, on 20 October, she received the award from Singapore's President S R Nathan at the Istana. She performed Bach's Partita No.3 and Elgar's Salut d'Amour during the award ceremony.|$|E
25|$|After the {{critical}} and commercial success of her album Ray of Light (1998), Madonna intended {{to embark on}} a new concert tour in 1999, but due to the delay of her film The Next Best Thing, it was cancelled. By 2000, Madonna was dating director Guy Ritchie, and was pregnant with their child. Wanting to distract herself from the media frenzy surrounding this news, Madonna concentrated on the development of her eighth studio album, Music, instead of embarking on a tour. Buoyed up by the commercial success of her previous album, she was keen on getting back to the studio to record new music. Madonna was well disposed towards William Orbit, producer of Ray of Light, but by 2000, his production and sound had become ubiquitous. Also, the music scene was being dominated by a younger generation of singers like Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera, prompting Madonna to look for a more distinctive sound. It was <b>then</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was introduced to French DJ and producer Mirwais Ahmadzaï through some common friends. Madonna instantly liked the pitch-shifting, pulverizing rhythms and acid bass in his songs.|$|E
500|$|In a world {{increasingly}} {{centered on}} technology and information, she possesses a genius-level intellect; photographic memory; deep knowledge {{of computers and}} electronics; expert skills as a hacker; and graduate training in library sciences. One night, she has a dream in which an all-knowing woman (similar to Oracle at Delphi of Greek mythology) has her own face; it's <b>then</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> adopts [...] "Oracle" [...] as her codename. She serves as an information broker, gathering and disseminating intelligence to law enforcement organizations {{and members of the}} superhero community. She trains under the tutelage of Richard Dragon, one of DC's premiere martial artists, to engage in combat (using eskrima) from her wheelchair. She develops her upper-body strength and targeting skills with both firearms and batarangs.|$|E

500|$|She {{started to}} work with Mirwais Ahmadzaï {{with whom she had}} {{previously}} developed her eighth album Music (2000). However, that collaboration did not suit Madonna's musical direction. According to Madonna, [...] " [...] Mirwais is also very political, seriously cerebral and intellectual. All we did was sit around, talking politics all the time. So, that couldn't help but find its way into the music. I think there's an angry aspect to the music that directly reflects my feelings at the time." [...] Hence after recording tracks with Mirwais, Madonna decided to stop the project and start fresh. It was <b>then</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> turned to Stuart Price who had served as musical director on her two previous concert tours and co-wrote one song on American Life.|$|E
2500|$|CMT {{music critic}} Timothy Duggan praised the album: [...] "This album showcases Jewel's unique talent as a lyricist, {{alongside}} a definite growth in her musicianship. It is what Pieces of You {{might have been}} had Jewel had the musical knowledge <b>then</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> has now. A very satisfying work, all in all." [...] Rolling Stone, however, called the album [...] "overdone and undercooked" [...] with a rating of 2 stars out of 5.|$|E
2500|$|The {{constant}} {{comments of}} the Romans about Cleopatra often undermine her, representing the Roman thought {{on the foreign}} and particularly of Egyptians. From {{the perspective of the}} reason-driven Romans, Shakespeare's [...] "Egyptian queen repeatedly violates the rules of decorum". [...] It is because of this distaste that Cleopatra [...] "embodies political power, a power which is continuously underscored, denied, nullified by the Roman counterpart". To many of Antony's crew, his actions appeared extravagant and over the top: [...] "Antony's devotion is inordinate and therefore irrational". It is no wonder, <b>then,</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> is such a subordinated queen.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the midst}} of this crisis Sophie Cruvelli, the {{surviving}} mainstay of the company, suddenly disappeared from London, on the day she was to have sung Lucrezia Borgia. [...] "Where's Cruvelli?" [...] became a burlesque by-word. She had fled to Germany, and in time reports came in that she was singing in Wiesbaden, and <b>then</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was singing Fidès in Le prophète at Aix-la-Chapelle. This was the original so-called [...] "Flight of Cruvelli", and for the time being put an end to her London appearances. Yet when Verdi wanted to cast Cruvelli as Violetta for the première of La traviata, which was presented with a different singer in Venice in March 1853, he was unable to do so because she was still under contract to Lumley.|$|E
2500|$|A {{series of}} high-selling albums and world tours {{followed}} through the 1980s, eventually bringing about Ozzy's popularity. In 1996, Osbourne created the Ozzfest summer touring festival. It {{went on to}} become a regular rock occasion and celebrated a 10th anniversary in 2006. By 2007, the ticket prices had reached £76 ($150) and Osbourne announced that the tickets would be free to allow more people the opportunity to attend the concert. Prior to the founding of Ozzfest, Osbourne approached Lollapalooza, another rock/pop festival, to request that Ozzy play at that year's festival, only to be rejected and told that Ozzy was [...] "uncool" [...] and too drugged up. It was <b>then</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> decided to launch her own festival. Controversy ensued when she pulled the plug on Iron Maiden's set three times in one performance. She also harassed the singer, Bruce Dickinson, and threw eggs at the band.|$|E
2500|$|The {{southbound}} {{journey through}} Italy was planned in detail by the Vatican {{and had a}} brilliant triumph in Ferrara, Bologna, Faenza and Rimini. In Pesaro, Christina became acquainted with the handsome brothers Santinelli, who so impressed her with their poetry and adeptness of dancing that she took them into service, {{as well as a}} certain Gian Rinaldo Monaldeschi. [...] The official entry into Rome took place on 20 December, in a couch designed by Bernini through Porta Flaminia, which today is known as Porta del Popolo. Christina met Bernini on the next day, she invited him to her apartment the same evening and they became lifelong friends. [...] "Two days afterwards she was conducted to the Vatican Basilica, where the pope gave her confirmation. It was <b>then</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> received from the pope her second name of Alexandra, the feminine form of his own." [...] She was granted her own wing inside the Vatican, decorated by Bernini.|$|E

2500|$|Elvis was a keen karate {{student and}} persuaded Priscilla {{to take it}} up. Priscilla {{thought it was a}} good idea, as it would pass the time she spent alone if she had a hobby on which to concentrate, and she was also keen to share in Elvis' interests. Following {{suggestions}} from Elvis, Priscilla began taking lessons from Mike Stone, a karate instructor she had met in 1972 backstage at one of Elvis' concerts. She soon began an affair with him. Priscilla states in her book, [...] "My relationship with Mike had now developed into an affair. I still loved Elvis greatly, but over the next few months I knew I would have to make a crucial decision regarding my destiny." [...] She later states [...] "Elvis must have perceived my new restlessness." [...] A couple of months later, she said that Elvis had requested to see her in his hotel suite. It was <b>then</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> writes in her book that Elvis [...] "forcefully made love to me... 'This is how a real man makes love to his woman.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|In January 2010, Bakari {{released}} {{an account of}} her ordeal in a French memoir, [...] "Moi Bahia, la miraculée" [...] ("I'm Bahia, the miracle girl"), published by Jean-Claude Gawsewitch Éditeur in Paris, France. In the book, co-authored with French journalist Omar Guendouz as ghostwriter, Bakari provides details about her survival and rescue. She discloses that immediately after the crash, {{she thought she had}} fallen out of the airplane by pressing her forehead too hard against the window, and that her motherwho she believed had landed safely without herwould scold her for not wearing her seat belt. Then, floating on debris {{in the midst of a}} jet fuel slick released from the aircraft's burst fuel tanks, she recalls having [...] "...this taste of fuel in my mouth, mixed with salt, which burned my throat, my lungs and my stomach." [...] Bakari writes that she only realized her plane had crashed and that she was the sole survivor when she was in the hospital, believing until <b>then</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had simply fallen out into the ocean. AOL News reports that Steven Spielberg approached Bakari to make a film based on her book, but she turned him down, worried that [...] "it would be too terrifying." ...|$|E
2500|$|Misao is a sixteen-year-old {{high school}} student. She {{has been plagued}} {{with the ability to}} see demons ever since birth. Because of her ability, she was never able to make any friends until she met Kyō. The monsters were {{harmless}} until her sixteenth birthday; on the day she turned sixteen, a monster possessing one of the schools idols attacks her. Before she was injured any further, Kyō came to save her and healed her wound by licking it. It is <b>then</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> discovers that he is a demon and that she is the [...] "bride of the prophecy" [...] for the head of the Tengu Clan; she was chosen to be the wife of the next head of the clan ten years ago. When she was a child, Misao became attached to Kyo and they had made a promise that she would be his bride. However, she was supposed to marry Kyo's older brother, Sho, who was the heir to the clan. As a result, Kyo left Misao's side in order to surpass him and become the heir. At first, she was scared of Kyo for his stoic personality and demonic powers, but grows to trust and understand that he is willing to do anything to be with her. She later falls in love with Kyo and decides to fulfill her promise to him by becoming his wife, once she graduates high school. They begin a romantic and sexual relationship from then on. After Sho's death, Misao notices a change in her powers, which no one is able to touch her and her scent is overwhelming. It is discovered that this is because Misao is pregnant with a demon child.

Instead of dying, a miracle happens when Misao wakes up, and even though it costs her most of her ability to walk, she is able to live happily with Kyo and Sou.|$|E
