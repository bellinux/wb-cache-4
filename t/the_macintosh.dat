5|$|In 1985, Apple co-founder Steve Jobs led Apple's SuperMicro division, {{which was}} {{responsible}} for the development of <b>the</b> <b>Macintosh</b> and Lisa personal computers. <b>The</b> <b>Macintosh</b> had been successful on university campuses partly because of the Apple University Consortium, which allowed students and institutions to buy the computers at a discount. The consortium had earned more than $50million on computers by February 1984.|$|E
5|$|Dark Forces was ported from DOS to Apple Macintosh. This {{presented}} several {{challenges for}} the developers. LucasArts requested the game to be produced for both DOS and Macintosh with the same system requirements, specifically the random-access memory (RAM). The Mac OS runs a graphical user interface which uses up RAM while DOS does not, meaning <b>the</b> <b>Macintosh</b> version has less RAM available for Dark Forces to use. Aaron Giles, who was <b>the</b> <b>Macintosh</b> programmer for Dark Forces, explained that to resolve this problem the memory had to be managed more efficiently.|$|E
5|$|A {{condensed}} {{variant of}} ITC Garamond {{was adopted by}} Apple in 1984 upon the release of <b>the</b> <b>Macintosh,</b> known as Apple Garamond. This was a proprietary font not publicly available, less condensed than the publicly released ITC Garamond Condensed.|$|E

5|$|Jobs was {{intrigued}} by Berg's concept of a workstation and contemplated starting a higher education computer company {{in the fall of}} 1985, amidst increasing turmoil at Apple. Jobs' division did not release upgraded versions of <b>the</b> <b>Macintosh</b> and most of <b>the</b> <b>Macintosh</b> Office. As a result, sales plummeted, and Apple was forced to write off millions of dollars in unsold inventory. Apple's chief executive officer (CEO) John Sculley ousted Jobs from his day-to-day role at Apple, replacing him with Jean-Louis Gassée in 1985. Later that year, Jobs began a power struggle to regain control of the company. The board of directors sided with Sculley while Jobs took a business visit to Western Europe and the Soviet Union on behalf of Apple.|$|E
5|$|MacPaint {{was written}} by Bill Atkinson, a member of Apple's {{original}} Macintosh development team. The original MacPaint consisted of 5,804 lines of Pascal computer code, augmented by another 2,738 lines of 68000 assembly language. MacPaint's user interface was designed by Susan Kare, {{also a member of}} <b>the</b> <b>Macintosh</b> team. Kare also beta-tested MacPaint before release.|$|E
5|$|The logic board, {{the central}} circuit {{board of the}} computer, was based on <b>the</b> <b>Macintosh</b> SE design. Its size, however, was reduced using surface mount {{technology}} to 9×5inches (23×13cm), {{half the size of}} the SE board. This redesign, and the absence of expansion slots, kept manufacturing costs low. This lack of expansion abilities, along with the small screen size and Macintosh's popularity in the burgeoning field of desktop publishing led to such oddities as video displays that connected through the SCSI port by users seeking to connect a larger full- or dual-page display to their Mac. The Classic design was used once more in 1991 for the Classic II, which succeeded the Classic and replaced <b>the</b> <b>Macintosh</b> SE/30.|$|E

5|$|After {{several months}} of being sidelined, Jobs {{resigned}} from Apple on September 13, 1985. He told the board he was leaving {{to set up a}} new computer company, and that he would be taking several Apple employees from the SuperMicro division with him. He also told the board that his new company would not compete with Apple and might even consider licensing its designs back to them to market under <b>the</b> <b>Macintosh</b> brand.|$|E
5|$|Despite NeXT's limited {{commercial}} success, {{the company}} had a wide-ranging impact on the computer industry. Object-oriented programming and graphical user interfaces became more common after the 1988 release of the NeXTcube and NeXTSTEP, when other companies started to emulate NeXT's object-oriented system. Apple started the Taligent project in 1989, {{with the goal of}} building a NeXT-like operating system for <b>the</b> <b>Macintosh,</b> with collaboration from Hewlett-Packard and IBM.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Power <b>Macintosh</b> 7100 is a {{mid-range}} Apple Macintosh {{personal computer}} that was designed, manufactured and sold by Apple Computer from March 1994 to January 1996.

5|$|MagSafe, a {{magnetic}} charging connector, {{has been replaced}} with USB-C charging. Unlike MagSafe, which provided an indicator light within the user’s field of view to indicate the device's charging status, the USB-C charger has no visual indicator. Instead, the MacBook Pro emits a chime when connected to power. <b>The</b> <b>Macintosh</b> startup chime {{that has been used}} since the first Macintosh in 1984 is now disabled by default. The laptop now boots automatically when the lid is opened.|$|E
5|$|Myst is {{a graphic}} {{adventure}} puzzle video game {{designed by the}} brothers Robyn and Rand Miller. It was developed by Cyan, Inc., published by Brøderbund, and initially released on <b>the</b> <b>Macintosh</b> platform in 1993. Remakes and ports of the game have been released for platforms including the Sega Saturn, PlayStation, 3DO, Microsoft Windows, Atari Jaguar CD, CD-i, AmigaOS, PlayStation Portable, Nintendo DS, iOS, OS X, and Android.|$|E
5|$|Older Macintoshes {{dating from}} 1983 until 1998 {{utilized}} a basic bootloader; the bootloader was solely a ROM chip varying in sizes up to 4megabytes (MB), which contained both the computer code to boot {{the computer and}} to run the Mac OS operating system. This was known as <b>the</b> <b>Macintosh</b> Toolbox, or the Old World ROM, and differs greatly from design the modern Macintosh which generally use a hard drive of large capacity to store the operating system. This bootloader was used in all Macintosh computers until mid-1998.|$|E

5|$|The first Georgian {{script was}} {{included}} in Unicode Standard in October, 1991 {{with the release of}} version 1.0. In creating the Georgian Unicode block, important roles were played by German Jost Gippert, a linguist of Kartvelian studies, and American-Irish linguist and script-encoder Michael Everson, who created the Georgian Unicode for <b>the</b> <b>Macintosh</b> systems. Significant contributions were also made by Anton Dumbadze and Irakli Garibashvili (not to be mistaken with the former Prime Minister of Georgia Irakli Garibashvili).|$|E
5|$|The high-right policy led to {{a series}} of {{machines}} with ever-increasing prices. The original Macintosh plans called for a system around $1,000, but by the time it had morphed from Jef Raskin's original vision of an easy-to-use machine for composing text documents to Jobs' concept incorporating ideas gleaned during a trip to Xerox PARC, the Mac's list price had ballooned to $2,495. From there, the price of Mac systems continued to climb: <b>the</b> <b>Macintosh</b> Plus was slightly more expensive at $2,599, the SE was $2,900 or $3,900 depending on the model, and a basic Macintosh II with a 40 MB hard drive was at least $5,500 (at launch, with the price increasing in late 1988). More modern machines cost even more: <b>the</b> <b>Macintosh</b> IIcx was $5,369, the IIci $6,269, and the IIfx $9,900 - all without monitors or keyboards. Color CRTs were relatively expensive in the late 1980s; Apple's 14-inch 640×480 monitor had a list price of $999 and Apple's ADB keyboards, while of high quality, were similarly expensive. The only inexpensive machine in the lineup by the late 1980s was the several-year-old Mac Plus, which was now selling for around $1,800.|$|E
5000|$|The Twin Turbo 128 PCI series came {{standard}} on <b>the</b> Power <b>Macintosh</b> 9600 {{and was a}} high-performance upgrade for <b>the</b> Power <b>Macintosh</b> 8600.|$|R
50|$|The base Centris 650 {{initially}} used a 25 MHz 68LC040 CPU; later models, and {{all models}} with Ethernet built-in, use a 68040. It {{uses the same}} case as <b>the</b> older <b>Macintosh</b> IIvx and <b>Macintosh</b> IIvi computers. <b>The</b> newer <b>Macintosh</b> Quadra 650 and <b>the</b> Power <b>Macintosh</b> 7100 line of computers also use the same case.|$|R

5|$|Halos {{characters}} were continually refined through development, {{as the company}} was bought by Microsoft and the platform shifted from <b>the</b> <b>Macintosh</b> to the Xbox. Other Bungie developers would often add input to the progress of characters in Halo, {{even if they were}} not working on the game itself. For example, an outside artist, Shi Kai Wang, developed the early concept sketches of what would eventually become the Master Chief. However upon developing a 3D model, the artists decided the Chief looked too slender, almost effeminate, and subsequently bulked up the character. Early Covenant Elites had a more natural jaw rather than the split mandibles they would later sport; at one point, Jason Jones was also insistent about having a tail on the Elites, but this idea was eventually dropped.|$|E
5|$|In January 1990, Gassée {{resigned}} and his authority over product development was divided among several successors. Many Apple engineers {{had long been}} pressing for lower-cost options {{in order to build}} market share and increase demand across the entire price spectrum. With Gassée out, a rush started to quickly introduce a series of low-cost machines. Three market points were identified, a very low-cost machine aimed at costing $1,000, a low-cost machine with color graphics, and a more upscale color machine for small business use. In time, these would develop as the Classic, Macintosh LC, and Macintosh IIsi. Unlike the '020 and '030 based models, <b>the</b> <b>Macintosh</b> Classic has the original Macintosh startup sound.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} to use a straight or curved laryngoscope blade depends partly on the specific anatomical features of the airway, and partly on the personal experience and preference of the laryngoscopist. <b>The</b> <b>Macintosh</b> blade is {{the most widely used}} curved laryngoscope blade, while the Miller blade is the most popular style of straight blade. Both Miller and Macintosh laryngoscope blades are available in sizes 0 (infant) through 4 (large adult). There are many other styles of straight and curved blades, with accessories such as mirrors for enlarging the field of view and even ports for the administration of oxygen. These specialty blades are primarily designed for use by anesthetists and otolaryngologists, most commonly in the operating room.|$|E
50|$|The MacDonalds of Glenbogle have a {{traditional}} rivalry with <b>the</b> <b>MacIntoshes.</b> According to <b>the</b> novels, Hector of the Great Jaw speared eleven MacIntoshes and drowned them in Loch na Craosniach (hence, presumably, the name). His descendant, the ninth laird (also named Hector), {{was involved in}} numerous disputes with <b>the</b> <b>MacIntoshes,</b> responding to one outrage by roasting 45 {{of them in a}} church. The series shows the feud continuing to the present day; in the third series, Stuart MacIntosh plans to avenge his clan by buying the estate from the bank, should the MacDonalds lose it.|$|R
