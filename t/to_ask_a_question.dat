25|$|Many {{tasks that}} we would like to {{automate}} by using a computer are of question–answer type: we would like <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> and the computer should produce an answer. In theoretical computer science, such tasks are called computational problems. Formally, a computational problem consists of instances together with a solution for each instance. Instances are questions that we can ask, and solutions are desired answers to these questions.|$|E
25|$|On 22 August 1922 Collins set {{out from}} Cork City on a {{circuitous}} tour of West Cork. He passed first through Macroom then took the Bandon road via Crookstown. This led through Béal na Bláth, an isolated crossroads.

500|$|On December 12, 2007, Keyes {{participated in}} the Des Moines Registers Republican presidential debate, {{televised}} nationwide by PBS and the cable news networks. This {{was the first major}} presidential debate in which Keyes participated during the 2008 election season and the last Republican debate before the Iowa Caucuses. Although Keyes was not listed on the latest national CNN poll leading up to the debate, he registered with at least 1 percent of the Iowa vote in order to participate. During the debate, after the moderator began <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> of Texas Congressman Ron Paul, Keyes insisted he was not getting fair treatment. He interrupted the debate moderator at one point, saying that she had not called on him in several rounds and that he had to make an issue of it. He went on the offensive against his opponents during the debate, criticizing Rudy Giuliani's pro-choice position, as well as Mitt Romney's recent change in position on the same subject. In answering a question about global warming, he continued his criticisms of other candidates, saying, [...] "I'm in favor of reducing global warming, because I think the most important emission we need to control is the hot air emission of politicians who pretend one thing and don't deliver". He also advocated ending the income tax, establishing state-sanctioned prayer in public schools, and abolishing abortion. Toward the end of the debate, Keyes stated he could not support Giuliani if he were to win the nomination due to the former New York mayor's position on abortion.|$|E
500|$|Davison {{was arrested}} again in early October 1909, while {{preparing}} {{to throw a}} stone at the cabinet minister Sir Walter Runciman; she acted in the mistaken belief the car in which he travelled contained Lloyd George. A suffragette colleague—Constance Lytton—threw hers first, before the police managed to intervene. Davison was charged with attempted assault, but released; Lytton was imprisoned for a month. Davison used her court appearances to give speeches; excerpts and quotes from these {{were published in the}} newspapers. Two weeks later she threw stones at Runciman at a political meeting in Radcliffe, Greater Manchester; she was arrested and sentenced to a week's hard labour. She again went on hunger strike, but the government had authorised the use of force-feeding on prisoners. The historian Gay Gullickson describes the tactic as [...] "extremely painful, psychologically harrowing, and raised the possibility of dying in jail from medical error or official misjudgment". Davison said that the experience [...] "will haunt me with its horror all my life, and is almost indescribable.... The torture was barbaric". Following the first episode of forced feeding, and to prevent a repeat of the experience, Davison barricaded herself in her cell using her bed and a stool and refused to allow the prison authorities to enter. They broke one of the window panes to the cell and turned a fire hose on her for 15 minutes, while attempting to force the door open. By the time the door was opened, the cell was six inches deep in water. She was taken to the prison hospital where she was warmed by hot water bottles. She was force-fed shortly afterwards and released after eight days. Davison's treatment prompted the Labour Party MP Keir Hardie <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> in the House of Commons about the [...] "assault committed on a woman prisoner in Strangeways"; Davison sued the prison authorities {{for the use of the}} hose and, in January 1910, she was awarded 40 shillings in damages.|$|E

2500|$|To {{supplement}} Genie's language acquisition, once Genie {{started to}} combine words the scientists worked to teach Genie ritual speech for common everyday situations. Soon after beginning to produce two-word utterances Genie learned the phrases [...] "Give me [...] ", [...] "Help me [...] ", and [...] "I want [...] ", and later learned [...] "May I have ?". Analyses of Genie's utterances beginning with [...] "I want" [...] concluded that Genie treated the phrase as one word, {{and noted that}} the dependent clauses in these utterances could all have been separate utterances and never had markers indicating dependence. Linguists {{also noted that the}} phrase [...] "Help me" [...] always preceded a verb, whereas [...] "Give me", [...] "May I have", and [...] "I want" [...] always preceded nouns. In addition, since she could only use the word may {{as a part of the}} phrase [...] "May I have" [...] <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> and never produced a statement or asked about someone else with it, Curtiss did not consider these utterances true [...] use of an auxiliary structure.|$|E
