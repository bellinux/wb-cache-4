Moreover, these results suggest the existence of a balance between cargo hopping and the movement of the complex that may control the efficiency of cargo transfer and cargo delivering.

We analyze electron trajectories, inelastic mean free paths, and the distribution of backscattered electrons in different compositions and at different depths of the deposit.

40|$|Large {{volumes of}} CO₂ are emitted during {{volcanic}} activity at convergent plate boundaries, {{not only from}} volcanic centers.

X-ray diffraction measurements confirm single crystal growth in all cases. The Sb content is determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Consistent values of the Sb content are obtained from Raman spectroscopy. Scanning Raman spectroscopy reveals that the (Bi 1 -xSbx) 2 Te 3 layers with an intermediate Sb content show spatial composition inhomogeneities. The observed spectra broadening in angular-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) is also attributed to this phenomena. Upon increasing the Sb content from x= 0 to 1 the ARPES measurements show a shift of the Fermi level from the conduction band to the valence band. This shift is also confirmed by corresponding magnetotransport measurements where the conductance changes from n- to p-type. In this transition region, an increase of the resistivity is found, indicating a location of the Fermi level within the band gap region.

Calculations with an idealized, initially zonally symmetric tracer show {{that in the middle}} and upper stratosphere the bulk of tropical air is transported into the midlatitudes of the winter hemisphere although there exist quasi-permeable barriers in the subtropics. <b>The</b> <b>transport</b> <b>takes</b> <b>place</b> in the form of planetary-scale 'tongues' of material that are drawn poleward in association with the episodic amplification of planetary-scale waves in high latitudes of the winter hemisphere. Once air of tropical origin is transported to the midlatitudes it is irreversibly mixed with the midlatitude air in the 'surf zone. ' Air of tropical origin can, however, hardly penetrate into the interior of the winter polar vortex until the breakdown of the vortex. Transport of tropical air into the midlatitudes of the summer hemisphere is strongly inhibited. In the lower stratosphere, tropical air is transported into the northern and southern midlatitudes. During the period from 1 June to 31 October 1992, the amount of tropical air transported into the Northern Hemisphere is, however, much smaller than that transported into the Southern Hemisphere, and there exist strong gradients in the tracer field in the equatorial region, indicating that there is a quasi-permeable barrier to cross-equator mass exchange. During the period from 1 December 1992 to 30 April 1993, on the other hand, roughly the same amounts of tropical air are transported into the Southern Hemisphere, and there exist strong gradients in the tracer field in the equatorial region, indicating that there is a quasi-permeable barrier to cross-equator mass exchange.

40|$|This work {{deals with}} {{transport}} of radionuclides in the geosphere. The subject is investigated through characterisation of water conducting fractures, determining of rock transport properties {{and development of}} new methods for characterising geological samples. Here, {{as is often the}} case, radionuclide transport is investigated indirectly by characterising the structures, where <b>the</b> <b>transport</b> <b>takes</b> <b>place,</b> and directly by measuring transport properties in the gas phase. First water conducting fractures of three different types and the rock matrix surrounding them were analysed through rock samples from Olkiluoto. The analysis was done using X-ray tomography, the 14 C-PMMA autoradiography technique and petrographical methods. The rock properties around the fractures were found to be highly heterogeneous, but some combining features were found. This experiment also showed the strength of combining different analysis methods. Second, a method for converting local porosities obtained through the 14 C-PMMA autoradiography technique to fracture apertures was developed by analysing the radiation emitted from the 14 CPMMA filled fracture by Monte Carlo simulations and comparing them to fracture apertures. A connection was found and the method was validated by manufacturing artificial glass plate samples with fractures of known apertures, and analysing the autoradiographic images obtained from them. The method needs further development before it can be used on real rock samples, but it was shown to be extremely promising in the studies conducted. Last, the transport properties of Olkiluoto rock samples were measured directly using argon pycnometry and through diffusion, permeability and advection - matrix diffusion measurements in the gas phase. The gas phase methods exclude sorption and other chemical and water-based processes and thus only give information about diffusion. They are, however, over 10 000 times faster, making them excellent for planning of water phase experiments and giving preliminary results. Gas phase methods are also very powerful tools when investigating the long term transport behaviour, as it would take far too long to run water phase experiments to the late part of the breakthrough curves. Correlations between porosity, diffusion coefficient and permeability were investigated and found to exist only between the latter two parameters. The mathematical model and measurement setup for advection - matrix diffusion measurements were vastly improved during these studies and are now effective tools for such a measurement. Overall this work managed to produce usable parameters for the safety assessment of the upcoming nuclear repository. The methods used were found to be suitable for the experiments, and they were developed further during the experiments...|$|E

This thesis {{is centered on}} studying the charge transport in molecular wire films {{with a variety of}} architectures and investigating the structure-property relationships in these systems. In particular, a comprehensive surface and electrical characterization of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of π-conjugated molecular wires is demonstrated. We extensively used conducting probe atomic force microscopy (CP-AFM) as the primary tool for making electrical measurements on molecular wires and elucidating the charge transport mechanisms in these ultrathin organic films. Nanoscopic metal-molecule-metal junctions (molecular junctions) were formed by bringing an Au-coated AFM probe into contact with monolayers on Au substrates and current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of the junction were measured. The contact areas are in the order of 50 nm 2 at a compressive load of 1 - 2 nN and the junctions typically consist of ~ 50 molecules. We also used cyclic voltammetry (CV) as a complementary method to investigate the kinetics of electron-transfer (ET) in a series of molecular wires terminated with the redox active ferrocene unit. The molecular wires studied in this thesis were all derivatives of the previously reported oligophenyleneimine (OPI) wires and were synthesized on Au surfaces using a stepwise approach based on the imine condensation reaction. The formation of the wires on the surface were monitored by variety of techniques including infrared spectroscopy, ellipsometry, and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Optical band gaps (Eg) of the wires were determined from UV-Vis spectroscopy measurements and surface coverages were obtained from cyclic voltammetry (CV) data. In this work, we studied the charge transport in a series of molecular wires for which the π-conjugation was intentionally interrupted by saturated cyclohexyl spacers at certain locations within the molecular backbone. The current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of the corresponding molecular junctions were measured by CP-AFM and complementary density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed on radical cation species to further understand the charge transport mechanism in these wires. The combination of experimental and computational data confirmed the polaronic nature of the charge carriers and suggested that <b>the</b> <b>transport</b> <b>takes</b> <b>place</b> via a thermally-assisted polaron tunneling mechanism. Using the CP-AFM technique, we also explored the electrical properties of three light-switchable π-conjugated molecular wires. These wires consisted of a photochromic dithienylethene linker (the “photoswitch”) embedded in a conjugated OPI backbone. We observed that all of the wires switch between high and low conductance modes (“ON” and “OFF” states corresponding to “Closed” and “Open” forms of the dithienylethene linker, respectively) when irradiated by UV and visible light, respectively. Finally, the kinetics of electron-transfer (ET) to ferrocene was investigated for a series of ferrocene-capped OPI molecular wire in two different electrolytes. It was found that the variations in standard rate constants (k 0) of ET in these wires strongly depends on the choice of the electrolyte. Overall, these experiments offer promising opportunities for further understanding the details of microscopic charge transport in π-conjugated molecular wires...|$|E
40|$|Chloride induced {{corrosion}} of {{reinforcing steel}} {{is recognized as}} the most common deterioration mechanism affecting reinforced concrete structures. As such, {{it has been in}} focus of research for more than thirty years. Numerous studies of chloride ingress, corrosion initiation, and corrosion propagation have been conducted. Most studies of chloride ingress focused on sound (uncracked) concrete. In reality, however, concrete is almost never crack free. Cracks form either in the construction phase (early age cracks, for example shrinkage cracks), or during the use of a structure (e. g. cracks caused by mechanical loads). While these cracks are usually not detrimental to the load bearing capacity of a structure, they are potentially a threat to its durability. Cracks occurring in the concrete cover diminish its protective capabilities, and present fast routes for ingress of deleterious species (e. g. chloride ions). While national and international design codes provide guidelines and limits for maximum crack widths in aggressive environmental conditions, these are often empirical and based on rules of thumb. As a result, only the surface crack width is considered. However, recent findings seem to indicate that an even more important factor could be the zone of debonding which occurs at the steel/concrete interface due to cracking of the cover. In this thesis, an attempt is made to increase the body of knowledge related to chloride ingress in cracked concrete. Laboratory experiments and numerical simulations were used during the study. Experimental data available in the literature is, at the moment, inconclusive. For years researchers have been trying to find a so-called ''threshold'' crack width for chloride (or water) transport, below which concrete can be treated as sound (uncracked). In this quest, mostly plain concrete specimens were used. While this approach resulted in increased understanding of chloride transport in cracks, it failed to address an important mechanism which affects only reinforced concrete - debonding occurring at the steel/concrete interface. Only recently have researchers focused their attention on the effect of damage at the steel/concrete interface on transport behavior and corrosion of reinforcement in concrete. In this thesis, compact reinforced specimen geometry is adopted, which mimics (with respect to crack geometry) the behavior of reinforced concrete beams. Cracked specimens were subjected to weekly cycles of salt water wetting and drying for a prolonged period of time. After the exposure, two-dimensional chloride maps were obtained by means of LIBS (Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy), in collaboration with BAM Federal Institute for Materials Research and Testing in Berlin, Germany. The results showed that, once damage occurs at the steel/concrete interface, chloride ions penetrate parallel to the reinforcement, which could possibly be very harmful with respect to reinforcement corrosion. It has been frequently reported in the literature that autogeneous healing of cracks can reduce chloride ingress in concrete. To examine this, experiments were performed to investigate the influence of the curing ("healing") regimen on chloride penetration depth in cracked specimens. Two regimens (submerged in water and in 95 % relative humidity) both enabled the tested specimens to reduce chloride ingress in cracks, compared to the control series. It was found that, under favorable conditions, autogeneous crack healing does {{have a positive effect on}} chloride penetration resistance. Corrosion induced cover cracking has been extensively studied in recent years. When reinforcing steel corrodes, it causes expansive pressure on the surrounding concrete. As a consequence, concrete cover cracks. In the thesis, cracking induced by accelerated corrosion was studied using X-ray computed tomography. Mechanical properties of the rust layer were determined using the nanoindentation technique. Valuable insights were obtained, especially for fine tuning of numerical models. Numerical models can be of use in understanding complex problems. In this thesis, a model for chloride ingress in cracked concrete, based on the lattice modeling approach, was developed. Concrete is discretized as a set of one dimensional "pipe" elements through which <b>the</b> <b>transport</b> <b>takes</b> <b>place.</b> The model is coupled to the lattice fracture model, which enabled simulating chloride penetration around cracks in concrete. The model was validated using experimental results from the literature. Numerous experiments make use of external electrical field to accelerate chloride ingress. Therefore, the developed model was extended to enable modeling chloride ingress in accelerated experiments. Based on the lattice modeling approach and utilizing the Characteristic Galerkin scheme, the approach enables using smaller elements compared to the conventional Galerkin approach. Apart from its computational efficiency, it showed that the, under accelerated conditions, chloride front ahead of a crack may be much more sharp compared to the natural (i. e. diffusion) conditions. Therefore, it is questionable if findings from accelerated experiments on cracked specimens can be directly applied to "real" exposure conditions. Cracking of the concrete cover caused by reinforcement corrosion is also frequently modeled. In this thesis, the two-dimensional Delft lattice model was used to model it. First, the developed model was validated using a set of well-documented experiments from the literature. It was found that penetration of corrosion products into pores and open cracks needs to be considered in order to obtain good match with the experiments. Furthermore, it was observed that the internal pressure which causes cracking is not a deterministic value, but that it depends on local mechanical properties inside the concrete. Also, two hypothetical pitting scenarios were tested and compared to then uniform corrosion case. It appears (according to the 2 D model) that pitting is more detrimental for the concrete cover than uniform corrosion. This means that cover cracking will occur at lower internal pressure compared to the uniform corrosion case. Techniques employed in this thesis (such as LIBS, X-ray computed tomography, and nanoindentation) can be used in the same or similar way for studying other deterioration mechanisms. Also, the chloride transport model can be easily modified to model other transport processes, such as moisture transport, sulfate transport, or carbon dioxide ingress. Employing a staggered scheme used in this thesis, these transport processes can be coupled with the mechanical analysis to model the influence of combined actions on reinforced concrete structures.

METHOD: Data were collected from the 1299 children who were transported to our paediatric intensive-care unit from 1 January 1995 until 31 December 2001. Severity of illness was scored and mortality risk calculated. Data on 535 children who were retrieved by our intensive-care team were compared to those from the 764 who were attended by the referring team.

RESULTS: Two thirds of <b>the</b> <b>transports</b> <b>took</b> <b>place</b> during <b>the</b> evening and night. The median age of the children was 7. 5 months.

The net Eh between a given electron donor and acceptor; hydrogen ions and other species in place will determine which reaction will first <b>take</b> <b>place.</b> For instance, nitrification is hierarchically more favoured than sulphate reduction. This allows for enhanced oil recovery by disfavouring biologically produced H2S, which derives from reduced SO4. In this process, the effects of nitrate reduction on wettability, interfacial tension, viscosity, permeability, biomass and biopolymer production remain unknown.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the development and}} application of a model that predicts <b>the</b> behavior and <b>transport</b> of heavy metals in the environment. The model, called the Heavy Metal Leaching (HML) model, uses the direct substitution approach (DSA) for simulating one- and threedimensional multi-component solute transport in groundwater and soils. The model {{has the ability to}} treat equilibrium reactions of aqueous and surface complexation, precipitation-dissolution, and kinetic diffusion. The concentrations of aqueous component species, adsorbed component species, and precipitated species are selected as the principal dependent variables. The substitution into <b>the</b> <b>transport</b> equation <b>takes</b> <b>place</b> after <b>the</b> <b>transport</b> equation is discretized. The resulting system of equations is solved using the Newton-Raphson method and the Jacobian matrix is computed analytically. This method is computationally more efficient than sequential iteration methods due to its faster convergence rate. It is also more ef [...] ...|$|R
40|$|We analyze {{long-range}} transport {{through an}} ac driven triple quantum dot with one single electron. An effective model is {{proposed for the}} analysis of photoassisted cotunnel in order to account for the virtual processes which dominate <b>the</b> long-range <b>transport,</b> which <b>takes</b> <b>place</b> at n-photon resonances between the edge quantum dots. The AC field renormalizes the inter dot hopping, modifying the levels hybridization. It results in a non trivial behavior of the current with the frequency and intensity of the external ac field.

30|$|It is {{noteworthy}} {{to explain the}} DNA adsorption effect on nanomaterials of graphene surface {{as well as the}} proposed model. In graphene, <b>the</b> electronic <b>transport</b> <b>takes</b> <b>place</b> by hopping along π orbitals which is due to the sp 2 hybridized covalent bonds that held the carbon atoms together, while each of them can participate in some kind of bonding with adsorbates [26]. Theoretical data suggest that the bonding between the DNA bases and the carbon atoms is a kind of van der Waals (vdW) bonding (π-π stacking) [27, 28]. Since the DNA molecules have the negative charges, therefore, it could be expected that the adsorption of DNA molecules on graphene surface would directly modulate the drain current of the SGFET device [29, 30]. Based on the detection mechanism, we recently proposed an analytical model for the detection of DNA molecules in which the DNA concentration was modelled by a gate voltage [2].|$|R
40|$|W-based {{granular}} metals {{have been}} prepared by electron beam induced deposition from the tungsten-hexacarbonyl W(CO) 6 precursor. In situ electrical conductivity measurements have been performed to monitor the growth process and to investigate {{the behavior of the}} deposit under electron beam post irradiation and by exposure to air. During {{the first part of the}} growth process, the electrical conductivity grows non-linearly, independent of the electron beam parameters. This behavior is interpreted as the result of the increase of the W-particles diameter. Once the growth process is terminated, the electrical conductivity decreases with the logarithm of time, sigma ln(t). Temperature-dependent conductivity measurements of the deposits reveal that <b>the</b> electrical <b>transport</b> <b>takes</b> <b>place</b> by means of electron tunneling either between W-metal grains or between grains and trap sites in the matrix. After venting the electron microscope the electrical conductivity of the deposits shows a degradation behavior, which depends on the composition. Electron post-irradiation increases the electrical conductivity of the deposits...|$|R
40|$|Using a {{one-dimensional}} tight-binding Anderson model, {{we study}} a disordered nanowire {{in the presence}} of an external gate which can be used for depleting its carrier density (field effect transistor device configuration). In this first paper, we consider the low temperature coherent regime where the electron transmission through the nanowire remains elastic. In the limit where the nanowire length exceeds the electron localization length, we derive three analytical expressions for the typical value of the thermopower {{as a function of the}} gate potential, in the cases where <b>the</b> electron <b>transport</b> <b>takes</b> <b>place</b> (i) inside <b>the</b> impurity band of the nanowire, (ii) around its band edges and eventually (iii) outside its band. We obtain a very large enhancement of the typical thermopower at the band edges, while the sample to sample fluctuations around the typical value exhibit a sharp crossover from a Lorentzian distribution inside the impurity band towards a Gaussian distribution as the band edges are approached.
