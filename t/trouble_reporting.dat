I remarked, however, that his intelligence caused a peculiar expression of concern, not only with the Squire and Master Simon, but with the fair Julia and Lady Lillycraft, who happened to be present. From a few words which reached my ear, I found there was some tale of domestic calamity in the case, and that some unfortunate family had been rendered houseless by the storm. Many ejaculations of pity broke from the ladies; I heard the expressions of [...] "poor, helpless beings," [...] and [...] "unfortunate little creatures," [...] several times repeated; to which the old gardener replied by very melancholy shakes of the head.|$|E

40|$|Customer Service Management (CSM) offers {{customers}} a “logical view ” onto the service management of a service provider. CSM describes a management interface between customer and service provider and enables a customer to access service-specific management {{information about the}} subscribed service. The information flow across the CSM interface is bidirectional, from customer to service provider and vice versa. This bidirectional flow of infomation is of particular importance in multi-layer service hierarchies, as otherwise players in this service hierarchy cannot determine the QoS parameters from the layer below, but have to provide services to the layer above according to specified SLAs. The information exchanged across the CSM interface covers all functional areas of management. This paper focuses on the problem management task of Customer Service Management. This task describes {{the ability of a}} customer to actively participate in the trouble administration process of the service provider. The paper points out, why existing standards and related research work is not satisfactory to foster inter-domain problem management between customer and service provider. Hence, a methodology that results in a generic interface and a generic data structure called CSM <b>Trouble</b> <b>Report</b> (CSM-TR) is proposed. The CSM <b>Trouble</b> <b>Report</b> can be exchanged across the CSM management interface regardless of the position in a given service hierarchy and the service in question. It enables a customer to report problems, query, view, modify and cancel his <b>trouble</b> <b>reports.</b> The customer gets notified of problems that affect his agreed service level, changes in the state of current <b>trouble</b> <b>reports,</b> and upon problem resolution. The object model of the CSM-TR is described using UML notation and is instantiated for a real-life scenario...|$|R

5000|$|One curious {{aspect of}} attentional blink {{is that it}} usually {{includes}} [...] "lag 1 sparing", meaning that targets presented very close together in time (at [...] "lag 1" [...] or consecutively in the RSVP stream) are not affected by the attentional blink, even though items presented at slightly greater lags are significantly impaired. In attentional blink, participants in experiments have <b>trouble</b> <b>reporting</b> multiple targets that are in succession to one another, and will only report one accurately when these targets are presented to them 200ms to 500ms apart {{according to a study}} by Visser et al. (2015) [...] These targets are denoted as T1, T2, etc. The phenomena lag-1 sparing refers to the performance of T2 as opposed to what precedes it, T1. T2 performance was originally hypothesized to be reported far less often and less accurately by participants than T1, because the attention of the participant would still be on T1 while T2 was presented immediately afterwards. Visser also thought that the participants would be too focussed on finding the first target that they would miss the second target completely. However, participants actually did better identifying T2 than they were at identifying T1 when the targets were separated by one or two distractors, denoted also as lags.|$|E

40|$|The {{paradigm}} shift from device-oriented to service-oriented management has also implications {{to the area}} of event correlation. Today’s event correlation addresses mainly the correlation of events as reported from management tools. However, the correlation of <b>trouble</b> <b>reports</b> from users needs to be addressed as well, because different reports could have the same cause. In such a case the reports could be linked together and a processing has to performed only once. Therefore, the response time for <b>trouble</b> <b>reports</b> could be improved and service level guarantees could be kept with less effort. We refer to such a type of correlation as service-oriented correlation. In this paper we motivate the necessity of such a type of correlation. We use the MNM Service Model, a generic service management model proposed by the MNM Team, to retrieve an appropriate modeling of the necessary correlation information. To show the benefits of the service-oriented correlation we present a real-world scenario, the E-Mail Service offered by the Leibniz Supercomputing Center. 1...|$|R
50|$|The Loop Maintenance Operations System (LMOS) is a {{telephone}} company trouble ticketing system to coordinate repairs of local loops (telephone lines). When {{a problem is}} reported to the Centralized Repair Service Answering Bureau (CRSAB) by a subscriber dialing the designated number (often (1)+611), it is filed and relayed through the Cross Front End, which is a link from the CRSAB to the LMOS network. The <b>trouble</b> <b>report</b> is then sent to the Front End via the Datakit network, where a Basic Output Report is requested (usually by a lineman). The BOR provides line information including past trouble history and MLT (Mechanized Loop Testing) tests. As LMOS is responsible for <b>trouble</b> <b>reports,</b> analysis, and similar related functions, MLT does the actual testing of customer loops. MLT hardware {{is located in the}} Repair Service Bureau. Test trunks connect MLT hardware to the telephone exchanges or wire centers, which in turn connect with the subscriber loops.|$|R
40|$|One {{reason that}} VoIP {{technology}} {{is becoming more}} widely deployed, aside from the decreasing cost-per-channel of enabling technologies such as DSPs, {{is the ability of}} VoIP systems to match the overall service quality offered by traditional circuit-switched voice networks. Many incumbent local exchange and long-distance service providers use VoIP technology in the backhaul portion of their networks without the end user being aware that VoIP is involved. These traditional service providers use techniques to manage service quality developed over the last 100 + years for circuit-switched networks [...] namely, careful network design, and tracking of customer and network <b>trouble</b> <b>reports.</b> Service providers use wellunderstood rules to characterize service level in terms of voice quality (based on loss, delay, and echo), and in difficulty in establishing a call. Networks are pre-engineered to offer a certain level of service while taking into account these factors. Then, a service provider’s main tool to assess service quality while the network is in operation is based on <b>trouble</b> <b>reports</b> from users, as well as general network equipment failure notification through Network Management systems...|$|R

Some of the components will be large, and for economic reasons there will not be spares for all components. It is therefore important to have a system whereby troubles are communicated, recorded and analyzed. Such a <b>trouble</b> <b>report</b> system has been in place at the DIII-D tokamak facility for many years. The purpose of the system is to easily facilitate communication between the people that discover problems and those that fix the problems. The trouble sheets are logged into a computer database that is used to characterize the kind of problems that the facility experiences, and determine which equipment, software, or human errors are causing significant downtime. The information is also used to evaluate whether sufficient maintenance is done to the equipment and to provide a basis for replacing it. The original system was based on paper forms. About a year ago the system was changed to a web-based system. In the new system a <b>trouble</b> <b>report</b> is filled out using a web browser, and the information is emailed to the repair personnel and managers as soon as the form is submitted through the web.
