25|$|Williams {{released}} a statement on social media branding the comments about her unborn child as racist, noting that it saddened her <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> society where these comments can be made. Năstase then apologised on social media regarding the comments he made about Williams, but made comments about Konta speaking to the umpire which upset him. In a further interview with the BBC, Năstase justified his comments to Konta stating that he only abused her after being ejected from the court and did so as a fan rather than a captain. Năstase additionally added that he regretted his behaviour in the incident. Nastase was not invited to the French Open and Wimbledon following his suspension. The Madrid Open however invited Nastase {{to be part of}} the prize giving ceremony, which ironically was won by Halep (another Romanian player). This was a move that was deemed irresponsible by the WTA who had revoked Nastase's privileges while the ITF carried out its investigation.|$|E

500|$|Critics have {{compared}} Eliot to Yeats. Yeats believed <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> cyclical world, saying, [...] "If it {{be true that}} God is a circle whose centre is everywhere, the saint goes to the centre, the poet and the artist to the ring where everything comes round again." [...] Eliot believed that such a system is stuck within time. Eliot was influenced by Yeats's reading of Dante. This appears in Eliot's Ash-Wednesday by changing Yeats's [...] "desire for absolution" [...] away from a humanistic approach. When Eliot wrote about personal topics, he tended to use Dante as a reference point. He also relied on Dante's imagery: {{the idea of the}} [...] "refining fire" [...] in the Four Quartets and in The Waste Land comes from Purgatorio, and the celestial rose and fire imagery of Paradiso makes its way into the series.|$|E
500|$|Franklin {{argues that}} in modern society, control-related and {{prescriptive}} technologies are dominant. [...] "When work is organized as {{a sequence of}} separately executable steps, the control over the work moves to the organizer, the boss or manager," [...] she writes. [...] "In political terms, prescriptive technologies are designs for compliance." [...] For Franklin, workers accustomed to following prescriptive rules become used to seeing external control and internal compliance as normal and necessary. They also {{come to believe that}} there is only one prescribed way of performing a wide variety of tasks. [...] "While we should not forget that these prescriptive technologies are often exceedingly effective and efficient, they come with an enormous social mortgage. The mortgage means <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> culture of compliance, that we are ever more conditioned to accept orthodoxy as normal, and to accept {{that there is only one}} way of doing 'it'." ...|$|E
500|$|While some reviewers {{regard the}} novel as a thriller, others {{see it as an}} example of post-millennial science fiction with stories set in the [...] "technocultural future-present". Some reviewers note that the novel furthers the post-millennial trend in science fiction of {{illustrating}} society's inability to imagine a definitive future and the use of technologies once considered advanced or academic now commonplace within society and its vernacular. Gibson said that the only science fiction elements are [...] "he Footage and Cayce's special talents" [...] but that he [...] "never bought that conceit that science fiction is about the future". Dennis Danvers explained the use of science fiction as a narrative strategy: cience fiction, in effect, has become a narrative strategy, a way of approaching story, in which not only characters must be invented, but the world and its ways as well, without resorting to magic or the supernatural, where the fantasy folks work. A realist wrestling with the woes of the middle class can leave the world out of it by and large except for an occasional swipe at the shallowness of suburbia. A science fiction writer must invent the world where the story takes place, often from the ground up, a process usually called world-building. In other words, in a science fiction novel, the world itself is a distinctive and crucial character in the plot, without whom the story could not take place, whether it's the world of Dune or Neuromancer or 1984. The world is the story as much as the story is in the world. Part of Gibson's point ... is <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> time of such accelerated change and layered realities, that we're all in that boat, like it or not. A novel set in the [...] "real world" [...] now has to answer the question, [...] "Which one?" ...|$|E

2500|$|This {{figure was}} {{obtained}} by doubling 78 billion light-years {{on the assumption that}} it is a radius.

This figure was very widely reported. A press release from Montana State University–Bozeman, where Cornish works as an astrophysicist, noted the error when discussing a story that had appeared in Discover magazine, saying [...] "Discover mistakenly reported that the universe was 156 billion light-years wide, thinking that 78 billion was the radius of the universe instead of its diameter."

2500|$|In 2003, Cornish et al. {{found this}} lower {{bound for the}} {{diameter}} of the whole universe (not just the observable part), if we postulate that the universe is finite in size due to its having a nontrivial topology, with this lower bound based on the estimated current distance between points that we can see {{on opposite sides of the}} cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR). If the whole universe is smaller than this sphere, then light has had time to circumnavigate it since the Big Bang, producing multiple images of distant points in the CMBR, which would show up as patterns of repeating circles. Cornish et al. looked for such an effect at scales of up to 24 gigaparsecs (...) and failed to find it, and suggested that if they could extend their search to all possible orientations, they would then [...] "be able to exclude the possibility <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> universe smaller than 24 Gpc in diameter". The authors also estimated that with [...] "lower noise and higher resolution CMB maps (from WMAP's extended mission and from Planck), we will be able to search for smaller circles and extend the limit to ~28 Gpc." [...] This estimate of the maximum lower bound that can be established by future observations corresponds to a radius of 14 gigaparsecs, or around 46 billion light years, about the same as the figure for the radius of the visible universe (whose radius is defined by the CMBR sphere) given in the opening section. A 2012 preprint by most of the same authors as the Cornish et al. paper has extended the current lower bound to a diameter of 98.5% {{the diameter of the}} CMBR sphere, or about 26 Gpc.|$|E

By the way, the ape is 45, which is half the age of Anthony Kiedis. Red Hot Chili Peppers, poor man's Faith No More, don't ever forget it." [...] After receiving major backlash from fans, Gutfeld decided to take further shots by saying [...] "Two days ago I said that Red Hot Chili Peppers were the worst band on the planet. I {{received a lot of}} flack from fans all over the world. What I meant to say was the Red Hot Chili Peppers [...] the worst band in the universe. I’d like to apologize for that confusion. I want to explain <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> binary universe," [...] he continued. [...] "You're either a Faith No More fan, or a Red Hot Chili Peppers fan. You cannot love Mike Patton and Anthony Kiedis, because they are two different people. You have to love Mike Patton, you cannot love Anthony Kiedis. So that is why the Red Hot Chili Peppers are the worst band in the universe, because Faith No More is the greatest band in the universe." [...] Flea responded to Gutfeld's comments a few days later saying [...] "I remember seeing a poll recently that said people who watch Fox News knew less about world affairs than people who watch no news at all.
