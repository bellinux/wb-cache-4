5|$|Heartstrings, {{like the}} first record, was very much {{influenced}} by film, and is recognized for its cinematic quality. Juanita indicated that they deliberately made the album {{to sound like a}} soundtrack to a movie. Howling Bells along with the production team watched Paris, Texas and Blue Velvet, in an effort to replicate the mood, emotion, and atmosphere of these two films in particular. Other films that {{played a significant role in}} the making of Heartstrings include, Badlands, Bonnie and Clyde, Klute, , Nashville, Pleasantville, <b>The</b> <b>Last</b> <b>Picture</b> Show, and Vivre sa vie.|$|E
5|$|In 1971 Peter Bogdanovich, {{with whom}} Fields {{had worked on}} Targets, {{recruited}} her to edit What's Up, Doc? (1972); Bogdanovich had edited his previous films himself. The film was very successful, and is now considered as the second of Bogdanovich's 'golden period' that commenced with <b>The</b> <b>Last</b> <b>Picture</b> Show (1971). What's Up, Doc? established Fields as an editor on studio films. She subsequently edited Bogdanovich's final golden period film, Paper Moon (1973), {{as well as his}} less successful film Daisy Miller (1974).|$|E
5|$|Foster {{looked for}} a {{director}} and Peter Bogdanovich came to his attention. Bogdanovich's agent, Jeff Berg, set up a special screening of his client's soon-to-be released <b>The</b> <b>Last</b> <b>Picture</b> Show (1971) for Foster with McQueen in attendance. They loved it and met with the director and a deal was made. However, Warner Bros. approached Bogdanovich with an offer to direct What's Up, Doc? (1972), starring Barbra Streisand, with the stipulation {{that he had to}} start right away. The director wanted to do both, and the studio refused. When McQueen found out, he became upset and told Bogdanovich {{that he was going to}} get someone else to direct The Getaway.|$|E

5|$|Peter Bogdanovich, whose <b>The</b> <b>Last</b> <b>Picture</b> Show {{impressed}} McQueen {{and producer}} David Foster, was originally hired {{as the director}} of The Getaway. Thompson came on board to write the script of his crime novel's film adaptation. Creative differences ensued between Thompson and McQueen and the author was fired along with Bogdanovichthey were replaced with Hill and Peckinpah. Principal photography commenced on February 7, 1972, on location in Texas. During production, McQueen and MacGraw began an affair, and McQueen and Peckinpah were involved in heated arguments due to the latter's increasing alcohol intake. Originally scored by Peckinpah collaborator Jerry Fielding, McQueen became unimpressed with Fielding's soundtrack and, at his behest, hired Quincy Jones to rescore it. Jones was later nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score for his work.|$|E
5|$|Until 19 August {{the weather}} was {{unsuitable}} for photography. Because Frances and Elsie insisted that the fairies would not show themselves if others were watching, Elsie's mother was persuaded to visit her sister's for tea, leaving the girls alone. In her absence the girls took several photographs, two of which appeared to show fairies. In the first, Frances and the Leaping Fairy, Frances is shown in profile with a winged fairy close by her nose. The second, Fairy offering Posy of Harebells to Elsie, shows a fairy either hovering or tiptoeing on a branch, and offering Elsie a flower. Two days later the girls took <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>picture,</b> Fairies and Their Sun-Bath.|$|E

40|$|In late 2012 a {{communications}} satellite called EchoStar XVI launched into space from Kazakhstan where it {{remains in a}} geostationary orbit around Earth. The satellite contains artist and geographer Trevor Paglen’s <b>The</b> <b>Last</b> <b>Pictures,</b> a collection of one hundred images, sourced from libraries and artists, microetched onto a gold-plated disc. Paglen’s project is both a continuation of, and a critical response to, {{the notion of the}} time capsule as a means of delivering, either to a terrestrial future or to some extraterrestrial destination, an abbreviated representative sample of “civilization. ” The utopianism that motivates many time-capsule projects, whether it is articulated through a belief in the power to communicate with a distant future or with some cosmically remote intelligence, is also a manifestation, this article argues, of progressive modernity’s commitment to timekeeping—to the successful capture and command, interpretation and anticipation, of past and future times. Paglen’s project is considered here as a retort to the repressions and exclusions that underwrite the optimism of the conventional capsule; <b>The</b> <b>Last</b> <b>Pictures</b> is <b>the</b> futureless call of the Anthropocene...|$|R
25|$|Leachman won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for her {{performance}} in <b>The</b> <b>Last</b> <b>Picture</b> Show (1971), {{based on the}} bestselling book by Larry McMurtry. She played the high school gym teacher's neglected wife, with whom Timothy Bottoms' character has an affair. Director Peter Bogdanovich had predicted during production that she would win an Academy Award for {{her performance}}. The part was originally offered to Ellen Burstyn, but Burstyn wanted another role in the film.|$|E
25|$|There {{are four}} small walls to climb, {{but they may}} all be outflanked {{on the right side}} if the {{conditions}} are good. From the Western summit the flank seems nearly as forbidding as the wall itself, but at a close distance it is not too difficult and no equipment should be necessary. However, on poor conditions, the Talus may be very loose and great caution is advised. On days with fresh snow, like <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>picture,</b> equipment will probably be necessary on all routes.|$|E
25|$|Bogdanovich {{followed}} up <b>The</b> <b>Last</b> <b>Picture</b> Show {{with the popular}} comedy What's Up, Doc? (1972), starring Barbra Streisand and Ryan O'Neal, a screwball comedy indebted to Hawks's Bringing Up Baby (1938) and His Girl Friday (1940). Despite his reliance on homage to bygone cinema, Bogdanovich solidified his status {{as one of a}} new breed of A-list directors that included Academy Award winners Francis Ford Coppola and William Friedkin, with whom he formed The Directors Company. The Directors Company was a generous production deal with Paramount Pictures that essentially gave the directors carte blanche if they kept within budget limitations. It was through this entity that Bogdanovich's Paper Moon (1973) was produced.|$|E

25|$|Both films occasioned major {{disputes}} between Bogdanovich, who still demanded {{a measure of}} control over his films, and the studios, which controlled the financing and final cut of both films. Mask was released with a song score by Bob Seger against Bogdanovich's wishes (he favored Bruce Springsteen), and Bogdanovich has often complained that the version of Texasville that was released was not the film he had intended. A director's cut of Mask, slightly longer and with Springsteen's songs, was belatedly released on DVD in 2006. A director's cut of Texasville was released on laserdisc, and the theatrical cut was released on DVD by MGM in 2005. Around {{the time of the}} release of Texasville, Bogdanovich also revisited his earliest success, <b>The</b> <b>Last</b> <b>Picture</b> Show, and produced a slightly modified director's cut. Since that time, his recut has been the only available version of the film.|$|E
500|$|Fields {{then left}} American Graffiti. It took {{another six months}} of editing to create a shorter, 110-minute version of the film, but upon its release in 1973 American Graffiti was {{extremely}} successful both with critics and at the box office. Shortly after its release, Roger Greenspun described the film and its editing: [...] "American Graffiti exists {{not so much in}} its individual stories as in its orchestration of many stories, its sense of time and place. Although it is full of the material of fashionable nostalgia, it never exploits nostalgia. In its feeling for movement and music and the vitality of the night—and even in its vision in white—it is oddly closer to some early Fellini than to the recent American past of, say, <b>The</b> <b>Last</b> <b>Picture</b> Show or Summer of '42." ...|$|E
500|$|Following {{the success}} of the song, Williams was invited to appear as a guest on the Grand Ole Opry, on June 11, 1949. After the performance, Williams {{received}} a standing ovation. [...] "Lovesick Blues" [...] became his signature song, which he used to close his shows. It was also his first number one hit, and garnered Williams the stage nickname of [...] "The Lovesick Blues Boy". In 1949, the singer received second billing behind Eddy Arnold on the list of the [...] "Year's Top Selling Folk Artists". [...] Williams' version of the song was featured in the films <b>The</b> <b>Last</b> <b>Picture</b> Show (1971), Forrest Gump (1994) and The Shawshank Redemption (1994). In 2004, [...] "Lovesick Blues" [...] was added to the National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress.|$|E

500|$|In 2006, Ebert noted his own [...] "tendency {{to place}} what I now {{consider}} the year's best film in second place, perhaps because I {{was trying to}} make some kind of point with my top pick," [...] adding, [...] "In 1968, I should have ranked [...] above The Battle of Algiers. [...] In 1971, McCabe and Mrs. Miller was better than <b>The</b> <b>Last</b> <b>Picture</b> Show. [...] In 1974, Chinatown was probably better, in a different way, than Scenes from a Marriage. [...] In 1976, how could I rank Small Change above Taxi Driver? [...] In 1978, I would put Days of Heaven above An Unmarried Woman. And in 1980, of course, Raging Bull was a better film than The Black Stallion... although I later chose Raging Bull as the best film of the entire decade of the 1980s, it was only the second-best film of 1980... am I the same person I was in 1968, 1971, or 1980?
