5|$|This {{process can}} be modeled by Rule 184, as follows. The {{particles}} are modeled as points that are aligned, not with {{the cells of the}} automaton, but rather with the interstices between cells. <b>Two</b> <b>consecutive</b> cells that both have state 0 model a particle at the space between these two cells that moves rightwards one cell at each time step. Symmetrically, <b>two</b> <b>consecutive</b> cells that both have state 1 model an antiparticle that moves leftwards one cell at each time step. The remaining possibilities for <b>two</b> <b>consecutive</b> cells are that they both have differing states; this is interpreted as modeling a background material without any particles in it, through which the particles move. With this interpretation, the particles and antiparticles interact by ballistic annihilation: when a rightwards-moving particle and a leftwards-moving antiparticle meet, the result is a region of background from which both particles have vanished, without any effect on any other nearby particles.|$|E

5|$|In a sense, Rule 184 solves this problem, as follows. if Rule 184 is run on {{a finite}} set of cells with {{periodic}} boundary conditions, with an unequal number of 0s and 1s, then each cell will eventually see <b>two</b> <b>consecutive</b> states of the majority value infinitely often, but will see <b>two</b> <b>consecutive</b> states of the minority value only finitely many times. The majority problem cannot be solved perfectly if it is required that all cells eventually stabilize to the majority state but the Rule 184 solution avoids this impossibility result by relaxing the criterion by which the automaton recognizes a majority.|$|E
