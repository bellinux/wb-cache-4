5|$|In 2005, Sisimpur {{aired in}} Bangladesh. This co-production's {{goal was to}} improve school {{achievement}} and decrease drop-out rates for children before the third grade. This difficult co-production, which was beset by political difficulties and severe flooding that delayed production, was depicted in the 2006 documentary The World According to Sesame Street. Also in 2005, the producers of the Kosovo co-production (Rruga Sesam/Ulica Sezam) chose to present the languages of the region more evenly. Instead of showing words on screen, children were challenged to label objects verbally, thus learning that there are different ways <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> thing. The Workshop worked in conjunction with UNICEF to produce this show, {{to aid in the}} peace process between Albanians and Serbs. One of its goals was to demonstrate to Albanian and Serbian children that their counterparts were like them.|$|E
25|$|IM6, IM7, etc. are {{trade names}} for {{particular}} graphite {{produced by the}} Hexcel Corporation. These numbers are not industry standards nor an indication of quality, especially since other companies use the designations to refer to graphite not made by Hexcel. At best, they allow you to compare {{the quality of the}} material used to build different rods by the same manufacturer: an IM7 rod would use better graphite than an IM6 rod if both are made by the same manufacturer. It is more difficult <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> about rods from two different companies, since they could be made from material from completely different manufacturers.|$|E
25|$|In Leon Festinger's {{cognitive}} dissonance experiment, {{participants were asked}} to perform a boring task. They were divided into 2 groups and given two different pay scales. At the study's end, some participants were paid $1 to say that they enjoyed the task and another group of participants was paid $20 <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> lie. The first group ($1) later reported liking the task better than the second group ($20). Festinger's explanation was that for people in the first group being paid only $1 is not sufficient incentive for lying and those who were paid $1 experienced dissonance. They could only overcome that dissonance by justifying their lies by changing their previously unfavorable attitudes about the task. Being paid $20 provides a reason for the doing the boring task, therefore no dissonance.|$|E

500|$|A {{review in}} the Times Literary Supplement dated 4 September 1941 stated {{that there was a}} [...] "note of quiescence, even of bleak resignation" [...] in the poem and that it [...] "lost that spice of wit which was woven into the logic of the earlier poems". Later, Bernard Bergonzi claimed that [...] "The Dry Salvages is the least {{satisfactory}} of the sequence, though {{at the same time it}} contains some of its best lines. The opening lines are poor, in a weakly sub-Whitmanesque fashion. Yet the writing suddenly picks up at the words, 'The river is within us,' and from there to the end of the section we have a magnificently sustained sequence". F. B. Pinion believed that [...] "'The Dry Salvages' is a complicated, uneven, and rather prosy poem, in which Eliot continues <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> thing, with some progression, mainly in maritime imagery".|$|E

2500|$|In spring 2009, {{the band}} began {{recording}} material for its third studio album. However, on July 6, 2009, Ryan Ross and Jon Walker announced via the band's official website {{that the two}} were leaving the band. In an interview following the split, Ross explained that he first brought the idea to Smith in late June 2009 over lunch: [...] "Spencer and I had lunch and caught up for a while, and then the big question came up, like, 'Well, {{what do you want}} to do?' and I said, 'Well, I think it might be best if we kind of do our own thing for a while,' and he said, 'I'm glad you said that, because I was going <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> thing,'" [...] Ross recalled. [...] "And there was really no argument, which is really the best way that could've worked out." [...] Ross said the split was largely due to creative differences between him and Urie. Urie wanted the band to explore a more polished pop sound, while Ross – and, by extension, Walker – was interested in making retro-inspired rock.|$|E

In 1972, a live commercial was being performed by DJ [...] "Dr. Jerry" [...] Carroll, who ended the scene {{by reading the}} shop's slogan, [...] "his prices are insane", in this manner: [...] "Crazy Eddie, his prices are IN-SA-A-A-A-A-ANE!". Antar telephoned and told Carroll <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> line <b>the</b> <b>same</b> way every time, and thus a working relationship had begun.|$|R

2500|$|Officers of the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) wear {{a uniform}} which is {{somewhat}} different, reflecting the different {{roots of the}} force {{and nature of the}} role that it carried out for much of its history. [...] The main colour to be found is a dark and light green with the uniform looking very unlike police uniforms over in Great Britain. The RUC officially described this as 'rifle green', that is <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> colour as used by Irish and rifle regiments of the British Army, such as the Rifles (formerly the Light Infantry and the Royal Green Jackets) and Royal Irish Regiment. This reflects the force's de facto status as more of a paramilitary force, or gendarmerie, than police forces in Great Britain. When the six new versions of the PSNI uniform were introduced, in March 2002, the term 'bottle green' was used for basically the same colour. This was perhaps seen as being a less confrontational description and having less of a military connotation, in keeping with the spirit of the time. RIC uniforms were originally a very dark green almost black colour. The custodian helmet was never worn by either the RUC or the PSNI, although a similar design known as the [...] "night helmet" [...] was worn on night shifts by the RUC until the early 1970s, and previously by the RIC.|$|E
2500|$|Each of {{the regulars}} brought their {{individual}} style to playing the game. Clement Freud liked to make lists and to challenge {{with only a}} few seconds to go. He was among the show's more competitive players, regularly referring to the rules and deprecating any deviation from them. Derek Nimmo often improvised descriptions of his experiences abroad, many derived from his extensive theatrical tours. He too was highly competitive, and was known for berating the chairman frequently. Peter Jones once said that in all his years playing the game, he never quite got the hang of it; nonetheless, his self-deprecating, laconic style suited the essential silliness of the show. Kenneth Williams was often the star of the show: his flamboyant tantrums, arch put-downs, and mock sycophancy made him the audience's favourite. Williams often stretched out his speeches by extending every syllable to breaking point (some words lasting for up to three seconds), and his outbursts of mock-anger regularly included his catchphrase [...] "I've come all the way from Great Portland Street", as though he had journeyed for miles, when in fact his home was just {{around the corner from the}} BBC studios where most recordings took place. Merton frequently launches into surreal flights of fancy and fantasy, such as claiming to have had unusual occupations or to have experienced significant historical events. He also often wins points by challenging just before the whistle or for humorous challenges, another technique being <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> word in the singular and the plural, for inexperienced panelists to falsely challenge.|$|E
2500|$|On July 6, 2009, Ryan Ross and Jon Walker {{announced}} via the band's {{official website}} {{that the two}} were leaving the band. The statement, in part, read: [...] "Ryan Ross and Jon Walker will be leaving Panic at the Disco {{to embark on a}} musical excursion of their own. Though the four of us have made music together in the past, we’ve creatively evolved in different directions which has compromised what each of us want to personally achieve. Over the years, we have remained close and honest with each other, which helped us to realize that our goals were different and that parting ways is truly what is best for each of us." [...] In an interview following the split, Ross explained that he first brought the idea to Smith in late June 2009 over lunch: [...] "Spencer and I had lunch and caught up for a while, and then the big question came up, like, 'Well, {{what do you want to}} do?' and I said, 'Well, I think it might be best if we kind of do our own thing for a while,' and he said, 'I'm glad you said that, because I was going <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> thing,' [...] " [...] Ross recalled.

5000|$|Roger Ebert {{also saw}} {{the message of the}} film as self-contradictory, writing: [...] "I'm also {{somewhat}} disturbed by the central theme of the movie. 'Billy Jack' seems <b>to</b> be <b>saying</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> thing as 'Born Losers,' that a gun is better than a constitution in the enforcement of justice." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Well, curious laws {{sometimes}} do {{get into the}} statute-books, and a body must take them as he finds them.

2500|$|Sven Pipien remarked, [...] "The {{beauty of}} Luther {{is more than}} any note he's playing is the feeling behind that note.

Eddie [...] is not the easiest guy to replace but Adam is his own man AND he fills those shoes really well." ...|$|R
60|$|And {{everybody}} seemed <b>to</b> be <b>saying</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> {{thing at}} <b>the</b> <b>same</b> time. <b>The</b> name of Sidney Wilton was in everybody's mouth. It was unfortunate {{that he had}} been a member of a defunct ministry, but then it had always been understood that he had always disapproved of all their measures. There was not the slightest evidence of this, but everybody chose to believe it.|$|R

50|$|Justice Menhennitt {{described}} why the proviso {{from the}} definition of child destruction in the English legislation should also apply to {{the definition of}} abortion, by pointing out that under another provision of <b>the</b> <b>same</b> law, abortion was an alternative charge to child destruction and vice versa (that is, the jury could choose to substitute one charge for the other). As such, there was a strong argument <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that <b>the</b> <b>same</b> proviso should apply to both.|$|R
50|$|The charter goes on <b>to</b> <b>say</b> “that <b>the</b> <b>same</b> be and is hereby Incorporated into a Township by {{the name}} of Jamaica”—its name from the Natick word for beaver and not the Caribbean island.
