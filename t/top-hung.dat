50|$|Based on Japanese Shoji Screens, Shoji blinds are {{normally}} thinner {{so they can}} be <b>top-hung</b> on a panel-blind track- 17mm thick consisting of a laminate of Obeche timber for lightness and strength. The wood has to be air-dried for stability as the slightest warping will distort the whole panel. No bottom track is required and almost any fabric or paper can be employed, although 90% of all Shoji blinds use white polyester to imitate 'Washi' Japanese paper. Although they have been featured several times on UK national TV, there is currently only one manufacturer.|$|E
50|$|At {{ground level}} the Lake and Spence Street facade carried large, {{rectangular}} shop windows of clear plate-glass imported from England. On {{the first and}} second floor levels the facade was executed in an imposing, ornate style, based predominantly on Classical and Romanesque elements. On the upper storeys the fenestration consisted of a combination of fixed and <b>top-hung</b> sash windows, with a single round window incorporated into the facade at the Lake and Spence Street corner at the second floor level. Immediately above the awning there was also a series of narrow, rectangular, bottom-hinged windows. Early photographs suggest the upper storey windows were filled with opaque glass.|$|E
5000|$|A {{casement}} {{window is}} a window with a hinged sash that swings in or out like a door comprising either a side-hung, <b>top-hung</b> (also called [...] "awning window"; see below), or occasionally bottom-hung sash {{or a combination of}} these types, sometimes with fixed panels on one or more sides of the sash. In the USA, these are usually opened using a crank, but in parts of Europe they tend to use projection friction stays and espagnolette locking. Formerly, plain hinges were used with a casement stay. Handing applies to casement windows to determine direction of swing; a casement window may be left-handed, right-handed, or double. The casement window is the dominant type now found in modern buildings in the UK and many other parts of Europe.|$|E
40|$|Anthropogenic {{structures}} fragment river connectivity, impeding {{the migration}} of diadromous fish between essential habitats. Tide gates are used worldwide primarily for flood protection and land reclamation by closing under hydraulic pressure during the flood tide and opening when head differential is sufficient during the ebb. Although tide gates are known to decrease fish species richness, abundance, and movement, their impacts on {{the migration of}} ecologically and socioeconomically important diadromous fish in terms of passage efficiency and delay have not been reported elsewhere. Acoustic and passive integrated transponder telemetry revealed that passage efficiencies of upstream migrating adult brown trout, Salmo trutta (92 %), and downstream migrating juvenile sea trout smolts (96 - 100 %) and adult European eel, Anguilla anguilla (98 %), were high at <b>top-hung</b> tide gates in two small English streams. However, these fish experienced delay at the gates (adult brown trout, median = 6. 0 h; sea trout smolts, mean = 6. 5 and 23. 7 h; eels, mean = 66. 2 h) when compared to migration through unimpeded reaches. The percentage of time the gates were closed and mean angle of opening were positively related to delay in both species and life stages. Diel periodicity also influenced delay for smolts and eels, which were more active at night. For adult trout, water temperature was positively associated with delay. Upstream and downstream water temperature and salinity were influenced by the temporal operation of the gates. Orifices installed in the gates did not mitigate delay for adult or juvenile trout. For adult eels, delay was decreased when an orifice was operational, although this coincided with more eels first approaching the gates when open, higher tides and greater saline intrusion upstream of the gates. When gates were open, fish would not pass immediately through, indicating the potential influence of a behavioural avoidance component. To {{examine the effect of}} hydrodynamics created by <b>top-hung</b> tide gates with different aperture sizes, wild sea trout smolt behaviour was observed by video cameras in an experimental flume at night. Avoidance responses occurred within an average of 1. 4 fish body lengths upstream of the gate. Fish were more likely to exhibit avoidance (switch in orientation from negative to positive rheotaxis, increased tail beat frequency and/or retreat upstream) in the vicinity of a model gate with a smaller angle of opening and passage aperture. Overall, <b>top-hung</b> tide gates delayed the migration of diadromous fish, potentially increasing energy expenditure and predation risk. Delay was not decreased by orifices. Modifying or replacing <b>top-hung</b> tide gates with designs that allow them to open wider and for longer could reduce migratory delay and improve the environmental conditions that cause behavioural avoidance. <br/...|$|E
40|$|As part of flood {{protection}} and land reclamation schemes, tide gates allow rivers to discharge to sea when open, and prevent {{salt water intrusion}} when closed. Their impact on diadromous fish migration between essential spawning and rearing habitats, {{and the effectiveness of}} mitigation measures, have received little consideration. The River Meon, UK, discharges to sea through four <b>top-hung</b> counterbalanced tide gates. In March 2012, the gates were replaced with new ones of the same design, but with an orifice installed in two of them partly to improve fish passage. Sixty downstream migrating juvenile sea trout, Salmo trutta, were trapped approximately 4. 9 km upstream of the tidal limit and tagged with acoustic transmitters in April 2011 (n = 30) and 2012 (n = 30). Tagged individuals were detected by acoustic receivers placed near the tide gates before (year 1) and after (year 2) orifice installation. Of the fish that approached the tide gates, 95. 8 % and 100. 0 % successfully passed in years 1 and 2, respectively. The speed of migration at the gates was slower than for upstream and downstream reaches, and was positively related to percentage of time the gates were open. Presence of the orifices did not influence delay. Overall, <b>top-hung</b> tide gates delayed sea trout migration, potentially increasing the risk of predation and energy expenditure during the vulnerable juvenile life stage...|$|E
40|$|Tide gates form a {{temporal}} barrier to fish migration, closing during the flood tide and opening during the ebb, primarily for flood prevention and land reclamation. Their impact on downstream adult migration of the critically endangered European eel, Anguilla anguilla, is unknown. The River Stiffkey, UK, has three <b>top-hung</b> tide gates (one counterbalanced, two not) through which it discharges into the North Sea. Adult eels of silver appearance (n?=? 118) were caught between 0. 5 and 6. 0 km upstream from the tide gates in Autumn 2011 and implanted with 23 mm half-duplex passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags. Tagged individuals were detected by PIT antennae {{located near the}} tide gates. Of the eels tagged, 80 were detected actively migrating downstream to the gates. Escapement past the gates was 98. 3 %. Speed of migration was slower near the gates than for an unimpeded upstream reach and was positively and negatively related to mean degree of gate opening and mean light intensity, respectively. When the largest gate was modified through installation of an orifice intended to improve upstream passage of sea trout and juvenile eels, downstream migration was more rapid when it was operating. However, video analysis revealed that eels did not pass through the orifice, meaning that faster migration {{may have been a}} result of the gates being open on more occasions when eels initially approached them, or the lower tides and upstream saline intrusion that occurred during these periods. <b>Top-hung</b> tide gates in the River Stiffkey delayed eel migration, potentially increasing the risk of predation and energy expenditure immediately prior to a 5000 – 6000 km migration to spawning grounds in the Sargasso Se...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Analytical {{modelling}} {{and model}} validation of high force-to-volume (HF 2 V) damping devices and a DAD non-dilating steel connection utilising these devices is presented. The 2 D exterior connection design incorporates a <b>top-hung</b> angle for the beam-column connection and HF 2 V devices create a damage-free moment resisting connection. Experimental results show consistently repeatable hysteretic behaviour to 4 % drift with neither stiffness nor strength degradation. The analytical {{model of the}} connection shows good agreement between experimental and model results. The rate-dependent model defines overall hysteresis using a predictor-corrector solution to the governing non-linear ODE. Based entirely on rational mechanics, the model does not require prior experimental data for empirical calibration, enabling simultaneous design of the desired connection mechanics and energy dissipation, and the device requirements. ...|$|E
40|$|Tide gates, used to {{regulate}} tidal flow {{as part of}} land reclamation programmes, temporally block fish movement by closing during the flood tide. Their impact on the upstream movement of brown trout, Salmo trutta, and other fish species has received little consideration. The River Stiffkey, UK, discharges into the North Sea via three <b>top-hung</b> tide gates, one counterbalanced (Gate 1), and two not (collectively referred to as Gate 2). Three-hundred adult trout were caught between 0. 5 and 6. 0 km upstream from the gates on 20 separate days between July and December 2011 (n = 15 per day) and implanted with 23 mm half-duplex Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) tags before being released 15 m downstream from Gate 1 where PIT antennas were located on either side. Overall, gate attraction (percentage of fish released that were detected {{by at least one}} antenna) and passage efficiencies (number of fish that passed Gate 1 reported as a proportion of those that approached) were 96. 7 % and 92. 4 %, respectively. The operation of an orifice, installed to improve connectivity for adult trout and juvenile eels, did not influence passage efficiency or delay. Of the fish that passed Gate 1 when the orifice was operational, 42. 6 – 55. 7 % approached the orifice entrance and 70. 6 – 92. 3 % of these passed through. Individuals that passed through the orifice were larger than those that did not. Movement past the tide gates (median duration = 6. 04 h) took 6 times longer than passage through two unimpeded reaches upstream. Duration of passage through the gates was predominately related to the mean angle of gate opening during the time prior to passage, followed by water temperature. Overall, a counterbalanced <b>top-hung</b> tide gate delayed the upstream movement of brown trout, highlighting a need to assess and potentially mitigate the impact of gates with more restrictive opening apertures and durations...|$|E
40|$|The 2001 {{edition of}} the CICIND model code for {{concrete}} chimneys encourages the designer to include the effects of ductility when designing chimneys in high seismic regions. The inclusion of ductility results in lower seismic forces, significant cost savings and safer chimneys, and could result in significant cracking and local longitudinal tensile strains {{in the order of}} 1 - 3 % in the windshield under extreme earthquake excitation (return period in excess of 500 years). In regions of medium to high seismicity, <b>top-hung</b> steel liner systems are usually cost effective as they possess good strength to weight ratios and being a tension system have some inherent ductility. As an alternative solution, the installation of the lightweight borosilicate blocks (Pennguard ® Block Lining System) attached directly to the inside face of the windshield appears to have considerable merit from a cost and performance perspective. The 50 mm thick borosilicate glass blocks possess excellent thermal and acid resisting properties. In addition the blocks are extremely light (with a specific weight in the order of 0. 2) and therefore transmit a negligible seismic force to the windshield and hence are ideal in high seismic regions. The results from the test program reported in this paper demonstrate that the overall performance of the Pennguard blocks and adhesive was excellent and superior to that of the reinforced concrete windshield when subject to earthquake ground shaking. The adhesive membrane used to attach the blocks to the windshield has some flexibility thus allowing some relative movement between the two surfaces. During moderate earthquake events that induce less than 1 % longitudinal strain in the windshield, the Pennguard blocks and adhesive would be undamaged, although the cracks in the windshield would need some minor repairs. Under extreme earthquake events that could significantly damage the windshield and induce longitudinal strains in the order of 1 - 3 %, the Pennguard ® Block Lining System would be damaged but would remain intact and be repairable...|$|E
