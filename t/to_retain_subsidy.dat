5000|$|In {{leading up}} to the 1986 GATT Ministerial Conference in Punta del Este, Uruguay, farm lobbies in {{developed}} countries strongly resisted compromises on agriculture. In this context, the idea of exempting production and [...] "trade-neutral" [...] subsidies from WTO commitments was first proposed by the United States in 1987, and echoed soon after by the EU. By guaranteeing farmers continued support, it also neutralised opposition. In exchange for bringing agriculture within the disciplines of the WTO and committing to future reduction of trade-distorting subsidies, developed countries would be allowed <b>to</b> <b>retain</b> <b>subsidies</b> that cause [...] "not more than minimal trade distortion" [...] in order to deliver various public policy objectives.|$|R
5000|$|Journalist Sidney Lubell {{found in}} his post-1948 survey of voters that Truman, not Dewey, seemed the safer, more {{conservative}} candidate to the [...] "new middle class" [...] that had developed over the previous 20 years. He wrote that [...] "to an appreciable part of the electorate, the Democrats had replaced the Republicans {{as the party of}} prosperity" [...] during and after the war. Lubell quoted a man who, when asked why he did not vote Republican after moving to the suburbs, answered [...] "I own a nice home, have a new car and am much better off than my parents were. I've been a Democrat all my life. Why should I change?" [...] Dewey's promise of a [...] "great house cleaning" [...] in Washington worried an Iowa minister who wanted <b>to</b> <b>retain</b> farm <b>subsidies</b> for parishioners. Worried about the consequences of another depression, he voted Democratic {{for the first time in}} his church's history. Truman received a record number of Catholic votes, exceeding even the Catholic support of Al Smith in 1928, in part because Wallace drew leftists away from the Democrats.|$|R
40|$|The donor advised fund (DAF) is {{changing}} longstanding giving norms in United States philanthropy. DAF contributions {{now account for}} around 8. 4 % of giving by individuals in the U. S. Over half of those contributions go to national DAF sponsors that have relationships with large commercial investment firms like Fidelity, Vanguard, and Schwab. This Article seeks to advance {{the understanding of the}} donor advised fund and to address two of the main policy questions: whether to require a mandatory distribution of funds by DAFs and their sponsoring organizations and how to respond to the increased use of DAFs for noncash charitable contributions. Part I of the Article provides a brief overview of DAFs. Part II of the Article discusses the different ways DAFs are viewed—as quasi-private foundations, public charity substitutes, or as catalysts for new charitable giving. Each view suggests a different regulatory approach. Part III focuses distinctly on the national sponsoring organization and the reason for its section 501 (c) (3) status. The Article argues that as an organization that fulfills its mission by spending, it is appropriate for policymakers to require each fund to spend down contributions over a range of years. Part IV of the Article examines the solicitation by DAF-sponsoring organizations of charitable contributions of property, including privately traded stock, real estate, fine art, collectibles, and publicly traded securities. The increasing use of DAFs for noncash contributions will accentuate the problems of current law, which include a deduction for unrealized appreciation, overvaluation of contributed property, uncertain benefits to charity, equity concerns, and enforcement. Part IV argues that if Congress intends <b>to</b> <b>retain</b> the <b>subsidy</b> for property contributions, DAFs present an opportunity to improve and lower the cost of the subsidy both by reducing the amount of unrealized appreciation that may be deducted and by basing the amount of the deduction for property contributions on the net benefit to charity...|$|R
40|$|The article {{considers}} the problem, {{very important in}} existing conditions, of a choice of a formula of agricultural policy towards private farming. In the theory {{as well as in}} practice two standpoints collide. The proponents of the first declare for a so-called pro-income conception of policy towards farmers. Its essence lies in creating favourable income conditions for farmes by means of an appropriate agricultural pricing policy. An opposite tendency is represented by those economists who declare for financial restrictions towards farmers according to the principle of a so-called hard-to-get money-policy. They argue against the pro-income agricultural policy raising the arguments that such a policy is socially expensive, that it is a source of inflation in the whole economy, it weakens the pro-efficiency motivation, it leads <b>to</b> <b>retaining</b> food products <b>subsidies</b> and hinders desirable changes in the area structure of farms. Without denying the unquestionable merits of the hard-to-get money policy, one must emphasize that such a policy may not be implemented selectively, i. e. only in some sectors of production. It should be carried out consistently in the whole economy. Selective implementation of the hard-to-get money policy in agriculture may result in the farmers' undertaking protective measures, with the possible effect of decreased material outlays on production and, in consequence, a decreased level of production. The practice shows that fovourable tendencies in agricultural production are generated only by stabile and consistent agricultural policy combining skillfully material profits for farmers with the aims of the whole economyDigitalizacja i deponowanie archiwalnych zeszytów RPEiS sfinansowane przez MNiSW w ramach realizacji umowy nr 541 /P-DUN/ 201...|$|R
