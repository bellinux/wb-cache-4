5|$|<b>Tequila</b> {{finds the}} last {{baby in the}} {{maternity}} unit, and carries it to safety while fighting off {{the last of the}} gangsters. Alan and <b>Tequila</b> meet up again and are confronted by Wong, who has set bombs to blow up the building. Alan pursues Wong as <b>Tequila</b> escapes the hospital with the last baby, the hospital exploding around him. Outside, Wong suddenly appears holding Alan at gunpoint. After watching Wong humiliate <b>Tequila,</b> Alan grabs Wong's pistol. In a struggle, Alan shoots himself through the stomach giving <b>Tequila</b> enough time to shoot Wong dead. Later at the police station, Pang and <b>Tequila</b> burn Alan's police file. Alan then sails away from Hong Kong in his boat.|$|E
5|$|At {{the police}} station, Pang {{confirms}} that Alan {{is actually an}} undercover cop. <b>Tequila</b> tracks Alan down to his sailboat {{to try to make}} sense of the situation, but the two are ambushed by the remnants of Hoi's gang. <b>Tequila</b> and Alan manage to kill their attackers just before Wong arrives, which allows Alan to keep his cover. Wong realizes that one of his gangsters named Foxy (Tung Wei), is an informant for the police. Foxy is beaten at the docks by Wong's henchman Mad Dog (Philip Kwok) in front of Alan and Wong. Alan then shoots Foxy in the chest, although he secretly placed a cigarette lighter in Foxy's breast pocket earlier to prevent the shot from being fatal. Foxy finds <b>Tequila</b> at a jazz bar and informs him that Wong's armory is in the nearby Maple Group Hospital. As <b>Tequila</b> takes Foxy to the hospital, Wong finds out that Foxy is alive and sends Alan to kill Foxy, as well as sending Mad Dog separately to cover Alan. At the hospital, Alan confronts <b>Tequila,</b> demanding to know the whereabouts of Wong's arsenal. While Alan and <b>Tequila</b> are distracted, Foxy is killed by Mad Dog.|$|E
5|$|Alan and <b>Tequila</b> {{discover}} a hidden {{passage in the}} hospital leading to Wong's arsenal. They are confronted by Mad Dog, who engages them. Wong arrives {{at the hospital and}} has all the patients, police officers and staff taken hostage. After fighting their way to the main lobby, Alan and <b>Tequila</b> liberate the kidnapped patients and police officers. Pang evacuates the lobby while police detective Teresa Chang (Teresa Mo) goes to the maternity ward to organize evacuating the babies. Alan and <b>Tequila</b> continue fighting gangsters until they find Mad Dog. While <b>Tequila</b> goes to assist Chang with the babies, Alan and Mad Dog find themselves in a standoff with a group of patients caught in the middle. They slowly put their guns down and offer the patients safe passage, until Wong appears and shoots them all. An enraged Mad Dog shoots Wong's gun out of his hand. Wong shoots and kills Mad Dog while Alan escapes.|$|E

5|$|In 2007, Midway Games {{released}} the game Stranglehold. The game's story and storyboards {{were made in}} collaboration with John Woo.

John Woo's production company Lion Rock Entertainment is developing a film version of the game which will be written by Jeremy Passmore and Andre Fabrizio.|$|E

5|$|The script of {{the film}} went through several changes during filming. Due to the length {{of the film}}, scenes from a side-story {{involving}} the relationship between the character <b>Tequila</b> and Teresa Chang were cut. Another cut scene included <b>Tequila</b> playing clarinet over Benny's grave. With these cuts, Chow Yun-Fat felt his character was not very deep in comparison to Leung's character of Alan. To develop his character more, Chow asked John Woo to insert a mentor character in the film, which Woo himself would play. Chow felt that having Woo in this role would make Woo not cut out these scenes. Philip Kwok's role of Mad Dog was not in the script and was created on the set. Kwok first worked with Woo on his film Once a Thief and was asked to return to work on Hard Boiled. After reading the script, Woo felt that the character of Johnny Wong was not a strong enough physical threat. After seeing Kwok do several of the stunts while filming, Woo created the character of Mad Dog for him.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, {{sales of}} spirits {{increased}} 9% {{over the previous}} year. Whiskey and vodka were the top sellers, while <b>tequila</b> had the largest percentage increase. Oregonian's top buy was Jack Daniel's, with 412,000 bottles sold. This was during a national spirits trend where manufacturers introduced new products and advertising aimed at young drinkers. Again in 2007, Oregon's 2.6 million adults on average drank 32 gallons of beer each, versus 4 gallons of wine and 2 gallons of spirits, but sales of beer hadn't increased like sales of spirits. The Oregon Department of Human Services reported that while drinking among 8th11th graders has fallen nationally, it has increased in Oregon. The number of DUI offenses dropped between 2002 and 2005, from 25,342 to 23,455.|$|E
5|$|On {{the day of}} the tournament, Coach Lumbly {{tells the}} debate team that Ginny has {{transferred}} to Townsend Prep for the remainder of her senior year and that Hal will be paired with Heston for the day. Struggling with his speech and his stutter, Hal calls his therapist, who suggests that he sing his speech or talk with a foreign accent. Hal and Heston finish the day without much success, while Ginny wins a trophy for First Place as an Individual Speaker, which inexplicably goes missing. Coach Lumbly asks Hal to leave the team, telling him that Ginny had never planned to debate as his partner and had only recruited him as a cruel joke to damage the school's chances of winning. He breaks into Earl's bedroom and takes a bottle of stolen <b>tequila,</b> then rides with Heston to his friend Lewis's house, who lives across the street from Ginny. A drunken Hal drags Lewis's mother's cello across the street and throws it through Ginny's window just as she is arriving home with her new teammate, Ram.|$|E

50|$|Many of the higher-quality, 100% agave <b>tequilas</b> do not impart {{significant}} alcohol burn, {{and drinking}} them {{with salt and}} lime is likely to remove much of the flavor.

Doing so allows the taster to detect subtler fragrances and flavors {{that would otherwise be}} missed.|$|R

5|$|Cavallo began {{a second}} wave of privatizations with the Correo Argentino and the nuclear power plants. He also limited {{the amount of money}} {{released}} to the provinces. He still had the full support of Menem, despite growing opposition within the PJ. The Mexican <b>Tequila</b> Crisis impacted the national economy, causing a deficit, recession, and a growth in unemployment. The government further reduced public expenditures, the wages of state workers, and raised taxes. The deficit and recession were reduced, but unemployment stayed high. External debt increased. The crisis also proved that the economic system was vulnerable to capital flight. The growing discontent over unemployment and the scandals caused by the privatization of the Correo led to Cavallo's removal as minister, and his replacement by Roque Fernández. Fernández maintained Cavallo's fiscal austerity. He increased the price of fuels, sold the state shares of YPF to Repsol, fired state employees, and increased the value-added tax to 21%. He also undertook more privatization. A new labor law was met with resistance, both by Peronists, opposition parties, and unions, and could not be approved by Congress. The 1997 Asian financial crisis and the 1998 Russian financial crisis also affected the country with consequences that lasted longer than the Tequilla Crisis and started a depression.|$|E
