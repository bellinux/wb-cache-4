5|$|In an {{interview}} by Scholastic with Rick Riordan for The Lost Hero, Riordan was questioned about {{the whereabouts of}} Percy Jackson. The author hinted that <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> revealed as Jason's quest progressed. By {{the end of the}} book, he said that readers would have a good idea where the second book is going. On May 26, 2011, Riordan released both the cover art and the first chapter for The Son of Neptune confirming that Percy would {{play a role in the}} book.|$|E
25|$|It is {{uncertain}} whether Kiya ever used the rich funerary equipment that was prepared against her death. If her disappearance resulted from disgrace or exile, <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> no. On the other hand, if {{she died in}} good standing with Akhenaten, she probably would have received a lavish burial appropriate to her station. In the latter case, a likely site for her interment would be the Amarna Royal Tomb, which includes a suite of three chambers evidently used to house female members of Akhenaten's family. At least two and possibly {{as many as three}} different individuals were interred in this suite, including Akhenaten's daughter Meketaten, the only one whose name survives. Two of the chambers originally included painted plaster reliefs depicting Akhenaten, Nefertiti, certain of their daughters, and other mourners lamenting the deceased. Some Egyptologists have suggested that one of these scenes of mourning refers to Kiya, although no specific evidence supports this claim.|$|E
500|$|The {{development}} team depicted {{reality in}} the world of Never 7 as subjective and relative rather than absolute. As such, for each route, that route's history is the only one Makoto knows and the only one that is real to him; the Curé syndrome only exists to him in the routes where it is mentioned. The bells were used as symbols for reality being relative, and were described by the development team as [...] "vague existences", saying that one cannot know if they exist or not. In the bad ending to Izumi's route, the bells, which [...] "should be fictional" [...] remain while something that should exist disappears; this was a metaphor for the idea that delusions become reality while reality becomes a delusion. The game's title comes from how Makoto is unable to escape the infinite loop and reach April 7, and how most of the seven characters die {{at some point during the}} game. It is also based on the belief that 7 is a lucky number. The game was designed to be open to speculation and multiple interpretations, a design philosophy that was carried over to later entries in the series and was part of what led to Infinity being chosen as the series title. One example of the openness to interpretation was that development team did not want to confirm or deny whether the game's world was connected to that of the Memories Off series, saying that while characters with similar names may appear, they wanted to leave the player to decide for themselves what <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>would</b> <b>be.</b>|$|E
50|$|The author follows {{with a note}} to the reader, {{warning that}} in the {{subsequent}} pages <b>the</b> <b>answers</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> revealed, and that the reader has the needed information and a valuable hint as to <b>the</b> <b>answer.</b>|$|R

25|$|Oracle bone {{inscriptions}} are {{records of}} divinations performed {{in communication with}} royal ancestral spirits. The shortest {{are only a few}} characters long, while the longest are thirty to forty characters in length. The Shang king would communicate with his ancestors on topics relating to the royal family, military success, weather forecasting, ritual sacrifices, and related topics by means of scapulimancy, and <b>the</b> <b>answers</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> recorded on <b>the</b> divination material itself.|$|R
2500|$|If, on {{the other}} hand, we wish to answer an interventional question: [...] "What is the {{probability}} that it would rain, given that we wet the grass?"

As expected, the probability of rain is unaffected by the action: [...]|$|E
2500|$|Michael Thomson, {{writing for}} the BBC, lauded the film and the passion of {{director}} Marco Bechis, and wrote, [...] "It is director Marco Bechis' softly-softly approach which fills each frame with real power and leaves you in no doubt as to his commitment and passion. It is indeed no surprise to learn that this Italian-Chilean was himself snatched by the military in Buenos Aires and tortured. Yet, despite his admirable insistence on moving us with the truth (helped by his grainy camera work), Bechis can also tell a tale and he gradually incorporates a race-against-time element. Will Maria escape, especially when she is taken {{out on the town}} by her captor? Let's just say that <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> alien to Hollywood." ...|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "recruit to dilute" [...] fraud {{allegations}} were heard {{in court in}} 2000 in the case Sir William Jaffray & Ors v. The Society of Lloyd's and the appeal was heard in 2002. On each occasion the allegation {{that there had been}} a policy of [...] "recruit to dilute" [...] was rejected; however, at first instance the judge described the Names as [...] "the innocent victims [...] of staggering incompetence" [...] and at appeal the court found that representations that Lloyd's had a rigorous auditing system were false ( [...] the answer to the question [...] whether there was in existence a rigorous system of auditing which involved the making of a reasonable estimate of outstanding liabilities, including unknown and unnoted losses, is no. Moreover, <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> no even if the word 'rigorous' were removed) and strongly hinted that one of Lloyd's main witnesses, Murray Lawrence, a previous chairman, had lied in his testimony ( [...] We have serious reservations about the veracity of Mr. Lawrence's evidence [...]).|$|E
30|$|Bottom line, the INSPIRE Coverage Core can be {{mapped to}} CIS, {{actually}} to all versions: In CIS 1.0, the corresponding type is RectifiedGridCoverage, in CIS 1.1 type GeneralGridCoverage <b>would</b> <b>be</b> used with all-regular axes. We do not investigate further how this INSPIRE extension can be harmonized with CIS 1.1 because the multiple extents {{as well as}} nesting in INSPIRE leave open some design questions where <b>the</b> <b>answers</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> required for a rigorous mapping.|$|R
5000|$|At SkyView Atlanta, {{one team}} member <b>would</b> <b>be</b> {{harnessed}} to a net {{connected to the}} Ferris Wheel's support beams. When the wheel was in motion, teams needed to grab four ribbons with math equations surrounding the net's frame. The equations and/or <b>the</b> <b>answers</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> relayed to their teammate {{who was in the}} next capsule on the Ferris Wheel. Two of <b>the</b> <b>answers</b> to those math equations were the codes needed to unlock a briefcase containing their next clue.|$|R

5000|$|Is {{this set}} of axioms [...] "adequate"? <b>The</b> proper <b>answer</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a question: [...] "Adequate to {{describe}} what, in particular?" [...] "The axioms determine to which systems, defined from outside the theory, the theory applies." [...] (Kleene 1952:27). In other words, the axioms may be sufficient for one system but not for another.|$|R
60|$|Apparently his master's {{reception}} of the card had impressed the powdered-headed footman in Sam's favour, for {{when he came back}} from delivering it, he smiled in a friendly manner, and said that <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> ready directly.|$|E
60|$|In {{his first}} hopefulness Masterton did not doubt what <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>would</b> <b>be,</b> but as evening {{approached}} he grew concerned {{as to the}} girl's opportunities of coming, and regretted {{that he had not}} given her a choice of time.|$|E

5000|$|Garagiola read a {{statement}} (e.g., [...] "How he shows affection"), and each contestant {{would have to}} raise his hand. The first three to raise their hands would say a one- or two-word <b>answer,</b> which Garagiola <b>would</b> ask them to explain. <b>The</b> <b>answers</b> <b>would</b> then <b>be</b> read {{one at a time}} over the phone, and the off-stage partner would have to ring in if she thought her partner had said it. If the first person to ring in was correct, the couple won 25 points. If she was wrong, the couple lost 10 points, as did the team which originally gave <b>the</b> <b>answer.</b> Each of <b>the</b> three <b>answers</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> read in random order. During the all-celebrity format, the off-stage partner would have to not only ring in for <b>the</b> correct <b>answer,</b> but also relate the same explanation or story about <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> as <b>the</b> on-stage partner to get the points; otherwise they lost 10 points.|$|R
50|$|Dworkin's {{critics argue}} {{not only that}} law proper (that is, the legal sources in a positivist sense) is full of gaps and inconsistencies, but also that other legal {{standards}} (including principles) may be insufficient to solve a hard case. Some of them are incommensurable. In any of these situations, even Hercules <b>would</b> <b>be</b> in a dilemma and none of <b>the</b> possible <b>answers</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> right one.|$|R

60|$|The {{question}} was perfunctory, {{and she knew}} what <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>would</b> <b>be.</b> Then she lost herself in drowsy contemplation of the soothing balm of his strength: Life poured from the ends of his fingers, driving the pain before it, {{or so it seemed}} to her, until with the easement of pain, she fell asleep and he stole away.|$|E

40|$|If {{one asked}} some friends where {{on the horizon}} they should {{expect to see the}} sunrise, half of <b>the</b> <b>answers</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> "in <b>the</b> east". Of course, {{something}} analogous would happen with the sunset and the west. However, sunrise and sunset virtually never occur at these cardinal points. In fact, those answers correctly describe observations only during the equinoxes, when either autumn or spring begin. Once we recall this, the next natural question to ask ourselves is: how far from the east (or from the west) the rising (or setting) Sun is located for a given latitude of the observer and for a given day of the year. In this paper we supply some simple tools to easily visualize the angular (southward or northward) departure of the rising and setting Sun on the horizon from the east-west direction in a pictorial way, without the need of mathematics. These tools have proven a valuable resource in teaching introductory physics and astronomy courses. Comment: Published version available at [URL]...|$|R
