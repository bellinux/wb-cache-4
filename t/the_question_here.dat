2500|$|The Daily Times, blamed Al Qaeda and Lashkar-e Jhangvi in an editorial, stating, [...] "International cricket is {{no longer}} {{possible}} in Pakistan; therefore we should stop accusing foreign teams of discriminating against Pakistan vis-à-vis India. <b>The</b> <b>question</b> <b>here</b> is of the survival of Pakistan, not of cricket." [...] The Daily Jang, responding on Chris Broad, Simon Taufel and Steve Davis's comments, said that their [...] "vivid description of the terrifying attack gives us an insight into how people everywhere will see the events of the morning of March 3." [...] It went on to say the [...] "men appeared genuinely shocked over the sight of Pakistani security men running for cover". The paper {{goes on to say that}} [...] "their candid comments will seal the fate of Pakistan cricket for some time to come". It also said that Pakistan [...] "must give up complaining" [...] and that [...] "ways to liven up the game at the domestic level need to be reconsidered with renewed urgency".|$|E
2500|$|There are two {{separate}} questions to consider. First, is the divergence {{a real one}} such that the zero-point energy really is infinite? If we consider the volume [...] is contained by perfectly conducting walls, very high frequencies can only be contained by taking more and more perfect conduction. No actual method of containing the high frequencies is possible. Such modes will not be stationary in our box and thus not countable in the stationary energy content. So from this physical point of view the above sum should only extend to those frequencies which are countable; a cut-off energy is thus eminently reasonable. However, {{on the scale of}} a [...] "universe" [...] questions of general relativity must be included. Suppose even the boxes could be reproduced, fit together and closed nicely by curving spacetime. Then exact conditions for running waves may be possible. However the very high frequency quanta will still not be contained. As per John Wheeler's [...] "geons" [...] these will leak out of the system. So again a cut-off is permissible, almost necessary. <b>The</b> <b>question</b> <b>here</b> becomes one of consistency since the very high energy quanta will act as a mass source and start curving the geometry.|$|E

60|$|As long as {{the facts}} which Hegel {{accepted}} are not officially welcomed by science, it may seem superfluous to dispute {{as to whether they}} are attained by the lower or the higher stratum of our consciousness. But perhaps <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>here</b> at issue may be elucidated by some remarks of Dr. Max Dessoir. Psychology, he says, has proved that in every conception and idea an image or group of images must be present. These mental images are the recrudescence or recurrence of perceptions. We see a tree, or a man, or a dog, and whenever we have before our minds the conception or idea of any of these things the original perception of them returns, though of course more faintly. But in Dr. Dessoir's opinion these revived mental images would reach the height of actual hallucinations (so that the man, dog, or tree would seem visibly present) if other memories and new sensations did not compete with them and check their development.|$|E

60|$|Only {{standing}} idly on one {{of those}} grassy mounds under one of those broken arches, I suddenly saw the Labour problem of London, as I could not see it in London. I do not mean that I saw which side was right, or what solution was reliable, or any partisan points or repartees, or any practical details about practical difficulties. I mean that I saw what it was; the thing itself and the whole thing. The Labour problem of to-day stood up quite simply, like a peak at which a man looks back and sees single and solid, though when he was walking over it it was a wilderness of rocks. The Labour problem is the attempt to have the democracy of Paris without the slavery of Rome. Between the Roman Republic and the French Republic something had happened. Whatever else it was, it was the abandonment of the ancient and fundamental human habit of slavery; the numbering of men for necessary labour as the normal foundation of society, even a society in which citizens were free and equal. When the idea of equal citizenship returned to the world, it found that world changed by a much more mysterious version of equality. So that London, handing on the lamp from Paris as well as Rome, is faced with a new problem touching the old practice of getting the work of the world done somehow. We have now to assume not only that all citizens are equal, but that all men are citizens. Capitalism attempted it by combining political equality with economic inequality; it assumed the rich could always hire the poor. But Capitalism seems to me to have collapsed; to be not only a discredited ethic but a bankrupt business. Whether we shall return to pagan slavery, or to small property, or by guilds or otherwise get to work in a new way, is not <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>here.</b> <b>The</b> <b>question</b> <b>here</b> was the one I asked myself standing on that green mound beside the yellow river; and the answer to it lay ahead of me, along the road that ran towards the rising sun.|$|E

Apparently his ideas on the subject of discipline were no stricter than those of his men, for he made no remark as to their carelessness. Presently, when he looked in, the four soldiers were standing at the window, watching a regiment passing by on its way to take its share of the work in the trenches. Vincent, who was sitting at a table, happened to look up, and was astonished at seeing the sergeant first put his finger on his lips, then take off his cap, put one hand on his heart, and gesticulate with the other.|$|E
