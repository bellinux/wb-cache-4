5|$|After {{graduating from}} high school, Moynahan pursued a {{modeling}} career despite admitting she had never read fashion magazines growing up. She had accompanied a friend to a modeling audition in Springfield, Massachusetts, and was signed by <b>the</b> <b>modeling</b> agency instead of her friend. She began her career appearing in department-store catalogs in Springfield, during which time she attended the University of Massachusetts Amherst.|$|E
5|$|Between 1973 and 1978, {{together}} with Dutch researcher Stan Tempelaars (1938–2010), Kaegi developed the VOSIM program. VOSIM, {{which stands for}} VOice SIMulator, is a system based on the digital sound synthesis of simple, sinusoidal square waves, allowing <b>the</b> <b>modeling</b> of vowel sounds, vocal fricatives and quasi-instrumental tones. It complemented, and was used in conjunction with, Gottfried Michael Koenig's own computer-generated music programs Project 1 (1964), Project 2 (1966) and SSP (1971). Werner Kaegi summed up the VOSIM system in 1986 in a presentation for the scientific journal Interface.|$|E
5|$|If the {{concentration}} of the inert gas in the breathing gas is reduced below that {{of any of the}} tissues, there is a tendency for gas to return from the tissues to the breathing gas. This is known as out-gassing, and occurs during decompression, when the reduction in ambient pressure reduces the partial pressure of the inert gas in the lungs. This process may be complicated by the formation of gas bubbles, and <b>the</b> <b>modeling</b> is more complex and varied.|$|E

50|$|The next Cub Cadet {{models that}} International {{introduced}} were <b>the</b> <b>models</b> 72, 104, 124, 105, and 125. <b>The</b> <b>model</b> 72 {{was a direct}} replacement for <b>the</b> <b>model</b> 71 which used the seven-horsepower Kohler engine, three-speed direct drive transmission, and pan seat. <b>The</b> <b>model</b> 104 replaced <b>the</b> <b>model</b> 102 using <b>the</b> ten-horsepower Kohler engine and three-speed transmission. <b>The</b> <b>model</b> 124 replaced <b>the</b> <b>model</b> 122 using <b>the</b> twelve horsepower Kohler engine and three-speed direct drive transmission. <b>The</b> <b>model</b> 125 replaced <b>the</b> <b>model</b> 123 using <b>the</b> twelve-horsepower Kohler engine and a hydrostatic transmission. <b>The</b> <b>model</b> 105 was <b>the</b> first Cub Cadet to offer a ten-horsepower Kohler motor with a hydrostatic transmission. These Cub Cadet <b>models</b> retained <b>the</b> same square fenders as <b>the</b> previous <b>models.</b> <b>The</b> biggest difference in these Cub Cadets was their fiberglass dash which contained an ammeter. The production of the 72, 104, 124, 105, and 125 ran from 1967 to 1969.|$|R

5000|$|The {{video display}} in <b>the</b> <b>Model</b> II {{is similar to}} <b>the</b> <b>Model</b> I. A 12" [...] RCA B&W {{television}} CRT is used. However, <b>the</b> <b>Model</b> II's video circuitry was significantly improved {{in the interest of}} better picture quality, as one of the criticisms of <b>the</b> <b>Model</b> I was that the included monitor was merely an RCA television set with the RF, IF, and sound stripped out. <b>The</b> <b>Model</b> II, in contrast, used a dedicated monochrome composite monitor with higher-quality and better-adjusted components than the modified TV set provided with <b>the</b> <b>Model</b> I. <b>The</b> text display on <b>the</b> <b>Model</b> II was 80x24 rather than <b>the</b> <b>Model</b> I/III's 64x16 text and also added lowercase letters, one major feature that <b>the</b> <b>Model</b> I was lacking. In addition, it could be operated in 40x24 text mode. The character set in <b>the</b> <b>Model</b> II was somewhat different from <b>the</b> <b>Model</b> I/III. It de-emphasized graphics characters and replaced them with additional currency and mathematical symbols.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Model</b> 1770 had a {{modified}} lock plate, stronger barrel bands, and {{a modified}} ramrod retaining spring. <b>The</b> <b>Model</b> 1771 moved <b>the</b> bayonet lug and strengthened <b>the</b> barrel. <b>The</b> <b>Model</b> 1770 and 1771 are often grouped {{together as a}} single <b>model.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Model</b> 1773 was similar to previous models, but again modified the ramrod retaining spring. <b>The</b> <b>Model</b> 1773 is often {{considered to be a}} minor variant to <b>the</b> <b>Model</b> 1770/1771. <b>The</b> <b>Model</b> 1774 had a shorter trigger guard, and the tail of the frizzen was cut square. The ramrod design was also modified in <b>the</b> <b>Model</b> 1774, giving it more of a pear shaped head.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Model</b> 42 {{came out}} in 1952 as the Airweight Centennial but was changed in 1957 to <b>the</b> <b>Model</b> 42. <b>The</b> gun was the same design as <b>the</b> <b>Model</b> 40 except <b>the</b> frame was made of an {{aluminum}} alloy, resulting in a lower weight than <b>the</b> <b>Model</b> 40. <b>The</b> <b>Model</b> 42 was discontinued in 1974.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Model</b> 70, {{introduced}} in 2013, is a shortened variant of <b>the</b> <b>Model</b> 75 - alternatively {{described as an}} upgraded <b>Model</b> 40XR, with <b>the</b> same modifications as used to convert <b>the</b> <b>Model</b> 45XR into <b>the</b> <b>Model</b> 75.

25|$|When <b>the</b> <b>modeling</b> {{phase is}} complete, {{selected}} systems are validated using a professional third party to provide oversight {{and to determine}} how closely the model is able to predict the reality of system performance. System validation uses non-pathogenic surrogates such as MS 2 phage or Bacillus subtilis to determine the Reduction Equivalent Dose (RED) ability of the reactors. Most systems are validated to deliver 40mJ/cm2 within an envelope of flow and transmittance.|$|E
25|$|The asset flow {{equations}} {{stipulate that}} price trend {{is a factor}} in the supply and demand for an asset that is a key ingredient in the formation of a bubble. While many studies of market data have shown a rather minimal trend effect, the work of Caginalp and DeSantis on large scale data adjusts for changes in valuation, thereby illuminating a strong role for trend, and providing the empirical justification for <b>the</b> <b>modeling.</b>|$|E
25|$|It can be {{seen from}} <b>the</b> <b>modeling</b> above, the main {{assumption}} of the twin study is that of equal environments, also known as the equal environments assumption. This assumption has been directly tested. A special case occurs where parents believe their twins to be non-identical when in fact they are genetically identical. Studies of a range of psychological traits indicate that these children remain as concordant as MZ twins raised by parents who treated them as identical.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Model</b> 85 {{line has}} been {{enlarged}} to include <b>the</b> <b>Model</b> 856. This model is similar to <b>the</b> <b>Model</b> 85, but adds an additional round in the cylinder to bring <b>the</b> <b>Model</b> 856's capacity to 6 rounds.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Model</b> 1840 {{was a minor}} {{improvement}} over <b>the</b> Springfield <b>Model</b> 1835 musket, and therefore was not dramatically different from <b>the</b> older <b>Model</b> 1835. <b>The</b> <b>Model</b> 1840 featured a longer bayonet with a clasp and a stock with a comb. The designers of <b>the</b> <b>Model</b> 1840 anticipated that the musket would eventually be rifled, and made the barrel heavier than <b>the</b> earlier <b>Model</b> 1835 accordingly. <b>The</b> various modifications to <b>the</b> <b>Model</b> 1840 made it slightly heavier than <b>the</b> <b>Model</b> 1835.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Model</b> 1869 Cadet Rifle was a {{shortened}} {{version of}} <b>the</b> Springfield <b>Model</b> 1868.
