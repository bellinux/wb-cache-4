The empirical work comprised in-depth interviews with employees and employers in the academic sector, a sector that has a tradition of employing people on temporary contracts. The key findings are: <b>temporary</b> <b>employment</b> <b>contracts</b> provide the organization with a low-risk mechanism for reducing uncertainty in supply; <b>temporary</b> <b>employment</b> <b>contracts</b> increase flexibility and reduce irreversibility for the organization and shift risk from the institution to the employee. However, there is a cost to the organization in the form of demotivation, holding back and early exit of desirable employees.

The changing world of work put into question its centrality and its future, causing crisis in society and in work identity of the worker. From unemployment to new paradigms of work, the progress occurs {{in the form of}} risks, contingencies that lead us to the need for selection of responses to the environment. In this trajectory, unlike the theories that propagate the end of work, are explored their new forms, resulting from their metamorphoses, analyzed through a dialogue between Italy and Brazil for a focus of flexibility, that allows us to give concreteness to the argument of the centrality work category, which has been expanding in the contemporary world. The focus centers on temporary contract of two countries. For that we go through the paths already opened by the doctrine, adding, besides the focus of law, sociological, which allows a rethink on new bases of inflection of the legal instruments in work materials.

40|$|ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE To {{evaluate}} if perceived occupational {{factors are}} associated with insufficient free-time physical activity in Brazilian public school teachers. METHODS The relationship between insufficient physical activity (< 150 minutes/week) and variables related to work was analyzed in 978 {{elementary and high school}} teachers calculating the prevalence ratio (PR) and 95 % confidence interval (95 %CI) in Poisson regression models, adjusted for sociodemographic and health variables. RESULTS The prevalence of insufficient physical activity was 71. 9 %, and this condition was associated independently with the perception of bad or regular balance between personal and professional life (PR = 1. 09; 95 %CI 1. 01 – 1. 18), perception that standing time affects the work (PR = 1. 16; 95 %CI 1. 01 – 1. 34), low or very low perception of current ability for the physical requirements of work (PR = 1. 21; 95 %CI 1. 08 – 1. 35), and <b>temporary</b> <b>employment</b> <b>contract</b> (PR = 1. 13; 95 %CI 1. 03 – 1. 25). The teaching of physical education was associated with lower prevalence of insufficient physical activity (PR = 0. 78; 95 %CI 0. 64 – 0. 95).

40|$|Human resources, {{temporary}} employment contracts and strategic use of real options The option to delay {{a decision that}} is difficult to reverse, and to wait for new information to arrive, provides an organization with some flexibility in dealing with environmental uncertainty (Pindyck, 1991). This paper examines the strategic use of {{temporary employment}} contracts as a means of dealing with uncertainty in the form of unrevealed employee ability. The paper puts forward a model of a temporary contract as a real option 1, specifically as a combination of a put option and a stock. The paper takes into account both a US and a European perspective. While temporary contracts have been discussed as real options by a number of authors (Foote and Folta, 2002) and others have examined the use of HR practices as real options (Bhattacharya and Wright, 2005) {{only a small number of}} authors, mainly labor economists, have put forward formal models of temporary employment contracts as real options (Gete and Porchia, 2011; Chou, 2011; Lotti and Viviano, 2012). Introducing a micro-level model of a <b>temporary</b> <b>employment</b> <b>contract</b> as a real option that provides additional flexibility in dealing with an uncertain environment and using it to tease out implications for academic recruitment in regard to lecturers and post-doctoral researchers, and in regard to research intensive and teaching intensive institutions, is the main contribution of this paper.

The purpose of this master thesis has a descriptive nature of research. The research approach chosen is a deductive approach and the research design chosen is a quantitative research design. Cluster sampling in combination with simple random sampling was used as sampling technique. 128 nurses were surveyed from April to May 2016. Nurses who reported to leave the organization due to retirement reasons, <b>temporary</b> <b>employment</b> <b>contract</b> or maternity leave {{were excluded from the}} study as this study investigates the voluntary turnover intention. A total of 68 nurses were included in the study which indicates an overall response rate of 53 %. Numerous of the findings in this master thesis are consistent with previous studies on turnover intention of different generations in other western-countries than Belgium. The work-related factor workload was most often reported by Belgian nurses with no intention to leave their job. Belgian nurses with an intention to leave their job indicated most often the work-related factor (non-) financial benefits. The generation-specific findings indicated both similarities and differences between the work-related factors selected. It was observed that Baby Boomers with an intention to leave their job selected most often variables related to the work-related factors (non-) financial benefits, supportive organization and workload. The variable lack of recognition appeared among Baby Boomers with an intention and no intention to leave their job. Surprisingly was the often selected variables lack of direct and/clear feedback on performances and unsupportive supervisor among Baby Boomers with professional turnover intention. Further, it was observed that Generation Xers with an intention to leave their job selected most often variables related to the work-related factors supportive organization, communication, (non-) financial benefits, work content and workload. The variables inadequate opportunity for advancement/professional growth and imbalance work-life appeared among Generation Xers with an intention and no intention to leave their job. Generation Yers with an intention to leave their job selected most frequently variables related to the work-related factors (non-) financial benefits, workload and commitment.

The second section summarises and analyses the provisions of the Labour Relations Amendment Bill and the Basic Conditions of Employment Bill as they apply to fixed-term employees. Temporary employees are protected by the general protection extended to all employees in terms of section 23 (1) of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996, guaranteeing all employees the “right to fair labour practice”. The Labour Relations Act has as one of its main objectives to give effect to and regulate the fundamental rights contained in the Constitution. Thus the Labour Relations Act must not only give effect to constitutional rights but it must also ensure that it in no way unreasonably or unjustly denies or limits constitutional rights. Temporary employees have a number of labour laws protecting their interests. Where the provisions of the Basic Conditions of Employment Act, a Bargaining Council Agreement or a Sectoral Determination do not apply the employee will rely on the terms of the fixed-term employment contract and thereafter the common law for protection. The only protection offered to temporary employees contained in the Labour Relations Act is in section 186 (1) (b), where a dismissal is defined to include the non-renewal of temporary contracts of employment where there is a reasonable expectation of renewal on the same or similar terms. This provision has proved to be highly controversial in that it does not expressly cater for temporary employees who harbour reasonable expectations of indefinite employment. An analysis is made of the most important cases relating to section 186 (1) (b). The second section unpacks and critically analyses the Labour Relations Amendment Bill and the Basic Conditions of Employment Bill which have been long in the offing and when they are finally enacted, will bring with them sweeping changes for atypical employment. The amendments will drastically change the way employers make use of fixed-term employees as well as the way in which Temporary Employment Services may conduct business if they are in fact able to keep working at all. There is very little literature of substance written about the Labour Relations Amendment Bill as it applies to atypical employment. The fact that the proposed amendments have changed so many times over such {{a long period of time}} might have deterred many writers from investing time and effort in attempts to analyse and summarise the amendments.

This article argues that the function of <b>temporary</b> <b>employment</b> varies with the degree of task complexity and affects the probability of receiving tenure or transition-ing to unemployment. Analysing retrospective survey data for Germany (ALWA) using Fine and Gray models for competing risks, I show that a bridge into permanent employment most likely arises for medium-skill work. By contrast, the risk of a transition to unemployment is generally equal, but in-creases for employees performing low- and medium-skill tasks if local labour demand falls. Only high-skill jobs seem to be unaffected by the employment environment. The results indicate that de-bates concerning the function and consequences of temporary work must consider occupational characteristics. The selective distribution of transition probabilities and unemployment risks gener-ates inequalities and increases the risk of labour market segmentation as employment polarization shifts employees towards low- and high-skill tasks...|$|R
