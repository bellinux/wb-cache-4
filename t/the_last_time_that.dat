5|$|Deligiannis mobilized the Hellenic Army, and the British Royal Navy {{blockaded}} Greece. The admiral {{in charge}} of the blockade was Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, who had been the first choice of the Greeks to be their king in 1863, and the First Lord of the Admiralty at the time was Lord Ripon, whose brother-in-law had been murdered in Greece 16 years before. This was not <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> King George discovered that his family ties were not always to his advantage. Deligiannis was forced to demobilize and Trikoupis regained the premiership. Between 1882 and 1897, Trikoupis and Deligiannis alternated the premiership as their fortunes rose and fell.|$|E

At Tatoi, Constantine again impressed upon Alexander that he held the crown in trust only. It was <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> Alexander would be {{in direct contact with}} his family. The next day, Constantine, Sophia and all of their children except Alexander arrived at the small port of Oropos and set off into exile.|$|E

Thereafter, he helped to establish the Indian Institute at Oxford, received a knighthood, and held the chair until his death in 1899. Müller, although deeply disappointed by his defeat, remained in Oxford for the rest of his career, but never taught Sanskrit there.

5|$|The Naval Academy {{would not}} produce another {{football}} team until the 1882 season. The 1882 {{team would be}} the first with a coach, being supported by Academy officials.

Navy would finish the 1880s with four winning seasons, and an overall record of 14–12–2, with one of those ties being the game against the Baltimore Athletic Club. Navy would outscore their opponents 292–231, and would finish the 19th century with an overall record of 54–19–3. The lack of a coach for the 1879 season was one of the two times the Naval Academy squad lacked one, the other time being from 1883 through 1891.|$|E
5|$|The {{release of}} Revolver marked <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> Capitol issued an altered UK Beatles album for the North American market. When the Beatles re-signed with EMI in January 1967, their {{contract}} stipulated that Capitol {{could no longer}} alter the track listings of their albums. The April 1987 CD release of Revolver standardised the track listing to the original UK version. In January 2014, the Capitol version of Revolver was issued on CD for the first time, both {{as part of the}} Beatles' U.S. Albums box set and as an individual release. As of that year, Revolver had been certified 5x Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. In 2013, after the British Phonographic Industry altered its sales award protocol, the album was certified Platinum based on UK sales since 1994.|$|E
5|$|In 836, Ceolnoth presided, with Wiglaf of Mercia, over {{a council}} held at Croft {{attended}} by the clergy {{of the southern}} part of Britain. This was <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> the archbishop worked in concert with a Mercian king as, after this, he was an attendee at the Wessex royal court instead of the Mercian. In 838 a council was held at Kingston upon Thames where Ceolnoth made an alliance with the West Saxon kings Egbert and Æthelwulf. This agreement gave control of all of the free minsters under Canterbury's authority to the king in return for protection from Viking raids. Ceolnoth also ceded the right to influence the election of abbots within Kent to the king. In return, Egbert received the support of Ceolnoth for the succession of Egbert's son Æthelwulf as king. When Egbert died shortly after this, Æthelwulf succeeded his father and became the first son to follow his father as king of Wessex in almost two centuries. Ceolnoth also recovered control of some lands that had been lost by Canterbury. The end result of this agreement was that the Wessex kings became the secular protectors of the churches and monasteries of the archdiocese of Canterbury.|$|E
50|$|In June 1607 at {{the nearby}} village of Newton, the Newton Rebellion broke out, causing a brief {{uprising}} known as the Midland Revolt, which involved several nearby villages. Protesting at land enclosures at Newton and Pytchley by local landlords the Treshams, on 8 June a pitched battle took place between Levellers - many from Kettering, Corby and particularly Weldon, - and local gentry and their servants (local militias having refused the call to arms). Approximately 40-50 local men {{are said to have}} been killed and the ringleaders hanged, drawn and quartered.
