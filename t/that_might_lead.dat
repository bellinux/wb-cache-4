5|$|Media {{attention}} {{centred on}} sabotage, while other speculation ranged from clear-air turbulence to {{an explosion of}} vapour in an empty fuel tank. The Abell Committee focused on six potential aerodynamic and mechanical causes: control flutter (which had led {{to the loss of}} DH 108 prototypes), structural failure due to high loads or metal fatigue of the wing structure, failure of the powered flight controls, failure of the window panels leading to explosive decompression, or fire and other engine problems. The committee concluded that fire was the most likely cause of the problem, and a number of changes were made to the aircraft to protect the engines and wings from damage <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>lead</b> to another fire.|$|E

25|$|The major ligament, the {{temporomandibular}} ligament, {{is actually}} the thickened lateral portion of the capsule, and it has two parts: an outer oblique portion (OOP) and an inner horizontal portion (IHP). The base of this triangular ligament {{is attached to the}} zygomatic process of the temporal bone and the articular tubercle; its apex is fixed to the lateral side of the neck of the mandible. This ligament prevents the excessive retraction or moving backward of the mandible, a situation <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>lead</b> to problems with the joint.|$|E
25|$|Grant {{knew that}} Washington {{remained}} vulnerable if Early {{was still on}} the loose. He found a new commander aggressive enough to defeat Early: Maj. Gen. Philip Sheridan, the cavalry commander of the Army of the Potomac, who was given command of all forces in the area, the Middle Military Division, including the Army of the Shenandoah. Sheridan initially started slowly, primarily because the impending presidential election of 1864 demanded a cautious approach, avoiding any disaster <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>lead</b> to the defeat of Abraham Lincoln.|$|E
25|$|In Montgomery v. Louisiana (2016), the United States Supreme Court {{ruled that}} such a {{mandatory}} sentence for a crime committed as a juvenile was unconstitutional, even for a person who committed murder, as it did not allow for what is scientifically known about juvenile brains, nor for mitigating factors, and cut off the possibility of reform <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>lead</b> to freedom. It directed state courts to review sentences for all persons covered under this ruling, an estimated 1200 to 1800 nationwide. Draper and Adamcik are among the inmates whose sentences will be reviewed by state courts under this ruling.|$|E

25|$|That the {{government}} still displays such heightened sensitivities around the Cultural Revolution is an indicator {{that it still}} considers itself, at least in part, an inheritor of its legacy. The government is apprehensive that academic probing and popular discussions will lead to ideological conflict and increase social instability. It may threaten the foundations of Communist rule. The focus of the Chinese government on maintaining political and social stability has been a top priority since the Tiananmen crackdown on reformers on June 4, 1989, and the current government {{has no interest in}} re-evaluating any issue <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>lead</b> to a split in the Chinese leadership, or which might polarize the Party on ideological grounds.|$|E
25|$|In March 1941, Japan's Foreign Minister Y≈çsuke Matsuoka, a Germanophile, visited Berlin. On 29 March 1941, {{during a}} {{conversation}} with Matsuoka, Ribbentrop, as instructed by Hitler, told the Japanese nothing about the upcoming Operation Barbarossa, as Hitler believed that he could defeat the Soviet Union {{on his own and}} preferred that the Japanese attack Britain instead. Hitler did not wish for any information <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>lead</b> the Japanese into attacking the Soviet Union to reach their ears. Ribbentrop tried to convince Matsuoka to urge the government in Tokyo to attack the great British naval base at Singapore, claiming the Royal Navy was too weak to retaliate due to its involvement in the Battle of the Atlantic. Matsuoka responded that preparations to occupy Singapore were under way.|$|E
25|$|Scrooge never {{completed}} a formal education, {{as he left}} school at an early age. However, he has a sharp mind and is always ready to learn new skills. Because of his secondary occupation as a treasure hunter, Scrooge {{has become something of}} a scholar and an amateur archaeologist. Starting with Barks, several writers have explained how Scrooge becomes aware of the treasures he decides to pursue. This often involves periods of research consulting various written sources in search of passages <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>lead</b> him to a treasure. Often Scrooge decides to search for the possible truth behind old legends, or discovers obscure references to the activities of ancient conquerors, explorers and military leaders that he considers interesting enough to begin a new expedition.|$|E

25|$|The Concert of Europe {{established}} in 1814 was shaken in 1859 when France and Austria fought over Italy. It came apart completely {{as a result}} of the wars of German Unification, when the Kingdom of Prussia, led by Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, defeated Austria in 1866 and France in 1870, replacing Austria-Hungary as the dominant power in Central Europe. Britain, worn out by its participation in the Crimean War and diverted by the Irish question and the social problems created by the Industrial Revolution, chose not to intervene again to restore the European balance. Bismarck did not wish the breakup of the Ottoman Empire to create rivalries <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>lead</b> to war, so he took up the Tsar's earlier suggestion that arrangements be made in case the Ottoman Empire fell apart, creating the Three Emperors' League with Austria and Russia to keep France isolated on the continent.|$|E
25|$|Frustrated {{by working}} {{conditions}} which they felt were unsafe and unjust, colliers increasingly turned to unionism. Nationwide, organized mines boasted 40 percent fewer fatalities than nonunion mines. Colorado miners had repeatedly attempted to unionize since the state's first strike in 1883. The Western Federation of Miners organized primarily hard rock miners {{in the gold}} and silver camps during the 1890s. Beginning in 1900, the United Mine Workers of America began organizing coal miners in the western states, including southern Colorado. The union decided {{to focus on the}} Colorado Fuel & Iron Company because of its harsh management tactics under the conservative and distant Rockefellers and other investors. To break or prevent strikes, the coal companies hired strike breakers, mainly from Mexico and southern and eastern Europe. The Colorado Fuel & Iron Company's management mixed immigrants of different nationalities in the mines, a practice which discouraged communication <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>lead</b> to organization.|$|E

In all, 923 passengers boarded Titanic at Southampton, 179 First Class, 247 Second Class and 494 Third Class. The large number of Third Class passengers meant {{they were the first}} to board, with First and Second Class passengers following up to an hour before departure. Stewards showed them to their cabins, and First Class passengers were personally greeted by Captain Smith on boarding. Third Class passengers were inspected for ailments and physical impairments <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>lead</b> to their being refused entry to the United States ‚Äì a prospect the White Star Line wished to avoid, as it would have to carry anyone who failed the examination back across the Atlantic. 922 passengers were recorded as having embarked Titanic at Southampton.

25|$|In {{biological}} systems phenotype {{can be said}} to supervene on genotype. This is because any genotype encodes a finite set of unique phenotypes, but any given phenotype is not produced by a finite set of genotypes. Innumerable examples of convergent evolution can be used to support this claim. Throughout nature, convergent evolution produces incredibly similar phenotypes from a diverse set of taxa with fundamentally different genotypes underpinning the phenotypes. One example is evolution on islands which is a remarkably predictable example of convergent evolution where the same phenotypes consistently evolve for the same reasons. Organisms released from predation tend to become larger, while organisms limited by food tend to become smaller. Yet there are almost infinite numbers of genetic changes <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>lead</b> to changes in body size. Another example of convergent evolution is the loss of sight that almost universally occurs in cave fish living in lightless pools. Eyes are expensive, and in lightless cave pools there is little reason for fish to have eyes. Yet, despite the remarkably consistent convergent evolution producing sightless cave fish, the genetics that produce the loss of type phenotype is different nearly every time. This is because phenotype supervenes on genotype.|$|E
25|$|Autologous {{cells are}} {{obtained}} from the same individual to which they will be reimplanted. Autologous cells have the fewest problems with rejection and pathogen transmission, however in some cases might not be available. For example, in genetic disease suitable autologous cells are not available. Also very ill or elderly persons, as well as patients suffering from severe burns, may not have sufficient quantities of autologous cells to establish useful cell lines. Moreover, since this category of cells needs to be harvested from the patient, {{there are also some}} concerns related to the necessity of performing such surgical operations <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>lead</b> to donor site infection or chronic pain. Autologous cells also must be cultured from samples before they can be used: this takes time, so autologous solutions may not be very quick. Recently there has been a trend towards the use of mesenchymal stem cells from bone marrow and fat. These cells can differentiate into a variety of tissue types, including bone, cartilage, fat, and nerve. A large number of cells can be easily and quickly isolated from fat, thus opening the potential for large numbers of cells to be quickly and easily obtained.|$|E

500|$|Although {{they succeeded}} in {{repelling}} the Austro-Hungarian attack, the Serbs used {{up much of}} their ammunition during the battle, needing 6.5 million cartridges and 35,000 shells to prevail.

In contrast, Austro-Hungarian commander Oskar Potiorek was humiliated in defeat and determined to launch a second invasion of Serbia. In September, he was given permission to launch such an invasion provided that he [...] "not risk anything <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>lead</b> to a further fiasco." [...] Defeat at Cer Mountain also affected the morale of the Austro-Hungarian troops. The first aerial dogfight of the war occurred during the battle, when Serbian aviator Miodrag Tomiƒá encountered an Austro-Hungarian plane while performing a reconnaissance mission over enemy positions. The Austro-Hungarian pilot fired at Tomiƒá with his revolver. Tomiƒá managed to escape, and, within several weeks, all Serbian and Austro-Hungarian planes were fitted with machine-guns.|$|E
