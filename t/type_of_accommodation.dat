The <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>accommodation</b> varies between the residences and the choice is among single rooms in apartments for either one, two or four people. The residences offer also services to students such as cleaning services, laundry rooms, study rooms, parking spaces. Many students, however, choose to rent private apartments which are easy to find around the university area.|$|E
25|$|Residents of {{apartment}} buildings were sealed, they were hooked by new tenants. The so-called communal apartments {{became the most}} common <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>accommodation</b> for the residents of large cities. In each communal apartment one room belonged to one family, while bathroom, toilet and kitchen were shared. Such a scheme was widespread until the mid-1950s, and in some cities there are more communal apartments. At the same time with the 1930s for senior people began to build houses with separate bedroom apartments, where one family was given the whole apartment. An {{example of such a}} house called House on the Embankment (Dom na naberezhnoi) in Moscow, built in 1927-1931, respectively.|$|E
25|$|In the US, China, UK, Ireland and Canada, a {{dormitory}} {{may be a}} room containing more than one bed. Examples are found in British boarding schools and many rooming houses such as hostels but have nowadays completely vanished as a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>accommodation</b> in university halls of residence. CADs, or cold-air dormitories, are found in multi-level rooming houses such as fraternities, sororities, and cooperative houses. In CADs and in hostels, the room typically has very few furnishings except for beds. Such rooms can contain anywhere from three to 50 beds (though such very large dormitories are rare except perhaps as military barracks). Such rooms provide little or no privacy for the residents, and very limited storage for personal items {{in or near the}} beds. Cold-air dorms get their names from the common practice of keeping the windows open year-round, even in winter. The practice emerged based on the theory that circulation and cold air minimizes the spread of disease. Some communal bedrooms keep the name cold-air dorms or cold dorms despite having modern heating or cooling.|$|E

40|$|Accommodation is {{considered}} to be important by institutions interested in mental health care both in Australia and internationally Some authorities assert that no component of a community mental health system is more important than decent affordable housing. Unfortunately there has been little research in Australia into the consequences of discharging people with a primary diagnosis of schizophrenia to different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>accommodation.</b> This paper uses archival data to investigate the outcomes for people with schizophrenia discharged to two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>accommodation.</b> The <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>accommodation</b> chosen are the persons own home and for-profit boarding house. These two were chosen because the literature suggests that they are respectively the most and least desirable <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>accommodation.</b> Results suggest that people with schizophrenia who were discharged to boarding houses are significantly more likely to be readmitted to the psychiatric unit of Gold Coast Hospital, although their length of stay in hospital is not significantly different...|$|R
