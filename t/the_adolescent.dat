5|$|During {{the pulp}} era, {{explicit}} sexuality {{of any kind}} was rare in genre science fiction and fantasy. For many years, the editors who controlled what was published {{felt that they had}} to protect <b>the</b> <b>adolescent</b> male readership that they identified as their principal market. Although the covers of some 1930s pulp magazines showed scantily clad women menaced by tentacled aliens, the covers were often more lurid than the magazines' contents. In such a context, writers like Edgar Pangborn, who featured passionate male friendships in his work, were exceptional; almost until the end of their careers, including so much as a kiss would have been too much. Implied or disguised sexuality was as important as that which was openly revealed. As such, genre SF reflected the social mores of the day, paralleling common prejudices; This was particularly true of pulp fiction, more so than literary works of the time.|$|E
5|$|Pather Panchali was {{followed}} by two films that continued the tale of Apu's life—Aparajito (The Unvanquished) in 1956 and Apur Sansar (The World of Apu) in 1959. Together, the three films constitute the Apu trilogy. Aparajito portrays <b>the</b> <b>adolescent</b> Apu, his education in a rural school and a Calcutta college. Its central theme is the poignant relationship between a doting mother and her ambitious young son. Apur Sansar depicts Apu's adult life, his reaction to his wife's premature death, and his final bonding with his son whom he abandoned as an infant. The sequels also won many national and international awards. Ray did not initially plan to make a trilogy: he {{decided to make the}} third film only after being asked {{about the possibility of a}} trilogy at the 1957 Venice Film Festival, where Aparajito won the Golden Lion. Apur Panchali (2014) is a Bengali film directed by Kaushik Ganguly, which depicts the real-life story of Subir Bannerjee, the actor who portrayed Apu in Pather Panchali.|$|E

40|$|This study {{explores the}} impact of school-based victimization on the ado-lescent’s social bond. Previous {{research}} has provided empirical support for Hirschi’s social control theory that the strength of <b>the</b> <b>adolescent’s</b> social bond {{is associated with the}} probability that he or she will engage in criminal offending. However, research identifying what factors influence the strength of <b>the</b> <b>adolescent’s</b> social bond is limited. In addition, research has estab-lished that school-based victimization is associated with numerous negative outcomes, including diminished educational outcomes and criminal offend-ing. Therefore, it is plausible that school-based victimization undermines <b>the</b> <b>adolescent’s</b> social bonds to school. Using a sample of 10 th-grade students from the Educational Longitudinal Study of 2002, HLM models were devel-oped to explore the relationship between school-based victimization and <b>the</b> <b>adolescent’s</b> social bond to school. The results suggest that school-based victimization has a negative association with three elements of the adoles-cent’s social bond to school: attachment, commitment, and belief.

40|$|Background: People in Cameroon are {{experiencing}} a dietary transition characterized by changing from traditional food habits to increased intake of highly processed sweet and fatty food. The rapid change in food pattern {{combined with an}} increased sedentary lifestyle {{has resulted in a}} rather high prevalence of obesity, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes. Nutritional intake is important during adolescence for growth spurt, health, cognitive development and performance in school. Objective: The aim of this thesis was to assess dietary intake, anthropometry and physical activity of adolescents according to sex and socioeconomic status (SES) and to investigate food perceptions of adolescents living in urban and rural areas of Cameroon. Methods: Girls and boys, 12 - 16 years of age, were randomly selected from schools in urban and rural areas. Food frequency questionnaire, 24 -hour dietary and physical activity recalls, anthropometric measurements, qualitative interviews and a background questionnaire were used for data collection. Results: The proportion of overweight was three times higher in girls (14 %) compared to boys (4 %). Stunting and underweight were more common among boys (15 % and 6 %) than girls (5 % and 1 %). The prevalence of stunting was two times higher among <b>the</b> urban <b>adolescents</b> with low SES (12 %) compared to those with high SES (5 %). <b>The</b> rural <b>adolescents</b> had <b>the</b> highest proportion of stunting but more muscle that <b>the</b> urban <b>adolescents.</b> <b>The</b> rural <b>adolescents</b> ate in order to live and to maintain health. Urban adolescents with low SES ate in order to maintain health, while those with high SES ate for pleasure. More than 30 % of <b>the</b> <b>adolescents</b> skipped breakfast in the urban area. Urban adolescents with high SES and girls reported a more frequent consumption of in-between meals and most food groups compared to <b>the</b> rural <b>adolescents,</b> boys and those with low SES. Over 55 % of <b>the</b> <b>adolescents</b> had a protein intake below 10 % of the energy (E%). Twenty-six percent of <b>the</b> <b>adolescents</b> had fat intake below 25 E%, and 25 % had fat intake above 35 E%. A large proportion of <b>the</b> <b>adolescents</b> had an intake of micronutrients below the estimated average recommendation. Boys and <b>the</b> <b>adolescents</b> with low SES reported a higher energy expenditure and physical activity level than girls and <b>the</b> <b>adolescents</b> with high SES, respectively. Both under- and over-reporting of energy intake were common among <b>the</b> <b>adolescents.</b> Conclusions: <b>The</b> present study showed that nutrient inadequacy, stunting, underweight, as well as overweight and obesity were common among <b>the</b> <b>adolescents</b> in Cameroon. Therefore an intervention program targeting both under- and overnutrition among school adolescents is needed. Sex and socioeconomic differences also need to be considered...|$|R
25|$|Hensel {{and colleagues}} {{conducted}} a study with 387 female participants {{between the ages of}} 14 and 17 and found that as the girls got older (and learned more about their sexual self-concept), they experienced less anxiety, greater comfort with sexuality and experienced more instances of sexual activity. Additionally, across the four years (from 14-17), sexual self-esteem increased, and sexual anxiety lessened. The researchers stated that this may indicate that the more sexual experiences <b>the</b> <b>adolescent</b> girls have had, the more confidence they hold in their sexual behavior and sexuality. Additionally, it may mean that for girls who have not yet had intercourse, they become more confident and ready to participate in an encounter for the first time. Researchers state that these patterns indicate that adolescent sexual behavior is not at all sporadic and impulsive, rather that it is strongly affected by <b>the</b> <b>adolescent</b> girls’ sexual self-concept and changes and expands through time.|$|E
