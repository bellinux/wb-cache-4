40|$|A {{technique}} is described which allowed {{the measurement of}} the oxygen consumption of the isolated heart of Octopus vulgaris. Contraction of the heart resulted in an aortic output and a flow through the heart muscle into coronary veins (the coronary output). The flow and oxygen content of the aortic output and the coronary output were measured with variable input pressures and constant output back pressure (volume loaded), variable output back pressure and constant aortic output (pressure loaded), and during hypoxia. Volume loading of the heart resulted {{in an increase in}} aortic output, power output and <b>total</b> <b>oxygen</b> consumption. Pressure loading increased power output and <b>total</b> <b>oxygen</b> consumption of the heart. Exposure to hypoxia decreased the aortic output, power output and <b>total</b> cardiac <b>oxygen</b> consumption. In the response of the heart to reduced work, brought about either by a reduced input pressure or by hypoxic perfusate, the power output was linearly related to the <b>total</b> <b>oxygen</b> consumption of the heart.

In volume-loaded hearts the volume of the coronary output increased as aortic output increased; in pressure-loaded hearts coronary output increased as power output increased, but aortic output remained constant. In hypoxia, the coronary output increased as the aortic output fell. At a perfusate Po 2 of around 50 Torr (1 Torr = 133 Pa), the aortic output ceased although the heart continued to beat and the coronary output continued, accounting for all of the oxygen consumption of the heart.

However, there are numerous types of disposable samplers and no united standard for sampling. The goal in this study is to investigate the effect of slag protection type and sample geometry on sampling parameters and sample homogeneity. Three sample geometries were selected: i) Björneborg ii) Lollipop with a 6 mm thickness and iii) Lollipop with a 12 mm thickness. These sample geometries have been tested with two types of slag protection: metal-cap-protection and argon-protection. The filling velocity and solidification rate of steel samples have been experimentally measured during plant trials. The sample homogeneity with respect to <b>total</b> <b>oxygen</b> content and inclusion size distribution has been determined {{in different parts of the}} samples. The study shows that argon-protected samplers have lower, more even, filling velocities (0. 19 ± 0. 09 m/s) compared to metal-cap-protected samplers (1. 28 ± 2. 23 m/s). The solidification rate measurements of the different samplers show that the 6 mm thick Lollipop has the highest solidification rate (99 ~ 105 °C/s).  Measurements of <b>total</b> <b>oxygen</b> content in argon-protected samples showed little variation between different zones of the samples. However, metal-cap-protected samples contained much higher <b>total</b> <b>oxygen</b> contents.

Previous {{studies have examined the}} kinetics of oxygen consumption during a short recovery period in a limited number of patients. To our knowledge, no study has examined the prognostic information derived from indexes of recovery. Methods. We studied 153 patients and 55 control subjects. We calculated the ratio between <b>total</b> <b>oxygen</b> consumption during exercise and recovery, the half-recovery time of peak oxygen consumption, the time constant of recovery, the recovery time and the ratio between duration of exercise and recovery time. Results. Recovery of oxygen consumption was significantly delayed in patients, and this delay was related to the degree of exercise intolerance. After a median follow-up period of 439 days, for the total study group, percent of predicted peak oxygen consumption (p = 0. 003) and ejection fraction (p = 0. 03) were independent predictors of survival.
