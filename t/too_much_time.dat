5|$|Early in his career, Ford {{supported}} {{a constitutional amendment}} against desegregation busing. He also floated a proposal to put the federal budget on a two-year cycle, believing <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> was spent annually on budget wrangling. This idea, based on the model used in the Kentucky state budget, was never implemented. During the Ninety-fifth Congress (1977–1979), {{he was chairman of}} the Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences.|$|E
5|$|In 1987, Daniels {{returned}} to Indiana {{as president and}} CEO of the Hudson Institute, a conservative think tank. In 1988, Dan Quayle was elected Vice President of the United States, and Governor of Indiana Robert D. Orr offered to appoint Daniels to Quayle's vacant Senate seat. Daniels declined the offer, saying it would force him to spend <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> away from his family.|$|E
5|$|Pairing up study {{partners}} {{has been}} compared to making a shidduch (marriage match), as the skills, interests, temperament and schedule of each person must be taken into consideration. Good friends do not necessarily make good chavrusas. If the chavrusas spend <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> chatting or joking with each other at the expense of their study time, they are advised to find different study partners.|$|E

40|$|According to, for {{instance}} Severin Sorensen, the home security market (consumer market) {{as well as}} the Small businesses market has not really taken of and there has been debate as to why this is. Many seem to view the market with small businesses, {{as well as the}} regular consumer business, as something that requires <b>too</b> <b>much</b> sales <b>time,</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> support <b>time</b> and <b>too</b> little overall gains to be worth the effort. We would argue that this is both erroneous, as well as a dangerous view to have for a sustainable security business...|$|R
5|$|Eight {{weeks after}} the {{incident}} with the ambulance, Mac is in a coma and Guy has been suspended from his job. Caroline is spending <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> with Mac, in Sue's opinion, and tries to stop her from seeing him. During his coma, Sue steals some of Mac's semen to make herself pregnant. Mac then {{comes out of his}} coma, but is suffering from memory loss and cannot remember his new-found love for Caroline. Angela soon leaves the hospital in order to take a career in television. With Angela gone, Guy becomes Caroline's new lodger.|$|E
5|$|In late 1923, having {{decided not}} to return to Cambridge, Allen took {{a job in the}} City (London's {{financial}} district) working for the Royal Exchange Assurance Corporation as an underwriter. Not particularly well-off financially, he had to work full-time and throughout his career could not afford to take <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> away from business. He played cricket as often as he could in the summer; when unable to play for Middlesex, he played weekend club cricket—including for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC)—and country house cricket.|$|E
5|$|Jack Bros. {{follows the}} three Jack {{brothers}} – Jack Frost, Jack Lantern and Jack Skelton – who have traveled from the fairy {{world to the}} human world through a portal that opens every year on Halloween. Losing track of time, they spend <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> in the human world, and forget about returning until there only is one hour left to the portal's closing; the fairy Pixie shows them a shortcut, which, while dangerous, {{is the only way}} to return to the portal in time.|$|E

5|$|Singers {{and players}} admired Britten's conducting, and David Webster rated it highly enough {{to offer him}} the musical {{directorship}} of the Covent Garden Opera in 1952. Britten declined; he was not confident of his ability as a conductor and was reluctant to spend <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> performing rather than composing. As a conductor, Britten's repertory included Purcell, Bach, Haydn, Mozart and Schubert, and occasional less characteristic choices including Schumann's Scenes from Goethe's Faust; Elgar's The Dream of Gerontius and Introduction and Allegro; Holst's Egdon Heath and short pieces by Percy Grainger.|$|E
5|$|After the altercation with Gauguin, Van Gogh {{returned}} to his room, where he was assaulted by voices and severed his left ear with a razor (either wholly or in part; accounts differ), causing severe bleeding. He bandaged the wound, wrapped the ear in paper, and delivered the package to a woman at a brothel Van Gogh and Gauguin both frequented. Van Gogh was found unconscious the next morning by a policeman and taken to hospital, where Félix Rey, a young doctor still in training, treated him. The ear was delivered to the hospital, but Rey {{did not attempt to}} reattach it as <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> had passed.|$|E
5|$|Christian Donlan of Eurogamer was {{surprised}} by the long length of the game and the amount of variety it offered given its simple premise. He enjoyed the game's pacing and felt that separating puzzles into short levels kept the game fun. Game Informer reviewer Kyle Hilliard also approved of the game's pacing. He remarked that BoxBoy!s low price and well-designed puzzles made it entirely worth playing. VentureBeat writer Gavin Greene agreed that the game offered a lot of content at an inexpensive price. The game's structure did draw some criticism from Jon Wahlgren, writing for Nintendo Life. He thought the game spent <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> teaching new mechanics and did not give players enough freedom to explore or experiment; as a result he believed the game felt restricted.|$|E

5|$|Eisenhower favored Shoup {{because he}} feared other {{officers}} spent <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> in political affairs, and felt Shoup {{would reduce the}} influence of the military industrial complex. Immediately after his appointment, Shoup sought to place new officers in key positions, in an attempt to overhaul the leadership of the Marine Corps. He and Pate disagreed over some of the new appointments, as Shoup transferred many senior officers and encouraged others to retire. Shoup later wrote he felt the Joint Chiefs of Staff had an undue weight in the direction of military strategy. He also sought to curtail politicking by lower-level Marine officers seeking career advancement.|$|E
5|$|Hand's {{three years}} at Harvard Law School were intellectually and {{socially}} stimulating. In his second year, he moved into a boarding house {{with a group of}} fellow law students who were to become close friends. They studied hard and enjoyed discussing philosophy and literature and telling bawdy tales. Hand's intellectual reputation proved less of a hindrance at law school than it had as an undergraduate. He was elected to the Pow-Wow Club, in which law students practiced their skills in moot courts. He was also chosen as an editor of the Harvard Law Review, although he resigned in 1894 because it took <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> from his studies.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Ciaran Donnelly, who also directed the previous episode. Mike Bullen visited Sydney in March 2001 to scout for locations. He was followed in May by producer Spencer Campbell and production designer Chris Truelove, who made preliminary casting decisions and scouted more locations. They finalised the arrangements in July. Unusually, the production schedule was drawn up without a final script in place. This caused complications as Campbell allocated <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> for filming in Sydney and not enough in Manchester. As a result, some scenes set in Sydney were filmed in Manchester; the scene where the characters arrive at Sydney Airport was filmed in a hall at the University of Manchester. Campbell rationalised that viewers {{who had never been}} to Sydney {{would not be able to}} tell the difference.|$|E

5|$|The player gains {{points by}} {{defeating}} multiple enemies consecutively and {{can participate in}} a bonus round to gain more points. Enemies are defeated by kicking them over once they have been flipped on their back. This is accomplished by hitting the platform the enemy is on directly beneath them. If the player allows <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> to pass after doing this, the enemy will flip itself back over, changing in color and increasing speed. Each phase has {{a certain number of}} enemies, with the final enemy immediately changing color and increasing to maximum speed. Hitting a flipped enemy from underneath causes it to right itself and start moving again, but it does not change speed or color.|$|E
5|$|To {{conserve}} energy, heterothermic bats during long migrations may {{go into a}} torpid state while roosting in the daytime, {{and flying}} at night. Unlike migratory birds which fly {{during the day and}} feed during the night, nocturnal bats have a conflict between traveling and eating. Using torpor, bats can save around 90% of energy that they would have spent trying to keep their body temperature at a normal level; thereby reducing the need to feed. It also decreases the duration of migration, which may prevent them from spending <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> in unfamiliar places, and decrease predation. Pregnant individuals of some species may not use torpor.|$|E
5|$|Youth spend <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> {{learning}} what their teachers think is important, irrelevant {{from what the}} youth may already know. The manager of learning value allows the youth to learn and practice his skills in situations simulating real life. The Manager of Learning methodology first exposes the learner to a situation to help both the learner and the leader assess his current state of knowledge. This causes the learner to internalize a need to improve his knowledge or skills. This {{is followed by a}} period of teaching or exposure during which the participant improves from their base-line knowledge. The participant then gets a chance to apply what he has learned, and lastly, evaluates his performance improvement.|$|E

5|$|Arriving in San Francisco {{after having}} been {{released}} from questioning by immigration officials on Angel Island on 11 August 1918, Prokofiev was soon compared to other famous Russian exiles (such as Sergei Rachmaninoff). His debut solo concert in New York led to several further engagements. He also received a contract from the {{music director of the}} Chicago Opera Association, Cleofonte Campanini, for the production of his new opera The Love for Three Oranges; however, due to Campanini's illness and death, the premiere was postponed. The delay was another example of Prokofiev's bad luck in operatic matters. The failure also cost him his American solo career since the opera took <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> and effort. He soon found himself in financial difficulties, and in April 1920, he left for Paris, not wanting to return to Russia as a failure.|$|E
5|$|By July 1944, Oppenheimer had {{concluded}} that plutonium {{could not be used}} in a gun design, and opted for implosion. The accelerated effort on an implosion design, codenamed Fat Man, began in August 1944 when Oppenheimer implemented a sweeping reorganization of the Los Alamos laboratory to focus on implosion. Two new groups were created at Los Alamos to develop the implosion weapon, X (for explosives) Division headed by Kistiakowsky and G (for gadget) Division under Robert Bacher. Although Teller was head of the T-1 (Implosion and Super) Group, Bethe considered that Teller was spending <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> on the Super, which had been given a low priority by Bethe and Oppenheimer. In June 1944, Oppenheimer created a dedicated Super Group under Teller, who was made directly responsible to Oppenheimer, and Peierls became head of the T-1 (Implosion) Group. In September, Teller's group became the F-1 (Super and General Theory) Group, part of the Enrico Fermi's new F (Fermi) Division.|$|E
5|$|In an August 10 Small Group meeting, the {{principals}} agreed to use Tomahawk cruise missiles, rather than troops or aircraft, in the retaliatory strikes. Cruise missiles {{had been previously}} used against Libya and Iraq as reprisals for the 1986 Berlin discotheque bombing and the 1993 attempted assassination of then-President George H. W. Bush. Using cruise missiles also helped to preserve secrecy; airstrikes would have required more preparation that might have leaked {{to the media and}} alerted bin Laden. The option of using commandos was discarded, as it required <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> to prepare forces, logistics, and combat search and rescue. Using helicopters or bombers would have been difficult {{due to the lack of}} a suitable base or Pakistani permission to cross its airspace, and the administration also feared a recurrence of the disastrous 1980 Operation Eagle Claw in Iran. While military officials suggested bombing Kandahar, which bin Laden and his associates often visited, the administration was concerned about killing civilians and hurting the U.S.' image.|$|E
