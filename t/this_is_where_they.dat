The story was sent east by telegraph where it made headline news.|$|E

The following morning, the friends gather in Monica and Chandler's empty apartment.

The females all become sexually mature at the same time. At this point during {{this part of the}} breeding season males die off, so that the number of males becomes equal or slightly smaller than the number of females. By August, most females live in their nests overnight for increasing periods, as <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> will lay eggs. The nests are located in rolled up leaves and are made of thick silk, which is expensive to build. Tests show that females use visual landmarks to return to their nests.

60|$|Now it is {{this simple}} truth which, like many others, is too simple for our {{scientists}} to see. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> go wrong, not only about true religion, but about false religions too; so that their account of mythology is more mythical than the myth itself. I do not confine myself to {{saying that they are}} quite incorrect when they state (for instance) that Christ was a legend of dying and reviving vegetation, like Adonis or Persephone. I say that even if Adonis was a god of vegetation, they have got the whole notion of him wrong. Nobody, to begin with, is sufficiently interested in decaying vegetables, as such, to make any particular mystery or disguise about them; and certainly not enough to disguise them under the image of a very handsome young man, which is a vastly more interesting thing. If Adonis was connected with the fall of leaves in autumn and the return of flowers in spring, the process of thought was quite different. It is a process of thought which springs up spontaneously in all children and young artists; it springs up spontaneously in all healthy societies. It is very difficult to explain in a diseased society.|$|E
