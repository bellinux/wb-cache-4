When directing animation for early episodes, one of Stephen Hillenburg's goals was for each character to have a separate walk cycle that showed their personalities; storyboard artist Erik Wiese designed Krabs' walk cycle with the intention of making it cartoonish. Wiese recalled in 2012, [...] "I animated Mr. Krabs' little feet on a four-frame multi-blur cycle—I think it was the best solution to making him walk like a crab."

2500|$|In 1984, Martin Peng of ORNL {{proposed}} an alternate {{arrangement of the}} magnet coils that would greatly reduce the aspect ratio while avoiding the erosion issues of the compact tokamak: a Spherical tokamak. Instead of wiring each magnet coil separately, he proposed using a single large conductor in the center, and wiring the magnets as half-rings off of this conductor. What was once a series of individual rings passing {{through the hole in}} the center of the reactor was reduced to a single post, allowing for aspect ratios as low as 1.2. The ST concept appeared to represent an enormous advance in tokamak design. However, it was being proposed during a period when US fusion research budgets were being dramatically scaled back. ORNL was provided with funds to develop a suitable central column built out of a high-strength copper alloy called [...] "Glidcop". However, they were unable to secure funding to build a demonstration machine, [...] "STX". Failing to build an ST at ORNL, Peng began a worldwide effort to interest other teams in the ST concept and get a <b>test</b> <b>machine</b> built. One way to do this quickly would be to convert a spheromak machine to the Spherical tokamak layout. Peng's advocacy also caught the interest of Derek Robinson, of the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority fusion center at Culham. Robinson was able to gather together a team and secure funding on the order of 100,000 pounds to build an experimental machine, the Small Tight Aspect Ratio Tokamak, or START. Several parts of the machine were recycled from earlier projects, while others were loaned from other labs, including a 40 keV neutral beam injector from ORNL. Construction of START began in 1990, it was assembled rapidly and started operation in January 1991.|$|E

40|$|An {{ultrasonic}} fatigue <b>testing</b> <b>machine</b> {{was developed}} to obtain the very high cycle fatigue life at elevated temperature for 	safety and reliability of structural components in the faster breeder reactor (FBR). This <b>testing</b> <b>machine</b> consists of an 	amplifier, booster, horn and equipments such as a system controller and data acquisition. The test specimen is attached at 	the end of the horn. The electric power generated in the amplifier is transformed into the mechanical vibration in the 	converter and is magnified in the booster and horn. The developed ultrasonic fatigue <b>testing</b> <b>machine</b> enables to carry out 	the fatigue test at 20 kHz {{so that it can}} perform the very high cycle fatigue test within a very shorter time as compared with the 	regular fatigue <b>testing</b> <b>machines</b> such as a hydraulic fatigue <b>testing</b> <b>machine.</b> This study carried out very high cycle fatigue 	tests using type STBA 24, the steel for tube in boiler and heat exchanger, at room and elevated (673 K) temperatures by the 	developed testing and conventional hydraulic <b>testing</b> <b>machines,</b> and obtained the fatigue lives.

40|$|Abstract: The {{capability}} to withstand non-contact underwater explosions (UNDEX) {{is an important}} aspect to be emphasized {{in the design of}} modern warships, and shock testing is one of the efficient methods to qualify the ability. A brief history on the research of shock testing of naval shipboard equipment as well as major means in evaluating anti-shock performance of warship equipment is introduced first in this paper. Three prevailing shock test methods: UNDEX testing, virtual shock trial and land-based test with shock <b>test</b> <b>machines</b> are presented with the focus on the advances in shock <b>test</b> <b>machines</b> in US and Europe. Comparison of current shock testing facilities is also given. Moreover, some new concepts of shock <b>test</b> <b>machines</b> are reviewed as well, and three major directions of the development of shock <b>test</b> <b>machines</b> are concluded. The first trend is that shock <b>testing</b> <b>machines</b> are required to generate positive and negative shock pulse to simulate real UNDEX environment made up of shock wave followed by bubble pulse and structural whipping. The second is that shock <b>test</b> <b>machines</b> can <b>test</b> heavy equipments, and the last is that shock pulses can be controlled and customized conveniently. ...|$|R
