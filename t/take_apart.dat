5|$|After three days' rest, {{they set}} off again, searching for the trail. Eddy {{eventually}} succumbed to his hunger and ate human flesh, but that was soon gone. They began to <b>take</b> <b>apart</b> their snowshoes to eat the oxhide webbing and discussed killing Luis and Salvador for food, before Eddy warned the two men and they quietly left. Jay Fosdick died during the night, leaving only seven members of the party. Eddy and Mary Graves left to hunt, but when they returned with deer meat, Fosdick's body had already been cut apart for food. After several more days—25 since they had left Truckee Lake—they came across Salvador and Luis, who had not eaten for about nine days and were close to death. William Foster shot the pair, believing that their flesh was the group's last hope of avoiding imminent death from starvation.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, Matt and Jeff {{created their}} own wrestling promotion, The Organization of Modern Extreme Grappling Arts (frequently {{abbreviated}} to OMEGA Championship Wrestling, or simply OMEGA), in which Matt competed under the name High Voltage. The Hardys launched the promotion because, at the time, there weren't many places to wrestle, nor did they know anyone who could help. Both Matt and Jeff would <b>take</b> <b>apart</b> the ring {{and put it back}} together at every event they had, while Matt sewed all the costumes worn in OMEGA. The promotion would fold in October 1999, after both Matt and Jeff signed with the World Wrestling Federation. Eight years later in 2007, Highspots.com produced a two-disc DVD set entitled OMEGA: Uncommon Passion, chronicling the history of the promotion, including matches and interviews with many OMEGA wrestlers.|$|E
5|$|Lysosomes {{carry out}} {{intracellular}} digestion, {{in a process}} called phagocytosis (from the Greek phagein, to eat and kytos, vessel, referring here to the cell), by fusing with a vacuole and releasing their enzymes into the vacuole. Through this process, sugars, amino acids, and other monomers pass into the cytosol and become nutrients for the cell. Lysosomes also use their hydrolytic enzymes to recycle the cell's obsolete organelles in a process called autophagy. The lysosome engulfs another organelle and uses its enzymes to <b>take</b> <b>apart</b> the ingested material. The resulting organic monomers are {{then returned to the}} cytosol for reuse. The last function of a lysosome is to digest the cell itself through autolysis.|$|E

25|$|Ron Geaves, a {{professor}} in various fields of religion and long-time adherent of Rawat, wrote that Rawat is not a renunciate, {{and that he has}} made great efforts to assert his humanity and <b>take</b> <b>apart</b> the hagiography that has developed around him. According to Geaves Rawat, rather than considering himself a charismatic leader, deemphasizes the sealing of the master disciple relationship, and focuses on correct practice and staying in touch through participation or listening.|$|E

25|$|A {{significant}} amount of preparation goes into {{the running of the}} mini-marathon. Since 2008, fifteen or sixteen members of Dublin City Council has spent the weeks in the build-up to the marathon testing water hydrants in the St Stephen's Green and Stillorgan Road areas to ensure they are working properly. On the morning of the race, they begin a process of laying out cables and attaching them to the hydrants. The cables also have to be covered and ramps have to be installed for the benefit of wheelchair users. When the race is over, the crew have to <b>take</b> <b>apart</b> all their installations.|$|E
25|$|The renter Nathaniel H. Ragland then {{purchased}} the property for $1,250 in 1872. After Nathaniel died in 1888, his widow Martha sold {{the property in}} 1891 for $10,000 to a Captain Myron Dunlap of Niagara Falls, New York. Dunlap and some other investors who participated devised a few plans intending {{to capitalize on the}} notoriety of the property. One idea was to completely <b>take</b> <b>apart</b> the wooden house and move it to Chicago as an exhibit for the World's Columbian Exposition of 1893. This plan fell through due to lack of total interest of all the investors involved.|$|E
25|$|To scholars, {{the use of}} unpegged joints seems odd, if not eccentric, and is {{not found}} in well established, ancient Mediterranean {{shipbuilding}} traditions. This approach allowed Egyptian boats used in trade to be easily disassembled, the planks transported long distances through the desert and then re-assembled to be used on important trading routes {{such as those in}} the Red Sea. There are pictographs of boats dating from Predynastic Egypt and the First Dynasty along {{the first half of the}} route in the desert known to be used to reach the Red Sea from Upper Egypt.

25|$|Deming's {{teachings and}} {{philosophy}} are clearly illustrated {{by examining the}} results they produced after they were adopted by Japanese industry, as the following example shows. Ford Motor Company was simultaneously manufacturing a car model with transmissions made in Japan and the United States. Soon after the car model was on the market, Ford customers were requesting the model with Japanese transmission over the US-made transmission, and {{they were willing to}} wait for the Japanese model. As both transmissions were made to the same specifications, Ford engineers could not understand the customer preference for the model with Japanese transmission. Finally, Ford engineers decided to <b>take</b> <b>apart</b> the two different transmissions. The American-made car parts were all within specified tolerance levels. On the other hand, the Japanese car parts were virtually identical to each other, and much closer to the nominal values for the parts—e.g., if a part was supposed to be one foot long, plus or minus 1/8 of an inch—then the Japanese parts were all within 1/16 of an inch, less variation. This made the Japanese cars run more smoothly and customers experienced fewer problems.|$|E

The Foundation's aim is to inspire young people to study engineering and become engineers by encouraging students to think differently and to make mistakes. [...] The Foundation supports engineering education in schools and universities, as well as medical and scientific research in partnership with charities. It achieves this by funding different resources such as the [...] "Engineering Box", a box filled with activities for a school {{to use as a}} teaching aid. The Foundation loans the boxes to schools for four weeks free of charge, they are suitable for Key Stage 4 and above. [...] The Engineering Box enables students to <b>take</b> <b>apart</b> and examine a Dyson DC22 Telescope vacuum cleaner.

2500|$|The railroad's charter gave it {{two years}} to be built. However, like the {{original}} plan for the line, numerous difficulties were encountered. One such issue was the acquisition of the necessary property for the line's right-of-way. Many property owners refused to sell their land, {{which was in the}} way of the proposed line. To prevent the loss of the line's charter, in 1853, the company successfully petitioned for an extension of two more years to build the line. A bill was passed in 1853 that gave the company the right to operate ferry service between New York and Staten Island. Still facing difficulties, in January 1855, the company applied to the New York State Legislature for a three-year extension to complete the project. After all of the property required for the right-of-way was completed, construction commenced in November 1855. However, after construction had started they had run out of money to complete the line. Therefore, they asked Cornelius [...] "Commodore" [...] Vanderbilt, the sole Staten Island-to-Manhattan ferry operator, for a loan. Vanderbilt agreed to finance the railroad, but he changed the northern terminal of line from Stapleton to his ferry landing further east, Vanderbilt's Landing. Vanderbilt tried to stop competitors who had previously owned the railroad's lease. Vanderbilt appointed James R. Robinson to build a structure to block his competitors, but on July 28, 1851, people tried to <b>take</b> <b>apart</b> the almost-finished structure, threatening to hurt Robinson if he tried to block them. In 1858, Cornelius's son William Vanderbilt was inducted onto the railway's board of directors.|$|E
