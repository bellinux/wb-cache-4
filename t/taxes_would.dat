This work contended that rational consumers would spend a proportional amount of what they perceived to be their permanent income. Windfall gains would mostly be saved. Tax reductions likewise, as rational consumers would predict that <b>taxes</b> <b>would</b> have to increase later to balance public finances. Other important contributions include his critique of the Phillips curve and the concept of the natural rate of unemployment (1968). This critique associated his name, together with that of Edmund Phelps, with the insight that a government that brings about greater inflation cannot permanently reduce unemployment by doing so. Unemployment may be temporarily lower, if the inflation is a surprise, {{but in the long run}} unemployment will be determined by the frictions and imperfections of the labor market.|$|E

40|$|The U. S. Congress is {{considering}} several strategies {{to reform the}} federal income tax system. The most widely discussed strategy, a flat <b>tax,</b> <b>would</b> <b>tax</b> income received by businesses and individuals at the same low, flat rate. Flat <b>tax</b> proposals <b>would</b> eliminate most <b>tax</b> deductions and <b>tax</b> credits but <b>would</b> increase the personal exemption for individual taxpayers. While the debate continues over whether a flat <b>tax</b> <b>would</b> be fair to individual taxpayers, assessing {{the effect of a}} flat tax on economic growth and business activity is also important. > Most economists who analyze tax incentives conclude that a flat <b>tax</b> <b>would</b> encourage economic growth, which would {{have a positive effect on}} businesses in general. The effects on businesses would not be uniform, however, and many small businesses would be affected differently than large businesses. Small businesses are an important component in the U. S. economy, producing about half of private sector output and employing over half of the work force, so tax reformers need to understand how a flat <b>tax</b> <b>would</b> affect the small business sector of the economy. > Golob examines the effects of a flat tax on businesses in general and on small businesses in particular. He concludes that businesses in general are likely to benefit from a flat tax and that small businesses are likely to benefit more than large businesses. Most businesses would benefit from higher economic activity associated with a flat <b>tax.</b> Small businesses <b>would</b> benefit even more than large businesses, due in part to reduced compliance costs. In addition, a flat <b>tax</b> <b>would</b> eliminate <b>tax</b> deductions and tax credits less widely available to small businesses, thereby leveling the playing field between large and small businesses. Moreover, lower interest rates under a flat <b>tax</b> <b>would</b> offset more of the loss of interest deductibility for small businesses than for large businesses.

5000|$|Standard {{economic}} {{theory suggests that}} a land value <b>tax</b> <b>would</b> be extremely efficient - unlike other taxes, it does not reduce economic productivity. Milton Friedman described Henry George's tax on unimproved value of land as the [...] "least bad tax", since unlike other <b>taxes,</b> it <b>would</b> not impose an excess burden on economic activity (leading to zero or even negative [...] "deadweight loss"); hence, a replacement of other more distortionary taxes with a land value <b>tax</b> <b>would</b> improve economic welfare. As land value tax can improve the use of land and redirect investment toward productive, non-rentseeking activities, it could even have a negative deadweight loss that boosts productivity. Because land value <b>tax</b> <b>would</b> apply to foreign land speculators, the Australian Treasury estimated that land value tax was unique in having a negative marginal excess burden, meaning that it would increase long-run living standards.|$|R

In places, the rate went up to ten times higher—despite the poverty of the region. The planters had not invested in infrastructure and much had been destroyed during the war. In part, the new tax system was designed to force owners of large plantations with huge tracts of uncultivated land either to sell or to have it confiscated for failure to pay taxes.
