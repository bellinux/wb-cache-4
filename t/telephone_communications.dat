5|$|Portland, Oregon police {{officers}} searched {{the home of}} James Butler Elkins, ostensibly for obscene material, and seized tape recordings that Elkins had made from illegal wiretaps. He was subsequently convicted in federal court of intercepting and divulging <b>telephone</b> <b>communications,</b> but appealed his federal conviction {{on the grounds that}} state police had gathered the evidence against him in violation of his Fourth Amendment rights. His conviction was upheld by the Ninth US Circuit Court of Appeals.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{objective}} of the Japanese at Kranji was to capture Kranji village; this would let them repair the demolished Causeway {{in order to facilitate}} easy flow of reinforcements and supplies down the roads of Woodlands and Mandai, and {{to the rest of the}} island for their vanguard force. Once the leading wave of Japanese was safely ashore, the massed Japanese artillery switched their fire to the defensive positions at Kranji. Telegraph and <b>telephone</b> <b>communications</b> were destroyed in the bombardment and communications between the front line and command HQ were broken. At 8:30pm that night, the men of the Imperial Guards Division began the crossing from Johor in special armoured landing-crafts, collapsible boats and by swimming.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, the Department of Homeland Security {{was created}} by the Homeland Security Act to {{coordinate}} domestic anti-terrorism efforts. The USA Patriot Act gave the federal government greater powers, including the authority to detain foreign terror suspects for a week without charge, to monitor <b>telephone</b> <b>communications,</b> e-mail, and Internet use by terror suspects, and to prosecute suspected terrorists without time restrictions. The FAA ordered that airplane cockpits be reinforced to prevent terrorists gaining control of planes, and assigned sky marshals to flights. Further, the Aviation and Transportation Security Act made the federal government, rather than airports, responsible for airport security. The law created the Transportation Security Administration to inspect passengers and luggage, causing long delays and concern over passenger privacy. After suspected abuses of the USA Patriot Act were brought to light in June 2013 with articles about collection of American call records by the NSA and the PRISM program (see 2013 mass surveillance disclosures), Representative Jim Sensenbrenner, Republican of Wisconsin, who introduced the Patriot Act in 2001, said that the National Security Agency overstepped its bounds.|$|E

5|$|With {{the help}} of an Egyptian agent, the CIA had {{obtained}} a sample of soil from the facility taken in December 1997 showing the presence of O-Ethyl methylphosphonothioic acid (EMPTA), a substance used in the production of VX nerve gas, at 2.5 times trace levels. (Reports are contradictory on whether the soil was obtained from within the compound itself, or outside.) The collected soil was split into three samples, which were then analyzed by a private laboratory. The agent's bona fides were later confirmed through polygraph testing; however, the CIA produced a report on Al-Shifa on July 24, 1998, questioning whether Al-Shifa produced chemical weapons or simply stored precursors, and the agency advised collecting more soil samples. Cohen and Tenet later briefed U.S. senators on intercepted <b>telephone</b> <b>communications</b> from the plant that reputedly bolstered the American case against Al-Shifa. U.S. intelligence also purportedly researched the Al-Shifa factory online and searched commercial databases, but did not find any medicines for sale.|$|E
5|$|After the storm, Tampico {{was left}} without power or communications. About 15,000people became {{homeless}} {{due to the}} storm, or previously from Hurricane Gladys. The governor of Tamaulipas {{declared a state of}} emergency and requested assistance from the military to provide food and shelter. Within a day after the storm, water access was restored, although the city initially remained without power or <b>telephone.</b> <b>Communications</b> were cut to Tampico, except for the airport at the radio. The rail line from Laredo, Texas to Mexico City was cut during the storm, but was restored ten days later. Due to ongoing flood conditions, there was an outbreak of dysentery that killed two children. The Mexican government flew medical supplies, food, and clothing from Mexico City to Tampico, while four United States helicopters assisted in rescue missions along the Pánuco River. About 10days after Hilda struck Tampico, Hurricane Janet affected the same area, causing further damage and deaths. Collectively, the two hurricanes caused 1,240deaths along their paths, and damage from the consecutive storms totaled about half of Mexico's 1955 national budget. After the two hurricanes, the Mexican government and military worked to assist the affected residents, and the Mexican Red Cross provided vaccinations and medical assistance to prevent the spread of disease.|$|E

50|$|From {{the mid-1950s}} Drakelow Depot, {{as it had}} become, was {{initially}} used by the Ministry of Supply for storage. Around 1958 {{the part of the}} site in the area north of tunnel 4, formerly occupied by the RAF stores area, was developed by the Home Office as a Regional Seat of Government (RSG 9.2). This was designed to cater for a staff of 325, and contained dormitories, storage areas, workshops, electrical equipment, toilets, offices, a BBC studio, a GPO <b>Telephones</b> <b>communications</b> facility and other facilities. It was publicly exposed in a demonstration held there by the West Midlands Committee of 100 in the summer of 1963.|$|R

25|$|In 1966, the Northern Electric {{research}} lab, Northern Electric Laboratories (the predecessor to Bell-Northern Research), {{started looking}} into the possibilities of fiber optic cable, and in 1969, began work on digitizing <b>telephone</b> <b>communications.</b> Also in 1969, Northern began making inroads into the U.S. market with its switching systems. In 1972, it opened its first factory in the U.S. in Michigan. In 1975, Northern began shipping its first digital switching systems, {{one of the earliest}} such systems to be sold.|$|E
25|$|As a result, the {{insights}} into {{the inner workings of}} the GCSB provide information about the allied agencies as well. In particular, Hager documented the US-coordinated ECHELON system, through which the five agencies intercept and process huge volumes of international e-mail, fax and <b>telephone</b> <b>communications.</b> Hager was one of the earliest to write about the secretive ECHELON worldwide electronic spy network. As a result of his book, in 2001 he testified before the European Parliament on his research into the network.|$|E
25|$|When {{this use}} of tapping powers was {{revealed}} in June 1957 (by which time Rab Butler had succeeded Lloyd George), {{there was a major}} row with the Leader of the Opposition Hugh Gaitskell demanding a full explanation. Butler pledged {{that it would not be}} a precedent and that he would consider withdrawing the evidence and asking the Bar council to disregard it. Marrinan was subsequently disbarred and expelled by Lincoln's Inn, but Butler was forced to appoint a committee of Privy Counsellors under Sir Norman Birkett to look into the prerogative power of intercepting <b>telephone</b> <b>communications.</b>|$|E

25|$|The Russian Orbital Segment {{communicates}} {{directly with}} the ground via the Lira antenna mounted to Zvezda. The Lira antenna also has the capability to use the Luch data relay satellite system. This system, used for communications with Mir, fell into disrepair during the 1990s, and so {{is no longer in}} use, although two new Luch satellites—Luch-5A and Luch-5B—were launched in 2011 and 2012 respectively to restore the operational capability of the system. Another Russian communications system is the Voskhod-M, which enables internal <b>telephone</b> <b>communications</b> between Zvezda, Zarya, Pirs, Poisk and the USOS, and also provides a VHF radio link to ground control centres via antennas on Zvezda exterior.|$|E
25|$|No {{appeals court}} had yet been {{called upon to}} decide whether users had a {{reasonable}} expectation of privacy over the content of email. Hull's opinion extrapolated from older precedents on postal and <b>telephone</b> <b>communications,</b> along with more recent cases from district courts and a Tenth Circuit ruling on email addresses, to assert {{that there was no}} reasonable expectation of privacy over email content once it reached a third-party server, since it was transmitted from there to other servers and copied and archived along the way. There was at the time no settled law on the subject, and privacy advocates expressed concern and criticized the decision. After Quon, the panel granted rehearing.|$|E
25|$|Another {{difficulty}} was communications. The Air Signals Corps was {{put under}} severe pressure. Radio signals over vast areas were vulnerable to interception so telephone lines were used instead. The line from Richthofen's Fliegerkorps VII to Kesselring's command train at Luftflotte 2 was 780 miles. <b>Telephone</b> <b>communications</b> were vulnerable to Partisans. However, {{the development of}} radio and their use with forward air controllers, the Flivos was critical and remained unaffected. In this tactical sphere, reports received could be acted upon in real time by use of radio in a short time, lessening {{the ability of the}} enemy to react. It enabled the Luftwaffe to respond quickly to fluid events right at the front.|$|E
