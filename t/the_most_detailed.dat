5|$|Byzantine {{authors were}} the first to record these events. The {{earliest}} work is Emperor Leo the Wise's Tactics, finished around 904, which recounts the Bulgarian-Byzantine war of 894–896, a military conflict directly preceding the Hungarians' departure from the Pontic steppes. Nearly contemporary narration can be read in the Continuation of the Chronicle by George the Monk. However, De Administrando Imperio ("On Governing the Empire") provides <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>detailed</b> account. It was compiled under the auspices of Emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus in 951 or 952.|$|E
5|$|Much of the {{traditional}} history of the Fairy Flag is preserved in manuscript form. In {{the early part of}} the 20th century, Fred T. MacLeod noted one manuscript written around 1800, which he considered to be <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>detailed</b> description of the flag. Another source of the flag's traditional history is the Bannatyne manuscript, which documents {{the traditional}} history of Clan MacLeod. It dates to the 1830s, however, it is thought to have been based upon earlier traditions.|$|E
5|$|After the Battle of Svolder, {{the victorious}} leaders split Norway into areas of control. Heimskringla gives <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>detailed</b> {{account of the}} division, {{describing}} it as threefold. Olaf the Swede received four districts in Trondheim as well as Møre, Romsdal and Rånrike. He gave these to Jarl Svein Hákonarson, his son in law, to hold as a vassal. Svein Forkbeard gained possession of the Viken district, where Danish influence had long been strong. The rest of Norway was ruled by Eirik Hákonarson as Svein's vassal. Fagrskinna, in contrast, says that the Swedish part consisted of Oppland {{and a part of}} Trondheim. Other sources are less specific.|$|E
25|$|The known sources contain records about 65 events {{related to}} warfare and Great Moravia. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>details</b> is known from Frankish sources and are related Svätopluk's period.

50|$|The {{philosophy}} which {{discusses the}} Archeus in <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>detail</b> is medieval hermetic science, {{where we find}} the occult author Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa speaking at length about a previously purely platonic subject. This he likely derived from his teacher in hermetic science, {{a man by the}} name of Trithemius, who studied extensively under certain Neoplatonic philosophers.|$|R
5|$|Dana's {{work was}} {{followed}} up by geologist C. E. Dutton's 1884 expedition, who refined and expanded Dana's ideas. Most notably, Dutton {{established that the}} island of Hawaii actually harbored five volcanoes, whereas Dana counted three. This is because Dana had originally regarded Kīlauea as a flank vent of Mauna Loa, and Kohala as part of Mauna Kea. Dutton also refined others of Dana's observations, and is credited with the naming of 'a'ā and pāhoehoe-type lavas, although Dana had noted a distinction. Stimulated by Dutton's expedition, Dana returned in 1887, and published many accounts of his expedition in the American Journal of Science. In 1890 he published <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>detailed</b> manuscript of its day, and remained the definitive guide to Hawaiian volcanism for decades. 1909 saw the publication of two large volumes which extensively quoted from earlier works now out of circulation.|$|E
5|$|It {{was in this}} palace that Alboin {{was killed}} on June 28, 572. In the account given by Paul the Deacon, <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>detailed</b> {{narrative}} on Alboin's death, history and saga intermingle almost inextricably. Much earlier and shorter is the story told by Marius of Aventicum in his Chronica, written about a decade after Alboin's murder. According to his version the king {{was killed in a}} conspiracy by a man close to him, called Hilmegis (Paul's Helmechis), with the connivance of the queen. Helmichis then married the widow, but the two were forced to escape to Byzantine Ravenna, taking with them the royal treasure and part of the army, which hints at the cooperation of Byzantium. Roger Collins describes Marius as an especially reliable source because of his early date and his having lived close to Lombard Italy.|$|E
5|$|Labillardière {{eventually}} {{published the}} genus Adenanthos, along with A.cuneatus {{and two other}} species, in his 1805 Novae Hollandiae Plantarum Specimen. He chose the specific name cuneata {{in reference to the}} leaves of this species, which are cuneate (triangular). This name has feminine gender, consistent with the gender assigned by Labillardière to the genus. He did not designate which of the three published species was to serve as the type species of Adenanthos, but Irish botanist E. Charles Nelson has since chosen A.cuneatus as lectotype for the genus, since the holotype of A.cuneatus bears an annotation showing the derivation of the genus name, and because Labillardière's description of it is <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>detailed</b> of the three, and is referred to by the other descriptions.|$|E

5|$|Most {{information}} about Magnus is gleaned from Norse sagas and chronicles, which began appearing during the 12th century. The most important sources still available are the Norwegian chronicles Historia de Antiquitate Regum Norwagiensium by Theodoric the Monk and the anonymous Ágrip af Noregskonungasögum (or simply Ágrip) from the 1180s and the Icelandic sagas Heimskringla (by Snorri Sturluson), Morkinskinna and Fagrskinna, which date {{to about the}} 1220s. While the later sagas are <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>detailed</b> accounts, they are also generally considered the least reliable. Additional {{information about}} Magnus, in particular his campaigns, is found in sources from the British Isles, which included contemporary accounts.|$|E
5|$|Quantification of the {{proportion}} of barbarian-born troops in the 4th-century army is highly speculative. Elton has undertaken <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>detailed</b> analysis of the meagre evidence. According to this analysis, {{about a quarter of}} the sample of army officers was barbarian-born in the period 350–400. Analysis by decade shows that this proportion did not increase over the period, or indeed in the early 5th century. The latter trend implies that {{the proportion}} of barbarians in the lower ranks was not much greater, otherwise {{the proportion of}} barbarian officers would have increased over time to reflect that.|$|E
5|$|Several {{volcanic}} {{features in}} the Mount Cayley field were illustrated by volcanologist Jack Souther in 1980, including Mount Cayley, Cauldron Dome, Slag Hill, Mount Fee, Ember Ridge and Ring Mountain, which was titled Crucible Dome at the time. This resulted {{in the creation of}} a geologic map that showed the regional terrain and locations of the volcanoes. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>detailed</b> study of Mount Cayley took place during this period. Little Ring Mountain at the northernmost end of the field had not been studied at the time and was not included on Souther's 1980 map. Ember Ridge at the southern end of the field was originally mapped as a cluster of five lava domes. The sixth lava dome, Ember Ridge Northeast, was discovered by Ph.D. student Melanie Kelman during a period of research in 2001.|$|E

5|$|The {{account of}} Southchurch's {{provisioning}} was first {{made available to}} a wider audience through {{the writings of the}} English historian Helen Cam. Cam was responsible for groundbreaking work on the Hundred Rolls, and their relevance to English local government, through her Studies in the Hundred Rolls (1921) and The Hundred and the Hundred Rolls (1930). In both of these she made mention of what she calls '...the most picturesque series of extortions recorded in the Essex returns.' It was, however, in a paper published in the English Historical Review as early as 1916 that she gave <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>detailed</b> account of Southchurch's plot. Here she traced the dissemination of the Viking legend through Geoffrey of Monmouth, and speculated that Southchurch could have been acquainted with a later version by Gaimar, Wace or Layamon, or through a local, popular legend.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>detailed</b> {{account of}} this period is handed down to us by Tacitus, whose Annals {{dedicate}} the first six books entirely to the reign of Tiberius. Tacitus was a Roman senator, born {{during the reign of}} Nero in 56 AD, and consul suffect in AD 97. His text is largely based on the Acta Senatus (the minutes of the session of the Senate) and the Acta Diurna (a collection of the acts of the government and news of the court and capital), as well as speeches by Tiberius himself, and the histories of contemporaries such as Marcus Cluvius Rufus, Fabius Rusticus and Pliny the Elder (all of which are lost).|$|E
5|$|The woman's {{hands are}} crossed tightly {{as if in}} prayer, and {{positioned}} so low in the painting as {{to appear to be}} resting on the frame. They are rendered as tightly compressed into a small area of the picture; it is likely van der Weyden did not want them to result in an area of high tone that might distract from the description of her head. Her slender fingers are minutely detailed; van der Weyden often indicated the social position of his models through his rendering of their face and hands. The sleeve of her dress extends beyond her wrists. Her fingers are folded in layers; their intricate portrayal is <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>detailed</b> element in the painting, and echoes the pyramidal form of the upper portion of the painting.|$|E
