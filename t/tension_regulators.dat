Aglycon anthocyanidin forms, such as CY and DP, may be present in vivo after the first deglycosylation step occurring in the jejunum and in the liver. DP showed a major action compared to CY inducing a significant dose-dependent inhibitory effect on both protein and mRNA levels of ET- 1. CY and DP both increased the protein level of eNOS, but DP showed the major effect raising eNOS protein in a dose-dependent manner. To correlate the vasoprotective effect of CY and DP with their antioxidant activity, we analysed also the antioxidant effect of anthocyanidins both in vitro and in HUVECs. In particular, we examined the effect of anthocyanidins on endothelial heme oxygenase- 1 (HO- 1), an inducible stress protein. In all tests, DP showed a higher antioxidant activity than CY. Finally, the antiproliferative effect induced by DP was detected in HUVECs. DP and CY differ in the number and position of hydroxyl groups in their structure;, therefore, the greater biological activity by DP, compared with CY, seems {{to be due to}} the presence of the three hydroxyl groups on the B ring in the molecular structure of DP...|$|E

40|$|India has {{a decade-long}} {{experience}} with independent regulatory agencies in public services as an institutional transplant from the industrialized world. Introduced {{at the behest}} of international donor agencies, regulators in India are intended, somewhat naively, to provide an apolitical space for decision making to assuage investor concerns over arbitrary administrative actions, and thereby stimulate private investment. In practice, regulators have had to negotiate a terrain over which the state has continued to exercise considerable control. Regulators have also been been shaped in their functioning by national and sub-national political traditions and by administrative and political practices. The result is a hybrid institutional form that combines politics as usual with intriguing new, and unanticipated, opportunities for political intervention. This paper will explore the origins of electricity regulation as a form of institutional isomorphism. It will then compare the regulatory experience in India 2 ̆ 7 s electricity sector across two Indian states to understand the implications of transplanting regulatory agencies in the global south. An examination of the process through which regulatory decisions are reached illustrates how existing bureaucratic and technocratic networks, transplanted procedures, and administrative cultures combine to conservatively manage long-standing political tensions around electricity. In seeking to manage those <b>tensions,</b> <b>regulators</b> often take decisions - on tariff setting, for example - based on a political reading that belies the technocratic narrative on which institutional credibility rests. At the same time, civil society groups ranging from residential associations to professional associations to individuals are using newly created regulatory spaces to structure a more deliberative decision process...|$|R

We find that asset management firms (hedge funds and investment companies/advisors) in general, and institutions that actively manage large and risky portfolios in particular, are more likely to seek confidentiality. The confidential holdings are disproportionately associated with information-sensitive events such as mergers and acquisitions, and include stocks subjected to greater information asymmetry. Moreover, the confidential holdings of asset management firms exhibit superior risk-adjusted performance up to four months after the quarter end, suggesting that these institutions may possess valuable private information.

40|$|Since their inception, public {{lawyers and}} {{political}} scientists have fulminated {{at the lack}} of accountability of regulatory agencies. But, though it may surprise their critics, regulatory agencies do not {{go out of their way}} to be unaccountable. The difficulties of accountability, this article argues, lie in large part elsewhere: with the institutional position and accountability capacity of the accountors, and with the particular nature of the challenges that face them. The article focuses on developments in the roles of the four main accountors in the political domain in turn: the core executive, Parliament, the National Audit Office and consumer bodies, exploring their relationships both with the accountees (the regulators) and with other bodies which are calling those regulators to account. It examines their capacity to call regulators to account, and to meet the five core accountability challenges that face them: viz the scale and scope of the regulatory landscape; the number of organisations involved in any one regulatory domain, the complexity of their relationships and their propensity to blame-shift; the technical complexity and contestability of the regulatory task; the opacity of regulatory processes; and the willingness of the accountee to be called to account. These challenges produce deep-rooted tensions which are not easy to resolve, and create opportunities for blame-shifting which both accountors and accountees can, and do, seek to exploit. Moreover, the roles of accountors themselves are fluid, moving from accountor to participant to controller, bringing further complexity to the accountability relationship. However, it is the nature both of the relationship and the task of accountability that these tensions will exist, and it is right that they do, at least up to a point. For without those <b>tensions</b> both <b>regulators</b> and their accountors will become complacent, which will be to their detriment, as well as ours...|$|R
40|$|Many {{biochemical}} factors regulating {{progenitor cell}} differentiation {{have been examined}} in detail; however, {{the role of the}} local mechanical environment on stem cell fate has only recently been investigated. In this study, we examined whether oscillatory fluid flow, an exogenous mechanical signal within bone, regulates osteogenic, adipogenic or chondrogenic differentiation of C 3 H 10 T 1 / 2 murine mesenchymal stem cells by measuring Runx 2, PPARγ and SOX 9 gene expression, respectively. Furthermore, we hypothesized that the small GTPase RhoA and isometric tension within the actin cytoskeleton are essential in flow-induced differentiation. We found that oscillatory fluid flow induces the upregulation of Runx 2, Sox 9 and PPARγ, indicating that {{it has the potential to}} regulate transcription factors involved in multiple unique lineage pathways. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the small GTPase RhoA and its effector protein ROCKII regulate fluid-flow-induced osteogenic differentiation. Additionally, activated RhoA and fluid flow have an additive effect on Runx 2 expression. Finally, we show RhoA activation and actin <b>tension</b> are negative <b>regulators</b> of both adipogenic and chondrogenic differentiation. However, an intact, dynamic actin cytoskeleton under tension is necessary for flow-induced gene expression...|$|R
40|$|In the facultative {{photosynthetic}} bacterium Rhodobacter capsulatus, {{the transcription}} of genes encoding pigment binding proteins is tightly regulated {{in response to}} the oxygen partial pressure by the RegB/ RegA two component system. After a shift from high to low oxygen <b>tension,</b> the response <b>regulator</b> RegA enhances transcription of the puf and puc operon coding for the reaction center, light-harvesting complex I (LHI), and LHII proteins. Various regA mutant strains were analyzed in this study. In a RegA deficient strain, activation of puf and puc transcription is severely impaired which consequently leads to the synthesis of only a few photosynthetic complexes. Strains carrying a mutation in the helix-turn-helix domain of RegA or a mutation of the phosphorylation site, Asp 63, show a phenotype like the RegA deficient mutant, although the RegA(D 63 K) mutant protein showed the same DNA binding behavior as the wild type protein. In contrast, the puf and puc mRNAs still reach about 50 - 70 % of the wild type level after reduction of oxygen tension in strains which synthesize the C-terminal RegA activator domain only or a hybrid protein composed of the RegA activator and the FixJ receiver domain, while both mutant proteins are impaired in DNA binding. Our data suggest that phosphorylation is not required for DNA binding but rather plays a role for efficient initiation of transcription...|$|R
40|$|Extrinsic {{mechanical}} signals have been implicated as key regulators of {{mesenchymal stem cell}} (MSC) differentiation. It has been possible to test different hypotheses for mechano-regulated MSC differentiation by attempting to simulate regenerative events such as bone fracture repair, where repeatable spatial and temporal patterns of tissue differentiation occur. More recently, in vitro studies have identified other environmental cues such as substrate stiffness and oxygen <b>tension</b> as key <b>regulators</b> of MSC differentiation; however it remains unclear if and how such cues determine stem cell fate in vivo. As part of this study, a computational model was developed {{to test the hypothesis}} that substrate stiffness and oxygen tension regulate stem cell differentiation during fracture healing. Rather than assuming {{mechanical signals}} act directly on stem cells to determine their differentiation pathway, it is postulated that they act indirectly to regulate angiogenesis and hence partially determine the local oxygen environment within a regenerating tissue. Chondrogenesis of MSCs was hypothesized to occur in low oxygen regions, while in well vascularised regions of the regenerating tissue a soft local substrate was hypothesised to facilitate adipogenesis while a stiff substrate facilitated osteogenesis. Predictions from the model were compared to both experimental data and to predictions of a well established computational mechanobiological model where tissue differentiation is assumed to be regulated directly by the local mechanical environment. The model predicted all the major events of fracture repair, including cartilaginous bridging, endosteal an...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{contributes}} {{to the understanding of}} the economics of two-way interconnection and industrial organisation, through two distinct but related empirical studies. A differentiated Bertrand model of mobile competition for Australian is constructed; considering the interplay between downstream mobile interconnection and upstream retail markets, and is used to measure the impact on total welfare of the regulation of mobile interconnection rates, initially set at 21 cpm. With the theoretical literature providing ambiguous predictions for regulators as to the incentives of firms in setting interconnection rates and consequently retail prices absent regulation, welfare outcomes of regulation have never been empirically tested for Australia; despite requirements to forebear from regulation unless it is likely to improve welfare. Results show the initial choice to regulate improved total welfare by $ 0. 9 M (0. 10 %), consumer welfare by $ 3. 9 M (1. 33 %) and economic profit declined by $ 3 M (- 0. 47 %) million p. m. However, total welfare is found to be maximised at an interconnection rate of 6 cpm; despite current rates being 0. 9 cpm and a policy to reduce interconnection rates to 0 cpm by 2019. A criticism of cost models used to determine rates is their basis on costs of a hypothetical firm and assumed minimum efficient scale (MES) needed for sustainable competition. However, it appears regulators have set MES too ambitiously (low), meaning the interconnection rate faced is based on a scale inefficient cost structure and hence too high. This results in a market distortion via a transfer of interconnection payments from large to small players, sending inefficient entry, expansion and investment signals to firms and thus competing away scare revenues in an already competitive markets. This vicious cycle has been seen globally with multiple consolidations of firms. Presenting a <b>tension</b> for <b>regulators</b> between higher market concentration and welfare; being made worse by possibly inappropriate interconnection policies. As a result the model is extended to a counterfactual merger/duopoly; testing welfare impacts in the Australian mobile market and studying the role mobile interconnection can play in this context. Results under duopoly illustrate an initial regulated rate of 21 cpm improves welfare by $ 685 M p. a., peaking to $ 2. 3 bn p. a. at a 0. 0 cpm rate, with a cumulative economic efficiency improvement over oligopoly of $ 12. 7 bn. Most importantly, and unlike the factual case, total welfare is maximised under duopoly at a 0. 0 cpm rate, aligning regulatory policy outcomes, legislation and market structures most efficiently...|$|R
40|$|Bacteria {{have the}} ability to grow in cell {{communities}} designated biofilms. This mode of growth is widespread and offers numerous advantages to the bacteria in terms of survival, persistence and propagation. Bacteria have developed different ways of building up a biofilm. Complex regulatory mechanisms control this sophisticated mode of growth in response to environmental conditions. This thesis focuses on the regulation of biofilm formation by the food-borne pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and the probiotic strain Escherichia coli Nissle 1917. Commonly, species of the family of Enterobacteriaceae produce the biofilm extracellular matrix components cellulose and curli fimbriae at low temperature. The expression of cellulose and curli is activated by the transcriptional regulator CsgD. In this work, we demonstrated an altered pattern of biofilm regulation in E. coli Nissle 1917 (Paper I). Biogenesis of curli fimbriae was activated by CsgD at low temperature, while cellulose production at 28 °C and 37 °C did not require CsgD nor the di-guanylate cyclase AdrA. Cellulose production was, however, still dependent on the second messenger c-di-GMP. This regulatory pattern of cellulose and curli fimbriae production has been conserved in E. coli Nissle 1917 clonal isolates for more than 80 years implying biological significance. Production of cellulose mediated adhesion of E. coli Nissle 1917 to the gastrointestinal epithelial cell line HT- 29 and to the mouse epithelium in vivo, thus possibly playing a role in colonization of the gut. A characteristic of biofilm formation is cell heterogeneity. In S. typhimurium, expression of the master regulator CsgD was bistable during biofilm development (Paper II). Bistability led to task distribution, whereby the subpopulation of cells, which expressed high amounts of CsgD, was associated with microcolony formation and the production of cellulose. CsgD expression is tightly regulated and responds to a variety of environmental conditions such as nutrient starvation and oxygen <b>tension.</b> Several global <b>regulators</b> contribute directly or indirectly to CsgD regulation. In this work, we identified novel factors involved in the complex CsgD regulation. Two lytic transglycosylases, MltE and MltC redundantly activated CsgD and rdar morphotype expression (Manuscript III). The absence of these two lytic transglycosylases could be partially compensated by the second messenger c-di-GMP. The chaperone Hfq and two Hfq dependent sRNAs, ArcZ and RyeB, also activated rdar morphotype expression by controlling the expression of CsgD (Manuscript IV). We demonstrated that ArcZ is a key regulator of biofilm formation. In addition, ArcZ {{played a role in the}} transition between sessility and motility and was involved in the timing of type 1 versus curli fimbriae surface attachment...|$|R
