5|$|In 1900, {{ownership}} of the gatehouse was transferred from Henry Somerset, 9th Duke of Beaufort to Monmouthshire County Council {{as part of the}} disposal of the entirety of the Somersets' land holdings in Monmouthshire. The gift is recorded on a brass plaque attached to the gatehouse. The local antiquarian Mary Ellen Bagnall-Oakeley wrote the first history of the bridge and gatehouse, Monnow Bridge Tower, which appeared in 1903. In April 1893, the first street light had been erected on the bridge by the town council. In the late 1920s, the <b>top</b> <b>portion</b> of this light was replaced by twin electric lamps. In the 1960s, the lamps were removed completely, and since 1991 the bridge has been floodlit.|$|E
5|$|Itzam K'an Ahk II {{constructed}} {{at least}} five known stelae: 9, 10, 11, 22, and 40. Stelae 9, 10, and 11 were all erected in front of or near Structure J-3. Stela 11, which was erected in August of 731 AD, is of the niche variety, meaning it depicts the ruler seated in a small hollow, or niche, and it was erected to commemorate the accession {{of the individual to}} the position of ajaw. The monument shows the ajaw flanked by subjects, witnesses to the ceremonies explored {{on the face of the}} stela. The expanse in front of the stone slab is designated as a space for offerings, denoted by the depiction of a sacrificed human near the bottom of the monument. The monument was discovered by Teoberto Maler in two pieces on the ground; the front was in good condition, and some pigment was still visible. The glyphs on the upper right have been weathered, but the sides are largely intact. In the 1960s, looters cut the fallen monument into two halves for easier removal. The <b>top</b> <b>portion</b> is currently housed in the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston, Texas, whereas the bottom half is in a private collection in Switzerland.|$|E
5|$|Like Probactrosaurus {{and other}} hadrosauroids, {{the back of}} the maxilla connects to the jugal – which borders the bottom of the eye socket and infratemporal fenestra – through a finger-like {{projection}} that fits into a recess. The bottom margin of the jugal bears a strong flange beneath the level of the infratemporal fenestra; this is also seen in Equijubus, Probactrosaurus, Protohadros, and several other hadrosauroids. Connecting to the jugal from above is the postorbital, which has a roughened surface where it borders the eye sockets (like Protohadros), but the side of the bone is otherwise smooth. At {{the back of the}} skull, the quadrate articulates with the squamosal with a joint that is D-shaped when viewed from the top. The left and right squamosals would have contacted each other extensively, being only separated at the back by a small process of the parietal. The supraoccipital bone, which forms the <b>top</b> <b>portion</b> {{of the back of the}} skull, is flat and nearly vertical, as is the case in Probactrosaurus and other hadrosauroids.|$|E

5|$|Each forelimb of {{the horse}} runs from the scapula or {{shoulder}} blade to the navicular bone. In between are the humerus (arm), radius (forearm), elbow joint, ulna (elbow), carpus (knee) bones and joint, large metacarpal (cannon), small metacarpal (splint), sesamoid, fetlock joint, first phalanx (long pastern), pastern joint, second phalanx (short pastern), coffin joint, outwardly evidenced by the coronary band, and the third phalanx (coffin or pedal) bones. Each hind limb {{of the horse}} runs from the pelvis to the navicular bone. After the pelvis come the femur (thigh), patella, stifle joint, tibia, fibula, tarsal (hock) bone and joint, large metatarsal (cannon) and small metatarsal (splint) bones. Below these, the arrangement of sesamoid and phalanx bones and joints {{is the same as}} in the forelimbs. When the horse is moving, the distal interphalangeal joint (coffin joint) has the highest amount of stresses applied to it of any joint in the body, and it can be significantly affected by trimming and shoeing techniques. Although having a small range of movement, the proximal interphalangeal joint (pastern joint) is also influential to the movement of the horse, and can change the way that various shoeing techniques affect tendons and ligaments in the legs. Due to the horse's development as a cursorial animal (one whose main form of defense is running), its bones evolved to facilitate speed in a forward direction over hard ground, without the need for grasping, lifting or swinging. The ulna shrank in size and its <b>top</b> <b>portion</b> became the point of the elbow, while the bottom fused with the radius above the radiocarpal (knee) joint, which corresponds to the wrist in humans. A similar change occurred in the fibula bone of the hind limbs. These changes were first seen in the genus Merychippus, approximately 17 million years ago.|$|E

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of the hot oil treatment process on 15 year old cultivated Acacia hybrid was studied. Accelerated laboratory durability studies were conducted on the hot oil treated Acacia hybrid inoculated with fungi Coriolus versicolors, Gloeophyllum trabeum and Pycnoporus sanguineus. The logs of Acacia hybrid were harvested, segregated into bottom, middle and <b>top</b> <b>portions,</b> and later were oil-heat treated in an organic palm oil at temperatures of 180, 200 and 220 °C {{for the duration of}} 30, 60 and 90 min. The wood samples that were dried and ground into sawdust was air-dried again before undergoing accelerated laboratory durability tests. Untreated samples were used as control. The durability of the wood increases with an increase in temperature and duration of the treatment. The hot oil treated samples could reduce the attack of G. trabeum from 20. 89 %, 20. 94 % and 21. 29 % in the control samples to 0. 88 - 4. 07 %, 1. 22 - 4. 84 % and 1. 28 - 4. 22 % at bottom, middle and <b>top</b> <b>portions,</b> respectively. The attack of C. versicolors were reduced from 26. 59 %, 30. 28 % and 34. 79 % in the control samples to 2. 89 - 9. 41 %, 3. 88 - 16. 84 and 4. 27 - 17. 34 % at bottom, middle and <b>top</b> <b>portions.</b> However, the attacked of P. sanguineus were least effective with 31. 42 %, 36. 33 % and 36. 55 % in control samples to 3. 26 - 12. 55 %, 4. 67 - 15. 36 % and 4. 69 - 19. 22 % at bottom, middle and <b>top</b> <b>portions.</b> Massive colonization of mycelia occurs in vessels of the untreated Acacia hybrid wood in comparison to the hot oil treated wood when observed through scanning electron microscope...|$|R

25|$|Curiously, Xingxiulong {{has many}} {{characteristics}} that are normally otherwise seen among the Sauropoda. These include the four-vertebra sacrum (which Mussaurus also convergently acquired); the long pubic plate, or <b>top</b> <b>portion</b> of the pubis, which occupies 40% {{of the length}} of the bone (this figure is 25% in most other basal sauropodomorphs, 33% in most sauropods, and 45-50% in the Camarasauromorpha); and the relative robustness of the femoral shaft, first metatarsal, top end of the fifth metatarsal, and scapula. These unique characteristics are probably the product of convergent evolution rather than common ancestry.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, Newfoundland used the Union Flag as its provincial flag from 1952 until 1980; the blue triangles {{on the new}} flag adopted in 1980 are meant {{as a tribute to}} the Union Flag. British Columbia's flag, which {{features}} the Union Flag in its <b>top</b> <b>portion,</b> was introduced in 1960 and is actually based on the shield of the provincial coat of arms, which dates back to 1906. Hence, both Newfoundland's use of the Union Flag and the adoption of BC's flag are unrelated to (and, in fact, pre-date) the great flag debate.|$|E

30|$|In January, {{the trend}} of the {{endogenous}} soluble sugar content was shown {{in the order of}} top < middle < bottom in 1 -year-old culms (4  months), while in 2 - and 3 -year-old culms it showed the opposite trend, i.e., top > middle > bottom, which was caused by the leaf photosynthesis of the 2 - and 3 -year-old culms. However, 1 -year-old culms had no branches and leaves and their endogenous soluble sugar storage mainly depended on their mother bamboos, so they showed {{the trend of}} top < middle < bottom. The same trend in the culms of all ages in May is due to their extensive branching and leafing in <b>top</b> <b>portions</b> that consumed large amounts of sugar. When in August and November, all culms had sprouted plenty of branches and leaves in <b>top</b> <b>portions</b> and plenty of photoassimilates were produced and mainly supplied to the development and growth of shoot buds and shoots. Therefore, the trend of endogenous soluble sugar was shown as top > middle > bottom. The endogenous soluble sugar content in culms depended on the bamboo phenology.|$|R
25|$|The {{first of}} eight {{prototype}} Seirans {{was completed in}} October 1943, commencing flight testing in November that year. A problem with overbalance of the auxiliary wings was eventually solved by raising {{the height of the}} tail fin. Further testing was sufficiently successful for production to start in early 1944. In order to aid pilot conversion to the Seiran, two examples of a land based trainer version fitted with a retractable undercarriage were built. These were given the designation M6A1-K Nanzan ("Southern Mountain"). Besides the difference in landing gear, the vertical stabilizer's <b>top</b> <b>portion,</b> which was foldable on the Seiran, was removed.|$|E
25|$|Because {{strontium}} titanate {{and glass}} are too soft to survive {{use as a}} ring stone, they {{have been used in}} the construction of composite or doublet diamond simulants. The two materials are used for the bottom portion (pavilion) of the stone, {{and in the case of}} strontium titanate, a much harder material—usually colorless synthetic spinel or sapphire—is used for the top half (crown). In glass doublets, the <b>top</b> <b>portion</b> is made of almandine garnet; it is usually a very thin slice which does not modify the stone's overall body color. There have even been reports of diamond-on-diamond doublets, where a creative entrepreneur has used two small pieces of rough to create one larger stone.|$|E
25|$|On the CDMA {{version of}} the phone there are four slits in the metal band. Two at the top (on the left and right) and two at the bottom. This divides the metal band into four {{different}} segments, which like the GSM {{version of the}} phone, serves as different antennas for connectivity. The <b>top</b> <b>portion</b> of the band (divided by the top left and right slits) is for connecting to the CDMA network. The left portion of the metal band is for Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and GPS just like the GSM version. The right side is not an antenna, but serves to cosmetically mirror the left side and also to create a similar look to the GSM version of the phone.|$|E

25|$|After {{analyzing}} {{hundreds of}} designs, and finally {{coming up with}} what {{was believed to be}} the best design, Bostich finally released the nail in 2005 and labeled it the Sheather Plus. Even though the new nail was stronger than most nails, the barbs, which added the much needed strength to the nail's holding power, weakened the strength of the joint by opening the hole too far. This caused the joint to be sloppy and wobbly, so the team went {{back to the drawing board}} where the final feature was added to the nail. To compensate for the extra width of the nail hole, due to the ring shanks, Sutt decided to add a thicker screw-shank to the portion of the nail directly under the head. This addition thickened the <b>top</b> <b>portion</b> of the nail giving it a tighter joint, as well as enhancing its overall holding power.|$|E
25|$|A {{suspended}} Slinky's {{centre of}} mass is accelerating downward at 16 feet per second (i.e. g); when released - the lower portion moves up toward the <b>top</b> <b>portion</b> with an equivalent, constant upward acceleration as the tension is relieved. As the spring contracts, every point along its length will accelerate downward with gravity and tension, and experience a decrease in overall downward acceleration related to height along the spring due to the spring force changing with extension- {{at the bottom of}} the spring the upward initial acceleration reduces in accordance with Hooke's law as the spring contracts, but the centre toward which it is moving gets closer- meaning the base will have been displaced sufficiently toward the centre of inertial mass for it to appear to have hung still. Should this phenomenology extend to very light strings with heavy suspended masses (which have approximately linear tension distributions), different mathematics would be needed to explain the phenomenon.|$|E
25|$|Movement {{of fluid}} in the semicircular canals signals the brain about the {{direction}} and speed of rotation of the head – for example, whether we are nodding our head up and down or looking from right to left. Each semicircular canal has a bulbed end, or enlarged portion, that contains hair cells. Rotation of the head causes a flow of fluid, which in turn causes displacement of the <b>top</b> <b>portion</b> of the hair cells that are embedded in the jelly-like cupula. Two other organs {{that are part of}} the vestibular system are the utricle and saccule. These are called the otolithic organs and are responsible for detecting linear acceleration, or movement in a straight line. The hair cells of the otolithic organs are blanketed with a jelly-like layer studded with tiny calcium stones called otoconia. When the head is tilted or the body position is changed with respect to gravity, the displacement of the stones causes the hair cells to bend.|$|E

The second person shown is that of Prosperity, who holds a wheat sheaf and a sicle, and, next to him, is Progress, bearing a winged wheel and with the Lamp of Knowledge above his head. The fourth figure is Plenty, symbolising the {{replenishment}} of both material and spirit through noble pursuit. Arranged in the lower portion of the window is a crowd of people assembled in peace and led by three figures in the foreground and bearing the symbols of their trades: Industry holds a mallet and dynamo, Agriculture bears a scythe, Honour carries a torch inscribed with words from John McCrae's poem In Flanders Fields: BE THE TORCH YOURS TO HOLD IT HIGH, and Motherhood, who is surrounded by children.

500|$|There are {{a variety}} of {{techniques}} for measuring this parameter that can potentially yield different results because different things are actually being measured. [...] Away from the immediate sea surface, general temperature measurements are accompanied by a reference to the specific depth of measurement. [...] This is because of significant differences encountered between measurements made at different depths, especially during the daytime when low wind speed and high sunshine conditions may lead to the formation of a warm layer at the ocean's surface and strong vertical temperature gradients (a diurnal thermocline). [...] Sea surface temperature measurements are confined to the <b>top</b> <b>portion</b> of the ocean, known as the near-surface layer.|$|E
500|$|The gills {{are white}} to cream colored, and fairly crowded together; they are mostly free from {{attachment}} to the stipe. Gills are interconnected at their bases by veins.

The <b>top</b> <b>portion</b> of the stipe may be farinose—covered with a white, mealy powder. It may turn slightly brown with age, or when it is injured or bruised from handling. Like other mushrooms in the Russulales, the flesh is brittle, owing to the sphaerocyst cytoarchitecture—cylindrical cells that contrast with the typical fibrous, filamentous hyphae present in other orders of the basidiomycota.|$|E
