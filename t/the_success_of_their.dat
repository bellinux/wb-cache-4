5|$|Despite <b>the</b> <b>success</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> fifth album, the duo Simon & Garfunkel {{decided to}} part company, announcing their {{break-up}} later that year. They have nonetheless {{made a number}} of reunion performances, including a free concert in New York City's Central Park in 1981, which drew a crowd of half-a-million people and resulted in the live album The Concert in Central Park.|$|E
5|$|The Guidance on State Implementation Plan Credits for Emissions Reductions from Electric-Sector Energy Efficiency or Renewable Energy Measures is an {{educational}} tool {{for states to}} create an up-to-date and well-organized SIP.

50|$|The Old Girls' and Old Boys' Association is a {{thriving}} global community. The Association organises regular reunions and events, keeps former pupils informed of current {{events at the}} school and <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>successes</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> peers, and often invites Old Boys and Old Girls back to the school to share their expertise and life experiences with current pupils.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>success</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> third album, Tragic Kingdom, {{led to an}} {{interest}} by fans in the band's earlier albums, No Doubt and The Beacon Street Collection, and many more copies of them were manufactured and sold. The Beacon Street Collection was re-released in October 1997 {{as part of the}} band's back catalog and, by the summer of 1997, No Doubt had sold 250,000 copies.|$|E
5|$|After McCoy {{told them}} they were the Miami Showband, Thomas Crozier (who had a notebook) asked the band members for their names and addresses, while the others bantered with them about <b>the</b> <b>success</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> {{performance}} that night. As Crozier took down the information, a car pulled up and another uniformed man appeared on the scene. He wore a uniform and beret noticeably different from the others. He spoke with an educated English accent and immediately took charge, ordering a man who {{appeared to have been}} the leader of the patrol, to tell Crozier to obtain their names and dates of birth instead of addresses.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{reception}} to Dynamite Headdy was positive. Critics {{highlighted the}} game's originality and creativity in distinguishing it among other {{games in the}} action-platform genre. They also commended Treasure for demonstrating their technical expertise with impressive graphical effects and building on <b>the</b> <b>success</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> earlier game Gunstar Heroes (1993). In reviews from the time and in retrospect, Dynamite Headdy is cited for {{being one of the}} best games on the Genesis. An 8-bit port was released for Game Gear, which itself served as the basis for a Master System port released exclusively in Brazil.|$|E

50|$|Folk Music is {{the seventh}} studio album by English {{acoustic}} roots duo Show <b>of</b> Hands. After <b>the</b> <b>successes</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> 1996 Royal Albert Hall performance and their subsequent album Dark Fields (1997), the duo decided {{to record a}} limited edition album featuring the duo's renditions of traditional folk music. It was recorded in September 1998 as a project to connect the band to their roots.|$|R
5000|$|Some far-right {{critics argue}} that neo-Nazis joining the national-anarchist {{movement}} will lead to them losing credit for <b>the</b> <b>successes</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> [...] "anti-Zionist" [...] struggle if it is co-opted by left-wing anarchists. They further argue that national-anarchists want the militant chic of calling themselves [...] "anarchists" [...] without the historical and philosophical baggage that accompanies such a claim, such as the link with 19th-century Jewish anarchists.|$|R
5|$|Following on from <b>the</b> <b>success</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> debut album, they {{released}} Talk on Corners and In Blue in 1997 and 2000 respectively. Originally Talk on Corners met with lukewarm success, until a remix version was released, when it topped the charts in many countries, and reached platinum {{status in the}} United Kingdom and Australia. In Blue moved towards mainstream pop, placing heavy emphasis on electronic synthesisers. It was successful, and was No. 1 in its first sales week in the UK, Ireland, Australia, Germany, Switzerland, and Austria and debuted at No. 2 in France and Norway. It {{climbed to the top}} position during its second week in Sweden and Spain.|$|E
5|$|Following <b>the</b> <b>success</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> {{debut album}} Robbers & Cowards and {{spending}} {{the rest of}} 2007 touring across North America and Europe, the band started recording new material for their next album {{over the course of}} four months. Taking its title from the paper of the same name by American philosopher Josiah Royce, Loyalty to Loyalty carries a darker tone than its previous album by having a more experimental sound throughout and songs that deal with philosophies and politics, including suicide, crisis of faith, public security and job satisfaction.|$|E
5|$|Historian Nancy Bristow {{has argued}} that the pandemic, when {{combined}} with the increasing number of women attending college, contributed to the success of women in the field of nursing. This was {{due in part to the}} failure of medical doctors, who were predominantly men, to contain and prevent the illness. Nursing staff, who were predominantly women, felt more inclined to celebrate <b>the</b> <b>success</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> patient care and less inclined to identify the spread of the disease with their own work.|$|E

5|$|In May 1981, Paramount Pictures {{acquired}} the film rights, with Stigwood attached as a producer. Paramount allocated {{a budget of}} $15 million, and the film was scheduled to go into production by year-end. To avoid higher production costs, Stigwood, Rice and Lloyd Webber each agreed to take a smaller salary but {{a higher percentage of}} the film's gross. Stigwood hired Ken Russell to direct the film, based on <b>the</b> <b>success</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> previous collaboration, Tommy (1975).|$|E
5|$|Since its release, Kadhalikka Neramillai has {{developed}} a cult status in Tamil cinema. It has been hailed as a trendsetting comedy, and the film is said to kindle a feeling of joie de vivre. The film's comedy sequences are regarded as evergreen. <b>The</b> <b>success</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> on-screen pairing led Nagesh and Sachu to act together in films such as Motor Sundaram Pillai (1966), Galatta Kalyanam (1968), Sivandha Mann (1969) Sumathi En Sundari (1971) and Urimai Kural (1974). According to The News Today, Kadhalikka Neramillai also popularised the romantic comedy genre.|$|E
5|$|After {{receiving}} Virginia Tech's kickoff, the California offense {{returned to}} the field. The Bears were unable to repeat <b>the</b> <b>success</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> first drive and went three and out, punting the ball back to Virginia Tech. The Hokies recovered the ball at their 43-yard line and moved quickly. Bryan Randall completed a 53-yard pass to receiver Chris Shreve. Two plays later, Randall completed a three-yard touchdown pass that gave the Hokies a 14–7 lead with 2:40 remaining in the quarter. California received the ball after the touchdown, but again went three and out. As before, the Hokies struck quickly. After starting from the California 49-yard line, it took one play for Virginia Tech to score. Randall completed a long pass to quarterback Marcus Vick, {{who came into the}} game as a wide receiver. The score and extra point made the game 21–7 with 50seconds left in the quarter. California received the kickoff and ran three quick plays {{before the end of the}} quarter. As time expired, California faced a fourth down and nine yards from their 36-yard line and was preparing to punt. With one quarter elapsed, Virginia Tech led, 21–7.|$|E

50|$|Following <b>the</b> <b>successes</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> earlier comic operas, The Emerald Isle and Merrie England, Basil Hood and Edward German collaborated once more. Despite a good {{reception}} from {{critics and}} Savoy opera devotees, the opera achieved {{a run of}} only 115 performances, owing partly to its dense plot and unwieldy libretto, and partly to the continued decline of comic operas in favour of George Edwardes-style musical comedies as the London theatregoing public's choice entertainment.|$|R

5|$|Although Beebe {{attempted}} {{to ensure that}} Barton would receive credit as the Bathysphere's inventor and Beebe's fellow diver, the popular media tended to ignore Barton and pay attention only to Beebe. Barton was often resentful of this, believing Beebe to be deliberately hogging the fame. Beebe in turn lacked patience for Barton's unpredictable moods, and felt that Barton did not display the proper respect for the natural world. Still, Beebe and Barton both had something the other needed: Beebe for {{his experience as a}} marine biologist, and Barton for his mechanical skill. Out of pragmatic concern for <b>the</b> <b>success</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> dives, they managed to resolve their disagreements well enough to work together at Nonsuch Island, although they did not remain on good terms afterwards.|$|E
5|$|Each team {{received}} a bye {{to the third}} round of the tournament, and then progressed through five rounds before reaching the final. Arsenal were in a successful phase, with this final following recent First Division titles, while Sheffield United were attempting to emulate <b>the</b> <b>success</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> rivals Sheffield Wednesday in the tournament the year before. A closely fought first half was followed by a dominant second half by Arsenal, who won by a single goal, scored by Ted Drake in the 74th minute. A media ban by the stadium's bosses caused reporters to fly above the stadium in autogyros to see the match and the BBC experimented with sports commentators for the first time during its live broadcast of the final.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1980s, {{following}} <b>the</b> <b>success</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> isometric Filmation game engine behind {{titles like}} Knight Lore, the Stampers founded a separate company: Rare Designs of the Future, later shortened to Rare. While Ultimate {{was built for}} the British home microcomputer market, Rare was founded {{with an eye toward}} the burgeoning Japanese video game console market, having been apprised of Nintendo by their Japanese arcade industry contacts. Nintendo initially rebuffed the brothers' interest in 1983, which led Chris Stamper to study the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) hardware for six months. The brothers flew to Kyoto to present software samples to Nintendo executives. Nintendo purchased the Stampers' Slalom, which sold half a million units, and made the Stampers into Nintendo's first Western third-party developer. As interest in Filmation and the Spectrum began to wane, the brothers sold part of Ultimate to U.S. Gold and began to focus on Rare, though the Stampers retained a majority stake in Ultimate.|$|E

50|$|The {{film was}} {{entered into the}} 1983 Cannes Film Festival.It was an art house hit in Europe, {{particularly}} in England. It fared poorly in the United States where the film had distribution problems. As a whole, Heat and Dust was Merchant Ivory's biggest commercial success up to that date. It marked {{a turning point for}} the company heralding <b>the</b> <b>successes</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> subsequent films: A Room with a View (1985), Howards End (1992) and The Remains of the Day (1993).|$|R

In early 1985, the first movie based on the toy line turned the company's fortunes around, grossing $23million in the US, and another $1.5million in its native Canada. Its tremendous success gave way to two more big-screen movies, [...] and Adventure in Wonderland, as well as a television series.|$|R
5|$|Iowa is {{the second}} studio album by the American heavy metal band Slipknot. Released by Roadrunner Records on August 28, 2001, it was {{produced}} by Ross Robinson and Slipknot. The title derives from the band's home state, Iowa, which members have stated {{is one of their}} greatest sources of inspiration. With much anticipation for the band's second album following on <b>the</b> <b>success</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> 1999 self-titled debut, pressures on the band were high. Their relationships with each other suffered and was later described as the darkest time of their career. It was also the first time that guitarist Jim Root had been significantly involved in a Slipknot album as Root was only featured on two songs from their debut album, due to his joining very late in recording of that release. Despite troubles within the band and with Iowas development, Slipknot promoted it for almost a year.|$|E

The old man tells Jason that <b>the</b> <b>success</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> research made time travel possible, but also plunged the world into chaos. Jason lunges at the old man, choking him. Wrapping his arms around his younger self, the old man bursts into flames, and the fire consumes them both. Later, Lisa sets to work at the cryonics lab, attempting to reconstruct the chemical compound.|$|E
5|$|Morris' {{influence}} on Britain's artistic community became increasingly apparent as the Art Workers' Guild {{was founded in}} 1884, although {{at the time he}} was too preoccupied with his socialist activism to pay it any attention. Although the proposal faced some opposition, Morris would be elected to the Guild in 1888, and was elected to the position of master in 1892. Morris similarly did not offer initial support for the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society, but changed his opinion after <b>the</b> <b>success</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> first exhibit, held in Regents Street in October 1888. Giving lectures on tapestries for the group, in 1892 he would be elected president. At this time, Morris also re-focused his attentions on SPAB campaigning; those causes he championed including the preservation of St. Mary's Church in Oxford, Blythburgh Church in Suffolk, Peterborough Cathedral, and Rouen Cathedral.|$|E
50|$|The {{principle}} is considered essential, {{as it is}} seen to guarantee that an elected official is answerable for every single government decision. It {{is also important to}} motivate ministers to closely scrutinize the activities within their departments. One rule coming from this {{principle is}} that each cabinet member answers for their own ministry in parliament's question time. The reverse of ministerial responsibility is that civil servants are not supposed to take credit for <b>the</b> <b>successes</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> department, allowing <b>the</b> government to claim them.|$|R

The story, {{recorded}} in Isidore, that Hermeric sent Rechila to Baetica to defeat Andevotus, Romanae militiae dux, is false, as there is no contemporary evidence that Hermeric retained any authority after his abdication. There appears to have been no principle of elective monarchy among the Suevi and <b>the</b> <b>successes</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> raids may have accounted for the contentment <b>of</b> <b>their</b> people.
