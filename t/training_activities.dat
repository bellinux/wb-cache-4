5|$|The Army is {{organised}} into three main elements which {{report to the}} Chief of Army; the Headquarters of the 1st Division, Special Operations Command and Forces Command. Headquarters 1st Division is responsible for high-level <b>training</b> <b>activities</b> and is capable of being deployed to command large scale ground operations. It {{does not have any}} combat units permanently assigned to it, though it commands units during <b>training</b> <b>activities</b> and the Land Combat Readiness Centre reports to the divisional headquarters. Most of the Army's units report to Forces Command, which is responsible for overseeing their readiness and preparing them for operations. This organisation came into effect during January 2011; before this time the Army's three regular brigades were permanently assigned to the Headquarters 1st Division.|$|E

Regular deployments are made to Singapore and RMAF Butterworth in Malaysia as part of Integrated Air Defence System exercises. In addition, RAAF F/A-18s have participated in exercises in the Philippines, Thailand and the United States. These deployments have seen Australian fighter squadrons range as far afield as Eielson Air Force Base in Alaska, where they took part in Red Flag – Alaska exercises in 2008 and 2011.|$|E
5|$|In August 2011, {{as part of}} the European Union Training Mission Somalia (EUTM Somalia), 900 Somali {{soldiers}} {{graduated from}} the Bihanga Military Training School in the Ibanda District of Uganda. 150 personnel from the EU took part in the training process, which trained around 2,000 Somali troops per year. In May 2012, 603 Somali army personnel completed training at the facility. They were the third batch of Somali nationals to be trained there under the auspices of EUTM Somalia. In total, the EU mission had trained 3,600 Somali soldiers, before permanently transferring all of its advisory, mentoring and <b>training</b> <b>activities</b> to Mogadishu in December 2013.|$|E
5|$|Four RAAF units {{converted}} to the Hornet between 1985 and 1988. The first 14 Hornets were allocated to No. 2 Operational Conversion Unit (2OCU) at RAAF Base Williamtown, and {{were used to}} train the pilots and instructors needed to convert the RAAF's three fighter squadrons to the aircraft. 2OCU's first Hornet operational conversion course began on 19 August 1985. In addition to the unit's <b>training</b> <b>activities,</b> 2OCU aircraft travelled widely around Australia and South East Asia during 1985 and 1986 to showcase the new aircraft. No.3 Squadron was the first fighter unit to convert from the MirageIII, and became operational with the Hornet in August 1986. It was followed by No.77 Squadron in June 1987 and No.75 Squadron in May 1988. No.81 Wing, whose headquarters is located at Williamtown, has commanded these four units since they {{converted to}} the F/A-18. As of 2012, 2OCU, No.3 and No.77 Squadrons are stationed at Williamtown and No.75 Squadron is located at Tindal. In addition, two Hornets are allocated to the Aircraft Research and Development Unit at RAAF Base Edinburgh in South Australia.|$|E
5000|$|In 1946, the Royal Netherlands Air Force (RNLAF) resumed {{operations}} {{from the}} airfield, {{using it as}} a training base for pilots and air traffic controllers. In 1962, <b>training</b> <b>activity</b> was suspended, and Gilze-Rijen was reduced to a reserve base for bomber aircraft. <b>Training</b> <b>activity</b> was resumed in 1967 however. In 1971, the <b>training</b> <b>activity</b> was suspended again when a fighter squadron was moved to the airfield, which also included a significant upgrade of airport facilities. Initially the Northrop NF-5A/B, and later its replacement, the General Dynamics F-16A/B Fighting Falcon, were operated from the base up until 1995. It has 30 Hardened Aircraft Shelters (HAS).|$|R
40|$|Analysing {{data from}} the 1998 Workplace Employee Relations Survey we {{establish}} {{the extent to which}} levels of <b>training</b> <b>activity</b> in Britain are lower in SMEs than in larger firms. The antecedents of <b>training</b> <b>activity</b> within the SME sector are examined in terms of the workplace characteristics that are associated with high or low levels of training. Both managers and non-managers receive less training in SMEs compared with larger organizations. Training in the SME sector is associated with larger SMEs, multi-site SMEs, franchises, the presence of a personnel/HR specialist and multiple memberships of business advisory networks. Neither Investors in People nor trade union recognition are associated with greater <b>training</b> <b>activity.</b> The implications of the findings for government policy regarding training in SMEs are discussed...|$|R

5|$|Perfect Dark is a first-person shooter {{in which}} players control Carrington Institute agent Joanna Dark {{through a series}} of levels {{collected}} together into missions. The general gameplay {{is similar to that of}} its predecessor GoldenEye 007, with features such as stealth sections and objectives determined by difficulty settings carried over. Players can crouch, duck, lean, and drop from most ledges, but there is no jump ability. A number of tutorials and <b>training</b> <b>activities</b> can be taken at the Carrington Institute, which acts as the game's central hub. The Nintendo 64 Expansion Pak is needed to access the game's campaign and most of the multiplayer features, although a limited subset of the Combat Simulator options are available without the device; around 35% of the game is playable without an Expansion Pak, as estimated on the game's box and Instruction Booklet.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Citizen Forces {{deteriorated}} {{during the}} war as the AIF was given precedence for manpower and other resources. While {{the size of the}} force increased during 1915, a high proportion volunteered for overseas service with the AIF. Many officers were used to train AIF recruits, and camp facilities and equipment were also assigned to the expeditionary force. This greatly disrupted the Citizen Forces <b>training</b> <b>activities,</b> with few units conducting camps during late 1915 or 1916. While there were intakes of conscripts to the Citizen Forces during 1916 and 1917, few were ever required to undertake periods of training or active service. In October 1916 approximately 37,000 reservists were called up {{for a short period of}} compulsory training ahead of the first plebiscite on conscription. By 1918 the Citizen Forces were close to collapse as many of its best members had transferred to the AIF and the remaining personnel were largely untrained. Attempts were made to revive the Citizen Forces during the last months of the war. The initially successful German Spring Offensive, which began in March, led to concerns Japan could attack Australia. In response, regular training camps for militia units were reinstated. A scheme to set up a reserve force manned by returned AIF veterans attracted 17,000 volunteers, yet they received no training.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{years were}} {{busy with the}} unit {{creating}} a structure and recruiting members suitable for commando training, while conducting sub-unit and unit <b>training</b> <b>activities.</b> B Company was raised in 1997, followed by C Company in 1999, both of which took 24 months to reach full maturity. A small team from 4 RAR (Cdo) deployed to East Timor {{as part of the}} International Force for East Timor (INTERFET) in September 1999 providing close personal protection for the media and also as interpreters in the initial months. In 2000, elements were involved in the evacuation of Australian nationals from the Solomon Islands in June. While later that year, 4 RAR (Cdo) assisted with counter-terrorism at the Sydney Olympic Games as part of Joint Task Force 114, with C Company on standby as a response force such as providing a cordon around an incident site in support of the SASR. In 2000, it was decided that the counter terrorist role should remain with the SASR. A period of rapid capability development, equipment acquisition and training subsequently followed. The unit that was developed as a result is highly regarded by coalition special operation forces abroad, and has conducted operations in East Timor, Iraq and Afghanistan. It has also been awarded a number of citations for bravery and meritorious service.|$|E
