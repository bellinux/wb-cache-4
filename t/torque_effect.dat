25|$|Some test Spitfire XIVs, 21s, and 24s were {{fitted with}} {{contra-rotating}} propellers, which eliminated the <b>torque</b> <b>effect.</b> Early {{problems with the}} complex gearbox that was required for contra-rotating propellers prevented them from ever becoming operational in Spitfires, but they were used on later aircraft, including the Seafire FR. Mk 46 and F and FR.47, which were fitted with Griffon 87s driving contra-rotating propellers as standard equipment. The Griffon 57 and 57A series, installed in Universal Power Plant (UPP) installations and driving contra-rotating propellers, {{was used in the}} Avro Shackleton maritime patrol aircraft.|$|E
50|$|In helicopters, {{the result}} of the <b>torque</b> <b>effect</b> is a {{tendency}} of the main rotor to want to turn the fuselage in the opposite direction from the rotor. A small tail rotor is the most common configuration to counter the <b>torque</b> <b>effect.</b>|$|E
50|$|The X³ {{demonstrator}} {{is based}} on the Eurocopter AS365 Dauphin helicopter, with the addition of short span wings each fitted with a tractor propeller, having different pitch to counter the <b>torque</b> <b>effect</b> of the main rotor. Conventional helicopters use tail rotors to counter the <b>torque</b> <b>effect.</b> The tractor propellers are gear driven from the two main turboshaft engines which also drive the five-bladed main rotor system, taken from an Eurocopter EC155.|$|E

50|$|The {{propeller}} {{system was}} designed for ultralight trikes and powered parachutes. The latter are especially sensitive to <b>torque</b> <b>effects</b> and the propeller design addresses that issue.|$|R
50|$|The Seafang was {{essentially}} a Spiteful redesigned for Royal Navy carrier use, {{with the addition of}} an arrester hook, a contra-rotating propeller to eliminate engine <b>torque</b> <b>effects,</b> and power folding outer wing panels.|$|R

50|$|In a single-propeller plane, {{the result}} of the <b>torque</b> <b>effect</b> is a {{tendency}} of the plane to want to turn upwards and left in response to the propeller wanting to turn (bank) the plane in the opposite direction of the propeller spin.|$|E
50|$|The {{design that}} Igor Sikorsky settled on for his VS-300 was a smaller tail rotor. The tail rotor pushes or pulls against the tail {{to counter the}} <b>torque</b> <b>effect,</b> and this {{has become the most}} common {{configuration}} for helicopter design, usually {{at the end of a}} tail boom.|$|E
50|$|The Coax-P was {{designed}} by Hans Neudorfer of NeuraJet and Herbert Hofbauer of Sun Flightcraft. The propeller increases thrust by 15-20% over single propellers and reduces noise levels, especially low frequency noise, while eliminating <b>torque</b> <b>effects.</b>|$|R
40|$|THESIS 8867 Current-induced spin-transfer <b>torque</b> <b>effects</b> form an {{exciting}} branch {{in the field}} of spintronics with a huge potential for applications. Magnetization dynamics phenomena like switching or GHz frequency precession in spin valves, enhanced Gilbert damping, etc. are all generated by spin-polarized currents in nano-scale structures. Also in a close proximity to technological applications is the held of molecular spintronics where the quantum properties of molecules trapped in constrictions can be utilized to control spin-currents and even engineer spin logic-elements. In order to investigate theoretically spin-transfer <b>torque</b> <b>effects</b> in atomic-scale conductors in this Thesis we develop a combined microscopic description of the magnetization dynamics together with the open-boundary quantum transport of the itinerant electrons...|$|R
5000|$|A {{problem with}} the supply of the As 8 engine forced a re-design to use one [...] engine, {{powering}} two rotors on a common co-axial shaft, with the engine driving one rotor directly and the other through gearing to overcome the <b>torque</b> <b>effects.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Power {{assisted}} steering (set on {{most modern}} cars) make the torque steer effect less noticeable to the driver. Steer-by-wire also hides {{the effect of}} torque steer from the driver. EPAS can be calibrated to directly suppress the <b>torque</b> <b>effect</b> at the handwheel, and the steer effect on the vehicle.|$|E
50|$|The Mark 1 had a {{tendency}} to roll, affecting its directional stability. This was remedied by Navy Lieutenant Gregory C. Davison who proposed a two-stage turbine design that drove contra-rotating propellers. This cancelled the <b>torque</b> <b>effect</b> of the single-stage design, improving directional stability. All Bliss-Leavitt variants after the Mark 1 would carry this design feature.|$|E
50|$|The Gyroplane No.I {{was one of}} the {{earliest}} attempts to create a practical rotary-wing aircraft. It was designed by the Breguet brothers with help from Professor Charles Richet. The aircraft had an uncovered open steel framework with a seat for the pilot and a powerplant at the centre. Radiating from the central structure were four wire-braced tubular steel arms, each bearing a superimposed pair of four-bladed rotors. To eliminate the <b>torque</b> <b>effect,</b> two rotor sets were driven clockwise and two counter-clockwise.|$|E
50|$|SNAS {{produced}} {{a line of}} powered parachutes under the Stryke-Air brand. These included the Stryke-Air Bi and the Stryke-Air Monoplace. Their aircraft designs were noted for their fixed fin to reduce propeller <b>torque</b> <b>effects</b> and also for seating the pilot behind the passenger on their two-place aircraft.|$|R

40|$|The {{fabrication}} of nanopillar devices has been {{essential to the}} understanding and development of metallic spin electronics. This paper discusses the processes {{that can be used}} for the {{fabrication of}} such structures and the challenges in which they present, with particular emphasis on extreme sub-micrometre pillar structures suitable for the study of spin-transfer <b>torque</b> <b>effects...</b>|$|R
50|$|If {{it is well}} designed, a {{contra-rotating}} propeller {{will have}} no rotational air flow, pushing a maximum amount of air uniformly through the propeller disk, resulting in high performance and low induced energy loss. It also serves to counter the asymmetrical <b>torque</b> <b>effect</b> of a conventional propeller (see P-factor). Some contra-rotating systems were designed to be used at take off for maximum power and efficiency under such conditions, and allowing one of the propellers to be disabled during cruise to extend flight time.|$|E

50|$|With {{a single}} main rotor helicopter, the {{creation}} of torque as the engine turns the rotor creates a <b>torque</b> <b>effect</b> that causes {{the body of the}} helicopter to turn in the opposite direction of the rotor. To eliminate this effect, some sort of antitorque control must be used with a sufficient margin of power available to allow the helicopter to maintain its heading and provide yaw control. The three most common controls used today are the tail rotor, Eurocopter's Fenestron (also called a fantail), and MD Helicopters' NOTAR.|$|E

50|$|The {{aircraft}} carriage {{is built}} from 4130 steel tubing. In flight steering is accomplished via handles that actuate the canopy brakes, creating roll and yaw. On the ground the aircraft has foot pedal-controlled nosewheel steering. The {{main landing gear}} incorporates spring rod suspension.

50|$|The {{aircraft}} was a single-seat monoplane of mixed construction; with wing spars of 30KhSGA steel, D1 aluminium alloy ribs, flush riveted skin, and elektron magnesium alloy leading edges; the fuselage was largely of flush-riveted D1 aluminium alloy {{built as a}} semi-monocoque shell with a wooden tail section. Armour was provided fore and aft of the compact cockpit, and the heavy armament was grouped around {{the nose of the}} aircraft, with two 12.7mm BS machine guns in the upper nose and four ShVAK20 cannon in the lower forward fuselage. The engines were housed in large underwing nacelles and drove counter rotating propellers to eliminate <b>torque</b> <b>effect</b> with throttle movement.|$|E
5000|$|Testing by Grumman {{test pilot}} [...] "Connie" [...] Converse {{indicated}} [...] "the flying qualities for the XF5F-1 were good overall. The counter-rotating props were a nice feature, virtually eliminating the <b>torque</b> <b>effect</b> on takeoff ... single-engine performance was good, rudder forces {{tended to be}} high in single engine configuration. Spin recovery was positive but elevator forces required for recovery were unusually high. All acrobatics were easily performed, and of course forward visibility was excellent." [...] In 1941, Navy pilots tested the XF5F-1 in a fly-off against the Supermarine Spitfire, Hawker Hurricane, Curtiss P-40 Warhawk, Bell P-39 Airacobra, Bell XFL Airabonita, Vought XF4U Corsair, Grumman F4F Wildcat, and Brewster F2A Buffalo.|$|E
5000|$|The Triple Tractor {{followed}} the Tandem Twin and Triple Twin {{in the series}} of twin-engined aircraft built by Short Brothers, the intention behind fitting two engines being to produce an aircraft capable of sustaining flight {{in the event of}} one engine failing. It was powered by a pair of [...] Gnome Double Omega engines mounted in tandem in the extended nose of the aircraft, the front engine driving a single propeller and the other driving a pair of tractor propellers mounted at mid-gap between the wings, using chains. In order to reduce the <b>torque</b> <b>effect</b> of the rotary engines they were arranged to revolve in opposite directions.|$|E

50|$|The Sidewinder and to {{an extent}} the Anglewinder {{configurations}} are often seen as superior for slot racing cars. This is because when accelerating, the reverse torque of the motor transfers weight {{to the front of}} the vehicle and therefore the guide that keeps it on the track. This allows the slot racer to accelerate through corners. There is also a further advantage as, if dynamic braking is used, the reverse torque of the motor then transfers weight to the rear wheels which invariably are the dominant grip wheels on a slot car. Conversely the reverse <b>torque</b> <b>effect</b> on in line motor configurations transfers weight from side to side and destabilises the car.|$|E
50|$|The {{tail rotor}} is a smaller rotor mounted {{so that it}} rotates {{vertically}} or near-vertically {{at the end of}} the tail of a traditional single-rotor helicopter. The tail rotor's position and distance from the center of gravity allow it to develop thrust in the same direction as the main rotor's rotation, to counter the <b>torque</b> <b>effect</b> created by the main rotor. Tail rotors are simpler than main rotors since they require only collective changes in pitch to vary thrust. The pitch of the tail rotor blades is adjustable by the pilot via the anti-torque pedals, which also provide directional control by allowing the pilot to rotate the helicopter around its vertical axis.|$|E
