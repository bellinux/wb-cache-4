25|$|The {{difference}} between professional and amateur novelists often is the author's ability to publish. Many people take up novel {{writing as a}} hobby, but the difficulties of completing large scale fictional works of quality prevent the completion of novels. Once authors have completed a novel, they often will <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> published. The publishing industry requires novels to have accessible profitable markets, thus many novelists will self-publish to circumvent the editorial control of publishers. Self-publishing {{has long been an}} option for writers, with vanity presses printing bound books for a fee paid by the writer. In these settings, unlike the more traditional publishing industry, activities usually reserved for a publishing house, like the distribution and promotion of the book, become the author's responsibility. The rise of the Internet and electronic books has made self publishing far less expensive and a realistic way for authors to realize income.|$|E

500|$|Despite Homer's {{embodiment}} of American culture, his influence {{has spread to}} other parts of the world. In 2003, Matt Groening revealed that his father, after whom Homer was named, was Canadian, and said that this made Homer himself a Canadian. The character was later made an honorary citizen of Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, because Homer Groening was believed to be from there, although sources say the senior Groening was actually born in the province of Saskatchewan. In 2007, an image of Homer was painted next to the Cerne Abbas Giant in Dorset, England as part of a promotion for The Simpsons Movie. This caused outrage among local neopagans who performed [...] "rain magic" [...] to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> washed away. In 2008, a defaced Spanish euro coin was found in Avilés, Spain with the face of Homer replacing the effigy of King Juan Carlos I.|$|E

2500|$|By early 1928, Parnok was bedridden, {{though still}} translating. She was depressed, [...] "The Knot" [...] {{had been forced}} to close after {{publishing}} Half-Whispered, she was suffering from writer's block with her poetry, and Spendiaryan had died without finishing the score to Almast. As censorship clamped down, Parnok’s poetic voice became [...] "unlawful", leading to prohibition on publication of her works in 1928. She made her living solely by translating poems by Charles Baudelaire, novels by Romain Rolland, Marcel Proust, Henri Barbusse and others. In May, 1928, Maximilian Steinberg took it upon himself to complete Almast and Parnok agreed to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> approved for the Bolshoi Theatre to produce it. In 1929, Tsuberbiller's brother died, and she and Parnok became responsible for the care of his five-year-old twins.|$|E

It was later revealed that the seventh season would be the final season, as Comedy Central announced {{that they would not be}} commissioning any further episodes. The series finale aired on September 4, 2013. While Groening has said he will <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> picked up by another network, David X.

In May 2011, Brighton and Hove City Council undertook a £50,000 restoration of the exterior. In the same month, the Friends of the Pepperpot announced that three new uses were being considered for the building—conversion into a bed and breakfast, a community centre or a café—and {{that they were in}} negotiations with the city council about the possibility of taking over the ownership of the building. In September 2011, it was stated that more structural work was needed and that the final cost could be £100,000, or even more if the interior was restored. [...] Heritage bodies such as English Heritage, The Georgian Group, The Regency Society and The Landmark Trust consulted with the Friends of the Pepperpot and the city council to decide what should happen.|$|E
2500|$|Returning home, Lady William Cecil {{published}} her findings [...] "Report on the Work Done at Aswan" [...] in the Annales du Service des antiquités de l'Egypte in 1903. In December, 1903, Lord and Lady William Cecil attended Princess Henry of Battenburg {{to return}} to Egypt, having been members of her household for many years. Her second season was not as productive and her work was overshadowed by a discovery made on Elephantine Island of a papyrus engagement contract. The document, in Aramaic script, contained important descriptions of the fortress and city of Aswan {{in the era of}} Artaxerxes I and Darius II and Lady William worked diligently with Howard Carter and others to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> published. In 1904, she published Bird Notes from the Nile, which she offered for sale to benefit the parish church of St Mary's Church in Scarborough, North Yorkshire. The book inspired the black crowned crane, balearica pavonia ceciliae to be named in her honour. Other charitable works Lady William supported included the Children's Invalid Aid Fund; London's Queen's Hospital for Children, for which she was one of only two women directors; and the ambulance and hospital works of the Order of Saint John of Jerusalem, for which she also served as a Lady Justice. Lady William and her husband spent the next several years travelling, visiting Australia in 1905.|$|E
2500|$|Billie Whitelaw {{worked with}} Beckett for 25 years on such plays as Not I, Eh Joe, Krapp's Last Tape, and Footfalls and Rockaby. She first met Beckett in 1963. In her {{autobiography}} she describes {{their first meeting}} in 1963 was [...] "trust at first sight". Beckett went on to write many of his experimental theatre works for her. She came {{to be regarded as}} his muse, the [...] "supreme interpreter of his work", perhaps most famous for her role as the mouth in Not I. She said of the play Rockaby: [...] "I put the tape in my head. And I sort of look in a particular way, but not at the audience. Sometimes as a director Beckett comes out with absolute gems and I use them a lot in other areas. We were doing Happy Days and I just did not know where in the theatre to look during this particular section. And I asked, and he thought for a bit and then said, 'Inward' [...] ". She said of her role in Footfalls: [...] "I felt like a moving, musical Edvard Munch painting and, in fact, when Beckett was directing Footfalls he was not only using me to play the notes but I almost felt that he did have the paintbrush out and was painting." [...] "Sam knew that I would turn myself inside out to give him what he wanted", she explained. [...] "With all of Sam's work, the scream was there, my task was to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> out." [...] She stopped performing his plays in 1989 when he died.|$|E

2500|$|The show premiered in Toronto, at the O'Keefe Centre on October 1, 1960. It overran {{drastically}} – it {{was supposed}} to last two hours forty minutes, and instead clocked in at four and a half hours. [...] The curtain came down at twenty to one in the morning; Lerner later noted that [...] "Only Tristan and Isolde equaled it as a bladder endurance contest." [...] Noël Coward was supposed to have remarked that the show was [...] "longer than the 'Götterdämmerung'...and not nearly as funny!" [...] In spite of this, the morning papers gave generally positive reviews, but hinted that the show needed much work, i.e. drastic editing, in order to succeed. Soon afterwards, Lerner was hospitalised for three weeks with a bleeding ulcer. [...] Soon after he was discharged, Hart suffered his second heart attack, and Lerner stepped in as temporary director {{for the rest of the}} out-of-town run. Camelot then moved to Boston, edited, but still running well over the intended length. The production team tried to find another director, even phoning Jose Ferrer, who could not undertake the job. Lerner and Loewe disagreed on how to proceed with the show, as Loewe did not want to make any major changes without Hart's guidance. Lerner wrote: [...] "God knows what would have happened had it not been for Richard Burton." [...] Accepting cuts and changes, he radiated a [...] "faith and geniality" [...] and calmed the fears of the cast. Guenevere's song [...] "Before I Gaze at You Again" [...] was given to Andrews at the last minute before the first New York preview, which provoked her famous quote, [...] "Of course, darling, but do <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> to me the night before." [...] After the show opened on Broadway, Hart was released from the hospital, and he and Lerner began cutting the play even further. Two songs, [...] "Then You May Take Me To the Fair" [...] and [...] "Fie on Goodness," [...] were cut a few months into the run (though they remain on the cast album, and the former featured in the 1967 film).|$|E
