5|$|Metalloproteinase {{activity}} causes hemorrhage and necrosis {{following a}} snake bite, {{a process which}} aids digestion. The activity of proteases, on the other hand, disrupts platelet and muscle function and damages cell membranes, and thus contributes to a quick death for the prey animal. The {{study found that the}} venoms of Crotalus fell into two categories; those that favored metalloproteinases (Type I) and those that favored proteases (Type II). The study stated that these functions were essentially mutually exclusive; venoms had been selected for based on either their toxicity or their <b>tenderizing</b> potential. The researchers also hypothesized that the reason for this dichotomy was that a venom high in neurotoxicity, such as a type II venom, kills an animal quickly, preventing the relatively slower acting metalloproteinase from digesting tissue.|$|E

Select (SEL), Choice (CHO), and Certified Angus Beef™ (CAB) top sirloin butts (n= 54 for each) were aged for 7, 14, or 21 days and not <b>tenderized</b> (OX) or blade <b>tenderized</b> one (1 X) or two (2 X) times. Steaks from each top sirloin butt were assigned randomly to final endpoint cooking temperatures of 150, 160, and 170 °F. Each longer aging period resulted in lower (P<. 05, more tender) WBS. In addition, steaks blade <b>tenderized</b> 2 X had lower (P<. 05) WBS than steaks not <b>tenderized</b> or blade <b>tenderized</b> 1 X. Within each quality grade, WBS increased (P<. 05) as endpoint cooking temperature increased. When cooked to 160 or 170 °F, CHO and CAB steaks had lower (P<. 05) WBS than SEL steaks. Increased aging periods and blade tenderization passes of top sirloin butt steaks improved tenderness.

Top sirloin butts that qualified for either USDA Select (SEL, n= 36), USDA Choice (CHO, n= 36), or Certified Angus Beef™ Program (CAB, n= 36), were aged for 14 or 21 days and blade <b>tenderized</b> zero (0 X), one (1 X), or two (2 X) times. Steaks with higher quality grades (CHO and CAB) aged for 21 days had lower thawing losses than steaks aged 14 days and than SEL steaks aged for 21 days. Steaks aged for 14 days and not blade <b>tenderized</b> (0 X) had higher thawing losses than steaks aged for longer periods (21 days) and <b>tenderized</b> 0 X, 1 X, and 2 X.

40|$|A {{questionnaire}} {{to determine the}} use of blade tenderizers in beef fabrication facilities was sent to 241 members of the North American Meat Processors Association (NAMP). Eighty-four percent of the 90 respondents used blade tenderizers. These subprimals were at least sometimes <b>tenderized</b> by the following percentages of respondents: tenderloins, 7. 9; chuck cuts, 18; round cuts, 36; ribeyes, 38; strip loins, 56; and top sirloin butts, 62. If a processor blade-tenderized a particular cut, they <b>tenderized</b> a majority of their production for that cut, generally with multiple passes through the tenderizer. For example, the 62 % of respondents who <b>tenderized</b> top sirloin butts <b>tenderized</b> 87 % of their production of that cut {{with an average of}} 1. 6 passes.

40|$|An in-home {{evaluation}} of steaks from the M. Serratus ventralis {{was conducted to}} determine consumer acceptance. Steaks were also evaluated by Warner-Bratzler shear force (WBS) evaluations. Steaks from the M. Serratus ventralis were either blade <b>tenderized,</b> injected with a salt, phosphate, and papain solution, or served as a control. Consumers (n = 136) were not given a specific method of cookery, but were asked to document cooking method and degree of doneness, overall-like, tenderness desirability, tenderness of cut, juiciness desirability, juiciness of cut, flavor desirability, and flavor intensity. When cooked on the grill, in the oven, or in a skillet, injected steaks received the highest (P < 0. 05) ratings for tenderness. Furthermore, consumers rated injected and blade <b>tenderized</b> steaks higher (P< 0. 05) for overall like when they were cooked on the grill to {{a higher degree of}} doneness.

Moreover, injected steaks had significantly lower (P< 0. 05) WBS values when compared to blade <b>tenderized</b> and control steaks. Overall, ratings for all steaks were adequate, confirming the M.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Animal Sciences and IndustryTerry HouserA {{total of}} 45 top sirloin butts (IMPS 184) were {{procured}} from three commercial beef processing facilities {{to determine the}} effects of post-mortem aging time and blade tenderization on the quality of beef gluteus medius (GM) steaks. Top sirloin butts were randomly assigned to five post-mortem aging periods (5, 19, 33, 47, and 61 days). One-half of each beef GM was randomly assigned to either a blade <b>tenderized</b> treatment or a non-blade <b>tenderized</b> treatment that was not blade <b>tenderized.</b> Steaks were then evaluated for thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), metmyoglobin reducing activity (MRA), oxygen consumption rate (OCR), visual color panel, instrumental color, Warner-Bratzler shear force (WBSF), Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) enumeration, pH, and sensory properties. Aging × blade tenderization interactions (P < 0. 05) were found for display color panel, discoloration panel, WBSF, overall tenderness, myofibrillar tenderness, bloody/serumy, metallic, overall sweet, and bitter (P < 0. 05). As steaks were aged longer and blade <b>tenderized</b> they became more discolored during display and more tender. In addition, there were aging × display time interactions (P < 0. 05) observed for L*, a*, b*, display color panel, and discoloration panel. As steaks were aged longer, they had increased L*, a*, b*, and hue angle values and display color panel scores when initially put into a retail case, but L*, a* and b* decreased and discoloration scores increased as display time increased. Furthermore, there were blade tenderization × display time interactions (P < 0. 05) found for display and discoloration panels. Blade <b>tenderized</b> steaks discolored faster in retail display than non-blade <b>tenderized</b> steaks. With increased aging time, there was an increase (P < 0. 05) in TBARS, OCR, initial color panel, LAB enumeration, and warmed-over flavor, as well as a decrease in MRA. Also, as aging increased there was a decrease (P < 0. 05) in MRA, initial color panel scores, and WBSF values. Blade tenderization significantly increased (P < 0. 05) initial color panel scores, rancid flavor, and spoiled flavor. Increasing the aging time of the GM, produced steaks with decreased color stability, altered the flavor profile, and increased tenderness. Blade tenderization significantly increased tenderness, increased discoloration in a retail case, and produced more undesirable flavors...|$|R
