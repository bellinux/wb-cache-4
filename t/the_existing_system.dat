5|$|During the 12th and 13th centuries, law {{was taught}} in the City of London, {{primarily}} by the clergy. During the 13th century, two events happened that destroyed this form of legal education; firstly, a decree by Henry III of England on 2 December 1234 that no institutes of legal education could exist in the City of London, and secondly a papal bull was issued in 1254 that prohibited the clergy from teaching the common law, rather than canon law. As a result, <b>the</b> <b>existing</b> <b>system</b> of legal education fell apart. The common lawyers migrated to the hamlet of Holborn, the nearest place to the law courts at Westminster Hall that was outside the City.|$|E
5|$|English Poor Law {{legislation}} can {{be traced}} back as far as 1536, when legislation was passed to deal with the impotent poor, although there is much earlier Tudor legislation dealing with the problems caused by vagrants and beggars. The history of the Poor Law in England and Wales is usually divided between two statutes, the Old Poor Law passed during the reign of Elizabeth I and the New Poor Law, passed in 1834, which significantly modified <b>the</b> <b>existing</b> <b>system</b> of poor relief. The later statute altered the Poor Law system from one which was administered haphazardly at a local parish level to a highly centralised system which encouraged the large-scale development of workhouses by Poor Law Unions.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a part of an ongoing {{research}} project at Link ̈oping University. The goal of the thesis work is to design and implement a prototype for a symbolic execution system that scales well with larger programs and is capable of performing symbolic execution on machine code. For this reason we have analyzed the current state of symbolic executors that are able to perform symbolic execution on machine code {{to see if we could}} use that implementation as base for our prototype. We wanted to know if any of <b>the</b> <b>existing</b> <b>systems</b> scaled well with large software. We found that neither of <b>the</b> <b>existing</b> <b>systems</b> worked well with the real life software in our evaluation. Furthermore, even if it would have been possible to fix one of <b>the</b> <b>existing</b> <b>systems,</b> <b>the</b> time required to figure out the faults in their implementation would most likely have been too great. For this reason we decided to create an implementation of our own from scratch. However, we did note that some approaches in <b>the</b> <b>existing</b> <b>systems</b> seemed to work better with large software. Specifically saving as little state as possible about the program seemed favorable. Armed with the knowledge gained from the analysis, we managed to implement a system that compared quite well with <b>the</b> <b>existing</b> <b>systems.</b> Our system was able to execute all the real-life programs used in our tests, but unfortunately had some issues with high memory usage for certain programs. In order to lessen the problem with high memory usage, we present and discuss several potential ways to mitigate this issue...|$|R

5|$|Initially, in fact, Brezhnev portrayed {{himself as}} a moderate— not as radical as Kosygin but not as {{conservative}} as Shelepin. Brezhnev gave the Central Committee formal permission to initiate Kosygin's 1965 economic reform. According to historian Robert Service, Brezhnev did modify some of Kosygin's reform proposals, {{many of which were}} unhelpful at best. In his early days, Brezhnev asked for advice from provincial party secretaries, and spent hours each day on such conversations. During the March 1965 Central Committee plenum, Brezhnev took control of Soviet agriculture, another hint that he opposed Kosygin's reform program. Brezhnev believed, in contrast to Khrushchev, that rather than wholesale re-organization, the key to increasing agricultural output was making <b>the</b> <b>existing</b> <b>system</b> work more efficiently.|$|E
5|$|Modi also relaxed or {{abolished}} {{a number}} of other environmental regulations, particularly those related to industrial activity. A government committee stated that <b>the</b> <b>existing</b> <b>system</b> only served to create corruption, and that the government should instead rely on the owners of industries to voluntarily inform the government about the pollution they were creating. Other changes included reducing ministry oversight on small mining projects, and no longer requiring approval from tribal councils for projects inside forested areas. In addition, Modi lifted a moratorium on new industrial activity in the most polluted areas in the countries. The changes were welcomed by businesspeople, but criticised by environmentalists.|$|E

40|$|When an {{organization}} faces {{different types of}} collaboration, for example after a company merger, {{there is a need}} to consolidate <b>the</b> <b>existing</b> in-house developed software.

In order to investigate how a strategy should be chosen, we have performed a multiple case study, consisting of nine integration projects. Two major concerns have been found that can be used to exclude some strategies: 1) architectural compatibility, and 2) what we have labeled ‘retireability’, i. e. all considerations influencing whether or not <b>the</b> <b>existing</b> <b>systems</b> can be allowed to be retired.

5|$|Until the 1990s, {{there was}} little focus on {{expansion}} of the system because the system {{was in a state}} of disrepair, and funds were allocated to rebuilding and repairing <b>the</b> <b>existing</b> <b>system.</b> However, in the 1990s, with the system in better shape, the construction of the Second Avenue Subway was looked into again. Construction of the Second Avenue Subway started in 2007, and the first phase was completed in 2017. Since the 1990s, public officials and organizations such as the Regional Plan Association have pushed for the further expansion of the system. Projects such as the TriboroRx, a circumferential line connecting the outer boroughs, the reuse of the Rockaway Beach Branch, and the further expansion of the Second Avenue Subway have all been proposed, albeit unfunded.|$|E
5|$|Freeway {{construction}} {{continued through}} the 1970s. On April 6, 1972, the New Buffalo Welcome Center was relocated from its previous location next to US12 to one adjacent to I-94.

Also in 1972, a gas tax increase was passed to facilitate US and state highway improvement projects. The final section of I-75 between Alger and Roscommon was opened on November 1, 1973, in a dedication by Governor William G. Milliken, completing the longest highway in the state. In 1974, the state implemented mileage-based exit numbers along the remaining Interstates in Michigan.

5|$|Heavily {{influenced}} by {{the example of the}} British postal system, which issued its first stamp, the Penny Black, in 1840, the Belgian government supported the inauguration of a Belgian equivalent. Under <b>the</b> <b>existing</b> <b>system,</b> postage costs were paid by the receiver rather than the sender, which discouraged people from receiving, and therefore sending, letters. The idea of postage stamps, which would allow the sender to pay in advance, was officially sanctioned by Leopold I on the Loi apportant des modifications au régime des postes ("Law bringing modifications to the postal system") on 24 December 1847 while the radical liberal and future Prime Minister, Walthère Frère-Orban, served as Minister of Public Works. The debate on the reform of the postage in Belgium occurred {{at the same time as}} widespread postage reform, {{influenced by}} the British example, in France, Bavaria and elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Though these {{measures}} were established to counter {{many of the}} irrationalities in the Soviet economic system, the reform {{did not try to}} change <b>the</b> <b>existing</b> <b>system</b> radically; it instead tried to improve it gradually. Success was ultimately mixed, and Soviet analyses on why the reform failed to reach its full potential have never given any definitive answers. The key factors are agreed upon, however, with blame being put on the combination of the recentralisation of the economy with the decentralisation of enterprise autonomy, creating several administrative obstacles. Additionally, instead of creating a market which in turn would establish a pricing system, administrators were given the responsibility for overhauling the pricing system themselves. Because of this, the market-like system failed to materialise. To make matters worse, the reform was contradictory at best. In retrospect, however, the Eighth Five-Year Plan as a whole is considered {{to be one of the}} most successful periods for the Soviet economy, and the most successful for consumer production.|$|E
5|$|Tyler {{had been}} drawn into Virginia {{politics}} even as a U.S. Senator. From October 1829 to January 1830, {{he served as a}} member of the state constitutional convention, a role which he had been reluctant to accept. The original Virginia Constitution gave outsize influence to the state's more conservative eastern counties, as it allocated an equal number of legislators to each county (regardless of population) and only granted suffrage to property owners. The convention gave the more populous and liberal counties of western Virginia an opportunity to expand their influence. Tyler, a slaveowner from eastern Virginia, supported <b>the</b> <b>existing</b> <b>system.</b> He largely remained on the sidelines during the debate, however, not wishing to alienate any of the state's political factions. He was focused on his Senate career, which required a broad base of support, and gave speeches during the convention promoting compromise and unity.|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I {{have participated in}} an action {{research}} project in South Africa and Mozambique within their respective public health care. The “replication” of a system {{from one country to}} another, presents a wealth of problems. In this thesis a research is done {{in the context of the}} transfer of a routine health information reporting system from South Africa to Mozambique. This process requires adaptation of the system to the new context. Part of this context is <b>the</b> already <b>existing</b> legacy <b>systems</b> as entangled parts of a larger information infrastructure. <b>The</b> <b>existing</b> legacy <b>systems</b> consist of institutionalized routines in existence, and an objective of the new system is to deinstitutionalize these, and institutionalize new organizational routines. This effort is in conflict with the installed base that includes the old legacy systems. To understand the tensions that arise as part of the effort necessary to align the new systems to the installed base, legacy theory will be used and evaluated. Legacy systems theory has several methods for connecting the old to the new. One method is target database population, which consists of populating the new system with data from <b>existing</b> legacy <b>systems</b> by importing. As part of this thesis, a tool was developed to automate parts of the import process. The import process was highly complex and time consuming due to several legacy properties found in <b>the</b> <b>existing</b> systems; primarily lack of documentation, lack of interfaces and the general poor state of <b>the</b> <b>existing</b> <b>systems.</b> Data stored in <b>the</b> <b>existing</b> <b>systems</b> were found to be redundant, inconsistent, non-uniform and ambiguous. The tool is evaluated as a change tool in the context of legacy systems and information infrastructure theories. There are two steps in the use of the tool; import of data, enabling data previously hidden and unavailable to become visible, and analysis of the imported data to analysis and evaluate <b>the</b> <b>existing</b> <b>systems.</b> However, <b>the</b> tool was not found to act as a gateway, this due to lack of sustainability and support for continuous data import. <b>The</b> <b>existing</b> <b>systems</b> and infrastructure is after completion of the import process evaluated by analyzing the data in the new system. The objective of the evaluation is to show the need for change of the health information systems within the organization. Several shortcomings of <b>the</b> <b>existing</b> <b>systems</b> emerged, including lack of flexibility, lack of integration, extensive fragmentation, problems in data collection, analysis and the use of data. There were also lack of conditions to enable new routines, sharing of information, and support for the heterogeneous user community...|$|R

5|$|The {{introduction}} of the New Poor Law also resulted in opposition. Some who gave evidence to the Royal Commission into the Operation of the Poor Laws suggested that <b>the</b> <b>existing</b> <b>system</b> had proved adequate and was more adaptable to local needs. This argument was strongest in the industrial North of England and in the textile industries where outdoor relief was a more effective method of dealing with cyclical unemployment {{as well as being}} a more cost-effective method. Poor Law commissioners faced greatest opposition in Lancashire and the West Riding of Yorkshire where in 1837 there was high unemployment during an economic depression. The New Poor Law was seen as interference from Londoners with little understanding of local affairs. Opposition was unusually strong because committees had already been formed in opposition to the Ten Hours Movement, leaders of the Ten Hours campaign such as Richard Oastler, Joseph Rayner Stephens and John Fielden became the leaders of the Anti-Poor Law campaign. The Book of Murder was published and was aimed at creating opposition to the workhouse system. and pamphlets were published spreading rumour and propaganda about Poor Law Commissioners and alleged infanticide inside of workhouses. Opposition to the Poor Law yielded some successes in delaying the development of workhouses, and one workhouse in Stockport was attacked by a crowd of rioters. As many Boards of Guardians were determined to continue under the old system, the Poor Law Commission granted some boards the right to continue providing relief under the Old Poor Law. However, the movement against the New Poor Law was short-lived, leading many to instead turn towards Chartism.|$|E
