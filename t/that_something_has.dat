5|$|In Goodland, Florida, {{during a}} fierce hurricane, Sara Shipley and her son, Evan, desperately try to flip {{the washing machine}} but fail to do so as tentacles ensnare them. After {{receiving}} a call, FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) arrive {{at the home of}} retired FBI agent Arthur Dales (Darren McGavin), the first to look into the X-Files. He tells them about the Shipley family and how Sara Shipley called him in a panic after her husband was attacked by something in the bathroom with tentacles. Scully is dubious about this but believes <b>that</b> <b>something</b> <b>has</b> indeed happened to the Shipley family during this hurricane.|$|E

25|$|After {{the events}} of , Cecilia is partnered with Psylocke and sent to Mexico to locate {{the second of the}} Five Lights; the first mutants to {{manifest}} powers since M-Day. After sedating Gabriel, she informs his parents of what is transpiring and offers him help from the X-Men. Psylocke comes to the room and explains <b>that</b> <b>something</b> <b>has</b> happened, Gabriel's manifesting speed powers caused him to move so fast he is invisible to the naked eye. Psylocke taps into Cecilia's powers to create a force field around his room so they would not lose him before Hope Summers could arrive to help.|$|E

25|$|Cassie, {{after much}} convincing from Thelma decides that her fetus must be aborted, {{although}} it is growing at an alarming rate. A week after conception, the doctors believe she is {{nearing the end of}} her second trimester. Thelma assists Cassie, without telling her that success means that she may never see Cassie again. Azazeal tries to interfere and save his son, but Cassie goes through with the abortion...or so she thinks. When Thelma realizes that Cassie can still see her, Thelma knows <b>that</b> <b>something</b> <b>has</b> not gone right. Cassie discovers weeks later that the doctor who performed her procedure has been influenced by Azazeal, and that the baby is alive and in Azazeal's care.|$|E
500|$|Obsidian drew {{on older}} {{computer}} RPGs for inspiration on the storyline and gameplay, like Fallout and the Ultima series. Obsidian CEO Feargus Urquhart said [...] "We've {{been thinking about}} a lot of older RPGs, and we have this feeling <b>that</b> <b>something</b> <b>has</b> been lost with recent RPGs." [...] He compared Neverwinter Nights 2 to Baldur's Gate II, stating that he wanted to expand upon the city of Neverwinter as Baldur's Gate II had done with its setting, Athkatla. [...] "We're looking at how to make Neverwinter a really intriguing place to be, and make it a place where you go and come back to and go and come back to and have it really be a center for the game," [...] Urquhart said. The game's story, while still revolving around the city of Neverwinter, would be unrelated to Neverwinter Nights. Instead of starting the game as a powerful, important character, players would begin Neverwinter Nights 2 as nobodies. Obsidian wanted realism in the game and concrete consequences for the player's actions. The story would be centered on the player character, who would have to gradually earn the respect of Lord Nasher and the city of Neverwinter.|$|E
500|$|George Orwell {{believed}} {{just the}} opposite. He argued: [...] "It is clear <b>that</b> <b>something</b> <b>has</b> departed, {{some kind of}} current has been switched off, the later verse does not contain the earlier, {{even if it is}} claimed as an improvement upon it [...] He does not really feel his faith, but merely assents to it for complex reasons. It does not in itself give him any fresh literary impulse." [...] Years later, Russell Kirk wrote, [...] "I cannot agree with Orwell that Eliot gave no more than a melancholy assent to doctrines now quite unbelievable. Over the past quarter of a century, most serious critics—whether or not they find Christian faith impossible—have found in the Quartets the greatest twentieth-century achievements in the poetry of philosophy and religion." [...] Like Orwell, Stead also noticed a difference between the Four Quartets and Eliot's earlier poetry, but he disagreed with Orwell's conclusion: [...] "Four Quartets is an attempt to bring into a more exact balance the will and the creative imagination; it attempts to harness the creative imagination which in all Eliot's earlier poetry ran its own course, edited but not consciously directed. The achievement is of a high order, but the best qualities of Four Quartets are inevitably different from those of The Waste Land.|$|E

2500|$|Trainer Gary Wilkes, {{credited}} with introducing clicker training for dogs {{to the general}} public, writes, [...] "No method of training is 'all positive.' By scientific definition, the removal of a desired reward is a 'negative punishment.' So, if you ever withhold a treat or use a time-out, by definition, you are a 'negative' trainer who uses 'punishment.' [...] " [...] where [...] "negative" [...] indicates <b>that</b> <b>something</b> <b>has</b> been removed and [...] "punishment" [...] merely indicates {{there has been a}} reduction in the behavior (unlike the common use of these terms).|$|E
2500|$|As a Sony franchise, all Wild Arms {{video games}} appear {{exclusively}} on PlayStation video game consoles. Each individual title {{is set in}} the world of Filgaia and contain several consistencies that have become series mainstays, including similar races, monsters, technologies, and plot points. However, only two of the titles directly allude to any chronology, as each game bears a Filgaia unrecognizable from each prior title, so it can be assumed <b>that</b> <b>something</b> <b>has</b> once more devastated it between each entry in the series. Though variations and stylistic differences persist in the overall presentation of each game, all titles can be considered [...] "Weird Westerns", combining attributes from traditional fantasy, science fiction, and steampunk genres.|$|E

2500|$|... "Platonism" [...] {{is a term}} {{coined by}} {{scholars}} {{to refer to the}} intellectual consequences of denying, as Plato's Socrates often does, the reality of the material world. In several dialogues, most notably the Republic, Socrates inverts the common man's intuition about what is knowable and what is real. While most people take the objects of their senses to be real if anything is, Socrates is contemptuous of people who think <b>that</b> <b>something</b> <b>has</b> to be graspable in the hands to be real. In the Theaetetus, he says such people are eu amousoi (εὖ ἄμουσοι), an expression that means literally, [...] "happily without the muses" [...] (Theaetetus 156a). In other words, such people live without the divine inspiration that gives him, and people like him, access to higher insights about reality.|$|E
2500|$|In Dennett's {{updated version}} of the {{inverted}} spectrum thought experiment, [...] "alternative neurosurgery", you again awake to find that your qualia have been inverted—grass appears red, the sky appears orange, etc. According to the original account, you should be immediately aware <b>that</b> <b>something</b> <b>has</b> gone horribly wrong. Dennett argues, however, {{that it is impossible}} to know whether the diabolical neurosurgeons have indeed inverted your qualia (by tampering with your optic nerve, say), or have simply inverted your connection to memories of past qualia. Since both operations would produce the same result, you would have no means on your own to tell which operation has actually been conducted, and you are thus in the odd position of not knowing whether there has been a change in your [...] "immediately apprehensible" [...] qualia.|$|E
2500|$|Nevertheless, a {{technician}} delves {{deeper into the}} anomaly, discovering <b>that</b> <b>something</b> <b>has</b> infiltrated the HQ computer systems and is using the portals to send large quantities of materials and data to the past, spreading out like a virus and quickly evolving. In an ironic twist, the virus is discovered to be the program originally installed in the Element Dolls six years ago, now reaching beyond the DonPachi Corps programming and seeking to annihilate the human race in retaliation for their [...] "enslavement" [...] (after the war, they met a rather cruel demise at the hand of their own human creators) by waging war in the past {{rather than in the}} present: unsettled, the Colonel authorizes the last transport ship to time jump in order to fight back the invasion before future changes. However, he states: [...] "Start over from the past... I never thought of that", echoing the ideas of mankind's imperfection which has always been a recurring theme in the series.|$|E

2500|$|Hume's main {{argument}} concerning miracles is that miracles {{by definition}} are singular events {{that differ from}} the established laws of nature. Such natural laws are codified {{as a result of}} past experiences. Therefore, a miracle is a violation of all prior experience and thus incapable on this basis of reasonable belief. However, the probability <b>that</b> <b>something</b> <b>has</b> occurred in contradiction of all past experience should always be judged to be less than the probability that either ones senses have deceived one, or the person recounting the miraculous occurrence is lying or mistaken. Hume would say, all of which he had past experience of. For Hume, this refusal to grant credence does not guarantee correctness. He offers the example of an Indian Prince, who, having grown up in a hot country, refuses to believe that water has frozen. By Hume's lights, this refusal is not wrong and the Prince [...] "reasoned justly"; it is presumably only when he has had extensive experience of the freezing of water that he has warrant to believe that the event could occur.|$|E
