5|$|The Indian Independence Act 1947 (10 & 11 Geo 6 c. 30) {{passed by}} the Parliament of the United Kingdom divided British India into the two new {{independent}} dominions; the Dominion of India (later to become the Republic of India) and the Dominion of Pakistan (later to become <b>the</b> <b>Islamic</b> <b>Republic</b> of Pakistan).

The act later received royal assent on 18 July 1947. The partition was accompanied by violent riots and mass casualties, and the displacement of nearly 15 million people due to religious violence across the subcontinent; millions of Muslim, Sikh and Hindu refugees trekked the newly drawn borders to Pakistan and India respectively in the months surrounding independence. On 14 August 1947, the new Dominion of Pakistan became independent and Muhammad Ali Jinnah was sworn in as its first governor general in Karachi. Independence was marked with widespread celebration, but the atmosphere remained heated given the communal riots prevalent during independence in 1947.|$|E
