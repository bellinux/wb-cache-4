5|$|A single {{reference}} in {{the tomb of}} Ahmose Pen-Nekhebet indicates another campaign in Iamu {{in the land of}} Kehek. Unfortunately, the location of Kehek is unknown. It was long believed that Kehek was a reference to the Libyan tribe, Qeheq, and thus it was postulated that invaders from Libya took advantage of the death of Ahmose to move into the western Nile Delta. Unfortunately for this theory, the Qeheq people only appeared in later times, and Kehek's identity remains unknown. Nubia is a possibility, since Amenhotep did campaign <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> western desert and the oases have also been suggested, since these seem to have fallen under Egyptian control once again.|$|E

5|$|After graduation, Sheppard was {{recommended}} to Tuscaloosa Theological Institute (now Stillman College, which dedicated its library in Sheppard's honor in 1959) in Alabama. He met Lucy Gantt {{near the end}} of his time <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> two became engaged, although they would not marry for ten years. Sheppard cultivated a desire to preach in Africa, but despite the support of Tuscaloosa founder Charles Stillman, the Southern Presbyterian Church had yet to establish its mission in the Congo. He was ordained in 1888 and served as pastor to a church in Atlanta, Georgia, but did not adapt well to the life of an urban black in a heavily segregated area of the Southern United States. After two years of writing to the Presbyterian Foreign Missionary Board in Baltimore, Maryland to inquire about starting a mission in Africa, he became frustrated by the vague rationale of the rejection letters and took a train to Baltimore to ask the chairman in person. The man politely informed Sheppard that the board would not send a black man without a white supervisor.|$|E

5|$|Allen {{traveled}} {{along the}} southeastern {{banks of the}} Richelieu River, up to Sorel, where he crossed that river and continued up the southern shore of the St. Lawrence to Longueuil. According to Allen's account, he met Brown <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> two of them then hatched a plan to attack Montreal. Brown would cross the river with 200 men at La Prairie, upriver from Montreal, and Allen, with his Americans and 80 Canadians {{under the command of}} Loiseau and Duggan, two of Livingston's captains, would cross the river at Longueuil, below the city, and the two forces would, after a prearranged signal, converge on the city itself.|$|E

5|$|Authorized to be {{built by}} Ansaldo of Genoa, the new battleship's keel was laid down on 14 May 1938 and {{launched}} on 15 November 1939. At her launching, she was christened Impero, after Italy's empire in Africa. With Genoa being in bombing range of France, and war now a definite possibility, Impero was moved to Brindisi on 8 June 1940 due to fears of French attack. Trieste was considered a better location, but Roma was fitting out <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> shipyard could not handle two battleships at one time. While at Brindisi, some of her machinery was installed, along with parts of her smaller caliber weaponry. Despite the intent to move Impero to a safer location, Brindisi was still hit by Allied bombers, though Impero was not damaged. Nevertheless, the Regia Marina decided to shift production priorities to desperately needed escorts for merchant convoys. As a result, construction of Impero was delayed to expedite those ships. The only work done was the fitting of the engines and some gun mountings.|$|E
5|$|Besides horse racing, Rosecroft {{has allowed}} other activities. The Old School Boxing Gym is located <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> track has hosted amateur boxing matches for several years. The gym {{served as a}} refuge to {{children}} in the area. Before his heavyweight championship tenure, George Foreman beat Sylvester Dullaire at Rosecroft on July 14, 1969. Then-undefeated boxer Seth Mitchell also fought at Rosecroft in 2009. Rosecroft made news when it decided to host an all-female night of boxing in 2009. In 1974, Rosecroft Raceway hosted professional motorcycle races. In 2012, Rosecroft hosted the 46th Annual Cherry Blossom Rugby Tournament. The area also serves large banquets. Other community activities include an annual Senior Citizen Day, hosting flea markets, fundraising for politicians, and hosting Governor's Day.|$|E
5|$|D was {{a success}} in Japan. In total it sold one million copies <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Saturn version {{reached the top of}} the sales charts in its first week. It was one of the few genuine hits for the 3DO in Japan, and drew a {{significant}} cult following of hardcore fans even before being ported to other systems. A Japanese re-release for the 3DO titled D's Diner: Director's Cut contained additional content and a bonus soundtrack disc. The PlayStation release of D was set to be published by Acclaim and manufactured by Sony. Orders for around 100,000 units had already been made before Sony decided to give their other titles manufacturing priority. Sony told Eno they had only manufactured 40,000 units, which made Eno very upset, but ultimately, Sony had only manufactured 28,000 units. This shortage upset Eno so much that he later announced, at a Sony event, that he would release his next games for the Sega Saturn. WARP's later games, including those in the D series, Enemy Zero (1996) and D2 (1999), were released exclusively on Sega platforms.|$|E

5|$|Elephant Island, on {{the eastern}} limits of the South Shetland Islands, was remote from {{anywhere}} that the expedition had planned to go, and far beyond normal shipping routes. No relief ship would search for them <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> likelihood of rescue from any other outside agency was equally negligible. The island was bleak and inhospitable, and its terrain devoid of vegetation, although it had fresh water, and a relative abundance of seals and penguins to provide food and fuel for immediate survival. The rigours of an Antarctic winter were fast approaching; the narrow shingle beach where they were camped was already being swept by almost continuous gales and blizzards, which destroyed one of the tents in their temporary camp, and knocked others flat. The pressures and hardships of the previous months were beginning to tell on the men, {{many of whom were}} in a run-down state both mentally and physically.|$|E
5|$|In 1904, at {{the request}} of the England Rugby Board (known as the Rugby Football Union), Bedell-Sivright was {{selected}} to lead a British Lions team on a tour of Australia and New Zealand. He only played in one Test, against Australia, because of a broken leg, but the team did go undefeated in Australiawinning all their matches <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> three Test matches 17–0, 17–3 and 16–0. A notable incident on the Australian leg of the tour was a dispute between the British side and one of the Australian referees. The refereeHugh Dolan had ordered off British Isles player Denys Dobson after claiming Dobson had directed a personal insult at him. Bedell-Sivright was not playing, but pulled his team from the field for 20 minutes while disputing the decision with Dolan and the other officials. Eventually the British side returned to play, but without Dobson. Following the match Bedell-Sivright accused the referee of incompetence, and an inquiry eventually cleared Dobson of using indecent language, but he became the first British Isles player ever ordered off.|$|E
5|$|In 1954, Regional Plan Association {{advocated}} for {{an extension of}} the BMT Canarsie Line from Eighth Avenue to Jersey City under the Hudson River. The tunnel under the Hudson would have cost $40,000,000. The extension would have provided access to commuter railroads in New Jersey as most lines converged <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> lines that didn't would be rerouted to stop there. The RPA also suggested having a parking lot there for access from the Pulaski Skyway and the New Jersey Turnpike. It was suggested that either the New York City Transit Authority, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey or the Bi-State Metropolitan Rapid Transit Commission would do the construction.|$|E

5|$|In 1996, {{the trail}} was rerouted through Pelly Crossing and a {{checkpoint}} was added <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Lake Laberge stretch {{was replaced by}} a route through Braeburn and along the Dawson-Whitehorse Overland Trail. In 1997, mushers were routed through the Chena River Lakes Flood Control Project and to the Alaska town of North Pole before continuing on to Fairbanks. The North Pole loop was removed before the 2009 race, and mushers were directed through Two Rivers instead. Starting in the 2010 race, the Mile 101 location was upgraded from a dog drop to a full-fledged checkpoint. In the past several races, the Two Rivers checkpoint has changed locations annually: from a lodge to a campground, and then to a gravel pit in 2011.|$|E
5|$|In February 1941, Roosevelt sent Conant to Britain {{as head of}} {{a mission}} that also {{included}} Frederick L. Hovde from Purdue University and Carroll L. Wilson from MIT, to evaluate the research being carried out <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> prospects for cooperation. The 1940 Tizard Mission had revealed that American technology was some years behind that of Britain in many fields, most notably radar, and cooperation was eagerly sought. Conant had lunch with Prime Minister Winston Churchill and Frederick Lindemann, his leading scientific adviser, and an audience with King George VI at Buckingham Palace. At a subsequent meeting, Lindemann told Conant about British progress towards developing an atomic bomb. What most impressed Conant was the British conviction that it was feasible. That the British program was ahead of the American one raised the possibility in Conant's mind that the German nuclear energy project might be even further ahead, as Germany was generally acknowledged to be a world leader in nuclear physics. Later that year, Churchill, as Chancellor of the University of Bristol, conferred an honorary Doctor of Laws degree on Conant in absentia.|$|E

5|$|Making slow going amidst {{considerable}} resistance, the Australians nevertheless reached KB Mission {{late in the}} day. A {{force of}} Japanese remained <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Australians attacked with bayonets fixed. In the fighting that followed 60 Japanese were killed or wounded. The Australians were then able to firmly establish themselves at the mission. Meanwhile, the two companies from the 9th Battalion took up positions at Kilarbo and between the Gama River and Homo Creek with orders to establish blocking positions to allow the 2/12th to continue its advance the following morning.|$|E
5|$|Matilda {{presented}} {{herself as}} continuing the English tradition of centralised royal government, {{and attempted to}} maintain a government in England parallel to Stephen's, including a royal household and a chancellor. Matilda gathered revenues from the royal estates in the counties under her control, particularly in her core territories where the sheriffs were loyal to her cause. She appointed earls to rival those created by Stephen. She was unable to operate a system of royal law courts, however, and her administrative resources were extremely limited, although some of her clerks {{went on to become}} bishops in Normandy. Matilda issued two types of coins in her name during her time in England, which were used in the west of England and Wales. The first were initially minted in Oxford during her stay <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> design was then adopted by her mints at Bristol, Cardiff and Wareham after her victory at the Battle of Lincoln. A second design was minted at Bristol and Cardiff during the 1140s.|$|E
