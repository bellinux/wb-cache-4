5|$|A second {{option is}} <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> of well-watered vegetation. These two options can be {{combined}} {{with the implementation of}} green roofs. Green roofs are excellent insulators during the warm weather months and the plants cool the surrounding environment. Air quality is improved as the plants absorb carbon dioxide with concomitant production of oxygen. The city of New York determined that the cooling potential per area was highest for street trees, followed by living roofs, light covered surface, and open space planting. From the standpoint of cost effectiveness, light surfaces, light roofs, and curbside planting have lower costs per temperature reduction.|$|E
5|$|During the {{considerations}} {{prior to}} the establishment of the national park, there was a conflict with the mining industry. Svalbard Minerals had found baryte within the national park borders, and Arktikugol holds two mining claim areas just south of the national park. The national park was established on 9 September 2005. It completed a several-year-long plan <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> of protected areas of Svalbard from 55% to 65%, which had two years earlier resulted in Nordenskiöld Land National Park, Sassen – Bünsow Land National Park and Nordre Isfjorden National Park.|$|E
5|$|In 1894, the {{lighthouse}} was further altered <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> of light emitted. The four-wick burner and mirrors were exchanged for a Douglass burner with eight wicks and an improved lantern; {{the power of}} the light was increased to 35,000 candela. The characteristic of the light changed from fixed to occulting. A foghorn was also installed, with two quick blasts every five minutes. The eight-wick burner was exchanged for a three incandescent mantle burner in 1905. In 1923, the burner was replaced by a Hood petroleum vapour burner with one mantle.|$|E
40|$|Water {{contains}} {{dissolved oxygen}} that a fish needs to breathe. It is important <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>amounts</b> {{of separation of}} dissolved oxygen from water for diverse applications using the separation system. In this paper, a separation system of dissolved gases from water concurrently variable mixed with the exhalations using a compressor is proposed. This system takes use of exhalations <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>amounts</b> of separation of dissolved oxygen from water. A compressor with variable off-time and on-time is used to control the exhalations mixed with inlet water. Exhalations contain some portion of carbon dioxide, oxygen, and nitrogen. Separation of dissolved gases containing dissolved oxygen is enhanced by using exhalations. <b>The</b> <b>amounts</b> of separation and the compositions {{of carbon dioxide and}} oxygen are measured. Higher amounts of separation can make the size of the separation device smaller, and then, application areas are diversified...|$|R
30|$|The {{extension}} of the exposure period was implemented <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>amounts</b> of analyte collected, optimizing the sampling length according to {{the sensitivity of the}} technique. Therefore the duration of the campaigns in Switzerland was of about 20  days, whereas the later campaigns in Czech Republic were extended to about a month.|$|R
50|$|Heat-assisted {{magnetic}} recording is a nanophotonic approach <b>to</b> <b>increasing</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> {{of data that}} a magnetic disk drive can store. It requires a laser to heat a tiny, subwavelength area of the magnetic material before writing data. The magnetic write-head would have metal optical components to concentrate light at the right location.|$|R
5|$|Trees play a {{significant}} role in reducing erosion and moderating the climate. They remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store large quantities of carbon in their tissues. Trees and forests provide a habitat for many species of animals and plants. Tropical rainforests are one of the most biodiverse habitats in the world. Trees provide shade and shelter, timber for construction, fuel for cooking and heating, and fruit for food as well as having many other uses. In parts of the world, forests are shrinking as trees are cleared <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> of land available for agriculture. Because of their longevity and usefulness, trees have always been revered, with sacred groves in various cultures, and they play a role in many of the world's mythologies.|$|E
5|$|Flying at {{low level}} {{provided}} protection against fighters as well. Radars {{of the era}} {{did not have the}} ability to look down; if the radar were aimed down to detect targets at a lower altitude, the reflection of the ground would overwhelm the signal returned from a target. An interceptor flying at normal altitudes would be effectively blind to bombers far below it. The interceptor could descend to lower altitudes <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> of visible sky, but doing so would limit its radar range {{in the same way as}} the missile sites, as well as greatly increasing fuel use and thus reducing mission time. The Soviet Union would not introduce an interceptor with look-down capability until 1972 with the High Lark radar, and even this model had very limited capability.|$|E
5|$|Henry Washington Sawyer III (December 23, 1918 – July 31, 1999) was an American lawyer, {{civil rights}} activist, and Democratic politician. Born in Philadelphia, {{he served in}} World War II and {{attended}} the University of Pennsylvania Law School. Sawyer worked as a corporate lawyer but {{is best known for}} his advocacy of civil liberties, especially in First Amendment cases. In Abington School District v. Schempp and Lemon v. Kurtzman, he successfully argued cases before the Supreme Court of the United States that became the basis for all modern Establishment Clause jurisprudence. He pursued civil rights causes in Philadelphia and in the South during the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s. He also served a four-year term on Philadelphia City Council, where he worked for civil service reform and <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> of public art in the city.|$|E

30|$|<b>The</b> <b>increase</b> in {{re-exports}} {{is likely}} to be related to several of the main drivers of the growth in trade flows in the early 2000 s. The rise of global value chains and China’s WTO accession in 2001 (see Los et al. 2015) has probably contributed <b>to</b> <b>increasing</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> of goods dispatched to other European countries through Belgium, in particular the port of Antwerp. The introduction of the euro has probably acted as a facilitator for re-exports.|$|R
5|$|On February 16, 1965, the New York City Transit Authority {{announced}} plans to construct a subway station on the island along the planned 63rd Street Line, {{as part of the}} island's proposed transit-oriented development (TOD). TOD tries <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> of residential, business and leisure space within walking distance of public transport. With this announcements, more suggestions for {{what to do with the}} island were made. The construction of a station was viewed to be vital for the development of the island, which was still known as Welfare Island. At that point, it was decided to build a shell for the station, to allow for the station to open after the opening of the rest of the line, with a projected savings of $4 million compared to building the station as an infill station after the rest of the line opened. The projected cost of the station was $3,300,000. It was soon decided to build the station with the rest of the line.|$|E
5|$|The {{entrance}} {{was often}} the weakest part in a circuit of defences. To overcome this, the gatehouse was developed, allowing those inside the castle to control the flow of traffic. In earth and timber castles, the gateway was usually the first feature to be rebuilt in stone. The front of the gateway was a blind spot and to overcome this, projecting towers were added {{on each side of}} the gate in a style similar to that developed by the Romans. The gatehouse contained a series of defences to make a direct assault more difficult than battering down a simple gate. Typically, there were one or more portcullises– a wooden grille reinforced with metal to block a passage– and arrowslits to allow defenders to harry the enemy. The passage through the gatehouse was lengthened <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> of time an assailant had to spend under fire in a confined space and unable to retaliate.|$|E
5|$|The goal of {{each level}} {{is to protect}} Baby Mario, who rides on Yoshi's back. If Yoshi is hit by an enemy or obstacle, Baby Mario will float off into a bubble and a timer will start {{counting}} down. If the player fails to recover Baby Mario before the counter reaches zero, Baby Mario will be taken away by Koopas and Yoshi will lose a life. The timer can recover up to ten seconds, and Yoshi can collect stars <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> {{of time on the}} counter. However, if Yoshi falls into a bottomless pit, gets crushed, or comes into contact with spikes or lava, he will automatically lose a life. In some areas, players can collect a Starman that transforms Baby Mario into Super Baby Mario. During these areas, players take control of Baby Mario who, for a short period, is invincible, can run on walls and ceilings, and can float using his cape. Additionally, some areas transform Yoshi into various vehicles, such as a helicopter or digger, allowing him to reach otherwise inaccessible areas for a short amount of time.|$|E
40|$|The {{numerous}} {{benefits of}} physical activity range from improvements in bone mineral density to ameliorating the effects of aging (Table 14. 1). Not only are physically active individuals healthier, {{but they are also}} happier, live longer, sleep better, experience less pain, and have more energy and better day-to-day function. Many of these benefits can be attributed <b>to</b> simply <b>increasing</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> of moderate physical activity in one 2 ̆ 7 s day and <b>to</b> <b>increasing</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> of activity that works the heart, blood vessels, and lungs [...] the cardiovascular and respiratory systems.

40|$|More than 130 {{underfloor}} {{air distribution}} (UFAD) systems are installed in North America today, {{and that number}} is growing. In comparison to classical displacement ventilation (DV) systems that deliver air at low velocities, typical UFAD systems deliver air through floor diffusers with higher supply air velocities.

5|$|When White {{took over}} as editor, Amazings {{circulation}} was about 38,500, only about 4% of which were subscribers (as opposed to newsstand sales). This was a very low ebb for subscriptions; Analog, by comparison, sold about 35% of its circulation through subscriptions. Cohen's wife mailed out the subscription copies from home, and Cohen had never tried to increase the subscriber base as this would have increased the burden on his wife. White worked hard to increase the circulation despite Cohen's lack of support, but met with limited success. One of his first changes was to reduce the typeface <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> of fiction in the magazine. To pay for this he increased the price of both Fantastic and Amazing to 60 cents, but this had a strong negative effect on circulation, which fell about 10% from 1969 to 1970.|$|E
5|$|Empire City {{is built}} on three islands, and the player must work through main story {{missions}} on each island before being able to access the next one, though future missions may require the player to return to an earlier island. Each island is divided {{into a number of}} sectors, {{at the start of the}} game controlled by three different gangs, the Neon District being controlled by Sasha and her Reaper Gang, the Warren District being controlled by Alden and the Dust Men Gang, and the Historic District being controlled by Kessler and the First Sons. The player can undertake a side mission in each sector, once certain main story requirements have been met, to free that sector from gang control, reducing or eliminating the presence of the gang in that sector. Other side missions may also unlock medical stations where Cole will re-awaken should he die. Though Cole must travel on foot he eventually gains powers that allow him to grind along power cables and powered, elevated train rails and to hover for a short time. Scattered around the city are hundreds of 'Blast Shards' which Cole can collect <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> of electricity he can store. There are 32 'Dead Drop' satellite transmitters that help to reveal more of the back-story in the game, all being narrated by John White, or being recordings of Kessler and his experiments.|$|E

30|$|The {{coffee plant}} {{responds}} <b>to</b> <b>increasing</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> of irrigation {{as indicated by}} the responses in girth and height. However, in terms of number of primaries and number of leaves, there were no significant responses <b>to</b> <b>increasing</b> water levels and this could be attributed {{to the fact that the}} coffee plant has inherent drought tolerance habits that enable it to survive and develop under low water levels. This is explained by Hess et al. (1998) who observed that stoma of coffee are very sensitive to light and in sun-coffee systems, they close even in the abundance of water.|$|R
