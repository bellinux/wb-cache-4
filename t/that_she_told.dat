25|$|Parmenter and Hagedorn {{are among}} {{contemporary}} historian who {{have argued that}} Madame Montour was not Isabelle Couc, but rather her niece. According to this interpretation, Montour was born in an Indian village near modern Sorel, Quebec, around 1685, a year consistent with the story <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> Marshe. Her parents were Louis Couc Montour, who was the brother of Isabelle Couc, and Madeleine, a Sokoki (Western Abenaki) woman. If Madame Montour was born in 1685, her birth apparently went unrecorded, and her first name is uncertain. Her given name has also been represented as Catherine, Elisabeth/Isabelle, and Madeleine.|$|E

Nan the narrator describes the irony of her [...] "curious gaslit career" [...] as a rent-boy only to end up—in Diana's words—as her [...] "tart".

500|$|During the {{recording}} sessions, Secada confirmed that Gloria helped translate his English-language recordings into Spanish. He said <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> him to record songs {{that he would}} be comfortable with singing throughout his career as a singer. She later told Secada and Emilio to not [...] "translate everything literally" [...] but to [...] "keep the same theme of the song in play." [...] Secada wrote in his autobiography that he was [...] "grateful" [...] that he and Gloria grew up in Miami, Florida and spoke two languages. Secada said that recording in Spanish was [...] "instinctively more passionate" [...] when compared to his recordings in English, he also explained that it gave him [...] "a different connection to the music as well." [...] However, Chris Morris of Billboard, said that Secada lacked the emotional range that was present in his English-language debut album. Two of the songs [...] "Angel" [...] and the title track were originally on the English-language album as Spanish tracks. Four of the songs, including [...] "Como En Un Sueño", [...] "Tu Amor Es Mi Libertad", [...] "Cree En Nuestro Amor", and [...] "Sentir", were translated into Spanish from Secada's debut album.|$|E
500|$|Catherine de' Medici {{was closely}} {{involved}} {{in planning and}} supervising the building. De l'Orme records, for example, <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> him to take down some Ionic columns that struck her as too plain. She also insisted on large panels between the dormers {{to make room for}} inscriptions. Only a part of de l'Orme's scheme was ever built: the lower section of a central pavilion, containing an oval staircase, and a wing on either side. Though work on de l'Orme's design was abandoned in 1572, two years after his death, it is nonetheless held in high regard. According to Thomson, [...] "The surviving portions of the palace scattered between the Tuileries gardens, the courtyards of the Ecole des Beaux-Arts [...] and the Château de la Punta in Corsica show that the columns, pilasters, dormers and tabernacles of the Tuileries were the outstanding masterpieces of non-figurative French Renaissance architectural sculpture".• [...] Pons, 79. Counts Jérome and Charles Pozzo di Borgo bought sections of the ruins during the demolition of the Tuileries in 1883 and used them to construct the château de la Punta in Corsica, overlooking the gulf of Ajaccio (1885–7).|$|E
500|$|Mia Farrow, who {{had come}} and gone from the ashram before, left again and drifted around India before {{returning}} to the United States. Geoffrey Giuliano in Revolver: The Secret History of the Beatles says that, before leaving, she told the Beatles that the Maharishi had made a pass at her. Ned Wynn, one of Farrow's childhood friends, wrote in his 1990 memoir that she had told him in the early 1970s that the Maharishi had definitely made sexual passes at her. In her 1993 autobiography, Cooke de Herrera wrote that Farrow had confided to her, before the arrival of the Beatles, that the Maharishi had made a pass during a private puja ceremony by stroking her hair. Cooke de Herrera wrote <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> Farrow that she had misinterpreted the Maharishi's actions. Farrow's 1997 memoirs are ambiguous, describing an encounter with the Maharishi in his private meditation [...] "cave" [...] when he tried to put his arms around her. She reports that her sister Prudence told her that it was [...] "an honour" [...] and [...] "a tradition" [...] for a [...] "holy man" [...] to touch someone after meditation.|$|E
