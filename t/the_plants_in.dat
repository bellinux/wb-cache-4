Plants from Wilsons Promontory were sensitive. The resistance of plants from Flinders Island is unknown. The small size of the stand renders it vulnerable to eradication.|$|E

5|$|Onions may {{be grown}} from seed or from sets. Onion seeds are {{short-lived}} and fresh seeds germinate better. The seeds are sown thinly in shallow drills, thinning <b>the</b> <b>plants</b> <b>in</b> stages. In suitable climates, certain cultivars can be sown {{in late summer}} and autumn to overwinter {{in the ground and}} produce early crops the following year. Onion sets are produced by sowing seed thickly in early summer in poor soil and the small bulbs produced are harvested in the autumn. These bulbs are planted the following spring and grow into mature bulbs later in the year. Certain cultivars are used for this purpose and these may not have such good storage characteristics as those grown directly from seed.|$|E

5|$|Roridula has a {{more complex}} {{relationship}} with its prey. <b>The</b> <b>plants</b> <b>in</b> this genus produce sticky leaves with resin-tipped glands that look {{similar to those of}} larger Drosera. However, the resin, unlike mucilage, is unable to carry digestive enzymes. Therefore, Roridula species do not directly benefit from the insects they catch. Instead, they form a mutualistic symbiosis with species of assassin bugs that eat the trapped insects. The plant benefits from the nutrients in the bugs' feces.|$|E
5|$|Mining {{started on}} 7 July 1910, {{with the first}} ore train being run on 13 July. The first shipload left Kirkenes on 11 October, but SS Bengal sank with the first shipment. In 1911, the system {{exported}} 330,000 tonnes of ore. The railway was also used for transporting workers, with trains running from the towns to <b>the</b> <b>plants</b> <b>in</b> the morning and returning after the working day was over. Prior to private cars becoming common, the railway operated a passenger carriage on the trains between Kirkenes and Bjørnevatn—allowing free travel. The railway has never had any scheduled or public transport of passengers, but the company's concession specifies that the authorities could {{at a later date}} require the company to operate public passenger services under specified conditions.|$|E
5|$|The road {{remains largely}} {{as it was}} on opening day, though <b>the</b> <b>plants</b> <b>in</b> its median {{have given way to}} a steel guard rail, and most {{recently}} to concrete barriers, and it now carries the designation State Route 110, not historic U.S. Route 66. Between 1954 and 2010, it was officially designated the Pasadena Freeway. In 2010, as part of plans to revitalize its scenic value and improve safety, the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) restored the original name to the roadway. All the bridges built during parkway construction remain, as do four older bridges that crossed the Arroyo Seco before the 1930s. The Arroyo Seco Parkway is designated a State Scenic Highway, National Civil Engineering Landmark, and National Scenic Byway. It was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 2011.|$|E

5|$|Thousands {{of plant}} species are {{cultivated}} for aesthetic purposes {{as well as}} to provide shade, modify temperatures, reduce wind, abate noise, provide privacy, and prevent soil erosion. Plants are the basis of a multibillion-dollar per year tourism industry, which includes travel to historic gardens, national parks, rainforests, forests with colorful autumn leaves, and festivals such as Japan's and America's cherry blossom festivals. While some gardens are planted with food crops, many are planted for aesthetic, ornamental, or conservation purposes. Arboretums and botanical gardens are public collections of living plants. In private outdoor gardens, lawn grasses, shade trees, ornamental trees, shrubs, vines, herbaceous perennials and bedding plants are used. Gardeners may cultivate <b>the</b> <b>plants</b> <b>in</b> a naturalistic state, or may sculpture their growth, as with topiary or espalier. Gardening is the most popular leisure activity in the U.S., and working with plants or horticulture therapy is beneficial for rehabilitating people with disabilities. Plants may also be grown or kept indoors as houseplants, or in specialized buildings such as greenhouses that are designed for the care and cultivation of living plants. Venus Flytrap, sensitive plant and resurrection plant are examples of plants sold as novelties. There are also art forms specializing in the arrangement of cut or living plant, such as bonsai, ikebana, and the arrangement of cut or dried flowers. Ornamental plants have sometimes changed the course of history, as in tulipomania.|$|E
5|$|Trillium grandiflorum {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular trilliums in cultivation, {{primarily}} because of the size of its flowers and its relative ease of cultivation. Although not particularly demanding, its cultivation is a slow and rather uncertain process, due to usually slow growth, wide variations in growth speed and sometimes capricious germination rates. As a result, the vast majority of plants and rhizomes in commerce are collected in the wild, and such heavy collecting, combined with other pressures such as habitat destruction and grazing, may effectively endanger <b>the</b> <b>plants</b> <b>in</b> some areas. This also creates tensions between Trillium enthusiasts and conservation proponents. Transplantation (as with almost all non-weedy wild plants) is a delicate process, and in many cases results in the death of the plant. In cultivation, T. grandiflorum may flower in as little as 4 to 5 years after germination (compared to the usual 7 to 10 in the wild), but these cases appear to be exceptions rather than the rule. One study revealed 20 or so individuals performing so well out of about 10,000 seeds planted, only 20% of which germinated after a year. However, barring plant destruction, T. grandiflorum can continue flowering every year after it has begun.|$|E
25|$|Net primary {{production}} is {{the rate at}} which all <b>the</b> <b>plants</b> <b>in</b> an ecosystem produce net useful chemical energy; it is equal to the difference between {{the rate at which}} <b>the</b> <b>plants</b> <b>in</b> an ecosystem produce useful chemical energy (GPP) and the rate at which they use some of that energy during respiration. Some net {{primary production}} goes toward growth and reproduction of primary producers, while some is consumed by herbivores.|$|E

25|$|The IRRI {{project was}} {{terminated}} in 2001 because of budget cuts, but the Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences (YAAS) in Kunming has continued the research.

25|$|Due to {{the unique}} climate of San Francisco and Golden Gate Park, <b>the</b> <b>plants</b> <b>in</b> the San Francisco Botanical Garden range {{from a variety of}} {{different}} national origins, some of them no longer existing in their natural habitats.

In addition, some native California species are housed in the garden as well, such as Redwood trees. Overall, the tradition of these diverse gardens that eventually served to inspire the San Francisco Botanical Garden comes originally from China, Europe, and Mexico.|$|E
