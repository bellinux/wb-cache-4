50|$|Cannon pinion - a pinion with {{a hollow}} shaft that fits {{friction}} tight over the center wheel shaft, projects through the face, {{and holds the}} minute hand. While the timepiece is not being set, this is <b>turned</b> <b>by</b> the center wheel, and drives the minute wheel. While being set it is <b>turned</b> <b>by</b> the setting mechanism, in modern clocks a setting knob {{on the back of}} the clock. In watches during setting this is <b>turned</b> <b>by</b> the minute wheel, which is <b>turned</b> <b>by</b> the keyless work. In older clocks the setting was done by opening the face and manually pushing the minute hand, which rotated the cannon pinion directly.|$|R

5|$|Menkauhor ruled for {{possibly}} {{eight or}} nine years, following king Nyuserre Ini, and was succeeded in <b>turn</b> <b>by</b> Djedkare Isesi. Although Menkauhor is well attested by historical sources, few artifacts from his reign have survived. Consequently, his familial relation to his predecessor and successor is unclear, and no offspring of his have been identified. Khentkaus III may have been Menkauhor's mother, as indicated by evidence discovered in her tomb in 2015.|$|E
5|$|The Crown Prince and Princess {{shared the}} outlook of the Progressive Party, and Bismarck was {{haunted by the}} fear that should the old Emperor dieand he was now in his seventiesthey would call {{on one of the}} Progressive leaders to become Chancellor.

5|$|The contact call {{is a very}} quiet, {{thin and}} high-pitched sit, but the most {{distinctive}} call is a penetrating tsree, with a vibrato quality, sometimes repeated {{as a series of}} notes.

5|$|The hypothalamic–pituitary–thyroid axis plays a {{key role}} in {{maintaining}} thyroid hormone levels within normal limits. Production of TSH by the anterior pituitary gland is stimulated in <b>turn</b> <b>by</b> thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), released from the hypothalamus. Production of TSH and TRH is decreased by thyroxine by a negative feedback process. Not enough TRH, which is uncommon, can lead to not enough TSH and thereby to not enough thyroid hormone production.|$|E

5|$|After {{involving}} {{itself in}} the Seven Years' War and the American Revolutionary War, France found itself financially ruined. Attempts to pass an economic plan to alleviate this in the Estates-General of 1789 led instead to the third estate—the commoners—forking to form the National Assembly. Succeeded in <b>turn</b> <b>by</b> the National Constituent Assembly and the Legislative Assembly, the various legislative bodies succeeded in rendering the monarchy constitutional, limited by democratic institutions. Attempts to remove the monarch entirely, although thwarted on 20 June 1792, led to the effective overthrow of Louis XVI on 10 August. On 21 October, France was formally declared a republic.|$|E
5|$|Each June, on Garter Day, {{the members}} of the Order, wearing their habits and garter insignia, meet at Windsor Castle. When any new Knights of the Garter are due for installation, an {{investiture}} ceremony is held in the Throne Room of Windsor Castle on the morning of Garter Day. This ceremony is attended by all Knights Companions of the order, wearing the ceremonial habits and garter insignia, and also by their wives. The wording of the oath sworn by the new knights at this ceremony and of the Admonitions addressed to them in <b>turn</b> <b>by</b> the prelate and chancellor of the order when the several items of insignia are placed upon them are extremely similar to the traditions of the past.|$|E
5|$|In the present, {{during the}} re-dedication ceremony, Mulder realizes {{that no one}} can see Teager if they are in his line of sight. Teager follows Skinner and Bloch to the motorcade, where he unsuccessfully shoots at the general and Skinner suffers a flesh wound. Teager is shot in <b>turn</b> <b>by</b> the agents as he tries to escape. As he succumbs to his wounds, Teager repeats his Army identification. Afterwards, the Pentagon states that the assassin was a {{different}} person—which Mulder denounces as a lie. He leaves Skinner to silently ponder his own service in the Vietnam War as he looks upon Teager's name on the memorial wall.|$|E

5|$|Other {{significant}} palaces {{along the}} Strand include Worcester House, formerly the Inn, or residence, of the Bishop of Carlisle, Salisbury House, used for royal lodgings in the 15th and 16th centuries, Hungerford House, which was demolished and replaced, in <b>turn,</b> <b>by</b> Hungerford Market and Charing Cross station and Northumberland House, a large Jacobean mansion, the historic London {{residence of the}} Dukes of Northumberland; built in 1605 and demolished in 1874. Northumberland Avenue now occupies the site. The official residence of the Secretary of State, next door at No.1 the Strand, became the first numbered address in London.|$|E
5|$|Saint Botolph {{began to}} build his monastery at Icanho, now {{conclusively}} identified as Iken, Suffolk, in the year that Anna was killed, possibly to commemorate the king. Anna was succeeded in <b>turn</b> <b>by</b> his two brothers Æthelhere and Æthelwold, who may have ruled jointly. It is possible that Æthelhere was set up as a puppet ruler by Penda or was his ally, as {{he was one of}} the 30 duces that accompanied Penda when he attacked Oswiu of Northumbria at an unidentified location called the Winwæd in 655 or 656. Penda himself was killed at the Winwæd, after having steadily increased his power over a period of 13 years. Æthelhere (who was also slain at the Battle of the Winwæd) and Æthelwold were succeeded by the descendants of Anna's youngest brother, Æthelric.|$|E
5|$|Thanatos– The former God of Death, {{father of}} Erinys, and main {{antagonist}} of Ghost of Sparta. Ruler of the Domain of Death, Thanatos {{is responsible for}} imprisoning and torturing Kratos' brother Deimos. While Kratos and Deimos were battling, Thanatos snatched Deimos from the battle and dropped him {{on the edge of}} a cliff. Deimos was saved by Kratos, who united with his brother to fight the God of Death, who transformed into a winged beast. Thanatos mocked Kratos for Ares' mistaken decision and eventually killed Deimos, but was killed in <b>turn</b> <b>by</b> an angered Kratos. The character was voiced by Arthur Burghardt in Ghost of Sparta.|$|E

5|$|The Silence of the Lambs, a film {{adaptation}} of Harris' next Lecter novel, {{was released in}} 1991. However, none of the cast of Manhunter reprise their roles in the later film, although actors Frankie Faison and Dan Butler appear in both films as different and unrelated characters. The Silence of the Lambs earned several awards and accolades, including the Academy Award for Best Picture. It {{is one of only}} three films to have won the Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor and Actress, and Best Screenplay. The Silence of the Lambs was followed in <b>turn</b> <b>by</b> a sequel and two prequels: Hannibal, Red Dragon and Hannibal Rising, plus an NBC television series, Hannibal.|$|E
5|$|The castle design {{formed an}} inner and an outer ward, {{surrounded}} in <b>turn</b> <b>by</b> a moat, now partially filled. The main {{entrance to the}} castle was the Gate next the Sea, next to the castle's tidal dock that allowed it to be supplied directly by sea. The dock was protected by a wall later named the Gunners Walk and a firing platform that may have housed a trebuchet siege engine during the medieval period. The Gate next the Sea led into an outer barbican, protected by a drawbridge, arrow slits and murder-holes, leading on into the outer ward.|$|E
5|$|The redox {{reactions}} catalyzed by oxidoreductases {{are vital}} {{in all parts}} of metabolism, but one particularly important area where these reactions occur is in the release of energy from nutrients. Here, reduced compounds such as glucose and fatty acids are oxidized, thereby releasing energy. This energy is transferred to NAD by reduction to NADH, as part of beta oxidation, glycolysis, and the citric acid cycle. In eukaryotes the electrons carried by the NADH that is produced in the cytoplasm are transferred into the mitochondrion (to reduce mitochondrial NAD) by mitochondrial shuttles, such as the malate-aspartate shuttle. The mitochondrial NADH is then oxidized in <b>turn</b> <b>by</b> the electron transport chain, which pumps protons across a membrane and generates ATP through oxidative phosphorylation. These shuttle systems also have the same transport function in chloroplasts.|$|E
