5|$|Despite {{the many}} western {{travelers}} coming into China {{to live and}} trade, many travelers, mainly religious monks, recorded the strict border laws <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Chinese</b> enforced. As the monk Xuanzang and many other monk travelers attested to, there were many Chinese government checkpoints along the Silk Road that examined travel permits into the Tang Empire. Furthermore, banditry was a problem along the checkpoints and oasis towns, as Xuanzang also recorded that his group of travelers were assaulted by bandits on multiple occasions.|$|E

On 24 August, the Portuguese Governor of Macao, Don Adraio Accacio da Silveira Pinto, announced <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Chinese</b> had ordered him to expel the British from the colony. He warned Lancelot Dent of the British hong Dent & Co. <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Chinese</b> planned to seize the British dwellings in Macao. On 25 August, former Superintendent John Astell proposed to Elliot that all British boats should evacuate to Hong Kong. By {{the end of the}} month, 2,000 people in over 60 ships were in Hong Kong harbour without fresh food or water. The ships held European merchants, lascars, and dozens of British families. The 28-gun frigate Volage of Captain Henry Smith sailed to Hong Kong on 30 August. Smith was an old friend of Elliot from their service in the West Indies Station. Elliot warned Kowloon officials that there was bound to be trouble if the embargo continued against the merchant fleet.|$|E
5|$|Problems {{continued}} to crop up. Many Chinese Malayan youths {{drafted into the}} army to stave off communist attacks fled the country; most participants were English- and not Chinese-educated.

5|$|Chiang {{ran into}} stiff {{opposition}} from his officers, including the powerful Chief of Staff of the Military Affairs Commission He Yingqin, the Deputy Chief of Staff Bai Chongxi, {{the head of}} the Fifth War Zone Li Zongren, and his German advisor Alexander von Falkenhausen.

The Hong Kong Daily News held a positive view of Hawaii's treatment of existing Chinese laborers, but stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Chinese</b> government needed to provide financial assistance for family emigration to Hawaii.

Lansdale hired counterfeiters to produce bogus Viet Minh leaflets on how to behave under communist rule, advising them to create a list of their material possessions so that the communists {{would be able to}} confiscate them more easily, thereby fomenting peasant discontent.|$|E
5|$|Movable type: The polymath {{scientist}} and official Shen Kuo (1031–1095) of the Song Dynasty (960–1279) {{was the first}} to describe the process of movable type printing in his Dream Pool Essays of 1088. He attributed the innovation of reusable fired clay characters to a little-known artisan named Bi Sheng (990–1051). Bi had experimented with wooden type characters, but their use was not perfected until 1297 to 1298 with the model of the official Wang Zhen (fl. 1290–1333) of the Yuan Dynasty (1271–1368), who also arranged written characters by rhyme scheme on the surface of round table compartments.

The 1st ROK Division troops were ordered off the positions on Queen, Bak, and Hill 179 when heavy enemy assaults divested them of their tactical value.

Apparently the usurpation of kings caused little tumult or crisis in this state, as Barros noted any leader there was believed by the locals not to have divine right to rule if he was able to be killed by a royal kinsman. Historian Mark Dion notes that Fernão related the same story in his writing, only adding that a Muslim in their society was the only acceptable replacement as ruler.|$|E
