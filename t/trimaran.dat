25|$|Austal has {{proposed}} a much smaller and slower <b>trimaran,</b> called the 'Multi Role Vessel' (MRV 80). Though it is only {{half the size of}} their LCS design, it would still be useful for border protection and counter piracy operations.|$|E

25|$|Officially {{designated}} as mine destructor vessels, the Cybele class {{was a large}} <b>trimaran</b> vessel, constructed using a steel lattice truss framework. They were intended to be towed through minefields that used pressure mines, creating a pressure wave that would detonate the mines; the open lattice construction of the ships would, according to the design, allow the blast {{to pass through the}} vessel without causing damage to it.|$|E
25|$|The first {{design of}} the five {{presented}} was of <b>trimaran</b> type, but was rejected due to the noisy of its propulsion system, a great disadvantage since it is looking to develop an antisubmarine boat and will be seven centimeters shorter than the F-100 but will have a greater sleeve, (30 m against 18.6 of the Alvaro de Bazán). It will serve both to participate in humanitarian and warlike missions. The superstructure of the vessel will be integrated and is not yet defined if it will carry an AEGIS system with an AN / SPY-1 radar of versions D (V), carried by the Spanish frigate Cristóbal Colón (F-105) or F (V) model carried by the Norwegian frigates of the Fridtjof Nansen class or of another type, although the company intends to install any type of product that future customers require. What is certain is that the SCOMBA system will be installed.|$|E

2500|$|The Independence-class design began life at Austal as a {{platform}} for a high-speed cruise ship. [...] The principal requirements of that project were speed, stability and passenger comfort, and Austal's team determined that the <b>trimaran</b> hull form offered significant passenger comfort and stability advantages over both a catamaran and a monohull. [...] The high-speed cruise ship project evolved into Austal's commercial high-speed <b>trimaran</b> ferry [...] The ships are [...] long, with a beam of , and a draft of [...] Their displacement is rated at 2,176 tons light, 2,784 tons full, and 608 tons deadweight.|$|E
2500|$|For the 33rd America's Cup, {{both the}} defender and the {{challenger}} built [...] long multihulls. Société Nautique de Genève, defending with team Alinghi, sailed a catamaran. The challenger, BMW Oracle Racing, used a <b>trimaran,</b> replacing its soft sail rig with a towering wing sail—the largest sailing wing ever built. In {{the waters off}} Valencia, Spain in February 2010, the BMW Oracle Racing <b>trimaran</b> with its powerful wing sail proved to be superior. This represented {{a break from the}} traditional monohulls that had always been sailed in previous America's Cup series.|$|E

50|$|Horizontal articulation: Dragonfly <b>Trimarans</b> use {{a nearly}} {{horizontal}} articulation called SwingWing. The slight angle makes the floats fold into the narrower, {{lower part of}} the central hull and also increases stability when in the folded position. A similar horizontal articulation design is also used in the Seaon 96CRB. This kind of system was first used in Ocean Bird <b>trimarans</b> designed by John Westell and built by Honnor Marine Ltd of Totnes.|$|R
