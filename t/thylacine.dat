5|$|The {{marsupial}} fauna of Australia and the placental mammals of the Old World {{have several}} strikingly similar forms, developed in two clades, isolated from each other. The body {{and especially the}} skull shape of the <b>thylacine</b> (Tasmanian wolf) converged with those of Canidae such as the red fox, Vulpes vulpes.|$|E
5|$|There are few native natural predators of emus still alive. Early in its species history it {{may have}} faced {{numerous}} terrestrial predators now extinct, including the giant lizard Megalania, the <b>thylacine,</b> and possibly other carnivorous marsupials, which may explain their seemingly well-developed ability to defend themselves from terrestrial predators. The main predator of emus today is the dingo, which was originally introduced by Aboriginals {{thousands of years ago}} from a stock of semi-domesticated wolves. Dingoes try to kill the emu by attacking the head. The emu typically tries to repel the dingo by jumping into the air and kicking or stamping the dingo on its way down. The emu jumps as the dingo barely has the capacity to jump high enough to threaten its neck, so a correctly timed leap to coincide with the dingo's lunge can keep its head and neck out of danger.|$|E

50|$|Further work in 2012 {{examined}} {{the relationship of the}} genetic diversity of the <b>thylacines</b> before their extinction. The results indicated that the last of the <b>thylacines</b> in Australia, on top of the threats from dingoes, had limited genetic diversity, due to their complete geographic isolation from mainland Australia.|$|R

40|$|All {{disputes}} are asymmetrical in some sense. It {{is harder}} to prove a negative than to prove a positive. The burden of proof is on the person making an assertion or challenging {{the status quo and}} so forth. Quine points out that disputes about ontology seem asymmetrical in a way that doesn't come up in other kinds of dispute. When two people disagree about what kinds of thing there are, they must each describe the nature of their disagreement in a different way. The person who thinks there are examples of a certain kind of thing, for example, <b>thylacines,</b> can describe the dispute by saying &quot;I think there are <b>thylacines</b> but my opponent does not&quot;. <b>Thylacines</b> are Tasmanian Tigers, by the way, and though there have been reported sightings of them as recently as 2005, the last one died in captivity in the 1930 s (as far as we know). But the person arguing for the negative cannot describe the case that way, at least not if they are self-conscious enough to think about the meaning of their utterance. They cannot say &quot;My opponent thinks there are <b>thylacines,</b> but I do not &quot; because if ther...|$|R
25|$|In 2002, geneticists at the Australian Museum {{announced}} that they had replicated DNA of the <b>thylacine</b> (Tasmanian tiger), at the time extinct for about 65 years, using polymerase chain reaction. However, on 15 February 2005 the museum {{announced that}} it was stopping the project after tests showed the specimens' DNA had been too badly degraded by the (ethanol) preservative. On 15 May 2005 it was announced that the <b>thylacine</b> project would be revived, with new participation from researchers in New South Wales and Victoria.|$|E

25|$|The {{island of}} Tasmania {{was home to}} the <b>thylacine,</b> a {{marsupial}} which resembled a Fossa (animal) or some say a wild dog. Known colloquially as the Tasmanian tiger for the distinctive striping across its back, it became extinct in mainland Australia much earlier because of competition by the dingo, introduced in prehistoric times. Owing to persecution by farmers, government-funded bounty hunters and, in the final years, collectors for overseas museums, {{it appears to have}} been exterminated in Tasmania. The Tasmanian devil became the largest carnivorous marsupial in the world following the extinction of the <b>thylacine</b> in 1936, and is now found in the wild only in Tasmania. Tasmania {{was one of the last}} regions of Australia to be introduced to domesticated dogs. Dogs were brought from Britain in 1803 for hunting kangaroos and emus. This introduction completely transformed Aboriginal society, as it helped them to successfully compete with European hunters, and was more important than the introduction of guns for the Aboriginals.|$|E

25|$|The {{island of}} Tasmania {{was home to}} the <b>thylacine,</b> a {{marsupial}} which resembled a wild dog. Known colloquially as the Tasmanian tiger for the distinctive striping across its back, it became extinct in mainland Australia about 4,000 years ago because of competition by the introduced dingo. Owing to persecution by farmers, government-funded bounty hunters and, in the final years, collectors for overseas museums, {{it appears to have}} been exterminated in Tasmania.|$|E
25|$|The {{species is}} not {{closely related to}} other extant marsupials; the current {{arrangement}} in the order Dasyuromorphia places its monotypic family with the diverse and carnivorous species of Dasyuridae. A closer affinity with the extinct <b>thylacine,</b> contained in the same order, has been proposed. Genetic studies have shown the ancestors of the numbat diverged from other marsupials between 32 and 42 million years ago, during the late Eocene.|$|E
25|$|Far {{more recent}} {{possible}} or presumed extinctions of species which {{may turn out}} still to exist include the <b>thylacine,</b> or Tasmanian tiger (Thylacinus cynocephalus), the last known example of which died in Hobart Zoo in Tasmania in 1936; the Japanese wolf (Canis lupus hodophilax), last sighted over 100 years ago; the ivory-billed woodpecker (Campephilus principalis), last sighted for certain in 1944; and the slender-billed curlew (Numenius tenuirostris), not seen since 2007.|$|E
50|$|The cave {{has been}} studied for over a century. It has yielded fossils of Pleistocene fauna over 35,000 years old, {{including}} those of <b>thylacines</b> and the giant marsupial herbivore Zygomaturus.|$|R
50|$|<b>Thylacines,</b> uniquely for marsupials, {{have largely}} {{cartilaginous}} epipubic bones {{with a highly}} reduced osseous element. This has been once considered a synapomorphy with sparassodonts, though its now thought that both groups reduced their epipubics independently.|$|R
50|$|Phylogenetic {{analysis}} shows that <b>thylacines</b> are a clade {{which does not}} include the dasyurids. Badjcinus {{was one of the most}} primitive members of its group, living 23 to 28 million years ago in the late Oligocene.|$|R
25|$|The native mammal fauna of New Guinea lacks large predators. The {{carnivorous}} marsupials, Dasyuromorphia, of New Guinea are all {{small in}} comparison to Australian species, and most are insectivorous. The largest is the bronze quoll (Dasyurus spartacus), a rare quoll, first discovered in southern New Guinea in 1979. It reaches a snout to vent length of 36 centimetres (14.2in). Fossils of larger marsupials have been found, including the carnivorous <b>thylacine</b> (Thylacinus sp.), however evidence of carnivorous megafauna, such as the marsupial lion (Thylacoleo), has not been found.|$|E
25|$|In 1970, the W-series {{plates were}} {{replaced}} by the AA·0000 to FS 9999 series with blue lettering on a white background. From 1970 to 1976 these had the slogan TAS and from 1976 to 1998, Tasmania – Holiday Isle. Between 1998 and 2004, the border colour switched to turquoise with the slogan Tasmania – Your Natural State, with a coloured decal of the Tasmanian state logo in the background (a stylised <b>thylacine</b> prowling through reeds on a riverbank). The update started at DS 0000. In 2004, the series reverted to the original blue borders, while retaining the other 1998 revisions.|$|E
25|$|The <b>thylacine</b> was {{exclusively}} carnivorous. Its {{stomach was}} muscular, and could distend {{to allow the}} animal to eat large amounts of food at one time, probably an adaptation to compensate for long periods when hunting was unsuccessful and food scarce. Analysis of the skeletal frame and observations of it in captivity suggest that it preferred to single out a target animal and pursue that animal until it was exhausted. Some studies conclude that the animal may have hunted in small family groups, with the main group herding prey {{in the general direction}} of an individual waiting in ambush. Trappers reported it as an ambush predator.|$|E
50|$|It {{was always}} {{possible}} {{to make a few}} shillings on the side after the government introduced a bounty scheme for trapping and killing Tasmanian tigers (<b>thylacines)</b> in 1888, with a number of claims being made upon the government by settlers in the Levendale area.|$|R
5000|$|The zoo {{was home}} to the only living quagga ever to be photographed, before the species became extinct in the wild due to hunting in {{southern}} Africa in about 1870. Another now extinct species the zoo held was a number of <b>thylacines,</b> or [...] "Tasmanian tigers".|$|R
50|$|Native fauna {{advisory}} committees {{began to be}} established to address the concern of rapidly dwindling populations {{of a number of}} mammal species. In 1928, the Tasmanian Advisory Committee for Native Fauna had recommended a reserve to protect any remaining <b>thylacines,</b> with potential sites of suitable habitat including the Arthur-Pieman area of western Tasmania. This was also the beginning of a Tasmanian wilderness movement.|$|R
25|$|The {{greatest}} {{population density}} for Aborigines {{developed in the}} southern and eastern regions, the River Murray valley in particular. Aborigines lived and used resources on the continent sustainably, agreeing to cease hunting and gathering at particular times to give populations and resources the chance to replenish. The arrival of Australia's first people nevertheless affected the continent significantly, and, along with climate change, {{may have contributed to}} the extinction of Australia's megafauna. The practice of firestick farming amongst northern Aborigines to increase the abundance of plants that attracted animals, transformed dry rainforest into savanna. The introduction of the dingo by Aboriginal people around 3,000–4,000 years ago may, along with human hunting, have contributed to the extinction of the <b>thylacine,</b> Tasmanian devil, and Tasmanian native-hen from mainland Australia.|$|E
500|$|The <b>thylacine</b> ( [...] , or [...] , also Thylacinus cynocephalus) was {{the largest}} known {{carnivorous}} marsupial of modern times. It {{is commonly known as}} the Tasmanian tiger (because of its striped lower back) or the Tasmanian wolf.|$|E
500|$|The tammar {{rests in}} two positions: a [...] "sitting tail forward" [...] position, {{in which the}} hind legs are outstretched with tail brought forward in between, the body prone and the head above ground; and a [...] "lying" [...] position, in which the animal lies on its side with the head {{touching}} the ground. The former position is typically used during the day for long periods, and the latter position is used at night for brief periods. Tammars are known to live in stable groups, which lessens the chance of an individual being taken by a predator. As the group increases in size, tammars spend more time foraging, grooming and interacting and less time being vigilant and moving around. Predators of the tammar include dingos, feral cats, red foxes and wedge-tailed eagles. They {{may also have been}} preyed upon by the extinct <b>thylacine.</b> Tammars appear to respond more to the sight than the sound of predators. They can also use their acute sense of smell to detect a predator. When a predator is detected, a tammar will alert others by thumping its foot. When lost, young tammars are known to emit a coarse screeching call and adult females may respond with a similar call.|$|E
50|$|Only placentals, and {{possibly}} the early mammaliformes Megazostrodon and Erythrotherium, lack them; in <b>thylacines</b> and sparassodonts, {{they appear to have}} become primarily cartilaginous and the osseous element has become strongly reduced or even absent. Trichosurus mimicked placentals in shifting hypaxial muscles attachment sites from the epipubic to the pelvis, losing the respiratory benefits (see below), but otherwise retains large epipubics.|$|R
50|$|Although {{there had}} been a {{conservation}} movement pressing for the <b>thylacine's</b> protection since 1901, driven in part by the increasing difficulty in obtaining specimens for overseas collections, political difficulties prevented any form of protection coming into force until 1936. Official protection of the species by the Tasmanian government was introduced on 10 July 1936, 59 days before the last known specimen died in captivity.|$|R
50|$|Marsupials are any {{members of}} the {{mammalian}} infraclass Marsupialia. All extant marsupials are endemic to Australasia and the Americas. A distinctive characteristic common to these species {{is that most of}} the young are carried in a pouch. Well-known marsupials include kangaroos, wallabies, koalas, possums, opossums, wombats, Tasmanian devils, and the recently extinct <b>thylacines.</b> Others include the numbat, the bandicoot, the bettong, the bilby, the quoll, the quokka, and the Potoroo.|$|R
