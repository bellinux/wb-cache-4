5000|$|In the United States, the BATF {{has ruled}} that since the sound waves are not {{dampened}} and are metered at the same levels at <b>two</b> <b>measuring</b> <b>points</b> (1 m {{to the left and}} 0 m in front of the muzzle and 1 m left and 5 m forward of the muzzle) this is not a sound suppressing device. The only action which a muzzle shroud performs is shielding the area directly behind the muzzle from the worst blast pressures. Muzzle brakes direct the escaping gases rearward toward the shooter, thus increasing blast pressure directed toward the operator's ears. The same principle that lessens felt recoil also acts to enhance the sound levels reaching the shooter. Some of the muzzle brakes designed for heavy-caliber rifles (.338 Lapua, [...]408 CheyTac, [...]50 BMG) incorporate [...] "blast shields" [...] projecting laterally from the sides of the muzzle crown. Thus, reflecting sound waves traveling rearward via the muzzle brake blast chambers. These small leaves, however, do not fully enclose the muzzle diameter, and so block only the worst blast path, while allowing the majority of escaping gases to circumvent the shield by traveling around them, still reaching the shooter's ears, causing unacceptable hearing damage.|$|E

The real measurements are an average value with an associated confidence interval of ten repeated measurements. The <b>two</b> <b>measuring</b> <b>points</b> are located in a laboratory sample. A Universal robot was used to manipulate the sample {{to ensure that the}} identical points are examined by the ultrasound testing system. The specification states that this type of robot has a repeatability of ±  0.1  mm [24]. The resulting amplitude images were then evaluated and averaged according to the amplitude or integral energy evaluation. The deviations between a seam completely filled with adhesive and air in the simulation were not achieved in the real measurements, but the difference in the integral energy evaluation is greater. This justifies a higher probability of finding even small defects and a better contrast when using the integral energy evaluation. The smaller confidence intervals in the integral energy method demonstrate the greater robustness of this evaluation method.|$|E

The simulation approach consisted of two parts. In the first part, the reference 131 I TIAC was determined. More precisely, a reference 124 I ACs at 24  h after administration was selected (first input parameter); the reference 124 I ACs at 120  h was calculated using an assumed effective 124 I half-life (second input parameter). In the second part, we applied identical relative uncertainties for the two 124 I ACs as a first-order estimate. The AC uncertainty was expressed in a form of a percentage SD (third input parameter). Assuming a normal distribution for the 124 I ACs allowed us to simulate the 131 I TIAC distribution of the percentage difference from the reference 131 I TIAC for different levels of relative SD of 124 I AC for each 124 I effective half-life. Similarly, the percentage SD of 131 I TIAC derived from the simulated TIAC distribution served as relative uncertainty in the TIAC determination.|$|R

The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate the relation between iodine-creatinine ratio (ICR) at <b>two</b> <b>measuring</b> <b>points</b> 5 years apart. Methods: Data from 2, 659 individuals from the Study of Health in Pomerania were analyzed. Analysis of covariance and Poisson regressions were used to associate baseline with follow-up ICR. Results: Baseline ICR was associated with follow-up ICR. Particularly, baseline ICR > 300 mu g/g was related to an ICR > 300 mu g/g at follow-up (relative risk, RR: 2. 20; p < 0. 001). The association was stronger in males (RR: 2. 64; p < 0. 001) than in females (RR: 1. 64; p = 0. 007). In contrast, baseline ICR < 100 mu g/g was only associated with an ICR < 100 mu g/g at follow-up in males when considering unadjusted ICR. Conclusions: We detected only a weak correlation with respect to low ICR. Studies assessing iodine status in a population should take into account that an individual with a low UI excretion in one measurement is not necessarily permanently iodine deficient. On the other hand, current high ICR could have been predicted by high ICR 5 years ago. Copyright (C) 2011 S. Karger AG, Basel...|$|E
