5|$|Although {{the numbers}} of dogs killed each year are {{relatively}} low, it induces a fear of wolves entering villages and farmyards to take dogs. In many cultures, there are strong social and emotional bonds between humans and their dogs <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> as family members or working team members. The loss of a dog can lead to strong emotional responses with demands for more liberal wolf hunting regulations.|$|E
5|$|HD 2039 is {{a stable}} G-type star, meaning it shines with white light <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> in the Sun. In terms of mass, the star {{exhibits}} almost identical properties. HD 2039 exhibits a radius approximately 40 percent {{larger than the}} Sun's. The star is slightly hotter than the Sun; while HD 2039 has a temperature of 5935 K, the Sun's surface temperature lies nearly 200 kelvins lower at 5778 K. HD 2039 is unusually metal-rich, which has {{attracted the attention of}} astrophysicists.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the 124 cast and crew members, 250 local extras were also hired. The majority of the extras were used {{as members of the}} local high school band, chorus and dramatic society <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> as the Brodys walk through the town, and during Sean's attack. A local gravestone maker produced 51 slabs for the mock graveyard used for Sean's funeral.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the many species of marine birds <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> in the Bay Area, many other species of birds make the Bay Area their home, making the region a popular destination for birdwatching. Many birds, including many described in the following paragraphs, are listed as endangered species despite once being common in the region, due to human and other impacts.|$|E
5|$|In biology, natural {{selection}} {{can cause the}} development of patterns in living things for several reasons, including camouflage, sexual selection, and different kinds of signalling, including mimicry and cleaning symbiosis. In plants, the shapes, colours, and patterns of insect-pollinated flowers like the lily have evolved to attract insects such as bees. Radial patterns of colours and stripes, some visible only in ultraviolet light serve as nectar guides <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> at a distance.|$|E

5|$|The American Bird Conservancy {{designated}} Whitefish Point a Globally Important Bird Area. Whitefish Point's {{land and}} water features create a natural corridor that funnels thousands of birds during spring and fall migrations, providing unique opportunities for research, education, and conservation programs. Golden eagles, peregrine falcons, merlins, boreal owls, great gray owls, red-throated loons, red-necked grebes, scoters, and jaegers (also known as skuas) {{are just some of}} the birds <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> during migration.|$|E
5|$|The Precambrian gneiss and schist {{that make}} up the {{majority}} of the steep walls of the Black Canyon formed 1.7 billion years ago during a metamorphic period brought on by the collision of ancient volcanic island arcs with the southern end of what is present-day Wyoming.

5|$|The {{original}} {{name came}} from the 'Burne' or stream which ran through today's Old Town area of Eastbourne. All <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> of the Burne, or Bourne, is the small pond in Motcombe Gardens. The bubbling source is guarded by a statue of Neptune. Motcombe Gardens are overlooked by St. Mary's Church, a Norman church which allegedly lies {{on the site of}} a Saxon ‘moot’, or meeting place. This gives Motcombe its name.|$|E

5|$|A {{dust devil}} (also {{known as a}} whirlwind) resembles a tornado {{in that it is}} a {{vertical}} swirling column of air. However, they form under clear skies and are no stronger than the weakest tornadoes. They form when a strong convective updraft is formed near the ground on a hot day. If there is enough low level wind shear, the column of hot, rising air can develop a small cyclonic motion <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> near the ground. They are not considered tornadoes because they form during fair weather and are not associated with any clouds. However, they can, on occasion, result in major damage.|$|E
5|$|A {{subsequent}} caldera-forming eruption occurred about 160,000 years ago. It {{formed the}} relatively small caldera that contains the West Thumb of Yellowstone Lake. Since the last supereruption, a series of smaller eruptive cycles between 640,000 and 70,000years ago, has nearly filled in the Yellowstone Caldera with 80 different eruptions of rhyolitic lavas such as those <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> at Obsidian Cliffs and basaltic lavas which can be viewed at Sheepeater Cliff. Lava strata are most easily seen at the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone, where the Yellowstone River continues to carve into the ancient lava flows. The canyon is a classic V-shaped valley, indicative of river-type erosion rather than erosion caused by glaciation.|$|E
5|$|After the {{eleventh}} century, as masonry techniques advanced, ashlar blocks became more rectangular, resulting in structurally more stable walls that could incorporate more refined architectural moulding and detailing <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> in corbelling, buttressing, lintels and arching. At {{the same time}} there were increasing influences from English and continental European designs. These {{can be seen in the}} Romanesque chevron pattern on the piers in the nave of Dunfermline Abbey (1130–40), which were modelled on details from Durham Cathedral. St Magnus Cathedral in Orkney, begun in 1137, may have employed masons that had worked at Durham. The arrival of the new monastic orders in Scotland from the twelfth century led to a boom in ecclesiastical building using English and continental forms, including abbeys at Kelso, Holyrood, Jedburgh and St Andrews.|$|E

5|$|Because {{language}} {{emerged in}} the early prehistory of man, before the existence of any written records, its early development has left no historical traces, and {{it is believed that}} no comparable processes can be observed today. Theories that stress continuity often look at animals to see if, for example, primates display any traits <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> as analogous to what pre-human language must have been like. And early human fossils can be inspected for traces of physical adaptation to language use or pre-linguistic forms of symbolic behaviour. Among the signs in human fossils that may suggest linguistic abilities are: the size of the brain relative to body mass, the presence of a larynx capable of advanced sound production and the nature of tools and other manufactured artifacts.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Criss Angel {{became the}} creator, director, and {{executive}} producer of the A Network show Criss Angel Mindfreak, and had entered production in January. Seasons 1 and 2 were filmed at The Aladdin in Las Vegas, with Season 3 at the Luxor Las Vegas. Premiering on July 20, 2005, the show's illusions included walking on water, levitating, walking up the side of Luxor Hotel (in the light of 39 focused lamps <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> from space), floating between two buildings, causing a Lamborghini to disappear, surviving in an exploding C4 Crate, cutting himself in half in full view of an audience and getting run over by a steamroller while lying on a bed of broken glass.|$|E
5|$|In December 2010, it was {{reported}} that only 20% of the game was complete. Numerous features {{were not included in the}} final product due to time and budget constraints. The developers originally planned to add a special weapon designed to be used underwater and acquired from Chris at the end of the eight episode, but the plot of the game changed during development and the team had to discard it. Additionally, the land in the distance <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> from the ship in the first episode was originally going to be the setting of the last episode, where Jill would have found something from her past.|$|E
