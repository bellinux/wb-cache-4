40|$|This {{study used}} {{a sample of}} 501 {{families}} from the Mississippi Delta region to examine the feasibility of the Family Stress Model for understanding adolescent suicidal ideation.

25|$|LGBT sex {{education}} includes {{the teachings of}} safe sex practices for people of all gender and sexual orientation identities, not just those participating in heterosexual sexual activities. Studies have shown that many schools do not offer such educational tracks today, possibly due to a controversy {{in the field of}} {{sex education}} regarding whether or not LGBT education should be integrated into course curriculum. The lack of information distributed regarding mentally and physcially healthy LGBT relationships can also be attributed to the ongoing stigma surrounding queerness in the US, especially as related <b>to</b> <b>adolescents.</b>|$|E
25|$|While several rat studies {{indicate}} that alcohol is more toxic during adolescence than adulthood, some researchers believe that it remains unclear whether {{this is also the}} case in humans. Though heavy binge drinking adolescent humans show impaired brain activity during memory tests and underdeveloped brain structures compared <b>to</b> <b>adolescents</b> who did not binge-drink, they argue that these findings are similar to adult alcoholics who did not abuse alcohol during adolescence. Extrapolation from animal studies to humans is notoriously difficult, and a review by the group Choose Responsibility concluded that alcohol's long-term damage to cognitive processes was the same regardless of whether heavy drinking commenced during adolescence or later.|$|E

25|$|Children's {{food choices}} are also {{influenced}} by family meals. Researchers provided a household eating questionnaire to 18,177 children, ranging in ages 11–21, and discovered that {{four out of five}} parents let their children make their own food decisions. They also discovered that compared <b>to</b> <b>adolescents</b> who ate three or fewer meals per week, those who ate four to five family meals per week were 19% less likely to report poor consumption of vegetables, 22% less likely to report poor consumption of fruits, and 19% less likely to report poor consumption of dairy foods. Adolescents who ate six to seven family meals per week, compared to those who ate three or fewer family meals per week, were 38% less likely to report poor consumption of vegetables, 31% less likely to report poor consumption of fruits, and 27% less likely to report poor consumption of dairy foods.

40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} neurobehavior of {{neonates}} born <b>to</b> <b>adolescent</b> mothers {{with and without}} depression during gestation. Methods: This prospective cross-sectional study included healthy term neonates born <b>to</b> <b>adolescent</b> mothers with untreated depression during gestation, without exposure to legal or illicit drugs, and compared them with infants born <b>to</b> <b>adolescent</b> mothers without psychiatric disorders. Maternal psychiatric diagnoses were assessed by the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI 2. 1) and neonatal neurobehavior by the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit Network Neurobehavioral Scale (NNNS) at 24 to 72 hours of life. Neurobehavioral outcomes were analyzed by ANOVA adjusted for confounders. Results: 37 infants born to mothers with depression during gestation were compared to 332 infants born to mothers without psychiatric disorders. Infants of mothers with depression had smaller head circumferences. Significant interactions of maternal depression and male gender, gestational age > 40 weeks, regional anesthesia during delivery, vaginal delivery, and infant head circumference &# 8805; 34 cm were found. Worse performance was noted in the following neonatal neurobehavioral parameters: arousal, excitability, lethargy, hypotonicity, and signs of stress and abstinence. Conclusion: Infants born <b>to</b> <b>adolescent</b> mothers with depression exhibit some behavioral changes {{in the first days}} of life. These changes are associated with infant sex, gestational age, type of anesthesia, mode of delivery, and head circumference...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} the longitudinal relationship of early elementary predic-tors <b>to</b> <b>adolescent</b> depression 7 years later.

Regression analyses were conducted with each risk factor separately and combined, while also examining gender and the gender × risk factor interaction. Results showed that the risk factors predominately in the individual characteristic group (depression, anxiety, and antisocial behavior) were predictive of depression 7 years later. Gender differences among the longitudinal risk factors were also found in relation <b>to</b> <b>adolescent</b> depression. Discussion of the results focuses on the practice of children’s mental health assessment and implications for the development of prevention and intervention programs for depression...|$|R
