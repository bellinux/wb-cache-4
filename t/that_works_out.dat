2500|$|With a {{population}} nearing six million, Miami-Dade Transit, Broward County Transit, and Palm Tran combined carry {{less than half}} a million passengers per day, a number <b>that</b> <b>works</b> <b>out</b> to less than 5% of the population using transit regularly once round trips are figured. In Greater Downtown Miami, which has seen more than 100% population growth since 2000, the Metromover system carries almost half the daily riders of the Metrorail system with only about [...] of track. Although it directly connects to the Metrorail system at two stations, nearly 80% of the ridership is through direct boardings. This mode alone would suggest at least 15% of the downtown-are{{a population}} uses transit. Historically, Metromover ridership remained fairly steady from 1995 (after outer loop extensions) to 2002, when the 25 cent fair was lifted, making the system entirely free to use. After this, ridership spiked by more than 60% within two years, {{but it was not until}} 2013 that ridership doubled from 2002. In a region and state not overly inclined to public transport, this system is considered successful and a vital part of downtown life. The elimination of the fare was just a small part of a sales tax increase that was approved by two-thirds of Miami-Dade voters under the promise that major rail-based transit extensions would take place. Funds were misused and it was later admitted that the half-cent increase was known to never be nearly enough for what was promised, further souring public opinion of local transit and government.|$|E

40|$|Background: People who <b>work</b> <b>out</b> {{could have}} an {{excessive}} concern for diet and body weight and thus be more prone to have eating disorders. Aim: To compare psychological and behavioral traits between subjects with clinically relevant eating disorders and subjects <b>that</b> <b>work</b> <b>out</b> regularly. Subjects and methods: The Eating Attitudes Test (EAT- 40) and the eight items of the Eating Disorders Inventory were administered to 151 patients that fulfilled the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for eating disorders and to 396 subjects who <b>work</b> <b>out</b> regularly in gymnasiums (136 males). Results: Eighteen percent of subjects <b>that</b> <b>worked</b> <b>out</b> (5 males and 67 females) scored within the pathological range in the EAT- 40. These subjects were classified as having a subclinical eating disorder. When comparing the EDI scores of these subjects with those of patients with clinically relevant eating disorders, they had a similar Drive for thinness (p= 0. 413), Body dissatisfaction (p= 0. 365), Maturity fears (p= 0. 190) and Perfectionism (p= 0. 907). Females had similar Interpersonal distrust (p= 0. 709) scores. Males had similar Maturity fears (p= O. 119), Perfectionism (p= 0. 253) and Interpersonal distrust (p= 0. 767) scores. Conclusions: Subjects <b>that</b> <b>work</b> <b>out</b> regularly and have subclinical eating disorders, display similar drive for thinness, body dissatisfaction, immaturity and perfectionism traits, than patients suffering from clinically relevant eating disorders (Rev Méd Chile 2002; 130 : 287 - 94...|$|R
