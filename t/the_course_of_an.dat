5|$|One of {{the main}} tools {{forensic}} anthropologists use {{in the identification of}} remains is their knowledge of osteology and the various differences that occur within the human skeleton. During <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> investigation, anthropologists are often tasked with helping to determinate an individual's sex, stature, age, and ancestry. To do this, anthropologists must be aware of how the human skeleton can differ between individuals.|$|E

5|$|Early {{the same}} morning the night harbour {{occupied}} by the New Zealanders from V Company, 2 RAR/NZ had been attacked by a Viet Cong force consisting of elements of three companies from the 274th Regiment, shortly after stand-to at 06:15. The incident {{proved to be the}} most intense fighting involving New Zealand forces in Vietnam to that point, and over <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> hour the attack was successfully repelled with the assistance of highly accurate artillery support from the 108th Battery, RAA operating in direct support, as well as from mortar fire. The Viet Cong withdrew following the arrival of a light fire team of gunships, leaving behind 13 dead {{and a number of other}} blood trails. Nine New Zealanders were wounded in the engagement, six of whom subsequently required evacuation by helicopter.|$|E
5|$|Goffman {{uses the}} metaphor of {{conversation}} being a stage play. A plays tone will shift throughout the performance due to the actions taken by the actors; {{this is similar to}} how a discussion is keyed – based on what either person says or does over <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> interaction, the key will change accordingly. The parallels go further, though. Goffman also claims that a speaker details a drama more often than they provide information. They invite the listener to empathize and, as was explained above, they’re often not meant to be stirred to take action, but rather to show appreciation; during a play this generally takes the form of applause.|$|E

5|$|Like other {{forensic}} fields, forensic anthropologists {{are held}} to {{a high level of}} ethical standards due to their work in the legal system. Individuals who purposefully misrepresent themselves or any piece of evidence can be sanctioned, fined, or imprisoned by the appropriate authorities depending on the severity of the violation. Individuals who fail to disclose any conflict of interests or who fail to report all of their findings, regardless of what they may be, can face disciplinary actions. It is important that forensic anthropologists remain impartial during <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> investigation. Any perceived bias during an investigation could hamper efforts in court to bring the responsible parties to justice.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} the Swiss Air Force began in 1914with the {{establishment}} of an ad hoc force consisting of a handful of men in outdated and largely civilian aircraft. It was only in the 1930s that an effective air force was established at great cost, capable of inflicting several embarrassing defeats on the Nazi Luftwaffe in <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> initially vigorous defence of neutral Swiss airspace. The Swiss Air Force as an autonomous military service was created in October 1936. After World War II it was renamed the Swiss Air Force and Anti-Aircraft Command (Schweizerische Flugwaffe Kommando der Flieger und Fliegerabwehrtruppen) and in 1996became a separate service independent from the Army, under its present name Schweizer Luftwaffe.|$|E
5|$|At the time, hadrosaurids {{were thought}} to have been aquatic animals, and Kräusel made a point of stating that the {{specimen}} did not rule out hadrosaurids eating water plants. The discovery of possible gut contents made little impact in English-speaking circles, except for another brief mention of the aquatic-terrestrial dichotomy, until it was brought up by John Ostrom in <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> article reassessing the old interpretation of hadrosaurids as water-bound. Instead of trying to adapt the discovery to the aquatic model, he used it as a line of evidence that hadrosaurids were terrestrial herbivores. While his interpretation of hadrosaurids as terrestrial animals has been generally accepted, the Senckenberg plant fossils remain equivocal. Kenneth Carpenter has suggested that they may actually represent the gut contents of a starving animal, instead of a typical diet. Other authors have noted that because the plant fossils were removed from their original context in the specimen and were heavily prepared, it is no longer possible to follow up on the original work, leaving open the possibility that the plants were washed-in debris.|$|E

5|$|The ages of {{individual}} aetosaurs {{can be determined}} by examining their osteoderms. Some isolated osteoderms have been claimed to belong to juvenile aetosaurs based on their size and shape but these hypotheses have often been questioned. For example, juvenile osteoderms of Calyptosuchus were later identified {{as those of the}} small-bodied pseudosuchian Revueltosaurus (which is not an aetosaur), and juvenile osteoderms of Desmatosuchus have been reinterpreted as those of aetosaur Acaenasuchus, which had a relatively small body size at maturity. Studies of the bone structure of paramedian osteoderms indicate that new bone was deposited along the edges of each plate over <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> aetosaur's lifetime. This means that lines of arrested growth on the undersides of paramedian osteoderms can be used to determine an individual's age. Comparing the ages {{of individual}} specimens with their total body lengths indicates that aetosaurs increased in length at relatively constant rates, but increased in body mass at different rates depending on whether they had wide bodies like Typothorax or narrow bodies like Aetobarbakinoides. Aetosaurs also seem to have grown more slowly than modern crocodilians. Analysis of the limb bones of aetosaurs indicates that they grew quickly when young and more slowly when adults. This pattern of growth is seen in most other pseudosuchians.|$|E
