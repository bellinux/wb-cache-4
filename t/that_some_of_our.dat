Some critics speculate that Swift turned to having his work printed without public sponsorship because he was afraid of breaking his commitments to Pope and his publisher Motte. Regardless of what Swift {{may or may not be}} planning, he wrote to Motte in December 1732 and said: [...] "I have cause to believe <b>that</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> printers will collected all they think to be mine, and print them by subscription, which I will never encourage nor oppose." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{great many}} {{intelligent}} persons tolerate or encourage our fake natural history {{on the ground}} that they find it entertaining, and that it interests the school-children in the wild life about them. Is the truth, then, without value for its own sake? What would these good people think of a United States school history that took the same liberties with facts <b>that</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> nature writers do: that, for instance, made Washington take his army over the Delaware in balloons, or in sleighs on the solid ice with bands playing; or that made Lincoln a victim of the Evil Eye; or that portrayed his slayer as a self-sacrificing hero; or that represented the little Monitor that eventful day on Hampton Roads as diving under the Merrimac and tossing it ashore on its beak? ...|$|E
500|$|Witnesses {{maintained}} that {{immediately after the}} bomb blast there was an exchange of gunshots between police and demonstrators. Accounts vary widely as to who fired first and whether any of the crowd fired at the police. Historian Paul Avrich maintains that the police fired on the fleeing demonstrators, reloaded and then fired again, killing four and wounding as many as 70 people. What is not disputed is that {{in less than five}} minutes the square was empty except for the casualties. According to the May 4 New York Times demonstrators began firing at the police, who then returned fire. In his report on the incident, Inspector Bonfield wrote that he [...] "gave the order to cease firing, fearing <b>that</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> men, in the darkness might fire into each other". An anonymous police official told the Chicago Tribune, [...] "A very large number of the police were wounded by each other's revolvers. ... It was every man for himself, and while some got two or three squares away, the rest emptied their revolvers, mainly into each other." ...|$|E

The Guardian said that the album's [...] "lyrics sound like Blur's Parklife rewritten by the editorial staff of Heat magazine" [...] and [...] "holds a distinctly ambiguous mirror up to noughties celebrity." [...] Girls Aloud came under fire for the album's allegedly [...] "dirty lyrics". [...] "I'm surprised <b>that</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> lyrics have caused a stir. We're just having a laugh, {{and a lot of the}} songs are very tongue in cheek," [...] commented Kimberley Walsh on the matter. Sarah Harding said that songs like [...] "Racy Lacey", which [...] "lampoons promiscuous females", are [...] "observational rather than autobiographical." [...] "Models" [...] was also criticised for its use of the word [...] "shit", while [...] "Swinging London Town" [...] allegedly [...] "toys with the girls' reputation for partying a little too heartily." [...] "Watch Me Go", co-written by former 'N Sync member JC Chasez, also [...] "delves into the [...] topic of bondage." [...] "It's Magic" [...] is the only song on which Girls Aloud receive a writing credit (most likely written by Nicola Roberts, as she solely performs it).|$|E

30|$|The (limit) {{fluctuations}} in the employment shares {{seem to be an}} interesting topic. The empirical evidence shows that the employment shares fluctuate in the short run (cf., e.g., Stijepic (2016)). Although our paper does not focus on explaining short-run employment share dynamics, we have shown <b>that</b> (a) <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> models allow for such fluctuations over the transitional period and in the limit, (b) <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> models allow only for transitional fluctuations, and (c) Model 3 does not allow for any fluctuations. Further research could focus on these aspects.|$|R

We report on a user study <b>that</b> validates <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> hypotheses on the effect the table would have on its users. Namely we show that Reflect leads to more balanced collaboration, but only under certain conditions. We also show different effects the table has on over- and under-parti-cipators...|$|R

This paper studies the singularities of special Lagrangian fibrations. We construct many examples of special Lagrangian fibrations on open subsets of C 3.
