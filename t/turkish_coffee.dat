5|$|There is {{a strong}} coffee-drinking culture in Israel. Coffee is {{prepared}} as instant (nes), iced, latte (hafuḥ), Italian-style espresso, or <b>Turkish</b> <b>coffee,</b> which is sometimes flavored with cardamom (hel).

Tea is usually flavored with na'ana (mint) or maramiyyeh (sage). The coffee of choice is usually Turkish or Arabic coffee. Arabic coffee is similar to <b>Turkish</b> <b>coffee,</b> but the former is spiced with cardamom and is usually unsweetened.|$|E

25|$|As well {{as being}} an {{everyday}} beverage, <b>Turkish</b> <b>coffee</b> is {{also a part of}} the traditional Turkish wedding custom. As a prologue to marriage, the bridegroom's parents (in the lack of his father, his mother and an elderly member of his family) must visit the young girl's family to ask the hand of the bride-to-be and the blessings of her parents upon the upcoming marriage. During this meeting, the bride-to-be must prepare and serve <b>Turkish</b> <b>coffee</b> to the guests. For the groom's coffee, the bride-to-be sometimes uses salt instead of sugar to gauge his character. If the bridegroom drinks his coffee without any sign of displeasure, the bride-to-be assumes that the groom is good-tempered and patient. As the groom already comes as the demanding party to the girl's house, in fact it is the boy who is passing an exam and etiquette requires him to receive with all smiles this particular present from the girl, although {{in some parts of the}} country this may be considered as a lack of desire on the part of the girl for marriage with that candidate.|$|E
25|$|Coffee may be brewed {{by several}} methods. It may be boiled, steeped, or pressurized. Brewing coffee by boiling was the {{earliest}} method, and <b>Turkish</b> <b>coffee</b> {{is an example}} of this method. It is prepared by grinding or pounding the seeds to a fine powder, then adding it to water and bringing it to the boil for no more than an instant in a pot called a cezve or, in Greek, a bríki. This produces a strong coffee with a layer of foam on the surface and sediment (which is not meant for drinking) settling {{at the bottom of the}} cup.|$|E
25|$|In {{the modern}} age, Budapest {{developed}} its own peculiar cuisine, based on {{products of the}} nearby region, such as lamb, pork and vegetables special to the region. Modern Hungarian cuisine is a synthesis of ancient Asiatic components mixed with French, Germanic, Italian, and Slavic elements. The food of Hungary {{can be considered a}} melting pot of the continent, with a culinary base formed from its own, original Magyar cuisine. Considerable numbers of Saxons, Armenians, Italians, Jews and Serbs settled in the Hungarian basin and in Transylvania, also contributing with different new dishes. Elements of ancient Turkish cuisine were adopted during the Ottoman era, in the form of sweets (for example different nougats, like white nougat called törökméz, quince (birsalma), Turkish delight, <b>Turkish</b> <b>coffee</b> or rice dishes like pilaf, meat and vegetable dishes like the eggplant, used in eggplant salads and appetizers, stuffed peppers and stuffed cabbage called töltött káposzta. Hungarian cuisine was influenced by Austrian cuisine under the Austro-Hungarian Empire, dishes and methods of food preparation have often been borrowed from Austrian cuisine, and vice versa.|$|E

25|$|Serbian cuisine {{is largely}} heterogeneous, with heavy Oriental, Central European and Mediterranean influences. Despite this, it has evolved and {{achieved}} its own culinary identity. Food {{is very important}} in Serbian social life, particularly during religious holidays such as Christmas, Easter and feast days, i.e., slava. Staples of the Serbian diet include bread, meat, fruits, vegetables, and dairy products. Traditionally, three meals are consumed per day. Breakfast generally consists of eggs, meat and bread. Lunch is considered the main meal, and is normally eaten in the afternoon. Traditionally, <b>Turkish</b> <b>coffee</b> is prepared after a meal, and is served in small cups. Bread is the basis of all Serbian meals, and it {{plays an important role in}} Serbian cuisine and can be found in religious rituals. A traditional Serbian welcome is to offer bread and salt to guests, and also slatko (fruit preserve). Meat is widely consumed, as is fish. Serbian specialties include kajmak (a dairy product similar to clotted cream), proja (cornbread), kačamak (corn-flour porridge), and gibanica (cheese and kajmak pie).

2500|$|In Bosnia and Herzegovina, <b>Turkish</b> <b>coffee</b> is {{also called}} [...] "Bosnian coffee" [...] (Bosnian: bosanska kahva), {{which is made}} {{slightly}} differently from its Turkish counterpart. A deviation from the Turkish preparation {{is that when the}} water reaches its boiling point, a small amount is saved aside for later, usually in a coffee cup. Then, the coffee is added to the pot (džezva), and the remaining water in the cup is added to the pot. Everything is put back on the heat source to reach its boiling point again, which only takes a couple of seconds since the coffee is already very hot.

Cafestol did not affect genes known to be up-regulated by FXR in the liver of wild-type mice, but did increase expression of the positive FXR-target genes intestinal bile acid-binding protein and fibroblast growth factor 15 (FGF 15) in the intestine. Because FGF 15 has recently been shown to function in an enterohepatic regulatory pathway to repress liver expression of bile acid homeostatic genes, its direct induction in the gut may account for indirect effects of cafestol on liver gene expression. PXR-dependent gene regulation of cytochrome P 450 3 A 11 and other targets by cafestol was also only seen in the intestine. Using a double FXR/PXR knockout mouse model, we found that both receptors contribute to the cafestol-dependent induction of intestinal FGF 15 gene expression. In conclusion, cafestol acts as an agonist ligand for both FXR and PXR, and this may contribute to its impact on cholesterol homeostasis...|$|R
