5|$|A Twenty-Man Gauntlet for the Gold to {{determine}} the number contender to the NWA World Heavyweight Championship was held at Hard Justice. The match was announced on the April 29 episode of Impact! by DOA Rhodes. In a Gauntlet for the Gold, two wrestlers start the bout, with more entering at time intervals, in which <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> eliminate the opponent by throwing them over the top rope and to the floor. When the match is down to two wrestlers, a standard match is held, with the winner being the one to gain the pinfall or submission. On the May 6 episode of Impact!, Abyss was announced as a participant in the match. TNA held a Ten-Man Gauntlet on the May 13 episode of Impact! {{to determine}} the first and final entrants in the match, with the first eliminated in the match entering first while the winner being the last entrant. Abyss, Bobby Roode, David Young, A-1, Chris Sabin, Petey Williams, Lance Hoyt, Michael Shane, Trytan, and Apolo all participated in the bout, with Roode being the first eliminated and Abyss winning the contest.|$|E

He or she should keep a distance of about 2 metres, although the ideal distance will vary with each situation. <b>The</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> pressure the opponent as much as possible without giving him a large possibility of a dribble. As a dribble isn't as dangerous when the defending team is well organised, the distance may be shorter in these cases. Analogously, the distance should be increased if the defence is poorly organised.|$|E

500|$|The Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844 {{had been}} written between April and August 1844, but soon Marx {{recognised}} that the Manuscripts had been influenced by some inconsistent ideas of Ludwig Feuerbach. [...] Accordingly, Marx recognised the need to break with Feuerbach's philosophy in favour of historical materialism, thus a year later (in April 1845) after moving from Paris to Brussels, Marx wrote his eleven [...] "Theses on Feuerbach". [...] The [...] "Theses on Feuerbach" [...] are best known for Thesis 11, which states that [...] "philosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways, <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> change it". This work contains Marx's criticism of materialism (for being contemplative), idealism (for reducing practice to theory) overall, criticising philosophy for putting abstract reality above the physical world. It thus introduced the first glimpse at Marx's historical materialism, an argument {{that the world is}} changed not by ideas but by actual, physical, material activity and practice. In 1845, after receiving a request from the Prussian king, the French government shut down Vorwärts!, with the interior minister, François Guizot, expelling Marx from France. At this point, Marx moved from Paris to Brussels, where Marx hoped to once again continue his study of capitalism and political economy.|$|E
2500|$|Also, in his Theses on Feuerbach (1845), {{in which}} the young Marx broke with Feuerbach's idealism, he writes that [...] "the {{philosophers}} have only described the world, in various ways, <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> change it," [...] and his materialist approach allows for and empowers such change. This opposition between various subjective interpretations given by philosophers, which may be, in a sense, compared with Weltanschauung designed to legitimize {{the current state of}} affairs, and effective transformation of the world through praxis, which combines theory and practice in a materialist way, is what distinguish [...] "Marxist philosophers" [...] with the rest of philosophers.|$|E

2500|$|The philosopher Étienne Balibar {{wrote in}} 1996 that [...] "there is no Marxist {{philosophy}} and there never will be; {{on the other}} hand, Marx is more important for philosophy than ever before." [...] So even the existence of Marxist philosophy is debatable (the answer may depend on {{what is meant by}} [...] "philosophy," [...] a complicated question in itself). Balibar's remark is intended to explain the significance of the final line of Karl Marx's 11 Theses on Feuerbach (1845), which can be read as an epitaph for philosophy: [...] "The philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways; <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> change it".|$|E
2500|$|Some of Guattari's diary entries, {{correspondence}} with Deleuze, and {{notes on the}} development of the book were published posthumously as The Anti-Oedipus Papers (2004). The philosopher Mikkel Borch-Jacobsen and the psychologist Sonu Shamdasani write that rather than having their confidence shaken by the [...] "provocations and magnificent rhetorical violence" [...] of Anti-Oedipus, the psychoanalytic profession felt that the debates raised by the book legitimated their discipline. Joshua Ramey writes that while the passage into Deleuze and Guattari's [...] "body without organs" [...] is [...] "fraught with danger and even pain ... the point of Anti-Oedipus is not to make glamorous that violence or that suffering.

2500|$|Contrary to {{orthodox}} Marxist praxis, which solely {{seeks to}} implement an unchangeable and narrow idea of [...] "communism" [...] into practice, critical theorists held that praxis and theory, following the dialectical method, should be interdependent and should mutually influence each other. When Marx famously stated in his Theses on Feuerbach that [...] "philosophers have only interpreted {{the world in}} various ways; <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> change it", his real idea was that philosophy's only validity was in how it informed action. Frankfurt School theorists would correct this by claiming that when action fails, then the theory guiding it must be reviewed. In short, socialist philosophical thought must be given the ability to criticize itself and [...] "overcome" [...] its own errors. While theory must inform praxis, praxis must also {{have a chance to}} inform theory.|$|E
2500|$|In October 2016, the SPLC {{published}} {{a list of}} [...] "anti-Muslim extremists", including British activist Maajid Nawaz and ex-Muslim activist Ayaan Hirsi Ali.

Nawaz, who identifies as a [...] "liberal, reform Muslim", denounced the listing as a [...] "smear", saying that the SPLC listing had made him a target of jihadists. Mark Potok of the SPLC responded, [...] "Our {{point is not to}} make these people targets for violence... <b>The</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> tamp down the really baseless targeting."

He also stated that he likes the fact that John Collingwood is a doctor who actually gets to use his skills in the film, unlike in the original where the character is merely identified as being a doctor. Craven comments, [...] " [...] an extraordinary moment" [...] when John is forced to improvise a way to restore a collapsed lung; [...] "It made it real."

He asserts that the film does not have a happy ending, but that there is some hope left at the end. Director Dennis Iliadis further explains that <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> show the family from a different light. Initially the director feared that they were [...] "wussing out" [...] with the ending; he eventually decided that what you really see is a family that has physically survived this encounter, but are [...] "dead in many ways".

2500|$|... 1. Abductive (or retroductive) phase. Guessing, {{inference}} to explanatory hypotheses for {{selection of}} those best worth trying. From abduction, Peirce distinguishes induction as inferring, {{on the basis}} of tests, the proportion of truth in the hypothesis. Every inquiry, whether into ideas, brute facts, or norms and laws, arises from surprising observations in one or more of those realms (and for example at any stage of an inquiry already underway). All explanatory content of theories comes from abduction, which guesses a new or outside idea so as to account in a simple, economical way for a surprising or complicated phenomenon. The modicum of success in our guesses far exceeds that of random luck, and seems born of attunement to nature by developed or inherent instincts, especially insofar as best guesses are optimally plausible and simple {{in the sense of the}} [...] "facile and natural", as by Galileo's natural light of reason and as distinct from [...] "logical simplicity". Abduction is the most fertile but least secure mode of inference. Its general rationale is inductive: it succeeds often enough and it has no substitute in expediting us toward new truths. In 1903, Peirce called pragmatism [...] "the logic of abduction". Coordinative method leads from abducting a plausible hypothesis to judging it for its testability and for how its trial would economize inquiry itself. The hypothesis, being insecure, needs to have practical implications leading at least to mental tests and, in science, lending themselves to scientific tests. A simple but unlikely guess, if not costly to test for falsity, may belong first in line for testing. A guess is intrinsically worth testing if it has plausibility or reasoned objective probability, while subjective likelihood, though reasoned, can be misleadingly seductive. Guesses can be selected for trial strategically, for their caution (for which Peirce gave as example the game of Twenty Questions), breadth, or incomplexity. One can discover only that which would be revealed through their sufficient experience anyway, and so <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> expedite it; economy of research demands the leap, so to speak, of abduction and governs its art.|$|E
