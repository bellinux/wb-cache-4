5000|$|Donner has mixed {{commercial}} flops (The <b>Toy,</b> <b>Inside</b> Moves, Radio Flyer) and successes (The Goonies, the Lethal Weapon series, Scrooged and Ladyhawke). In {{the case}} of Superman, it was Donner who insisted {{the subject of the}} comic book superhero should be treated [...] "straight" [...] rather than [...] "camp", an approach that strongly influenced later genre directors such as Tim Burton (Batman, Batman Returns), Bryan Singer (X-Men, X2, X-Men: Days of Future Past), and Christopher Nolan (Batman Begins, The Dark Knight, The Dark Knight Rises), who have made successful superhero films of their own. The influence of Superman can, to this day, be seen in superhero films outside the Superman storyline, and even outside the DC Comics universe. Sam Raimi's Spider-Man film is debatably one of the strongest examples of that influence. In the early 1980s, Donner proposed to Warner Bros. a non-camp film version of Batman, to star Mel Gibson.|$|E

The shock of the {{situation}} (accompanied by strange phenomena) allow the Doctor and Todd to slip away into the jungle, where they encounter Aris dominating a group of Kinda and seemingly fulfilling a tribal prophecy that [...] "When the Not-We come, one will arise from among We, a male with Voice who must be obeyed." [...] Karuna soon finds the Doctor and Todd and takes them to meet Panna in the cave from the vision, with the wise woman realising {{the danger of the}} situation now Aris has voice. She places them in a trance like state and reveals that the Mara has gained dominion on Deva Loka. The Great Wheel, which turns as civilisations rise and fall has turned again and the hour is near when chaos will reign, instigated by the Mara. The vision she shares is Panna’s last act: when it is finished, she is dead.|$|E
5000|$|The main concept {{infants and}} young {{children}} learn by beginning to show egocentrism {{is the fact that}} their thoughts, values, and behaviors are different from those of others, also known as the theory of mind. [...] Initially when children begin to have social interactions with others, mainly the caregivers, they misinterpret that they are one entity, because they are together for a long duration of time and the caregivers often provide for the children's needs. For example, a child may misattribute the act of their mother reaching to retrieve an object that they point to as a sign that they are the same entity, when in fact they are actually separate individuals. As early as 15 months old, children show a mix of egocentrism and theory of mind when an agent acts inconsistently with how the children expect him to behave. In this study the children observed the experimenter place a <b>toy</b> <b>inside</b> one of two boxes, but did not see when the experimenter removed the toy from the original box and placed it in the other box, due to obstruction by a screen. When the screen was removed the children watched the experimenter reach to take the toy {{out of one of the}} boxes, yet because the children did not see the switching part, they looked at the experimenter's action much longer when she reached for the box opposite to the one she originally put the toy in. Not only does this show the existence of infants' memory capacity, but it also demonstrates how they have expectations based on their knowledge, as they are surprised when those expectations are not met.|$|E

50|$|Locking {{the dog in}} a crate {{and letting}} it whine, bark and attempt to escape is common but such {{attempts}} to introduce crate training may cause a negative association with crating. The dog should become slowly accustomed to the crate. This can involve making a crate an inviting place by placing small familiar <b>toys</b> <b>inside,</b> moving the pet bed into crate, leaving unwashed items of the owner's clothing inside, rewarding pets for entering the crate and remaining inside, incorporating the crate as part of play, feeding the pet in the crate, allowing the pet to explore and use the crate until {{it is no longer}} intimidating, and eventually building to the pet sleeping in the crate overnight.|$|R

40|$|Abstract-Two {{experiments}} assessed infants ' {{understanding that}} ac-tions {{that occur in}} sequence {{may be related to}} an overarching goal. Experiment 1 tested whether embedding an ambiguous action (touch-ing the lid of a box) in a sequence that culminated with an action infants readily construe as goal-directed (grasping a <b>toy</b> <b>inside</b> the box) would alter infants ' construal of the ambiguous action. Having seen the ambiguous action in this context, infants later construed this action in isolation as being directed at the toy within the box. Experi-ment 2 tested whether infants related the two actions {{on the basis of the}} temporal or the causal relation between them. When the causal relation was disrupted but the temporal relation was preserved, in-fants no longer related the two actions. These findings indicate that 12 -month-old infants relate single actions to overarching goals and that they do so by construing goal-directed action in a causal framework...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} research, 6 -month-old infants {{consistently}} {{searched for a}} tall toy behind a tall {{as opposed to a}} short occluder. However, when the same toy was hidden inside a tall or a short container, only older, 7. 5 -month-old infants searched for the tall <b>toy</b> <b>inside</b> the tall container. These and control results (1) confirm previous violation-of-expectation (VOE) findings of a décalage in infants' reasoning about height information in occlusion and containment events; (2) cast doubt on the suggestion that VOE tasks overestimate infants ' cognitive abilities; and (3) support recent proposals that infants use their physical knowledge to guide their actions when task demands do not overwhelm their limited processing resources. Keywords infants physical reasoning; occlusion; containment; action tasks Recent investigations of infants ' physical reasoning have revealed three main findings.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} Kinder Chocolate Egg (Kinder Surprise, {{born in the}} year 1974; and Kinder Joy, born in the year 2011). Kinder Chocolate egg, as a fun food for {{children}}, has been welcomed by children for decades. One of its most attractive features {{is that there is}} a <b>toy</b> <b>inside</b> of the egg, which links food and play together. Yet, as contended by scholars, throughout the production of fun food and child food, it is also a construction of distinction between children and adults. In view of this, this paper makes an attempt to examine how the process of categorization happens in the case of Kinder Chocolate Egg. With the analytical tool of the circuit of culture (du Gay, Hall, Janes, Mackay, 2 ̆ 6 Negus, 1997), by looking into the production, consumption, representation, identity and regulatory? components of Kinder Chocolate Egg, we shall see the food product’s articulation of shaping the children categorization...|$|E
40|$|Human-centered environments {{are rich}} {{with a wide}} variety of spatial {{relations}} between everyday objects. For autonomous robots to operate effectively in such environments, they should be able to reason about these relations and generalize them to objects with different shapes and sizes. For example, having learned to place a <b>toy</b> <b>inside</b> a basket, a robot should be able to generalize this concept using a spoon and a cup. This requires a robot to have the flexibility to learn arbitrary relations in a lifelong manner, making it challenging for an expert to pre-program it with sufficient knowledge to do so beforehand. In this paper, we address the problem of learning spatial relations by introducing a novel method from the perspective of distance metric learning. Our approach enables a robot to reason about the similarity between pairwise spatial relations, thereby enabling it to use its previous knowledge when presented with a new relation to imitate. We show how this makes it possible to learn arbitrary spatial relations from non-expert users using a small number of examples and in an interactive manner. Our extensive evaluation with real-world data demonstrates the effectiveness of our method in reasoning about a continuous spectrum of spatial relations and generalizing them to new objects.

40|$|The {{current study}} {{examined}} whether {{the reliability of}} an individual's gaze influences infants' decision to imitate her novel actions. Infants were first administered an object search task wherein they observed the experimenter display emotional signals while looking inside an empty container (unreliable condition) or a container with a <b>toy</b> <b>inside</b> (reliable condition). Infants in both conditions were then {{given the opportunity to}} imitate the same experimenter, who demonstrated turning on a press-on light using her forehead. Results from Experiment 1 revealed that 18 -month-olds were capable of tracking a person's reliability, as their latency to open the container increased from the first to the last trial, only when exposed to the unreliable condition. Analyses of the proportion of infants who later imitated the experimenter's novel action showed no differences between the reliable and unreliable group, with both groups choosing to use their hands rather than their forehead. In Experiment 2, 14 -month-olds were also able to track reliability as confirmed by the performance on the object search task. However, while infants in the unreliable group preferred to use their hands to turn on the light, those in the reliable group showed no preference for using either their forehead or hands. Taken together, these findings indicate that 14 - month-olds, but not 18 -month-olds, appear to be influenced by their previous exposure to a credible or non-credible looker. This suggests a developmental progression in infants' willingness to selectively learn from others, perhaps influenced by different age-dependent motivations...|$|E

5000|$|A dog crate is a metal, wire, plastic, or fabric {{enclosure}} with {{a door in}} which a dog may be kept for security or transportation. Dog crates are designed to replicate a dog's natural den and as such can {{provide them with a}} place of refuge at home or when traveling to new surroundings. Crate training accustoms the dog with the crate. The most common reasons for using a dog crate are for toilet training a new puppy, taking a dog on short trips inside the car, displaying them at a dog show, or giving a dog a place to go when visitors come to the house. Similarly as people can have their own room to [...] "enjoy a moment of solace, your dog likes having its own room ... a little, cozy place of their own ... dog crates offer a superlative home for your dog where it can feel safe and secure." [...] Using a crate for a dog is similar to having a playpen for a toddler or a crib for a baby, and allows the owner to take their eyes off their pet. Additionally, covering a crate with a blanket, putting your pet’s favorite <b>toys</b> <b>inside,</b> and having enough packaging inside the cage to ensure your pet does not get hurt in the move are all things that will improve a pet’s move.|$|R
