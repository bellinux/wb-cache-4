She explains that because of the high anxiety that comes with state standardized testing certain ethnic communities are put at a large disadvantage. She states that lower income students are set up to fail and thus closes their window of opportunity. She argues that if the <b>test</b> <b>culture</b> continues, tests will become the only factor of success and inspiration will become vastly undervalued. The final section is her responding to the criticisms of her ideas and restating her main points. She states that each student is different and each community is different and argues that national and state politicians are not the right people to be designing curriculum. She argues that large public schools can be broken down into many small communities, which will improve overall performance. She also hopes that standardized tests are given less weight in the future since, she believes, they do not give a complete picture of each student. She closes with an answer to her main question: [...] "For me the most important answer to the question 'why save public education?' is this: It is in schools that we learn the art of living together as citizens, and it is in public schools that we are obliged to defend the idea of a public, not only a private, interest." ...|$|E

Without it, the project’s quality may degrade. We conducted a Grounded Theory study to under-stand how <b>testing</b> <b>culture</b> is communicated and disseminated in projects on GitHub. We investigated how the transparency of interactions on the site influences the test-ing behavior of developers. We found several strategies that software developers and managers can use to positively influence the testing behavior in their projects. We re-port on the challenges and risks caused by this and suggest guidelines for promoting a sustainable <b>testing</b> <b>culture</b> in software development projects. 1 Social Transparency and <b>Testing</b> <b>Culture</b> on GitHub Social coding sites provide a high degree of social transparency ([SDK+ 12]). Members are able to easily find out who they are interacting with, whom everyone else is interact-ing with, and who has interacted with which artifacts. This transparency influences the behavior of software developers [DSTH 12]).

The cultivation of the halophyte on the salinized soil (phytodesalination culture) led to a marked absorption of Na(+) ions by S. portulacastrum roots and their accumulation in the above-ground biomass up to 872 mg plant(- 1) and 4. 36 g pot(- 1) (about it ha(- 1)).

The results have been mixed. In this paper we investigate nine teams who tested during coding to examine the effect it had on the external quality of their code. Of the top three performing teams two used a documented testing strategy and the other an ad-hoc approach to testing.

METHODS: We recruited a total of 372 volunteers (214 females and 158 males; mean age of 39. 6 1; 14. 9 years) from three Bhutanese cities (Thimphu, Punaka, and Wangdue). The status of H. pylori infection was determined based on five different tests: the rapid urease test (CLO <b>test),</b> <b>culture,</b> histology, immunohistochemistry (IHC), and serum anti H. pylori-antibody. RESULTS: The serological test showed a significantly higher positive rate compared with the CLO <b>test,</b> <b>culture,</b> histology and IHC (P < 0. 001, P < 0. 001, P = 0. 01, and P = 0. 01, respectively).

The prevalence of H. pylori infection significantly decreased with age (P < 0. 01). The prevalence of H. pylori infection was lower in Thimphu than in Punakha and Wangdue (P = 0. 001 and 0. 06, respectively). The prevalence of H. pylori infection was significantly higher in patients with peptic ulcers than in those with gastritis (91. 4 % vs 71. 3 %, P = 0. 003).

40|$|We {{conducted}} the following {{study to determine}} if bispecific antibodies enhance the bactericidal activity of bovine neutrophils. Bispecific antibodies were synthesized by chemically crosslinking bovine neutrophil monoclonal antibodies to Staphylococcus aureus 305 capsule polysaccharide monoclonal antibodies. The efficiency of chemically coupling monoclonal antibody monomers was approximately 50 % for each bispecific antibody produced. Monoclonal antibodies against neutrophils enhanced the respiratory burst activity of neutrophils by 2. 3 - to 2. 5 -fold. To {{determine the influence of}} bispecific antibodies on neutrophil function, S. aureus 305 was preincubated with various concentrations of bispecific antibodies and neutrophils were then added to the opsonized bacteria at different bacteria to neutrophil ratios. The bactericidal activity of neutrophils was expressed as a percentage reduction in colony-forming units in <b>test</b> <b>cultures</b> compared with the number of colony-forming units in control <b>test</b> <b>cultures</b> that did not contain bispecific antibodies or neutrophils. The addition of bispecific antibodies to <b>test</b> <b>cultures</b> increased the bactericidal activity of neutrophils.

However, a greater reduction was observed in the presence of bispecific antibodies. Increasing concentrations of bispecific antibodies enhanced the bactericidal activity of neutrophils at a constant S. aureus 305 to neutraphil ratio of 1 : 500. The results indicate that bispecific antibodies that recognize both S. aureus 305 capsular polysaccharide and neutrophil antigens potentiate the bactericidal activity of neutrophils...|$|R
