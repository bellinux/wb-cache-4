By this means we can clean it of its rust, and then put it in again with a new rivet. If you will give me your knife to-morrow, I will try to put it in order for you again, in {{one or the other of}} these ways.|$|E
6000|$|Elizabeth's {{work was}} of a more social sort. There was a fashion for {{covering}} the private apartments of the very wealthy with metal plates beautifully embossed with repeated patterns. The taste of the time demanded, however, that the repetition of the patterns should not be exact--not mechanical, but [...] "natural"--and {{it was found that}} the most pleasing arrangement of pattern irregularity was obtained by employing women of refinement and natural taste <b>to</b> <b>punch</b> <b>out</b> the patterns with small dies. So many square feet of plates was exacted from Elizabeth as a minimum, and for whatever square feet she did in excess she received a small payment. The room, like most rooms of women workers, was under a manageress: men had been found by the Labour Company not only less exacting but extremely liable to excuse favoured ladies from a proper share of their duties. The manageress was a not unkindly, taciturn person, with the hardened remains of beauty of the brunette type; and the other women workers, who of course hated her, associated her name scandalously with one of the metal-work directors in order to explain her position.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to {{items on the}} back covers <b>to</b> <b>punch</b> <b>out</b> or assemble (such as puzzles, games, postcards, mobiles, bookmarks, or masks), Dynamite also included bonus inserts, such as fold-out posters, greeting cards, calendars, or records.

Occasional 3-D posters with glasses were also popular, featuring images such as King Kong, skateboarding, and outer space.|$|E
50|$|The RV-12 is {{the first}} {{production}} kit from Vans that is predominantly constructed using blind rivets, which allows {{the majority of the}} construction to be done without an assistant. The use of computerized punch machines <b>to</b> <b>punch</b> <b>out</b> most of the rivet holes to final size simplifies construction by minimizing the need to debur or final size most of the rivet holes. Since the wings are designed to be detached, the majority of the airplane can be constructed in most standard residential garages.|$|E

Jakeem worked {{with a small group}} of JSA members, as they attempted to stay alive while Yz and Lkz battled throughout space.

In the fall of 2004, Diamond {{made a name for}} himself in an obscure Instructional League game during which he tripped and fell on the mound while attempting a pickoff move. The opposing Oakland A's prospects laughed at Diamond, who then walked off the mound towards the A's dugout and told them that the next person to laugh was going to be wearing a fastball in the temple. Diamond then threw his next pitch three feet behind the hitter at the plate and then delivered nine consecutive strikes <b>to</b> <b>punch</b> <b>out</b> the side.|$|E

Though Mooney orders Lou <b>to</b> <b>punch</b> them <b>out</b> <b>to</b> show they are liars they do not fall down when she hits them showing they are telling the truth.|$|R
5000|$|Éponine, now ragged and emaciated, visits Marius at his {{apartment}} to beg for money. To impress him, she tries to prove her literacy by reading aloud from a book and by writing [...] "The Cops Are Here" [...] {{on a sheet of}} paper. Marius pities her and gives her some money. After Éponine leaves, Marius observes the [...] "Jondrettes" [...] in their apartment through a crack in the wall. Éponine comes in and announces that a philanthropist and his daughter are arriving to visit them. In order to look poorer, Thénardier puts out the fire and breaks a chair.

In an effort to make his family look poorer, Thénardier orders Azelma <b>to</b> <b>punch</b> <b>out</b> the window, which she does, cutting her hand open. It turns out that the [...] "philanthropist" [...] is in reality Jean Valjean, as yet unrecognized by the Thénardiers and known by a different name, and he visits to inspect their circumstances. He is accompanied by Cosette, with whom Marius is in love. Valjean promises to return later with money.|$|E
50|$|The {{centre of}} the {{keystone}} is deliberately weakened, this area may be marked or unmarked and is called the tut. In the plastic variety it is much thinner than the surrounding material; if made of wood it is partially pre-cut {{so that it is}} easier <b>to</b> <b>punch</b> <b>out.</b> Some time before the cask is to be served, the end of the tap is placed against this weakened section and, {{with the aid of a}} mallet, driven through it. The shaft of the tap is tapered, so that as it is forced in fully it seals against the undisturbed outer part of the keystone. A small amount of beer may leak out during this process, but with sufficient skill and firm action with the mallet, no spillage at all can occur.|$|E

Smith's own punch power was still evident as he decked Ruddock hard in the 2nd round, but seemed <b>to</b> <b>punch</b> himself <b>out</b> trying <b>to</b> finish Ruddock, who was a crafty survivor. The next few rounds saw Smith tire, as Ruddock's youth and power {{overwhelmed}} him, knocking him clean out in the 7th round for the full 10 count. Ruddock {{would go on to}} become a star and feature in several high-profile fights. Smith's career appeared to be over. He announced his retirement after the loss and said he would now pursue politics.|$|R
50|$|On {{the final}} hole {{alternate}} shot, Mark from Team Liffey hit a perfect {{drive down the}} fairway while Julien hit it into the trees so Nina had <b>to</b> <b>punch</b> <b>out</b> for the second shot. Andy tried {{to go for the}} green but hit a poor second shot that left Mallory with a difficult uphill third shot. Meanwhile, Julien hit his third shot 45 feet to the hole. Mallory chili-dipped her third shot into the bunker right ahead of her, and Mark skulled the bunker shot 25 feet past the hole. Andy missed the par putt and Team Liffey is in for a bogey 6. Meanwhile, Nina from Straffan lagged her birdie putt to 9 feet, but Julien missed the par putt. So the hole is halved and Team Liffey wins the immunity challenge, and Julien and Nina are headed to elimination.|$|E
