5|$|Although Du Bois {{generally}} endorsed socialist principles, {{his politics}} were strictly pragmatic: in 1929, Du Bois endorsed Democrat Jimmy Walker {{for mayor of}} New York, rather than the socialist Norman Thomas, believing that Walker could do more immediate good for blacks, even though Thomas' platform was more consistent with Du Bois's views. Throughout the 1920s, Du Bois and the NAACP shifted support {{back and forth between}} the Republican Party and the Democratic Party, induced by promises from <b>the</b> <b>candidates</b> to fight lynchings, improve working conditions, or support voting rights in the South; invariably, <b>the</b> <b>candidates</b> failed to deliver on their promises.|$|E

50|$|Before {{getting to}} the car, the {{examiner}} will ask <b>the</b> <b>candidate</b> to read a car's number plate at a distance.

If <b>the</b> <b>candidate</b> needs glasses to do this, then they must be worn during the test. If <b>the</b> <b>candidate</b> fails to read the first number plate correctly, then the examiner asks <b>the</b> <b>candidate</b> to read a second number plate. If <b>the</b> <b>candidate</b> cannot correctly read the second number plate, then the examiner must use a tape measure to measure the correct distance between <b>the</b> <b>candidate</b> and a third number plate.

30|$|When a {{question}} written in natural language is {{input into the}} system, the system carries out keyword extraction in the question analysis module.

The size of <b>the</b> <b>candidate</b> answers varies according to their question types, e.g., a phrase or a sentence. A sentence or a paragraph will be <b>the</b> <b>candidate</b> answer when <b>the</b> QA is non-factoid. Finally, the system estimates the qualities of <b>the</b> <b>candidate</b> answers that were obtained in <b>the</b> <b>candidate</b> answer extraction module in <b>the</b> <b>candidate</b> answer evaluation module.|$|R
