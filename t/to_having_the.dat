In October 2017, Batman vs. Two-Face writer Michael Jelenic stated that he originally pitched an animated film based on Smith's Superman Lives script, saying that Warner Bros seriously considered it for a long time. According to Jelenic, Cage would have loved to voice Superman in the film, but the idea never materialized and Jelenic's pitch was eventually abandoned.|$|E

5|$|In {{what was}} the Rockets' first all-time meeting against Navy, 14 {{unanswered}} points {{in the fourth quarter}} gave the Midshipmen the 14–10 win at the Glass Bowl. Toledo led 10–0 as they entered the fourth quarter with points scored on a 34-yard Hanna field goal in the first and on a six-yard David Andrews touchdown run in the third. Navy came back to win the game in the fourth on a pair of Jason Pace touchdowns. The first came on a nine-yard run and the second on a five-yard reception from Alton Grizzard. The loss effectively resulted in the Rockets failing to get a bowl bid as Central Michigan got the automatic MAC bid to the California Bowl due <b>to</b> <b>having</b> <b>the</b> tiebreaker over Toledo.|$|E

5|$|The Panhandles' opening {{game against}} the Dayton Triangles is {{considered}} to be the first football game between two APFA teams. The Panhandles lost 14–0 to the Triangles. Despite the first two quarters resulting in ties, the crowd was excited. In the second quarter, the Triangles made a goal line stand while the Panhandles had the ball on the 3-yard line. Before halftime, the Triangles' Al Mahrt completed a 30-yard pass to Dutch Thiele, which resulted in the Triangles <b>to</b> <b>having</b> <b>the</b> ball on the 5-yard line. The Triangles' did not score on that possession due to the clock running out.|$|E

Five F-28s were delivered {{in the course of}} a year, in addition to one aircraft that was leased periodically until 1971. There were several technical problems due <b>to</b> <b>having</b> <b>the</b> earliest models of the F-28, causing some operational difficulties. Two DC-6s were sold, and all but three of the F-27s were sold to Fokker between October 1968 and May 1969. Along with the aircraft came a new simulator, and the simulator division was moved from Sola to Fornebu. On 27 February 1970, the company took into use an IT-system, based at Sola.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the game}} often {{considered}} the first true survival horror, due <b>to</b> <b>having</b> <b>the</b> most influence on Resident Evil, was the 1989 release Sweet Home, for the Nintendo Entertainment System. It {{was created by}} Tokuro Fujiwara, who would later go on to create Resident Evil. Sweet Homes gameplay focused on solving a variety of puzzles using items stored in a limited inventory, while battling or escaping from horrifying creatures, {{which could lead to}} permanent death for any of the characters, thus creating tension and an emphasis on survival. It was also the first attempt at creating a scary and frightening storyline within a game, mainly told through scattered diary entries left behind fifty years before the events of the game. Developed by Capcom, the game would become the main inspiration behind their later release Resident Evil. Its horrific imagery prevented its release in the Western world, though its influence was felt through Resident Evil, which was originally intended to be a remake of the game. Some consider Sweet Home to be the first true survival horror game.|$|E
5|$|On August 13, 2015, {{as part of}} {{a five-year}} {{programming}} and development deal, Sesame Workshop announced that first-run episodes of Sesame Street would move to premium television service HBO (which had not aired any original children's programming since 2005) in late 2015. Sesame Workshop sought the deal because of declining revenue from viewer donations, and decreases in distribution fees paid by PBS member stations and licensing for merchandise sales (particularly through Sesame Workshop's dependence upon revenue from DVD sales), with the intent <b>to</b> <b>having</b> <b>the</b> show remain on PBS in some fashion (HBO already had involvement in public television {{at the time of the}} deal, providing funding for the talk show Charlie Rose); the deal also came in the wake of changing viewer habits of American children over the previous ten years. HBO will hold first-run rights to all newer episodes of the series starting with season 46, after which they will air on PBS member stations following a nine-month exclusivity window, with no charge to the stations for airing the content; however, HBO has not announced whether first-run episodes will air on the pay service's main channel or its multiplex channel HBO Family. The agreement also gives HBO exclusive rights to stream past and future Sesame Street episodes on HBO Go and HBO Now – assuming those rights from Amazon Video and Netflix. On August 14, Sesame Workshop announced that it would phase out its in-house subscription streaming service, Sesame Go, as a standalone service; instead of shutting it down entirely, it intends to scale back its offerings to either provide access to a reduced slate of free content or act as a portal for Sesame Streets website.|$|E

5|$|The {{alkali metals}} {{all have the}} same crystal {{structure}} (body-centred cubic) and thus the only relevant factors are the number of atoms that can fit into a certain volume and the mass of one of the atoms, since density is defined as mass per unit volume. The first factor depends on the volume of the atom and thus the atomic radius, which increases going down the group; thus, the volume of an alkali metal atom increases going down the group. The mass of an alkali metal atom also increases going down the group. Thus, the trend for the densities of the alkali metals depends on their atomic weights and atomic radii; if figures for these two factors are known, the ratios between the densities of the alkali metals can then be calculated. The resultant trend is that the densities of the alkali metals increase down the table, with an exception at potassium. Due <b>to</b> <b>having</b> <b>the</b> lowest atomic weight of all the elements in their period and having the largest atomic radius for their periods, the alkali metals are the least dense metals in the periodic table. Lithium, sodium, and potassium are the only three metals in the periodic table that are less dense than water: in fact, lithium is the least dense known solid at room temperature.|$|E
5|$|Two {{days were}} {{dedicated}} towards shooting the pre-title sequence. It was filmed on location at Hedsor House in Buckinghamshire. The helicopter scenes took place inside an actual helicopter taking flight with some cast members on board, {{which would make}} the sequence more genuine as opposed <b>to</b> <b>having</b> <b>the</b> cast members sitting inside next to a green screen. The fight sequences between Sarkisiian's and Mani's men were orchestrated and performed by stunt coordinator Chrispin Leyfield and his stunt team, as {{there was very little}} time to train conventional actors. Director Alrick Riley wanted the fight sequences to be performed in the same style as in the Jason Bourne films. The abandoned warehouse used to hold Harry and Ruth were filmed in an abandoned leather factory near London Bridge. One of the meetings between Lucas and Sarah Caufield were originally intended to be shot on the London Eye, a location the producers had never used before. However, due to restrictions the filming crew felt they could not follow, it was shot in South Bank, opposite the Houses of Parliament, instead.|$|E
