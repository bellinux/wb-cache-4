40|$|The study {{investigates the}} {{potential}} of satellite observations of atmospheric <b>trace</b> <b>gases</b> for the investigation of export phenomena, in particular intercontinental transport. Atmospheric <b>trace</b> <b>gases</b> are measured by various satellite instruments in different wavelength ranges. Especially nadir viewing instruments operating in the UV/vis (and near IR) spectral range are sufficiently sensitive even for <b>trace</b> <b>gases</b> located in the troposphere (see e. g. Fishman et al., 1986). It was recently demonstrated that several <b>trace</b> <b>gases</b> located even in the planetary boundary layer (e. g.

40|$|One {{fundamental}} {{property and}} limitation of grid based models is {{their inability to}} identify spatial details smaller than the grid cell size. While decades of work have gone into developing sub-grid treatments for clouds and land surface processes in climate models, the quantitative understanding of sub-grid processes and variability for aerosols and their precursors is much poorer. In this study, WRF-Chem is used to simulate the <b>trace</b> <b>gases</b> and aerosols over central Mexico during the 2006 MILAGRO field campaign, with multiple spatial resolutions and emission/terrain scenarios. Our analysis focuses on quantifying the sub-grid variability (SGV) of <b>trace</b> <b>gases</b> and aerosols within a typical global climate model grid cell, i. e. 75 &times; 75 km 2 . Our results suggest that a simulation with 3 -km horizontal grid spacing adequately reproduces the overall transport and mixing of <b>trace</b> <b>gases</b> and aerosols downwind of Mexico City, while 75 -km horizontal grid spacing is insufficient to represent local emission and terrain-induced flows along the mountain ridge, subsequently affecting the transport and mixing of plumes from nearby sources. Therefore, the coarse model grid cell average may not correctly represent aerosol properties measured over polluted areas. Probability density functions (PDFs) for <b>trace</b> <b>gases</b> and aerosols show that secondary <b>trace</b> <b>gases</b> and aerosols, such as O 3 , sulfate, ammonium, and nitrate, {{are more likely to}} have a relatively uniform probability distribution (i. e. smaller SGV) over a narrow range of concentration values. Mostly inert and long-lived <b>trace</b> <b>gases</b> and aerosols, such as CO and BC, {{are more likely to have}} broad and skewed distributions (i. e. larger SGV) over polluted regions. Over remote areas, all <b>trace</b> <b>gases</b> and aerosols are more uniformly distributed compared to polluted areas. Both CO and O 3 SGV vertical profiles are nearly constant within the PBL during daytime, indicating that <b>trace</b> <b>gases</b> are very efficiently transported and mixed vertically by turbulence. But, simulated horizontal variability indicates that <b>trace</b> <b>gases</b> and aerosols are not well mixed horizontally in the PBL. During nighttime the SGV for <b>trace</b> <b>gases</b> is maximum at the surface, and quickly decreases with height. Unlike the <b>trace</b> <b>gases,</b> the SGV of BC and secondary aerosols reaches a maximum at the PBL top during the day. The SGV decreases with distance away from the polluted urban area, has a more rapid decrease for long-lived <b>trace</b> <b>gases</b> and aerosols than for secondary ones, and is greater during daytime than nighttime. The SGV of <b>trace</b> <b>gases</b> and aerosols is generally larger than for meteorological quantities. Emissions can account for up to 50 % of the SGV over urban areas such as Mexico City during daytime for less-reactive <b>trace</b> <b>gases</b> and aerosols, such as CO and BC. The impact of emission spatial variability on SGV decays with altitude in the PBL and is insignificant in the free troposphere. The emission variability affects SGV more significantly during daytime (rather than nighttime) and over urban (rather than rural or remote) areas. The terrain, through its impact on meteorological fields such as wind and the PBL structure, affects dispersion and transport of <b>trace</b> <b>gases</b> and aerosols and their SGV...|$|R

25|$|The <b>Trace</b> <b>Gas</b> Orbiter (TGO) is a Mars {{telecommunications}} orbiter {{and atmospheric}} gas analyzer mission that was launched on 14 March 2016.

It delivered the ExoMars Schiaparelli EDM lander and then proceed to map the sources of methane on Mars and other gases, and in doing so, help select the landing site for the ExoMars rover to be launched in 2020. The presence of methane in Mars' atmosphere is intriguing because its likely origin is either present-day life or geological activity. Upon {{the arrival of the}} rover in 2021, the orbiter would be transferred into a lower orbit where it would be able to perform analytical science activities as well as provide the Schiaparelli EDM lander and ExoMars rover with telecommunication relay. NASA provided an Electra telecommunications relay and navigation instrument to ensure communications between probes and rovers on the surface of Mars and controllers on Earth. The TGO would continue serving as a telecommunication relay satellite for future landed missions until 2022.|$|E
25|$|The isotopic {{composition}} of ice cores from continental ice sheets and alpine glaciers {{have been developed}} as temperature proxies since the 1950s. Samuel Epstein {{was one of the}} first to demonstrate the applicability of this proxy by measuring oxygen isotopes in Antarctic snow, and also pointed out complications in the stable isotope-temperature correlation caused by the history of the air masses from which the snow formed. Ice cores in Greenland and Antarctica can be thousands of meters thick and record snow {{isotopic composition}} of the past few glacial-interglacial cycles. Ice cores can be dated by layer counting on the top and ice flow modeling at depth, with additional age constraints from volcanic ash. Cores from Greenland and Antarctica can be aligned in age at high-resolution by comparing globally well-mixed <b>trace</b> <b>gas</b> (e.g. CH4) concentrations in the air bubbles trapped in the cores. Some of the first ice core records from Greenland and Antarctica with age estimates go back to the last 100,000 years, and showed a depletion in δD and δ18O in the last ice age. The ice core record has since been extended to the last 800,000 years in Antarctica, and at least 250,000 years in Greenland. One of the best δD-based ice core temperature records is from the Vostok ice core in Antarctica, which goes back to 420,000 years. The δD-temperature (of the inversion layer where snow forms) conversion in east Antarctica based on modern spatial gradient of δD (9‰/°C) is ΔTI=(ΔδDice-8Δδ18Osw)/9, which takes into account variations in seawater isotopic composition caused by global ice volume changes. It should be noted that many local effects can influence ice δD in addition to temperature. These effects include moisture origin and transport pathways, evaporation conditions and precipitation seasonality, which can be accounted for in more complicated models. Nevertheless, the Vostok ice core record shows some very important results: (1) A consistent δD depletion of ~70‰ during the last four glacial periods compared to interglacial times, corresponding to a cooling of 8°C in Antarctica; (2) A consistent drop of atmospheric CO2 concentration by 100 ppmv and CH4 drop by ~300 ppbv during glacial times relative to interglacials, suggesting a role of greenhouse gases in regulating global climate; (3) Antarctic air temperature and greenhouse gas concentration changes precede global ice volume and Greenland air temperature changes during glacial terminations, and greenhouse gases may be an amplifier of insolation forcing during glacial-interglacial cycles. Greenland ice core isotope records, in addition to showing glacial-interglacial cycles, also shows millennial-scale climate oscillations that may reflect reorganization in ocean circulation caused by ice melt charges. There have also been ice core records generated in alpine glacials on different continents. A record from the Andes Mountains in Peru shows a temperature decrease of 5-6°C in the tropics during the last ice age. A record from the Tibetan plateau shows a similar isotope shift and cooling during the last ice age. Other existing alpine glacial isotope records include Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania, Mount Altai and West Belukha Plateau in Russia, Mount Logan in Canada, the Fremont Glacier in Wyoming, USA, and the Illimani Ice Core in Bolivia, most of which cover an interval of the Holocene epoch.|$|E

The phi-IASI model implements two physically based inversion algorithms for the sequential retrieval of (a) the thermodynamic state of the atmosphere and (b) the tropospheric content of CO, CO 2, CH 4, and N 2 O from hyperspectral radiance observations of the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI). The retrieval algorithm for <b>trace</b> <b>gases</b> exploits the concept of partially scanned interferogram technique, which is a tool mostly suited for Fourier transform spectrometers in the infrared. Minor and <b>trace</b> <b>gases</b> retrievals for July 2010 are presented and compared to in situ observations from five Mediterranean, permanent, stations of the Global Atmospheric Watch (GAW) network. The comparison evidences a good general consistency between satellite and in situ observations.
