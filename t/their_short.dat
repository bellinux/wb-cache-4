5|$|Hatt-ı Hümâyûn Tasnifi is {{the catalog}} of the hatt-ı hümayuns {{belonging}} to the Âmedi Kalemi. It consists of 31 volumes listing 62,312 documents, with <b>their</b> <b>short</b> summaries. This catalog lists documents from 1730 to 1839 but covers primarily those from the reigns of Selim III and Mahmud II within this period.|$|E
5|$|In low-duty cycle echolocation, bats can {{separate}} their calls and returning echoes by time. They have to time <b>their</b> <b>short</b> calls to finish before echoes return. This {{is important because}} these bats contract their middle ear muscles when emitting a call, so they can avoid deafening themselves. The time interval between the call and echo allows them to relax these muscles, so they can clearly hear the returning echo. The delay of the returning echoes provides the bat {{with the ability to}} estimate the range to their prey.|$|E
5|$|In principle, the {{simultaneous}} occurrence of a Solar eclipse and a transit {{of a planet}} is possible. But these events are extremely rare because of <b>their</b> <b>short</b> durations. The next anticipated simultaneous occurrence of a Solar eclipse and a transit of Mercury will be on July 5, 6757, and a Solar eclipse and a transit of Venus is expected on April 5, 15232.|$|E

5|$|Pratincoles have short legs, {{very long}} pointed wings and long forked tails. Their most unusual feature for birds classed as waders {{is that they}} {{typically}} hunt their insect prey on the wing like swallows, although they can also feed on the ground. <b>Their</b> <b>short</b> bills are an adaptation to aerial feeding.|$|E
5|$|The rails are a {{large and}} very {{widespread}} family, with nearly 150 species. They are small to medium-sized, terrestrial or wetland birds, and <b>their</b> <b>short</b> bodies are often flattened laterally to help them move through dense vegetation. Island species readily become flightless; of 53 extant or recently extinct taxa restricted to islands, 32 have {{lost the ability to}} fly.|$|E
5|$|The {{sunbirds}} and spiderhunters {{are very}} small passerine birds which feed largely on nectar, although they will also take insects, especially when feeding young. Flight is fast and direct on <b>their</b> <b>short</b> wings. Most species can take nectar by hovering like a hummingbird, but usually perch to feed.|$|E

5|$|Aquarists also {{propagate}} animals {{behind the}} scenes for the aquarium’s exhibits. Since 1985, the aquarium has been deeply involved in jellyfish propagation, creating three temporary exhibitions and one permanent aquarium gallery within the Open Sea wing. In August 2016, aquarists cultured comb jellies {{for the first time}} in a laboratory, which may allow them to become a model organism. For the aquarium's temporary exhibition that opened in 2014, the aquarium cultured many cephalopods because of <b>their</b> <b>short</b> life cycles. A display in the exhibition showcased how aquarists rear different species of cephalopods, including the bigfin reef squid. In partnership with Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, at least two deep-sea cephalopod species have been displayed in the exhibition, including flapjack octopuses and the vampire squid.|$|E
5|$|Except for the aye-aye and the Lac Alaotra gentle lemur, lemurs are {{seasonal}} breeders {{with very}} short mating and birth seasons {{influenced by the}} highly seasonal availability of resources in their environment. Mating seasons usually last {{less than three weeks}} each year, with the female vagina opening up only during a few hours or days of her most receptive time of estrus. These narrow windows for reproduction and resource availability appear to relate to <b>their</b> <b>short</b> gestation periods, rapid maturation, and low basal metabolic rates, as well as the high energy costs of reproduction for females. This may also relate to the relatively high mortality rate among adult females and the higher proportion of adult males in some lemur populations—both unusual traits among primates. In both the aye-aye and Lac Alaotra gentle lemur, birth (parturition) occurs over a six-month period.|$|E
5|$|Following the German {{surrender}} in November 1918, {{most of the}} battleships of the Atlantic Fleet {{were used}} as transports to ferry American soldiers back from France. Ohio and her sisters were not so employed, however, owing to <b>their</b> <b>short</b> range and small size, which would not permit sufficient additional accommodations. Instead, she was sent to Philadelphia on 28 November and remained inactive there until 7 January 1919, when she was placed back in reserve. On 17 July, the ship was reclassified as BB-12. Following the 1922 Washington Naval Treaty, which mandated significant reductions in naval armaments, Ohio was stricken from the naval register on 31 May 1922 and sold for scrap on 24 March 1923.|$|E

5|$|Following the German {{surrender}} in November 1918, {{most of the}} battleships of the Atlantic Fleet {{were used}} as transports to ferry American soldiers back from France. Wisconsin and her sisters were not so employed, however, owing to <b>their</b> <b>short</b> range and small size, which would not permit sufficient additional accommodations. Wisconsin instead steamed to Cuba for training with the Atlantic Fleet into 1919. She went on a midshipmen training cruise to the Caribbean in mid-1919. On 15 May 1920, Wisconsin was decommissioned; she was reclassified as BB-9 on 17 July. She was eventually sold on 26 January 1922 and broken up for scrap.|$|E
5|$|Fossil {{records of}} Myxogastria are {{extremely}} rare. Due to <b>their</b> <b>short</b> lifespan and the fragile {{structures of the}} plasmodia and the fruit body, fossilisation and similar processes are not possible. Only their spores can be mineralised. The few known examples of fossilised living states are preserved in amber. Up to 2010, three fruit bodies, two spores and one plasmodium have been described. Two older taxaCharles Eugène Bertrand's Myxomycetes mangini and Bretonia hardingheni from 1892are now considered dubious and are today often disregarded. Friedrich Walter Domke described in 1952 a 35 to 40million year old find in Baltic amber of Stemonitis splendens, an extant species. The state and completeness of the fruit bodies are remarkable, enabling accurate determination. From the same period, location and material is an Arcyria sulcata, first described in 2003 by Heinrich Dörfelt and Alexander Schmidt, a species very similar to today's Arcyria denudata. Both discoveries imply that the fruit bodies of the Myxogastria have changed only slightly in the last 35 to 40million years.|$|E
5|$|Having {{the largest}} wing-area-to-body-weight ratio of any bird, {{frigatebirds}} are essentially aerial. This {{allows them to}} soar continuously and only rarely flap their wings. One great frigatebird, being tracked by satellite in the Indian Ocean, stayed aloft for two months. They can fly higher than 4,000 meters in freezing conditions. Like swifts {{they are able to}} spend the night on the wing, but they will also return to an island to roost on trees or cliffs. Field observations in the Mozambique Channel found that great frigatebirds could remain on the wing for up to 12 days while foraging. Highly adept, they use their forked tails for steering during flight and make strong deep wing-beats, though not suited to flying by sustained flapping. Frigatebirds bathe and clean themselves in flight by flying low and splashing at the water surface before preening and scratching afterwards. Conversely, frigatebirds do not swim and with <b>their</b> <b>short</b> legs cannot walk well or take off from the sea easily.|$|E

5|$|In frogs the {{pelvic girdle}} is robust and the hind legs are much longer and {{stronger}} than the forelimbs. The feet have four or five digits and the toes are often webbed for swimming or have suction pads for climbing. Frogs have large eyes and no tail. Salamanders resemble lizards in appearance; <b>their</b> <b>short</b> legs project sideways, the belly is close to or {{in contact with the}} ground and they have a long tail. Caecilians superficially resemble earthworms and are limbless. They burrow by means of zones of muscle contractions which move along the body and they swim by undulating their body from side to side.|$|E
5|$|Made in Berlin in the 1930s, the Columbus Globe for State and Industry Leaders {{was located}} in Hitler's office {{throughout}} most of its existence. It became widely known in the United States after comedian Charlie Chaplin parodied it in his 1940 film The Great Dictator. Comedy group The Three Stooges also made fun of it in two of <b>their</b> <b>short</b> subject comedies. One of the two limited editions was looted by John Barsamia, a private in the U.S. Army, at Hitler's summer retreat shortly {{after the war and}} sold 60 years later at an auction in San Francisco for $100,000. The globe in Hitler's office replaced Ethiopia with Italian East Africa and was known for its size as well as manufacturing cost.|$|E
5|$|Male spiders {{identify}} themselves {{by a variety}} of complex courtship rituals to avoid being eaten by the females. Males of most species survive a few matings, limited mainly by <b>their</b> <b>short</b> life spans. Females weave silk egg-cases, each of which may contain hundreds of eggs. Females of many species care for their young, for example by carrying them around or by sharing food with them. A minority of species are social, building communal webs that may house anywhere from a few to 50,000 individuals. Social behavior ranges from precarious toleration, as in the widow spiders, to co-operative hunting and food-sharing. Although most spiders live for at most two years, tarantulas and other mygalomorph spiders can live up to 25years in captivity.|$|E

5|$|Most {{observed}} events (70%) have a {{duration of}} greater than two seconds and {{are classified as}} long gamma-ray bursts. Because these events constitute {{the majority of the}} population and because they tend to have the brightest afterglows, they have been observed in much greater detail than <b>their</b> <b>short</b> counterparts. Almost every well-studied long gamma-ray burst has been linked to a galaxy with rapid star formation, and in many cases to a core-collapse supernova as well, unambiguously associating long GRBs with the deaths of massive stars. Long GRB afterglow observations, at high redshift, are also consistent with the GRB having originated in star-forming regions.|$|E
5|$|Natural thorium {{is usually}} almost pure 232Th, {{which is the}} longest-lived and most stable isotope of thorium, having a {{half-life}} comparable {{to the age of}} the universe. Its radioactive decay is the largest single contributor to the Earth's internal heat; the other major contributors are the shorter-lived primordial radionuclides, which are 238U, 40K, and 235U in descending order of their contribution. (At the time of the Earth's formation, 40K and 235U contributed much more by virtue of <b>their</b> <b>short</b> half-lives, but they have decayed more quickly, leaving the contribution from 232Th and 238U predominant.) The other natural thorium isotopes are much shorter-lived; of them, only 230Th is usually detectable, occurring in secular equilibrium with its parent 238U, and making up at most 0.04% of natural thorium.|$|E
5|$|Roguelike-likes are {{generally}} much shorter games {{intended to be}} winnable within a single gaming session, in contrast to traditional roguelikes that are designed for multiple sessions of gameplay. Associated with <b>their</b> <b>short</b> length, many roguelike-likes feature a metagame, whereby achieving certain goals will unlock features {{such as the ability}} to select a new character {{at the start of the}} game or the addition of new items and monsters in the procedural generation of the game's levels. Several roguelike-likes feature daily challenges, in which a preset random seed is used to generate the game's levels in a deterministic fashion so that each player will have the same encounters; players attempt to complete the game through those levels or otherwise get the highest score through online leaderboards. Roguelike-likes may also allow the player to enter the random seed directly as to be able to rechallenge the same set of levels or share a difficult set of levels with other players.|$|E
