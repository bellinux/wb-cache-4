25|$|Nineteen-year-old Margaret Hale happily {{returns home}} from London to the idyllic {{southern}} village of Helstone after her cousin Edith marries Captain Lennox. She lived for almost 10 {{years in the}} city with Edith and wealthy Aunt Shaw <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a young lady. Margaret has refused an offer of marriage from the captain's brother, Henry, an up-and-comng barrister. Her life is turned upside down when her father, the local pastor, leaves the Church of England and the rectory of Helstone {{as a matter of}} conscience; his intellectual honesty has made him a dissenter. At the suggestion of Mr. Bell, his old friend from Oxford, he settles with his wife and daughter in Milton-Northern (where Mr. Bell was born and owns property). The industrial town in Darkshire (a textile-producing region) manufactures cotton and {{is in the middle of}} the Industrial Revolution; masters and workers are clashing in the first organised strikes.|$|E
25|$|The P-47D-16, D-20, D-22 and D-23 {{were similar}} to the P-47D-15 with minor {{improvements}} in the fuel system, engine subsystems, (the P-47D-20 introduced the R-2800-59 engine) a jettisonable canopy, and a bulletproof windshield. Beginning with the block 22 aircraft, the original narrow-chorded Curtiss propeller was replaced by propellers with larger blades, the Evansville plant switching to a new Curtiss propeller with a diameter of 13ft (3.96m) and the Long Island plant using a Hamilton Standard propeller with a diameter of 13ft 2in (4.01m). With the bigger propellers having barely 6in (152mm) of ground clearance, Thunderbolt pilots had <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> careful on takeoffs to keep the tail down until they obtained adequate ground clearance, and on landings to flare the aircraft properly. Failure to do so damaged both the propeller and the runway. A modification to the main gear legs was installed to extend the legs via an electric motor (un-extending before retraction) to accommodate the larger propeller diameter.|$|E

500|$|In 1924, Air Vice-Marshal Philip Game {{suggested}} to Ismay that he {{apply for a}} seat at the RAF Staff College, Andover. Although Ismay [...] "had no desire <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a pilot", he was happy for the opportunity to return to England, and went to study at the college. After completing the programme, he was approached about the possibility of serving as an Assistant Secretary of the Committee of Imperial Defence (CID) under Maurice Hankey. Ismay gladly accepted the position, starting work in December 1925. In the six months between finishing the Staff College and beginning at the CID, Ismay returned to India and held a staff position at the headquarters of the Indian Army in Simla.|$|E
500|$|Adams {{works closely}} with her acting coach Warner Loughlin, and credits Loughlin for helping her {{organize}} and structure her thoughts. She uses an acting method taught by Loughlin, in which she attempts an understanding of her character's psychology by creating the character's back-story {{from the age of}} three. Adams prefers to work with confident directors who give her space to think for herself. She stays in character while filming, and finds it difficult to detach herself from roles and accents. She is not influenced by the size of a role and is drawn towards both leading and supporting parts. Describing herself as an obsessive performer, Adams has said, [...] "I'm never satisfied with the take. I'll walk away from it, but I could go and go and go. I've had <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> OK with it." ...|$|E

500|$|Originally, {{songwriter}} Stephen Schwartz, who {{had just}} recently worked as a lyricist opposite composer Alan Menken on Disney's Pocahontas (1995) and The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996), was slated to write the lyrics for Mulan, but he was replaced by Zippel [...] "at the last moment." [...] Schwartz had written a song called [...] "We'll Make a Man of You" [...] for [...] "when Mulan is trying <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a soldier". The song was eventually replaced by Wilder and Zippel's [...] "I'll Make a Man Out of You" [...] when Schwartz {{was forced to resign}} from Mulan by Disney executives Peter Schneider and Michael Eisner because the songwriter had also agreed to write the songs for rival film studio DreamWorks' animated feature film The Prince of Egypt (1998). According to The Musical Theater of Stephen Schwartz: From Godspell to Wicked and Beyond, Schwartz believed that he {{would have been able to}} work on both films simultaneously, but ultimately chose The Prince of Egypt instead because he felt pressured by Disney.|$|E
500|$|... was {{the first}} {{installment}} of the Star Trek franchise to show a live-action version of the holodeck technology, a computer program capable of creating virtual reality simulations chosen by the user. The precursor to the holodeck appeared originally in an episode of The Animated Series, [...] "The Practical Joker" [...] as a recreation room. While [...] "novellike stories" [...] were incorporated with the holodeck in The Next Generation, the writing team behind the development of [...] sought to further develop the idea by introducing {{the concept of the}} holonovel. Holonovels were distinguished from past examples of holodeck technology through their use of more [...] "complex narratives" [...] and the user's active participation as one of the characters. Voyagers writers conceived holonovels as futuristic updates of audiobooks, and defined them as computer programs enabling the user to [...] "experience total, physical immersion in the story, with a full spectrum of sensations in every way". In his book A Vision of the Future, Stephan Edward Poe writes that the idea built a foundation for a variety of storylines by providing: [...] "new ways for crew members <b>to</b> <b>learn...</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> their own heroes in self-directed sages, or even use their stories as a safe and acceptable means of released pent-up emotions." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1952, Walker was accidentally {{wounded in}} the right eye by a shot from a BB gun fired by one of her brothers. In 2013, on BBC Radio's Desert Island Discs, she said the act was {{deliberate}} but she agreed to protect her brother against their parents' anger if they knew the truth. Because the family had no car, the Walkers could not take their daughter to a hospital for immediate treatment. By {{the time they reached}} a doctor a week later, she had become permanently blind in that eye. When a layer of scar tissue formed over her wounded eye, Alice became self-conscious and painfully shy. Stared at and sometimes taunted by other children, she felt like an outcast and turned for solace to reading and to writing poetry. When she was 14, the scar tissue was removed. She later became valedictorian and was voted most-popular girl, as well as queen of her senior class, but she realized that her traumatic injury had some value: it had allowed her to begin [...] "really to see people and things, really to notice relationships and <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> patient enough to care about how they turned out".|$|E

2500|$|In his 2009 book [...] "Parkour", David Belle {{stressed}} {{that the most important}} aspect of parkour is not the physical movements, but rather the practitioner's mentality and understanding of its principles. [...] "When young trainees come to see me and give me videos telling me to check out what they are doing, I just take the tape and throw it away. What I'm interested in is what the guy's got in his head, if he has self-confidence, if he masters the technique, if he has understood the principles of parkour. I just can't deal with guys who do Parkour because they saw videos on the Internet and thought it was kinda cool and want to do even better." [...] Further, he states the importance of traceurs being aware of their abilities and limitations, and developing in their own way. [...] "When a young person asks me: 'Can you show me how to do this?' I simply answer: [...] "No, I am going to show you how I do it. Then, you'll have to learn with your own technique, your own way of moving, your style, your abilities and your limitations.

At a November 2011 meeting between the two groups, HaKohen was quoted as saying: [...] "The first step towards achieving peace is for both populations <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> good neighbors. And this is less relevant to people in Tel Aviv {{than it is to}} ethnic Jews living here in Samaria. ... Both populations need to learn to see and accept the other as indigenous and belonging here. The closest people in the world to the Jewish people are the Arabs. Any hostility between our two peoples is completely unnatural and the result of foreign powers exploiting both populations. ... If we examine the last two decades, we see that thousands of people have been killed on both sides and that our two populations have been forcibly segregated. ... Both peoples have also suffered several other injustices. Thousands of Jews have been forcibly expelled from their homes and turned into refugees. Entire towns and villages have been destroyed. And Arabs have their freedom of movement restricted by a military bureaucracy every day of their lives. ... Before Oslo there were no checkpoints or walls here and everyone could travel wherever they liked. Peoples lived together in a situation that may not have been perfect but was still much better than the situation we see today." ...|$|E
2500|$|Frontman James Veck-Gilodi {{has spoken}} {{at length about}} the themes of each song on the album, {{describing}} them as 'very personal and each is a small story that depicts {{a part of my}} life'. Much of the album is about nostalgia, underachievement and anxiety, which are all topics which are personal to him as he wrote all the lyrics for the album. The opening track [...] "The Past Six Years", from whose lyrics the album takes its title, is described as 'an ode to... not really achieving as much as we'd have liked'. The lyrics make reference to friends and fellow bands Lower Than Atlantis and Young Guns and how James feels 'a perpetual bitterness and jealousy towards them in terms of their achievements, {{despite the fact that they}} are close friends'. [...] "I'm a Bore, Mostly" [...] also deals with the topic of underachievement, with James explaining that the song is about 'the mundane daily routine I had when I was living in London. ...I couldn't deal with city life, I rarely left the house and found myself sinking into this terrible routine. I didn't really appreciate anything at the time and I had no enthusiasm'. He has claimed he wrote the song [...] "Filthy Rotten Scoundrel" [...] about himself; 'I need <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> grateful and appreciate the opportunities that I have been given. It's also about my fear of living, dying and never really achieving anything'. [...] "The World or Nothing" [...] continues this trend, with James describing the theme as 'the vicious cycle of feeling lost and resorting to the aid of alcohol while also feeling lost because of alcohol. It talks about how self-destructive a lot of us are and how we enjoy abusing our bodies'. Of [...] "Nelson's County", Veck-Gilodi has said: 'This song is about the county of Norfolk and how a lot of the people who reside there seem to have no real ambition other than working a 9-5, raising a family and living a normal life'.|$|E
