Where normal mouse control uses single-click for selection and double-click to open/edit/etc, the xmouse system automatically selects objects after hovering the mouse over the object for {{a certain period of}} time (often one second). <b>The</b> <b>context</b> <b>function,</b> previously activated by double-clicking, is activated by single-clicking. Double-clicking is made redundant by this system and is ignored. Operation of menus, text selection and other features remain unchanged.|$|E
40|$|Compound {{decision}} theory is employed {{to develop a}} general statistical model for classifying image data using spatial context. The classification algorithm developed from this model exploits the tendency of certain ground-cover classes to occur more frequently in some spatial contexts than in others. A key input to this contextural classifier is a quantitative characterization of this tendency: <b>the</b> <b>context</b> <b>function.</b> Several methods for estimating <b>the</b> <b>context</b> <b>function</b> are explored, and two complementary methods are recommended. The contextural classifier is shown to produce substantial improvements in classification accuracy compared to the accuracy produced by a non-contextural uniform-priors maximum likelihood classifier when these methods of estimating <b>the</b> <b>context</b> <b>function</b> are used. An approximate algorithm, which cuts computational requirements by over one-half, is presented. The search for an optimal implementation is furthered by {{an exploration of the}} relative merits of using spectral classes or information classes for classification and/or context function estimation...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{investigations}} {{have demonstrated the}} effectiveness of a contextual classifier that combines spatial and spectral information employing a general statistical approach. This statistical classification algorithm exploits the tendency of certain ground cover classes to occur more frequently in some spatial contexts than in others. Indeed, a key input to this algorithm is a statistical characterization of the context: <b>the</b> <b>context</b> <b>function.</b> An unbiased estimator of <b>the</b> <b>context</b> <b>function</b> is discussed which, besides having the advantage of statistical unbiasedness, has the additional advantage over other estimation techniques of being amenable to an adaptive implementation in which the context-function estimate varies according to local contextual information. Results from applying the unbiased estimator to the contextual classification of three real Landsat data sets are presented and contrasted with results from noncontextual classifications and from contextual classifications utilizing other context-function estimation techniques...|$|E

In this paper, we present a new algorithm that capitalizes from the advantages of both the strategies.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this master’s thesis, written in French, is to examine some of the {{challenges}} that the content marketing genre poses on translation. More specifically, it studies the author’s translation of the medical advice published on the website GammeDolipraneConseils. fr: a site published by the company behind a French line of pain-killers. The functionalist Skopos theory, particularly as described by Christiane Nord, answers for the theoretical background, as well as adding {{to the understanding of}} the purpose of the source text. To understand what is being sold, the notion of conceptual metaphor and the previous research made on medical metaphors are used. The translated website was created to make the line Doliprane more visible online, by using search engine optimization (SEO) and content marketing. Analysing the skopos (purpose) of the source text allows the translator to understand the text and its distinctive problems. One of the characteristic problems found in this translation, is the balancing between the use of correct terms, which in the case of medical advice creates a sense of authority, and the way that search engines understand, index and show a website to its users. This type of text puts terminology in a new light, as each specialised word becomes more than a term, but also a keyword for the search engine. As shown in the analysis, this can both limit and broaden the way the terms are translated, from using two words (smärta and värk) where there were only one (douleur), or diminish it (using only huvudvärk for maux de tête and céphalée). A content marketing text is, although it is not always obvious, also a part of a campaign that aims to sell. To keep with the genre’s soft-sell approach, the products or services marketed need to be presented in a discrete way. Our translated text tries to sell pain-killers, or more abstractly the decreasing of pain, and the notion of conceptual metaphor helps to analyse and understand how to express this purpose. This translation shows that though there are some concepts that are equal in the source and target language, most are not. Adapting a concept proposed by other scholars, our finds suggest that the concept of PAIN IS A MOVEMENT can complement the recognized concept of PAIN IS A WAR in understanding the expressions of pain and painkillers in Swedish. Furthermore, our examination of the expressions of the decreasing of pain shows that there are more verbs used to express this in French, than in Swedish. The results suggest that the Skopos theory is highly useful when it comes to translating content marketing, and that the functionalist analysis proposed by Nord is particularity helpful in understanding <b>the</b> <b>context,</b> <b>function</b> and {{purpose of this}} sort of text – a genre that is increasingly important in our modern world...|$|E
