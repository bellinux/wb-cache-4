When the first check came after I entered the firm, Mr. Thurmond brought to my desk one-third of the amount of the check, explaining what it was for. I said to him <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> member of the Legislature, representing the people of Fannin County, and that my experience had taught me that men who represent the people should be as far removed as possible from concerns whose interests he was liable to be called on to legislate concerning, and that on that ground I would not accept a dollar of the railroad's money, though I was legally entitled to it. I never did take a dollar of it. I have been guided by the principle in all my dealings.|$|E
25|$|Peru is {{investigating}} claims that a beauty pageant contestant was lured to Gabon {{to become the}} lover of its 67-year-old president, Omar Bongo, and was stranded for nearly two weeks after she refused. A spokesman for Mr. Bongo said {{he was unaware of}} the allegations. The Peruvian Foreign Ministry said that Ivette Santa Maria, a 22-year-old Miss Peru America contestant, was invited to Gabon to be a hostess for a pageant there. In an interview, Ms. Santa Maria said that she was taken to Mr. Bongo's presidential palace hours after her Jan. 19 arrival and that as he joined her, he pressed a button and some sliding doors opened, revealing a large bed. She said, I told him I was not a prostitute, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> Miss Peru. She fled and guards offered to drive her to a hotel. Without money to pay the bill, however, she was stranded in Gabon for 12 days until international women's groups and others intervened.|$|E

40|$|Are there good {{grounds for}} {{thinking}} that the moral values of action are {{to be derived from}} those of character? This ‘virtue ethical’ claim is sometimes thought of as a kind of normative ethical theory; sometimes as form of opposition to any such theory. However, the best case to be made for it supports neither of these claims. Rather, it leads us to a distinctive view in moral epistemology: the view that my warrant for a particular moral judgement derives from my warrant for believing <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>a</b> good moral judge. This view seems to confront a regress-problem. For the belief <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>a</b> good moral judge <b>is</b> itself <b>a</b> particular moral judgement. So it seems that, on this view, I need to derive my warrant for believing <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>a</b> good moral judge from my warrant for believing <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>a</b> good judge of moral judges; and so on. I show how this worry can be met, and trace the implications of the resulting view for warranted moral judgement. Garrett Cullit...|$|R

500|$|Props {{specialist}} Ken Hawryliw {{claimed the}} biggest challenge in producing the episode was finding Christmas paper from the 1980s for the flashback sequences. Casting director Corrine Mays had difficulty finding an actress to play Dana Scully's 1976 self before executive producer Robert Goodwin {{came up with the}} idea of using Gillian Anderson's fourteen-year-old sister Zoë for the role. Gillian Anderson, while liking the finalized episode, believed that she never was able to capture the complex relationship between herself and Emily, stating: [...] "I felt in the end <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> little low energy, a little too melancholy. It was hard to find the right attitude for Scully in dealing with a child that's apparently hers; to find the right flavor of relationship to her and this disease she's going through, all mixed up with the aspect of the paranormal." [...] Anderson also admitted that another issue she had was that [...] "she had no history with this child" [...] so she was unable to [...] "play the kind of attachment I would feel if my own daughter, Piper, were going through the same thing.|$|E

[...] Madonna said: [...] "From the very beginning of my career, people have been writing shit about me and saying, 'She's a one-hit wonder, she'll disappear after a year'." [...] She responded to the comment [...] "Minnie Mouse on helium" [...] by doing a photoshoot with Alberto Tolot, where she flirted with a giant Mickey Mouse toy, putting its hand inside her dress and looking at it with an admonishing glare. Author Debbi Voller noted that [...] "such provocative imagery at a young age of her career, could have hurt her too much. But it went on to shut those twerps who dared to take a swag at her voice again." [...] Twenty-five years later, in her acceptance speech of Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction, Madonna thanked the critics who snubbed her in the early years, [...] "The ones that said I was talentless, that I was chubby, that I couldn't sing, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> one-hit wonder.

500|$|For her {{portrayal}} of Valene, Van Ark received two Soap Opera Digest awards {{in the category}} [...] "Outstanding Actress in a Leading Role on a Prime Time Serial". Greg Hernandez said, [...] "Before I go on, I have to confess <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> die-hard fan of Knots Landing, the series on which Joan played sweet Valene Ewing for 14 years. Her character of Valene was a best-selling author but her personal life was always a mess. She had her husband, Gary, stolen by another woman then got pregnant by him, her twin babies were kidnapped by a crooked doctor, she was given a drug overdose at gunpoint by her ex-husband's fiancee, and she racked up enough marriages to give Elizabeth Taylor a run for her money. But she and Gary Ewing (Ted Shackleford) made for one of television's most beloved couples and the audience never stopped rooting {{for them to get}} back together. Joan keeps in touch with Ted (pictured with Joan, above at a [...] "Knots" [...] reunion a few years back), Michelle Lee - who played her best friend Karen - and the great stage star Julie Harris who played her mother." [...] Knots Landing itself has experienced a tremendous fan following and dedication. Van Ark said of this, [...] "It’s amazing. It’s like having friends everywhere in the United States. I heard that a group a fans from London were coming in just to see us at this (autograph convention). We get a lot of fan mail from Europe – France, Germany, Russia. Knots has a huge following, and I think fans of the show are loving and loyal. Not many shows last 14 years on prime-time. That’s a milestone, and I’m very proud of it." ...|$|E
40|$|Most philosophers, {{including}} all materialists I know of, believe <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>a</b> complex thing?a thing with parts?and that my mental life <b>is</b> (or <b>is</b> <b>a</b> result of) {{the interaction of}} these parts. These philosophers often believe <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>a</b> body or a brain, and my mental life <b>is</b> (or <b>is</b> <b>a</b> product of) brain activity. In this paper, I develop and defend a novel argument against this view. The argument turns on certainty, that highest epistemic status that a precious few of our beliefs enjoy. For example, {{on the basis of}} introspection, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> certain <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not in fierce pain right now. But if <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>a</b> complex thing like a body or a brain, then introspection might <b>be</b> <b>a</b> causal series of events extended in time. And any such process could go awry. So, if introspection <b>is</b> such <b>a</b> process, then I could gain good evidence that the introspective process has gone awry and <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> contrary to appearances, feeling fierce pain right now. Therefore, the view <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>a</b> complex thing like a body or a brain forces open the possibility <b>that</b> <b>I</b> cannot <b>be</b> certain <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not feeling fierce pain right now. Since that <b>is</b> clearly not <b>an</b> open possibility, it follows <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not <b>a</b> complex thing. I conclude by responding to three objections...|$|R

500|$|Fun Home {{has several}} themes {{recurring}} throughout the book. The biggest theme, arguably, is sexual orientation. Bechdel tells {{the readers of}} her journey of discovering her own sexuality through books. [...] "My realization at nineteen <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> lesbian came about {{in a manner consistent}} with my bookish upbringing." [...] Her exposure (from reading literal definitions in dictionaries, reading interviews of others like her, etc.) helped her come to terms with her sexuality, but in truth, the hints of it plagued her childhood: her desire [...] "for the right to exchange [...] tank suit for a pair of shorts" [...] in Cannes" [...] or her desire for her brothers to call her Albert instead of Alison on one camping trip. [...] However, Bechdel also reveals that she wasn't alone in her choice of partners; her father also exhibited some homosexual behaviors, but in a different way than Alison. [...] "I'd been upstaged, demoted from protagonist in my own drama to comic relief in my parents' tragedy" [...] when her mother reveals Bechdel's father's secret. Though both, father and daughter, had similar situations (Bechdel was a lesbian while her father was gay or bisexual), the two handled their issues differently. Bechdel chose to accept the fact and not hide from the issue, taking a female partner and going to [...] "gay union" [...] meetings when she was a student at Oberlin College. Bechdel was open about her sexuality before she'd even been in a same-sex relationship (of any sort). Her father, on the other hand, had had countless affairs with men but wasn't open about it. [...] This may be due to homophobia (his and/or others'), or because he was married with a family. In any case, it is clear that he is afraid of coming out, as illustrated by [...] "the fear in his eyes" [...] when the conversation topic is dangerously close to homosexuality.|$|E
2500|$|One {{of the two}} quotes {{appearing}} on the Stone of Hope and attributed to King, [...] "I was a drum major for justice, peace and righteousness", is a paraphrased version of King's actual words, which were: [...] "If {{you want to say}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> drum major, say <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> drum major for justice. Say <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> drum major for peace. I was a drum major for righteousness. And all of the other shallow things will not matter." [...] The Washington Posts Rachel Manteuffel noticed the change and publicized it in an August 25, 2011 column, arguing that the revised quote misrepresented both King himself and the meaning of the 1968 sermon from which it was taken, in which King imagined the sort of eulogy he might receive.|$|E

The words on the other side of the stone used to read, [...] "I Was a Drum Major for Justice, Peace, and Righteousness", which is a paraphrased version of a longer quote by King: [...] "If you want to say <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> drum major, say <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> drum major for justice. Say <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> drum major for peace. I was a drum major for righteousness. And all of the other shallow things will not matter."
