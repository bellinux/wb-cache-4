500|$|Despite {{the success}} of the game, the Miller {{brothers}} eventually pursued other projects. Robyn Miller said: [...] "I {{think it would be a}} detriment to always, for <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>lives,</b> be creating Myst-like projects. [...] We're going to change, evolve and grow, just like any person does in any manner." [...] Robyn would leave Cyan to form a new development company called Land of Point; Vander Wende would also leave to pursue other projects. The next video game entry in the Myst franchise would be 2001's , which was not developed by Cyan nor published by Brøderbund. Presto Studios took over development; Ubisoft acquired Brøderbund's entertainment library from The Learning Company and published the Myst sequels.|$|E
500|$|Leading {{up to the}} event, The Portland Mercury Erik Henriksen {{encouraged}} {{readers to}} join the march, writing: [...] "Trump's hostility to science isn't just an attack on humankind's accumulated knowledge—it's an attack on all of us, and its repercussions will affect everyone on Earth, every day, for <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>lives.</b> Time to fight back." [...] KOIN said organizers portrayed the demonstration as [...] "political but not partisan, promoting the understanding of science as well as defending it from various attacks, including proposed U.S. government budget cuts under President Donald Trump". Similarly, Maggie Vespa of KGW said, [...] "Although organizers trumpeted the event's 'nonpartisan' platform, participants in Portland were quick to take aim at President Trump's proposed funding cuts to scientific research agencies." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{they grew}} older Madonna {{and her sisters}} would feel deep sadness as the vivid memory of their mother began {{drifting}} farther from them. They would study pictures of her and come {{to think that she}} resembled poet Anne Sexton and Hollywood actresses. This would later raise Madonna's interest in poetry, with Sylvia Plath being her favourite. Later, Madonna commented: [...] "We were all wounded {{in one way or another}} by , and then we spent <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>lives</b> reacting to it or dealing with it or trying to turn into something else. The anguish of losing my mom left me with a certain kind of loneliness and an incredible longing for something. If I hadn't had that emptiness, I wouldn't have been so driven. Her death had a lot to do with me saying—after I got over my heartache—I'm going to be really strong if I can't have my mother. I'm going to take care of myself." [...] Taraborrelli felt that in time, no doubt because of the devastation she felt, Madonna would never again allow herself, or even her daughter, to feel as abandoned as she had felt when her mother died. [...] "Her death had taught [...] a valuable lesson, that she would have to remain strong for herself because, she feared weakness—particularly her own—and wanted to be the queen of her own castle." ...|$|E

Pete Laurie of theMusic website found [...] "isn't about reinventing the wheel, but it never sounds like a lazy rehash of {{the good old days}} either". Lewis explained to The Ages Martin Boulton [...] "We got to a point after the re-formation where we decided not to put an end date on it [...] we said we can't keep playing that same period [...] for <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>lives</b> [...] While we love it and we know our fans love it … in order to be a relevant, creative unit [...] for our own personal satisfaction more than anything, we've got to try writing again and doing something new together and that's been really interesting and amazing".

On May 13, 2012, CSI: Miami was canceled. Series star Emily Procter later stated that [...] "the cancellation was kind of shocking for everyone because they had given an indication that [...] might go, so people would have been prepared and we just weren't prepared." [...] Procter had previously commented on the longevity of the series, commenting that [...] "I remember sitting around with David in the parking lot during season one, getting ready for the first episode to air.

2500|$|It was reputedly {{the first}} in Ireland, and was ordered from Fender by Jim Connolly, a showband member {{performing}} with The Irish Showband. Connolly ordered a cherry red Stratocaster through Crowley's music shop in Cork in 1961. When Fender shipped a sunburst Stratocaster instead, it was put up on sale in 1963 as a second-hand instrument, which Gallagher bought in August 1963 for just under £100 at Crowley's Music Store on Cork's McCurtain Street. Speaking about Gallagher's purchase of the famous Stratocaster his brother Dónal recalled: [...] "His dream ambition {{was to have a}} guitar like Buddy Holly... This Stratocaster was in the store as a used instrument, it was 100 pounds... in today's money you couldn't even compare you might as well say it was a million pounds... my mother was saying we'll be in debt for <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>lives</b> and Rory said well actually with a guitar like this I can play both parts, rhythm and lead, we won't need a rhythm player so I can earn more money and pay it off so the Stratocaster became his partner for life if you like." ...|$|E

2500|$|The film {{opens with}} an {{introduction}} by Wood's friend, psychic Criswell: [...] "Greetings my friends! We are all {{interested in the}} future, For that is where you and I are going to spend <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>lives!</b> ...". (This line appears in the narration for the General Motors' [...] "Futurama" [...] ride and its accompanying film, To New Horizons, {{that were part of}} the 1939 New York World's Fair—years before Criswell's own television program.) At the time of filming, Criswell was the star of the KLAC Channel 13 (now KCOP-13) television series, Criswell Predicts. The introduction could be an allusion to the opening lines of his show, but since no episodes of the television show are known to survive, a comparison is impossible. Craig suggests that Criswell's public persona was based on the style of a charismatic preacher, perhaps influenced by early televangelists. Criswell addresses the viewers repeatedly as [...] "my friends", as if attempting to establish a bond between the speaker and the audience. The line is likely to derive from his show, and would not be out of place in a segment where a televangelist addresses his congregation. Another phrase of the introduction, [...] "Future events such as these will affect you in the future", served as a signature line for Criswell. He used it repeatedly in his newspaper and magazine columns, and probably his show as well.|$|E
2500|$|In January 2015, Capaldi {{became the}} first actor to portray the Doctor to not be shortlisted for a National Television Award since the series revival in 2005. Ahead of the British Academy Television Awards that year, Paul Flynn of The Guardian noted that Capaldi's {{portrayal}} of the Doctor {{had the effect of}} [...] "significantly reducing Doctor Whos glamour quotient". Later, Capaldi received a TV Choice Awards nomination for Best Actor. He was also nominated for a BAFTA Cymru Award in the Best Actor category for his acting in [...] "Dark Water". Steven Moffat praised his leading man stating [...] "we could argue for <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>lives</b> about who's the best Doctor — but for me, the best single performance in the role is settled forever. You can only ask a solo of a virtuoso, so thank God and Scotland for Peter Capaldi". Capaldi's predecessor, Matt Smith, praised him as having [...] "reinvented" [...] Doctor Who. Colin Baker praised the 12th Doctor noting [...] " [...] is grumpy and curmudgeonly and intolerant, and gosh – I should be playing it now. I wasn't old enough when I did it. I can do intolerant!" [...] " [...] costume is less annoying! I love his style, and I love his character". In a later interview, Baker expressed that Capaldi initially had ‘a rough deal’ as fans weren’t very kind towards his incarnation, as they had been conditioned towards ‘eye candy’ in the form of dashing role models including David Tennant and Matt Smith. [...] Sylvester McCoy also expressed his admiration for Capaldi's incarnation for being portrayed as an [...] "older" [...] Doctor, as opposed to his younger predecessors, he went on to elaborate his casting helped provide a life-affirming message to serve as an inspirational role model for children.|$|E
