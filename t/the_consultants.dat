5|$|Attorneys {{have long}} used {{peremptory}} challenges to exclude undesirable prospective jurors, {{but have not}} always been successful. Much of the early efforts were based on lawyers' folklore about who makes a good juror for their case. Early examples of scientific jury selection were similar. For example, in the 1975 Joan Little trial, defense attorneys used an astrologer to help choose the jury. More rigorous methodology was on display during the first major use of SJS, the 1972 Harrisburg Seven trial. During that trial, social scientists used demographic characteristics to identify biases in favor of conviction. <b>The</b> <b>consultants</b> in the case had conducted surveys that indicated women and Democrats would make defense-friendly jurors, and the religious, those with college degrees, and Reader's Digest subscribers would be better for the prosecution. Although surveys had indicated that 80% of citizens in conservative Harrisburg, Pennsylvania would convict the defendants, they were acquitted of all serious charges.|$|E

Their boss, Vice President of East Coast Television and Microwave Oven Programming for General Electric, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin), goes to the writers' room and tells the show's head writer, Liz Lemon (Tina Fey), about how the whole company is undergoing cutbacks. After an unsuccessful presentation about TGS, Brad Halster (Roger Bart)—one of <b>the</b> <b>consultants</b> {{in charge of the}} cutbacks—informs Liz that she needs to cut her annual budget by 25 percent. Liz, anxious about her employees losing their jobs, decides to use sexual bartering to solve the problem and asks Brad on a date, which he accepts. Liz dresses in the trashiest outfit she can find, and goes on her date. The next day, she discovers that cutbacks are still taking place at TGS, and confronts Brad. Realizing that he was being used, Brad charges Liz with sexual harassment and she is suspended from work for two weeks. Jack tells Liz that the budget review process will start over again, this time under his supervision.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{mention of}} rapid transit along the Bloor–Danforth line's route {{was made in}} a 1910 report that was prepared by an American firm of transit consultants. This study had been commissioned by a special commission, which included City Controller Horatio Clarence Hocken and Mayor of Toronto Joseph Oliver. In their final report, <b>the</b> <b>consultants</b> suggested that the Prince Edward Viaduct, which spans the Don River Valley, should include a lower deck for a future subway. The lower deck was built, but the first plan for a line to use it was not made until June 15, 1933, when the TTC published a report which suggested construction of a subway and an expressway broadly following Bloor Street and Danforth Avenue. The estimated cost {{of the project was}} $120 million, but the plan was not implemented. Plans for a somewhat longer route, running east to west from Victoria Park Avenue to the Humber River, were proposed by the Toronto Planning Board in December 1943, although the report did not include costings. During the fall of 1911, the City of Toronto put out a tender for the construction of concrete tubes to carry a subway. However, when the cost of the subway was put to a referendum, the construction of the subway tunnels was rejected.|$|E

30|$|What effect did <b>the</b> <b>consultant’s</b> report have? Did the {{regional}} cooperation body manage {{to change the}} procurement content? One thing is for sure, <b>the</b> <b>consultant’s</b> report created confusion among several actors in the municipalities and among the politicians on the PTA board [45]. For example, one municipality {{did not know how}} to value <b>the</b> <b>consultant’s</b> report in relation to the opinions it was to give on the procurement documents [46]. A civil servant in one municipality stated that neither he nor “his” politicians had received any information about <b>the</b> <b>consultant’s</b> report until it was already complete.

40|$|Abstract: There {{are many}} and varied {{views on the}} role of <b>the</b> {{management}} <b>consultant.</b> Roles range from the  functional perspective  to  variations of  the  critical perspective. Despite these many perspectives, there is low consensus and a poor under-standing of what <b>the</b> <b>consultant</b> actually does. Adding to the mix is that there is even poorer  understanding  of how  the  implementation of a new  concept af-fects <b>the</b> <b>consultant’s</b> role. Consequently, <b>the</b> authors will look at what role a management consultant take when working with new knowledge, and how this role  is viewed from the perspective of <b>the</b> <b>consultant,</b> managers and employee in the client organization: a Swedish MNC.  The research issue was examined through the authors’ own model, which was tested through in-depth interviews with management consultant, managers and employee within the case company.   Interview material was complemented through participant observations. Data was then analyzed  as authors tried to understand the informants through an emic research perspective. The study shows that the role of <b>the</b> management <b>consultant</b> varies depending on who is asked. The perspective ranges from the functional perspective on management consulting to the critical perspective, even if no informant can be said to argue that <b>the</b> management <b>consultant</b> belong to only one of the two perspectives. What is more, the study indicates that the closeness (relationship) of the client and <b>the</b> management <b>consultant</b> as well as the knowledge used by <b>the</b> <b>consultant</b> determines <b>the</b> <b>consultant’s</b> role. <b>The</b> authors suggest that further research should focus on how knowledge de-termines the role of <b>the</b> <b>consultant,</b> <b>the</b> effect of closeness between client and consultant and finally how implementation of new knowledge affects the view of <b>the</b> management <b>consultant’s</b> role.

25|$|At a January 1942 meeting, {{a report}} by two of <b>the</b> <b>consultants</b> was analyzed. The report made {{suggestions}} as to personnel, exercise, provisions, including food, alcohol and tobacco, ventilation, and sanitation. If {{one of the team}} members died, it was recommended that their remains be embalmed and cemented. Those at the meeting decided that the Operation Tracer team should have six members: an officer who would serve as leader of the team, two doctors, and three telegraphists. It was proposed that a rehearsal be conducted to evaluate the psychological suitability of the proposed team members. It was suggested that the rehearsal take place in Scotland. At a meeting held the following month, in February 1942, it was recommended that Lieutenant White of the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve be interviewed. It was proposed that once the Tracer team was chosen, a second team be organised, and observations posts at other places such as Aden and Malta be considered.|$|E
25|$|One of <b>the</b> <b>consultants</b> for Operation Tracer was Royal Navy Surgeon Commander George Murray Levick (1876–1956). The {{explorer}} {{had been}} part of the support crew for Captain Robert Scott (1868–1912) in Antarctica. Levick and five other men of the crew survived their eight-month trip to Cape Evans, which included an entire winter spent in a snow cave, eating seal blubber and penguin meat. Levick had been called out of retirement to serve as the British Admiralty's consultant on survival in harsh conditions. While it was initially planned for another consultant to search for doctors, it was Levick who recruited the two physicians for Operation Tracer. He made recommendations on psychological vetting of personnel, as well as diet, clothing, exercise, and leisure activity. Levick also advised on ventilation and sanitation of the cave, including how to handle dead bodies. He drew up reports with recommendations for the operation and attended meetings held by the Director of Naval Intelligence at Curzon Street. He also compiled a comprehensive list of provisions to be assembled within the cave in the Upper Rock. Director Godfrey and his consultants agreed with Levick's recommendation for a rehearsal, although Romney Marsh, England was chosen, rather than Scotland. In addition, Levick lived with the Tracer team during the rehearsal period.|$|E
30|$|What other effects did <b>the</b> <b>consultant’s</b> report have? A {{civil servant}} at the {{regional}} cooperation body argued that <b>the</b> <b>consultant’s</b> report was crucial to {{the outcome of the}} procurement document. He stated that “The PTA bought everything in the report” [47]. In addition, the PTA president thought <b>the</b> <b>consultant’s</b> report was relevant, not in a way that changed the procurement document, but rather as it ensured that the process was on the right track. A local politician thought that <b>the</b> <b>consultant’s</b> report was an addition to the procurement report. He believed that <b>the</b> <b>consultant’s</b> report was more research based, which was also important to consider when conducting a procurement. Regarding the timing of the completion of <b>the</b> <b>consultant’s</b> report, <b>the</b> informant believed it was right: “We had time to reflect on the report when it wasn’t too old – we can’t use old data in these kinds of processes” [42]. One consequence of <b>the</b> <b>consultant’s</b> report, besides allowing the regional cooperation body to influence the procurement process, was that other actors (including the PTA) also used the report as a resource to gather political support for their decisions. Not only did the actor mobilizing power resources in the initial stage benefit from this resource mobilization, but other actors could also use the resources to their own benefit.|$|R
