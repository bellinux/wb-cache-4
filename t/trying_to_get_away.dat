5|$|The trio {{explored}} {{the world around}} them, experiencing a second childhood with no wives, jobs, or responsibilities. They passed the time by speculating about their fellow townspeople and testing inventions. Regular subplots {{in the first decade}} of the show included: Sid and Ivy bickering over the management of the café, Mr Wainwright and Mrs Partridge having a secret love affair that everyone knows about, Wally <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> from Nora's watchful eye, Foggy's exaggerated war stories, and Compo's schemes to win the affections of Nora Batty.|$|E
25|$|Later in {{his career}} Fred Curry struck {{out on his own}} more and more <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> from his father’s legacy of rule-breaking and {{violence}} to establish a legacy of his own. Fred’s attempts to get out of his father’s shadow never caused any problems between the two Currys.|$|E
25|$|The Crossing of the Rhine in 405/6 brought unmanageable {{numbers of}} German and Alan barbarians (perhaps some 30,000 warriors, 100,000 people) into Gaul. They {{may have been}} <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> from the Huns, who about this time {{advanced}} to occupy the Great Hungarian Plain. For {{the next few years}} the barbarian tribes who had crossed the Rhine wandered in search of food and employment, while Roman forces fought each other in the name of Honorius and a number of competing claimants to the imperial throne.|$|E

25|$|Even at {{this early}} stage, the European states fought back: Livorno's {{monument}} Quattro Mori celebrates 16th-century victories against the Barbary corsairs won by the Knights of Malta and the Order of Saint Stephen, of which the Grand Duke of Tuscany Ferdinando I de' Medici was Grand Master. Another response was {{the construction of the}} original frigates; light, fast and maneuverable galleys, designed to run down Barbary corsairs <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> with their loot and slaves. Other measures included coastal lookouts to give warning for people to withdraw into fortified places and rally local forces to fight the corsairs. This latter goal was especially difficult to achieve as the corsairs had the advantage of surprise; the vulnerable European Mediterranean coasts were very long and easily accessible from the north African Barbary bases, and the corsairs were careful in planning their raids.|$|E
25|$|The pursuers skillfully took up {{position}} to limit South Carolinas options in <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away,</b> the British windward ship attempted {{to mask the}} South Carolinas wind. For eighteen hours the British chased South Carolina. When she came in range, she fired her stern chasers at Diomede, which returned fire from her bow-guns. By 1500hrs the British ships were close enough to exchange shots and could each yaw, fire a broadside {{and return to the}} chase while preventing South Carolina from doing the same. The first of the British broadsides did major damage to South Carolina, leading Joyner to call his officers together to discuss whether to fight or to continue the flight. The decision was to continue the latter. By 1700hrs Quebec and Diomede came up alongside South Carolina, with Astrea behind in support, together with Hope and Constance. The British were soon in position to fire six broadsides, five from the Diomede and the other from the Quebec, all aimed at South Carolinas masts, sails and rigging, which within two hours were in tatters.|$|E
500|$|Two fault lines, {{gender and}} class, were exposed {{in the debate}} over Nannygate: in the former, a double {{standard}} was seen wherein female appointees faced a greater risk of being questioned and disqualified based upon their childcare arrangements, while in the latter, wealthy or upper middle-class professional women who could afford live-in childcare arrangements were seen as <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> a white-collar criminal act.|$|E

500|$|Altgens {{described}} {{what he saw}} following the fatal shot to JFK. [...] "There was no blood {{on the right-hand side}} of his face; there was no blood on the front of his face. But there was a tremendous amount of blood on the left-hand side and {{at the back of the}} head." [...] This suggested to Altgens that the gunshots came from the rear, because he should have seen some evidence otherwise. He also remembered seeing Jackie Kennedy on the trunk of the limousine, and thinking that she was frightened by the events and was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away.</b>|$|E
500|$|... "Losing My Religion" [...] {{is based}} on Peter Buck's mandolin-playing. Buck said, [...] "The verses {{are the kinds of}} things R.E.M. uses a lot, going from one minor to another, kind [...] like those 'Driver 8' chords. You can't really say {{anything}} bad about E minor, A minor, D, and G– I mean, they're just good chords." [...] Buck noted that [...] "Losing My Religion" [...] was [...] "probably the most typical R.E.M.-sounding song on the record. We are <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> from those kind of songs, but like I said before, those are some good chords." [...] Orchestral strings play through parts of the song. The song is in natural minor.|$|E
500|$|The Nannygate matter caused wealthy Americans to {{ask each}} other if they too had a [...] "Zoë Baird problem", as {{the hiring of}} illegal aliens and the paying of {{household}} help off the books were both commonplace. [...] Two fault lines, gender and class, were exposed in the discussion over Nannygate: in the former, a double standard was seen wherein female appointees faced {{a greater risk of}} being questioned and disqualified based upon their childcare arrangements, while in the latter, affluent professional women who could afford live-in childcare arrangements were seen as <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> with an illegal act.

500|$|For {{her fourth}} album, The House (2010), Melua worked with {{producer}} William Orbit. She {{said about the}} experience: [...] "The whole thing has been really exciting. It was the same feeling I had the first time I went skydiving. I was really quite nervous, but I knew all I {{had to do was}} let myself go and it was going to feel amazing. I wasn't <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> from anything. It was more about going towards something. I wanted the music to be inspired by the future, something unknown that's never been heard before, {{but at the same time}} hold on to the values of the music of the past, to try and tap into something that's so ancient and old that it's kind of forgotten. I thought that, if we went far enough in both directions, we could end up in the same place".|$|E
500|$|At the US National Championships he equaled his 100m best of 9.84s {{while running}} into the wind. This was a meeting record and the second fastest 100m time with a {{headwind}} after Maurice Greene's 9.82s run. He followed this with a new 200m personal best in the finals, again facing an impeding wind. His time of 19.62s was the second fastest ever; only Johnson's 19.32s run at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics was faster. Gay was happy with the achievement but noted that the competition was still strong: [...] "I wasn't thinking about any time. I was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> from Spearmon as fast as I could." [...] After noting that he was feeling worn out, Gay had a brief recuperation period {{in preparation for the}} 2007 World Championships in Osaka, Japan. He returned to the track in Europe and, while weather conditions were poor, he won the 200m in Lausanne with 19.78s and had wins at 100m events in Sheffield and London. He relished the opportunity to face Powell at the World Championships: both sprinters were undefeated that year and Gay said that he felt ready for the challenge.|$|E
500|$|Childhood friends, Donnel Carty, 18, and Delano Brown, 17, {{had earlier}} that evening robbed chef Kurshid Ali, {{a middle-aged man}} in Kensal Green station, 20 minutes before Pryce arrived at the station {{on his way home}} from work. Pryce was walking from Kensal Green Tube station at about 2300 to 2330 GMT, when he was attacked. According to witness reports, Pryce was running along Bathurst Gardens from two black youths. According to {{testimony}} from Delano Brown, Donnel Carty stabbed Pryce after they had chased him from Kensal Green Tube station where police found a trail of blood and belongings, including a pair of gloves and papers regarding Pryce's wedding arrangements. As the youths chased Pryce, Carty [...] "fly-kicked" [...] him in the back and he dropped to the floor. As Pryce attempted to stand up, Carty kicked him in the face. <b>Trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away,</b> Pryce began to fight Carty, as Carty stopped him. Some time during this Pryce was stabbed twice in the chest and once in the hip, the wounds penetrating vital organs including his heart. He also suffered cuts to his head, hands and torso. As Pryce's belongings lay scattered around him, Carty and Brown took Pryce's mobile phone and Oyster card, the only possessions of value Pryce was carrying. Carty then shouted 'What else have you got?' to which Pryce responded 'Nothing. You have got everything'. Carty and Brown then ran off towards Clifford Gardens, heading to Carty's home leaving Pryce dying on the ground. Pryce was later taken to Central Middlesex Hospital, where he was confirmed dead shortly after midnight.|$|E

[...] While <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> from the stampede, he said that people pulled down {{electrical}} wires, causing more people to die of electrocution. [...] These claims were backed up by one of the doctors treating patients, who said that electrocution and suffocation were the primary causes of death among the casualties, though the government disputed the claims of electric shock.|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{learning}} {{that she is}} a blood witch, Morgan concludes that her parents are blood witches and confronts them. However, after her parents deny being witches, this leads Morgan to find out that she was adopted. She runs out of the house in a fierce rage finding comfort with Cal.

2500|$|Anna Walton as Princess Nuala: King Balor's {{daughter}} and Nuada's twin sister. She {{is described as}} [...] "very light" [...] while Nuada is [...] "very dark", creating a yin and yang dynamic. She elaborated on the incestuous tones between her character and Prince Nuada, [...] "He's the dark side and she's the light side and they're pulled apart and pulled back together again, and she's <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> because she knows there is something she has to do. He can't let that go and they can't really do anything without each other so it's a really interesting thing." [...] Her character also forms a relationship with Abe Sapien, and Walton noted their similarities, [...] "They are both slightly lost souls and they understand each other." [...] Walton spoke of her character's sense of purpose, [...] "She feels very strongly about {{what she has to}} do in the film, and then her absolute connection and love for the Earth and what we are given. That's what she's here to protect... Her relationship with her brother, and how he is almost a part of her but she has to break away and will {{do whatever it takes to}} stop him from achieving what he wants to achieve, which is the mass destruction of mankind." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{more recent}} case {{came to light}} in 2007 with [...] Bass' {{agreement}} to exhume {{the body of the}} late J.P. Richardson, Jr, more famously known as [...] "The Big Bopper". He was one of the three musicians that {{died in a plane crash}} in February 1959. His son, Jay Richardson, had never met his father and, knowing the strange controversies surrounding the plane crash, decided to contact Bass to see if he could gather any answers. Questions lingered as to whether or not Buddy Holly's gun found at the scene of the crash had been fired earlier or if Richardson had managed to survive the initial crash and simply died <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away.</b> After exhumation of the body, Bass examined it using a portable X-ray system. After X-ray examination, Bass was able to come to a fairly certain conclusion: Richardson died immediately upon impact. He showed Jay Richardson the numerous breaks and fractures throughout his father's body, including his chest, skull, pelvis, and legs which inhibited ambulatory motion. All of the rumors and debates surrounding Richardson's death could finally be put to rest, and it was due largely in part to [...] Bass and his extensive knowledge of forensic anthropology.|$|E
2500|$|Apparently, part of {{the problem}} is {{chromium}} parts becoming unstable during time travel, according to Alternate Doc. This DeLorean is then stolen by Edna Strickland, one of the game's main villains. The more adept Doc Brown returns in another duplicate DeLorean due to earlier events in the game, although it is unknown where it came from. Then Officer Danny Parker nearly arrests Marty and Doc for allegedly having the car that Edna got away in. After they explain to him that there is more than one DeLorean, Marty explains that the other DeLorean had malfunctioning time circuits. To make matters worse, the entire town of Hill Valley disappears around them. They go to [...] "Mary Pickford's" [...] house and see that the other DeLorean had been destroyed. After they get information from Mary, who was really Edna, they go to 1876. After they stop the fire that would've burned down Hill Valley, they chase down Edna, who is <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> in the first DeLorean. Marty synchronizes the two DeLoreans and hoverboards back to Doc's DeLorean, which is flying behind the one Edna's driving. They all travel back to 1931, with Edna's DeLorean duplicate vanishing because of the time ripples catching up with them, causing [...] "chronal decay" [...] (i.e., since the Alternate Doc timeline ceased to exist, the alternated Clone DeLorean was folded back with the real Clone DeLorean).|$|E
