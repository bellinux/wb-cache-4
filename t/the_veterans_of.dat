5|$|The communists' {{principal}} rivals were <b>the</b> <b>veterans</b> <b>of</b> the Armia Krajowa movement, Mikołajczyk's Polish People's (Peasant) Party (Polskie Stronnictwo Ludowe; PSL), and <b>the</b> <b>veterans</b> <b>of</b> the Polish armies {{which had}} fought in the West. Of particular practical importance was Mikołajczyk's People's Party, because it was legally recognized by the communists and thus able to function within the political arena. The People's Party wanted to prevent the communists from monopolizing power and eventually establish a parliamentary polity with a market economy by winning the promised elections. Mikołajczyk hoped that an independent Polish state, friendly with the Soviet Union, {{would be allowed to}} act as a bridge between the east and the west.|$|E

5|$|The Polish Legions serving {{alongside}} the French Army during the Napoleonic Wars saw combat {{in most of}} Napoleon's campaigns, from the West Indies, through Italy and Egypt.

This force fought a victorious war against Austria in 1809 and {{would go on to}} fight {{alongside the}} French army in numerous campaigns, culminating in the disastrous invasion of Russia in 1812, which marked the end of the Napoleonic empire, including the Legions, and allied states like the Duchy of Warsaw.|$|E
5|$|The current M-11 follows Remembrance Road, Wilson Avenue and 28th Street. The {{first two}} of these names were chosen to memorialize the roadway in honor of local people.

They planted 231elms in a double row {{on each side of the}} highway and erected a boulder bearing a bronze plaque dedicated to <b>the</b> <b>veterans</b> <b>of</b> Kent County.

5|$|When the Michigan State Legislature {{consolidated}} {{the statutes}} defining the various memorial highways in 2001, they included <b>the</b> <b>Veterans</b> <b>of</b> World War I Memorial Highway in the law. Defined along I-75/US23 between Saginaw and Bay City, the designation {{was included in}} Public Act 142. That act also affected another previously designated moniker between the two cities.

This name was applied to the original highway routing between Saginaw and Bay City (now a part of M-13). After the 2001 change, the name was moved to the US23 freeway.|$|E
5|$|A $2.5 {{million bond}} issue passed in 1922 for a stadium {{conceived}} by Burnham. Designed by architects Holabird & Roche and named Soldier Field for <b>the</b> <b>veterans</b> <b>of</b> World War I, cost overruns required another bond issue in 1926. By 1924, the breakwater wall stretched from 14th to 55th Streets. In 1926, Soldier Field and {{a portion of}} Lake Shore Drive were opened. Landfilling extended from 23rd Street to 56th Street; however, Promontory Point was not complete, prompting complaints regarding garbage, blowing sand and odors. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, landfill efforts continued to fill in Burnham Park and the adjacent Northerly Island. The South Development was named for Daniel Burnham on January 14, 1927, and support increased for a world's fair in the park. Construction was completed on Lake Shore Drive, with northbound lanes named for Leif Erikson, and southbound lanes for Christopher Columbus. In 1929, construction of the park at Promontory Point began. The Great Depression delayed work and prevented construction of nearshore islands. Burnham Park was chosen for {{the site of the}} Century of Progress world's fair and a yacht basin was built south of 51st Street.|$|E
