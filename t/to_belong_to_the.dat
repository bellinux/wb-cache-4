5|$|Sponges were {{traditionally}} {{distributed in}} three classes: calcareous sponges (Calcarea), glass sponges (Hexactinellida) and demosponges (Demospongiae). However, {{studies have shown}} that the Homoscleromorpha, a group thought <b>to</b> <b>belong</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Demospongiae, is actually phylogenetically well separated. Therefore, they have recently been recognized as the fourth class of sponges.|$|E

5|$|Both Opisthocoelicaudia and Nemegtosaurus where {{discovered}} {{during the}} 1965 joint Polish-Mongolian expedition. Before the remains were prepared and described, the expedition crew believed both finds <b>to</b> <b>belong</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> same species of sauropod. In 1977, Borsuk-Białynicka deemed Opisthocoelicaudia and Nemegtosaurus to represent separate genera because Nemegtosaurus {{was at this}} time {{considered to be a}} member of the Dicraeosauridae, while Opisthocoelicaudia seemed to be a representative of a different group, the Camarasauridae.|$|E

5|$|Most of what {{is known}} of Du Fu's life comes from his poems. His {{paternal}} grandfather was Du Shenyan, a noted politician and poet during the reign of Empress Wu.

He was equally well-loved and controversial, appreciated for his role as 'the people's judge' and his support for the common man and disliked by elements of the bar and judiciary for 'uncertainty in the law' created by his broad judgments.|$|E
5|$|American {{astronomer}} Edwin Hubble categorized M87 {{as one of}} {{the brighter}} globular nebulae, as it lacked any spiral structure, but appeared <b>to</b> <b>belong</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> same family of non-galactic nebulae as spiral nebulae. In 1926 he produced a new categorization of nebulae, with M87 being classified as a type of elliptical extra-galactic nebula with no apparent elongation (class E0). By 1931, Hubble had identified M87 {{as a member of the}} Virgo Cluster, for which he gave a provisional estimate of 1.8 million parsecs from Earth. At the time it was the only known example of an elliptical nebula for which individual stars could be resolved. M87 continued to be called an extragalactic nebula for many years thereafter, but by 1956 it had been identified as an E0-type galaxy.|$|E
5|$|Antisemitic {{legislation}} passed in 1933 {{led to the}} removal all of Jewish teachers, professors and officials from the education system. Most teachers were required <b>to</b> <b>belong</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Nationalsozialistischer Lehrerbund (National Socialist Teachers League; NSLB) and university professors were required to join the National Socialist German Lecturers. Teachers had {{to take an oath}} of loyalty and obedience to Hitler and those who failed to show sufficient conformity to party ideals were often reported by students or fellow teachers and dismissed. Lack of funding for salaries led to many teachers leaving the profession and the average class size increased from 37 in 1927 to 43 in 1938 due to the resulting teacher shortage.|$|E

5|$|French {{astronomer}} Nicolas Louis de Lacaille charted and designated ten {{stars with}} the Bayer designations Alpha through to Iota in 1756. A star in neighbouring Indus that Lacaille had labelled Nu Indi {{turned out to}} be in Microscopium, so Gould renamed it Nu Microscopii. Francis Baily considered Gamma and Epsilon Microscopii <b>to</b> <b>belong</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> neighbouring constellation Piscis Austrinus, but subsequent cartographers did not follow this. In his 1725 Catalogus Britannicus, John Flamsteed labelled the stars 1, 2, 3 and 4 Piscis Austrini, which became Gamma Microscopii, HR 8076, HR 8110 and Epsilon Microscopii respectively. Within the constellation's borders, there are 43 stars brighter than or equal to apparent magnitude6.5.|$|E

5|$|In 1786, subfossil Rodrigues {{solitaire}} bones encrusted in stalagmite {{were discovered}} in a cave and sent to Georges Cuvier in about 1830. For unknown reasons, he stated they had recently been found on Mauritius, which caused confusion, until they were compared with other bones from Rodrigues that were found <b>to</b> <b>belong</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> same species. These finds confirmed Leguat's descriptions, but at this time no living residents of Rodrigues remembered having seen live specimens. In 1831, {{a man who had}} lived on Rodrigues for 40 years said that he had never seen birds large enough to be Rodrigues solitaires. Rodrigues covers only , making it implausible that the bird would have survived undetected.|$|E

5|$|Philosophically, the Smarta {{tradition}} {{emphasizes that}} all idols (murti) are icons to help focus on and visualize aspects of Brahman, rather than distinct beings. The ultimate goal in {{this practice is}} to transition past the use of icons, recognize the Absolute symbolized by the icons, {{on the path to}} realizing the nondual identity of one's Atman (soul, self) and the Brahman. Popularized by Adi Shankara, many Panchayatana mandalas and temples have been uncovered that are from the Gupta Empire period, and one Panchayatana set from the village of Nand (about 24 kilometers from Ajmer) has been dated <b>to</b> <b>belong</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Kushan Empire era (pre-300 CE). The Kushan period set includes Shiva, Vishnu, Surya, Brahma and one deity whose identity is unclear.|$|E
5|$|Pottery finds showed better finish {{compared}} to the earlier Period I. The pots were of polished black ware, mostly handmade, {{in the form of}} a dish with stand, a high-necked jar, and so forth. Also found was a wheel turned red ware pot which contained 950 beads made from carnelian and agate (inferred as items for sale), which was thought <b>to</b> <b>belong</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> later part of this period. A very impressive painted pottery ware recovered from this period was a globular red ware pot made on a turntable; the painting on the pot was of a wild goat of black colour with long horns and hanging ears. Another pottery item which is of interest is a polished black ware in globular shape jar with a long neck and flaring mouth.|$|E
5|$|Reid {{considered}} the genus allied to Leucogyrophana, then thought <b>to</b> <b>belong</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> family Coniophoraceae. Marinus Anton Donk, in a monograph published the next year, agreed {{and placed it}} close to Serpula and Coniophora; these genera are now known to represent early-diverging lineages in the Boletales order. However, the white spore print and small, smooth, and hyaline spores are not characteristic of species in the Coniophoraceae. In a large-scale phylogenetic analysis published in 2006, Podoserpula nested far from them in the Plicaturopsis clade, an evolutionarily related group of early-diverging members of the Agaricales order. Other taxa in this clade include Plicaturopsis and Sclerotium rolfsii. The entire clade was later separated into three smaller orders, Podoserpula becoming {{a member of the}} Amylocorticiales along with mostly corticioid genera such as Amylocorticium and Serpulomyces.|$|E

Emperor Pedro II {{was the last of}} the direct male line in Brazil descended from Dom Afonso I, first king of Portugal and founder, in 1139, of the dynasty which headed the Brazilian Empire. There were two other male Braganzas, albeit living abroad: Pedro II's half-brother Rodrigo Delfim Pereira and his cousin Miguel, Duke of Braganza. Both were barred from the line of succession, however. The former because he was an illegitimate son, and the latter because he was a foreigner and not a descendant of the first Brazilian Emperor, Pedro I.|$|E
5|$|The Rodrigues {{starling}} (Necropsar rodericanus) is an {{extinct species}} of starling that was endemic to the Mascarene island of Rodrigues. Its closest relatives were the Mauritius starling and the hoopoe starling from nearby islands; all three {{appear to be}} of Southeast Asian origin. The bird was only reported by French sailor Julien Tafforet, who was marooned on the island from 1725 to 1726. Tafforet observed it on the offshore islet of Île Gombrani. Subfossil remains found on the mainland were described in 1879, and were suggested <b>to</b> <b>belong</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bird mentioned by Tafforet. There was much confusion about the bird and its taxonomic relations throughout the 20th century.|$|E
