5|$|The Arch {{demolition}} {{was formally}} {{announced by the}} Minister of Transport, Ernest Marples in July 1961, but immediately drew widespread protest. Experts {{did not believe the}} £190,000 estimate and suspected foreign firms could move the Arch on rollers for substantially less. The Earl of Euston, the Earl of Rosse and John Betjeman all protested against the redevelopment. On 16 October, 75 architects and students staged a formal demonstration against the demolition inside the Great Hall, and a week later Sir Charles Wheeler led a deputation to speak with the Prime Minister Harold Macmillan against the demolition. Macmillan replied that as well as the cost, there was no place large enough to put the Arch <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>look</b> in keeping with its surroundings. Demolition began on 6 November and was completed within four months.|$|E

25|$|Senator Hatfield {{made several}} recommendations. He asked that a {{transcript}} of the Winter Soldier Investigation be read into the Congressional record and {{made available to the}} public. Hatfield also asked congress to hold hearings discussing {{the use of military force}} in Vietnam and their relation to international agreements ratified by the United States legislature. He sent the testimony to the Department of Defense, the Department of State asked Marine Commandant, Leonard F. Chapman, Jr., to investigate the allegations.

25|$|Weta created {{numerous}} {{pieces of}} prosthetics, {{and would have}} to monitor them on set too. They created 1800 Orc body suits to go with 10,000 Orc heads, lasting six days and one day respectively. Weta also spent a year creating Hobbit feet <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>look</b> like furry feet yet act as shoes for actors. In total, 1800 pairs were used by the four lead actors during production. Actors would also go in for face casts to create pointed ears and false noses. Most extensive was John Rhys-Davies as Gimli, who would spend four-and-a-half hours in the morning to apply Dwarven prosthetics. Gino Acevedo also worked on created realistic skin tones for the actors, such as Bernard Hill's possessed Théoden and a younger Bilbo. Peter(s) King and Owen also led the make-up department in making numerous wigs and creating general dirt on the actors. As well as applying make-up, {{at the end of the}} day there was an hour of carefully removing the make-up and prosthetics. As well as the prosthetics, there were also numerous corpses of actors and horses.|$|E

25|$|The {{government}} {{announced that a}} committee be convened under Lord Desborough <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>look</b> at all aspects of police forces in England, Wales, and Scotland. One {{of the things the}} committee highlighted was the inconsistency in police pay. At the time, there was no uniform pay structure for the police. Local Watch Committees were the sole arbiters of police pay. The pay of agricultural workers and unskilled labourers had outstripped that of the police. The Desborough Committee recorded that the pay for the average constable serving in a provincial force with five years service who was married with two children would earn 2 pounds 15 shillings , including all their allowances such as rent and a child allowance. The Desborough Committee cited examples that a street sweeper in Newcastle-on-Tyne was on the same rate of pay as a constable in the provincial force. Ten other examples cited by the committee also showed police were paid less than menial labour occupations, six of which paid higher than the Metropolitan Police. Lord Desborough was therefore quite sympathetic to the plight of the ordinary policeman regarding pay, and consequently recommended comparatively generous increases.|$|E
25|$|The {{script that}} Cruise {{approved}} {{called for a}} final showdown to take place {{on top of a}} moving train. The actor wanted to use the famously fast French train the TGV but rail authorities did not want any part of the stunt performed on their trains. When that was no longer a problem, the track was not available. De Palma visited railroads on two continents trying to get permission. Cruise took the train owners out to dinner and the next day they were allowed to use it. For the actual sequence, the actor wanted wind that was so powerful that it could knock him off the train. Cruise had difficulty finding the right machine that would create the wind velocity <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>look</b> visually accurate before remembering a simulator he used while training as a skydiver. The only machine of its kind in Europe was located and acquired. Cruise had it produce winds up to 140 miles per hour so it would distort his face. Exterior shots of the train were filmed on the Glasgow South Western Line, between New Cumnock, Dumfries and Annan. Most of the sequence, however, was filmed on a stage against a blue screen for later digitizing by the visual effects team at Industrial Light & Magic.|$|E

[...] His review concludes, [...] "t's {{a fine example of}} a show past its glory days, nevertheless finding a way to make itself relevant again." [...] VanDerWerff later awarded the episode an [...] "A–" [...] and praised—in addition to its refreshing take on the alien mythology—the episode's location, noting that the oil rig's [...] "isolation and man-made island status, was definitely the sort of place <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>look</b> and feel different from just about every other episode of the show." [...] He also applauded the dynamic between Mulder and Doggett, and wrote that the episode successfully was a way for [...] "David Duchovny and Fox Mulder to pass the torch to Robert Patrick and John Doggett." ...|$|E

500|$|Townshend became {{inspired}} by [...] "Long Live Rock – Rock Is Dead"'s theme and in autumn 1972 began writing material, while the group put out unreleased recordings including [...] "Join Together" [...] and [...] "Relay" [...] to keep {{themselves in the}} public eye. In the meantime, bassist John Entwistle released his second solo album, Whistle Rymes, singer Roger Daltrey worked on solo material, and Keith Moon featured as a drummer in the film That'll Be The Day. Townshend had met up with [...] "Irish" [...] Jack Lyons, {{one of the original}} Who fans, which gave him the idea of writing a piece <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>look</b> back on the group's history and its audience. He created the character of Jimmy from an amalgamation of six early fans of the group, including Lyons, and gave the character a four-way split personality, which led to the album's title (a play on schizophrenia).|$|E
500|$|Although Sakaguchi's {{previous}} RPGs from Mistwalker {{had been}} released for the Xbox 360, The Last Story was created for the Wii. According to Sakaguchi, this was because Nintendo's Shinji Hatano shared their vision of a role-playing game that did not follow genre conversions, and so Sakaguchi accepted his offer of collaboration. After being contacted regarding both The Last Story and fellow Wii ARPG Xenoblade Chronicles, Hatano said that the games should be made for a wide audience and using a [...] "romanticist approach". When explaining why The Last Story was exclusive to the Wii, Sakaguchi {{said that it was}} because {{a large proportion of the}} late development staff, including the testers, came from Nintendo. In a later interview, he said that working with the Wii, which did not use high-definition graphics, presented challenges as some of his ideas could not be implemented due to technical restrictions. Despite this, the team aimed to create a game <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>look</b> good when compared to games on high-definition consoles. Matsumoto stated that Nintendo had a strong influence on the game, which did not always sit well with him despite their suggestions ultimately improving the game. He also stated that Nintendo's creative and development aid in fine-tuning the game was the reason for its extended development.|$|E
500|$|In {{previous}} films, Starfleet's {{range of}} capital ships had been predominantly {{represented by the}} Constitution class Enterprise and just five other ship classes: the Miranda class from [...] (represented by the USS Reliant), the Excelsior and the Oberth class Grissom from , and the Galaxy and Nebula classes from The Next Generation. ILM supervisor John Knoll insisted that First Contacts space battle prove the breadth of Starfleet's ship configurations. [...] "Starfleet would probably throw everything it could at the Borg, including ships we've never seen before", he reasoned. [...] "And since we figured {{a lot of the}} background action in the space battle would need to be done with computer-generated ships that needed to be built from scratch anyway, I realized there was no reason not to do some new designs." [...] Alex Jaeger was appointed visual effects art director to the film and assigned the task of creating four new starships. Paramount wanted ships <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>look</b> different from a distance, so the director devised multiple hull profiles. Knoll and Jaeger had decided that the ships had to obey certain Star Trek ship precedents, with a saucer-like primary hull and elongated warp nacelles in pairs. The Akira class featured the traditional saucer section and nacelles combined with a catamaran-style double hull; the Norway class was based on the USS Voyager; the Saber class was a smaller ship with nacelles trailing off the tips of its saucer section; and the Steamrunner class featured twin nacelles trailing off the saucer and connected by an engineering section in the rear. Each design was modeled as a three-dimensional digital wire-frame model for use in the film.|$|E

Lundgren announced in September 2005 <b>that</b> Macy's <b>would</b> <b>look</b> into moving production back to Chicago. [...] In making the announcement, Lundgren noted <b>that</b> Macy's <b>would</b> <b>look</b> into [...] "our contractual obligations" [...] {{to determine if}} the chocolate production could be moved back to the Windy City; however, Lundgren stressed that he was not making any promises regarding moving {{all or part of the}} production back to Chicago.|$|R

2500|$|The lack {{of liquid}} water on Titan's surface was cited by NASA astrobiologist Andrew Pohorille in 2009 as an {{argument}} against life there. Pohorille considers that water {{is important not}} only as the solvent used by [...] "the only life we know" [...] but also because its chemical properties are [...] "uniquely suited to promote self-organization of organic matter". He has questioned whether prospects for finding life on Titan's surface are sufficient to justify {{the expense of a}} mission <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>look</b> for it.|$|E
