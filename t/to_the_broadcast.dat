He suggested that other record labels underestimated the potential of Glee musical releases as they are all cover versions.|$|E
5|$|In 1926, WWV {{was nearly}} shut down. Its signal could only cover {{the eastern half}} of the United States, and other {{stations}} located in Minneapolis and at Stanford University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology were slowly making WWV redundant. The station's impending shutdown was announced in 1926, but it was saved by a flood of protests from citizens who relied on the service. Later, in 1931, WWV underwent an upgrade. Its transmitter, now directly controlled by a quartz oscillator, was moved to College Park, Maryland. Broadcasts began on 5MHz. A year later, the station was moved again, to Department of Agriculture land in Beltsville, Maryland. Broadcasts were added on 10 and 15MHz, power was increased, and time signals, an A440 tone, and ionosphere reports were all added <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>broadcast</b> in June 1937.|$|E
