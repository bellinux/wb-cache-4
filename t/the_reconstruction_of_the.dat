5|$|To {{rebuild the}} damaged {{parts of the}} site, the {{relevant}} approval from Dacorum Borough Council would be needed. The BP section of the site {{is a good way}} from the explosion and survived with very little damage, but it was inoperative as of 2009. BP is exploring plans for the future use of this part of the site, and has indicated a number of priorities, including the reopening of the fuel pipelines to Heathrow. It is considering using its section to store aviation fuel and as a distribution centre for motor fuel, but at a much-reduced level. In late 2009, Total UK submitted plans for <b>the</b> <b>reconstruction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> oil depot. <b>The</b> <b>reconstruction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> site has been taking place since March 2013.|$|E

40|$|We {{perform a}} {{comprehensive}} study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dark energy {{equation of state}} (EoS) utilizing the model-independent Gaussian processes (GP). Using a combination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Union 2. 1 data set, the 30 newly added H(z) cosmic chronometer data points and Planck's shift parameter, we modify the usual GaPP code and provide a tighter constraint on the dark energy EoS than the previous literature about GP reconstructions. Subsequently, we take the "controlling variable method" to investigate directly <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> variable matter density parameter Ω_m 0, variable cosmic curvature Ω_k 0 and variable Hubble constant H_ 0 on the dark energy EoS, respectively. We find that too small or large Ω_m 0, Ω_k 0 and H_ 0 are all disfavored by our GP reconstructions based on current cosmological observations. Subsequently, we find that variable Ω_m 0 and Ω_k 0 affect <b>the</b> <b>reconstructions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dark energy EoS, but affect hardly <b>the</b> <b>reconstructions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> normalized comoving distance D(z) and its derivatives D'(z) and D"(z). However, variable H_ 0 affects <b>the</b> <b>reconstructions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dark energy EoS by affecting obviously those of D(z), D'(z) and D"(z). Furthermore, we find that <b>the</b> results <b>of</b> our <b>reconstructions</b> support substantially <b>the</b> recent local measurement of H_ 0 reported by Riess et al...|$|R

Licthon also constructed a new chapel dedicated to St John the Evangelist, and donated much of his own money to new service books and vestments, as well as to <b>the</b> <b>reconstruction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cathedral. He also authored several legal and religious texts, though none have survived.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the six-lane {{motorway}} {{began in}} 1977, initially as the Zagreb bypass, then {{continued in the}} 1980s as {{an expansion of the}} existing two-lane road between Zagreb and Belgrade.

Construction of the entire route was completed in 2006; further development entails new exits, new rest areas and <b>the</b> <b>reconstruction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> existing motorway. The construction cost of the A3 motorway is estimated at 7 billionCroatian kuna (approximately 958.9 millioneuro).|$|E

5|$|In poor {{condition}} {{in the mid-nineteenth}} century, the nave walls were leaning outward and the roofs decayed, so restoration was proposed in 1848 under R.K. Penson, but not actively pursued until the Reverend John Pugh became vicar in 1861, when new plans were made by William Butterfield. Butterfield however resigned in 1867 and the restoration was finally carried out 1867–84 by John Pollard Seddon. The church was substantially restored in stages {{at a cost of}} £8,500, and the roof was renewed, apart from the wagon roof over the chancel, which survives above Seddon's roof. The restoration work in general consisted of <b>the</b> <b>reconstruction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nave, the lifting and paving of the chancel, {{the construction of a new}} altar and <b>the</b> <b>reconstruction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> north and south transepts. The nave was opened in 1869 and the tower and south transepts were opened in 1880.|$|E
5|$|On March 23, 1688, the sheet-copper roof of {{the church}} was {{destroyed}} in a fire, but the church was restored relatively quickly. The storm in 1726 destroyed the roof again.

In the 19th century, <b>the</b> <b>reconstruction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ruins into a romantic castle park was started.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{constructed}} as a divided four-lane road with two traffic circles, {{the route of}} Highway420 formed part of the QEW between 1941 and 1972 before being assigned a unique route number.
