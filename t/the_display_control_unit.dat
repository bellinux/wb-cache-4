40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} reduce the effect on {{vehicles}} in the major road and shorten the waiting time of pedestrians, an adaptive pedestrians crossing signal control system was designed in this paper. The system was composed of capturing units of video and image sequence, <b>control</b> <b>units</b> and <b>display</b> units. Video and image sequences were real-timely acquired by capturing units. The main task of the <b>control</b> <b>units</b> was to adaptively calculate the waiting area and the waiting time of pedestrians. <b>The</b> <b>display</b> <b>units</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>the</b> status changes of signal light based on the processing results. It is pointed that the background of scene can be reconstructed correctly when the pedestrians begin to pass the street, and the total number of pedestrians and the waiting time can be detected effectively. The results indicate that adaptive pedestrian crossing system can control the signal status of pedestrian. Finally, some of the possible extensions of this technique are discussed...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{challenges}} for a pilot in the transition to a "glass" cockpit is understanding the Flight Management System (FMS).

In aircraft environments, crews often seem to have moments of high workload, resulting in poor decision making and errors.

40|$|A primary {{feature of}} the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) is {{trajectory}} based operations (TBO). Under TBO, aircraft flight plans are known to computer systems {{on the ground that}} aid in scheduling and separation. The Future Air Navigation System (FANS) was developed to support TBO, but relatively few aircraft in the US are FANSequipped. Thus, any near-term implementation must provide TBO procedures for non-FANS aircraft. Previous research has explored controller clearances, but any implementation must also provide procedures for aircraft requests. The work presented here aims to surface issues surrounding TBO communication procedures for non-FANS aircraft and for aircraft requesting deviations around weather. Three types of communication were explored: Voice, FANS, and ACARS,(Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System). ACARS and FANS are datacom systems that differ in that FANS allows uplinked flight plans to be loaded into the Flight Management System (FMS), while ACARS delivers flight plans as text that must be entered manually via <b>the</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Display</b> <b>Unit</b> (CDU). Sixteen pilots (eight two-person flight decks) and four controllers participated in 32 20 -minute scenarios that required the flight decks to navigate through convective weather as they approached their top of descents (TODs). Findings: The rate of non-conformance was higher than anticipated, with aircraft off path more than 20 % of the time. Controllers did not differentiate between the ACARS and FANS datacom, and were mixed in their preference for Voice vs. datacom (ACARS and FANS). Pilots uniformly preferred Voice to datacom, particularly ACARS. Much of their dislike appears to result from the slow response times in the datacom conditions. As a result, participants frequently resorted to voice communication. These results imply that, before implementing TBO in environments where pilots make weather deviation requests, {{further research is needed to}} develop communication procedures that integrate voice and datacom...|$|R
