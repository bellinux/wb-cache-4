5|$|Randall {{returned}} to Washington in March 1877 {{at the start}} of the 45th Congress and was reelected Speaker. As the session began, many in the Democratic caucus were determined to repeal the Specie Payment Resumption Act of 1875. That Act, passed when Republicans last controlled the House, was intended to gradually withdraw all greenbacks from circulation, replacing them with dollars backed in specie (i.e., gold or silver). With the elimination of the silver dollar in 1873, this would effectively return the United States to <b>the</b> <b>gold</b> <b>standard</b> <b>for</b> the first time since before the Civil War. Randall, who had voted against the act in 1875, agreed to let the House vote on its repeal, which narrowly passed. The Senate, still controlled by Republicans, declined to act on the bill.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>gold</b> <b>standard</b> <b>for</b> {{diagnosis}} of cirrhosis is a liver biopsy, through a percutaneous, transjugular, laparoscopic, or fine-needle approach. A biopsy {{is not necessary}} if the clinical, laboratory, and radiologic data suggests cirrhosis. Furthermore, {{there is a small}} but significant risk of complications from liver biopsy, and cirrhosis itself predisposes for complications caused by liver biopsy. The best predictors of cirrhosis are ascites, platelet count <160,000/mm3, spider angiomata, and a Bonacini cirrhosis discriminant score greater than 7.|$|E

25|$|The {{worldwide}} Great Depression of 1929 and {{the early}} 1930s had crippling effects on the Dutch economy, lasting longer than in most other European countries. The long duration of the Great Depression in the Netherlands is often explained by the very strict fiscal policy of the Dutch government at the time, and its decision to adhere to <b>the</b> <b>gold</b> <b>standard</b> <b>for</b> much longer than most of its trading partners. The depression led to high unemployment and widespread poverty, as well as increasing social unrest.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>gold</b> <b>standard</b> <b>for</b> {{diagnosis}} is identification of trypanosomes {{in a patient}} sample by microscopic examination. Patient samples {{that can be used}} for diagnosis include chancre fluid, lymph node aspirates, blood, bone marrow, and, during the neurological stage, cerebrospinal fluid. Detection of trypanosome-specific antibodies can be used for diagnosis, but the sensitivity and specificity of these methods are too variable to be used alone for clinical diagnosis. Further, seroconversion occurs after the onset of clinical symptoms during a T. b. rhodesiense infection, so is of limited diagnostic use.|$|E
25|$|Cortical {{stimulation}} mapping (CSM) {{is considered}} <b>the</b> <b>gold</b> <b>standard</b> <b>for</b> mapping functional {{regions of the}} brain to create a presurgical plan that maximizes the patient's functional outcome.

However, because it has the drawback of being an intraoperative technique, there is growing debate about its status as the preferred method. Instead, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), a new procedure that does not carry the same amount of surgical risk, is being considered.|$|E
