In the present study two experiments were performed {{to examine the relationship between}} children's operational level assessed by the conservation of number and intermediate-size transposition. Among older kindergarten children conservers and nonconservers were selected on the basis of the number-conservation task consisting of five subtests. They were given an intermediate-size transposition task. Experiment I: It was predicted from the O'Connor and Beilin study (1980) that the distance effect of transposition would occur for the nonconservers but not for the conservers. After reaching the training criteria of　 5 / 5 　and　 5 / 5 + 15 correct responses, the subjects were given one-step near test or three-step far test. The number of <b>transposers</b> was greater on the near test than on the far test and greater for the conservers than for the nonconservers. Since there was no sigificant interaction between conservation level and distance of test, however, the pressent hypothesis was not supported. Experiment II : To emphasize the stimuls changes, the form and color of stimuli were changed from the training to the test sets. The prediction was that the smallest performance difference in the transposition test of the conservers and the nonconservers would be found on the near-unchanged test while the largest difference would be found on the far-changed test. After reaching the training criterion of　 5 / 5, the subjects were given one-step near test or five-step far test under the stimuls changed or the stimuls unchanged condition. For the mean number of transposed responses and the number of <b>transposers</b> all the main effects and the interactions were not significant. Since there was no significant interaction of conservation level X distance of test X stimulus change, the present hypothesis was not supported. From these findings, it can be concluded that the conservers and the nonconservers assessed by the number-conservation task did not respond differentially to the near and the far tests in the intermediate-size transposition...|$|R

Sixty healthy volunteers (30 students, 30 ‘healthy elderly’) were tested on a simple visuo-spatial working memory task.

In recall, subjects were requested to report what stimuli they could remember, and where they could remember them. Ten trials were conducted. In five of the trials, subjects were asked to report exactly what they had just seen (condition one). In the remaining five trials they were asked to report from the opposite perspective, requiring a 180 o mental rotation of the memorised representation (condition two). The two conditions were requested at random. An additional case study of a patient with representational neglect (JG) is included as a means to find out the extent to which healthy controls perform exactly as neglect patients. A family study of an individual (Y 1) showing gross-transposition is also included, as a means to determine any hereditary factors of this phenomenon. Findings show a striking rightward bias of transposition errors, especially in condition one (double the number of stimuli were transposed towards the right). Age has clear detrimental effects on task performance, with <b>transposers</b> exceeding non-transposers in the healthy elderly group. Four individuals showing representational neglect are documented. All show characteristic behaviours that are analogous with behaviours seen in representational neglect patients.

Besides Doordarshan, Zee TV—an independent station broadcasting from Mumbai since 1992—uses satellite transmissions. In fact, because Doordarshan is the only network that is permitted to broadcast television signals domestically, Zee TV and other entrepreneurs broadcast their Indian-made videotapes via foreign transmitters. Other networks joining the fray are Cable News Network (1990); Asia Television Network (1991); Hong Kong-based Star TV (1991); Jain TV, near Bombay (1994); EL TV, a spin-off of Zee TV in Bombay (1994); HTV, an affiliate of the Hindustan Times in New Delhi (1994); and Sun TV, a Tamil language service in Chennai (1994).

50|$|His work in {{the late}} 1960s and early 1970s {{consisted}} of dividing up gallery spaces using partition walls and curtains, and designing environments that reflected or absorbed sound. For his first solo exhibition at the La Jolla Museum of Art, Asher installed a tone generator {{in one of the}} gallery walls that effectively cancelled out all sound waves in the room, creating a dead zone {{in the center of the}} gallery. In 1969, for the group show “Anti-Illusion: Procedures/Materials” at the Whitney Museum of American Art, he concealed a blower above a door to create a slab of air that visitors passed through when they moved from one gallery to the next. In the 1970s he began to remove elements from spaces, for example sandblasting away layers of paint (at Galleria Toselli, Milan, in 1973) or removing the partition walls separating an exhibition space from the gallery office. More dramatically, in his piece Installation (1970) at Pomona College, he created a work by reconfiguring the interior space of a gallery and then leaving the gallery open, without a door, 24 hours a day, introducing light and the noise of the street into the gallery as experiential elements. For another early work at the Claire Copley Gallery in Los Angeles, in 1974, he removed a crucial wall that protected the office space from view, framing the art gallery's behind-the-scenes business operations as something worth viewing itself. Further exploration into the workings of the gallery as institution took place in 1977, where he held an exhibition in both the Claire Copley and Morgan Thomas galleries. The exhibition took on the function of <b>transposer,</b> placing both gallery owners in the space of the other, displaying their own unique curatorial choices. In 1979 he started to reposition objects in museum collections. Sometimes Asher gathers facts, like the list he published of all the artworks ever deaccessioned by the Museum of Modern Art. For a show at the Santa Monica Museum of Art in 2008, he decided to re-create all the 44 stud walls that have been built for every exhibition since the museum relocated to Bergamot Station in May 1998. Architectural floor plans for those 44 exhibitions, captioned with the title and dates of each one, are displayed in a small gallery at the show's entrance, providing a key to what visitors are about to see.|$|E

In this project a novel design of SMS based remote monitoring and controlling of <b>transposer</b> is implemented using GSM technology. From kondapalli TV transmitter we are receiving two channels at Gandhi hill like channel 7 and channel 9. The one town area comes under shadow region hence we cannot get those channels at that particular place, in order to overcome electromagnetic interference we have to up-convert channel 7 to channel 11 by using IF filter. Hence we have to monitor channel 7 and channel 11 by GSM modem, we can check those frequencies, and we have two battery banks, these will monitored and controlled by the GSM commands. Because of this project the one town area which is comes under shadow region can get channels like channel 7 and channel 9 but channel 7 in the form of channel 11, which has same information of audio and video.

40|$|The intralingual {{translation}} or rewording of a Bible text into Non-standard Afrikaans: {{the artistic}} and creative aspects behind it People who are proficient {{in a language}} {{to the extent that}} they can communicate confi dently and comfortably in it, are not always aware of the technical points and artistic aspects which need to be considered when translating/interpreting/ transmutating from one language into another. These manifest in the following situations: (a) texts of which the original has been recorded in Standard Afrikaans, but which should be received by the variety user in his or her own dialect/code in order to be better understood; and the reverse, (b) original texts of the variety user which exist as spoken texts in the source language/code/dialect only, and have to be translated into the standard language so that other speakers of this language can also access them. It is sometimes thought that anybody who is proficient in a specific language, be it the standard language or a variety thereof, can translate from one into the other. In this process, however, a treasure of creativity, art and knowledge is overlooked, thus diminishing the enjoyment of reading a text. If, on the contrary, the art behind the translation of a text is comprehended, enjoyment when reading the translation is enhanced. Because language is descriptive, the reader who is exposed to a translation of the text will be introduced to the idiomatic use of the source language and thus obtain a view into the world, culture, habits and traditions of the variety user. The research reported in this article was directed by the following: the translation of a part of the Bible into Non-standard Afrikaans should be considered a rewording (intralingual translation) and not a translation (interlingual translation) or adaptation (intersemiotic translation). Intralingual translation recognizes the aspects of creativity and art to introduce and discuss the defence of this claim to the broader academic society. If a text cannot be identified as an intralingual translation the artistic and creative elements underpinning it cannot be recognized or appreciated. Intralingual translation attempts to give configuration to the creativity and verbal art of the original variety of e. g. Afrikaans, even though it has never been recorded before. Something of the creativity and artistic principles involved in intralingual translation manifests in the attempts of the translater to transpose the text from Standard Afrikaans into the variety. It requires an artistic approach to transpose a text from Standard Afrikaans into a code of Afrikaans in such a way that it will read as a text with which the varietal speaker will be able to identify. According to Munday (2004 : 24) it is essential that the <b>transposer</b> has the ability to use both codes of a language like a mother tongue speaker, with knowledge of and insight into the cultural background, humour and customs of both codes. With knowledge of both codes the <b>transposer</b> does not merely reset the text into readable format, but also recreates those elements that are not apparent in words. The claim made above has been approached from three points of view, viz. the reality that very few texts have been recorded in Non-standard Afrikaans, Jakobson's theory that the signs in the source text must be replaced with signs of equivalent value or meaning in the target text; and some findings by Du Plessis (2006) that it is important that the intralingual translation takes place on three levels, namely: the language level, the geographic level and the religious level. After a short theoretical-technical discussion, an intralingual translation of a part from the Bible in Standard Afrikaans into Tsotsi-Afrikaans is presented. This is followed by a discussion of the creative, technical and artistic aspects involved in the specific intralingual translation. Die oorsetting van ’n Bybelteks na Niestandaardafrikaans: die kunssinnigheids- en kreatiewe aspekte daaragter Die oorsetting van 'n teks (soos 'n Bybelgedeelte) na Niestandaardafrikaans moet beskou word as 'n transponering (intratalige vertaling) daarvan en nie as 'n getroue en presiese vertaling (intertalige vertaling) of ook nie 'n aanpassing (intersemiotiese vertaling) nie, omdat die term transponering erkenning gee aan die kunssinnige- en kreatiwiteitsaspekte van die oorsetting.

40|$|The {{subject of}} my thesis is the McKean-Vlasov diffusion. The {{motion of the}} process is subject to three {{concurrent}} forces: the gradient of a confining potential V, some Brownian motion with a constant coefficient of diffusion and the so-called self-stabilizing term which {{is equal to the}} convolution between the derivative of a convex potential F and the own law of the process (which represents the average tension between all the trajectories). There are many results if V is convex. The purpose is to extend these in the general case especially when the landscape contains several wells. Essential differences are found. The first chapter proves the strong existence of a solution on the set of the positive reals. The second one deals with the stationary measure(s). Particularly, the existence and the non-uniqueness are highlighted under weak assumptions when the diffusion coefficient is sufficiently small. The critical value under which several measures appear is also examinated. Chapter three and four are assigned to the asymptotic analysis in the small-noise limit of these measures. It is proved that each family of stationary measures has a limiting value. Moreover, it is a finite combination of Dirac measures. Chapter five connects the self-stabilizing process and some mean-field systems. In one hand, it is stressed that a uniform (with respect to the time) propagation of chaos is not possible. In an other hand, by making a little modification of the interacting system, it is proved that a half-uniform propagation of chaos holds. With three different methods, the uniqueness problem (of the stationary measures) is studied in Chapter six. The first method derives from the computations of Chapter four for the asymmetric measures and for the symmetric ones if V''(0) +F''(0) is not equal to 0. The second one uses the half-uniform propagation of chaos and is applied for the symmetric measures if V''(0) +F''(0) is nonnegative. The last method is classical and direct but can only be used for the symmetric measures if V''(0) +F''(0) > 0. Chapter seven is devoted {{to the study of the}} long-time behavior. In one hand, a convergence's result is provided in a simple case by using the half-uniform propagation of chaos. In the other hand, a large deviations principle is highlighted by using results closed to those of Freidlin and Wentzell. Various asymptotic lemmas are proved in Annex A and some classical results of the Freidlin-Wentzell theory are recalled in Annex B. Les processus auto-stabilisants sont définis comme des solutions d'équations différentielles stochastiques dont le terme de dérive contient à la fois le gradient d'un potentiel ainsi qu'un terme non-linéaire au sens de McKean qui attire le processus vers sa propre loi de distribution. On dispose de nombreux résultats lorsque l'environnement est convexe. L'objet de ce travail est de les étendre autant que possible au cas général notamment lorsque le paysage contient plusieurs puits. Des différences fondamentales sont constatées. Le premier chapitre prouve l'existence d'une solution forte. Le second s'intéresse aux lois de probabilités d'une telle solution. En particulier, l'existence et la non-unicité des mesures stationnaires sont mises en évidence sous des hypothèses faibles. Les chapitres trois et quatre sont affectés au comportement de ces mesures lorsque le coefficient de diffusion tend vers 0. Le chapitre cinq met en relation le processus auto-stabilisant avec des systèmes particulaires via une "propagation du chaos". Il est ainsi possible de <b>transposer</b> certains résultats du système de particules sur le processus non-markovien et réciproquement. Le chapitre six est dédié au dénombrement exact des mesures stationnaires. Le chapitre sept est employé pour l'étude du comportement en temps long.

40|$|International audienceAwaited since 2006, iCann (internet Corporation for {{assigned}} {{names and}} numbers), the organisation of international regulation of internet, began on January 12 th 2012 {{to open up}} the Domain name System by launching the registration procedures and the online tlD application System (top-level Domain i. e. a component of web addresses). iCann manages the tlDs, such as dotfr, dotcom, dotbiz, using a name system, the DNS. The DNS provides the translation of the iP addresses from their digital form into a linguistic form. in 1984, in the rFC 920 document, Jon Postel and Joyce reynolds designed the initial set of top-level domains in the DnS made of 5 generic top-level Domains (gtlDs) (. gov,. edu,. com,. org. mil) and 244 country-code top-level Domains (cctlDs) according to the iSo standard 3166 - 1 for the representation of names of Countries, such as. fr for France. (Klein, p. 123). in order to simplify, only communities referring to a recognized territory or that were economically relevant were considered for representation. Should we consider that the creation of this new tlD offers a new opportunity for discussing the process of the administrative homogenization based on ICANN discourse and the DNS, this web stabilization system? or, more precisely, which territories can adopt iCann's values and representations to guarantee their presence on the web?in 2006, when the tlD for the Catalan linguistic and cultural community (the dotcat) was accepted, a flaw appeared in this stabilized DNS. This region did not have a standard iSo 3166 - 1, and so was not supposed to be granted a country-code. However, Catalonia obtained a sponsored top-level Domain according to the iSo standard 639 - 2 for the representation of languages. this aberrant case in the DnS demonstrates that the strategies related to the technocratic structures (FoUCaUlt, 1993) come from political, economic and scientific rationalities, whereas the tactics are akin to métis, the art of trickery and "do-it-yourself" know-how. (De CerteaU, 1990). We will detail this métis {{in the case of the}} dotcat registration. Following the dotcat, many projects appeared whose purposes were territorial (such as. berlin,. paris) or cultural and linguistic, such as. bzh (Brittany). But in 2012 the new tlD will be open for companies as well: tlDs such as. boeing or. nike might appear. thus, this question of web addresses is neither anecdotal nor technical. the Url is always displayed in the address bar of a web browser and due to this visible position, it carries an " identity sign " (Jeanneret et al., p. 139). These authors analyze the circulation of writing on the web as social mediation, and they emphasize the role of the Url in the address bar of a web browser compared to the hyperlinks embedded in the text. " Cependant avant même d'exister à l'écran, dans la " page web " ouverte dans le navigateur, le texte peut se trouver qualifié dans une source extérieure - annuaire de recherche, liste d'Url, article de journal spécialisé - par son nom de domaine. " (SoUCHier et al., p. 61). Within the process of this new tlD registration, the status of a web address may raise two questions: 1. What does a tlD users' community mean?these registration modalities open up the black box of the notion of community so widespread throughout the web. How is a TLD users' community defined? The Bzh project's leaders must comply with the ICANN standards (technical and socio-economic). Borders related to physical territory should not appear. they must define a users' community worldwide and no longer at the regional level neither too large, nor too restricted in order to demonstrate the technical, operational, and financial viabilities of the project. Who are the actors who will compose this tlD? through this move, the artefact and its international regulatory body not only monitor the technical distribution of domain names but design the very notion of community on the web. However, there is a difference between a dotbiz community and a cultural and linguistic dotbzh users' community. By comparing the Catalan and the Breton projects and by analyzing the ICANN's TLD applicant's guidebook, we shall discuss the notion of community as related to organizational and political stakes, using the concept of " imagined community " (anDerSon, 2002). 2. What are the territories able to exist on the web, to transpose themselves from a " physical " territory to a " web " territory?these registration modalities create a constraining framework that favours compromises between States interests, firms' interests (brands and trademarks) and the DnS stability. this opening-up is labelled as a "democratization process" whereas the cost of registration is growing and the arbitration's proceedings will rely on auction sales. Dealing with this regulation process carried out by an international regulatory body, the various territories (without any legal status of representation in iCann terms) can nevertheless grab the opportunity offered by the cultural diversity argument on the web. We shall detail the felicity conditions for the existence of any given territory on the web, specifying the nature of mediations between a territory and the web in this new frame of reference. Our method is based on 4 interviews of dotbzh project leaders and the analysis of iCann tlD applicant guidebooks conducted since 2008. We shall compare the BZH project with the doctcat project. in order to describe the mediations between a territory and the web, we shall rely on 5 mediations resulting from the analysis of a corpus (collected and designed during our PhD thesis) consisting of 591 websites. this corpus, "Breton regional Web", was indexed using 11 attributes and a 7 -step semiotic analysis of each website was conducted in order to show how an attachment to a territory on a website works. this analysis emphasizes the specific importance of the URL as a sign for naming as well as for creating identification with a territorial attachment on the web. Attendue depuis 2006, l'iCann (internet Corporation for assigned names and numbers), organisme international de régulation de l'internet a autorisé le 12 janvier 2012 une ouverture dans le système de nommage du web en lançant les modalités de création et de dépôt en ligne de nouvelles extensions pour les noms de domaines (composants des adresses web). l'iCann gère les autorisations de noms de domaine, tels que. fr,. com,. biz, selon un système de nommage (DnS, Domain name System). le DnS assure la traduction des adresses internet de leur forme numérique à une forme littéraire. en 1984, dans le document rFC 920, Jon Postel et Joyce reynolds ont créé les échelons supérieurs dans le DnS composé de cinq generic top-level Domain ou nom de domaine générique (gtlD) (gov,. edu,. com,. org,. mil) et de 244 tlD country-code ou code-pays (cctlD) correspondant au code iSo 3166 - 1 du pays concerné, comme. fr pour la France (KLEIN, p. 123). Afin de simplifier, seules les communautés d'utilisateurs ayant un territoire de référence reconnu ou économiquement viables pouvaient être représentées sur le web. en quoi ces nouvelles d'extensions permettent de discuter le processus d'homogénéisation administrative basé sur le discours de l'iCann et ce système de stabilisation du web, le DnS ? ou, plus précisément, quels sont les territoires capables de reprendre les valeurs et les représentations de l'iCann pour assurer leur présence sur le web ?en 2006, la Catalogne crée une faille dans ce système stabilisé en obtenant une extension à caractère linguistique et culturel, le. cat. Cette région n'ayant pas de code iSo 3166 - 1 n'a pas le droit à un code-pays. elle obtient donc un nom de domaine sponsorisé (sponsored tlD) selon un code pour la représentation des noms de langues iSo 639 - 2. Ce cas anomique dans le système de nommage montre que les stratégies, liées aux structures technocratiques (FoUCaUlt, 1993) sont issues des rationalités politique, économique et scientifique alors que la tactique se situe dans la métis, l'art de faire fait de ruse et de bricolages (De CerteaU, 1990). nous détaillerons cette métis à partir de la création du. cat. Suite à ce. cat, les projets se sont multipliés à caractère territorial, comme le. berlin, le. paris ou culturel et linguistique, comme le. bzh (Bretagne). Mais, l'ouverture en 2012 de nouvelles extensions concerne également les entreprises puisque des extensions comme. boeing ou. nike pourraient apparaître sur le web. ainsi, cette question des adresses Url n'est pas anecdotique, ni purement technique. l'Url demeure dans la barre d'adressage du navigateur et dès cet emplacement, elle est porteuse d'" un signe d'identité " (Jeanneret et al., p. 139). en analysant la circulation de l'écrit sur le web comme médiation sociale, ces auteurs distinguent les liens hypertextes présents dans le texte des Url des navigateurs. " Cependant avant même d'exister à l'écran, dans la " page web " ouverte dans le navigateur, le texte peut se trouver qualifié dans une source extérieure - annuaire de re cherche, liste d'Url, article de journal spécialisé - par son nom de domaine. " (SoUCHier et al., p. 61). Dans le cadre du dépôt de nouvelles extensions, cette adresse Url pose deux questions : 1. Que signifie une communauté d'utilisateurs d'un nom de domaine?Ces modalités de dépôt de candidature obligent à questionner la notion de communauté, si répandue sur le web. Comment est définie une communauté d'utilisateurs d'un nom de domaine ? les porteurs de projet du. bzh doivent répondre aux normes (techniques et socio-économiques) de l'iCann. les frontières liées à un territoire ne pouvant pas apparaître, ils doivent définir une communauté d'utilisateurs à l'échelle mondiale et non plus régionale, ni trop large, ni trop restreinte pour démontrer les viabilités technique, opérationnelle et économique du. bzh. Quels seront alors les acteurs qui composeront cette extension? l'artefact et son organisme international de régulation viennent à formaliser la notion de communauté sur le web. or, il existe une différence entre une communauté d'utilisateurs du. biz et des utilisateurs d'une extension culturelle et linguistique du. bzh. En comparant le projet catalan et le projet breton et en analysant les guides de candidature de l'iCann, nous questionnerons cette notion de communauté liée à des enjeux organisationnels et socio-politiques à partir du concept de communauté imaginée (anDerSon, 2002). 2. Quels sont les territoires capables d'exister sur le web, de se <b>transposer</b> du territoire " physique " à un territoire " web " ?Ces modalités de dépôt de candidature ont obligé à concilier les intérêts des États, des entreprises (protection des noms de marque) et la stabilité du DnS. Cette ouverture est portée par un discours de " démocratisation " alors que le coût du dépôt de candidature augmente et que les procédures d'arbitrage reposeront sur des enchères. Face à un processus de régulation porté par un organisme international, les divers territoires, n'ayant pas de statut légal de représentation auprès de l'iCann comme un État, peuvent néanmoins saisir ici l'opportunité de la présence de la diversité culturelle sur le web. nous détaillerons quelles sont les conditions de félicité à réunir pour faire exister certains territoires sur le web en précisant les médiations entre un territoire et ce nouvel univers de référence qu'est le web. la méthode se base sur 4 entretiens semi-directifs avec les porteurs du projet. bzh, le suivi de la préparation du dossier de candidature et l'analyse des guides de candidature de l'iCann depuis 2008. nous comparerons le projet. bzh avec l'analyse du projet et du fonctionnement du. cat. nous pourrons nous appuyer pour décrire les médiations entre territoire et web sur 5 médiations résultant de l'analyse d'un corpus de thèse composé de 591 sites web intitulé " web régional breton ". Ce corpus a été analysé quantitativement à partir de 11 indicateurs et qualitativement avec une méthode d'analyse sémiotique d'un site web en 7 étapes pour présenter ce qui attache à un territoire sur le web. Cette analyse démontre l'importance de l'Url comme signe de nomination, d'identification et d'attachement territorial sur le web...|$|E
