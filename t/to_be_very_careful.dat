5|$|The Wolds area {{takes the}} form of an elevated, gently rolling plateau, cut by {{numerous}} deep, steep-sided, flat-bottomed valleys of glacial origin. The chalk formation of the hills provides exceptionally good drainage, with the result that most of these valleys are dry. Surface water is quite scarce throughout the Wolds. At Flamborough Head the Wolds rise up to form high chalk cliffs, where there are water-worn caves and stacks along the shore. Flamborough Headland is designated a Heritage Coast. Coastal erosion around Flamborough Head has led to visitors being warned by the Humber Coastguard <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>careful</b> on coastal paths.|$|E

500|$|With {{an exaggerated}} and unusual batting style, Bagwell waited for each pitch {{in a low}} crouch, with legs wide open and knees bent nearly 90 degrees, {{appearing}} {{as if he was}} sitting on an invisible bench. [...] He stepped back with his front foot as he began his swing. [...] Next, he would rise from his stance and rotate his hands with the bat forward into his powerful, uppercut swing. [...] "That wide stance keeps him from over striding", Joe Torre observed, [...] "which can be your biggest problem when you’re trying to hit for power." [...] The low crouch also shrunk his strike zone, allowing him to walk more often. [...] Standing 6 feet tall (...) and weighing , he did not present the image of an imposing, home run-hitting giant that would cause pitchers <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>careful</b> when he batted after he began his major league career.|$|E
500|$|During production, {{the film}} {{underwent}} two name changes. The project was initially titled Seven, which became Ek Bataa Saat and finally 7 Khoon Maaf. In the film, Chopra's character ages from 20 to 65, and prosthetic makeup {{was used for}} her looks at different ages. Bhardwaj hired Hollywood special makeup effects artist Greg Cannom, who did the makeup for 2008's The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, to create seven looks for the character. Chopra found the most challenging period {{was that of the}} 65-year-old woman. The actress said, [...] "prosthetics had to play a heavy part but I’m happy that I pushed myself as the result is really fab. I had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>careful</b> of not doing things that would damage the make-up". To make Chopra look authentic, the makeup team used Chopra's mother's and grandmother’s photos to create her look. She had to gain five kg weight to fit her aging character.|$|E

2500|$|This {{painting}} allegorically {{depicts the}} first meeting of Marie and Henry, which took place after their nuptials by proxy. The upper half of the painting shows Marie and Henry as the mythological Roman gods Juno and Jupiter. The representations are accompanied by their traditional attributes. Marie is shown as Juno (Greek Hera) identified by the peacocks and chariot. Henry is shown as Jupiter (Greek Zeus) identified by the fiery thunderbolts in his hand and the eagle. The joining of the couple's right hands is a traditional symbol of the marriage union. They are dressed in the classical style, which is naturally appropriate to the scene. Above the two stands Hymen who unites them. A rainbow extends from the left corner, a symbol of concord and peace. The lower half of the painting is dominated by imagery of Lyons. Reading from left to right, we see the cityscape with its single hill. The lions pull the chariot (which is a pun on the name of the city), and in the chariot we see the allegorical figure of the city herself with a crown of her battlements: Lyons. Rubens needed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>careful</b> in the representation of the couple's first meeting because allegedly Henry was very much involved with a mistress {{at the time of the}} marriage. In fact, due to the king's other engagements their introduction was delayed, and it was not until midnight nearly a week after Marie arrived that Henry finally joined his bride. [...] By presenting him as Jupiter Rubens implies the promiscuity of the man and the deity. Simultaneously by placing King and Queen together he effectively illustrates the elevated status of the couple.|$|E
