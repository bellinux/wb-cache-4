5|$|After the {{collapse}} {{of the power of the}} Howards, the county of Suffolk was controlled by an oligarchy of Protestant gentry by the 17th century and did not play a prominent part in the English Civil War <b>that</b> <b>occurred</b> between 1642–6. Framlingham Castle escaped the slighting <b>that</b> <b>occurred</b> to many other English castles around this time. Hitcham's bequest had meanwhile become entangled in the law courts and work did not begin on the poorhouse until the late 1650s, by which time the internal buildings of castle were being broken up for the value of their stone; the chapel had been destroyed in this way by 1657.|$|E
50|$|There {{appear to}} be at least three {{different}} contexts within which involuntary memory arises, as described by J.H. Mace in his book, Involuntary Memory.

5|$|Several {{strands of}} the SAF {{in the eastern}} region of the San Francisco Bay Area are the Hayward–Rodgers Creek and Calaveras Faults. The Hayward Fault {{exhibits}} fault creep, {{but it also has}} potential for large earthquakes, like the 1868 Hayward earthquake <b>that</b> <b>occurred</b> on its southern segment. The northern Calaveras Fault meets the Hayward Fault near the Calaveras Reservoir and can also produce large earthquakes. Except for a ~M6.5 shock <b>that</b> <b>occurred</b> in 1911, the central and southern segments might only produce smaller events and fault creep.|$|E

Made on a budget of $9 million, the film was shot on location in rural South Carolina in the fall of 2006.

5|$|According {{to genetic}} studies, the {{families}} Hyloidea, Microhylidae, and the clade Natatanura (comprising about 88% of living frogs) diversified simultaneously some 66 million years ago, {{soon after the}} Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event associated with the Chicxulub impactor. All origins of arboreality (e.g. in Hyloidea and Natatanura) follow from that time and the resurgence of forest <b>that</b> <b>occurred</b> afterwards.|$|E
5|$|After TransNet was renewed in November 2004, {{planning}} {{continued for}} widening the remaining portion of SR76 west of I-15, {{due to the}} frequent accidents <b>that</b> <b>occurred</b> on the eastern portion, although some claimed that the habits of drivers were at fault.

5|$|After the {{disaster}} caused by Hurricane Mitch, {{countries around the}} world donated significant aid, totaling $6.3billion (1998USD). Throughout Central America, which was recovering from an economic crisis <b>that</b> <b>occurred</b> in 1996, many wished to continue the growth of the infrastructure and economy. In addition, after witnessing the vulnerability to hurricanes, the affected governments endeavored to prevent such a disaster from occurring again.|$|E

5|$|Archaeological {{surveys have}} found {{evidence}} that Native Americans used the immediate vicinity of Yucca Mountain on a temporary or seasonal basis. Some Native Americans disagree with the conclusions of archaeological investigators that their ancestors were highly mobile groups of hunter-gatherers who occupied the Yucca Mountain area before Euroamericans began using the area for prospecting, surveying, and ranching. They believe that these conclusions overlook traditional accounts of farming <b>that</b> <b>occurred</b> before European contact.|$|E
5|$|Because of a weak–moderate La Niña episode, most {{tropical}} cyclones {{that developed}} within the season occurred within the Coral Sea. The weak La Nina conditions also affected {{the amount of}} tropical cyclones <b>that</b> <b>occurred</b> during the year, with only 5 tropical cyclones occurring within the basin. During December 24, Tropical Cyclone Gertie moved into the basin from the Australian region, before it passed {{to the south of}} New Caledonia and weakened below tropical cyclone intensity.|$|E
5|$|Despite his willing {{adherence}} to the Southern position {{on the issues that}} were dividing the country, Mallory was not prominent in the secession movement.

5|$|Eventually, several {{independent}} {{groups of}} experimenters in the mid-60s {{realized that the}} fringes encoded important information about dimensional changes occurring in the subject, and began intentionally producing holographic double exposures.

5|$|However, this winding route {{proved to}} be too {{dangerous}} and difficult for the explosion of vehicle traffic <b>that</b> <b>occurred</b> after World War II.

However, by 1960 the use of the rails had declined so much that service was stopped. The tracks were lifted two years later.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, an enquiry {{investigated}} the Fremantle Prison riot <b>that</b> <b>occurred</b> {{at the start}} of the year.
