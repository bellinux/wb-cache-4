It's like this, sir," [...] said Edwards, who had not quite relished being called [...] "my good friend." [...] "They haven't got any grievance--nothing to hit with, don't you see, sir; and then there's not much <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> <b>against,</b> because the Government is more like a kind of general Providence, {{directing}} an old-established state of things, than that at home, where there's something new thrown down for us to fight about every three months." ...|$|E
6000|$|... (7) Still more {{remarkable}} are the traps in the flower of Asclepias which catch flies, butterflies, and wasps by the legs, and the wonderfully complex arrangements of the orchids. One of these, our common Orchis pyramidalis, may be briefly described {{to show how}} varied and beautiful are the arrangements to secure cross-fertilisation. The broad trifid lip of the flower offers a support to the moth which is attracted by its sweet odour, and two ridges at the base guide the proboscis with certainty to the narrow entrance of the nectary. When the proboscis has {{reached the end of}} the spur, its basal portion depresses the little hinged rostellum that covers the saddle-shaped sticky glands to which the pollen masses (pollinia) are attached. On the proboscis being withdrawn, the two pollinia stand erect and parallel, firmly attached to the proboscis. In this position, however, they would be useless, as they would miss the stigmatic surface of the next flower visited by the moth. But as soon as the proboscis is withdrawn, the two pollen masses begin to diverge till they are exactly as far apart as are the stigmas of the flower; and then commences a second movement which brings them down till they project straight forward nearly at right angles to their first position, so as exactly <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> <b>against</b> the stigmatic surfaces of the next flower visited on which they leave a portion of their pollen. The whole of these motions take about half a minute, and in that time the moth will usually have flown to another plant, and thus effect the most beneficial kind of cross-fertilisation.[145] This description will be better understood by referring to the illustration opposite, from Darwin's Fertilisation of Orchids(Fig. 30).|$|E

5000|$|He {{spent the}} 1st {{half of the}} season playing in Western League (farm games), where until June, he {{averaged}} [...]232 and batted in 14 runs (1 HR). Finally on June 23, he was called <b>to</b> pinch <b>hit</b> <b>against</b> the Carps in Mazda Stadium.|$|R
50|$|Herrera added <b>to</b> his <b>hit</b> streak <b>against</b> the Braves with {{a two-run}} shot to right field as the Braves fell 5-2 to the Philadelphia Phillies on August 8.|$|R
50|$|Born in Hamburg, Germany to Brigitte and Peter Haas, Tommy {{started playing}} {{his own version}} of tennis when he was four years old, using a wooden plank <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> balls <b>against</b> the wall or into his father's hands. When his father {{observed}} his talents, he started bringing Haas to work, as he was a tennis coach.|$|R
5000|$|During World War II, street-style craps {{became popular}} among soldiers, who often played it using an Army blanket as a {{shooting}} surface. With no backboard or sidewalk curb <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> <b>against,</b> this {{gave rise to}} presumed methods of dice control, of which the best {{was known as the}} [...] "army blanket roll".|$|E
5000|$|During the 1945 season, Leonard {{was part}} of what was {{possibly}} the only four-man rotation in baseball history to have been all knuckleball pitchers. Reportedly, after facing Leonard, Jackie Robinson once said: [...] "I am glad of one thing, and that is I don't have <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> <b>against</b> Dutch Leonard every day. Man, what a knuckleball that fellow has. It comes up, makes a face at you, then runs away." ...|$|E
50|$|After two rough months, Matz pitched well in August, {{striking}} out 9 in 6 innings against the Arizona Diamondbacks on August 9, and then taking a no-hitter into the 8th inning {{in his next}} start against the San Diego Padres. Matz struck out 8 batters in that game, {{and picked up his}} ninth win of the season, giving him a 9-8 win-loss record. Alexei Ramírez was the first Padre <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> <b>against</b> Matz in that game.|$|E
2500|$|Norway {{along with}} other Scandinavian countries, {{supported}} the US War on Terror. The Norwegian government {{was one of the}} strongest supporters for the war, Jens Stoltenberg even said [...] "It is also in our interests <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> back <b>against</b> such attacks," [...] but added later [...] "we assume that the USA is not interested in retaliating in any way which could pose a threat to world peace." ...|$|R
50|$|Phelps' final {{home run}} {{might have been}} his most notable; it came with Oakland before a {{sell-out}} home crowd in 1990 on April 20, with two outs {{in the bottom of}} the ninth that Friday night. Phelps was called out of the dugout <b>to</b> pinch <b>hit</b> <b>against</b> Brian Holman of the Mariners, who had retired the first 26 batters in succession; he homered on the first pitch to ruin the perfect game.|$|R
5000|$|In the September 1949 {{issue of}} SPORT, Hank Greenberg said that DiMaggio covered so much ground {{in center field}} {{that the only way}} <b>to</b> get a <b>hit</b> <b>against</b> the Yankees was [...] "to hit 'em where Joe wasn't." [...] DiMaggio also stole home five times in his career.|$|R
50|$|Waner {{was born}} on March 16, 1906 in Harrah, Oklahoma, and {{grew up on a}} farm with his older brother, Paul. The two worked from dawn to dusk every day, and {{baseball}} was their only form of entertainment. Influenced by their father, who was a minor league player in Oklahoma City, Paul and Lloyd's love and natural talent for the game developed over the years. The Waners learned <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> <b>against</b> corncobs and cut down saplings in the woods to use as bats. Lloyd graduated from McLoud High School and attended three semesters at East Central State University in Ada, Oklahoma before going into professional baseball.|$|E
5000|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Michael Salomon and premiered in June 2006. [...] The video depicts a baseball team's practice. The team can't get one batter <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> <b>against</b> the pitcher, who is a self-centered egomaniac and thinks he is God's gift to women. The crowd of fans starts to leave when the groundskeeper (Trace Adkins) {{steps up to the}} plate and asks for a pitch. The pitcher is more than happy to oblige, as he had just managed to strike out the whole team. The groundskeeper is successful hitting a home run on a fastball and runs the bases, all the time making fun of the pitch. When crossing home, the girl jumps into his arms.|$|E
50|$|The bolt assembly, which {{comprised}} the top rearward {{portion of the}} pistol, moved behind as well as above the axis of the barrel and resembled an L shape. The recoil spring was contained in the portion above the bolt, which also housed the firing pin. Above the barrel was a large frame lug, which gave the gun a pleasing look of constant width and depth from the trigger guard forward to the muzzle, while also serving as a solid block for the bolt <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> <b>against</b> when the recoil spring returned the bolt to battery. The low bore axis served to greatly reduce muzzle jump, and served to allow the fitting of a suppressor without losing {{the use of the}} factory sights.|$|E

25|$|In early May, Kansas City {{completed}} their second series sweep against Detroit, advancing to 6-0 over the Tigers on the season. Jon Lester of the Boston Red Sox threw a no-hitter against Kansas City on May 19. It {{was just the}} Royals' second game <b>to</b> register no <b>hits</b> <b>against</b> an opponent, and the first since May 15, 1973.|$|R
50|$|If the batsman {{is unable}} <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> the ball <b>against</b> the back wall, he may instead resort to {{attempting}} to score 3 runs by <b>hitting</b> the ball <b>against</b> a side wall and completing a quick single with his partner. In order {{to attempt to}} prevent this, the remaining two fielders are generally placed {{on either side of}} the batsman in front of the side wall.|$|R
50|$|Game 2 {{was billed}} as a matchup of aces in nineteen-game winner Fausto Carmona and veteran postseason ace Curt Schilling. However, both {{starters}} were out by the fifth as both offenses took charge in what evolved into an eleven-inning, run-scoring saga that clocked in at 5 hours and 14 minutes. Both sides exchanged leads {{in the bottom of}} the third and the top of the fourth. Manny Ramírez hit an opposite-field two-run home run, followed by a Mike Lowell solo home run over the Green Monster, both off Indians reliever Rafael Pérez. In the top of the fourth, Jhonny Peralta hit a three-run blast into the camera well in center field off Schilling, giving the Indians a 4-3 lead. Each team's bullpen put up scoreless frames after the sixth inning, leading to extra frames with the score tied at six. The eleventh inning proved to be a historic one as Cleveland took advantage by scoring seven runs off a shaky Sox bullpen, a postseason record for runs in an extra inning by one team. One of the highlights was the go-ahead RBI single by former Red Sox right fielder Trot Nixon off Boston's lefty specialist Javier López. What made the base hit significant is that Nixon has historically struggled against left-handed pitching, but manager Eric Wedge left Nixon in <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> <b>against</b> López, and the move paid off. A wild pitch allowed another run to score. After retiring Víctor Martínez, López gave up a single to Ryan Garko and was lifted for Jon Lester, the only pitcher left in the Boston bullpen. Lester did not fare much better; Peralta greeted him with a run-scoring double, which was immediately followed by Franklin Gutiérrez's three-run homer, capping the scoring as the Indians took Game 2 by a score of 13-6.|$|E
50|$|Part was {{dogged by}} a failure <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> his doubles <b>against</b> Mardle in the semi. Neither player was outstanding, yet Mardle raced to a 3-0 lead. Despite a mini-fightback from the Canadian {{to win the}} 4th set, it was Mardle {{who went to the}} final a 4-1 winner.|$|R
50|$|July 30 - Just as he predicts, Philadelphia Phillies pitcher Art Mahaffey picks off {{the first}} batter <b>to</b> get a <b>hit</b> <b>against</b> him. Then with the next batter <b>to</b> get a <b>hit,</b> he does it again. Curt Flood and Bill White of the St. Louis Cardinals are the base runner victims, but St. Louis still wins, 6-3. In his next game, the first batter <b>to</b> get a <b>hit</b> off Mahaffey will be Jim Marshall, and Mahaffey will pick him off as well.|$|R
50|$|Once the {{take-off}} leg {{has left}} the ground (but not before) the athlete should attempt to pull the upper body face down towards the knee, also to keep the centre of mass {{as close as possible}} to the bar. Care must be taken not <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> the head <b>against</b> the knee.|$|R
50|$|Their league {{campaign}} was overshadowed though by a run to that year's FA Cup Final, during which McCalliog scored at Aston Villa and Bradford {{in the preceding}} rounds. He gained the first winners' medal of his career as he supplied the through-ball for Bobby Stokes <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> the winner <b>against</b> favourites Manchester United.|$|R
5000|$|To {{have lots}} of boiled rice, pilau rice, lemon rice, and coconut rice from an Indian takeaway. As soon as Lou puts all the rice on the plate Andy says [...] "I don't like rice". Lou then {{proceeds}} <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> his head <b>against</b> the wall, out of Andy's sight in annoyance. (Series 3 deleted scene) ...|$|R
50|$|Otani was well-regarded for his decorous {{behaviour}} in challenge matches, {{earning the}} nickname Kunshi no ken, the Gentleman's Sword. He {{was known to}} allow opponents <b>to</b> score <b>hits</b> <b>against</b> him on purpose. He would often engage in multiple matches against challengers, allowing himself to be defeated in the first engagement so as to gauge his opponent's response to an easy victory. A repeat match would then see Otani trounce the challenger with ease. This tactic worked to great effect in securing the discipleship of Shimada Toranosuke, who {{would become one of}} Otani's most noted students. He also taught Sakakibara Kenkichi.|$|R
50|$|The actual {{process of}} 'goaling' a ball {{requires}} a player <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> it <b>against</b> the millstone three successive times. This {{is not a}} purely random event, however, as the eventual scorer is elected {{en route to the}} goal and would typically be someone who lives in Ashbourne or at least whose family is well known to the community. The chances of a 'tourist' goaling a ball are very remote, though they are welcome to join in the effort to reach the goal. When a ball is 'goaled' that particular game ends.|$|R
500|$|Warren Spahn {{pitched the}} ball which Gil Hodges hit {{for the first}} of his four, the only Hall of Fame pitcher faced during a four-home-run game. [...] Hodges, Adcock, and Martinez are the only players <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> home runs <b>against</b> four {{different}} pitchers in one game. Lowe and Delahanty, on the other hand, are the only players <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> four home runs in one game against just one pitcher: Ice Box Chamberlain and Adonis Terry, respectively.|$|R
50|$|Standard play {{includes}} five components. In {{this game}} play, players line {{up next to}} each other along the Spikeball net, with the opposing team lined up directly across from them along the Spikeball net. The object of the game is <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> the ball <b>against</b> the net so that the other team is not able to return it, or return it <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> the Spikeball net. The play continues until the ball is not returned properly.|$|R
6000|$|... 'There are {{different}} ways of understanding such a denial as this,' said Philip. 'See, he says {{not in the way}} in which I suppose.' He held up his hand authoritatively, as his aunt was about <b>to</b> interpose. <b>'It</b> was <b>against</b> gaming that his vow was made. I never thought he had played, but he never says he has not betted.' ...|$|R
50|$|As 1938 {{came to an}} end, the war in Europe {{heated to}} its boiling point. At this point, European {{aircraft}} had greatly surpassed US designs. The two top USAAC fighters, the Seversky P-35 and the Curtiss P-36A, were just able <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> 300 mph. <b>Against</b> the 340+ mph Messerschmitt Bf 109 they would be completely outclassed. The twin-engined Lockheed XP-38 was entering an extended test program.|$|R
50|$|The {{strategy}} of indoor cricket differs from its outdoor cousin {{because of the}} different scoring system. The quickest way to score runs is <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> a boundary <b>against</b> the back wall and score 4 or 6 runs. In order to prevent this, the two best fielders from the fielding side are generally positioned {{in front of this}} wall in order to prevent the ball from reaching it.|$|R
5000|$|In March 2015, Coke {{signed a}} minor league {{contract}} with the Chicago Cubs, receiving a non-roster invitation to spring training. Coke earned a $2.25 million salary upon making the team. Coke had a 6.30 ERA in 16 appearances, allowing left-handed batters <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> [...]304 (7-for-23) <b>against</b> him. He was designated for assignment by the Cubs on May 18, and released by the club on May 26.|$|R
40|$|I {{can see how}} it {{is tempting}} for an Israeli {{opponent}} of the occupation, who spends his life fighting the exclusive nationalism of Israeli governments, to seize a rhetorical opportunity <b>to</b> score some <b>hits</b> <b>against</b> an Israeli government. But Uri Ram should widen his horizons and should understand that the boycott campaign threatened British Jews – students, activists, lecturers – and it threatened leftist and liberal political culture in Britain - before it came anywhere near to hurting Israelis...|$|R
5000|$|Hit Stix is a toy {{electronic}} {{musical instrument}} manufactured by Nasta and Radio Shack in the 1980s. A set of Hit Stix consists of 2 drum sticks which are tethered {{to a small}} amplifier by audio cables. When the drum sticks are thrust forward in mid air, mimicking actual drum playing, a snare drum sound effect is produced. A rapid succession of thrusts produces a drum roll. It is a common misconception that Hit Stix are meant <b>to</b> be <b>hit</b> <b>against</b> another surface. In fact, the sounds are produced simply by the motion of drumming and {{do not need to}} come in contact with any surface in order to produce a sound.|$|R

She {{finished}} the year with 375 kills on [...]492 hitting percentage, a percentage which ranks among the top five in NCAA history and also ranked first in the conference and second nationally. She had 200 blocks on the year and averaged 1.65 blocks per game, which tied for fifth in the nation and was second on the team. She equaled her career high of 17 kills with no errors <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> [...]444 <b>against</b> Wisconsin. She helped her squad to a 20-0 Big Ten record and a 34-2 record overall.|$|R
50|$|On September 2, 1960, Lee {{surrendered}} a {{home run}} to Ted Williams {{in the first game}} of a doubleheader between the Senators and Boston Red Sox. 21 years before, in his rookie season, Williams hit {{a home run}} off Don's father Thornton Lee, then with the Chicago White Sox, on September 17, 1939. With this feat, Williams became the only player in major league history <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> home runs <b>against</b> a father and son.|$|R
