5|$|The vimana {{of their}} temples (tower over the shrine) is a {{compromise}} in detail between the plain stepped {{style of the}} early Chalukyas and the decorative finish of the Hoysalas. <b>To</b> <b>the</b> <b>credit</b> of the Western Chalukya architects {{is the development of}} the lathe turned (tuned) pillars and use of Soapstone (Chloritic Schist) as basic building and sculptural material, a very popular idiom in later Hoysala temples. They popularised the use of decorative Kirtimukha (demon faces) in their sculptures. Famous architects in the Hoysala kingdom included Chalukyan architects who were natives of places such as Balligavi. The artistic wall decor and the general sculptural idiom was dravidian architecture. This style is sometimes called Karnata dravida, one of the notable traditions in Indian architecture.|$|E
5|$|In 1825, Jones wrote {{a letter}} to Indian Agent James Givins {{regarding}} the year's delivery of gifts (due from various land purchases) to the Mississaugas. The letter was the first Givins had received that had been written by an Indian. Givins arranged a meeting with Jones during the second week of July. Jones arrived at the Humber River at the prescribed time, leading the approximately 50 Christian Indians, and his former adoptive father Captain Jim arrived leading the approximately 150 non-Christian Indians. At this meeting, a further 50 of the approximately 200 Indians of Jones' band were converted. Givins was accompanied by several members of Upper Canada's aristocracy, including Bishop John Strachan. The Christian dress and style of Jones' band of converts, including their singing of hymns, which had been translated into Ojibwe by Jones, created a favourable impression of the group with Strachan and the other political leaders present. Although Strachan, an Anglican, had strongly denounced the Methodists, he saw in Jones the opportunity to Christianize the Indians of Upper Canada. He hoped to convert Jones (and thereby his followers) to Anglicanism later. The Crown had previously agreed to build a village on the Credit River for the Mississaugas in 1820, but nothing had been done. Strachan told Jones he would make good on this agreement, and after a short meeting, all of the Christian Indians agreed to accept it. Construction of the settlement, called the Credit Mission, was soon underway and Jones moved there in 1826. By the summer of 1826, with construction of the settlement well under way, the rest of the band had joined the Methodist church and settled at the Credit Mission. Among the last holdouts was Jones' former adoptive father, Captain Jim, and his family. At about this time Methodist Reverend Egerton Ryerson was assigned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Credit</b> Mission, and Jones quickly struck up a friendship with him. Ryerson's work at the camp freed Jones to begin taking lengthy missionary expeditions to other parts of Upper Canada. During the period 182527, Jones undertook missionary missions to Quinte, Munceytown, Rice Lake and Lake Simcoe. He preached in the native language, a key factor to helping the Indians understand and accept Christianity; small groups of Indians in these areas soon converted to Christianity.|$|E

25|$|In the meantime, Supachai {{was convicted}} and jailed, but more charges of {{embezzlement}} and fraud were still under investigation.

The department then investigated two charges: conspiring to launder money and receiving stolen goods. The charges were laid by an affected client of the credit union, who felt the money the temple returned had too many strings attached. The temple denied the charges of the department, stating that donations were received in the open in public, and that Supachai had only donated cheques, no cash. They further explained that the temple had a department for financial matters, in which Supachai had no part, and accused the DSI of violating double jeopardy principles.|$|E

25|$|The {{first home}} {{game of the}} 2008–09 season, at 3pm on a Saturday, saw the lowest-ever Premier League {{attendance}} at the expanded ground, of 47,711, resulting in cash turnstiles.

This was followed by an attendance of 44,935 on 27 September in a league fixture against Blackburn Rovers, which followed a record low attendance of 20,577 on Wednesday, 24 September in a League Cup fixture, the lowest ever attendance for a competitive first-team match since the 1993 promotion to the top flight, and a drop of over 4,000 from previous lows.|$|E

500|$|Returning <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Credit</b> Mission, Jones {{believed}} {{the most pressing}} issue for the Mississaugas was their lack of a clear title to their land. [...] The settlement had established successful farms, and was almost self-sufficient. [...] It was also developing industry, {{with a pair of}} carpenters and a shoemaker. [...] The Credit Mission Mississaugas had also funded the construction of a pair of piers {{at the mouth of the}} Credit River, the beginning of Port Credit. [...] Although the settlement was prospering, Indian Superintendent Thomas G. Anderson pressured to band to move off the Credit Mission to a different location, hoping to group Indians into larger settlements where schools could be reasonably established and funded. [...] As an inducement to motivate the Mississaugas to move, he promised them the title deeds which were Jones' main goal for the band. [...] The Saugeen Ojibwa invited the Credit Mississaugas to move to the Bruce Peninsula, which was the last large piece of unceded land in southern Ontario. [...] The Credit Mississaugas believed this to be their best chance to obtain deeds to land, and so the band prepared for a move. [...] They turned the Credit lands over to the province in trust, but the first survey of the Bruce returned with terrible news: The soil of the Bruce Peninsula was completely unsuitable for farming. [...] Having already surrendered their land at the Credit Mission, the Mississaugas faced an uncertain situation. [...] The Six Nations, hearing of the Mississaugas' desperate situation offered a portion of their tract <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Credit</b> Mississaugas, remembering that when the Six Nations had fled to Upper Canada the Mississaugas had donated the land the Six Nations. [...] The Mississaugas relocated to this land along the Grand River that was donated by the Six Nations. [...] Founded in 1847, the settlement was named New Credit. Jones would continue in his role as a community leader here, petitioning various branches of government for funding to build the settlement. [...] In 1848, the Wesleyans and Methodists reconciled, and William Ryerson established a mission in New Credit.|$|E
