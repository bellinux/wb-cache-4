40|$|Baoshan Iron & Steel {{operates}} {{a fleet of}} seventy (70) 320 tonne <b>torpedo</b> <b>cars.</b> During liquid iron transportation, they experience significant heat loss through their refractory linings. Therefore, a layer of high strength insulating material behind a safety lining was considered. This paper summarizes a study evaluating the thermal behavior of the refractory lining with and without this insulating layer. A finite-element thermal analysis was conducted, with representative modeling of material properties and processing conditions. It covered the main process steps, including the charging at the blast furnace, the residence time, the different treatments, emptying at the BOF shop, and idling time. The benefits of using the insulation layer, in terms of heat conservation, lower shell temperatures, the improvement of liquid iron temperatures, and better heat-flow regulation, are quantified...|$|R

40|$|Abstract-The {{scheduling}} for {{molten iron}} logistic optimization {{is to determine}} the distribution of molten iron from iron-making stage to steelmaking stage, the transportation routes of torpedo cars and locomotives such that the molten iron from blast furnaces can be delivered to the steelmaking shops on schedule and on quality. By taking the molten iron transportation process of an iron and steel enterprise as research background, the paper investigated the <b>torpedo</b> <b>car</b> scheduling problem, which is a key problem in the molten iron logistics optimization and developed a mixed integer programming model. The model was then solved by commercial optimization software CPLEX to obtain the <b>torpedo</b> <b>car</b> scheduling scheme. Meanwhile, another scheduling scheme was obtained by a heuristics based on the nearest neighborhood idea in which the earliest available <b>torpedo</b> <b>car</b> is used to service the un-serviced task whose tapping time is the earliest. Two schemes were compared to validate the efficacy and reasonability of the model. Keywords-torpedo car scheduling; mixed integer programming; heuristics; the nearest neighbourhood I...|$|E

40|$|Iron 2 ̆ 6 {{steel making}} {{companies}} operate torpedo cars {{which are used}} to deliver liquid iron from blast furnace. Then the liquid iron is processed by the basic oxygen furnace in the steel making workshop. The desulfurization is performed during the liquid iron delivery process by injecting desulphurization agents into the liquid iron with nitrogen as the carrier gas. ^ As a transport equipment of liquid iron, <b>torpedo</b> <b>car,</b> compared with the previous liquid iron tank, has the advantages of small temperature decrease and little iron loss. It is gradually replacing the liquid iron tank and becomes the main means of liquid iron transport. The producing process shows that: slightly temperature reduce of the steelmaking liquid iron will cause {{a substantial increase in}} energy consumption in steelmaking and continuous casting. ^ In this paper, the temperature field and heat flux field of the tank and its shell in a 300 ton <b>torpedo</b> <b>car</b> were analyzed using ANSYS analysis software. In the thermal analysis, the nonlinear changes of physical parameters of temperature, radiation and other nonlinear factors were taken fully account when the nonlinear finite element simulation of the temperature field and heat flux field was conducted. The temperature distribution of the refractory layers, the heat flux distribution of the tank shell and the hot metal temperature drop were determined according to the initial temperature of the molten iron, the ambient temperature and the parametric study of the thermal properties of different refractory materials. ^ The results can be useful guidance for the future design of torpedo cars in iron and steel making plants. ...|$|E
40|$|A <b>torpedo</b> <b>car</b> is an {{elongated}} cylindrical vessel, which {{is widely used}} in steel plants to transfer liquid iron from the blast furnace to the melt shop and perform desulfurization process. Removing the sulfur contained in pig iron {{is very important to}} meet the stringent quality criteria required in the downstream processes. The desulfurization process is performed in a torpedo vessel during the transportation by injecting desulfurizing reagents into the liquid iron with nitrogen as the carrier gas. An optimization of this process is desired to improve the desulfurization efficiency. In this study, a 3 -D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model has been developed to analyze the flow field in the liquid iron bath inside a torpedo vessel. Parametric studies were conducted to assess the opportunities to improve the efficiency of the desulfurization process. ...|$|E

In retrospect the car {{can be seen as}} Peugeot’s first <b>Torpedo</b> bodied <b>car,</b> although the classification is anachronistic since the term “Torpedo” to describe a car body was coined only in 1908. Buyers opting for the larger engined Type 68C had the chance to specify a racing car body.|$|R

40|$|Modern {{process lines}} {{give rise to}} huge amounts of data which are stored in databases. Multivariate {{analysis}} comprises useful tools to grasp useful information from the datasets. In the present study principal component analysis (PCA), projection to latent structures (PLS) and hierarchical PCA {{has been used to}} create models of five process steps at a Swedish steelworks. The focus has been to identify and explain relations to quality problems in each step, both within the step itself, but also from upstream processes using hierarchical PCA. The five process steps that have been modelled are the blast furnace, desulphurization in the <b>torpedo</b> <b>car,</b> basic oxygen steelmaking in the LD–LBE-converter, secondary steelmaking in ladle and ladle furnace and, finally, continuous casting of slabs. Among the results achieved it is found that: PLS prediction of crude iron analysis from blast furnace discharge has been made with a fraction of explained variance for external validation (Q 2 PS) above 20 % for P, Cr, Cu, Ti, CaO, SiO 2, MgO and basicity. The data resolution was relatively low. Hierarchical modelling revealed correlations between the process steps, e. g. that LD-converter treatments registered as severe slopping heats have a titanium content in the incoming crude iron that is higher than average. Heats with too high phosphorous content after LD-treatment can be identified as having low silicon content in the crude iron, which makes it impossible to create the necessary slag amount for desired phosphorous cleaning effect. High sulphur content in the <b>torpedo</b> <b>car</b> demands a long treatment time. If the silicon content is low in such a batch, there is an evident risk that it will not have high enough temperature in the secondary steelmaking. Capturing reasons for quality problems during casting is difficult due to the low variation in data. The main variations exist between the steel qualities. However, the importance of casting properties such as oscillations for visual quality of the slabs, and temperature and steel analysis for slab inner quality have been recognized...|$|E

40|$|Abstract To {{inspect the}} {{refractory}} of <b>torpedo</b> ladle <b>car</b> at high temperature {{is effective in}} expanding its service life and reducing its maintenance cost, preventing metal break out. As to metal impact area, the refractory thickness could not be inspected by thermal analysis of outer steel shell. The refractory thickness meter was installed at torpedo repair shop for evaluating its measurement stability and refractory thickness measurement accuracy. It has two surface profile maters using laser rangefinder equipped with two tilt stages, facing each other. It measures the inner refractory profile and the outer steel shell profile at one time to calculate the accurate refractory thickness without influence {{of the outer shell}} deformation. After 90 minutes from discharging molten iron, it could achieve stable measurement without the influence of fume and heat haze, and could measure the refractory thickness with a good accuracy of 7. 3 mm (1 sigma) ...|$|R
50|$|Similar to its predecessors, Battlefield 1 is a first-person shooter {{game that}} {{emphasizes}} teamwork. It {{is set in}} the period of World War I, and is inspired by historical events. Players can make use of World War I weapons, including bolt-action rifles, automatic and semi-automatic rifles, artillery, flamethrowers, and mustard gas to combat opponents. Melee combat was reworked, with DICE introducing new melee weapons such as sabres, trench clubs, and shovels into the game. These melee weapons were divided into three groups: heavy, medium and light. Players can also take control of various armored vehicles, including light and heavy tanks, armored trucks, <b>cars,</b> <b>torpedo</b> boats, biplane aircraft, an armored train, Reconnaissance vehicles, a Dreadnought and an LZ 30 Airship, as well as ride horses into battle. Destructible environments and weapon customization, features present in the previous games, returned in Battlefield 1 and are more dynamic.|$|R
5000|$|The Inter Autoscooter is a French {{three-wheeled}} microcar {{that first}} {{appeared at the}} 1953 Paris Salon. Some say it was produced {{to compete with the}} Messerschmitt KR175 which also appeared that year. This is not surprising as both cars were built by aircraft companies and shared a similar cockpit and tandem seating layout. The Inter was produced by SNCAN in their aircraft factory at Villeurbanne in the region of Lyon; Just over 300 units were built between 1954 and 1956. Early advertising literature reveals that two models were offered, one with a cockpit cover that hinged open from the side and named the Berline, the other an open bodied version called the <b>Torpedo.</b> Both <b>cars</b> were powered by a small Ydral 175cc two-stroke engine driving the single rear wheel. The Inter had some unusual features not least being its ability to fold together its two front half axles so as to facilitate easy storage, however this feature only appears on the first few cars made as it proved to be impractical and was soon discontinued. The Inter also featured a device called a gyrostarter, this was in effect a kind of electric kick start made by the American electromechanical giant WestinghouseThe device consists of a built in electric 6 volt motor with a clutched flywheel, the momentum of the rotating flywheel is transferred to the engine by means of its clutch once it has built up sufficient speed, it sounds much like a helicopter preparing for take off! The device switches to being a generator once the engine is running. Considering the very small production run, approximately 38 vehicles survive in the hands of museums and collectors, of which only a few are still in running condition.|$|R
