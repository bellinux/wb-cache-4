Data errors caused by noise induction along the cable are completely eliminated. The operation of the complete interface and its routine testing are described. The cable transmission of data from a scintilla tion camera to a digital computer over long distances presents problems. The major one is the induction of noise {{along the length of}} the cable, thereby causing data errors (1). Dowsett and Roberts (2) have suc ceeded in transmitting analog signals over 1, 450 ft. However, their approach is expensive: it requires high-quality amplifiers and coaxial cable and does not completely eliminate the possibility of induced noise. More recentlyGrant et ai (3) successfullytrans mitted digital signals over 450 ft. Their approach eliminates induced noise and the need for high quality amplifiers, but it also is expensive because it uses shielded <b>twin</b> <b>coaxial</b> cable.

40|$|The merit, {{in terms}} of its {{efficiency}} and performance, of the <b>twin,</b> contrarotating <b>coaxial</b> rotor configuration over the more conventional single rotor system has long been a point of contention. Previously published comparisons yield seemingly inconsistent and conflicting conclusions. In this paper, the basis for a fair, like-for-like comparison of the performance of coaxial and single rotor systems is discussed. A comparison between experimentally measured data and numerical predictions of rotor performance obtained using the vorticity transport model shows that a computational approach can be used reliably to decompose the power consumption into induced and profile constituents. These comparisons show that a somewhat stronger similarity in geometry needs to be enforced between the two types of rotor system than previously suggested in order that the systems be directly comparable. If the equivalent single rotor system is constructed to have the same disk area, blade geometry, and total number of blades as that of the coaxial rotor, then the geometric differences between the two systems are confined to the defining characteristics of the two types of rotor system, in other words to the vertical separation between the rotor blades and their relative direction of rotation. The differences in aerodynamic performance between a coaxial rotor and an equivalent single rotor defined in this way then arise solely {{as a result of the}} differences in the detailed interaction between the blades and their wakes that arise within the two types of system. Using this form of comparison, the articulated coaxial system is shown to consume marginally less induced power than the equivalent single rotor system. The difference is small enough, however, to be obscured if the profile drag of the blades is overtly sensitive to operating condition, as for instance might be the case at low Reynolds number...|$|R
40|$|The {{acoustic}} {{characteristics of}} a <b>twin</b> contra-rotating <b>coaxial</b> rotor configuration with significant flapwise stiffness are investigated in steady forward flight. The Vorticity Transport Model is used to simulate the aerodynamics of the rotor system and the acoustic field is determined using the Ffowcs Williams-Hawkings equation implemented using the Farassat- 1 A formulation. Increasing the hub stiffness alters {{the strengths of the}} blade vortex interactions, particularly those between the upper and lower rotors, and affects the intensity and directivity of the blade vortex interaction noise produced by the system. The inter-rotor blade vortex interaction on the advancing side of the lower rotor is the principal source of the most intensively focused noise that is generated by a conventionally articulated coaxial rotor system. For stiffened coaxial rotors, this particular inter-rotor blade vortex interaction is weakened {{as a result of a}} broad redistribution in lateral loading, yielding a reduction in the intensity of the noise that is produced by this interaction. The spanwise distribution of loading on the rotors of a stiffened coaxial system can be modified further by altering the lateral partition of lift (or lift offset). It is shown that decreasing the lift offset has the effect of counteracting the redistribution of loading due to flapwise stiffness and hence increases the blade vortex interaction noise as well as the power consumed by the rotor. Conversely, a reduction in both the power consumption and the blade vortex interaction noise is observed if the lift offset is increased, with the maximum benefit of lift offset being achieved at high speed. The computational results suggest that the noise from the dominant inter-rotor blade vortex interaction can be ameliorated through the use of lift offset control on stiffened coaxial systems, to the extent that the noise produced by this interaction can be made to be comparable to that produced by the other, weaker interactions between the two rotors of the syste...|$|R
40|$|Brewers {{spent grain}} (BSG) {{is a widely}} {{available}} feedstock representing approximately 85 % of the total by-products generated in the brewing industry. This is currently either disposed of to landfill or used as cattle feed due to its high protein content. BSG has received little or no attention as a potential energy resource, but increasing disposal costs and environmental constraints are now prompting the consideration of this. One possibility for the utilisation of BSG for energy is via intermediate pyrolysis to produce gases, vapours and chars. Intermediate pyrolysis is characterised by indirect heating {{in the absence of}} oxygen for short solids residence times of a few minutes, at temperatures of 350 - 450 °C. In the present work BSG has been characterised by chemical, proximate, ultimate and thermo-gravimetric analysis. Intermediate pyrolysis of BSG at 450 °C was carried out using a <b>twin</b> <b>coaxial</b> screw reactor known as Pyroformer to give yields of char 29 %, 51 % of bio-oil and 19 % of permanent gases. The bio-oil liquid was found to separate in to an aqueous phase and organic phase. The organic phase contained viscous compounds that could age over time leading to solid tars that can present problems in CHP application. The quality of the pyrolysis vapour products before quenching can be upgraded to achieve much improved suitability as a fuel by downstream catalytic reforming. A Bench Scale batch pyrolysis reactor has then been used to pyrolyse small samples of BSG under a range of conditions of heating rate and temperature simulating the Pyroformer. A small catalytic reformer has been added downstream of the reactor in which the pyrolysis vapours can be further cracked and reformed. A commercial reforming nickel catalyst was used at 500, 750 and 850 °C at a space velocity about 10, 000 L/h with and without the addition of steam. Results are presented for the properties of BSG, and the products of the pyrolysis process both with and without catalytic post-processing. Results indicate that catalytic reforming produced a significant increase in permanent gases mainly (H 2 and CO) with H 2 content exceeding 50 vol% at higher reforming temperatures. Bio-oil yield decreased significantly as reforming temperature increased with char remaining the same as pyrolysis condition remained unchanged. The process shows an increase in heating value for the product gas ranging between 10. 8 - 25. 2 MJ/m as reforming temperature increased...|$|E

This thesis presents designs for such robots and formulates principles {{for the design of}} similar robots. The design discussed herein is based on a two-wheeled ground robot.

While the design principles were developed as a result of work on this robot, they are nevertheless applicable to other hybrid-locomotion robots utilizing a rotary-wing flight mode, regardless of the form they take. A predecessor utilized <b>twin</b> <b>coaxial</b> rotors, while the novel V 2 design presented here is equipped with one main rotor and a tail rotor. Both designs use a set of arms, hinged near one side of the robot, to push on the ground, creating a moment about one of the wheels and lifting the other off the ground, ultimately positioning the robot's long axis vertically. Mechanisms for engaging drivetrains, folding/unfolding rotors, and unfolding a tail with a tail rotor (in the V 2 design only), complete the transformation; the orientation-adjusting arms then serve as landing gear for the flight mode. Performance of the novel design improves upon the predecessor, but still leaves much to be desired. With a top speed of 0. 3 m/s on flat terrain, a climbing capability of 19 mm, and a lifetime of up to 2. 5 hours on the ground, terrestrial performance is satisfactory. The flight mode has not been successfully demonstrated, but related testing shows that battery life in flight would be less than 5 minutes. Such performance metrics lead to the primary design principle: hybrid-locomotion robots with rotary-wing flight modes should have ground-focused designs to enable the terrestrial navigation of all expected environments. Such designs will reserve the flight mode for only unexpected obstacles or terrain, while spending the majority of their time in the much more energy-efficient ground mode. Four other principles have been formulated:Parts should perform as many functions as possible to minimize the quantity and weight of components. Drive systems for the two locomotion modes should be separate due to widely disparate requirements. The robot's flight hardware will always be much larger than is practical in the ground mode in environments of reasonable complexity, and thus the robot should collapse to a smaller size in the ground mode. The robot's flight mode components must be protected from the environment while in the ground mode. With design principles formulated, design changes can be explored. Impact tolerance of any meaningful amount proves to be infeasible due to the structural requirements of impact-tolerant components. Scaling the designs up is feasible, but significantly reduces the utility of the robot in cluttered and indoor environments. Scaling the designs down is largely impractical due to lack of actuator availability and the complexity of the design. Also, it would render the robot largely useless in outdoor environments, as terrain would be difficult in the ground mode, and wind makes flight at such scales infeasible. Alternate rotor configurations are possible, and a quad-rotor system may be superior to the designs discussed herein. The work in this thesis represents a first step - a proof of concept. Useful robots will require significantly more mechanical work. In addition, development would be required in both electronics and controls, and the robots could benefit greatly from the development of autonomous behaviors. The results to date have certainly been promising and merit further work...|$|E
40|$|Chapter 1 : Apparent {{divergence}} of thrusting directions horth {{and south}} of the Pelvoux massif: implications for the evolution of the Western Alpine Arc: In the Western Alps, the Penninic Basal Contact (PBC, Ceriani et al. 2001) defines the tectonic boundary between the external Dauphinois domain and the interanl Penninic units. During the Eocene, the PBC corresponds to the suture between Dauphinois and Subriançonnais/Briançonnais domains related to the subduction of the Valais ocean (Ceriani et al. 2001). In the Oligo-Miocene, i. e. during a second and post-collisional stage, Eocene structures were passively transported towards the WNE along a major out-of-sequence thrust, the Roselend thrust (RT), partially coinciding with and reactivating the PBC. Structural analysis of key outcrops combined with microfabric investigations of calcyte ultramylonites allowed to trace the southern continuation of the RT in a broad shear zone at the rim of the Pelvoux massif and further south along the Briançonnais front (Tricart 1980) {{at the rear of the}} Embrunais Ubaye nappe stack. The RT finally branches into a sinistral strike slip zone NE of the Argentera massif. The area south of the Pelvoux massif is additionally characterized by SW-directed thrusting, a feature totally absent north of it. Detailed investigations of outcrops found along strike of the RT, the basal decollement of both Dauphinois para-autochthonous Tertiary cover and Helmenthoid Flysch of the Embrunais Ubaye nappe stack reveal that top-SW thrusting is a younger (i. e. D 2) event, overprinting earlier features linked to D 1 WNW-directed displacements. The youngest deformation event found in the area (D 3) is consistent with normal faulting along the Durance system. On a larger scale, it is concluded that the whole Adriatic indenter was thrusted onto the European plate along the RT during Oligo-Miocene times. Activity along this structure is linked to dextral movements along the Rhone-Simplon line and sinistral movements at the rear of the Argentera massif. Additionally, it is proposed that the onset of D 3 SW-directed movements finds its origin in the opening of the western Mediterranean basin and the foramtion of the Appenine chain in middle Miocene times. Chapter 2 : Microfabrics of calcite ultramylonites recording coaxial and non-coaxial deformation kinematics: examples from the Rocher de l'Yret shear zone (Western Alps) : Microfabrics were analysed in calcite mylonites from the rim of the Pelvoux massif (Western Alps, France). WNW-directed emplacement of the internal Penninic units onto the Dauphinois domain has lead to intense deformation of an Eocene-age nummulitic limestone under lower anchizone metamorphic conditions (slightly below 300 °C). Two types of microfabrics developed during deformation under coaxial or non-coaxial kinematics, respectively, primarily by dislocation creep accompanied by dynamic recrystallization in the absence of <b>twinning.</b> <b>Coaxial</b> kinematics are inferred for samples exhibiting grain shape fabrics and textures with orthorhombic symmetry. Their texture is characterized by two c-axis maxima at the periphery of the pole figure, symmetrically oriented at 15 ° from the normal to the macroscopic foliation. Non-coaxial deformation is evident in samples with monoclinic shape fabrics and textures characterized by a single oblique c-axis maximum tilted with the sense of shear by about 15 °. From the analysis of suitably oriented slip systems for the main texture components under given kinematics it is inferred that the orthorhombic textures developed in coaxial kinematics fabour activity of and slip along the f- and r-planes, respectively, with minor contributions of basal slip. In contrast, the monoclinic textures developed during simple shear are most suited for duplex slip along the basal plane. The transition between orthorhombic and monoclinic microfabrics is interpreted to be due to the effects of dynamic recrystallization upon texture development. Calcite textures alone should not be used as unequivocal shear sense indicators, but need to be complemented by microstructural criteria such as shape preferred orientations, grain size estimates and amount of twinning. Chatper 3 : Microfabric analysis of calcitic marbles from the area investigated in the Western Alps and the Gavernie basal contact (Central Pyrenees) : In the previous chapter, a model of microfabric evolution of calcite ultramylonites, plastically deformed at temperatures lower than 350 °C, has been presented. The very specific setting of the outcrop investigated in great details at the "Rocher de l'Yret" shear zone (RYSZ) allowed for the recognition of both coaxial and non-coaxial deformation kinematics. The samples deformed with a dominant component of rotational deformation show a c-axis distribution tilted synthetically with the sense of shear. In the absence of twinning, this feature, commonly observed for quartz tectonites, can be used as a reliable shear sense indicator. Additionally, the model allows for the recognition of incipient rotational deformation in the bulk flow accommodated in the rock. The structural data presented in chapter 1 will now be completed by means of a microfabric analysis of a series of calcitic marbles, found in abundance in the investigated area. The results of investigations on calcite ultramylonites found along the Roselend Thrust (RT) are presented first. four localities along the RT have been investigated between the eastern rim of the Pelvoux massif in the North and the rear of the Argntera massif in the South (sites BFY, Laux, Reot and Arg in fig 3. 1). This study aims to 1) independently confirm the overall WNW-directed sense of transport along the RT, 2) deduce the type of strain along this structure and its possible variations using the model of microfabric evolution presented in chapter 2. In a second step, the basal decollement of the Dauphinois parautochthonous cover from the southeastern rim of the Pelvoux massif will be investigated. Such decollement occurred within the nummulitic limestone layer intensively mylonitised in the Dormillouse valley (site Dorm, see fig. 3. 1 and 3. 2). This study confirms the overall top-SW overprinting deformation recorded in this domain and documents important bulk flow partionning within the basal decollement level of the Eocene stratigrahpic series. Finally the restults of investigations on samples from the Gavernie thrust from the central Pyrenees (courtesy J. H. P. de Bresser) will be presented (see fig. 3. 37). The restults are in accordance with the overall top-S directed emplacement of the Gavernie nappe during Pyrenean orogeny and give evidence for strain variations within the shear zone developed along the Gavarnie basal thrust. pas de résum...|$|R
