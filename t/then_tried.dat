5|$|During this time, Stuart's {{execution}} {{had been}} delayed on multiple occasions. On 6 July, Playford and the Executive Council {{decided not to}} reprieve Stuart, and he was due to be executed the next day, but {{an appeal to the}} Privy Council in London stalled proceedings again. However, this also failed. Labor <b>then</b> <b>tried</b> to introduce legislation to stall the hanging.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, the anti-Swedish {{alliance}} had deployed an army to Denmark, {{to confront}} Charles X Gustav {{with a force}} of 14,500 Brandenburgers commanded by Frederick William, 10,600 Austrians commanded by Raimondo Montecuccoli, and 4,500 Poles commanded by Czarniecki. By January 1659, the allied forces stood at Fredriksodde, Kolding and Als. Charles X Gustav <b>then</b> <b>tried</b> a decisive assault on Copenhagen on 21 and 22 February, but was repelled.|$|E
5|$|Spedding and Wilhelm {{began looking}} for ways to create the uranium metal. At the time, it was {{produced}} {{in the form of a}} powder, and was highly pyrophoric. It could be pressed and sintered and stored in cans, but to be useful, it needed to be melted and cast. Casting presented difficulty because uranium corroded crucibles of beryllium, magnesia and graphite. To produce uranium metal, they tried reducing uranium oxide with hydrogen, but this did not work. While most of the neighboring elements on the periodic table can be reduced to form pure metal and slag, uranium did not behave this way. In June 1942 they <b>then</b> <b>tried</b> reducing the uranium with carbon in a hydrogen atmosphere, with only moderate success. They <b>then</b> <b>tried</b> aluminum, magnesium and calcium, all of which were unsuccessful. The following month the Ames team found that molten uranium could be cast in a graphite container. Although graphite was known to react with uranium, this could be managed because the carbide formed only where the two touched.|$|E
5|$|The Swedish army {{surrounded}} Copenhagen, {{hoping to}} starve it into submission. This failed when the Dutch Republic joined the conflict on the Danish {{side and a}} reinforcing fleet managed to smash {{its way through the}} Swedish naval forces in Øresund. Charles <b>then</b> <b>tried</b> a decisive assault on the city, hoping to conquer it and win the war; this plan likewise failed. Brandenburg, Poland and Austria then also joined the war against the Swedes.|$|E

The following week, Carlito was defeated by Cena.|$|E
5|$|Barrett {{told the}} men to load their weapons but not to fire unless fired upon, and then ordered them to advance. Laurie ordered the British {{companies}} guarding the bridge to retreat across it. One officer <b>then</b> <b>tried</b> to pull up the loose planks of the bridge to impede the colonial advance, but Major Buttrick began to yell at the regulars to stop harming the bridge. The Minutemen and militia from Concord, Acton {{and a handful of}} Westford Minutemen, advanced in column formation, two by two, led by Major Buttrick, Lt. Col. Robinson, then Capt. Davis, on the light infantry, keeping to the road, since it was surrounded by the spring floodwaters of the Concord River.|$|E
5|$|Britain's {{successes in}} the Seven Years' War {{had left it}} with {{expensive}} commitments in the Americas {{that had to be}} paid for and had catalysed the formation of an anti-British coalition in Europe. The British Government's attempt to levy new taxes on the Thirteen Colonies of British America led to the outbreak of the American War of Independence in 1776. Spain declared war on Britain and started the Anglo-Spanish War and <b>then</b> <b>tried</b> to recover Gibraltar with French aid.|$|E

5|$|During his youth, Olajuwon was {{a soccer}} goalkeeper, which helped {{give him the}} {{footwork}} and agility to balance his size and strength in basketball, and also contributed to his shot-blocking ability. Olajuwon did not play basketball {{until the age of}} 17, when he entered a local tournament. It has been said that a coach in Nigeria once asked him to dunk and demonstrated while standing on a chair. Olajuwon <b>then</b> <b>tried</b> to stand on the chair himself. When redirected by staff not to use the chair, Hakeem could initially not dunk the basketball.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} two weeks, the outnumbered Berryforce {{attempted}} to retake the strategically important town in the Battle of Merdjayoun. His first attempt was a failure. After carrying out a personal reconnaissance on 18 June, Berryman tried again. This time his attack was halted by staunch defence by the French Foreign Legion and tanks. Berryman <b>then</b> <b>tried</b> a different approach. Instead of attempting to capture the town, he seized high ground overlooking the French supply lines. Faced with being cut off, the French withdrew from the town. Berryforce was then dissolved and Berryman returned to his role as commander of the 7th Division artillery.|$|E

After Lhermitte killed her children, she <b>then</b> <b>tried</b> to kill herself. The suicide attempt failed, and Lhermitte {{was taken into custody}} and charged with first-degree murder. She was subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment.|$|E

5|$|In 1945, {{after the}} Soviets drove the Germans out of Poland, Dangić was {{captured}} by the Red Army and extradited to Yugoslavia's new Communist authorities.

He was executed by firing squad on 22 August 1947. According to the indictment against Mihailović and others, Dangić was awarded the Order of the Star of Karađorđe by the Yugoslav government-in-exile {{on the recommendation of}} Mihailović.|$|E
5|$|The first flames {{were spotted}} at 6:00pm, {{under the door}} of the House of Lords, by the wife of one of the doorkeepers; she entered the chamber to see Black Rod's box alight, and flames burning the {{curtains}} and wood panels, and raised the alarm.

5|$|The {{following}} {{match was}} between Rey Mysterio and Eddie Guerrero, where the stipulation {{was that if}} Guerrero won the match, he would reveal the secret he has been hiding from the public that neither Mysterio's nor Guerrero's families wanted revealed. If Mysterio won, however, Guerrero would not reveal the secret. Guerrero executed the Three Amigos on Mysterio and performed a frog splash. Guerrero <b>then</b> <b>tried</b> to score the pinfall, but Mysterio countered by pinning Guerrero to win the match. As a result, Guerrero {{was not able to}} reveal the secret.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} case was between plaintiff Brian Dowling and defendants Chicago Options Associates and Michael E. Davis, in which Dowling won a judgement of $817,830.45 from the defendants. After the court entered its judgement against him, Davis <b>then</b> <b>tried</b> to shield his assets from the plaintiff using his attorney-client {{relationship with the}} law firm of DLA Piper to assist him in buying a home in Florida. As part of this arrangement, Davis transferred funds into a trust account controlled by DLA Piper. At that time, as stated in the contract between DLA Piper and Davis, the law firm was allocated $100,000 of those funds as its retainer; the funds were used to pay day-to-day company expenses.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} technique employed was fresco, {{in which}} the paint is applied to damp plaster. Michelangelo had been an apprentice in the workshop of Domenico Ghirlandaio, {{one of the most}} competent and prolific of Florentine fresco painters, {{at the time that the}} latter was employed on a fresco cycle at Santa Maria Novella and whose work was represented on the walls of the Sistine Chapel. At the outset, the plaster, , began to grow mold because it was too wet. Michelangelo had to remove it and start again. He <b>then</b> <b>tried</b> a new formula created by one of his assistants, Jacopo l'Indaco, which resisted mold and entered the Italian building tradition.|$|E
5|$|With half-time fast approaching, Barcelona's {{confidence}} {{began to}} show: first, Messi attempted to flick a {{pass over the}} top of the United defence to Thierry Henry, which Rio Ferdinand intercepted; Iniesta <b>then</b> <b>tried</b> an ambitious back-heel that Van der Sar collected; and finally Messi sped through three Manchester United defenders towards the by-line, only for his cut-back cross to be pounced upon by Van der Sar and then cleared by Vidić. On the stroke of half-time, Iniesta himself then attempted to flick the ball through to Henry, but it was just too high for the French striker, and referee Massimo Busacca took that cue to blow the whistle for the interval.|$|E
