25|$|When using a {{comparator}} as a null detector, {{there are}} limits as <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>accuracy</b> of the zero value measurable. Zero output is given when {{the magnitude of the}} difference in the voltages multiplied by the gain of the amplifier is less than the voltage limits. For example, if the gain of the amplifier is 106, and the voltage limits are ±6V, then no output will be given if the difference in the voltages is less than 6μV. One could refer to this as a sort of uncertainty in the measurement.|$|E

Net cash flow is a frequent choice in professionally conducted business appraisals. The rationale behind this choice is that this earnings basis corresponds to the equity discount rate derived from the Build-Up or CAPM models: the returns obtained from investments in publicly traded companies can easily be represented in terms of net cash flows. At the same time, {{the discount rate}}s are generally also derived from the public capital markets data.|$|E
25|$|Mason's {{locomotives}} were genuinely handsome without ornaments. His {{influence was}} exerted over all locomotive builders {{at the time}} and later. In 1856 he built two locomotives for the Cairo and Alexandria Railroad of Egypt in which a commentator said that the engines' excellence was due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>accuracy</b> of execution attained by an admirable set of tools and a skillful set of workmen. Opinion by master mechanics was that they were the easiest engines to keep in repair. In 1871, the Mason Bogie was introduced.|$|E

25|$|If {{observation}} {{is confined to}} regions sufficiently remote from a system of charges, a multipole expansion of the exact polarization density can be made. By truncating this expansion (for example, retaining only the dipole terms, or only the dipole and quadrupole terms, or etc.), {{the results of the}} previous section are regained. In particular, truncating the expansion at the dipole term, the result is indistinguishable from the polarization density generated by a uniform dipole moment confined to the charge region. <b>To</b> <b>the</b> <b>accuracy</b> of this dipole approximation, as shown in the previous section, the dipole moment density p(r) (which includes not only p but the location of p) serves as P(r).|$|E

In an interview with Stock Car Racings Larry Cothren, driver Ryan Newman openly disputed the measurement of the banking of Bristol Motor Speedway's turns. Newman's crew measured the banking during a test session to aid with setups, {{and found that the}} turns were banked 26 degrees, rather than the advertised 36 degrees. A Camping World Truck Series open test noted the banking had dropped following resurfacing, to 22–27degrees, in a variable banking configuration.|$|E

25|$|Computed {{tomography}} angiography is a fast, {{noninvasive test}} that gives an accurate three-dimensional {{view of the}} aorta. These images are produced by taking rapid, thin-cut slices of the chest and abdomen, and combining them in the computer to create cross-sectional slices. To delineate the aorta <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>accuracy</b> necessary to make the proper diagnosis, an iodinated contrast material is injected into a peripheral vein. Contrast is injected and the scan performed using a bolus tracking method. This type of scan is timed to an injection to capture the contrast as it enters the aorta. The scan then follows the contrast as it flows though the vessel. It has a sensitivity of 96 to 100% and a specificity of 96 to 100%. Disadvantages include the need for iodinated contrast material and the inability to diagnose {{the site of the}} intimal tear.|$|E
25|$|Most of Plato's {{philosophical}} {{ideas were}} communicated through his beloved teacher Socrates as {{a presence in}} the dialogues. Though there are no extant writings of Socrates known, it is evident through Plato's works that Socrates had an incredible ability to explore the most intense analytical discussions.

Others are skeptical as <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>accuracy</b> of some of Plato's dialogues but nonetheless maintain that we can learn a substantial amount of historical information about Socrates from the dialogues. Still others take practically everything Plato wrote about Socrates as veridical history. Regardless, it may be safe to say that Plato never meant to record Socrates verbatim and it may plausibly be concluded that his general ideas were communicated in the dialogues.|$|E
