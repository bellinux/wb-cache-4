5|$|Because of {{its high}} {{resistance}} to P.cinnamomi dieback, the feasibility of using B.integrifolia as a rootstock for susceptible Banksia species in the cut flower trade is under investigation. Presently, the success rate for grafting is only 30–40%, and even with successful grafts <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> for the union to fail under stress. More research is needed before the technique {{will be ready for}} commercial use.|$|E
5|$|Measurements for the russet sparrow vary geographically, {{between the}} three {{subspecies}}, and also within the Himalayan subspecies cinnamomeus. The subspecies cinnamomeus is generally larger than the others, and within this form <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> for birds at higher altitudes to be larger, and a clinal variation in size with the smallest birds in {{the west of the}} range and the largest in the east.|$|E
5|$|If the {{concentration}} of the inert gas in the breathing gas is reduced below that {{of any of the}} tissues, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> for gas to return from the tissues to the breathing gas. This is known as out-gassing, and occurs during decompression, when the reduction in ambient pressure reduces the partial pressure of the inert gas in the lungs. This process may be complicated by the formation of gas bubbles, and the modeling is more complex and varied.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} ouabain on the stomatal {{opening and closing}} of {{epidermal}} strips of Vicia fava was observed both in the light and dark. Experimentation revealed that, by adding ouabain, both in the light and dark <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> for the closed stomata to open, while <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> for the open stomata not to close {{as compared with the}} control...|$|R

5|$|In a {{long-lived}} {{bird with}} a small clutch size such as the Atlantic puffin, the survival rate of adults {{is an important factor}} influencing the success of the species. Only 5% of the ringed puffins that failed to reappear at the colony did so during the breeding season. The rest were lost some time between departing from land in the summer and reappearing the following spring. The birds spend the winter widely spread out in the open ocean, though <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> for individuals from different colonies to overwinter in different areas. Little is known of their behaviour and diet at sea but no correlation was found between environmental factors, such as temperature variations, and their mortality rate. A combination of the availability of food in winter and summer probably influences the survival of the birds, since individuals starting the winter in poor condition are less likely to survive than those in good condition.|$|E
5|$|<b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> by some modern {{scholars}} to ascribe to ancient barbarians {{a degree of}} ethnic solidarity that did not exist, according to A.H.M. Jones. Germanic tribes were constantly fighting each other and even within such tribal confederations as the Franks or Alamanni there were bitter feuds between the constituent tribes and clans. Indeed, a primary reason why many tribal sub-groups surrendered to the Roman authorities (dediticii) and sought to settle in the empire as laeti was in order to escape pressure from their neighbours. The few known conflicts of loyalty only arose when the Roman army was campaigning against a barbarian-born soldier's own specific clan. Ammianus himself never characterises barbarian-born troops as unreliable. On the contrary, his evidence is that barbarian soldiers were as loyal, and fought as hard, as Roman ones.|$|E
5|$|The abdomen is {{the largest}} tagma of the insect, which {{typically}} consists of 11–12 segments and is less strongly sclerotized than the head or thorax. Each segment of the abdomen is represented by a sclerotized tergum and sternum. Terga are separated {{from each other and}} from the adjacent sterna or pleura by membranes. Spiracles are located in the pleural area. Variation of this ground plan includes the fusion of terga or terga and sterna to form continuous dorsal or ventral shields or a conical tube. Some insects bear a sclerite in the pleural area called a laterotergite. Ventral sclerites are sometimes called laterosternites. During the embryonic stage of many insects and the postembryonic stage of primitive insects, 11 abdominal segments are present. In modern insects <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> toward {{reduction in the number of}} the abdominal segments, but the primitive number of 11 is maintained during embryogenesis. Variation in abdominal segment number is considerable. If the Apterygota are considered to be indicative of the ground plan for pterygotes, confusion reigns: adult Protura have 12 segments, Collembola have 6. The orthopteran family Acrididae has 11 segments, and a fossil specimen of Zoraptera has a 10-segmented abdomen.|$|E

40|$|Two {{interesting}} {{results are}} obtained from CASS national household surveys of 1988 and 1995. First, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> for intra-provincial inequality in both earnings per worker and household income per capita {{not only to}} rise in each province but also to converge across provinces. Second, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> for both province mean earnings per worker and household mean incomes per capita not only to rise in each province but also to diverge across provinces. The paper is concerned to establish these patterns and then to explain them...|$|R

25|$|<b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> {{to abandon}} {{traditionally}} gender-invariable adjectives {{in favour of}} marked ones, something prevalent in Occitan and French. Thus, one can find bullent/bullenta ("boiling") in contrast with traditional bullent/bullent.|$|E

25|$|Comparative {{cooking method}} studies {{generally}} find that, if properly used, microwave cooking {{does not affect}} the nutrient content of foods to a larger extent than conventional heating, and that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> towards greater retention of many micronutrients with microwaving, probably due to the reduced preparation time.|$|E

25|$|The black-bellied {{whistling}} duck {{is mainly}} non-migratory. Birds {{in the extreme}} northern portions of their range (Arizona, Louisiana, and parts of Texas) move south in winter.

25|$|Ge'ez distinguishes two genders, {{masculine}} and feminine, which in certain words is {{marked with the}} suffix -t. These are less strongly distinguished than in other Semitic languages, in that many nouns not denoting persons {{can be used in}} either gender: in translated Christian texts <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> for nouns to follow the gender of the noun with a corresponding meaning in Greek.|$|E
25|$|In Germany the cittern survives {{under the}} names Waldzither and Lutherzither. The last {{name comes from}} the belief that Martin Luther played this instrument. Also, the names Thüringer Waldzither in Thüringer Wald, Harzzither in the Harz mountains, Halszither in German-speaking Switzerland are used. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> in modern German to {{interchange}} the words for cittern and zither.
