5|$|Ahidjo {{stepped down}} on 4 November 1982 and left power to his {{constitutional}} successor, Paul Biya. However, Ahidjo remained {{in control of}} the CNU and <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> the country from behind the scenes until Biya and his allies pressured him into resigning. Biya began his administration by moving toward a more democratic government, but a failed coup d'état nudged him toward the leadership style of his predecessor.|$|E
5|$|During {{the ride}} to Candyland, they come across a group of Calvin's slave {{trackers}} cornering one of Calvin's Mandingo fighters, D'artagnan, who <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> away due to no longer wanting to fight. Calvin says that because he bought D'artagnan for $500, D'artagnan (who has only fought three times) must fight at least five times. When Django and Dr. Schultz offer to reimburse Calvin and then change their minds, Calvin has his chief tracker, Mr. Stonecipher, unleash several attack dogs that tear D'artagnan to pieces.|$|E
5|$|During {{what became}} known as the Dodge City War, the mayor <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> Earp's friend Luke Short, part owner of the Long Branch saloon, first out of {{business}} and then out of town. Short appealed to Masterson, who contacted Earp. On May 31, 1883, Earp and Josephine went with Bat Masterson, Johnny Millsap, Shotgun John Collins, Texas Jack Vermillion, and Johnny Green to Dodge City to help Short.|$|E

5|$|Orozco, who {{saw himself}} as being {{instrumental}} in Madero's victory over Díaz, was merely appointed as a commander of the rurales in Chihuahua, which increased his resentment. When he <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> for governor of the state, Madero supported his opponent, Abraham González and eventually pressured Orozco {{to drop out of}} the race. When, in the aftermath of the Plan of Ayala, Madero ordered Orozco to lead federal troops to suppress Zapata, Orozco refused. In March 1912, Orozco issued his Plan of Empacadora and formally declared himself in rebellion against Madero.|$|E
5|$|The third {{televised}} match {{featured the}} Big Boss Man facing Bam Bam Bigelow. Bigelow attacked Boss Man before the match and controlled the match's beginning by using power moves to wear Boss Man down. Boss Man performed two clotheslines on Bigelow {{to gain the}} advantage. Bigelow responded by throwing Boss Man with a belly to back suplex, and then threw {{him out of the}} ring. He wore Boss Man down with a bear hug. Boss Man briefly regained the advantage by suplexing Bigelow but eventually <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> at Bigelow to crush him {{in the corner of the}} ring. As Boss Man approached, Bigelow kicked him in the face and followed this up by performing a diving headbutt from the top rope to win the match by pinfall.|$|E
5|$|Rodríguez Saá's brother Alberto Rodríguez Saá {{became the}} new {{governor}} of San Luis in 2003. Together with Carlos Menem, {{they attempted to}} create an alternative political group against Kirchner within the PJ. Adolfo Rodríguez Saá was elected Senator for San Luis representing this group at the 2005 election. He was reelected in 2011, with a term of office up to 2017. He <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> for governor of Buenos Aires Province in 2011, but the local judiciary did not allow him, as {{he did not have}} the required time living in the province. The mayor Sergio Massa organized the coalition United for a New Alternative to run for the 2015 presidential election and invited Rodríguez Saá to join, but he refused to join and ran with his own party, Federal Commitment. With 1.64% of the vote, it was the least voted party in the national elections.|$|E

5|$|Filming {{took place}} between 27 February and 25 April 1967. The budget was £275,000. At this time, Hammer was {{operating}} out of the Associated British Studios in Elstree, Borehamwood. However, a lack of space meant that production was relocated to the nearby MGM Borehamwood studio. There were no other productions working at the MGM Studios at this time so the Quatermass crew had full {{access to all the}} facilities of the studio. Roy Ward Baker was particularly pleased {{to be able to use}} MGM's extensive backlot for the exteriors of the Underground station. The production team included many Hammer regulars, including production designer Bernard Robinson who, as an in-joke, incorporated a poster for Hammer's The Witches (1966) into the dressing of his set for the Hobbs End station. Another Hammer regular was special effects supervisor Les Bowie. Roy Ward Baker recalled he had a row with Bowie, who believed the film was entirely a special effects picture, when he <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> the first pre-production conference. Bowie's contribution to the film included the Martian massacre scene, which was achieved with a mixture of puppets and live locusts, and model sequences of London's destruction, including the climactic scene of the crane swinging into the Martian apparition.|$|E
5|$|The Browns {{suffered}} {{their first}} {{defeat of the}} season {{at the hands of}} the San Francisco 49ers before a crowd of 70,385 in Cleveland. The 49ers led throughout the game, helped by three touchdown passes from left-handed quarterback Frankie Albert. Albert's main target was Alyn Beals, a former Santa Clara University star who caught two of his passes for touchdowns. Kicker Joe Vetrano added to the 49ers lead with a pair of field goals in the first half. Don Greenwood ran for a Browns touchdown in the second quarter, but the extra point was botched. The snap was high and went into kicker Lou Groza's arms. He <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> with the ball but suffered a back injury when he was tackled short of the end zone. Cliff Lewis was also injured in the second quarter, twisting his knee badly. He was taken to a hospital. The Browns ran only 24 offensive plays in the first half, and the 49ers were ahead by 14 points by halftime. Despite losing 34–21, the Browns matched the 49ers statistically, with 338 total yards to San Francisco's 357. Marion Motley, who had been the AAFC's leading rusher before the game, was held to 22 yards.|$|E
5|$|On Penn State's {{first play}} from {{scrimmage}} {{in the second}} half, Zach Zwinak fumbled, and it was returned for a touchdown by Frank Clark to pull within four points. After another Penn State drive stalled, Michigan drove down the field, and {{was faced with a}} third-and-short before a freshman offensive lineman committed a dead ball unsportsmanlike conduct penalty to back up Michigan to face a third and long; on that play Olaniyan recorded his third sack of the day, and Michigan punted. On Penn State's ensuing drive, they turned the ball over again, this time via a Hackenberg interception; Michigan capitalized by kicking a field goal. When Penn State got the ball back, they ran a sustained, balanced drive (4 run plays, 5 pass plays, 50 yards) down the field during which they went to Bill Belton in the running game (as Zwinak had fumbled previously in the half) that culminated with Sam Ficken kicking a 45-yard field goal to go up by 4 points. Michigan promptly drove right back down the field, and Gardner threw a touchdown pass to Jeremy Gallon to take the lead for the second time, 27–24. In the fourth quarter, Ficken attempted a 47-yard field goal, but missed, and Penn State's 10-play 45-yard drive came up empty. Michigan took advantage of their ensuing field position and ran a quick drive that ended with a 37-yard touchdown pass from Gardner to Funchess, putting them on top by 10 with 10:28 to go. On Penn State's ensuing drive, they converted a fourth down and one near midfield prior to a penalty and then a sack setting up a third and long on which Hackenberg threw an incomplete pass, so they were forced to settle with pulling within 7; Sam Ficken kicked a 43-yard field goal. Michigan <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> out the clock on their next drive, and Penn State burned all three of their timeouts. Though they were at one point within field goal range, they committed a five-yard delay of game penalty that pushed them out of range, and they had to punt. Penn State got the ball with 50 seconds left and no timeouts at their own 20-yard line. Needing a touchdown to tie the game, Penn State's first play of scrimmage was a pass from Hackenberg to Robinson along the sideline that was ruled incomplete on the field, but was reviewed and overturned and counted as a 14-yard gain. The next play was an acrobatic catch by Felder for 29 yards, and then a pass down the sideline to Robinson for 36 yards to put the ball inside the one yard line with 29 seconds remaining. Michigan then called their final timeout. Hackenberg then attempted a quarterback sneak over the right side for a touchdown; the play was reviewed and the call was confirmed, and Ficken made the extra point to tie the game with 27 seconds left. Michigan took the ball at their own 35, drove it to the other 35, and lined Gibbons up to attempt a 52-yard field goal, which he missed short. Penn State got the ball with two seconds left, but downed the ball to send the game into overtime.|$|E

There are no primaries in a recall election. Davis <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> “outside the recall circus” and to make himself appear gubernatorial and hard at work for California, and who had made improvements to education and healthcare.
