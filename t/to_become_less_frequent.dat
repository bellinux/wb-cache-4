40|$|As the {{atmosphere}} warms, precipitation events are likely <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>less</b> <b>frequent</b> but more intense. While extensive {{efforts have been}} made to understand how changes in mean annual precipitation will affect plant growth, particularly in semi-arid systems, relatively little is known about how increasing precipitation intensity will affect plant growth and hydrologic cycles. A recent study by Kulmatiski and Beard (2013) found that small increases in precipitation intensity increased woody plant growth and decreased grass growth in a three-year experiment in a savanna system, Kruger National Park. Here we report results from the following two years of that experiment. Due to naturally large precipitation events, plant available water was similar between treatment and control plots {{in the last two years}} of the study allowing us to test woody plant and grass responses to treatment removal (i. e., legacy effects). Treatment effects on grass and tree growth disappeared within months of treatment removal. However, due to a legacy effect of treatments, tree mass was greater in treatment that control plots at the end of the experiment. Measurements of root recruitment and hydrological tracer uptake, but not root volume helped explain plant growth responses to treatments. Results suggest that savanna plants respond rapidly to changes in precipitation intensity, but because of legacy effects, occasional increases in precipitation intensity can result in long-term shrub encroachment...|$|E
40|$|One {{of the key}} {{features}} {{of global climate change}} will be perturbations to the hydrological regime across Europe. To date, assessments of the impacts of future change have generally used results from only one climate model, thus underestimating the range of possible change projected by different climate models. Here, the skill of six regional climate models (RCMs) in reproducing the mean precipitation for the 1961 – 1990 period for six catchments across Europe is compared and their projections of changes in future precipitation are assessed. A simple drought index based on monthly precipitation anomalies is also described and used to assess the models. Considerable variation in model skill in reproducing monthly mean precipitation and drought statistics is observed, with model errors in the reproduction of drought events independent of those for the mean, suggesting that the models have difficulties in reproducing the observed persistence of low monthly rainfall totals. In broad terms, the models indicate decreases in summer and increases in winter precipitation across Europe. On the regional scales required for impacts analysis, considerable model uncertainty is demonstrated for future projections, particularly for drought frequency. Although increases in the frequency of long-duration droughts are identified for catchments in southern Europe, the magnitude of this change is not certain. In contrast, for a catchment in northern England, such events are likely <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>less</b> <b>frequent.</b> For shorter-duration droughts, future changes encompass the direction of change. For stakeholders in each of the regions, these changes and uncertainties pose different challenges for the management of water resources.

The works of Erasmus, Rabelais, Scaliger, More, Poliziano, and many other intellectual leaders were published by the Württemberger Sebastian Gryphe, who set up in Lyon. When French policy turned away from Italy in the 1550s, Royal visits <b>to</b> Lyon <b>became</b> <b>less</b> <b>frequent.</b> It was also caught up in the Religious Wars and in 1562 was seized by Protestant troops. Lyon was the location of the meeting that resulted in 1601 in large parts of the Dukedom of Savoy being added to the French kingdom. Lyon lost the considerable degree of autonomy that it had hitherto enjoyed around this time, but its commercial and industrial importance were not abated. During the 17th and 18th centuries its pre-eminence in silk production was unchallenged, and inventors like Vaucanson and Jacquard made far-reaching contributions to this industry. The geographical situation of Lyon meant that many artists and architects passed through it on their way to and from Italy, and their influence is plain to see in many buildings of the period, such as the Hôtel-Dieu and the Loge du Change. During the 18th century the expansion resulting from increased prosperity indicated the need for a measure of systematic town planning, and this was carried out by a series of brilliant planners and architects such as de Cotte, Soufflot, Morand, and Perrache.|$|R
40|$|Unusual or {{extreme weather}} and climate-related events are of great public concern and interest, {{yet there are}} often {{conflicting}} messages from scientists about whether such events {{can be linked to}} climate change. There is clear evidence that climate has changed as a result of human-induced greenhouse gas emissions, and that across the globe some aspects of extremes have changed as a result.

40|$|Freeze events {{significantly}} influence {{landscape structure}} and community composition along subtropical coastlines. This {{is particularly true}} in south Florida, where such disturbances have historically contributed to patch diversity within the mangrove forest, and have {{played a part in}} limiting its inland transgression. With projected increases in mean global temperatures, such instances are likely <b>to</b> <b>become</b> much <b>less</b> <b>frequent</b> in the region, contributing to a reduction in heterogeneity within the mangrove forest itself. To understand the process more clearly, we explored the dynamics of a Dwarf mangrove forest following two chilling events that produced freeze-like symptoms, i. e., leaf browning, desiccation, and mortality, and interpreted the resulting changes within the context of current winter temperatures and projected future scenarios. Structural effects from a 1996 chilling event were dramatic, with mortality and tissue damage concentrated among individuals comprising the Dwarf forest 2 ̆ 7 s low canopy. This disturbance promoted understory plant development and provided an opportunity for Laguncularia racemosa to share dominance with Rhizophora mangle. Mortality due to the less severe 2001 event was greatest in the understory, probably because recovery of the protective canopy following the earlier freeze was still incomplete. Stand dynamics were static over the same period in nearby unimpacted sites. The probability of reaching temperatures as low as those recorded at a nearby meteorological station (≤ 3 °C) under several warming scenarios was simulated by applying 1 ° incremental temperature increases to a model developed from a 42 -year temperature record. According to the model, the frequency of similar chilling events decreased from once every 1. 9 years at present to once every 3. 4 and 32. 5 years with 1 and 4 °C warming, respectively. The large decrease in the frequency of these events would eliminate an important mechanism that maintains Dwarf forest structure, and promotes compositional diversity...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Prophylactic {{strategies}} to counter acquired hearing impairment may involve routine audiometric screening of asymptomatic working-age adults attending general practice for regular health checks. AIM: To evaluate {{the effect of}} adult hearing screening on subsequent noise exposure and hearing. DESIGN OF STUDY: A randomised controlled population-based study of health checks and health discussions in general practice. SETTING: The project was initiated {{in the district of}} Ebeltoft, Aarhus county, Denmark. METHOD: Intervention group participants' hearing thresholds were determined audiometrically at 0. 5, 1, 2, 3, and 4 kHz in each ear. Participants were advised to get their ears checked if the average hearing loss exceeded 20 dB hearing level (dBHL) in either ear. Noise avoidance was emphasised when thresholds exceeded 25 dBHL bilaterally at 4 kHz. Follow-up included questionnaires and audiometry. RESULTS: Hearing loss was observed among 18. 9 % of the study sample at baseline. At the five-year follow-up we recorded {{no significant differences between the}} control and the intervention groups regarding subjective or objective hearing, or exposure to occupational noise. However, there was a tendency towards reduction in exposure to leisure noise among intervention participants (P = 0. 045). Approximately 20 % reported hearing problems; 16. 5 % reported tinnitus-related complaints; 0. 8 % used hearing aids; 35. 0 % reported frequent noise exposure; and occluding wax was suspected in 2. 1 %. CONCLUSION: Preventive health checks with audiometry did not significantly affect hearing, but leisure noise exposure tended <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>less</b> <b>frequent.</b> The poor effect may be ascribed to inadequate audiological counselling or a higher priority to other advice, e. g. on cardiovascular risk or lifestyle...|$|E
40|$|This study {{analyses}} {{the relationship}} of technical progress and unemployment when technological acceleration increases capital productivity but reduces the transferability of skills between jobs. The model combines the vintage capital framework (Aghion and Howitt 1994, Mortensen and Pissarides 1998) with skill dynamics (Violante 2001), producing a framework where both physical and human capital have the vintage property, whereas previous studies consider only vintage physical capital. We investigate the effects of technical progress and skill dynamics on wage growth, job creation and destruction and equilibrium unemployment for workers with vintage specific skills and for workers with general skills. The model considers capital productivity increasing with technical progress and two dimensional skills (Violante 2001). A workers productivity in the current job increases by learning by doing, but upon changing jobs her productivity is reduced because {{only a fraction of}} skills are transferable to a job of a more recent vintage. Transferability depends on the technological distance between jobs. Acceleration in technical progress increases capital productivity in competing jobs at the technological frontier but decreases the transferability of skills to these jobs, implying an ambiguous effect on the outside option and wage growth of workers. Specificity of skills determines the effect of technical progress on wage growth, job creation and destruction and equilibrium unemployment. For workers with specific skills technical progress causes an adverse effect on the outside option and wage growth as the increase in capital productivity is offset by loss of skills upon changing jobs. When match technology is fixed and skills are specific slower wage growth implies higher profitability of jobs, longer job duration and lower equilibrium unemployment. In jobs for which updating of technology is feasible, the need <b>to</b> update <b>becomes</b> <b>less</b> <b>frequent</b> as the profitability of jobs increases. These results are the opposite to those obtained in earlier studies (Mortensen and Pissarides 1998, Pissarides 2000). When renovation is feasible, the effect of technical progress on equilibrium unemployment depends on whether only capital or both capital and workers' skills are updated. Equilibrium unemployment increases in the former case and decreases in the latter case. Endast sammandrag.

40|$|Inwardly {{rectifying}} potassium (Kir) {{channels are}} gated by {{the interaction of}} their cytoplasmic regions with membrane-bound phosphatidylinositol- 4, 5 -bisphosphate (PIP 2). In the present study, we examined how PIP 2 interaction regulates channel availability and channel openings to various subconductance levels (sublevels) {{as well as the}} fully open state in the strong inward rectifier Kir 2. 1 channel. Various Kir 2. 1 channel constructs were expressed in Xenopus oocytes and single channel or macroscopic currents were recorded from inside-out patches. The wild-type (WT) channel rarely visited the subconductance levels under control conditions. However, upon reducing Kir 2. 1 channel interaction with PIP 2 by a variety of interventions, including PIP 2 antibodies, screening PIP 2 with neomycin, or mutating PIP 2 binding sites (e. g. K 188 Q), visitation to the sublevels was markedly increased before channels were converted to an unavailable mode in which they did not open. No channel activity was detected in channels with the double mutation K 188 A/R 189 A, a mutant which exhibits extremely weak interaction with PIP 2. By linking subunits together in tandem dimers or tetramers containing mixtures of WT and K 188 A/R 189 A subunits, we demonstrate that one functional PIP 2 -interacting WT subunit is sufficient to convert channels from the unavailable to the available mode with a high open probability dominated by the fully open state, with similar kinetics as tetrameric WT channels. Occasional openings <b>to</b> sublevels <b>become</b> progressively <b>less</b> <b>frequent</b> as the number of WT subunits increases. Quantitative analysis reveals that the interaction of PIP 2 with WT subunits exerts strong positive cooperativity in both converting the channels from the unavailable to the available mode, and in promoting the fully open state over sublevels. We conclude that the interaction of PIP 2 with only one Kir 2. 1 subunit is sufficient for the channel <b>to</b> <b>become</b> available and <b>to</b> open to its full conductance state. Interaction with additional subunits exerts positive cooperativity at multiple levels to further enhance channel availability and promote the fully open state...|$|R
