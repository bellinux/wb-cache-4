40|$|Ecological {{impacts of}} {{reservoir}} dams {{have been reported}} from various aspects such as 1) barrier for migratory animals like anadromous fishes, 2) eutrophication of reservoirs by plankton blooming, 3) decreasing flow volumes in <b>tail</b> <b>waters,</b> 4) stabilization of flow regimes by flood peak cut, 4) changes in thermal regimes of river water, 5) river bed degradation and increase in substrate grain size by sediment trapping, etc. In this lecture, these impacts will be reviewed with some examples in Japanese and Asian rivers, particularly those on benthic animals and their habitat conditions in <b>tail</b> <b>waters.</b> Figure 1. Comparison of the riverbed landscape between upstream and downstream reaches of the Yasugawa Dam in the Yasu River in central Japan. The dam {{is as old as}} 53 years and the distinctive riverbed armoring can be observed. White part of rocks indicates thick accumulation of organic matter originated from the reservoir. If you visit a dam site and compare the river landscapes between upstream and downstream reaches of the reservoir, you will notice the drastic changes in riverbed geomorphology (Figure 1). The contrast in grain size is the most distinctive: i. e., sand, gravel and cobble substrates disappear in <b>tail</b> <b>waters.</b> In addition, the rocks and stones in the surface layer of the riverbed are too fixed to remove them by hand. These phenomena observed in <b>tail</b> <b>waters</b> of reservoir dams are called as “armoring”. The armoring riverbed is characterized also by a thick epilithon composed of algae, fine particulate organic matter and silt deposited on the surface of substrates (Figure 2) ...|$|R

But it was later observed that the water still had a hydraulic head of about 120 m which could be used. To use this head, the Kolkewadi Dam was constructed at this location. It forms a balancing reservoir and maintains the head. This dam impounds the <b>tail</b> race <b>water</b> from Stage I and II. This water is drawn through penstocks and electricity is generated by four Francis turbine units with a capacity of 80 MW each.

Both dams are around 25m high and have a total length of 1300m (170m and 1100m). The drill and blast headrace tunnel, which is 4 km long, 11,3m wide and 14,7m high, provides the turbines and the power plant with water from the new created intake Sporðalda reservoir. The tunnel transports the water through the mountain to a surge basin on the west side near the Sultartangi Reservoir, afterwards two 60m long steel pressure pipes (steel lined penstocks) are moving the water into the station´s turbines.|$|E

5000|$|... 200 Tmcft {{surplus water}} {{annually}} from the Godavari River is {{planned to be}} fed into this tail pond by the Dummugudem Lift Irrigation Scheme which is under execution. The water transferred to this tail pond will be pumped to the upstream 410 Tmcft gross water storage capacity Nagarjuna Sagar reservoir to feed its right and left bank canals. Thus Nagarjuna Sagar reservoir need not receive the water supply from the upstream Srisailam reservoir. As the <b>tail</b> <b>water</b> level (48.33 m MSL) of this dam is below the full reservoir level (53.34 m MSL) of the downstream Pulichintala dam, surplus water in Pulichinthala reservoir can be pumped by envisaging pumped storage units from Pulichinthala reservoir to Nagarjunasagar reservoir via this pond. The retained water in the Srisailam reservoir {{would be used for}} upstream water uses from Jurala and Srisailam reservoirs for irrigation needs in uplands of Telangana and Rayalaseema regions. The water from the Nagarjuna Sagar reservoir can also be pumped to the Srisailam reservoir by Srisailam left bank hydro electric power station (900 MW) in pumping mode in case of severe drought in Krishna river basin.
