5|$|The Scottish estate {{job offer}} fell through and Mitchell became unemployed. He later stated that {{giving up his}} seat in Parliament had been a {{disastrous}} mistake. He {{spent much of the}} next 10 years <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> into Parliament. He applied to several Conservative associations (for example, Bournemouth East in August 1977). But at every selection interview he was questioned about his reasons for giving up Aberdeenshire West in 1974. No winnable constituency would adopt him.|$|E

However, Indi's brother, Dexter (Charles Cottier), drives the car and crashes, leaving him with serious injuries. Ruby feels guilty for what she has done and decides to hand herself into the police.|$|E
5|$|The German advance never {{recovered}} from its initial delay, and Kampfgruppe Peiper only {{got as far}} as Stoumont, where the remaining vehicles ran out of fuel and came under heavy attack from American aircraft, artillery, and tanks. Having advanced less than half-way to the River Meuse, they were forced to abandon more than a hundred vehicles in the town, including six Tiger II tanks. The soldiers were ordered to find their way east on foot. Having started the offensive with about 5,800 men, 60 tanks (including 30 Tiger IIs), 3 flak tanks, 75 half-tracks, 14 20mm Flak Wagons, 27 75mm assault guns, plus 105 and 150mm SP Howitzers, Hitler's prized Kampfgruppe was reduced to 800 S.S. troopers creeping through the brush at night, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> to their own line.|$|E

5|$|Due {{to several}} rain showers between {{first and second}} practice, the track was again wet during the second session, which limited the drivers to using the {{intermediate}} tyres only. Hamilton was again fastest, setting a time of 1:38.841. Teammate Rosberg crashed at turn seven thirty minutes into the session, damaging a new-specification front wing that the team had deliberately not run in first practice for fear of damage. Rosberg later apologised for the incident, which saw him <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> to pit lane, before his team told him to stop on track, calling an early end to his session. Nico Hülkenberg, Räikkönen, Ricciardo and Carlos Sainz Jr. all finished within one second of Hamilton's time, while Sergio Pérez was at one point {{on his way to}} a new fastest time overall, setting best times in the first two timechecks along the track, before having to slow in the last part of the lap due to heavy rain. The two Manor drivers Pascal Wehrlein and Haryanto covered the highest number of laps, with 24 and 22 laps in 12th and 14th place respectively. Neither Renault nor Williams drivers set a time, albeit going on track. The Sauber cars and Max Verstappen's Toro Rosso did not leave the garage at all during the session.|$|E
5|$|We {{all had a}} {{collective}} feeling like we'd had enough {{of this kind of}} shit. It wasn't anything tangible anybody said to anyone else, it was just kind of like everything over the years had come to a head on that one particular night in the one particular place, and it was not an organized demonstration... Everyone in the crowd felt that we were never going to go back. It was like the last straw. It was time to reclaim something that had always been taken from us.... All kinds of people, all different reasons, but mostly it was total outrage, anger, sorrow, everything combined, and everything just kind of ran its course. It was the police who were doing most of the destruction. We were really <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> in and break free. And we felt that we had freedom at last, or freedom to at least show that we demanded freedom. We weren't going to be walking meekly in the night and letting them shove us around—it's like standing your ground {{for the first time and}} in a really strong way, and that's what caught the police by surprise. There was something in the air, freedom a long time overdue, and we're going to fight for it. It took different forms, but the bottom line was, we weren't going to go away. And we didn't.|$|E

25|$|Some {{journalists have}} theorized that Silkwood's car was rammed from behind by another vehicle, {{with the intent}} to cause an {{accident}} that would result in her death. Skid marks from Silkwood's car were present on the road, suggesting that she was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> onto the road after being pushed from behind.|$|E
25|$|This {{theory has}} been {{developed}} with great attention to local analysis, leading {{to the definition of}} the Tate-Shafarevich group. In general the approach of taking the torsor theory, easy over an algebraically closed field, and <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> 'down' to a smaller field is an aspect of descent. It leads at once to questions of Galois cohomology, since the torsors represent classes in group cohomology H1.|$|E

In the fifth, Warfield reached base with one out on an error by Moore. Carr walked, and Mackey doubled off the right field wall, driving in Warfield. Judy Johnson {{grounded}} to Bell, and Carr was thrown out <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> to third after attempting to score on the play. Thomas flied out to end the inning, and Hilldale was up, 2–0.|$|E
25|$|As to York's {{later life}} and death, semi-contemporaries Washington Irving and Zenas Leonard give {{contradictory}} accounts. When Irving interviewed Clark in 1832, Clark {{claimed to have}} freed York, but that York regretted being free {{because he was a}} failure at business, and died <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> to serve his master as a slave again in St. Louis. Some contemporary historians doubt the accuracy of Clark's story, for it reflects pro-slavery arguments that Africans were happy to be slaves, and could not lead successful lives as free people. However, manumission laws and practices of the era often required freed slaves to leave the area, and their family and friends.|$|E
25|$|On 8 October 2001, a UNOMIG {{helicopter}} {{was shot down}} in Georgia in Kodori Valley gorge near Abkhazia, amid fighting between Chechens and Abkhazians, killing nine including five UN observers. Georgia denied having troops in the area, and the suspicion fell on the armed group headed by Chechen warlord Ruslan Gelayev, who was speculated to have been hired by the Georgian government to wage proxy war against separatist Abkhazia. On 2 March 2004, following a number of cross-border raids from Georgia into Chechnya, Ingushetia, and Dagestan, Gelayev {{was killed in a}} clash with Russian border guards while <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> from Dagestan into Georgia.|$|E

[...] However, in 1969, Dylan confessed to Rolling Stones editor, Jann Wenner, [...] "I just sat down at a table and started writing... And I just got carried away with the whole thing...

500|$|Although MacFarlane enjoyed {{working at}} Hanna-Barbera, {{he felt his}} real calling was for prime-time animation, which would allow a much edgier style of humor. He first pitched Family Guy to Fox during his tenure at Hanna-Barbera. A {{development}} executive for Hanna-Barbera, who was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> into the prime-time business at the time, introduced MacFarlane to Leslie Kolins and Mike Darnell, heads of the alternative comedy department at Fox. After the success of King of the Hill in 1997, MacFarlane called Kolins once more to ask about a possible second pitch for the series. The company offered the young writer a strange deal: Fox gave him a budget of US$50,000 to produce a pilot {{that could lead to}} a series (most episodes of animated prime-time productions cost at least US$1 million). Recalling the experience in an interview with The New York Times, MacFarlane stated, [...] "I spent about six months with no sleep and no life, just drawing like crazy in my kitchen and doing this pilot".|$|E
500|$|The {{scene where}} the cast is <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> to the {{elevator}} after hooking up actor Stellan Skarsgård to the helicopter is actually an accident that {{made it into the}} finished film. As Jackson explained, [...] "At one point three tons of water got thrown on us by accident and we got swept toward those cargo bays and everyone thought we were going into the drink and people were tumbling around this metal grating [...] We scrambled up and kept acting [...] That was not supposed to happen and we didn't have safety harnesses on and we were flailing around on this deck." [...] Jackson was initially offered the role played by LL Cool J, but his management team did not like the idea of him playing a chef, so Harlin created the role of Russell Franklin for him. Additionally, LL Cool J's character was supposed to die early on, but the director ultimately decided to keep him. The production team could not afford to have a fully trained parrot for LL Cool J's character, so they used two parrots: one that was good at flying, and another that could sit on his shoulder.|$|E
500|$|Howard {{reunited with}} Shyamalan for Lady in the Water, {{in which she}} acts as Story, a type of water nymph called a narf. The 2006 fantasy film release also stars Paul Giamatti as the co-lead. Shyamalan's project follows the story of Giamatti's {{character}} rescuing {{what he thinks is}} a young woman (Howard) from his pool. Once he discovers that she is actually a character from a bedtime story who is <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> home, he teams up with his tenants to protect her from creatures that try to keep her in their world. It underperformed at the box office, falling short of its $75million budget, and got largely negative reviews from critics. Next, she once again played Rosalind in Kenneth Branagh's 2006 film version of Shakespeare's As You Like It. It played in theatres in Europe before going directly to cable in the United States, premiering on HBO. Howard was nominated for a Golden Globe Award at the 2008 ceremony. The project got soundly negative reviews from the British media, while American reviewers gave it more favorable notice. [...] That year, she wrote and directed a short film, Orchids, as part of Glamour magazine's [...] "Reel Moments" [...] series funded by Cartier and FilmAid International.|$|E
