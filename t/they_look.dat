5|$|Timema spp. {{differ from}} other Phasmatodea in that their tarsi have three {{segments}} rather than five. For stick insects, they have relatively small, stout bodies, so that <b>they</b> <b>look</b> somewhat like earwigs (order Dermaptera).|$|E
5|$|As {{she does}} not expect to see it, Izzi asks Tom to finish {{the outcome of the}} story for her. As <b>they</b> <b>look</b> out to the star of a nebula, she imagines, as the Mayans did, that their souls will meet there after life and when the star goes supernova. In the 26th century, future space {{traveler}} Tommy travels there for the event, in a spaceship made of an enclosed biosphere containing the Tree of Life he seeded above her grave.|$|E

The team deals with the Silence, a race of aliens with the ability to make people forget their encounter with them when <b>they</b> <b>look</b> away.|$|E

60|$|The young {{soldiers}} {{did not quite}} know what to do. <b>They</b> <b>looked</b> at the man, <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> at the sergeant, one of them looked down and fastened his braces on the second button.|$|R
60|$|A wild shout {{from every}} {{height of the}} defile was the answer. <b>They</b> <b>looked</b> up, <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> round; the crest of every steep was covered with armed Arabs, each man with his musket levelled.|$|R
5|$|Sirenia is {{an order}} of fully aquatic, herbivorous mammals that inhabit rivers, estuaries, coastal marine waters, swamps and marine wetlands. Sirenians, {{including}} manatees and dugongs, possess major aquatic adaptations: arms used for steering, a paddle used for propulsion, and remnants of hind limbs (legs) {{in the form of}} two small bones floating deep in the muscle. <b>They</b> <b>look</b> ponderous and clumsy but are actually fusiform, hydrodynamic and highly muscular, and mariners before the mid-nineteenth century referred to them as mermaids.|$|E
5|$|Skuas and jaegers are {{in general}} medium to large birds, {{typically}} with gray or brown plumage, often with white markings on the wings. They have longish bills with hooked tips and webbed feet with sharp claws. <b>They</b> <b>look</b> like large dark gulls, {{but have a}} fleshy cere above the upper mandible. They are strong, acrobatic fliers.|$|E

60|$|They {{listened to}} her with adoring attention. <b>They</b> <b>looked</b> genteel. <b>They</b> <b>looked</b> ironed-out. <b>They</b> coughed politely, and crossed their legs with quietness, and in {{expensive}} linen handkerchiefs they blew their noses with a delicacy altogether optimistic and refined.|$|R
60|$|<b>They</b> <b>looked</b> curiously at one another. With an {{affectation}} {{of indifference}} I began to chop idly {{at the ground}} in front of me with my hatchet. <b>They</b> <b>looked,</b> I noticed, at the deep cuts I made in the turf.|$|R
6000|$|The Lion {{climbed the}} ladder next, and the Tin Woodman came last; {{but both of}} them cried, [...] "Oh, my!" [...] as soon as <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> over the wall.

60|$|So {{right away}} the three {{separated}} {{to look for}} Old Mr. Toad. All along {{the bank of the}} Smiling Pool <b>they</b> <b>looked.</b> <b>They</b> peeped under old leaves and sticks. <b>They</b> <b>looked</b> in every place where Old Mr. Toad might have hidden, but not a trace of him did they find.|$|R
60|$|<b>They</b> <b>looked</b> at one another, almost, as it were, apprehensively.|$|R

5|$|The {{tinamous}} {{are one of}} {{the most}} ancient groups of bird. Although <b>they</b> <b>look</b> similar to other ground-dwelling birds like quail and grouse, they have no close relatives and are classified as a single family, Tinamidae, within their own order, the Tinamiformes. They are distantly related to the ratites (order Struthioniformes), that includes the rheas, emus, and kiwis.|$|E

6000|$|At {{first the}} girls were filled with wonder when they saw that they had slept in the wood among the {{raspberry}} bushes. <b>They</b> <b>looked</b> at each other, <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> at their beds, which were of the finest flax covered over with leaves and moss. At last Lisa said: 'Are you awake, Aina?' ...|$|R

5|$|This is {{shutting}} the stable door after the horse has well and truly bolted. We argued this train should not replace visual inspections. Inspectors who walk the track are {{the eyes and}} ears of the railway. They don't just check {{the safety of the}} track, <b>they</b> <b>look</b> at the area surrounding it, check for signs of potential trouble such as gaps in the fence where vandals could get in.|$|E
5|$|Alan begins {{driving the}} car down the road, and sees Frank Jr. and Betty in front of him. <b>They</b> <b>look</b> behind to wave to Alan, and he waves back. However, the pair keep driving while looking backwards. Observing that a {{railroad}} with an oncoming train is near, Alan desperately tries to signal to them to stop waving and look ahead. When they do not pay attention to him and continue waving, Alan shields his eyes as the two drive right {{into the path of}} the train and are killed. Back in the present, at the funeral, Hal enters his police car, and decides to go back on the road in order to prevent more traffic accidents from occurring.|$|E
5|$|At Quantico, someone slips a {{newspaper}} article under Scully's door enabling her to identify the original body as a crew member on a Russian ship. Mulder and Scully meet at the processing plant and <b>they</b> <b>look</b> at the strange, fluke-like man. Skinner wants to prosecute the creature and subject it to a psychiatric evaluation, which Mulder thinks would be difficult. Skinner tells Mulder of Craig's death and admits that {{this would have been}} an X-File had they still been open. Mulder raises his discontentment claiming that with X-Files, a certain pair of agents could have saved a life. Skinner simply responds saying everyone takes their orders from someone, implying the decision was not his and came from higher up the chain of command.|$|E

5|$|Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{visit the}} {{headquarters}} of First Person Shooterss developers in Inland Empire, California, where they meet the Lone Gunmen, who work as consultants for the game. <b>They</b> <b>look</b> at {{the body of the}} player, which clearly displays a gunshot wound. Ivan claims there is no way a real gun could have been brought into the highly-secured building. The agents are shown a video from the game, featuring the female character who killed the player. Mulder takes the printout of the character and shows it to a detective, as he believes she is the killer.|$|E
5|$|How {{were such}} effects produced, {{and how did}} <b>they</b> <b>look?</b> The {{crocodile}} etc. obviously used the floor trap, but was it an illusionistically painted figure worked with sticks, or {{a man in a}} crocodile suit? There are no extant drawings or descriptions of machinery and sets for the Restoration theatre, although some documentation exists for court masques from {{the first half of the}} 17th century, notably the work of Inigo Jones and his pupil John Webb. One reason for the lack of information for the public theatres is that stage effects, and particularly machines, were trade secrets. Inventors of theatrical effects took great pains to hold on to their secrets, and the playhouses guarded their machine workings as zealously as a magician guards her or his tricks.|$|E
5|$|Jackals, or Kig-Yar, (from {{the moon}} of Eayn, {{orbiting}} Chu'ot) carry energy shields or ranged weaponry. Shield or armor colors denotes {{the rank of}} each caste. In some cases, such as with the Jackals, the overall design was honed once the enemy's role was clearly defined. <b>They</b> <b>look</b> like bird-like creatures or raptors. This particular species did not come into the Covenant {{in the same way}} as other species. They work as mercenaries, as their culture is based on piracy and do not follow the religious beliefs like the other species. In the Halo book, Halo: Contact Harvest, it was revealed that Jackals were the first species in the Covenant to encounter humanity. The resulting events initiated the start of the Human-Covenant War.|$|E
