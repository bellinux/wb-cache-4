5|$|While Guitar Hero: Aerosmith {{maintains}} the same gameplay as past Guitar Hero games, {{it has received}} criticism for being shorter and easier than the previous Guitar Hero titles and difficult <b>to</b> <b>justify</b> <b>its</b> price point; furthermore, with the game's strong focus on one band, reviewers felt that the game's ultimate enjoyment rested on the player's appreciation and fandom for the music of Aerosmith.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1980, {{the cost of}} {{building}} the Auburn Dam was estimated at $1 billion. As of 2007, the cost to build the dam would be about $10 billion. Other projects to improve safety margins and spillway capacity of Folsom Dam, and to increase the capacity of levees in the Sacramento area, were projected to cost significantly less while also providing similar levels of flood protection. Also, the United States National Research Council believes that existing stream-flow records, which only date back about 150 years, are insuffient to justify the construction of a dam as large as Auburn. The amount of water supply that Auburn Dam would actually make available was also in question, because while the American River floods in some years, in other years it barely discharges enough water to fill already-existing reservoirs. This casted doubts that Auburn could deliver enough water <b>to</b> <b>justify</b> <b>its</b> own cost, or the completion of Folsom South Canal, the other major feature of the Auburn-Folsom South Unit Project.|$|E
5|$|The Berlin Conference of 1884 {{assigned}} the territory to Germany, with imprecise boundaries. When Gustav Adolf von Götzen explored the country ten years later, {{he discovered that}} the Kingdom of Rwanda included a fertile region east of Lake Kivu. Germany wanted this region, which was also claimed by Leopold II {{as part of his}} own Congo Free State (annexed by Belgium to form the Belgian Congo in 1908). <b>To</b> <b>justify</b> <b>its</b> claim, Germany began a policy of ruling through the Rwandan monarchy and supporting Tutsi chiefs; this system allowed colonisation with few European troops. Yuhi V Musinga, who emerged as king after a succession crisis following {{the death of his father}} Rwabugiri and a struggle with Belgian troops, welcomed the Germans and used them to consolidate his power. The territory became the western border of German East Africa. German rule allowed Rwabugiri's centralisation policy to continue, and the rift between Tutsi and Hutu deepened.|$|E

The first larynx was removed 14 days after injection, {{while the second}} was examined 5 months after injection. The specimens are described macroscopically and microscopically. Excellent tolerance to the collagen was noted, with virtually no inflammatory reaction seen. The collagen injected {{seems to have been}} colonized progressively by the host cells and by neovessels. These findings coincide closely with those observed in animal models. In comparison to the inflammatory granulomas found after injections with Teflon, the absence of inflammatory reactions following the use of collagen does at least contribute <b>to</b> <b>justifying</b> <b>its</b> continued application clinically...|$|R

40|$|As earlier {{contributions}} to this roundtable series have underscored, British history enjoys a wide institutional presence outside the UK, although one facing various challenges, particularly with respect <b>to</b> <b>justifying</b> <b>its</b> relevance {{in an era}} of reduced budgets and, especially in North America, shifting priorities. The present essay will examine the place of British history in contemporary Hong Kong, Britain’s last major colony, 15 years after its ‘Handover’ to the People’s Republic of China. Given Hong Kong’s small size, we will take ‘modern British history’ rather than ‘twentieth-century British history’ as our remit, for reasons that should become clear. Moreover, in contrast to previous essays in this series engaging with the USA, Germany, and France, {{we will not be able}} to identify a distinct local historiography of modern Britain, except insofar as much local engagement with modern British history occurs through the prism of Hong Kong’s experience as a British colony...|$|R

40|$|In Nigeria the {{constitutional}} {{role of the}} Legislature is yet to receive adequate scholarly attention. The main area of focus in most literature has been the executive arm of government and its other related activities. This paper examined the evolution of legislative functions in Nigeria with a view <b>to</b> <b>justifying</b> <b>its</b> contributions <b>to</b> democracy especially in the first, second and fourth republics (1960 - 2003) respectively. Related concepts of legislature and democracy were clearly explained with concrete supportive scholarly literature. The historical evolution of legislative function in Nigeria was also explored to demonstrate the common but often neglected place of the legislature in democratic governance. Based on this, premise, proper constitutional roles of the legislature in the promotion of democracy in Nigeria were analysed to show clearly that democratic culture cannot be sustained without harmonious executive and legislature partnership. The prospects of this partnership were outlined with far reaching recommendations on how to promote healthy executive and legislature working relationship in present democratic dispensation in Nigeria...|$|R

The policy {{seems to have had}} little impact on rural areas (home to about 80% of the population), where birth rates never dropped below 2.5 children per female. Nevertheless, the Chinese government and others estimate that at least 250million births have been prevented by the policy.|$|E
25|$|The 240mm {{howitzer}} M1 {{was designed}} {{together with the}} longer ranged 8-inch Gun M1, and they both shared a related carriage. While use of the 8-inch gun was limited due to excessive bore wear and poor accuracy, the howitzer saw considerable action during World War II in Europe due to its effectiveness against difficult targets such as heavy concrete fortifications. It was also used in the Pacific campaign, notably in the Battle of Manila, but few targets there were heavily fortified enough <b>to</b> <b>justify</b> <b>its</b> use.|$|E
25|$|Some Japanese {{scholars}} {{interpret the}} Gwanggaeto Stele, erected in 414 by King Jangsu of Goguryeo, as describing a Japanese invasion {{in the southern}} portion of the Korean peninsula. However, Mohan claims that Goguryeo fabricated the Japanese invasion in order <b>to</b> <b>justify</b> <b>its</b> conquest of Baekje. If this stele was a dedication to a Korean king, {{it can be argued}} that it would logically highlight Korea's conquests and not dedicate it to a strange incident regarding Japan. In any case, because of these various possible interpretations, the circumstances surrounding the stele are still highly debated and inconclusive.|$|E

It is alleged that Awami League-aligned militias carried out large scale massacres of Biharis and other ethnic groups.|$|E
25|$|Fascism {{has been}} criticized for being ideologically dishonest. Major {{examples}} of ideological dishonesty have been identified in Italian fascism's changing relationship with German Nazism. Fascist Italy's official foreign policy positions were known to commonly utilize rhetorical ideological hyperbole <b>to</b> <b>justify</b> <b>its</b> actions, although during Dino Grandi's tenure as Italy's foreign minister the country engaged in realpolitik free of such fascist hyperbole. Italian fascism's stance towards German Nazism fluctuated from support from the late 1920s to 1934, when it celebrated Hitler's rise to power and meeting with Hitler in 1934; to opposition from 1934 to 1936 after the assassination of Italy's allied leader in Austria, Engelbert Dollfuss, by Austrian Nazis; and again back to support after 1936, when Germany was the only significant power that did not denounce Italy's invasion and occupation of Ethiopia.|$|E

40|$|AbstractGlobal {{competition}} forces {{companies to}} respond to fast changing market conditions by introducing new and innovative products rapidly and more often at competitive prices. Meeting these challenges sets strict requirements in order {{to cope with the}} variety of products during both ramp-up and production. The Reconfigurable Manufacturing System meets these challenges of high variety by adapting to the capacity and functionality needed when needed. Thus, implementing reconfigurable manufacturing affects the performance during both ramp-up and production. Still, the evaluation of the reconfigurable manufacturing potential has only received limited attention even though it is highly related <b>to</b> <b>justifying</b> <b>its</b> investment. One practical case based example of investigating the potential in reconfigurable manufacturing has though been carried out in high volume manufacturing. However, quantifying and investigating the potential in reconfigurable manufacturing for low volume manufacturing has to our knowledge not been carried out. Thus, {{the purpose of this paper}} is to measure the potential of reconfigurable manufacturing in low volume industry, carried out by use of a case-study in Danish industry. Thus, this paper presents an approach for decision support that can be applied by low volume manufacturing companies...|$|R
