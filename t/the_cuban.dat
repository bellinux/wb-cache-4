5|$|According to British writer Errol Fuller, aviculturalists are rumoured to have bred birds {{similar in}} {{appearance}} to <b>the</b> <b>Cuban</b> macaw. These birds, however, are reportedly larger in size than <b>the</b> <b>Cuban</b> macaw, having been bred from larger macaw species.|$|E
5|$|Betances also {{promoted}} {{direct intervention}} of Puerto Ricans in <b>the</b> <b>Cuban</b> independence struggle, which eventually happened in <b>the</b> <b>Cuban</b> War of Independence (1895–98). Spain had promoted political reform in Puerto Rico, {{and the local}} political climate was not conducive to a second revolution at the time. Therefore, Betances and the Puerto Rican revolutionaries ceded their caches of firearms hidden in Saint Thomas, Curaçao and Haiti to <b>the</b> <b>Cuban</b> rebels in October 1871, since their struggle was deemed as a priority.|$|E
5|$|Continuing to seek ways to oust Castro {{following}} the Bay of Pigs Invasion, Kennedy {{and his administration}} experimented with various ways of covertly facilitating the overthrow of <b>the</b> <b>Cuban</b> government. Significant hopes were pinned on a covert program named <b>the</b> <b>Cuban</b> Project, devised under the Kennedy administration in 1961.|$|E

50|$|In Havana, the Dodgers played {{series against}} the Boston Braves and the New York Yankees. While the Yankees were visiting, they played a game against a <b>Cuban</b> all-star team. <b>The</b> <b>Cubans</b> won behind <b>the</b> {{pitching}} of Connie Marrero, who held the Yankees to one run on four hits. A week later, the Dodgers faced <b>the</b> Havana <b>Cubans,</b> a minor league affiliate of the Washington Senators that was composed of Cuban players. Marrero again pitched {{as a member of}} <b>the</b> <b>Cubans,</b> struck out eight, and allowed four hits and one run, but the Dodgers held <b>the</b> <b>Cubans</b> scoreless to win the game 1-0.|$|R
50|$|At the time, Cuba {{had already}} in place an {{agreement}} with Neto to receive approximately $1,000 per Cuban (in Angola) making the Angolan invasion a very profitable venture for <b>the</b> <b>Cubans.</b> Any upset to this venture would not be tolerated by <b>the</b> <b>Cubans.</b>|$|R
5|$|During Castro's illness, which {{culminated in}} his 2008 resignation, Payá {{continued}} to criticize <b>the</b> <b>Cuban</b> government as it transferred power to Castro's brother Raúl. He called on Raul Castro to allow multiparty elections and free all political prisoners, and delivered a petition asking that <b>the</b> <b>Cuban</b> people be granted freedom of travel.|$|E
5|$|José Semidei Rodríguez from Yauco, Puerto Rico, {{fought in}} various battles in <b>the</b> <b>Cuban</b> War of Independence (1895–98).

Semidei Rodríguez continued to serve in Cuba as a diplomat upon his retirement from the military.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Cuban</b> {{national}} team next {{played in the}} United States during the 2006 World Baseball Classic (WBC). President George W.

The next American team to travel to Cuba were the Tampa Bay Rays, who will play an exhibition against <b>the</b> <b>Cuban</b> {{national team}} in March 2016.|$|E
50|$|Conning <b>the</b> <b>Cubans</b> : Eringer's trip to Cuba {{supposedly}} {{on behalf}} of Howard instilled trust with <b>the</b> <b>Cubans</b> who ran intelligence operations in Washington D.C., Eringer's interest in publishing Fidel Castro's memoirs helped ensure them that Eringer was the untrustworthy kind of person they could trust. <b>The</b> <b>Cubans</b> also expressed a desire have Eringer spy for them to attempt to hobble the political careers of proponents of sanctions against Cuba, Senator Robert Menéndez (NJ), Representative Ileana Ros(FL) and Mario Díaz-Balart (FL).|$|R
50|$|Branch Rickey had the Pittsburgh Pirates {{conduct their}} spring {{training}} in Havana, where they played 10 games against <b>the</b> <b>Cubans,</b> a Cuban all-star team managed by Rodolfo Fernández.

5|$|The {{second game}} {{was held at}} Oriole Park at Camden Yards in Baltimore on May 3, 1999, in front of 47,940 fans. By May 3, the Orioles had a 7–17 win-loss record in the 1999 MLB season. <b>The</b> <b>Cuban</b> {{national}} team, meanwhile, was stronger than during the first game, as the 1998–99 Cuban National Series had concluded and players who were not available for {{the first game of}} the exhibition joined <b>the</b> <b>Cuban</b> team. A 300-person delegation accompanied <b>the</b> <b>Cuban</b> team, including members of <b>the</b> <b>Cuban</b> media, students, and retired players. MLB requested the Federal Aviation Administration clear the airspace above Camden Yards for the game, in response to an attempt by a Miami-based pilot and veteran of the Bay of Pigs invasion, to drop anti-Castro leaflets over Estadio Latinoamericano during the first game.|$|E
5|$|All {{but one of}} {{the major}} iguana {{concentrations}} are either partially or fully protected by <b>the</b> <b>Cuban</b> government. Although no captive-breeding program exists within Cuba, the Centro Nacional de Areas Protegidas (the National Center for Protected Areas) has suggested it will explore this route in the future. In 1985 <b>the</b> <b>Cuban</b> government issued a commemorative peso depicting a Cuban iguana on the head side of the coin in an attempt to raise awareness for this animal.|$|E
5|$|Betances openly hated Estrada when {{he first}} met him in the late 1870s, but grew more {{tolerant}} of him with time, and even defended Estrada's actions as leader when he assumed control of <b>the</b> <b>Cuban</b> Revolutionary Party. The Puerto Rican affiliates to the Party viewed Estrada's leadership with great skepticism, since Estrada sympathized {{with the idea of}} having the United States intervene in <b>the</b> <b>Cuban</b> independence war to have the Spanish evicted from Cuba. They suspected that his weak leadership allowed opportunists to profit from an invasion and even suggest that the United States keep Puerto Rico in exchange for independence for Cuba. Some written evidence points to the truth of their affirmations, at least to the extent of wanting to have the Puerto Rican section of <b>the</b> <b>Cuban</b> Revolutionary Party shut down, which eventually did happen.|$|E
50|$|The Soviet Union gave both {{military}} {{and financial aid}} to <b>the</b> <b>Cubans.</b> <b>The</b> tonnage of Soviet military deliveries to Cuba {{throughout most of the}} 1980s exceeded deliveries in any year since the military build-up during <b>the</b> 1962 <b>Cuban</b> Missile Crisis.|$|R

50|$|An ambush by 32 Battalion {{was planned}} for 22 May 1988. The {{plan called for}} a mortar attack on an outpost south of Techipa which would draw out <b>the</b> <b>Cubans</b> who would be then ambushed. Members of 32 Battalion company ambushed a Cuban de-mining team before the mortaring began and then found {{themselves}} being attacked by four BRDM-2 armoured personnel carriers and from two other hidden outposts. Fleeing back to the mortar position under covering mortar fire, <b>the</b> <b>Cubans</b> finally caught up and attacked with the BRDM's resulting in the abandonment of three damaged Unimogs. The 32 Battalion company retreated again as BM-21s started shelling. <b>The</b> <b>Cubans</b> eventually gave up the chase and the company was {{able to return to}} the mortar position in search of the missing vehicles but these had been removed by <b>the</b> <b>Cubans.</b> <b>The</b> remaining missing 32 Battalion members turned up at Ruacana and Calueque the following day.|$|R
5|$|By June 12, <b>the</b> <b>Cuban</b> {{government}} had evacuated over 25,000people {{in the western}} portion of the country due {{to the threat of}} flooding. The National Hurricane Center recommended tropical storm warnings for the Isle of Youth and the Pinar del Río Province early on June 10, but they were not issued by <b>the</b> <b>Cuban</b> government.|$|E
5|$|Immediately after {{returning}} to Paris, Betances became a key contact for <b>the</b> <b>Cuban</b> insurgency in Paris. He made several fund raising efforts, including one that attempted to fund quinine shipments to <b>the</b> <b>Cuban</b> rebels, to ease their pain when infected by malaria in the island battlefields. These efforts outlasted the Pact of Zanjón, which ended the Ten Years' War in 1878. Betances also used his diplomatic contacts to guarantee humane treatment (and eventually freedom from imprisonment) to José Maceo, the brother of Antonio Maceo, the later military leader of <b>the</b> <b>Cuban</b> War of Independence, when both Antonio and José were arrested by the Spanish government in 1882. The Maceo brothers both escaped imprisonment, were recaptured in Gibraltar and {{turned over to the}} Spanish authorities, but José remained in jail long after Antonio regained his liberty and fled to New York City. Betances even used Lord Gladstone as a mediator, and attempted to convince him of having Jamaica (where his family had properties) join an Antillean Federation.|$|E
5|$|In April 1896 Betances {{was granted}} {{diplomatic}} credentials {{on behalf of}} the revolutionary government of Cuba. He became an active fund raiser and recruiter on behalf of <b>the</b> <b>Cuban</b> pro-independence movement. He also served as press officer and intelligence contact for <b>the</b> <b>Cuban</b> rebels in exile, and attempted to coordinate support for the pro-independence movement in the Philippines.|$|E

50|$|In 1987, Modise {{as head of}} MK {{requested}} the assistance of <b>the</b> <b>Cubans</b> at meetings in Lusaka and Harare. These relations were maintained throughout the 1980s. Further talk included the Russians and discussions were held regarding {{the shape of the}} expected political settlement in South Africa. The ANC delegation, led by Oliver Tambo, included Joe Modise, Joe Slovo, Alfred Nzo, and Thabo Mbeki. <b>The</b> <b>Cubans</b> were represented by Jorge Risquet, and the Soviets by Anatoly Dobrynin, who had become the replacement for Boris Ponomarey. In May 1990 under Modise’s orders, Chris Hani, then Chief Staff of MK, asked <b>the</b> <b>Cubans</b> to help train officers for the post-apartheid army.|$|R

5|$|In {{general the}} species is in decline, more quickly on the {{mainland}} than on the outlying islets. <b>The</b> <b>Cuban</b> mainland populations have been declining {{at a rate of}} over 1% per year for the last 10years. <b>The</b> <b>Cuban</b> iguana is no longer found on the northeastern coast of Havana, the Hicacos Peninsula, or Cayo Largo, areas where it was found in great numbers some 30 to 40years ago.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many other}} Latin American intellectuals, Vargas Llosa was {{initially}} {{a supporter of}} <b>the</b> <b>Cuban</b> revolutionary government of Fidel Castro. He studied Marxism in depth as a university student and was later persuaded by communist ideals after the success of <b>the</b> <b>Cuban</b> Revolution. Gradually, Vargas Llosa {{came to believe that}} socialism was incompatible with what he considered to be general liberties and freedoms. The official rupture between the writer and the policies of <b>the</b> <b>Cuban</b> government occurred with the so-called 'Padilla Affair', when the Castro regime imprisoned the poet Heberto Padilla for a month in 1971. Vargas Llosa, along with other intellectuals of the time, wrote to Castro protesting <b>the</b> <b>Cuban</b> political system and its imprisonment of the artist. Vargas Llosa has identified himself with liberalism rather than extreme left-wing political ideologies ever since. Since he relinquished his earlier leftism, he has opposed both left- and right-wing authoritarian regimes.|$|E
5|$|On September25, the {{government}} of Spain approved $1.07million in food assistance for Cuba. On September29, {{the government}} of Japan sent water equipment, soap, towels, and emergency health kits worth $119,200 to the affected areas in Cuba. By February 1999, the Japanese Government had provided Cuba with nearly $1million in disaster funds. An emergency cash grant of $50,000 was also given to Cuba by the United Nations. <b>The</b> <b>Cuban</b> Red Cross mobilized about 8,700 volunteers to assist victims of the storm in the 900 shelters set up throughout the island. Plastic sheeting was to be distributed {{for about a week}} for residents to patch holes in the roof of their homes. The National Council of Churches sent relief goods valued at $70,000 to <b>the</b> <b>Cuban</b> Government on October9. By February 1999, <b>the</b> <b>Cuban</b> Red Cross distributed over 30,000 sheets of roofing to nearly 5,500 people in three provinces.

5|$|Oswaldo Payá Sardiñas (29 February 1952– 22 July 2012) was a Cuban {{political}} activist.

He attracted international attention for organizing a petition drive known as the Varela Project, in which 25,000 signatories petitioned <b>the</b> <b>Cuban</b> government to guarantee {{freedom of speech and}} freedom of assembly as well as to institute a multi-party democracy. In recognition of his work, he received the European Parliament's Sakharov Prize and People in Need's Homo Homini Award.|$|E
5|$|Since {{detailed}} {{descriptions of}} extinct macaws exist only for the species on Cuba, {{it is impossible to}} determine the species' relationships. It has been suggested that the closest mainland relative of <b>the</b> <b>Cuban</b> macaw is the scarlet macaw (Ara macao), due to the similar distribution of red and blue in their plumage, and the presence of a white patch around the eyes, naked except for lines of small red feathers. Furthermore, the range of the scarlet macaw extends to the margins of the Caribbean Sea. <b>The</b> <b>Cuban</b> macaw is distinct due to its lack of a yellow shoulder patch, its all-black beak, and its smaller size. The two also share a species of feather mite, which supports their relationship. James Greenway believed the scarlet macaw and <b>the</b> <b>Cuban</b> macaw formed a superspecies with the other extinct species suggested to have inhabited Jamaica, Hispaniola and Guadeloupe.|$|E
