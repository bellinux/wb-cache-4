5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>Met</b> and the District had {{withdrawn}} from the ELR in 1906, services were provided by the South Eastern Railway, the London, Brighton, and South Coast Railway (LB) and the Great Eastern Railway. Both <b>the</b> <b>Met</b> and the District {{wanted to see the}} line electrified, but could not justify the whole cost themselves. Discussions continued, and in 1911 it was agreed that the ELR would be electrified with the UERL providing power and <b>the</b> <b>Met</b> the train service. Parliamentary powers were obtained in 1912 and through services restarted on 31 March 1913, <b>the</b> <b>Met</b> running two trains an hour from both the SER's and the LB's New Cross stations to South Kensington and eight shuttles an hour alternately from the New Cross stations to Shoreditch.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the state}} of the {{relationship}} between the two companies the MS was unhappy being wholly reliant on <b>the</b> <b>Met</b> for access to London and, unlike its railway to the north, south of Aylesbury there were several speed restrictions and long climbs, up to 1 in 90 in places. In 1898, the MS and the GWR jointly presented a bill to Parliament for a railway (the Great Western and Great Central Joint Railway) with short connecting branches from Grendon Underwood, north of Quainton Road, to Ashendon and from Northolt to Neasden. <b>The</b> <b>Met</b> protested, claiming that the bill was 'incompatible with the spirit and terms' of the agreements between it and the MS The MS was given authority to proceed, but <b>the</b> <b>Met</b> was given the right to compensation. A temporary agreement was made to allow four MS coal trains a day over <b>the</b> <b>Met</b> lines from 26 July 1898. The MS wished these trains to also use the GWR route from Aylesbury via Princes Risborough into London, whereas <b>the</b> <b>Met</b> considered this was not covered by the agreement. A train scheduled to use the GWR route was not allowed access to <b>the</b> <b>Met</b> lines at Quainton Road in the early hours of 30 July 1898 and returned north. A subsequent court hearing found in the Met's favour, as it was a temporary arrangement.|$|E
5|$|The MS {{changed its}} name to the Great Central Railway (GCR) in 1897 and the Great Central Main Line from London Marylebone to Manchester Central opened for {{passenger}} traffic on 15 March 1899. Negotiations about the line between the GCR and <b>the</b> <b>Met</b> took several years and in 1906 it was agreed that two tracks from Canfield Place to Harrow would be leased to the GCR for £20,000 a year and the Metropolitan and Great Central Joint Railway was created, leasing the line from Harrow to Verney Junction and the Brill branch for £44,000 a year, the GCR guaranteeing to place at least £45,000 of traffic on the line. Aylesbury station, which had been jointly run by the GWR and <b>the</b> <b>Met,</b> was placed with a joint committee of the Great Western & Great Central and Metropolitan & Great Central Joint Committees, and generally known as Aylesbury Joint Station. <b>The</b> <b>Met</b> & GC Joint Committee took over the operation of the stations and line, but had no rolling stock. <b>The</b> <b>Met</b> provided the management and the GCR the accounts for the first five years before the companies switched functions, then alternating every five years until 1926. <b>The</b> <b>Met</b> maintained the line south of milepost 28.5 (south of Great Missenden), the GCR to the north.|$|E
5000|$|After the Piazza trade, <b>the</b> <b>Mets</b> played well, {{but missed}} the 1998 postseason {{by only one}} game. With five games left in <b>the</b> season, <b>the</b> <b>Mets</b> could not win a single game against both the Montreal Expos at home and the Atlanta Braves on the road. [...] Following the 1998 season <b>the</b> <b>Mets</b> re-signed Mike Piazza to a seven-year, $91 million contract, <b>the</b> <b>Mets</b> traded Todd Hundley to the Los Angeles Dodgers. Trades netted <b>the</b> <b>Mets</b> Roger Cedeño, Armando Benítez, and <b>the</b> <b>Mets</b> signed free agents Robin Ventura, Rickey Henderson, and Bobby Bonilla.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Mets,</b> {{handicapped}} after season-ending {{injuries to}} Pedro Martínez and Orlando 'El Duque' Hernandez, had defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers 3 games to {{none in the}} NL Division Series, while the Cardinals had defeated the San Diego Padres 3 games to 1. <b>The</b> <b>Mets</b> had home-field advantage due to their better record {{in the regular season}} (<b>the</b> <b>Mets</b> were 97-65, <b>the</b> Cardinals 83-78). <b>The</b> <b>Mets</b> and Cardinals previously <b>met</b> in <b>the</b> 2000 NLCS, which <b>the</b> <b>Mets</b> won in 5 games.

50|$|Following the {{crushing}} defeat, <b>the</b> <b>Mets</b> faced <b>the</b> Washington Nationals in a pivotal three game series, {{considering that the}} Nationals were 3 games ahead of <b>the</b> <b>Mets,</b> and a New York sweep could give <b>the</b> <b>Mets</b> <b>the</b> division lead, while a Nationals series win might do <b>the</b> <b>Mets</b> in for good. Prior to the first game, <b>the</b> <b>Mets</b> got their big outfield bat, Yoenis Céspedes, in a trade with the Tigers for minor league pitchers Michael Fulmer and Luis Cessa. That night, in a pivotal game against their division rivals, the Washington Nationals, Flores hit a walk-off {{home run in the}} 12th inning, winning the game for <b>the</b> <b>Mets</b> by a score of 2-1. Flores had also driven in <b>the</b> other <b>Mets</b> run earlier in the game. It was also the only walk-off home run <b>the</b> <b>Mets</b> hit in <b>the</b> regular season.|$|R
5|$|To promote {{travel by}} the {{underground}} railways in London a joint marketing arrangement was agreed. In 1908, <b>the</b> <b>Met</b> joined this scheme, which included maps, joint publicity and through ticketing. UD signs were used outside stations in Central London. Eventually the UERL controlled all the underground railways except <b>the</b> <b>Met</b> and the Waterloo & City and introduced station name boards {{with a red}} disc and a blue bar. <b>The</b> <b>Met</b> responded with station boards with a red diamond and a blue bar.|$|E
5|$|A pair of {{single-track}} tunnels at King's Cross {{connecting the}} GNR to <b>the</b> <b>Met</b> opened on 1 October 1863 when the GNR began running services, the GWR returning {{the same day}} with through suburban trains from such places as Windsor. By early autumn 1864 <b>the</b> <b>Met</b> had sufficient carriages and locomotives to run its own trains and increase the frequency to six trains an hour.|$|E
5|$|According to Nick Davies in The Guardian, the {{statement}} {{was the result of}} an intense argument in the Met's press office, after an earlier draft had been rejected. He wrote that both <b>the</b> <b>Met</b> and IPCC said {{the statement}} represented the truth as they understood it at the time, and that there had been no allegation at that point that Tomlinson had come into contact with police. Davies asked why the IPCC were involved if they had not realized there had been police contact. He alleged that senior sources within <b>the</b> <b>Met</b> said privately that the assault on Tomlinson had been spotted by the police control room at Cobalt Street in south London, and that a chief inspector on the ground had also reported it. <b>The</b> <b>Met</b> issued a statement saying they had checked with every chief inspector who had been part of Operation Glencoe, and that none of them had called in such a report.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Mets</b> hired Green as a scout. During the 1993 season, <b>the</b> <b>Mets</b> fired manager Jeff Torborg, {{and hired}} Green for the position. During his tenure with <b>the</b> <b>Mets,</b> {{he was under}} [...]500 at 229-283 (.447). <b>The</b> <b>Mets</b> fired Green in 1996, {{replacing}} him with Bobby Valentine. In 1998, Green returned to the Phillies as a senior advisor to the General Manager.|$|R
50|$|On December 12 <b>the</b> <b>Mets</b> traded Scott Schoeneweis to the Arizona Diamondbacks for Connor Robertson. On January 12, <b>the</b> <b>Mets</b> signed RHP Tim Redding to {{a one-year}} contract. <b>The</b> <b>Mets</b> signed Alex Cora to a one-year $2 million contract. <b>The</b> <b>Mets</b> signed Freddy García and Rob Mackowiak to minor league deals.

5|$|Although the GWR {{agreed to}} {{contribute}} £175,000 {{and a similar}} sum was promised by the GNR, sufficient funds to make a start on construction had not been raised {{by the end of}} 1857. Costs were reduced by cutting back part of the route at the western end so that it did not connect directly to the GWR station, and by dropping the line south of Farringdon. In 1858, Pearson arranged a deal between <b>the</b> <b>Met</b> and the City of London Corporation whereby <b>the</b> <b>Met</b> bought land it needed around the new Farringdon Road from the City for £179,000 and the City purchased £200,000 worth of shares. The route changes were approved by Parliament in August 1859, meaning that <b>the</b> <b>Met</b> finally had the funding to match its obligations and construction could begin.|$|E
5|$|An opera {{that was}} belittled in 1987 by major New York critics– as a CNN Opera of no lasting merit when Houston Grand Opera premiered it– has clearly {{remained}} relevant. Reaching <b>the</b> <b>Met</b> {{for the first}} time, it is now hailed as a classic.|$|E
5|$|Concerned {{that the}} GNR would divert its Moorgate {{services}} over the City Widened Lines to run via the GN, <b>the</b> <b>Met</b> sought {{to take over}} the GN A bill was presented in 1912–13 to allow this with extensions to join the GN to the inner circle between Moorgate and Liverpool Street and to the Waterloo & City line. The takeover was authorised, but the new railway works were removed from the bill after opposition from City property owners. The following year, a bill was jointly presented by <b>the</b> <b>Met</b> and GNR with amended plans that would have also allowed a connection between the GN and GNR at Finsbury Park. Opposed, this time by the North London Railway, this bill was withdrawn.|$|E
5000|$|Collins {{began the}} 1969 season with <b>the</b> <b>Mets.</b> He played 16 games for <b>the</b> <b>Mets,</b> all at third base, getting 40 at-bats but only batting [...]150. His last game with <b>the</b> <b>Mets</b> before being demoted to <b>the</b> <b>Mets</b> new class-AAA {{affiliate}} in Tidewater was on May 4.

5000|$|Machado {{started his}} career with <b>the</b> <b>Mets.</b> He made his MLB debut in [...] and started the [...] season with <b>the</b> <b>Mets</b> as well. He was demoted to the Class AAA Tidewater team, where he saved eight games before being {{recalled}} to <b>the</b> <b>Mets</b> in July. At <b>the</b> time, <b>the</b> <b>Mets</b> were looking for consistent right-handed relief pitchers, having traded Roger McDowell the previous year.|$|R
5000|$|Murphy, {{despite his}} long {{association}} with <b>the</b> <b>Mets,</b> never openly rooted {{for the team}} from the booth.

5|$|From 1891, more {{locomotives}} {{were needed}} {{for work on}} the extension line from Baker Street into the country. Four C Class (0-4-4) locomotives, a development of South Eastern Railway's 'Q' Class, were received in 1891. In 1894, two D Class locomotives were bought to run between Aylesbury and Verney Junction. These were not fitted with the condensing equipment needed to work south of Finchley Road. Four more were delivered in 1895 with condensing equipment, although these were prohibited working south of Finchley Road. In 1896, two E Class (0-4-4) locomotives were built at Neasden works, followed by one in 1898 to replace the original Class A No. 1, damaged in an accident. Four more were built by Hawthorn Leslie & Co in 1900 and 1901. To cope with the growing freight traffic on the extension line, <b>the</b> <b>Met</b> received four F Class (0-6-2) locomotives in 1901, similar to the E Class except for the wheel arrangement and without steam heat. In 1897 and 1899, <b>the</b> <b>Met</b> received two 0-6-0 saddle tank locomotives to a standard Peckett design. Unclassified by <b>the</b> <b>Met,</b> these were generally used for shunting at Neasden and Harrow.|$|E
5|$|In 1895, the MS {{put forward}} a bill to Parliament to build two tracks from Wembley Park to Canfield Place, near Finchley Road station, to allow its express trains to pass the Met's {{stopping}} service. <b>The</b> <b>Met</b> protested before {{it was agreed that}} it would build the lines for the MS's exclusive use. When rebuilding bridges over the lines from Wembley Park to Harrow for the MS, seeing a future need <b>the</b> <b>Met</b> quadrupled the line {{at the same time and}} the MS requested exclusive use of two tracks. The MS had the necessary authority to connect to the Circle at Marylebone, but <b>the</b> <b>Met</b> suggested onerous terms. At the time the MS was running short of money and abandoned the link.|$|E
5|$|In 1902 the Whitechapel & Bow Railway was opened, {{linking the}} District Railway at Whitechapel to the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway (LT) at an {{above-ground}} junction at Bow, {{to the west}} of Bromley-by-Bow station, and some District services were extended from Whitechapel to East Ham. When the line was electrified in 1906 services to Richmond were withdrawn and the western termini became Hammersmith and Kensington (Addison Road), and to the east services were diverted from the ELR to Whitechapel, until the ELR was electrified in 1914 and services ran from Hammersmith to New Cross (SER) and New Cross (LB). The 6-car electric multiple units were jointly owned by <b>the</b> <b>Met</b> and GWR until 1923 when the GWR sold theirs to <b>the</b> <b>Met.</b>|$|E
50|$|After {{the regular}} season ended, <b>the</b> <b>Mets</b> played a one-game playoff against the Cincinnati Reds, Al Leiter pitched the best game of his Met career as he hurled a two-hit complete-game shutout to advance <b>the</b> <b>Mets</b> to <b>the</b> playoffs. In <b>the</b> NLDS, <b>the</b> <b>Mets</b> {{defeated}} <b>the</b> Arizona Diamondbacks 3 games to 1. The series-clinching victory included a walk-off home run by backup catcher Todd Pratt. <b>The</b> <b>Mets</b> would lose however in the 1999 National League Championship Series to the Atlanta Braves, in six exciting games which included the famous Grand Slam Single by Robin Ventura to win game 5 for <b>the</b> <b>Mets.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Mets</b> were at one point down 3-0 in the series.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Mets</b> regular {{second baseman}} in 1984 was Wally Backman, a switch hitter who {{was much better}} when batting lefty. <b>The</b> <b>Mets</b> needed a {{right-handed}} hitting second baseman to platoon with Backman.

His first game for <b>the</b> <b>Mets</b> in 1984 was on May 6. Chapman played 75 games for <b>the</b> <b>Mets</b> in 1984, finishing with a batting average of [...]289, a slugging percentage of [...]401 and an on-base percentage of [...]356, helping <b>the</b> <b>Mets</b> finish 2nd in the National League East. Chapman also posted a league average fielding percentage in 57 games at second base of [...]979 that season, also playing 3 games at third base for <b>the</b> <b>Mets.</b>|$|R
50|$|His 1982 {{performance}} {{earned him}} a late season promotion to <b>the</b> <b>Mets.</b> He made his major league debut for <b>the</b> <b>Mets</b> on September 29, 1982 against the Chicago Cubs. In total, he played 2 games for <b>the</b> <b>Mets</b> in 1982, going hitless in 4 at-bats.|$|R
5|$|In 1904, <b>the</b> <b>Met</b> {{opened a}} 10.5MW {{coal-fired}} power station at Neasden, which supplied 11kV 33.3Hz current to five substations that converted this to 600VDC using rotary converters.|$|E
5|$|In 1912, Selbie, then General Manager, {{thought that}} some professionalism was needed and {{suggested}} a company be formed {{to take over}} from the Surplus Lands Committee to develop estates near the railway. World War I delayed these plans and it was 1919, with expectation of a housing boom, before Metropolitan Railway Country Estates Limited (MRCE) was formed. Concerned that Parliament might reconsider the unique position <b>the</b> <b>Met</b> held, the railway company sought legal advice, which was that although <b>the</b> <b>Met</b> had authority to hold land, it had none to develop it. An independent company was created, although {{all but one of}} its directors were also directors of <b>the</b> <b>Met.</b> MRCE developed estates at Kingsbury Garden Village near Neasden, Wembley Park, Cecil Park and Grange Estate at Pinner, and the Cedars Estate at Rickmansworth, and created places such as Harrow Garden Village.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{the railway}} was worked by GWR broad-gauge Metropolitan Class steam {{locomotives}} and rolling stock.
