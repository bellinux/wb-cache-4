5000|$|To {{celebrate}} BMW Motorsport 20th anniversary, BMW {{had built}} 20 specially equipped Euro-spec M5s in late 1992. These, {{based on the}} 3.8 L engine were only in Mugello Red (274) and {{had a number of}} aesthetic trim upgrades such as carbon fiber dash panels and special rear view mirrors. Unique seat center & door <b>trim</b> <b>fabric</b> was matched with Alcantara. Alcantara was also used on the steering wheel, shift lever & parking brake lever. Red seatbelts with [...] "BMW Motorsport" [...] were also included.|$|E
50|$|Interiors were {{available}} in four colors: black, nut brown, sky blue, and wine red. With the only exceptions of the A and C-pillar inner plastic moldings, the windshield and rear hatch inner plastic surrounding moldings, the door latches, the door cranks, the side armrests, the door ashtrays, {{the steering wheel and}} column plus the dashboard the rest of the interior is 100% made and designed in Mexico by VAM's styling department. The most striking features of the Lerma's interior design relied on the its door panels, side panels, trunk and seats. The first two incorporated high <b>trim</b> <b>fabric</b> and lower portion horizontal carpet inserts with fake horizontal chrome (lower portion) and woodgrain (upper portion) moldings. The seats consisted of a fixed rear bench seat and individual recling front wide bucket seats with adjustable headrests. The pattern on these seats is nothing short of impressive, incorporating a design of four squared buttons forming another square over the seat bottoms and backs. These portions are actually outer ones over {{the main body of the}} seat and is not stretched out, giving the feeling and impression of having a cushion over both the main seat bottom and back. The bases of both sets of seats are covered in carpet. The VAM Lerma was the only four-door VAM car not to incorporate a fixed front bench seat, making it also the only four-door VAM car to incorporate individual (reclining) front seats. The Lerma's trunk is unique among VAM (and AMC) cars alike. It is a closed compartment covered in carpet and incorporated both rear stereo speakers at each side of the lid. The lid itself is hinged to the back of the frame near the rear seat back and had a fixed rear light similar to the ones used in the hood, it would flick on and off depending on the position of the lid. Despite how truly elegant the trunk looked, its design made to follow the side lines of the interior of the car as well as the dimensions of the massive rear hatch glass ended up creating a truly low amount of trunk space for barely anything other than the spare tire. This situation forced owners to buy an external roof rack fixed to the side drip rails in order to be able to carry any luggage, which might compromise the looks of the car.|$|E

50|$|As {{the role}} of women {{increased}} in car-purchase decisions, automakers began to hire female designers. Hudson, wanting a female perspective on automotive design, hired Elizabeth Ann Thatcher, who later became Betty Thatcher Oros, in 1939. A graduate of the Cleveland School of Arts (now Cleveland Institute of Art) with a major in Industrial Design, she became one of America's first female automotive designers. Her contributions to the 1941 Hudson included exterior trim with side lighting, interior instrument panel, interiors and interior <b>trim</b> <b>fabrics.</b> She designed for Hudson from 1939 into 1941, leaving the company when she married Joe Oros, then a designer for Cadillac. He later became head of the design team at Ford that created the Mustang.|$|R

40|$|Handmade {{textiles}} {{have been}} vitally important in many traditional societies where they achieved cultural, symbolic, and economic significance. Yet today, comparatively little urban production survives except in Fez, Morocco, where an astonishing variety of age-old handmade textile traditions exists, based on local demand especially for weddings. This video documentary provides {{a rare opportunity}} to see the making and use of eight different types of fabrics and clothing, to meet artisans, merchants and consumers, and to attend a wedding where handmade fabrics symbolize regional pride. Among the woven, embroidered, and <b>trimming</b> <b>fabrics</b> is one 100 m of exceptional international significance. Elaborately patterned textiles are still woven on huge drawlooms, skillfully operated by two men, just as they were for more than one thousand years until replaced by jacquard looms. The ancient drawloom is actually an early computer wherein a weave structure (program) is tied on for continuous use and designs (files) are tied on any time and stored for retrieval when needed.

50|$|In the {{finishing}} process of manufacturing textiles, after the cloth is woven, {{it goes through}} processes such as washing, fulling, raising the nap and trimming the nap. After the nap is <b>trimmed,</b> the <b>fabric</b> is considered finished. The raising process, which draws out {{the ends of the}} fibres, is done on both woollen and cotton fabric. Flannelette is a cotton fabric that goes through this process. There are ways to 'raise the nap', most of which involve wire brushes such as raising cards. Originally, dried teasel pods were used and were still preferred for use on woollen cloth for a long time. Woollen fabrics, which must be damp when raising the nap, are then dried and stretched before the nap is trimmed or sheared. Cotton cloth goes straight to the shearing process, where the nap gets trimmed to ensure that all the raised fibres are the same length.|$|R

The Civil War had far-reaching effects on American society, the political system, and the economy. Some historians argue that the war had little direct influence on the continuity of Western fashion. However, detailed examination of Peterson's Magazine before and during the war provides a clearer picture of how the war affected American fashions. Written content, patterns and illustrations were analyzed during the years 1859, 1861, 1863 and 1864 to determine quantity and quality of references of numerous categories including apparel, accessory, color, <b>trim</b> and <b>fabric</b> types. Analysis revealed that quantities of almost every category decreased beginning in 1861 to lesser levels than those of 1859. However, the year 1863 revealed significant unexpected increased in all categories. To conclude, the war resulted in lesser availability of and access to various types of both foreign and domestic <b>fabrics,</b> <b>trims</b> and fashions, as well as an increase in frugality and economy of dress. Further research will provide a clearer understanding {{of the effects of the}} Civil War on the American economy, culture, and textile and apparel production during the mid-nineteenth century, as well as the changing roles of women in American society...|$|R

Magazines from the 1940s and 50s feature apron-adorned women in nearly every advertisement that is related to housework or cooking. Aprons were a selling feature for irons, kitchen appliances, food products and more. The 1950s brought out the half-aprons of highly starched cotton, feedsack and sheer <b>fabric</b> <b>trimmed</b> with lace for special occasions.

A 2.1-litre Turbo Diesel was also produced for LHD European {{markets in the}} 1982-84 period. The Fuego Turbo (manual transmission only) was added in 1983 {{to coincide with the}} midlife facelift. This facelift included a new front grille, plastic trim on the bumpers, revised dashboard on LHD models, new wheel design, modernised interior <b>trim</b> and <b>fabrics</b> (brown/sepia (coffee brown) and black/ash (grey) with striped velour for the Turbo, and ash or sepia for the other models sold in European specification. Interior colour now depended on exterior colour, eliminating the large choice of customised options for the earlier models. The facelifted GTX was also offered with the 2.2litre EFI engine from the Renault 25 in certain LHD markets (generally where the Fuego Turbo was not sold).
