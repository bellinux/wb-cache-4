500|$|The raid {{did not go}} as planned.

500|$|Sandra {{normally}} {{went out}} with her boyfriend, John Hankins, on Thursday nights, but had decided to change her night off and thus, had seen him the previous day. The two last spoke on the telephone at about 8:00pm on 7November. After putting the younger children to bed, at about 8:55pm she asked Veronica if she would like a cup of tea, before heading downstairs to the basement kitchen to make one. As she entered the room, she was bludgeoned {{to death with a}} piece of bandaged lead pipe. Her killer then placed her body into a canvas mailsack. Meanwhile, wondering what had delayed her nanny, Lady Lucan descended from the first floor to see what had happened. She called to Rivett {{from the top of the}} basement stairs and was herself attacked. As she screamed for her life, her attacker told her to [...] "shut up". Lady Lucan later claimed at that moment to have recognised her husband's voice. The two apparently continued to fight; she bit his fingers, and when he threw her face down to the carpet, managed to turn around and squeeze his testicles, causing him to release his grip on her throat and give up the fight. When she asked where Rivett was, Lucan was at first evasive, but eventually admitted to having killed her. Terrified, Lady Lucan told him she could help him escape if only he would remain at the house for a few days, to allow her injuries to heal. Lucan walked upstairs and sent his daughter to bed, then went into one of the bedrooms. When Veronica entered, to lie on the bed, he told her to put towels down first to avoid staining the bedding. Lucan asked her if she had any barbiturates and went <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> <b>to</b> get a wet towel, supposedly to clean Veronica's face. Lady Lucan realised her husband would be unable to hear her from the bathroom, and made her escape, running outside to a nearby public house, the Plumbers Arms.|$|E
2500|$|Vélez's {{death was}} recounted in the 1959 book Hollywood Babylon by Kenneth Anger. In Anger's retelling, Vélez planned {{to stage a}} {{beautiful}} suicide scene atop her satin bed, but the Seconal she took did not mix well with the [...] "Mexi-Spice Last Supper" [...] that she had eaten earlier that evening. As a result, Anger said she became violently ill. Instead of dying on her bed as planned, Anger claimed that a dazed Vélez stumbled <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> <b>to</b> vomit, slipped on the bathroom floor tile and fell head first into the toilet, where she subsequently drowned. Anger claimed that Vélez's [...] "chambermaid" [...] Juanita found her mistress the next morning. Despite the fact that Anger's version of events contradicts published reports and the official ruling, his story became something of an urban legend and is often repeated as fact - it was recounted in the pilot episode of the television comedy series Frasier. Vélez's biographer, Michelle Vogel, points out {{that it would have}} been [...] "virtually impossible" [...] for Vélez to have [...] "stumbled to the bathroom" [...] or even get off her bed after having consumed such a large amount of Seconal. Seconal is noted for being fast acting even in small doses and Vélez's death was likely instantaneous. Her death certificate lists [...] "Seconal poisoning" [...] due to [...] "ingestion of Seconal" [...] as the cause of death, not drowning. Further, there was also no evidence to suggest Vélez had vomited.|$|E
