In Freddie Flintoff: Hidden Side of Sport {{broadcast}} on the BBC One in 2012, he talks candidly in moving interviews with Steve Harmison, Vinnie Jones and Ricky Hatton and others about the serious effects of depression.

25|$|During a tag team {{match on}} April 3, 1983 {{he was injured}} by Dynamite Kid; two days later, {{he was forced to}} vacate the NWA World Junior Heavyweight title after it became clear that he would need time off to recuperate. However, once the {{determined}} Tiger Mask recovered, he regained his NWA World Junior Heavyweight Championship by defeating Kuniaki Kobayashi on June 2, 1983, making him a simultaneous NWA/WWF Jr. champion for the second time. By 1983, however, Sayama started feeling dissatisfied as he hated the politics behind-the-scenes. As a result, he announced his retirement from active competition on August 12, 1983. It was a shock to the wrestling world, as Tiger Mask was going to retire while he was at <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>game</b> and as the holder of two Junior Heavyweight Championships. Both titles were declared vacant, as he became a trainer to martial arts fighters.|$|E
25|$|Martínez {{started the}} 2006 season at <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>game.</b> At {{the end of}} May, he was 5–1 with a 2.50 ERA, with 88 strikeouts and 17 walks and 44 hits allowed in 76 innings; Martínez's record was worse than it could have been, with the Mets bullpen costing him two victories. However, during his May 26 start against the Florida Marlins, Martínez was {{instructed}} by the umpires to change his undershirt. He slipped in the corridor, injuring his hip, and his promising season curdled. The effect was not immediately apparent; although Martínez lost the Marlins game, his following start was a scintillating 0–0 duel with Arizona's Brandon Webb. But after that, beginning on June 6, Martínez went 4–7 with a 7.10 ERA {{in a series of}} spotty starts interrupted twice by stays on the disabled list. A right calf injury plagued him for the last two months of the season. After Martínez was removed from an ineffective September 15 outing, television cameras found him in the Mets dugout, apparently crying. Subsequent MRI exams revealed a torn muscle in Martínez's left calf, and a torn rotator cuff. Martínez underwent surgery which sidelined him for most of the 2007 season.|$|E

The album features {{a tribute to}} John Lennon, [...] "Roll On John", and the title track is a 14 minute song about {{the sinking of the}} Titanic. Reviewing Tempest for Rolling Stone, Will Hermes gave the album five out of five stars, writing: [...] "Lyrically, Dylan is at <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>game,</b> joking around, dropping wordplay and allegories that evade pat readings and quoting other folks' words like a freestyle rapper on fire."

As team captain at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, he was noted for helping his teammates understand everything that was going on around them. His athleticism and personal courage have been praised by those who know him, such as Michael Page, chef d’equipe for the 1986 US World Championship team, who recounted how Plumb medaled at the competition despite three broken ribs.

[...] Filmfare gave the film 4 out of 5 stars and stated, [...] "Barfi! is that rare film that can make you smile and make you cry in the same scene. Its technical brilliance is only outdone by its emotional complexity and depth. Pritam's music adds a nice silent-era charm to this already fantastic story, making it an occasion when words simply aren’t enough." [...] Raja Sen of Rediff.com has given 3.5/5 stars and wrote, [...] "Barfi! is a well-crafted script with an intriguing back-and-forth narrative but it all goes south towards the end." ...|$|E

According to an October 12, 1912, issue of The Sporting News, Wagner did not give his consent to appear on the baseball card. In response to the authorization request letter sent by John Gruber, a Pittsburgh sportswriter hired by the ATC to seek Wagner's permission, Wagner wrote that he [...] "did not care to have his picture in a package of cigarettes."

Speaking to series creators Michelle Grace Hunder and Claudia Sangiorgi Dalimore, Arena goes on to talk about the importance of female solidarity, mentioning how competition between women can be (and has been) dismantled by supportive relationships and encouragement of other women. Arena says [...] "Get out of the ring. Take your boxing gloves off. Be convinced in the argument of your thoughts and your dreams".|$|E

2500|$|Julieta had a warm {{reception}} at the Cannes Film Festival, which was followed by extremely positive reactions from French film critics.

[...] Numerous sources such as Cahiers du Cinéma, Le Monde, Positif, Ouest-France and Le Parisien gave the film their highest five-star rating. [...] Le Monde called it [...] "a beautiful film of very pure sadness" [...] and La Croix who thought the theme of guilt was a welcome new addition to Almodóvar's work, calling Julieta [...] "a beautiful and intense film". L'Express thought Almodóvar had returned to <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>game</b> with Julieta, calling it [...] "a work constantly on the edge, never overwhelmed by its own emotions, deliberately cold [...] even austere". Libération gave a positive review, but felt the film was [...] "too well-oiled" [...] which prevented the drama of the story from [...] "truly expressing all its power of emotional attraction".

Rob Harvilla of The Village Voice credited him for [...] "taking objectively terrible ideas—getting emotionally involved with this guy, for example, given his penchant for 'Patrónin' and general sexual profligacy—and making them seem like brilliant ideas". The Nationals Alex Macpherson felt that he has an [...] "apparent inability to separate the sublime from the ridiculous" [...] and his competence as a musician: [...] "He covers all bases, and erodes the differences between them". Michael Cragg of The Guardian said that [...] "Love King doesn't win points for subtlety but, {{as an example of}} a producer at <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>game,</b> it's second to none".
