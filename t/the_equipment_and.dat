5|$|Returning to the United Kingdom in 1892 Calthrop {{established}} a railway engineering consulting practice in Liverpool, where {{three of his}} brothers had started a stockfeed company. Soon Calthrop had entered into a partnership with them and {{spent much of the}} next two years designing equipment for feed production. He took out a number of patents relating to <b>the</b> <b>equipment</b> <b>and</b> to refrigerated transport.|$|E
5|$|Between late February {{and early}} March 1945, with {{the advance of}} the Allied armies, all {{production}} of notes at Sachsenhausen ceased. <b>The</b> <b>equipment</b> <b>and</b> supplies were packed and transported, with the prisoners, to the Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp in Austria, arriving on 12 March. Shortly afterwards Kr√ºger arranged for a further transfer to the Redl-Zipf series of tunnels where they were to restart production. The order to resume production was soon rescinded, and the prisoners were ordered to destroy the cases of money they had with them. That which was not burnt by the prisoners was loaded onto trucks with the printing equipment and sunk in the Toplitz and Grundlsee lakes.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the strain}} on the oxygen supplies, the crew decides to abandon most of <b>the</b> <b>equipment</b> <b>and</b> to cut short the lunar stay. The repair work is {{completed}} slightly ahead of schedule, and the rocket cleared for lift-off. Halfway to Earth, Jorgen escapes his bonds thanks to the detectives' bungling and tries to kill Tintin and the others; Wolff seeks to prevent him, and in their struggle over a gun Jorgen is killed. When it is revealed that {{there will not be}} enough oxygen aboard for the crew to survive the journey, Wolff sacrifices himself by opening the airlock and floating out into space to his death. The crew fall unconscious but Tintin wakes long enough to set the rocket to auto-pilot and it arrives back in Syldavia safely.|$|E
5|$|Former Polish {{estimates}} {{of the size of}} the Russian forces varied from 25,000 through 30,000 to 34,500, with 160 artillery pieces. Recent research on 17th-century Russian archive documents showed that the size of the Russian army was 23,961. Compared to former Russian armies, Shein's army was significantly modernised. Dissatisfied with their traditional formations of musket-equipped infantry (the streltsy), the Russians looked to foreign officers to update <b>the</b> <b>equipment</b> <b>and</b> training of their troops based on the Western European model of regulars, dragoons, and reiters.

5|$|In {{addition}} to attracting predators {{such as the}} Amazon river dolphin, these high-water occurrences are an ideal location to draw in the local fisheries. Human fishing activities directly compete with the dolphins for the same fish species, the tambaqui (Colossoma macropomum) and the pirapitinga (Piaractus brachypomus), resulting in deliberate or unintentional catches of the Amazon river dolphin. The local fishermen overfish, and when the Amazon River dolphins remove the commercialized fish from the nets and lines, it damages <b>the</b> <b>equipment</b> <b>and</b> the capture and causes a negative reaction from the local fishermen.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, working in Hanford and Savannah River Sites, Reines and Cowan {{developed}} <b>the</b> <b>equipment</b> <b>and</b> procedures {{with which they}} first detected the supposedly undetectable neutrinos in June 1956. Reines dedicated the major part of his career {{to the study of}} the neutrino's properties and interactions, which work would influence study of the neutrino for many researchers to come. This included the detection of neutrinos created in the atmosphere by cosmic rays, and the 1987 detection of neutrinos emitted from Supernova SN1987A, which inaugurated the field of neutrino astronomy.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the first}} welding process, forge welding, some modern welding methods {{do not involve}} the melting of the {{materials}} being joined. One of the most popular, ultrasonic welding, is used to connect thin sheets or wires made of metal or thermoplastic by vibrating them at high frequency and under high pressure. <b>The</b> <b>equipment</b> <b>and</b> methods involved are {{similar to that of}} resistance welding, but instead of electric current, vibration provides energy input. Welding metals with this process does not involve melting the materials; instead, the weld is formed by introducing mechanical vibrations horizontally under pressure. When welding plastics, the materials should have similar melting temperatures, and the vibrations are introduced vertically. Ultrasonic welding is commonly used for making electrical connections out of aluminum or copper, and it is also a very common polymer welding process.|$|E
5|$|The Germans had not developed, {{and did not}} employ {{radioactive}} poisons, so Operation Peppermint {{was never}} put into effect. After VE-Day, <b>the</b> <b>equipment</b> <b>and</b> all the documents relating to Operation Peppermint were collected, returned to the United States, and {{handed over to the}} Manhattan Project. However, the effort put into developing portable radiation detection equipment was not wasted. Survey teams from the Manhattan Project used the equipment to assess the fallout from the Trinity nuclear test, the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and Operation Crossroads, during which 10,000 film badges were used.|$|E

5|$|The {{practice}} of decompression by divers comprises {{the planning and}} monitoring of the profile indicated by the algorithms or tables of the chosen decompression model, to allow asymptomatic and harmless release of excess inert gases dissolved in the tissues {{as a result of}} breathing at ambient pressures greater than surface atmospheric pressure, the equipment available and appropriate to the circumstances of the dive, and the procedures authorized for <b>the</b> <b>equipment</b> <b>and</b> profile to be used. There is a large range of options in all of these aspects.|$|E
5|$|Under Operation Peppermint, orders {{went out}} for medical {{personnel}} to report the details of any fogging or blackening of photographic or X-ray film, and medical officers were ordered to report diseases of unknown etiology involving fatigue, nausea, leukopenia or erythema. Eleven survey meters and a Geiger counter were shipped to England in early 1944, along with 1,500 film packets, which were used to measure radiation exposure. Another 25 survey meters, 5 Geiger counters and 1,500 film packets were held in storage in the United States, but in readiness to be shipped by air with the highest priority. Peterson instructed Chemical Warfare Service personnel {{in the use of}} <b>the</b> <b>equipment,</b> <b>and</b> Signal Corps personnel in its maintenance.|$|E

5|$|World War II was a {{demanding}} {{time for the}} railway line, as the track was in heavy use for both civilian and military transportation, and much of <b>the</b> <b>equipment</b> <b>and</b> maintenance was lacking. On 28 February 1944 a descending eastbound freight train loaded with oil and petrol lost its braking power and became a runaway train, finally ploughing into a westbound passenger train at Breifoss, just east of Geilo. The crash and subsequent fire killed 25 civilians and {{an unknown number of}} German soldiers. Poor lubrication oil combined with the cold weather is believed to have caused the accident.|$|E
5|$|A scuba diver moves {{underwater}} {{by using}} fins {{attached to the}} feet; external propulsion can be provided by a diver propulsion vehicle, or a towboard pulled from the surface. Other equipment includes a diving mask to improve underwater vision, a protective diving suit, equipment to control buoyancy, and equipment related to the specific circumstances and purpose of the dive. Scuba divers are trained in the procedures and skills appropriate to their level of certification by instructors affiliated to the diver certification organisations which issue these diver certifications. These include standard operating procedures for using <b>the</b> <b>equipment</b> <b>and</b> dealing with the general hazards of the underwater environment, and emergency procedures for self-help and assistance of a similarly equipped diver experiencing problems. A minimum level of fitness and health is required by most training organisations, and {{a higher level of}} fitness may be needed for some applications.|$|E
5|$|Formed as {{a fighter}} wing in November 1943, No.78 Wing {{comprised}} three flying units, Nos.75, 78 and 80 Squadrons, operating P-40 Kittyhawks in the South West Pacific theatre of World WarII. After the war, it re-equipped with P-51 Mustangs at Williamtown. During the early 1950s, the wing was based at Malta on garrison duties with the Royal Air Force, operating two squadrons of DeHavilland Vampire jet fighters. Re-equipped with CAC Sabres, it deployed with Nos.3 and 77 Squadrons to Malaya in 1958‚Äì59, flying sorties against communist insurgents in {{the final years of}} the Emergency. In the 1960s, it was tasked with providing regional air defence during the Konfrontasi between Indonesia and Malaysia, and supplied <b>the</b> <b>equipment</b> <b>and</b> personnel for the RAAF contingent operating from Ubon Air Base in Thailand. No.78 Wing was disbanded in November 1967, and re-formed for its present role as an operational training wing in February 2000.|$|E
