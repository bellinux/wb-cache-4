5|$|G. minor {{is unusual}} because it {{frequently}} is found with embryonic skeletons of the enantiornithine bird Gobipipus. These embryos have well-developed wings, which suggest <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> fly very soon after hatching, unlike most modern birds.|$|E
5|$|In other instances, {{managers}} deliberately {{used the}} reforms {{as an opportunity}} to cut wages, exaggerating wage cuts made by the ministries so that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> cut back on overall expenditure. In one case, a manager of a concrete factory was sentenced to eight months corrective labour after being found guilty of using the reforms as a pretext to extract unpaid overtime from workers.|$|E
5|$|STAC {{stated that}} an SST would have {{economic}} performance similar to existing subsonic types. Although they would burn more fuel in cruise, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> fly more sorties {{in a given}} period of time, so fewer aircraft {{would be needed to}} service a particular route. This would remain economically advantageous as long as fuel represented a small percentage of operational costs, as it did at the time.|$|E
25|$|This battle {{demonstrated}} that the convoy escorts had {{mastered the art of}} convoy protection; the weapons and expertise at their disposal meant that henceforth <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> not only to protect their charges and repel attack, but also to inflict significant losses on the attacker.|$|R

50|$|Contacts {{were made}} with several internationally renowned {{biopesticide}} producers to ascertain whether <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> and willing to reliably meet LUBILOSA's spore requirements during phase 3, but none <b>were</b> <b>able</b> to make that commitment. Accordingly, part of the IITA station in Cotonou was converted into a spore production unit and the human and technical capacity enhanced to meet the expected spore requirements. The facility proved an excellent research unit and {{made it possible to}} refine realistic technical specifications and to test production, contamination control, spore separation, drying and packaging.|$|R
5|$|After Sebastian Vettel's {{surprise}} victory {{two weeks}} prior in Malaysia, {{eyes were on}} Ferrari whether <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> continue their good race pace in China and challenge the Mercedes for the win. As lower track temperatures were expected for the race, a serious competitiveness of Ferrari was cast into doubt, as they had benefited from lower tyre degradation {{in the heat of}} Malaysia. All ten teams taking part in the championship participated in the race, with Marussia hoping to finally be able to run both cars continually, after Will Stevens had failed to start in Malaysia.|$|E
5|$|An {{extraterrestrial}} civilization {{may choose}} to communicate with humanity by means of artifacts or probes rather than by radio, for various reasons. While probes may {{take a long time}} to reach the Solar System, once there <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> hold a sustained dialogue that would be impossible using radio from hundreds or thousands of light-years away. Radio would be completely unsuitable for surveillance and continued monitoring of a civilization, and should an extraterrestrial civilization wish to perform these activities on humanity, artifacts may be the only option other than to send large, crewed spacecraft to the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|As prosperous as {{the region}} was, {{it was not}} unharmed by the {{constant}} Ottoman–Habsburg wars and was often the target of Turkish, Tatar and Hungarian rebel raids. By the 1630s, {{the idea of an}} organized anti-Ottoman revolt had reached the town of Chiprovtsi. In his 1650 account to the senate of the Republic of Venice Petar Parchevich described the long preparations for an armed struggle and the support-seeking visits of his fellow townsmen to the kings of Poland and Austria. Since then, the inhabitants of Chiprovtsi waited for the suitable moment when <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> instigate an effective uprising and continued to co-operate with the leaders of the European realms.|$|E

5|$|By the {{beginning}} of World War I, B3, B4, and B5 were at Dover and were deployed on a line between Calais and the Goodwin Sands to protect {{the passage of the}} British Expeditionary Force to France. Each submarine would sail from Dover before dawn to be secured at the buoy marking their billet at dawn, the idea being that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> slip from the buoy when they spotted an enemy ship and manoeuvre to attack. That this was not a good tactic was proved when B3 narrowly avoided a torpedo from a German U-boat on the morning of 2 October. Nonetheless the scheme was successful and the BEF crossed to France without loss.|$|E
5|$|Cienfuegos led electors {{that were}} part of the {{imperial}} party in an attempt to elect Giulio Piazza. Piazza was almost elected on May 13, but was short by four votes. The electors were confident that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> elect him, because more cardinals were arriving to participate in the conclave, and it became public in Rome that Piazza was likely to be the new pope. Albani did not support this because he had not {{been a part of the}} negotiations despite being the original elector to suggest Piazza, and undermined his election by proposing Vincenzo Orsini as an alternate candidate.|$|E
5|$|Qatar is {{required}} to have a broadcaster which has at least associate membership of the EBU {{in order to have}} a chance to take part, as Qatar Radio is only a radio station and Qatar lies outside the European Broadcasting Area and cannot apply for Council of Europe membership with Australia being the only exception after being an associate member for over 30 years. The broadcaster would most likely be Qatar Television (QTV) also owned and run by the Qatar General Broadcasting and Television Corporation (QGBTC). If Qatar Radio gets accepted too, then <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> air the contest alongside the television broadcast.|$|E

With advancement of the information technology and Internet the virtual organizations have become a trend {{with more and more}} professionals working from home. Several studies have focused mostly in developed nations with little or no research found in the South African context. This study focused on South African circumstances and examined the cost saving implications for Business Connexion and their employees if <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> and allowed to work from home. Further, relationships between operational and professional factors, with virtual work were studied...|$|R
60|$|In January, {{he took a}} {{party of}} horse, and reconnoitred along the River Aa, to observe the motions of the Saxons on the other side; and, hearing that a party of them had entered Marienburg, he {{determined}} to take possession of that place, as, were they to fortify it, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> greatly to harass the Swedes. Sending word to the king of his intention, and asking for an approval of his plan of fortifying the town, he took three companies of infantry and four hundred horse, made a rapid march to Marienburg, and occupied it without opposition.|$|R

5|$|The North Koreans {{advanced}} on {{the town}} with the 3rd and 4th divisions supported by over 50 T-34 tanks. Each North Korean division, normally operating with 11,000 men, was at 60 to 80 percent strength, giving them nearly a two to one numerical superiority over the American forces. The morale of the two divisions was low, owing to repeated air attacks on equipment and overall exhaustion from continuous combat. Political officers promised the divisions <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> rest in Taejon after they took the city.|$|E
5|$|The {{first stage}} of Operation Auca began in September 1955. Saint, McCully, Elliot, and fellow missionary Johnny Keenan decided to {{initiate}} contact with the Huaorani and began periodically searching for them by air. By {{the end of the}} month, they had identified several clearings in the jungle. Meanwhile, Elliot learned several phrases {{in the language of the}} Huaorani from Dayuma, a young Huaorani woman who had left her society and become friends with Rachel Saint, a missionary and the sister of Nate Saint. The missionaries hoped that by regularly giving gifts to the Huaorani and attempting to communicate with them in their language, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> win them over as friends.|$|E
5|$|A {{roof was}} {{restored}} to the Main Stand by 1951 and, soon after, the three remaining stands were covered, the operation culminating {{with the addition of}} a roof to the Stretford End (now the West Stand) in 1959. The club also invested £40,000 in the installation of proper floodlighting, so that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> use the stadium for the European games that were played in the late evening of weekdays, instead of having to play at Maine Road. In order to avoid obtrusive shadows being cast on the pitch, two sections of the Main Stand roof were cut away. The first match to be played under floodlights at Old Trafford was a First Division match between Manchester United and Bolton Wanderers on 25 March 1957.|$|E

5|$|During the 1920s, many navies were {{pursuing}} the flotilla leader concept, building large destroyers {{similar to the}} World War I Royal Navy V and W-class destroyers. In the interwar French Navy, these ships were known as contre-torpilleurs, and were intended to operate with smaller destroyers, or as half-flotillas of three ships. The idea was that such a half-flotilla could defeat an Italian light cruiser of the Condottieri class. The Navy of the KSCS decided to build three such flotilla leaders, ships that would {{have the ability to}} reach high speeds and with a long endurance. The long endurance requirement reflected Yugoslav plans to deploy the ships into the central Mediterranean, where <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> operate alongside French and British warships.|$|E
5|$|Eliot invokes {{images of}} {{original}} sin and Adam's fall when talking about the past and points out that such events can be forgotten but can still affect mankind. Eliot brings {{in the image of}} Krishna to discuss how the past and future are related: Krishna, speaking to Arjuna, claims that death can come at any time and that men should always find the divine will instead of worrying about what their actions will bring. If an individual were to follow Krishna's words then <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> free their self from the limitations of time. Even if it cannot be fully attained, the effort in attempting it is still important. The way for mankind to understand the divine will is through prayer and through the power of the Holy Spirit.|$|E
5|$|Krabs' rival {{and former}} best friend Plankton {{operates}} the Chum Bucket, a failing restaurant {{across the street}} from the Krusty Krab. A major plot point throughout the series is Plankton's futile attempts to steal the Krabby Patty formula with the help of his computer sidekick Karen, under the assumption that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> replicate the burgers and put the Krusty Krab out of business. To avoid this, Krabs goes to extreme lengths to prevent Plankton from obtaining the recipe; he even refuses to allow him to buy a Krabby Patty legitimately out of fear that Plankton might use Karen to reverse-engineer the formula. Krabs also makes it his duty to ensure that the Chum Bucket never has any business whatsoever.|$|E

5|$|On April 4, 1955, a United Airlines check captain, Stanley C. Hoyt, age 45, was {{carrying}} out instrument rating checks {{on two of}} the airline's pilots. Hoyt had been employed by United Airlines since 1937, and had 9,763 flying hours experience, 549 of which were in a DC-6. He was training the two pilots, Henry M. Dozier, age 40, and Vernis H. Webb, age 35, so <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> retain an instrument rating qualification, allowing them to fly under instrument flight rules. The aircraft was a Douglas DC-6, registration N37512, serial number 43001. The airframe had flown 22,068 flying hours, and had undergone an inspection 105 hours before the accident. The aircraft was powered by four Pratt & Whitney R2800-CB16 engines, fitted with Hamilton Standard 43E60-317 propellers.|$|E
5|$|On February 11, Buckner relayed {{orders to}} Pillow from Floyd to release Floyd's and Buckner's troops to operate {{south of the}} river, near Cumberland City, where <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> attack the Union supply lines while keeping a clear path back to Nashville. However, this would leave the Confederate forces at Fort Donelson heavily outnumbered. Pillow left early {{on the morning of}} February 12 to argue these orders with General Floyd himself leaving Buckner in charge of the fort. After hearing sounds of {{artillery}} fire, Pillow returned to Fort Donelson to resume command. After the events of the day, Buckner remained at Fort Donelson to command the Confederate right. With the arrival of Grant's army, General Johnston ordered Floyd to take any troops remaining in Clarksville to aid in the defense of Fort Donelson.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} liberation, the {{reestablished}} government in Brussels attempted to disarm and demobilize the resistance. In particular, the government feared the organizations would degenerate into armed political militias which could threaten the country's political stability. In October 1944 the government ordered {{members of the}} resistance to surrender their weapons to the police and, in November, threatened to search the houses and fine those who had retained them. This provoked significant anger among resistance members, who had hoped that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> continue fighting alongside the Allies in the invasion of Germany. On 25 November, a large demonstration of former resistance members took place in Brussels. As the crowds moved towards the Parliament, British soldiers fired on the crowd, which they suspected {{to be trying to}} make left-wing coup d'état. 45 people were wounded.|$|E
