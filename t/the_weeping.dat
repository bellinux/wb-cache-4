5|$|In the episode, alien time {{traveller}} the Doctor (Matt Smith) {{takes his}} companions Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) {{and her husband}} Rory Williams (Arthur Darvill) to Central Park in New York City. There, recurring monsters <b>the</b> <b>Weeping</b> Angels send Rory back to the 1930s, where he is reunited with River Song (Alex Kingston), Amy and Rory's daughter. Amy and the Doctor attempt to rescue Rory, but the Doctor realises along the way that this adventure will be his last with Amy and Rory. Actors Gillan and Darvill both departed the series with this episode.|$|E
5|$|Following the cliffhanger of the {{previous}} episode, alien time traveller the Doctor (Matt Smith), his companion Amy Pond (Karen Gillan), River Song, and Father Octavian (Iain Glen) and his militarised clerics have escaped entrapment by <b>the</b> <b>Weeping</b> Angels, creatures who only move when unobserved by others. They take refuge inside the crashed starship Byzantium, but the Angels pursue them and Amy is {{on the brink of}} dying from the imprint of an Angel in her eye. Both the Angels and the Doctor's team face danger from a widening crack in space and time which has the power to erase persons from history.|$|E

Sally returns the next day with her friend Kathy Nightingale to explore further but Kathy disappears {{at the same time a}} young man knocks at the door. He claims to be Kathy's grandson and delivers a letter to Sally. The letter, written by Kathy, explains that she suddenly found herself in the 1920s in Hull. She settled down with a husband and led a peaceful life and requests that Sally tell Kathy's brother Larry of her disappearance. Sally sees a Yale key hanging from the hand of one of the statues and takes it before leaving.|$|E

5|$|The walrus {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the religion and folklore of many Arctic peoples. Skin and bone are used in some ceremonies, and the animal appears frequently in legends. For example, in a Chukchi version of the widespread myth of the Raven, in which Raven recovers the sun and the moon from an evil spirit by seducing his daughter, the angry father throws the daughter from a high cliff and, as she drops into the water, she turns into a walrus – possibly the original walrus. According to various legends, the tusks are formed either by the trails of mucus from <b>the</b> <b>weeping</b> girl or her long braids. This myth is possibly related to the Chukchi myth of the old walrus-headed woman who rules the bottom of the sea, who is in turn linked to the Inuit goddess Sedna. Both in Chukotka and Alaska, the aurora borealis is believed to be a special world inhabited by those who died by violence, the changing rays representing deceased souls playing ball with a walrus head.|$|E

25|$|The {{penitent}} is {{the subject}} rather than the object of this discourse. Contrition {{is not something that}} happens to the penitent but is rather an affect he or she creates, as the focus on humility and on <b>the</b> <b>weeping</b> voice suggests. Affectivity is the translation of idea into expressive gesture, and this moment is surely an affective one. If the genuineness of a late-medieval spiritual experience is confirmed by its external signs—by its affectivity, in other words—we should extend the same criterion to the early evidence, where we find that it works just as well.|$|E
25|$|PBA {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{frequently}} reported post-stroke behavioral syndromes, with a range of reported prevalence rates from 28% to 52%. The higher prevalence rates tend to be reported in stroke patients who are older and/or who have a history of prior stroke. The relationship between post-stroke depression and PBA is complicated, because the depressive syndrome also occurs with high frequency in stroke survivors. Post-stroke patients with PBA are more depressed than poststroke patients without PBA, and the presence of a depressive syndrome may exacerbate <b>the</b> <b>weeping</b> side of PBA symptoms.|$|E
25|$|The Eighth Doctor goes on {{to appear}} in a new four-CD, four-part miniseries, Doom Coalition, which sees him, {{recurring}} companion Liv Chenka, and new companion Helen Sinclair, on {{the hunt for the}} insane Time Lord known as the Eleven, who suffers from a unique mental defect where all of his past personalities are active in his mind at once. In the course of the novel, the Doctor peripherally interacts with the Eleventh Doctor's future wife River Song- although she takes care to avoid directly interacting with the Eighth Doctor unless wearing a disguise- and at one point confronts an alliance between the Monk and <b>the</b> <b>Weeping</b> Angels. Doom Coalition concludes with the Doctor thwarting a plan to destroy the rest of the universe in order to save Gallifrey from 'prophecies' of its destruction.|$|E

The Phantom refuses, and captures Raoul with the Punjab lasso. The Phantom tells Christine that he will free Raoul if she agrees {{to stay with him}} forever, but if she refuses, Raoul will die. Christine, heartbroken, tells the Phantom that it is his soul that is deformed, not his face. As the Phantom and Raoul both plead to her, Christine mournfully wonders what kind of life the Phantom has known. She tells the Phantom that he is not alone and kisses him, showing him compassion {{for the first time in}} his life. The Phantom, having experienced kindness at last, understands that he cannot compel Christine to love him, and sets them both free. Raoul hurries Christine out of the lair, but she returns alone to give the Phantom back his ring.

500|$|Many critics {{consider}} the episode {{one of the}} strongest during Tennant's time as the Doctor. IGN's Matt Wales named it the sixth best episode of Tennant's tenure, while Sam McPherson of TVOvermind listed it as the second best Tenth Doctor episode. In 2011, before {{the second half of the}} sixth series, The Huffington Post labelled [...] "Blink" [...] as one of the five essential episodes for new viewers to watch. <b>The</b> <b>Weeping</b> Angels also received critical praise. In 2009 SFX named the climax with <b>the</b> <b>Weeping</b> Angels advancing on Sally and Larry the scariest moment in Doctor Who history, describing it as [...] "a terrifying combination of scary concept and perfect direction". <b>The</b> <b>Weeping</b> Angels came in at number three in Neil Gaiman's [...] "Top Ten New Classic Monsters" [...] in Entertainment Weekly, while TV Squad named them the third scariest television characters. They were also rated the third [...] "baddie" [...] in Doctor Who by The Daily Telegraph, behind the Nestene Consciousness and Daleks.

However, after withdrawing from the writing of series three's first two-part story—Helen Raynor took over these episodes, writing [...] "Daleks in Manhattan" [...] and [...] "Evolution of the Daleks"—Moffat volunteered to write the series' Doctor-lite episode and opted to use <b>the</b> <b>Weeping</b> Angels in what would become [...] "Blink". Moffat was also inspired to write the episode based on the popular children's game Statues, which he always found [...] "frightening". Murray Gold, the composer for the series, later compared the creatures to the moving ghostly topiary animals in Stephen King's 1977 horror novel The Shining.|$|E

This episode would have seen the appearance of <b>the</b> <b>Weeping</b> Angels, making it the first time they'd crossover in the SJA series. After these events, the Doctor, and his companions Amy and Rory, would have traveled to Alpha Metraxis, which is <b>the</b> <b>Weeping</b> Angels' planet, and would have saved Sarah and the friends, also making it the first time Amy and Rory had met Sarah-Jane and her gang and the first time they fully appeared in SJA. The Doctor, Sarah and company would have traveled back to Earth, to Bannerman Road and stopped the time-bomb from exploding, though it would have destroyed half of the neighborhood. This was intended to be the Series 4 finale. Maria and Alan would have returned.|$|E

Moffat designed the two-part story to be a more action-oriented sequel to [...] "Blink", an episode he wrote for the third series that introduced <b>the</b> <b>Weeping</b> Angels. He was inspired by the relationship between the film Alien and its sequel, Aliens, which he referred to as [...] "the best conceived movie sequel ever", describing it as being more [...] "highly coloured" [...] as opposed to Alien more low-key tone. He also intended for the Angels to have a plan that could become [...] "almost like a war", in contrast to the way they were struggling to survive in [...] "Blink".
