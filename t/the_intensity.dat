40|$|AbstractHelical vortices, as {{one kind}} of {{secondary}} flows, are recently observed downstream of the short twisted tape. The behaviors of vortices, which have significant effects on the efficiency of twisted tape, are not well understood. As such, the formation and development of helical vortices induced by the short twisted tape are studied numerically. The results show that two symmetrical stable helical vortices are present downstream of the twisted tape. The values of radial velocities cannot be neglected due {{to the presence of}} the vortices. The vortices form in the twisted tape and remain the structure downstream of the twisted tape. Torsion promotes the formation of helical vortices. <b>The</b> <b>intensities</b> of helical vortices decay along the streamwise direction. With the increasing Reynolds numbers, <b>the</b> <b>intensities</b> of helical vortices increase, and the trend is in agreement with <b>the</b> swirl <b>intensities.</b> <b>The</b> <b>intensities</b> of helical vortices decay slowly compared with <b>the</b> <b>intensities</b> of swirling flow...|$|R
