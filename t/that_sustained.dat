After a time, trade resumed with the West Indies but was limited to necessities. Items <b>that</b> <b>sustained</b> the war effort in America were traded, with crops such as rice from the Carolinas shipped out and coffee beans imported in order to brew America's new beverage of choice.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{was only}} a Category 1 hurricane, Charley caused {{significant}} damage in southern Jamaica. Saint Elizabeth Parish sustained the worst damage. About 750 farmers reported damage, and at one point, flooding isolated 30 families. The only fatality in Jamaica occurred after a man attempted to rescue a family but was swept away by flood waters. Following the storm, search and rescue teams were deployed to flooded regions. Days later, officials allocated roughly $7.6million (JMD; US$86,000) to repair damaged roads. Residents in areas <b>that</b> <b>sustained</b> severe agricultural losses also requested assistance from the government.|$|E
5|$|Civilian {{telephones}} {{were used}} {{at the outset of}} the war, but they were found to be unreliable in the damp, muddy conditions that prevailed. Consequently, the field telephone was designed; a device that operated with its own switchboard. Apart from voice communication, it featured a buzzer unit with a Morse code key, so that it could be used to send and receive coded messages. This facility proved useful when, in the midst of bombardment, exploding shells drowned out voice communication. The telephones were connected by lines <b>that</b> <b>sustained</b> continual damage as a result of shell fire and the movement of troops. The lines were generally buried, with redundant lines set in place to compensate for breakages.|$|E

5|$|Innis {{examined}} {{the rise and}} fall of ancient empires as a way of tracing the effects of communications media. He looked at media that led to the growth of an empire; those <b>that</b> <b>sustained</b> it during its periods of success, and then, the communications changes that hastened an empire's collapse. He tried to show that media 'biases' toward time or space affected the complex interrelationships needed to sustain an empire. These interrelationships included the partnership between the knowledge (and ideas) necessary to create and maintain an empire, and the power (or force) required to expand and defend it. For Innis, the interplay between knowledge and power was always a crucial factor in understanding empire.|$|E
5|$|On a more {{practical}} level, the central government took an active interest in supporting agriculture. Producing food was the top priority of land use. Larger farms (latifundia) achieved an economy of scale <b>that</b> <b>sustained</b> urban life and its more specialized division of labour. Small farmers benefited from the development of local markets in towns and trade centres. Agricultural techniques such as crop rotation and selective breeding were disseminated throughout the Empire, and new crops were introduced from one province to another, such as peas and cabbage to Britain.|$|E
5|$|A {{state of}} {{emergency}} was declared for Aklan, where property damage equated to ₱51million (US$1million). The Central Visayas region of the Philippines suffered the worst impacts, with a damage cost of ₱345.2million (US$7million), primarily to agriculture. Following the storm's passage, chapters of the Philippine Red Cross assisted in relief efforts in impacted areas. The Philippine Department of Social Welfare and Development allocated ₱27.7million (US$600,000) to relief efforts. Food and sheltering were provided to 2,615people in three provinces by the Adventist Development and Relief Agency. Many localized relief agencies donated sacks of rice to impacted residents. The United Nations appealed for US$46million for use in recovery efforts following Utor {{in addition to the}} three Philippine typhoons which preceded it. Overall, the impacts of Utor killed 30people and injured 44in the Philippines. Another eight people were never accounted for. The damage toll wrought by Utor amounted to US$15.8million. Furthermore, 36,542houses were damaged by Utor, of which 9,439were destroyed. Capiz and Aklan were the areas <b>that</b> <b>sustained</b> the most residential damage. People who were evacuated out of hazardous regions in advance of Utor were able to return home beginning on December18, nine days after initial landfall.|$|E

5|$|Friedman {{suggested}} <b>that</b> <b>sustained</b> Keynesian policies {{could lead}} to both unemployment and inflation rising at once – a phenomenon that soon became known as stagflation. In the early 1970s stagflation appeared in both the US and Britain just as Friedman had predicted, with economic conditions deteriorating further after the 1973 oil crisis. Aided by the prestige gained from his successful forecast, Friedman led increasingly successful criticisms against the Keynesian consensus, convincing not only academics and politicians but also much {{of the general public}} with his radio and television broadcasts. The academic credibility of Keynesian economics was further undermined by additional criticism from other monetarists trained in the Chicago school of economics, by the Lucas critique and by criticisms from Hayek's Austrian School. So successful were these criticisms that by 1980 Robert Lucas claimed economists would often take offence if described as Keynesians.|$|E
5|$|There were {{numerous}} reports in southern Mississippi of embedded tornadoes that exacerbated the hurricane's effects. Reports in Gulfport indicated that three schools actively {{being used as}} hurricane shelters were struck and damaged by tornadoes. At one location, almost 400 people being housed in a school had to rush to safety before part of its roof collapsed. Another apparent tornado sideswiped a senior citizens' center, endangering nearly 200 people in a structure <b>that</b> <b>sustained</b> damage to windows, doors, and part of its roof; about 20 people required rescue by paramedics. Only minor injuries occurred {{in association with the}} possible tornadoes. Teams of experts tasked with reviewing the validity of tornado reports were largely unable to prove that {{a significant portion of the}} damage in southern Mississippi had been done by tornadoes. As a result, few tornadoes were confirmed, and it is likely that most of the damage in the region resulted from squall-like winds that are part of an intense hurricane's nature, or potentially localized microbursts. Any unconfirmed tornadoes would have been no stronger than the hurricane's synoptic winds.|$|E
5|$|Torrential {{rainfall}} in Honduras caused flooding, which forced 60,000people {{from their}} homes. In addition, 4,000homes were destroyed and 40wooden bridges were washed away.

Flood waters also inundated nearly 50,000acres of banana and fruit plantations owned by Chiquita Brands International. Other crops <b>that</b> <b>sustained</b> damage were maize, beans, sorghum, and rice. Agricultural losses associated with the storm totaled to approximately $7.7million. Along the Caribbean coastline of Honduras, about 1,000shanty houses were destroyed. Overall, Marco caused nine fatalities in the country. In the Pacific and northern regions of Nicaragua, numerous houses washed away in the floods. In addition, Nicaraguan civil defense authorities reported two fatalities. Further north in Guatemala, at least one death occurred, and flood waters damaged or destroyed hundreds of homes. Swollen rivers in Costa Rica flooded several towns and numerous banana plantations.|$|E

5|$|Soubise has {{historically}} taken {{the blame for}} the loss, but this may be an unfair assessment. While he did owe his rank to his good relationship with Madame de Pompadour, the mistress of King Louis XV, he was neither blessed with extraordinary military acumen nor with the best troops: he could do nothing about the former, and most of the latter were with Louis Charles César Le Tellier, fighting in the Rhineland. Under Soubise's command, the French had conducted a notorious march across Germany, characterized by persistent pillaging. His army also had approximately 12,000 civilian camp followers. There were chefs, hair dressers, perruquiers, barbers, wives and mistresses, pastry chefs, tailors and clothiers of all kinds, saddle makers, bridle makers, grooms, and servants of all varieties who served the nobility. In addition, the army had its usual motley crew of farriers, grooms, veterinarians, surgeons, and cooks <b>that</b> <b>sustained</b> an army on the march. After the battle, the Comte de Saint Germain, who had commanded the advanced guard and also the rear guard that struggled {{to keep up with the}} fleeing army, complained that the troops in his charge had been defective, a gang of robbers, murders, and cowards who ran at the sound of a gunshot.|$|E

25|$|If {{older adults}} have fewer attentional {{resources}} than younger adults, {{we would expect}} that when two tasks {{must be carried out}} at the same time, older adults' performance will decline more than that of younger adults. However, a large review of studies on cognition and aging suggest that this hypothesis has not been wholly supported. While some studies have found that older adults have a more difficult time encoding and retrieving information when their attention is divided, other studies have not found meaningful differences from younger adults. Similarly, one might expect older adults to do poorly on tasks of sustained attention, which measure the ability to attend to and respond to stimuli {{for an extended period of}} time. However, studies suggest <b>that</b> <b>sustained</b> attention shows no decline with age. Results suggest <b>that</b> <b>sustained</b> attention increases in early adulthood and then remains relatively stable, at least through the seventh decade of life. More research is needed on how normal aging impacts attention after age eighty.|$|E
