The 2007 fuel protests were put together by {{several members of the}} old [...] "TransAction group" [...] from the South of England, reforming as [...] "TransAction 2007". The protests of this period were not widely supported nor did they cause the same disruption as those in previous years. The 2007 protest which took place at the latter end of the year, culminated in 200–300 trucks descending on Central London with the police closing off the A40 fly-over for use as a truck park for the day. Following this, a rally was held at Marble Arch. Later in the day, a deputation went to 10 Downing Street to deliver a formal petition calling for the reduction of UK fuel duty. There were those who felt that the 2007 fuel protests were politically motivated, given that many truck owner operators and farmers would have supported the Conservative Party. The Conservative leader David Cameron gave them his support and promised a “fair fuel stabiliser”, a proposal to limit the price of petrol {{that was part of the}} Conservative manifesto for the 2010 UK general election and was announced to be implemented following the budget of March 2011. The “fair fuel stabiliser” which was meant to lower taxes levied on fuel as the price rose and raise tax as the price fell, in fact tax will still rise as the oil price rises but the tax will be capped at the level of inflation at that time and will be applied twice a year, but when the oil price is falling then the tax can be greater than inflation.

40|$|Abstract. Probability {{theory is}} the {{standard}} economic representation of uncertainty, {{although it is not}} always an accurate one. Fuzzy logic is an alternative representation that does not require individual beliefs regarding the explicit functional form of uncertainty. This paper applies fuzzy logic to an oligopoly <b>trigger</b> <b>pricing</b> game. The fuzzy <b>trigger</b> <b>pricing</b> game reverses the standard cyclical price war prediction; collusion-sustaining price wars are most likely to occur during times of high demand. The fuzzy model also predicts that markets with relatively volatile prices are more likely to undergo collusion-sustaining price wars. The predictions are consistent with available empirical evidence. Key words: fuzzy logic and economics, uncertainty and information, <b>trigger</b> <b>prices,</b> collusion. I...|$|R

In these electronic markets, firms have the opportunity to employ "pricebots," computerized algorithms that automatically adjust prices to prevailing market conditions. This article uses laboratory methods to examine the potential market impact of the endogenous selection of three automated pricing algorithms: undercutting, low-price matching, and <b>trigger</b> <b>pricing.</b> We find that the undercutting algorithm leads to prices similar to the game-theoretic prediction.

40|$|In the thesis, I derive {{the optimal}} {{operating}} strategy {{to maximize the}} value of a storage facility by exploiting the properties in the underlying natural gas spot price. To achieve the objective, I investigate the optimal operating strategy under three different spot price processes: the one-factor mean reversion price process with and without seasonal factors, the one-factor geometric Brownian motion price process with and without seasonal factors, and the two-factor short-term/long-term price process with and without seasonal factors. I prove the existence of the unique optimal <b>trigger</b> <b>prices,</b> and calculate the <b>trigger</b> <b>prices</b> under certain conditions. I also show the optimal <b>trigger</b> <b>prices</b> are the prices where the marginal revenue is equal to the marginal cost. Thus, the marginal analysis argument can be used to determine the optimal operating strategy. Once the optimal operating strategy is determined, I use it to obtain the optimal value of the storage facility in three ways: 1, using directly the net present value method; 2, solving the partial differential equations governing the value of the storage facility; 3, using the Monte Carlo method to simulate the decision making process. Issues about parameter estimations are also considered in the thesis. by Ning Zhai. Thesis (S. M.) [...] Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Computation for Design and Optimization Program, 2008.

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{challenges}} that investors in the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) project face is {{the management of the}} volatility of the price of Certified Emission Reduction (CERs). Large scale CDM projects require a long-term investment with significant amount of costs, and this type of investment is often irreversible. Project investors should quantitatively assess the CER <b>trigger</b> <b>price</b> that justifies the initiation of a CDM investment. The traditional discounted cash flow valuation is unable to capture the option value associated with uncertain investment, and thus it tends to underestimate the <b>trigger</b> <b>price</b> which initiates the investment. Real options theory explicitly considers the option value of delayed investment and can provide a better measurement of the <b>trigger</b> <b>price.</b> This paper presents a theoretical model of the CDM investment project and derives the CER trigger prices that guide investment decisions by using historical market data. It develops a stochastic dynamic programming model for both the geometric Brownian motion process and the mean-reverting process. An analytical solution for the <b>trigger</b> <b>price</b> is derived for the former process, and the <b>trigger</b> <b>price</b> is numerically estimated for the latter. By considering various parameter values, it analyzes the effects of different market environments on the <b>trigger</b> <b>price...</b>|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} {{is to examine the}} {{relative}} cost-effectiveness of subsidies in incentivizing energy efficiency investment using a real option framework. I generalize a model of a sequential investment project involving two stages, design and construction stage, and investment lags and incorporate explicit consideration of dynamic subsidies. I apply this model to green construction projects and study how design subsidies and rent subsidies incentivizes investment in green buildings. My research questions address the impact of subsidies on the <b>trigger</b> <b>prices</b> for the two stages as well as that on the instantaneous project value. Although both design and rent subsidies can reduce <b>trigger</b> <b>prices</b> and enhance project value, design subsidies cost less both in reducing the first-stage trigger to a certain threshold and in inducing firms to switch from inefficient projects to efficient ones. Lastly, I evaluate the comparative statics of investment, showing how the patterns of lags and demand uncertainty affect the effectiveness of both subsidies. A noteworthy result is that quality switching from an inefficient project to an green alternative is more likely to occur when the uncertainty is smaller or the length of the construction stage is shorter. by Yue Pan.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a conceptual model that analyzes {{the impact of}} increasing market transparency under the Livestock Mandatory Reporting Act of 1999 on the incentives for collusion in the U. S. meatpacking industry. More than likely, meatpackers will have asymmetric priors regarding the distribution of livestock prices. Moreover, they lack the incentives to voluntarily reveal their real priors. Thus, the enforcer of the Act faces a problem of asymmetric information regarding the informativeness of publicly disclosed market reports relative to that of packers priors. Analytical results predict that divergent priors of Bayesian packers can be updated by more informative market reports, so that the resultant posteriors converge, enabling packers to identify a more efficient, unanimous <b>trigger</b> <b>price.</b> This enhances observability of deviations from collusive behavior, and increases the internal policing efficiency by a cartel that employs <b>trigger</b> <b>price</b> strategies to monitor deviations by its members.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a dynamic model of industry equilibrium {{in which a}} cartel deters deviations from collusive output levels by threatening to produce at Cournot quantities {{for a period of}} fixed duration whenever the market price falls below some <b>trigger</b> <b>price.</b> In this model firms can observe only their own production level and a common market price. The market demand curve is assumed to have a stochastic component, so that an unexpectedly low price may signal either deviations from collusive output levels or a "downward" demand shock. This paper characterizes the optimality properties of this model, {{from the standpoint of the}} firms which participate in the cartel. In particular, the implications for the equilibrium quantity vector, of setting the <b>trigger</b> <b>price</b> and punishment period length at their optimal values, are assessed. It is demonstrated that, in general, the optimal quantity will exceed that which would maximize expected joint net returns in any single period. The optimal aggregate quantity is shown to be a nondecreasing function of the number of firms, equaling the aggregate Cournot level in the limit, and a nondecreasing function of the variance of the stochastic demand component...|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} formalizes and quantifies the {{importance}} of uncertainty for investment in a corn-stover based cellulosic biofuel plant. Using a real options model we recover prices of gasoline that would trigger entry into the market and calculate the portion of that entry <b>trigger</b> <b>price</b> required to cover cost and the portion that corresponds to risk premium. We then discuss the effect of managerial flexibility on the entry risk premium and the prices of gasoline that would trigger mothballing, reactivation, and exit. Results show that the risk premium required by plants to enter the second-generation biofuel market {{is likely to be}} substantial. The analysis also reveals that a break-even approach (which ignores the portion of entry price composed of risk premium), and the traditional Marshallian approach (which ignores the portion of entry price composed of both the risk premium and the drift rate), would significantly underestimate the gasoline entry <b>trigger</b> <b>price</b> and the magnitude of that underestimation increases as both volatility and mean of gasoline prices increase. Results also uncover a great deal of hysteresis (i. e. a range of gasoline prices for which there is neither entry nor exit in the market) in entry/exit behavior by plants. Hysteresis increases as gasoline prices become more volatile. Hysteresis suggests that, at the industry level, positive (negative) demand shocks will {{have a significant impact on}} prices (production) and a limited impact on production (prices). In combination all of these results suggest that policies supporting second generation biofuels may have fallen short of their targets because of their failure to alleviate uncertainty. ...|$|E
