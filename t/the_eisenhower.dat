5|$|Nevertheless, {{pleased by}} the findings, <b>the</b> <b>Eisenhower</b> {{administration}} proposed negotiations on a permanent test ban and announced it would self-impose a year-long testing moratorium if Britain and the Soviet Union did the same. This decision amounted to a victory for John Foster Dulles, Allen Dulles (then the Director of Central Intelligence), and PSAC, who had argued within <b>the</b> <b>Eisenhower</b> administration for separating a test ban from larger disarmament efforts, and a defeat for the Department of Defense and AEC, which had argued to the contrary.|$|E

Renovation of the property was delayed when Eisenhower became supreme commander of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in 1951. After he had attained the presidency of the United States in 1953, Mamie had him rebuild the old house. Much of the original building had to be torn down, due to its deterioration. The total cost of renovation was $250,000 (equal to $ today). This large expense was due partly to Mamie's whims, but also to Eisenhower's employment of union labor; he spent $65,000 (equal to $ today) for union workmen who came each day from Washington, D.C. ( [...] away) to work on the farmhouse. On their 1955 wedding anniversary, <b>the</b> <b>Eisenhowers</b> held a party to celebrate completion of the work.
