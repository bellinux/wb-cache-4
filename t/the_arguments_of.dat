5|$|A {{government}} inquiry {{was undertaken}} {{to determine the}} future use of the pipelines, and took evidence from the various stakeholders, most of whom presented the case that favored their companies or industry. The inquiry concluded that the pipelines should be sold for continued use in transporting petroleum. An auction for the pipelines was announced in 1946, {{which was designed to}} give preference to bidders who intended to use them for moving petroleum. 16 bids were received, with the highest cash bidders being companies hoping to use the pipelines for natural gas. Assessing the different bids proved difficult and the discussions became enmeshed in national politics, with companies seeking support from various Washington politicians. Meanwhile, a threatened national coal strike raised concerns over the availability of natural gas, strengthening <b>the</b> <b>arguments</b> <b>of</b> the natural gas lobby.|$|E
5|$|McCay {{became the}} sixth Minister for Defence in four years. His predecessor, Senator Anderson Dawson, had chaired a {{committee}} that had produced a detailed report recommending {{the abolition of}} the post of General Officer Commanding Australian Military Forces {{and the creation of a}} Council of Defence, a Naval Board and a Military Board. It fell to McCay to implement the report's recommendations and create a five-man Military Board consisting of himself, a finance member and three military officers. McCay preferred the senior member not be styled the Chief of the General Staff. This change would not be made until 1909. At the first meeting of the Council of Defence, McCay rejected <b>the</b> <b>arguments</b> <b>of</b> Captain William Rooke Creswell for the majority of the defence budget to be spent on supporting the British fleet. In 1905 the Reid government collapsed and McCay became a backbencher once more. Since the Federal parliament sat in Parliament House, Melbourne, McCay lived at the Stock Exchange Club in Collins Street, Melbourne while his family remained in Castlemaine. He maintained a liaison with a married woman, Ella Gavan Duffy.|$|E
5|$|One {{criticism}} of Kohlberg's {{theory is that}} it emphasizes justice {{to the exclusion of}} other values, and so may not adequately address <b>the</b> <b>arguments</b> <b>of</b> those who value other moral aspects of actions. Carol Gilligan has argued that Kohlberg's theory is overly androcentric. Kohlberg's theory was initially developed based on empirical research using only male participants; Gilligan argued that it did not adequately describe the concerns of women. Kohlberg stated that women tend to get stuck at level 3, focusing on details of how to maintain relationships and promote the welfare of family and friends. Men are likely {{to move on to the}} abstract principles, and thus have less concern with the particulars of who is involved. Consistent with this observation, Gilligan's theory of moral development does not focus on the value of justice. She developed an alternative theory of moral reasoning based on the ethics of caring. Critics such as Christina Hoff Sommers, however, argued that Gilligan's research is ill-founded, and that no evidence exists to support her conclusion.|$|E

He retired in 1973 and moved to Poughkeepsie, New York, where his wife Christine Mitchell, whom he had married in 1962, taught at Vassar College. He was a productive scholar after his retirement, writing three books as well as numerous essays and talks expanding <b>the</b> <b>arguments</b> <b>of</b> Preface to Plato to a generalised argument about the effect of literacy on Greek thought, literature, culture, society, and law.|$|E
5|$|The bending of the Laplace {{plane of}} the Solar System toward that of Planet Nine's orbit can produce the {{apparent}} clustering of the longitude of the ascending nodes and arguments of perihelion of the extreme TNOs. The Laplace plane defines the center about which the pole of an object's orbit precesses with time. At larger semi-major axes the angular momentum of Planet Nine causes the Laplace plane to bend toward that of its orbit. As a result, when the poles of the eTNO orbit precess about the Laplace plane, they tend to remain {{on one side of}} the ecliptic pole. For objects with small inclination relative to Planet Nine, which were found to be more stable in simulations, this off-center precession resembles a libration of the longitudes of ascending nodes with respect to the ecliptic making them appear clustered. In combination with the anti-alignment of the longitudes of perihelion this can also produce clustering of <b>the</b> <b>arguments</b> <b>of</b> perihelion.|$|E
5|$|The {{results of}} the Outer Solar System Survey (OSSOS) {{suggests}} that the observed clustering {{is the result of}} a combination of observing bias and small number statistics. OSSOS, a well-characterized survey of the outer Solar System with known biases, observed eight trans-Neptunian objects with semi-major axis > 150 AU with orbits oriented on a wide range of directions. After accounting for the known observational biases of the survey, no evidence for <b>the</b> <b>arguments</b> <b>of</b> perihelion (ω) clustering identified by Trujillo and Sheppard was seen and the orientation of the orbits of the objects with the largest semi-major axis was statistically consistent with random. A previously released paper by Mike Brown analyzed the discovery locations of eccentric trans-Neptunian objects. While identifying some biases he found that even with these biases the clustering of longitudes of perihelion of the known objects would be observed only 1.2% of the time if their actual distribution was uniform.|$|E

5|$|Trujillo and Sheppard {{in a paper}} {{announcing the}} {{discovery}} of several more distant objects noted a correlation between the longitude of perihelion and the argument of perihelion of these objects. Those with a longitude of perihelion of 0–120° have arguments of perihelion between 280–360°, and those with longitude of perihelion of 180–340° have argument of perihelion 0–40°. The statistical significance of this correlation was 99.99%. They suggest that the correlation {{is due to the}} orbits of these objects avoiding close approaches to Planet Nine by passing above or below its orbit. Trujillo and Sheppard also noted that <b>the</b> <b>arguments</b> <b>of</b> perihelion of ETNOs with perihelion less than 35 AU are opposite those with perihelion greater than 35 AU.|$|E
5|$|Cory Shankman et al. {{examined}} {{the consequences of}} a distant massive perturber on the TNOs used to infer the planet's existence. They simulated clones (objects with similar orbits) of 15 objects with semi-major axis > 150 AU and perihelion > 30 AU under the influence of a 10 Earth-massed Planet Nine in Batygin and Brown's best fit orbit. While longitude of perihelion alignment of the objects with semi-major axis > 250 AU was observed in their simulations, the alignment of <b>the</b> <b>arguments</b> <b>of</b> perihelion was not. The simulations also revealed an increase in the inclinations of many objects, thereby predicting a larger reservoir of high-inclination TNOs. These objects should have been detected in existing surveys but are still unseen so far—suggesting there is a currently missing or unseen signature of Planet Nine. A previously published paper concluded that current observations are insufficient to identify this signature, however. The perihelia of many of the objects also rose and fell smoothly, inconsistent with the current absence of extreme TNOs with perihelia between 50 AU and 70 AU. Their perihelia also reached values where the objects would not be observed and, after declining, fell low enough for the objects to enter planet-crossing orbits leading to their ejection from the Solar System. These factors would require a population of Sednas significantly larger than current estimates, and inconsistent with current models of the early Solar System, to explain current observations. Based on these challenges Shankman et al. concluded that the existence of Planet Nine is unlikely and that the currently observed alignment of the existing TNOs is a temporary phenomenon that will disappear as more objects are detected.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Paine was a noted {{writer and}} {{political}} theorist whose work had influenced and helped drive the American Revolution. Having returned to England, {{he decided to}} write a book addressing <b>the</b> <b>arguments</b> <b>of</b> Edmund Burke, a prominent conservative strongly fearful of the French Revolution. This was simply titled Rights of Man. The first part was published in 1791, and attracted no attention from Pitt's administration. The second, published on 16 February 1792, advocated, amongst other things, {{the right of the people}} to replace their government if they thought it appropriate. The work was an immediate success, selling a million and a half copies, and generated public support for various reform movements. It also brought Paine to the attention of the government and made him a subject to its crackdown. While Paine was visiting an aunt in Kent, Pitt had a writ issued against J.S. Jordan, Paine's publisher, prosecuting him for seditious libel—a crime based on the concept that the executive was beyond reproach, that made it illegal to criticise the government. Paine returned to London and began to campaign for Jordan, finding him a lawyer and agreeing to pay his legal fees. Jordan, however, most likely frightened for his life, pleaded guilty and turned his files over to the court. With this additional evidence, a writ was issued for Paine on 21 May, charging him with the same crime. His trial date was set for 8 June, and later rescheduled for 18 December.|$|E

5|$|As per Tulsidas, the Nirguna Brahman (quality-less impersonal absolute) and Saguna Brahman (personal God with qualities) {{are one and}} the same. Both, Saguna (qualified Brahman) and Aguna (or Nirguna - {{unqualified}} Brahman) are Akath (unspeakable), Agaadh (unfathomable), Anaadi (without beginning, {{in existence}} since eternity) and Anupa (without parallel) (अगुन सगुन दुइ ब्रह्म सरूपा। अकथ अगाध अनादि अनूपा॥). It is the devotion (Bhakti) of the devotee that forces the Nirguna Brahman which is quality-less, formless, invisible and unborn, to become Saguna Brahman with qualities. Tulsidas gives the example of water, snow and hail to explain this – the substance is the same in all three, but the same formless water solidifies to become hail or a mountain of snow – both of which have a form. Tulsidas also gives the simile of a lake – the Nirguna Brahman is like the lake with just water, while the Saguna Brahman is a lake resplendent with blooming lotuses. In the Uttar Kand of Ramcharitmanas, Tulsidas describes in detail a debate between Kakbhushundi and Lomasa about whether God is Nirguna (as argued by Lomasa adhering to monism) or Saguna (as argued by Kakbhushundi adhering to dualism). Kakbhushundi repeatedly refutes all <b>the</b> <b>arguments</b> <b>of</b> Lomasa, to the point when Lomasa becomes angry and curses Kakbhushundi to be a crow. Lomasa repents later when Kakbhushundi happily accepts the curse but refuses to give up the Bhakti of Rama, the Saguna Brahman. Though Tulsidas holds both aspects of God to be equal, he favours the qualified Saguna aspect and the devotees of the highest category in the Ramcharitmanas repeatedly ask for the qualified Saguna aspect of Rama to dwell in their mind. Some authors contend from a few couplets in Ramcharitmanas and Vinay Patrika that Tulsidas has vigorously contradicted the denial of Avatar by Kabir. In several of his works, Kabir had said that the actual Rama is not the son of Dasharatha. In the Balkand of Ramcharitmanas, Shiva tells Parvati – those who say that the Rama whom the Vedas sing of and whom the sages contemplate on is different from the Rama of Raghu's race are possessed by the devil of delusion and do not know the difference between truth and falsehood. However, such allusions are based on interpretations of the text and do not hold much water when considered in the context of Ramcharitmanas. Tulsidas, in none of his works, has ever mentioned Kabir.|$|E
