The only constraint is that excessive spending by any sector of the economy (whether households, firms or public) has the potential to cause inflationary pressures.|$|E

25|$|The {{export markets}} have been {{severely}} damaged by competition from cheaper Caribbean and Latin American competitors. But domestic manufacturing also faces serious potential problems, as trade liberalisation means <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>can</b> no longer protect national industries by imposing high tariffs on imported goods. Thus, Barbadian manufacturers must compete {{with those from}} other regional economies, whose wage costs and other overheads are usually much lower. The other significant industrial employer is the petroleum sector, where oil deposits {{are located in the}} southern parishes but oil has not been produced in commercial quantities; although the island's small oil refinery was closed in 1998 and refining moved to Trinidad and Tobago, where labour and other costs are cheaper.|$|E
25|$|However, Dede, {{whose wife}} and only child {{died in the}} explosion, {{believes}} that protests will never solve anything and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Government</b> <b>can</b> only listen through violence. Dede starts to have people on his side (including Tamuno, who was a dedicated police officer) after an incident in which the Army invades their village and rapes their women, {{right in front of}} them. Ebiere continues with her protests while Dede forms a militant group, showing their displeasure through violence, vandalism and kidnapping Western Oil officials. Western Oil eventually convinces Ebiere (who is now Dede's love interest) to help ask Dede and his group for dialogue with government. It {{turns out to be a}} ploy to get them arrested. A shoot-out occurs, leading to Dede and his group being killed.|$|E
500|$|Justice Kennedy {{delivered}} the majority opinion. It distinguished a 1991 Supreme Court case, Rust v. Sullivan, which upheld a prohibition on federally funded {{family planning services}} from discussing abortion with their patients. The majority reasoned that in Rust the government was attempting to use its funds to express its own message, but {{the purpose of the}} act was to promote a diversity of private views with its funding; not an attempt to restrict any views. The Court said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>can</b> only issue [...] "content-neutral" [...] conditions on such speech, and that the specific prohibition on welfare-reform litigation was viewpoint-based, as it restricted only support for welfare-reform advocacy. [...] "If the restriction on speech and legal advice were to stand, the result would be two tiers of cases ... there would be lingering doubt whether the truncated representation had resulted in complete analysis of the case, full advice to the client, and proper presentation to the court." ...|$|E

[...] The future world in Minority Report of retinal scans, robotic human inspectors, and intrusive, individualized, public advertising arrived in American theaters as the country was debating how much governmental intrusion into personal matters was necessary to ensure safety of its citizens. Spielberg said he would be against a PreCrime system if it were ever possible, as he believes that if it did exist, those in control of it would undoubtedly abuse its powers. Kowalski questions what the benevolent precogs in the film could become in the hands of those who trained their skills for political intrigue. Science fiction scholar Gary Westfahl asserts that in a political context, PreCrime may be seen [...] "a metaphor for racial profiling, and one could view the liberation of the precogs as the end of a form of slavery." ...|$|E

2500|$|... 2012 – In {{a report}} {{prepared}} for the US Congressman Hansen Clarke, R, researchers Ben Beachy and Juston Zorn, at John F. Kennedy School of Government in Harvard University, recommended that [...] "the Congress should prescribe the broad parameters of new, carefully designed supplemental national indicators; it should launch a bipartisan commission of experts to address unresolved methodological issues, and include alternative indicators." [...] They proposed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>can</b> use the survey results to see which well-being dimensions are least satisfied and which districts and demographic groups are most deficient, so as to allocate resources accordingly.

2500|$|The {{rational}} expectations hypothesis {{has been used}} to support some strong conclusions about economic policymaking. An example is the policy ineffectiveness proposition developed by Thomas Sargent and Neil Wallace. If the Federal Reserve attempts to lower unemployment through expansionary monetary policy economic agents will anticipate the effects of the change of policy and raise their expectations of future inflation accordingly. This in turn will counteract the expansionary effect of the increased money supply. All <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>can</b> do is raise the inflation rate, not employment. This is a distinctly New Classical outcome. During the 1970s {{rational expectations}} appeared to have made previous macroeconomic theory largely obsolete, which culminated with the Lucas critique. However, rational expectations theory has been widely adopted as a modelling assumption even outside of New Classical macroeconomics thanks to the work of New Keynesians such as Stanley Fischer.|$|E
40|$|The {{necessity}} {{of maintaining a}} balance between growth, employment and prices has always been in focus of economic policy debate. This piece of research is our modest contribution in the same direction. We explore {{the possibility of a}} simultaneous equilibrium of the mentioned three targets of national economic policy. Our empirical analysis show that a triangular equilibrium (what we call 'golden triangle') exists and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>governments</b> <b>can</b> follow a policy of close monitoring the behaviour of the three variables and support the 'optimum' rate through an active intervention. We have looked for <b>the</b> quantitative relations <b>that</b> exist between <b>the</b> key economic variables and economic policy goals.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between corporate social responsibility (CSR) and government. CSR is often viewed as self-regulation, devoid of <b>government.</b> We attribute <b>the</b> scholarly neglect {{of the variety of}} CSR-government relations to the inadequate attention paid to the important differences {{in the way in which}} CSR has 'travelled' (or diffused), and has been mediated by the national governance systems, and the insufficient emphasis given to the role of <b>the</b> <b>government</b> (or <b>government</b> agency) in <b>the</b> CSR domain. We go on to identify a number of different types of CSR-government configurations, and by following empirically the CSR development trajectories in Western Europe and East Asia in a comparative historical perspective, we derive a set of propositions on the changing dynamics of CSR-government configurations. In particular, we highlight <b>the</b> varied role <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>governments</b> <b>can</b> play in order to promote CSR in the context of the wider national governance systems. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC...|$|R

2500|$|Addressing Hamilton College students, Lord {{spoke of}} the {{necessity}} of the inclusion of the supernatural in Christian theology:A strong critic of Islam, in his lecture [...] "The Romance of History," [...] Lord defended the Crusades and harshly condemned the control of the Holy Land by Muslims, and also encouraged the conversion of the Jews:Lord publicized his view opposing slavery during the early 1850s, with a sermon published in newspapers in which he concludes that although God does not condone the practice, citizens have no right to oppose it as a legal and constitutional institution. The sermon caused a national controversy, as some incorrectly interpreted Lord's view as being <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>can</b> essentially make legal any sinful action legal or mandatory, including murder and theft, among others. He was called a Judas and a Benedict Arnold, although the controversy simmered out fairly quickly as his true views became clarified. Indeed, he was eventually commended by fellow clerics, and by President Millard Fillmore, who sent him the following letter: [...] Washington, D.C., Jan. 13, 1851'Rev. J. C. Lord, [...] My Dear Sir: “The cares of state” leave me no time for general reading, and it was not till this evening, that I found leisure to peruse your admirable sermon on the “Higher Law and Fugitive Slave Bill.” I return you my thanks, most cordially and sincerely, for this admirable discourse. You have rendered the nation a great and valuable service, and I am highly gratified to learn, that thousands and tens of thousands have been reprinted in New York, and sent here, and are now being distributed under the franks of members of Congress. It cannot fail to do good. It reaches a class of people of excellent intentions, but somewhat bigoted prejudices, who could be reached in no other way.

2500|$|After the evidentiary hearing {{discovered}} that evidence was withheld at the trial, Landano {{believed that the}} Court's ruling in Brady v. Maryland (373 U.S. 83) was violated when the prosecution in his murder trial withheld [...] "material exculpatory evidence" [...] (i.e. evidence extremely important for the defendant's case) during his trial. Landano filed FOIA requests with the FBI who had compiled evidence related to Landano's murder trial because, under the FOIA, anyone can request documents from any government agency to be released for whatever reason. However the FBI withheld some documents and redacted other documents without giving any reasons for doing so. Believing that this violated the FOIA, Landano brought his case to the Federal District Court {{in order to get}} the requested documents released. The FBI claimed that its withholding and redacting of documents was completely legal due to Exemption 7(D) of the Freedom of Information Act. Exemption 7(D) states <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>can</b> withhold information if [...] "records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes could reasonably be expected to disclose the identity of a confidential source --including a State, local, or foreign agency or authority or any private institution which furnished information on a confidential basis." [...] The Federal District Court stated that the FBI had to give a legitimate reason for the withholding of information given by anyone other than a regular law enforcement agency informant. The Court of Appeals agreed and rejected the FBI's argument that confidentiality can be presumed whenever an individual provides information to the FBI during a criminal investigation. The Court of Appeals also rejected the FBI's argument that confidentiality can be presumed based on an investigation's subject matter. Instead, the Court of Appeals held that the FBI had to provide a detailed explanation for each and every confidentiality claim it makes on a case-by-case basis instead of using a general guideline for what qualifies as confidential as it had done in response to Landano's requests.|$|E

60|$|If I {{be wrong}} on this {{question}} of constitutional power, my error lies in believing that certain proceedings are constitutional when, in cases of rebellion or invasion, the public safety requires them, which would not be constitutional when, in absence of rebellion or invasion, the public safety does not require them: in other words, that the Constitution is not in its application in all respects the same in cases of rebellion or invasion involving the public safety {{as it is in}} times of profound peace and public security. The Constitution itself makes the distinction, and I can no more be persuaded <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>can</b> constitutionally take no strong measures in time of rebellion, because it can be shown that the same could not be lawfully taken in times of peace, than I can be persuaded that a particular drug is not good medicine for a sick man because it can be shown to not be good food for a well one. Nor am I able to appreciate the danger apprehended by the meeting, that the American people will by means of military arrests during the rebellion lose the right of public discussion, the liberty of speech and the press, the law of evidence, trial by jury, and habeas corpus throughout the indefinite peaceful future which I trust lies before them, any more than I am able to believe that a man could contract so strong an appetite for emetics during temporary illness as to persist in feeding upon them during the remainder of his healthful life.|$|E
