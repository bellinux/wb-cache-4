In 1969, following the expansion, the operation began developing its own network <b>of</b> informants for <b>the</b> <b>purposes</b> <b>of</b> <b>infiltrating</b> various foreign antiwar groups located in foreign countries that might have ties to domestic groups. Eventually, CIA officers expanded the program to include other leftist or counter-cultural groups with no discernible connection to Vietnam, such as groups operating within the women's liberation movement.
