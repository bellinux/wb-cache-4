5|$|On 9 December 1983, a U.S. Air Force E-3 Sentry {{collided}} with a KC-135A <b>Tanker</b> <b>aircraft</b> over Saudi Arabia during Operation ELF-1. Both aircraft were recovered back to Riyadh Air Base. The Tanker received substantial damage, with parts impact and loss of pressure, as well as shut down of the two starboard engines. The E-3 received severe damage with the partial loss of a left wing section.|$|E

In February 2007, on the aircraft's first overseas deployment to Kadena Air Base, six F-22s of 27th Fighter Squadron flying from Hickam AFB, Hawaii, experienced multiple software-related system failures while crossing the International Date Line (180th meridian of longitude). The aircraft returned to Hawaii by following <b>tanker</b> <b>aircraft.</b> Within 48 hours, the error was resolved and the journey resumed. In early 2013, F-22s {{were involved in}} U.S.-South Korean military drills.|$|E
5|$|KC-767 Advanced Tanker â€“ the 767-200ER-based aerial tanker {{developed}} for the USAF KC-X tanker competition. It is {{an updated version of}} the KC-767, originally selected as the USAF's new <b>tanker</b> <b>aircraft</b> in 2003, designated KC-767A, and then dropped amid conflict of interest allegations. The KC-767 Advanced Tanker is derived from studies for a longer-range cargo version of the 767-200ER, and features a fly-by-wire refueling boom, a remote vision refueling system, and a 767-400ER-based flight deck with LCD screens and head-up displays. Boeing was awarded the KC-X contract to build a 767-based tanker, to be designated KC-46A, in February 2011.|$|E

The group was inactivated 1995 when K. I Sawyer was closed by Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC).|$|R
5|$|While {{assigned}} to the nuclear delivery role, the Victor was finished in an all-over anti-flash white colour scheme, {{designed to protect the}} aircraft against the damaging effects of a nuclear detonation. The white colour scheme was intended to reflect heat away from the aircraft; paler variations of RAF's roundels were also applied for this same reason. When the V-bombers were {{assigned to}} the low-level approach profile in the 1960s, the Victors were soon repainted in green/grey tactical camouflage to reduce visibility to ground observation; the same scheme was applied to subsequently converted <b>tanker</b> <b>aircraft.</b>|$|E
5|$|The first USAF E-3 was {{delivered}} in March 1977, {{and during the}} next seven years, a total of 34 aircraft were manufactured. NATO, as a single identity, also had 18 aircraft manufactured, basing them in Germany. The E-3 was also sold to the United Kingdom (seven) and France (four) and Saudi Arabia (five, plus eight E-3-derived <b>tanker</b> <b>aircraft).</b> In 1991, when the last aircraft had been delivered, E-3s participated in Operation Desert Storm, playing a crucial role of directing coalition aircraft against the enemy. Throughout the aircraft's service life, numerous upgrades were performed to enhance its capabilities. In 1996, Westinghouse Electric's Defense & Electronic Systems division, was acquired by Northrop Corporation before its being renamed Northrop Grumman Electronic Systems, which currently supports the E-3's radar.|$|E
5|$|The {{withdrawal}} of the Valiant fleet because of metal fatigue in December 1964 meant that the RAF had no front line <b>tanker</b> <b>aircraft,</b> so the B.1/1A aircraft, now judged to be surplus in the strategic bomber role, were refitted for this duty. To get some tankers into service as quickly as possible, six B.1A aircraft were converted to B(K).1A standard (later redesignated B.1A (K2P)), receiving a two-point system with a hose and drogue carried under each wing, while the bomb bay remained available for weapons. Handley Page worked day and night to convert these six aircraft, with the first being delivered on 28 April 1965, and 55 Squadron becoming operational in the tanker role in August 1965.|$|E

5|$|On 21 May 1956, a B-52B (52-0013) {{dropped a}} Mk-15 nuclear bomb over the Bikini Atoll {{in a test}} code-named Cherokee. It was the first air-dropped {{thermonuclear}} weapon. From 24 to 25 November 1956, four B-52Bs of the 93rd BW and four B-52Cs of the 42nd BW flew nonstop {{around the perimeter of}} North America in Operation Quick Kick, which covered 15,530miles (13,500nmi, 25,000km) in 31 hours, 30 minutes. SAC noted the flight time could have been reduced by 5 to 6 hours had the four inflight refuelings been done by fast jet-powered <b>tanker</b> <b>aircraft</b> rather than propeller-driven Boeing KC-97 Stratofreighters. In a demonstration of the B-52's global reach, from 16 to 18 January 1957, three B-52Bs made a non-stop flight around the world during Operation Power Flite, during which 24,325miles (21,145nmi, 39,165km) was covered in 45 hours 19 minutes (536.8 smph) with several in-flight refuelings by KC-97s.|$|E
5|$|The {{justification}} for the closure of Loring was that the Air Force had six more strategic bases than were needed to support the number of bomber and <b>tanker</b> <b>aircraft</b> in the Defense Department's Structure Plan. The base was evaluated against eight selection criteria {{and a large number}} of subelements specific to Air Force bases and missions. Even though Loring was in good condition and had strong community support, it ranked low in the criteria when compared to twenty other bases in the strategic category. One of the things that hurt Loring was its limited peacetime value as a tanker base, as well as its distance from bombing ranges. The commission did note that the facilities at Loring were above average, and the cost to close Loring would be low, the latter of which contributed to its closure.|$|E
25|$|The aerial {{fire-fighting}} operation {{consisted of}} two aircraft; the bird dog aircraft, a Rockwell Turbo Commander 690, and the <b>tanker</b> <b>aircraft,</b> Flight 448. The bird dog aircraft directed the <b>tanker</b> <b>aircraft</b> to {{the area where the}} fire retardant was to be released. On 31 July 2010 both of these aircraft took off from Kamloops Airport and proceeded to the wildfire. While making a bombing run, the <b>tanker</b> <b>aircraft</b> suddenly lost height and hit the trees, crashing into a ravine.|$|E

40|$|The Gravitational Motor {{is a type}} {{of motor}} which {{converts}} Gravitational Energy directly into Rotational Kinetic Energy. Its fuel is therefore the Gravitational Energy (no needs gasoline, oil, etc). An example of Gravitational Motor is the turbines of the hydroelectric plants. However, they are not mobile i. e., they cannot be transported {{from one place to another}} as the combustion motors or the electric motors. Mobiles Gravitational Motor can be developed starting from the devices of gravity control, such as the Quantum Controller of Gravity (QCG) [1]. The form of the QCG originally proposed is spherical. Here, it is described a Gravitational Motor which uses a QCG with spherical cylindrical form.
