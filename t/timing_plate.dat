30|$|At present, the PHS plate subducts to the NW {{along the}} Nankai Trough. However, {{it has been}} widely {{considered}} that the PHS plate moved to the NNW in the late Miocene, from surface geology and paleomagnetic data (Matsuda 1978; Seno and Maruyama 1984; Takahashi 2006). Striations of tremor activity beneath Shikoku also suggest that the PHS plate moved toward the NNW in the past (Ide 2010). On the other hand, there is disagreement on the <b>timing</b> of the <b>plate</b> motion change, which ranges from 10 to 4 [*]Ma (Seno and Maruyama 1984) to 1.0 – 0.5 [*]Ma (Hashima et al. 2016).

In the following analysis, {{it is assumed that}} the change in the PHS plate motion from NNW to NW occurred at 3 [*]Ma; this corresponds to the <b>timing</b> of the <b>plate</b> motion change adopted by Takahashi (2006, 2017), which is based on the timing of the Kurotaki Unconformity.|$|R

30|$|There {{were some}} {{limitations}} in this study. Firstly, {{the quality of}} studies for the meta-analysis was not high. Ideal evidence for systematic review is an RCT, which is most commonly used in testing the efficacy of surgery. Only 5 trials included were comparative studies (retrospective cohort studies) while 31 trials included were case series reports. This could be a possible source of bias between groups due to the opportunity for selection and different baseline characteristics. Secondly, heterogeneity remains an important factor {{to be considered in}} the conduct and interpretation of meta-analysis, and the heterogeneity between studies was great. We applied the random effects meta-analysis to adjust for the differences between studies, and the possible causes of heterogeneity were explored if covariate data at baseline (e.g., age, percentage of sex, type of AC injury, approach, number of bundle, <b>timing</b> of <b>plate</b> removal, duration before surgery and type of studies) were available. The third limitation is that indirect meta-analysis was used for calculating the mean difference and odds ratio between the two groups, {{due to the fact that}} most included studies were case series reports of only one technique. The fourth limitation is that there are other outcomes of interest that can be used to compare LSF and HP fixation such as operation cost or post-operative satisfaction and quality of life. However, these factors could not be analyzed because of insufficient data. The last limitation is that most studies had a mean follow up time of approximately 1 – 2  years; therefore mid-term to long-term effects of the different types of fixation are still unknown.|$|R
40|$|U-Pb dates on magmatic and {{detrital}} zircon from {{samples in}} the hinterland of the Taconic orogen place new {{constraints on the}} <b>timing</b> and <b>plate</b> tectonic geometry of terrane accretion and magmatic arc activity. The Moretown terrane, a Gondwanan-derived exotic block, extends from the Rowe Schist-Moretown Formation contact {{in the west to}} the Bronson Hill arc in the east. Arc-related plutonic and volcanic rocks formed above an east-dipping subduction zone under the western leading edge of the Moretown terrane from approximately 500 to 475 Ma, until collision with hyperextended distal fragments of Laurentia, represented by the Rowe Schist, at 475 Ma. Magmatic arc rocks formed during this interval are primarily located in the Shelburne Falls arc, although some are also located in the Bronson Hill arc to the east. Metasedimentary rocks in the Shelburne Falls arc contain detrital zircon derived from mixing of Gondwanan, Laurentian, and arc sources, suggesting that the Moretown terrane was proximal to Laurentia by 475 Ma. Explosive eruptions at 466 to 464 Ma preserved in the Barnard Volcanic Member of the Missisquoi Formation in Vermont and as ash beds in the Indian River Formation in the Taconic allochthons may record slab-breakoff of subducted lithosphere following collision of the Moretown terrane with distal Laurentian crustal fragments. Between 466 and 455 Ma a reversal in subduction polarity lead to a west-dipping subduction zone under Laurentia and the newly accreted Moretown terrane. Magmatic arc rocks in the Bronson Hill arc formed above this west-dipping subduction zone along the eastern trailing edge of the Moretown terrane at approximately 455 to 440 Ma.

40|$|BACKGROUND: It {{has been}} {{hypothesised}} that domestication altered {{the sequence of}} dental, skeletal, and sexual maturity of dogs when compared to their wolf ancestor. To test this we investigated a comprehensive sample of domestic dogs. METHODS: We documented the timing of completed eruption of permanent dentition into occlusion (dental maturity) and the <b>timing</b> of growth <b>plate</b> closure at the proximal humerus (skeletal maturity) in ontogenetic series of wolves and 15 domestic dog breeds. Data for 137 domestic dog and 64 wolf individuals were collected based on radiographs and examination of macerated bones. RESULTS: Our analyses show that domestic dogs exhibit a similar sequence of dental and skeletal maturity as the ancestral wolf. Although the absolute change of the age at attainment of sexual maturity is great in domestic dogs {{as compared to the}} wolf, the sequence of dental, skeletal, and sexual maturity is not altered as extensively, contradicting one previous hypothesis. Moreover, our data suggest that the chondrodystrophic dachshund attains skeletal maturity earlier than the non-chondrodystrophic breeds examined here. CONCLUSIONS: Domestic dogs are more wolf-like in terms of the sequence of dental, skeletal, and sexual maturation than previously hypothesised. This implies that the domestication process and/or breed formation did not {{have a major impact on}} this sequence, although the absolute values of life history variables do have a greater range of variation than in the wild wolf...|$|R
40|$|Earth's climate, mantle, {{and core}} {{interact}} over geologic timescales. Climate influences whether plate tectonics {{can take place}} on a planet, with cool climates being favorable for plate tectonics because they enhance stresses in the lithosphere, suppress plate boundary annealing, and promote hydration and weakening of the lithosphere. Plate tectonics plays {{a vital role in}} the long-term carbon cycle, which helps to maintain a temperate climate. Plate tectonics provides long-term cooling of the core, which is vital for generating a magnetic field, and the magnetic field is capable of shielding atmospheric volatiles from the solar wind. Coupling between climate, mantle, and core can potentially explain the divergent evolution of Earth and Venus. As Venus lies too close to the sun for liquid water to exist, there is no long-term carbon cycle and thus an extremely hot climate. Therefore plate tectonics cannot operate and a long-lived core dynamo cannot be sustained due to insufficient core cooling. On planets within the habitable zone where liquid water is possible, a wide range of evolutionary scenarios can take place depending on initial atmospheric composition, bulk volatile content, or the <b>timing</b> of when <b>plate</b> tectonics initiates, among other factors. Many of these evolutionary trajectories would render the planet uninhabitable. However, there is still significant uncertainty over the nature of the coupling between climate, mantle, and core.

TSP 5 mutations cause two skeletal dysplasias, pseudoachondroplasia and multiple epiphyseal dysplasia; both show a characteristic growth plate phenotype with retention of TSP 5, type IX collagen (Col 9), and matrillin- 3 in the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Whereas most studies focus on defining the disease process, few functional studies have been performed. TSP 5 knockout mice have no obvious skeletal abnormalities, suggesting that TSP 5 is not essential in the growth plate and/or that other TSPs may compensate. In contrast, Col 9 knockout mice have diminished matrillin- 3 levels in the {{extracellular matrix}} and early-onset osteoarthritis. To define the roles of TSP 1, TSP 3, TSP 5, and Col 9 in the growth plate, all knockout and combinatorial strains were analyzed using histomorphometric techniques. While significant alterations in growth plate organization were found in certain single knockout mouse strains, skeletal growth was only mildly disturbed. In contrast, dramatic changes in growth plate organization in TSP 3 / 5 /Col 9 knockout mice resulted in a 20 % reduction in limb length, corresponding to similar short stature in humans.

40|$|The CBM-TOF group aims at {{providing}} high π/k separation (more than 2 -σ in the reconstructed mass) in Au+Au central collisions at 25 GeV/A, with {{a coverage}} of midrapidity {{by at least}} 1 unit in y and 1 GeV in p T. ThesePId capabilities are needed for probing the QGP phase, through the study of such fundamental observables as the dynamical fluctuations of the kaon yield, kaon flow, hyperon production close to threshold and open charm. Based on simulation, it was shown that the mentioned requirements can be satisfied by a tRPC (<b>timing</b> Resistive <b>Plate</b> Chamber) wall placed at 10 m distance from the target with 25 - 30 ◦ coverage in θ (∼ 150 m 2), featuring a time resolution of 80 ps and an occupancy per cell below 5 % (∼ 60. 000 cells). In order to cope with the high beam luminosity, the tRPC must handle rates up to 20 kHz/cm 2, while the FEE must process the very fast GHz signals from the tRPC at an interaction rate up to 10 MHz. The CBM spectrometer benefits from the excellent overall PId capabilities of the TOF wall: for example, the π/e separation in time of flight is 3 -σ for p= 1. 1 GeV, that provides extra π suppression (apart from that of RICH and TRD detectors) in view of di-electron spectroscopy. Current R&D activities [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] focus on the development of high rate capability tRPCs, aiming at extending their working principle from few hundreds of Hz/cm 2 up to the required rate of 20 kHz/cm 2, for CBM usage. But also improvements on the description of the timing properties of the detector at high rates have been recently accomplished [6]. As a consequence of the latter, the idea that the deterioration of tRPC performances at high rates is mainly driven by the DC column resistivity ρd (resistivity times the resistive plate thickness per gap) is now more sound. electrons at the ELBE LINAC [2, 3] and with γ sources [4].

40|$|K-Ar whole-rock ages {{have been}} {{obtained}} for 30 samples from Sites 782 and 786, Ocean Drilling Program Leg 125 in the Izu-Bonin (Ogasawara) forearc region. They form a trimodal spread of ages between 9 Ma and 44 Ma and are, with a few exceptions, consistent with the inferred lithostratigraphy. The ages have been interpreted in terms {{of at least two}} distinct episodes of magmatic and/or hydrothermal activity. A group of ten samples, including the lava flows, gave an isochron age of 41. 3 ± 0. 5 Ma (middle-late Eocene). This is thought to represent the age of the principal magmatic development of the volcanic forearc basement, and is comparable to published ages on equivalent rocks {{from other parts of the}} forearc basement high (e. g., the Ogasawara Islands). It may be significant that this age is slightly younger than the <b>timing</b> of major <b>plate</b> reorganization in the Western Pacific at about 43 Ma. This was followed by a minor episode of intrusive magmatism at 34. 6 ± 0. 7 Ma (early Oligocene) which appears to have reset the ages of some of the earlier units. This event probably corresponds to the initiation of rifting of the "proto-arc" to form the Parece Vela Basin. Boninitic samples were erupted during both episodes of magmatism, the earlier being of low-Ca boninite type and the later being of medium and high-Ca types. It is also possible that a third episode of intrusive magmatism affected the Izu-Bonin forearc region at both Sites 782 and 786 at about 17 Ma. This would be consistent with magmatic activity elsewhere in the region during the Miocene, associated with the end of active spreading in the Parece Vela Basin and the start of arc activity in the West Mariana Ridg...|$|R
40|$|The tectonic {{evolution}} of a collisional hinterland sourcing the Haţeg Basin, a Late Cretaceous syn-orogenic sedimentary basin in the South Carpathians (Romania), is revealed through fission track thermochronology of detrital apatite and zircon grains. This basin formed on the upper plate (Getic unit) in response to Late Cretaceous collision with the lower plate (Danubian unit), an allochtonous continental block of the Moesian Platform, upon closure of a narrow oceanic basin (Severin Basin). The fission track results suggest that Turonian to lower Maastrichtian sediments of the Haţeg Basin have been dominantly derived from pre-Late Cretaceous sources. The age components they contain relate to pre-Cretaceous tectonothermal {{events such as the}} Variscan orogenic cycle, Jurassic rifting and Severin Basin formation, and to Early Cretaceous compressional tectonics. These results are compatible with the tectonic {{evolution of}} the upper plate that is identified as the primary source. From the onset of sedimentation (late Albian) until the early Campanian the Haţeg Basin resembles a piggy-back basin formed on the upper plate concomitant with underthrusting and internal stacking of the lower plate. In contrast, important tectonic subsidence during the late Campanian and early Maastrichtian reflects a shift to extensional tectonics causing the unroofing of the collision zone and the exhumation of lower plate rocks back to the surface. Our fission track data place important constraints on the <b>timing</b> of lower <b>plate</b> erosion that must have commenced during the late Maastrichtian, as documented by the completely reset Late Cretaceous age component within upper Maastrichtian sediments (Sinpetru Formation). Late Maastrichtian uplift of the basin and the formation of positive relief {{at the site of the}} collision zone is an expression of continuous convergence.

40|$|Triassic turbidites of the Nanpanjiang {{basin of}} south China {{represent}} the most expansive and voluminous siliciclastic turbidite accumulation in south China. The Nanpanjiang basin occurs {{at a critical}} junction between the southern margin of the south China plate and the Indochina, Siamo and Sibumasu plates {{to the south and}} southwest. The Triassic Yangtze carbonate shelf and isolated carbonated platforms in the basin have been extensively studied, but silicilastic turbidites in the basin have received relatively little attention. Deciphering the facies, paleocurrent indicators and provenance of the Triassic turbidites is important for several reasons: it promises to help resolve the <b>timing</b> of <b>plate</b> collisions along suture zones bordering the basin to the south and southwest, it will enable evaluation of which suture zones and Precambrian massifs were source areas, and it will allow an evaluation {{of the impact of the}} siliciclastic flux on carbonate platform evolution within the basin. Turbidites in the basin include the Early Triassic Shipao Formation and the Middle-Late Triassic Baifeng, Xinyuan, Lanmu Bianyang and Laishike formations. Each ranges upward of 700 m and the thickest is nearly 3 km. The turbidites contain very-fine sand in the northern part of the basin whereas the central and southern parts of the basin also commonly contain fine and rarely medium sand size. Coarser sand sizes occur where paleocurrents are from the south, and in this area some turbidites exhibit complete bouma sequences with graded A divisions. Successions contain numerous alternations between mud-rich and sand-rich intervals with thickness trends corresponding to proximal/ distal fan components. Spectacularly preserved sedimentary structures enable robust evaluation of turbidite systems and paleocurrent analyses. Analysis of paleocurrent measurements indicates two major directions of sediment fill. The northern part of the basin was sourced primarily by the Jiangnan massif in the northeast, and the central and southern parts of the basin were sourced primarily from suture zones and the Yunkai massif to the south and southeast respectively. Sandstones of the Lower Triassic Shipao Fm. have volcaniclastic composition including embayed quartz and glass shards. Middle Triassic sandstones are moderately mature, matrix-rich, lithic wackes. The average QFL ratio from all point count samples is 54. 1 / 18. 1 / 27. 8 % and the QmFLt ratio is 37. 8 / 18. 1 / 44. 1 %. Lithic fragments are dominantly claystone and siltstone clasts and metasedimentary clasts such as quartz mica tectonite. Volcanic lithics are rare. Most samples fall in the recycled orogen field of QmFLt plots, indicating a relatively quartz and lithic rich composition consistent with derivation from Precambrian massifs such as the Jiangnan, and Yunkai. A few samples from the southwest part of the basin fall into the dissected arc field, indicating a somewhat more lithic and feldspar-rich composition consistent with derivation from a suture zone Analysis of detrial zircon populations from 17 samples collected across the basin indicate: (1) Several samples contain zircons with concordant ages greater than 3000 Ma, (2) there are widespread peaks across the basin at 1800 Ma and 2500, (3) a widespread 900 Ma population, (3) a widespread population of zircons at 440 Ma, and (5) a larger population of younger zircons about 250 Ma in the southwestern part which is replaced to the north and northwest by a somewhat older population around 260 - 290 Ma. The 900 Ma provenance fits derivation from the Jiangnan Massif, the 2500, 1800, and 440 Ma provenance fits the Yunkai massif, and the 250 Ma is consistent with convergence and arc development in suture zones bordering the basin on the south or southwest. Early siliciclastic turbidite flux, proximal to source areas impacted carbonate platform evolution by infilling the basin, reducing accommodation space, stabilizing carbonate platform margins and promoting margin progradation.

40|$|Longitudinal bone growth {{occurs at}} the growth plate, {{a thin layer of}} {{cartilage}} between the epiphysis and the metaphysis of long bones. In the growth plate resting chondrocytes proliferate, differentiate into a hypertrophic form, and finally become terminal hypertrophic chondrocytes before giving rise to bone. Estrogen is essential for skeIetal growth. Extreme early puberty often leads to short stature, whereas significantly delayed puberty leads to increased final stature. Moreover, high doses of estrogen were used to prevent extreme tall stature in girls, but the treatment was associated with severe side effects. The effect of estrogen is mediated via two known estrogen receptors, ERalpha and ERbeta that are both expressed in growth plate chondrocytes. Although the effect of estrogen on bone growth is well known, the mechanism of action on longitudinal bone growth is poorly understood. We first studied longitudinal bone growth in female mice lacking ERalpha, ERbeta or both receptors (Paper I). Analysis of bone length and growth plate morphology revealed that ERbeta inhibits longitudinal bone growth. Moreover, in the presence of high serum concentrations of estrogen, stimulation of ERbeta induces growth plate fusion. Expression of both androgen and estrogen receptors were demonstrated within the growth plate. To study any co-interaction between estrogen and androgen receptors, we treated female ovariectomized rats with either estrogen, dihydrotestosterone (DHT) or the combination (Paper II). We found that estrogen inhibits longitudinal bone growth and growth plate height whereas DHT is able to counteract this effect. The effect is likely to be associated with systemic actions of these hormones since we found that decreased IGF-I levels in estrogen treated rats were restored by DHT. Estrogen regulates longitudinal bone growth either indirectly, via the modulation of the GH/IGF-I axis, or directly, via binding to estrogen receptors. Direct effects of estrogen were studied in a human chondrocytic cell line and in cultured fetal rat metatarsal bones (Paper III). We show that chondrocytes can synthesize estrogen by themselves and thereby mimic the effect of exogenous estrogen treatment. We also show that locally produced estrogen stimulates chondrocyte proliferation, inhibits apoptosis and maintains bone growth. Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) are promising drugs to modulate longitudinal growth offering fewer side-effects. We found that tamoxifen, a well known SERM, diminishes bone growth potential in cultured fetal rat metatarsal bones through selective apoptotic elimination of stem-like chondrocytes (Paper IV). Tamoxifen triggers the Fas/FasL apoptotic pathway and activates the caspases- 8, - 9 and 3. This thesis increases our understanding of how estrogen exerts its effect on longitudinal bone growth. This knowledge may be valuable for the development of new treatment strategies in children with growth disturbances, e. g. using SERMs to modulate the <b>timing</b> of growth <b>plate</b> fusion and thereby inhibit or stimulate the remaining growth potential...|$|R
