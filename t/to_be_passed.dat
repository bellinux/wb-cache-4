This initial letter opened a discussion on the types of assistance and intelligence that Arnold might provide, and included instructions for how to communicate in the future. Letters were <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>passed</b> through the women's circle that Peggy Arnold was a part of, but only Peggy would be aware that some letters contained instructions that were <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>passed</b> on to André, written in both code and invisible ink, using Stansbury as the courier.|$|E

A man's battalion and brigade commander tended to comment on his own record, but senior generals {{tended to be more}} concerned with the type of offence and the state of discipline in that unit. The Judge Advocate General at GHQ also checked the records for irregularities, before final confirmation (or otherwise) by the Commander-in-Chief of the relevant theatre.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, the United States Drug Enforcement Administration noted {{the drug was}} being used recreationally in California. It also {{reported}} that BZP was being used as an adulterant in illicit drugs. Not long after, {{there was an explosion}} in the drug's use worldwide – a situation which was soon followed by legislative control in many countries. Since 1999, benzylpiperazine use grew sharply in New Zealand due to an initial complete lack of regulation. The New Zealand government attempted to ban the product as of 18 December 2007, but the necessary second reading of the bill did not happen in time for the law <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>passed.</b> It was so widely used that an estimated 5 million pills were sold in New Zealand in 2007.|$|E
5|$|Poor {{breeding}} may {{be encouraged}} {{by the fact that}} many horses are sent to the breeding shed following an injury. If the injury is linked to a conformational fault, the fault is likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>passed</b> to the next generation. Additionally, some breeders will have a veterinarian perform straightening procedures on a horse with crooked legs. This can help increase the horse's price at a sale and perhaps help the horse have a sounder racing career, but the genes for poor legs will still be passed on.|$|E

5|$|On 17 and 18 June, Tonogal and Lieutenant Colonel Aganović, {{gendarmerie}} commander {{for eastern}} Herzegovina, made {{an attempt to}} calm the situation by visiting villages east of the Gacko–Avtovac road to re-establish peace in the area. They received a written message from four villages {{that they did not}} acknowledge the NDH authorities, and wanted the message <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>passed</b> on to the Italians. The residents of the villages of Jasenik and Lipnik were willing to talk and return to work, but they asked that the gendarmerie not visit their villages, as this would tempt the Montenegrins to attack. Aganović assessed that while this was probably true, their request was insincere. The gendarmerie commander in Bileća believed that the reason for the rebellion was that the local Serbs were wedded to the idea of Greater Serbia, and did not accept that their villages were part of the NDH. This approach essentially meant that local Serbs wanted the NDH authorities to leave them alone and not impose on their lives. According to the historian Davor Marijan, this was a poor choice that gave the Ustaše an excuse to take radical action.|$|E
5|$|On 20 October 1478, Catherine {{made her}} last will, {{recorded}} by a Dalmatian priest, {{in the presence}} of seven witnesses, six of whom were Franciscans of Ara Coeli. She expressed a wish to be buried before the main altar of Ara Coeli. Considering herself entitled to dispose of the Bosnian crown, she named Pope Sixtus IV and his successors guardians of the kingdom, obligating them to enthrone her son should he convert back to Christianity or else her daughter should she reconvert. Most of her personal belongings were inherited by her courtiers. Her chapel inventory was left to Saint Jerome's Church for the Slavic Nation, while the saint's relics were <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>passed</b> to Saint Mary's Church in Jajce. She decreed that, if her son never returned to the Christian faith, King Thomas's silver sword left in Dubrovnik for safekeeping should be handed to her nephew by Vladislav, Balša Hercegović. The Queen died five days after composing the will, which was immediately taken to the Pope along with her husband's sword and spurs.|$|E
5|$|On 21 January 2012, Wilkie {{announced}} that he was withdrawing his support for the Gillard Government after it broke the agreement he had signed with Gillard to implement mandatory pre-commitment for all poker machines by 2014. He stated that he would support the government's alternative plan to trial pre-commitment in the ACT and require that pre-commitment technology be installed in all poker machines built from 2013, but that this fell short of what he had been promised in return for supporting the government. In response, Gillard and Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs Jenny Macklin argued that there was not enough support in the House of Representatives for Wilkie's preferred option for it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>passed,</b> and that they had been advised it was technically unfeasible to implement mandatory commitment within the time frame he had specified.|$|E

5|$|On March31 {{the insurgents}} kept their {{part of the}} {{agreement}} by allowing the supply bill <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>passed</b> on second reading and the budget to be hoisted for ninety days. However, when the cabinet introduced its promised bill, the insurgents claimed {{that it was not}} as agreed and refused to support it. Instead, they demanded Aberhart's resignation and announced that they were prepared to take over the government within 24hours. A delegation put this demand to Aberhart in the evening of March31; according to them, he agreed to resign if they allowed the supply bill to pass a third reading. They did so, but Aberhart denied that he had agreed to resign and refused to do so unless he was defeated in a general election. The insurgents, leery of Aberhart's oratorical powers and the reach of his weekly radio show, wanted to avoid an election. Even so, they rejected a motion by Low to raise their pay for the session by $200, seeing it as a crass bribe.|$|E
5|$|Sercey {{was unaware}} of how {{scattered}} British forces were in the region, and sent Alerte to scout ahead after the squadron arrived off Ceylon. Captain Drieu of Alerte made the miscalculation of attacking a ship on 14 August {{which turned out to}} be the 28-gun British dispatch frigate HMS Carysfort, and on board Alerte the British captors discovered documents revealing the exact extent of Sercey's strength and intentions. Carysforts captain was unable to warn any allied ships as his small frigate was the only British warship in the Bay of Bengal, and so he instead arranged for false information <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>passed</b> to Sercey regarding a fictional British battle squadron at Madras. This was sufficient to deter Sercey from lingering in the area, and after a raiding sweep along the coast to Tranquebar his squadron sailed eastwards once more.|$|E
5|$|The House of Lords Select Committee {{assigned}} {{to deal with}} the bill was chaired by Lord Cromer and sat during November and December 1908. After several sessions, the committee declared several important decisions. It reaffirmed that federation would benefit {{of the people of the}} Potteries, that a differential rating system for a fixed period was required, that asset valuation in each town should be abandoned, and that the committee reserved the right to decide a course of action should the parties not be able to reach agreement. This last point was important because without it all disputes would have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>passed</b> back either to the Local Government Board or the House of Commons. With prorogation of the current Parliament on the horizon, this would have led to delays that jeopardised the passage of the whole bill through Parliament during that parliamentary session.|$|E

5|$|Three JNA officers, Mile Mrkšić; Veselin Šljivančanin; and Miroslav Radić, {{were indicted}} by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) on {{multiple}} counts {{of crimes against}} humanity and violations {{of the laws of}} war, having surrendered or been captured during 2002 and 2003. On 27 September 2007, Mrkšić was sentenced by the ICTY to 20 years' imprisonment for murder and torture, and Šljivančanin was sentenced to five years' imprisonment on charges of torture. Radić was acquitted. Šljivančanin's sentence was increased to 17 years on appeal, then reduced again to ten years after a second appeal, and he was granted early release in July 2011. Slavko Dokmanović, the Serb mayor of Vukovar, was also indicted and arrested {{for his role in the}} massacre, but committed suicide in June 1998, shortly before judgement was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>passed.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{defeating}} Baramos in {{a ferocious}} battle {{and returning to}} Aliahan, the Hero's celebration is cut off as Zoma, Baramos's master and the game's true villain, reveals his existence. He attacks and opens a pit to the Dark World, which the Hero jumps into. The Dark World is, in fact, Alefgard (of the previous installments of the series), where the Hero must acquire several of the artifacts that were collected in the original Dragon Quest, including the Sun Stone and the Rain Staff. Rubiss, a legendary sage, has been turned to stone and is rescued by the Hero, and the Hero receives the Sacred Amulet in return. These items, as in the original game, create the Rainbow Bridge which leads the Hero to Zoma's castle for the final confrontation. Along the way, the Hero briefly reunites with Ortega as he is slain by Zoma's monsters, then continues on to defeat the revived Baramos, now turned into the powerful Baramos Bomus and later into the skeletal Baramos Gonus. With the Ball of Light given by the Dragon Queen, the Hero defeats Zoma and frees Alefgard, but Zoma boasts that evil will eventually return {{to the land and}} the Hero will not live long enough to stop it. For their bravery, the Hero receives the title of Loto (Erdrick). The Hero later vanishes from Alefgard, leaving their sword and armor <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>passed</b> down throughout the ages so that their descendants can continue to protect the world from evil.|$|E
5|$|An individual's {{mitochondrial}} {{genes are}} not inherited {{by the same}} mechanism as nuclear genes. Typically, the mitochondria are inherited from one parent only. In humans, when an egg cell is fertilized by a sperm, the egg nucleus and sperm nucleus each contribute equally to the genetic makeup of the zygote nucleus. In contrast, the mitochondria, and therefore the mitochondrial DNA, usually come from the egg only. The sperm's mitochondria enter the egg, but do not contribute genetic information to the embryo. Instead, paternal mitochondria are marked with ubiquitin to select them for later destruction inside the embryo. The egg cell contains relatively few mitochondria, but it is these mitochondria that survive and divide to populate {{the cells of the}} adult organism. Mitochondria are, therefore, in most cases inherited only from mothers, a pattern known as maternal inheritance. This mode is seen in most organisms, including the majority of animals. However, mitochondria in some species can sometimes be inherited paternally. This is the norm among certain coniferous plants, although not in pine trees and yews. For Mytilids, paternal inheritance only occurs within males of the species. It has been suggested that it occurs at a very low level in humans. There is a recent suggestion that mitochondria that shorten male lifespan stay in the system because they are inherited only through the mother. By contrast, natural selection weeds out mitochondria that reduce female survival as such mitochondria are less likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>passed</b> on to the next generation. Therefore, it is suggested that human females and female animals tend to live longer than males. The authors claim that this is a partial explanation.|$|E

5|$|For a long time, the Megami Tensei {{franchise}} was not {{exported to}} western territories despite {{there being a}} recognized market. The original reasons were the heavy religious themes and symbols used, which were considered taboo in western game markets, and Nintendo's strict content guidelines for overseas releases. Later, many of these early works were prevented from coming overseas due to their age, which would have put them at a disadvantage in the modern gaming market. Early entries on the PlayStation were also blocked by Sony of America's then-current approval policies. The first title in the franchise to be localized was Jack Bros.; the first role-playing game in the franchise to receive an overseas release was the first Persona game. This was done to give Atlus' North American branch a flagship RPG franchise that could compete {{with the likes of}} Final Fantasy, Suikoden and Breath of Fire. According to Okada, the naming of creatures and enemies was adjusted from the main series and original Japanese release of Persona to make it more acceptable for an overseas audience. Though it managed to establish the franchise overseas, the localization was a taxing task due to a small staff and the need to change multiple aspects to suit a North American audience, including removing references to Japanese culture and changing one character from Japanese to African-American. The first Persona 2 title, Innocent Sin, needed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>passed</b> over due to shortage of manpower and the fact that development was focused on the second title, Eternal Punishment.|$|E
5|$|Monarchs of the Muhammad Ali dynasty reigned over Egypt from 1805 to 1953. Their rule also {{extended}} to Sudan {{throughout much of}} this period, {{as well as to}} the Levant, and Hejaz during the first half of the 19th century. The Muhammad Ali dynasty was founded by Muhammad Ali Pasha, an Albanian commander in the expeditionary force sent by the Ottoman Empire in 1801 to dislodge the French occupation of Egypt led by Napoleon Bonaparte. The defeat and departure of the French left a power vacuum in Egypt, which had been an Ottoman province since the 16th century, but in which the pre-Ottoman Mamluk military caste maintained considerable power. After a three-year civil war, Muhammad Ali managed to consolidate his control over Egypt, and declared himself Khedive of the country. The Ottoman Porte refused to acknowledge this title, instead recognizing Muhammad Ali by the more junior title of Wāli (meaning governor or viceroy) on 18 June 1805, making Muhammad Ali the successor to Ahmad Khurshid Pasha in that position. In the years following his consolidation of power, Muhammad Ali extended Egypt's borders south into Sudan, and eastwards into the Arab Mashreq, particularly the Levant. In 1840, his demand for hereditary control of Egypt and Sudan <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>passed</b> to his heirs and successors was accepted and confirmed by the Convention of London, but he was compelled to agree that, upon his death, control over his territories in the Mashreq would revert to the Porte.|$|E
5|$|Phantom Blood {{was created}} using a ki-shō-ten-ketsu {{structure}} – introduction (ki), development (shō), twist (ten), and resolution (ketsu) – {{along with the}} rule of rising and falling, in which the hero must grow over time {{in relation to their}} starting point {{in the beginning of the}} story, and not stagnate or regress. Araki did however note that due to the weekly format of the series, Jonathan's initial regression when Dio turns Jonathan's happy life into hardships meant that Jonathan's growth remained in the negative for a few weeks after the series' premiere, leading to a negative feeling that Jonathan always loses. Araki implemented a similar growth curve for Dio, although with him rising towards evil. Despite following the rule of the ever-progressing hero, Araki decided to bend the rule and have Jonathan die to save his wife and child: he acknowledged that dying is as far negative as a hero can go, and called it unthinkable to do such a thing in a shōnen manga, but said that since he wanted to pass down the Joestar family's lineage, he needed Jonathan to die, and for his blood and spirit <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>passed</b> to Joseph, the protagonist of Battle Tendency, the second part in the series. While calling it a gamble, he called this passing of the torch a positive that enables the extreme negative of killing the first protagonist.|$|E
