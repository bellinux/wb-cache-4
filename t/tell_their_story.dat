5|$|Protected against double jeopardy, Bryant and Milam {{struck a}} deal with Look {{magazine}} in 1956 to <b>tell</b> <b>their</b> <b>story</b> to journalist William Bradford Huie for between $3,600 and $4,000. The interview took place in the law firm of the attorneys who had defended Bryant and Milam. Huie did not ask the questions; Bryant and Milam's own attorneys did. Neither attorney had heard their clients' accounts of the murder before. According to Huie, the older Milam was more articulate and sure of himself than the younger Bryant. Milam admitted to shooting Till and neither of them believed they were guilty or that they had done anything wrong.|$|E

25|$|The Star Wars saga has {{inspired}} many fans {{to create their}} own non-canon material set in the Star Wars galaxy. In recent years, this has ranged from writing fan-fiction to creating fan films. In 2002, Lucasfilm sponsored the first annual Official Star Wars Fan Film Awards, officially recognizing filmmakers and the genre. Because of concerns over potential copyright and trademark issues, however, the contest was initially open only to parodies, mockumentaries, and documentaries. Fan-fiction films set in the Star Wars universe were originally ineligible, but in 2007 Lucasfilm changed the submission standards to allow in-universe fiction entries. Lucasfilm, for the most part, has allowed but not endorsed the creation of these derivative fan-fiction works, so long as no such work attempts to make a profit from or tarnish the Star Wars franchise in any way. While many fan films have used elements from the licensed Expanded Universe to <b>tell</b> <b>their</b> <b>story,</b> they are not considered an official part of the Star Wars canon.|$|E

To him, investigating geology brought reasoning into play and gave him opportunities for theorising.|$|E

[...] The first of those was Leslie Arzt, only for him to explode a few episodes later. It was originally conceived only a woman, who was previously an actress, would be introduced into the main storyline, but the idea later changed to include her boyfriend as well. Nikki and Paulo were also originally set [...] "to have anchored a winking arc of stories". However the writers instead decided to <b>tell</b> <b>their</b> <b>story</b> in one episode and quickly remove the characters, due to complaints about the characters and the third season's decline in viewership. It also became a running gag that Sawyer did not know who Nikki and Paulo were, calling them [...] "Nina" [...] and [...] "Pablo" [...] and asking [...] "who the hell [...] ". Lindelof later stated, [...] "We had the feeling with Nikki and Paulo that it wasn't right about a month before the fans started reacting.

2500|$|Exploration {{games or}} {{exploration}} narrative games are narrative games that generally eschew {{any type of}} gameplay outside of movement and environmental interaction that allow players to experience their story through exploration and discovery. They are story-focused and feature fewer puzzles or even no puzzles at all. They allow players to roam around a garden-like environment freely and often <b>tell</b> <b>their</b> <b>story</b> through discovering elements like books, journals, or clues rather than through dialog and cutscenes as in more traditional adventure games. As win/lose conditions are de-emphasized, story and atmosphere are placed at the forefront. These may also be called walking simulators, although some people consider the latter a pejorative term. [...] Some examples of exploration games include Gone Home, Dear Esther, Firewatch, The Stanley Parable, Jazzpunk, and Thirty Flights of Loving.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the wake}} of 1993 child sexual abuse accusations against Michael Jackson, Barresi was asked by French {{nationals}} Stella Marcroft (a former girlfriend of Barresi’s) and her common law husband Philippe Lemarque to help them sell a story of allegedly having witnessed Jackson molest child actor Macaulay Culkin while under Jackson’s employ at the Neverland Ranch in 1991. They promised Barresi 10% of whatever number he could get for them, however, the offer had to be no less than $100,000. Within three days Barresi got them an offer from Jerry George at the National Enquirer of $150,000, cash on the table, however in the interim the apparently greedy French couple went over Barresi’s head by finding a Beverly Hills lawyer Arnold Kessler, who persuaded them to dismiss Barresi and refuse Enquirer’s offer; promising a much bigger pay day {{to the tune of}} a half a million dollars for their story. [...] It did not take long for Barresi to learn of the French couple's betrayal; after which he immediately went into action by secretly tapping them <b>tell</b> <b>their</b> <b>story</b> once again about how they allegedly saw Jackson inappropriately touching Culkin.|$|E
