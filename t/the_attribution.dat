5|$|Ecgbert (diedNovember 766) was an 8th-century cleric who {{established}} {{the archdiocese of}} York in 735. In 737, Ecgbert's brother became king of Northumbria and the two siblings worked together on ecclesiastical issues. Ecgbert was a correspondent of Bede and Boniface {{and the author of}} a legal code for his clergy.

5|$|I do not, and I have {{no doubt}} your Lordships do not, have any wish to expand {{the role of the}} {{judiciary}} at the expense of any other organ of the State or to seek to frustrate the properly expressed wish of Parliament as contained in legislation. <b>The</b> <b>attribution</b> in certain quarters of such a wish to the judiciary is misconceived and appears to be the product of lack of understanding of the judicial function and the sources of law which the courts are bound to apply.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} that <b>the</b> <b>attribution</b> to book three was simply incorrect, and Atalante's Ehoie came within the family of Athamas in books one or two.

40|$|Objectives: There {{is now a}} body of {{research}} into <b>the</b> <b>attributions</b> that carers make of the challenging behavior of people with intellectual disabilities; however <b>the</b> <b>attributions</b> that people with intellectual disabilities make have not been studied. This paper describes <b>the</b> <b>attributions</b> that people with intellectual disabilities make of challenging behavior and compares them to those of their carers. Methods: Twenty-three day-service staff and 34 adults with intellectual disabilities completed measures of attribution, optimism, emotion and need for help and gave open-ended responses to questions about the causes of and potential interventions for challenging behaviors. Results: The overall pattern of attribution, emotion, optimism and intention to help is similar for people with intellectual disabilities and staff. However, compared to staff, people with intellectual disabilities were less optimistic and less happy about challenging behavior. Conclusions: This area {{of research}} will help identify the impacts of challenging behavior on the well being of people with intellectual disabilities and may help structure support for people who live alongside those who challenge...|$|R

5|$|The National Gallery {{has also}} been criticised for misattributing paintings. Kenneth Clark's {{decision}} in 1939 to relabel a group of paintings by anonymous artists of the Venetian school as works by Giorgione (a crowd-pulling artist due to the rarity of his paintings) made him unpopular with his staff. More recently, <b>the</b> <b>attribution</b> of a 17th-century painting of Samson and Delilah (bought in 1980) to Rubens has been contested {{by a group of}} art historians, who believe that the National Gallery has not admitted the mistake to avoid embarrassing those {{who were involved in the}} purchase, many of whom still work for the Gallery.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>attribution</b> of {{the panel}} {{reflects}} the progression and trends of 19th and 20th-century scholarship on Early Netherlandish art. It is now {{thought to have been}} completed c. 1438–40, but there are still arguments for dates as early as 1424–29. As with the pages ascribed to Hand G in the Turin-Milan Hours manuscript, the panel was attributed to Jan's brother Hubert van Eyck in the 1875 Gemäldegalerie catalogue, and by a 1911 claim by art historian Georges Hulin de Loo. This is no longer considered credible and Hubert, today, is credited with very few works. By 1912 the painting had been definitively attributed to Jan in the museum catalogue.|$|E
5|$|The {{director}} {{of the film is}} not known, but two possibles exist. Barry O'Neil was the stage name of Thomas J. McCarthy, who would direct many important Thanhouser pictures, including its first two-reeler, Romeo and Juliet. Lloyd B. Carleton was the stage name of Carleton B. Little, a director who would stay with the Thanhouser Company until moving to the Biograph Company by the summer of 1910. The confusion between the directing credits stems from the industry practice of not crediting the film directors, even in studio news releases. Q. David Bowers says that <b>the</b> <b>attribution</b> of these early directors often comes from a collection of contemporary publications or interviews.|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} {{whether the}} association between marital distress and attributions is an artifact of depression. Study 1 showed that <b>the</b> <b>attributions</b> of 40 wives recruited from the community ac-counted for variance in their marital satisfaction after the effects of depression had been taken into account. Study 2 compared <b>the</b> <b>attributions</b> of 20 clinically depressed and maritally distressed wives (respondents to an advertisement offering therapy for depression and marital problems), 20 nonde-pressed but distressed wives (clients seeking marital therapy at a clinic), and a control group of 20 nondepressed and nondistressed wives (respondents to an advertisement for participants in a re-search project). The first two {{groups did not differ}} in <b>attributions,</b> but <b>the</b> <b>attributions</b> of both groups differed from those of the control group. Both studies therefore suggest that <b>the</b> association between <b>attributions</b> and marital satisfaction is not due to depression. Compared with happily married spouses, distressed spouses tend to make <b>attributions</b> that accentuate <b>the</b> impact of nega-tive marital events and minimize the impact of positive marital events (see Bradbury & Fincham, in press). Despite its implica-tions for clinical practice, little research exists concerning wh...|$|R

5|$|The {{taking of}} black swans to Europe in the 18th and early 19th centuries brought the birds {{into contact with}} another aspect of European mythology: <b>the</b> <b>attribution</b> of {{sinister}} relationships between the devil and black-coloured animals, such as a black cat.

5|$|The tomb monument's design {{included}} {{figures of}} the three Virtues in niches, Cossa's family arms, a gilded bronze recumbent effigy laid out above an inscription-bearing sarcophagus supported on corbel brackets, and above it a Madonna and Child in a half-lunette, with a canopy over all. At {{the time of its}} completion, the monument was the tallest sculpture in Florence, and one of very few tombs within the Baptistry or the neighboring Duomo. The tomb monument was the first of several collaborations between Donatello and Michelozzo, and <b>the</b> <b>attribution</b> of its various elements to each of them has been debated by art historians, as have the interpretations of its design and iconography.|$|E
5|$|Garamond {{designed}} type for the Greek alphabet {{from the}} beginning of his attested career, but his most celebrated work in Greek, the Grecs du roi fonts, commissioned for the French government in 1540, are very different to his Latin designs: they attempt to simulate the elegant handwriting of Cretan scribe Angelo Vergecio and include a vast variety of alternate letters and ligatures to achieve this. This style is impractical for modern setting of body text, since it requires careful manual choice of characters for every word. Several 'Garamond' releases such as Adobe's contain Greek designs that are either a compromise between Garamond's upright Latin designs and his slanted Greek ones or primarily inspired by his Latin designs. The grecs du roi type, the contract for which survives, is the type with which Garamond enters the historical record, although it is clearly not the work of a beginner. Earlier fonts that may have been cut by Garamond have been suggested but <b>the</b> <b>attribution</b> is less certain.|$|E

5|$|In 1907, the French chemist Georges Urbain {{separated}} Marignac's ytterbia {{into two}} components: neoytterbia and lutecia. Neoytterbia later {{became known as}} the element ytterbium, and lutecia {{became known as the}} element lutetium. The Austrian chemist Carl Auer von Welsbach independently isolated these elements from ytterbia at about the same time, but he called them aldebaranium and cassiopeium; the American chemist Charles James also independently isolated these elements at about the same time. Urbain and Welsbach accused each other of publishing results based on the other party. The Commission on Atomic Mass, consisting of Frank Wigglesworth Clarke, Wilhelm Ostwald, and Georges Urbain, which was then responsible for <b>the</b> <b>attribution</b> of new element names, settled the dispute in 1909 by granting priority to Urbain and adopting his names as official ones, {{based on the fact that}} the separation of lutetium from Marignac's ytterbium was first described by Urbain. After Urbain's names were recognized, neoytterbium was reverted to ytterbium.|$|E
5|$|Prokofiev was a soloist {{with the}} London Symphony Orchestra, {{conducted}} by Piero Coppola, {{in the first}} recording of his Piano Concerto No. 3, recorded in London by His Master's Voice in June 1932. Prokofiev also recorded some of his solo piano music for HMV in Paris in February 1935; these recordings were issued on CD by Pearl and Naxos. In 1938, he conducted the Moscow Philharmonic Orchestra in a recording of the second suite from his Romeo and Juliet ballet; this performance was later released on LP and CD. Another reported recording with Prokofiev and the Moscow Philharmonic was of the First Violin Concerto with David Oistrakh as soloist; Everest Records later released this recording on an LP. Despite <b>the</b> <b>attribution,</b> the conductor was Aleksandr Gauk. A short sound film of Prokofiev playing some of the music from his opera War and Peace and then explaining the music has been discovered.|$|E
5|$|The Italian Lives {{constitute}} {{the first two}} volumes of Lives of the Most Eminent Literary and Scientific Men of Italy, Spain and Portugal. The poet, journalist, and literary historian James Montgomery contributed the biographies of Dante, Ariosto, and Tasso. Historian of science Sir David Brewster contributed that of Galileo. Mary Shelley contributed the rest: Petrarch, Boccaccio, Lorenzo de'Medici, Marsiglio Ficino, Giovanni Pico della Mirandola, Angelo Poliziano, Bernardo Pulci, Luca Pulci, Luigi Pulci, Cieco Da Ferrara, Burchiello, Bojardo, Berni, Machiavelli, Guicciardini, Vittoria Colonna, Guarini, Chiabrera, Tassoni, Marini, Filicaja, Metastasio, Goldoni, Alfieri, Monti, and Ugo Foscolo. Although {{there has been some}} confusion regarding <b>the</b> <b>attribution</b> of these biographies, the Livess recent editor, Tilar Mazzeo, notes that Shelley claimed authorship of all of these and granted Montgomery and Brewster's authorship of the others in her letters.|$|E
