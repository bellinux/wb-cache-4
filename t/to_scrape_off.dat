5|$|Larvae {{of members}} of the family Glossosomatidae in the {{suborder}} Spicipalpia create dome-shaped enclosures of silk which enables them to graze on the periphyton, the biological film that grows on stones and other objects, while carrying their enclosure around like turtles. In the family Philopotamidae, the nets are sac-like, with intricate structure and tiny mesh. The larvae have specialised mouthparts <b>to</b> <b>scrape</b> <b>off</b> the microflora that get trapped in the net as water flows through.|$|E
5|$|On the {{infrequent}} {{occasions when}} they swim in oceanic waters, grey reef sharks often associate with marine mammals or large pelagic fishes, such as sailfish (Istiophorus platypterus). There is {{an account of}} around 25 grey reef sharks following a large pod of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops sp.), along with 25 silky sharks (C. falciformis) and a single silvertip shark. Rainbow runners (Elagatis bipinnulata) have been observed rubbing against grey reef sharks, using the sharks' rough skin <b>to</b> <b>scrape</b> <b>off</b> parasites.|$|E
5|$|Though silvertip {{sharks are}} quite mobile, they exhibit {{fidelity}} to certain areas {{and there are}} reports of territorial behavior. They are usually encountered alone or in pairs. Small groups of adult females have been seen in deep water. Individual silvertip sharks behave very aggressively towards one another, and many are heavily scarred. They are also reported to dominate Galapagos sharks (C. galapagensis) and blacktip sharks (C. limbatus) of equal size when competing for food. This shark sometimes forms mixed-species aggregations with grey reef sharks. Rainbow runners (Elagatis bipinnulata) have been observed rubbing against silvertip sharks, using the sharks' rough skin <b>to</b> <b>scrape</b> <b>off</b> parasites. They sometimes follow marine mammals such as bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops sp.) in open water, and are themselves followed by pilot fish (Naucrates ductor).|$|E
5000|$|The boat {{made its}} first foray outside Russia in 1997 when it was {{displayed}} in the Winter Garden Atrium of the World Financial Center in New York City. While being displayed {{as part of the}} [...] "St. Petersburg: A Cultural Celebration" [...] festival, the boat was attended to by two preservationists. The preservationists attempted to identify the species of oak used in the boat so that the country of origin could be determined in addition <b>to</b> <b>scraping</b> <b>off</b> dirt and patching cracks.|$|R

50|$|The {{sea apple}} feeds {{primarily}} on plankton, which it filters {{from the water}} with its tentacles. It alternately brings each tentacle <b>to</b> its mouth, <b>scraping</b> <b>off</b> the captured plankton.|$|R
25|$|People wore {{waterproof}} salmon-skin mittens to {{keep their}} hands dry while kayaking, driving a dog sled, or working with fish nets. Woven seashore grass liners went inside for warmth. To prepare the fish skins, they were first soaked in urine, scraped clean, and then hung outside to freeze-dry in cold weather. The last step was <b>to</b> <b>scrape</b> <b>off</b> the scales.|$|E
25|$|To {{help prepare}} for the {{eventual}} invasion of American forces, Fertig even had airstrips prepared and disguised, one as long as 7,000feet which took over a year to build. The airstrips were built and then covered with topsoil and planted with crops. All that was needed was a bulldozer <b>to</b> <b>scrape</b> <b>off</b> the topsoil and the airstrip would then be ready for planes. Some of these airstrips were later used by U.S. Marine Corps squadrons to provide close-air support during the invasion.|$|E
25|$|In the 18th and 19th centuries, {{the methods}} used to extract lead from its ore {{produced}} large amounts of toxic fumes. In the north of England, long near-horizontal chimneys were built, often more than 3km (2mi) long, which typically terminated in a short vertical chimney in a remote location where the fumes would cause less harm. Lead and silver deposits formed {{on the inside of}} these long chimneys, and periodically workers would be sent along the chimneys <b>to</b> <b>scrape</b> <b>off</b> these valuable deposits.|$|E
5|$|Bo Randall {{first became}} {{interested}} in making knives after he purchased a Bill Scagel knife that was being used <b>to</b> <b>scrape</b> paint <b>off</b> of a boat without showing any signs of wear or damage. He made his first knife in his garage at Lake Ivanhoe, Florida using an auto spring.|$|R
50|$|In his old age, {{his vision}} was badly impaired, {{so that he}} was barely able to see what he was doing. When he put the paint on the panels so thickly that no one liked it, the paint often needed <b>to</b> be <b>scraped</b> <b>off</b> again, which upset him because he felt no one {{appreciated}} his work.|$|R
25|$|It is, however, not comfortable, for {{two reasons}} which work together: the cervix is full of nociceptors, and the brush used to collect cells has to be stiff enough <b>to</b> <b>scrape</b> them <b>off</b> of the {{surrounding}} tissue. So it can be uncomfortable, but it is generally quick, and the information obtained may be critical.|$|R
25|$|For example, {{the primary}} food source of {{butterflyfishes}} are the coral polyps themselves or the appendages of polychaetes {{and other small}} invertebrate animals. Their mouths protrude like forceps, and are equipped with fine teeth {{that allow them to}} nip off such exposed body parts of their prey. Parrotfishes eat algae growing on reef surfaces, utilizing mouths like beaks well adapted <b>to</b> <b>scrape</b> <b>off</b> their food. Other fish, like snapper, are generalized feeders with more standard jaw and mouth structures that allow them to forage {{on a wide range of}} animal prey types, including small fishes and invertebrates.|$|E
25|$|A {{further and}} most {{important}} appliance is the doctor, a thin sharp blade of steel that rests on the engraved roller and serves <b>to</b> <b>scrape</b> <b>off</b> every vestige of superfluous colour from its surface, leaving only that which rests in the engraving. On the perfect action of this doctor depends the entire success of printing, and as its sharpness and angle of inclination to the copper roller varies with the styles of work in hand it requires an expert to get it up (sharpen it) properly and considerable practical experience {{to know exactly what}} qualities it should possess in any given case. In order to prevent it from wearing irregularly it is given a to-and-fro motion so that it is constantly changing its position and is never in contact with one part of the engraving for more than of brass or a similar alloy is frequently added {{on the opposite side of}} the roller to that occupied by the steel or cleaning doctor; it is known technically as the lint doctor from its purpose of cleaning off loose filaments or lint, which the roller picks off the cloth during the printing operation. The steel or cleaning doctor is pressed against the roller by means of weighted levers, but the lint doctor is usually just allowed to rest upon it by its own weight as its function is merely to intercept the nap which becomes detached from the cloth and would, if not cleaned from the roller, mix with the colour and give rise to defective work.|$|E
500|$|It {{measures}} between [...] {{and weighs}} [...] Unlike the Bengal slow loris, the Sunda slow loris {{does not show}} sexual dimorphism by weight. The vestigial tail, hidden beneath the fur, is reduced to a stump. It has a toothcomb, six forward-facing teeth on the bottom jaw, which includes the lower incisors and the canine teeth. The structure is generally used for grooming in other strepsirhine primates, but lorises also use it <b>to</b> <b>scrape</b> <b>off</b> gum when foraging. It has a shortened second digit, and the hands have a strong grip. Like other lorises, it excretes a strong-smelling liquid from glands beneath its arms which is used in communication.|$|E

He participated in a squad commander course, and expected to participate in significant operations against the British. However, to his disappointment, he was commanded <b>to</b> <b>scrape</b> posters <b>off</b> walls and to do other simple activities.|$|R

2500|$|On August 26, Douglas {{spoke about}} racist {{bullying}} at Excalibur Gymnastics {{in an interview}} with Oprah Winfrey and how it nearly made her quit the sport.

500|$|Potential predators of {{the silky}} shark include larger sharks and killer whales (Orcinus orca). Known parasites of this shark include the isopod Gnathia trimaculata, the copepod Kroeyerina cortezensis, and the {{tapeworms}} Dasyrhynchus variouncinatus and Phyllobothrium sp. Silky sharks frequently intermingle with schools of scalloped hammerheads (Sphyrna lewini), {{and have been}} known to follow marine mammals. One account from the Red Sea describes 25silky sharks following a large pod of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops sp.), along with 25grey reef sharks (C.amblyrhynchos) and a lone silvertip shark (C.albimarginatus). Silky sharks are themselves accompanied by juvenile pilot fish (Naucrates ductor), which [...] "ride" [...] the pressure wave ahead of the shark, as well as by jacks, which snatch scraps of food and rub against the shark's skin <b>to</b> <b>scrape</b> <b>off</b> parasites.|$|E
2500|$|The Kanab ambersnail is {{typically}} found on host plants, primarily the scarlet monkeyflower and watercress, [...] but also sedges and rushes. It feeds on plant tissue, fungi, algae, and bacteria, using its radula <b>to</b> <b>scrape</b> <b>off</b> food.|$|E
60|$|Neither missed. Swinging in mid-air, {{they hung}} tenaciously, their weight {{dragging}} down the creature's head and so retarding its speed that {{before it had}} reached me it was almost stopped and devoting all its energies to attempting <b>to</b> <b>scrape</b> <b>off</b> its attackers with its forefeet.|$|E
25|$|An {{additional}} use of unibits is deburring holes left {{by other}} bits, as the sharp increase {{to the next}} step size allows the cutting edge <b>to</b> <b>scrape</b> burrs <b>off</b> the entry surface of the workpiece. However, the straight flute is poor at chip ejection, and can cause a burr to be formed on the exit side of the hole, more so than a spiral twist drill bit turning at high speed.|$|R
50|$|Randall {{was born}} in Cincinnati, Ohio on September 27, 1909. His family moved to Orlando, Florida in 1916. As a youth Randall enjoyed hunting and fishing {{and went on to}} become a {{successful}} citrus rancher. He first became interested in making knives after he purchased in 1936 a William Scagel knife that was being used <b>to</b> <b>scrape</b> paint <b>off</b> of a boat without showing any signs of wear or damage.|$|R
50|$|Violet gobies usually inhabit {{brackish}} swamps, streams, and estuaries with a muddy substrate. Violet gobies {{have very}} small eyes, {{and as such}} are primarily scavengers. Their key method of obtaining food is by scooping up mouthfuls of gravel and sorting edible material from the substrate, and then spitting out the substrate and swallowing the food particles. They also use their highly specialized teeth <b>to</b> <b>scrape</b> algae <b>off</b> of rocks.|$|R
60|$|But {{upon the}} {{shoulder}} of a hill we turned to a gate <b>to</b> <b>scrape</b> <b>off</b> the mud that made our boots unwieldy. At that moment came a threadbare place in the cloudy curtain that was sweeping across the sun, and our shadows showed themselves for an instant to comfort us. The amber patch of sunlight presently slipped from us and travelled down the meadows towards the distant blue of the hills by Waltham Abbey, touching with miraculous healing a landscape erst dead and shrouded in grey. This transitory gleam of light gladdened us mightily at the time, but it made the after-sky seem all the darker.|$|E
60|$|But Dolly swerved {{from the}} road and dashed down a grassy slope yellowed with innumerable {{mariposa}} lilies. An ancient fence at the bottom was no obstacle. She burst through {{as though it were}} filmy spider-web and disappeared in the underbrush. Lute followed unhesitatingly, putting Ban through the gap in the fence and plunging on into the thicket. She lay along his neck, closely, to escape the ripping and tearing of the trees and vines. She felt the horse drop down through leafy branches and into the cool gravel of a stream's bottom. From ahead came a splashing of water, and she caught a glimpse of Dolly, dashing up the small bank and into a clump of scrub-oaks, against the trunks of which she was trying <b>to</b> <b>scrape</b> <b>off</b> her rider.|$|E

50|$|This park {{is named}} for the {{formation}} of salt crystals in the cracks and crevices of the rocky coastline. The native Kashaya Pomo collected salt from this area for many years. They used abalone chisels <b>to</b> <b>scrape</b> the salt <b>off</b> the rocks.|$|R
50|$|On {{the bottom}} of dolsot, there forms a thin crust of {{scorched}} rice, <b>to</b> be <b>scraped</b> <b>off</b> and eaten in case of bibimbap, or made into sungnyung (infusion) in case of unseasoned rice dishes. In the former case dolsot can be brushed with sesame oil beforehand <b>to</b> facilitate <b>scraping.</b> <b>To</b> make sungnyung, the unscorched part of rice is scooped and transferred into another serving bowl right after served, and hot water or tea (usually mild grain teas such as barley tea or corn tea) is poured into the dolsot when it is still blistering. The infusion with loosened chunks of scorched rice remains warm til {{the end of the}} meal, when it is typically savoured.|$|R
60|$|It is not {{necessary}} to call him a liar to touch his vanity. Tell a plains Indian that he has failed to steal horses from the neighbouring tribe, or tell a man living in bourgeois society that he has failed to pay his bills at the neighbouring grocer's, and the results are the same. Each, plains Indian and bourgeois, is smeared with a slightly different veneer, that is all. It requires a slightly different stick <b>to</b> <b>scrape</b> it <b>off.</b> The raw animals beneath are identical.|$|R

50|$|He will {{frequently}} work on {{a painting}} for an entire day, later <b>to</b> completely <b>scrape</b> <b>off</b> all the paint that was applied, leaving only remnants of the paint that {{found its way into}} previously gouged out areas. He works like this over the course of years to build a single painting, with its layers mostly never seen by the viewer though they impart a sense of history. Throughout the process the use of language — written, painted, or scraped into the paint — is actively employed, expressing poetic, philosophical and personal messages, most of which get covered over or remain as fragmentary relics.|$|R
50|$|The {{flat back}} allows {{the user to}} place a thumb or his other hand on it to {{concentrate}} the force. Puukkos are used both {{as a tool for}} all kinds of carving, especially to work wood and to clean the catches of anglers and hunters. Some puukko designs have a slightly upwards or downwards curved point, depending on what purpose the knife has. A hunting puukko's tip is often curved downwards to make skinning and opening the animal easier and less messy. Fisherman's puukkos sometimes have a small dovetail on point <b>to</b> ease <b>scraping</b> <b>off</b> the innards of a fish.|$|R
