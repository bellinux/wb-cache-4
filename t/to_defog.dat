50|$|This {{period is}} {{especially}} important the participation of prominent lawyers and public men, Máximo Pacheco Gómez and William Elton Alamos, who alternate in the Vice President of the Board, making a great contribution to the project, and academics, Joaquín Barceló and Manuel Krauskopf, who come <b>to</b> <b>defog</b> after ownership of the rectory.|$|E
50|$|A {{full-face}} mask {{consists of}} a transparent faceplate (lenses, or window) through which the diver can see, a connection to a source of breathing gas, a means of removing any water which may get inside, some facility for the diver to block the nose to equalise the ears, a means of sealing these components to the diver's face and preventing ingress of water and a means of securing the assembly to the diver's head. Additional components may include communications equipment, lights, alternative breathing gas connections, and a means <b>to</b> <b>defog</b> the interior surface of the faceplate.|$|E
50|$|Lightweight diving {{helmets and}} bandmasks usually use a demand {{controlled}} breathing gas supply {{as the standard}} mode, as it is more economical on gas consumption - the amount of gas supplied is the amount needed for the diver's respiratory requirements. However, {{there may be a}} freeflow valve to provide gas at a constant flow at a rate determined by the valve which is operated by the diver. One of the functions of freeflow supply is <b>to</b> <b>defog</b> the faceplate. Another is for breathing gas supply in case of demand valve malfunction, and a third is to assist with clearing water from a leaking helmet, or to prevent inflow through a leaking exhaust port or neck seal.The demand valve of a lightweight helmet can also freeflow for some of the same reasons as can happen with a scuba demand valve.|$|E
