25|$|The vocative has <b>the</b> <b>same</b> form <b>as</b> <b>the</b> {{nominative}} {{except in}} the masculine singular of the 1st/2nd declension, where it has <b>the</b> <b>same</b> form <b>as</b> <b>the</b> genitive.|$|R
50|$|Eligibility for Veterans is <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> for <b>the</b> Player category, but the {{individual}} {{must have been}} retired for at least ten years. The voting period was <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> for <b>the</b> Player category.|$|R
50|$|The usual {{rules of}} {{algebraic}} addition and subtraction apply; adding a negative number is <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> subtracting <b>the</b> absolute value, and subtracting a negative number is <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> adding <b>the</b> absolute value.|$|R
5|$|A path in a {{directed}} graph {{can be described}} by a sequence of edges having the property that the ending vertex of each edge in the sequence is <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> starting vertex of the next edge in the sequence; a path forms a cycle if the starting vertex of its first edge equals the ending vertex of its last edge. A directed acyclic graph is a {{directed graph}} that has no cycles.|$|E
5|$|According to Kevin Feige, the Infinity Gauntlet {{seen at the}} end of {{the film}} is not <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> one seen in Odin's vault in Thor, {{revealing}} that two Gauntlets exist in the MCU.|$|E
5|$|Also, Newton {{describes}} QR as the {{versed sine}} of the arc with P at its centre and length twice QP. Although {{this is not}} strictly <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> QR that {{he has in the}} diagram (Fig.1), in the limit, they become equal.|$|E
50|$|The X Series DVDs are a {{compilation}} of Christian music videos promoting <b>the</b> <b>same</b> artists <b>as</b> <b>the</b> rock compilations. They began <b>the</b> <b>same</b> year <b>as</b> <b>the</b> rock compilations, in 2003.|$|R
25|$|A {{consequence}} of the continuum hypothesis is that every infinite subset of the real numbers either has <b>the</b> <b>same</b> cardinality <b>as</b> <b>the</b> integers or <b>the</b> <b>same</b> cardinality <b>as</b> <b>the</b> entire set of the reals.|$|R
50|$|The Class 06 was give <b>the</b> <b>same</b> boiler <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Class 45 {{and many}} of <b>the</b> <b>same</b> {{components}} <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Class 41. The running gear, with four coupled axles, had a wheelbase of 6,75 m.|$|R
5|$|An {{international}} {{version of}} the video was also officially released. This version is almost exactly <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> original, with the only difference being that some early shots were Spears dances {{in front of the}} multicolored background are replaced by shots of Spears with a short blonde bob wig wearing a purple dress and in front of a black background with flashing lights.|$|E
5|$|Bales' lawyer, John Henry Browne, later {{stated that}} his client was upset because a fellow soldier had lost a leg in an {{explosion}} on 9 March. It is unclear whether the bombing cited by Browne was <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> one described by the villagers.|$|E
5|$|Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) are {{assigned}} to the case. Discussing the photograph, Mulder tells Scully about Ted Serios, who was famous for making photos which showed what was in his mind. He takes pictures of his gloved hand using a camera found in Lefante's apartment, and they all appear <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> one from the pharmacy. Mulder deduces that the kidnapper has been stalking his victims.|$|E
50|$|The Entrias {{were the}} {{low-cost}} line of X-Terminals, featuring <b>the</b> <b>same</b> architecture <b>as</b> <b>the</b> 700/RX terminals, {{but in a}} plastic case <b>the</b> <b>same</b> style <b>as</b> <b>the</b> HP 9000/712 workstation. They are very small and quiet.|$|R

50|$|The next {{development}} in cache implementation in the x86 microprocessors {{began with the}} Pentium Pro, which brought the secondary cache onto <b>the</b> <b>same</b> package <b>as</b> <b>the</b> microprocessor, clocked at <b>the</b> <b>same</b> frequency <b>as</b> <b>the</b> microprocessor.|$|R
5|$|In non-competitive inhibition, {{the binding}} of the {{inhibitor}} to the enzyme reduces its activity {{but does not}} affect the binding of substrate. As a result, the extent of inhibition depends only on the concentration of the inhibitor. Vmax will decrease due to the inability for the reaction to proceed as efficiently, but Km will remain <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> actual binding of the substrate, by definition, will still function properly.|$|E
5|$|Installing such a {{large engine}} in a {{relatively}} small vehicle required some modifications, although the exterior sheet metal remained essentially <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Alpine's. Necessary chassis modifications included moving from the Burman recirculating ball steering mechanism to a more modern rack and pinion system.|$|E
5|$|John Lindley {{had named}} {{material}} collected by James Drummond Banksia cylindrostachya in 1840, but this {{proved to be}} <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> species named Banksia attenuata by Robert Brown 30 years earlier in 1810, and thus Brown's name took precedence. Within the genus Banksia, the close relationships and exact position of B. attenuata is unclear.|$|E
50|$|The Capital City Trail uses <b>the</b> <b>same</b> path <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Main Yarra Trail up to Dights Falls, {{where it}} continues, using <b>the</b> <b>same</b> path <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Merri Creek Trail, {{as part of}} its loop around the city.|$|R
50|$|This gain is <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> {{that for}} <b>the</b> input {{transistor}} acting alone. Thus, even sacrificing gain, the cascode produces <b>the</b> <b>same</b> gain <b>as</b> <b>the</b> single-transistor transconductance amplifier, but with wider bandwidth.|$|R
50|$|Losses are {{recognized}} in the year when they are discovered, <b>the</b> <b>same</b> way <b>as</b> for <b>the</b> completed contract method. The balance sheet presentation is <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> in <b>the</b> completed contract method.|$|R
5|$|Maurer Söhne, a German {{roller coaster}} and steel manufacturer, has {{developed}} {{their own version of}} the Floorless Coaster called the X-Car Floorless. The car is <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> original X-Car with the only difference being that there is no floor during the ride. As of 2012, no X-Car Floorless roller coasters have been manufactured.|$|E
5|$|Multiple X-ray {{sources have}} since been {{detected}} in the Andromeda Galaxy, using observations from the European Space Agency's (ESA) XMM-Newton orbiting observatory. Robin Barnard et al. hypothesized that these are candidate black holes or neutron stars, which are heating the incoming gas to millions of kelvins and emitting X-rays. The spectrum of the neutron stars is <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> hypothesized black holes but can be distinguished by their masses.|$|E
5|$|Neon {{comprises}} 1 part in 55,000 in the Earth's atmosphere, or 18.2 ppm {{by volume}} (this is about <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> molecule or mole fraction), or 1 part in 79,000 of air by mass. It comprises a smaller fraction in the crust. It is industrially produced by cryogenic fractional distillation of liquefied air.|$|E

50|$|PavCo, {{which owns}} and {{operates}} BC Place, is governed primarily by the British Columbia Enterprise Corporation Act, which names it an Agent of the government, binds it by <b>the</b> <b>same</b> laws <b>as</b> <b>the</b> government, and gives it <b>the</b> <b>same</b> immunities <b>as</b> <b>the</b> government.|$|R
50|$|The novel for Demon Under Glass, {{written by}} Deborah Warner (as D. L. Warner), was {{published}} <b>the</b> <b>same</b> year <b>as</b> <b>the</b> film's release.

5|$|On May 12, Werth stole four bases, {{including}} home plate, tying a Phillies {{record and}} {{leading to a}} 5–3 win over the Los Angeles Dodgers; however, the series result was <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> previous one, as the Phillies dropped two games in the set to Los Angeles.|$|E

50|$|For the 5,6-dimethylcyclohexa-1,3-diene, only a disrotatory mode {{would result}} in p-orbitals having <b>the</b> <b>same</b> {{symmetry}} <b>as</b> <b>the</b> HOMO of hexatriene.

50|$|The Premio Ribot {{was usually}} {{held on the}} first or second Sunday in November and staged on <b>the</b> <b>same</b> day <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Premio Roma. Since 2015 it has been held a week earlier than usual, at <b>the</b> <b>same</b> meeting <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Premio Lydia Tesio.|$|R
