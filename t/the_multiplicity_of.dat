They would decay through isotopes of ununennium that could be produced by cross-bombardments in the 248Cm+51V or 249Bk+50Ti reactions, which will be tried at RIKEN and JINR respectively in 2019–2020, down through known isotopes of tennessine and moscovium synthesised in the 249Bk+48Ca and 243Am+48Ca reactions. <b>The</b> <b>multiplicity</b> <b>of</b> excited states populated by the alpha decay of odd nuclei may however preclude clear cross-bombardment cases, as was seen in the purported yet likely nonexistent link between nuclides assigned to 293Ts and 289Mc.

25|$|To {{compute the}} {{intersection}} of the curve defined by the polynomial p with the line of equation ax+by+c = 0, one solves the equation of the line for x (or for y if a = 0). Substituting the result in p, one gets a univariate equation q(y) = 0 (or q(x) = 0, if the equation of the line has been solved in y), each of whose roots is one coordinate of an intersection point. The other coordinate is deduced from the equation of the line. <b>The</b> <b>multiplicity</b> <b>of</b> an intersection point is <b>the</b> <b>multiplicity</b> <b>of</b> the corresponding root.
