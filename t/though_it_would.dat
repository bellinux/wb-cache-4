5|$|This series {{also saw}} leprechaun Mr Onion return, however Shamrock, {{who had been}} his replacement, {{remained}} meaning the show now had three leprechaun puppets. More often than not <b>though,</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be Mr Sage with either Mr Onion or Shamrock as his sidekick rather than all three together.|$|E
5|$|A dry bell {{may also}} be used for bounce dives to great depths, and then used as the {{decompression}} chamber during the ascent and later on board the support vessel. In this case it is not always necessary to transfer into a deck chamber, as the bell is quite capable of performing this function, <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be relatively cramped, as a bell is usually as small as conveniently possible to minimize weight for deployment.|$|E
5|$|A {{significant}} clue to {{its nature}} {{is provided by}} {{an account of the}} Stone's recovery in 951 AD after it had been stolen 21 years earlier; according to a chronicler, the Stone was identified by its ability to float in water. If this account is accurate, it would rule out the Black Stone being an agate, a basalt lava or a stony meteorite, <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be compatible with it being glass or pumice.|$|E
50|$|Also in 2005, {{the company}} entered an {{agreement}} with the Northern Cheyenne Nation to develop a $10 to 15 million casino in Lame Deer, Montana. By 2010, financing difficulties forced Full House to write off the $728,000 <b>it</b> had spent, <b>though</b> <b>it</b> said <b>it</b> <b>would</b> continue to pursue the project.|$|R

5|$|PNC Park had {{an average}} {{attendance}} of 30,742people per game throughout its inaugural season, <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> drop approximately 27% the following season to 22,594spectators per game. Throughout the 2001 season, businesses in downtown and on the Northside of Pittsburgh showed a 20–25% increase in business on Pirate game days.|$|E
5|$|A {{couple of}} months into the season, Johnson {{suffered}} a prolapsed disc in his back; the condition was initially treated with injections, but surgery was eventually required as a lasting solution, <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> keep him out for an extended period. However, his recovery took longer than expected {{and it was not}} until the end of the season that Johnson was able to start running again, delaying any comeback until at least the start of the 2006–07 season. That comeback failed to materialise, and in September 2006, Johnson retired from professional football on the advice of his doctors, with his sights now set on coaching.|$|E
5|$|After Gasketball 2012 release, Boxleiter and Wohlwend {{planned a}} celebratory road {{trip to a}} game jam in Victoria, British Columbia. The game did not fare as expected, so Boxleiter used the two-day jam to create the core mirror {{reflection}} mechanics of what would become TouchTone, <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> take two years of sporadic work to finalize {{the remainder of the}} game. In TouchTone, the player monitors phone calls as part of a government surveillance program to find public threats. The story is told through a series of reflection puzzles wherein the player swipes the screen to reflect a beam around a room to its intended destination.|$|E
60|$|Misjudged, misused, even <b>though</b> friendless, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> {{continue}} to serve the people. So noble, indeed, was the picture which Mr. Billings' eloquence raised up that his voice shook with emotion as he finished.|$|R
5000|$|Billboard {{magazine}} called the single a [...] "weak song," [...] <b>though</b> predicted <b>it</b> <b>would</b> do well commercially nonetheless. [...] The magazine criticized the immaturity of the song's lyrics {{and said the}} production was subpar.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{had better}} be careful," [...] the Princess said, [...] "or we may take you at your word. I warn you, <b>though,</b> that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be a regular invasion. Major Forrest and Lord Ronald are talking about coming with us." ...|$|R
5|$|Interstate 70 was {{dedicated}} on December 5, 1970, at the Ghost Rocks view area inside the swell, even <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> take another 20years to fully complete the freeway. At the ceremony the mayors of cities recently made neighbors, including Grand Junction, Colorado, introduced themselves. Then Governor Calvin L. Rampton noted that I-70 {{was the longest}} road the U.S. had built over a completely new route since the Alaska Highway, during World War II. It was also noted this was the longest piece of the Interstate Highway System to open at a given time.|$|E
5|$|On November 12, 2008, the RCMP {{ruled out}} laying {{criminal}} charges {{in relation to}} the accident. It stated that the finding had been reviewed by a Crown prosecutor and that no wrongdoing was found. The families of two of the deceased expressed disapproval of the decision and indicated that they may bring a lawsuit against several of the involved parties, though others have publicly stated that they accepted the decision. The chief coroner of the province stated that a provincial inquest was possible, <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> take some time to come to any decision on the matter. No decision on whether or not to have an inquest was made for over a month.|$|E
5|$|Plans to {{construct}} a road from Brawley to Glamis date from 1953; the road would provide improved access to two newer state parks. The ceding of the Chocolate Mountains to the U.S. Navy had closed a north–south road traversing Imperial County, and the government needed to restore a corridor for local residents to use, as the road was closed during the day for five days a week. However, in August, the Riverside Chamber of Commerce opposed the construction, even <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> replace the Niland–Blythe road. The chamber reversed its stance in December, as the road would mostly be constructed in Imperial County.|$|E
6000|$|... "Lady," [...] said Leo, [...] "you saved me, {{and again}} I thank you, <b>though</b> perhaps <b>it</b> <b>would</b> {{have been better}} if you had let me drown. But, forgive me the question, if all this tale be true, why did you marry another man?" ...|$|R
50|$|After much deliberation, it {{was decided}} that the 1994 CMWC would still take place in London, <b>though</b> now <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be {{organized}} solely by cycle messengers. Against all odds, the event took place and attracted around 500 participants. Once again, the CMWC was deemed a success.|$|R
5000|$|The {{movie was}} {{also known as}} The Starlets, Hollywood Starlets, The Actresses and Hello, Hollywood. [...] Dante says at one stage Corman wanted to call it Hollywood Hookers but the {{directors}} did not like that [...] "even <b>though</b> <b>it</b> probably <b>would</b> have made more money if it was called Hollywood Hookers".|$|R
5|$|The {{comedy series}} focuses on Leslie Knope (Amy Poehler), the deputy {{director}} of the parks and recreation department of the fictional town of Pawnee, Indiana. The season consisted of six 22-minute episodes, all of which aired at 8:30p.m. on Thursdays. Daniels and Schur conceived the show when NBC officials asked Daniels to produce a spin-off of his comedy series The Office, on which Schur was a writer. During development, the creators decided the new show would be a stand-alone series, <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> share the mockumentary style of The Office. Like that show, Parks and Recreation encouraged improvisation among its cast members.|$|E
5|$|The second route {{would have}} {{originated}} in Fort Hamilton {{at the south}} end of the line. Similar to the 1890 proposal, it would have followed the routing of the current Verrazano-Narrows Bridge (constructed from 1959 to its opening in 1964). The Fort Hamilton proposal was the shortest route of the two, <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> require tunneling through deeper waters. As part of the proposal, it was suggested that the Fourth Avenue Line be extended past its original terminal at 86th Street in Bay Ridge to a temporary ferry terminal at 95th Street (now the 95th Street Station).|$|E
5|$|At the time, {{there were}} no public art {{galleries}} in England with permanent collections. In 1816, {{in the face of}} his continued lack of success, Etty decided to spend a year in Italy to study the artworks held in the great Italian collections. He had made a brief visit to France in early 1815, but other than this had never been abroad. The 28-year-old Etty had fallen in love, and fretted about the difficulties a potential marriage would cause, and whether it would be right to travel to further his career even <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> mean taking his new wife to a foreign country. In the event, the woman rejected him, and he set out for the Continent in early September 1816.|$|E
5000|$|More informally, temptation {{may be used}} to mean [...] "the {{state of}} being {{attracted}} and enticed" [...] without anything to do with moral, ethical, or ideological valuation; for example, one may say that a piece of food looks [...] "tempting" [...] even <b>though</b> eating <b>it</b> <b>would</b> result in no negative consequences.|$|R

5000|$|Trinitrotriazine has {{a perfect}} oxygen balance, {{potentially}} {{making it a}} very powerful explosive, <b>though</b> calculations predict <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be fairly unstable and inferior to the related compound 3,6-dinitro-1,2,4,5-tetrazine.|$|R
5|$|Finally, Justinian {{dispatched}} {{a force of}} approximately 35,000 men (2,000 men were detached and sent to invade southern Visigothic Hispania) {{under the command of}} Narses. The army reached Ravenna in June 552, and defeated the Ostrogoths decisively within a month at the battle of Busta Gallorum in the Apennines, where Totila was slain. After a second battle at Mons Lactarius in October that year, the resistance of the Ostrogoths was finally broken. In 554, a large-scale Frankish invasion was defeated at Casilinum, and Italy was secured for the Empire, <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> take Narses several years to reduce the remaining Gothic strongholds. At the end of the war, Italy was garrisoned with an army of 16,000 men. The recovery of Italy cost the empire about 300,000 pounds of gold.|$|E
5|$|He {{then set}} about calculating the entire orbit of Mars, using the {{geometrical}} rate law and assuming an egg-shaped ovoid orbit. After approximately 40 failed attempts, in early 1605 he at last hit upon {{the idea of}} an ellipse, which he had previously assumed to be too simple a solution for earlier astronomers to have overlooked. Finding that an elliptical orbit fit the Mars data, he immediately concluded that all planets move in ellipses, with the sun at one focus—Kepler's first law of planetary motion. Because he employed no calculating assistants, however, he did not extend the mathematical analysis beyond Mars. By the end of the year, he completed the manuscript for Astronomia nova, <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> not be published until 1609 due to legal disputes over the use of Tycho's observations, the property of his heirs.|$|E
5|$|In September 1992, Joe Pytka {{announced}} that Warner Bros. held {{the option to}} create a live action film adaptation of the 1960s Japanese anime and manga series Speed Racer, in development at Silver Pictures. In October 1994, singer Henry Rollins was offered the role of Racer X. In June 1995, Johnny Depp was cast into the lead role for Speed Racer, with production slated to begin the coming October, with filming {{to take place in}} California and Arizona. The following August, Depp requested time off to the studio for personal business, delaying production. However, due to an overly high budget, the same August, director Julien Temple left the project. Depp, without a director, also departed from the project. The studio considered director Gus Van Sant as a replacement for Temple, <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> not grant writing privileges to Van Sant. In December 1997, the studio briefly hired Alfonso Cuarón as director. In the various incarnations of the project, screenwriters Marc Levin, Jennifer Flackett, J. J. Abrams, and Patrick Read Johnson had been hired to write scripts.|$|E

5000|$|On 1 May 2017, McKeever was {{selected}} again to be Labour's prospective parliamentary candidate for Northampton South. The pollster YouGov claimed in their aggregated statistical election model that the seat could be won {{by either the}} Conservative or Labour parties, <b>though</b> suggested <b>it</b> <b>would</b> likely return a Conservative MP. [...] McKeever lost to the Conservative Andrew Lewer.|$|R
5|$|In a hung {{parliament}} {{where no}} party or coalition holds a majority, the monarch has an increased degree of latitude {{in choosing the}} individual likely to command the most support, <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> usually be {{the leader of the}} largest party. Since 1945, there have only been three hung parliaments. The first followed the February 1974 general election when Harold Wilson was appointed Prime Minister after Edward Heath resigned following his failure to form a coalition. Although Wilson's Labour Party did not have a majority, they were the largest party. The second followed the May 2010 general election, in which the Conservatives (the largest party) and Liberal Democrats (the third largest party) agreed to form the first coalition government since World War II. The third occurred shortly thereafter, in June 2017, when the Conservative Party lost its majority in a snap election, though the party remained in power as a minority government.|$|E
5|$|The Fifth Doctor's {{first story}} was {{originally}} intended to be the four-part Project Zeta Sigma, written by John Flanagan & Andrew McCulloch. It {{was not intended to}} follow on directly from the events of Logopolis; instead, the Doctor and his companions would have already left Earth. The story was to concern nuclear disarmament. Commissioned as Project '4G on 7 October 1980, the script proved unworkable, and producer John Nathan-Turner dropped the story on 19 February 1981. He then commissioned recently departed script editor Christopher H. Bidmead to write a replacement which became Castrovalva. This last minute change disrupted the shooting schedule, meaning that Castrovalva would be the fourth serial of the series filmed, <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be the first transmitted.|$|E
5|$|The season's eighteenth {{tropical}} depression formed over the Turks and Caicos Islands on September 18. Later that day, {{it became the}} seventeenth tropical storm of the season. Rita slowly intensified to become a hurricane on September 20. It was at Category1 and later Category2 intensity as it moved south of the Florida Keys. Rapid intensification ensued as Rita moved into the Gulf of Mexico on September 20, and Rita became a Category5 hurricane on September 21, becoming {{at the time the}} third-most intense hurricane ever recorded in the Atlantic Basin with a minimum central pressure of 895mbar, <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> later fall to fourth following Hurricane Wilma. However, as the storm moved slowly across the Gulf of Mexico it gradually weakened until landfall. Rita made landfall as a strong Category3 hurricane in Cameron Parish, Louisiana near the Texas/Louisiana border on September 24, 2005.|$|E
5000|$|Simon Clark, {{author of}} The Night of the Triffids stated on interview: [...] "The film version is enjoyable, luring the {{effective}} looking Triffids away with music from an ice-cream van {{and some other}} good action scenes. The Triffids' death-by-seawater climax is weak and contrived <b>though.</b> But <b>it</b> <b>would</b> still rank in my all-time top 100 films." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{arrangement}} was, {{that on the}} morrow Jess was to {{be driven}} in the Cape cart to Martinus-Wesselstroom, more commonly called Wakkerstroom, there to catch the post-cart, which was timed to leave the town at mid-day, <b>though</b> when <b>it</b> <b>would</b> leave was quite another matter. Post-carts are not particular to {{a day or so}} in the Transvaal.|$|R
60|$|But {{the stream}} of immigration, {{continuous}} <b>though</b> <b>it</b> has been, <b>would</b> not by itself have sufficed {{to bring up the}} native population to its present enormous total, without the assistance of the polygamous customs of the immigrants.|$|R
