40|$|Shot {{noise is}} a {{powerful}} tool to probe correlations and microscopic <b>transport</b> <b>details</b> that conductance measurements alone cannot reveal. Even in atomic-scale Au devices that are well described by Landauer-Büttiker physics, complications remain such as local heating and electron-phonon interactions. We report systematic rf measurements of shot noise in individual atomic-scale gold break junctions at multiple temperatures, with most bias voltages well above {{the energy of the}} Au optical phonon mode. Motivated by the previous experimental evidence that electron-phonon interactions can modify Fano factors and result in kinked features in bias dependence of shot noise, we find that the temperature dependence of shot noise from 4. 2 K to 100 K is minimal. Enhanced Fano factors near 0. 5 G_ 0 and features beyond simply linear bias dependence of shot noise near the 1 G_ 0 plateau are observed. Both are believed to have non-interacting origins and the latter likely results from slightly bias-dependent transmittance of the dominant quantum channel. Comment: 15 pages, 3 figure...|$|E

40|$|The {{transport}} {{properties of}} semiconductors {{are key to}} the performance of many solid-state devices (transistors, data storage, thermoelectric cooling and power generation devices, etc). An understanding of the <b>transport</b> <b>details</b> can lead to material designs with better performances. In recent years simulation tools based on first-principles calculations have been greatly improved, being able to obtain the fundamental ground-state properties of materials (such as band structure and phonon dispersion) accurately. Accordingly, methods have been developed to calculate the transport properties based on an ab initio approach. In this review we focus on the thermal, electrical, and thermoelectric transport properties of semiconductors, which represent the basic transport characteristics of the two degrees of freedom in solids—electronic and lattice degrees of freedom. Starting from the coupled electron-phonon Boltzmann transport equations, we illustrate different scattering mechanisms that change the transport features and review the first-principles approaches that solve the transport equations. We then present the first-principles results on the thermal and electrical transport properties of semiconductors. The discussions are grouped based on different scattering mechanisms including phonon-phonon scattering, phonon scattering by equilibrium electrons, carrier scattering by equilibrium phonons, carrier scattering by polar optical phonons, scatterings due to impurities, alloying and doping, and the phonon drag effect. We show how the first-principles methods allow one to investigate transport properties with unprecedented detail and also offer new insights into the electron and phonon transport.
