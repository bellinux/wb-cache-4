5|$|According to biographer M.D. Gopalakrishnan, Periyar and his {{movement}} achieved a better status {{for women in}} Tamil society. Periyar held that in matters of education and employment <b>there</b> <b>should</b> be no difference between men and women. Gopalakrishnan states that Periyar's influence in the State departments and even the Center {{made it possible for}} women to join police departments and the army. Periyar also spoke out against child marriage.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1870, chemists thought that <b>there</b> <b>should</b> be an alkali metal beyond caesium, with an atomic number of 87. It was then {{referred}} to by the provisional name eka-caesium. Research teams attempted to locate and isolate this missing element, and at least four false claims were made that the element had been found before an authentic discovery was made.|$|E
5|$|Fleming {{subsequently}} {{requested that}} <b>there</b> <b>should</b> be no reprints or paperback {{version of the}} book, and for the British market no paperback version appeared until after Fleming's death. Because of the heightened sexual writing in the novel, it was banned {{in a number of}} countries. In the US the story was also published in Stag magazine, with the title changed to Motel Nymph.|$|E

5|$|In addition, {{to ensure}} that the number of SMCs kept pace with the {{increase}} in voters and hence the number of MPs, the EBRC's terms of reference would state that <b>there</b> <b>should</b> be at least 12 SMCs. The rationale given for these changes was that the GRC scheme would work better and the link between voters and their MPs would be strengthened. In the 2011 general election, SMCs returned to Parliament 12 MPs and 15 GRCs a total of 75 MPs.|$|E
5|$|Kohlberg's {{scale is}} about how people justify {{behaviors}} and his stages are not a method of ranking how moral someone's behavior is. <b>There</b> <b>should,</b> however, be a correlation between how someone scores on the scale and how they behave, and the general hypothesis is that moral behaviour is more responsible, consistent and predictable from people at higher levels.|$|E

5|$|Management {{of human}} {{consumption}} of resources is an indirect approach based largely on information gained from economics. Herman Daly has suggested three broad criteria for ecological sustainability: renewable resources should provide a sustainable yield (the rate of harvest should not exceed the rate of regeneration); for non-renewable resources <b>there</b> <b>should</b> be equivalent development of renewable substitutes; waste generation should not exceed the assimilative capacity of the environment.|$|E
5|$|Responses are {{polyclonal}} {{in nature}} as each clone somewhat specializes in producing antibodies against a given epitope, and because, each antigen contains multiple epitopes, {{each of which}} in turn can be recognized {{by more than one}} clone of B cells. To be able to react to innumerable antigens, as well as multiple constituent epitopes, the immune system requires the ability to recognize a very great number of epitopes in all, i.e., <b>there</b> <b>should</b> be a great diversity of B cell clones.|$|E
5|$|The Irenaean theodicy is a {{response}} to the evidential problem of evil which raises the problem that, if an omnipotent and omnibenevolent (all-powerful and perfectly loving) God exists, <b>there</b> <b>should</b> be no evil in the world. Evidence of evil in the world would make the existence of God improbable. The theodicy attempts to demonstrate that the existence of God remains probable, despite the occurrence of evil.|$|E

5|$|The {{widespread}} {{consumption of}} alcohol was recognized as a problem by Dr. Eli Todd in 1812. In a conversation with Edward Hooker on March 30, 1812, he stated {{that there was no}} single solution to alcoholism. “He advised a 3-pronged attack that was as follows: <b>there</b> <b>should</b> be an association of respectable men who would make it unfashionable to take ardent spirits; work houses of ‘idle, drinking persons’ after their third conviction for drunkenness; and heavy taxes on imported and domestic liquor”.|$|E

5|$|A {{few months}} later, Olbers was again {{attempting}} to locate Ceres {{when he noticed}} another moving object in the vicinity. This was the asteroid Pallas, coincidentally passing near Ceres at the time. The discovery of this object created interest in the astronomy community. Before this point it had been speculated by astronomers that <b>there</b> <b>should</b> be a planet in the gap between Mars and Jupiter. Now, unexpectedly, a second such body had been found. When Pallas was discovered, some estimates of its size were as high as 3,380km in diameter. Even as recently as 1979, Pallas {{was estimated to be}} 673km in diameter, 26% greater than the currently accepted value.|$|E
5|$|Another {{political}} issue surrounding the double burden is {{what sort of}} policies directly or indirectly affect those who do domestic work. Some policies that companies have, such as a lower rate for part-time workers or firing workers when they get pregnant {{can be seen as}} disempowering women. Debate as to whether this is gender segregation continues. On one side, only women get pregnant and there is a disproportionate number of women who do part-time work instead of full-time, suggesting that <b>there</b> <b>should</b> be allowances made for women. However, there is also the argument that similar to men who fail to meet the standards of the company and cannot comply with their contract, women who cannot perform work at the performance expected of them should be given the proportionate number of benefits and given no exceptions over men.|$|E

5|$|At {{present in}} the United States there are three {{different}} levels of scrutiny. Firstly, if a law categorizes {{on the basis of}} race or national origin (which are regarded as suspect classifications), or infringes a fundamental right, strict scrutiny is applied. Accordingly, the law is unconstitutional unless it is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest. In addition, <b>there</b> <b>should</b> not be a less restrictive alternative available to achieve that compelling interest. Secondly, if the law categorizes on the basis of gender, legitimacy or similar quasi-suspect classifications, intermediate scrutiny is applied – the law is unconstitutional unless it is substantially related to an important government interest. Finally, the traditional rational basis review is applied if the law categorizes on some other, non-suspect, basis. In this case, the law is constitutional so long as it is reasonably related to a legitimate government interest.|$|E
5|$|During Blamey's absence in Greece, AIF units {{had become}} widely scattered, with forces being {{deployed}} to Cyprus, and the 9th Division and the 18th Infantry Brigade coming under siege in Tobruk. Blamey {{would spend the}} rest of the year attempting to reassemble his forces. This led to a clash with Auchinleck over the relief of Tobruk, where Blamey accepted Burston's advice that the Australian troops <b>there</b> <b>should</b> be relieved on medical grounds. Menzies, and later his successor, John Curtin, backed Blamey, and Auchinleck and Churchill were forced to give way resulting in the relief of most of the Australian troops by the British 70th Division. For his campaigns in the Middle East, Blamey was created a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath on 1 January 1942. He was Mentioned in Despatches for the eighth time, and was awarded the Greek War Cross, First Class.|$|E
5|$|Examining the oxygen-isotope ratio {{from the}} bones from {{different}} parts of an extinct animal's body should indicate which thermoregulation mode an animal used during its lifetime. An endothermic (warm-blooded) animal should maintain a very similar body temperature throughout its entire body (which is called homeothermy) and therefore <b>there</b> <b>should</b> be little variation in the oxygen-isotope ratio when measured in different bones. Alternatively, the oxygen-isotope ratio differs considerably when measured throughout the body of an organism with an ectothermic (cold-blooded) physiology. Oxygen-isotope ratios calculated for Hypacrosaurus suggesting that the ratios varied little, indicating that Hypacrosaurus was a homeotherm, and likely was endothermic. This is in contrast to the Ruben et al. (1996) finding that Hypacrosaurus was not warm-blooded, which was based on the absence of nasal turbinates (see Crest functions subsection, above).|$|E
