I propose some foundations for thinking about queer qualitative methods that employs queer theory in relation to a self - reflexive creative perspective towards ethics, research and representation. Moreover, I critically analyze the HBO trans documentary, Middle Sexes: Redefining He and She (Antony Thomas 2005), in order to move beyond complacent documentaries that employ interviews as a way of categorizing and containing gender diversity. I work towards future methodological promises for the exploration of queer and trans subjects.

Theory suggests that corporate sustainability relies on sustainable relationships between the firm and its multiple stakeholders. This study is qualitative and evidence is derived from integrative analysis of literature, secondary data and case study analysis. The findings from the interviews analysis supplement the framework developed as {{the results of the}} literature review. The results obtained throughout the thesis research imply that stakeholder engagement helps develop more <b>thorough</b> <b>understandings</b> of issues and alternative perspectives, which in turn facilitates the decision-making processes improvement. The improvement is also achieved through ethical analysis, by weighing the impact of firm’s decisions on all relevant groups. Therefore, clear communication and exchange of information also improve the acceptance of sustainability initiatives amongst stakeholders both in terms of building trust and managing expectations. As practical implications, this thesis presents organizational practices that can be employed by companies to support effective engagement with stakeholders. The described practices could enhance processes such as partnership and co-creation resulting in greater sustainable development...|$|R

40|$|With {{roots in}} behaviorist philosophy, {{performance}} pay for teachers is often linked to accountability regimes in school reform. The theory girding such programs suggests that pay {{as an economic}} incentive can help cause teachers to increase student outcomes as measured by standardized test scores. What is little noticed by many educationists, but particularly by policy makers, is how programmatic effects affect the ontology of educational environment. There {{are several ways to}} approach the viability of such programs. In this study of three pay-for-performance programs, two in the U. S. and one in the UK, we provide theoretic insights in light of three variables: (i) their psychological framework, (ii) teacher efficacy and the teacher-student relationship, and (iii) how the psychological impact of such programs coincides with larger institutional forces. Using theory to examine pay-for-performance is necessary in order to get beneath mere data and secure more <b>thorough</b> <b>understandings</b> of the phenomenological impacts of performance pay. And better understanding of these foundational features is necessary, even critical, in order to fully appreciate the economic and informational trade-offs in implementation. Our study suggests that as a small-scale reform measure and when it specifically accounts for complexities of educational production, performance pay may be a viable reform option. education, policy...|$|R

40|$|ReviewThis is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from Elsevier via the DOI in this record. This paper summarises the recent research on the chromogenic performance of a unique class of nanomaterials, tungsten oxide (WOx), and highlights their potential applications in energy-related areas. WOx exhibits a wealthy range of interesting chromogenic characteristics and has recently shown great potentials towards practical energy-related applications. Recent developments in nano-sized WOx synthesis have made these potentials even more appealing to engineers, binging in immense challenges in research and equally tremendous opportunities for applications. The potential smart window/glazing applications for energy saving, the thermochromic coating attractions in solar-thermal conversion, and the highly efficient gas-chromic applications as effective hydrogen sensors during energy generation and transportation, all point to current and future energy-related research areas and demand further efforts to achieve <b>thorough</b> <b>understandings</b> prior to materialisation. Pursuing for understandings of the relationship loop of the chemical composition-physical structure-coloration behaviour of these WOx-based nanomaterials will be first summarised. The mechanisms for different types of chromism of these materials will then be presented, and factors affecting coloration efficiencies will be analysed. The synthesis, processing and post-treatment techniques associated with their chromogenic performance will be discussed. The current technical challenges and future potentials of this unique WOx in applications will be discussed throughout the text...|$|R
