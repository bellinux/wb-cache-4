5|$|After {{the path}} was {{finalized}} came the augers and drillers for the holes {{that served as}} foundations for the Vertical Support Members that held up the pipe. These holes were drilled and filled {{with a mix of}} water, gravel and dirt before a VSM was dropped into each hole. Because of the frozen ground, the gravel and dirt froze as hard as concrete, sealing the VSMs in place. The VSMs were laid in parallel, <b>two</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time,</b> and each had a semicircular rest for the pipeline segments. These were carried in 40-foot or 80-foot segments by crane or sideboom to the appropriate location, lowered into place, then welded together. The welds were then inspected via X-ray by quality control engineers who followed the welders.|$|E
5|$|Bottom-dwelling {{and perhaps}} {{relatively}} active in nature, the Izak catshark feeds mainly on a {{diverse array of}} bony fishes, crustaceans, and cephalopods. A significant portion of its diet may be scavenged from offal discarded by fisheries. This species is oviparous, with females producing encapsulated eggs <b>two</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> year-round. The Izak catshark is regularly caught incidentally by a South African bottom trawl commercial fishery, but is discarded rather than utilized. Despite the fishing pressure, its population has been increasing and thus the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|Mainly nocturnal in habits, after dusk {{the leopard}} {{catshark}} hunts for small, benthic bony fishes and invertebrates in shallow water. In daytime, it generally rests inside caves and crevices, sometimes in groups. This species {{has been documented}} ambushing spawning chokka squid (Loligo vulgaris reynaudi) within their spawning grounds. Reproduction is oviparous and proceeds year-round. Females produce rectangular, light-colored egg capsules <b>two</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time,</b> attaching them to structures on the sea floor. Small and harmless, the leopard catshark adapts well to captivity and is often exhibited in public aquariums. It is caught by commercial and recreational fishers as bycatch, and often killed as a pest. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species as Data Deficient; its numbers {{do not seem to}} be declining, but heavy human activity occurs within its native waters. The possibly fragmented nature of its distribution also merits caution for each local population.|$|E

5|$|The diet of the cloudy {{catshark}} {{consists of}} molluscs, crustaceans, and bony fishes. It is oviparous, with females laying encapsulated eggs <b>two</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> in nursery areas. The claspers {{of the male}} bear numerous hooks that likely serve to facilitate copulation. This harmless shark can be readily maintained in captivity and {{is used as a}} model organism for biological research. It is caught incidentally, and generally discarded, by commercial fisheries. These activities do not appear to have negatively affected its population, leading it to be listed under Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).|$|E
5|$|The pyjama shark is {{primarily}} nocturnal, {{spending most of}} the day lying motionless and hidden in a cave or crevice or among vegetation. It often forms groups, particularly during summer. This species is an opportunistic predator that feeds {{on a wide variety of}} fishes and invertebrates; it favors cephalopods and frequents the spawning grounds of the chokka squid (Loligo reynaudi). When threatened, it curls into a circle with its tail covering its head. Reproduction is oviparous, with females laying rectangular, dark brown egg cases <b>two</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> year-round. This small and harmless shark adapts well to captivity and is commonly displayed in public aquariums. It is often caught as a bycatch of commercial and recreational fisheries. Many are killed by fishers who regard them as pests. Although there are no data suggesting its numbers have declined, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the pyjama shark as Near Threatened because of expanding small shark fishery activities within its limited range.|$|E
5|$|Voracious and {{opportunistic}} in feeding habits, the blotchy swellshark {{is known}} to consume numerous types of fishes and invertebrates, including an unusually high diversity of cartilaginous fishes. Like other Cephaloscyllium species, {{it is capable of}} rapidly inflating its body as a defense against predators. This species is oviparous, with females laying encapsulated eggs <b>two</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time.</b> There is no well-defined breeding season and reproduction occurs year-round. The eggs hatch after approximately one year. The blotchy swellshark is harmless and fares well in captivity. It is caught as bycatch in commercial bottom trawls, though its population {{does not seem to have}} suffered from fishing activity. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) presently lacks sufficient information to assess its conservation status.|$|E

It was also worn by the twelve most important officials and the imperial bodyguard, and hence by Archangels in icons, who were seen as divine bodyguards. In fact it was only normally worn a few times a year, such as on Easter Sunday, but it was very commonly used for depictions in art.|$|E
25|$|Though the {{laboratory}} did not employ any revolutionary measurement techniques, it was unique {{because of the}} simple logistics of constructing such a demonstration within a limited space and have it quickly and efficiently be able to gather all the necessary data. The laboratory itself was a see-through (lattice-walled) fenced off gallery measuring 36 feet long by 6 feet long. To collect data efficiently, Galton {{had to make the}} process as simple as possible for people to understand. As a result, subjects were taken through {{the laboratory}} in pairs so that explanations could be given to <b>two</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time,</b> also in the hope that one of the two would confidently take the initiative to go through all the tests first, encouraging the other.

25|$|Since {{the mine}} was so productive, it was {{necessary}} for the company to build its own facilities at Morwellham Quay to handle the ore. Between 1856 and 1858, the mining company built its own Great Dock and quay at Morwellham. The company had built its railway with an incline for its last half-mile to the quay at Morwellham. Cars were lowered <b>two</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> onto the incline where the power to move them on came from a steam engine. They passed through a tunnel and onto viaducts built on the quay. After the mine's closure, the track was removed and the tunnel infilled; this was partially restored in 2007. The engine house and associated structures survive, as does the incline. The Devon Great Consols dock was restored {{in the latter part of}} the 20th century with the bollards and portions of a crane from the quay surviving. Most of the structures have scheduled monument status.|$|E
25|$|In 2014, {{the navy}} {{reported}} the recurrence of hull cracking around the engine spaces, {{which has been}} attributed to a combination of design issues related to the aluminium hull, and the high tempo of operations. By 2015, several patrol boats were confined to port because of structural, mechanical, and corrosion issues. In response, the Department of Defence threatened to cancel DMS' maintenance contract based on the company's poor performance in maintaining the Armidales (but did not go ahead due to the political repercussions from potentially losing local jobs). Defence and Serco (the parent company of DMS) later agreed to end the contract in 2017, with the Australian government to tender for a new in-service support contract during 2016. The patrol boat fleet began a mid-life refit program in October 2015, in order to extend hull life until a replacement class of larger vessels enters service from 2022. Patrol boats are being refitted <b>two</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> in Singapore, with the RAN chartering the s Cape Byron and Cape Nelson from mid-2015 until the end of 2016 to supplement naval patrol boat availability. During work on the first two patrol boats, the estimated cost of work-per-vessel doubled to A$7 million.|$|E
500|$|Nursehounds have nocturnal {{habits and}} {{generally}} hide inside small holes during the day, often associating {{with other members}} of its species. A benthic predator, it feeds on a range of bony fishes, smaller sharks, crustaceans, and cephalopods. Like other catsharks, the nursehound is oviparous in reproduction. Females deposit large, thick-walled egg cases, <b>two</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time,</b> from March to October, securing them to bunches of seaweed. The eggs take 712 months to hatch. Nursehounds are marketed as food in several European countries under various names, including [...] "flake", [...] "catfish", [...] "rock eel", and [...] "rock salmon". It was once also valued for its rough skin (called [...] "rubskin"), which was used as an abrasive. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the nursehound as Near Threatened, as its population in the Mediterranean Sea seems to have declined substantially from overfishing.|$|E

500|$|The puffadder shyshark is oviparous; {{there is}} no {{distinct}} breeding season and reproduction occurs year-round. Females deposit egg capsules one or <b>two</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time,</b> attaching them to vertical structures such as sea fans. The thin-walled egg cases are brown with distinctive pale transverse bands; and have a slightly furry texture and long adhesive tendrils at the corners. They are smaller than those of other shyshark species, measuring [...] long and [...] across. The young shark hatches after three months, and measures around [...] long. The length at maturation for both sexes has been reported as anywhere from [...] by various sources; this high degree of variation may reflect regional differences as sharks from deeper waters {{in the eastern part}} of its range seem to mature at a larger size than those from the west. The age at maturation is estimated to be around 7 years, and the maximum lifespan is at least 22 years.|$|E
500|$|Like {{other members}} of its family, the {{nursehound}} is oviparous. Known breeding grounds include the River Fal estuary and Wembury Bay in England, {{and a number of}} coastal sites around the Italian Peninsula, in particular the Santa Croce Bank in the Gulf of Naples. Adults move into shallow water in the spring or early summer, and mate only at night. The eggs are deposited in the shallows from March to October. Although a single female produces 77109 oocytes per year, not all of these are ovulated and estimates of the actual number of eggs laid range from 9 to 41. The eggs mature and are released <b>two</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time,</b> one from each oviduct. Each egg is enclosed in a thick, dark brown case measuring [...] long and [...] wide. There are tendrils at the four corners, that allow the female to secure the egg cases to bunches of seaweed (usually Cystoseira spp. or Laminaria saccharina).|$|E
500|$|Like {{other members}} of its genus, the dark shyshark is oviparous; adult females have a single {{functional}} ovary and two functional oviducts. There {{appears to be no}} distinct breeding season and reproduction occurs year-round. Females produce mature eggs <b>two</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time,</b> one per oviduct. The eggs are enclosed in purse-shaped capsules measuring [...] long and [...] across; each capsule is plain amber to dark brown in color and bears thin, coiled tendrils at the four corners. In one observation of an egg that hatched after 104 days, the developing embryo had external gill filaments until it was 50 days old, and completely absorbed its yolk sac shortly before hatching. Eggs in nature typically hatch in 610 months, with the newly hatched shark measuring [...] long. Both sexes grow at approximately the same rate, reaching sexual maturity at around 15 years of age. Mature males and females range from [...] and [...] long respectively. The maximum lifespan is 25 years.|$|E
