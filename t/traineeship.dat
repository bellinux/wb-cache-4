25|$|In Scotland, solicitors are {{regulated}} by the Law Society of Scotland, which requires prospective solicitors to pass exams in a curriculum set by the Society. Ordinarily, this is done by obtaining a Bachelor of Laws (LLB) in Scots law at a university approved by the Society, though {{it is also possible}} to sit the Society's own exams. Prospective solicitors are then required to take a one-year course provided by several Scottish universities and qualify for the Diploma in Professional Legal Practice, and then undertake a two-year <b>traineeship</b> with a law firm before they can qualify as a solicitor. As the Faculty of Advocates used to require an M.A. degree of its candidates, it used to be common to take a five-year combined MA LLB curriculum at the Scottish universities.

He was based at RAF Manston, an airfield near Margate, and served part of his time in air traffic control. On one occasion, a Spitfire was coming in to land. It was only about 50 feet above the ground before the runway controller alerted the pilot to the fact the plane's undercarriage hadn't lowered. The pilot opened up the throttle and climbed away. As this was a moment Anderson always remembered, he found it all too easy to write about aircraft when he devised stories for Thunderbirds. After completing his military service, he returned to Gainsborough, where he worked until the studio was closed in 1950. He then worked freelance on a series of feature films.|$|E

Summary What we know 	Indigenous Australians, particularly females, are more likely than the rest of the population to participate in apprenticeships and <b>traineeships,</b> mostly due to the relatively younger demographic structure of the Indigenous population (as apprenticeships are typically undertaken during youth). 	Among those {{enrolled in}} apprenticeships and <b>traineeships,</b> Indigenous {{students are more likely}} to be participating in courses of study leading to lower qualifications (Certificate I and II). 	For both Indigenous and non-Indigenous students, the key determinant of field of study is gender: males are much more likely to be participating in apprenticeships and <b>traineeships</b> that will result in them becoming tradespersons or related workers, and females are more likely to be working towards an occupation as an Intermediate Clerical, Sales and Service Worker. 	Indigenous Australians are less likely to be employed across all age groups. 	Apprenticeships are commonly seen as a useful tool for ‘Closing the Gap’.
