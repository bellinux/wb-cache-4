However, Mahlon Sands {{and his family}} stayed in England and travelled among European countries. They also visited the United States annually and were there for an extended visit from 1877 to 1879. <b>They</b> <b>kept</b> <b>their</b> house in Newport, Rhode Island throughout this time.|$|E
5|$|Raynald {{accompanied}} Baldwin to Antioch in 1151 {{and settled}} in the principality, according to Steven Runciman. It is certain that Raynald fought in Baldwin's army during the Siege of Ascalon in early 1153. He may have already been engaged to Constance of Antioch (as Runciman suggests), or their betrothal took place during Raynald's visit to the principality {{before the end of}} the siege (as Malcolm Barber proposes). <b>They</b> <b>kept</b> <b>their</b> betrothal a secret until Baldwin gave his permission to their marriage.|$|E

5|$|After he {{was married}} in December 1933, Cooper {{remained}} faithful to his wife until the summer of 1942, when he began an affair with Ingrid Bergman during the production of For Whom the Bell Tolls. Their relationship lasted through the completion of filming Saratoga Trunk in June 1943. In 1948, after finishing work on The Fountainhead, Cooper began an affair with actress Patricia Neal, his co-star. At first <b>they</b> <b>kept</b> <b>their</b> affair discreet, but eventually it became an open secret in Hollywood, and Cooper's wife confronted him with the rumors, which he admitted were true. He also confessed {{that he was in}} love with Neal, and continued to see her. Cooper and his wife were legally separated in May 1951, but he did not seek a divorce. Neal later claimed that Cooper hit her after she went on a date with Kirk Douglas, and that he arranged for her to have an abortion when she became pregnant with Cooper's child. Neal ended their relationship in late December 1951. During his three-year separation from his wife, Cooper was rumored to have had affairs with Grace Kelly, Lorraine Chanel, and Gisèle Pascal.|$|E
5|$|Feyenoord opened April away in Almelo against Heracles Almelo on Wednesday 2 April, a {{game that}} was moved due to the 2014 Nuclear Security Summit. The home team opened the score early; Feyenoord took the lead later {{in the first half}} with goals by Te Vrede and Vilhena. The game ended in a 2–1 win, Feyenoord's fourth consecutive, and {{solidified}} the second place with a four-point lead and four games to play. Feyenoord won their fifth consecutive game on 6 April at home against RKC Waalwijk with 2–0. Pellè scored both goals in his return from a four-game suspension. A week later Feyenoord won its sixth game in a row away at PSV 2–0. Mathijsen scored his first of the season {{in the first half and}} Janmmaat scored after the break. <b>They</b> <b>kept</b> <b>their</b> second place staying four points clear of third place FC Twente. Feyenoord secured the second place in the league, and the associated berth to the third qualifying round of the 2014–15 UEFA Champions League on 27 April with a 5–1 home win against SC Cambuur. Vormer scored in the first half before Cambuur equalized just before halftime; Vilhena scored twice and Pellè and Boëtius one each to arrive at the final scoreline in Feyenoord's seventh consecutive win.|$|E
5|$|Ramsay's request {{arrived at}} RAF Kenley. Two {{experienced}} pilots, Group Captain Francis Victor Beamish (10 victories) and Wing Commander Finlay Boyd (14 victories), were sent on patrol to investigate. Flying over the channel in Spitfires, {{they ran into}} large numbers of Bf 109s protecting a large fleet of warships and dived away. Holding radio silence <b>they</b> <b>kept</b> <b>their</b> discovery until they landed. They sighted the ships at 10:42 and landed at 11:09. It was another 16 minutes before Bomber Command was alerted and Ramsay {{did not know of}} the situation until 11:30. Soon afterwards, at around 12:16 GMT, the first naval actions began between escorting Schnellboots and British Motor Torpedo Boats (MTBs) and the British were alerted. Galland ordered all low flying to cease and allowed Max Ibel and his team aboard Scharnhorst to break radio silence. Ibel then began directing Fw 190 and Bf 109s toward RAF units heading to the area. As luck would have it, as the first outnumbered British units entered the airspace over the ships, the German vessels were now at their closest point to German airfields. It allowed the Luftwaffe to offer maximum protection.|$|E

50|$|Farmers from Brandleside Farm did {{not remove}} the stone. <b>They</b> also <b>kept</b> <b>their</b> ploughs a set {{distance}} {{away from the}} Thurgartstone. This was presumably because {{legend has it that}} there were pagan burials around this monument (Paterson 1866).|$|R
5|$|The {{situation}} looked set {{to improve}} in spring {{when the new}} Caliph, Umar II (r. 717–720), sent two fleets to the besiegers' aid: 400 ships from Egypt under a commander named Sufyan and 360 ships from Africa under Izid, all laden with supplies and arms. At the same time, a fresh army began marching through Asia Minor {{to assist in the}} siege. When the new fleets arrived in the Sea of Marmara, <b>they</b> <b>kept</b> <b>their</b> distance from the Byzantines and anchored on the Asian shore. The Egyptians were in the Gulf of Nicomedia near modern Tuzla and the Africans south of Chalcedon (at Satyros, Bryas and Kartalimen). Most of the Arab fleets' crews were composed of Christian Egyptians, however, and they began deserting to the Byzantines upon their arrival. Notified by the Egyptians of the advent and disposition of the Arab reinforcements, Leo launched his fleet in an attack against the new Arab fleets. Crippled by the defection of their crews, and helpless against Greek fire, the Arab ships were destroyed or captured along with the weapons and supplies they carried. Constantinople was now safe from a seaborne attack. On land too the Byzantines were victorious: their troops managed to ambush the advancing Arab army under a commander named Mardasan and destroy it in the hills around Sophon, south of Nicomedia.|$|E

25|$|The {{representations}} of animals, {{such as the}} bull, belong most likely to pre-Nuragic civilizations, however <b>they</b> <b>kept</b> <b>their</b> importance among the Nuraghe people, and were frequently depicted on ships, bronze vases, used in religious rites. Small bronze sculptures depicting half-man, half-bull figures have been found, as well as characters with four arms and eyes and two-headed deers: they probably had a mythological and religious significance. Another holy animal which was frequently depicted is the dove. Also having a religious role were perhaps the small chiseled discs, with geometrical patterns, known as pintadera, although their function has not been identified yet.|$|E
25|$|The Lakers {{originally}} had three picks entering the Draft. Their 29th pick {{was used to}} pick Toney Douglas from Florida State, and chose Patrick Beverley from Arkansas with their 42nd pick, a pick which they got from a previous trade with Charlotte. The Lakers traded both each for a 2011 second-round draft pick and cash. <b>They</b> <b>kept</b> <b>their</b> final pick and selected Chinemelu Elonu. The Texas A center earned All-Big 12 honors last season after averaging 9.8 points and a team-best 7.3 rebounds and 53 blocked shots. He set a school record by making 66.5 {{percent from the field}} and was named the Big 12's most improved player.|$|E

Prominent additions include two highly sought free agents, the starting pitcher Jordan Zimmermann and outfielder Justin Upton, as well as players acquired through trades, outfielder Cameron Maybin, and the veteran closer Francisco Rodriguez, who leads a totally revamped bullpen. The Tigers lost two 2016 draft picks due to free agent compensation but, because of their bottom-ten finish in 2015, <b>they</b> <b>kept</b> <b>their</b> first round pick. Key veteran losses include catcher Alex Avila and outfielder Rajai Davis, who both signed free agent deals with other teams in the division.|$|E
