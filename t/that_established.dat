5|$|Control is {{the third}} studio album by American {{recording}} artist Janet Jackson, released on February 4, 1986, by A Records. Her collaborations with the songwriters and record producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis resulted in an unconventional sound: a fusion of rhythm and blues, rap vocals, funk, disco and synthesized percussion <b>that</b> <b>established</b> Jackson, Jam and Lewis as the leading innovators of contemporary R. The album became Jackson's commercial breakthrough and enabled her to transition into the popular music market, with Control {{becoming one of the}} foremost albums of the 1980s and contemporary music.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to lack of}} {{surviving}} documentation, {{it is difficult to}} attribute unsigned works from the period with any degree of certainty. The origin of the Crucifix has often been contested, but is generally thought to be by Cimabue based on stylistic traits and mentions by both Vasari and Nicolò Albertini. It is relatively primitive compared to his 1290s works and is thus believed to date from his early period. According to Vasari, the crucifix's success led to the commissions at Pisa, Tuscany <b>that</b> <b>established</b> his reputation.|$|E

However, the political situation in the region, especially {{by the end of}} 1991, was marked with obstructions by the Serb Democratic Party (SDS) <b>that</b> <b>established</b> parallel authorities. Throughout 1991, the SDS established six autonomous regions (SAOs) in Serb-inhabited municipalities of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The SAO Northern Bosnia, proclaimed in Doboj in November, covered 17 municipalities, including Derventa, Bosanski Brod, Odžak, Bosanski Šamac, Modriča, Gradačac and Orašje. These SAOs were joined into Republika Srpska on 9 January 1992.|$|E

5|$|In the United States {{the film}} {{remained}} unseen until 1984, when Bedford Entertainment briefly released a heavily edited version {{under the title}} Unsane. It was approximately ten minutes shorter than the European release and was missing {{nearly all of the}} film's violence, which effectively rendered the numerous horror sequences incomprehensible. In addition, certain scenes <b>that</b> <b>established</b> the characters and their relationships were excised, making the film's narrative difficult to follow. This version of Tenebrae received nearly unanimously negative reviews.|$|E

5|$|Most World War I war {{designers}} {{attempted to}} produce memorials that were, as cultural historian Jay Winter describes, noble, uplifting, tragic and endurably sad.

This conservatism in part resulted from the age and background of the committees that were commissioning the memorials, and also from a sense <b>that</b> <b>established</b> architectural styles, rather a potentially more transitory but fashionable style, would be more enduring and appropriate.|$|E

5|$|The 1952 {{classification}} by French zoologist J.

In 1942, W.H. Bryan and D. Hill {{stressed the importance of}} microstructural observations by proposing that stony corals begin skeletal growth by configuring calcification centers, which are genetically derived. Therefore, diverse patterns of calcification centers are vital to classification. Alloiteau later showed <b>that</b> <b>established</b> morphological classifications were unbalanced and that there were many examples of convergent evolution between fossils and recent taxa.|$|E
