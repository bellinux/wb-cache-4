5|$|In {{consolidating}} his power, Muhammad Ali, {{the rebel}} governor of Ottoman Egypt, was modeling his {{rule on the}} bureaucratic organization characteristic of modern European states. Like earlier rulers of Egypt, Muhammad Ali desired to exercise control over greater Syria (Bilad al-Sham), both for its strategic value and for its natural resources. In addition to its abundant natural resources, Syria also had a prospering international <b>trading</b> <b>community</b> with well-developed markets. In addition, in Ali's strategy, Syria {{would serve as a}} captive market for goods being produced in Egypt. Moreover, the extension of Egyptian control over Syria was sought because it would serve as a buffer state between Egypt and the Ottoman sultan in Constantinople. Ali was attempting to become independent of the Ottoman Empire.|$|E
5|$|The {{canonical}} {{literature of}} Jainism {{does not mention}} the worship of Ganesha. However, Ganesha is worshipped by most Jains, for whom {{he appears to have}} taken over certain functions of the god of wealth, Kubera. Jain ties with the <b>trading</b> <b>community</b> support the idea that Jainism took up Ganesha worship as a result of commercial connections. The earliest known Jain Ganesha statue dates to about the 9th century. A 15th-century Jain text lists procedures for the installation of Ganapati images. Images of Ganesha appear in the Jain temples of Rajasthan and Gujarat.|$|E

25|$|Like other {{rulers of}} Egypt before him, Ali desired to control Bilad al-Sham (the Levant), both for its {{strategic}} value {{and for its}} rich natural resources; nor was this a sudden, vindictive decision {{on the part of}} the Wāli since he had harboured this goal since his early years as Egypt's unofficial ruler. For not only had Syria abundant natural resources, it also had a thriving international <b>trading</b> <b>community</b> with well-developed markets throughout the Levant; in addition, it would be a captive market for the goods now being produced in Egypt. Yet perhaps most of all, Syria was desirable as a buffer state between Egypt and the Ottoman Sultan.|$|E

25|$|The tumanurung legend is {{generally}} viewed by archaeologists (such as Francis David Bulbeck) as a mythologized {{interpretation of a}} historical event, the marriage of a Bajau potentate with a local aristocratic woman whose descendants then became the royal dynasty of Gowa.

Estimates based on dynastic genealogies suggest that the founding of the Gowa polity occurred around 1300.

25|$|While {{there is}} much doubt on the {{cultural}} background of early Christians, {{there is evidence that}} some members of the St Thomas Christian community observed Brahmin customs in the Middle Ages, such as the wearing of the sacred thread and having a kudumi.

He argues that the Syrian Christians in Kerala, integrated with Persian Christian migrant merchants, in the 9th century to become a powerful <b>trading</b> <b>community</b> and were granted the privileges by the local rulers to promote revenue generation and to undermine Buddhist and Jain traders who rivaled the Brahmins for religious and political hegemony in Kerala at the time.|$|E

The original synagogue was built in the 4th century in Kodungallur (Cranganore) when the Jews had a mercantile role in the South Indian region (now called Kerala) along the Malabar coast. When the community moved to Kochi in the 14th century, it built a new synagogue there.|$|E

Bob Lefsetz has stated that: “watching this movie {{makes you want to}} run from the theatre, grab your laptop and build your own empire,” noting that The Social Network has helped fuel an emerging perception that “techies have become the new rock stars.” This has led Dave Knox to comment that: “fifteen years from now we might just look back and realize this movie inspired our next great generation of entrepreneurs.” After seeing the movie, Zuckerberg was quoted as saying he is [...] "interested to see what effect The Social Network has on entrepreneurship", noting that he gets [...] "lots of messages from people who claim that they have been very much inspired... to start their own company." [...] Saverin echoed these sentiments, stating that the film may inspire [...] "countless others to create and take that leap to start a new business."

Accordingly, the Mod Act imposes a greater obligation on Customs to provide the public with improved information concerning the <b>trade</b> <b>community's</b> responsibilities and rights under Customs and related laws.
