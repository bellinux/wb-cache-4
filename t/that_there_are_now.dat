5|$|Cherry Springs State Park and the {{surrounding}} Susquehannock State Forest have recovered from the clearcutting of the lumber era. However, {{the composition of the}} forests has changed, so <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> more hardwoods, including sugar maple and black cherry, and fewer eastern white pine and eastern hemlock. The park also has apple trees from the CCC orchard. Over 400species of birds have been found in Pennsylvania, including 186that breed in the state. Birds such as ospreys, hawks, owls, nightjars, and bald eagles have returned to the park and state forest, and saw-whet owls have been studied in the park.|$|E
5|$|The {{accusations against}} Clarence, Stephen, Gull and Druitt also draw on {{cultural}} {{perceptions of a}} decadent ruling class, and depict a high-born murderer or murderers preying on lower-class victims. Because Druitt and the other upper-middle-class and aristocratic Ripper suspects were wealthy, there is more biographical material on them than on {{the residents of the}} Whitechapel slums. Consequently, it is easier for writers to construct solutions based on a wealthy culprit rather than one involving a Whitechapel resident. There is no direct evidence against Druitt, and since the 1970s, the number of Jack the Ripper suspects has continued to grow, with the result <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> over 100 different theories about the Ripper's identity.|$|E

In 1943 Riga Ghetto prisoners were brought here who were unable to work at Kaiserwald concentration camp, followed by those from the camp itself unable to work in 1944. In 1943 and onwards Nazis dug up graves and burned the bodies to hide the evidence. It is estimated <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> around 20,000 victims buried in the forest.|$|E
5|$|Among other {{inhabitants}} of London are 10,000 red foxes, so <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> 16 foxes for every square mile (2.6 square kilometres) of London. These urban foxes are noticeably bolder than their country cousins, sharing the pavement with pedestrians and raising cubs in people's backyards. Foxes have even sneaked into the Houses of Parliament, where one was found asleep on a filing cabinet. Another {{broke into the}} grounds of Buckingham Palace, reportedly killing some of Queen ElizabethII's prized pink flamingos. Generally, however, foxes and city folk appear to get along. A survey in 2001 by the London-based Mammal Society found that 80 percent of 3,779 respondents who volunteered to keep a diary of garden mammal visits liked having them around. This sample cannot be taken to represent Londoners as a whole.|$|E
5|$|Super Mario Kart {{also has}} three {{multiplayer}} modes; Mario Kart GP, Match Race and Battle Mode. The multiplayer modes support two {{players and the}} second player uses {{the bottom half of}} the screen which is used as a map in the single player modes. Mario Kart GP is the same as in single player, the only difference being <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> two human controlled and six computer-controlled drivers. Match Race involves the two players going head to head on a track of their choice without any opponents. In Battle Mode, the two players again go head to head, but this time in one of four dedicated Battle Mode courses. Each player starts with three balloons around their kart which can be popped by power-ups fired by the other player. The first player to have all three of their balloons popped loses.|$|E

Since the 1960s, the permanent Tibetan Buddhist population of Kathmandu has risen significantly so <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> over fifty Tibetan Buddhist monasteries in the area.

25|$|The {{fundamental}} difference of these whistles from those described above is <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> {{two sets of}} characteristic variables. For the driving source, the characteristic speed is U, and the characteristic dimension is L1. For the responding source, the characteristic speed is c0 and the characteristic dimension is L2, typically the corrected cavity depth or tube length. The non dimensional descriptors {{for each of these}} are the fluid mechanical Strouhal number and the acoustical Strouhal number. The tie between these two numbers is the commonality of the frequency.|$|E
25|$|Canada {{has also}} instituted {{a ban on}} {{discarding}} at sea in its Atlantic groundfish fishery that makes it illegal {{to return to the}} water any groundfish except those specifically authorised and those caught in cod traps. Authorised release is only considered for species that are known to have high survival rates on release or where there is no practical or nutritional use for a particular species. In addition to the banning of discards larger vessels are required to carry observers which would imply <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> no illegal discards on these vessels.|$|E

25|$|Several predators {{dwell in}} the {{labyrinth}} of channels, branches and roots that poke up into the air. This is the only mangrove ecoregion that harbours the Indo-Pacific region's largest terrestrial predator, the Bengal tiger. Unlike in other habitats, tigers live here and swim among the mangrove islands, where they hunt scarce prey such as the chital deer (axis axis), Indian muntjacs (Muntiacus muntjak), wild boars (Sus scrofa), and even rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta). It is estimated <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> 180 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area. The tigers regularly attack and kill humans who venture into the forest, human deaths ranging from 30–100 per year.|$|E

The national park status has meant <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> much greater restrictions on activities such as coal mining within the protected area although in 2012 BHP Billiton was reported as continuing mining exploration in Darkes Forest, just outside the park’s border. The area is said to be protected to the centre of the earth which in theory means that no more mining activities can take place.|$|E

500|$|The Jewel Tower is {{a three-story}} {{building}} of Kentish Ragstone with a brick parapet, structurally largely unchanged since the 14th century. The walls that once faced {{away from the}} palace are finely coursed, but the interior two walls are more crudely finished. The external windows are almost all 18th-century in origin and made from Portland limestone. The jagged remnants of the former palace walls jut out {{from the sides of}} the tower. The moat, now dry, stretches away east from the tower, passing by the former landing stage for boats from the Thames, [...] long and made from ashlar stone. The clearances of the post-war era mean <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> few neighbouring buildings to the tower, and it is much more visible than in previous centuries.|$|E
