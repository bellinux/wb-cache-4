5|$|The tengu of {{this period}} were often {{conceived}} of as <b>the</b> <b>ghosts</b> <b>of</b> the arrogant, {{and as a result}} the creatures have become strongly associated with vanity and pride.

5000|$|In Charles Dickens's A Christmas Carol, Marley's Ghost tells Ebenezer Scrooge he {{will receive}} visits from three spirits: <b>The</b> <b>Ghost</b> <b>of</b> Christmas Past, <b>The</b> <b>Ghost</b> <b>of</b> Christmas Present, and finally <b>The</b> <b>Ghost</b> <b>of</b> Christmas Yet to Come, to which Scrooge says, [...] "Spirit, I fear you most of all." ...|$|R
50|$|This version casts {{the famous}} Dickens {{characters}} as anthropomorphic animals; Ebenezer Scrooge and his relatives are skunks, Bob Cratchit {{and his family}} are rabbits, <b>the</b> <b>ghost</b> <b>of</b> Jacob Marley is a cricket, <b>the</b> <b>Ghost</b> <b>of</b> Christmas Past is a stork, <b>the</b> <b>Ghost</b> <b>of</b> Christmas Present is a kangaroo and <b>the</b> <b>Ghost</b> <b>of</b> Christmas Yet to Come is a walrus. This version differs from the original novel in many ways; for example, <b>the</b> <b>Ghost</b> <b>of</b> Christmas Yet to Come actually speaks, while most other versions have him mute and Tiny Tim doesn't die in the possible future revealed to Scrooge, but instead becomes as miserly as he is.|$|R

5|$|The {{street is}} a square on the British Monopoly game board, forming {{part of the}} green set ({{together}} with Regent Street and Bond Street).

5|$|A Christmas Carol in Prose, Being a Ghost-Story of Christmas, {{commonly}} known as A Christmas Carol, is a novella by Charles Dickens, first published in London by Chapman & Hall in 1843; the first edition was illustrated by John Leech. A Christmas Carol {{tells the story of}} Ebenezer Scrooge, an old miser who is visited by the ghost of his former business partner Jacob Marley and <b>the</b> <b>Ghosts</b> <b>of</b> Christmas Past, Present and Yet to Come. After their visits Scrooge is transformed into a kinder, gentler man.|$|E
5|$|The {{emotional}} {{character of}} the ceremonies around the memorials changed as grieving took place and many individuals, inevitably, continued with their lives. Some early ceremonies around memorials {{were believed to be}} closely associated with spiritual events. The opening of the Menin Gate memorial, for example, inspired Will Longstaff's dream that led to the famous Menin Gate at Midnight painting, portraying the fallen dead rising and walking through the gateway, while the Cenotaph ceremonies were photographed in 1922, and believed by some to show <b>the</b> <b>ghosts</b> <b>of</b> the war dead. Indeed, early ceremonies at the London Cenotaph after the war were felt to be particularly emotional; commentators felt that by the late 1920s, the events were more formal and less fraught with emotional than previously. Initially foreign diplomats in Britain were expected to lay wreaths on Armistice Day; this requirement was reviewed in the 1930s. In Australia, there were initially many local ceremonies at memorials on Anzac Day specifically for bereaved mothers; by the 1930s, these had been discontinued and incorporated into the wider ceremonial occasion.|$|E

5|$|The fate of L'Oiseau Blanc is {{occasionally}} {{mentioned in}} films. The 1999 made-for-TV Canadian film Restless Spirits, a children's film with the alternate title Dead Aviators, uses {{the mystery of}} Nungesser and Coli's disappearance as the key plot device. A young girl, who struggles with her pilot father's death in an aircraft crash years before, visits her grandmother in Newfoundland. While there, she encounters <b>the</b> <b>ghosts</b> <b>of</b> Nungesser and Coli, whose restless spirits constantly relive their own unheralded 1927 crash in a nearby pond. The girl decides to help the pair {{move on to the}} afterlife by assisting them in rebuilding their aircraft and completing their flight so they may be released and, by doing so, works through her own emotional distress over her father's test flight death. And in the opening montage of the 2005 film Sahara, based on Cussler's novel, a French newspaper article is displayed reporting a fictional story of NUMA finding the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The first story-driven game expansion, Nightmare in North Point, was {{released}} in October 2012. Its theme is based on Chinese horror and folklore, and features Chinese vampires known as the jiangshi. In the expansion's plot, Shen's girlfriend is abducted by the ghost of Smiley Cat, a former gangster killed by Uncle Po, who has risen up from the underworld as a ghost to take his vengeance on the Sun On Yee. Shen fights Smiley Cat's army of jiangshi, Yaoguai and possessed gangsters, as well as <b>the</b> <b>ghosts</b> <b>of</b> Dogeyes, Johnny Ratface and Ponytail, who reveals that Wei can defeat Smiley Cat by burning the last remnant of his original body. After incinerating his little finger, Cat returns to the underworld and Shen's girlfriend is freed.|$|E
5|$|Ann {{believes}} the {{figures to be}} <b>the</b> <b>ghosts</b> <b>of</b> Quint and Jessel, seeking to continue their passionate and violent sexual encounters through Miles and Flora. However, she is concerned to find that others apparently cannot see the ghosts. She then begins to suspect that Miles and Flora, having been groomed by and involved {{in the activities of}} Quint and Jessel, may be deliberately seeking to bring the pair back. She resolves to leave Bly, but, when saying goodbye to Miles, learns that he, too, sees the figures. Minutes after leaving, she asks to be taken back. Later, Ann panics, believing Miles and Flora to have left the house. She finds them by the lake, but they are playing roughly; when Miles pushes Flora's head under the water, Ann sees the pair as Quint and Jessel. She rushes to intervene, and grapples with the figure which alternates between Quint and Miles. When Ann repeatedly strikes Miles, Mrs Grose stops her, and Flora says that she no longer wishes to see Ann. After ordering the staff and Flora away from Bly, Ann waits with Miles to confront Quint. The pair are scared, but when Quint arrives Ann tells Miles to demand that Quint leave him alone. Miles (speaking with Quint's voice) shouts at Ann, but eventually (in his own voice) tells the ghostly Quint that he wishes him to leave. Ann embraces Miles, whose body goes limp.|$|E

5|$|Bertram meets Raimbaut, who {{has arrived}} for an {{assignation}} with Alice. He {{gives him a}} bag of gold and advises him not to marry Alice as his new wealth will attract plenty of women (Ah! l’honnête homme). Raimbaut leaves and Bertram gloats at having corrupted him. Bertram reveals that Robert, to whom he is truly devoted, is his son; he then enters an adjoining cave to commune with the spirits of hell. Alice enters and expresses her love for Raimbaut (Quand je quittai la Normandie). She overhears strange chanting coming from the cave and decides to listen; she learns that Bertram will lose Robert forever if he cannot persuade him to sign away his soul to the Devil by midnight. On emerging from the cave, Bertram realizes that Alice has heard everything (Mais Alice, qu’as-tu donc?). He threatens her and she promises to keep silent. Robert arrives, mourning the loss of Isabelle, and Bertram tells him that to win her he should seize a magic branch from the tomb of Saint Rosalia in a nearby deserted cloister. Although to take it is sacrilege, the branch will give Robert magical powers. Robert declares {{that he will be}} bold and do as Bertram instructs. Bertram leads Robert to the cloister. <b>The</b> <b>ghosts</b> <b>of</b> nuns rise from their tombs, beckoned by Bertram, and dance, praising the pleasures of drinking, gambling and lust. Robert seizes the branch and fends off the demons who surround him.|$|E
