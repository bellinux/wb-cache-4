40|$|Introduction: Fast and {{reliable}} pathogen detection {{is important for}} adequate management of infections. Although real-time PCR (rtPCR) is usually the most sensitive method for direct pathogen detection, it requires experienced technicians, includes several working steps and has a turnaround time of multiple hours. Therefore this method is not ideal for emergency diagnostics. <b>The</b> <b>FDA</b> cleared, <b>fully</b> automated sample to answer, FilmArray® (FA) multiplex PCR system (BioFire/bioMérieux) detects {{a broad spectrum of}} pathogens in ∼ 70  min. To optimize our diagnostic services during weekends and off-peak times, we compared the FA Respiratory Panel (RP) and FA Meningitis/Encephalitis (ME) Panel to our routinely used rtPCR assay. The FA panels detect 20 respiratory pathogens (17 viruses, 3 bacteria) in nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) and 14  M/E pathogens (7 viruses, 6 bacteria, Cryptococcus neoformans/gattii) in cerebrospinal fluids (CSF). Materials and methods: With FA we tested 84 retrospective samples (23 NPS, 29 broncheoalveolar lavages [BALs], 32 CSF) and 60 prospectively collected NPS that required urgent testing during the 2015 / 2016 flu season by FA and rtPCR. FA sample input volume was 300  ml for RP and 200  ml for ME. Commercial RP and ME quality control panels (MMQC Inc., Scarborough, USA), containing samples positive and negative for each analyte detected by the FA panels, were tested multiple times. For rtPCR, nucleic acids were extracted from 220  ml of sample and eluted in 55  ml using NucliSENS easyMAG (bioMérieux). Respiratory viruses were analyzed by real-time PCR using a combination of 7 duplex Respiratory Multi Well System r-gene™ (RG) assays (influenza A/B, RSV/hMPV, HRV&EV/cell control, ADV/HBoV, HCoV/HPIV 1 - 4) (Argene/bioMerieux), according to manufacturer's instructions. Additionally, we expanded FA RP testing to include (BALs), by implementing one additional sample preparation step. CSF was analyzed for virus using laboratory developed tests (LDTs) certified by the Swiss authorities. Results: RP and ME quality control panel results were 100...|$|R

The committee reviewed clinical trial data (including findings from the phase-III ADVANCE, ILLUMINATE, and REALIZE studies) showing that combining telaprevir with pegylated interferon and ribavirin produced a higher cure rate - and in less time - than standard therapy alone. This improvement is most notable for hard-to-treat patients including those with HCV genotype 1, people with liver cirrhosis, {{and those who did}} not respond to a prior course of interferon-based therapy.
