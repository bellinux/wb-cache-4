5|$|In {{the course}} of a 25-minute test an early R engine would consume 60Imperial gallons (gal) (270L) of {{pre-heated}} castor oil. The majority of this was spat out of the exhaust ports and smothered the <b>test</b> <b>cell</b> walls, milk being given to staff to minimise the effects of this well-known laxative. Up to 200gal (900L) of the special fuel blend had to be mixed for each test, 80gal (360L) of which were used just to warm the engine to operating temperature. The same coarse-pitch propeller used for flight trials was fitted throughout these tests.|$|E

500|$|Ground {{testing of}} the R {{involved}} the use of three Kestrel engines: one to simulate a headwind or airspeed, one to provide ventilation of the test area, and another to cool the crankcase. Superchargers could be tested on a separate rig that was driven by another Kestrel engine. Eight men were required to run a <b>test</b> <b>cell,</b> led by the [...] "Chief Tester" [...] who had the tasks of logging the figures and directing the other operators. One of these chief testers was Victor Halliwell who later lost his life whilst on board the water speed record contender Miss England II. The conditions in the <b>test</b> <b>cell</b> were particularly unpleasant; deafness and tinnitus lasting up to two days were experienced by test personnel even after plugging their ears with cotton wool. Development time was short and the deafening sound of three Kestrels and an R engine running at high power for 24hours a day took its toll on the local population. The Mayor of Derby stepped in and asked that the people endure the noise {{for the sake of}} British prestige; subsequently testing continued for seven months.|$|E
50|$|Atec has {{designed}} and manufactured many modular turbine <b>test</b> <b>cells</b> for APU, turboshaft, and turbojet engines. Notably, Atec designed and fielded 2 modular, regenerative turboshaft <b>test</b> <b>cells</b> for Rolls-Royce. These <b>test</b> <b>cells</b> were {{developed for the}} M250 engine and were tailored to Rolls-Royce’s Indianapolis production facility. Typical turboshaft <b>test</b> <b>cells</b> often utilize a water brake or other type of dynamometer to place a load on the engine, absorbing (and wasting) the produced energy. The Atec <b>test</b> <b>cells</b> use 500 hp electric generators to convert the rotational energy of the turboshaft into electrical energy. This allows Rolls-Royce to power the engine facility and sell excess generated power back to the Electric utility. Other electric regen system installations include those for Bell and Bristow.|$|R

The first was a nuclear research center with a nuclear reactor and six shielded radiation containment chambers for handling radioactive isotopes, referred to as hot cells, {{at the end of}} Reactor Road. The second was for jet engine trials, and had two test cells with bunkers just north of Quehanna Highway, about [...] apart. The northern <b>test</b> <b>cell</b> {{was at the center of}} the 16-sided polygon; even if a jet engine broke its moorings, it could not leave the polygonal area. Both of these were on the land which Curtiss-Wright had purchased, which was a regular octagon surrounded with a [...] fence built by forest rangers, supervised from three guard houses on Quehanna Highway and Wykoff Run Road. The third installation was an industrial complex at the southeast edge of the polygon, in Karthaus Township, on the Quehanna Highway. At this site, a Curtiss-Wright division manufactured Curon foam for furniture and household products and used beryllium oxide to make high-temperature ceramics for application in the nuclear industry.|$|E
500|$|The Mach–Zehnder {{interferometer}} is a {{more versatile}} instrument than the Michelson interferometer. Each of the well separated light paths is traversed only once, and the fringes can be adjusted {{so that they are}} localized in any desired plane. Typically, the fringes would be adjusted to lie in the same plane as the test object, so that fringes and test object can be photographed together. If it is decided to produce fringes in white light, then, since white light has a limited coherence length, on the order of micrometers, great care must be taken to equalize the optical paths or no fringes will be visible. [...] As illustrated in Fig.6, a compensating cell would be placed {{in the path of the}} reference beam to match the <b>test</b> <b>cell.</b> Note also the precise orientation of the beam splitters. The reflecting surfaces of the beam splitters would be oriented so that the test and reference beams pass through an equal amount of glass. In this orientation, the test and reference beams each experience two front-surface reflections, resulting in the same number of phase inversions. The result is that light traveling an equal optical path length in the test and reference beams produces a white light fringe of constructive interference.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn Ciona intestinalis, the {{elimination}} of extra-embryonic <b>test</b> <b>cells</b> during early stage of development is delayed by a fertilization signal. Test cells undergo a caspase-dependent apoptosis event repressed by thyroxine (T 4) -activated NF-κB. When apoptosis was experimentally blocked, the hatching stage was delayed. The incubation of unfertilized eggs with a 1 -h-fertilized egg extract or purified T 4 restored apoptosis in <b>test</b> <b>cells</b> at a similar timing than found in fertilized eggs. Ciona expresses specific genes forming a functional IκB/NF-κB pathway. One, Ci-p 65, was transiently induced upon fertilization via T 4 and found to exert its anti-apoptotic role in <b>test</b> <b>cells</b> nuclei {{as well as in}} a reconstituted cell system. Blocking NF-κB activity by dexamethasone-induced overexpression of Ci-IκB abrogated the repression of apoptosis in <b>test</b> <b>cells.</b> Overall, the data are consistent for defining a central coupling role of both T 4 and NF-κB during early embryo development...|$|R
40|$|Ascidian {{swimming}} larvae {{are entirely}} {{surrounded by a}} hyaline extracellular coat, called as tunic or test, on which numerous <b>test</b> <b>cells</b> adhere. The functional role played by <b>test</b> <b>cells</b> in larvae of various ascidian species consists in depositing submicroscopic structures known as ornaments and/or substances of proteoglycan nature in the larval test surface. The deposition of ornaments would render the larval test hydrophilic and thus allow the larvae to swim being immersed in sea water. Ultrastructural investigations reported in literature on larvae of Cionidae and Ascididae families have not evidenced the presence of ornaments in the swimming larval test. For these Ascididae families it has been hypothesized that <b>test</b> <b>cells</b> secrete an amorphous substance that would let them to adhere to larval tunic. In order to clarify the functional role played by <b>test</b> <b>cells</b> of swimming larvae of the Ascididae family, ultrastructural and cytochemical investigations {{have been carried out}} on <b>test</b> <b>cells</b> of Ascidia malaca swimming larvae. The ultrastructural observations have evidenced that these cells are metabolically active and show an amoeboidic behaviour as they mainly adhere {{to the surface of the}} test.

The cytochemical investigastions carried out at ultrastructural level have evidenced that the substances secreted by <b>test</b> <b>cells</b> and deposited on the larval test consisting of glycosaminoglycans.

40|$|International audienceProgrammed {{cell death}} {{is one of}} the most {{fascinating}} demonstrations of the plasticity of biological systems. It is classically described to act upstream of and govern major developmental patterning processes (e. g. inter-digitations in vertebrates, ommatidia in Drosophila). We show here the first evidence that massive apoptosis can also be controlled and coordinated by a pre-established pattern of a specific 'master cell' population. This new concept is supported by the development and validation of an original model of cell patterning. Ciona intestinalis eggs are surrounded by a three-layered follicular organization composed of 60 elongated floating extensions made of as many outer and inner cells, and indirectly spread through an extracellular matrix over 1200 <b>test</b> <b>cells.</b> Experimental and selective ablation of outer and inner cells results in the abrogation of apoptosis in respective remaining neighbouring <b>test</b> <b>cells.</b> In addition incubation of outer/inner follicular cell-depleted eggs with a soluble extract of apoptotic outer/inner cells partially restores apoptosis to apoptotic-defective <b>test</b> <b>cells.</b> The 60 inner follicular cells were thus identified as 'apoptotic master' cells which collectively are induction sites for programmed cell death of the underlying <b>test</b> <b>cells.</b> The position of apoptotic master cells is controlled by topological constraints exhibiting a tetrahedral symmetry, and each cell spreads over and can control the destiny of 20 smaller <b>test</b> <b>cells,</b> which leads to optimized apoptosis signalling...|$|R
