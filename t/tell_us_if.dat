25|$|Logic is {{concerned}} with the patterns in reason that can help <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>if</b> a proposition is true or not. However, logic does not deal with truth in the absolute sense, as for instance a metaphysician does. Logicians use formal languages to express the truths which they are concerned with, and as such there is only truth under some interpretation or truth within some logical system.|$|E
25|$|By this date, Charles Pratt was {{reaching}} an age to consider retirement, and he subsequently devoted {{much of his}} time and interests to activities such as founding the Pratt Institute. However, Pratt's son, Charles Millard Pratt (1858 to 1913), became Corporate Secretary of Standard Oil. As a part owner of Pratt and Company, Rogers, who was about 35 years old, now owned a share of Standard Oil himself. In the deal, Rockefeller had also added Henry Rogers to his team. He undoubtedly placed a high value on Rogers' potential. History does not <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>if</b> he foresaw that the promising young man was destined to become one of his major partners.|$|E

2500|$|Ingres's own {{paintings}} {{vary considerably}} {{in their use}} of colour, and critics were apt to fault them as too grey or, contrarily, too jarring. Baudelaire—who said [...] "M. Ingres adores colour like a fashionable milliner"—wrote of the portraits of Louis-François Bertin and Madame d'Haussonville: [...] "Open your eyes, [...] nation of simpletons, and <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>if</b> you ever saw such dazzling, eye-catching painting, or even a greater elaboration of colour". Ingres's paintings are often characterized by strong local colours, such as the [...] "acid blues and bottle greens" [...] Kenneth Clark professed to [...] "perversely enjoy" [...] in La Grande Odalisque. In other works, especially in his less formal portraits such as the Mademoiselle Jeanne-Suzanne-Catherine Gonin (1821), colour is restrained.|$|E
2500|$|In July, in a {{somewhat}} different context, Dean Greenough claimed the Court did all it could with the evidence it extracted from its witnesses. Grace Smerage, the mother of expelled student Keith Smerage, had complained to Greenough that Harvard had just graduated others her son said were as guilty as he or more so. Greenough replied {{on behalf of the}} Court: [...] "We certainly cannot be held responsible for not acting on evidence we did not possess, especially when we have asked all the boys we have summoned if they had anything further to <b>tell</b> <b>us.</b> <b>If</b> boys choose to shield those who are guilty they must accept the incomplete results of a Board acting upon information which is inadequate because the boys themselves have chosen to let it be inadequate." ...|$|E
2500|$|Soil forms from parent rocks through {{physical}} {{disintegration of}} rocks and by chemical alteration of the rock fragments. The types of soil minerals can <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>if</b> the environment was cool or warm, wet or dry, or whether the water was fresh or salty. Because CRISM is able to detect many minerals that form in soil, a goal was to use the instrument to help decipher ancient Martian environments. CRISM has found a characteristic layering pattern of aluminum-rich clays overlying iron- and magnesium-rich clays in many areas scattered through Mars' highlands. Surrounding Mawrth Vallis, these [...] "layered clays" [...] cover {{hundreds of thousands of}} square kilometers. Similar layering occurs near the Isidis basin, in the Noachian plains surrounding Valles Marineris, and in Noachian plains surrounding the Tharsis plateau. The global distribution of layered clays suggests a global process. Layered clays are late Noachian in age, dating from the same time as water-carved valley networks. The layered clay composition is similar to what is expected for soil formation on Earth - a weathered upper layer leached of soluble iron and magnesium, leaving an insoluble aluminum-rich residue, with a lower layer that still retains its iron and magnesium. Some researchers have suggested that the Martian clay [...] "layer cake" [...] was created by soil-forming processes, including rainfall, at the time that valley networks formed.|$|E

Moreover, the long-time response of the system to the change of the parameter is practically independent of the immediate response. 1...|$|R
