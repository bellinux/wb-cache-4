5|$|Culture <b>techniques</b> <b>are</b> {{designed}} to promote the growth and identify particular bacteria, while restricting {{the growth of the}} other bacteria in the sample. Often these <b>techniques</b> <b>are</b> designed for specific specimens; for example, a sputum sample will be treated to identify organisms that cause pneumonia, while stool specimens are cultured on selective media to identify organisms that cause diarrhoea, while preventing growth of non-pathogenic bacteria. Specimens that are normally sterile, such as blood, urine or spinal fluid, are cultured under conditions {{designed to}} grow all possible organisms. Once a pathogenic organism has been isolated, it can be further characterised by its morphology, growth patterns (such as aerobic or anaerobic growth), patterns of hemolysis, and staining.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{proposes a}} {{technique}} to detect defects as depicted in a thermal image. The <b>technique</b> <b>is</b> based on a local neighborhood pixel operation using kernel window 3 × 3. All pixels within this window will be mapped to only a single pixel value.

The main focus of the employed thresholding <b>technique</b> <b>is</b> the popular Otsu method and testing with other global thresholding <b>technique</b> <b>is</b> also given in the text.

40|$|With {{everyday}} passing, {{power generation}} from photovoltaic (PV) systems are getting increased around the globe. One of the drawbacks of PV systems {{is that they}} exhibit non-linear I-V curves with respect to atmospheric conditions. Therefore, maximum power point tracker (MPPT) <b>technique</b> <b>is</b> installed in every PV system. One {{of the most popular}} <b>technique</b> <b>is</b> perturb & observe (P&O) but this technique has some shortcomings. In this paper, MPPT <b>technique</b> <b>is</b> proposed which will optimize the P&O with respect to distributed PV (DPV) plant. Such that the deficiencies of P&O are removed. The proposed <b>technique</b> <b>is</b> designed for DPV and is working in two modes. In mode- 1, decision making of the proposed technique revolves around the mutual co-ordination between two modules/arrays. During this mode, one array will behave as leader (L) while other array as follower (F). In mode- 2, proposed technique utilizes the individual P&O for both arrays. Model is the superior performance mode in which efficiency of the proposed <b>technique</b> <b>is</b> better than P&O. While, in mode- 2 both techniques have same efficiency. Finally, the proposed <b>technique</b> <b>is</b> modeled in Matlab/Simulink. The proposed <b>technique</b> <b>is</b> tested under various weather conditions and superior performance of the proposed <b>technique</b> <b>is</b> proved through simulation result...|$|R
