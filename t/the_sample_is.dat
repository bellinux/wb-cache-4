5|$|For burnt bone, {{testability}} {{depends on}} {{the conditions under which}} the bone was burnt. If the bone was heated under reducing conditions, it (and associated organic matter) may have been carbonized. In this case <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> <b>is</b> often usable.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} a GIS {{study published}} in 2014 documented that for many rural areas {{the time needed to}} drive to water testing labs than is longer than <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> <b>is</b> viable.|$|E
5|$|The metal is {{divalent}} {{and has a}} noticeably high volatility. In {{order to}} reduce the self-radiation damage, most measurements of solid einsteinium and its compounds are performed right after thermal annealing. Also, some compounds are studied under the atmosphere of the reductant gas, for example H2O+HCl for EsOCl so that <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> <b>is</b> partly regrown during its decomposition.|$|E
3000|$|... * in {{the cross}} section were {{obtained}} for each <b>sample.</b> <b>The</b> volume of <b>the</b> <b>samples</b> <b>was</b> measured with a digital caliper. <b>The</b> <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> oven-dried, and <b>the</b> oven-dry weight and the BD of <b>the</b> <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> determined.|$|R
30|$|As part of <b>the</b> study, {{groundwater}} <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> {{collected from}} different areas. <b>Samples</b> <b>were</b> randomly taken from whole area of newly installed pumps {{to investigate the}} different water quality parameters in <b>the</b> groundwater. <b>The</b> <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> taken in 500  ml bottles. <b>The</b> 60 water <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> collected in total from the groundwater.

5|$|Finally, the gold-standard {{method of}} {{cellular}} localization is immunoelectron microscopy. This technique also uses an antibody to the protein of interest, along with classical electron microscopy techniques. <b>The</b> <b>sample</b> <b>is</b> prepared for normal electron microscopic examination, and then treated with an antibody to the protein {{of interest that}} is conjugated to an extremely electro-dense material, usually gold. This allows for the localization of both ultrastructural details {{as well as the}} protein of interest.|$|E
5|$|In some instances, lumbar {{puncture}} {{may be required}} {{if there is a}} suspicion that the symptoms might be caused by other problems (meningitis or subarachnoid hemorrhage). This is the examination of the cerebrospinal fluid that envelops the brain and the spinal cord; <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> <b>is</b> obtained with a needle that is passed under local anesthetic into the spine. In pituitary apoplexy the results are typically normal, although abnormalities may be detected if blood from the pituitary has entered the subarachnoid space. If there is remaining doubt about the possibility of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), a magnetic resonance angiogram (MRI with a contrast agent) may be required to identify aneurysms of the brain blood vessels, {{the most common cause of}} SAH.|$|E
5|$|Muscle biopsy can {{be useful}} if an episode of {{rhabdomyolysis}} {{is thought to be}} the result of an underlying muscle disorder. A biopsy sample taken during an episode is often uninformative, as it will show only evidence of cell death or may appear normal. Taking <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> <b>is</b> therefore delayed for several weeks or months. The histopathological appearance on the biopsy indicates the nature of the underlying disorder. For instance, mitochondrial diseases are characterized by ragged red fibers. Biopsy sites may be identified by medical imaging, such as magnetic resonance imaging, as the muscles may not be uniformly affected.|$|E
30|$|To {{investigate}} the specificity and adhesion of analyte {{to the surface}} of nanoholes, biotin–streptavidin immunoassay was studied with a nanohole sample in several subsequent steps, and the LSPR spectrum was taken after each step. First, <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> <b>was</b> immersed into biotinylated thiol at the concentration of 374 μM in ethanol for 20 h at room temperature to form a self-assembled monolayer of biotin, then <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> <b>was</b> rinsed with ethanol and DI water and nitrogen dried. Second, <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> <b>was</b> immersed into 1 μM streptavidin in PBS for 20 h at room temperature, dried without rinse. Third, <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> <b>was</b> rinsed repeatedly with ethanol, PBS and DI water and nitrogen dried. Fourth, <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> <b>was</b> exposed under a UV cleaner for 30 min to break the chemical bond between the thiol and gold, then <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> <b>was</b> rinsed with ethanol, PBS and DI water repeatedly and nitrogen dried. Fifthly, <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> <b>was</b> incubated with biotinylated thiol in ethanol for 20 h at room temperature again, rinsed and dried.|$|R
5000|$|In March 2015, the Norwegian University of Tromsø lost 8 {{radioactive}} samples including {{samples of}} caesium-137, Am-241 and strontium-90. <b>The</b> <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> {{moved out of}} a secure location {{to be used for}} education. When <b>the</b> <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> supposed to be returned the university was unable to find them. [...] <b>the</b> <b>samples</b> <b>are</b> still missing.|$|R
30|$|After {{the core}} slug cooled down, <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> <b>was</b> {{suspended}} on <b>the</b> analytical balance. <b>The</b> <b>sample</b> <b>was</b> totally submerged into water {{by adjusting the}} liquid level.|$|R
5|$|The Laue back {{reflection}} mode records X-rays scattered backwards {{from a broad}} spectrum source. This is useful if <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> <b>is</b> too thick for X-rays to transmit through it. The diffracting planes in the crystal are determined by knowing that the normal to the diffracting plane bisects the angle between the incident beam and the diffracted beam. A Greninger chart {{can be used to}} interpret the {{back reflection}} Laue photograph.|$|E
5|$|X-ray {{crystallography}} {{is related}} to several other methods for determining atomic structures. Similar diffraction patterns can be produced by scattering electrons or neutrons, which are likewise interpreted by Fourier transformation. If single crystals of sufficient size cannot be obtained, various other X-ray methods {{can be applied to}} obtain less detailed information; such methods include fiber diffraction, powder diffraction and (if <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> <b>is</b> not crystallized) small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS).|$|E
5|$|The first {{screening}} test in someone {{suspected of having}} HIT is aimed at detecting antibodies against heparin-PF4 complexes. This may be with a laboratory test of the ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) type. The ELISA test, however, detects all circulating antibodies that bind heparin-PF4 complexes, and may also falsely identify antibodies that do not cause HIT. Therefore, those with a positive ELISA are tested further with a functional assay. This test uses platelets and serum from the patient; the platelets are washed and mixed with serum and heparin. <b>The</b> <b>sample</b> <b>is</b> then tested {{for the release of}} serotonin, a marker of platelet activation. If this serotonin release assay (SRA) shows high serotonin release, the diagnosis of HIT is confirmed. The SRA test is difficult to perform and is usually only done in regional laboratories.|$|E
30|$|<b>The</b> <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> {{collected}} from <b>the</b> mine drainage from each mine and adjacent streams, from March to August in 2012. In the DS mine, <b>the</b> <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> collected on 28 March and 20 July; <b>the</b> <b>samples</b> from <b>the</b> ST mine {{were collected on}} 1 June and 26 August. <b>The</b> <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> divided two types such as chemical analysis and bioassay. For the chemical analysis, <b>the</b> <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> immediately filtered using a 0.45  μm cellulose ester membrane filter, then one <b>sample</b> <b>was</b> preserved using nitric acid (60  %; Dongwoo Chemical, Korea) to measure the cations (Al, As, Ca, Cd, Cu, Mn, Mg, Na, Zn) by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES, 4300 DV, Perkin Elmer, USA) in laboratory. For bioassay, <b>the</b> <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> collected in 4 L polyethylene containers, and stored below 4  °C to prevent microbial growth and metal precipitation.|$|R

5|$|The person’s throat {{is first}} swabbed {{to collect a}} sample of mucus. In most RSTs, this mucus sample is then exposed to a reagent {{containing}} antibodies that will bind specifically to a GAS antigen. A positive result is signified by a certain visible reaction. There are three major types of RST: First, a latex fixation test, which was developed in the 1980s and is largely obsolete. It employs latex beads covered with antigens that will visibly agglutinate around GAS antibodies if these are present. Second, a lateral flow test, which is currently the most widely used RST. <b>The</b> <b>sample</b> <b>is</b> applied to a strip of nitrocellulose film and, if GAS antigens are present, these will migrate along the film to form a visible line of antigen bound to labeled antibodies. Third, optical immunoassay is the newest and more expensive test. It involves mixing the sample with labeled antibodies and then with a special substrate on a film which changes colour to signal {{the presence or absence of}} GAS antigen.|$|E
25|$|With the Gouy {{balance the}} weight change of <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> <b>is</b> {{measured}} with an analytical balance when <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> <b>is</b> {{placed in a}} homogeneous magnetic field. The measurements are calibrated against a known standard, such as mercury cobalt thiocyanate, HgCo(NCS)4. Calibration removes the {{need to know the}} density of the sample. Variable temperature measurements can be made by placing the sample in a cryostat between the pole pieces of the magnet.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>sample</b> <b>is</b> first conditioned, or {{prepared}} for purification. Cells, cell debris, lipids and clotted material are first removed, typically by centrifugation followed by filtration with a 0.45µm filter. These large particles {{can cause a}} phenomenon called membrane fouling in later purification steps. In addition, the concentration of product in the sample may not be sufficient, especially {{in cases where the}} desired antibody is produced by a low-secreting cell line. <b>The</b> <b>sample</b> <b>is</b> therefore concentrated by ultrafiltration or dialysis.|$|E
30|$|Scanning {{electron}} microscopy (SEM) images of <b>the</b> <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> taken using a {{scanning electron microscope}} model JOEL (JSM- 6390 LV, Japan). Briefly, <b>the</b> <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> oven-dried and ground to pass through a 2  mm sieve. A small representative portion of <b>the</b> <b>samples</b> <b>was</b> coated with gold and mounted on SEM. <b>Samples</b> <b>were</b> then imaged by scanning them with a high-energy beam of electrons in a raster scan pattern.|$|R
30|$|In {{the present}} study, all <b>the</b> <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> tested at <b>the</b> {{constant}} stress amplitude {{up to the}} failure. The cooling of <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> <b>was</b> realized by an air stream. The temperature of <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> <b>was</b> controlled by infrared camera.

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>sample</b> <b>is</b> {{the matter}} {{analyzed}} in chromatography. It may {{consist of a}} single component {{or it may be}} a mixture of components. When <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> <b>is</b> treated in the course of an analysis, the phase or the phases containing the analytes of interest is/are referred to as the sample whereas everything out of interest separated from the sample before or {{in the course of the}} analysis is referred to as waste.|$|E
25|$|Unlike whole-animal respirometry, {{mitochondrial}} respirometry {{takes place}} in solution, i.e. <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> <b>is</b> suspended in a medium. Today mitochondrial respirometry is mainly performed with a closed-chamber approach.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>sample</b> <b>is</b> spotted at {{one corner}} of a square plate, developed, air-dried, then rotated by 90° and usually redeveloped in a second solvent system.|$|E
30|$|<b>The</b> {{collected}} soil <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> homogeneously mixed up. Unwanted portions like plant roots, stones, {{or other}} debris <b>were</b> removed. Then <b>the</b> <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> {{kept in a}} microwave oven about 48  h (at 60  °C). <b>The</b> soil <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> kept in room temperature and grinded with mortar and pestle. Fifteen grams of <b>the</b> grinded <b>samples</b> <b>was</b> taken for pellet formation. In the VANEOX pressing machine, a 15 -ton pressure was used to form the pellet. After the pellet formation, <b>the</b> <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> ready for <b>the</b> analysis in EDXRF.|$|R
50|$|Tellurium {{was first}} {{discovered}} in 1783 by Franz Joseph Müller von Reichenstein. He discovered tellurium in a <b>sample</b> of what <b>is</b> {{now known as}} calaverite. Müller assumed at first that <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> <b>was</b> pure antimony, but tests he ran on <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> {{did not agree with}} this. Muller then guessed that <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> <b>was</b> bismuth sulfide, but tests confirmed that <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> <b>was</b> not that. For some years, Muller pondered the problem. Eventually he realized that <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> <b>was</b> gold bonded with an unknown element. In 1796, Müller sent part of <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> to <b>the</b> German chemist Martin Klaproth, who purified the undiscovered element. Klaproth decided to call the element tellurium after the Latin word for earth.|$|R
30|$|For the {{investigation}} of BSA binding onto the nanoholes, the LSPR spectrum of a nanohole <b>sample</b> <b>was</b> first measured. Then, <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> <b>was</b> incubated with BSA in PBS buffer at the concentration of 1 mg/ml for 20 h at room temperature. <b>The</b> <b>sample</b> <b>was</b> nitrogen dried without rinse, and the LSPR extinction spectrum <b>was</b> measured.

25|$|To measure cosmogenic {{isotopes}} produced within solid earth materials, such as rock, {{samples are}} generally first put {{through a process}} of mechanical separation. <b>The</b> <b>sample</b> <b>is</b> crushed and desirable material, such as a particular mineral (quartz in the case of Be-10), is separated from non-desirable material by using a density separation in a heavy liquid medium such as lithium sodium tungstate (LST). <b>The</b> <b>sample</b> <b>is</b> then dissolved, a common isotope carrier added (Be-9 carrier in the case of Be-10), and the aqueous solution is purified down to an oxide or other pure solid.|$|E
25|$|With a Faraday balance <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> <b>is</b> {{placed in}} a {{magnetic}} field of constant gradient, and weighed on a torsion balance. This method can yield information on magnetic anisotropy.|$|E
30|$|The {{scanning}} {{electron microscopy}} (SEM) analyses were conducted with a quartz PIC image measurement system to observe the microstructure of <b>the</b> <b>samples.</b> <b>Samples</b> <b>were</b> mounted in epoxy resin and the surfaces were ground flat by 600 grit abrasive paper. <b>The</b> <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> then polished to achieve a smooth surface. <b>The</b> polished <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> placed into a vacuum and etched with argon gas (Ar) for 20  min.
