40|$|It is my {{pleasure}} and honour {{to address this}} distinguished gathering of top bankers. My remarks <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> are <b>on</b> <b>the</b> regulatory framework for the exchange and use of credit information; this is a subject which is of great relevance for both {{the development of the}} financial sector and customer protection. The interests of both the financial institutions and their customers must be properly balanced. The nature of financial transactions means that financial markets are information sensitive markets. Market imperfections in financial markets mostly emanate from some sort of informational problem. In extreme cases, lack of adequate information causes markets to fail completely; a phenomenon which has been analysed extensively by economists such as Josepth Stiglitz and George Akerlof, who were awarded Nobel prizes for their work. Access to credit information on prospective borrowers enables lenders to better evaluate the creditworthiness of the borrowers. This reduces the information costs of lending and hence should allow more credit to be made available at lower interest rates. Better credit information can reduce the extent of credit rationing which is a serious problem in financial markets...|$|R

40|$|As {{presenter}} {{for this}} {{session of the}} symposium I see my task as more to indicate than to prescribe. There are other reasons as well for a cautious approach. Even if one could claim {{to have a good}} understanding of the common features of the economies in question, the differences among them are also very important. It is therefore unlikely that any single prescription could satisfy all cases. And while I can claim a background in central banking, I can only claim a very great interest in the financial and economic transformations taking place across Central and Eastern Europe and the conditions under which central banks have to operate and establish a place for monetary policy. Some overlap with other parts of the symposium is unavoidable. For example, we need to assume that in <b>this</b> <b>morning's</b> first session, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> role of central banks, it was accepted that central banks will be provided with the tools necessary to conduct monetary policy i...|$|R
40|$|Let {{me first}} answer the two {{questions}} sometimes asked of me: First, No I {{am not the}} Herb everyone seems to be looking for. Second, No I am not as young as I look. But looking young may run in the family. This {{reminds me of a}} story I recently read about someone's uncle who visited his doctor for a check-up. The doctor examined him and pronounced him in fine shape for a man of 55. His uncle said, "Who said I was 55 ? Tomorrow is my birthday and I am turning 72 !" " 72 ", said the doctor, "That's amazing, you must come from a family of long livers, how old was your father when he died?" "Who said he was dead? " The uncle said, "He's 95 and <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> he was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> golf course at 7 o"clock. " "Incredible " said the doctor. "Well how old was your grandfather when he died?" "Who said he was dead? " said the uncle, "He's 112, and this Saturday he's getting married. " "Getting married? " said the doctor, "Why would a man of 112 want to get married?" His uncle looked at the doctor and said "Who said he wanted to get married?"
