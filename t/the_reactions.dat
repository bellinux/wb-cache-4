The combination of these functional groups allow amino acids to be effective polydentate ligands for metal-amino acid chelates.|$|E

5|$|Attempts to {{synthesize}} elements 119 and 120 push {{the limits of}} current technology, due to the decreasing cross sections of the production reactions and their probably short half-lives, expected {{to be on the}} order of microseconds. Heavier elements, beginning with element 121, would likely be too short-lived to be detected with current technology, decaying within a microsecond before reaching the detectors. Where this one-microsecond border of half-lives lies is not known, and this may allow the synthesis of elements 121 through 124, with the exact limit depending on the model chosen for predicting nuclide masses. The nuclides 296Uue, 296,299Ubn, 300Ubu, 300,303Ubb, 304Ubt, and 304Ubq, continuing up a possible narrow one-microsecond alpha-decaying corridor, could conceivably be produced in <b>the</b> <b>reactions</b> of projectiles of 50Ti, 54Cr, and 58Fe with targets of 248Cm, 249Bk, and 249Cf.|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, {{fertilization}} using synthetic chelates is {{the most}} common technique to address iron chlorosis, a disease that affects plant growth. Ethylenediamine-N,N'-bis(o-hydroxyphenyl) acetic acid (EDDHA) is among the most efficient iron chelating agents. To produce EDDHA, a reaction was performed using as reactants phenol, ethylenediamine, glyoxylic acid, and sodium hydroxide. To study <b>the</b> <b>reaction</b> kinetics, samples were withdrawn from the reactor during <b>the</b> <b>reaction</b> and <b>the</b> kinetics was quantified, evaluating the yield evolution during <b>the</b> <b>reaction</b> phase.

5|$|Monosaccharides in a closed-chain form {{can form}} glycosidic bonds with other monosaccharides, {{creating}} disaccharides (such as sucrose) and polysaccharides (such as starch). Enzymes must hydrolyze or otherwise break these glycosidic bonds before such compounds become metabolized. After digestion and absorption the principal monosaccharides {{present in the}} blood and internal tissues include glucose, fructose, and galactose. Many pentoses and hexoses can form ring structures. In these closed-chain forms, the aldehyde or ketone group remains non-free, so many of <b>the</b> <b>reactions</b> typical of these groups cannot occur. Glucose in solution exists mostly in the ring form at equilibrium, with less than 0.1% of the molecules in the open-chain form.|$|E
5000|$|Menshutkin further {{studied the}} effect of {{different}} solvents on <b>the</b> <b>reaction</b> rates.

5|$|Proteins {{based on}} {{cobalamin}} use corrin {{to hold the}} cobalt.

MeB12 promotes methyl (-CH3) group transfers. The adenosyl version of B12 catalyzes rearrangements in which a hydrogen atom is directly transferred between two adjacent atoms with concomitant exchange of the second substituent, X, which may be a carbon atom with substituents, an oxygen atom of an alcohol, or an amine. Methylmalonyl coenzyme A mutase (MUT) converts MMl-CoA to Su-CoA, {{an important step in}} the extraction of energy from proteins and fats.|$|E

5|$|The best-known role of {{proteins}} {{in the cell}} is as enzymes, which catalyse chemical reactions. Enzymes are usually highly specific and accelerate only {{one or a few}} chemical reactions.

Some enzymes act on other proteins to add or remove chemical groups in a process known as posttranslational modification. About 4,000 reactions are known to be catalysed by enzymes. The rate acceleration conferred by enzymatic catalysis is often enormous—as much as 1017-fold increase in rate over the uncatalysed reaction in the case of orotate decarboxylase (78 million years without the enzyme, 18 milliseconds with the enzyme).|$|E
