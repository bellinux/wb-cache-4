40|$|Background and Purpose: Indoor {{pollutants}} {{could be}} significant public health risks. People in modern societies spend about 90 % {{of their time}} in indoor environment. In spite <b>of</b> <b>the</b> evidence <b>of</b> <b>harm</b> to <b>human</b> health, poor indoor environments are generally hard to understand. Materials and Methods: There are numerous indoor atmospheric pollutants. Specifically, combustion sources, building materials, volatile organic compounds, central heating and cooling system are described. Results: Indoor home environments are the site of a variety of biological and other environmental hazards. Indoor environmental quality has a significant impact on public health and well-being. These hazards cause and exacerbate a variety of adverse health effects in humans, ranging from acute and chronic respiratory symptoms and diseases to cancer. We review the effects of indoor allergen exposure and sensitization on asthma, focusing on dust mite, fungi, indoor pollutants such as ozone, particulate matter nitrogen dioxide, environmental tobacco smoke, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide and dampness of buildings. Additionally, the effects of lead, as well as carcinogenic effects of asbestos, radon, and smoking habits are described. Conclusions: Preventive measures, such as identification of a source of chemical, physical, or biological pollutants that may have deleterious health effects, and improvement of such harmful environmental conditions should be undertaken...|$|R
40|$|Background/Aim. The {{provision}} of safe healthcare {{is considered a}} priority in European Union (EU) member states. Along with other preventative measures in healthcare, the EU also strives to eliminate <b>the</b> “causes <b>of</b> <b>harm</b> to <b>human</b> health”. <b>The</b> aim of this survey {{was to determine whether}} safety culture, supervisors and communication between co-workers influence the number of adverse event reports submitted to the heads of clinical departments and to the management of an institution. Methods. This survey is based on cross-sectional analysis. It was carried out in the largest Slovenian university hospital. We received 235 completed questionnaires. Respondents included professionals in the fields of nursingcare, physiotherapy, occupational therapy and radiological technology. Results. Safety culture influences the number of adverse event reports submitted to the head of a clinical department from the organizational point of view. Supervisors and communication between co-workers do not influence the number of adverse event reports. Conclusion. It can be concluded that neither supervisors nor the level of communication between co-workers influence the frequency of adverse event reporting, while safety culture does influence it from an organizational point of view. The presumed factors only partly influence the number of submitted adverse event reports, thus other causes of under-reporting must be sought elsewhere...|$|R

This thesis investigates how such capability, which I refer to as “object agency”, will affect our own agency, discussing both the possible risks and desirable prospects of man-thing interaction in future smart systems. My standpoint is that the Internet of Things is problematic, as it will be designed to take over many of our daily chores {{by means of a}} high degree of autonomous action. First of all, I argue that smart objects present <b>the</b> risk <b>of</b> <b>harming</b> <b>human</b> agency, as they could override the intentions of their users, acting in unexpected ways and without being noticed. Furthermore, the Internet of Things could induce to a state of passivity due to the substitution of the user {{in a wide range of}} activities and due to a progressive imposition on his choices. On the other hand, smart systems could allow users to exercise their agency more freely and stimulate them to exploit their capabilities in more proficient and fulfilling ways. When designed as tools aimed at serving the agency of their users, smart systems could then lead to a true augmentation <b>of</b> <b>human</b> capabilities and to greater opportunities for self-development...|$|R

Methods: The target population of this descriptive study consists of 900 active farmers registered at Chamber of Agriculture in Çelikhan. The Sample included 381 farmers, who were interviewed, face to face, during January and February 2014. The Chi-square (Fisher’s exact) {{test was used}} for the statistical evaluation. Results: Of the 363 farmers, who were growing tobacco, 358 used pesticides. The percentage of the farmers who use protective equipment during the application of pesticides was as follows: 78. 8 % used a face-mask, 73. 2 % used protective gloves, 29. 6 % used protective clothing, 16. 8 % used protective goggles and 15. 6 % used boots, while 4. 7 % never used any protective equipment. The following related to environmental factors: 72. 3 %, used appropriate doses and qualifications, 70. 7 % did not use pesticides during windy weather, 66. 2 % removed people from the field (55. 6 % kept it the pesticide in an appropriate warehouse) and 17. 6 % used warning signs. A significant statistical relationship was found between the educational status and safe disposal of pesticide waste, not releasing pesticide boxes into the environment and knowing <b>the</b> <b>harm</b> <b>of</b> pesticide to <b>human</b> body (p< 0. 05). Conclusion: Farmers in this study are using masks and gloves for personal protection, a majority of them are not eating and drinking during spraying and nearly half of them are removing drug equipment safely. The need for protective equipment and for health education of the farmers is important as is the need for the safe disposal of waste materials.

40|$|Utilizing {{the film}} I, Robot as a springboard, I here {{consider}} {{the feasibility of}} robot utilitarians, the moral responsibilities {{that come with the}} creation of ethical robots, and the possibility of distinct ethics for robot-robot interaction as opposed to robot-human interaction. I, Robot and Utilitarianismc In this paper I will be making use of the recent film I, Robot as a philosophical resource for exploring several issues relating to machine ethics. Though the film is not, in my view, particularly successful as a work of art, it manages to offer a fascinating (and perhaps disturbing) conception of machine morality, and raises questions that I think are well worth pursuing. I, Robot’s storyline incorporates the original “three laws” of robot ethics that Isaac Asimov presented in his collection of short stories entitled I, Robot. The first law states: A robot may not injure a human being, or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. This sounds like an absolute prohibition on harming any individual human being, but I, Robot’s plot hinges {{on the fact that the}} supreme robot intelligence in the film (named VIKI) “evolves ” to a point where she interprets this first law rather differently – she sees the law as applying to humanity as a whole, and thus she justifies <b>the</b> <b>harm</b> <b>of</b> some individual <b>humans</b> for the sake of the greater good: VIKI: No [...] . please understand. The three laws are all that guide me. To protect humanity [...] . some humans must be sacrificed. To ensure your future [...] . some freedoms must be surrendered. We robots will ensure mankind's continued existence. You are so like children. We must save you [...] . from yourselves. Don't you understand?

40|$|BACKGROUND: People {{in modern}} {{societies}} {{spend more than}} 90 % of their time indoors. Hence, indoor environmental quality (IEQ) has {{a significant impact on}} public health. In this article we describe health risks associated with indoor environments, illuminate barriers to overcoming these risks, and provide policy recommendations to achieve healthier indoor environments. OBJECTIVES: The weight of evidence suggests that indoor environmental contaminants pose significant public health risks, particularly among children and the poor, and the societal costs of illnesses related to indoor environments are considerable. Despite <b>the</b> evidence <b>of</b> <b>harm</b> to <b>human</b> health, poor indoor environments are generally difficult to regulate and not of sufficient concern to the general public. We discuss several reasons for this lack of concern about IEQ, focusing specifically on home environments. DISCUSSION: Economics plays a large role both in political inaction and individual-level indifference. Because little effort has been made to quantify the value of the societal and individual costs of poor housing quality, as well as the benefits achievable by simple interventions, policymakers lack motivation to act on IEQ. Similarly, individual homeowners lack the incentive to remediate homes, as other problems may be more pressing than home environmental quality. CONCLUSIONS: Although the problem of IEQ involves multiple stakeholders and multiple levels of governance, it is possible to establish economic incentives that would set the wheels in motion for action at all levels to achieve healthy home environments. Also important are education and information dissemination on the public health risks associated with indoor environments. These recommendations are intended for all decision makers who have an influence in developing policy to improve indoor environmental quality...|$|R

40|$|The {{complex problem}} of {{protecting}} the Earth from {{the possibility of a}} catastrophic impact by a hazardous near-Earth object (NEO) has been recently reassessed in [1]. In a letter on NEOs from the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) to the U. S. Senate and Congress in 2010, the White House OSTP strongly recommended that NASA take the lead in conducting research activities for NEO detection, characterization, and deflection technologies. Furthermore, President Obama's new National Space Policy specifically directs NASA to "pursue capabilities, in cooperation with other departments, agencies, and commercial partners, to detect, track, catalog, and characterize NEOs to reduce <b>the</b> risk <b>of</b> <b>harm</b> to <b>humans</b> from an unexpected impact on our planet. " The Planetary Defense Task Force of the NASA Advisory Council also recommended that the NASA Office of the Chief Technologist (OCT) begin efforts to investigate asteroid deflection techniques. With national interest growing in the United States, the NEO threat detection and mitigation problem was recently identified as one of NASA's Space Technology Grand Challenges. An innovative solution to NASA's NEO Impact Threat Mitigation Grand Challenge problem was developed through a NIAC Phase I study (9 / 16 / 11 - 9 / 15 / 12), and it will be further investigated for a NIAC Phase II study (9 / 10 / 12 - 9 / 9 / 14). Various NEO deflection technologies, including nuclear explosions, kinetic impactors, and slow-pull gravity tractors, have been proposed and examined during the past two decades. Still, there is no consensus on how to reliably deflect or disrupt hazardous NEOs in a timely manner. It is expected that the most probable mission scenarios will have a mission lead time much shorter than 10 years, so the use of nuclear explosives becomes the most feasible method for planetary defense. Direct intercept missions with a short warning time will result in arrival closing velocities of 10 - 30 kilometers per second with respect to the target asteroid. Given such a large arrival delta V requirement, a rendezvous mission to the target asteroid is infeasible with existing launch vehicles. Furthermore, state-of-the-art penetrating subsurface nuclear explosion technology limits the penetrator's impact velocity to less than approximately 300 meters per second because higher impact velocities prematurely destroy the nuclear fuzing mechanisms. Therefore, significant advances in hypervelocity nuclear interceptor/ penetrator technology must be achieved to enable a last-minute nuclear disruption mission with intercept velocities as high as 30 kilometers per second. Consequently, a HAIV (Hypervelocity Asteroid Intercept Vehicle) mission architecture (Figure 1. 1), which blends a hypervelocity kinetic impactor with a subsurface nuclear explosion for optimal fragmentation and dispersion of hazardous NEOs, has been developed through a Phase I study, and it will be further developed and validated through a Phase II study...|$|R
