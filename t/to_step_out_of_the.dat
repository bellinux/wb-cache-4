500|$|In {{the bedroom}} scene, both the {{negative}} and positive actions of the Lady are motivated by her desire. Her feelings cause her <b>to</b> <b>step</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> typical female role and into that of the male, thus becoming more empowered. At the same time, those same actions make the Lady appear adulterous; some scholars compare her with Eve in the Bible. By forcing Gawain to take her girdle, i.e. the apple, the pact made with Bertilak—and therefore the Green Knight—is broken. In this sense, {{it is clear that}} {{at the hands of the}} Lady, Gawain is a [...] "good man seduced".|$|E

500|$|In a less {{enthusiastic}} {{review for}} The Guardian, Killian Fox said Between the Times and the Tides was [...] "more interesting sonically in {{the tension between}} questing guitars and straightforward song structures {{than it is in}} terms of lyrics, which aim to be down to earth but end up middle of the road." [...] NME writer John Doran wrote, [...] "sure enough here are a wealth of rock gems that shine with a warm-hearted, Neil Young-like intensity. Those wanting clangour and dissonance will be disappointed, but everyone else will be pleasantly surprised." [...] Writing for Pitchfork Media, Grayson Currin deemed it a [...] "motley assortment of Sonic Youth nods, acoustic entreaties, and cloying pop-rockers" [...] but that [...] "Ranaldo's opportunity <b>to</b> <b>step</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sonic Youth shadows and into his own proper spotlight is mostly a miss made of mediocrity." [...] Ben Graham from The Quietus summarised the album as: [...] "while it may be traditional in structure, Between the Times and the Tides is innovative and inimitable in actual performance. The playing may draw on jazz, country, rock and Ranaldo's own avant-garde catalogue." [...] In Rolling Stone, Will Hermes found it [...] "great to hear the third voice in Sonic Youth stretching out. But it's also a reminder of their irreplaceable magic." ...|$|E

Clark is unknowingly resurrected by Lois, who is now aware that he is [...] "the Blur". Jor-El also informs Clark {{that he is not}} ready to be Earth's true savior, as there are inner demons that Clark must overcome first. In the episode [...] "Homecoming", Clark is visited by Brainiac 5, who shows Clark how his past has shaped his present, and will one day shape his future; including a vision of Clark's future self when he has fully embraced his destiny. In the episode [...] "Isis", Clark reveals his secret to Lois only to find out that she already knew he was [...] "the Blur", which is followed in a later episode by Clark proposing to Lois. Clark realizes that in order to be the hero the world needs, he will have <b>to</b> <b>step</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shadows and into the light. As a result, Clark makes the decision to turn [...] "Clark Kent" [...] into a real disguise— opting to wear eyeglasses and alter his mannerisms to be more shy and reserved— so that the Blur does not have to hide his face to the world. By the series finale, the darkness, which is revealed to be Darkseid, arrives on Earth to enslave all of humanity. Clark realizes that his entire life has been one big trial by Jor-El; accepting his true destiny, the Blur saves Earth from Darkseid's coming Apokolips. The series ends by moving seven years into the future, where Clark and Lois are finally getting married, and Clark has embraced his new identity as [...] "Superman".|$|E
2500|$|Before the 2003 season, Holmgren relinquished {{his general}} manager duties {{so that he}} could {{concentrate}} exclusively on coaching the team. [...] This move was especially hard for Holmgren as one of the factors for him leaving Green Bay was <b>to</b> <b>step</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shadow of long-time Packer GM Ron Wolf. [...] With their head coach focused solely on the coaching side, the Seahawks made the playoffs as a wild card with a 10-6 record and finished with an impressive 8-0 mark at home. The Seahawks would face Holmgren's former team, the Green Bay Packers at Lambeau Field. [...] The Seahawks came out strong but blew several opportunities (including a crucial endzone drop by receiver Koren Robinson) and were forced to go to overtime. [...] It was during the coin-flip where quarterback Hasselbeck made the prediction [...] "we want the ball, and we're going to score." [...] Unfortunately for Seattle, an Al Harris interception returned for a TD sealed the Seahawks fate and they were out of the playoffs again..|$|E

2500|$|The soundtrack {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics, with many calling it [...] "safe" [...] and a disappointment. Joginder Tuteja gave {{a rating of}} three out of five, terming it a mixed bag and wrote [...] "There isn't anything which comes across as memorable enough to be played a few months down the line, leave aside a few years. Eventually {{what you get is}} a soundtrack that would go along with the narrative and acts as a good situational ingredient but that's about it." [...] Koimoi also gave three out of five writing that album fall short of expectations. Planet Bollywood gave 5.5 out of 10, feeling [...] "Hai Ye Maaya" [...] was the only song worth listening, and wrote [...] " [...] Don 2 doesn't quite live up to expectations which were sky high after the huge success of the first film- it's a soundtrack that will only work alongside the movie and will take the story forward, but as an audio alone it just doesn't deliver. S-E-L play it safe by continuing on from where they left in the previous venture and there is hardly any innovation." [...] Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com gave the album a rating of two out of five calling it [...] "safe and self-conscious" [...] and wrote [...] "Don 2's music could fare much better if the composers Shankar-Ehsaan-and Loy had tried <b>to</b> <b>step</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prequel's shadow." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dallas {{opened the}} scoring with a 44-yard field goal, but Los Angeles responded with quarterback Pat Haden's 4-yard {{touchdown}} run. Late {{in the first}} half, Charlie Waters blocked a punt to set up running back Scott Laidlaw's 1-yard touchdown to give the Cowboys a 10–7 lead. Early in the final period, Rams kicker Tom Dempsey made {{what would have been}} a game-tying field goal, but Cliff Harris was called for a running into the kicker penalty on the play. The usually conservative Ram coach Chuck Knox uncharacteristically took the points off the board, giving Los Angeles a first down. A few plays later, Lawrence McCutcheon vindicated Knox's decision as he ran for a one-yard touchdown to give the Rams the lead, 14–10. With 1:59 remaining in the game, Waters blocked another punt and the Cowboys recovered the ball at the Los Angeles 17-yard line. On first down, Butch Johnson's reception was ruled incomplete because he could only get one foot down in bounds in the end zone. After two more incompletions, Staubach completed a pass to tight end Billy Joe DuPree at the 8, but he was immediately tackled by safeties Bill Simpson and Dave Elmendorf 1 yard short of the first down marker, causing a turnover on downs. After three [...] "kneel downs" [...] and Cowboy time outs, the Rams faced a 4th and 14 with seconds left in the game. Wary of another blocked punt, Coach Knox ordered Ram punter Rusty Jackson <b>to</b> <b>step</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> back of the end zone for an intentional safety, and the Rams won 14–12.|$|E
