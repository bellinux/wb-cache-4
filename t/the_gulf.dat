5|$|A non-tropical area of low pressure, first noted over <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> Stream on August7, {{entered the}} southeastern Gulf of Mexico and {{organized}} into a tropical depression about 120mi (190km) west of Fort Myers, Florida, by 18:00UTC on August10. As {{the newly formed}} cyclone moved west-northwest, a nearby upper-level low imparted high wind shear and dry air entrainment, and the depression degenerated into a remnant low twelve hours later without attaining tropical storm intensity. Upon degeneration, the low moved into <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> Coast of the United States and conducted a clockwise loop. It emerged into <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> of Mexico again on August16, where the disturbance nearly regenerated into a tropical cyclone before making a second landfall in Mississippi the next day.

5|$|According to the Azores High hypothesis, an anti-phase {{pattern is}} {{expected}} to exist between <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> of Mexico coast and the Atlantic coast.

Such a displacement of the Azores High is consistent with paleoclimatic evidence that shows an abrupt onset of a drier climate in Haiti around 3200 14C years BP, and a change towards more humid conditions in the Great Plains during the late-Holocene as more moisture was pumped up the Mississippi Valley through <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> coast.

5|$|As the eye moved onshore in Florida, the {{convection}} in the eyewall strengthened due {{to increased}} convergence, and Hurricane Hunters reported a warmer eyewall temperature than two hours prior. However, Andrew weakened as it continued further inland, and after crossing southern Florida in four hours, the storm emerged into <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> of Mexico with winds of 130 mph (210 km/h). In <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> of Mexico, the eye remained well-defined as the hurricane turned to the west-northwest, a change due to the weakening of the ridge to its north. Andrew steadily re-intensified over <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> of Mexico, reaching winds of 145 mph (235 km/h) late on August 25. As the high pressure system to its north weakened, a strong mid-latitude trough approached the area from the northwest.

Edith weakened further while crossing the Yucatán Peninsula, and emerged into <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> of Mexico near Campeche, Mexico late on September 11 as a minimal tropical storm. Edith initially failed to re-intensify as it moved northwestward, despite low amounts of wind shear and warm waters. This was because an anticyclone over <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> was closely connected with Hurricane Fern, which developed and moved over the northwestern portion of <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> of Mexico. The anticyclone resulted in an easterly upper-level flow across Edith, creating conditions not conducive for intensification.
