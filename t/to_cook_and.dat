25|$|The masonry oven {{is similar}} to a smoke pit; it allows for an open flame but cooks more quickly and uses {{convection}} to cook. Barbecue-baking can also be done in traditional stove-ovens. It can be used to cook meats, breads and other starches, casseroles, and desserts. It uses direct and indirect heat to surround the food with hot air <b>to</b> <b>cook,</b> <b>and</b> can be basted in much the same manner as grilled foods.|$|E

Lanying Lin studied very hard at this primary school and often got the best grade in the class. But she was still required to do all the washing and cooking. As soon as she went back home, she started doing housework. At night, after finishing all her housework, she finally began studying and slept after 12 a.m. every day. And at six in the morning, she got up <b>to</b> <b>cook</b> <b>and</b> then went to school. At the age of six, she could only sleep six hours a day and this continued for her whole life.|$|E

25|$|Zoffany {{went to see}} a play at Covent Garden {{concerning}} the death of Captain Cook who had been killed in Hawaii on his third voyage to find the North-West Passage in 1779. This is thought to have inspired him to paint the death of Cook at the hand of the Hawaiian natives. Cook had been given a mahiole (feathered helmet) and a feather cloak which was given to the Leverian Museum. Zoffany borrowed these as props for the construction of the painting which was not intended to be accurate and included poses that were taken from classic statues. This helmet remained in Sir Ashton Lever's collection, which was originally housed in Leicester Square. The feathered helmet that had been given <b>to</b> <b>Cook</b> <b>and</b> included in this painting is now in a museum in Vienna.|$|E
25|$|The most {{similar story}} {{is that of the}} two cannibal mothers in 2 Kings 6:24–33, which forms part of the Elisha cycle. The {{background}} is a famine in Samaria, caused by a siege on the city. As the king passes through the city, a woman calls him and asks him to decide in a quarrel between her and another woman: The two women had agreed <b>to</b> <b>cook</b> <b>and</b> eat the son of one woman, and on the other day to do the same with the son of the other woman; but after they ate the first woman's son, the other woman hid her own son. The king, shocked from the description of the case, tore up his royal cloth and revealed that he was wearing sackcloth beneath it. He blamed Elisha for the circumstances and went on to chase him.|$|E
25|$|In India, {{a kitchen}} {{is called a}} “Rasoi” or a “Swayampak ghar” (in Hindi/Sanskrit), and there exist many other names {{for it in the}} various {{regional}} languages. Many different methods of cooking exist across the country, and the structure and the materials used in constructing kitchens have varied depending on the region. For example, in north and central India, cooking used to be carried out in clay ovens called “Chulhas”, fired by wood, coal or dried cowdung. In households where members observed vegetarianism, separate kitchens were maintained <b>to</b> <b>cook</b> <b>and</b> store vegetarian and non-vegetarian food. Religious families often treat the kitchen as a sacred space. Indian kitchens are built on an Indian architectural science called vastushastra. The Indian kitchen vastu is of utmost importance while designing a kitchens in India. Modern-day architects also follow the norms of vastushastra while designing Indian kitchens across the world.|$|E

25|$|This was {{the first}} Test match played in England to start on a Sunday. The third Test of the series was {{dominated}} by England right from the start. England posted a strong first-innings total, helped by centuries from Ian Bell and Ballance, combined with a quick debut half-century by Jos Buttler {{and a return to}} form for Cook, before they declared with 14 overs remaining on the second day. In India's first innings, all the batsmen got starts, but a failure to capitalise on them meant that England had a 229-run lead. Thanks <b>to</b> <b>Cook</b> <b>and</b> a quick-fire fifty from Joe Root, England were able to declare for the second time on the stroke of tea on the fourth day, setting India a target of 445 runs for victory. India lost four wickets in the evening session, before Moeen Ali rattled through the lower order before lunch on day 5, resulting in India's worst batting display on the tour up to that point. Ali finished with figures of 8/129 for the match, and England won their first Test in 10 attempts.|$|E
25|$|The Portuguese sent a large {{subsequent}} expedition in 1517 {{to enter}} port at Guangzhou {{to trade with}} the Chinese merchants there. During this expedition the Portuguese attempted to send an inland delegation {{in the name of}} Manuel I of Portugal to the court of the Zhengde Emperor. Although Fernão Pires de Andrade was able to meet the Zhengde Emperor while the latter was touring Nanjing in May 1520, Pires de Andrade's mission waited in Beijing to meet the Zhengde Emperor once more, but the emperor died in 1521. The new Grand Secretary Yang Tinghe rejected eunuch influence at court and rejected this new foreign embassy by the Portuguese once Malaccan ambassadors arrived in China damning the Portuguese for deposing their king; the Portuguese diplomatic mission languished in a Chinese prison where they died. Simão de Andrade, brother to ambassador Fernão Pires de Andrade, had also stirred Chinese speculation that the Portuguese were kidnapping Chinese children <b>to</b> <b>cook</b> <b>and</b> eat them; Simão had purchased children as slaves who were later found by Portuguese authorities in Diu, India. In 1521, Ming dynasty naval forces fought and repulsed Portuguese ships at Tuen Mun, where some of the first breech-loading culverins were introduced to China, and again fought off the Portuguese in 1522.|$|E

Within a few years, Koski observes, [...] "paella, moussaka, ratatouille, hummus and gazpacho had become familiar in home kitchens, restaurants and supermarkets throughout the country." ...|$|E

She did not stand out academically although she was known for being clever and friendly. She was near-sighted and talked with a minor lisp during childhood. A family friend recounted a story years later about young Noether quickly solving a brain teaser at a children's party, showing logical acumen at that early age.
