5|$|In Amanita abrupta, as {{with most}} mushrooms, {{the bulk of the}} {{organism}} lies unseen beneath the ground as an aggregation of fungal cells called hyphae; under appropriate environmental conditions, the visible reproductive structure (fruit body) is formed. The cap has a diameter of , and has a broadly convex shape when young, but eventually flattens. The central portion of the cap becomes depressed in mature specimens. The cap surface is verrucose—covered with small angular or pyramidal erect warts (1–2mm tall by 1–2mm wide at the base); the warts are smaller and more numerous near the margin of <b>the</b> <b>cap,</b> <b>and</b> small fragments of tissue may be hanging from the margin of the cap. The cap surface, the warts, and the flesh are white. The warts can be easily separated from <b>the</b> <b>cap,</b> <b>and</b> in mature specimens they have often completely or partly disappeared. The white gills are placed moderately close together, reaching the stem but not directly attached to it.|$|E
5|$|Other species within Mutabiles include X.campanelloides, {{which can}} be {{differentiated}} by {{the shape of the}} thin-walled caulocystidia and yellow flesh in the stem.

5|$|Tipu's Tiger has {{provided}} inspiration to poets, sculptors, artists {{and others from}} the nineteenth century to the present day. The poet John Keats saw Tipu's Tiger at the museum in Leadenhall Street and worked it into his satirical verse of 1819, <b>The</b> <b>Cap</b> <b>and</b> Bells. In the poem, a soothsayer visits the court of the Emperor Elfinan. He hears a strange noise and thinks the Emperor is snoring.|$|E
5|$|Amanita regalis {{is easily}} {{distinguished}} from A.muscaria {{by the absence}} of any red color in <b>the</b> <b>cap,</b> <b>and</b> the yellow patches on the stem. If it is a form that has a pale-colored, yellowish-brown cap, Amanita regalis may be confused with the blusher (Amanita rubescens, edible). The latter species can be identified by the flesh-colored tinge it stains when cut or bruised, and also by the color of the flesh underneath the cuticle: A.regalis is yellowish while A.rubescens is white. Amanita pantherina has a similar color, but has white flesh below the cap cuticle, and a cup-shaped bulb with distinct margins around the edge.|$|E

5|$|Inocybe cookei, {{commonly}} known as the straw fibrecap, is a species of mushroom in the Inocybaceae family. It was first described in 1892 by Giacomo Bresadola, and is named in honour of Mordecai Cubitt Cooke. The species can be found in Europe, Asia and North America. It produces small mushrooms of an ochre colour, with a prominent umbo, fibres on <b>the</b> <b>cap</b> <b>and</b> a distinctive bulb {{at the base of the}} stem. It grows from soil in mixed woodland, and is encountered in summer and autumn, though is not common. Ecologically, it feeds through use of ectomycorrhiza. Inocybe cookei has been described as both toxic and non-toxic, but either way, is not advised for consumption.|$|E
5|$|Inocybe maculata {{is similar}} to the {{variable}} Inocybe lacera, the split fibrecap, but it can be differentiated by the darker colouration of <b>the</b> <b>cap,</b> <b>and</b> the white remains of the veil in the centre of the cap. The species is also similar in appearance to Inocybe lanatodisca, but can be readily distinguished by odour (I.lanatodisca has a characteristic sweet, green-corn smell) and the colour of the cap (I.lanatodisca has a fulvous cap). It is closely related to Inocybe fastigiata, but can again be distinguished by colour; I.fastigiata has lighter coloured fibrils.|$|E
5|$|Marasmius sasicola is {{a species}} of Marasmiaceae fungus known from Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan. First {{collected}} in 2000, it was described in 2002 by Haruki Takahashi. The species produces small mushrooms with white caps and very short, very thin black stems. Unlike in other, similar species, the stems enter the plant matter on which the mushroom grows. The six to eight white gills are spread out around <b>the</b> <b>cap,</b> <b>and</b> all of them reach the stem. The flesh has no taste or odour. Found in June, the species grows on dead Sasa leaves, from which it takes its specific epithet.|$|E

5|$|Mycena flavoalba bears {{resemblance}} to {{some members of}} the genus Hemimycena, such as H.lactea and H.delectabilis. It can be distinguished from these species by its white to yellowish cap, and differences in the shape of both its spores and caulocystidia (cystidia on the stem). H.conidiogena, a Spanish species newly described from in 2005, is also similar in appearance, but differs in the distribution of pigment in <b>the</b> <b>cap,</b> <b>and</b> the differential staining in response to the dye cresyl blue—M.flavoalba is positive, while H.conidiogena is negative.|$|E
5|$|Several {{characters}} {{serve to}} help distinguish Parasola auricoma from similar coprinoid mushrooms that grow in woodchips, including {{a lack of}} deliquescence, {{and the lack of}} a veil. Microscopically, it is characterized by the long, gold-pigmented, thick-walled setae on <b>the</b> <b>cap,</b> <b>and</b> ellipsoid spores with a germ pore. The distinctly grooved and pleated cap margin indicates that it is allied with the coprinoid species and not with the genus Psathyrella. Similar Parasola species include the common and widespread P.plicatilis, P.leiocephala, P.lilatincta, and P.kuehneri. Only microscopy will definitively separate these from P.auricoma—none of them have setae on the cap.|$|E
5|$|Strobilomyces foveatus is {{a little-known}} species of fungus in the Boletaceae family. It was first {{reported}} by mycologist E.J.H. Corner in 1972, from specimens he collected in Malaysia in 1959, {{and has since}} been found in Australia. Fruit bodies are characterized by the small dark brown to black conical scales covering <b>the</b> <b>cap,</b> <b>and</b> the net-like pattern of ridges on the upper stem. The roughly spherical spores measure about eight micrometres, and are densely covered with slender conical spines. The edibility of this species is unknown.|$|E

5|$|The Costa Rican bolete Leccinum neotropicalis is {{a closely}} allied species. It is {{distinguished}} from L.rugosiceps by its dark brown to dark reddish-brown color, and flesh {{that does not}} stain with injury. L.viscosum, found in Belize, features a similar cap and scaber pigmentation on the stipe, and similar color changes in response to injury in the flesh of <b>the</b> <b>cap</b> <b>and</b> {{the apex of the}} stipe; unlike L.rugosiceps, however, it also stains at the stipe base, and the cap is sticky rather than dry.|$|E
5|$|The edible Coprinellus bisporus {{is nearly}} {{identical}} but lacks the yellowish cap granules and only has two spores per basidium. The scaly inky cap (Coprinus variegatus = Coprinus quadrifidus) has a grayish-brown cap with dull white to brownish scales; its odor is disagreeable. The trooping crumble cap (Coprinellus disseminatus, edible) has smaller, yellow-brown to grey-brown caps and white gills that turn black {{but do not}} dissolve away; it always grows in large clusters on rotting wood (sometimes buried wood). Coprinus atramentarius is a larger, gray species that grows in dense clusters on stumps or on the ground from buried wood, lacks glistening particles on <b>the</b> <b>cap,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>cap</b> <b>and</b> gills dissolve at maturity. Coprinellus radians develops singly or in clumps from a tufted mat of coarse yellow-orange mycelium on the wood. Coprinellus truncorum is also covered with glistening granules and {{is said to be}} almost indistinguishable from C.micaceus in the field; microscopy is needed to tell the difference, as C.truncorum has ellipsoid spores with a rounded germ pore, compared to the shield-shaped (mitriform) spores with truncated germ pores of C.micaceus. One study suggests that compared to C.truncorum, C.micaceus is browner {{in the center of the}} cap (rather than grayish) and has a greater tendency to grow in clusters; more molecular evidence is required to determine if the two taxa are genetically identical.|$|E
5|$|The fruit bodies (mushrooms) of Stropharia caerulea {{feature a}} greenish-blue cap sparsely covered in white flecks of veil at the margin, and a sticky, glutinous surface texture. Gills on the cap {{underside}} have an adnate or sinuate {{attachment to the}} stipe. They are initially pale purplish-brown, becoming darker brown in age as the spores mature. The greenish stipe is covered in white scales up to a thin, transient ring. It is similar in appearance to its less common relative Stropharia aeruginosa, but that species has a more robust ring on its stipe, more scales on <b>the</b> <b>cap,</b> <b>and</b> darker gills with white edges.|$|E

5|$|The {{fruit body}} {{formation}} of L.torminosus is pileostipitocarpic. In {{this type of}} development, the hymenium forms early {{on the underside of}} <b>the</b> <b>cap</b> <b>and</b> upper stem of the mushroom primordium. As the cap enlarges, the margin, made of flaring filamentous hyphae that grow outward and downward, tends to curve inward, eventually forming a flap of tissue roughly parallel to the stem surface. As further development takes place, these hyphae make contact with and adhere to the hymenial surface of the stem, covering basidia and macrocystidia (very long cystidia) already present. The junction between the two tissues produces a cavity that provides some temporary protection to the basidia, although they are already fertile when the cap margin starts to grow.|$|E
5|$|The species Pholiota squarrosoides has {{a similar}} outward appearance, {{but it may be}} {{distinguished}} by its brown spores and sticky cap surface underneath the scales. In the hedgehog pholiota (Phaeomarasmius erinaceellus), the overall size is smaller—cap diameter —and the spores are cinnamon-brown. Some species in the genus Cystoderma also appear similar, but can be distinguished by microscopic features, like the presence of spherical (rather than club-shaped) cells in the cuticle of <b>the</b> <b>cap,</b> <b>and</b> also their habitat—Cystoderma usually grows on soil, rather than wood.|$|E
5|$|The spores are 7–9 by 7–9µm, spherical {{or nearly}} so, ornamented with a partial to {{complete}} reticulum (a system of raised, net-like ridges), with prominences up to 0.5µm high. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are both two- and four-spored, and measure 45–52 by 9–11µm. The cap cuticle is a poorly formed layer of inflated cells with scattered filamentous pileocystidia (cystidia on the cap).

5|$|In animals, poly(A) {{ribonuclease}} (PARN) {{can bind to}} <b>the</b> 5' <b>cap</b> <b>and</b> remove nucleotides {{from the}} poly(A) tail. The level of access to <b>the</b> 5' <b>cap</b> <b>and</b> poly(A) tail is important in controlling how soon the mRNA is degraded. PARN deadenylates less if the RNA is bound by the initiation factors 4E (at <b>the</b> 5' <b>cap)</b> <b>and</b> 4G (at <b>the</b> poly(A) tail), which is why translation reduces deadenylation. The rate of deadenylation may also be regulated by RNA-binding proteins. Once the poly(A) tail is removed, the decapping complex removes <b>the</b> 5' <b>cap,</b> leading to a degradation of the RNA. Several other enzymes {{that seem to be}} involved in deadenylation have been identified in yeast.|$|R
