5|$|At the University of Birmingham in Britain, the Australian {{physicist}} Mark Oliphant assigned two refugee physicists— Frisch and Rudolf Peierls—the task {{of investigating}} {{the feasibility of}} an atomic bomb, ironically because their status as enemy aliens precluded their working on secret projects like radar. Their March 1940 Frisch–Peierls memorandum indicated that the critical mass of uranium-235 was within {{an order of magnitude}} of 10kg, which was small enough to be carried by a bomber of the day. Research into how uranium isotope separation (uranium enrichment) could be achieved assumed enormous importance. Frisch's first <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> this could be achieved was with liquid thermal diffusion.|$|E
5|$|Wanting {{readers to}} know that the stone mask and its powers would be what would drive the plot, Araki started the manga with a prologue {{involving}} the mask, focusing on communicating the mood, rather than the standard way of opening a manga with an introduction of the protagonist. The concept of the Hamon power was created as he <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> to create drawings that show the invisible; he {{came up with the idea}} of a character punching a frog, which was left unharmed, while the rock underneath cracked open, thus showing the supernatural power of the character's abilities. It was also influenced by his love for karate manga, with the supernatural moves used within them.|$|E

40|$|In {{testing for}} the self-serving bias in {{performance}} evaluation, the authors propose that comparing managers' counterfactual and prefactual <b>thoughts</b> <b>about</b> subordinates' performance is more conclusive than the attributional approach and also offers practical advantages. In a study with 120 managers, a 4 -way interaction of subordinate performance, temporal perspective, direction, and reference confirmed the predicted pattern. Managers' <b>thoughts</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> a weak performance {{could have been}} enhanced had external references, but <b>thoughts</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> such a performance could be enhanced in the future focused on the leader. This asymmetry was only observed for weak performance.

5|$|The idea {{to develop}} a remake came when Oyamada, due to the Mana series' 25th anniversary in 2016, <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> he would like players {{to be able to}} play through the series in {{sequential}} order on modern game platforms. The platforms – Android, iOS and PlayStation Vita – were decided on from the beginning. Initially, there were some arguments at Square Enix about whether to create the game using 2D or 3D graphics; they settled on 3D, as Oyamada thought that 3D games are easier to control on smartphones. Additionally, the development team thought that a 3D version would be better, as it could be used as a base for potential remakes of other Mana games; depending on the reception of Adventures of Mana, Oyamada said that he would like {{to develop a}} remake of Seiken Densetsu 3, and would consider one of Secret of Mana depending on demand.|$|E
25|$|When {{the series}} reached seven volumes, Watsuki's boss {{suggested}} {{him that it}} was time to make a longer story-arc, which resulted in the creation of the fights between Kenshin and Shishio Makoto. The arc was only meant to be serialized for one year, but it ended up being one year-and-a-half long. This arc was also done to develop Kenshin's character as he considered him not to have a weak point. Watsuki commented that his artistic skills were honed with this arc, as he could draw everything he wanted to. The last arc from the manga was meant to be much shorter, but it turned out to be a fairly long one as he could not present it in a simplistic manner. This arc was originally made by Watsuki prior to the series' start, having already <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> would Kenshin's scar had been made. Watsuki also planned to create a Hokkaido arc and a sequel, but felt it would be better to start with another manga and so ended the series with the last arc he made.|$|E

500|$|After his {{two seasons}} with Trenton, Alston {{served as a}} player-manager for the first {{integrated}} U.S. baseball team based in the twentieth century, the Nashua Dodgers of the Class-B New England League.

500|$|Toriyama {{originally}} {{envisioned the}} plot {{not as a}} direct sequel to Final Fantasy XIII but instead as taking place 900 years after. However, while creating the backstory for the events in between both eras, {{it was decided to}} have the game revolve around time traveling. Toriyama expressed his wish to [...] "create a story where [...] ends up [...] happy one day" [...] as he considered her emotional state at the end of Final Fantasy XIII doubtful. He also wanted to [...] "see [...] take an active part" [...] because her crystal stasis {{over the course of the}} predecessor's story did not allow for such a role. Lead scenario writer Daisuke Watanabe <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> the narrative could be continued in a sequel. Emi Nagashima, also known by her pen name Jun Eishima, had written novellas for Final Fantasy XIII and was consulted early on in development to help come up with the plot for Final Fantasy XIII-2.|$|E
500|$|When {{writing the}} story, Uchikoshi {{made use of}} what he calls the [...] "inductive {{composition}} method", where a setting is created first, after which one thinks about a core to the story {{that can be used to}} make the setting work. He did not recommend this way of writing, as he saw it as gamble that might not have resulted in an interesting story. This is in contrast to the deductive composition method, where a core story is thought of first, after which a setting is [...] "deduced", that matches the core. As an example of inductive composition used, Uchikoshi did not initially think up the story's [...] "main trick", and instead created two protagonists only because he thought it was getting stale with single-protagonist stories in visual novels, after which he <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> to make two protagonists interesting. The writers only put little effort into hiding the 17-year gap between the Kid's and Takeshi's routes, writing each day of the story casually without a particular plan in mind. Rather, it took special effort to make it seem convincing when the game's secrets were revealed, with hints toward the truth added throughout the story, such as Tsugumi acting more suspicious when playing as the Kid due to having already experienced the events of Takeshi's route, or slight differences between the Kid's and Takeshi's routes due to the characters not being able to perfectly recreate events. While Coco was planned from the beginning as the character who knew the truth, Uchikoshi did not come up with the idea of leaving her on the bottom of the ocean until during the writing of the script.|$|E

500|$|However, in January 2012, Heigl {{stated in}} an {{interview}} that she has asked the producers if she could return to the show to give closure to Izzie's storyline: [...] "I've told them I want to ," [...] she said.

[...] But in March 2012, Shonda Rhimes said that there are no plans at the moment for the character to return, [...] "I think it was really nice to hear her appreciating the show. At the same time we are on a track we have been planning. The idea of changing that track is not something we are interested in right now." [...] Three years later, Rhimes said she has completely moved on from the idea of Izzie coming back, “I’m done with that story.

2500|$|After the {{completion}} of the development, they <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> to launch the game, and {{came up with the idea}} to put together fake game boxes for the fictional Arc Symphony, consisting of a PlayStation-style jewel case and JRPG-like cover art with inaccurate Japanese text. A few of these were given out to friends as keepsakes, who would play along with the illusion that the Arc Symphony JRPG was a real video game by posting about it on social media, sharing photographs of the jewel cases on the internet accompanied with comments about the nostalgic feelings they supposedly had for the game. Park said that she liked this idea, since it replicated the game's premise of learning about a game through its fan community in real life. Park and Evans brought the remaining cases to the Toronto Comic Arts Festival, where more people joined in; according to Park, some people insisted that they remembered playing the Arc Symphony JRPG, something she described as feeling surreal. In addition to the case, a fake fan site for the JRPG was created in the style of fan sites from the 1990s; it was coded by Park, and includes fake fan fiction. As she had never been interested in fan fiction herself, she described what she had written as [...] "accurately bad".|$|E
