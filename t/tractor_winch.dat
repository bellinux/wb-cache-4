40|$|A Zimbabwian {{designer}} {{has been}} testing a two-wheeled <b>winch</b> <b>tractor</b> on small farms {{for the last}} few years, with encouraging results. Small farmers in tropical regions with distinct dry and rainy seasons often experience great difficulty in field preparation. During the dry season, animal-powered tillage is usually not possible, as the animals become weak due to the shortage of green fodder and deep ploughing in dry soil usually needs a heavy tractor, which is too expensive. A small <b>tractor</b> incorporating a <b>winch</b> and anchor permits a light- weight machine to exert a high pull which can be used for deep ploughing during the dry season. Two people are required to operate a <b>winch</b> <b>tractor,</b> a driver and a plough controller. The plough is attached {{to the end of the}} winch chain which is wrapped around the winch drum on the traction unit. As the tractor driver propels his machine forward the winch chain unwinds from the drum and the plough remains at rest. When the chain is unwound from its drum the driver disengages the power from the wheels and engages it to the winch drum. The tension in the chain digs the tractor anchor into the ground and then, as the chain re winds onto its winch drum the plough is controlled by its operator as it is pulled up to the anchored tractor unit The two processes of driving the traction unit forward and then pulling the plough up to the anchored traction unit are repeated across the length of the field, until the machine is turned at the ends of the field. The area ploughed in a day is similar to when using animals and the fuel consumed is similar to that used when ploughed with a medium-sized tractor. The deep ploughing obtained from using the <b>winch</b> <b>tractor</b> permits the crop to be planted at the start of the rainy season and also encourages soil moisture conservation and plant root establishment.

40|$|In {{forestry}} practice, during forest harvesting {{there are}} many different situations while skidding timber assortments, which are dealt with individually depending on the circumstances. The main purpose of this scientific paper is to offer a model for the calculation of the optimal distance for skidding timber assortments uphill or downhill, in mountain conditions. The working area i. e. the harvesting volume is situated between two storey (horizontal) forest roads. This solution would enable the forest experts to make the right decisions when planning timber assortment skidding, i. e. to achieve the most favorable financial results of the work. The method is based on work efficiency i. e. the time required for skidding certain timber assortments (logs and firewood), when skidding is done by animals, adapted <b>tractor</b> equipped with <b>winch,</b> and mobile cable crane...|$|R
40|$|Harvesting {{operations}} in Turkey are performed using traditional methods employing mostly animals and manpower for skidding and <b>tractors</b> mainly for <b>winching.</b> To apply these methods efficiently, the trees {{have to be}} bucked into short lengths logs (3 - 4 m), which reduces log values and overall profits. To produce longer logs, aerial harvesting methods such as cable logging and helicopter logging could be implemented, especially in productive forests located in steep mountainous regions of Turkey. Almost all of the forests in Turkey are state forests and managed by the General Directorate of Forestry (GDF). The GDF uses helicopters in firefighting activities; however, helicopters have not been used in harvesting operations. Using helicopters in both firefighting and harvesting may increase the utilization rate of helicopters and reduce the average helicopter unit cost. The {{purpose of this study}} is to identify the factors affecting the cost and productivity of helicopter logging and to analyze the utilization of helicopter logging in Turkish forestry...|$|R

Leonard for the degree of Master of Forestry in Forest Operations presented on September 8 th. 2003 Title: Applications for Synthetic Rope in Logging Steel wire rope is used for many logging applications. This material has served the logging industry well in terms of strength, durability, and longevity. Steel wire rope is difficult to use because of properties that make it stiff, heavy, and unyielding. These same properties cause fatigue, exhaustion, and may contribute to worker injuries.

The logging industry is slow to change; so, not all of these initial trials were accepted. Designed research of synthetic rope in logging is needed to determine when synthetic rope is a suitable replacement for steel Vllfe rope. replace In our trials, we assessed static line applications (guylines, intermediate support lines, tree straps, and snap guylines) and running line applications for yarding and ground-based logging systems. Our running line applications using synthetic rope included two skidder / crawler <b>tractor</b> <b>winching</b> trials, a Boman Mark IV carriage trial, and a Koller K 300 mainline trial. Static line applications such as guylines, intermediate support lines, tree straps, and snap guylines are acceptable replacements of steel wire rope with synthetic rope. Loggers were more likely to try additional applications once they used synthetic rope as tree straps and were confident of its strength. Cost was an initial drawback for most logging contractors. Additional {{research is needed to determine}} damage, replacement, and wear criteria for synthetic rope in logging applications. Running line applications showed positive results in the skidder / crawler winching trials with faster cycle times and increased efficiencies for using synthetic rope. The Koller K 300 mainline trials also produced positive results as a running line. The Boman Mark IV internal drum carriage trial showed no significant differences between steel wire rope and synthetic rope. We believe designed research is necessary to evaluate carriage applications with synthetic rope. Future studies for static line applications should include guyline taglines, skyline taglines, haywire (rigging line) replacement, and various other applications. Putting synthetic rope into the hands of users will help identify valuable applications where synthetic rope has merit. Future studies for running lines should focus on designed trials to adequately observe the effects of synthetic rope in specific applications such as side-hill lateral yarding, uphill lateral pulling in winching trials, and other difficult logging conditions. Preliminary results show synthetic rope is a good candidate for the replacement of steel wire rope in selected logging applications. More research is needed to determine damage, replacement, and wear criteria for all applications of synthetic rope in logging...|$|R
40|$|A winch and a sulky can {{transform}} a farm tractor into an effective small-scale logging machine, closely resembling a wheeled cable skidder. The additional cost of these implements is very small, but they offer significant benefits when extracting timber under {{the conditions of}} small-scale forestry. The authors developed a productivity model for skidding timber with wheeled farm <b>tractors,</b> equipped with <b>winch</b> and sulky. The origin data pool contained over 300 individual skidding cycles, extracted from 8 separate tests. Statistical {{analysis of the data}} allowed calculating a simple mathematical relationship for estimating skidding productivity as a function of significant work conditions, such as: piece size, <b>winching</b> distance, <b>tractor</b> power, skidding distance and crew size. This model can provide useful directions to prospective users, contributing to operation planning, costing and optimization. It can predict {{a large proportion of the}} variability in the data and was successfully validated using reserved cycle records, extracted from the same data pool and not used for model development. Depending on tractor power and piece size, the average turn volume and productivity can exceed respectively 2 m 3 per cycle and 4 m 3 per Scheduled Machine Hour (SMH). Top performance can reach 8 m 3 SMH - 1, with heavy tractors and large logs. Â© 2011 Steve Harrison, John Herbohn...|$|R
40|$|In North-eastern Italian Alps wood {{extraction}} in steep terrain (up to 25 - 30 %) {{is generally}} performed {{by means of}} 4 WD agricultural <b>tractors</b> equipped with <b>winches.</b> One problem {{associated with the use}} of agricultural tractor in forestry, especially in off-road moving in steep terrain, is the stability and hence operatorâs safety. In order to overcome such a problem an adaptation of a 4 WD agricultural tractor for wood extraction in steep terrain has been developed. It considers different features especially designed to be installed on an agricultural tractor. The first feature consists in a self-levelling device, made by two arms, articulated on the tractorâs final drive box and moved by two hydraulic rams. On the end of each arm a free-turning bogie is mounted. Another feature is the elongation of the fork in which the front axle is articulated, in order to increase its tilting angle. Two side plates, bolted on the rear body of the tractor, represent the last feature. The plates allow moving the p. t. o. shaft and the three-point linkage to the back permitting the use of the mounted winch. The control of the levelling device is both automatic and manual. When manually operated the levelling device is controlled by means of a single lever on the right side arm of the operatorâs seat. The adapted tractor has demonstrated to operate in efficient and safe way on sloping and rough terrain...|$|R
