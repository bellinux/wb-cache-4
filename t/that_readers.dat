5|$|Jaeger and Wiley, in 2015, {{looked at}} readers' ability {{to monitor their}} own comprehension. Their study used a science text as {{the base of a}} lesson and {{decorative}} images as the seductive details. They found <b>that</b> <b>readers</b> were less able to monitor their own comprehension of the text when the text was sprinkled with decorative images.|$|E
5|$|On March 18, 1954 Sauk-Prairie Star editor Leroy Gore of Sauk City, Wisconsin {{urged the}} recall of McCarthy in a front-page {{editorial}} that ran alongside a sample petition <b>that</b> <b>readers</b> could fill out and mail to the newspaper. A Republican and former McCarthy supporter, Gore cited the senator with subverting President Eisenhower's authority, disrespecting Wisconsin's-own Gen. Ralph Wise Zwicker and ignoring the plight of Wisconsin dairy farmers faced with price-slashing surpluses.|$|E
5|$|Orm was {{concerned}} with priests' ability to speak the vernacular, and developed an idiosyncratic spelling system to guide his readers in the pronunciation of the vowels. He used a strict poetic metre to ensure <b>that</b> <b>readers</b> know which syllables are to be stressed. Modern scholars use these two features to reconstruct Middle English as Orm spoke it (Burchfield 1987, p.280).|$|E
5000|$|Rava {{also read}} [...] {{to say that}} the seven lamps gave light {{toward the center of the}} Menorah, and deduced from this that the middle in a series may be favored. Rava taught that if the first Torah reader on a weekday reads four verses of the {{obligatory}} ten verses read on weekdays, <b>that</b> <b>reader</b> is to be commended; if the second (middle) reader reads four verses, <b>that</b> <b>reader</b> is to be commended; and if the third (last) reader reads four verses, <b>that</b> <b>reader</b> is to be commended. In support of the proposition that one should commend the middle <b>reader</b> if <b>that</b> <b>reader</b> reads four verses, Rava taught that [...] says that the lights were made to face the western lamp — the middle lamp of the Menorah — and the western lamp faced the Divine Presence; and Rabbi Johanan taught that this shows that the middle one is specially prized.|$|R

5|$|The {{practice}} {{became more}} common during the 17th century—11 people were made Benchers between 1600 and 1630—and in 1614 {{one of the}} Benchers appointed was explicitly allowed {{to be a member}} of Pension. This became more common, creating a two-rank system in which both Readers and Benchers were members of Pension. However far more Readers were appointed than Benchers—50 between 1600 and 1630—and it appeared <b>that</b> <b>Readers</b> would remain the higher rank despite this change.|$|E
5|$|In an {{interview}} by Scholastic with Rick Riordan for The Lost Hero, Riordan was questioned about {{the whereabouts of}} Percy Jackson. The author hinted that {{the answer would be}} revealed as Jason's quest progressed. By the end of the book, he said <b>that</b> <b>readers</b> would have a good idea where the second book is going. On May 26, 2011, Riordan released both the cover art and the first chapter for The Son of Neptune confirming that Percy would {{play a role in the}} book.|$|E
5|$|The Famous Five series {{gathered}} such {{a following}} <b>that</b> <b>readers</b> asked Blyton {{if they might}} form a fan club. She agreed, on condition that it serve a useful purpose, and suggested that it could raise funds for the Shaftesbury Society Babies' Home in Beaconsfield, on whose committee she had served since 1948. The club was established in 1952, and provided funds for equipping a Famous Five Ward at the home, a paddling pool, sun room, summer house, playground, birthday and Christmas celebrations, and visits to the pantomime. By the late 1950s Blyton's clubs had a membership of 500,000, and raised £35,000 in the six years of the Enid Blyton Magazines run.|$|E
40|$|Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) {{comprises}} of uniquely identifiable, {{less expensive}} tags and <b>readers</b> <b>that</b> monitor these tags through Radio Frequency signals. The {{information in the}} tags will be collected {{with the help of}} the readers. The load for any reader is the number of tags <b>that</b> the <b>reader</b> has to monitor. For the effectiveness of the RFID system several algorithms like Load Balancing algorithm and Redundant Reader Elimination algorithm were proposed. In these existing schemes the former concentrates on the load of the reader while the latter concentrates on reducing the power consumption by the RFID system. A solution for improving the effectiveness of rfid system is proposed. The system effectiveness can be improved by balancing the load among the readers and turning off <b>readers</b> <b>that</b> do not monitor tags in order to reduce power consumption. System will find if any reader goes down and will wake up the <b>readers</b> <b>that</b> are in sleep state to monitor the tags if any are present in <b>that</b> failed <b>reader's</b> range. If still the tags are not monitored after wake up of redundant readers, the system will prompt for the replacement of <b>that</b> <b>reader...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} employs Jungian {{psychological}} type theory {{to examine the}} profile of 236 Readers serving in the Church of England (108 males and 128 females) alongside previously published data providing the psychological type profile of clergy serving within the Church of England (626 men and 237 women). The analysis was interpreted to test two competing accounts of <b>Reader</b> ministry: <b>that</b> <b>Reader</b> ministry expresses similar qualities to those reflected in ordained ministry, and <b>that</b> <b>Reader</b> ministry represents a pioneer ministry on {{the boundaries of the}} church. Overall the findings demonstrate significant psychological similarities between those exercising Reader ministry and those exercising ordained ministry, suggesting that, in the current generation, Readers tend to present themselves as clones of the clergy rather than as distinctive voices equipped for pioneer ministry or for fresh expressions of church...|$|R

5|$|After {{watching}} a dinosaur show at an arena in Springfield, Lisa discovers {{one of her}} favorite authors, T. R. Francis, working there in a dinosaur costume. The woman reveals to a shocked Lisa that she is just an actress the book publishing company used for the jacket photos, and that T. R. Francis is a complete fabrication. She further reveals that all popular young-adult book series were never each written by a single author with any inspiration, they are conceived by book publishing executives through market research and the use of multiple ghostwriters, just to make more money. When Homer finds out about this, he decides to get rich by group-writing a fantasy novel. He recruits a team consisting of Bart, Principal Skinner, Patty Bouvier, Moe Szyslak, and Professor Frink, all of whom have personal attributes or experiences that will help with writing the book: Skinner knows what teens like, Patty is a fantasy fiction fan, Moe has already published some children's books, and Frink has a computer. Lisa is shocked to find that they are group-writing a book, as she knows the only reason one would do that is to gain money. To show that what they are doing is wrong, she decides to write a novel on her own with a personal story <b>that</b> <b>readers</b> will connect with.|$|E

50|$|Exams are graded by {{at least}} two readers. Each reader assigns a grade of Satisfactory or Unsatisfactory to each essay question. Then if the student passes a {{majority}} of questions for <b>that</b> <b>reader,</b> the reader assigns a Satisfactory grade. If one reader passes a student, and a second fails that student, a third reader is then called in to make a final judgment {{and the use of}} the third reader is not visible to the student or their ordaining body.|$|R

25|$|The {{language}} of alchemy soon developed an arcane and secretive technical vocabulary designed to conceal {{information from the}} uninitiated.

25|$|There {{are many}} places where an {{editorial}} hand appears absent altogether. Neologisms are continually coined, and sentences are paragraph-long and convoluted.

Perhaps {{the idea is to}} induce a slightly dissociated state, so <b>that</b> <b>readers</b> can be lulled into belief. If one did not already possess some background, this book would give no lucid history of anthropology or primatology.|$|E
