50|$|Crioceris duodecimpunctata or Spotted <b>Asparagus</b> <b>Beetle</b> is {{a species}} of shining leaf beetles {{belonging}} to the family Chrysomelidae, subfamily Criocerinae.|$|R
50|$|Crioceris or <b>asparagus</b> <b>beetle</b> is a genus of {{the family}} Chrysomelidae of beetles. The name is neo Latin from Greek κριός, ram and , horn.|$|R
50|$|Tomato {{plants can}} protect <b>{{asparagus}}</b> from <b>asparagus</b> <b>beetles,</b> because they contain solanum that kills this pest, while asparagus plants (as well as marigolds) contain a chemical that repels root nematodes known to attack tomato plants.|$|R
50|$|The similar spotted <b>{{asparagus}}</b> <b>beetle</b> (Crioceris duodecimpunctata) {{is also a}} pest as an adult, {{feeding on}} tender shoots and leaves, but since the larvae feed only on the asparagus berries it is {{not considered to be}} as important.|$|R
50|$|The common <b>asparagus</b> <b>beetle</b> (Crioceris <b>asparagi)</b> is an {{important}} pest of asparagus crops both in Europe and in North America. Asparagus is its only food plant. The beetle is about half a centimeter long, metallic blue-black in color with cream or yellow spots on its red-bordered elytra. The larvae are fat gray grubs with dark heads.|$|R
50|$|Rotenone {{has been}} used as an organic {{pesticide}} dust for gardens. Unselective in action, it kills potato beetles, cucumber beetles, flea beetles, cabbage worms, raspberry <b>beetles,</b> and <b>asparagus</b> <b>beetles,</b> as well as most other arthropods. It rapidly biodegrades under warm conditions, so harmful residues are minimal. A light dusting on the leaves of plants will control insects for several days.|$|R
50|$|Adult and larval leaf beetles feed on {{all sorts}} of plant tissue, and all species are fully herbivorous. Many are serious pests of {{cultivated}} plants, for example the Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata), the <b>asparagus</b> <b>beetle</b> (Crioceris <b>asparagi),</b> the cereal leaf beetle (Oulema melanopus), and various flea beetles, and a few act as vectors of plant diseases. Others are beneficial due to their use in biocontrol of invasive weeds. Some Chrysomelidae are conspicuously colored, typically in glossy yellow to red or metallic blue-green hues, and some (especially Cassidinae) have spectacularly bizarre shapes. Thus, they are highly popular among insect collectors.|$|R
500|$|Chairman Mao Zedong of China {{attempted}} in April 1958 {{to reduce}} crop damage by tree sparrows, estimated at [...] of grain per bird each year, by mobilising {{three million people}} and many scarecrows to drive the birds to death by exhaustion. Although initially successful, the [...] "great sparrow campaign" [...] had overlooked the numbers of locusts and other insect pests consumed by the birds, and crop yields fell, exacerbating a famine {{which led to the}} deaths of 30million people between 1959 and 1961. The tree sparrow's consumption of insects has led to its use in agriculture to control fruit tree pests and the common <b>asparagus</b> <b>beetle,</b> Crioceris aspergi.|$|R
40|$|Asparagus, {{brought from}} Europe {{by the early}} settlers, was grown as a {{cultivated}} crop in the United States {{for more than two}} centuries before it became troubled with insect pests of major importance. Eventually, however, and also from across the sea, there were introduced into America two of its enemies widely known in Europe since the earliest times as <b>asparagus</b> <b>beetles.</b> These, together with a native fly whose larva is called the asparagus miner, comprise the only insects seriously affecting the growing of asparagus in this country. It is true, however, that grasshoppers, plant bugs, cutworms and a few other insects now and then attack the asparagus plant, but these are usually not of sufficient importance to cause serious injury...|$|R
40|$|Resulting from Directive 2009 / 128 /EC, all EU Member States have {{to comply}} with stricter {{guidelines}} regarding Integrated Pest Management before 2023. As implementation of IPM measures and strategies has a high perceived risk, demonstration of and discussion on possibilities may be {{a key element in}} reducing the risk perception. Together with Dutch asparagus growers and chain partners, WUR and Aceera initiated a grower’s network to examine and discuss pest status and possible risk of a number of insect pests in asparagus, and possible IPM solutions. Such networks are a Dutch government initiative, aiming at improved knowledge transfer from (applied) science to several crop sectors. In the asparagus network insect pest species were determined; pest status was estimated, simultaneously assessing the growers´ knowledge of the species. Subsequently a species specific approach was formulated and tested. Control strategy of the asparagus fly (Plioreocepta poeciloptera Schrank) was focused on a monitoring system, which was developed and validated by Applied Plant Research in 2012 - 2015. The presence and population pressure of the flies was determined in cooperation with farmers based on sticky trap catches. The <b>asparagus</b> <b>beetle</b> (Crioceris <b>asparagi</b> Linnaeus) was mainly controlled by all kinds of mechanical technics and natural enemies. This publication presents the outcome of this network with the new goals of the EU as background, that make implementation of new control methods necessary...|$|R
