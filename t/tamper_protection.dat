40|$|Abstract: Embedded devices {{installed}} {{as part of}} the smart grid rollout present a major dilemma for grid defenders, because they are soft targets that could allow an attacker to access critical assets (generators, control centers, etc.) deeper in the utility’s network. While both physical tampering and intrusion protection are large, well-studied fields, state-of-the-art protection schemes suffer from several flaws: They are not powerful enough to respond properly to different tamper events, their severe responses can lead to reduced grid availability, and they often require more setup resources than a utility operator can provide. To protect these networks, we present TEDDI (Tamper Event Detection on Distributed Infrastructure), a distributed, sensor-based <b>tamper</b> <b>protection</b> architecture for embedded devices on utility networks. TEDDI uses data gathered from across the network to make more-informed and more-accurate tamper decisions, and can customize its response based on the event it sees. It can also be configured and installed quickly, without needing a large base of knowledge beforehand. In this paper, we lay out the TEDDI architecture, and discuss how TEDDI solves the grid defender’s dilemma better than current work. 1 INTRODUCTION 1 As part of the push towards a smarter electric grid, utilities have installed a number of edge device...|$|E
40|$|Laser speckle {{has been}} {{proposed}} {{in a number of}} papers as a high entropy source of unpredictable bits for use in security applications. Bit strings derived from speckle can be used for a variety of security purposes such as in identification, authentication, anti-counterfeiting, secure key storage, random number generation and <b>tamper</b> <b>protection.</b> The choice of laser speckle as a source of random keys is quite natural, given the chaotic properties of speckle. However, this same chaotic behaviour also causes reproducibility problems. Cryptographic protocols require either zero noise or very low noise in their inputs; hence the issue of error rates is critical to applications of laser speckle in cryptography. Most of the literature uses an error reduction method based on Gabor filtering. Though the method is successful, it has not been thoroughly analysed. In this paper we present a statistical analysis of Gabor-filtered speckle patterns. We introduce a model in which perturbations are described as random phase changes in the source plane. Using this model we compute the second- and fourth-order statistics of Gabor coefficients. We determine the mutual information of perturbed and unperturbed Gabor coefficients and the bit error rate in the derived bit string. The mutual information provides an absolute upper bound on the number of secure bits that can be reproducibly extracted from noisy measurements...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a new security architecture for protecting software confidentiality and integrity. Different {{from the previous}} process-centric systems designed for the same purpose, the new architecture ties cryptographic properties and security attributes to memory instead of each individual user process. The advantages of such a memory centric design are many folds. First, it provides a better security model and access control on software privacy that supports both selective and mixed <b>tamper</b> resistant <b>protection</b> on software components from heterogeneous sources. Second, the new model supports and facilities tamper resistant secure information sharing in an open software system where both data and code components could be shared by different user processes. Third, the proposed security model and secure processor design allow software components protected with different security policies to inter-operate within the same memory space efficiently. Our new architectural support requires small silicon resources and its performance impact is minimal based on our experimental results using commercial MS Windows workloads and cycle based out-of-order processor simulation. ...|$|R

40|$|Wireless sensor {{networks}} {{are increasingly being}} used in applications where the communication between nodes needs {{to be protected from}} eavesdropping and <b>tampering.</b> Such <b>protection</b> is typically provided using techniques from symmetric key cryptography. The protocols in this domain suffer from {{one or more of the}} following problems ⎯ weak security guarantees if some nodes are compromised, lack of scalability, high energy overhead for key management, and increased end-to-end data latency. In this paper, we propose a protocol called SECOS that mitigates these problems in static sensor networks. SECOS divides the sensor field into control groups each with a control node. Data exchange between nodes within a control group happens through the mediation of the control head which provides the common key. The keys are refreshed periodically and the control nodes are changed periodically to enhance security. SECOS enhances the survivability of the network by handling compromise and failures of control nodes. It provides the guarantee that the communication between any two sensor nodes remains secure despite the compromise of any number of other nodes in the network. The experiments based on a simulation model show a seven time reduction in energy overhead and a 50 % reduction in latency compared to SPINS, which is one of the state-of-the-art protocols for key management in sensor networks...|$|R
40|$|Utilities are {{currently}} installing {{a number of}} resource-constrained embedded devices at the remote endpoints of their SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) networks {{as part of their}} smart grid rollout. These devices present a security risk for utilities: They are deployed in many different places and environments; they have very little physical security; and they have direct access back to control centers and other infrastructure. Therefore, these devices present an easy opportunity for attackers to infiltrate and damage a utility’s SCADA network, and protecting these networks is critical. While a large body of work exists in both the physical tampering and SCADA protection spheres, current schemes cannot be applied here: They are either not designed to protect both a device and the network it lives on, not flexible enough to handle the various tamper events that these remote devices face, or not lightweight enough to operate under the inherent constraints of a SCADA network.

40|$|An initial {{security}} {{evaluation of}} the proposed International Monitoring System (IMS) suggests safeguards at various points in the IMS to provide reliable information to the user community. Modeling the IMS as a network of information processing nodes provides a suitable architecture for assessing data surety needs of the system. The recommendations in this paper {{include the use of}} public-key authentication for data from monitoring stations and for commands issued to monitoring stations. Other monitoring station safeguards include <b>tamper</b> <b>protection</b> of sensor subsystems, preservation of data (i. e. short-term archival), and limiting the station`s network services. The recommendations for NDCs focus on the need to provide a backup to the IDC for data archival and data routing. Safeguards suggested for the IDC center on issues of reliability. The production of event bulletins should employ {open_quotes}two-man{close_quotes} procedures. As long as the data maintains its integrity, event bulletins can be produced by NDCs as well. The effective use of data authentication requires a sound key management system. Key management systems must be developed for the authentication of data, commands, and event bulletins if necessary. It is recommended that the trust placed in key management be distributed among multiple parties. The recommendations found in this paper offer safeguards for identified vulnerabilities in the IMS with regard to data surety. However, several outstanding security issues still exist. These issues include the need to formalize and obtain a consensus on a threat model and a trust model for the IMS. The final outstanding security issue that requires in-depth analysis concerns the IDC as a potential single point of failure in the current IMS design...|$|E
40|$|Data logging is a {{critical}} activity and the foundation for several information security related activities, including intrusion detection, forensics and event reconstruction. Most often, computer systems where logs are collected consist {{of a network of}} connected machines. In such a network, it is often desirable to have an overview of how events are related between machines. Thus, having a central log server to which other machines can send log data for processing, correlation and analysis is important. However, for the log data to be useful it must be trustworthy. To provide such trust, two important properties must be fulfilled, namely reliable and secure transmission, and tamper resistance. The purpose of this project was to investigate how reliable and tamper resistant centralized logging can be acheived in Ericsson’s SGSN-MME product. SGSN-MME is a high availability system where two components are redundant. To provide a trustworthy centralized logging in such an environment, failure of redundant components must also be taken into consideration. To investigate whether and to what extent it is possible to achieve reliable transmission, two syslog applications, rsyslog and syslog-ng, were evaluated. To support the evaluation, a XEN-based lab system representing the SGSN-MME was designed. The different parts of SGSN-MME were simulated by virtual machines. Component redundancy was achieved by using open source software similar to what is used in the real SGSNMME. To benchmark the two applications, seven test cases representing different failure scenarios were defined and executed. The test results show {{that it is possible to}} achieve zero loss transmission for most of the test cases for both rsyslog and syslog-ng. To achieve zero message loss it is necessary to use both an application based transport protocol and a reliable disk buffer. <b>Tamper</b> <b>protection</b> requirements have been determined by means of threat modelling. It is assumed that several users on SGSN-MME have root access. Therefore, it is concluded that the most promising solution is to make use of a cryptographic hardware device for encryption key storage...|$|E

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{adoption of}} mobile devices applications {{in daily life}} activities such as payments, identification, {{authorization and access control}} represents a new challenge from the security perspective, since private or sensitive data is being used in an untrusted environment (the mobile device). In this sense, one of the objectives of mobile computing for the near future is to make mobile devices suitable for security-sensitive applications. Since the past decades, secure microcontrollers have been successfully implemented to create smartcards, which have been used to secure banking, transport, access and identification cards. Today, the smartcards have evolved to Secure Elements to be integrated in smartphones, wearables, IoT nodes, and all kind of mobile devices. Secure Elements are computing units encapsulated in an integrated circuit that are capable of securely host and execute applications, store cryptographic material and perform cryptographic operations in a secure environment. The success of Secure Elements is based on their capability to act as physical root of trust for applications and services that require high degree of security in a resource constrained device. In the near future, the massive integration of secure element in mobile devices will enable new kind of security-critical applications to be performed by mobile devices ensuring privacy, authenticity and integrity of data. Identification and passports will be securely embedded in mobile devices, wallet applications will be extensively used, access control to multi-owner vehicles, ticketing, transportation, authentication of IoT nodes, authorization of vehicles in low-emission zones, and all kind of applications requiring secure storage and <b>tamper</b> <b>protection</b> will become feasible from the security point of view. Secure Elements are currently integrated in mobile devices through UICC cards, embedded chips soldered to the mother board or to some extent, smartSD cards. They can be accessed directly through the NFC interface or through the application processor. When the SE is accessed through the NFC interface the communications are routed through the NFC controller, without intervention of the mobile operating system. When the communication is performed from an application running in the application processor, the application require system level permissions that are not usually given to regular applications. Therefore, access to secure elements is currently controlled by a few players and not widely open to application developers, researchers or academics. Nevertheless, there is still a broad field of study around secure elements. This work address several sources of uncertainty around secure elements, including communication interfaces and protocols, development platforms and key capabilities of secure elements which are currently available in the market. The conclusions derived from this work reaffirm that secure elements are promising solutions to secure mobile devices, relying in software and hardware mechanisms to guarantee the desired security properties...|$|E

40|$|The ease {{of digital}} media {{modification}} and dissemination necessitates content protection beyond encryption. Information hidden as digital watermarks in multimedia enables protection mechanism in decrypted contents. The aims {{of this research}} are three-fold: (i) to investigate the strength and limitations of current watermarking schemes, (ii) to design and develop new schemes to overcome the limitations, and (iii) to evaluate the new schemes using application scenarios of copyright <b>protection,</b> <b>tamper</b> detection and authentication. We focus on geometrically robust watermarking and semi-fragile watermarking for digital images. Additionally, hybrid schemes that combine the strength of both robust and semi-fragile watermarks are studied. Robust watermarks are well suited for copyright protection because they stay intact with the image under various manipulations. We investigated two major approaches of robust watermarking. In the synchronization approach, we employed motion estimation for watermark resynchronization. We also developed a novel watermark resynchronization method that has low computational cost using scale normalization and flowline curvature. In another approach, we firstly analyzed and improved a blind watermark detection method. The new method reduces significantly the computational cost of its watermark embedding. Secondly, we created a geometric invariant domain {{using a combination of}} transforms, and adapted the blind watermark detection method that we improved. It totally eliminates the need of resynchronization in watermark detection, which is a very desirable achievement that can hardly be found in existing schemes. On the other hand, semi-fragile watermarks are good at content authentication because they can differentiate minor image enhancements from major manipulations. New capabilities of semi-fragile watermarks are identified. Then, we developed a semi-fragile watermarking method in wavelet domain that offers content authentication and tamper localization. Unlike others, our scheme overcomes a major challenge called cropping attack and provides approximate content recovery without resorting to an original image. Hybrid schemes combine robust and semi-fragile watermarks to offer deductive information in digital media forensics. We firstly carried out a pilot study by combining robust and fragile watermarks. Then, we performed a comparative analysis on two implementation methods of a hybrid watermarking scheme. The first method has the robust watermark and the fragile watermark overlapped while the second method uses non-overlapping robust and fragile watermarks. Based on the results of the comparative analysis, we merge our geometric invariant domain with our semi-fragile watermark to produce a hybrid scheme. This hybrid scheme fulfilled the copyright <b>protection,</b> <b>tamper</b> detection, and content authentication objectives when evaluated in an investigation scenario...|$|R

40|$|Abstract:With the {{explosive}} growth of internet and the fast communication techniques {{in recent years the}} security and the confidentiality of the sensitive data has become of prime and supreme importance and concern. To protect this data from unauthorized access and tampering various methods for data hiding like cryptography, hashing, authentication have been developed and are in practice today. In this paper we will be discussing one such data hiding technique called Steganography. Stegnography is the process of concealing sensitive information in any media to transfer it securely over the underlying unreliable and unsecured communication network. Our paper presents a survey on various data hiding techniques in steganography that are in practice today along with the comparative analysis of these techniques. Data hiding, a form of steganography, embeds data into digital media for the purpose of identification, annotation, and copyright. Several constraints affect this process: the quantity of data to be hidden, the need for invariance of these data under conditions where a “host ” signal is subject to distortions, e. g., lossy compression, {{and the degree to which}} the data must be immune to interception, modification, or removal by a third party.

For the last few years, 9 reversible watermarking techniques are gaining popularity because of its increasing applications in some important 10 and sensitive areas, i. e., military communication, healthcare, and law-enforcement. Due to the rapid evolution of 11 reversible watermarking techniques, a latest review of recent research in this field is highly desirable. In this survey, 12 the performances of different reversible watermarking schemes are discussed on the basis of various characteristics 13 of watermarking. However, the major focus of this survey is on prediction-error expansion based reversible 14 watermarking techniques, whereby the secret information is hidden in the prediction domain through error expansion. 15 Comparison of the different reversible watermarking techniques is provided in tabular form, and an analysis is 1...|$|R
40|$|Software {{protection}} {{is one of}} the most important problems in the area of computing as it affects a multitude of players like software vendors, digital content providers, users, and government agencies. There are multiple dimensions to this broad problem of software protection. The most important ones are: (1) protecting software from reverse engineering. (2) protecting software from tamper (or modification). (3) preventing software piracy. (4) verification of integrity of the software;In this thesis we focus on these areas of software protection. The basic requirement to achieve these goals is to provide a secure execution environment, which ensures that the programs behave in the same way as it was designed, and the execution platforms respect certain types of wishes specified by the program;We take the approach of providing secure execution environment through architecture support. We exploit the power of reconfigurable components in achieving this. The first problem we consider is to provide architecture support for obfuscation. This also achieves the goals of <b>tamper</b> resistance, copy <b>protection,</b> and IP protection indirectly. Our approach is based on the intuition that the software is a sequence of instructions (and data) and if the sequence as well the contents are obfuscated then all the required goals can be achieved;The second problem we solve is integrity verification of the software particularly in embedded devices. Our solution is based on the intuition that an obfuscated (permuted) binary image without any dynamic traces reveals very little information about the IP of the program. Moreover, if this obfuscation function becomes a shared secret between the verifier and the embedded device then verification can be performed in a trustworthy manner;Cryptographic components form the underlying building blocks/primitives of any secure execution environment. Our use of reconfigurable components to provide software protection in both Arc 3 D and TIVA led us to an interesting observation about the power of reconfigurable components. Reconfigurable components provide the ability to use the secret (or key) in a much stronger way than the conventional cryptographic designs. This opened up an opportunity for us to explore the use of reconfigurable gates to build cryptographic functions...|$|R
