40|$|Abstract. Carbon fiber is a fiber material, so <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> {{must be kept}} {{constant}} in the placement process. The attitude of carbon fiber placement head will change with the change of a placement path. Focusing on <b>the</b> problem of <b>tension</b> fluctuation caused by the attitude of carbon fiber placement head, gravity balance characteristic of symmetrical objects is adopted to propose a tension control method for eliminating <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> fluctuation and tension measuring error caused by gravity. In this way, <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> is kept constant depending on tension feedback control. Mathematical model and theoretical analysis show that <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> control method with gravity balance can eliminate the gravity influence on <b>tension</b> and make <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> keep constant...|$|R

5|$|By {{contrast}} with <b>the</b> <b>tensions</b> in England, in Normandy Henry had occasional disagreements with the Church but generally enjoyed very {{good relations with}} the Norman bishops. In Brittany, Henry had the support of the local church hierarchy and rarely intervened in clerical matters, except occasionally in order to cause difficulties for his rival Louis of France. Further south, however, the power of the dukes of Aquitaine over the local church was much less than in the north, and Henry's efforts to extend his influence over local appointments created tensions. During the disputed papal election of 1159, Henry, like Louis, supported Alexander III over his rival Victor IV.|$|E

40|$|AbstractLateral {{tension in}} cell plasma {{membranes}} plays {{an essential role}} in regulation of a number of membrane-related intracellular processes and cell motion. Understanding the physical factors generating <b>the</b> lateral <b>tension</b> and quantitative determination of <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> distribution along <b>the</b> cell membrane is an emerging topic of cell biophysics. Although experimental data are accumulating on membrane tension values in several cell types, <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> distribution along <b>the</b> membranes of moving cells remains largely unexplored. Here we suggest and analyze a theoretical model predicting <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> distribution along <b>the</b> membrane of a cell crawling on a flat substrate. We consider <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> to be generated by the force of actin network polymerization against the membrane at the cell leading edge. The three major factors determining <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> distribution are <b>the</b> membrane interaction with anchors connecting the actin network to the lipid bilayer, the membrane interaction with cell adhesions, and the force developing at the rear boundary due to the detachment of the remaining cell adhesion from the substrate in the course of cell crawling. Our model recovers the experimentally measured values of <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> in fish keratocytes and their dependence on the number of adhesions. The model predicts, quantitatively, <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> distribution between <b>the</b> leading and rear membrane edges {{as a function of the}} area fractions of the anchors and the adhesions...|$|R
