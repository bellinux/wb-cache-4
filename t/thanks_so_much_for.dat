Johnny had indeed forgotten her birthday but is reminded when he glances at the calendar in his office, as he's holding Peg. Johnny races home with a bouquet of carnations and a bracelet for Joanne. She is very happy, and doubly so when he agrees {{to take her to the}} movies. He had also agreed to have lunch with Peg and her father, but is a bit disturbed that the Allegro is the chosen restaurant. Peg and Stuart have already been seated when he arrives, and after a few words with Joanne at the bar, he joins them. Stuart <b>thanks</b> Jack <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> helping Peg.At home that night Joanne says she can understand why Johnny didn't introduce her to his friends at lunch. She's so fat. When he presses her about her eating problem, she confesses to having had an abortion rather than mess up his life with her child she knows he doesn't want. This happened late in their first year of marriage, and since then she's eaten to fill up the awful emptiness inside. Oh hearing this Johnny takes her in his arms and kisses her. It's the first affection he's shown her in ages. He's been showing more affection to Peg however and has not only met her father, but has offered to give Peg a key to his office.|$|R

This week {{we begin}} our star of the month festival for March — a thirty-six-film salute {{to one of the}} most underrated actresses of the Golden Age of Hollywood, the {{delightful}} Ann Sothern. Over the course of her sixty-year career, Ann Sothern found success on the stage, on radio, on film and, certainly, on television, becoming one of those faces which would, invariably, make an audience, en masse, kind of give it a happy sigh of relief, knowing well, now we're in good hands, I know I'm gonna have a good time. And with Ann Sothern, they always did. Still, I don't think the film industry ever really fully appreciated her abilities and rarely gave her a chance to stretch as an actress, something Ann lamented about later in her life. Early on, she spent time working all over Hollywood — at Warner Brothers, RKO, Twentieth Century Fox and things got particularly promising for her when she signed with the mighty MGM in 1939. But that didn't really pan out much either. She was so charming in whatever she was given to do, MGM put her in one film after another and never really upping the stakes by teaming with any of the big male stars on the MGM contract list, people like Tracy or Gable, Bob Taylor, Walter Pidgeon. But all that was still in the future when she made our next film, as a contract player at colo… Columbia Studios.|$|E

But I will note here that he was simultaneously patient, engaged, proactive, and – best of all – ruthlessly determined to refine and sculpt all our vague big-picture ideas into digestible and implementable concrete pieces. He also provided remarkable opportunities to see and do things that are rarely offered to graduate students. What I’m trying to say is, that conference in Hawaii was amazing. The odds of me making it through grad school without an advisor of Konstantin’s caliber were precisely zero, and it is exremely fortunate that my talent for screwing things up is exceeded only by his ability to fix them. The tales of my mind-bogglingly embarassing failures {{over the last few years}} would also double the length of this document, and I think I’ll leave them out of that autobiography as well.
