40|$|The {{present study}} aimed at further {{examining}} {{the effects of}} exposure to slim media models and light-products in commercials on food intake in relation to restrained eating. Food intake was measured in 124 female students while they watched a neutral or sad movie interrupted by either neutral commercials, or commercials with slim models and light-products. Afterwards, {{participants were asked to}} fill out questionnaires on restrained eating and the tendency to overeat. It appeared that high restrained eaters who were exposed <b>to</b> <b>commercials</b> with slim models and light-products ate much less compared to high restrained eaters who were exposed <b>to</b> neutral <b>commercials,</b> whereas unrestrained eaters who were exposed <b>to</b> <b>commercials</b> with slim models and light-products ate slightly more than when exposed <b>to</b> neutral <b>commercials.</b> This might suggest that restrained eaters who watch slim media models and light-products on television could be reminded of their diets...|$|R

40|$|This study {{experimentally}} {{tested the}} effects of exposure <b>to</b> television <b>commercials</b> using less thin models on mood, body focused anxiety and food intake, as compared to {{the effects of}} commercials using thin models. In a naturalistic setting, 110 young women were exposed to a neutral movie, interrupted by two commercial breaks. The commercial breaks contained real commercials using either less thin (n = 32) or thin models (n = 39), or neutral commercials (n = 39). During watching television, participants could freely eat snack food. Further, their mood and body focused anxiety was assessed. ANOVAs revealed no effects on body focused anxiety, but women reported a more negative mood and ate less after exposure <b>to</b> <b>commercials</b> using less thin models than after exposure <b>to</b> <b>commercials</b> using thin models. These results imply that using less thin models in <b>commercials</b> explicitly referring <b>to</b> the thin ideal does not make women feel better...|$|R

5|$|Among his {{publications}} were {{a series}} of articles about fish management, collected and reprinted as Salmon of the Pacific Coast in 1893. Despite his efforts to maintain a steady fish supply through egg-collecting and fish-rearing, salmon catches on the Rogue, rising in some years and falling in others, generally declined over time. Seventeen years after Hume's death in 1908, the state closed the river <b>to</b> <b>commercial</b> fishing.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{variations}} {{in the size of}} the yearly catch, Hume and others believed his methods of fish-propagation to be successful. However, as salmon runs declined over time despite the hatcheries, recreational fishing interests began to oppose large-scale operations. In 1910, a state referendum banned commercial fishing on the Rogue, but this decision was reversed in 1913. As fish runs continued to dwindle, the state legislature finally closed the river <b>to</b> <b>commercial</b> fishing in 1935.|$|E
