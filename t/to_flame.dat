5|$|Because sugars burn easily {{when exposed}} <b>to</b> <b>flame,</b> the {{handling}} of sugars risks dust explosion. The 2008 Georgia sugar refinery explosion, which killed 14 people and injured 40, and destroyed most of the refinery, {{was caused by the}} ignition of sugar dust. In its culinary use, sugar that is exposed to a heat source causes caramelization to take place. As the process occurs, volatile chemicals such as diacetyl are released, producing the characteristic caramel flavor.|$|E

5|$|Arfwedson later {{showed that}} this same element {{was present in}} the {{minerals}} spodumene and lepidolite. In 1818, Christian Gmelin {{was the first to}} observe that lithium salts give a bright red color <b>to</b> <b>flame.</b> However, both Arfwedson and Gmelin tried and failed to isolate the pure element from its salts. It was not isolated until 1821, when William Thomas Brande obtained it by electrolysis of lithium oxide, a process that had previously been employed by the chemist Sir Humphry Davy to isolate the alkali metals potassium and sodium. Brande also described some pure salts of lithium, such as the chloride, and, estimating that lithia (lithium oxide) contained about 55% metal, estimated the atomic weight of lithium to be around 9.8 g/mol (modern value ~6.94 g/mol). In 1855, larger quantities of lithium were produced through the electrolysis of lithium chloride by Robert Bunsen and Augustus Matthiessen. The discovery of this procedure led to commercial production of lithium in 1923 by the German company Metallgesellschaft AG, which performed an electrolysis of a liquid mixture of lithium chloride and potassium chloride.|$|E

25|$|When a thread—or in some cases, {{an entire}} forum—becomes unstable, {{the result is}} usually {{uncontrolled}} spam {{in the form of}} one-line complaints, image macros, or abuse of the report system. When the discussion becomes heated and sides do nothing more than complain and not accept each other's differences in point of view, the discussion degenerates into what is called a flame war. <b>To</b> <b>flame</b> someone means to go off-topic and attack the person rather than their opinion.

25|$|A {{rectifier}} used in high-voltage {{direct current}} (HVDC) power transmission systems and industrial processing between about 1909 to 1975 is a mercury-arc rectifier or mercury-arc valve. The device is enclosed in a bulbous glass vessel or large metal tub. One electrode, the cathode, is submerged {{in a pool}} of liquid mercury {{at the bottom of the}} vessel and one or more high purity graphite electrodes, called anodes, are suspended above the pool. There may be several auxiliary electrodes to aid in starting and maintaining the arc. When an electric arc is established between the cathode pool and suspended anodes, a stream of electrons flows from the cathode to the anodes through the ionized mercury, but not the other way (in principle, this is a higher-power counterpart <b>to</b> <b>flame</b> rectification, which uses the same one-way current transmission properties of the plasma naturally present in a flame).|$|E
25|$|In 165, Roman forces {{moved on}} Mesopotamia. Edessa was re-occupied, and Mannus, the king deposed by the Parthians, was re-installed. M 169.

A second force, under Avidius Cassius and the III Gallica, {{moved down the}} Euphrates, and fought a major battle at Dura. By {{the end of the}} year, Cassius' army had reached the twin metropolises of Mesopotamia: Seleucia on the right bank of the Tigris and Ctesiphon on the left.

25|$|The {{aircraft}} {{landed at}} Edinburgh Airport, Scotland, at midnight in snow conditions and was then parked heading directly into moderate to strong surface winds for approximately 17 hours. Because no protecting plugs were put inside the engine intakes, the wind drove {{a significant amount}} of snow into the intakes. The intake plugs were not carried as part of the aircraft's onboard equipment and they were not readily available at Edinburgh Airport. Information concerning freezing weather conditions in the aircraft manufacturer's maintenance manual had not been including in the airline's Short 360 Operations Manual and was therefore not complied with. The AAIB discovered that large volumes of snow or slush could have accumulated where {{it would not have been}} readily visible to the crew during a pre-flight inspection (the engine intakes on a Short 360 are about 2.8m (9ft) above the ground). On takeoff this snow changed the engine intake air flow, causing both engines <b>to</b> <b>flame</b> out after both engines' anti-ice vanes were simultaneously opened as per the standard operating procedure. It was noted by the investigators that selecting engine anti-ice 'on' sequentially with a time interval between would have prevented a simultaneous dual engine flameout.|$|E

Whatever the case, the sacking marks a particularly destructive chapter in Seleucia's long decline. During the sacking, Roman troops stole the statue of Apollo Comaeus from its temple and brought it back to Rome, where it was installed at {{the temple of the}} Palatine Apollo. This blasphemy may have been on Marcus' mind when he called a lectisternium, a great meal offered to the gods, {{at the beginning of the}} Marcomannic Wars (ca. 167) to ward off the evils then being visited on the state.|$|E
25|$|Enthused by {{the speech}} of Jathedar Tehal Singh, the entire Shaheedi Jatha {{followed}} him. By this time, another horseman messenger, Bhai Ram Singh, arrived. In vain did he too try to persuade Jathedar Tehal Singh and the Jatha to return. The Jatha soon entered Darshni Deohri of the Gurdwara and shut the main door from inside. While some of the devotees took their seats inside the Prakash Asthan, others sat on the platform and the Baran dari. Bhai Lachhman Singh Dharowali sat on Guru's tabia. Mahant Narayan Das came to know of the situation through the Jaikaras (victory slogans) of the Shaheedi Jatha. At first, he was utterly shocked thinking that {{the game was over}} but he soon recovered and ordered his mercenaries to kill everyone in the Jatha. They fired bullets at the Sangat in Gurdwara hall. Several bullets pierced through Sri Guru Granth Sahib. The hired gundas wielded swords, spears, hatchets and other lethal weapons to mercilessly slaughter the peaceful and unprovocative Sikhs within the very premises of the Gurdwara. The dead and dying Singhs were then dragged to a pile of logs which had been collected earlier and consigned <b>to</b> <b>flame.</b> By the time the police and local Sikhs came on the scene, all the dead men had been consumed by the fire. Bhai Lachhman Singh Dharowali who was wounded with a gunshot was tied to a Jand tree and burnt alive. It was a butchery at its worst form.|$|E
25|$|King Robert II died at Dundonald Castle in Ayrshire on 19 April 1390 and the chronicler Wyntoun informs that Robert was not {{buried at}} Scone until 13 August 1390, {{only a day}} before his son John, Earl of Carrick was crowned King as Robert III. Fife was {{retained}} as Guardian of Scotland probably much against Buchan's hopes as he must have looked at some sort of volte-face on some of Fife's actions, particularly as Buchan reached his zenith of possessions under Carrick. On top of this, Bishop Bur turned to Thomas Dunbar, Sheriff of Inverness and son of the Earl of Moray to provide his protection. The events of May and June 1390 in the Laich of Moray were perhaps {{the result of a}} combination of factors that presented themselves to Buchan. Firstly, John Dunbar, Earl of Moray and his fellow northern landowner Sir David Lindsay of Glenesk both absented themselves from Moray to attend a substantial tourney at Richard II of England's court. In addition, Bishop Bur's involvement with Buchan's estrangement with his wife and then Bur's alignment with Moray presented an opportunity for revenge culminating in the destruction of Forres in May and then Elgin with its cathedral in June. His destruction of the church possessions in Elgin was complete—as well as the cathedral, the monastery of the Greyfriars, St Giles parish church and the Hospital of Maison Dieu were all put <b>to</b> <b>flame.</b> Church and state now came together to oppose him—excommunicated by Bur, Buchan had to appear at the Church of the Friars Preacher, in Perth in the presence of his brothers, King Robert III of Scotland and the Earl of Fife, and the council-general to plead for forgiveness—absolution was granted by bishop Walter Trail, Bishop of St Andrews.|$|E

500|$|Another {{prototype}} {{equipped with}} RD-21 engines and a pressurized cockpit {{was completed in}} June 1947. It was known internally as the I-307 (izdeliye FR) and was given the service designation of MiG-9M. The armament was rearranged in another attempt to ameliorate the gun gas ingestion problem with the N-37 being mounted on the starboard side of the fuselage and the two NS-23s on the port side, well aft so that the gun barrels did not protrude beyond the air intake. This caused the cockpit to be moved forward slightly which gave the pilot a better view when landing. The number of fuel tanks was reduced to five, but the aircraft's total capacity remained the same. It made its first flight in July, but the factory flight tests were not completed until early 1948. Despite {{a top speed of}} [...] at , it failed its state acceptance tests. The reasons given were that the engines continued <b>to</b> <b>flame</b> out if they were run at low rpm at altitudes above , the mounts for the cannon were not fully developed and the workmanship of the pressurized cockpit was low. The real reason was that the aircraft was inferior to the MiG-15 already in flight testing.|$|E
500|$|On the {{way back}} to the ashram, Uttanka had tied the {{earrings}} in a deerskin. While travelling, he stopped and climbed a tree to pluck some fruit for his refreshment. He tied the deerskin to a branch, but the deerskin became untied and the earrings fell on the ground. A snake immediately got hold of the earrings and vanished into an ant-hill. In grief, Uttanka fell from the tree. For 35 days, he dug the ant-hill with a stick to get the snake out and retrieve the earrings. The earth began to shake due to the repeated strikes. At that time, Indra– riding his chariot– saw Uttanka's futile efforts. As in the Adi Parva, Indra used his Vajra to enable Uttanka to enter the beautiful Nagaloka. There, Uttanka saw a horse with the [...] "tail which had black and white hair, a copper-coloured muzzle, and eye of the same colour that seemed <b>to</b> <b>flame</b> forth in splendor". The horse told Uttanka to blow from behind, as in the Adi Parva version. The horse was the fire god Agni who was the guru of Gautama, who had offered his help to retrieve the earrings. When Uttanka followed the directive of the horse, flames and smoke emerged from every pore of the horse and choked the dwellings of the snakes. Thus choked, the serpents, headed by Vasuki came out, worshipped Uttanka and surrendered the earrings and asked that they be pardoned. When Uttanka returned to the hermitage of Gautama to give the earrings to Ahalya, he narrated the sequence of events that occurred in procuring the earrings.|$|E
500|$|Viewtiful Joe {{features}} unique gameplay {{elements in}} the form of Joe's [...] "Viewtiful Effects (VFX) Power", which is designed to emulate camera tricks seen in films. VFX Power is used in both battling enemies and solving various puzzles. These three powers are limited by the [...] "VFX Gauge" [...] located {{at the top of the}} screen. Normally, the meter is full, giving the player access to Joe's super powers via his Viewtiful Joe transformation. The meter slowly empties when an ability is in use. Once it depletes, Viewtiful Joe changes to normal Joe, lowering his attack and defense and leaving him temporarily devoid of VFX Power. The VFX Gauge automatically refills over time and can also be manually filled by picking up bottles of [...] "VFX Juice". The first VFX Power is [...] "Slow", which slows time, causing the player's attacks to be more powerful, increasing Joe's reflexes, and allowing him to dodge attacks more easily. The second VFX Power, [...] "Mach Speed", allows Joe to move at a faster speed, creating multiple after-images of him when he unleashes a flurry of attacks on all enemies on the screen. It can additionally cause his attacks to envelop Joe in a temporary heat shield, rendering him immune <b>to</b> <b>flame</b> attacks and setting enemies on fire when struck. The last VFX Power, [...] "Zoom In", causes a camera close-up of Joe, powering up his normal attacks, granting him a set of new attacks, and paralyzing all lesser foes in proximity to him. However, any damage dealt to Joe whilst zoomed in is increased too. Any two VFX Powers can be combined. The VFX Gauge can be extended by collecting a certain number of V-Films present in each stage. The bar reverts to its normal length when a new stage begins.|$|E
