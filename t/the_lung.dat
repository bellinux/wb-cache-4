5|$|Inflammatory {{conditions}} of <b>the</b> <b>lung</b> tissue are pneumonia, of the respiratory tract are bronchitis and bronchiolitis, {{and of the}} pleurae surrounding the lungs pleurisy. Inflammation is usually caused by infections due to bacteria or viruses. When <b>the</b> <b>lung</b> tissue is inflamed due to other causes it is called pneumonitis. One major cause of bacterial pneumonia is tuberculosis. Chronic infections often occur in those with immunodeficiency and can include a fungal infection by Aspergillus fumigatus {{that can lead to}} an aspergilloma forming in <b>the</b> <b>lung.</b>|$|E
5|$|Lung cancer, {{also known}} as lung carcinoma, is a {{malignant}} lung tumor characterized by uncontrolled cell growth in tissues of <b>the</b> <b>lung.</b> This growth can spread beyond <b>the</b> <b>lung</b> {{by the process of}} metastasis into nearby tissue or other parts of the body. Most cancers that start in <b>the</b> <b>lung,</b> known as primary lung cancers, are carcinomas. The two main types are small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) and non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). The most common symptoms are coughing (including coughing up blood), weight loss, shortness of breath, and chest pains.|$|E
5|$|Spontaneous {{subcutaneous}} emphysema {{is thought}} to result from increased pressures in <b>the</b> <b>lung</b> that cause alveoli to rupture. In spontaneous subcutaneous emphysema, air travels from the ruptured alveoli into the interstitium and along the blood vessels of <b>the</b> <b>lung,</b> into the mediastinum and from there into the tissues of the neck or head.|$|E
5000|$|The trachea and {{the first}} {{portions}} of the main bronchi are outside <b>the</b> <b>lungs.</b> <b>The</b> rest of the [...] "tree" [...] branches within <b>the</b> <b>lungs,</b> and ultimately extends to every part of <b>the</b> <b>lungs.</b>|$|R
5|$|In {{embryonic}} development, <b>the</b> <b>lungs</b> {{begin to}} develop as an outpouching of the foregut, a tube which goes on to form {{the upper part of}} the digestive system. When <b>the</b> <b>lungs</b> are formed <b>the</b> fetus is held in the fluid-filled amniotic sac and so they do not function to breathe. Blood is also diverted from <b>the</b> <b>lungs</b> through <b>the</b> ductus arteriosus. At birth however, air begins to pass through <b>the</b> <b>lungs,</b> and <b>the</b> diversionary duct closes, so that <b>the</b> <b>lungs</b> can begin to respire. <b>The</b> <b>lungs</b> only fully develop in early childhood.|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the reasons}} we can breathe is because of the {{elasticity}} of <b>the</b> <b>lungs.</b> <b>The</b> internal surface of <b>the</b> <b>lungs</b> on average in a non-emphysemic person is normally 63m2 and can hold about 5lts of air volume. [...] Both <b>lungs</b> together have <b>the</b> same amount of surface area as half of a tennis court. Disease such as, emphysema, tuberculosis, can reduce the amount of surface area and elasticity of <b>the</b> <b>lungs.</b> Another big factor in the elasticity of <b>the</b> <b>lungs</b> is smoking because of the residue left behind in <b>the</b> <b>lungs</b> from <b>the</b> smoking. The elasticity of <b>the</b> <b>lungs</b> can be trained to expand further.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>lung</b> is {{a common}} place for the spread of tumors {{from other parts of}} the body. Secondary cancers are {{classified}} by the site of origin; e.g., breast cancer that has spread to <b>the</b> <b>lung</b> is called metastatic breast cancer. Metastases often have a characteristic round appearance on chest radiograph.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>lung</b> is {{surrounded}} by a serous membrane of visceral pleura, which has an underlying layer of loose connective tissue attached to the substance of <b>the</b> <b>lung.</b>|$|E
5|$|The lungs possess several {{characteristics}} which {{protect against}} infection. <b>The</b> <b>lung</b> tract is lined by epithelia with hair-like projections called cilia that beat rhythmically and carry mucus. This mucociliary clearance {{is an important}} defence system against air-borne infection. The dust particles and bacteria in the inhaled air {{are caught in the}} mucosal surface of respiratory passages and are moved up towards the pharynx by the rhythmic upward beating action of the cilia. The lining of <b>the</b> <b>lung</b> also secretes immunoglobulin A which protects against respiratory infections; goblet cells secrete mucus which also contains several antimicrobial compounds such as defensins, antiproteases, and antioxidates. In addition, the lining of <b>the</b> <b>lung</b> also contains macrophages, immune cells which engulf and destroy debris and microbes that enter <b>the</b> <b>lung</b> in a process known as phagocytosis; and dendritic cells which present antigens to activate components of the adaptive immune system such as T-cells and B-cells.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>lungs</b> {{also serve}} a {{protective}} role. Several blood-borne substances, {{such as a}} few types of prostaglandins, leukotrienes, serotonin and bradykinin, are excreted through <b>the</b> <b>lungs.</b> Drugs and other substances can be absorbed, modified or excreted in <b>the</b> <b>lungs.</b> <b>The</b> <b>lungs</b> filter out small blood clots from veins and prevent them from entering arteries and causing strokes.|$|R
5000|$|Gastric {{distension}} {{is potentially}} dangerous since {{it can cause}} {{the contents of the}} stomach to come up the esophagus (gullet) and spill back down into <b>the</b> <b>lungs.</b> This can cause drowning, by filling <b>the</b> <b>lungs</b> with fluid, if there has been enough material in the stomach. With lesser material, gastric distension can cause stomach acids to damage <b>the</b> <b>lungs</b> and create a condition known as [...] "aspiration pneumonia". The other problem this causes is that the expanded stomach will push against <b>the</b> <b>lungs</b> decreasing <b>the</b> amount of air that can be placed into <b>the</b> <b>lungs.</b>|$|R
40|$|The static {{properties}} of <b>the</b> <b>lungs</b> have been explained by energy-change considerations on the elasticity, but this article explains the elasticity of <b>the</b> <b>lungs</b> by entropy-change considerations. Entropy {{of the individual}} lobule was defined by application of stochastic geometry on aggregated alveolar polyhedrons. Entropy of <b>the</b> <b>lungs</b> is <b>the</b> result of integrating a number of lobular entro-pies through the fractal bronchial tree. Entropy of <b>the</b> <b>lungs</b> was thus determined by the individual lobular entropy and the connectivity of the bronchial tree to the lobular bronchioles. Thermody-namic considerations on the static conditions of the pulmonary system composed of <b>the</b> <b>lungs</b> and <b>the</b> chest wall have provided a theoretical approach to understand <b>the</b> subdivisions of <b>lung</b> vo-lume as <b>the</b> entropy-change of <b>lungs.</b> Entropy-change considerations on the elasticity of <b>the</b> <b>lungs</b> have shown that alveolar collapse and subsequent alveolar induration as the primary pathway {{for the loss of}} elasticity in <b>the</b> <b>lungs</b> is an acceptable hypothesis...|$|R
5|$|A {{pneumothorax}} (collapsed lung) is {{an abnormal}} collection of {{air in the}} pleural space that causes an uncoupling of <b>the</b> <b>lung</b> from the chest wall. <b>The</b> <b>lung</b> cannot expand against the air pressure inside the pleural space. An easy to understand example is a traumatic pneumothorax, where air enters the pleural space from outside the body, as occurs with puncture to the chest wall. Similarly, a scuba diver ascending while holding their breath with their lungs fully inflated can cause air sacs (alveoli) to burst and leak high pressure air into the pleural space.|$|E
5|$|A {{pulmonary}} embolism is {{a blood clot}} that becomes lodged in the pulmonary arteries. The majority of emboli arise because of deep vein thrombosis in the legs. Pulmonary emboli may be investigated using a ventilation/perfusion scan, a CT scan of the arteries of <b>the</b> <b>lung,</b> or blood tests such as the D-dimer. Pulmonary hypertension describes an increased pressure {{at the beginning of}} the pulmonary artery that has a large number of differing causes. Other rarer conditions may also affect the blood supply of <b>the</b> <b>lung,</b> such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis, which causes inflammation of the small blood vessels of the lungs and kidneys.|$|E
5|$|At birth {{the lungs}} are very undeveloped with only around one sixth of the alveoli {{of the adult}} lung present. The alveoli {{continue}} to form into early adulthood, {{and their ability to}} form when necessary is seen in the regeneration of <b>the</b> <b>lung.</b> Alveolar septa have a double capillary network instead of the single network of the developed lung. Only after the maturation of the capillary network can <b>the</b> <b>lung</b> enter a normal phase of growth. Following the early growth in numbers of alveoli there is another stage of the alveoli being enlarged.|$|E
50|$|The helium {{dilution}} {{technique is}} the way of measuring the functional residual capacity of <b>the</b> <b>lungs</b> (<b>the</b> volume left in <b>the</b> <b>lungs</b> after normal expiration).|$|R
25|$|The person using <b>the</b> iron <b>lung</b> {{is placed}} {{into the central}} chamber, a {{cylindrical}} steel drum. An opening allowing {{the head and neck}} to remain outside is then sealed off, forming an air-tight compartment enclosing the rest of the person's body from the neck down. Pumps that control airflow periodically decrease and increase the air pressure within the chamber, and particularly, on the chest. When the pressure is below that within <b>the</b> <b>lungs,</b> <b>the</b> <b>lungs</b> expand and atmospheric pressure pushes air from outside the chamber in via the person's nose and airways to keep <b>the</b> <b>lungs</b> filled; when <b>the</b> pressure goes above that within <b>the</b> <b>lungs,</b> <b>the</b> reverse occurs, and air is expelled. In this manner, <b>the</b> iron <b>lung</b> mimics <b>the</b> physiological action of breathing: by periodically altering intrathoracic pressure, it causes air to flow in and out of <b>the</b> <b>lungs.</b> <b>The</b> iron <b>lung</b> is a form of non-invasive therapy.|$|R
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>lungs</b> {{expand and}} {{contract}} during the breathing cycle, drawing air {{in and out of}} <b>the</b> <b>lungs.</b> <b>The</b> volume of air moved in or out of <b>the</b> <b>lungs</b> under normal resting circumstances (the resting tidal volume of about 500ml), and volumes moved during maximally forced inhalation and maximally forced exhalation are measured in humans by spirometry. A typical adult human spirogram with the names given to the various excursions in volume <b>the</b> <b>lungs</b> can undergo is illustrated below (Fig.3): ...|$|R
5|$|Chest {{tubes are}} {{required}} in PSPs {{that have not}} responded to needle aspiration, in large SSPs (>50%), and in cases of tension pneumothorax. They are connected to a one-way valve system that allows air to escape, but not to re-enter, the chest. This may include a bottle with water that functions like a water seal, or a Heimlich valve. They are not normally connected to a negative pressure circuit, as this would result in rapid re-expansion of <b>the</b> <b>lung</b> and a risk of pulmonary edema ("re-expansion pulmonary edema"). The tube is left in place until no air is seen to escape from it {{for a period of}} time, and X-rays confirm re-expansion of <b>the</b> <b>lung.</b>|$|E
5|$|Low oxygen levels lead to hypoxic {{pulmonary}} vasoconstriction, the {{tightening of}} small {{blood vessels in}} <b>the</b> <b>lung</b> to create an optimal distribution of blood through <b>the</b> <b>lung.</b> Persistently low oxygen levels causing chronic vasoconstriction leads to increased pressure on the pulmonary artery (pulmonary hypertension), which in turn puts strain on the right ventricle, {{the part of the}} heart that pumps blood to the lungs. The right ventricle undergoes remodeling, becomes distended and is less able to remove blood from the veins. When this is the case, raised hydrostatic pressure leads to accumulation of fluid in the skin (edema), and in more severe cases the liver and the abdominal cavity.|$|E
5|$|Pleurodesis is a {{procedure}} that permanently eliminates the pleural space and attaches <b>the</b> <b>lung</b> to the chest wall. No long-term study (20 years or more) has been performed on its consequences. Good results {{in the short term}} are achieved with a thoracotomy (surgical opening of the chest) with identification of any source of air leakage and stapling of blebs followed by pleurectomy (stripping of the pleural lining) of the outer pleural layer and pleural abrasion (scraping of the pleura) of the inner layer. During the healing process, <b>the</b> <b>lung</b> adheres to the chest wall, effectively obliterating the pleural space. Recurrence rates are approximately 1%. Post-thoracotomy pain is relatively common.|$|E
50|$|In normal breathing, the {{diaphragm}} contracts, causing <b>the</b> <b>lungs</b> above it to expand. This expansion draws air into <b>the</b> <b>lungs</b> by generating a negative pressure or vacuum. Air first travels through the rigid larynx and upper airways before filling the inflatable alveoli in <b>the</b> <b>lungs.</b>|$|R

5|$|Pneumonia is an {{inflammatory}} condition of <b>the</b> <b>lung</b> affecting primarily the small air sacs known as alveoli. Typically symptoms include {{some combination of}} productive or dry cough, chest pain, fever, and trouble breathing. Severity is variable.|$|E
5|$|Some {{types of}} chronic lung {{diseases}} {{are classified as}} restrictive lung disease, because of a restriction {{in the amount of}} lung tissue involved in respiration. These include pulmonary fibrosis which can occur when <b>the</b> <b>lung</b> is inflamed {{for a long period of}} time. Fibrosis in <b>the</b> <b>lung</b> replaces functioning lung tissue with fibrous connective tissue. This can be due to a large variety of occupational diseases such as Coalworker's pneumoconiosis, autoimmune diseases or more rarely to a reaction to medication.|$|E
5|$|Stage III: Advanced {{symptoms}} {{which may}} include unexplained chronic diarrhea {{for longer than}} a month, severe bacterial infections including tuberculosis of <b>the</b> <b>lung,</b> and a CD4 count of less than 350/µl.|$|E

50|$|Most extant {{lungfish}} {{species have}} two <b>lungs,</b> with <b>the</b> {{exception of the}} Australian lungfish, which only has one. <b>The</b> <b>lungs</b> of lungfish are homologous to <b>the</b> <b>lungs</b> of tetrapods. As in tetrapods and bichirs, <b>the</b> <b>lungs</b> extend from <b>the</b> ventral surface of the esophagus and gut.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>lungs</b> are {{expanded}} {{with the}} help of the diaphragm, a muscular sheet of tissue which contracts away from the thoracic cavity, thereby decreasing the pressure and pulling air into <b>the</b> <b>lungs.</b> When fully expanded, <b>the</b> <b>lungs</b> can reach to the 16th rib of the horse.|$|R
5|$|The {{accumulated}} {{volume is}} calculated {{as a function}} of time by integrating over the product of the bubble number and the degree of supersaturation, and subtracting the free gas that is being dissipated continuously by <b>the</b> <b>lung.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{arterial}} bubble assumption {{can introduce}} {{variability in the}} decompression outcome through <b>the</b> <b>lung</b> function. The first variable is individual susceptibility. The filtering capacity of <b>the</b> <b>lung</b> may be assumed to vary between individuals, and for a given individual, from day to day, and {{may account for the}} inter-personal and intra-persona variability which have been observed in DCS susceptibility. Basically, a good diver is a good bubble filter. This is a justification for divers who seek top physical fitness for severe decompression exposures.|$|E
5|$|The {{arterial}} bubble {{assumption is}} that the filtering capacity of <b>the</b> <b>lung</b> has a threshold radius {{of the size of}} a red blood cell and that sufficiently small decompression bubbles can pass to the arterial side, especially during the initial phase of ascent. Later in the ascent, bubbles grow to a larger size and remain trapped in <b>the</b> <b>lung.</b> This may explain why conventional Doppler measurements have not detected any bubbles in the arterial circulation.|$|E
40|$|Although {{neutrophils}} {{have been}} identified as sources of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, little is known about their immunologic function during mycobacterial infection in <b>the</b> <b>lungs.</b> In this study, we examined the growth of Mycobacterium bovis BCG in <b>the</b> <b>lungs</b> under experimental conditions that altered neutrophil recruitment to <b>the</b> <b>lungs.</b> Depletion and recruitment of neutrophils was associated with respective increases and decreases in M. bovis BCG growth. Thus, neutrophils may enhance mycobacteriocidal immunity in <b>the</b> <b>lungs...</b>|$|R
40|$|Problem statement: Dihydroartemisinin {{was shown}} to produce two types of {{inhibitory}} effects on the cardiac muscles of rats. It was also shown to stimulate haemopoiesis in <b>the</b> <b>lungs,</b> liver, spleen, intestine and kidney of rats. This study attempted {{to find out the}} nature of the effect of oral dihydroartemisinin on <b>the</b> <b>lungs</b> of Wistar albino rats. Approach: The effects of dihydroartemisinin on the tissues of <b>the</b> <b>lungs</b> of wistar albino rats were investigated with five doses of Dihydroartemisinin (DHA) administered for 5 days by oral intubation. The five tested doses were 1 mg kg - 1, a repeated dose of 1, 2, 60 and 80 mg kg - 1 DHA. Results: Histopathological examination of the tissue micrographs of <b>the</b> <b>lungs</b> of <b>the</b> dihydroartemisinin treated rats showed that in comparism with those of the controls, DHA had no adverse effects on the tissues of <b>the</b> <b>lungs</b> of <b>the</b> rats but rather produced a direct stimulatory effect on the smooth muscles of <b>the</b> <b>lungs.</b> This stimulation caused hyperplasia of these tissues which was observable histologically in tissue micrographs of <b>the</b> <b>lungs.</b> These effects of dihydroartemisinin on the tissues of <b>the</b> <b>lungs</b> of Wistar albino rats were dose, repetition and time dependent. Conclusion: These growth hormone-like stimulatory effects of dihydroartemisinin on the smooth muscles of <b>the</b> <b>lungs</b> suggest that DHA enhanced the functioning capacity of <b>the</b> <b>lungs</b> of <b>the</b> DHA-treated rats. These results suggest that dihydroartemisinin has possible respiration enhancement effects...|$|R
