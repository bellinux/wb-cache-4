Progressive presses hold all the dies needed, plus a powder measure and a primer feed, and often also include an additional station where the powder levels are checked, to prevent over or under charges. Progressive presses also often feature case feeds <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>hold</b> hundreds of cases to be loaded, and all the user {{has to do is}} hold the bullet in place over the appropriate case mouth, and pull the lever.|$|E
25|$|Combat {{is governed}} by a life points system. Every {{combatant}} has a maximum capacity of life points, and dies when their health is depleted to 0. Lost life points can be recovered by consuming certain food or drinks, or casting abilities. Players who die reappear at a respawn point of their choice with their life and skill points restored; however, they drop all but three chosen items, as well as certain common items. Dying spawns a gravestone <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>hold</b> all of the player's items and will last for an allotted time; however, there are situations in which all items will be lost upon death. If the player does not return in time, the grave will collapse and their items will disappear.|$|E

25|$|After {{starting}} 55 minutes late, representative Didagen Dilangalen {{questioned the}} authenticity of the automated elections and opposed moves to open the ballot boxes containing machine-generated COCs. Enrile sought a compromise by proposing the creation of a technical working group <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>hold</b> a separate inquiry in the legitimacy of the automated election results. Dilangalen left the plenary after Zubiri made the motion to open the COCs from overseas absentee voting (OAV). After and six hours of joint session, canvassing for manually counted COCs were begun with OAVs from Laos being the first COC canvassed. Aquino and Roxas led after the first day that the COCs were canvassed. COCs from Guam, Brunei, Papua New Guinea and Thailand were the other COCs canvassed before Congress adjourned for the day.|$|E
25|$|Early scuba divers dived {{without a}} {{buoyancy}} aid. In an emergency {{they had to}} jettison their weights. In the 1960s adjustable buoyancy life jackets (ABLJ) became available, {{which can be used}} to compensate for loss of buoyancy at depth due to compression of the neoprene wetsuit and as a lifejacket <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>hold</b> an unconscious diver face-upwards at the surface, and that can be quickly inflated. The first versions were inflated from a small disposable carbon dioxide cylinder, later with a small direct coupled air cylinder. A low-pressure feed from the regulator first-stage to an inflation/deflation valve unit lets the volume of the ABLJ be controlled as a buoyancy aid. In 1971 the stabilizer jacket was introduced by ScubaPro. This class of buoyancy aid is known as a buoyancy control device or buoyancy compensator.|$|E
2500|$|Corrective lenses can be {{produced}} in many different shapes from a circular lens called a lens blank. [...] Lens blanks are cut to fit {{the shape of the}} frame <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>hold</b> them. [...] Frame styles vary and fashion trends change over time, resulting in a multitude of lens shapes. [...] For lower power lenses, there are few restrictions which allows for many trendy and fashionable shapes. [...] Higher power lenses can cause distortion of peripheral vision and may become thick and heavy if a large lens shape is used. [...] However, if the lens becomes too small, the field of view can be drastically reduced.|$|E

2500|$|Paz {{released}} his second studio album, God of the Serengeti, on October 22, 2012. This effort followed up 2010's Season of the Assassin. Nick Demolina (writer of XXL (magazine)), said [...] "While Paz's raspy flow and violent imagery are generally coherent and amusing enough, {{there are a}} few head-scratchers sprinkled throughout. Such as, [...] "I don't believe in crying at all/I'm a manic depressive—never get excited at all," [...] and, [...] "The bible is gone/you are watching a Viking perform," [...] on [...] "Cheesesteaks." [...] While God of the Serengeti doesn't blaze any new ground, it is a release <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>hold</b> up to the Paz's legacy on the underground scene and will surely satisfy long-time fans." ...|$|E
2500|$|Early scuba divers dived {{without any}} {{buoyancy}} aid. In emergency {{they had to}} jettison their weights. In the 1960s adjustable buoyancy life jackets (ABLJ) became available. One early make, since 1961, was Fenzy. The ABLJ is used for two purposes: to adjust the buoyancy of the diver to compensate for loss of buoyancy at depth, mainly due to compression of the neoprene wetsuit) and more importantly as a lifejacket <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>hold</b> an unconscious diver face-upwards at the surface, {{and that can be}} quickly inflated. It was put on before putting on the cylinder harness. The first versions were inflated with a small carbon dioxide cylinder, later with a small direct coupled air cylinder. An extra low-pressure feed from the regulator first-stage lets the lifejacket be controlled as a buoyancy aid. This invention in 1971 of the [...] "direct system," [...] by ScubaPro, resulted in what was called a stabilizer jacket or stab jacket, and is now increasingly known as a buoyancy compensator (device), or simply [...] "BCD".|$|E

There are four basic Nen techniques; [...] maintains the aura in the body, strengthening it for defense, [...] shuts the aura flow off, useful for concealing one's presence and relieving fatigue, [...] enables a user to produce more Nen, and [...] is a person's specific use of Nen. Nen users are classified into six types based on their Hatsu abilities; [...] strengthen and reinforce their natural physical abilities, [...] project aura out of their bodies, [...] control objects or living things, [...] change the type or properties of their aura, [...] create objects out of their aura, and [...] have unique abilities that do not fall into the previous categories. A Nen user can enter into a [...] whereby pledging to follow certain , their abilities are strengthened in relation to how strict they are.

2500|$|In {{their earlier}} appeals, {{the defense was}} limited to the trial record. The Governor's Committee, however, was not a {{judicial}} proceeding, so Judge Thayer's comments outside the courtroom could be used to demonstrate his bias. Once Thayer told reporters that [...] "No long-haired anarchist from California can run this court!" [...] According to the affidavits of eyewitnesses, Thayer also lectured members of his clubs, calling Sacco and Vanzetti [...] "Bolsheviki!" [...] and saying he would [...] "get them good and proper". During the Dedham trial's first week, Thayer said to reporters: [...] "Did you ever see a case in which so many leaflets and circulars have been spread...saying people couldn't get a fair trial in Massachusetts? You wait till I give my charge to the jury, I'll show them!" [...] In 1924, Thayer confronted a Massachusetts lawyer at Dartmouth, his alma mater, and said: [...] "Did you see what I did with those anarchistic bastards the other day. I guess <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>hold</b> them for a while.... Let them go to the Supreme Court now and see what they can get out of them." [...] The Committee knew that, following the verdict, Boston Globe reporter Frank Sibley, who had covered the trial, wrote a protest to the Massachusetts attorney general condemning Thayer's blatant bias. Thayer's behavior both inside the courtroom and outside of it had become a public issue, with the New York World attacking Thayer as [...] "an agitated little man looking for publicity and utterly impervious to the ethical standards one has the right to expect of a man presiding in a capital case." ...|$|E
