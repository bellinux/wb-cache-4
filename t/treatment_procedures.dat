25|$|Loco-regional therapy (also {{referred}} to as liver-directed therapy) refers {{to any one of}} several minimally-invasive treatment techniques to focally target HCC within the liver. These procedures are alternatives to surgery, and may be considered in combination with other strategies, such as a later liver transplantation. Generally, these <b>treatment</b> <b>procedures</b> are performed by interventional radiologists or surgeons, in coordination with a medical oncologist. Loco-regional therapy may refer to either percutaneous therapies, such as microwave or cryoablation, or arterial catheter-based therapies, such as chemoembolization and radioembolization.|$|E

25|$|Most {{children}} with a form of clefting are monitored by a cleft palate team or craniofacial team through young adulthood. Care can be lifelong. <b>Treatment</b> <b>procedures</b> can vary between craniofacial teams. For example, some teams wait on jaw correction until the child is aged 10 to 12 (argument: growth is less influential as deciduous teeth are replaced by permanent teeth, thus saving the child from repeated corrective surgeries), while other teams correct the jaw earlier (argument: less speech therapy is needed than at a later age when speech therapy becomes harder). Within teams, treatment can differ between individual cases {{depending on the type}} and severity of the cleft.|$|E
25|$|Iodine-131 (131I) is an {{important}} radioisotope of iodine discovered by Glenn Seaborg and John Livingood in 1938 at the University of California, Berkeley. It has a radioactive decay half-life of about eight days. It is associated with nuclear energy, medical diagnostic and <b>treatment</b> <b>procedures,</b> and natural gas production. It also {{plays a major role}} as a radioactive isotope present in nuclear fission products, and was a significant contributor to the health hazards from open-air atomic bomb testing in the 1950s, and from the Chernobyl disaster, as well as being a large fraction of the contamination hazard in the first weeks in the Fukushima nuclear crisis. This is because I-131 is a major fission product of uranium and plutonium, comprising nearly 3% of the total products of fission (by weight). See fission product yield for a comparison with other radioactive fission products. I-131 is also a major fission product of uranium-233, produced from thorium.|$|E
2500|$|The {{declaration}} of Christianity as an accepted {{religion in the}} Roman Empire drove {{an expansion of the}} provision of care. Following the First Council of Nicaea in A.D. 325 construction of a hospital in every cathedral town was begun. Among the earliest were those built by the physician Saint Sampson in Constantinople and by Basil, bishop of Caesarea in modern-day Turkey. Called the [...] "Basilias", the latter resembled a city and included housing for doctors and nurses and separate buildings for various classes of patients. There was a separate section for lepers. Some hospitals maintained libraries and training programmes, and doctors compiled their medical and pharmacological studies in manuscripts. Thus in-patient medical care in the sense of what we today consider a hospital, was an invention driven by Christian mercy and Byzantine innovation. Byzantine hospital staff included the Chief Physician (archiatroi), professional nurses (hypourgoi) and the orderlies (hyperetai). By the twelfth century, Constantinople had two well-organised hospitals, staffed by doctors who were both male and female. Facilities included systematic <b>treatment</b> <b>procedures</b> and specialised wards for various diseases.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: Little {{is known}} about the {{information}} newly diagnosed patients with lung cancer recall and how satisfied they are with physicians' communication. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventy-one consecutive patients with newly diagnosed lung cancer were surveyed 1 to 3 days after the disclosure of diagnosis. Patients' recall of the given information was assessed, as well as their satisfaction with physicians' communication of diagnosis, <b>treatment</b> <b>procedure,</b> and goal of treatment as curative or palliative. Physicians who provided diagnosis were asked to complete a questionnaire concerning what information they had given to the patient. Congruence between physician information and patient recall of that information was then evaluated. RESULTS: Ninety percent (62 of 69 patients) correctly recalled their physician's information about the diagnosis, 83 % (55 of 66 patients) knew what <b>treatment</b> <b>procedure</b> their physicians proposed, and 49 % (32 of 65 patients) accurately recalled information about the goal of treatment. Seventy-six and 73 % of patients were highly satisfied with their physician's communication of diagnosis and <b>treatment</b> <b>procedure,</b> respectively. Only 39 % were highly satisfied with communication of the treatment goal. Patients who correctly recalled information regarding the <b>treatment</b> <b>procedure</b> were significantly more satisfied with its communication. CONCLUSION: Recall of information about the intent of treatment is poor, and satisfaction with communication of the intent of treatment is lacking among newly diagnosed patients with lung cancer. Future studies should address whether specific interventions can improve these deficiencies...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} a {{graduated}} prompting <b>treatment</b> <b>procedure</b> were analyzed in three phases of an experiment on the training and generalization of reaching-grasp responding in 2 - to 4 -year-old blind, severely or profoundly retarded children. In Phase 1, we used a multiple-baseline across-subjects design to investigate {{the effectiveness of the}} treatment on midline reach-grasp responding. In Phase 2, we used a reversal design to investigate the effects of repeated implementations and withdrawals of the treatment. In both phases, generalization to right and left positions was measured. In Phase 3, in a multiple-baseline across-responses design, the treatment was implemented in right and left positions. Also in Phase 3, shift of stimulus control from toy-sound to verbal instructions was measured. The results showed that the graduated prompting procedure was effective in training reach-grasp responding in all three children; for one child, the effects were durable over repeated applications of the <b>treatment</b> <b>procedure,</b> but were not maintained during withdrawals; for another child, the <b>treatment</b> <b>procedure</b> was effective in teaching reach-grasp responding in all three positions; and for the same child, training of reach-grasp responding generalized to toys presented without sound, given only the verbal instruction...|$|R

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of cerebral electrotherapy in relieving {{the symptoms of}} anxiety neurosis was investigated in ten subjects with this condition. A blind cross-over experimental design, in which subjects received five consecutive days of active and five days of placebo treatment was employed, the order being counterbalanced. The subjects' experience of cutaneous sensation was identical for both treatment conditions. Anxiety levels were measured pre- and post-treatment using daily physiological and psychological measures. Weekly psychological measures, {{some of which were}} double-blind, were also obtained before and after each type of treatment as well as on one-week and one-month follow-up days. The results showed a statistically significant overall treatment effect, but no differences between active and placebo treatment. There was a post hoc finding of a significant correlation between response to the overall <b>treatment</b> <b>procedure</b> and high levels of extraversion as measured by the Eysenck Personality Inventory (EPI). The implications of these findings are that the therapeutic effectiveness of CET is attributable to the non-specific or placebo components of the <b>treatment</b> <b>procedure</b> and not to the direct effect of the electrical current on the brain. Furthermore, the personality dimensions of the EPI may be useful in predicting the degree of response to non-specific components inherent in the CET <b>treatment</b> <b>procedure...</b>|$|R
