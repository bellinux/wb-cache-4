5|$|Frank McNamara made a bed {{of leaves}} for <b>the</b> <b>survivor</b> and built a fire to help keep him as warm and {{comfortable}} as possible. McNamara stayed with <b>the</b> <b>survivor</b> while Inkpen went to summon help. After several hours, ambulance crews arrived and administered first-aid and morphia. Rescue workers constructed a stretcher using saplings, bandages and overcoats. They covered <b>the</b> <b>survivor</b> with an overcoat and carried him for two hours to cover about two miles through thickly wooded country to McNamara's utility truck, which then carried him and his rescuers to a waiting ambulance.|$|E
5|$|The {{house of}} one of the farmworkers was at the crash site. He first ran to his house, where he found that his wife had survived and was safe. Richards rescued one man from the {{wreckage}} and put him by an apple tree. Another survivor was on fire. In a contemporary inverview one of the rescuers says <b>the</b> <b>survivor</b> came running across the farmyard. 60 years later Richards said he rescued <b>the</b> <b>survivor</b> from the aircraft. Accounts agree that rescuers put <b>the</b> <b>survivor</b> in a horse trough to extinguish the flames and cool his burns.|$|E
5|$|After Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Beyoncé and Rowland founded <b>the</b> <b>Survivor</b> Foundation {{to provide}} {{transitional}} housing for {{victims in the}} Houston area, to which Beyoncé contributed an initial $250,000. The foundation has since expanded {{to work with other}} charities in the city, and also provided relief following Hurricane Ike three years later.|$|E
5000|$|Once {{they reach}} <b>the</b> <b>survivors</b> and hot wire the ambulance, the Doctor with <b>the</b> <b>survivors</b> knocks out Rebecca, yelling that she isn't Dr. Chase. <b>The</b> <b>survivors</b> escape, causing Wheeler and Rebecca to hot wire a {{different}} ambulance.|$|R
50|$|The Gear {{would be}} {{carried in the}} weapons bay of the {{aircraft}} and dropped {{in a long line}} up-wind of <b>the</b> <b>survivors.</b> <b>The</b> Dinghy would inflate on impact and then drift towards <b>the</b> <b>survivors.</b> <b>The</b> <b>survivors</b> could then use the dinghy, haul in the containers of equipment, and await rescue.|$|R
50|$|One morning, <b>the</b> <b>survivors</b> {{wake up to}} {{discover}} their critically injured crewmate dead. <b>The</b> <b>survivors</b> realize there is a killer hiding among them on the lifepod.

5|$|As {{one of the}} few routes into hilly central Westchester, {{the river}} and its {{associated}} roads saw frequent skirmishes. In November 1777, three young men with Patriot sympathies were walking near the river crossing on the Dobbs Ferry Road (now Ashford Avenue) when they came upon a group of horsemen affiliated with Kipp's Regiment, one of the county's most-feared Loyalist militias. The young men taunted their rivals, who beat them so severely that two later died. <b>The</b> <b>survivor</b> was awarded a pension, {{believed to be the first}} in U.S. history, by the Continental Congress.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> Behar <b>survivors</b> were maltreated {{by members}} of Tones crew. Japanese sailors forced <b>the</b> <b>survivors</b> to hand over all their {{personal}} belongings of any value, and then used ropes to tie <b>the</b> <b>survivors</b> in painful positions which caused them to have difficultly breathing. The merchant ship's chief officer was beaten after he complained that treating civilians {{in such a way}} violated the Geneva Convention. However, <b>the</b> female <b>survivors</b> later had their ropes removed. When <b>the</b> <b>survivors</b> were taken below decks to be imprisoned they were badly beaten by Japanese sailors.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>survivors</b> were {{relocated}} to {{the towns of}} Guayabal and Lérida where they received housing and money, though little was done in aiding <b>the</b> <b>survivors</b> in reconstructing their lives.|$|R
50|$|Most of <b>the</b> <b>survivors</b> who {{crawled out}} of the {{wreckage}} of Flight 222 sought refuge in nearby houses. Most residents in Xixi Village offered their assistance to <b>the</b> <b>survivors,</b> some of them treated their injuries. Some of <b>the</b> <b>survivors</b> had cut wounds and burn injuries. 10 of the 58 people on board Flight 222 survived. Five {{people on the ground}} were injured.|$|R

He then lost the Intercontinental title to Ric Flair at Unforgiven. Towards the end of 2005, Carlito {{was involved in a}} brand rivalry which led to him discontinuing Carlito's Cabana. The angle concluded with Carlito wrestling for Team Raw against Team SmackDown! in a ten-man tag team match at <b>the</b> <b>Survivor</b> Series.|$|E
5|$|Samus {{returns to}} the {{research}} center, where she finds a body of James Pierce and a mummified remains of Ridley. She also discovers <b>the</b> <b>survivor,</b> and defeats a Queen Metroid. Samus pursues <b>the</b> <b>survivor,</b> who reveals herself {{to be the real}} Madeline. Madeline explains that the woman Samus met earlier was MB, an android created to establish a relationship with the Metroids. Betrayed by scientists and Madeline, MB telepathically commanded the Space Pirate special forces to attack those on board. Samus and Madeline are confronted by MB; as a group of Federation troopers rushes into the room, MB summons the Bottle Ship's most dangerous creatures to attack everyone. Madeline stops MB, who is then destroyed by Federation troopers. The colonel compliments Samus's efforts but orders a trooper to escort Samus back to her ship; a trooper complies and reveals himself as Anthony, the only surviving member of the 07th Platoon. Samus, Madeline and Anthony leave for the Galactic Federation headquarters in Samus's gunship. Days after the incident, Samus {{returns to the}} Bottle Ship, now marked for destruction by the Galactic Federation, to retrieve something that is left there. After battling Phantoon, a monster Samus had also fought on Zebes, she arrives at the control center and recovers Adam's platoon helmet. The Bottle Ship's self-destruct sequence is remotely activated, which an armorless Samus escapes with Adam's helmet.|$|E

5000|$|The year 2079 AD saw the {{realisation}} of Mankind's ultimate nightmare: {{an all-out}} nuclear war exterminates {{a quarter of the}} world's population almost instantly. Infrastructure collapses as mutagenic viruses infect humans and animals alike. Most of <b>the</b> <b>survivors</b> of <b>the</b> attack (aptly named <b>the</b> <b>Survivors)</b> live underground. Those who don't are mutated by the viruses and nuclear fallout (what they call the Evolved). 2141 sees the underground dwellers breaking through to the surface, after living underground for decades. Soon enough, the [...] "Evolved" [...] and [...] "Survivors" [...] meet. The Evolved and <b>the</b> <b>Survivors</b> do battle until <b>the</b> <b>Survivors</b> are surrounded at their underground HQ. The battle ends in a stalemate and both the Evolved and <b>the</b> <b>Survivors</b> retreat to recoup their losses for the next 40 years.|$|R
25|$|The French took <b>the</b> <b>survivors</b> prisoner, but {{apparently}} more {{to provide housing}} than actual incarceration. Shortly thereafter, the French repatriated <b>the</b> <b>survivors,</b> requesting <b>the</b> English to release {{an equal number of}} French prisoners.|$|R
5|$|The WWE Hall of Fame is a {{hall of fame}} for {{professional}} wrestling personalities maintained by WWE. It was announced on the March 22, 1993 episode of Monday Night Raw where André the Giant, who had died nearly two months prior, was announced as the sole inductee. The 1994 and 1995 ceremonies were held {{in conjunction with the}} annual King of the Ring pay-per-view events. In 1996, the ceremony was held with <b>the</b> <b>Survivor</b> Series event, {{for the first time in}} front of a paying audience as well as the wrestlers, after which, the Hall of Fame went on hiatus.|$|E
5|$|The heist is {{completed}} successfully, but Franklin is then approached separately by Steve and Dave, who contend that Trevor is a liability, and Devin, who wants retribution for Michael's betrayal. Franklin has three choices: kill Trevor, kill Michael, or attempt to save both in a suicide mission. Should Franklin choose to kill either Michael or Trevor, he ceases contact with <b>the</b> <b>survivor</b> {{and returns to}} his old life. Otherwise, the trio withstand an onslaught from the FIB and Merryweather before going on to kill Steve, Stretch, Wei, and Devin. Michael and Trevor reconcile, and the three cease working together but remain friends.|$|E
5|$|The {{next step}} was to take an oral {{examination}} and to diagnose a patient. After less than two weeks, he took his degree and became a doctor, at the age of 28. During the summer, Linnaeus met a friend from Uppsala, Peter Artedi. Before their departure from Uppsala, Artedi and Linnaeus had decided should one of them die, <b>the</b> <b>survivor</b> would finish the other's work. Ten weeks later, Artedi drowned in one of the canals of Amsterdam, and his unfinished manuscript on the classification of fish was left to Linnaeus to complete.|$|E
50|$|A B-17 Flying Fortress search {{aircraft}} dropped {{life rafts}} to <b>the</b> struggling <b>survivors,</b> who eventually {{made it to}} shore.

2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>survivors,</b> who lay injured on the beach, {{were found}} by local Chinese {{fishermen}} who brandished axes and knives. After salvaging {{bits and pieces}} from the wreckage, the fishermen then took <b>the</b> <b>survivors</b> to Peihou Island followed by Makung, where they were looked after by the locals. They were then {{picked up by the}} Douglas Steamer Thales, who transferred <b>the</b> <b>survivors</b> to [...] which was heading to Hong Kong.|$|R
2500|$|On the 18th, {{after the}} boat {{had been at}} sea for 64 hours, <b>the</b> <b>survivors</b> {{encountered}} , Petrie, master, which took all 39 crew and passengers aboard.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>survivor</b> was Edgar Forwood, 67-year-old Managing-Director of Forwood Down and Company Ltd., a South Australian {{engineering}} company. He was {{the oldest}} person on board the flight, and probably the most experienced air traveller. He was interviewed by police in hospital in Perth, but {{was not aware of}} much detail about the final minutes of the flight. He said {{there was no sign of}} fire prior to the crash and no announcement to passengers to fasten their seat belts.

5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, Vince McMahon's World Wrestling Federation (WWF)'s main {{competition}} in the professional wrestling industry was from Jim Crockett Promotions. McMahon countered Jim Crockett's successful Starrcade pay-per-view, which began airing in 1983, by creating the WrestleMania franchise. After WrestleMania III in March 1987, the most successful professional wrestling pay-per-view event in history, McMahon created <b>the</b> <b>Survivor</b> Series franchise, which aired {{the same day as}} Starrcade 1987 in November 1987. After defeating Crockett in the ratings war, McMahon created the Royal Rumble, an event airing for free on the USA Network in January 1988. The event set a ratings record for the network with eight million households tuning in to watch the event. In retaliation, Crockett created the Clash of the Champions event, which aired simultaneously with WrestleMania IV. WrestleMania IV garnered higher ratings, and not long after, Crockett filed for bankruptcy and sold his company to Ted Turner, who renamed it World Championship Wrestling (WCW).|$|E
5|$|Knowles {{teamed with}} America's Second Harvest and Pastor Rudy Rasmus of St. John United Methodist Church for a pre-concert food {{donation}} drive which {{was part of}} The Beyoncé Experience at every stop. Food was collected for people who fought with famine. Knowles' organization <b>The</b> <b>Survivor</b> Foundation was also involved in the campaign. The first 1,000 fans who would drop off a minimum of three non-perishable food items would receive an autographed photo of Knowles and a raffle ticket for a chance to have an upgraded seat. For the food drive in Ethiopia, India and Turkey, Houston Chronicle collaborated with Knowles, creating a Virtual Aid Drive and asking people to send money to them. The funds were donated to the Global FoodBanking Network.|$|E
50|$|Mowen finally {{agrees to}} take <b>the</b> <b>survivors</b> to <b>the</b> prison. After <b>the</b> <b>survivors</b> {{complete}} <b>the</b> preparations he and Jin request, they hurry {{back to the}} lab when The Voice reports something has gone wrong; they find the zombies the scientists were studying were accidentally released, with only Yerema still alive. Rescuing Yerema and retrieving {{what appears to be}} a prototype vaccine, <b>the</b> <b>survivors</b> proceed to <b>the</b> prison island.|$|R

5|$|McIntyre {{then began}} wrestling as a singles wrestler, {{immediately}} feuding with The Fabulous Moolah, unsuccessfully challenging her at Wrestlemania 2 (the referee counted the pin on McIntyre despite her left leg being {{draped over the}} bottom rope which should have stopped the count). She won the WWF Women's Championship on July 3, 1986 when she defeated Moolah at the Brisbane Festival Hall on the WWF's 1986 Australian tour, but Moolah regained the title six days later at the Sydney Entertainment Centre (the only two times the WWF Women's Championship changed hands in the Southern Hemisphere). Years later, Moolah called McIntyre the best female wrestler in Canada. In 1987, McIntyre consistently lost matches to Moolah and Sherri Martel. She also competed at <b>the</b> <b>Survivor</b> Series, teaming with Moolah, Rockin' Robin, and the Jumping Bomb Angels against Martel, Leilani Kai, Judy Martin, Donna Christanello, and Dawn Marie. By 1990, however, the women's division in the WWF was again on hiatus.|$|E
5|$|The Dalek Prime Minister {{explains}} {{that they have}} a planet known as the Asylum where they keep insane, battle-scarred Daleks. The Parliament has received a transmission of the Habanera Aria from the Asylum. The Doctor makes contact with the source of the transmission: <b>the</b> <b>survivor</b> of a starliner crash named Oswin Oswald. Oswin claims to have spent a year fending off Dalek attacks and making soufflés. The crash had ruptured the planet's force-field, thus risking escape of the insane Daleks. To prevent this, the Parliament wishes to destroy the planet remotely, but the force-field is still too strong to allow that. The Daleks task the Doctor, Amy and Rory with deactivating the force field from the planet. The three are given bracelets to protect them from the planet's nanogene cloud, which would convert them into Dalek puppets, before being dropped onto the planet.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Survivor</b> Series in November 2003 also {{marked the}} first time Lesnar met Goldberg from the Raw brand. After Lesnar claimed in a {{backstage}} interview that he could beat anybody in the world, Goldberg interrupted the interview and introduced himself to Lesnar, shaking hands with him before leaving with a staredown. Lesnar followed this rivalry with a feud involving Hardcore Holly. In the storyline, Holly wanted revenge on Lesnar for legitimately injuring his neck during a previous match between the two in 2002 which left Holly in need of neck surgery and out of action for a year. At the Royal Rumble on January 25, 2004, Lesnar defeated Holly to retain the WWE Championship. Later in the Royal Rumble match, Lesnar attacked Goldberg and attacked him with an F-5, enabling Kurt Angle to eliminate him.|$|E
