5|$|PlayStation VR is {{a virtual}} reality device that is {{produced}} by Sony Computer Entertainment. It features a 5.7 inch 1920x1080 resolution OLED display, and operates at 120fps which can eliminate blur and produce a smooth image; the device also has a low latency of less than 18ms. Additionally, it produces two sets of images, one being visible on a TV and one for <b>the</b> <b>headset,</b> and includes 3D audio technology so the player can hear from all angles. The PlayStation VR was released in October 2016.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{previous}} models, the handheld has two VGA (0.3-megapixel) digital cameras. The {{first is}} on the internal hinge and points toward the user; the second {{is on the}} outer casing and faces away from the user. The SD card slot is also new, set behind a cover on the right side. While the DS Lite used a switch, the DSi, like the original Nintendo DS, features a button to power on or off. The button has extra functions and unlike the original's power button, it {{is located on the}} bottom-left side of the touchscreen. Brightness and volume controls are on the left side; five brightness settings—one more than on the DS Lite—are available. <b>The</b> <b>headset</b> port is on the bottom.|$|E
25|$|In January 2011, the company’s fifth Bluetooth headset, Jawbone Era was announced, {{the first}} to have a {{built-in}} accelerometer and motion sensing software.

40|$|A simple {{alternative}} {{technique has}} been devised protecting delicate equipment against electrostatic discharge (ESD) in settings in which workers wear communication <b>headsets.</b> In <b>the</b> original {{setting in which}} the technique was devised, the workers who wear <b>the</b> <b>headsets</b> also wear anti-ESD grounding straps on their wrists. The alternative technique {{eliminates the need for}} the wrist grounding straps by providing for grounding through <b>the</b> <b>headsets.</b> In place of the electrically insulating foam pads on <b>the</b> <b>headsets,</b> one installs pads made of electrically conductive foam like that commonly used to protect electronic components. Grounding wires are attached to the conductive foam pads, then possibly to the shielding cable which may be grounded to the backshell on the connector. The efficacy of this technique in protecting against ESD has been verified in experiments. The electrical resistance of the pads is a few megohms - about {{the same as that of}} a human body between the fingers of opposite hands and, hence, low enough for grounding. The only drawback of the technique is that care must be taken to place the foam pads in contact with the user s skin: any hair that comes between the foam pads and the skin must be pushed aside because hair is electrically insulating and thus prevents adequate grounding...|$|R
50|$|Intugame SDK is a {{multi-platform}} VR {{development tool}} that allows creators {{to build their}} virtual reality app, game or scene once and run it on every wired or wireless VR <b>headset.</b> <b>The</b> <b>headsets</b> include Google Cardboard, Samsung Gear VR, Oculus Rift, Zeiss’ VR One, PlayStation VR, and many more.|$|R

Slipcovers shaped like cat ears sit over the motors so {{that as the}} device registers emotional states the ears move to relate. For example, when relaxed, the ears fall to the sides and perk up when excited again.|$|E
25|$|For older {{models of}} telephones, <b>the</b> <b>headset</b> {{microphone}} impedance {{is different from}} that of the original handset, requiring a telephone amplifier for the telephone headset. A telephone amplifier provides basic pin-alignment similar to a telephone headset adaptor, but it also offers sound amplification for the microphone as well as the loudspeakers. Most models of telephone amplifiers offer volume control for loudspeaker as well as microphone, mute function and switching between headset and handset. Telephone amplifiers are powered by batteries or AC adaptors.|$|E
25|$|The SingStar games require SingStar-branded microphonesone red and one bluewhich {{connect to}} the PlayStation console via a single USB {{converter}}. The USB converter was required so that both microphones would use a single USB port; the PlayStation 2 and later versions of the PlayStation 3 only have two USB ports, and the second port needed to remain free for camera functionality. The PlayStation 2 Headset was originally considered {{as an alternative to}} microphones, however <b>the</b> <b>headset</b> was not technically sufficient, and London Studio felt that handheld microphones were important to the authentic experience.|$|E

25|$|The great {{majority}} of modern bicycles have a frame with upright seating that looks much like the first chain-driven bike. These upright bicycles almost always feature the diamond frame, a truss consisting of two triangles: the front triangle and the rear triangle. The front triangle consists of the head tube, top tube, down tube, and seat tube. The head tube contains <b>the</b> <b>headset,</b> the set of bearings that allows the fork to turn smoothly for steering and balance. The top tube connects the head tube to the seat tube at the top, and the down tube connects the head tube to the bottom bracket. The rear triangle consists of the seat tube and paired chain stays and seat stays. The chain stays run parallel to the chain, connecting the bottom bracket to the rear dropout, where the axle for the rear wheel is held. The seat stays connect {{the top of the}} seat tube (at or near the same point as the top tube) to the rear fork ends.|$|E
25|$|In 2015, Oculus VR {{announced}} at The Game Awards {{that they would}} be partnering with Harmonix to make a virtual reality Rock Band game for the Rift titled Rock Band VR, to be released in 2016. Harmonix began work on the title in October 2015. The game, focused solely on guitar players, uses the Oculus Rift Touch controllers in addition to <b>the</b> <b>headset,</b> one which is attached to the guitar controller. These provide the player with a first-person view of their guitarist on stage which reacts to the player's movements. In a demonstration at the 2016 Game Developers Conference, the game was set up so that the player could see the note tracks located on the floor monitors on the virtual stage, requiring the player to look down to track them, but Harmonix stated they were exploring other means to provide this input. The player can engage other actions in the VR world by looking at certain stage elements, such as by keeping their focus on a foot pedal, they can activate pyrotechnics on the virtual stage. The game was released on March 23, 2017 and shipped with 60 songs on release.|$|E
500|$|To {{allow for}} greater {{movement}} while dancing and singing, Madonna {{was one of}} the earliest adopters of hands-free radio-frequency headset microphones, with <b>the</b> <b>headset</b> fastened over the ears or the top of the head, and the microphone capsule on a boom arm that extended to the mouth. Because of her prominent usage, the microphone design {{came to be known as}} the [...] "Madonna mic". Metz noted that Madonna represents a paradox as she is often perceived as living her whole life as a performance. While her big-screen performances are panned, her live performances are critical successes. Madonna was the first artist to have her concert tours as reenactment of her music videos. Author Elin Diamond explained that reciprocally, the fact that images from Madonna's videos can be recreated in a live setting enhances the realism of the original videos. Thus her live performances have become the means by which mediatized representations are naturalized. Taraborrelli said that encompassing multimedia, latest technology and sound systems, Madonna's concerts and live performances are [...] "extravagant show piece, [...] walking art show." ...|$|E
