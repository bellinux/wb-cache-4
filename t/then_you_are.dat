500|$|Naughty Dog {{consciously}} avoided action game stereotypes, including super-powered {{heroes and}} overly sexualized female characters. They included a large {{cast of characters}} {{to ensure that the}} story was character-driven rather than story-driven. Co-president of Naughty Dog Evan Wells stated, [...] "I honestly think that the key element, {{if you really want to}} boil it down, is characters. People will tell a story, but if it's not a character-driven plot <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> missing something." [...] Many of these characters were specifically designed to highlight different facets of Nathan Drake's personality.|$|E
500|$|Despite signing Johnston, several {{tenets of}} the {{original}} policy still officially remained in place as Rangers {{did not attempt to}} sign any further Catholic players {{for the next few years}} and because the media had branded Johnston as a [...] "card-carrying Catholic". The club did not make another major Scottish Catholic signing until Neil McCann in 1998. In the same year, Rangers lifted a ban on players making the sign of the cross at the behest of Gabriel Amato but warned them not to do it in front of supporters. In 1999, Lorenzo Amoruso became the first Catholic captain of Rangers. However, in 2002 defender Fernando Ricksen, who had been receiving sectarian phone calls from Celtic supporters, stated [...] "If you're Catholic and you play for Rangers, <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> a Protestant. If you play for the Protestant people, you don't play for the Catholic people." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{failure to}} prosecute the trio with federal charges caused some {{speculation}} about a government cover-up, particularly revolving around Troy Eid, who was appointed U.S. Attorney by President George W. Bush, and {{has been accused of}} showing political biases. Some questioned why Eid did not pursue federal charges against Gartrell, Adolf and Johnson, but filed similar charges against Marc Harold Ramsey, who allegedly sent a threatening letter to 2008 Republican presidential nominee Senator John McCain from behind bars in the Arapahoe County Jail. Ramsey, who faced five years in federal prison and $250,000 in fines if convicted, sent McCain a package with a harmless white powdery substance and a letter that read, [...] "Senator McCain, If you are reading this <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> already DEAD! Unless of course you can't or don't breathe." [...] Eid said the Ramsey case was [...] "absolutely distinguishable" [...] from that of Gartrell, Adolf and Johnson because {{there was no evidence of}} actual planning on the part of the trio.|$|E
500|$|NASCAR {{officials}} reviewed video {{evidence of}} Smith's pass of Stewart {{on the final}} lap with Smith and Dale Earnhardt, Inc. president Max Siegel in attendance, and declared the manoeuvre illegal; Smith was issued a pass-through penalty which dropped him from second to 18th. Smith argued that he was forced down below the yellow line: [...] "I was always told that the rule is if you get forced down there, <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> {{the winner of the}} race, and on the last lap, anything goes. That’s what I was going with. I had a nose inside of him and I could have piled up the whole field." [...] Ninth-place finisher Johnson said there were rumors that drivers were allowed to go below the yellow line on the last lap of the previous day's Craftsman Truck Series race which were circulated {{on the day of the}} AMP Energy 500: [...] "I didn’t know what to really think about it, or understood it, or had seen it. It’s ironic how it played out today.” ...|$|E
500|$|Patton chose Steve Henry, {{a surgeon}} and county {{commissioner}} from Louisville, {{as his running}} mate. His major opposition in the Democratic primary came from secretary of state Bob Babbage and President Pro Tempore of the Kentucky Senate John [...] "Eck" [...] Rose. Although sitting governor Brereton Jones did not officially endorse Patton, Rose referred to Jones as Patton's [...] "mentor". Rose charged that, like Jones, Patton would not take a hard stand on the issues; referring to a nickname given to Jones in the 1991 campaign, Rose remarked [...] "If you have liked Jell-O Jones, <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> {{going to be in}} a position to love Puddin' Paul Patton." [...] Particularly odious to Rose was that Patton had publicly supported collective wage bargaining for public employees, but had declared that he would not fight for it in the upcoming 1996 legislative session. Though Babbage and Rose were political veterans and solid campaigners, Patton won 152,203votes in the primary, well over the 40percent needed to avoid a runoff. Babbage ran second with 81,352votes and Rose was third with 71,740votes. Two other candidates split the remaining 33,344votes.|$|E

In the sermon, Jones states [...] "If you are against segregation and against racial separation, <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> against God Almighty."

There can't be a middle ground. Basically, if you think Michael Moore's full of shit, <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> a super-Christian right-wing whatever.

It's not a sign of creativity to have 65 ideas for one problem, that's just a waste of energy. I also don't think you need to go anywhere particular to be creative; people just use that as an excuse.
