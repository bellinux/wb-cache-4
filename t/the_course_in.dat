5|$|Britain entered three skiers, {{two men and}} one woman, {{into the}} Games. Russell Docker, {{one of only two}} athletes to have competed for Britain at the 2002 Winter Paralympics, {{appeared}} in his second Games, this time in sitting events having switched to the use of a monoski. Sean Rose, also a sit-skier, and Liz Miller, a standing skier who uses a prosthetic leg, were the other British participants. The three athletes were members of the British Adaptive Ski Team, which is run by national ski charity Disability Snowsport UK. Each of the three skiers raced in four events in their respective categories; downhill, giant slalom, slalom and Super-G. Rose had the highest finish of the three; he placed sixth in the men's sitting downhill, 0.7 seconds outside of the medal positions. Russell Docker crashed in the same event and did not finish. Docker also failed to finish in the slalom, as did Rose in the giant slalom. Miller completed <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>in</b> each of her events with a best finish of tenth in the downhill.|$|E
5|$|Cranmer {{was born}} in 1489 in Aslockton in Nottinghamshire, England. His parents, Thomas and Agnes (née Hatfield) Cranmer, were of modest wealth and were not members of the aristocracy. Their oldest son, John, {{inherited}} the family estate, whereas Thomas {{and his younger brother}} Edmund were placed on the path to a clerical career. Today historians know nothing definite about Cranmer's early schooling. He probably attended a grammar school in his village. At the age of fourteen, two years {{after the death of his}} father, he was sent to the newly created Jesus College, Cambridge. It took him a surprisingly long eight years to reach his Bachelor of Arts degree following a curriculum of logic, classical literature and philosophy. During this time, he began to collect medieval scholastic books, which he preserved faithfully throughout his life. For his master's degree he took a different course of study, concentrating on the humanists, Jacques Lefèvre d'Étaples and Erasmus. This time he progressed with no special delay, finishing <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>in</b> three years. Shortly after receiving his Master of Arts degree in 1515, he was elected to a Fellowship of Jesus College.|$|E
5|$|Forza Motorsport 4 was {{featured}} in the U.S. version of Top Gear. At the 2010 Spike Video Game Awards professional stunt driver and show co-host Tanner Foust and Rutledge Wood, car expert and co-host were featured in the unveiling of the game. Foust drove a 2010 Dodge Challenger while Wood rode as a passenger. The advertisement showed Foust drifting around the environment and ended with a top-down shot of the pad. On the pavement the word Forza was spelled out in tire marks. Additionally in the final episode of the show's second season Wood and co-host Adam Ferrara challenged Foust to a timed race at Infineon Raceway, otherwise known as Sears Point; Foust drove the Lexus LF-A around the real course while Wood and Ferrara drove <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>in</b> Forza Motorsport 4.|$|E

5|$|In 1988, Stephen E. Loeb {{proposed}} that accounting ethics education should include seven goals (adapted {{from a list}} by Daniel Callahan). To implement these goals, {{he pointed out that}} accounting ethics could be taught throughout accounting curriculum or in an individual class tailored to the subject. Requiring it be taught throughout the curriculum would necessitate all accounting teachers to have knowledge on the subject (which may require training). A single course has issues as to where to include <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>in</b> a student's education (for example, before preliminary accounting classes or near the end of a student's degree requirements), whether there is enough material to cover in a semester class, and whether most universities have room in a four-year curriculum for a single class on the subject.|$|E
5|$|Per the {{regulations}} for the 2015 season, three practice sessions were held, two 1.5-hour sessions on Friday and another one-hour session before qualifying on Saturday. Kimi Räikkönen and Sebastian Vettel of Ferrari were quickest {{in the first}} free practice session on Friday afternoon, with Räikkönen the only driver to lap <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>in</b> less than 1:38. The Mercedes team focused on long runs, running their cars on high fuel loads to examine tyre wear and were therefore down in 15th and 16th places respectively. Vettel's Ferrari showed problems early in the session, but Vettel was able to run without issues towards the end. Jenson Button spun out in turn one on {{the start of his}} first flying lap and was unable to run again as his team tried to change his car's battery. It was however an uplifting session for McLaren nonetheless, since Button's teammate Fernando Alonso finished in seventh place, just seven-tenths away from Räikkönen's fastest time. After China the week before, Jolyon Palmer once again took part in the first practice session for Lotus.|$|E
5|$|The club had {{its origins}} around 1895, with Briarcliff founder Walter W. Law's private nine-hole course on his estate, which became {{available}} to Briarcliff Lodge guests, and was {{then known as}} the Briarcliff Golf Club. In 1922, Devereux Emmet designed a course across the street with eighteen holes, and thus Briarcliff Country Club was founded that year. The name was changed in 1927 to avoid confusion, to Briar Hills Country Club. Briar Hills opened in May 1929 with a new clubhouse; construction began in May 1928 and utilized local stones for the building's exterior. The interior was noted for its design and spaciousness. In 1936, A. W. Tillinghast redesigned <b>the</b> <b>course.</b> <b>In</b> 1948, Henry Law's son Theodore sold the club to local businessmen who renamed it Briar Hall Golf and Country Club. The 1964 Metropolitan Open was hosted at Briar Hall; Jack Patroni won the championship. In 1980, ownership of the club changed hands again.|$|E
