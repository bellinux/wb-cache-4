50|$|<b>Tree</b> <b>injection,</b> {{also known}} as trunk or stem injection, is a method of target precise {{application}} of pesticides, plant resistance activators, and fertilizers into the xylem vascular tissue of a tree {{with the purpose of}} protecting the tree from pests or nutrition for correction of nutrient deficiencies. This method largely relies on harnessing the tree’s vascular system to translocate and distribute the active compounds into the wood, canopy and roots where protection or nutrition is needed. <b>Tree</b> <b>injection</b> is currently the most popular method for control of damaging insects, pathogens, and nematodes in landscape tree care. It has been developed primarily for use on large size trees and in proximity of urban areas where ground- and air-spray applications are impractical due to substantial drift-driven pesticide losses or not allowed due to potential human exposure. However, the prime driver of <b>tree</b> <b>injection</b> use has been a wide spread need for control of many invasive tree pathogens and insects pests. The most infamous examples are that of Ophiostoma fungi that cause Dutch Elm Disease (DED) and insect Emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis) which have specific biologies that lead to severe internal damage of wood and thus tree death, and which make their management extremely difficult or inefficient with classical pesticide application methods. Trunk injection for tree protection is viewed as environmentally safer alternative for pesticide application since the compound is delivered within the tree, thus allowing for selective exposure to plant pests. In landscapes and urban zones trunk injection significantly reduces the non-target exposure of water, soil, air, and wildlife to pesticides and fertilizers. In the last 20 years, <b>tree</b> <b>injection</b> is gaining momentum with the development and availability of new, efficient injection devices and injectable and xylem mobile formulations of pesticides, biopesticides and nutrients. Further, a number of newly occurring and fast spreading invasive insect pests and diseases such as Polyphagous Shot Hole Borer (PSHB) Euwallacea, which vectors plant pathogenic fungus Fusarium euwallaceae, and Sudden Oak Death (SOD) caused by an Oomycete Phytophthora ramorum, establish the use of trunk injection as the most efficient tree protection technique in landscapes and urban forestry.|$|E
50|$|In the Lake States, if {{infection}} is {{discovered in a}} tree, a vibratory plow line, commonly called a trench (or better yet, two generally parallel trenches at different distances from the area of risk) may be plowed to a minimum depth of {{four and a half}} feet (54 inches) between it and other potentially susceptible species to prevent root graft disease transmission. Such plowing will sever root grafts that may transmit the disease to neighboring trees. In southern states like Texas, where heavy clay soils are prevalent, rocksaws are commonly used in lieu of vibratory plows. An infected tree should not be cut down before vibratory plowing, because that increases the risk of oak wilt migrating quickly via roots to nearby <b>trees.</b> <b>Injections</b> of propiconazole, a fungicide, can help prevent transmission as well; as many as a half dozen injections every six months may be required to protect a large red oak near infected <b>trees.</b> <b>Injections</b> every other year may also be used to treat a white oak, if it is not yet greatly affected.|$|R
500|$|Insecticides {{with active}} {{ingredients}} such as azadirachtin, imidacloprid, [...] emamectin benzoate, and dinotefuran are currently used {{since they are}} systemic (i.e., incorporated into the tree) and remain effective for one to three years depending on the product. Insecticides are typically only considered a viable option in urban areas with high value trees near an infestation. Ash trees are primarily treated by direct <b>injection</b> into the <b>tree</b> or soil drench. Some insecticides cannot be applied by homeowners and must be applied by licensed applicators. Initially, <b>tree</b> <b>injections</b> do not compromise tree health, but over many years drilling and chemical wounds can compromise the tree's health. Damage from emerald ash borer can continue to increase over time even with insecticide applications. Insecticide treatments are not feasible for large forested areas outside of urban areas.|$|R

40|$|The Red Palm Weevil (RPW), Rhynchophorus ferrugineus (Olivier, 1790) is {{the major}} pest for both amenity and {{economic}} palms all over the world. RPW inflicts severe economic losses and several techniques have been proposed to lower its population below the economic threshold. Chemical control on healthy (symptomless) palms are the only suitable approach to control RPW infesting Phoenix canariensis because of its preventive and protective actions (2 P).

40|$|Management of {{fire blight}} is {{complicated}} by limitations on use of antibiotics in agriculture, antibiotic resistance development, and limited efficacy of alternative control agents. Even though successful in control, preventive antibiotic sprays also affect non-target bacteria, aiding the selection for resistance which could ultimately {{be transferred to the}} pathogen Erwinia amylovora. Trunk injection is a target-precise pesticide delivery method that utilizes tree xylem to distribute injected compounds. Trunk injection could decrease antibiotic usage in the open environment and increase the effectiveness of compounds in fire blight control. In field experiments, after 1 - 2 apple <b>tree</b> <b>injections</b> of either streptomycin, potassium phosphites (PH) or acibenzolar-S-methyl (ASM), significant reduction of blossom and shoot blight symptoms was observed compared to water- or non-injected control trees. Overall disease suppression with streptomycin was lower than typically observed following spray applications to flowers. Trunk injection of oxytetracycline resulted in excellent control of shoot blight severity, suggesting that injection is a superior delivery method for this antibiotic. Injection of both ASM and PH resulted in the significant induction of PR- 1, PR- 2 and PR- 8 protein genes in apple leaves indicating induction of systemic acquired resistance (SAR) under field conditions. The time separating SAR induction and fire blight symptom suppression indicated that various defensive compounds within the SAR response were synthesized and accumulated in the canopy. ASM and PH suppressed fire blight even after cessation of induced gene expression. With the development of injectable formulations and optimization of doses and injection schedules, the injection of protective compounds could serve as an effective option for fire blight control...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Eucalyptus gomphocephala is {{a unique}} {{keystone}} canopy species endemic to a narrow (5 - 10 km wide) coastal strip approximately 300 km in length in the southwest of Western Australia. E. gomphocephala is undergoing a significant decline throughout large sections of its remnant distribution within Yalgorup National Park, and in some areas resulting in 100 % mortality (Barber et al. 2007).

Mechanical trauma seems to be sufficient to evoke the response of the endosteum, which does not differ from that observed in the normal repair process of diaphyseal fractures. Bone grew very close to the metal surface, but a thin connective membrane or a layer of amorphous material was present at the interface with stainless steel, Co-Cr and titanium pins.

40|$|European Gypsy Moth (Lymantria dispar) is an {{invasive}} alien pest {{that was}} first found in Ontario in 1969. Its population fluctuates {{in relation to}} environmental and biological controls. This pest cannot be eradicated. In 2006, 2007 and 2008, Toronto implemented control measures when European Gypsy Moth populations attained outbreak levels. Those measures were successful in reducing the population to acceptable levels. Current surveys indicate European Gypsy Moth population levels have reached outbreak levels {{in some areas of}} Toronto, requiring intervention in order to mitigate the impact of this forest health threat. This report presents the interim results of the survey along with recommended control measures, which include an aerial spray of Bacillus thuringiensis subspecies kurstaki (Btk) in the larger outbreak areas. At present, aerial spraying is proposed in Wards 2, 3, 4, 5 and 27. Ground based spraying, <b>tree</b> <b>injection</b> and egg mass removal is proposed for other locations throughout the city.

40|$|Since {{the very}} early record of Rhynchophorus ferrugineus (Olivier, 1790) as palm pest, the weevil has been {{spreading}} westward to USA (California) from its tropical area of origin, roughly corresponding to the Malayan province. During its dispersion RPW shifted two times on new host plant, to be specific Date Palm (Phoenix dactylifera L.) and Canary Palm (Phoenix canariensis Hort. Ex Chabaud). IPM relevant changes in bionomics of the weevil occurred accordingly to the new host plant as studies in hundreds infested palms demonstrate in Southern continental Italy Sicily, Spain, Malta, Lebanon, Morocco, Syria, Saudi Arabia and Turkey. In these countries investigated plants mostly belong to Canary Palm while Date and Mediterranean Fan Palm (Chamaerops humilis L.) also underwent infestation. The recent introduction of RPW in the Caribbean area poses a serious risk in the area both on economic and wild palm species. Moreover it seems possible to predict a further invasion of the weevil, soon into the Latin America Countries. Looking at RPW control experience in the Old Wold it seems reasonable that we need two different I PM approaches for economic or ornamental Palm. Key-point analysis in the weevil action are: host plant morphology and density; RPW microorganic symbiosis; mite symbionts; infestation length of time and lethality; RPW egg laying behaviour; symptoms; pest population density; economic action threshold. The study of tentative RPW life-table in palm orchards and urban area stress the need for artificial mortality factors as able to lower the pest population as dispersion-related mortality does in nature.

40|$|Receptors {{believed}} {{responsible for}} the diuresis of negative pressure breathing have been located by observing the effect on urine flow of a stepwise engorgement of the intrathoracic vascular bed. Dis-tension of the pulmonary arterial <b>tree</b> (<b>injection</b> of plastic beads) and of the entire pulmonary circu-lation (snares on the pulmonary veins) were without effect. A diuresis was however elicited by ex-pansion of a balloon in the left atrium. It is concluded that stretch receptors in the left atrium and terminal pulmonary veins are instrumental in a mechanism linking changes in the actively circulat-ing blood volume with homeostatic responses of the kidney. EARLIER studies 1 •a have suggested thatthe probable cause of the diuresis in-duced by negative pressure breathing is the congestion that it induces in the thoracic viscera. A mechanism may, therefore, be sus-pected which connects changes in intrathoracic blood volume with modifications in kidney function, and {{it was thought that}} stretch re-ceptors in the heart or lungs may mediate the response. The present investigation was de-signed to determine if possible the precise location of the receptors concerned. The diu-retic effect of obstructive distension of the left atrium, which increases pressures throughout the pulmonary bed, including the right ventri-cle and the left atrium, was compared with the effect of snares around the pulmonary veins near the hilus. The latter procedure excludes the left atrium from the congested area. In a variation of this experiment, the effect of pulmonary arterial hypertension produced by embolism of the lung bed was studied.

When filled with neurobiotin (n = 27) they displayed a pyramidal shape with an apical dendrite and extensive basal dendritic <b>tree.</b> <b>Injection</b> of intracellular current pulses revealed: 1) a tetrodotoxin (TTX, 1 microM) -sensitive, inward rectification in the depolarizing direction (n = 6), and 2) a time- and voltage-dependent hyperpolarizing sag that was blocked by extracellular Cs+ (3 mM, n = 5) application. Prolonged (up to 3 s) depolarizing pulses made perirhinal cells discharge regular firing of fast action potentials that diminished over time in frequency and reached a steady level (i. e., adapted). Repetitive firing was followed by an afterhyperpolarization that was decreased, along with firing adaptation, by the Ca(2 +) -channel blocker Co 2 + (2 mM, n = 6). Action potential broadening became evident during repetitive firing. This behavior, which was more pronounced when larger pulses of depolarizing current were injected (and thus when repetitive firing attained higher rates), was markedly decreased by Co 2 + application. Subthreshold membrane oscillations at 5 - 12 Hz became apparent when cells were depolarized by 10 - 20 mV from RMP, and action potential clusters appeared with further depolarization. Application of glutamatergic and GABAA receptor antagonists (n = 4), CO 2 + (n = 6), or Cs+ (n = 5) did not prevent the occurrence of these oscillations that were abolished by TTX (n = 6).

One year, fall K₂HPO₄, (200 g K, 79. 2 g P) injections of sweet cherry trees significantly increased the K content of spur tissues and the P content of buds in March and increased the P content of midshoot leaves in August. Fruit set was significantly lower on sweet cherry trees injected with 200 g K (K₂SO₄) and 300 g K (K₂HPO₄). Yield was significantly lower for all injection treatments but fruit quality was not affected. Spring trunk injections of 12. 5 g K in K₂SO₄ or K₂HPO₄ solution increased prune leaf K within four days and K levels remained higher than controls for at least 22 days with K₂SO₄. Leaf P was increased within four days by K₂HPO₄, injections and remained higher than controls in August. Spring applications of 11. 36 kg K₂SO₄, per tree by banding, placing in augered holes in the soil or injection into the soil had no effect on sweet cherry trees within two years but did significantly increase August midshoot leaf K in prune trees within one growing season.

40|$|Abstract: Emamectin benzoate, an {{insecticide}} {{derived from}} the avermectin family of natural products, has a unique translocation behavior in trees when applied by <b>tree</b> micro <b>injection</b> (TMI), which can result in protection from insect pests (foliar and borers) for several years. Active ingredient imported into leaves was measured {{at the end of}} season in the fallen leaves of treated horse chestnut (Aesculus hippocastanum) trees. The dissipation of emamectin benzoate in these leaves seems to be biphasic and depends on the decomposition of the leaf. In compost piles, where decomposition of leaves was fastest, a cumulative emamectin benzoate degradation half-life time of 20 d was measured. In leaves immersed in water, where decomposition was much slower, the degradation half-life time was 94 d, and in leaves left on the ground in contact with soil, where decomposition was slowest, the degradation half-life time was 212 d. The biphasic decline and the correlation with leaf decomposition might be attributed to an extensive sorption of emamectin benzoate residues to leaf macromolecules. This may also explain why earthworms ingesting leaves from injected trees take up very little emamectin benzoate and excrete it with the feces. Furthermore, no emamectin benzoate was found in water containing decomposing leaves from injected trees. It is concluded, that emamectin benzoate present in abscised leaves from horse chestnut trees injected with the insecticide is not available to nontarget organisms present in soil or water bodies.

40|$|The current {{paradigm}} of biodiversity conservation requires {{the assessment of}} alien plant invaders, and their potential negative impacts on indigenous species and communities. Leptospermum laevigatum (Gaertn.) F. Muell. (Victorian tea tree/ Coast tea tree) is indigenous to eastern Australia. It has invaded ecosystems within its natural biogeographic range, within new ranges in Australia and overseas. The species is listed as a high priority weed in the Environmental Weed Strategy for Western Australia. However, the basis for its listing has been casual observation rather than focussed research. This study of L. laevigatum is unique in being the first to create a comprehensive synthesis of the ecology and management of L laevigatum in Australia, combining scientific investigation with information from land managers in eastern and Western Australia. The study combined experiments and vegetation sampling with information from researchers, council staff and bush regenerators to provide baseline data about the species 2 ̆ 7 ecology and phytogeography in Western Australia. Sites were chosen where L laevigatum appeared to be invading remnant vegetation; at these sites morphological and life history characteristics of L. laevigatum were assessed. Soil and plant litter variables and floristics were examined, comparing invaded areas with the indigenous vegetation. Predation rates and seed viability were also investigated. The {{results of the study}} show that L. laevigatum is able to occur on a variety of soil types {{in the southern part of}} Western Australia; its distribution is apparently restricted to areas with approximately 400 mm average annual rainfall. The species is spreading regionally and locally in Western Australia, with long distance dispersal probably effected by road vehicles. L laevigatum is able to invade bushland in good condition with minimal disturbance and of high conservation value. Fire is identified as r: major factor in enhancing invasion by L. laevigatum. Where fire occurs and a seed source is adjacent, resultant recruitment appears to be immense, resulting in high density thickets of L laevigatum. Such thickets are subject to intense intraspecific competition and density dependent mortality. Within thickets, survivorship of indigenous species appears to be low in general, yet some indigenous species are able to co-exist: usually those with a life form substantially different from L. laevigatum. Through chronosequence analysis, three hypotheses about L. laevigatum 2 ̆ 7 s impacts on vegetation have been generated (1) L. Iaevigatum enhances levels of leaf litter underneath its canopy, leading to differential recruitment by other species and alterations in community composition; (2) increases in litter result in increased soil moisture, thereby favouring mesophyte establishment; and (3) where dense canopies of L. laevigatum form, L. laevigatum homogenises photosynthetically active radiation over a large area, thereby reducing the variability in microsites with respect to light conditions. Photophilic species are repressed. Investigations of the biology of the species have allowed recommendations to be made about current and potential control strategies. <b>Tree</b> <b>injection</b> with herbicide leaving the dead plant in place is the least invasive method in sensitive vegetation communities.

40|$|Basal Stem Rot (BSR) of {{oil palm}} (EIaeis guineensis) {{is caused by}} Ganoderma boninense, {{and is one of}} the most commercially devastating {{diseases}} in South East Asia. It can kill more than 80 percent of stands by the time they are halfway through their normal economic life. High incidence of BSR results in economic losses, due to zero yield from dead palms and significantly reduced weight and number of fruit bunches in infected but living palms. Many methods have been attempted to control BSR. These include clean clearing, fallow period before re-planting, burning of waste or dead material, windrowing, use of fungicides as soil drenching or by <b>tree</b> <b>injection,</b> surgical removal of infected material, biological control and development of varieties with enhanced resistance. To date no method gives good control of Ganoderma infection in established plantations and some have technical limitations in application. The aim of this study was to investigate a possible source of disease resistance associated with the accumulation of phenolics, after inoculation with G. boninense and elicitation with the biopolymer chitosan. The identity of isolates of Ganoderma from Langkon Oil Palm Estate in Sabah, Malaysia, which were used in this project, was confirmed using Ganoderma Selective Medium and DNA sequence analysis after PCR amplification. That latter method showed that the Sabah isolates were very similar to virulent G. boninense strains FA 5017 or FA 5035 from West Malaysia, with a maximum similarity of 98 %. A method to inoculate oil palm seedlings with Ganoderma, based on root treatment with macerated mycelium, was developed which facilitated experiments with consistent and rapid disease development. This proved an improvement compared to the traditional technique of inoculation with colonised rubber wood blocks. Ekona and Calabar varieties of oil palm were found to be more susceptible to G. boninense infection compared to the variety AVROS, based on a higher accumulation of ergosterol (a fungal sterol) and infection scores based on the Modified Disease Severity Score. Results from both parameters showed a strong correlation between each other and provided a quick assessment on the progress of pathogen infection for use in this project. It should be noted, however, that none of the varieties tested exhibited a high level of disease resistance. Following preliminary studies to quantify the accumulation of total phenolics, using Folin-Ciocalteu reagent, High Performance Liquid Chromatography was used to monitor changes in the concentration of three specific phenolics, which were considered to be of primary importance. These were syringic acid, caffeic acid and 4 -hydroxybenzoic acid (4 -HBA). Their identification was confirmed using co-injection with pure standards and by LCMS/Q-tof. The variety AVROS showed a slightly higher content of all these three phenolics compared to Ekona and Calabar. Stimulation of their accumulation was promoted by the addition of chitosan to the plant-growing medium. By the end of the time course, the concentration of these phenolics decreased in the oil palm tissues inoculated with G. boninense suggesting possible metabolism by this pathogen. This loss was, however, not detected in tissues elicited with chitosan alone and was greatly reduced when G. boninense was combined with chitosan. In vitro studies on antifungal activity with phenolics incorporated either in 10 % Potato Dextose Agar, Oil Palm Root Agar or Oil Palm Root Broth were done, using concentrations (50 - 110 pg mL 1) of phenolic acids typically detected in oil palm root tissues. Syringic acid was found to be the most antifungal of the phenolics tested. Caffeic acid had lower activity and 4 -HBA was virtually inactive. Concentrations of syringic acid detected in root tissues, especially in the presence of chitosan, that might be expected to inhibit growth of G. boninense. The pathogen was shown to be able to degrade all of the phenolic acids tested. However, at the highest concentration tested, metabolism was greatly delayed, only occurring after a lag phase in the growth of pathogen. TLC bioassay showed the degradation products of all these phenolics were no longer antifungal. Thus, accumulation of phenolic acids, especially syringic acid, may provide a useful marker in future breeding of resistant varieties. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

40|$|The article {{analyzes}} the development by S. A. Mokrzecki (1865 - 1936) {{at the beginning}} of the XX century of the method of plant feeding and therapy using injections and offers a comparative evaluation of this method in the context of the state of the art in <b>tree</b> trunk <b>injections.</b> The main experiments using trunk injections were conducted by Mokrzecki in 1902 - 1904. Also some experiments were performed by him later. The scientist began experimenting with applying pesticides to trunk, but without success. At a small dosage of a substance, there was no effect on phytophages, while increasing the dosage led to tree death or extensive damage. So the scientist changed the approach and began to apply nutrients and got visible positive results. The article surveys the state of the art in the trunk injection method and demonstrates that in our time the idea of plant protection by pesticide injection has been successfully implemented. This success is due to lesser toxicity of modern remedies than those used by Mokrzecki. At the same time there is no substantial difference between modern and Mokrzecki’s methods of applying of substances to the trunk. S. A. Mokrzecki’s research generated great interest both in the academic community and among practitioners. There were also critical reviews. Polemics arose with I. J. Shevyriov who disputed Mokrzecki’s priority for the discovery of the method. Analysis of this issue suggests that the work of both scientists had fundamental differences, thus making S. A. Mokrecki’s idea to inject nutrients scientifically novel and original. The analysis and assessment of the scientist’s work on the method of off-root feeding should be of interest to historians of science, scientists and practitioners involved in the plant protection...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the geometry of}} injection regions {{and its relationship to}} optimization of power flows in <b>tree</b> networks. The <b>injection</b> region is the set of all vectors of bus power injections that satisfy the network and operation constraints. The geometrical object of interest is the set of Pareto-optimal points of the injection region. If the voltage magnitudes are fixed, the injection region of a tree network can be written as a linear transformation of the product of two-bus injection regions, one for each line in the network. Using this decomposition, we show that under the practical condition that the angle difference across each line is not too large, the set of Pareto-optimal points of the injection region remains unchanged by taking the convex hull. Moreover, the resulting convexified optimal power flow problem can be efficiently solved via }{ semi-definite programming or second order cone relaxations. These results improve upon earlier works by removing the assumptions on active power lower bounds. It is also shown that our practical angle assumption guarantees two other properties: (i) the uniqueness of the solution of the power flow problem, and (ii) the non-negativity of the locational marginal prices. Partial results are presented for the case when the voltage magnitudes are not fixed but can lie within certain bounds. Comment: To Appear in IEEE Transaction on Power System...|$|R
40|$|Random Forest (RF) {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely used {{supervised}} learning methods available. An RF is ensemble of decision <b>tree</b> classifiers with <b>injection</b> of several sources of randomness. It demonstrates a set of improvement over single decision and regression trees and is comparable or superior to major classification tools such as support vector machine (SVM) and adaptive boosting (Adaboost) with respect to accuracy, interpretability, robustness and processing speed. RF can be generally divided into training process and predicting process. Recently with emergence of large-scale data mining applications, the RF training process implemented in software on a single computer can no longer induce a complex RF model within reasonable amount of time. Alternative solutions involving computer clusters and GPUs usually come with disadvantages with respect to Performance/Power ratio and are not feasible for portable/embedded applications. In this work a set of FPGA-based implementations of the RF training process are proposed. FPGA devices allow construction of efficient custom hardware architectures and feature lower power consumption than typical GPPs or GPUs therefore are suitable for portable/embedded applications. The proposed hardware training architectures take advantage of different types of inherent parallelism in the RF training algorithm and distribute the workload to a set of parallel workers. Combining the parallel processing techniques with custom hardware designs featuring low latency, the architectures are able to accelerate the training process without loss in accuracy.

40|$|Vigor {{state of}} middle-aged pine stands was {{estimated}} during 2002 - 2008 at {{permanent sample plots}} by two methods: 1) visual estimation of stand vigor rank according to the 6 -point scale of Forest Regulations of RF and 2) method of induction of <b>tree</b> defense response (<b>injection</b> of stem with high molecular extractives from Ceratocystis laricicola mycelium and registration of parameters of stem phloem necrosis). The stands of similar origin and structure were preliminarily divided into background and polluted ones {{on the basis of}} different amount of polluting substances in snow cover. Estimation of external tree signs according to 6 -point scale didn't reveal significant differences between stands in monitored period. In contrast to this morphological method parameters of specific necrotic response of stem inner bark to fungal extract differed significantly in background and polluted stands. Parameters of the necrotic spots on the phloem were shown to depend on effect of creeping fire. The necrosis size increased and the necrosis "moved" toward crown during two years after the fire. The results are in accordance with the hypothesis that the size of phloem necrosis induced by the effect of extractives from phytopathogenic fungus mycelium on stem vascular tissues was determined by the tree state - it increased in damaged tree and decreased with tree state improvement. The injection method can inform about changes of physiological condition of tree and stand at the latent stage when exterior characteristics of a tree haven't changed yet...|$|R

In pin oak (Quercus palustris Muenchh.) bottomland forests in southeast Missouri, we revisited clearcuts, shelterwood harvests, and controls within the Mingo Basin. Seventeen years later, we found significant changes, in both the change in basal area and changes in trees per acre for each of the species and genera present. We compared pretreatment midstory tree species' conditions with their mortality following a dormant season herbicide <b>injection.</b> <b>Tree</b> mortality rates varied significantly by species. Models developed suggest that green ash and American elm (Ulmus americana L.) trees were effectively deadened by the midstory treatment, and sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua L.) and red maple trees were not deadened effectively. We compared the survival and growth of underplanted pin oak acorns, bareroot seedlings, and RPM® container seedlings in plots that were thinned with and without ground flora control. After one growing season, we found that RPM® container seedlings had the greatest survival followed by bareroot seedlings. Survival of planted stock was similar to natural reproduction. Direct-seeded seedlings had the poorest survival. Diameter growth of planted stock was significantly less than that of direct-seeded or natural stock; height growth of bareroot stock was significantly less than the other stock types...|$|R

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. The effects of three soil aerators on trunk growth, yield, nut size, and percent kernel of pecan were studied at Frio, Medina, and San Saba Counties in Texas in 1993 and 1994. A complete randomized block design was used in each location to compare three different types of soil aeration equipment to a control. The Frio County study contained six replications on four 'Wichita' trees per treatment. The Medina County study contained seven replications on three 'Wichita' trees per treatment. The San Saba County study contained six replications on two 'Western' trees per treatment. The treatments included (A) Guin Root Feeder; (B) Savage aerator; (C) Aerway aerator; and (D) control, no treatment. The Guin Root Feeder is a manually-operated pneumatic aerator which injects air 15 cm into the soil. Each treated <b>tree</b> received 16 <b>injections</b> equally spaced in a 2 m square block design. The Savage aerator has 12 crescent-shaped spikes, arranged in three rows, which slices the soil every 70. 78 cm to a depth of 40. 6 cm. The model used in this study was 2. 29 m wide. Each treated tree had three passes on two sides. The Aerway aerator has sixteen spikes, 1. 27 cm thick by 20. 3 cm in length, spaced 10. 2 cm and mounted on two spindles. The model used in this study was the 1. 7 m model with a wheel kit. Each treated tree had three passes on two sides. Treatments were applied and trunk diameters were measured in mid-May 1993 and 1994 at each location. In the fall of each year nut samples were collected from each treatment block, and nut yield was measured and analyzed for quality. Results {{of this study indicate that}} for these two years soil aeration did not increase trunk growth, nut yield, or quality. This could have been the result of a detrimental increase in water infiltration that saturated the clay soils and may have possibly destroyed roots since internal drainage was restricted.

40|$|Since the 1990 ’s Eucalyptus gomphocephala (tuart) {{has been}} {{suffering}} a significant decline in Yalgorup National Park, approximately 100 km south of Perth Western Australia. Symptoms range from chronic deterioration to sudden mass collapse. The role of Phytophthora pathogens was investigated because the progressive canopy thinning, dieback and heterogeneous {{distribution of the}} decline were similar to other forest declines caused by a range of Phytophthora species which are widespread throughout south-west Western Australia and worldwide. In combination with sampling for Phytophthora isolation, an initial diagnostic trial tested the effect of trunk applied phosphite, nutrients and combined phosphite and nutrients on natural stands of declining E. gomphocephala. Phosphite injection {{was used as a}} diagnostic tool to identify the possible role of Phytophthora pathogens because the chemical specifically suppresses Phytophthora pathogens and has no known direct fertilizer effect on the host. A range of nutrient treatments was also applied as a diagnostic tool to indicate what nutrient deficiencies may be involved in the decline. Initially no Phytophthora species were isolated from the treatment sites. However, individual and combined injection treatments of phosphite and nutrients improved the crown health over four years with the greatest improvement from treatments of phosphite and zinc sulphide. In combination with further rhizosphere sampling for Phytophthora species, the response of declining trees to phosphite application was further investigated in a second injection trial. Phosphite concentrations from 75 to 375 g phosphite/L improved crown health compared to the control, with the best improvement at 150 g phosphite/L. The positive response of declining <b>trees</b> to phosphite <b>injection</b> implicated a Phytophthora pathogen, despite no Phytophthora species being isolated at this time. Consequently further work was undertaken to determine the involvement of Phytophthora species. Concurrently to both injection trials, several seedling bioassays were conducted. The first bioassay tested the effect of pasteurising soil from a declining site within Yalgorup and healthy sites outside the Yalgorup woodland on E. gomphocephala seedlings grown ex situ. Seedling growth ex situ was not significantly reduced in nonpasteurised soil compared to the pasteurised soils from declining sites, and no Phytophthora species was isolated. To further investigate the disease the fine root and ectomycorrhizal systems of the largest main lateral root of 18 declining E. gomphocephala trees within Yalgorup were exposed using an air spade. Necrotic roots were sampled and the crown, fine root and ectomycorrhizal health were assessed. No Phytophthora species was isolated from necrotic roots; however, crown health of the declining trees was significantly correlated with the fine root and ectomycorrhizae density, suggesting that below ground damage could be involved in the decline. The relationship between the above and below ground health of the air spaded trees was investigated further using an in situ and ex situ seedling bioassay. In the in situ bioassay, seedlings were planted within the exposed root mats of the air spaded trees. In the ex situ bioassay, seedlings were grown within a glasshouse in pasteurised and non-pasteurised soil collected from the air spaded root mats. No Phytophthora species was identified in these bioassays, and seedlings grown ex situ in non-pasteurised soil showed no clear decline symptoms, but the health of the woodland trees was significantly correlated with seedling survival, foliar health and height of the seedlings An additional 32 sites throughout the E. gomphocephala range were sampled for the presence of Phytophthora pathogens using a modified sampling and isolation procedure. From this survey a new Phytophthora species was isolated from five sites from the roots of declining E. gomphocephala, E. marginata and Agonis flexuosa at Yalgorup National Park. Morphologically similar to P. citricola, the new Phytophthora species is unique based on phylogenetic analysis of the ITS and Cox 1 gene regions and was named P. multivora. Phytophthora multivora has subsequently been isolated from all experimental sites showing tuart decline. Two experiments tested the pathogenicity of P. multivora to E. gomphocephala and E. marginata. The first experiment examined ex situ the pathogenicity of five P. multivora isolates and one P. cinnamomi isolate on the root systems of E. gomphocephala and one P. multivora isolate on the root system of E. marginata. In the second experiment, the pathogenicity of P. multivora to E. gomphocephala and E. marginata saplings was measured in situ using under-bark stem inoculation. Phytophthora multivora isolates caused significant fine root loss and lesion extension in under-bark inoculated stems of both E. gomphocephala and E. marginata. Phytophthora multivora was also reisolated from necrotic fine roots and lesions of inoculated saplings of both E. gomphocephala and E. marginata, thus satisfying Koch’s postulates. No seedlings died in these pathogenicity trials and P. multivora was not reisolated from beyond the fine roots. There was evidence that P. multivora significantly contributes to E. gomphocephala decline by episodically causing fine root damage leading to chronic deterioration of the trees...|$|R
