5|$|Political {{analysts have}} {{suggested}} {{several reasons for}} this victory, including the popularity of Modi, {{and the loss of}} support for the Congress due to the corruption scandals in its previous term. <b>The</b> <b>BJP</b> was also able to expand its traditionally upper-caste, upper-class support base and received significant support from middle-class and Dalit people, as well as among Other Backward Classes. Its support among Muslims remained low; only 8% of Muslim voters voted for <b>the</b> <b>BJP.</b> <b>The</b> <b>BJP</b> was also very successful at mobilising its supporters, and raising voter turnout among them.|$|E

5|$|During the 1996 elections, <b>the</b> <b>BJP</b> shifted its stance {{away from}} {{protectionism}} and towards globalisation; its election manifesto recommended increasing {{foreign investment in}} priority sectors, while restricting it in others. When the party was in power in 1998, it shifted its policy even further in favour of globalisation. The tenure of the NDA saw an unprecedented influx of foreign companies in India. This was criticised by the left parties and the BJP's affiliates (the RSS and the Swadeshi Jagran Manch). The communist parties said that <b>the</b> <b>BJP</b> was attempting to appease the World Bank and the United States government through its neoliberal policies. Similarly, the RSS stated that <b>the</b> <b>BJP</b> was not being true to its swadeshi ideology.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>BJP</b> is the world's largest {{political}} party by primary membership, having 100 million registered members as of April 2015. The organisation of <b>the</b> <b>BJP</b> is strictly hierarchical, {{with the president}} being the highest authority in the party. Until 2012, <b>the</b> <b>BJP</b> constitution mandated that any qualified member could be national or state president for a single three-year term. This was amended {{to a maximum of}} two consecutive terms. Below the president is the national executive, which contains a variable number of senior leaders from across the country. It is the higher decision making body of the party. Its members are several vice-presidents, general-secretaries, treasurers and secretaries, who work directly with the president. An identical structure, with an executive committee led by a president, exists at the state, regional, district and local level.|$|E
5|$|A {{two-year period}} of {{political}} turmoil followed {{the general election}} of 1996. Several short-lived alliances shared power at the centre. <b>The</b> <b>BJP</b> formed a government briefly in 1996; {{it was followed by}} two comparatively long-lasting United Front coalitions, which depended on external support. In 1998, <b>the</b> <b>BJP</b> was able to form a successful coalition, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). Led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the NDA became the first non-Congress, coalition government to complete a five-year term. In the 2004 Indian general elections, again no party won an absolute majority, but the Congress emerged as the largest single party, forming another successful coalition: the United Progressive Alliance (UPA). It had the support of left-leaning parties and MPs who opposed <b>the</b> <b>BJP.</b> The UPA returned to power in the 2009 general election with increased numbers, and it no longer required external support from India's communist parties. That year, Manmohan Singh became the first prime minister since Jawaharlal Nehru in 1957 and 1962 to be re-elected to a consecutive five-year term. In the 2014 general election, <b>the</b> <b>BJP</b> became the first political party since 1984 to win a majority and govern without the support of other parties. The Prime Minister of India is Narendra Modi, who was formerly Chief Minister of Gujarat. On 20 July 2017, Ram Nath Kovind was elected India’s 14th President and took the oath of office on 25 July 2017.|$|E

5|$|India is the world's {{most populous}} democracy. A {{parliamentary}} republic with a multi-party system, it has seven recognised national parties, including the Indian National Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), {{and more than}} 40 regional parties. The Congress is considered centre-left in Indian political culture, and <b>the</b> <b>BJP</b> right-wing. For most of the period between 1950—when India first became a republic—and the late 1980s, the Congress held {{a majority in the}} parliament. Since then, however, it has increasingly shared the political stage with <b>the</b> <b>BJP,</b> as well as with powerful regional parties which have often forced the creation of multi-party coalitions at the centre.|$|E
5|$|Modi {{became an}} RSS sambhag pracharak (regional organiser) in 1978, {{overseeing}} RSS {{activities in the}} areas of Surat and Vadodara, and in 1979 he {{went to work for the}} RSS in Delhi, where he was put to work researching and writing the RSS's version of the history of the Emergency. He returned to Gujarat a short while later, and was assigned by the RSS to <b>the</b> <b>BJP</b> in 1985. In 1987 Modi helped organise the BJP's campaign in the Ahmedabad municipal election, which <b>the</b> <b>BJP</b> won comfortably; Modi's planning has been described as the reason for that result by biographers. After L. K. Advani became president of <b>the</b> <b>BJP</b> in 1986, the RSS decided to place its members in important positions within the BJP; Modi's work during the Ahmedabad election led to his selection for this role, and Modi was elected organising secretary of the BJP's Gujarat unit later in 1987.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>BJP</b> won 31% of the vote, {{and more}} than doubled its tally in the Lok Sabha to 282, {{becoming}} the first party to win a majority of seats on its own since 1984. Voter dissatisfaction with the INC, {{as well as with}} regional parties in North India, was another reason for the success of <b>the</b> <b>BJP,</b> as was the support from the RSS. In states such as Uttar Pradesh in which <b>the</b> <b>BJP</b> performed well, it drew exceptionally high support from upper-caste Hindus, although the 10 percent of Muslim votes won was more than it had won before. It performed particularly well in parts of the country that had recently experienced violence between Hindus and Muslims. The magnitude of the BJP's victory led many commentators to say that the election constituted a political realignment away from progressive parties and towards the right-wing. Modi's tweet announcing his victory was described as being emblematic of the political realignment away from a secular, socialist state towards capitalism and Hindu cultural nationalism.|$|E
5|$|This {{shift in}} the {{economic}} policies of <b>the</b> <b>BJP</b> was also visible in state governments, especially in Gujarat, where <b>the</b> <b>BJP</b> held power for 16 years. Modi's government, in power from 2002 to 2014, followed a strongly neo-liberal agenda, presented as a drive towards development. Its policies have included extensive privatisation of infrastructure and services, {{as well as a}} significant rollback of labour and environmental regulations. While this was praised by the business community, commentators criticised it as catering to the BJP's upper class constituency instead of the poor.|$|E

In November 2008 he was elected a member of the Rajya Sabha from Uttarakhand and remained a member till his election to the Lok Sabha in 2014.

5|$|Although {{previous}} Congress governments {{developed the}} capability {{for a nuclear}} weapons test, the Vajpayee government broke with India's historical strategy of avoiding it and authorised Pokhran-II, a series of five nuclear tests in 1998. The tests came soon after Pakistan tested a medium-range ballistic missile. They were seen {{as an attempt to}} display India's military prowess to the world, and a reflection of anti-Pakistan sentiment within <b>the</b> <b>BJP.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although {{the newly}} formed BJP was {{technically}} distinct from the Jana Sangh, the bulk of its rank and file were identical to its predecessor, with Vajpayee being its first president. Historian Ramachandra Guha writes that the early 1980s were marked by a wave of violence between Hindus and Muslims. <b>The</b> <b>BJP</b> initially moderated the Hindu nationalist stance of its predecessor the Jana Sangh to gain a wider appeal, emphasising its links to the Janata Party and the ideology of Gandhian Socialism. This was unsuccessful, as it won only two Lok Sabha seats in the elections of 1984. The assassination of Indira Gandhi {{a few months earlier}} resulted in a wave of support for the Congress which won a record tally of 403 seats, contributing to the low number for <b>the</b> <b>BJP.</b>|$|E
5|$|Compared to the Congress, <b>the</b> <b>BJP</b> takes a more {{aggressive}} and nationalistic position on defence policy and terrorism. The Vajpayee-led NDA government carried out nuclear weapons tests, and enacted the Prevention of Terrorism Act, which later came under heavy criticism. It also deployed troops to evict infiltrators from Kargil, and supported the United States' War on Terror.|$|E

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the violence there were widespread calls for Modi to resign as chief minister from within and outside the state, including from leaders of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam and the Telugu Desam Party (allies in the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance coalition), and opposition parties stalled Parliament over the issue. Modi submitted his resignation at the April 2002 BJP national executive meeting in Goa, but it was not accepted. His cabinet had an emergency meeting on 19 July 2002, after which it offered its resignation to the Gujarat Governor S. S. Bhandari, and the state assembly was dissolved. Despite opposition from the election commissioner, who said that a number of voters were still displaced, Modi succeeded in advancing the election to December 2002. In the elections, <b>the</b> <b>BJP</b> won 127 seats in the 182-member assembly. Although Modi later denied it, he made significant use of anti-Muslim rhetoric during his campaign, and <b>the</b> <b>BJP</b> profited from religious polarisation among the voters. Modi hired the public relations firm APCO Worldwide to manage his image. He won the Maninagar constituency, receiving 1,13,589 of 1,54,981 votes and defeating INC candidate Yatin Oza by 75,333 votes. On 22 December 2002, Bhandari swore Modi in for a second term. Modi framed the criticism of his government for human rights violations as an attack upon Gujarati pride, a strategy which led to <b>the</b> <b>BJP</b> winning two-thirds of the seats in the state assembly.|$|E
