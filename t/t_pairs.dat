The polycation spermidine was used to stabilize the ds-DNA structure, allowing electrical measurements to be performed in a dry state. For specific sequences, the conductivity was observed to scale with the surface density of immobilized DNA, which can be controlled by the buffer concentration.

40|$|This {{paper is}} devoted to the design of fast {{parallel}} accelerators for the cryptographic <b>T</b> <b>pairing</b> on supersingular elliptic curves over finite fields of characteristics two and three. We propose here a novel hardware implementation of Miller’s algorithm based on a parallel pipelined Karatsuba multiplier. After a short description of the strategies that we considered to design our multiplier, we point out the intrinsic parallelism of Miller’s loop and outline the architecture of coprocessors for the <b>T</b> <b>pairing</b> over F 2 m and F 3 m. Thanks to a careful choice of algorithms for the tower field arithmetic associated with the <b>T</b> <b>pairing,</b> we manage to keep the pipelined multiplier at the heart of each coprocessor busy. A final exponentiation is still required to obtain a unique value, which is desirable in most cryptographic protocols. We supplement our pairing accelerators with a coprocessor responsible for this task. An improved exponentiation algorithm allows us to save hardware resources. According to our place-and-route results on Xilinx FPGAs, our designs improve both the computation time and the area–time trade-off compared to previously published coprocessors.

The dodecamer contains an A 3 T 3 tract that induces intrinsic curvature of the helix axis. Previous studies from this and other laboratories have shown that the kinetics of base pair opening in AnTn tracts is unique: the opening rates of the A. <b>T</b> base <b>pairs</b> in the interior of the tract are much lower than that of the A. <b>T</b> base <b>pair</b> at the 5 '-end of the tract. In the present work, we have investigated the energetics of the pathways for opening of the A. <b>T</b> base <b>pairs</b> in the A 3 T 3 tract. The energetic parameters of the activated state(s) are obtained from the temperature dependence of the opening rate constants. The lower opening rates for the A. <b>T</b> base <b>pairs</b> situated in the interior of the tract are shown to originate from higher activation enthalpies which are compensated, in part, by increases in the activation entropies.

The analysis in the paper finds that the revenue-generating performance of alternatively structured RRTs depends both on the profit margin on extracted resource and on the riskiness of the resource deposit. Hence no single structure is superior in all situations, although a low r, <b>t</b> <b>pair</b> is better if profit margins and riskiness are low, while a high r, <b>t</b> <b>pair</b> is better if these factors are high.
