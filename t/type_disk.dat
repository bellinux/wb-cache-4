The spectrum goes to a 'so-called' soft state. When the Keplerian rate is not high compared to the low-angular momentum component, the CENBOL survives and the spectrum is dominated by the high energy X-rays.

We have observed our early type disks in a bandpass (R-Band) in which the light is dominated by stars with ages greater than 109 yrs, and therefore are seeing azimuthal asymmetries in the stellar mass distribution. The similar degree of lopsidedness seen in disks of very different star formation rates indicates that the lopsidedness in all galactic disks is primarily due to azimuthal mass asymmetries. Hence, 20 % of all disk galaxies (regardless of Hubble Type) have azimuthal asymmetries, 〈A 1 /A 0 〉 ≥ 0. 19, in their stellar disk mass distribution, confirming lopsidedness as a dynamical phenomenon...|$|E

40|$|We {{construct}} a large data set of global structural parameters for 1300 field and cluster spiral galaxies {{and explore the}} joint distribution of luminosity L, optical rotation velocity V, and disk size R at I and 2 MASS K bands. The I- and K-band velocity-luminosity (VL) relations have log slopes of 0. 29 and 0. 27, respectively, with σ_(ln) (VL) ~ 0. 13, and show a small dependence on color and morphological type {{in the sense that}} redder, earlier <b>type</b> <b>disk</b> galaxies rotate faster than bluer, later <b>type</b> <b>disk</b> galaxies for most luminosities. The VL relation at I and K bands is independent of surface brightness, size, and light concentration. The log slope of the I- and K-band size-luminosity (RL) relations is a strong function of morphology and varies from 0. 25 to 0. 5, with a mean of 0. 32 for all Hubble types. At most luminosities, early-type disk galaxies have shorter scale lengths than later type ones. The average dispersion σ_(ln) (RL) decreases from 0. 33 at I band to 0. 29 at K, likely due to the 2 MASS selection bias against lower surface brightness galaxies. The VL and RL residuals are largely uncorrelated with each other with a correlation coefficient r = - 0. 16 and Δ log V|L/Δ log R|L = - 0. 07 ± 0. 01; the RV - RL residuals show a weak positive correlation with r = 0. 53.

40|$|Abstract. We present {{luminosity}} profiles, colour profiles and disk parameters {{based on}} near-infrared JHK surface photometry {{of a sample}} of blue low surface brightness galaxies (BLSBGs). The results are discussed along with previously obtained optical data. We find that the morphological properties in optical and near-IR are quite similar. The luminosity profiles have exponential shapes modified by a small central bulge or, below µB, 0 ∼ 23 magnitudes arcsec− 2, a trough. The blue LSBGs have scalelengths intermediate between normal LSB disks and gas rich dwarf galaxies. A correlation between scalelength and B-V colour is found for LSBGs in general. In comparison with normal late <b>type</b> <b>disk</b> galaxies our galaxies are bluer and smaller. At the same B scalelength, the two types differ in luminosity with 2 magnitudes, corresponding to a difference in mean star formation rate of a factor 5 - 10.

However, for a given application, it remains difficult {{to decide whether the}} application should be deployed on homogeneous nodes or heterogeneous nodes. In this paper, we perform a case study on finding opti-mized configurations for Video on Demand(VOD) systems. We examine two major modules in VOD systems, the streaming module and the transcoding module. In this study, we measure performance and power on different configurations by varying these factors: processor <b>type,</b> <b>disk</b> type, number of disks, operating systems and module mapping modes. We find that hosting VOD systems on heterogeneous nodes reduces no more than 35 % power or cost per unit work done, compared with the server-only configuration. In Windows, multiplexing the two modules on servers achieves comparable power and cost reduction, but it is even worse than the non-multiplexing solution in Linux. The anti-intuitive and non-consistent results reflect the intrinsic complexity of finding an optimized configuration for a VOD system.
