To accomplish this, a processing chain to render comparable the leveling measurements and the interferometric derived measurements has been developed. The distinct steps proposed include a solution for reducing the orbital and atmospheric interferometric fringes and an innovative method to compute the actual InSAR estimated vertical ground subsidence, for direct comparison with the leveling data.

40|$|Digital Terrain Model (DTM) {{nowadays}} is invaluable aid for {{the engineering}} community. Nevertheless, the time and cost associated with DTM data acquisition have often been prohibitive. This {{is due to the}} process of data collection, which is costly and time consuming. DTM is based on topographical information which is commonly obtained by photogrammetry, remote sensing, laser scanning, radar interferometry, and other classical terrestrial or Global Positioning System (GPS) survey. Photogrammetry, remote sensing and radar interferometry are commonly applied on the generation of medium to low-resolution DTM covering large area. Meanwhile, laser scanning, classical <b>terrestrial</b> <b>survey</b> and GPS are employed for high-resolution DTM generation. Most of civil engineering projects are in large scale applications which need high-resolution DTM. Laser scanning furnishes latest technology for medium to high resolution DTM generation but it is still relatively expensive. Classical <b>terrestrial</b> <b>survey</b> is relatively cheaper but requires intervisibility between stations. Real Time Kinematic GPS (RTK GPS), compared to both previously mentioned techniques, provides an easy, quick, and comparatively cheap alternative where less surveyor needed for the survey and no intervisibility between stations required. The paper is focused on the experiment aiming to derive a high-resolution DTM by RTK GPS by comparing it to classical <b>terrestrial</b> <b>survey</b> using Total Station.

40|$|Monitoring of the crustal {{movements}} along a tectonic {{fault is}} of particular importance {{in the study of}} the mechanism of an earthquake. There are several techniques to gauge crustal deformations, including <b>terrestrial</b> <b>survey</b> methods, space-positioning techniques and permanently installed geotechnical instruments. Each technique or method has its own advantages and limitations. Integration of the various techniques into a monitoring scheme is recommended. It is discussed how a proper integrated system can significantly improve the separability of a monitoring scheme at little additional expense. Separability is the ability of a monitoring scheme to distinguish among potential deformation models, and can be used for the optimum design of monitoring schemes. Discussion concentrates on the separability between a dislocation model and a rigid movement model in the area of an active fault. The addition of a few strain observations to a conventional <b>terrestrial</b> <b>survey</b> scheme can better distinguish between the above-mentioned models.

40|$|Traditionally, {{deformation}} monitoring {{was achieved}} via labour intensive manual measurements using conventional <b>terrestrial</b> <b>surveying</b> instruments. Continuous automated deformation measurements were first introduced through geotechnical sensors that, once installed, require only infrequent checks of their performance. The advent of motorised <b>terrestrial</b> <b>surveying</b> instruments considerably reduced the labour required to conduct optical deformation monitoring by measuring {{to a set}} of prisms at predetermined time intervals. The introduction of GPS technology has provided an additional method to provide continuous measurements for deformation monitoring. Although many technologies exist to perform deformation measurements, often a combination of these technologies can provide more information to better monitor the deformable object and its surroundings and hence multiple sensor technologies are useful to augment each other. This paper describes a state-of-the-art system that combines multiple sensor types to provide measurements to perform deformation monitoring.

40|$|Summary The Western Australian Environmental Protection Authority has {{indicated}} that <b>terrestrial</b> fauna <b>surveys</b> undertaken {{for the purpose of}} preparing Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) are providing inadequate information for decision-makers to assess development impacts on biodiversity and ecosystems. This study examined the current standard of <b>terrestrial</b> vertebrate fauna <b>surveys</b> undertaken as the basis for preparing an EIA. In the absence of a protocol to assess current standards of <b>terrestrial</b> fauna <b>surveys,</b> ‘best practice’ was defined and quantified through consultation with an ‘expert panel’. Data from fauna surveys contained in 15 recent EIA reports from the Goldfields region of Western Australia were critically examined {{to determine the extent of}} compliance with ‘best practice’. The majority of surveys performed poorly against the established criteria. A few reports addressed many of the issues comprehensively, however, at least 50 % failed to mention or adequately address a high proportion of criteria considered essential, including searches of government databases, detection of rare/endangered fauna and multiseasonal sampling. All reports failed to employ sufficient trapping effort at both the biotope and landscape scales to adequately assess terrestrial vertebrate fauna biodiversity. These results indicate the need to redress minimum standards for <b>terrestrial</b> fauna <b>surveys</b> in order to meet the expectations of the EIA process...|$|R
