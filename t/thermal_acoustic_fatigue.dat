40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the current study}} was to assess the repeatability of experiments at NASA Langley's <b>Thermal</b> <b>Acoustic</b> <b>Fatigue</b> Apparatus (TAFA) facility and to use these experiments to validate numerical models. Experiments show that power spectral density (PSD) curves were repeatable except at the resonant frequencies, which tended to vary between 5 Hz to 15 Hz. Results show that the thinner specimen had more variability in the resonant frequency location than the thicker sample, especially for modes higher than the first mode in the frequency range. Root Mean Square (RMS) tended to be more repeatable. The RMS behaved linearly through the SPL range of 135 to 153 dB. Standard Deviations (STDs) of the results tended to be relatively low constant up to about 147 dB. The RMS results were more repeatable than the PDS results. The STD results were less than 10 % of the RMS results for both the 0. 125 in (0. 318 cm) and 0. 062 in (0. 1588 cm) thick plate. The STD of the PSD results were around 20 % to 100 % of the mean PSD results for non-resonant and resonant frequencies, respectively, for the 0. 125 in (0. 318 cm) thicker plate and between 25 % to 125 % of the mean PSD results, for nonresonant and resonant frequencies, respectively, for the thinner plate...|$|E

40|$|The {{application}} of bonded repairs to structures subject to <b>acoustic</b> <b>fatigue</b> is investigated, {{with a view}} to developing simple solutions suitable for engineering applications. <b>Acoustic</b> <b>fatigue</b> is caused by a random response of a structure due to time varying pressure waves from engine and / or aerodynamic sources. For vibration problems the use of damping in repairs will reduce the amplitude of vibration and hence the stress intensity factor in the cracked structure. To assess the viability of the composite bonded repairs subject to <b>acoustic</b> <b>fatigue</b> new analytical tools are needed. In this paper the use of a simplified dynamic analysis combined with crack-bridging theory allows the influence of damping to be assessed. This theory is adapted to panels with various edge support conditions with good results. Validation of this work is carried out using a Finite Element (F.

40|$|To protect {{installations}} {{in the gas}} and oil industry and process industries against overpressure the installation of relief systems is common practice. However, there have been incidents where such systems fail {{as a result of}} high dynamic loads caused by: the generation of shock waves when the relief valve is opened very instantly; the occurrence of two-phase flow in the relief line and the corresponding formation of slugs; instability of the relief valve and <b>acoustic</b> <b>fatigue.</b> This paper focuses on <b>acoustic</b> <b>fatigue,</b> which occasionally has been the cause of incidents like at Krechba – In Salah Gas Project Algeria where a breakdown of a relief system occurred. The extremely high sound levels caused by the expanding flow through a relief line finally caused fatigue failure of the system. Such incidents are the reason for the requirement to analyze the possibility of <b>acoustic</b> <b>fatigue</b> of relief systems and other systems with a strong acoustic source already during the design. In the paper we present the method that TNO applied for <b>acoustic</b> <b>fatigue</b> analysis. So far a calculation of the internal sound power levels was made and evaluated against the allowable levels presented by Carucci and Mueller [1]. However, this method does not allow computing the cyclic stresses of the piping. Due to the large dimensions and the high frequencies involved, {{it is not possible to}} compute accurately the sound field in the piping and to use a deterministic method to evaluate the cyclic stresses of the piping. In this paper we present work recently done where the Statistical Energy Analysis (SEA) method is applied to evaluate the cyclic stresses in the piping material. Due to the statistical nature of the method, it is not possible to determine with deterministic certainty the stress levels in every point of the piping. Yet, this method gives a range of cyclic stress for each pipe section or element. This leads to a more reliable criterion for <b>acoustic</b> <b>fatigue</b> studies than the earlier method, which is based on maximum allowable pressure fluctuations...|$|R

40|$|At last year's SPIE symposium, we {{reported}} {{results of an}} experiment on structural vibration damping of an F- 15 underbelly panel using piezoelectric shunting with five bonded PZT transducers. The panel vibration was induced with an acoustic speaker at an overall sound pressure level (OASPL) of about 90 dB. Amplitude reductions of 13. 45 and 10. 72 dB were achieved {{for the first and}} second modes, respectively, using single- and multiple-mode shunting. It is the purpose of this investigation to extend the passive piezoelectric shunt-damping technique to control structural vibration induced at higher acoustic excitation levels, and to examine the controllability and survivability of the bonded PZT transducers at these high levels. The shunting experiment was performed with the <b>Thermal</b> <b>Acoustic</b> <b>Fatigue</b> Apparatus (TAFA) at the NASA Langley Research Center using the same F- 15 underbelly panel. The TAFA is a progressive wave tube facility. The panel was mounted in one wall of the TAFA test section using a specially designed mounting fixture such that the panel was subjected to grazing-incidence acoustic excitation. Five PZT transducers were used with two shunt circuits designed to control the first and second modes of the structure between 200 and 400 Hz. We first determined the values of the shunt inductance and resistance at an OASPL of 130 dB. These values were maintained while we gradually increased the OASPL from 130 to 154 dB in 6 -dB steps. During each increment, the frequency response function between accelerometers on the panel and the acoustic excitation measured by microphones, before and after shunting, were recorded. Good response reduction was observed up to the 148 dB level. The experiment was stopped at 154 dB due to wire breakage from vibration at a transducer wire joint. The PZT transducers, however, were still bonded well on the panel and survived at this high dB level. We also observed shifting of the frequency peaks toward lower frequency when the OASPL was increased. Detailed experimental results will be presented...|$|E

40|$|<b>Acoustic</b> <b>fatigue</b> is {{the result}} of high {{frequency}} lateral vibration of an aircraft panel due to time varying pressure waves caused by engine and/or aerodynamic effects. For example, acoustically induced cracks have been recorded in the lower external surface of the nacelle skin of the F/A- 18 aircraft and aft fuselage. In the case of the inlet nacelle overall sound pressure levels of the order of 172 dB have been recorded. Attempts to repair these cracks by applying standard methods of bonded repair developed for in-plane loads were made. However, the cracks continued to grow at a similar rate. While the repair of cracked aircraft structures subjected to in-plane loads using bonded repairs has resulted in considerable aircraft life time extension and hence cost savings, the use of bonded patches to repair panels with acoustically induced cracks (<b>acoustic</b> <b>fatigue)</b> is only recent. In this report a generic design procedure is presented for the repair of panels containing acoustically induced cracks using constrained layer damping (CLD). The application of bonded repairs to acoustically-induced cracks requires analytical tools that take into account high frequency out-of-plane vibration. The analytical tools described in the report will enable the rapid design of effective repairs using closed form solutions. A potential outcome for this study could be application to the repair of the batch 11 F/A- 18 aircraft which suffer from <b>acoustic</b> <b>fatigue</b> cracking on the aft fuselage.

40|$|Currently an {{increasing}} number of RAAF F/A- 18 aircraft are developing <b>acoustic</b> <b>fatigue</b> cracks on the rear fuselage. <b>Acoustic</b> <b>fatigue</b> is the result of high frequency lateral vibration of an aircraft panel as a result of time varying pressure waves caused by engine and/or aerodynamic effects. While the exact broadband power spectral density (PSD) spectrum is not available for this area of the the F/A- 18, the PSD is known for the inlet nacelle area in which cracking has occurred. Cracking in the inlet nacelle proceeded cracking in the aft fuselage by a period of several years. As a result the inlet nacelle experiences a more severe spectrum and is the PSD adopted here. Viscoelastic damping materials are used in this repair in conjunction with the constrained layer technique to reduce the lateral vibration. Since viscoelastic materials have a limited temperature range it has been necessary to use two types of damping materials to cover the expected temperature range.
