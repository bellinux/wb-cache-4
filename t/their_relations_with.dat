For {{the next few}} years Auden sent poems to Isherwood for {{comments}} and criticism; the two maintained a sexual friendship in intervals between <b>their</b> <b>relations</b> <b>with</b> others. In 1935–39 they collaborated on three plays and a travel book.|$|E
5|$|Duc had {{years of}} {{experience}} in France, which had given him a good feel of how the French might be thinking and what <b>their</b> <b>relations</b> <b>with</b> Francophile members of the ARVN might resemble. He used this to concoct some plausible sounding and incriminating documents for Mậu. They purported to show that three prominent members of the junta: Generals Minh, Kim and Don had been bought by French agents and were on the brink of declaring South Vietnam's neutrality and signing a peace deal to end the war with the North. Some of the documents were leaked to elements of the American presence in Saigon and were {{brought to the attention of}} some senior American officials.|$|E
5|$|Following the First Siege of Constantinople by the Avars and Persians, {{the beleaguered}} Byzantine Emperor Heraclius found himself {{politically}} isolated. He could {{not rely on}} the Christian Armenian potentates of Transcaucasia, since they were branded as heretics by the Orthodox Church, and even the king of Iberia preferred to befriend the religiously tolerant Persians. Against this dismal background, he found a natural ally in Tong Yabghu. Earlier in 568, the Turks under Istämi had turned to Byzantium when <b>their</b> <b>relations</b> <b>with</b> Persia soured over commerce issues. Istämi sent an embassy led by the Sogdian diplomat Maniah directly to Constantinople, which arrived in 568 and offered not only silk {{as a gift to}} Justin II, but also proposed an alliance against Sassanid Persia. Justin II agreed and sent an embassy to the Turkic Khaganate, ensuring the direct Chinese silk trade desired by the Sogdians.|$|E

5|$|In the 6th century, the Turkic-speaking nomadic Avars {{moved into}} the middle Danube area. Twice (in 562 and 566–567), the Avars {{undertook}} military expeditions against the Franks, and their routes went through the Polish lands. The Avar envoys bribed Slavic chiefs from the lands they did not control, including Pomerania, to secure their participation in Avar raids, but other than that, {{the exact nature of}} <b>their</b> <b>relations</b> <b>with</b> the Slavs in Poland is not known. The Avars had some presence or contacts in Poland also in the 7th and 8th centuries, when they left artifacts in the Kraków-Nowa Huta region and elsewhere, including a bronze belt decoration found in the Krakus Mound. This last item, from the turn of the 8th century, is used to date the mound itself.|$|E
5|$|To counter {{powerful}} neighbors {{such as the}} Kingdom of Dali (934–1253), the Song made {{alliances with}} tribal groups in southwest China which served as a protective buffer between their borders and Dali's. As long as these ethnic tribal groups paid tribute to the Song court and agreed to follow the course of its foreign policy, the Song agreed to grant military protection and allow the tribal leaders hereditary, autonomous local rule. During the 1050s, the Song put down local tribal insurrections along their borders with the Lý dynasty of Đại Việt, while <b>their</b> <b>relations</b> <b>with</b> Tai peoples and alliances with local clan leaders in the southern frontier led to a border war with Lý from 1075 to 1077.|$|E

25|$|In 1939 Finland had {{rejected}} similar Soviet demands for Finland ceding or leasing parts of its territory. Consequently, the Soviet Union attacked Finland, starting the Winter War in November. The war ended in March 1940 with Finnish territorial losses exceeding the pre-war Soviet demands, but Finland kept its sovereignty. The Baltic states were neutral in the Winter War and the Soviets praised <b>their</b> <b>relations</b> <b>with</b> the USSR as exemplary.|$|E
25|$|The {{cultural}} revival {{that began}} in the Abbasid period led to a resurfacing of the Iranian national identity; thus, the attempts of Arabization never succeeded in Iran. The Shu'ubiyya movement became a catalyst for Iranians to regain independence in <b>their</b> <b>relations</b> <b>with</b> the Arab invaders. The most notable effect of this movement was the continuation of the Persian language attested to the works of epic poet Ferdowsi, now considered the most prominent figure in Iranian literature.|$|E

25|$|In 1252, Pope Innocent IV {{decided to}} put Bosnia's bishop under the Hungarian Kalocsa jurisdiction. Such {{decision}} provoked the schism of the Bosnian Christians, who refused {{to submit to the}} Hungarians and broke off <b>their</b> <b>relations</b> <b>with</b> Rome. In that way, an autonomous Bosnian Church came into being, in which some later saw a Bogomil or Cathar Church, while in reality no trace of bogomilism, Catharism or dualism {{can be found in the}} original documents of the Bosnian Christians.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, some of {{the older}} ardo'en grew {{powerful}} through their own conquests. They regarded the unconquered areas near their territories as their own private backyards and defended these zones from all comers. This sometimes surfaced in <b>their</b> <b>relations</b> <b>with</b> Adama, such as when Bouba Njida of Rai refused to come to Adama's aid when the emir was fighting the Namchi at Poli. Instead, Bouba waited for Adama to retreat from the area to bring in his own forces and finish the enemy off. He then sent prisoners from the battle to Adama as a gift.|$|E
25|$|Some {{component}} cities {{form their}} own congressional representation, separate from their province. The representation of a city in the House of Representatives (or lack thereof) is not a criterion for its independence from a province, as Congress is the national legislative body and {{is part of the}} national (central) government. Despite Antipolo, Dasmariñas and San Jose del Monte having their own representatives in Congress, they are still component cities of Rizal, Cavite and Bulacan respectively, as their respective charters specifically converted them into component cities and do not contain any provision which severs <b>their</b> <b>relations</b> <b>with</b> their respective provincial governments.|$|E

25|$|Many Commonwealth nations play similar {{sports that}} are {{considered}} quintessentially British in character, rooted in and developed under British rule or hegemony, including football, cricket, rugby, and netball. This {{has led to the}} development of friendly national rivalries between the main sporting nations that have often defined <b>their</b> <b>relations</b> <b>with</b> each another. Indeed, said rivalries preserved close ties by providing a constant in international relationships, even as the Empire transformed into the Commonwealth. Externally, playing these sports is seen to be a sign of sharing a certain Commonwealth culture; the adoption of cricket at schools in Rwanda is seen as symbolic of the country's move towards Commonwealth membership.|$|E
25|$|The {{nature of}} the {{conflict}} has shifted over the years from the large-scale, regional Arab–Israeli conflict to a more local Israeli–Palestinian conflict, which peaked during the 1982 Lebanon War.

The same year Israel and Jordan reached a peace accord. A cease-fire has been largely maintained between Israel and Baathist Syria, as well as with Lebanon since 2006. However, developments in the course of the Syrian Civil War reshuffled the situation near Israel's northern border, putting the Syrian Arab Republic, Hezbollah and the Syrian opposition at odds with each other and complicating <b>their</b> <b>relations</b> <b>with</b> Israel.|$|E
