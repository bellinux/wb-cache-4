5|$|Off {{the coast}} of Fort Lauderdale is the Osborne Reef, an {{artificial}} reef made of discarded <b>tires</b> that {{has proven to be}} an ecological disaster. The dumping began in the 1960s, with the intent to provide habitat for fish while disposing of trash from the land. However, in the rugged and corrosive environment of the ocean, nylon straps used to secure the <b>tires</b> wore out, cables rusted, and <b>tires</b> broke free. The <b>tires</b> posed a particular threat after breaking free from their restraints. The <b>tires</b> then migrated shoreward and ran into a living reef tract, washed up on its slope and killed many things in their path. In recent years, thousands of <b>tires</b> have also washed up on nearby beaches, especially during hurricanes. Local authorities are now working to remove the 700,000 <b>tires,</b> in cooperation with the U.S. Army, Navy and Coast Guard.|$|E

Underbody scrapers are also used by some agencies and are mounted between axles, distributing plowing stresses on the chassis more evenly.|$|E

5|$|During the 1920s, the American Budd Company, at {{the time}} a {{relatively}} obscure auto-frame supplier, developed an extensive working relationship with the French firm Michelin, which was best known for its <b>tires.</b> In 1929, Michelin built its first rail car, and by 1932 nine of its cars were in operating service, all of which featured innovative and distinctive pneumatic <b>tires.</b> The company claimed that its application of <b>tires</b> on its rail cars afforded both a substantially more cushioned ride and increased the cars' traction by 35%. The design of Michelin's tired wheels included an aluminum safety ring and a flange that were only used {{in the event of a}} puncture or other type of tire failure; during normal operation, only the rubber tire made contact with the rail.|$|E

40|$|<b>Tire</b> {{industry}} {{has become one}} of the huge industries at present since the number of vehicles are rapidly increasing. Since the <b>tire</b> directly related to the vehicle safety, durability, running cost and comfort level of the passengers <b>tire</b> selection and maintenance addressed widely. Maintaining a <b>tire</b> is a duty of the vehicle user and he may has to check the <b>tire</b> rapidly for wear, cuts and other irregularities. The most important activity of <b>tire</b> maintenance is to maintain the pressure of the <b>tire.</b> The <b>tire</b> pressure is an important issue since it directly relates to the safety of the vehicle, durability, running cost and comfort level of the passengers as mentioned above. A rapid check for <b>tire</b> pressure is essential since <b>tire</b> pressure may reduce normally with the time apart from losing pressure when the <b>tire</b> drives over a pothole or hump. Checking the <b>tire</b> is done using a machine called <b>tire</b> inflator. This machine must be accurate and user friendly since the operator has to trust on it. <b>Tire</b> inflators are available mostly in <b>tire</b> shops and in gas stations. <b>Tire</b> inflators are mainly two types, Analog <b>tire</b> inflators and Digital <b>tire</b> inflators. Digital <b>tire</b> inflators arrived the market recently and analog <b>tire</b> inflators are getting replaced with digital <b>tire</b> inflators as the convenience of operation. Digital <b>tire</b> inflators read the pressure with a pressure sensor and with this sensor the dynamic pressure readings are not possible. Hence to get the static pressure the inflation process has to be stopped. In other words, while in the inflation, the <b>tire</b> inflator has no idea about the <b>tire</b> pressure until the inflation stops. In this case, to have an idea about the rise of pressure, there must be a method to identify the type of the <b>tire.</b> The <b>tire</b> identification mechanism must be fast, accurate and reliable. The other requirement is that the <b>tire</b> has to be identified online and this process must not delay the inflation process. The main tusk of this exercise is to develop an artificial neural network based <b>tire</b> identification method. A developed <b>tire</b> inflator model was used to collect information and to test the <b>tire</b> identification process. To develop the network, three inputs were considered. By expanding the number of layers in the network experiment was carried out. The results were successful and that the network with two hidden layers zero percent error achieved...|$|R
40|$|Inflation {{pressure}} affects {{every aspect}} of <b>tire</b> performance. Most <b>tire</b> models, including the Radt/Milliken Nondimensional <b>Tire</b> Model, are restricted to modeling a single inflation pressure at a time. This is a reasonable limitation, in that the Nondimensional model forms an input/output relationship between <b>tire</b> operating conditions and force & moment outputs. Traditional operating conditions are normal load, slip angle, inclination angle, slip ratio and road surface friction coefficient. <b>Tire</b> pressure {{is more like a}} <b>tire</b> parameter than a <b>tire</b> operating condition. Since the Nondimensional <b>Tire</b> Model is semi-empirical it does not specifically deal with <b>tire</b> parameters like sidewall height or tread compound. Still, <b>tire</b> pressure is the easiest <b>tire</b> parameter to change, and as the air temperature within the <b>tire</b> varies during use so does the inflation pressure. Thus, it is desirable to incorporate inflation pressure into the Nondimensional <b>Tire</b> Model as an input. This paper discusses the effects of <b>tire</b> pressure on <b>tire</b> force and moment output. Effects on lateral force and aligning torque are investigated in detail. Additionally, the effects on cornering stiffness, friction coefficients, peak aligning torque coefficient and peak shape are reviewed. New techniques to implement pressure effects in the Nondimensional Model are presented. Applications of these techniques are shown on a Formula SAE <b>tire</b> and a full-size radial racing <b>tire.</b> Additionally, the effects of inflation pressure on <b>tire</b> spring rate and loaded radius are investigated. While these are not modeled using Nondimensional techniques, they are important variables accompanying any <b>tire</b> model...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{deformation}} {{of parts of}} a <b>tire</b> is {{the direct result of}} tire–road interactions, and therefore is of great interest in <b>tire</b> sensor development.

The deformation of the <b>tire</b> carcass due to applied steady-state in-plane forces is first analyzed with the flexible ring model and then validated through optical <b>tire</b> sensor measurements. Coupled deformations of the <b>tire</b> carcass in the radial and tangential directions are observed. This reveals a promising method for <b>tire</b> sensing applications in the estimation of the in-plane <b>tire</b> force, which relies only on direct measurements of the radial deformation of the <b>tire</b> carcass.

40|$|Use of <b>tire</b> shred–soil {{mixtures}} as backfill {{materials in}} mechanically stabilized earth walls has several advantages over other backfill materials: (1) good drainage, (2) high shear strength, and (3) low compacted unit weight. This paper {{presents the results}} of laboratory pullout tests performed on uniaxial geogrid embedded in <b>tire</b> shred–sand mixtures. The effects of <b>tire</b> shred size, <b>tire</b> shred–sand mixing ratio and confining pressure on the interaction between the geogrid and <b>tire</b> shred–sand mixtures are evaluated. Three sizes of <b>tire</b> shreds are considered: <b>tire</b> chips (with 9. 5 mm nominal size), <b>tire</b> shreds 50 -to- 100 mm long and <b>tire</b> shreds 100 -to- 200 mm in length, with mixing ratios of 0, 12, 25 and 100 % of <b>tire</b> shreds in the mixtures (by weight). Based on compaction testing of a number of mixtures, the optimal mixing proportion of <b>tire</b> shreds and sand was found to lie between 25 / 75 and 30 / 70 (by weight of <b>tire</b> shred and sand); this is equivalent to approximately 40 / 60 and 50 / 50, respectively, by volume of <b>tire</b> shreds and sand. The pullout resistance of a geogrid embedded in <b>tire</b> shred–sand mixtures is significantly higher than that of the same geogrid embedded in <b>tire</b> shreds only. The size of the <b>tire</b> shreds has negligible effect on the pullout resistance of a geogrid embedded in mixtures prepared with either low (12 / 88 mix) or high (100 / 0 mix) <b>tire</b> shred content.

Because the front and rear <b>tires</b> can have different slip angles due to weight distribution, tire properties, etc., bikes can experience understeer or oversteer.
